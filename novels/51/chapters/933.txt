Chapter 934: Chapter 934, the secret of the spatial artifact 

This desert was so vast that Qin Yu even suspected that it wasn’t within the country.

He released his spiritual sense to cover the surroundings, but found that there wasn’t a single person. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I’m afraid we’ve fallen into a no man’s land,”Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

The mustached man waved his hand and said, “It doesn’t matter. We’ll definitely be able to walk out of here.”

With that, the moustache man began to dig out spirit stones.

“Haha, I’m Rich!”The moustache man excitedly waved his hands and danced.

He took out several hundred spirit stones, and his entire body lay inside.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but give the moustache man a thumbs up.

He never thought that this spirit stone mine would be cut off by him.

“With these spirit stones, my cultivation will also be much faster,”Qin Yu muttered.

Then, Qin Yu took out his spatial divine weapon and prepared to take out the spirit stones.

However, when his spiritual sense entered the spatial divine weapon, he was stunned.

“How could this be? !”Qin Yu’s brows were tightly furrowed, and his face was a bit flustered.

“What’s Wrong?”The mustached man muttered.

Qin Yu didn’t answer. He stood up and took out everything in the spatial divine weapon.

However, what shocked Qin Yu was that there was not a single spirit stone in it!

“Where are the spirit stones? !”Qin Yu widened his eyes and looked at the handlebar mustache.

The handlebar mustache frowned and asked, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu’s expression was ugly as he exclaimed, “I don’t have a single spirit stone in here!”

“AH? How is that possible!”The handlebar mustache widened his eyes and said.

Qin Yu searched through the entire spatial artifact, but he still couldn’t find any spirit stones!

At this moment, Qin Yu even suspected that the mustached man didn’t put any spirit stones in there!

“Spirit Stones... are you going to put them in or not?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

The mustached man widened his eyes and said, “Are you kidding me? Of course I put them in!”

“Then why is there not a single spirit stone in here!”Qin Yu said with an ugly expression.

“How would I know? !”The mustached man looked displeased.

Qin Yu sat on the ground in a daze, his expression extremely unsightly.

If the spirit stones were in there, how could there not be a single spirit stone?

“Don’t you doubt me. I guarantee that the spirit stones are all in there,”the mustached man said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but his expression became increasingly unsightly.

He couldn’t figure out how the Spirit Stones could have disappeared for no reason?

Wouldn’t this trip have been in vain?

“If it really can’t be done, I’ll give you some points,”the mustache man muttered.

Qin Yu sighed slightly.

He put away the spatial artifact and put away his inventory.

“Forget it.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

Although he couldn’t figure it out, he was willing to believe the Mustache Man.

Because the Mustache Man didn’t need to lie to Qin Yu.

“Let’s think of a way to leave this damn place first,”Qin Yu stood up and said.

Although he said so, the disappointment on Qin Yu’s face was still hard to hide.

“Aiya, forget it, forget it. I’ll give you half,”the mustache man muttered.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said with a bitter smile, “Let’s talk about this later.”

With that, Qin Yu turned around and planned to leave this desert.

Seeing this, the mustached man had no choice but to put away the spirit stones for the time being.

This desert was ridiculously huge. The two of them walked for an entire day, but they still couldn’t see anyone.

“Damn, what kind of damn place is this?”The mustached man couldn’t help but Mutter.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. All he could think about was the spirit stones.

The two of them walked from day to night.

They didn’t see anyone until the sky was completely dark.

“Damn, this is a good place to hide,”the mustached man muttered.

After walking for a day, the two of them were a little tired, so they decided to rest for a while.

So, the two of them found a place to lie down.

Lying in this deserted desert, Qin Yu’s mind was still thinking about the spirit stones.

When the mustached man saw Qin Yu’s ugly expression, he thought that Qin Yu was doubting him, so he said with some grievance, “Let me tell you, I really put the spirit stones in for you, unless there’s a problem with your space artifact.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned.

He hurriedly stood up and looked at the mustached man.

“What?”The mustached man muttered.

Qin Yu patted his head and said, “You said there’s a problem with the spatial artifact?”

This sentence undoubtedly reminded Qin Yu!

Back then, Luo Jingyu had thought of countless ways to get back this spatial artifact!

“Hurry up and give me a spirit stone!”Qin Yu said anxiously.

Although the handlebar mustache didn’t know what Qin Yu wanted to do, he still took out a spirit stone and handed it to Qin Yu.

Without saying anything, Qin Yu put the spirit stone into the spatial god tool.

“What?”The mustached man asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I’ll test if it’s the problem with this spatial god Tool.”

Then, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

He waited quietly.

After a few minutes, Qin Yu sent a strand of spiritual sense into the spatial god tool.

Soon, Qin Yu’s eyes widened!

“What’s Wrong?”The mustached man asked hurriedly.

Qin Yu swallowed his saliva and said, “That spiritual stone... is gone again!”

“See, I told you. It has nothing to do with me!”The mustached man hurriedly muttered.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Could it be... that this spatial artifact can swallow spiritual stones?”

“Impossible!”The mustached man waved his hand.

“According to my many years of experience, it’s impossible for a spatial artifact to produce spiritual sense, unless there’s something hidden in your spatial artifact.”

Qin Yu glanced at the mustached man and said, “You mean... only things with spiritual sense can swallow spirit stones?”

“Normally, that’s the case.”The mustached man nodded.

“But it’s hard to say. What if your broken space artifact leaks out?”

“Leaks out?”Qin Yu frowned and hurriedly looked at the ground.

The handlebar mustache said somewhat speechlessly, “Even if it leaks out, it can’t leak out to the ground. It might fall into nothingness and disappear without a trace.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He held his chin, sat on the ground and pondered for a moment, then shook his head and said, “Impossible. If this space artifact leaks out, then Luo Jingyu wouldn’t want it back so badly.”

After eliminating this possibility, there was only one possibility.

There was really something hidden in this space artifact.

And it was something with spiritual sense!

Thinking carefully, ever since he got this space artifact, Qin Yu had never examined it carefully.

Therefore, Qin Yu planned to take this opportunity to examine it carefully.

He wanted to see what was hidden in this spatial artifact that Luo Jingyu valued so much.

Therefore, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly.

A strand of spiritual sense rushed out from between his brows.

A golden light flashed and landed in the spatial ring.
