Chapter 1441: Chapter 1,441, the arrival of the Great Elder

Zhuo Jing agreed very quickly, which silenced Qin Yu, who had intended to continue bargaining.

However, Qin Yu couldn’t express Zhuo Jing’s kindness in words.

Then, Zhuo Jing used the agreed conditions to exchange for the life energy.

The Life Energy was contained in a very small bottle. Zhuo Jing casually threw the bottle to qin yu and said, “Take it and try it.”

Qin Yu took the bottle. The excitement from before had long disappeared.

A bitter smile flashed across his face.

“What’s wrong? Shouldn’t you be happy that you have the life force?”Zhuo Jing said with a smile.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I’m just thinking about a problem.”

“What problem?”Zhuo Jing asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu said, “I’ve indeed met many noblemen along the way. Life before and after the age of 30 is like two different worlds.”

With that, Qin Yu told Zhuo Jing about his past.

This included how he was abandoned and how he met Yan Ruoxue later on.

After listening to Qin Yu’s story, Zhuo Jing smiled and said, “You are wrong. The reason why you always meet noblemen later on is because you have value. That’s why the so-called noblemen came to help you.”

“And the reason why you didn’t meet the so-called noble before you turned thirty is because you don’t have any value. The so-called noble wouldn’t come to help you.”

After hearing what Zhuo Jing said, Qin Yu seemed to understand.

It seemed to be true. Regardless of whether they admitted it or not, they had to fight for justice because of Qin Yu’s potential.

“Think about it this way. There are so many ordinary people in the world. If everyone has a nobleman, wouldn’t the nobleman become a Sucker?”Zhuo Jing patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “That makes sense.”

“Alright, let’s go,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He followed Zhuo Jing and planned to leave the Exchange Guild.

However, at this moment, the first elder led everyone into the Exchange Guild with a murderous aura.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly when she saw the first elder’s figure. She hurriedly grabbed Zhuo Jing.

“Zhuo Jing, hurry up and leave,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Zhuo Jing asked suspiciously, “What’s Wrong?”

“The first elder is here,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice after taking a deep breath.

Hearing this, Zhuo Jing’s face turned solemn.

Although he had guessed that someone would inform the great elder, he didn’t expect the great elder to come so quickly.

“Leave quickly, lest you get implicated,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Zhuo jing frowned and said, “Even if I hide now, he will still know that I brought you to the replacement guild. It’s useless.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I’m going to implicate you again.”

The first Elder’s divine sense was extremely powerful, almost covering the entire displacement guild.

Very quickly, he found Qin Yu’s trace.

A group of people rushed in front of Qin Yu, with the first elder as the leader and the various protectors as support.

They surrounded Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing, afraid that they would escape.

“Qin Yu, I’ve finally found you,”the first elder said with a gloomy expression.

Qin Yu looked at the first elder coldly and said, “You came quite quickly.”

The first elder glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Have you recovered your spiritual power? The nascent Soul Realm?”

This made the first elder extremely shocked!

He had guessed that Qin Yu was very talented, but he didn’t expect that there was only the nascent soul realm in the Southern Region!

This was a bit too abnormal, and people couldn’t believe that it was true!

“Why? Do you regret it?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

The great elder sneered and said, “You’re about to die, yet you still dare to spout nonsense. Have you thought about how you’re going to die?”

At this moment, Zhuo Jing cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, Great Elder.”

Only then did the great elder’s gaze fall on Zhuo Jing. He frowned slightly and said, “Zhuo Jing? You’re actually involved with this kid?”

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “Qin Yu is my friend. It’s not strange for me to bring him to the Exchange Guild.”

The great elder narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “Do you want to die with him?”

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “Who would be willing to die if they could live? It’s just that... This is the exchange guild. I Don’t think you will act recklessly, Great Elder, right?”

The great elder swept a glance around him and then said coldly, “I don’t care where he is. Qin Yu must die today!”

After saying this, the first Elder’s aura surged and a terrifying killing intent rushed towards Qin Yu.

However, at this moment, a killing array suddenly appeared!

Rays of icy blue light rose from the surroundings of the Exchange Guild!

A terrifying killing intent swept through the entire exchange guild.

All of this killing intent rushed towards the first elder and gathered above his head like a vortex. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Seeing this killing formation, the Great Elder’s face revealed an unnatural expression.

He took a deep breath and sneered, “Qin Yu, do you think that hiding in the exchange guild will be of any use? Let me tell you, the rules of the Exchange Guild are that you can only stay for one day. You can only stay until nightfall before you leave.”

“I’ll wait for you outside. As long as you take one step out of the Exchange Guild, I’ll definitely kill you!”The Great Elder said coldly.
