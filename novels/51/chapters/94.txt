Chapter 95: What Does It Have to Do With Us? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and nodded. “Then let’s go to the beach to eat seafood?”

To Qin Yu, seafood was already considered a luxury. Ever since childhood, Qin Yu had only heard about it from others, but he had never eaten it before.

“Alright, then let’s go eat seafood. Let’s go!” Yan Ruoxue stretched out her arm in a girlish manner that was completely different from her usual image.

The two of them came to the beach.

During this season, there were countless people playing by the beach. Many people were taking photos and swimming nearby.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue found a booth and sat down. Then, Yan Ruoxue pointed at the dishes on the menu and said, “Give me a serving of all of them!”

“I can’t eat that much!” Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand.

“It’s okay. I think your appetite is quite big now.” Yan Ruoxue blinked and said.

This surprised Qin Yu a little. Ever since he stepped into the fifth level of the Qi Refining Stage, Qin Yu’s appetite had indeed become very big.

About ten minutes later, a dazzling array of seafood began to be served.

There were countless crabs, mantis shrimps, scallops, and so on.

These seafood were actually very ordinary seafood, but in Qin Yu’s eyes, it was something he couldn’t afford to eat.

During the meal, Yan Ruoxue suddenly said to Qin Yu, “Last night, was it Yan Jiang who beat you up?”

Qin Yu frowned and nodded. “Yes.”

“En... you fought with Yan Jiang and didn’t get seriously injured. That means you’re not bad!” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Qin Yu was very interested in the bodyguards of prominent families. Since Yan Ruoxue mentioned it, Qin Yu asked, “Miss Yan, what is Yan Jiang’s strength like?”

Yan Ruoxue thought for a moment and said, “He is probably a Grandmaster of Inner Strength. Maybe he’s even more powerful. I don’t know.”

“Grandmaster of Inner Strength?” Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change.

He had heard from Yao Qing that Inner Strength Master Hands were ranked above Inner Strength Masters. Inner Strength Past Masters were ranked above the Master Hands of Inner Strength, and of Inner Strength Grandmasters were even more powerful.

Even if such masters didn’t work as bodyguards for the prominent families, they could still venture on their own and become big shots.

“It seems that Yan Jiang has gone easy on me, and by quite a lot...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but force a smile.

Yan Ruoxue stared at Qin Yu and said, “Actually, many aristocratic families have a group of martial artists. Not only our family, but also in Chuzhou.”

“I once asked someone to investigate. There is an Inner Strength Grandmaster in Chuzhou. You have to be careful in the future,” Yan Ruoxue warned him seriously.

“Inner Strength Grandmaster...” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

This level indeed wasn’t something that Qin Yu could currently compare with.

If an Inner Strength Grandmaster was converted to the cultivation level, he should be at the monastic stage. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

However, cultivation wasn’t martial arts after all, so his capabilities were naturally beyond that of martial arts.

Qin Yu was fully confident that as long as he reached the Foundation Establishment Stage, he would be able to advance by leaps and bounds and defeat an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

“However, you don’t have to worry too much. Inner Strength Grandmasters are considered to be as rare as Phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. I’m afraid that there are no more than ten of them in the entire Chuzhou,” Yan Ruoxue continued.

Qin Yu nodded silently.

At this time, Qin Yu asked curiously, “Miss Yan, do the young masters of Jingdu... have this kind of ability?”

At the mention of this topic, Yan Ruoxue’s expression changed slightly.

She put down the chopsticks in her hand and said in a low voice, “It depends on the situation. Some families value martial arts, so their children naturally aren’t bad at it. Some families don’t value martial arts, so they keep a group of bodyguards.”

Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Then what is the strength of the most powerful of those young masters?”

Yan Ruoxue thought for a moment and said, “There are a few geniuses in Jingdu... they seem to be on the verge of becoming martial grandmasters.”

Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

Martial grandmasters! That was Yan Jiang’s level of strength!

Qin Yu knew very well inside that currently, he and Yan Jiang were worlds apart in terms of strength!

“However, for you to be able to reach the Grandmaster realm within a year is already very, very impressive. It’s enough to make the Yan family look at you in a new light!” Yan Ruoxue patted Qin Yu’s shoulder with an affirmative expression.

Qin Yu didn’t think so.

He took a deep breath and said, “I want to surpass them within a year!”

“Pfft!” Yan Ruoxue rolled her eyes at Qin Yu.

“It’s not that I don’t believe you, but it’s simply impossible.” Yan Ruoxue blinked her eyes and said.

At this point, Yan Ruoxue leaned towards Qin Yu’s ear and whispered, “Don’t feel too much pressure. If you really don’t achieve any results after a year, I... I’ll elope with you!”

After saying this, Yan Ruoxue blushed all the way to the root of her neck.

Even Yan Ruoxue herself didn’t believe that she was the one who said these words!

As a girl from a large aristocratic family, how could she say such shameful words...

“How embarrassing!” Yan Ruoxue covered her face and whispered.

Qin Yu only felt a sense of warmth inside.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue seriously and said, “Miss Yan, I promised you that I would go to Jingdu to propose marriage openly! I will make the Yan family accept me and I will take you to see the most beautiful scenery!”

“Gee, let’s eat. Let’s eat.” Yan Ruoxue hurriedly lowered her head shyly.

“I didn’t expect Miss Yan to have such a girly side,” Qin Yu said jokingly.

Yan Ruoxue glared at Qin Yu. “If you dare to say that again, I will beat you up!”

After saying that, Yan Ruoxue clenched her little fists and hit Qin Yu’s body.

“Gee, it hurts...” Qin Yu pretended to be in pain and covered his wound.

“Ah!” Yan Ruoxue’s expression changed and she said anxiously, “I’m sorry, I forgot that you have injuries. I’ll find a doctor right away...”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly laughed out loud. “I tricked you!”

“Well, you have quite some guts now!” Yan Ruoxue clenched her small fist and started to fool around with Qin Yu again.

While the two of them were playing, a few bodyguards in black suddenly walked over from a short distance away.

There was a beautifully dressed woman in the middle of them. This woman was wearing sunglasses and a mask on her face.

Even though she had wrapped herself up tightly, one could still tell that her appearance was gorgeous.

A few bodyguards walked in front of Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue and said somewhat domineeringly, “We are going to take photos. We have commandeered this place. You guys can eat in another place.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Yan Ruoxue quickly switched back to her cool demeanor.

“What does you taking photos have anything to do with us?” Yan Ruoxue looked at the bodyguard and said with a somewhat cold tone.
