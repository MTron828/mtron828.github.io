Chapter 520: Get Rid of Qin Yu Immediately! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As soon as he boarded the plane, Xia Hang hurriedly sent a text message.

This text message was sent to the higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

...

At this moment, many members of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were looking at Qin Yu nervously.

Just now, Qin Yu’s combat strength had already made them lose the confidence to resist.

If they were to fight now, they probably had no chance of winning.

Qin Yu sized up everyone and didn’t say anything for a long time.

“Do you want to kill us?” At this moment, someone took the initiative to ask.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and thought for a moment, then said, “I can spare you guys, but you have to hand over all the herbs on your body.”

Everyone looked at each other.

This might be a good alternative.

“Do it yourselves. If you let me search, it won’t be so comfortable,” Qin Yu said as he stepped on the ground.

No one dared to say anything. They all took out their herbs and placed them in front of Qin Yu.

The herbs from the stone tablet all fell into Qin Yu’s pocket.

In addition to what they had consumed in the past few days, there were also three five-thousand-year-old herbs.

After looting everything, Qin Yu looked at the crowd.

“When something happens, he runs away first. Is this the Jingdu Martial Arts Association that you guys rely on?” Qin Yu’s tone was full of ridicule.

“If that’s the case, you might as well follow me. At least I won’t abandon you guys and run for my own life,” Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

“Qin Yu, you’re too naive.”

At this moment, a young man said in a deep voice.

This young man was called Chu Hedao. He was the son of the Chu family and was now also a half-step Martial Marquis.

“We admit that your strength isn’t bad, but do you really think that we came to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association just to increase our strength?” Chu Hedao continued.

Qin Yu glanced at him, indicating for him to continue.

Chu Hedao stood up and said, “The resources that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has are not limited to martial power.”

“In other words, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is similar to the Chamber of Commerce. It can consolidate our social class and ensure that our resources and connections won’t go to outsiders.”

At this point, Chu Hedao glanced at Qin Yu and said, “At the same time, it also ensures that people like you won’t suddenly rise up and affect our status.”

Qin Yu was speechless for a moment.

He didn’t expect that Chu Hedao would tell him this.

Most importantly, what he said made sense.

“I know what you’re thinking. You either want to replace us or make us disappear,” Chu Hedao continued.

“No matter which one it is, you can’t do it with your current strength.”

After saying this, Chu Hedao didn’t say anything more.

He swept a glance at everyone and then left.

Looking at Chu Hedao’s back, Qin Yu couldn’t help but rub his chin.

“The Chu family... is a bit interesting,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The others didn’t stay any longer. They all stood up and left.

It had to be said that after so many years of development in Jingdu, the relationship between the various families was impregnable.

Although there would be disputes and secret fights between them, none of the fights would extend out of this social class.

After all, this was a modern society. Wealth was too powerful.

“Alright, everyone has left. You can come out now,” Qin Yu shouted at the bottom of the cliff.

The man with the mustache tiptoed and revealed a pair of eyes.

After confirming that there was no one, the man with the mustache patted the soil on his body.

“They really left. I really admire you. You actually challenged the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.” The man with the mustache sighed.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Stop talking nonsense and quickly make your move.”

Then, the man with the mustache took out his tools and began to make his move against the Dragon Vein.

...

At the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Xia Hang sat in the meeting room in a disheveled manner.

His expression wasn’t good, and there was even a hint of panic.

“Xia Hang, I asked you to lead the team to the Dragon Vein, yet you came back on your own like this?” Someone said coldly.

“Those people are all descendants of the major aristocratic families, and they are also the elite forces of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Now, you have abandoned them and come back on your own. Where is your sense of responsibility?”

“You’re so cowardly and afraid of death. I don’t think you should have the position of vice president.”

Xia Hang’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “I, Xia Hang, am absolutely not cowardly or afraid of death. I’ve returned this time because I have something important to report to everyone.”

“Something important? Let me tell you, if any one of them dies, you won’t be able to bear the consequences,” someone said coldly.

Xia Hang’s expression was extremely ugly. He gritted his teeth, stood up and said, “What I have to say is definitely more important than their lives!”

“Nonsense!” Someone shouted!

This voice contained surging inner strength and was directly aimed at Xia Hang!

As a half-step Martial Marquis, Xia Hang vomited blood!

This made people wonder, just what kind of strength did these higher-ups hiding in the shadows have?!

“Let him speak. If he can’t come up with a reasonable explanation today, then he doesn’t need to stay in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.” A woman’s voice was heard.

Xia Hang hurriedly bowed and then said, “Although we have observed Qin Yu, we didn’t pay enough attention to him.”

“The understanding of him is limited to his fights with the Han family and the Yan family.”

“In our impression, we always thought that he was just an ordinary person with good martial arts talent. He has no powerful background and no mentor.”

“But today... he used a spell.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Xia Hang paused for a moment.

Someone in the dark asked, “What spell?”

“The cosmic form,” Xia Hang said.

When the cosmic form was mentioned, the entire conference room fell into silence.

After a while, someone finally spoke.

“Are you sure it’s the cosmic form?”

Xia Hang hurriedly said, “I’m 100% sure! Although this guy’s cosmic form wasn’t mature enough, it’s definitely the cosmic form!”

“The cosmic form... has been in existence for a long time.”

“In the whole world, there aren’t many people who can use the cosmic form.”

“It’s not that there aren’t many. According to our information, there’s only one person who used the cosmic form before and almost destroyed the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Xia Hang hurriedly said, “I suspect that Qin Yu has a relationship with that person! If we let him become more powerful, the consequences would be unimaginable!”

Speaking up to this point, Xia Hang stood up and said, “I suggest that we immediately mobilize the most powerful forces and get rid of Qin Yu!”
