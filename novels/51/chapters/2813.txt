Chapter 2814: Meeting Cang Yunzi Again

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After entering the city, Qin Yu and the others quickly arrived at Cang Yunzi’s residence.

At this moment, Cang Yunzi’s residence was completely devoid of the hustle and bustle of the past.

In the darkness of the night, not a single lantern was lit. The entire courtyard was overgrown with weeds. The weeds even crossed the courtyard and crawled over a large tile wall.

“Qin Yu, this doesn’t look like a place for people to live. It looks like a courtyard that has been abandoned for hundreds of years instead.”

Chang Mang said doubtfully.

“It shouldn’t be! Let’s go in and take a look.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He originally wanted to go to the trading market.

However, too many people were there, so it would be inappropriate to go there.

They directly jumped into the city wall. The array formation here had long since dried up.

Moreover, the courtyard was in ruins. There seemed to be traces of a fight.

“Could it be that something happened?”

Qin Yu frowned.

Previously, Cang Yunzi’s Five Declines of Celestial Beings was almost exhausted, but he obtained a fortuitous encounter with the Heavenly Sin. With his intelligence, it shouldn’t be to such an extent.

“Who is it?”

Suddenly, a black shadow in the courtyard shook.

Chang Mang’s attention was immediately drawn and he charged forward.

In a short while, the black shadow was brought back like a little chick.

“Wang Da?”

When Qin Yu saw the face of the person who came, he could not help being somewhat stunned.

“Boss Qin Yu, you’re finally here. Quickly leave with me.”

The moment Wang Da’s dejected face saw Qin Yu, he also stiffened.

“What happened?”

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly, but Wang Da did not show any strange phenomenon at all.

“Starting from three months ago, the heaven and earth of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom has already changed. Daoist Master Cang Yunzi abandoned this place long ago but he predicted that you might come back to look for him. Hence, he made me wait nearby. The heavens have finally pitied me.”

Wang Da’s face was full of tears.

“Sir, please follow me.”

Wang Da led the way.

Aiden turned to look at Qin Yu with a questioning gaze.

Qin Yu nodded and gestured for them to follow.

They headed north to an extremely remote place before finally arriving at a new place.

Many bewildering formations were set up in these places. They were only used to hide the internal qi.

Therefore, it would be really difficult to find this location unless someone had specially investigated it.

“Why did Daoist Priest Cang Yunzi find such a deep forest? And how did you know I would come back?”

Qin Yu asked in confusion.

“How could I not know?”

Cang Yunzi said with a bitter smile.

At this moment, Cang Yunzi’s expression was bright. After obtaining longevity from the Heavenly Sin, he had become much younger.

The old death qi had completely faded. Now, he looked like a refined young man with an extraordinary temperament!

If Qin Yu hadn’t known Cang Yunzi before, he would never have imagined that this person was the old man from the Five Declines of Celestial Beings.

“The matter of the Investiture of Gods has already shaken the entire Saint World. Moreover, you appeared at the Nine Nether Cliff before. My intuition is that you must be related to this matter. Even the fragment of the Investiture of Gods should be in your hands!”

After hearing these words, both Chang Mang and Fatty Situ were filled with killing intent.

“Hahaha! As expected of the Taoist Priest. I’m here to ask for some information.”

Qin Yu was not surprised. Since he was able to rope in a team of experts like Reiya Alester and Fatty Situ, one could imagine that this Taoist Priest was not an ordinary person. It was normal for him to have such a scheme.

“What happened after the war on the Treasure Continent? Could you please tell us in detail?”

Qin Yu cupped his fists and said.

“Fellow Qin Yu, there’s no need to be polite with me. I entered the Heavenly Sin with you and borrowed your strength to get a new lifespan from the hands of the Heavenly Sin. Even if I have to repay this favor with my life, I won’t dare to say anything.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Cang Yunzi subconsciously stroked his long beard.

“Hurry up and tell us, old man. Don’t keep me in suspense.”

Chang Mang was annoyed by the wait and urged from the side.

“Alright, let’s talk about it. In the previous battle with the Situ family, the three Holy Lords- Jue Chen, Lucifer, and the Eye of Destruction Shimoji had personally joined. However, the Situ family’s Dharms Treasure had blocked the powerful attack of the power of Saint Kingdom. Lucifer was injured by the Ten Days Golden Crow. The Eye of Destruction and Jue Chen had fought against Situ Qianxun and the other experts of the Situ family. With the power that Situ Qianxun had developed, they were evenly matched.”

Cang Yunzi began to explain in detail.

“This also fully shows how terrifying the Situ family’s foundation is. One must know that the three Holy Lords are the top three in the Saint World. Furthermore, they came with the power of Saint Kingdom. It’s already very exaggerated that they can be on par with the three Holy Lords. If it wasn’t for the powerful Demon Lord Zi Yang who appeared later, I’m afraid the three Holy Lords would have returned empty-handed.”

“That’s impossible. Saint Zi Yang’s position was almost four times that of the other three Holy Lords. How could he have rushed over in time? At the level of a Holy Lord, one’s speed should have already reached a limit. If one wants to break through this limit, one will have to pay a huge price. Zi Yang shouldn’t be using his limit to travel, right?”

Aiden asked in confusion.

He had King’s blood on him and had always been by the Fairy Queen Galadriel’s side.

Therefore, he had a deeper understanding of some of the deep powers than Fatty Situ.

“You little elf knows a lot!”

Cang Yunzi looked at Aiden in surprise.

“Zi Yang’s true body didn’t arrive on the battlefield, but his plane projection.”

“This is impossible!”

Fatty Situ immediately shook his head.

With the Situ family’s strength, they could even fight back against the three Holy Lords’ true bodies.

How could they fall under the power of a projection?

Although a high-level Dimensional Projection could erupt with strength comparable to the true body, it was restricted by many factors. This included the limitations of the magical artifacts used.

“That’s the truth. Perhaps I can only say he has 60% to 70% of his strength. Zi Yang is more terrifying than the other three Holy Lords. Anyway, the Situ family was completely defeated after Zi Yang arrived.”

Cang Yunzi shook his head.

“Is the Demon Holy Lord’s strength that terrifying?”

Qin Yu felt heavy.

He did not expect this Saint who had turned from a human to a demon would be so terrifying.

It was already an unimaginable power to affect a battle with a Dimensional projection.

“On another battlefield, the Alester family was also attacked by the true bodies of the two Saints, Emerald Serpent Witch and Netherworld Ghost King. However, the Alester family was located in a remote area.”
