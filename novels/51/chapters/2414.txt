“I’ll ask one last question. Where is Ji Yuhong? Are the people from Thunder Courtyard alright?”

“Hahaha, Qin Yu, Qin Yu! How did I not realize earlier that you’re so simple-minded? If you hadn’t come to my Ji family, they might have suffered a lot but would have been alright. But now that you’re here, we can’t be bothered to retract the power of the curse. It makes things much easier.”

Ji Ao smiled, but his eyes were filled with killing intent.

Qin Yu snatched the ghostly sword from his hands. It was a humiliation he could never erase for the rest of his life.

“Qin Yu, my Ji family received news that Ji Yuhong seems to have been treating you like her son. In that case, I have to take good care of her.”

Ji Ao moved his fingers, and a nearly transparent skeleton exploded in his hand. The silver-green internal qi fused into the air and drifted to a specific place.

Instantly, Qin Yu heard a tremendously distorted and agonizing scream that sounded like experiencing immense pain.

“Ji Ao!”

Qin Yu’s pupils were bloodshot. The other members of the Ji family stared at him indifferently.

Qin Yu had voluntarily come to the Ji family. They did not even have the thought of negotiating with him. In their eyes, Qin Yu was already a sitting duck.

“Kneel!”

A Supreme Elder of the Ji family stepped out. He was one of the three leaders, Ji Wudi.

The aura of the Soul Sinking suddenly burst out. Qin Yu instantly felt a mountain pressing on his shoulders.

A black saber appeared in Qin Yu’s hand.

Nearly at the same time, the Saber of Annihilation exploded in front of Ji Ao.

Ji Wudi’s withered palm was held out in front and put out the black flame as if it were a match.

“A fourth-grade True Saint trying to sneak attack the people of the Ji family in front of me? Aren’t you looking down on me?”

Looking drowsy, Ji Wudi suddenly clawed through space and reached for Qin Yu’s head.

The power of the Tribulation Third Level was instantly revealed. It was a direct suppression of strength.

Qin Yu suddenly grabbed the withered palm, and a layer of silver light instantly appeared on his hair.

The bright silver light seemed to have dyed his hair silver instantly.

“Ninth Heaven Divine Thunder! Second level!”

Black! Purple! The two divine thunders merged in the air and suddenly landed on Ji Wudi.

It was Immortal Emperor Lei’s most powerful technique. Qin Yu was actually able to activate two layers of divine thunder at a critical moment. Struck by these two layers of divine thunder, a terrifying wound appeared on Ji Wudi’s body.

“Little bastard, you dare to hurt me!”

Ji Wudi was no longer as calm as earlier, and his face was almost distorted.

The power of the ancestor of sorcery! Protection!

His Sea of Soul surged, and his dry skin bulged like a balloon. Ji Wudi turned from a skinny old man into a three-meter-tall giant.

His bones were making deafening popping sounds, and his muscles were expanding one after another. The ancestor of sorcery’s protection was the most formidable physical power that guarded the ancestor of sorcery. This kind of protection power could stimulate the greatest potential of the physical body. It was the last power to protect the weak body of the ancestor of sorcery.

The aura on his body rose at a terrifying speed. His original power of Tribulation Third Level Soul Sinking leaped to the middle stage of the third level after using this technique.

“Hehehe!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Boom!”

Ji Wudi’s feet lightly bounced and directly broke the ground.

His body moved slightly, but he strangely stopped in place, leaving behind an afterimage.

Almost simultaneously, a gust of strong wind exploded in front of Qin Yu, and a forceful roundhouse kick suddenly struck directly above his head, generating a thunderous sound. The moment this kick landed on Qin Yu, the afterimage earlier gradually disappeared.

Before Qin Yu could react, his entire body had been sent flying.

In an instant, his body crashed through countless mountains. This roundhouse kick shattered his entire shoulder, and he could not lift his arm.

“What a tough body! I initially wanted to kick and explode you, but it looks like there’s still time to play.”

Ji Wudi grinned and gave his neck a little twist.

His body stopped moving, and in less than a breath, he landed in front of Qin Yu and was about to kick him.

The primordial rune!

The blurry rune appeared again, and a terrifying internal qi instantly surged in Qin Yu’s hand.

After Qin Yu manifested the primordial rune, its power suddenly appeared in his hand.

Qin Yu’s body trembled. He controlled this enormous force with all his might and then used a technique.

Singularity Space!

This was the first time he used the power of origin to manifest Singularity Space. In an instant, Qin Yu’s body became as elusive as a reflection of the moon in the water.

Even those two Supreme Elders lost their lock on Qin Yu in an instant.

With Qin Yu as the center, tens of thousands of enormous spaces suddenly opened up.

Tens of thousands of gravitational forces from different directions were pulled out. The enormous gravitational force was like chains that pulled the only person inside.

Ji Wudi felt like sinking into a quagmire. He tried to burst out the protective power of the ancestor of sorcery with all his might, but his body moved as if in slow motion.

Singularity Collision!

Qin Yu stretched out his palm, and dozens of veins on his forehead bulged like pythons.

His face also turned blood red. This power had already exceeded the limits of his control.

Qin Yu slowly turned his palm, and the ten thousand layers of space suddenly collided with each other.

The collision of different spaces itself would cause a destructive explosion.

Although it was a tremendously simple space, after 100,000 times of explosions, the power increased exponentially.

In that tremendously small space, a destructive power surged within.

Ji Wudi’s protective power merely lasted for a while before his body fused with this terrifying energy.

“D*mn it!”

Ji Tianming’s expression changed drastically. This happened in an instant.

Two Tribulation Second Level Ji family’s elders attacked at lightning speed and slapped Qin Yu.

“Chaotic Demon Water, explode!”

All living things were destroyed!

A destructive force exploded in the chest of one of them, instantly turning his body into minced meat.

Qin Yu, holding the black knife in her hand and using the explosive power of the Demon Confusion Water, killed one person with all his might.

“Little bastard, you’re courting death!”

The other elder flew into a rage. He struck Qin Yu’s chest with all his might.

That power instantly swam all over Qin Yu’s body and penetrated through his back. His body was suddenly sent flying by this enormous power.

His body crashed into the main hall behind him, causing the hall of the Ji family to collapse.

He had used up all his strength in the previous slash, so he practically relied on his body to receive this palm.

Ji Yuhong was hanging in the air. After a day, her body was covered in blood.

Even though she was unconscious, her body was twitching uncontrollably as if she was suffering from intense pain!

This scene made Qin Yu’s eyes almost burst with anger.

“Hahaha! If you want my things, I’ll bite a few pieces of meat off your Ji family even if I die!”
