A month had passed. It was time Qin Yu could use the technique to change his appearance again.

“What are you doing?” Yan Ruoxue whispered in Qin Yu’s ear, feeling puzzled.

Qin Yu covered his ugly face and said, “It’s too ugly. Let me change my face first.”

“If you change your face now, who in the Yan family can recognize you? It’ll be troublesome if you’re caught as an assassin,” Yan Ruoxue teased from the side.

!!

Qin Yu thought about it and found it made sense.

“Then what do I do?” Qin Yu said while covering his face.

Yan Ruoxue reached out and pulled Qin Yu’s hand away.

Qin Yu was instantly flustered and subconsciously wanted to cover his face.

“Alright. Do you think I care about this?” Yan Ruoxue asked.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and agreed with her. After all, he was not handsome in the past. At least when compared to those children of aristocratic families, he was too far off.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu let go of his hands.

Looking at Qin Yu’s face, Yan Ruoxue could not help but chuckle secretly.

“Is it very ugly?” Qin Yu asked.

“No, I actually think it’s fine,” Yan Ruoxue waved her hands and said.

“That’s good,” Qin Yu responded.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask, “You… Did you send people to monitor me?”

Yan Ruoxue held her chin and thought for a while before saying, “You can say that, but not really.”

Qin Yu had wanted to ask but felt it was unnecessary after thinking about it. Thus he smiled.

“You’re quite bold to come to the Yan family.” Yan Ruoxue reached out and pinched Qin Yu’s face.

“To see you, I’m not afraid even if I have to go through hell or high water,” Qin Yu chuckled.

“Really?”

“Yes.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Yan Ruoxue pulled Qin Yu’s hand, stood up, and said, “Alright. You are safe at Mount Donghuang for now. No one will find out.”

Qin Yu nodded, but in the next second, he couldn’t help but sigh.

“I don’t know why. I felt like we’re having an improper relationship,” Qin Yu said with emotion.

D*mn it! She was his wife, but he had to hide it. This feeling was really unpleasant.

“You, silly!” Yan Ruoxue laughed. “Don’t overthink. Since you’re already here, just stay. I’ll be more at ease taking care of you.

“I don’t need anyone to take care of me anymore!” Qin Yu said, unconvinced.

“Really?” Yan Ruoxue asked again.

“Yes.” This time, Qin Yu answered very earnestly.

He had concealed his internal qi. So Yan Ruoxue could not detect Qin Yu’s strength at this moment.

Fortunately, Yan Ruoxue sent someone to keep an eye on Qin Yu. Therefore, she was naturally aware of Qin Yu’s performance.

“Let’s not talk about that.” Yan Ruoxue stood up, pulled Qin Yu, and walked quickly to the cliff.

Standing here, one could almost overlook the entire Zhongzhou and see all the beautiful scenery.

Even Qin Yu could not help but be attracted by the background in front of him.

He overlooked the huge Zhongzhou and murmured, “What beautiful scenery…”

Qin Yu was stunned.

Looking down from above, it was so beautiful that it was a little unreal.

While Qin Yu was looking down at the beautiful scenery, Yan Ruoxue was holding her chin and quietly looking at Qin Yu. A smile appeared on her beautiful face.

No one else had ever seen such a smile.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly turned around and leaned on Qin Yu’s shoulder. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu was slightly stunned. He looked at Yan Ruoxue, who was in his arms and felt an indescribable sense of security.

Qin Yu also tried to reach out his hand and gently put it around Yan Ruoxue’s waist.

The two sat there quietly and chatted about everything. Neither of them mentioned anything about cultivation.

In the dark, Uncle Yan could not help but frown.

Especially when he saw Qin Yu hugging Yan Ruoxue. He really wanted to kill Qin Yu with his own hands.

“Hmph,” Uncle Yan snorted coldly. But in the end, he held back.

As night fell, Qin Yu followed what Jue Wu did. He began to roast meat on the edge of the cliff.

Yan Ruoxue had obtained the seasoning from somewhere and sprinkled it on the meat, and it instantly became so tasty.

Qin Yu took a bite and couldn’t help but be amazed.

“This tastes like the skewers I’ve eaten before.” Qin Yu pursed her lips.

“I felt the same.” Yan Ruoxue nodded her head repeatedly. Her mouth was stained with oil, and she didn’t look like a lady at all.

The more they did this, the more unhappy Uncle Yan became, seeing all this in the dark.

“This Qin Yu will definitely cause harm to Miss Yan.” Uncle Yan couldn’t help but curse.

...

In the following few days, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue spent their time sightseeing. Yan Ruoxue even gave all her pills and treasures to Qin Yu.

Simply a holy herb could bring unimaginable effects.

The two were like a real couple, which was quite unusual on Mount Donghuang.

Fortunately, there weren’t many people on Mount Donghuang. Therefore, no one discovered Qin Yu.

For five days, Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu gave up on their cultivation.

Uncle Yan, hiding in the dark, couldn’t stand it anymore. He quickly walked out of the darkness.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were lying on the grass. Qin Yu was holding Yan Ruoxue’s hand and thinking about the future.

“The scenery of Mount Donghuang is really good. After we book it, we can live here in seclusion,” Qin Yu muttered.

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and said, “No! No! No! I’m already sick of this place. Let’s go to another place.”

“That’s true. Then I’ll take you out of the Holy Region later. I’ll find an uninhabited planet where we can live,” Qin Yu said with a serious look.

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue burst out laughing.

...

“Isn’t it a little too extravagant for only the two of us to live on a planet?” she rolled her eyes and said.

“No, it’s not. In the future, we can make children when whenever we have nothing to do. Wouldn’t it be lively if we make a few hundred children?” Qin Yu grinned and said.

“Go to hell.” Yan Ruoxue acted coquettishly and patted Qin Yu.

Uncle Yan couldn’t stand it anymore. He walked forward and said with a dark face, “Miss Yan, you haven’t been cultivating for eight days. The day after tomorrow is the 28th baptism ceremony. You should start preparing yourself.”

Hearing Uncle Yan’s voice, Qin Yu quickly sat up straight, not daring to act rashly.

Yan Ruoxue said with a smile. “Uncle Yan, don’t worry. I’ve already made the necessary preparations.”

Uncle Yan opened his mouth and said, “Miss Yan, you… Don’t forget your identity. Your life these few days… was really a little… a little outrageous.”

“Don’t worry, Uncle Yan. I know what I should be doing,” Yan Ruoxue said playfully.

Uncle Yan opened his mouth and said rather unhappily, “Miss Yan, you’ve never been like this before…”
