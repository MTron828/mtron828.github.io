Chapter 1047: Chapter 1,047, the world where the Yan family was located 

The Immortal Crane had its back facing the crowd. It was silent for a long time, but it did not say a single word.

“Tomorrow, I will tell you why.”

After a moment, the immortal crane suddenly spoke.

Once it finished speaking, it picked up Qin Yu, turned around, and walked towards its grotto-heaven.

Wu haichen, Uncle Niu, and the others looked at each other. They looked at each other in dismay.

...

The next day.

Qin Yu woke up in a daze.

He rubbed his forehead. He felt that his head was a little heavy, and there was also a hint of pain.

“Damn, this wine is on my head,”Qin Yu muttered as he rubbed his forehead.

As he was saying this, he suddenly came to his senses and quickly looked around. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He saw himself lying on the jade bed, while the immortal crane was sitting on the jade bed with its upper body naked.

Qin Yu’s expression changed greatly, and he hurriedly sat up from the bed.

“F * ck! Are you really a pervert?”Qin Yu said with a nervous expression.

Immortal Crane glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “I’m not interested in men.”

Qin Yu looked around, and after confirming that he was fine, he heaved a sigh of relief.

“F * ck, I actually drank too much.”Qin Yu rubbed his head and slowly stood up from the jade bed.

“By the way, what kind of wine is that? I can actually get drunk,”Qin Yu muttered.

“Do you want it? I’ll give you a few bottles.”The Immortal Crane waved its hand and a few jade clear bottles landed in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not stand on ceremony. He smiled as he took the few bottles of wine and kept them in his bag.

“It’s rare for me to be confused, so I’ll accept it,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

At this moment, immortal crane suddenly said with a serious expression, “When do you plan to go back?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “I still have a lot of things to do. I Can’t stay for too long. Just these two days.”

“What about after you go back? Do you want to start a war with the second mystic realm?”Immortal Crane asked.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Regardless of whether we win or lose, this war is unavoidable.”

Hearing this, immortal crane suddenly moved his face closer.

He said with a faint smile, “Do you want me to help you?”

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment, then he said with a wry smile, “Of course I want to, but I know that you will definitely not help. Moreover, I have also seen the attitude of Uncle Niu and the others.”

Immortal crane asked indifferently, “Then do you want me to help you?”

“Of course I want to!”Qin Yu said.

“If I have your help, it will be like adding wings to a tiger, like divine help.”

The Immortal Crane slowly sat up straight.

He stared at Qin Yu and said seriously, “Call me big brother, and I will help you.”

“Ah?”Qin Yu was stunned.

“Why? Are You Not Willing?”The Immortal Crane said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

“Yes, of course I am willing!”Qin Yu came back to his senses and said excitedly, “Big Brother!”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “You’re willing to help me just because I Call You Big Brother? Isn’t that too fake?”

“Hahahaha!”When immortal crane heard this, he couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Follow me,”said immortal crane.

“Where to?”

“You’ll know in a while.”

Immortal Crane stretched out his palm, and a long robe fell on his body.

Then, it turned around and walked out of the grotto-heaven.

Although Qin Yu was puzzled, he still followed quickly.

The two of them walked in the demon city. Countless people greeted the immortal crane along the way.

The two of them passed through the demon city and arrived at a secret chamber deep in the demon city.

At that moment, Uncle Niu and the others were already waiting at the door of the secret chamber.

“You’re Awake?”Su Yi looked at Qin Yu and asked with a smile.

Qin Yu rubbed his forehead and said somewhat embarrassedly, “I’m awake. I accidentally drank too much yesterday.”

“Do you still remember what you said yesterday?”Su Yi said with a bit of a ruminating tone.

“What?”Qin Yu thought that something was wrong.

Su Yi didn’t answer this question. Instead, she leaned forward and said mysteriously, “Who is Yan Ruoxue?”

Qin Yu blushed and waved his hand. “Don’t help me remember after drinking.”

“Hahaha!”Uncle Niu and the others could not help but laugh.

At this moment, the door in front of them slowly opened.

“Let’s go.”Immortal Crane took the lead and walked in.

Following behind Immortal Crane, they entered the secret room.

“Uncle Niu, what is immortal crane doing?”Qin Yu asked softly.

Uncle Niu shook his head. “I don’t know either.”

Immortal Crane led the few of them through the long corridor and finally stopped in front of a painting scroll.

This painting scroll was extremely huge. A beautiful scene was outlined on it. The delicate strokes could not help but make people feel as if they were immersed in the painting.

Other than that, the painting scroll was exuding an extremely ancient and simple aura. Every single place was exuding an internal Qi of the Great Dao.

Qin Yu looked at the painting scroll and was immediately attracted by it.

“This painting scroll... seems a little strange,”Qin Yu said with a frown.

Uncle Niu and the others did not seem to have seen this painting scroll before. The expressions on their faces were similar to Qin Yu’s.

The Immortal Crane swept its gaze over everyone and said in a somewhat low voice, “Didn’t you all want to know why I agreed to Qin Yu’s request? This is the reason.”

“What do you mean?”Su Yi was the first to ask.

The Immortal Crane did not say a word. It waved its hand, and rays of light landed on the painting.

Following that, the painting seemed to come to life. The people and scenery inside seemed to move.

“Buzz!”

Divine sense flew out from between their brows!

This divine sense directly entered the painting. In an instant, it was as if they had entered another world!

It was as if they had opened up their God’s perspective, looking down from above, to be able to overlook the entire land!

Within this world, Qin Yu could see an endless stretch of land, with city after city situated within this world.

Its size and prosperity far exceeded one’s imagination!

Any random city, its size and scale far exceeded the fire country’s Pyro!

As the view was too far away, Qin Yu and the others were only able to catch a glimpse of a corner. But even so, their hearts were still greatly shaken!

They could even feel the Great Dao Qi flowing through the land, as well as the incomparable internal Qi!

“Weng!”

Without waiting for them to think any further, their divine sense had already been drawn out from the painting.
