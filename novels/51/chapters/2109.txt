2110 Fate-defying Disease

Yao Meng didn’t say a word. She seemed to have become accustomed to this kind of abuse.

Qin Yu supported Yao Meng. He looked at the cultivators and said coldly, “You guys dislike Yao Meng because she now can’t cultivate. Why do you find so many excuses?”

“So what if it’s true?” the few people sneered and said.

“Then do you know Yao Meng’s talent?” Qin Yu sneered and said. “Do you know her talent was once on par with Saintess Gu?”

“Hahaha!” The group of people suddenly burst into laughter as if they had heard the funniest joke in the world.

“She? Talent?”

“Qin Yu, you dare to say that. She’s just a good-for-nothing. You dare to say that she’s not inferior to Saintess Gu?”

Yao Meng pulled Qin Yu’s arm and said softly, “Forget it.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qin Yu ignored Yao Meng. He sneered and said, “Then please open your eyes wide. Soon, Yao Meng’s name will be among the younger generation of the Holy Region!

“Let me tell you, the Yao family will definitely regret this!”

After saying this, Qin Yu pulled Yao Meng away.

A few of them left Yao City and arrived at a nearby city.

They found a restaurant and sat down in the meantime.

Yao Meng was certainly quite excited to see Qin Yu. She looked at Qin Yu and said, “Now that the Yao family is looking for you. Why do you still dare to go to Yao City?”

“Isn’t it because he was looking for you?” Jue Wu said angrily.

“Looking for me?” Yao Meng was stunned, and she did not seem to understand.

Qin Yu said mysteriously, “I want to give you a surprise. As for what surprise, don’t ask. Hurry up and eat.”

Yao Meng was stunned and then looked at Qin Yu. She knew Qin Yu’s character. Since he said that, he must have his reasons.

Thus she nodded and began to focus on eating.

At the dining table, Qin Yu and Jue Wu did not say anything else and just ate quietly.

“Qin Yu, where are you taking me?” Yao Meng couldn’t help but ask. “Why is the Yao family looking for you?”

Qin Yu smiled mysteriously and said half-jokingly, “You’ll know soon. The place I’m taking you to this time will be a turning point in your life.”

Yao Meng’s heart was full of anticipation and doubt. She believed Qin Yu would not take her away from Yao City for no reason. It must be an important reason.

Qin Yu did not waste time. He and Jue Wu again returned to Quiet Wind City and arrived at Li Shen’s residence.

“Where is this place?” Yao Meng asked in confusion.

Qin Yu did not reply. He just brought Yao Meng into the residence.

The three moved forward and soon arrived at a room where they found Li Shen.

“Senior.” After entering, Qin Yu bowed slightly to Li Shen.

As usual, Li Shen sat there slowly sipping his tea.

He looked up at Qin Yu, and his eyes fell on Yao Meng.

“Is she that friend that you mentioned?” Li Shen asked.

Qin Yu quickly nodded and pulled Yao Meng to Li Shen.

“This is the Alchemist Association’s Vice President, Li Shen,” Qin Yu introduced.

Hearing this, Yao Meng was instantly stunned. Then she looked at Qin Yu in shock. The excitement and surprise in her eyes could not be concealed!

Yao Meng had always wanted to visit the Alchemist Association, but she was not qualified to do so.

The Yao family did not want to waste time on her, so Yao Meng could not cultivate.

“Senior, Yao Meng came from the other side of the universe. When she descended into the Holy Region, she was infected with a strange disease and could not cultivate since then,” Qin Yu, sitting opposite Li Shen explained in detail.

Li Shen glanced at Yao Meng and said, “She’s suffering from the ‘Fate-defying Disease’.”

When Yao Meng heard this name, she was shocked. She had never heard of this disease before. She could not help but ask, “What’s the Fate-defying Disease?”

Li Shen took a sip of the tea and calmly explained, “The Fate-defying Disease is a rare disease. It is considered an extremely disadvantageous condition in Daoist cultivation. This disease would cause the true essence in the body to circulate in reverse, unable to smoothly fuse with the power of heaven and earth, and thus lose the ability to cultivate.”

Yao Meng listened carefully, and a complicated feeling rose in her heart. She had long become accustomed to the fact that she could not cultivate. However, she understood her predicament more clearly when she heard this name.

“How did I get this disease?” Yao Meng could not help but ask with a hint of helplessness and confusion.

Li Shen frowned slightly. He took a deep look at Yao Meng and said gravely, “The Fate-defying Disease is not an ordinary disease. It is often caused by the invasion of powerful negative energy. This negative energy usually came from some powerful evil existence or ancient taboo.”

When Yao Meng heard this, she felt a chill in her heart. She recalled the mysterious rune she had encountered and that bottomless dark power.

Before Yao Meng could speak, Qin Yu asked impatiently, “How is it? President Li, do you have a solution?”

“Tsk tsk, why are you more anxious than her?”Jue Wu’s tone carried a hint of jealousy.

President Li took a sip of the tea and said indifferently, “In the Holy Region, there’s no disease that Alchemist Association can’t cure.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu and Yao Meng were overjoyed and tremendously excited!

“Tomorrow, you guys can go to the Alchemist Association with me,” Li Shen said.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu said almost at the same time, “Thank you very much, President Li!”

Li Shen nodded slightly. His eyes fell on Yao Meng, and he said in a serious tone, “However, Yao Meng, you need to understand that the Fate-defying Disease is not easy to treat. Although the Alchemist Association has certain methods and resources, the success rate was not high. You must be mentally prepared.”

Hearing Li Shen’s reminder, Yao Meng bit her lip tightly and nodded with a determined expression, indicating that she was mentally prepared.

After that, Qin Yu bade goodbye to Li Shen and planned to leave.

“Qin Yu, are you really planning not to join the Alchemist Association?” Li Shen suddenly asked at this moment.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Thank you for your kind offer, President Li. I’ll definitely not disappoint you if the opportunity arises in the future.”

Seeing Qin Yu so determined, Li Shen did not say anything else and nodded.

After leaving the residence, Qin Yu and the others temporarily found a place to stay.

In the inn, Yao Meng’s eye expression was complicated. She looked at Qin Yu and opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something. However, after hesitating for a long time, she only said: “Thank you”.
