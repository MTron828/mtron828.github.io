This wasn’t just a feast for the Tianyun sect. It was also a feast for the entire southern region.

Everyone was celebrating, because they saw the hope of resisting the northern lands.

At this moment, Qin Yu was walking aimlessly on the streets.

His mind was filled with the scene of Xiao Sheng and Zhao Jing’s battle.

Today, there were still people who were breaking through. The Sky would explode with light from time to time, mixed with the veteran cultivators who had entered the reversion void stage.

Qin Yu was already somewhat numb to all of this.

According to Xiao Sheng, when the Golden Age arrived, the laws of heaven and earth changed, and a great fortune was born in the world. Everyone’s comprehension of the Dao became much simpler, causing more and more people to ride the wind and break through the waves, taking the opportunity to break through.

Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t be disappointed because of this, but the more he thought about it, the more he couldn’t figure out what the laws of Heaven and earth were, and who was the one who set the so-called great age.

“Sigh.”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

He looked at the distant sky that was emitting a strange sight, and for a moment he was at a loss, not knowing what to do next.

The arrival of the great age had never been aimed at just one place, but the entire universe’s laws of heaven and earth had changed.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of a question.

Could it be that Earth was also welcoming the revival of Spiritual Qi? If that was the case, could the secret of the underwater world still be kept?

The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more curious he became. However, he didn’t have the chance to return to Earth at all.

...

The northern lands.

In the cold wind, every cultivator could sense the changes in the northern lands.

They seemed to smell a trace of spiritual Qi in the cold wind.

Someone with a higher cultivation level had sensed this, so he had long since begun to cultivate in seclusion. Now, he was on the verge of a breakthrough.

That person was none other than the godly king of the northern lands, Sima Bei.

Sima bei sat cross-legged there, and soon, a terrifying phenomenon condensed in the sky!

This phenomenon attracted everyone’s attention, including Yong Ji, he teng, and the others!

“This is a sign of stepping into the reversion void stage.”He Teng narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice.

Yong Ji, who was at the side, frowned and said, “You can’t be thinking of doing something, right?”

He Teng couldn’t help but laugh mockingly at this.

He snorted lightly and said, “Why would I do such a despicable thing?”

Yong Ji didn’t answer, but he scoffed in his heart.

He Teng put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Sima Bei is nothing in my eyes. So what if he has stepped into the reversion void stage?”

Yong Ji naturally did not listen to his bragging, but he was a little jealous.

“Sima Bei is probably the first person in the north to step into the reversion void stage,”Yong Ji said in a low voice.

He Teng seemed to have thought of something at the side. He smiled faintly and said, “Speaking of which, you really have foresight.”

Yong Ji frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

He teng sneered and said, “If you were still in the South Province, your so-called three uniques probably wouldn’t count for anything now, right?”

“As far as I know, there are many people in the south province who have already stepped into the reversion void stage.”

“They may not be a match for the three uniques when they are in the mighty realm. But now that they have stepped into the reversion void stage, what do you think you are?”

Hearing this, Yong Ji’s pupils constricted!

He looked coldly at He Teng and said with a sullen face, “Is what you said true? Someone has already stepped into the reversion void stage?”

“That’s right. And it seems that not long ago, a person at the reversion void stage went to find trouble with Xiao Sheng.”He Teng said with a faint smile.

“Reversion void stage? Find Trouble with Xiao Sheng? Who Was It? What was the result?”Yong Ji asked impatiently.

He Teng put his hands behind his back and sighed, “Speaking of which, this Xiao Sheng is really terrifying. He actually used the mighty realm to kill that return to void.”

“I’m very curious now. Who gave you the confidence back then to make you dare to touch Xiao Sheng?”

After hearing he Teng’s words, Yong Ji’s entire face became extremely ugly.

His body was slightly trembling. He didn’t know whether it was because of Xiao Sheng’s terrifying strength or because of his ignorance in the past.

“How is this possible...”Yong Ji clenched his teeth. He was wide-eyed and incomparably furious!

He Teng said with a strange tone, “It doesn’t matter. Back then, I was the same as you. I was struck by Qin Yu many times. But what can I do? The person who lived to the end must be I, he teng. The one who can walk the righteous path must be i, he teng!”

At this moment, Yong Ji couldn’t listen to this nonsense. All he could think of was to quickly enter seclusion and cultivate.

Right at this moment, the strange phenomenon in the sky disappeared.

A powerful internal Qi rippled from not far away.

This internal Qi was extremely terrifying, something Yong Ji had never seen before!

Under this internal Qi, Yong Ji even felt a trace of inferiority!

“I’ve stepped into the reversion void stage,”he teng said from the side.

Yong Ji muttered in a low voice, “Is this the terrifying internal Qi of the reversion void stage... looks like it’s time for me to go into closed door cultivation...”

...

The southern region was vast and rich in resources. Along with the great changes in the world, many people also rose up with the wind.

The entire southern region became cheerful at this moment, and all kinds of businesses also erupted.

Walking on the streets, one could almost see many treasured herbs and even treasures that had been stored for many years.

Many auctions also welcomed the eruption. The auctions that were usually held only once every few months were now held every day.

Qin Yu walked to the entrance of an auction house and could not help but look over.

“Young Master Qin, do you want to go in and Try Your Luck?”

At the entrance, a lady dressed in muslin clothes said with a slightly flattering tone. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“A few days ago, a peerless divine weapon appeared here. Today, there are even treasures from the Central Plains,”the lady continued to say.

Qin Yu was not too interested and turned around to leave.

At this moment, the girl suddenly said, “Satan, go in and take a look. I heard that there is an auction for items from the ancient underworld today.”

“The ancient underworld?”Qin Yu frowned and immediately stopped in his tracks.

When he was on Earth, Qin Yu had heard countless rumors about Satan.

Before he stepped onto the path of cultivation, Qin Yu naturally did not believe those rumors. However, after experiencing so much, these rumors did not seem to be false.

Especially on Earth, Qin Yu had once forcefully saved old Mister Yan’s life. At that time, Qin Yu had indeed seen two black phantoms trying to take away old Mister Yan’s divine sense.

And today, Xiao Sheng had even asked Qin Yu to help him forcefully pull back Xiao Hai’s divine sense together with him!

This made Qin Yu have no choice but to believe in these myths and legends that once seemed absurd!

“Something from the ancient underworld? How do you know it came from the ancient underworld?”Qin Yu frowned and asked Satan.

The girl smiled and said, “I heard it from others. As for whether it’s something from the ancient underworld, it’s up to you, Young Master Qin, to decide.”

Qin Yu sized her up and said, “Are you lying to me?”

The girl covered her mouth and chuckled, “Young Master Qin, look at what you’re saying. How would I dare to lie to You? Moreover, there are indeed many very mysterious people here today. You might as well go in and take a look.”
