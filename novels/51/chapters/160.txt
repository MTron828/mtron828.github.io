Chapter 161: Conjures Danyun! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Luo Jian’s expression changed, but before he could speak, he was sent flying by Qin Yu’s slap!

Although he didn’t exert much force for this slap, it still caused half of Luo Jian’s face to swell up! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Qin Yu, you actually dare to hit someone in public! I will revoke your qualifications!” Below the stage, Zhou Tong seemed to have seized the opportunity as he quickly stood up and berated loudly!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “Are you blind? Were you mute when he hit me just now?”

Zhou Tong snorted lightly. “Sorry, my eyes weren’t feeling well just now, so I didn’t see it.”

Qin Yu was already used to Zhou Tong’s shamelessness.

He looked coldly at Zhou Tong and was about to speak.

At this time, the crowd below the stage became restless.

“Zhou Tong, do you think the crowd is blind?”

“That’s right. Your disciple hits someone and you pretend not to see it, but when others hit people, you jump out? Such double standards!”

“If you want to disqualify someone, then both of them should be disqualified!”

The crowd was in an uproar below the stage.

Zhou Tong’s expression couldn’t help but change. He had never thought that he would actually cause public outrage!

One had to know that these people usually had something to ask of him, and which one of them wouldn’t suck up to him when they met him?

In the face of everyone’s criticism, Zhou Tong could only clench his teeth and wave his hand. “Forget it, don’t let it happen again!”

The crowd snorted lightly and completely ignored Zhou Tong.

As a person who possessed spiritual fire and had defeated an old Inner Strength Past Master, Qin Yu was far more valuable than Zhou Tong!

These businessmen always sided with those who would benefit them the most.

“Time’s up!” The host slowly walked to the stage.

He looked at the contestants and said, “Please open the lid.”

Luo Jian got up from the ground. He gnashed his teeth and glared at Qin Yu while saying, “You will never win!”

Qin Yu, completely ignoring Luo Jian, didn’t say anything.

Soon, the other three contestants opened the lid and took out the pill.

Although their pill wasn’t bad, it was a pity that they were up against Qin Yu and Luo Jian, so no one paid attention to them.

Everyone’s attention was on Qin Yu and Luo Jian.

Luo Jian narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, watch carefully!”

After saying that, Luo Jian shouted and blew away the lid of the pot!

They saw a red pill lying in the pot.

A rich herbal aroma instantly filled the entire area!

“This... This is the Dragon Phoenix Pill?”

“It’s the Dragon Phoenix Pill. It’s definitely the Dragon Phoenix Pill! Didn’t they say that the recipe for the Dragon Phoenix Pill has already been lost?”

“Rumor has it that the Dragon Phoenix Pill has a miraculous effect and can extend a person’s life for three days! It’s extraordinary!”

“Luo Jian is a genius!”

Extending one’s life for three days! This was definitely a precious sacred item!

One had to know that for a prominent aristocratic family, there was too much to do in three days!

Seeing this, Zhou Tong burst into laughter.

“Qin Yu, I don’t believe that you can come up with a better pill.” Luo Jian sneered repeatedly.

Qin Yu glanced at Luo Jian and nodded slightly. “You’re talented, but it’s just a pity that you acknowledged the wrong person as your mentor.”

“Cut the crap!” Luo Jian said with a cold expression.

“So what if you produce spiritual fire? With my alchemy skills, any aristocratic family will fight for me!”

“Today, you will definitely lose!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His face was calm and no expression could be seen on it.

“Okay, Qin Yu, you’re the only one left.” Zhou Tong stood up and said with his hands behind his back.

Qin Yu glanced at him and nodded. “Okay, then I will let you see what a real pill is!”

After saying that, Qin Yu opened the lid!

Inside the apparatus, there were eight bean-sized pills.

The pills looked ordinary. Not to mention the herbal aroma, but it even reeked of a stench.

The venue instantly fell silent. A moment later, bursts of laughter came from the judges.

“Hahaha! I’m dying of laughter. What is this? A piece of sh * t?”

“D * mn, it took him such a long time to create this?”

“Looks like Qin Yu isn’t skilled enough. What a pity.”

Zhou Tong sneered repeatedly.

“As expected, controlling the blue spiritual fire is extremely difficult. It’s very obvious that he failed.” Zhou Tong placed his hands behind his back and said with a nonchalant smile.

Luo Jian looked at Qin Yu and said mockingly, “I thought it would be some precious pill. Just this? It really makes people laugh their heads off!”

Qin Yu remained silent and was extremely calm.

“Although Qin Yu failed, he has much more potential than Luo Jian.”

“Mm, not bad. If there’s a chance, I must befriend him.”

The crowd below the stage still had high hopes for Qin Yu. After all, the blue spiritual fire was too shocking.

“Qin Yu, you’ve lost. Host, you can announce the results.” Zhou Tong said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

The host nodded and then said, “I now announce that the winner is...”

“Hold on.”

At this moment, Qin Yu finally spoke.

“Do you have anything else to say?” The host asked.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Who said I lost?”

“Qin Yu, the results are already in front of us. Do you still want to play dirty? Let me tell you, the audience isn’t blind!” Zhou Tong said with a sneer.

With one sentence, he pulled the audience into his camp.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was unfazed. He swept his gaze across the crowd and said with a nonchalant smile, “You guys didn’t even look at the pill and made a hasty conclusion. That’s not appropriate.”

“We didn’t even look at the pill? Are you an idiot? Isn’t it right in front of us? What, you’re a sore loser?” Luo Jian said with a cold smile.

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “This is only the appetizer, not the real pill.”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu walked to the front of the pot.

He swept his gaze over everyone and slowly said, “Everyone, please be mentally prepared.”

“Pretending to be mysterious.” Luo Jian snickered endlessly.

Qin Yu ignored him. He raised his hand and slowly reached into the pot.

Qin Yu’s palm moved and swept the eight pills to the side.

Immediately after, one could see that there was actually a purple pill hidden beneath the eight pills!

The pill flickered with a dark gleam in an extremely demonic manner.

“This... what is this? How come I’ve never seen it before?”

“Uh... Even though I’ve never seen it before, I can tell at a glance that it’s remarkable.”

“Indeed, I keep feeling like that pill is filled with mystery.”

Zhou Tong’s expression was somewhat unsightly. He hurriedly stood up and said coldly, “Qin Yu, we’ve never seen this kind of pill before. No one knows its effects, so the champion is still Luo Jian. Is there a problem?”

The others also nodded.

Even though the pill that Qin Yu refined looked extraordinary, everyone knew what the specific effects were.

Qin Yu wasn’t anxious, and he said with a nonchalant smile, “It is rumored that top-grade pills are divided into heaven, earth, black, and yellow. The heaven pill ranks at the top, and the yellow pill ranks at the bottom. However, even the lowest ranking yellow pill can trigger the miraculous Danyun Phenomenon. Therefore, the Danyun is the only criterion for judging top-grade pills.”

“What do you mean? What do you want to say?” Zhou Tong said with a frown.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Everyone, please enjoy the Danyun.”

As soon as he said that, colorful clouds suddenly condensed in the sky!

Danyun took form!
