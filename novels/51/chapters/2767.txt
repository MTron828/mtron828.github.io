The young man was drunk and fell asleep on the ground.

Holy daughter Meng Jing’s strength should be in the Holy Consciousness Realm. Her peak power in God’s Space was even more unfathomable.

Even a holy daughter with such power had been defeated. Who was this guy who stole the power of Saint Kingdom?

Qin Yu walked to a secluded spot on the deck and pondered silently.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but worry about Meng Jing. He had a good impression of this zirl with dual personalities, so he naturallv didn’t want anvthinz to happen to her.

“Young man, the Nine Nether Cliff is not a good place. You must be careful there.”

The boss looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile.

“Yes. Thank you, boss.”

Qin Yu smiled and nodded.

“Boss, why is Nine Nether Cliff so high on the danger ranking?”

A young girl came over and asked.

She had a long ponytail. Although she wasn’t very beautiful, she gave people a comfortable feeling.

“Girl, the Nine Nether Cliff is located at the weakest point of the Saint Kingdom’s defense. Many people from the Saint Kingdom World came here through the Nine Nether Cliff, so it’s filled with many dangerous people.” The boss introduced in detail.

“Moreover, that place is located at the peak of an extremely high mountain. A bottomless abyss is below and it’s filled with demonic beasts that crave flesh and blood. Once one falls, one will definitely die.”

“Then why would anyone go to such a place? This alone shouldn’t rank it at the top of the danger list, right?”

The girl was curious.

“The chaos is the ladder to the top. The Nine Nether Cliff is a Land of Disorder. Only the vicious people or those with strong confidence in themselves dare to go there. Therefore, life-and-death battles are common there. There are countless dangerous races there. They ascend the Nine Nether Cliff with the determination to die.”

“Since it’s so dangerous, why are they going?”

“There are many reasons. Firstly, that place is a land of chaos. This is the design of this Saint Kingdom. There will always be a place for people to vent their violence. The Nine Nether Cliff is such a place. The second is due to Saint Chen Shuang dying and Saint Kingdom’s power being lost. Now, the production of ore has decreased by nearly 30%. You have to know that these ores are distributed in a fixed amount, so it naturally causes a shortage in the cultivation field.”

The boss seemed to be on this route all year round, so he had a deep understanding of the place.

“Fewer resources can only supply fewer experts. According to statistics, the Nine Nether Cliff is the place with the most awakened peak power.” The boss took a deep look at the girl.

Only the truly strong could survive and obtain resources in such a place.

Perhaps this was the reason why Chang Mang had chosen this place.

After the conversation, the spaceship returned to silence.

Qin Yu also walked to a place with few people to meditate quietly.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes as if he had sensed something.

A monk appeared in front of him.

He quietly twirled the prayer beads in his hand. There was a kind of indifference in his pupils that had seen through life and death.

Qin Yu’s hair stood on end. How did this person appear?

He remembered that he had seen everyone when he checked the tickets.

This monk was not among them, but he was in front of him now. “Sir, please don’t be nervous. I’m here to make a deal with you.” He smiled and his voice seemed to contain some kind of magic.

That was a power that could calm people down.

“The Faramita of the Buddhist Kingdom. Are you a monk from the Faramita?”

Qin Yu sensed a familiar internal qi. He sensed the same power when he entered the dream in the Heavenly Sin.

Now that he sensed it again, he immediately recalled it.

“I met you once in the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. I didn’t expect you to remember me.”

“You didn’t die.”

Qin Yu was a little surprised. Heavenly Sin’s power should have killed him at that time.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“As long as the Faramita is not destroyed, the Buddha will not die.”

The monk put his palms together and smiled.

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s body turned cold.

The monk in front of him, including his current actions seemed to have appeared in his sea of consciousness before. It was now perfectly overlapped.

Chen Shuang’s good friend, the old Daoist, had once entered his body. He used the Ethereal Enlightenment to see his tribulation.

He had avoided the first tribulation because of the Ethereal Enlightenment, but the second scene had appeared at this time.

Qin Yu’s body was like a cat with its hair standing on end.

The Night Qi instantly covered his entire body. He did not know where the unknown danger came from.

Was it on the boat, or the monk in front of him, or the future?

“Sir, did you see something?”

The monk said with a smile.

That smile made Qin Yu’s hair stand on end. How did he know?

“I need you to help me deal with a traitor from the Faramita of the Buddhist Kingdom in the Nine Nether Cliff. That person is also an old friend of yours.”

The monk in front of him left behind a baffling sentence.

“Master, who is that person?

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

He only wanted to find Chang Mang and did not want to cause any more trouble.

Moreover, he saw the second tribulation the old Daoist had calculated for him through Ethereal Enlightenment here. He did not want to go against the heavens.

During the first calamity, he also experienced a narrow escape in the land of myriad tombs outside Lingxu City.

If he had not known in advance, he might have died.

Therefore, he felt that the old Daoist’s Ethereal Enlightenment was very reliable.

“Remember, you come by fate, but you leave by fate! There are sacrifices and gains. We won’t know the gains and losses.”

The monk didn’t answer Qin Yu’s question and only left behind a baffling sentence.

“Da*n! Why do Buddhists like to leave half of what they say?”

“Master, explain clearly before you leave!”

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. At this moment, he was covered in cold sweat.

The monk in front of him was long gone.

People were coming and going around as if everything that happened was an illusion.

Could it be that the peak power pulled him into another space?

Qin Yu racked his brains, but he still could not understand how the monk had done it.

Suddenly, his gaze fell on his wrist.

He didn’t know when, but two bracelets had appeared in his hands.

These two strings were not prayer beads. They were white and had irregular shapes.

Qin Yu carefully felt the cold touch inside. It looked like human bones instead.

Qin Yu carefully probed it with his divine sense but he did not discover any energy within.

Qin Yu kneaded it hard as if it was just an ordinary bone.

A layer of bone powder slowly fell from the bone, which shocked Qin Yu. He was afraid that it would damage the bracelet..
