1817 The Si Family’s War Chariot

Soon everyone thought of Si Shiyue. Besides him, this group of people also mentioned a few names.

However, Qin Yu didn’t remember any of these names. All of his attention was on Si Shiyue.

“Will Shi Shiyue come today?”

Qin Yu, who wanted to keep a low profile, couldn’t help but ask.

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, they all turned around and looked at him.

They looked at Qin Yu with curiosity and said, “This brother looks quite unfamiliar.”

“Mmm, I don’t go out much. I also don’t like to be in the limelight,” said Qin Yu, bracing himself.

“Oh! It looks like you’re keeping a low profile,” only then the people around him understood.

“I can’t see through your strength. You look like you’re only at the Mighty Realm.”

“Is there even a need to say it? If you can’t see through him, it can only mean that this young master is extremely powerful. He’s only suppressing his cultivation realm because he’s keeping a low profile.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. This group of people really liked to imagine things.

This was good. This way, he didn’t have to waste time finding excuses.

“Everyone, will Si Shiyue come today?” Qin Yu asked again.

“Of course. It’s a grand event between the Yan family and the Si family. How could he not show up?” someone beside him answered.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Isn’t he in seclusion? Could it be he has already entered the True Saint cultivation realm?”

Hearing this, the few of them couldn’t help but laugh.”Brother, how long has it been since you last came out? The True Saint cultivation realm? My. Si is extremely talented, but it’s not that easy to become a True Saint.”

“That’s right. Even Si Shiyue will take many years to become a True Saint.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

As long as Si Shiyu did not become a True Saint, he still had a chance.

“Will Yan Ruoxue come?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

“Of course. If Miss Yan doesn’t come, I’m afraid Si Shiyue wouldn’t show up either,” the person beside him said.

Qin Yu nodded. He wanted to ask for more information, but he was worried his identity would be exposed. Therefore, he had to hide aside.

The sun gradually rose high in the sky, and the crowd also arrived at the scene one after another.

At this moment, a huge carriage appeared in the sky.

This carriage was extremely imposing. It was like several ferocious beasts pulling a huge palace, and was extremely dazzling to the eyes.

And on the side of the carriage, there was a huge “Yan” character.

When the carriage arrived, Holy Power instantly filled the air.

An old man appeared at the front of the carriage. His expression was dignified and his aura was bold and vigorous. He was clearly an important figure in the Yan family.

“This is a True Saint,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

As expected of the Yan family, the person they sent was a True Saint.

Qin Yu wanted to use his desolate divine eye to probe, but he did not dare to act rashly in front of a True Saint. He could only hide at the side and observe the carriage quietly.

“The Yan family is here.”

“I wonder if the head of the Yan family has arrived.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“The head of the Yan family is a person who can shake the entire Holy Region with a stomp of his foot. Why would he come here personally?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly when he heard the discussion in the surroundings.

This True Saint was actually not the head of the Yan family!

In that case, the head of the Yan family was even more terrifying!

In the carriage.

Yan Ruoxue was wearing a golden crown and a veil covering her face, looking like a fairy from the nine heavens.

She turned to an old man beside her and said, ” “Uncle Yan, can I not show my face?”

“Miss Yan, you can’t do that. You’re representing the Yan family now,” the old man who was addressed as Uncle Yan quickly bowed and said.

Yan Ruoxue sighed. She seemed to be tired of such occasions.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, the carriage arrived at the top of the mountain.

Then, the carriage door opened. Uncle Yan and Yan Ruoxue slowly alighted.

Even though Yan Ruoxue covered her face, Qin Yu could still recognize her at a glance!

She was still so dazzling and charming.

Under everyone’s gaze, Yan Ruoxue appeared extremely gracious. She smiled and greeted everyone one by one before slowly walking forward.

“Miss Yan is here.”

“That’s right. Rumor has it that Miss Yan has the genuine purest bloodline flowing in her body.

“With such a bloodline, I can’t imagine what it will be like in the future.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. From the moment Yan Ruoxue appeared, Qin Yu’s gaze never left her.

Yan Ruoxue, chatting with the crowd, seemed to have sensed a burning gaze on her.

She followed the gaze and looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

Qin Yu quickly turned around. He was afraid that Yan Ruoxue would recognize her.

Qin Yu knew very well that they must not acknowledge each other on such an occasion. Otherwise, it would definitely cause trouble for Yan Ruoxue.

Looking at Qin Yu’s back, Yan Ruoxue’s willowy brows furrowed.

“Miss Yan, what’s wrong?” Uncle Yan, who was beside her, quickly asked.

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and said, “Strange, I somehow feel it’s familiar.”

“Most of the people here today are people you’re familiar with. Thus you don’t have to be surprised,” Uncle Yan said softly.

Yan Ruoxue nodded and did not say anything else.

Qin Yu’s back was facing Yan Ruoxue. His heart filled with mixed feelings.

This feeling of being so close but not daring to recognize her was very uncomfortable. Especially when he thought of Si Shiyue, Qin Yu was even more furious.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in his heart.

He knew very well in his heart that anger without ability was meaningless.

Therefore, Qin Yu used a secret technique to cover his face.

Although Qin Yu’s technique was not brilliant and even a little clumsy, he could still hide his identity.

“Everyone, what’s the theme of today’s event?” Qin Yu went up to the group of young masters and asked softly.

“What else could it be? It’s nothing more than announcing to the world the relationship between the Yan family and Si family,” someone laughed and said.

“You can’t simply say such a thing. If you make the two families unhappy, you won’t be able to bear the consequences,” someone beside him said jokingly.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He looked to the front and saw a group of young men gather around Yan Ruoxue.

The internal qi of these people was extremely terrifying. Even though they had concealed their internal qi, people could still sense the terrifying power in their bodies.

It was obvious that even in such a grand event, there were still differentiation in level.

Compared to Yan Ruoxue and Si Shiyue, the young masters around Qin Yu were obviously one or several levels lower.

“The Si family’s carriage has also arrived.”

At this moment, an extremely huge carriage appeared in the sky.

The carriage looked a little old, but it exuded an internal qi of long years. It was as if it had been passed down for many years.

“It’s actually the Si family’s ancient war chariot. It seems that the Si family values this event very much,” someone beside him sighed with emotion and said.
