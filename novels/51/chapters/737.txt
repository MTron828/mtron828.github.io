Chapter 738: Feeling the Power of the Great Dao! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Two out of ten successes? The success rate was only 20%?

Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache in surprise and said, “Even with a success rate of 20%, he can still be called a Master? Is he worthy of flattery?”

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu and sneered. “Do you think that divining the heavenly secrets is an easy thing? Even the best divination masters only have a success rate of 50%.”

“Moreover, there are very few divination masters. The location of a lot of heavenly materials and earthly treasures were deduced by them.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

In other words, the birth of many heavenly materials and earthly treasures was divined by the divination masters in advance and then spread.

“Has no one improved the ability of divining the heavenly secrets to 100%?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

When the man with the mustache heard this, he couldn’t help but say, “Divining the heavenly secrets is an ability to comprehend the Great Dao. This is an innate ability. It is very difficult to change it after birth.”

When he said this, the man with the mustache paused for a moment and then said with some pride, “Even for me, the success rate of divining the heavenly secrets is only 30%.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but roll his eyes and say, “After talking for so long, you were preparing to boast.”

The man with the mustache chuckled and said, “You can say that, but what I said is true. Divining the heavenly secrets is really a very difficult thing.”

“Many people can’t feel the Great Dao in their lifetime, so they are unable to deduce the heavenly secrets.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but have the intention to give it a try.

He closed his eyes, preparing to feel the Great Dao mentioned by the man with the mustache.

The Great Dao was the law of nature.

Although cultivators were breaking the law, they were always in the Great Dao. No one could jump out.

This kind of law didn’t have a specific shape or state. It was completely an empty existence.

Those who could feel the Great Dao were all heaven’s chosen ones.

Qin Yu closed his eyes. His divine sense seemed to be wandering.

Qin Yu held his breath and focused his attention to resonate with the Great Dao.

“Qin Yu, you already have enough advantages. Want to comprehend the Great Dao? That’s impossible.”

The man with the mustache knocked out Qin Yu’s intention and couldn’t help but laugh at him.

Qin Yu ignored him and continued to resonate with the Great Dao.

A few minutes later, the pitch-black scene in front of Qin Yu suddenly had a fusion!

The line of sight in front of him was like an inner scene, with illusory rays of light appearing one after another.

These rays of light were as fine as threads, drifting with the wind. They looked like dandelions without any pattern, but if one looked carefully, one would discover that all the rays of light were swaying according to a certain pattern.

“This is the Great Dao?” Qin Yu was overjoyed!

Although that was the case, Qin Yu didn’t know how to deduce the heavenly secrets by relying on this Great Dao.

Qin Yu hurriedly opened his eyes, and the scene in front of him returned to normal.

“How was it? You failed, right?” The man with the mustache said proudly.

“Even for me, it took me several months to successfully comprehend the Great Dao, and it was precisely by relying on this Great Dao that I was able to do the archaeology.”

“You want to comprehend the power of the Great Dao? That’s simply impossible!”

Qin Yu ignored the man with the mustache’s incessant chatter and said anxiously, “Quickly tell me, how do you deduce the heavenly secrets by relying on this Great Dao? And how do you find treasures?”

The man with the mustache frowned and said, “Why are you asking this?”

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and immediately told the man with the mustache everything he had observed in the interior.

After hearing that, the man with the mustache couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

“Is what you said true?” The man with the mustache swallowed his saliva.

“I’m not in the mood to joke with you.” Qin Yu said with a frown.

The man with the mustache couldn’t help but swallow hard. Then, he said with some grief and indignation, “It’s not fair! What right do you have to sense the Great Dao within a few minutes!?”

“Alright, stop talking nonsense and tell me quickly,” Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said.

The man with the mustache sighed. Although he was a little unhappy, he still told Qin Yu the method to deduce the heavenly secrets.

“The so-called divination of the heavenly secrets is to find a trace of direction that goes against the law from the Great Dao,” the man with the mustache said.

“All Heavenly Treasures are born outside of the Great Dao. Therefore, once you feel that the Great Dao is abnormal, it means that a treasure has been born.”

“As for how to determine the location, it’s the same method. The position you see from the inner view is the general position of the treasure.”

Qin Yu was confused, but he roughly understood the meaning of the man with the mustache.

He scanned his surroundings and roughly looked at the nearby location.

Then, Qin Yu closed his eyes and tried to find the Great Dao again.

A few minutes later, the inner scene appeared in front of Qin Yu.

The scene in front of him was quite sacred. There were threads of light that were like silk that were moving.

Qin Yu stared at the extremely mysterious light in front of him and tried to find their laws.

Only by finding the laws could he find the heavenly secrets beyond the laws.

Not far away, Chou Heguang was also deducing the heavenly secrets.

His forehead was covered in layers of sweat, and he looked extremely exhausted.

Deducing the heavenly secrets was an extremely taxing task. Even Qin Yu felt a trace of pressure.

Another half an hour passed, and Qin Yu finally found the trace of abnormality in the Great Dao.

This ray of light was extremely manic in the inner scene, like a headless fly.

Not only that, the ray of light became more and more manic, and its movement became more and more irregular.

“It’s him.” Qin Yu locked onto this ray of light.

That manic posture indicated that this ten-thousand-year-old herbs were getting closer and closer to being born!

Qin Yu suddenly trembled. His divine sense seemed to have stepped into the inner scene!

Relying on his powerful divine sense, Qin Yu fused the images in his memory with the images in the inner scene!

Soon, Qin Yu discovered this trace of madness!

This was the heaven’s secret that had been deduced!

Qin Yu opened his eyes with a swoosh, and then swept his gaze toward the southeast.

“The place where the ten-thousand-year-old herbs were born is in the southeast,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At the same time, the man with the mustache opened his eyes.

He stood up and walked in front of Qin Yu, his face showing some admiration.

“I didn’t believe you when you said you had comprehended the Great Dao just now, but I believe you now.” The man with the mustache gave Qin Yu a thumbs up.

“You’re really a genius!”

Qin Yu said with some confusion, “Why do you say that?”

The man with the mustache pointed to the southeast and said, “The direction I guessed is also in the southeast.”

“In only a few minutes, you can sense the Great Dao. Sigh, it’s really unfair.” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but sigh.

At this moment, Chou Heguang, who wasn’t far away, also opened his eyes.

When the crowd saw this, they hurriedly surrounded him.

“Master Chou, how is it? Where will the ten-thousand-year-old herbs be born?” Granny Qin asked impatiently.

Chou Heguang wiped the sweat from his forehead and then pointed to the east and said, “According to my deduction, the ten-thousand-year-old herbs will be born there.”
