Chapter 2720: The Death Punch

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“So it was you who broke the Nineteenth prison!”

When she realized that Qin Yu’s body was completely devoid of any internal qi, she immediately left to search for the Starry Sandworm.

Fortunately, she managed to locate the sandworm with her sharp senses.

Furthermore, the sandworm’s mark suddenly shattered during the battle, causing it to return to its primal state.

Although it was not killed in the end, part of its body was still cut off.

The Starry Sandworm would only act according to its consciousness. It would approach places with strong energy and avoid danger.

For the time being, the Starry Sandworm wouldn’t dare to approach the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

She had also wondered if it was because of Qin Yu. However, she sensed that Qin Yu’s internal qi had completely disappeared when she wanted to leave.

Now that she saw Qin Yu again, she felt a little unreal.

“Oh! I haven’t finished my drumstick yet!”

Meng Jing suddenly remembered something and quickly ran to the side to carefully bite the drumstick in her hand.

“No, what if this brat wakes up and sees me?”

Meng Jing was suddenly stunned, and her oily face froze.

“You must leave my house now!”

Meng Jing pulled Qin Yu hard. Even though Qin Yu was unconscious, he subconsciously twitched a few times.

The blood on his body slowly seeped onto the bedsheet, looking very terrifying.

“Oh no! I forgot that this guy is seriously injured!”

Meng Jing’s face was pale as she ran around the house.

She had never been so close to anyone since she was born in the sea of clouds.

After an unknown period, Qin Yu woke up from his coma again.

His eyes scanned the surroundings warily. The entire room was a pink girl’s room.

The entire environment was emitting a faint floral fragrance. He was a little confused.

He was sure that he had never been here before. However, it seemed that the owner of this place had no ill intentions towards him. Otherwise, he would not have been able to wake up.

Suddenly, half a head popped out from the door. Half of her body was left outside, looking terrified.

“Aren’t you Meng Jing?”

It couldn’t be such a coincidence, right? Qin Yu was shocked.

He randomly chose a coordinate in the passage and ended up arriving at Meng Jing’s house.

For the next three days, they did not communicate further other than Meng Jing throwing bread into the room every day.

“Could it be that this woman is afraid of society?”

Qin Yu was puzzled.

She didn’t seem to be this afraid when she was in the underground mine. “Meng Jing, come in. I have something to ask you.”

The main thing was that this woman’s strength was terrifyingly powerful. He did not dare to be too impudent.

Meng Jing, who had half of her head sticking out, disappeared when she heard Qin Yu’s voice.

Forget it.

Qin Yu’s face was full of black lines. At this moment, the wounds on his body had already recovered.

The second level Milky Way Holy Body seemed to have a strong recovery ability. He remembered that he was on his last breath in the passage.

The fact that he could recover so quickly was probably related to his second level of physique.

Moreover, Qin Yu felt that the strength of his physical body had increased by almost 10% after recovering.

Since he cultivated this holy body, it was difficult to improve even if he absorbed enough Saint Power.

He did not expect that his strength would increase again when he was on the verge of death. Could it be that the Milky Way Holy Body needed such extreme cultivation to improve?

Qin Yu moved his limbs and then jumped off the bed.

This was the first time he had observed the house seriously. There were three wind chimes tied to the small window at the door.

There was a row of cute little dolls by the window.

Many glass bead-like objects were strung together with red strings on the wall. There were about seven or eight of them on each bead.

“I didn’t expect this holy daughter to build such a beautiful house. She’s so

Qin Yu recalled the first time he saw Meng Jing. The way she spoke was so experienced that it was impossible to connect it with this cute little house.

What was this?

Qin Yu casually picked up a string of glass beads and glanced at them.

Suddenly, an indescribable flame burned on his chest. Every glass orb was a recording crystal.

It recorded Meng Jing’s life scenes, some of which were not even suitable to tell.

“I can’t tell this! Why is she so skinny but plump?”

Qin Yu looked at the glass orbs one by one.

He looked at the door guiltily and heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the head did not stick out.

However, Qin Yu did not notice someone a hundred meters away from this house.

Peeping on a Holy Consciousness girl was something that no man could refuse.

A pair of pupils was seeing what was happening in the room. The terrifying killing intent even caused the flowers and trees around him to wither.

After studying it for half an hour in the pleasure of death, it was almost time for Meng Jing to feed the bread. Qin Yu reluctantly put down the glass orb in her hand.

She was adorable, like a kitten.

It would be even better if he could…

It was not that Qin Yu was wretched, but any normal man could not resist such temptation.

He pretended to sleep for another half a day but Meng Jing did not appear today.

“Strange, where did this girl go today?”

Qin Yu was a little curious. He walked out of the house. Not far from here, an internal qi flashed by.

“Is it Meng Jing?

Qin Yu walked towards that place. Meng Jing was a little strange today.

Previously, she would visit him every day. Although she only showed half of her head, she never appeared like today. Could something have happened?

Qin Yu felt uneasy.

He moved his body and instantly appeared in that area.

All of a sudden, a trace of ice crystal landed on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Then, his head, shoulders, and feet were slowly covered by the ice crystals.

It was killing intent.

An indifferent voice sounded behind him.

“Is it nice to see?”

Meng Jing appeared behind him. Her fist was not far from Qin Yu. The energy was concentrated within an inch of her fist. There was no way to escape.

This terrifying energy even attracted the power of thunder in the sky.

A huge lightning bolt fell from the sky and landed in her hand. The light instantly shone on her cold face.

Night!

The veins on Qin Yu’s temples throbbed wildly.

The power of the night that had just been restored surged into the ring, pulling him into the passage.

That feeling of near-death was even more thorough than when facing the Kun Peng Eight Trigrams Formation. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu’s face was deathly pale. This d*mn girl attacked without holding back, wanting to Kill mm.

If he had not escaped into this passageway just now, he would probably have been dead by now..
