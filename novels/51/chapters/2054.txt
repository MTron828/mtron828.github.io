2055 The Magical Bodhi Ancient Tree

Hearing this, Qin Yu stopped in his tracks.

He turned around, looking at Saintess Gu, and said in surprise, “Isn’t the growth of the Bodhi ancient tree very slow? It will take at least a few hundred years, if not a thousand years, to mature right?”

“Normally, that’s the case. However, this is the Cold Moon Palace, and I am the one who cultivates the Bodhi ancient tree.” There was a hint of pride in Saintess Gu’s voice.

Only then did Qin Yu come to his senses. He looked at the gigantic Osmanthus tree and seemed to have guessed something.

“In that case, I’ll have to trouble Saintess Gu to bring me to see the Bodhi ancient tree,” Qin Yu smiled and said.

Then the two walked into the depths of the tree garden.

The tree garden of Cold Moon Palace occupied a vast area, and the pavilions, terraces, and towers were well-arranged. It was like a beautiful painting scroll.

The four seasons here were like spring. The sunlight shone through the morning fog on all the strange trees, making them look even more enchanting.

All kinds of rare trees were planted in the tree garden. There were psychic trees that could help cultivators communicate faster with the spiritual energy between heaven and earth. The Night Flower Tree was full of star-like flowers that emitted a mesmerizing fragrance when they bloomed. There was also the Jadelight Parasol Tree. Its branches and leaves carried immortal dew, which had a magical healing effect.

A strange dark green tree was in the corner of the tree garden. It was called Black Jade Tree. Legend had it that its fruit was the best supplement for cultivating the dao of the Black family.

When night fell, the leaves of the Black Jade Tree would emit a faint jade light like pieces of jade inlaid in the moonlight, appearing tremendously quiet and mysterious.

In the depths of the tree garden, a strange tree in different poses stood tall.

It had a strong trunk and lush green leaves that glowed with golden light under the sun.

The tree trunk was covered with spiritual inscriptions as if it was telling an ancient legend. It was the legendary Bodhi ancient tree. Each of its leaves contained astonishing spiritual power, and its fruit was a divine thing that could help cultivators break through cultivation realms and comprehend dao techniques.

Soon, Qin Yu and Saintess Gu Gu arrived under the Bodhi tree.

At this moment, the Bodhi ancient tree was already as tall as a person. It looked lush and green. In a short period, the Bodhi ancient tree had sprouted under the cultivation of the Cold Moon Palace!

Qin Yu looked at the Bodhi ancient tree in shock that was not concealed!

“This… This… How did you do it?” Qin Yu widened his eyes and looked at Saintess Gu.

“Of course, it’s due to Cold Moon Palace and my unique method,” Saintess Gu said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu was incredibly shocked. Indeed, all these ancient aristocratic families had tremendously unique foundations.

Qin Yu could not wait to walk up to the Bodhi ancient tree. “Please continue, and describe the magical feeling the Bodhi ancient tree gives Qin Yu. This feeling will allow Qin Yu to comprehend the dao technique.”

Standing under the Bodhi ancient tree, Qin Yu felt an indescribable strange power. This power seemed to have been connected to nature’s spiritual energy, making his state of mind tremendously clear. He closed his eyes, and his consciousness began drifting away from reality as if he had entered a mysterious realm.

In this mysterious realm, Qin Yu saw endless stars. They were like huge painting scrolls that painted the mysteries of the vast universe.

He could feel the enormous power contained in the universe. This power surged with life, nurtured all things, and pushed the world to change.

Following the transmission of these voices, Qin Yu’s mind sublimated. He now had a deeper understanding of the dao technique he cultivated.

In this mystical feeling, Qin Yu seemed to have cleared the fog and gained insight into the true essence of the dao technique. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

His state of mind became as calm as water. An unprecedented comprehension sprouted in the depths of his soul, allowing him to have a clearer understanding of the path of cultivation.

Qin Yu stood under the Bodhi ancient tree for a long time. It was as though he had merged with the ancient tree.

At this moment, he felt he was one step closer to the true essence of the dao technique. This feeling made his heart surge with emotions that words could not describe.

Saintess Gu stood quietly at the side, watching the changes in Qin Yu.

She knew that this was the magical aspect of the Bodhi ancient tree. It could guide cultivators to comprehend dao techniques, allowing them to grasp further the true essence of cultivation.

After some time, Qin Yu finally opened his eyes.

However, his divine sense seemed to have been immersed in the Bodhi ancient tree. The shock on his face was even more moving.

“Is this the Bodhi ancient tree? It’s simply too magical,” Qin Yu murmured.

He lowered his head and looked at his hands as if feeling the dao technique he had just comprehended.

“It’s still not a fully grown Bodhi ancient tree. If it’s fully grown, how magical would it be!” Qin Yu could not help but say.

Saintess Gu by the side smiled and said, “Bodhi ancient tree can indeed bring unimaginable effects. However, the effects are different for everyone. It still depends on one’s talent. Mr. Qin’s talent truly surprises me.”

Qin Yu did not refute this. Any treasure that comprehended a dao technique had to be comprehended by oneself, and no one was an exception.

“Let me tell you a secret. Wu Ji has also obtained a Bodhi ancient tree before. Perhaps Mr. Qin will become the next Wu Ji,” Saintess Gu said casually.

“I’m looking forward to seeing how terrifying the Wu Ji that grows in the Golden Age will be.”

Qin Yu did not dare to compare himself to Wu Ji, but he knew everything was possible in this Golden Age.

Wu Ji could sweep through heaven and earth at the Tribulation Stage. No one knew how terrifying he would be after stepping into the Immortal Emperor Stage.

It was also due to this that the chaotic body in this life was particularly eye-catching.

“Thank you very much, Saintess Gu,” Qin Yu bowed to Saintess Gu and said.

“If this Bodhi ancient tree were in my hands, it would have long been snatched away, not to mention growing,” Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said.

Saintess Gu smiled but did not say anything. She did not comment on what Qin Yu said.

After bidding goodbye to Saintess Gu, Qin Yu left Cold Moon Palace.

He had initially planned to visit Yan Ruoxue at the Yan family in case he had a mishap in the Chaos Grave. It could also be considered a farewell.

But now, Qin Yu had changed his mind. Since the nine great aristocratic families would be holding a grand event and he had obtained the important news of the supreme bone, the chances of success in entering the Chaos Grave were much higher now.

After some thought, Qin Yu decided to create for himself a clone to participate in this grand event.

As for himself, he would naturally hide nearby the Chaos Grave. Once his clone received any important news, he would immediately enter the Chaos Grave.

“I think this grand event will attract the majority of the people in the world. By then, there will be very few cultivators at the Chaos Grave. It’s also an opportunity for me,” Qin Yu thought to himself.
