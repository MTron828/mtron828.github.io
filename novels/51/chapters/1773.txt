1774 Demon-Slaying Peak

Dean Lei’s gaze fell on Qin Yu’s body instantly.

“Chaotic body? Dark-bright dual cultivation?” Dean Lei said in a low voice.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

As expected of Dean Lei! He had seen through Qin Yu’s physique at a glance!

!!

“It’s good to see you, Dean Lei.” Qin Yu cupped her hands and said.

Dean Lei then glanced at Jue Wu.

“Nirvana Body?” Dean Lei’s face gradually showed a trace of surprise.

“Xiao Sheng, you’ve indeed brought me two surprises,” he laughed out loud and said.

Hearing these words, Xiao Sheng heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

“Their talents are not inferior to mine,” Xiao Sheng said.

“Not necessarily so.” Dean Lei shook his head slightly.

He slowly stood up and said, “Do you really think that the deciding factor for a person’s talent and cultivation is the physique or the emperor’s blood?”

“Please enlighten me, Dean,” said Xiao Sheng in a deep voice.

“Of course, these are all bonuses. What really determines a person’s success is mentality, ideal, character, and idea,” Dean Lei said calmly.

“Just like you and Xiao Hai. Although you only have ordinary physiques, your talents are rare.”

“Dean Lei, you’re overpraising me,” Xiao Sheng bowed and said.

Dean Lei laughed and said, “I’ll accept both of them. Tell me, which of the main peaks do you want to go to?”

Just as Qin Yu was about to speak, Xiao Sheng beat him to it and said in a deep voice, “Dean Lei, there’s something I have to tell you. Qin Yu’s primordial spirit is damaged, and his strength has been greatly affected.”

“His primordial spirit is damaged?”

Upon hearing this, Dean Lei’s expression turned solemn.

He then shook his head and said, “If the primordial spirit is damaged, it will affect his foundation at the very least. If it’s serious, he might lose his life. Although he has a chaotic body, I’m afraid he is unable to accomplish high achievements in the future.”

Hearing his words, Qin Yu’s heart thumped!

Even Dean Lei had said so. How could Qin Yu not feel sad?

“Xiao Sheng, I can’t ruin Thunder Courtyard’s reputation for your sake,” Dean Lei said in a deep voice.

Xiao Sheng was not in a hurry. He looked at Dean Lei and said in a tone that was neither overbearing nor self-effacing, “Dean Lei, you’ve just said that what determines a person’s achievements has never been physique or bloodline, but the idea, ideal, and faith.”

“That’s right. That’s what I’ve said,” Dean Lei nodded slightly.

“Have you seen anyone who has suffered severe primordial spirit damage as carefree as Qin Yu?” Xiao Sheng continued.

Dean Lei sized Qin Yu up, then shook his head and said, “No, I’ve not. But through special methods, you might be able to move freely. However, that doesn’t mean it won’t affect your foundation.”

“Qin Yu did not use any method to reduce the pain. He is living with the pain. He is enduring the pain to live like a normal person,” said Xiao Sheng in a deep voice.

“His unyielding character alone is worthy of Thunder Courtyard.”

Dean Lei looked at Qin Yu in surprise and said, ” “You… are striving to adapt to the pain?”

“Yes, Dean Lei,” Qin Yu nodded.

Dean Lei was even more shocked. He stroked his white beard and said in surprise, “I’ve indeed never seen anyone who can do it to such an extent… Alright, since that’s the case, Thunder Courtyard will make an exception and accept you. Tell me, which of the main peaks do you want to go to?”

“Demon-slaying Peak,” Qin Yu said without any hesitation.

Dean Lei narrowed his eyes slightly and said in a deep voice, “In your current state, going to the Demon-slaying Peak is courting death.”

“Dean Lei, you just need to give him some time. He’ll definitely stun you. This child’s body contains tremendous power. He will definitely not disappoint you,” Xiao Sheng, who was standing beside him, quickly said.

“He defeated Yuan Xiu of North Plain twice. And the reason his primordial spirit was damaged was that he had to defeat Yuan Xiu.”

“Yuan Xiu?” It was obvious that Dean Lei knew this person.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Xiao Sheng, although I want to agree to your request, you must pass the test to enter the Demon-slaying Peak. This is something inviolable. Even I can’t make an exception.”

Xiao Sheng frowned. He knew that Qin Yu could not pass the test in his current state.

“Dean Lei, please make an exception. As long as you give him some time, he…”

“No.”

Before Xiao Sheng could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Dean Lei with a wave of his hand.

“Thunder Courtyard has been established for a long time, and no rules have been violated. These rules were set by my ancestors, and no one can violate them,” Dean Lei said coldly.

He then looked at Qin Yu and said, “Let’s go to the other main peak. Right now, you might need more rest.”

Xiao Sheng had no other choice. He looked at Qin Yu and was about to say something to persuade him. However, Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I can take the test. If I can’t pass it, I’ll leave Thunder Courtyard on my own accord!”

“Qin Yu, do you know what kind of test Demon-slaying Peak is?” Xiao Sheng’s brows furrowed slightly.

“I don’t know,” Qin Yu said coldly. “But I want to try.”

“Hahaha! Interesting, very interesting!” Dean Lei couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

He looked at Qin Yu with admiration and said, “Although I don’t know why you must go to the Demon-slaying Peak, I like the spirit in you! If that’s the case, you can go to the Demon-slaying Peak directly.”

“Alright,” Qin Yu agreed and said.

He didn’t stay any longer and turned to leave.

Xiao Sheng was silent for a moment, but in the end, he still followed.

After walking out of the first main peak, Xiao Sheng looked at Qin Yu and said, “I’m not sure what this test is, but you can’t pass it in your current state.”

“There’s nothing impossible in this world.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Since I’m already here, I definitely can’t compromise just like this.”

For his primordial spirit to recover as soon as possible, Qin Yu had even accepted Satan. He could not accept it if he were to give up at this juncture.

The three of them rushed all the way to the Demon-slaying Peak.

As soon as they got close to it, Qin Yu felt a terrifying internal qi emanating from the entire main peak.

There were probably many Reversion Void Stage cultivators here.

“Isn’t it Thunder Courtyard never participates in any fights? What is the purpose of the existence of the Demon-slaying Peak then?” Qin Yu looked at Xiao Sheng with a puzzled expression.

“It’s not the same,” Xiao Sheng nodded and said. “Thunder Courtyard indeed won’t participate in any fights, but the people killed by the Demon-slaying Peak are all extremely evil.”

“Not including Yuan Xiu?” Qin Yu was confused.

“No.” Xiao Sheng shook his head.

Qin Yu was shocked.

If even Yuan Xiao wasn’t considered evil, what kind of existence the Demon-slaying Peak was targeting?

Soon the three of them entered the Demon-slaying Peak.

Compared to the other main peaks, the Demon-slaying Peak had the least number of people.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
