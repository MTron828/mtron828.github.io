2230 Testing the Water

At this moment, dozens of powerful divine senses had already locked onto Qin Yu. The demonic beasts in this area seemed to have discovered Qin Yu, this human cultivator.

He quickly approached the blood river, took a medicinal cauldron out, and filled it with blood water.

“You’re courting death! How dare you take the water from our Bone Cultivation River!”

Amidst the loud tiger roar, a black-striped tiger’s body crashed fiercely toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s divine sense shook, and he turned around, striking out with his palm to catch the claw.

“Human cultivator, you are asking for death!”

Xuan Yuan completely transformed into his true body. The enormous turtle was even bigger than a mountain.

“Roar! Gravity force from all directions!”

A deep roar came from Xuan Yuan’s mouth. The space around Qin Yu emitted a sound like glass shattering.

In the space around him, countless tiny lightning bolts appeared and disappeared non-stop.

Qin Yu only felt the surrounding space suddenly compress into a ball, and the gravity was crushing toward him from all four directions, wanting to crush him into a meat patty.

It was the Gravity Rules that Xuan Yuan had comprehended. It was his attack in anger.

Terrifying pressure came from all directions. Even though Qin Yu had used the Saintly Body Technique, he still felt his bones constantly making crisp sounds as if they were about to shatter at any moment.

The spiritual power consumption required to use the Desolate Divine Eye was too terrifying. At this moment, Qin Yu’s spiritual energy was almost depleted.

“Phew!”

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and all his spiritual power surged into the Desolate Divine Eye.

Under the cosmic form, he punched the weak spot where the gravity force intersected and finally broke the gravitational space in all directions.

A giant ape stood on a tree, its slightly blood-red pupils staring at Qin Yu.

It casually chopped off a piece of mountain rock, then grabbed the mountain and leaped a thousand feet. With a single leap, he smashed it down toward Qin Yu.

If Xuan Yuan’s attack method was heavy, then the giant ape was light. Its light speed was not even inferior to the vulture!

“Boom!”

The small half-mountain directly slammed into Qin Yu’s back. Qin Yu only had time at the last moment to prop up his cosmic form and used the locust tree shield to block his back.

The cosmic form directly shattered, and a massive force slammed into the locust tree shield and then ruthlessly slammed into Qin Yu’s back.

Blood and flesh flew everywhere on Qin Yu’s back. There was almost no intact piece of flesh on his back, and his bones were faintly visible.

Qin Yu spat a mouthful of blood. He forcefully suppressed the urge to faint.

His entire body retreated into the entrance of the seventh level of purgatory with the strength of the giant ape’s attack.

After finding a safe place in the sixth level of purgatory, Qin Yu entered the Sumeru Space.

Qin Yu spat a large mouthful of blood. At this moment, he seemed to have become a bloody person.

He sat cross-legged on the ground, took out a handful of pills, and stuffed them into his mouth, slowly healing the terrifying injuries on his body.

Little Fatty and Xiaoru sat near him. They desperately urged their spiritual power and released their vital energy for Qin Yu to absorb.

“This kid is too desperate!”

Elder Guai sighed and said. This was a cultivation method that completely disregarded his life. If his injury were a little more severe, his life would have been in danger.

In the Sumeru ring, due to the presence of Xiaoru and Little Fatty, its space was filled with vital energy that could heal the spiritual soul and restore life.

Under the circulation of the Traceless Immortal Scripture, the vital energy flowed into Qin Yu’s body at a terrifying speed, and his body slowly recovered.

After ten days, Qin Yu finally opened his eyes.

“Big brother, are you alright now?” The two squatted before Qin Yu and stared at him with wide eyes.

“Of course, I’m alright. Big brother is the strongest.”Qin Yu flexed his muscles.

“Thank you.”

Qin Yu bit at each of the two kids’ faces. He tried cultivating and realized a few drops of liquid that gathered an enormous amount of vital energy dripped into his mouth. It was Xiaoru and Little Fatty who bit their fingers and dripped their blood essence onto Qin Yu.

The two kids laughed heartily. Seeing that Qin Yu was fine, they ran to the side and played crazily again.

“Elder Guai, do you know what this is?”

Qin Yu took out the medicinal cauldron a little excitedly. The liquid from the blood river was inside.

“Bone Cultivation River! You went to the seventh level!”

Elder Guai was shocked.

“Yes, my last injury was a sneak attack by a white ape.” Qin Yu was somewhat afraid.

“That white ape is the demon king of the seventh floor! Even Xuan Yuan must listen to his orders!” Elder Guai stared at Qin Yu and continued to explain.

“In the seventh level, there is a river of blood flowing from the depths of purgatory. This river of bones is something all demons dream of. It can temper their bones and refine their flesh, and its enormous demonic qi would allow the demonic beasts to advance directly. Rumor has it that Demon Emperor Qiong Qi had only become the Demon Emperor with the assistance of the blood river.”

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up as he listened. If he could temper himself in the blood river for some time, the terrifying demonic qi would be enough to save him a lot of time, even if he could not refine his bones and flesh.

“The Bone Cultivation River is the holy river of the demon race. The demonic beasts here have powerful cultivation and have long developed their own consciousness. It’s different from the sixth level of purgatory. Once a human cultivator appears in the seventh level, he will be group attacked by the demon beasts.”

Elder Guai seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s thoughts and hurriedly explained it to him.

“It is indeed troublesome. I can still deal with a few demonic beasts in the same realm.” Qin Yu shook his head. Moreover, that tremendously powerful demonic ape was also incredibly difficult to deal with. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu hesitated for a while before placing his hand into the medicinal cauldron.

In an instant, white smoke rose from the contact between his body and the blood water, and a sharp pain surged into Qin Yu’s divine sense.

His flesh and blood began to separate from his bones. A moment later, his bones also gradually began to disintegrate!

Qin Yu’s face was full of shock. He discovered the corrosive power flowed through his meridians and surged into his body.

As the blood essence entered his body, his meridians began to shrink.

“What’s going on?”

Qin Yu did not feel the power of rebirth.

Earlier, in the blood river, the demonic beasts that were soaking in the blood river were damaged, but they had the power of rebirth. The rebirth power allowed them to grow stronger bodies.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu only felt a pure corrosive and destructive power.

“Why? Could it be because he had left the seventh level of purgatory? It doesn’t make sense!”

Qin Yu stared fixedly at the blood water of the Bone Cultivation River. The aura of the blood was already approaching his mind.

His hands shriveled like a hundred-year-old man, and they were covered with wrinkled age spots.

“Qin Yu, quickly pull your hand out. This Bone Cultivation River is only effective against demons! It might be a deadly poison to humans!”

Elder Guai shouted anxiously.

“Demon race! Yes!”

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up. He sent his divine sense into the Breath-Exchange Bead and absorbed the demonic qi into his body.

Demonic qi flowed along the meridians and surged into the palm he extended into the medicinal cauldron. A warm feeling surged into Qin Yu’s hand from the blood river water.
