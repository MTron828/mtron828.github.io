2343 Retreat

However, Ni Wuxiao’s robe fluttered even though without wind, and a vast amount of moonlight energy surged out. The Soul Shattering Golden Radiance shot out, causing violent turbulence, but it failed to break through the moonlight energy.

This Soul Shattering Golden Radiance actually could not do anything for a moment. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Do you think this lousy moonlight can completely protect you?”

Qin Yu said coldly. The spirit bead in his divine sense slowly rotated.

An enormous Soul Shattering Golden Radiance appeared again, and the heavenly might it contained made Ni Wuxiao tremble with fear.

Its power had surpassed the True Saint. How could it appear on a fourth-grade True Saint cultivator?

“Freeze!”

A dark green light suddenly shone toward Qin Yu. In Qin Yu’s divine sense, countless green vines suddenly appeared and bound his two divine sense figurines.

In an instant, his power of the soul suddenly stagnated, and these vines kept squirming in his deep sea.

They actually cut his soul power into countless circles and froze the soul power.

Someone from the Si family brought out another tribulation magical artifact, the Soul-hunting Bead. It suddenly shattered the giant golden sword that Qin Yu had condensed.

“Qin Yu, you’re really in a sorry state! To be honest, I’m a little disappointed by your current state.”

Yao Xi suddenly appeared behind Qin Yu, gathered his strength, and threw a punch.

In an instant, Qin Yu seemed to have seen countless powerful phantoms behind him.

This punch had already communicated with a powerful existence in another space, and they threw the punch at Qin Yu together.

What shocked the people present was that this punch actually carried the power of heavenly might. It had vaguely broken through the power of a True Saint.

“Boom!”

A punch landed directly on Qin Yu’s head and wanted to shatter Qin Yu’s skull.

This punch seemed to have gathered the Yao family’s immortal scripture’s Path of Heaven. It drew in the power of immortals and saints which was much stronger than Si Wuxiao’s Fist of Bright Moon.

However, when this punch landed on the skull, it could not shake the glazed bone at all.

“Haha, your bones are quite hard. Let’s have a taste of my fist again!”

Dozens of Yao family’s seniors revealed their saint forms, and the power of various dimensions gathered on their fists.

A punch landed on Qin Yu’s neck again. He wanted to break Qin Yu’s spine and paralyze him.

“Boom!”

The ground shook violently, and the exquisite tiles of the entire central square instantly turned into dust. The. ground sank 40 to 50 meters.

The shockwave of this punch shook the solid ground into dust right away.

Even if Situ Haoyue used the power of the star, he would still be instantly killed by this strange force.

When the dust settled, Qin Yu’s glazed skeleton did not even have a crack under this attack.

Yao Xi was also tremendously shocked. He punched a few more times. Receiving so many punches in a row, Qin Yu’s Sea of Soul shook crazily.

If it were an ordinary attack, the force would be mitigated by the layers of muscles, meridians, and blood when it entered the sea of skin. Therefore, the threat to the soul would not be that significant.

But Yao Xi’s attack directly reached his sea of consciousness. Although it could not break through his glazed holy bone, the vibration made him tremendously uncomfortable.

“Are you f*cking courting death? Did you ignore my existence?”

Jue Wu was furious. She stepped forward and appeared behind Yao Xi.

She then sent a flying kick down. Under the powerful stomp, Yao Xi’s expression changed drastically.

This kick shattered the Saint behind him directly.

The shadow condensed by this Saint was close to solid, and its strength was comparable to the hardest divine weapon. Even if he used his full strength, he could not break through this phantom.

“Stop!”

Almost simultaneously, two True Saints of the Yao family attacked, afraid that Yao Xi would be injured.

They did not launch a powerful attack but instead used their robust spiritual energy to grapple with Jue Wu, not giving her a chance to attack Yao Xi again.

“D*mn it! It’s as annoying as a housefly!”

Jue Wu said angrily after sending them flying with a punch each.

The people from the Holy Region at this time were all elites from various aristocratic families.

Moreover, after breaking through to the fifth grade, they had been baptized by the Path of Heaven of the Holy Region. The meridians in their bodies were like the deep sea, containing a vast amount of spiritual energy. Therefore, everyone had tremendously dense spiritual energy.

He came directly to Qin Yu’s side and seemed to have an invisibility magical artifact on him.

He pointed at Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness the moment he reappeared.

“Burning Mountains and Boling Seas!”

Qin Yu could only feel his divine sea being placed in a furnace. The terrifying high temperature seemed to evaporate all of his soul power.

It was an ultimate move targeting the soul. Moreover, the person who attacked had tremendously formidable soul power.

In a rush, Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness surged up and protected his divine sense figurine.

After taking this attack, Qin Yu felt a little dizzy, and a vast amount of divine soul power was exhausted.

That person did not rush forward. He retreated with a single move and landed beside Yao Xi.

“Yao Xi, attack Qin Yu’s soul first. He has already cultivated a part of the glazed holy bone. It’s extremely difficult to harm him with spiritual energy.”

“Si Qianjing!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

Before he could take action, a few more people with powerful internal qi fluctuations landed directly. Two magical artifacts emitting destructive internal qi hovered behind them.

Many people from the Holy Region had already received the news and rushed to the central square.

“Jue Wu, leave this place first.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed. A familiar internal qi was approaching. Moreover, that internal qi was like the rising sun, invincible.

Jue Wu let out a furious roar, and her arm suddenly turned red.

She then punched on the ground fiercely, and countless flames erupted from the ground.

The entire central square turned into a world of flames, and countless flames rained down from the sky.

“This flame contains the power of the Vermilion Bird and can’t be extinguished. It can also burn our true energy!”

Someone roared angrily, realizing something was not right.

“Dodge! Use your magical artifact if need be!”

Si Qianjing roared and said.

Taking the opportunity of this moment, Qin Yu and Jue Wu had already fled.

“Qin Yu, where are we going?”

Jue Wu and Qin Yu had already left Solitary Cloud City at this moment. Qin Yu’s current condition was tremendously bad.

The continuous battles had already exhausted a vast amount of his soul power. Moreover, his body had shattered again, and he simply could not unleash his strength.

“The ninth level of purgatory!”

“Qin Yu, go to the Azure Ridge Continent. There is a rest place for our Ji family there. Moreover, I can solve your problem now.”

Ji Yue’s anxious voice came from the Sumeru ring.

Qin Yu frowned and was about to say something when his expression suddenly turned extremely ugly.

Unknowingly, a young man with a slender figure and a refined appearance suddenly appeared before them.

Moreover, Qin Yu did not notice when he appeared. He was the person that Qin Yu had wanted to avoid previously.
