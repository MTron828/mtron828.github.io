Chapter 1348: Chapter 1,348, acknowledging a master 

Qin Yu was stunned. Qin Yu was not used to Wen Wanyun’s sudden seriousness.

He coughed and said, “Senior, are you... Serious?”

Wen Wanyun put his hands behind his back and said with a serious expression, “I, Wen wanyun, never joke.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and did not know how to answer.

Although Wen Wenzi was full of swear words, his personality was quite similar to that of Wen Da and Wen Er.

Moreover, with his cultivation, he was one of the top people in the entire South Province. It was indeed a good choice to have him as a master.

When Wen Wenzi saw that Qin Yu didn’t speak, he thought that Qin Yu was a little worried.

He explained, “You have also seen our Wen family. Right now, only Wen Da and Wen Er are left. However, the two of them are unwilling to cultivate, and their talent isn’t good either. Moreover, you should also be clear about their personalities. They are naturally good at provoking others.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu seemed to have understood something.

“It’s fine if I’m alive now. No one dares to offend them, but what if I Die?”Wen wanye said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Senior, my words may not sound very pleasant, but... your worry doesn’t seem to be necessary.”

“With your strength and talent, I’m afraid that your lifespan will be longer than Wen Da and Wen Er’s...”

Wen Da Wen Er’s realm was extremely low, so his lifespan naturally couldn’t be compared to that of a top expert like Wen Wan something.

Wen Wan something sighed and said, “Under normal circumstances, that is indeed the case, but I have a feeling that one day I will die in battle.”

“Moreover, the huge Wen family does indeed need someone to inherit it. I don’t wish for the Wen family to end in my generation.”

“I have always hoped that they can find a girl from a large aristocratic family and give birth to an outstanding descendant.”

Qin Yu remained silent. This kind of thought was indeed understandable.

No one would want their family to continue declining, especially a top expert like Wen Wanyi.

To be able to cultivate to such a realm was no longer something that could be accomplished through hard work. It was more dependent on one’s talent.

It was unknown how many people were stuck at a certain realm for an entire lifetime.

“Alright, I’m Willing.”Qin Yu didn’t think about it anymore. To him, this matter was more beneficial than harmful.

Moreover, if he could help them, Qin Yu was also very willing, so he had no reason to refuse.

Wen Wanli nodded and said, “Alright, from today onwards, I will teach you the Ultimate Arts of My Wen family, as well as the treasures I collect.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Senior Wen, in my opinion, the most important thing now is to find the Qi of life. Otherwise, I won’t be able to cultivate at all.”

Wen Wanyi was silent for a moment before he agreed, “Alright, there will be a myriad sect gathering in da Yue in a few days. At that time, I will think of a way to find this item for you.”

“Thank you, senior! Oh, NO, master!”Qin Yu cupped his hands.

After they finished chatting, Wen Wanyi didn’t say anything more.

He didn’t have too many requests for Qin Yu. As long as he got a promise from Qin Yu, it would be enough.

After returning, Wen Da and Wen Er hurriedly came over.

The two of them pulled qin yu and whispered, “What did my grandfather say to you?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “He wants me to be his disciple.”

Wen Da was stunned and hurriedly said, “Be his disciple? Qin Yu, you won’t agree to it, right?”

“Yeah, I agreed. What’s the matter?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

When Wen da heard this, he couldn’t help but give Qin Yu a thumbs up.

“Brother, I admire you. You Don’t know how painful it is to be my grandfather’s disciple. What you did was not human affairs!”Wen Da said with a sorrowful face.

“That’s right, that’s right. In the past, there were many people who came to be my grandfather’s disciple after hearing the news. In the end, they all ran away.”Wen Er also nodded and said.

Qin Yu was not worried about this problem. He had come from nothing and had experienced countless torments. All the pain was nothing to him.

Moreover, the current Qin Yu was unable to cultivate at all. Even Wen Wanji could not do anything to him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

What he could do was to find the life force for Qin Yu as soon as possible.

“Brother, take care!”Wen Dawen er looked at Qin Yu with a pitiful expression.

Qin Yu smiled but didn’t say anything. With Wen Wanji’s help, it would be much easier to find the life force.

On the other side.

Old Wang had already rushed back to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

He knelt in front of the first elder and told him what had happened.

“Wen Wanli? Why would he care about this?”The Great Elder said with a dark face.

Old Wang smiled bitterly and said, “It’s all because of his two grandsons. I don’t know what kind of Luck Qin Yu had to become friends with the Wen Brothers...”

The Great Elder’s face was cold and he didn’t say anything for a long time.

“This Wen Wanli thinks too highly of himself.”The Great Elder’s face was dark. “Give him some face. Do you really think our Heavenly Cloud Sect is afraid of Him?”

Old Wang quickly nodded. “That’s right. No matter how strong he is, he is just one person. How can he be compared to Our Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

The great elder said coldly, “Qin Yu killed Ling Yun. This revenge must be avenged. Otherwise, where will our Heavenly Cloud Sect’s face go? Even if he, Wen Wanji, appears, he can forget about stopping this matter!”

Old Wang quickly said, “Great Elder, you should report this matter to the sect master.”
