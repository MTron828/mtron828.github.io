Chapter 2544 Killing Flame Demon

The lava that had lost its heat turned into cold rocks, and with a gentle breeze, it instantly turned into fine sand floating in the air.

With a strike, the lava on the ground was completely destroyed.

“He could actually unleash such power! This Flame Demon has been roaming for five Path of Heaven years, and who knows how many hundreds of millions of human race vengeful souls he has in his hands. We have the opportunity to destroy him completely today! Shen Qian, use the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror to help me set up the seal!”

Xuan Tian was overjoyed and shouted.

Heavenly Monster Imprisonment!

It was a powerful sealing technique passed down from the Three Purities Sect!

Countless complex symbols drifted out from Xuan Xin’s sea of consciousness.

Whenever a symbol appeared, a deep divine voice appeared in the void, solemn and majestic, spreading throughout the entire Misty Forest. A surge of formidable sealing power landed beside Flame Demon, completely blocking its connection with the outside world.

As the sealing runes rapidly spread, they completely enveloped the Flame Demon.

The power of the runes was like an unbreakable shackle that completely severed Flame Demon’s claw of the soul.

After setting up the seal, silence, and tranquility suffused the sealed area. The power of the seal controlled everything. No target could escape or resist. The seal’s power was so potent that it could allow the utmost powerful cultivators to fight against any powerful existence, completely suppressing their power.

“Lock!”

Shen Qian reproached lightly. The Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror floated up and landed on Flame Demon.

A ray of treasure light shone down, and with the sealing runes of the Heavenly Monster Imprisonment, it completely sealed Flame Demon, making the entire seal even more condensed and stable.

A green light flashed.

Xuan Xin appeared beside the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror. He crossed his arms on his chest and stared coldly at Death Godly King of Death and Titan.

At this moment, Flame Demon let out a desperate roar as if its connection with the underground fire elemental energy had disappeared totally.

At this moment, countless volcanoes outside Misty Forest suddenly fluctuated violently.

Terrifying lava erupted from countless planes.

The lava seemed to have sensed something. It was as if a trace of the origin it was connected to had suddenly disappeared.

“Could it be that something has happened to Flame Demon?”

In the Solitary Shadow Continent at this moment, Asura Godly King looked at the countless volcanoes erupting out of nowhere and suddenly had a bad feeling.

“Even I couldn’t kill that fellow. What could happen to it?”

He Teng laughed and said.

“It’s good that this fellow is dead. The Path of Heaven values this fellow and it receives enormous benefits from each sacrifice.

“Flame Demon has killed countless human race living beings over the years. Numerous experts have attempted to kill it, but none have succeeded. It has also dispersed many of our race’s lethal strategies. Flame Demon undoubtedly is the primary force in this upcoming major battle.”

Xiang Yu stared at He Teng coldly.

“I’m just speaking my mind, venting a bit.”

Facing the dominant Xiang Yu, He Teng could only shrink back and explain.

Qin Yu walked up to the fire of Flame Demon’s true body and stared at him indifferently.

Flame Demon screamed shrilly.

His immense vitality was built on the lava. As long as there was lava, his true body could absorb boundless and endless life force. With this strength, he would be afraid as long as a Saint did not make a move.

Despite Qin Yu’s potent attack, it did not despair, although it was a little flustered.

Even if its main body was scattered, it could still absorb the power of fire from countless planes and slowly recover after a long time.

However, it did not expect its connection to be completely severed at this moment, which meant it would die completely.

“Phew!”

Qin Yu blew gently, completely extinguishing the flame.

A bronze triangular crown fell onto the ground, and there was no scorching heat when Qin Yu picked it up; instead, a cool sensation tingled against his skin.

“Boom!”

In the sky, countless bolts of lightning flashed.

Drops of rain fell, and the smell of blood assaulted everyone’s nostrils.

Rain of blood began to fall in Misty Forest, and the entire monster race territory was as if wailing about the death of Flame Demon.

There was a saying among the human race that heaven and earth were sad when a saint died.

It was the same for the monster race. After Flame Demon died, even the monster race’s Path of Heaven rained blood. This was enough to show the importance of Flame Demon to the monster race. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Death Godly King and Titan, who were madly attacking, looked at the falling blood rain.

They seemed to be in disbelief, and Death Godly King even let out a mournful roar.

“Human race, none of you can leave this forest!”

He grabbed Titan and instantly disappeared into the void, escaping.

Flame Demon had died, and they did not have to continue fighting.

In the Solitary Shadow Continent, the five Godly Kings and many higher-ups of the monster race fell into a deathly silence as they watched the rain of blood.

“Why are you guys looking at me? I was merely saying it casually. Who would have thought that this guy had really died?”

He Teng was panicked when he saw everyone silently staring at him.

“Hahaha, good job, my friend Qin Yu! After the war has begun, this is the first time our human race has achieved such a tremendous victory. Flame Demon is an ancient living being extremely difficult to kill. The Saints are restraining each other and thus can’t attack. The sect masters probably won’t believe we’ve killed Flame Demon this time.”

Xuan Xin laughed heartily. At this moment, he truly felt great and no longer cared if he would attract the attention of the living beings in the dark.

“Is it really that great?”

Seeing Xuan Xin laughing frantically, Qin Yu was speechless.

“In the past great wars, Flame Demond split into countless Chief of Flame to fight the human race army. Provided the underground magma doesn’t extinguish, it will have an endless energy supply. Even if the flame spirit dies, it can continue to split. Every year, countless human race experts attempt to kill it but have never succeeded and have lost their lives. This Flame Demon could be said to be the most troublesome monster race living being for the human race. If the higher-ups get to know the battle achievement this time, it’s not too much, even if the reward is a celestial artifact!”

Shen Qian said with a smile. She was involved in the matter, and at this moment, she also felt somewhat incredulous.

“Hahaha, Heavenly Divination Sect’s Heavenly Talisman cultivator Zhang Xiang, Qin Yu, and the others killed Flame Demon King. Even in the next Path of Heaven Year, it will still be an interesting anecdote! Hahaha! When we return, we must find a few storytellers to spread the news!”

Zhang Xiang touched his bald chin and said shamelessly.

“Bullsh*t!”

Shen Rou could not stand it and kicked his buttock.

“Nevertheless, thanks to everyone’s effort. If it wasn’t for the timely sealing of the soul power, I’m afraid we would not have killed it.”

The last moment of coordination was almost in an instant.

The two parties did not interact at all before they killed Flame Demon.
