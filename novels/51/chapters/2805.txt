Chapter 2806: The Fourth Saint-Level Expert

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Situ Qianxun’s expression was indifferent. He only had two choices nowOffense and defense.

The full power of the three Holy Lords had destroyed the defense line built by the Situ family.

However, being able to withstand this attack and remain unscathed was enough to make the Situ family look down on the rest of the people.

One had to know that an attack that used up all the power of Saint Kingdom might have gathered the energy of thousands of years.

When this energy was poured out, it was a terrifying explosion.

Moreover, the three Holy Lords had already used all their strength in their attacks just now.

After the attack of the power of Saint Kingdom, the light of the three Saint Kingdoms had dimmed significantly.

The Situ family used the Divine Sun Tree as their base and all the defensive talismans as their power.

They had negated the power of the three Holy Lords. Each of these talismans had the power of a level 12 peak power.

Nearly 1,000 talismans vanished into thin air.

Even the old Daoist felt his hair stand on end when he saw this pure energy confrontation.

He directly pulled the little girl away from this troublesome place.

After the three Holy Lords attacked with all their might, it was the Situ family’s turn to counterattack.

The Divine Sun Tree released all its power. The roots of the Divine Sun Tree pierced deep into the space that the Situ family had opened up to store Saint Power.

The entire Divine Sun Tree emitted a light that made people unable to look straight at it. Then, the ten Golden Crow fruits fell.

They continuously attacked Lucifer, leaving the Fallen Angel’s mouth with an unpleasant trail of blood.

He didn’t know when, but there was a blonde girl of six or seven years old sitting on his shoulder.

The little girl’s eyes were dark. She hugged Lucifer tightly as if she was playing with him.

With the appearance of this little girl, the entire Treasure Continent underwent a strange change. It felt like the air was filled with a different smell.

Whether it was the abundant Saint Power, the gravity deep underground, or perhaps the moisture in the air everything that existed at all times had undergone a substantial change.

It was not an illusion, but a real change.

“Are the rumors about the change of the entire continent true? He could create a new world, but he was alerted by the Path of Heaven when he was born. Therefore, his power was divided into two halves. The other half was sealed in his body. Only when the two powers were combined would he be in his strongest state. And in the long legends, this position is not an honor for

Lucifer, but a shackle that prevents him from entering the God Slaying Realm!”

Ye Kai stared at Lucifer and said.

“The Treasure Continent and the world created by Lucifer are fighting.

Everyone, get ready!”

A surge of power erupted between the Golden Crow and Lucifer. The power of

the other world instantly descended.

In an instant, the Treasure Continent was completely shattered.

The originally beautiful scenery was gone. The acid-like rain fell.

Every drop of acid rain that fell would corrode a large pothole.

The air was filled with the smell of sulfur.

Even the monster race that lived in the harshest environment could not survive this kind of death qi.

The pressure that was like a pressure cooker fell on everyone’s body. The Treasure Continent let out a deep cry and countless cracks extended on the ground.

This was Lucifer’s world, the foreign world he had created.

The ten rays of Golden Crow power were slowly extinguished under the impact of this world power.

The power of the world spread to the entire divine tree. Its skin began to dry up and crack.

Lucifer’s attack destroyed the Sun Divine Tree that supported the Treasure Continent.

Lucifer’s face was unusually pale as if this attack was not easy for him.

With the collapse of the divine tree, almost everyone in the Situ family was filled with despair.

The roots deeply rooted in the spatial plane had lost the power of the divine tree.

The Treasure Continent completely collapsed. Countless weak creatures on the continent died.

In front of this kind of Holy Lord-level power, even a level 9 Dao Consciousness was as weak as an ant.

Situ Qianxun stood in the void and looked at the Treasure Continent that had completely collapsed.

His expression was very calm. More than ten people were standing behind him.

“Everyone, the siege of the three Holy Lords is a spectacular scene. You are just the guest elders of my Situ family. The agreement between you and me can no longer be counted. You can leave on your own!”

Situ Qianxun laughed loudly. An aura that looked down on the world emanated from his body.

He showed no signs of fear facing the attacks of the three Holy Lords.

Everyone knew that he was the patriarch of the Situ family, the wealthiest family.

However, no one Imew that he also had top-notch talent and was an existence that was not inferior to anyone in that era.

Not only did he not retreat facing the force of the impact, but he also charged at the two of them simultaneously.

“Eye of Destruction! Shimoji!” “Shadowless Divine Hand! Jue Chen!”

He roared angrily.

His finger pierced through the sky and headed toward the two of them.

Ye Kai also laughed lightly.

He was like a lonely boat, holding an ordinary saber.

He joined this top-notch battle just like that. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After ten days and ten nights, the battle slowly came to an end.

The entire Treasure Continent had already turned into ruins.

Not a single blade of grass grew. It had completely become a land of death.

Powerful energy was contained within it and it would erupt at any moment.

Even a Holy Consciousness expert didn’t dare to get involved.

Even a Holy Lord would not be able to guarantee his safety with this power.

As for the Situ family, they had completely disappeared from the records of history from that day onwards.

However, the Situ Family’s reputation would be passed down forever after this battle.

They had managed to heavily injure the three Holy Lords who had used all their strength and forced them to retreat.

If it wasn’t for the appearance of the fourth Holy Lord, it would be difficult to predict the outcome of this battle.

Qian Xun, the patriarch of the Situ family; Ye Kai, the Sword Saint; Doctor Lu with his Eight Fatal Needles; and Xiaobai, the nine-tailed fox died in this battle.

In the distant space, Qin Yu was in the Investiture of Gods.

He didn’t know why, but he felt his heart palpitate for no reason. This was the first time he had such a feeling since he came here.

Could it be that something had happened to the Investiture of Gods? What was wrong with the Investiture of Gods?

This was the first time Qin Yu felt such a change in the Investiture of Gods. It made him a little flustered.

There was a sudden warmth in his hand.

It was a burning flame.

A tattered piece of paper appeared in his hand.

Investiture of Gods?

Qin Yu’s body trembled. Smoker Xie, who was opposite him, even fell to the ground
