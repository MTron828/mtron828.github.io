Chapter 1029: Chapter 1,029, Wan family’s secret technique! 

Just based on his own aura, he had shaken off the killing techniques of the five martial saints?

This... wasn’t this a little too exaggerated?

“How could this be?”A trace of fear appeared on Wan Zhengye’s Stern Face.

The few protectors felt extremely uneasy.

Qin Yu stood not far away and looked at these people coldly.

He narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly, “The Wan family’s secret realm is too weak. However, the five early stage martial saints have disappointed me.”

These words were undoubtedly humiliating the WAN family!

The previously incomparably arrogant Wan family had now fallen into such a situation.

Everything had happened too quickly. It was so fast that it was unbelievable!

“Don’t be too arrogant!”Wan Zhengye shouted loudly.

He stretched out his hand, and a white lotus flower floated towards Qin Yu.

This lotus flower was not just a technique, it contained a destructive power! It seemed to be an internal Qi!

Qin Yu’s expression did not change. His feet shook slightly, and a golden internal Qi quickly spread out!

This internal Qi wrapped around Qin Yu and moved with his mind!

Not far away, the pavilion master could not help but be stunned.

Wasn’t this his own technique? When did Qin Yu learn it?

Wan Zhengye’s Lotus Flower continued to float towards Qin Yu. With a thought, two large golden hands hung behind Qin Yu’s back!

The large hands reached out and forcefully held the many lotus flowers between his palms!

“Pu!”

The lotus flower exploded in the center of the two golden palms.

The Lotus Flower, which originally had destructive power, made a funny sound like someone farting!

“This...”Wan Zhengye rubbed his eyes hard as if he couldn’t believe the scene in front of him!

“Do you have any other moves? If not, you can die,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Before they could answer, the two big hands behind Qin Yu had already reached out!

An overwhelming pressure instantly spread out!

The power contained in the two big hands was too powerful. Even if the five people tried their best to resist, they would still be smashed into pieces!

As Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, the power of the big hands suddenly soared!

“Bang!”

“Bang!”

“Bang!”

“Bang!”

Four separate palms struck the bodies of the four protectors from top to bottom!

These four martial saints were instantly smashed into meat paste!

Their lives and divine sense were smashed into pieces under this palm!

In the blink of an eye, four martial saints had died from the cultivation technique!

Most importantly, Qin Yu stood there without moving at all!

The many martial artists who were hiding in the distance and watching all sucked in a breath of cold air.

Qin Yu’s strength had clearly exceeded their imagination!

These four martial saints had died like clowns in front of him!

“Dad, what... What should we do now...”Wan Gu Qiong said with some panic.

Wan Zhengye did not say a word. His face was gloomy and uncertain.

“Bring Out Your Wan family’s foundation. Otherwise, there will be no chance,”Qin Yu said coldly.

As a secret realm that had existed for many years, it naturally had its own trump cards.

Wan Zhengye took a deep breath and said, “You’ve already killed four of my martial saints. Even if you want to vent, you should have done so! Do you really have to kill them all?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “If you had begged for mercy earlier, I would only have killed you and the Wan Gu Qiong. However, you’ve missed the opportunity.”

“So... not a single member of the Wan family is left alive.”

“Good, good! This arrogant brat is going too far! I’ll let you witness the secret technique of my Wan Family!”

With that, Wan Zhengye waved his hand, and a pitch-black oil lamp fell into his hand.

He activated his spiritual power and ignited the flame, igniting the oil lamp.

Black energy began to spread in all directions.

And Wisps of Wan Zhengye’s Divine Sense were drawn out!

Not long after, a huge ghost image condensed on the oil lamp!

It was clearly in the form of an evil ghost, but it contained an indestructible divine might that made people unable to resist worshipping it!

“What... What’s going on? My legs seem to be out of control!”

“I don’t want to kneel...”

Countless people’s legs went limp as they knelt on the ground.

“What Bullsh * T.”Qin Yu snorted coldly. He waved his hand, and a golden light flashed through the air.

The divine might that lingered in everyone’s hearts instantly disappeared.

The ghost statue not far away was still suspended above the oil lamp.

And Wan Zhengye’s Divine Sense seemed to want to merge with this ghost statue!

“This spell seems somewhat familiar. I remember that its power isn’t that great,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“HMM? No, it seems different. This ghost statue seems to be summoning something.”

Just as Qin Yu guessed, the ghost statue opened its mouth and let out a whimpering sound!

Wan Zhengye said coldly, “Qin Yu, this is an internal Qi artifact passed down from my ancestors. It has the aura of a true God!”

“And the ghost statue behind me is from the nine serenities hell! It contains the true power of a God!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “Does the nine serenities hell really exist? I always thought it was fake.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, on second thought, it made sense. If there was no nine serenities hell, where did the divine sense go?

“Wu Wu...”

The Wu Wu sounds became louder and louder, and the Wan family’s secret realm began to show strange phenomena.

Dark clouds blotted out the sky and the Sun, and the whole world seemed to fall into darkness.

One after another, oil lamps floated up in all directions, bringing with them faint rays of light!

The entire Wan family’s secret realm was like a real hell!

Rumble..

In the next second, the Earth began to sink, and the sky began to collapse, as if the entire secret realm had fallen into hell!
