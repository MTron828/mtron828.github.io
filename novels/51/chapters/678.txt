Chapter 679: The Man with the Mustache’s Scheme Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After swallowing these three Golden Cores, Qin Yu felt that he could step into the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis Realm at any time.

He looked around and said in a low voice, “It has been a month. It’s time to go back.”

Qin Yu and the man with the mustache had an agreement to meet at the Green Moon Villa in a month.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. He released his spiritual sense to find the direction and walked out of the desert step by step.

This desert was extremely large, and it was also very far from this city.

It took Qin Yu three days to finally walk out of this desert.

Then, Qin Yu came to a nearby airport and rushed toward this city.

Qin Yu disappeared for an entire month. Other than the three purple-robed men from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, the rest of the people who came to kill Qin Yu had already left.

They had even lost the patience to wait for Qin Yu.

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Qu Xie looked at Han Xiu and laughed. “Mr. Han, there’s no need for you to personally take action on such a small matter. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has already sent three purple-robed men to kill him. I think that Qin Yu is already dead.”

Han Xiu’s status in the Han family was extremely high, far above Han Meng’s.

This also caused Han Xiu’s tone to be very different from when he was facing Han Meng.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has already sent several groups of people. Every time, they say that Qin Yu is bound to die. What was the result?” Han Xiu sneered.

“How ridiculous. Everyone says that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has many talented people, but in the end, they can’t even kill Qin Yu.”

Qu Xie said with slight embarrassment, “That was just an accident.”

Han Xiu stood up and stretched. “President Qu, all the big families want Qin Yu to die. You should know that.”

Qu Xie nodded. “I know. So does the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Han Xiu spread his hands and said, “Okay. I’ll wait for your message.”

After Han Xiu left, Qu Xie’s expression darkened.

He looked coldly at his assistant and said, “It’s been a month. Why is there still no news?”

The assistant shook his head and said, “I’m not sure. I tried to contact the three purple-robed men, but there was no news.”

This made Qu Xie have a bad premonition.

The three purple-robed men were already the top forces of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

If even they couldn’t kill Qin Yu, then they might really have to use their ultimate weapons.

“President Qu, we just received news that Qin Yu has returned to the Green Moon Villa.”

At this moment, someone walked in from outside. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qu Xie’s expression darkened, and he couldn’t help but clench his fists.

“Qin Yu...” Qu Xie’s face was cold and full of killing intent.

His assistant frowned. “Could it be that the three purple-robed men are already dead?”

Qu Xie shook his head. “I don’t know, but since he’s back, nothing good must have happened.”

At this point, he looked at his assistant and said in a cold voice, “Suppress the news first. Tell them that the three purple-robed men didn’t find Qin Yu and are now back.”

“Even if the three purple-robed men are really dead, we can’t let the news spread!”

The assistant nodded and said, “Yes.”

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association had always been the overlord of the martial arts world, and the purple-robed men had terrified the entire martial arts world.

If the world knew that Qin Yu had killed three purple-robed men, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s status would definitely plummet.

The deterrence that they had worked so hard to maintain for so many years would also disappear.

...

Within the Green Moon Villa.

Qin Yu was sitting in the main hall. He looked at Zhen Yue and asked, “Has no one come to find me these few days?”

Zhen Yue said, “Yes. Almost every day, someone comes to ask if you are here.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Zhen Yue was obviously not talking about the man with the mustache, because the characteristics of the man with the mustache were too obvious.

“It has been more than a month, but the man with the mustache hasn’t come yet. Did he run away with the fire bead?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu had always been wary of the man with the mustache.

This person seemed crazy, but he was actually very scheming. Even Qin Yu couldn’t see through him.

“Forget it. I’ll wait for him for a few more days,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

And during these three days, the man with the mustache still hadn’t appeared.

This made Qin Yu lose his patience. He thought for a moment and then said, “Forget it. I’ll go into seclusion and try to break through to the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm first.”

With Qin Yu’s current physical body, if he stepped into the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm, he would have no fear of the purple-robed men. He could even fight someone at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!

That night, just as Qin Yu was about to go into seclusion, a wretched figure appeared beside Qin Yu.

He smiled and said, “I’m sorry. There was a traffic jam on the road and I was a few days late.”

Qin Yu opened his eyes. He glared at the man with the mustache and said, “What kind of traffic jam can jam you for a few days?!”

The man with the mustache smiled and said, “I thought you were dead. I didn’t expect you to be so lucky.”

At this point, the man with the mustache looked Qin Yu up and down and then said in surprise, “You succeeded?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Yes, it’s just as I expected. The true fire can be used to temper one’s body.”

This shock the man with the mustache. He muttered softly, “The chaotic body is really a magical constitution...”

Following that, the man with the mustache pulled Qin Yu and said, “Alright, don’t waste time. I’ve already prepared the materials. Let’s go.”

Qin Yu was already impatient. He stood up and said, “Let’s go.”

The man with the mustache took out a map from his pocket.

The map was quite simple and crude, and there was a location marked on it.

The man with the mustache pointed at the mark on the map and said, “I’ve set up a formation stage here. I’ll wait for you there.”

“After you get the mask, come and find me directly.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Aren’t you going with me?”

The man with the mustached man shook his head and said, “I still have to prepare in advance. You just need to bring the mask.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu didn’t think much about it and immediately nodded and agreed.

It was already late at night, but Qin Yu still left Cangzao City and rushed to Chuzhou.

Looking at Qin Yu’s back, the man with the mustache narrowed his eyes slightly.

A trace of craftiness flashed across his face, and there was a strange smile at the corner of his mouth.

“The mask... belongs to me!” The man with the mustache said coldly.

After saying this, the man with the mustache turned around and disappeared into the night.
