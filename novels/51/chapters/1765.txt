1766 Xiao Hai and Xiao Sheng

The mysterious man looked at Xiao Sheng indifferently. Although his face was covered, one could still imagine the smug expression on his face.

Xiao Sheng’s face was frighteningly cold. He looked at the mysterious man before him and said, “I asked the favor not for me, but for Qin Yu. Strictly speaking, I’m not begging you.”

The mysterious man was stunned.

He was silent for a long time, then snorted. “What do you mean? Tell me.”

Xiao Sheng immediately explained everything that had happened.

The mysterious man narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “Damaged primordial spirit? This is no small matter.”

“If it was simple, I wouldn’t have come to see you,” Xiao Sheng said coldly.

The mysterious man pondered for a moment, then said, “Give me a few days.”

“How long do you want? I’m afraid Qin Yu can’t hold on for too long,” said Xiao Sheng with a frown.

The mysterious man thought for a while and said, “Five days, I’ll come and see you in five days.”

“So you’ve agreed?” Xiao Sheng asked.

“Yes.” The mysterious man’s voice became more serious.

Xiao Sheng did not say anything more as he turned around and left.

The mysterious man merged into the void and disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was injured and Yuan Xiu was killed.

Once people heard this, they were both happy and sad.

“If one’s primordial spirit is damaged, it will affect one’s Foundation at the very least and one even might die.”

“If anyone knows how to help him, please go and do it.”

“With our abilities, I’m afraid we won’t be of much help.”

In Nanzhou, many people went all out to seek help for Qin Yu.

Many people even suggested so-called folk Masters and folk prescriptions, trying to find a healing pills for Qin Yu.

But unfortunately, these pills were obviously trickery and had no effect at all.

By now, the North Plain and Xihuang had disappeared one after another. It seemed that only Nanzhou and the East Continent were left in the huge Lizhou.

Different from Nanzhou, the East Continent had many sects and top-notch martial artists.

Although the North Plain and Xihuang were only abandoned lands, no one could guarantee that the abandoned lands would not become treasured lands one day now that the world had changed drastically. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Therefore, some sects in the East continent took advantage of this opportunity and went to these two lands, wanting to occupy them.

The East Continent’s internal strife took place in the North Plain and Xihuang.

Fortunately, people in Nanzhou did not have the intention to do so. The most powerful Tianyun Sect did not participate in this either.

On the Cultivation Mountain.

After a few days of recuperation and the circulation of his meridian circulation technique, Xiao Hai had recovered a lot.

The lower half of his body that had been cut off had been restored to its original state.

“Why were you so afraid of Yuan Xiu?” Xiao Sheng poured a cup of tea for Xiao Hai. After the battle, the brothers seemed to have become closer.

“No one would have thought that the arrival of the Golden Age would give cultivators the chance to enter the Reversion Void Stage,” Xiao Hai said coldly.

Xiao Sheng understood Xiao Hai’s meaning.

He took a sip of tea and said indifferently, “If the Golden Are didn’t come, Yuan Xiu would have been unrivaled.”

“Yes.” Xiao Hai nodded.

“Although I’ve thought about it, I can’t risk the entire Nanzhou.”

Xiao Sheng nodded. He was Xiao Hai’s elder brother, so he understood Xiao Hai’s thoughts and intentions.

“I’ll leave after this cup of tea,” Xiao Hai suddenly said.

“Where are we going?” Xiao Sheng asked.

“I don’t know. ” Xiao Hai shook his head. “You know that I can’t stay in any place for long.”

He reminded, “When Qin Yu wakes up, please convey my gratitude to him. If I’m fortunate to meet him again, I will thank him in person.”

Xiao Sheng knew that he could not make Xiao Hai stay, so he did not say anything more.

Time flew.

In the blink of an eye, the day that Xiao Sheng and the mysterious man had agreed upon had arrived.

On this morning.

Xiao Sheng stood alone on the Cultivation Mountain. He looked up at the sky, waiting for the arrival of that mysterious person.

When evening came, the void in front of Xiao Sheng finally began to tremble.

A moment later, the mysterious man walked out of it.

“How is it?” Xiao Sheng asked.

The mysterious man shot a glance at Xiao Sheng and said indifferently,” You seem impatient. This isn’t like you. In my impression, you only care about two people.”

Xiao Sheng furrowed his brows, a trace of displeasure flashing across his face.

The mysterious man rubbed his chin and said,” One of them is your younger brother, Xiao Hai. The other one seems to be the First Elder who came out with you? Other than them, you don’t even seem to care about your own children.”

Xiao Sheng’s expression turned increasingly cold. Clearly, he was enraged.

However, the mysterious man didn’t stop and said with sudden understanding, “I remember now. That son of yours... He wasn’t your biological son, right?”

“Cut the crap!” Xiao Sheng’s voice was frighteningly cold.

He coldly looked at the mysterious man and said, “Can you do this or not? if you can’t, then get lost.”

The mysterious man laughed. He reached out a palm and took out a pill.

“Feed him this pill and it will save his life.” The mysterious man laughed.

“But I have to tell you that the damage to the primordial spirit can not be healed by a pill. I’m afraid it will be a long process.

“His primordial spirit will have residue injury that will disturb him from time to time. As for when he will recover fully, that will depend on fate.”

Xiao Sheng frowned.

He took the pill and said, “Is there another way? That child’s time is very limited, he...”

“No, I don’t.” The mysterious man interrupted Xiao Sheng and teased him, “You’ve indeed changed. You’re actually starting to care about others.”

Xiao Sheng didn’t want to argue with him on this issue, so he waved his hand and said,” You can leave now.”

After saying this, Xiao Sheng prepared to head to the Dayue Mountain to feed the pill to Qin Yu.

“Xiao Sheng, there’s something important I have to tell you, the mysterious man suddenly said from behind.

“What’s it?” Xiao Sheng didn’t even turn his head as he spoke.

The mysterious man narrowed his eyes and said, “Did you offend someone from Zhongzhou?”

Xiao Sheng was silent, as if he was thinking about something.

“At an auction in Nanzhou, you injured a young man,” the mysterious man reminded.

Xiao Sheng grunted in response, but didn’t ask.

“I must warn you that the young man’s background is not simple,” the mysterious man said in a deep voice. “His family is famous even in Zhongzhou.

“I got the news not long ago that this young master wants revenge. You’d better be careful.”

“Then let him come. I’ll wait for him in Nanzhou,” said Xiao Sheng.
