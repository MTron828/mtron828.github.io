Chapter 2835: Heavily Injuring the Giant

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The golden lotus flower blocked all the space for him to advance.

A monk was walking on a golden lotus flower.

With every step he took, golden flames burned on the ground.

Countless Miracle Qi filled the entire space.

Roar!

Screech!

Howl!

The monster race and demon race roared crazily.

That was the miracle of the alien race, the despair of humankind.

Chen Zhisha appeared at the last moment— the peak power of level 14, Endless Life.

He had blocked Jiang Shengling at the most crucial moment.

He was stopped from entering the Eight Desolates Beast Domain to launch the ultimate strike.

“Sigh.”

Jiang Shengling closed his book and sighed again.

So many top-notch martial humans tried their best to help him, but they were still unable to launch this Heaven Seeking Strike.

He looked at the afterglow that had already been ignited. A sad expression flashed across his face.

The point at the top of the sky once again passed through countless spaces.

A huge pixelated hand grabbed at the space where Qin Yu was.

Countless spaces were completely crushed into a ball easily.

Wherever the giant hand passed, even the stars were turned into dust.

Galactic storms rippled through the universe.

He was here!

Liu Bai’s expression was grave.

The flying sword under his feet pierced through space and brought him and Ling Xue away from this place.

A large blurry area in the void was between the thousands of planes nearby.

“Hahahahaha!”

“Jiang Shengling, please send me to the Eight Desolates Beast Domain. I’ll give this Path of Heaven an unforgettable gift!”

The remnant page of the Investiture of Gods appeared on Qin Yu’s chest. It was like a high-temperature iron block that brought him intense pain.

At this moment, Qin Yu had a crazy idea. He roared crazily almost in an instant.

Boom! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Jiang Shengling closed the book abruptly and the righteous qi exploded like the sun.

Qin Yu felt a river lifting him and his body seemed to have returned to his mother’s embrace.

The righteous qi landed on Qin Yu’s body. This was the first time Qin Yu felt so powerful.

“Get lost!”

With a single palm, Chen Zhisha’s golden lotuses were all burned to ashes.

Before Chen Zhisha appeared again through the Endless Life power, the river had already entered the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

In the next moment, the ground suddenly buzzed and turned into nothingness.

In this place that occupied nearly a quarter of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, that terrifying vibration destroyed almost all living beings below the Dao Consciousness.

Far away in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom as well as between the Saint World, almost everyone could see that terrifying destructive power.

“What happened? Qin Yu, is that you?”

Meng Jing looked at the area with a hint of worry.

The power was so strong that even Wutian noticed it.

He stared at the power of the Seven Tribulations Sin wrapped around his hand. No one knew what he was thinking in his calm eyes.

At this moment, almost all the Saints felt this fluctuation.

However, they didn’t know what kind of unforeseen event had happened in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

Why was there such a terrifying battle? This power could even threaten the Holy Lord.

The moment the giant hand descended, it enveloped the wormhole and Qin Yu.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body was filled with the righteous qi of the Heaven Seeking Strike was compressed to body size.

Qin Yu’s body instantly shattered countless times.

He finally understood why Liu Bai sighed. The gap between the power and him was too big.

The righteous Qi was compressed to the extreme. The wormhole was furious the next moment.

A power that didn’t belong to the Saint World suddenly came out of the wormhole.

In an instant, the heaven, the earth, the sun, and the moon lost their order, while the yin and the yang were hidden. It was the reverse journey of all things. It was the divine prison of heavenly tribulation and the reverse of the Qian Kun.

The two powers converged and a destructive power shot into the sky like a pillar of death.

This attack attracted countless people.

The impact lasted for several days before it slowly stopped.

This was an attack of the most primitive power. Any order within it would be completely ineffective.

However, the power of the Investiture of Gods was stronger. The power on the other end of the wormhole began to weaken.

It began to retreat under the impact of the Investiture of Gods.

A furious intent that shook the sky was emitted from behind the wormhole.

A destructive bolt of divine lightning shot out from within and struck the pixelated world in the sky.

In the blink of an eye, the Investiture of Gods appeared in the sky.

After the final confrontation, the wormhole slowly disappeared.

A terrifying consciousness landed on Qin Yu’s body. Qin Yu could even feel the anger of this giant.

At this moment, he could also sense that it was the key to starting this battle. This was also the first time the giant had suffered such a serious injury.

As the giant in the void shook, the entire world also slowly trembled.

It was as if it had already become a part of this world. The power of the sealing god lit up in his palm, wanting to flag Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, now!”

A roar came from Qin Yu’s Investiture of God. It was Xiao Hai’s voice.

Qin Yu subconsciously controlled the righteous qi and launched an attack that gathered the righteous qi of the human race to the pixelated giant.

The moment the giant hand fell, the river of righteous qi that compressed to the extreme finally let out an angry roar.

The entire world seemed to have turned into a vast expanse of nothingness.

The righteous qi was like a waterfall flowing backward, washing over the giant hand.

The power of sealing gods rushed out from the Investiture of Gods again.

It instantly suppressed the river of righteous qi before it visibly weakened.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body floated uncontrollably. A force that he had never seen before swam through his body.

Qin Yu had not even noticed that power before.

In an instant, this power turned into a golden flying sword and pierced through the river of righteous qi.

It hit the Investiture of Gods in the air. Golden divine light shot out from behind the Investiture of Gods.

Panic immediately spread out in the pixelated giant’s sea of consciousness. In the next moment, the world changed again and the giant escaped!

Qin Yu stared at his hands in disbelief and his tears fell.

He could sense that power. It was the power produced by the fusion of the chaotic body and the bloodline of Immortal Emperor Tianming.

This was the power produced when he and Yan Ruoxue combined during the fourth level of the Heavenly Sin.

However, this power was too strong. His current body could not control it at all.

Therefore, this power woke up on its own at this moment of life and death and gave the giant a fatal blow.
