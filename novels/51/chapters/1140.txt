Chapter 1141: Chapter 1,141 was exposed? ! 

At this moment, Yao Qing’s internal Qi was extremely calm, like a pool of water.

There was clearly no internal Qi fluctuation, but it made people feel that it was unfathomable.

This was the aura of a top expert.

Looking at Yao Qing in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but scratch his head.

With this kid’s acting skills, if he were to go into the entertainment industry, he would probably become the best actor.

The few higher-ups not too far away did not have Qin Yu’s idle mind. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

They looked at the man in black robes in front of them, and sweat continuously broke out on their foreheads.

The fear that rose from the bottom of their hearts made them not have the slightest intention of resisting.

“You... you are a guardian of the path? Why did you come here...”Yan Yongfu took the lead to put down his strong stance and put away his edge. His voice was a little shaky.

The rest of the people were sweating profusely. Some of them were even trembling.

The surrounding crowd was all shocked!

Those were eight mighty figures! Just a moment ago, they had the appearance of a deity descending to the mortal world. Why did they suddenly change their demeanor?

Most people didn’t have any concept of a dao protector. In fact, they didn’t even know any dao protectors.

Therefore, they were naturally shocked by the stance of a mighty figure.

“Let’s go.”Yao Qing only spat out two words.

However, how could Yan Yongfu be reconciled in his heart? He smiled embarrassedly and said, “Lord Dao Protector, I know about the relationship between you and Qin Yu, but...”

“I told you to leave, don’t you understand?”Yao Qing interrupted Yan Yongfu’s words.

Yan Yongfu immediately shut up.

His throat rolled and he gulped, but he could not say a word.

“What? Do you want to challenge the dignity of the Guardians?”Yao Qing asked again.

He slowly raised his foot and took a step forward.

This move was undoubtedly very dangerous!

Not only was Yan Yongfu nervous, even Qin Yu’s heart was hanging in the air!

“This kid is addicted to acting, right?”Qin Yu cursed in his heart.

If that Yan Yongfu made a move to test him, it would be troublesome!

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare...”but Yan Yongfu quickly made his choice.

He cupped his hands and said, “We naturally don’t dare to Challenge Your Majesty. I just want to ask you for one thing.”

Speaking up to this point, Yan Yongfu looked at Qin Yu and said in a deep voice, “I can guarantee that I’ll let him off today, but you also have to make him make a promise.”

“Promise?”Yao Qing raised his head slightly.

Yan Yongfu said in a deep voice, “That’s right. I want Qin Yu to promise that when he steps into the Almighty realm, he won’t look for us to settle the score.”

Clearly, Yan Yongfu and the others were afraid! They Were Afraid of the future Qin Yu!

Yao Qing looked at Qin Yu as if he was waiting for Qin Yu’s answer.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Sure.”

However, Yan Yongfu did not stop there. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “I want you to use your blood essence as a guide and swear to the Heavenly Dao. If you break your promise, your body and soul will be destroyed!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately became a little ugly.

Once he swore to the Heavenly Dao, there would be no way out.

If he really broke his promise, he would be punished.

“As long as you’re willing to promise, we’ll leave now,”Yan Yongfu said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Yongfu and said coldly, “I won’t agree.”

The moment these words were said, the entire place was in an uproar!

This Qin Yu actually didn’t agree? These eight mighty figures had already made a concession, but he actually took advantage of them?

“I’ve sworn an oath. Everything you’ve done to Yan Ruoxue, I’ll pay you back twice as much. I’ll kill you all sooner or later,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Yongfu’s expression gradually turned cold.

“Lord Dao Protector, you heard it. If we let him go today, we’ll be the ones to die in the future!”Yan Yongfu said coldly.

In response, Yao Qing said coldly, “Are you bargaining with me? Do you have the right?”

Yan Yongfu’s expression suddenly changed, and a trace of anger flashed in his eyes.

“You don’t seem to be convinced.”Yao Qing took another step forward.

This action almost scared Qin Yu to death!

Was Yao Qing crazy? It was enough. After all, it was a fake!

If he was exposed, it would be troublesome!

However, Yan Yongfu subconsciously took a step back.

He hurriedly withdrew his killing intent, cupped his hands, and said, “Lord Guardian, I... I don’t dare.”

“Then let’s go,”Yao Qing said coldly.

“Yes... We’ll leave right away...”Yan Yongfu said in a trembling voice.

Although Qin Yu was a hidden danger in the future, it was still better than dying in the hands of the Guardian.

Moreover, whether Qin Yu could grow up or not was still unknown.

Hearing Yan Yongfu’s words, Qin Yu also heaved a sigh of relief.

What a close call!

But it had to be said that this kid, Yao Qing, was really too bold!

He was clearly a fake, yet he dared to press on step by step! Such a state of mind was truly admirable!

Seeing this, Yao Qing did not say anything more and turned around, intending to leave.

“Wait.”

At this moment, a higher-up suddenly spoke.

His eyes emitted a bright light as he rushed straight towards Yao Qing.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and his heart instantly became nervous.

The higher-up looked at Yao Qing coldly and said, “Doesn’t the Guardian not care about the affairs of the world? Moreover, we have lived for many years and have never seen the Guardian.”

Yao Qing’s back was facing the higher-up, and he said coldly, “What do you mean?”

The higher-up said indifferently, “Nothing much. I just have some doubts about your identity.”

“I wonder if Lord Dao Protector can take my palm and let me see how powerful the Dao Protector is?”

As soon as these words were said, Qin Yu’s expression instantly became extremely ugly!

Oh No! He was going to be exposed!
