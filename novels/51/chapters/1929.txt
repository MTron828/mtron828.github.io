1930 Shed All Pretenses of Cordiality

“That’s right. It’s Pavillion Master of Divine Alchemist Pavillion,” Gu Xinghe nodded and said.

Qin Yu was instantly incredibly excited. Back then, when he was still on Earth, the pavilion master had helped him numerous times. However, he had not heard from her since he arrived in Holy Region.

He didn’t expect to hear news about the pavilion master here today!

Qin Yu quickly turned to Gu Xinghe and said, “Where is Pavilion Master now? When did you see her?”

“Hahaha!” Seeing how excited Qin Yu was, Gu Xinghe could not help but laugh heartily.

He waved his hand and said, “Don’t be anxious. I’ve not seen her but only asked for pills. This pill is not mine. It’s a gift from the Si family.

“As for her whereabouts, if I’m not wrong, she should be at the Alchemist Association. It’s a gathering place for the most authoritative alchemists in the entire Holy Region.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to get up and go to the Alchemist Association.

But Gu Xinghe stopped him, shook his head, and said, “Even if you go now, you can’t see her. It’s not easy to see people in the Alchemist Association?”

“She’ll definitely see me,” Qin Yu said.

“She can see you, but she’ll go against the rules of the Alchemist Association. Why must you do that?”

Qin Yu was stunned but calmed down immediately.

He sat down again and said in a deep voice, “Then how do I see her?”

“Don’t be anxious. I’ll find a way for you in a few days,” Gu Xinghe patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said with a smile.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, then cupped his hands and said, “Thank you very much.”

“There’s no need to thank me between us. I brought two bottles of good wine today. Let’s drink and talk,” Gu Xinghe said.

Qin Yu no longer declined, and the two drank to their heart’s content the whole night.

Fortunately, Qin Yu had a high tolerance for alcohol and did not get drunk and lose his mind.

Gu Xinghe left the place after drinking.

Qin Yu chose to meditate and cultivate in the following few days while waiting for the ores.

As long as he could get the ores, Qin Yu would have a way to make a Saint Weapon.

He might not be invincible with a Saint Weapon in hand, but it would at least provide protection.

Of course, besides meditating and cultivating, Qin Yu also secretly made plans to avoid being tricked by Gu Xinghe.

There were numerous techniques in his mind. After a few days of searching, Qin Yu soon found one.

Several days went by.

One day, Gu Xinghe suddenly came to Qin Yu’s accommodation.

“Are you comfortable staying here?” he asked with a smile.

Qin Yu said casually, “I’m fine, but… How long do I have to stay here?”

Gu Xinghe laughed heartily, then said, “The ore is almost completely excavated. Probably tomorrow. Come with me to the mine tomorrow.”

“Alright,” Qin Yu felt relieved and said.

The following day.

Qin Yu followed Gu Xinghe to the mine. As expected, many cultivators were at the mine.

Gu Xinghe pointed at the mine and said, “These cultivators are all villagers from nearby. That’s why the speed of mining speed is slower.”

Qin Yu responded to him and glanced around the mine. True enough, a lot of ores had been excavated and packed.

“I’ll send someone to send these ores back later, and you and I can slowly divide them,” Gu Xinghe said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t say much. He didn’t have much right to say anything now, so he could only accept their arrangement.

After a while, following behind Gu Xinghe, Qin Yu rushed toward the palace.

On the way, Gu Xinghe’s expression was a little strange as if he was holding back some strong emotion.

When they arrived at the Military and Politically Affairs Office, Gu Xinghe poured Qin Yu a cup of tea and ordered the general-in-chief, “Place those ores properly. Don’t let any mishaps happen.”

The general-in-chief nodded and said, “Don’t worry. I’ve already arranged everything. There won’t be any mishaps.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The conversation between the two seemed a little strange as if they were talking with a hidden message.

Gu Xinghe took a sip of tea, smiled faintly, and said, “Qin Yu, where do you plan to go after taking these ores? Don’t tell me you want to go to the Yan family?”

“Why should I go to the Yan family?” Qin Yu raised his head and asked.

“That’s true,” Gu Xinghe said with a smile. “There’s no point in you going to the Yan family now.”

At this point, Gu Xinghe changed the subject. “Do you still remember? Back then, we fought for a long time over Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline. Speaking of which, I’m curious. Since you knew the uniqueness of Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline, why didn’t you marry her earlier?”

Qin Yu did not say a word and only raised his head to look at Gu Xinghe.

“Qin Yu, don’t tell me you two have already…” Gu Xinghe exclaimed in surprise.

“Of course not,” Qin Yu said, shaking his head.

“Tsk! Tsk! What a pity,” Gu Xinghe shook his head as he got up. He sighed and said, “Then I’m afraid you won’t have another chance.”

In that short moment, Gu Xinghe’s tone of voice had changed.

Qin Yu was very sharp. Of course, he realized it. Thus he responded impolitely, “Gu Xinghe, you still haven’t gotten rid of your habit of jumping to conclusions.”

“Hahaha!” Gu Xinghe laughed heartily. Suddenly, he flipped over the tea table in front of him and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“What are you doing?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked. “Why did you flip the tea table? It’s not good to lose your temper in front of an old friend, isn’t it?”

...

Gu Xinghe had completely shed all pretenses of cordiality. He glared at Qin Yu and said through gritted teeth, “An old friend? Do you think you’re worthy? Qin Yu, do you really think I’ll let you go? To tell you the truth. So what if you’ve come to Holy Region? In my heart, you’re always the most worthless!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You’ve finally said what’s on your mind. But it’s a pity that the most worthless in your heart has destroyed your cultivation and even caused you nightmares every night.”

“You shut up!” Gu Xinghe was furious and said. “Qin Yu, you can’t escape today! Let me tell you, I’ve already told the Si family about your relationship with Yan Ruoxue. To the Si family, you’re nothing!”

“If I want to leave, you can’t stop me,” Qin Yu got up slowly and said.

“I can’t stop you by myself, but do you think I will stop you by myself?” Gu Xinghe sneered and said.

As he spoke, the magical artifacts in every corner of the Military and Political Affairs Offices began to flash and glow, exuding extremely oppressive internal qi.

At this moment, the door was pushed open, and several cultivators stepped in with magical artifacts in their hands!

They stood in two rows as if they were welcoming someone.

A moment later, two people walked in. The one leading was the general-in-chief, and the one following was from the Si family!

Qin Yu was shocked. He was a Semi-Saint!
