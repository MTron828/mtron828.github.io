Chapter 933: Chapter 933, stealing the Spirit Stone mine! 

“F * CK, F * CK, F * ck!”When the mustached man saw this, he could not help but curse in his heart!

“If they inform the martial saint, it will be troublesome!”

Qin Yu could not help but frown deeply.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly took out his spatial divine weapon and handed it to the mustached man.

At the same time, Qin Yu looked at the mustached man and said, “I’ll leave this spatial divine weapon to you. You fill it with Spirit Stones, I’ll go up and kill them.”

After saying this, Qin Yu’s body shot up and rushed toward the edge of the Spirit Stone mine!

When he arrived at the edge of the mine, the martial marquises immediately surrounded him.

“Who are you? Why did you appear in the Spirit Stone Mine!”These martial marquises shouted.

Qin Yu sneered, “I’m your father!”

Before he finished his words, Qin Yu’s golden light burst out and he threw a punch!

In an instant, flesh and blood flew everywhere. Qin Yu’s incomparably fierce fist instantly shattered their bodies!

In just a few short minutes, these martial marquises had all died at Qin Yu’s hands.

Qin Yu dug out the golden cores from their internal qi and put them into his pocket. Then, he looked around.

Fortunately, the martial saints did not approach them from their positions.

“Eh?”However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt a strange aura!

This internal Qi came from a martial saint!

“Oh no! We have to leave now!”Qin Yu quickly returned to the spirit stone mine.

Inside the mine, the Mustache Man was still crazily holding the spirit stones.

“We can’t keep pretending. A martial saint is coming!”Qin Yu said.

However, the Mustache Man was still reluctant to leave. His face was full of greed.

At this moment, at least half of the spiritual stone mine had already been stored into their spatial divine weapons.

“Enough, we can’t go on like this!”Qin Yu said with a frown.

Without any explanation, he dragged his handlebar mustache and rushed into the spatial formation.

The moment the two of them stepped into the formation, Tian Xuehong, Gu Xinghe, and the others had already arrived.

As soon as they reached the vicinity of the spirit stone mine, they realized that something was wrong.

“HMM? where is he?”Gu Xinghe frowned.

He had arranged for people to be stationed around this area, but there wasn’t a single person here.

“There’s no need to look for him. He’s already dead.”Tian Xuehong’s expression was extremely gloomy.

“Dead?”Gu Xinghe’s expression changed, and he hurriedly rushed towards the spirit stone mine.

He arrived at the top of the mountain, and soon, he saw a few dismembered corpses.

Gu Xinghe’s expression instantly became even more unsightly!

“What... What’s going on!”Gu Xinghe shouted in alarm.

Zhai Xing frowned, as if he had thought of something.

He hurriedly looked at the spirit stone mine.

Seeing that at least half of the spirit stone was gone, Zhai Xing’s face instantly darkened.

“Not good, the spirit stones have been stolen,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“What? !”Gu Xinghe hurriedly walked to the edge.

When he saw the spirit stones that were half gone, he felt his vision go black and he almost fainted.

“How... how could this be! Who Did It!”Gu Xinghe said furiously.

Tian xuehong sneered and said, “Stop pretending. Who knows if it was you who moved the spirit stones ahead of time.”

Gu Xinghe hurriedly said, “Whoever transferred the spiritual stones is a F * cking bastard!”

Tian xuehong said coldly, “Is that so? Even if you transferred the spiritual stones, you won’t admit it.”

“Heaven and earth, whoever transferred the spiritual stones will be f * cking struck to death by lightning!”Gu Xinghe said angrily.

Zhai Xing narrowed his eyes and jumped into the spiritual stone mine.

“There’s a space formation here,”Zhai Xing said with a cold face.

Hearing this, the others hurried to follow him.

Looking at the space formation, their expressions became more and more unsightly.

“Uncle Zhai Xing, can you find out who transferred the Spirit Stones?”Gu Xinghe asked coldly.

Zhai xing nodded and said, “As long as they came here, they will leave their internal Qi behind.”

As he spoke, Zhai Xing closed his eyes and felt the remaining internal Qi in the surroundings.

However, very quickly, Zhai Xing’s expression changed slightly.

This was because he was surprised to find that there was no internal Qi at all!

“How could this be...”Zhai Xing’s brows furrowed tightly.

“What’s Wrong?”Gu Xinghe asked hurriedly.

Zhai Xing shook his head and said, “Those who stole the spiritual stones are probably experts. I can’t sense their internal Qi.”

“Stop acting,”tianxue Hong said coldly.

“I don’t care if the spiritual stones were transferred by you or not, but according to the agreement, I will take half of the spiritual stones, so the rest of the spiritual stones are mine.”

Gu Xinghe said with a cold face, “On what basis?”

“On what basis? Even if the spiritual stones were not stolen by your people, they were still guarded by your people. Now that the spiritual stones are lost, you naturally have to take responsibility,”tianxue Hong said with a cold snort.

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth. His face was full of anger, but he still had some fear towards Tian Xuehong.

After thinking for a while, Gu Xinghe braced himself and said, “We’ll split the spiritual stones equally.”

“Impossible. Half of your spiritual stones have already been stolen,”Tian Xuehong said with narrowed eyes.

At the same time, Tian Xuehong’s body emitted a cold, evil aura.

This aura instantly caused one’s entire body to feel a chill run down their spine.

“If you have the ability, then go and retrieve the spirit stones that were stolen!”Tian Xuehong said coldly.

Gu Xinghe was frightened.

He was only a half-step martial saint. Even with Zhai Xing protecting him, he still did not have the confidence.

Seeing that Gu Xinghe did not speak, Tian Xuehong snorted lightly and did not say anything else. He immediately began to store the spirit stones.

At this moment, Qin Yu and the moustache man fell out of the space formation.

“Damn it, what kind of broken space formation is this? I almost fell to my death!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

The moustache man mumbled, “It’s already not bad to be able to set up a formation in two hours. Why do you have so many requirements?”

Qin Yu rubbed his butt and looked around. He frowned and asked, “Where is this?”

At a glance, he couldn’t see the end of the desert! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The mustachioed man patted his head and said, “I forgot to tell you. This space formation is very unstable. It might not send us there.”

“You...”Qin Yu was speechless.

“Well, at least we got the spirit stones. It’s not a loss,”the mustachioed man said with a smile.

Qin Yu could only nod his head helplessly. As long as he got the Spirit Stones, everything was worth it.
