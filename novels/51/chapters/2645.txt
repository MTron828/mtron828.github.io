Chapter 2646: Evil Buddha

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After Jiang Feng and Su Su were rescued by Qin Yu, they continued to follow him.

Since the two of them were able to reach this third level, their strength was naturally not weak. They had also begun to grasp the power of ‘force’.

They just needed an opportunity to step into the True Consciousness Realm.

“Have you noticed that the ancient demons awakening in this area are becoming increasingly powerful?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

At first, they could easily hunt and kill these ancient demons, but within less than a day, they found themselves struggling to resist these awakened ancient demons.

“I have also noticed. If their strength continues to grow like this, we may have to go to the Demon Sealing Valley to ensure our safety,” Jiang Feng said solemnly. If it weren’t for Qin Yu’s terrifying strength, they would be unable to contend with these ancient demons.

And it seemed that with time, these ancient demons were becoming stronger and stronger.

Qin Yu’s expression grew even more serious. The origins of these ancient demons were incredibly ancient.

Over the long years, they had accumulated formidable power. They were far beyond the capabilities of the three of them, who had only been here for less than ten days.

After they had slain another ancient demon, a sudden tremor was felt nearby.

“There’s a battle. There are outsiders nearby as well,” Qin Yu said.

He was somewhat surprised. His Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze allowed him to see clearly.

Not far from them, there were six outsiders. What surprised him the most was that they were collaborating with a group of natives from the Demon Sealing Valley.

Furthermore, Qin Yu also recognized a familiar face, the demon Aiden.

After he had taken control of the first tribe, he spared Aiden’s life and even made him a promise.

If he could find the Sun Chasing Bow, Aiden would serve under his command.

At this moment, the Sun Chasing Bow was with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. This bow was given to him by Elder Tianji. He wondered if there was any connection between it and Aiden.

“It’s a little strange. These natives in Dao robes should belong to the Demon

Sealing Valley. The people from the Demon Sealing Valley we encountered before all treated us, outsiders, as enemies. Why would they take the initiative to cooperate with them?” Jiang Feng asked curiously, and Su Su nodded in agreement.

Other than the six outsiders, there were also three Daoists from the Demon Sealing Valley.

Judging from their robes, the three of them should be wearing the same robes as Gu Tian. They should all be inner sect disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley.

These three women did not appear old, but they were very powerful.

Their attacks carried the rhythm of the rules unique to True Consciousness, while the other six outsiders merely provided cover from the sidelines.

They were facing a half-naked monk.

The monk emitted a sky-high demonic qi, and an almost tangible shadow appeared behind him.

It was similar to the devil’s shadow. Its ferocious expression was filled with evil intentions, even visible to the naked eye.

As the demonic qi gathered and charged in his fist, the demon shadow suddenly punched out.

With this punch, the attacks of the three women were all shattered, and all three were sent flying simultaneously.

“What a terrifying power. Single-handedly defeating three top-notch martial artists of True Consciousness with just physical strength,” Jiang Feng exclaimed in shock. That attack was purely explosive power, and he didn’t sense any rhythm of rules in it. This only showed how terrifying the ancient demon was.

A surge of power emanated from Wu Tian’s hand, plunging into the ancient domain.

“Buddha Wu Tian, did you awaken that Evil Buddha?” Pang De asked, looking towards the direction of the power, appearing deep in thought.

“I’m just assisting it in breaking free earlier,” Wu Tian shook his head.

“Buddha Wu Tian, haven’t you already arranged for outsiders to go there? Why do you still need to make so many arrangements?” Pang De queried, still puzzled.

“There’s something peculiar about this man. Even though I’ve combined the power of my arms, I still can’t see his string of fate. It’s as if his string of fate has been severed, and he also carries something left behind by Chen Shuang. I want to eliminate this power beyond my control as soon as possible. Since I’ve promised the Emerald Serpent Witch, I must fulfill it,” Wu Tian explained in a low voice.

Suddenly, a black lotus landed on the Evil Buddha’s head.

A burst of power erupted above him, and the ancient demon, who had been keeping his eyes closed, suddenly opened them.

His eyes were as calm as an ancient well, completely unrelated to a demon. A smile appeared on his face as he looked up at the sky above the Siant Kingdom and sighed.

“I’ve been asleep for so long…”

As he opened his eyes, some sort of murmurs appeared in almost everyone’s sea of consciousness.

The voice sounded like a Buddhist chant coming from afar.

Though faint, it was very clear.

“To attain enlightenment and become a Buddha.”

This ethereal voice initially sounded normal, but it reverberated countless times in everyone’s sea of consciousness like an echo in a valley, causing them to involuntarily let down all their guards and face the Evil Buddha before them.

“Evil Buddha, you’ve been suppressed here by Holy Lord Chen Shuang for so long. Aren’t you going to repent?” a woman dressed in white softly chided.

As her voice echoed, the sound of glass shattering reverberated in everyone’s ears, finally breaking them free from the ramblings.

“Hahaha, what is a devil, what is a Dao, and what is a Buddha? Chen Shuang wanted to establish a country with Dao, giving birth to the strongest followers of Dao, yet he insisted on bestowing upon me the title of Evil Buddha. If his Dao was truly righteous and supported by all the natives, why would he bother about my existence and suppress me in this area?” the Evil Buddha chuckled.

“Time passes by, yet here I am, awakening from a dream. With the demise of the Holy Lord of Dao Xuan, his Dao can now rest with him,” he continued.

“Bullsh*t! He suppressed you because you failed to preach. Instead, you massacred all those unwilling to return to Buddhism. What’s the difference between your actions and those of a devil?” the white-robed woman rebuked.

“Ha, what use is there in sparing demons? Has Daoism killed fewer people than Buddhists? I am a living being born in this world. Compared to Dao Xuan, I am more qualified to discern right from wrong,” the Evil Buddha retorted.

“Senior Sister Zi Xia is stalling for time. I sense that the power just now has surfaced to command it. Its strength is slowly increasing. Let’s attack directly. Otherwise, once it regains its strength, we may not be able to leave,” another woman from the Demon Sealing Valley remarked, her expression changing as if she had sensed something.

“What sharp perception, but it’s too late,” the smile on the Evil Buddha’s face disappeared..Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
