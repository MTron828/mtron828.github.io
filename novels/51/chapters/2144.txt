2145 A Great Battle Is About to Break Out

Qin Yu’s words made Yan Ruoxue look shy. This added a touch of rosy color to her originally pale look due to nervousness.

Both of them were observant and conscientious. They could perceive the subtle changes in each other’s words and actions. The ups and downs of this journey inevitably increased the tacit understanding between the two.

Ever since Qin Yu left the place the Path of Heaven descended, he had been using Pills and spiritual stones to recover his true energy. He knew that during their short stay before reaching Astral Mountain, they had to open the teleportation formation as soon as possible to ensure their safety.

Therefore, he put all his attention on recovering his true energy. He knew it was only when his true energy recovered to a sufficient extent that he could activate the massive teleportation formation.

No one dared to waste time. As they got closer to Astral Mountain, Yan Ruoxue sped up and headed straight for Astral Mountain.

After an unknown period of time, the Yan family’s ancient ship finally slowly entered Astral Mountain’s area. The massive ancient gate of Astral Mountain also slowly entered their sight.

Seeing the gate appear, Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief. He adjusted his internal qi with all his might and stood up with difficulty.

The ancient ship sailed across the sky and slowly stopped at the gate.

“We’ve arrived.” Yan Ruoxue quickly walked over and wanted to help Qin Yu up, but Qin Yu stubbornly walked down himself.

The two slowly came to the gate and stopped. Raising their heads and looking at the gate dozens of feet tall, they felt a tremendous ancient and sacred internal qi.

The gate was adorned with densely inscribed mysterious talismans, and merely looking at them made one feel dizzy. The talismans seemed to have a life of their own, each flickering with a faint radiance as if waiting for some kind of activation signal.

“It depends on you now,” Yan Ruoxue said softly, looking at Qin Yu somewhat solemnly.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. With a thought, he began to take out the materials needed to activate the gate from his Spatial Magical Artifact.

He first took out a crystal clear stone from his Spatial Magical Artifact. It was a “soul origin”, and its shape was rather unique, like a hollowed-out crystal ball. A unique fluctuation was inside, and it seemed to guide the power of the soul.

Following that, he took out a gigantic feather. It was a “Primordial Heavenly Feather”. Emitting a faint light, each feather seemed to be engraved with a mysterious power. It had the power that surpassed the world and could guide and control spatial power.

Finally, he took out a gem from the divine artifact. It was a gem known as the “Chaos Core”. It seemed to contain a world that had yet to be opened by chaos, and the power to open the world. The power of this gem was powerful enough to open the gate.

After taking out all the materials, Qin Yu began placing them on the talismans on the gate orderly.

He first placed the soul origin at the top of the gate, then passed the Primordial Heavenly Feather through the soul origin and fixed it at the center of the gate. At last, he placed the Chaos Core at the bottom of the gate to form a complete formation.

He took another deep breath and began to circulate his true energy, guiding the power of these materials to activate the gate.

Under Qin Yu’s guidance, these materials began to flash with an intense light, and the massive gate began to change. The talismans carved on them began to shine with intense light as if they were responding to the power of these materials.

Activating this formation obviously consumed a large amount of spiritual energy. Qin Yu, who was already severely injured, turned tremendously pale at this moment. His body trembled slightly, and bean-sized sweat dripped continuously from his forehead as if he would faint at any moment.

Yan Ruoxue felt immense heartache. She raised her delicate hand and placed it on Qin Yu’s back, sending her true energy into Qin Yu’s body.

With Yan Ruoxue’s help, Qin Yu felt much more at ease. He held his breath, slowly activated the gate, and began to move the gate.

With Qin Yu’s spiritual power and Yan Ruoxue’s help, the talismans on the gate became increasingly brighter. Those talismans faintly flickering earlier were now like dazzling stars, scattering a layer of mysterious light. Their figures also appeared even more lonely and determined in this light.

The soul origin at the gate, Primordial Heavenly Feather, and Chaos Core seemed to be able to sense the power. Amidst the radiant glow, they shimmered with increasingly intense brilliance. They revolved around the gate like three bright stars, forming a mysterious power field.

Qin Yu was sweating profusely at this moment as if he had been drained of strength. He felt his spiritual power was rapidly depleting, but he did not intend to retreat. He gritted his teeth and continued to circulate his spiritual power.

“Qin Yu, you must hold on!” Yan Ruoxue hugged Qin Yu tightly, her eyes filled with worry.

Qin Yu smiled slightly, but this smile seemed a little pale. He gently waved his hand, signaling Yan Ruoxue not to worry.

Finally, under the joint efforts of Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue, the massive gate let out a loud bang and a mysterious light surged!

“Soon, hold on…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth tightly. The gate seemed to be about to open at any moment.

However, at this moment, an incredibly terrifying internal qi appeared in their divine sense.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue’s expressions changed drastically, and incredibly uneasiness filled their hearts!

But at this moment, how could Qin Yu give up? He gritted his teeth and urged the gate to open.

Just as the gate was about to open, a terrifying internal qi descended from the sky. A golden light flashed and ruthlessly landed on the gate. The gate that was about to open suddenly closed at this moment!

“D*mn it…” Qin Yu sat on the ground with a plop, his eyes revealing a trace of despair.

All the materials shattered, and it would not be so easy to gather them again.

“What a great ability! You actually opened the gate to Astral Mountain!” A voice entered Qin Yu’s ears.

He looked up and saw the two linen-robed elderly men from the Ni family.

“Qin Yu, today is the day you die!” one of them said coldly.

Yan Ruoxue immediately stepped forward and stood in front of Qin Yu.

Her delicate body trembled slightly, and a terrifying internal qi instantly gushed out. At this moment, Yan Ruoxue’s body was filled with an icy chill. She no longer had the slightest bit of shyness. Instead, she was like a female god of war. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I will kill whoever dares to touch Qin Yu,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

The two elderly men frowned and said, “Saintess Yan, we don’t want to be your enemy. Please step aside.”
