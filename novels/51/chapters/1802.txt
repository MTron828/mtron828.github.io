1803 Stepping into the Forbidden Zone

Qin Yu’s thoughts started to run wild.

The tremendous pressure had made him ignore everything.

That night, Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly as if he had made up his mind.

The effects of devouring the primordial spirit were unimaginable, but the consequences were also extremely severe.

More importantly, if it was discovered in the future, most likely he would be attacked by the entire Holy Region.

!!

But Qin Yu didn’t care anymore.

The following day.

Qin Yu woke up early. He and Jue Wu set off and left Heavenly Ocean City.

Standing at the entrance of Heavenly Ocean City, both of them were waiting for Gu Sanchen.

“Have you thought of a way?” Jue Wu asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Not yet. We’ll take it one step at a time. Either we lure him into the Forbidden Zone and let him die in there, or we’ll make sure he doesn’t have the chance to take out the Saint Weapon.

“Of course, it’s best to kill him with our own hands to get the points.”

Jue Wu nodded her head heavily. She clenched her fists and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll do my best.”

The two waited for about two hours.

Gu Sanchen finally appeared in the direction of the city gate.

There were three people beside him, two men and one woman.

Qin Yu’s eyes quickly locked onto one of the men.

This person looked wretched and had a detestable temperament. Most importantly, his eyes were constantly looking around like a thief.

“This person is probably Yang Yu,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Soon, Gu Sanchen led them to walk up to Qin Yu.

“Brother Qin,” Gu Sanchen greeted Qin Yu.

He then introduced, “Only these three are willing to travel with us. This is Yang Yu, and this is Shi San. The young lady’s name is Zhong Wenyi.

After hearing Gu Sanchen’s introduction, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

The sneaky-looking man was not Yang Yu. Instead, the tall man with an extraordinary temperament was the target of Qin Yu and the others.

“You really can’t judge a book by its cover,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Good to see you,” Qin Yu cupped his hands as a greeting.

Yang Yu walked forward and said with a smile, “I heard that Brother Qin is also from Zhongzhou. Your temperament is indeed extraordinary.”

“That’s right. Only the people of Zhongzhou would have Brother Qin’s temperament,” Zhong Wenyi chimed in.

Qin Yu sneered in his heart.

Wasn’t it just talking nonsense? They were indeed good at flattering.

“Brother Gu, let’s set off immediately,” Qin Yu said.

Gu Sanchen nodded slightly. With a thought, he summoned a giant anaconda that looked like a true dragon!

This giant anaconda seemed to be on the verge of transforming into a dragon with dragon horns growing out of its forehead. It looked no different from a true dragon.

“Let’s go,” Gu Sanchen said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu nodded and immediately took Jue Wu to board the giant anaconda.

Compared to Qin Yu’s Divine Eagle, the giant anaconda was much faster.

They shuttled through the air and headed straight for the Forbidden Zone.

On the way, Qin Yu did not say a word with his eyes closed slightly.

At this point, Yang Yu came forward and said, “Brother Qin, Zhongzhou is the most powerful place in the entire Holy Region. Why is Brother Qin only a Mighty Realm cultivator?”

“As per the request of our ancestors, I’m suppressing my cultivation realm,” Qin Yu glanced at him and said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“I see. It’s to build a solid foundation,” Yang Yu said to himself.

“I heard that Brother Yang went to the Forbidden Zone and obtained a Saint Weapon there,” Qin Yu took the opportunity to say.

“I was just lucky,” Yang Yu said with a smile. “Back then, when the various aristocratic families of Zhongzhou entered the Forbidden Zone, I happened to be nearby.”

“Take out and show me what kind of Saint Weapon it is,” Jue Wu said.

Yang Yu chuckled and said, “My Saint Weapon is quite simple and crude. It’s one of the low-end items. I won’t show it to you so that you won’t laugh at me.”

“F*ck you! I think you don’t have a Saint Weapon at all. Are you bragging?” Jue Wu sneered and said.

Yang Yu’s face changed slightly. He then said in a slighty displeased tone, “Brother Qin, this attendant of yours seems to have bad manners.”

“What the hell did you say? What bad manners?” Jue Wu suddenly stood up and glared at Yang Yu.

“Brother Qin, shouldn’t you discipline her?” Yang Yu said indifferently.

“She’s not my attendant,” Qin Yu said with a faint smile. “She’s a friend of mine.”

Upon hearing this, Yang Yu said in surprise, “In that case, this young lady is also from an aristocratic family in Zhongzhou?”

“It’s none of your business,” Jue Wu cursed.

Yang Yu smiled and didn’t say anything else.

Qin Yu snorted at Yang Yu. This guy was a typical snobbish person.

“Brother Gu, how far is the Forbidden Zone?” Qin Yu asked.

“It’s quite far away,” Gu Sanchen said. “With our speed, we’ll need three days to get to the nearest Forbidden Zone.

“It takes such a long time.” Qin Yu frowned.

Yang Yu interjected again, “Brother Qin doesn’t need to be anxious. The good things in life are worth waiting for. I’m quite familiar with this Forbidden Zone. I can lead the way for everyone when the time comes.”

“Good. I’ll have to trouble Brother Yang then,” Qin Yu said with a fake smile.

“Brother Qin, is this your first visit to the Crimson Moon Continent?” Gu Sanchen asked.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “I heard about it before, but I never had a chance to visit.”

“With Brother Qin’s cultivation realm, wouldn’t your family be worried about you going to the Crimson Moon Continent alone?” Yang Yu asked.

“I have a Protective Magic Artifact,” Qin Yu said. “Even if a True Saint were to attack me, he would have to think twice.”

“I see,” Yang Yu nodded slightly and said.

Qin Yu didn’t want to talk too much nonsense with Yang Yu. He sat on the giant anaconda and closed his eyes slightly, pretending to be cultivating. But in fact, he was suppressing the inner demons in his heart.

By the side, Zhong Wenyi said unwittingly, “The Qin family in Zhongzhou seems to be very small. Would such a family have any top-tier treasures? Brother Qin, can you show us your treasure?”

“D*mn it! Quickly shut your stupid mouth,” Jue Wu stood in front of Qin Yu and cursed.

Zhong Wenyi glanced at Jue Wu, sneered, and said, “Which family are you from? Tell me so that I can broaden my horizons?”

“I won’t tell you. So what?” Jue Wu snorted.

Zhong Wenyi said with a cold face, “I’m afraid you’re also from an unknown small aristocratic family, aren’t you? It’s probably even more inferior than ours.”

“Do you want to try?” Jue Wu said with a gloomy face.

“Everyone,” Gu Sanchen tried to smooth things over and said. “We can’t have any internal strife. Our target is the Forbidden Zone.”

After hearing Gu Sanchen’s words, the crowd finally calmed down.

Qin Yu sat there cross-legged, and his inner demons started to act up again.

He forced himself to endure it, but his forehead was sweating profusely.
