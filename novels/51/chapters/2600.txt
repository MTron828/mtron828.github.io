Chapter 2601: Ogre’s Esophagus

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Along the way, many commoners slowly walked out and followed Qin Yu and Shen Qian indifferently.

“Has the power of the local necromancer reached such a level that even soldiers stationed to guard against this level of invasion have no response?”

Shen Qian’s face was ashen. She had never seen such a terrifying scene.

All the humans turned into puppets, their eyes filled with whites staring at them. Those with weaker mental resilience would likely collapse directly under this terrifying sight.

“No, he doesn’t have the power to kill these humans. That necromancer can only control the humans with the lowest hint. He can’t even control them to attack.”

Only after leaving the crowd did Qin Yu have the energy to observe these people’s actions adequately.

Seeing them not attacking him, he heaved a sigh of relief.

“Hello, sir. Has this happened before?”

Qin Yu grabbed the hand of an old man who was not under his control and asked.

The old man trembled, waving his hands repeatedly, seemingly quite frightened.

“Looks like this is the first consciousness invasion.”

Qin Yu frowned.

He stood in place and pondered for a long time. With Seifer’s formidable strength, he should treat him as a little bug.

Why did he come to rope him in? It was like the question of why elephants wanted to befriend ants.

It was certainly because he was a threat to the monster race army that Seifer had extended an olive branch.

The ancient hand previously had an internal qi of order, so it should not be telling lies

If he surrendered, he could obtain the power he had mentioned, but that would mean giving up on everyone in the city.

Qin Yu slowly shook his head. If he was from another race, he might be able to accept Seifer’s invitation.

However, he was also a human, so he could not join the alien race and watch these demonic beasts slaughter the people in the city.

What was it?

Was it the Heart of Saint Kingdom on him or the person imprisoned in the bunker?

Qin Yu made up his mind. No matter what, he had to make a trip to the bunker. Only then could he understand who the living being Elder Tianji was referring to.

“Brother Qin Yu, a member of the demon race.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Shen Qian suddenly said warily.

Beside them, a few figures appeared nearby and surrounded them.

“Don’t attack yet. I don’t know if the order in this castle allows fighting with each other. If you accidentally break the rules, you will be wiped out like Li Yu.” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

At this moment, on the green stone floor of the street and the walls of the many farmhouses, the walls started to squirm like muscles.

And the floor seemed to have turned into soft flesh. Standing on it was like a small boat in turbulent waters, non-stop trembling.

A fishy smell was spreading from the floor and walls.

“Necromancy? You accepted Seifer’s invitation?”

Qin Yu stared at the rotting corpses that kept emerging from the ground and said with narrowed eyes.

The outsiders who had only been here for a mere ten days could not comprehend this technique.

The only possibility was Yin Lin had accepted Seifer’s call to surrender and obtained a necromancy technique. It was also the reward that he had mentioned to him previously.

Qin Yu directly stomped an ogre that popped out beneath his feet, and then his body suddenly became lighter.

Two corpses suddenly appeared on the mound under his feet, and they lifted him from the left and right.

“Whoosh!”

With a flash of blade light, Shen Qian cut off the arms of the two corpses.

A flying knife suddenly came from Shen Qian’s back. It was a demon race nearby who had suddenly attacked.

Qin Yu threw out the dagger in his hand and ran toward the demon race.

In the blink of an eye, the demon race that threw the dagger was grabbed by the neck and twisted.

“It seems that my guess is right. This place only limits us from attacking the residents here, but outsiders can fight freely.”

Qin Yu had made the first move. Firstly, this demon race was also attacking Shen Qian’s fatal position. Secondly, he had the Seal of Heaven Returning and the hat of the void.

Even if the power of destruction descended, he could still guarantee his safety.

Moreover, with his current strength, these demon race living beings were not his match at all.

He had reached the limit of his strength before coming here.

“Thud!”

In an instant, the floor and walls twisted to the extreme.

Before he could react, nearly ten corpses had already rushed out.

These corpses had almost the same strength as the ogres. Even after Qin Yu strengthened his body, it was still incredibly difficult for him to face so many ogres in one go.

Fortunately, most corpses were coming for him, so Shen Qian could barely hold on.

“D*mn it!”

Qin Yu grabbed the demon race’s long saber and slashed horizontally with all his might.

He cut the two ogres in front into halves and sank into the ground with them.

The ground slowly squirmed again as if it was nurturing new ogres. Moreover, killing these two undead creatures did not obtain him any Saint Power. “No, we’re going to die of exhaustion! Shen Qian, get down!”

Qin Yu forcefully held his head, and the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze continued to sweep out its energy.

The two living beings of the demon race and three ogres in front of him were crushed in the middle. Their bodies were directly split in half by this force.

He stared intensely at the surrounding twenty meters, trying to locate Yin Lin.

Otherwise, if this continued, he would directly exhaust himself to death!

“D*mn it, why is this human race b*stard so difficult to deal with? Even the Way of Necromancy is unable to resist it.”

Yin Lin’s expression was tremendously ferocious. He had accepted Seifer’s invitation to cooperate with Seifer to destroy this town.

The first thing he did was kill all these outsiders, but he did not expect Qin Yu to be so tyrannical.

Under the ogre’s esophagus, he could kill the three of them.

“You little b*stard, you’re courting death! ”

The demonic pupils in Yin Lin’s eyes narrowed into a line. All the power of his soul surged into the necromancy order.

“Gulp! Gulp! Gulp!”

Another ten ogres suddenly appeared and grabbed Qin Yu’s legs. His body instantly sank, and he could no longer move quickly.

“A good opportunity. Projection.”

Yin Lin drew out the saber he had exchanged for. This saber was used by the commando team.

In front of his line of sight, a line extended from the saber in his hand.

It disappeared into the void and then slowly moved.

In the end, that red line filled with death landed in front of Qin Yu.

“Whoosh!”

Suddenly, Qin Yu felt the world before him tilt.

His entire body was submerged in the blood-red world. At this moment, he could not control his body but could see the surrounding scene.

“D*mn it, how did you kill me?”

After a second, Qin Yu came back to his senses.

At tms moment, ne triggered tne nat ot tne void and was already In a state ot nothingness.

Just now, a saber suddenly stretched out and cut off half of his throat. He did not have any time to react at all..
