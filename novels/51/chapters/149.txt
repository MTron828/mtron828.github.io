Chapter 150: I’m Guaranteed a Spot in the Finals Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Mr. Yang didn’t feel awkward in the face of everyone’s ridicule. He only said politely, “I’m not participating this time. It’s Mr. Qin who’s participating.”

After saying that, Mr. Yang looked at Qin Yu.

The group of old men couldn’t help but laugh when they saw this.

“Mr. Yang, is there no one else in Jiangcheng? You found a little kid to participate.”

“That’s right. Alchemy is all about experience. What can a kid like him do?”

Mr. Yang’s expression was a little awkward, but he didn’t say anything.

It was obvious that he was already used to everyone’s ridicule.

“Mr. Yang, it’s okay. These people aren’t worth mentioning at all.” Qin Yu smiled and comforted him.

Although his voice wasn’t loud, it reached everyone’s ears.

This group of old men immediately flew into a rage and berated, “Brat, we are your elders after all. How dare you talk to your elders like this!?”

Qin Yu glanced at them, then said indifferently, “There are always people who like to use their age to oppress others. Does being old mean you’re always right? Does being old give you the right to spout nonsense? If you have morals, I respect you. If you have no morals, I’m sorry, but you’re nothing in my eyes.”

These words made everyone blush.

“From your words, I know that you don’t have any real ability!” Someone snorted coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Old fart, right back at you.”

“You!” The few of them were so angry that their expressions turned ashen, but they had nothing to say.

“Don’t lower yourself to their level,” Mr. Yang said to Qin Yu in a low voice.

Although that was the case, it was obvious that Mr. Yang felt extremely satisfied.

He had been ridiculed by these people for many years. Now that Qin Yu was able to help him fight back, how could Mr. Yang not be happy?

Then, Mr. Yang brought Qin Yu to find a place to sit down and wait for the people from the Chinese Medical Association to arrive.

Qin Yu looked around and couldn’t help but frown.

This place was usually deserted, but the decorations were extremely luxurious. This made Qin Yu somewhat suspicious.

Was the decline of Chinese medicine related to these people?

“These people are all here to amass money. They only care about profiting. How can they care about anything else?” Mr. Yang seemed to notice Qin Yu’s doubts and said from the side.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and couldn’t help but sigh inside. The moral degeneration of the world was getting worse day by day.

The group of people waited for two whole hours, but the people from the Chinese Medical Association still didn’t appear.

Qin Yu looked at his watch. It was already four o’clock in the afternoon.

“Didn’t they say that the registration time starts at two o’clock? They’re already two hours late,” Qin Yu muttered.

Mr. Yang forced a smile and said, “Get used to it. These people are very arrogant.”

As he spoke, the door opened.

Then, a young man walk in from outside.

He reeked of alcohol and walked unsteadily. It was obvious that he had drunk too much.

When they saw this young man, the few old men hurriedly stood up and bowed. “Mr. Zhong, you’re here.”

The young man who was called Mr. Zhong didn’t pay any attention to them. He sauntered over to the sofa and sat down.

Then, he said with some annoyance, “The form is on the table. Take it and fill it out yourselves.”

“Alright, Mr. Zhong!” The few old men eagerly took the form and began to fill it out.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

Mr. Zhong wasn’t even as old as Qin Yu, but these old men were full of respect for him. They didn’t care about his age at all. Such double standards.

“Let’s go get the form too,” Mr. Yang said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded. His original intention was to get hundred-year-old herbs, so he was too lazy to argue with these people.

After taking the form, Qin Yu quickly filled out his information and put it on the table.

“Is this enough?” Qin Yu asked Mr. Yang.

Mr. Yang nodded and said, “Yes, let’s go.”

Qin Yu nodded and turned to leave.

Just as he reached the door, the door was opened.

Then, he saw Zhou Tong standing outside the door. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When he saw Zhou Tong, Qin Yu was stunned.

Zhou Tong stayed where he was as he sized up Qin Yu and sneered. “What are you doing here?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but before he could answer, Zhou Tong suddenly understood. “I know. You’re here to participate in the Chinese Medicine Conference, right?”

“Mr. Zhou, do you know Qin Yu?” Mr. Yang asked from the side.

Zhou Tong sneered. “I know him. Not only do I know him, but I’ve dealt with him before.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and had a bad feeling.

As expected, Zhou Tong walked to the table, picked up Qin Yu’s application form, and glanced at it.

Then, he tore the form and threw it on the ground.

“I’m sorry, but you’re unqualified to participate in the Chinese Medicine Conference,” Zhou Tong said indifferently.

As soon as he said that, Mr. Yang immediately became anxious.

He quickly walked forward and said anxiously, “Mr. Zhou, why is Qin Yu unqualified to participate? I submitted his information before, and everyone was very satisfied with his qualifications...”

Zhou Tong took a sip of tea and said indifferently, “It’s not for any reason. It’s just because he offended me.”

His unabashed shameless attitude shocked Qin Yu somewhat.

Mr. Yang’s expression suddenly changed, and he stood there in confusion.

Zhou Tong walked in front of Qin Yu and sneered. “Qin Yu, do you still remember what I told you? Sooner or later, you will have to beg me!”

After saying that, Zhou Tong put his hands behind his back and said proudly, “If you beg me, I might be able to show mercy and let you participate in the Chinese Medical Conference.”

“Beg you?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. “Who do you think you are?”

Zhou Tong’s expression couldn’t help but change. He sneered. “You’re really stubborn! In that case, you can get lost. We don’t welcome you in the Chinese Medical Conference!”

The few old men also shouted one after another, “Serves him right! This kind of person shouldn’t be allowed to participate!”

“Hurry up and scram, little b*stard!”

Facing everyone’s curses, Qin Yu remained silent.

Mr. Yang was extremely anxious. He hurriedly walked in front of Zhou Tong and said with a pleading tone, “Mr. Zhou, what exactly is going on? Qin Yu is still young. Don’t lower yourself to his level...”

“Hehe, as long as he is willing to beg me, I can consider it. It’s just that he isn’t willing.” Zhou Tong sneered.

Mr. Yang was extremely anxious. He walked back to Qin Yu’s side and whispered, “We have no choice but to do what they ask. Qin Yu, why don’t you apologize to him...”

“Apologize to him? Why should I apologize to a sh * thead?” Qin Yu sneered.

“You heard him, right?” Zhou Tong sneered. “Hurry up and get lost!”

Qin Yu snorted and turned to leave.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Yu Jing.

Qin Yu picked up the phone and said, “Mr. Yu, what’s wrong?”

On the other end, Yu Jing said with some excitement, “Mr. Qin, do you still remember what the Deputy Chief said last time? He said that he could get you a spot to send you to the finals. Now, the spot has been given to you. Where are you? I’ll send it to you!”

When he heard this, Qin Yu immediately smiled.

He told Yu Jin the address and then hung up the phone.

Zhou Tong looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Why? Have you thought it through?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said with a nonchalant smile, “I’m sorry, I don’t need to ask you, because I’m guaranteed a spot in the finals.”
