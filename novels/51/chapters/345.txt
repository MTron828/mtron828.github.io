Chapter 346: Two Choices Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It’s fine.”

Xiang Zhuang said awkwardly, “I’m really sorry to have startled you. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely take care of them!”

Sun Bo and the others had ugly expressions on their faces.

What was going on? Qin Yu really knew Xiang Zhuang?

Moreover... Xiang Zhuang’s attitude was a little too humble, wasn’t it?

As someone who was trying to curry favor with the elites, Sun Bo was the first to react.

“Mr. Qin, I was ignorant. I... I apologize to you!”

After saying that, Sun Bo began to slap his own mouth!

As he slapped, he said, “Mr. Qin, do you think this can vent your anger? If it doesn’t vent your anger, I’ll kneel here and continue to slap myself!”

Seeing Sun Bo’s attitude, Qin Yu couldn’t stop laughing coldly.

It turned out that Sun Bo, who liked to bully people, had such a humble attitude when facing people of noble status. It was really laughable.

“Alright, Sun Bo. From today on, you’re no longer a member of Xiang Real Estate.” Xiang Zhuang waved his hand impatiently.

“The same goes for you guys.” Xiang Zhuang pointed at Qin Yu’s group of classmates and said.

This group of people immediately panicked.

Sun Bo kowtowed to Qin Yu desperately and said, “Mr. Qin, I really know my mistake. Give me another chance and you can treat me like sh*t...”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with people like Sun Bo, so he didn’t say anything.

“Mr. Qin, let’s hurry up and eat. The dishes are ready,” Xiang Zhuang said politely.

Qin Yu nodded and followed Xiang Zhuang out of the room.

The two of them went to another relatively luxurious room and sat down.

The table was already filled with dishes.

Fang Yue was sitting there while looking at Qin Yu with a smile.

“Where did you go, Mr. Qin?” Fang Yue asked with a smile.

Qin Yu said casually, “I met an acquaintance.”

Bringing up this topic, Xiang Zhuang poured himself a glass of wine and said, “Mr. Qin, it’s all my fault. I’ll drink this glass of wine as punishment!”

After saying that, Xiang Zhuang raised his wine glass and downed it.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Xiang, this has nothing to do with you.”

“They are people from my company after all. How could they have nothing to do with me?” Xiang Zhuang said with an embarrassed smile.

It could be seen that Xiang Zhuang’s attitude toward Qin Yu was somewhat humble.

“Xiang Zhuang, don’t worry. Mr. Qin isn’t that kind of petty person,” Fang Yue said with a nonchalant smile at the side.

“Yes, yes, yes, of course.” Xiang Zhuang hurriedly nodded.

At the end of the dinner, Xiang Zhuang suddenly stood up and said, “Mr. Qin, I might have to trouble you in the future. My family members aren’t in good health.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”

“Then thank you, Mr. Qin!” Xiang Zhuang couldn’t help but say excitedly.

With the current strength of the Xiang family, it was impossible for them to consult the Elders of the Divine Medicine Pavilion.

For businessmen like them, it was common to get sick.

Qin Yu’s words of assurance was equivalent to them getting an extra life.

Xiang Zhuang had booked a room early, so after the dinner, Xiang Zhuang drove Qin Yu and Fang Yue to the hotel.

“Mr. Qin, don’t forget what you promised me.” Before returning to the room, Fang Yue said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry.”

That night, Qin Yu didn’t sleep well.

He looked at the moonlight outside the window and couldn’t wait for the arrival of tomorrow.

At eight o’clock in the morning the next day, Qin Yu left the hotel early and rushed to the Yan family.

As Old Mister Yan’s health deteriorated, his authority over the Yan family was quietly diminishing.

For the past few days, Old Mister Yan had been sitting in his room playing chess and drinking tea.

At this moment, the butler walked over from the side.

He stood beside Old Mister Yan and said in a low voice, “Old Master, Yan Sihai has already made a move against the people around Miss Yan.”

Old Mister Yan’s hand that was holding the chess piece suddenly froze in mid-air.

He put down the chess piece in his hand and sighed slowly. “Sihai had been developing his own forces since long before. It seems that it is already impossible to make Sihai show mercy.”

“That’s right.” The butler couldn’t help but sigh.

“Regardless of whether it is the business world, the political world, the battlefield, or martial arts, the Eldest Young Master possesses the most powerful strength.”

Old Mister Yan was filled with bitterness and he was unable to speak.

The fights within the large families would never stop.

As Yan Sihai was his own son, Old Mister Yan couldn’t possibly use any ruthless methods against him.

Various internal and external problems caused Old Mister Yan to have a headache.

At this moment, the nanny walked up from downstairs.

“Old Mister, Qin Yu is here,” the nanny said.

“Qin Yu?” Old Mister Yan’s face flashed with surprise.

Then, Old Mister Yan smiled and said, “Let him come up.”

“Yes, Old Mister Yan.” The nanny bowed.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu came up from downstairs.

“Old Mister Yan.” Qin Yu walked forward and bowed.

Old Mister Yan smiled and said, “Come and sit.”

Qin Yu walked over to Old Mister Yan’s side.

His expression didn’t look too good because the death aura between Old Mister Yan’s brows had increased.

This degree of death aura indicated that Old Mister Yan probably wouldn’t live for long.

“How about a round of chess?” Old Mister Yan said with a smile.

“Alright!” Qin Yu nodded his head vigorously.

This time, Old Mister Yan’s chess playing style had become cold, fierce, and vicious. He would use the fastest method to finish Qin Yu off in almost every game.

And after a few rounds of fighting, Qin Yu’s chess playing style had also become more sophisticated and mature.

In contrast to Old Mister Yan’s decisiveness, Qin Yu’s chess playing style was extremely steady and almost impregnable.

In other words, Old Mister Yan was like the sharpest spear, and Qin Yu was like the toughest shield.

After an entire morning, finally, during the last game, Qin Yu launched a counterattack.

This counterattack actually caught Old Mister Yan off guard.

In just a few short moves, Old Mister Yan had no chess pieces left to play with. All the chess pieces were taken out by Qin Yu.

“Hahaha!”

This made Old Mister Yan stroke his beard and burst into laughter.

He looked at Qin Yu with admiration and said, “Every one of your moves affect the overall situation. In every defeat, there is a hidden killing intent. Once the opponent counterattacks, there will be no place to escape. Not bad! Not bad!”

As the saying went, chess was reflective of one’s life.

One’s M.O. when playing chess also showed one’s attitude in competitions.

“Old Mister Yan, you flatter me. In the face of such a strong opponent like you, I won’t dare to rashly attack,” Qin Yu said humbly.

Just like this chess game, in the face of a huge Jingdu aristocratic family, Qin Yu didn’t dare to act rashly.

What he could do was to grow while waiting for an opportunity to act.

“Qin Yu, you should know that I don’t have long to live,” Old Mister Yan suddenly said.

Qin Yu immediately fell into silence and didn’t know what to say for a moment.

Old Mister Yan’s expression suddenly became somewhat cold.

He stared at Qin Yu and said, “You should know the situation of the Yan family. If I die, Ruoxue won’t be a match for Yan Sihai.”

“But they are all my closest relatives. I don’t want them to fight amongst each other.”

“So, I’m giving you two choices now,” Old Mister Yan said coldly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Please speak.”

“First, give up on Ruoxue. I will give you a sum of money. I will also give you treatment and resources that aren’t inferior to that of a noble family’s young master. This is also in line with your life strategy,” Old Mister Yan said.

“As for whether you can snatch Ruoxue back in the future, that is up to you.”

Speaking up to this point, Old Mister Yan paused for a moment before continuing, “As for the second choice, you might become the common enemy of the Yan family and the Han family.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Once I die, they won’t hold back on you.”

“At that time, you might die, and Ruoxue will also be implicated because of you.”
