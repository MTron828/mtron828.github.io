Chapter 1114: Chapter 1,114, return to the fire country. [ Pyro ] 

“Who... . . Who Are You! ?”The young man’s face was immediately filled with shock!

Just the mere pressure alone had caused them to fall to their knees. This was enough to prove that the man before them had far exceeded anything they could ever imagine!

Qin Yu said calmly: “My name is Qin Yu.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Qin Yu! ?”Hearing that name, everyone on the ship took a few steps back!

“HM? Looks like I am very famous in the Hong Yi sect.”Qin Yu said indifferently.

The young man was even more flustered as he said in a trembling voice: “Mr. ... . . Mr. Qin, the Hong Yi Sect’s matter has nothing to do with us. You... . . Don’t Kill Us, we will promise you anything... . .”

Qin Yu placed his hands behind his back and said: “Don’t worry, I am not a person who would kill. As long as you send me back to the fire country.”Pyro said

“No problem, absolutely no problem!”The young man hurriedly said.

Qin Yu retracted the oppressive aura from his body and said: “How long will it take to return to the fire country from here?”

“If we reply to Mr. Qin, based on the current speed, it will only take five days at most.”The young man said.

Qin Yu could not help but frown.

[ it will take five days? ]?

“Too slow.”Qin Yu shook his head and said.

The young man immediately said: “If we were to travel at full speed, we would only need at most four days!”

“Then we will travel at full speed.”Qin Yu said.

“Travelling at full speed is not a problem, but... . .”The young man opened his mouth, seemingly unable to speak.

Qin Yu shot him a glance and said: “Why, do you have any other requests?”

“No, no, no.”The young man quickly shook his head.

“It’s just that... . . You should also know that the fire country has been trying to capture us and it would be very dangerous for us to get close to the fire country, so... . . You must ensure that we can leave safely.”The young man said with a pyro smile.

Qin Yu said indifferently: “Do you have the right to negotiate terms with me? So what if I don’t agree?”

The young man opened his mouth and his expression immediately turned a little ugly.

“Alright, let’s go. If any of you have any other intentions, I will immediately kill all of you.”Qin Yu said coldly.

When everyone saw that, they did not have any other choice.

Qin Yu was too powerful, and was not someone they could resist against.

After that, Qin Yu found a room and settled down temporarily.

The ship was slowly sailing towards the fire country.

Qin Yu lay on his bed and rested for a short while before he took out his medicinal cauldron.

“That mighty figure will be born in half a month at most. I have to hurry up.”Qin Yu thought to himself in a low voice.

He had not expected that there would be another enemy on this trip, and it was even a mighty figure.

But to Qin Yu, there was no longer any difference. With more lice, one would not be afraid of being bitten.

He took out the strange flower and began to refine the heaven origin pill.

With Qin Yu’s speed, even if he spent half a month, he might not be able to use up all of the strange flowers. Hence, he had to hurry back to the fire country and seek the help of the pavilion master.

On the other side, Yun Long returned to the Cloud Dragon Island dejectedly.

His hands had been chopped off, and fresh blood dyed his sleeves red.

“What’s going on?”The mighty figure’s divine sense floated out and asked in a cold voice.

Yun long suddenly knelt on the ground and said in a trembling voice, “I’m not his match. I let him escape...”

The veins on the almighty expert’s face were throbbing non-stop. His anger caused his white hair to dance wildly.

“Master, you... You Can Punish Me!”Yun long knelt on the ground and said in pain.

“Forget it, forget it.”The almighty expert waved his hand.

“Since he can come to the Cloud Dragon Island, he naturally has some ability. I Don’t blame you.”

Yun long suddenly stood up and said while clenching his teeth, “Master, are you going to let him go just like that?”

“Let him go?”The Almighty’s expression turned cold as he said coldly, “When I come into the world, I will naturally kill him! I want to see where he can run to!”

...

The ship floated on the surface of the sea.

Qin Yu spent an entire day, but he only refined six sky origin pills.

“This speed is still too slow.”Qin Yu sighed.

With Qin Yu’s ability, he could refine three hundred sky origin pills out of one hundred strange flowers.

Three Hundred Sky origin pills, not to mention the intermediate stage of the martial saint stage, even the advanced stage of the martial saint stage would have the chance.

“Forget it. In just half a month’s time, it’s not realistic to improve too much. As long as I can step into the intermediate stage of the martial saint, it will be enough.”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

According to Qin Yu’s calculations, once he stepped into the intermediate stage of the martial saint, he would have a chance to fight against a mighty figure.

Not to mention a mighty figure who had not appeared in the world for many years.

In the blink of an eye, another three days had passed and they were getting closer and closer to the fire country.

And in Qin Yu’s hands, there were a total of eighteen heavenly yuan pills.

The many days of refining pills had caused Qin Yu’s internal Qi to become a little dispirited.

He put away the medicinal cauldron and then walked out of the room, all the way to the deck.

“How much longer till we reach the fire country?”Qin Yu asked Pyro.

The young man quickly replied: “We will be able to reach it today, about three to four hours.”

“Alright.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

He stood on the deck and released his divine sense to cover the entire area, to prevent any changes from happening.

Fortunately, nothing unexpected happened on this trip and Qin Yu quickly felt the flow of internal Qi.

“Mr. Qin.”At that moment, the young man came before Qin Yu.

He cupped his hands together and said: “The fire country’s coast is just ahead. Do you think... . . You can go back on your own?”

Qin Yu shot him a glance and did not make things difficult for him as he nodded his head and said: “Alright.”

“Thank you, Mr. Qin!”The young man was immediately overjoyed as he cupped his hands together.

“Pass on a message to your sect leader for me.”Qin Yu said quietly.

“It’s best if you do not come and provoke me again, or I will definitely come and ask for your advice personally.”Qin Yu said coldly.

After throwing out those words, Qin Yu’s figure leapt up and jumped off the deck.

He stepped on the water and sped toward the shore.
