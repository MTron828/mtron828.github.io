“Okay, it’s a deal.” Qin Yu nodded.

The blue-haired man immediately waved his hand and shouted, “Bring me all the wine!”

Soon, ten bottles of foreign wine were placed in front of Qin Yu.

“These wines are all 43 percent alcohol. I won’t bully you. Just drink as much as I do.” The blue-haired man took two cups and placed them in front of Qin Yu.

At this moment, Chen Xin hurriedly ran to Qin Yu’s side and whispered, “Qin Yu, he can drink a lot. You have to be careful.”

Qin Yu ignored her. He looked at the blue-haired man and said, “Don’t use the cups. Let’s use the bottles.”

The blue-haired man was stunned. Then, he sneered and said, “Are you kidding me? This isn’t beer. Use the bottles?”

“What, you don’t have the guts to?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said.

“Why wouldn’t I have the guts to?!” The blue-haired man snorted and opened two bottles of wine. He handed one bottle to Qin Yu and held the other bottle himself.

“Bring it on. I want to see how you use the bottle.” The blue-haired man sized up Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony. He opened a bottle of wine and stuffed it into his mouth.

In just a few seconds, he emptied this bottle of foreign wine.

The people around were all stunned! Even the blue-haired man couldn’t help but swallow hard.

He had been frequenting nightclubs for so many years, this was the first time he had seen someone drink like this!

“It’s your turn.” Qin Yu looked at the blue-haired man and said with a nonchalant smile.

The blue-haired man braced himself and opened the bottle of wine. Then, he imitated Qin Yu and opened his mouth to drink it.

After half a minute, the blue-haired man finally drank the entire bottle of wine.

After he drank the bottle of wine, the blue-haired man’s expression turned ugly.

However, he had already boasted in front of yellow hair, so he couldn’t lose.

“Bring it on. Let’s continue drinking!” The blue-haired man wiped his mouth and shouted.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He opened the bottle of wine and drank another bottle.

The blue-haired man looked troubled.

He thought that Qin Yu was at his limit after drinking one bottle. He didn’t expect him to drink another bottle!

“It seems that he has met his opponent,” someone beside him said.

“Keep drinking. You can’t lose to him!”

“That’s right. If you lose, we will be humiliated!”

The blue-haired man had no choice but to grab the wine and pour it into his mouth again.

This time, it took the blue-haired man a full five minutes to finish the bottle of wine.

After he drank this bottle of wine, the blue-haired man’s face was completely flushed. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Do you still... still want to continue?” The blue-haired man seemed to be a little scared.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He opened a bottle of wine and drank it all in one gulp.

This time, the blue-haired man’s face turned ashen.

He drank three bottles of foreign wine in a row. After drinking it, he would probably have gastric lavage!

“If you don’t dare to, then just admit defeat,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Who... who doesn’t dare to?! I’ve never lost a drinking game before!” The blue-haired man gritted his teeth, grabbed the wine, and poured it into his mouth again.

But this time, the blue-haired man held the table as he started to vomit like crazy halfway through!

Qin Yu sneered at the side. He took a step back and said, “According to the agreement, you have to lie on the ground and bark like a dog. Do it.”

The blue-haired man vomited like crazy for a long time. He wiped his mouth, gritted his teeth, and said, “You must have cheated!”

“What? You can’t afford to lose?” Qin Yu sneered.

“F * ck you!” The blue-haired man cursed.

“F * ck off, or don’t blame me for being rude!” The blue-haired man grabbed the bottle and cursed.

Qin Yu didn’t want to argue with these punks, so he didn’t say anything. He grabbed Sun Ying and was ready to leave.

“Who the f * ck told you to take Sun Ying away? I told you to scram by yourself!” The blue-haired man cursed.

The yellow-haired man beside him waved his hand, and everyone in the room quickly stood up.

“Hurry up and scram. Don’t ruin our fun.” The yellow-haired man waved his hand and said.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “I didn’t ask you to bark like a dog, so shouldn’t you be thanking me? What, it’s bad enough that you’re a sore loser, but now you’re playing dirty with me?”

The yellow-haired guy smiled nonchalantly. “I’m sorry, but this is how we do things!”

“You actually expect me to bark like a dog? If you don’t leave now, I’ll make you bark like a dog!” The blue-haired guy held a wine bottle and pointed at Qin Yu’s nose as he scolded.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He suddenly smashed the wine bottle in the blue-haired guy’s hand!

Then, Qin Yu stretched out his hand and pressed it on the blue-haired guy’s shoulder!

In an instant, the blue-haired man felt immense weight, as if he was carrying two mountains on his shoulders. His legs went soft and he fell to the ground.

“Bark like a dog for me,” Qin Yu said as he looked at the blue-haired man coldly.

The blue-haired man hadn’t said anything yet when the blondie, who was at the side, flew into a rage!

“You actually dared to make a move? You’re digging your own grave!” the blondie snorted coldly.

Then, the blondie shouted, “Get him for me!”

Seven to eight young men instantly rushed towards Qin Yu.

“Yao Qing!” Qin Yu shouted, and Yao Qing immediately rushed out as quickly as an arrow!

In just a few minutes, these seven to eight young men were all lying on the ground while wailing non-stop!

When he saw this scene, the yellow-haired guy’s expression turned livid.

“There’s only you left. Do you want to lie down yourself, or do you want me to beat you down?” Yao Qing said while rubbing his fist.

The yellow-haired man gritted his teeth and said, “If you dare to beat me up here, you’re dead meat. My cousin is the manager here!”

“Yes, dude, go and call your cousin over quickly!” The blue-haired man also shouted.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to argue with these people. He walked in front of Sun Ying, pulled her up, and prepared to leave.

“What? Are you afraid?” The yellow-haired man hurriedly shouted.

“Let me tell you, you can run, but Sun Ying can’t run!”

“Sun Ying, if you dare to leave, I’ll screw you!” The blondie pointed at Sun Ying and shouted.

When he heard this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

He stopped in his tracks and looked at the blondie coldly. “Go and call your cousin over. I’ll wait here.”

“Okay, whoever leaves is a sucker!!” The blondie said and hurriedly ran out.

After he left, Chen Xin hurriedly ran to Qin Yu’s side and said with a worried expression, “Qin Yu, hurry up and leave. This KTV belongs to Lu Shuming. You just offended the Liu family. If you offend the Lu family again, you’ll be in trouble.”

“Lu Shuming’s?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but smile.

“What a coincidence. I’ll wait for him here.” Qin Yu immediately sat down on the sofa.

Chen Xin’s face was pale, and she was extremely worried.

She had never thought that things would come to this!

Soon, the yellow-haired man returned to the private room.

He kicked open the door of the private room and swaggered in. Behind him were seven to eight tattooed men.
