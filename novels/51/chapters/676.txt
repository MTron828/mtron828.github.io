Chapter 677: True Fire Was Only So-so! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Under the invasion of the flames, Qin Yu’s bones could no longer withstand it and began to break!

Qin Yu’s heart instantly thumped!

Things were bad!

“Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!!”

Following that, the sound of bones breaking could be heard from every part of his body!

One bone after another began to shatter!

The pain in his body became several times stronger!

“Oh no...” Qin Yu endured the pain and stared at the bones in every part of his body.

There wasn’t a single bone in his body that could withstand this flame!

At this moment, Qin Yu was completely in despair.

The Golden Core in his body began to be exposed, and this flame seemed to have divine sense as it headed straight for Qin Yu’s Golden Core!

“It’s over.” Qin Yu’s face instantly turned ashen.

The flame was still burning Qin Yu’s bones, breaking every inch of Qin Yu’s bones.

Qin Yu’s face was pale, and he didn’t hold any hope.

Time passed by minute by minute, and the flame wrapped around Qin Yu’s bones. No one knew how much time had passed.

Just as Qin Yu was in despair, he suddenly realized that the bones wrapped in the flame didn’t shatter any further!

Every inch of the bones was even slowly healing!

Qin Yu’s eyes instantly widened as he exclaimed, “There’s still hope!”

It was as if he had grabbed onto a life-saving straw as he hurriedly activated the spiritual energy in his body and did his best to recover his bones!

As expected, under the support of this spiritual energy, the shattered bones began to slowly heal!

Such a provocative action naturally infuriated the True Fire!

The flames immediately grew stronger and broke Qin Yu’s bones again!

“Kacha!” The sound of cracking could be heard continuously, and an intense pain was felt once again!

Qin Yu clenched his teeth. He circulated his spiritual power and tried his best to protect the bones.

Just like before, after the bones were broken, they didn’t continue to collapse!

Although the bones were wrapped in flames, things were in a stalemate for a moment!

In a moment, the bone shone and started to heal again!

“Great!” Qin Yu forgot about the pain for a moment and couldn’t help but shout out excitedly!

The few purple robes holding the handle above seemed to have heard this voice.

The three of them quickly surrounded the entrance of the fire pit and said with a frown, “Did you hear the voice? It seems to be Qin Yu’s voice.”

“Yes, this guy is indeed not dead.”

“Just wait here. The wailing just now is enough to show that he can’t take it anymore.”

Even though that was the case, the harsh environment in the desert made it difficult for them to take it.

Even though their cultivation was unparalleled, under the power of nature, their mouths and tongues were still dry.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

During these three days, Qin Yu’s bones were constantly breaking and healing time and time again.

Qin Yu was almost used to it.

He was even able to co-exist with this pain without fear!

Every time he healed, the intensity of this flame increased by a few points!

This wasn’t only strengthening his physical body, but also tempering Qin Yu’s will and spiritual sense!

Qin Yu sat cross-legged under the fire pit. He closed his eyes slightly and allowed the flames to sweep over his body.

Time passed day by day. In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.

The purple-robed men above seemed to be unable to hold it in any longer.

“If we continue to stay in such a harsh environment, I’m afraid we will die here.” One of them said with a frown.

“Yes, the inner strength in my body seems to be almost dried up. Such an environment is too terrifying.” The other person also nodded and said.

“Even we are suffering so much outside, let alone Qin Yu, who is under the fire pit. He has already died.”

In such an environment, the three people seemed to have the intention to retreat. They even wanted to leave.

“Let’s wait a little longer.” At this moment, the leader among the three said in a deep voice.

“We’ve already waited for so long. A few more days won’t make a difference. If we don’t see his corpse, no one will dare to make a hasty conclusion.”

The three of them had no choice but to continue waiting.

Under the fire pit, Qin Yu had already completely adapted.

And the intensity of the flame seemed to have reached its peak. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The speed of each healing process was also increasing.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but say proudly, “I’m not afraid of you anymore.”

The flame seemed to have understood Qin Yu’s provocative words and instantly became extremely agitated.

The flame crazily surged towards Qin Yu’s body, but it didn’t have the slightest effect.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh heartily. “Just this little bit of power? Tsk, looks like the so-called True Fire is only so-so, Hahaha!”

Right at this moment, Qin Yu’s bones had already completed the 836th healing process!

And after this healing, the True Fire was actually unable to break Qin Yu’s bones again!

His bones became incomparably tough and fierce, shining under the envelopment of the flames!

“Next, it’s time to recover my flesh and blood.” Qin Yu grinned.

He knew very clearly that this was also an extremely painful process, but as long as he endured it, he would be able to push through!

“Clatter...”

Flesh and blood began to grow on Qin Yu’s bones.

The moment the flesh and blood grew, it would be vaporized by the flames.

However, Qin Yu wasn’t discouraged. He continued to recover his flesh and blood.

Once, twice, thrice...

Qin Yu’s flesh and blood were vaporized. Gradually, it became that it would take several seconds to melt. In the later stages, the flames could only roast Qin Yu’s flesh and blood, and couldn’t vaporize it.

In the blink of an eye, another half a month had passed.

Qin Yu’s body had also recovered by more than half.

His recovered body had turned golden. Even if he didn’t use the Saintly Body Technique, his body was still incomparably tough and fierce!

Above, the three purple-robed men had already thought of retreating.

“This guy is already dead. We can leave now,” one of the purple-robed men stood up and said.

After enduring for an entire month, he could no longer endure it!

The two purple-robed men looked at the leader at the same time, waiting for him to give the order to leave.

“Wait for another three days. It’s the last three days!” The leader said coldly.

“If he doesn’t appear after three days, then we will leave this place.”

“Is there still a need? After staying under the True Fire for an entire month, no one can withstand it.” The other person frowned.

The leader glanced at him and coldly said, “This guy is someone who forcefully broke through the stairway to heaven. With him, anything is possible.”

Seeing this, the three of them could only nod and agree.

...

Below, Qin Yu’s body was completely healed.

He was walking in the True Fire and was actually not eroded at all!

Although the flames attempted to devour Qin Yu, they were unable to harm him in the slightest.

“True Fire... I really have to thank you.” Qin Yu looked at his body, which was flickering with golden light, and couldn’t help but laugh.

The flames were once again enraged, making loud whooshing sounds in the windless land.

Qin Yu laughed heartily and said, “Hahaha, there’s no need to be angry, because... anger is useless!”

After saying these words, Qin Yu’s feet shook, and he jumped towards the fire pit!
