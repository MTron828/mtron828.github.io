Chapter 1297: Chapter 1297, revisiting the old place 

Ling Yun narrowed his eyes, seemingly satisfied with this suggestion.

Not only that, Ling Yun had always been hostile towards Di Zun.

The reason was because Di Zun’s numbers on the god testing stone were even higher than his!

This undoubtedly meant that Di zun was very likely to replace him in the future!

...

Qin Yu spent two days quietly leaving Green Rock Forest.

He returned to his old place and returned to Gu City.

This city extended in all directions and the seal had long been lifted. There were countless treasures and many important figures would come here to search for treasures. It was the most suitable place for Qin Yu.

“Let’s Find a place and recover from my injuries,”Qin Yu thought to himself. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He covered his face and found a pharmacy to treat his injuries.

What surprised Qin Yu was that the pharmacist of this pharmacy had to use external objects to make a fire in order to refine medicine. Even their master was only a red-colored spiritual fire!

This red-colored spiritual fire was well-known in the local area, which made Qin Yu extremely puzzled.

After all, this was the holy region, and there were countless cultivators here. How could spiritual fire be so rare?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu pulled the pharmacist and said, “You have such a big pharmacy, but you don’t even have spiritual fire?”

Displeasure flashed across the pharmacist’s face. He said somewhat impatiently, “If you don’t like our medical skills, then change the place.”

Qin Yu was not angry. He smiled and said, “I’m just curious. I don’t have any other intentions.”

After saying this, Qin Yu took out ten spirit coins from the card and handed it to the pharmacist.

After the pharmacist took it, his expression instantly became much gentler.

He smiled and said, “If there was a spiritual fire, who would still be in a place like this? I don’t know how many sects would fight over it. I heard that there’s a huge pile of purple spiritual fire in the Central Plains!”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “In other words, the pharmacist of the purple spiritual fire basically gathered in the Central Plains?”

“That’s not necessarily the case. After all, the holy region is so big. Many people will never be able to go to the central plains in their entire lives,”the pharmacist explained.

Hearing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

The current Qin Yu didn’t have spiritual energy, so he couldn’t use spiritual fire at all. It was useless to ask any more questions.

“By the way, how long will it take for my injuries to recover?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

The pharmacist glanced at Qin Yu’s injuries and said, “Your external injuries are quite severe. I’m afraid it will take ten days to half a month.”

“Alright, thank you,”Qin Yu replied.

After the pharmacist left, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

It wasn’t just Ling Yun who didn’t want to let Qin Yu off. Qin Yu didn’t want to let Ling Yun off either.

He had instructed Jin Lun to kill the team leader. Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t forget this enmity.

“After my injuries recover, I would like to see so for myself the abilities of the number one genius of the South Province,”Qin Yu snorted in his heart.

In the next few days, Qin Yu tried to comprehend the sixth level of the DOU character technique while recuperating.

However, comprehending the sixth level was too difficult. Qin Yu spent an entire week without making any progress.

After a few more days, the injuries on Qin Yu’s body had almost recovered.

He stood up and shook his arm. He felt that his entire body was filled with strength.

Since his injuries had already recovered, Qin Yu did not need to hide his identity anymore.

He simply tore off his cover and threw it aside, swaggering out.

“How much is it?”Qin Yu asked the pharmacist.

The pharmacist raised his head and glanced at Qin Yu, saying, “Three hundred spirit coins.”

After Qin Yu paid the money, he turned around and was about to leave.

At this moment, the pharmacist suddenly pulled Qin Yu back.

He sized up Qin Yu from head to toe and asked doubtfully, “You... you look a little familiar. Have we met before?”

“You should have seen me, but I definitely haven’t seen you before,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

At this moment, Qin Yu caught a glimpse of a wanted notice in the corner from the corner of his eyes.

“That’s not it. I’m sticking it there.”Qin Yu pointed at the wanted notice, then turned around and walked out.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally went to the stone gambling shop.

Since he had already offended the owner of the stone gambling shop, he was not afraid to continue offending him.

Qin Yu stepped into the stone gambling shop and continued to rely on the desolate divine eye to amass wealth in the stone gambling shop.

In less than an hour, Qin Yu had already earned over a million.

But this speed still made Qin Yu feel somewhat dissatisfied.

If life force appeared in an auction, Qin Yu would have to pay a high price to buy it. In that case, he would need a large amount of spirit coins to support him.

At this moment, the people around looked at Qin Yu with a strange expression.

The atmosphere around them also became more and more strange.

Many people sneaked out, as if they recognized Qin Yu’s identity and wanted to report it.

“Kacha!”

At this moment, the door suddenly closed!

Following that, eight people walked out from the dark!

Among these eight people, two were mighty figures and six were at the peak of the nascent Soul Stage!

The young man in the lead was none other than the son of the stone gambling shop owner!

The stone gambling shop owner had died at the hands of Ling Yun. He didn’t have the ability to seek revenge on Ling Yun, so he naturally wanted to put the blame on Qin Yu.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Brat, how Dare You Come Here?”

Qin Yu wasn’t flustered at all. He pointed at a raw stone and said, “Bring me that raw stone.”

“Hahahaha!”

Hearing this, the young master of the stone gambling shop couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“You’re about to die, and you still want to gamble on Stone? Is there any meaning?”The young master sneered.

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “You’re right. It’s still too slow to get money like this.”

Therefore, Qin Yu simply stood up and looked at the young master of the stone gambling shop.

“Take out all the money you have here!”Qin Yu said coldly.
