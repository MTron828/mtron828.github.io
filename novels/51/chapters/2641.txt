Chapter 2642: Saint Kingdom Order Consciousness

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Tears of blood seeped from his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, and an angry roar echoed from the void.

This furious roar could be heard by all living beings above the True Consciousness. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Conversely, living beings of the Confused Consciousness and Human Consciousness levels didn’t sense anything.

“Who has touched the core order of the Saint Kingdom? Are they trying to kill

In the endless fog, a black-robed skeleton emitted a shrill cry.

Under the angry roar, several deep cracks appeared on the skeletal frame of the necromancer Seifer.

This outburst of anger from the core order of the Saint Kingdom inflicted massive damage upon it.

At this moment, nearly everyone within the vast Saint Kingdom sensed this anger.

“Who exactly is it that dares to pry into the core order of the Saint Kingdom and still survive? Otherwise, the heavens and earth wouldn’t be so enraged.” A village cmer witn a large liar-cop naircuc lea a little DOY, ms race also showing a puzzled and uncertain expression.

This village chief was the person Qin Yu had encountered when first arriving at the village. He was the outermost village tasked with testing outsiders. Later, Qin Yu issued an order that defied the rules, allowing him to be exempted from the power of erasure. Now, his face was pale, devoid of the jovial expression from before.

Pang De and Wu Tian’s expressions changed drastically. They looked at Qin Yu in disbelief.

“Impossible!”

Pang De roared. His current strength was extremely diminished, less than one percent of his peak.

He had once been an ultimate genius, coming to this Saint Kingdom as an outsider and even creating the Avici Dao’s Three Sabers here.

However, he suffered the backlash of the core order, turning his saber technique into a demonic one that controlled him.

This left him in a daze, becoming a puppet of the Saint Kingdom. Seeing the Saint Kingdom’s reaction, everyone knew the change was caused by that young man, prompting Pang De to involuntarily release a heaven-shaking roar.

Wu Tian also had a trickle of blood at the corner of his mouth, though it seemed to glow with a red light, appearing very strange. He stared at Qin Yu with a thoughtful expression.

At this moment, a black saber emerged in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. It was a saber filled with despair, containing the most brutal core order of the Saint Kingdom, capable of severing all hope.

However, compared to the previous Dao Saber’s Avici Dao’s Three Sabers, this black saber was only in its embryonic form. Nevertheless, the mere simulation emitted a world-destroying internal qi. That terrifying internal qi sought to directly annihilate Qin Yu’s divine sense.

The power of this Order of Saint Kingdom was truly terrifying, stopping beside Qin Yu without any qualms. It knew Qin Yu would inevitably perish, allowing his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze to capture the embryonic form.

Then Qin Yu, with strong determination, voluntarily sought death and activated the memory of the Seal of Heaven Returning to the Heart of the Saint Kingdom.

This prevented him from becoming a prisoner controlled by the Order of the Saint Kingdom. At this moment, although this black rules order was only in its embryonic form, its terrifying power was like a suppressed volcano.

It was on the verge of completely erupting in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, annihilating the individual who dared to spy on it.

Qin Yu felt the fluctuation of the core order at this moment. He could sense that under the influence of the saber of rules, his divine soul was beginning to change.

Just like the previous experience of receiving a dao lecturer, the originally extreme soul power could once again accommodate a vast amount of holy energy, thereby strengthening his soul power.

Force!

Although this order of rules wasn’t enough for him to fully comprehend immediately, he could already exert his ‘force’ according to this law, similar to Ming Xie and others.

However, this ‘force’ was much stronger than theirs. He seemed to be able to hear a clear sound emanating from his divine soul as if he had broken free from shackles. At this moment, he had directly surpassed the limits of Human Consciousness and reached the True Consciousness Realm.

The world before him seemed to have changed. At this moment, the Seal of Heaven Returning was joyfully pulsating within his body.

Qin Yu observed a bright energy link between his divine soul and the Heart of Saint Kingdom, the Seal of Heaven Returning. A sense of connectedness surged into his heart.

This was the power of the Seal of Heaven Returning!

Qin Yu suddenly comprehended. No wonder Immortal Emperor Yao had told him that one must reach the True Consciousness Realm to wield the power of the Heart of the Saint Kingdom.

If one’s cultivation realm hadn’t reached the True Consciousness Realm and their soul hadn’t been baptized by the rules of the Saint Kingdom, they wouldn’t be able to harness the power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom.

At this moment, Qin Yu could feel that he could only access a small portion of the Heart of Saint Kingdom’s power. Nevertheless, it was sufficient!

“Heart of Saint Kingdom, suppress!”

Just as the black saber in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness was about to explode, the power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom suddenly pressed towards it from all directions.

This was a power possessed only by the Lord of a Saint Kingdom, although not very potent.

However, it caused the black saber derived from the core order of the Heart of

Saint Kingdom to suddenly fall silent.

It let out an unwilling roar and gradually quieted down.

“What a terrifying Order of the Saint Kingdom!”

Although the black saber was no longer restless, Qin Yu could still perceive it lying dormant like a tiger.

Once this force was activated, the black saber would unleash its destructive energy.

“If you give me three slashes, I’ll return the favor with a punch.”

Qin Yu looked at Pang De and clenched his fist.

The Heart of the Saint Kingdom in his dantian emitted a faint light. A stream of energy suddenly descended on his hand like a meteor.

As he punched Pang De, the power of the Saint Kingdom surged! Even if it was just a trace, it was more than Pang De could withstand in his current state.

With a punch, Pang De’s body was engulfed in flames, emitting a charred smell.

“It’s your turn.”

After incapacitating Pang De with a single punch, Qin Yu aimed another punch at Wu Tian with the power of Saint Kingdom.

Wu Tian narrowed his eyes. A black lotus suddenly appeared in front of him.

A surge of power emanated from the black lotus heart, clashing with the power of Saint Kingdom. The two forces were extinguished instantly.

Then, the black lotus emitted another wave of power, extinguishing the power of Saint Kingdom on Pang De’s body.

“To be able to withstand the power of the core order of the Saint Kingdom, even though it is the power of the Saint Kingdom, and to control a portion of it in such a short time is beyond my imagination. Now, you are qualified to work with me.”

Wu Tian nodded.

“How?”

Qin Yu was astonished to see Wu Tian eliminate the power of Saint Kingdom without a sound.

The power of Saint Kingdom should have a strong restraining effect on the natives here..
