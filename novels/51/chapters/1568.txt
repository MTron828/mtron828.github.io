Chapter 1569: Chapter 1,569, great battle against the Sect Master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect sat cross-legged under the tree with his back facing everyone. He did not say a word.

The three godly monarchs looked at each other and immediately said with a sneer, “It’s said that you fought in all directions back then and flattened all the sects in the South Province. Your strength is unparalleled. The three of us really want to see so for myself.”

However, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect still did not say a word.

This made the three of them extremely displeased. This was simply not putting them in their eyes!

“What? You Don’t dare to face us? !”One of the Godly monarchs roared!

This voice contained powerful spiritual power. A terrifying internal Qi rolled over, shaking the entire cultivation mountain! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Finally, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect took the initiative.

He slowly stood up and then slowly turned around.

Looking at the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect in front of them, the three people could not help but narrow their eyes.

“You finally dare to face us.”One of the godly monarchs said with a sneer.

The sect master sighed slightly and then said, “The three godly monarchs of the northern lands, you actually barged into this place.”

“Hahahaha, why? Are you very surprised?”One of them said with a hint of ridicule.

......

The sect master shook his head and said, “You are forcing me to make a move.”

“Hahahahahahaha! So what if I force you to make a move! Today is the Day You Die!”

Accompanied by a godly king’s loud shout, he suddenly stretched out his palm and headed straight for the sect master!

“Boom!”

Both parties exchanged palms and swept out with residual power!

The Godly king who made a move took a few steps back, and his expression immediately became somewhat ugly.

“The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect indeed lives up to his reputation,”said the godly king coldly.

“Unfortunately, you will still die here today!”

With that said, the three of them looked at each other and immediately attacked together. They headed straight for the sect master!

In an instant, the cultivation mountain was in a state of turmoil. Light filled the sky as streams of extremely powerful auras shook the already dilapidated heavenly cloud sect to the point of internal Qi!

“The strength of these three people is extremely terrifying. I wonder if sect master can hold on.”

“Sect master is invincible under the heavens. They are definitely not a match for him!”

Even though that was the case, they were all sweating in their hearts.

The strength of these three people’s internal Qi was something they had never seen before!

This battle had been going on from day to night, and it was difficult to determine the victor.

In the distance, small mountains were constantly collapsing. Large swaths of void fell off, revealing a pitch-black radiance.

The sect master of the heavenly cloud sect had a robust figure. He shuttled between the three people. Each palm strike contained a DAO technique and laws!

The earth was collapsing. The bright radiance illuminated the night into day. The entire cultivation mountain was about to be shattered!

The three godly monarchs were more and more shocked as they fought. The strength of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect had far exceeded their imagination!

A thick fog rose up from the Cultivation Mountain, obscuring their vision. Although the sect master was powerful, it was still somewhat difficult for him to face the three top-notch martial artist from the northern lands.

“Today will be the day you die!”

A godly monarch roared loudly. His entire body emitted a black fog!

This black fog appeared out of nowhere. The power it contained was extremely strange. In an instant, it enveloped the sect master!

The other godly monarch opened his mouth and spat out a black flower. This flower contained a terrifying and strange power. It hung above the sect master’s head as if it wanted to suppress him!

The last godly monarch was not willing to be outdone. With a furious roar, densely packed pieces of flesh appeared on his body. These pieces of flesh fell off from his body and eventually turned into several figures!

The three of them unleashed powerful spells at the same time. For a moment, the sect master had nowhere to hide!

The strangest thing was the black flower hanging above his head. This flower contained immense power and was constantly crushing the sect master’s body!

However, the sect master remained extremely calm. His moves looked extremely elegant. With a raise of his hand, a DAO technique followed. Every palm carried an icy-blue internal QI. It looked like it was mixed together, but it was also extremely terrifying!

Boundless power enveloped this piece of land, and the Heavenly Cloud sect seemed to have welcomed the darkest moment.

It was unknown how many people had been attracted by this great battle. After so many years, this was the first time they had seen the sect leader make a move!

“Is this the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect leader? With a raise of his hand, he already contained laws. It’s too terrifying.”

“That’s right, those three people are also not to be underestimated. Just the residual power makes our hearts palpitate.”

“It will probably be difficult to determine the victor of this battle in a short period of time.”

Just as they had guessed, the battle continued for three days and three nights, but there was still no result!

The three of them had suffered different injuries. The most miserable godly monarch had half of his body torn apart by the sect master with his bare hands!

Looking at the sect master again, he was also in a bad mood. His body was covered in bloodstains. What was most shocking was that his body seemed to be turning dim.

This was a sign of his death. From the looks of it, the sect master of the Tianyun sect was about to lose!

“Hahahaha, so what if you are the sect master of the Tianyun Sect? Today will be the Day You Die!”The three godly monarchs were extremely excited! ? If they killed the sect master of the South Prefecture’s Tianyun sect, then their might would definitely shake the world. At that time, who in the South Prefecture would dare to go against the northern lands! ?

The surrounding crowd also sensed the signs of the sect master’s decline, and their expressions were extremely unsightly.

They wanted to lend a hand, but a wisp of residual might from the cultivation mountain was enough to kill them!

This was a battle between top-notch martial artist, and it wasn’t something that ordinary people could interfere with!

“Hong!”

Another palm descended, and the entire cultivation mountain finally couldn’t hold on any longer, and began to turn into rubble!

Sect Master’s body dimmed once again, as though he was going to disappear at any moment!

“Ah! ! !”

A godly king raised his head and roared angrily. It was as though he had summoned a godly spirit as a massive statue condensed behind his back.

The statue had a life of its own. Every action of its carried godly power.

The godly spirit raised its hand and smacked at sect master. Sect master waved his hand to meet the attack.

With this collision, sect master retreated a few steps while his body once again thought to itself.

The godly king was panting heavily. Half of his body had already been shattered. It was an extremely horrifying sight.

The sect master lowered his head and looked at his dark body. He could not help but sigh.

“Are you still going to disappear...”the sect master muttered in a low voice.

“Hahaha, I admit that your strength is above ours. Unfortunately, you are not a match for the three of us!”A godly king roared.

The sect master ignored him. He raised his palm and slowly moved it in the void.

In the next second, a huge black hole condensed in front of him!

It was the Rashomon! The Rashomon of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master!

Following the appearance of the Rashomon, these three godly monarchs were immediately entangled by a huge suction force! And their bodies were also heading towards the Rashomon Cave!

“Not good!”

The three of them immediately had a bad feeling! They struggled with all their might, but found that they couldn’t break free at all!

“Save... Save Me!”

The godly monarch whose half of his body had been torn apart was the first to receive the impact. His body was floating towards the Rashomon at an extremely fast speed!
