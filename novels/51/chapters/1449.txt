Chapter 1450: Chapter 1,450: The Furious Qin Yu

Yong Ji pretended to be surprised and said, “Don’t you know? Not long ago, the great elder ordered to kill one of your friends.”

Qin Yu’s face suddenly changed! He subconsciously grabbed Yong Ji’s arm and said, “A friend of mine? which friend? Who Did you hear it from?”

Yong Ji thought for a moment and said, “I think it’s called Zhen Yue. hasn’t this matter been spread? So you don’t know about it?”

Qin Yu froze on the spot, and a trace of anger appeared in his eyes.

“Zhen Yue... is dead?”Qin Yu couldn’t believe it.

He had promised to open a sect for Zhen Yue, but he didn’t expect that he couldn’t even save her life!

“Heavenly Cloud Sect...”Qin Yu clenched her teeth, and her anger almost made him lose his mind.

Yong Ji patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and sighed. “The Heavenly Cloud sect is the only sect in the entire South Province. No one can do anything to them. Forget it.”

Qin Yu stood there for a long time without saying anything. He was extremely sad.

He did not know about this at all and no one had ever told him about it.

When Yong Ji saw this, he raised his hand and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder. Then, he turned around and left.

After waiting for him to leave for a long time, Qin Yu finally regained his senses.

Without a word, he headed towards the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Where are you going?”

At this moment, Jue Wu suddenly stretched out her hand and blocked Qin Yu’s path.

Qin Yu turned back to look at Jue Wu and said, “I’m going to kill the Great Elder. I want the Heavenly Cloud sect to pay the price.”

However, Jue Wu said with a dark expression, “With your current state, are you going to send yourself to death?”

“The Heavenly Cloud Sect’s strength is not something you can imagine. You Can’t even handle a demon subduing divine lamp. What’s the difference between going and dying?”

Qin Yu did not say a word. He quickly calmed down.

The current Qin Yu was no longer that rash person. Just as Jue Wu had said, going now was also courting death.

He took a deep breath and turned to look at Jue Wu. He nodded and said, “You’re right. If I go now, I can only die.”

Jue Wu nodded slightly and said, “That’s not bad. If you really want to take revenge, then hurry up and cultivate.”

Qin Yu nodded. He looked at Jue Wu and said, “I will be in closed-door cultivation for a month. During this one month, I hope nothing will disturb me.”

At the same time, he also gave the great elder a month to rest and recuperate. This time, Qin Yu wanted to kill him personally.

After that, Qin Yu turned around and walked towards the top of the mountain.

He came all the way to Jue Wu’s cultivation room and sat down cross-legged.

The spiritual energy in this place was extremely rich. There was naturally no need to say anything about Jue Wu’s cultivation place.

As the pores all over Qin Yu’s body opened, threads of spiritual energy surged towards Qin Yu like a spring.

This was an extremely fast speed. Qin Yu was like a vast ocean, receiving the rivers from the world.

And at this moment, Jue Wu’s face was full of worry.

“Aunt Jue Wu, What’s wrong with you?”Wen da mumbled as he chewed on the leg of lamb.

Jue Wu opened her mouth and was about to speak, but when he saw that it was Wen da, he waved his hand and said, “Forget it. Even if I told you, you wouldn’t understand.”

Wen da muttered, “Why wouldn’t I understand? I’m not a fool.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jue Wu ignored Master Wen. She knew that Master Wen didn’t know much about the cultivation world.

“Master Jue Wu, are you worried about Yongji?”Zhuo Jing suddenly asked.

Jue Wu looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Ai, it doesn’t count... you said that Yongji is so capable and has more than a hundred foster sons under him. Why hasn’t he made a move against the Tianyun sect?”

Zhuo Jing said with some surprise, “You suspect Mister Yong Ji?”

“I’m not suspecting. I’m just curious.”Jue Wu waved his hand, as if he didn’t want to continue this topic.

Zhuo Jing didn’t continue asking when he saw this.

...

Heavenly Cloud sect.

First Elder was seriously injured. Even if they had the best alchemist, they still needed to recuperate for a very long time.

Jue Wu’s attack was too heavy. First Elder could hardly see his human form. If the Heavenly Cloud sect did not have a life-saving pill, first elder would probably have died.

“I really did not expect that this lunatic Jue Wu would suddenly make a move.”The deputy sect leader stood in front of First Elder’s bed and could not help but frown.

“It is already good enough to be able to keep his life.”Another elder beside him said.

“I’m afraid that the first elder can’t take over the Tianyun sect in his current state. The deputy sect master should manage it from now on,”another elder suggested.

The deputy sect master had already intended to do so. If the sect master hadn’t set the rules, he would have taken over the position long ago.

“This kind of thing isn’t something that you and I can decide. It’s better to go and report it to the sect master,”the deputy sect master said indifferently.

He was very clear in his heart that the sect master absolutely had no reason to refuse, unless he ended his closed door cultivation.

The deputy sect master walked all the way to the sect master’s closed door cultivation place.

The environment here was not inferior to the absolute dance’s cultivation room. It was even more superior.

Standing at the entrance, one could see a person sitting under the tree in the distance.

His back was facing the entrance. Threads of spiritual energy were surging into his body.

The deputy sect master cupped his hands and shouted, “Sect master, I have something important to report!”

However, the sect master did not react.
