1897 Mine Is the Correct Path

Qin Yu didn’t get angry. He smiled at Si Shifeng and the others and said, “Why don’t you guys follow me? I can give you some of the treasures I get.”

Upon hearing this, everyone laughed and looked at Qin Yu as if he was a fool.

“Boasting shamelessly! Such a shameless ruffian really makes me feel like laughing,” Yi Shifeng sneered and said.

The two Masters of Path of Heaven looked at Qin Yu coldly and scolded, “Shut your d*mned mouth. If you dare to disturb us from deducing the Path of Heaven again, don’t blame us for being impolite!

!!

Qin Yu didn’t want to argue with them. He closed his eyes slightly and planned to find a suitable path.

The scene of the sanctum soon appeared in his mind.

At a glance, he was as if overlooking the entire sanctum. It was very clear.

Just as the two Masters of Path of Heaven had predicted, an irregular killing formation was in front of them. It was very difficult to deduce.

“The two old fellows are quite capable,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu then began to look out from the map at how to get through the irregular killing formation.

Although this killing formation was said to be irregular, it was not impossible to pass, nor was it really irregular.

It was because the entire Path of Heaven was formed by the rules of order. The so-called irregular was only aimed at the deduction of cultivators.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and slowly deduced the way forward in his mind.

He tried to use his thought to pass through the irregular killing formation many times but was fallen into the killing formation repeatedly.

It was indeed a long process. Not only Qin Yu, but the two Masters of Path of Heaven heavenly Dao Masters were also tremendously exhausted.

“Hmph! Pretentious.”

Si Shifeng couldn’t help but say sarcastically when he saw Qin Yu’ close his eyes.

Yan Yunfan, who was standing at the side, also sneered.

When he found out Qin Yu also had a chaotic body, he was a little concerned. After all, once a chaotic body was completed, he would be incredibly powerful.

However, after seeing Qin Yu’s various behaviors, his concern was dispelled.

What could a fool achieve? In the end, he would just become a stepping stone for them, who were heaven’s favorites.

As time passed, Qin Yu had already tried 1,324 times in his mind but failed each time.

It indeed took a long time to explore slowly.

The two Masters of Path of Heaven had also spent a long time, but they still couldn’t find a suitable path.

It took an entire day and night.

Saintess Gu and the others started to feel tired and even started to feel anxious.

Qin Yu finally found a way to get through the killing formation successfully after deducing it for the 13,000th time.

“Finally,” Qin Yu opened his eyes and heaved a sigh of relief.

Just as he was about to get up, the two Masters of Path of Heaven beside him suddenly opened their eyes!

The deduction of the Path of Heaven had a tremendous impact on them, for not only did it consume their spiritual energy and primordial spirit, but it also consumed their lifespans.

After deducing the dao technique of this killing formation, the two Masters of Path of Heaven had obviously aged a little.

“How is it? Have you succeeded?” Si Shifeng took the lead to ask.

One of the Masters of Path of Heaven nodded slightly and said, “Yes, but this deduction will probably consume hundreds of years of our lifespan.”

“Please rest assured, Master of Path of Heaven. As long as you can successfully pass through this sanctum, we will definitely reward you greatly after this,” said Yan Yunfan beside him.

“With Mr. Yan’s words, we can be at ease,” the two Masters of Path of Heaven said.

At this moment, Si Shifeng looked at Qin Yu, who was not far away.

“How’s your deduction going, kid?” he asked with a hint of mockery. “Don’t tell me your deduction happened to be successful at this time?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and couldn’t help cursing in his heart.

D*mn it, what a coincidence!

“That’s right. I have indeed deduced a path,” Qin Yu said honestly.

Upon hearing this, a few of them burst into laughter.

Even Saintess Gu couldn’t help but shake her head.

“Kid, if I’m not wrong, the path you deduced is the same as ours, right?” Si Shifeng continued to mock.

Qin Yu was not angry. He smiled and said, “If the two elders’ deduction is correct, it must be the same as yours.”

“Hahaha!” The crowd couldn’t hold it in anymore, and cheerful laughter came from the sanctum.

Yan Yunfan said impatiently, “Don’t talk any more nonsense with him. Serious matters are more important. Let’s go.”

“Mr. Yan, what about this kid?” said Si Shifeng as he pointed at Qin Yu.

Yan Yunfan glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Don’t worry about him. If he wants to follow us, let him be. As long as he can take the risk, it’s his ability.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After saying this, Yan Yunfan no longer paid attention to Qin Yu. He followed the two Masters of Path of Heaven and stepped into the irregular killing formation.

Qin Yu didn’t waste time and walked in according to the path he deduced.

As soon as he stepped into the killing formation, he could feel waves of intense killing intent.

The sky was dusky, and killing intent was everywhere. Any wisp of it would easily take a person’s life. Therefore, everyone was extremely cautious, even though the Masters of Path of Heaven were following them.

It was the same for Qin Yu. He did not dare to underestimate this killing formation either. He could only advance step by step and walk carefully in the killing formation.

As expected, the path Qin Yu had deduced was precisely the same as the two Masters of Path of Heaven. The path they took was the same as well.

...

The two elders were indeed quite capable, but this also made Si Shifeng and the others look down on Qin Yu even more.

After walking for a long time, everyone was extremely nervous. They sweated profusely on the foreheads as they walked in the killing formation.

At this moment, a fork in the road suddenly appeared in front of them.

There were two paths here that led in two different directions.

The crowd quickly stopped in their tracks and looked at the Masters of Path of Heaven.

“Which path should we take?” Yan Yunfan frowned and said.

The two Masters of Path of Heaven were silent for a moment. At this moment, one of them stood up and said, “If my deduction is correct, we should take the path on the right. After passing through this path, the killing formation will end.”

“Alright.” Yan Yunfan didn’t talk nonsense and immediately started walking.

“I have a different opinion,” Qin Yu suddenly spoke at this moment.

Yan Yunfan furrowed his brows and turned to look at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu pointed at the path on the left and said, “This is the correct path. If we take the right path, the killing formation will not end.”

...

“Hahaha!” Si Shifeng couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Kid, act like one if you want to take advantage. Don’t pretend you know when you don’t,” Si Shifeng mocked without restraint.
