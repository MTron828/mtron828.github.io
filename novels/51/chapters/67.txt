Chapter 68: Go Find Mr. Qin! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Yao Qing and instructed, “Go and buy a box of silver needles for me.”

“silver needles?” Yao Qing froze. “Mr. Qin, why do you need silver needles?”

Qin Yu forced a smile. “I’m afraid that silver needles will be needed for this treatment.”

When Yao Qing heard that, he couldn’t help but sigh. “The Wei family doesn’t believe you, yet you still plan to save them. Mr. Qin, you are a true doctor!”

Qin Yu waved his hand and didn’t say anything else.

At this time, in the Wei family’s bedroom, Xu Maojun was reprimanding Wei Jiang.

“Mr. Wei, I made an exception for you. If it were anyone else, I would have left long ago!” Xu Maojun said angrily.

“Yes, yes, yes... Doctor Xu, please treat my wife’s illness...” Wei Jiang said with a smile.

Xu Maojun snorted as he said, “Don’t worry, I know what to do.”

“Also,” said Xu Maojun while pausing for a moment.

“We agreed on a million yuan for the consultation fee, right? Now, you have to pay more!” Said Xu Maojun with a cold expression.

Wei Jiang’s expression changed, and he said awkwardly, “Doctor Xu, it’s not appropriate to pay more at this time, right? And I...”

“If you don’t pay more, I’ll leave right now!” Xu Maojun pretended he was about to leave.

Wei Jiang hurriedly grabbed Xu Maojun and nodded. “Okay, okay, I promise you. I’ll raise it to as much as you say!”

“That’s more like it. Then give me another one million,” Xu Maojun said indifferently.

“Okay, one million it is!” This amount of money was nothing to Wei Jiang, so he agreed straightforwardly.

“Then go and transfer the money. What are you waiting for?” Xu Maojun rolled his eyes.

Wei Jiang frowned and said, “Doctor Xu, can you treat my wife’s illness first?”

“That won’t do! What if you don’t pay when the illness is cured?” Xu Maojun snorted and said.

Wei Jiang couldn’t help but curse Xu Maojun a hundred times in his mind! But he had no other choice but to agree.

“Wei Hang, go and transfer the money to Doctor Xu!” Wei Jiang gritted his teeth and said.

“It’s all Qin Yu’s fault. He made us waste a million yuan for nothing,” Wei Hang couldn’t help but complain.

After saying that, Wei Hang hurriedly left the house.

Wei Jiang stood by the bed impatiently. Looking at his wife, who was suffering on the bed, he was even more anxious.

“Don’t worry. Everything is under my control,” Xu Maojun said nonchalantly.

In the blink of an eye, an hour had passed. Wei Hang finally rushed back.

“The money has been transferred,” said Wei Hang, panting heavily.

Xu Maojun took out his phone to check and nodded with satisfaction.

He took out a small bottle of medicine and handed it to Mrs. Wei while saying, “Drink this.”

Mrs. Wei looked extremely weak, even a little delirious.

In a daze, she took the bottle, opened her mouth with difficulty, and swallowed the medicine.

“Honey, how do you feel?” Wei Jiang hurriedly asked.

Mrs. Wei opened her mouth but didn’t say anything.

But from her expression, it was obvious that she wasn’t feeling very good.

“Don’t worry, it won’t act that fast,” Xu Maojun said.

“Even if it’s a special medicine, it’ll take at least half an hour for it to take effect. Wait for it.”

Although Wei Jiang was extremely worried, he could only nod his head.

“Go and pour me a pot of water. I’m thirsty.” Xu Maojun waved his hand and said.

“Quickly go and pour water for Doctor Xu!” Wei Jiang ordered.

Wei Hang quickly ran out and took out the tea leaves that he had treasured for many years and made a pot of tea for Xu Maojun.

Xu Maojun sat by the bed and drank tea while waiting.

Wei Jiang and Wei Hang could only accompany him.

“This tea isn’t bad,” Xu Majun said.

Wei Jiang forced a smile and said, “Only you can cure my wife’s illness, Doctor Xu. I’ll buy more tea leaves for you in the future.”

“Hehe, thank you very much, Mr. Wei.” Xu Majun nodded in satisfaction. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Time passed minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, half an hour had passed.

During this time, Wei Jiang had been staring at the clock. When the time was up, he rushed to the bedside and asked, “Wife, how are you feeling now?”

Mrs. Wei’s complexion became even paler. Perhaps because of the pain, her expression became a little distorted.

She opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but in the next second, she fainted.

“Honey!”

“Mom!”

Seeing this, the father and son rushed over and hugged Mrs. Wei tightly!

“Honey, what’s wrong? Wake up!” Wei Jiang said in a panic.

But no matter how he shouted, Mrs. Wei didn’t respond.

“What’s going on? Didn’t you say that it would take half an hour to take effect?” Wei Hang turned around angrily and grabbed Xu Maojun’s collar!

Xu Maokun’s expression was also a little ugly. He said with a flustered expression, “I... I don’t know either. Maybe... maybe it will take a while to take effect...”

“Wait my *ss!” Wei Hang clenched his fist angrily and punched Xu Maokun!

“Stop hitting him!” At this time, Wei Jiang suddenly shouted.

“Hurry up and find Mr. Qin. Go and invite him back!”

Only then did Wei Hang come to his senses. He released Xu Maojun and pointed at his nose while saying, “Just you wait!”
