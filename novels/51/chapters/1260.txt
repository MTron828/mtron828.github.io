Chapter 1261: Chapter 1,261, silver-armored protector 

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold. He had not expected this young man to be so sinister.

But now was not the time to think about this. He immediately turned around and planned to escape.

But at this moment, rays of light rose in all directions, instantly enveloping the entire mansion and blocking Qin Yu’s path.

“You want to escape?”The young man could not stop laughing coldly.

“If it was so easy for you to escape, why would I expend so much effort to lure you here?”

Qin Yu swept his gaze towards the barrier surrounding the mansion and thought to himself that things were not looking good.

He did not know what kind of formation this barrier was, but it was indestructible and no one could escape it.

“You really taught me a lesson.”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at the young man.

The young man said with a faint smile, “You’re welcome. This is what I should do.”

Having said that, he no longer paid attention to Qin Yu. Instead, he turned around and looked at the man who was wearing armor and sitting on a strange beast.

“Protector Ren, I helped the Heavenly Cloud sect capture him. Please remember this for me.”The young man cupped his hands and said.

The man who was called protector Ren said coldly, “Don’t worry. The Heavenly Cloud sect will never owe anyone a favor.”

“Thank you, Protector Ren. I’ll take my leave first.”The young man cupped his hands and turned to leave.

Protector Ren stood in the air and said coldly, “Do you want to go back with us, or do you want me to kill you on the spot?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said with a cold smile, “Cut the crap. Let’s see what the real deal is.”

Protector Ren didn’t say any nonsense. He waved his hand and the people behind him immediately surrounded Qin Yu.

In the next second, a silver spear appeared in Protector Ren’s hand.

The silver spear flickered with a cold radiance, and a cold killing intent assaulted his face.

“Buzz!”

Protector Ren did not waste his breath. He thrust the silver spear in his hand at Qin Yu.

All kinds of precious splendor interweaved on the silver spear, and a boiling flame was approaching Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did not know Protector Ren’s ability, so he naturally did not dare to be negligent. He immediately leaped into the air and hurriedly dodged.

However, this guardian was very powerful, and his speed was even faster.

The silver spear in his hand stabbed faster and faster. In an instant, the sky was filled with spear shadows, and there was nowhere to hide.

The many disciples behind him also worked together to set up an array, trapping Qin Yu in an extremely narrow position.

Qin Yu, who had nowhere to hide, could only shout loudly and clench his fist to meet the Attack!

This was a fleshly fist that didn’t have any spirit energy. When it met Guardian Ren’s long spear, it couldn’t help but make people feel that it was shocking.

With a loud bang, guardian Ren’s wrist instantly felt a huge backlash.

The strength of this force far exceeded guardian Ren’s imagination!

His pupils constricted violently, and he frowned as he said, “Such a tough fleshly body is simply comparable to the prehistoric strange beasts in the Green Rock Forest.”

Qin Yu’s expression became even colder. In the battle just now, Qin Yu’s fist had also received a huge impact, but it was not affected much.

With his current body, it would be very difficult for guardian Ren’s silver spear to hurt him.

Guardian Ren did not say anything more. He held the spear with both hands, and specks of divine light quickly interweaved on the body of the spear.

This light was extremely dazzling, and the silver spear was filled with the momentum of sweeping through a thousand armies!

Qin Yu’s eyes were incomparably cold, and his divine power was boiling. After he shouted loudly, he actually took the initiative to attack! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Courting death.”Protector Ren snorted coldly, and the silver spear in his hand quickly swung out!

This silver spear had the power to split open the sky, sweeping everything in its path. Wherever it passed, space shattered!

But Qin Yu was completely unafraid. His blood essence boiled, and his hair danced wildly. His fists were brandished to the extreme.

“Boom!”

After a huge collision sound, guardian Ren was instantly repelled by the huge force!

Before he could react, a huge divine mountain suddenly condensed above his head!

This Divine Mountain was the venerable fifth mountain. With the increase in Qin Yu’s strength, the venerable fifth mountain became even more magnificent and majestic. Its strength was also incomparably tyrannical!

“Magic Weapon?”

Guardian Ren sneered, and the long spear in his hand immediately went up to meet it.

“Clang!”

A clear sound exploded at this moment! However, the power of the venerable fifth mountain was beyond imagination. His silver spear blocked it for less than a moment before it came crashing down.

A huge force rolled over, and guardian Ren and his butt sat up and quickly pressed down on the ground!

“Not good!”

Guardian Ren seemed to have sensed that something was wrong. He hurriedly activated his divine art and left.

The Strange Beast under his butt was not so lucky. Under this vast divine power, it roared continuously and its cries shook the sky.

No matter how much its blood boiled, it was unable to resist the crushing force of the venerable fifth mountain.

“Boom!”

The Venerable Fifth Mountain fell to the ground fiercely. The Strange Beast was instantly crushed into pieces and crushed into a pile of meat paste.

Qin Yu recalled the venerable fifth mountain.

The Venerable Fifth Mountain appeared in Qin Yu’s palm. It was shrouded in mist, like a divine mountain.

The venerable fifth mountain seemed to interact with Qin Yu’s divine power. As Qin Yu’s physical strength increased, the power of the venerable fifth mountain also increased several times.

Protector Ren looked coldly at the beast that was crushed into meat paste, and the killing intent on his body became even stronger.

“You have some ability, but no one can escape from the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”

Protector Ren roared, and the silver spear in his hand stabbed out once more!

This time, the silver spear was covered with talismans, and every captive was shining. An extremely terrifying power was emitted from the silver spear!

In the blink of an eye, the silver spear was already approaching Qin Yu’s glabella!

With such a fast speed, Qin Yu had no time to dodge.

He hurriedly dodged, but the tip of the spear still pierced half a centimeter into Qin Yu’s chest.

Traces of blood flowed down.

Meanwhile, Protector Ren, who was holding the silver spear, had a shocked expression on his face.

“Under such a secret technique, it actually only pierced half a centimeter,”protector Ren said with a frown.

He was just about to pull out the spear, but Qin Yu grabbed the silver spear in his hand.

Protector Ren’s expression changed slightly, and he subconsciously looked at Qin Yu.

“Your biggest mistake was being so close to me,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Protector Ren immediately felt that something was wrong. He wanted to shoot out, but it was already too late.

Qin Yu followed the silver spear and closed in. Then, he punched Protector Ren’s face.

With a clang, a huge sound of steel colliding exploded in the sky!

“I’m wearing a sacred armor. It’s impossible for you to hurt me!”Protector Ren said coldly.

However, what responded to him was only a pair of iron fists!

Bang

The second punch also landed on Protector Ren’s face. This punch instantly shattered protector Ren’s armor!

This so-called sacred armor was actually shattered by two punches!
