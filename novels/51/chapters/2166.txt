2167 Response from Various Parties

The discussion of this matter was endless. There were diverse opinions regarding Qin Yu’s fate and turning point.

Some sympathized and regretted his encounter. They felt that he was once heaven’s favorite, and it was a pity that he ended up this way.

And some people expressed disdain and ridicule toward him, thinking that what happened served him right. He coveted the Yan family’s saintess and finally suffered retribution.

The various aristocratic families soon heard the news but were not too surprised. Instead, they felt that it was only natural.

“Yan Tianshi let him go, but that doesn’t mean the other aristocratic families will let him go.”

“That’s right. Yan Tianshi is very cunning. Once Qin Yu leaves the protection of Thunder Courtyard, how can he survive? There was no need to even think about it. There must be someone waiting for him in the dark.”

“Unfortunately, the Traceless Immortal Scripture is probably going to vanish.”

…

In the Jiang family, after Holy Son Jiang heard this, he did not say anything for a long time. After a long time, he slowly said, “D*mn it, this little rascal. He’s not returned my Jiang family’s magical artifact yet…”

Despite what he said, his tone was filled with a hint of sorrow. It was as if he felt sorry to lose a heaven’s favorite.

When Saintess Gu heard about this, she was tremendously shocked too, but soon she regained her composure.

“It doesn’t mean that you can’t come out after entering the void,” Saintess Gu said in a low voice.

Yao Xi, beside her, laughed out loud and said, “You really think highly of him! Escape from the void? Even a True Saint can’t do it!”

Saintess Gu was silent. She looked at the sky and seemed a little melancholic.

Naturally, Yan Ruoxue suffered the most pain.

When Yan Ruoxue heard the news, she was stunned for half a second before she came to her senses.

“Impossible! It was absolutely impossible! How could something happen to Qin Yu? Quickly tell me this is fake!” Yan Ruoxue completely lost her composure. She no longer looked like a saintess. Instead, she looked like an ordinary girl on the verge of collapse.

She grabbed Uncle Yan’s arm frantically, her eyes full of hope.

Uncle Yan sighed and said, “I’m afraid this’s not fake. Qin Yu… He was very likely sent into the void.”

Yan Ruoxue’s face was pale. Qin Yu was her beloved, and now…

When Yan Ruoxue heard Uncle Yan’s words, she felt as if being struck by a heavy blow. Her hands began to tremble, and tears flowed uncontrollably.

“No, it’s impossible! How could Qin Yu…” Yan Ruoxue muttered in a hoarse and exhausted voice, and her voice was full of despair and pain.

She closed her eyes and tried to escape the cruelty of reality, but her thoughts were only filled with Qin Yu’s figure. She recalled the moment they met, the time they spent together, and the countless times they fought side by side.

Yan Ruoxue once thought their future was full of hope, but now everything vanished like bubbles.

Her heart felt like being cut by a blade, and the intense pain made her almost unable to breathe.

“Qin Yu, you promised me that you would always protect me. You would never let me be alone and never leave me…” Yan Ruoxue cried out hoarsely, her voice filled with endless sorrow and helplessness.

Her once radiant smile now faded away, replaced by eyes filled with endless tears. She felt she had been thrown into an abyss, unable to find any support or solace.

Yan Ruoxue fell to the ground weakly. Her body trembled violently as if she was about to collapse.

Uncle Yan’s heart ached as he watched from the side, but he did not know how to comfort her.

Nobody could walk out of the void. Qin Yu was no exception.

“Qin Yu will not die… He can always create miracles. I believe in him!” Yan Ruoxue suddenly raised her head. Her eyes were bloodshot as if she was on the verge of collapse.

The next moment, Yan Ruoxue’s body suddenly burst out with tremendously strong killing intent.

She looked at Uncle Yan coldly and said, “Who did this?”

Uncle Yan dared not hide it and quickly said, “They are the two elders of the Yao family.”

“Yao family…” Yan Ruoxue bit her red lips with her pearly white teeth. As she exerted too much strength, she even bit her lips.

She turned around and left. Uncle Yan hurriedly asked from behind, “Miss Yan, where are you going? You can’t be rash about this!”

However, Yan Ruoxue ignored him and left Mount Donghuang right away.

Uncle Yan had no choice but to follow.

Yan Ruoxue arrived at the main peak of the Yan family and headed straight for Yan Tianshi’s Cultivation Mountain. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The elderly men guarding the Cultivation Mountain hurriedly stopped Yan Ruoxue and bowed. “Saintess, Holy Lord does not allow anyone to disturb him when he is comprehending the dao. You should…”

“Get lost.” Yan Ruoxue’s bone-chilling voice rudely interrupted them.

The two elderly men opened their mouths, looking extremely troubled.

Uncle Yan shook his head and signaled for them to let her go.

“Let her in.”

At this moment, Yan Tianshi’s voice came from the mountain.

The two elderly men quickly made their way and stood respectfully by the side.

Yan Ruoxue quickly walked up the mountain and arrived in front of Yan Tianshi in a flash.

At this moment, Yan Tianshi was drinking tea. He picked up the teacup and said indifferently, “What’s the matter? Why are you so anxious?”

“I want to declare war on the Yao family!” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

Upon hearing this, Yan Tian spat out the water that had just entered his mouth.

He wiped his mouth and frowned. “Do you know what you are saying?”

“They harmed Qin Yu. I must kill them.” Yan Ruoxue gritted her teeth.

Of course, Yan Tianshi knew that Qin Yu had been sent into the void. However, he was displeased hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words.

“As the saintess of the Yan family, you will definitely take over my position in the future and lead the entire Yan family. As the Saint Lord, you shouldn’t be affected by your emotions,” Yan Tianshi said coldly.

Yan Ruoxue said somewhat miserably, “I’ve never been interested in the position of Holy Lord. With Qin Yu’s death, I definitely won’t go on alone. But before that, I must make the Yao family pay the price!”

Yan Tianshi’s frown deepened. He knew Yan Ruoxue’s temper, and she was not joking.

Thus, even as the Yan family’s Holy Lord, he appeared extremely cautious at this moment.

“Ruoxue, calm down. Once the Yan family and Yao family start a war, you should know what it means,” Yan Tianshi said in a deep voice.

Yan Ruoxue suddenly laughed. She turned to Yan Tianshi and bowed. “Holy Lord, I was too impulsive. I’m sorry.”

Yan Tianshi was stunned. It seemed he did not expect Yan Ruoxue to say such a thing.

“All this while…I’m very grateful to the Yan family for taking care of me, especially you. You treat me like your own daughter. I’ll always remember this kindness.” Yan Ruoxue bowed again.

After saying this, she bowed three times to Yan Tianshi before she turned to leave.

Yan Tianshi was dumbfounded. Ever since Yan Ruoxue came to the Yan family, she had never spoken like this.
