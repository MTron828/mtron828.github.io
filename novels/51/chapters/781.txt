Chapter 782: So That’s How It Is Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“I, Hou Xin, have never owed anyone a favor! Please wait a moment, I’ll give you the pill formula right now!” Hou Xin hurriedly stood up and said.

Qin Yu didn’t refuse. He sat at the side and waited quietly.

About three hours later, Hou Xin came over with the pill formula.

“This is my substitute. It’s called the detoxification pill. It can remove almost all poisons!” Hou Xin said with confidence.

“But I’m not sure if the poison in Old Master Xue’s body can be removed.”

Qin Yu took the pill formula, stood up and said, “Thank you very much.”

“By the way, with your strength, it’s very easy for you to get yourself killed. Why don’t you follow me to my place?” Qin Yu suggested.

Hou Xin shook his head and said, “No, I prefer to live alone. Thank you for your concern.”

Qin Yu didn’t insist.

He nodded and left.

Then, Qin Yu rushed to Wen Sheng’s residence.

However, when Qin Yu arrived at Wen Sheng’s residence, his expression couldn’t help but change!

He saw a corpse lying on the ground. His chest had been shattered, and it looked tragic!

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

“Could it be that he is Wen Sheng?!” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Before Qin Yu could think, a few people had already walked in from outside the door.

“How dare you! You actually dared to commit murder in the middle of the night!”

Qin Yu turned around and saw that Xue Yujie was leading two Martial Marquises and looking at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I didn’t kill him...”

“If you didn’t kill him, then why are you here?!” Xue Yujie shouted. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qin Yu felt that the situation was bad.

Oh no! Wen Sheng had been killed by someone before him!

Most importantly, he became the scapegoat!

“You actually killed Wen Sheng. How vicious!” Xue Yujie said coldly.

Qin Yu said with a cold look, “I’ll say it again. I didn’t kill him!”

“Cut the crap. Take him down!” Xue Yujie shouted.

After that, the two Martial Marquises strode toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression was cold, and the internal qi on his body was rising rapidly.

“What’s going on?”

At this moment, Xue Yuzhi walked in.

Xue Yujie glanced at her and said, “This person killed Wen Sheng. He probably failed to get the prescription, so he killed him to silence him.”

“Qin Yu?” Xue Yuzhi immediately frowned.

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Auntie Xue, I didn’t kill him.”

“You still dare to be stubborn? If you didn’t kill him, why are you here?” Xue Yujie said angrily.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to explain, but Xue Yuzhi shook her head and said, “Qin Yu was introduced by my friend. He wouldn’t lie.”

“Wouldn’t lie? Yuzhi, don’t be deceived,” Xue Yujie said coldly.

Xue Yuzhi said in a low voice, “Brother, Wen Sheng is already dead. If you capture Qin Yu again, who will save our father?”

Xue Yujie frowned slightly, as if he thought what Xue Yuzhi said made sense.

“Qin Yu, hurry up and declare your position!” Xue Yuzhi urged hurriedly.

Qin Yu looked at Xue Yujie and said in a deep voice, “Mr. Xue, I will definitely be able to refine the pill and cure Old Master Xue.”

“Also, I didn’t kill the person.”

Xue Yujie didn’t care about Wen Sheng’s life or death at all. As long as someone could refine the pill, he didn’t care at all if one or two people died.

“Okay, I will believe you for the time being,” Xue Yujie said coldly.

“But I’m warning you, if I don’t see the pill three days later, I won’t let you go!”

After saying this, Xue Yujie turned around and left.

After he left, Xue Yuzhi hurriedly asked, “Qin Yu, what exactly happened?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I wanted to discuss the pill formula of the concentric pill with him, but when I came, he was already dead.”

Xue Yuzhi asked in a deep voice, “Why did you come in the middle of the night?”

Qin Yu didn’t panic. He explained, “I went to find Hou Xin first and discussed it with him in the middle of the night, so I came late.”

Xue Yuzhi didn’t ask any more questions.

She nodded and said, “As long as you can refine the concentric pill, it doesn’t matter.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Auntie Xue, I understand.”

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“Auntie Xue, do you know the Purple Flame Sect?” Qin Yu asked.

“Purple Flame Sect?” Xue Yuzhi frowned slightly.

“Why did you inquire about the Purple Flame Sect?”

Qin Yu said casually, “It’s nothing. I just heard someone mention it before, so I just asked casually.”

Xue Yuzhi said in a deep voice, “The Purple Flame Sect is a local force. It’s very powerful. It has more than twenty Martial Marquises, and there is no lack of peak Martial Marquises among them.”

“With such strength, even the Xue family is unwilling to offend them.”

Upon hearing these words, Qin Yu immediately felt that the situation was bad.

It wasn’t that he was afraid of the Purple Flame Sect. It was mainly because he was afraid that after he left, the Purple Flame Sect would blame this on the Xue family.

“If I can obtain the power of a Martial Saint, I might as well make a trip to the Purple Flame Sect.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was also a good opportunity to test out the power of a martial saint.

After bidding farewell to Xue Yuzhi, Qin Yu walked around the room again. He only returned to his residence in the middle of the night.

After he returned, Qin Yu took out the two Golden Cores.

The Golden Cores were emitting a dim light in the darkness.

Waves of dense spiritual energy spread out.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “This Golden Core is really a good thing. It would be great if I could get a few more.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu suddenly had an idea.

He thought for a while and finally sneered. “It’s decided!”

Then, Qin Yu took out the pill formula given by Hou Xin and carefully studied it.

The herbs recorded in this pill formula were all quite common, and the refining method wasn’t too difficult.

“Can this thing really dispel poison?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He pondered for a moment before putting the pill formula aside.

Following that, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and searched through his inherited memories for the pill formula for the dispel poison pill.

“There really is one!”

Very quickly, Qin Yu found the pill formula of the dispel poison pill in his inherited memories.

“Huh?”

A few minutes later, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The pill formula in his inherited memories seemed to be different from the pill formula that Hou Xin had given him.

The general medicinal herbs were basically the same, but there were a few herbs that were completely different.

Not only were the medicinal herbs different, but their effects were completely opposite.

Qin Yu stared at the pill formula in his hand and immediately frowned.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu’s brows relaxed.

He sneered. “So that’s how it is. I understand now...”
