Chapter 2808: The Nineteenth Prison’s Divinity

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

For the next few days, Qin Yu sealed himself in the small room.

The heavy pressure of the Investiture of Gods almost made him breathless.

In contrast, other aspects did not make him so afraid.

“In other words, the Investiture of Gods is a powerful space. No matter what kind of soul enters it, it will become extremely talented.”

When the few of them heard Qin Yu’s words, they were all somewhat in disbelief.

“Yes, including the power of my Dao of Dreams. This power was comprehended by accident.”

“After obtaining the Nineteenth Prison, the ultimate location of the Dao of Dreams, only then the power could slowly enter. However, not long after entering the Nineteenth Prison, my Night Qi had a breakthrough. It seemed that I was not far from entering the Nineteenth Prison and no longer needed to stay in the tunnel.”

Although 90% of Qin Yu’s divine sense was still in the Investiture of Gods, these memories were still shared.

However, some ot the specific details were very blurry because ot the incompleteness of the divine soul. “Then boss, have you become stronger or weaker?” Fatty Situ still didn’t understand.

Qin Yu shook his head and said with a bitter smile.

“The current situation is better than The Walking Dead from before. There’s no doubt about it. At least my consciousness can come out of the Investiture of Gods, but my incomplete consciousness can’t exert its greatest power.” Qin Yu extended his palm.

His terrifying power of consciousness immediately poured out. The violent and complicated divine soul constructed countless opposite dreams.

The power of divine sense rushed towards the three of them like a hurricane, causing their faces to turn deathly pale.

If Qin Yu had not closed his fist in time, he would probably have been able to kill them with this soul power alone.

“F*ck! Boss, I’m afraid that even Holy Consciousness is no match for your soul power. Even the few Holy Lords you fought before didn’t seem to have such an oppressive soul power.”

Fatty Situ felt his hair stand on end.

This feeling was too strange. He had never encountered such a terrifying divine sense.

These divine senses were filled with countless people’s thoughts of reincarnation.

Every trace of power reflected a person’s true life.

This was not an illusion, but a real life.

What kind of powerful divine sense could do this? When one’s ups and downs and the fluctuation of emotions of the entire life exploded, one would realize how small one was.

Among the three, especially the holy daughter, her divine sense had already broken through to Dao Consciousness. Her divine soul had even reached the level of Holy Consciousness. However, she still couldn’t last a round. One could imagine how terrifying Qin Yu’s divine sense was at this moment.

It seemed that when his consciousness was stuck in the Investiture of Gods, he had been constantly entering the dreams.

That was why his current divine sense was so powerful. According to Fatty Situ’s analysis, his power of divine sense had probably reached the level of Holy Consciousness. He could even fight against a Holy Lord.

Moreover, that kind of unconscious state was the best time to enter the dream.

As long as there was a trace of self-consciousness, it was likely that one would fall into a desperate situation in this reincarnation.

This included the time when Qin Yu was searching for the starlight in the Suppression Ring.

He only dared to choose those dim stars. It was still difficult for him even for an ordinary person with a hundred years’ lifespan.

That was a hundred years that passed by second by second. It was not the carefree flow one would experience when cultivating in seclusion. That was why the soul power could grow so exaggeratedly.

What was this?

Qin Yu was checking his sea of consciousness when he discovered a diamond-shaped object that was as dark as the starry sky.

This object did not seem to have a physical body. When Qin Yu scanned it with his divine sense, he discovered that a huge divine sense memory was sealed on it.

Qin Yu’s hair stood on end. These memories should be the number of dreams that this entity had entered after he became a god.

This was f*cking…

Qin Yu did not need to think to know that this body had definitely split his soul and entered the dreams.

Moreover, these memories seemed to have mixed in when he released the power of divine sense. It had caused great damage to Fatty Situ and the others.

What was this thing?

Qin Yu stared at the rhombus-shaped object. There seemed to be only a faint shadow.

If one didn’t check carefully, one might even miss it.

“This is the Nineteenth Prison’s divinity. I didn’t expect you to be able to cultivate it. Kid, didn’t you notice that it’s very similar to the image on your Soul Suppression Ring?”

As if sensing Qin Yu’s question, a familiar and annoying voice suddenly sounded. It was Sir Dagger.

“Divinity! Can I defeat the existence in the Investiture of Gods?” Qin Yu’s expression froze. This name sounded awesome.

“Hahaha! Kid, do you know who the only person who escaped from the Investiture of Gods is?”

Sir Dagger laughed.

Qin Yu shook his head honestly. He urgently needed information about this thing right now, so he could only let Sir Dagger show off.

“It is the product of the fusion of the top 100 people after they became gods since the Primordial Chaos era. Moreover, there seems to be a main consciousness mixed in it. A new monster is formed with that main consciousness.”

Qin Yu nodded. He had heard Smoker Xie’s story, so it was not difficult for him to accept it. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Investiture of Gods’ space was a super-intelligent brain.

Anyone who entered it could use its ability.

The person who had originally refined this brain had the key to use it.

However, more and more powerful beings ascended to godhood. After borrowing their power, it easily swindled the key from the little boy and became the new holder of the Investiture of Gods.

“That consciousness is the ultimate energy of the Investiture of Gods. It is also the energy bestowed by the Investiture of Gods. After the person who escaped killed the creator, it became the new owner, or more appropriately, a monster. Even in the previous few battles, the Immortal Emperors did not dare to provoke it. Do you want to escape from its hands? Tsk, tsk, tsk!” Sir Dagger’s mocking voice rang out.

“You have to save me. If I die, you won’t have any energy to eat.”

Qin Yu’s scalp went numb when he heard that. If that was the case, what else could he do?

“That’s not a problem. It’ll be difficult for your divine soul to die after you become a god. Moreover, the energy obtained through the unconscious state of your body in the space is even greater. This is the first time in so many years I don’t have to starve. I’ll go to sleep first. You can study it slowly.”

Sir Dagger yawned.

“Oh, there’s something I have to remind you of! There can only be one divinity of the Nineteenth Prison, which means that you have to cultivate this thing..”
