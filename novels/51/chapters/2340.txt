2341 Execution

“Poor Moon Listening Pavilion! When the Holy Region’s aristocratic families arrived, they would definitely target a few people. The Moon Listening Pavilion has been operating in Solitary Cloud City for many years, with influence spread far and wide. Its accumulated wealth must be immense. Isn’t it just the perfect target for them?”

Qin Yu nodded. Previously, he was extorted by the lady boss, Ji Yue, when he asked for some information.

After operating for many years, the Ji family’s financial power could be comparable to that of an entire nation.

“The Moon Listening Pavilion should have accumulated an extensive network of contacts. Aren’t these people helping?”

Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled. With the extensive network of contacts the Moon Listening Pavilion had built over so many years, it should more or less make the Holy Region wary.

“Indeed, that’s true. Pavilion Master Ji Yue has wanted to compromise and hand over half of the assets for peace.

“However, the higher-ups of the Holy Region have gone too far. They’ve demanded the Ji family hand over the entire inventory of the Ji family. They’ve also refined the memories of those around Ji Yue to obtain an approximate value of the Ji family’s storage. Now, there’s no way to hide. Moreover, some of them are Ji Yue’s close relatives. The situation has become irreconcilable between the two parties.”

“These beasts are truly despicable scum.” Qin Yu clenched his teeth upon hearing this. They were even more sinister than the evilest of villains!

Seeing Qin Yu cursing, the cultivator was relieved.

“Subsequently, the Ji family’s forces also began to take action. There were more than 60 True Siant cultivators, and ten were above the eighth grade. They wanted to use this to put pressure on the Holy Region.”

That person let out a sigh with a terrified expression on his face.

“I heard that an heir of the Holy Region suddenly made a move and killed all the ten True Saint cultivators above the eighth grade. The rest were directly refined into puppets and placed on the city wall to warn the aristocratic families and sects. These people were insignificant to the cultivators of the Holy Region. They were not worth mentioning at all.”

“Where is Ji Yue now?”

“You will see her in a while. All nine families related to the Ji family have been captured and accused of the crime of communicating with alien races, facing the heavenly punishment. Everyone in purgatory will come and watch.”

That person gritted his teeth as he spoke, extremely dissatisfied with the Holy Region’s actions. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In the name of righteousness, they were actually doing the things of bandits or even more shameless than bandits.

“What a good example to warn others!” Killing intent flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

“There’s no way out. They’re similarly ninth-grade True Saints, but their strength can directly crush those in purgatory who don’t have the strength to resist, even if they want to.”

The man sighed and left in a hurry without saying anything further.

“This is the gap between the Holy Region and this galaxy. Other than some geniuses, there is a huge gap between the rest of the people and the cultivators of the Holy Region. You must plan well if you want to save people.”

Elder Guai reminded in the Sumeru ring.

At this moment, a bell rang from the central square. It seemed that the execution had begun.

Some people were here to watch the show, some were gloating, and some were indignant. The entire square was in a mess.

In the center, more than 200 members of the Ji family knelt in a row. Among them were children a few years old and even infants a few months old.

“Ji Yue, you colluded with the alien races to harm the human race. You now still have a chance to atone for your sins. Immediately reveal the coordinates of all the hidden treasures of your family, and you may spare your life. Otherwise, everyone in your Ji family will be nailed on the pillar of shame of the human race ”

Qin Yu recognized this person who spoke. He was an elder of the Ni family he met before.

“Phooey! You bunch of beasts, go find it yourself if you have the ability.”

Ji Yue sneered and said. Her face was almost bloodless. She had suffered tremendously cruel torture during this period.

Moreover, she understood that these people wanted to use the Ji family as an example to warn the other forces in purgatory.

Whether or not she handed over the Ji family’s resources, she could not escape death.

“Stop! I heard that Pavilion Master Ji Yue is willing to hand over half of the resources. Why must you force her to death? Are you Holy Region aristocratic families here to plunder, or are you here to lead your armies against the alien races?”

Qin Yu suddenly said.

“Little b*stard, do you have a say here? I suspect you’re a criminal colluding with alien races as well.”

The elder pressed his hand down, and Qin Yu only felt a dense spiritual energy coming from the space. That spiritual energy suddenly grabbed his shoulder.

“Kneel and speak.”

The massive force of the palm suddenly rose, wanting to press Qin Yu to the ground.

A light screen stretched out from Qin Yu’s divine sense, blocking this force.

“Hmm, there’s something. He seems to have hidden his strength.”

The Ni family’s elder revealed an interested expression and increased his strength.

However, it did not impact the light screen formed by Qin Yu’s power of divine sense. The elder’s forehead was covered in sweat. Even though he had activated his spiritual energy to the utmost, he still could not do anything to the person before him.

“Hmph! Ignorant kid!”

Another two people suddenly stood out. Qin Yu’s eyes widened. Weren’t these two the elders of the Ni family who stopped him and Yan Ruoxue when they were about to leave?

They were Ni Dian and Ni Cha.

His eyes suddenly turned red. These two old farts had caused Ruoxue to suffer so much pain.

He slapped his palm lightly in the air, and a thunderous sound rang out.

That was the sound of a palm slapping the air. In an instant, Qin Yu’s body shook violently, and blood seeped out of his body.

Although his Spiritualization Technique could block Ni Dian’s spiritual energy attack, the vibration power almost shattered his body.

The mask on his face was also shattered, revealing his original appearance.

“Qin Yu!”

Si Dian was stunned for a moment but immediately sneered.

“I heard you had many fortuitous encounters in purgatory, but it’s nothing much seeing you today. Suppress him!”

The massive spiritual energy pressure directly broke Qin Yu’s leg bone. Qin Yu gritted his teeth and stood up shakily.

“Are you courting death!”

Seeing that Qin Yu was injured, Jue Wu directly slapped her palm toward the elderly man.

Si Dian also blocked Jue Wu’s attack with his palm but was forced back a few steps by Jue Wu’s strength.

“Alright, you still have some strength, but none can leave today.”

Si Dian clapped his hands, and a mirror suddenly appeared in the sky.

“Mystic Moon Mirror.”

In the void, a beam of moonlight shone on the mirror. The other side of the Mystic Moon Mirror reflected the moonlight and enveloped Jue Wu.

In an instant, the light beam became a cage that trapped Jue Wu inside.

Jue Wu was furious. She kicked the light beam fiercely, and the Mystic Moon Mirror in the air actually trembled.

“What a terrifying power! However, this Mystic Moon Mirror is the Ni family’s tribulation magical artifact. With the activation of the Ni family’s immortal scripture, even if you’re a Peak of True Saint, you’ll have to stay inside obediently.”
