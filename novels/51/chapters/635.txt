Chapter 636: Wreaking Havoc in the Venue! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Sword Energy erupted from the mark, and in an instant, the entire venue was almost split into two!

Qin Yu panted and looked coldly in the direction of the three people.

At this moment, something that shocked Qin Yu happened!

Yan Guiyi actually ran away!

The two black-gold robbed men were already lying on the ground and on the brink of death, yet Yan Guiyi had disappeared without a trace!

“He actually ran away?” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold, and then he couldn’t help but laugh mockingly.

“The people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association all like to leave their companions behind and run away by themselves.”

Qin Yu walked straight to the front of the two men.

They opened their mouths, as if they wanted to beg for mercy, but Qin Yu didn’t give them a chance at all. He directly cut the two men into two halves with his sword.

Qin Yu knew very well that this was definitely not a place to stay for long.

Yan Guiyi had escaped. He would definitely go and get help.

Therefore, Qin Yu looked at the host, who was almost peeing in fear, and said coldly, “Where’s the auction items?”

The host pointed to the back with a trembling voice and said, “It’s... It’s in the back. Don’t kill me...”

“Take me there,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The host had long been scared out of his wits. How could he dare to say anything more? He hurriedly brought Qin Yu to the back.

At the place hiding the auction items, Qin Yu violently broke the lock on the door.

“It’s all here...” the host said with a trembling voice.

Qin Yu glanced at it and soon found a long sword.

This sword looked ordinary. It couldn’t even be compared to the bronze sword in his hand.

However, Qin Yu didn’t have time to think about it. He immediately took all the items in the auction.

At this moment, Yan Guiyi was holding a cell phone and notifying the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“President, the black-robed man robbed our auction!” Yan Guiyi said through gritted teeth.

On the other end, Qu Xie immediately slapped the table and stood up while shouting angrily, “What did you say?!”

Yan Guiyi wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said, “Send people to the venue immediately. We can’t let him escape!”

Qu Xie was furious. He said coldly, “Stall for time! We can’t let him escape!”

After saying that, Qu Xie hung up the phone.

However, Yan Guiyi was worried. He knew that he was no match for the black-robed man.

However, he was the one in charge of this auction. Now that such a thing had happened, the higher-ups definitely wouldn’t let him off.

If he escaped now, it would be an even greater crime.

After thinking about it, Yan Guiyi gritted his teeth and turned around to walk toward the venue.

Inside the venue, Qin Yu put all the auction items in his bag and was ready to leave.

He strode towards the door in the black robe.

After walking out of the venue, Qin Yu quickly discovered Yan Guiyi, who was hiding in the dark.

His eyes looked toward the place where Yan Guiyi was hiding, and a murderous aura burst out.

Sensing the murderous aura from Qin Yu, Yan Guiyi’s body immediately tensed up.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and turned to leave.

At the moment, Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to kill Yan Guiyi quickly, and reinforcements from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would probably arrive soon.

Therefore, Qin Yu finally gave up the idea of killing Yan Guiyi and turned around to leave.

Seeing this, Yan Guiyi also heaved a sigh of relief.

He hurriedly returned to the venue and quietly waited for Qu Xie’s arrival.

Ten minutes later, a number of cars stopped at the entrance.

As soon as the cars stopped, Qu Xie hurried into the venue.

There were at least eight black-gold robbed men beside him! Each of them was stronger than Yan Guiyi!

After entering the venue, Qu Xie saw corpses everywhere!

Not only were the martial artists injured, but ordinary people were also affected!

Seeing this scene, Qu Xie flew into a rage with anger rising from his heart!

“Black-robed man... This black-robed man went too far!” Qu Xie raised his head to roar!

This auction was a public social event for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Now that the black-robed man had caused such a ruckus, it was simply a slap to the face of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! He would even be punished by the higher-ups!

“Yan Guiyi! Where is he?!” Qu Xie shouted furiously.

Yan Guiyi gritted his teeth and said, “I’m not his match. I let him escape...” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qu Xie grabbed Yan Guiyi’s collar and said angrily, “Didn’t I tell you to keep an eye on him?!”

Yan Guiyi frowned and said, “I tried to stop him, but... but I was no match for him. Two of our companions died under his sword...”

“You didn’t stop him at all, did you? I clearly saw you leave your companions behind and run away.” At this time, the Pavilion Master in the hall added fuel to the flames.

PYan Guiyi’s expression immediately changed!

“Don’t talk nonsense!” Yan Guiyi said angrily.

“The Pavilion Master is right. We saw it too.” Someone next to her snorted.

“That black-robed man killed two of your companions, but you ran out of the venue and put our lives at risk. Is this how the Jingdu Martial Arts Association does things?” An injured ordinary wealthy man snorted.

For a moment, everyone pointed their fingers at Yan Guiyi.

Qu Xie’s expression was even uglier!

He took a deep breath and explained patiently, “Everyone, this was just an accident. I will definitely give everyone an explanation.”

“Humph, President Qu, I hope you will keep your word.”

President Qu bowed slightly and said, “Everyone, go to the hospital first.”

After sending everyone away, Qu Xie’s expression finally darkened.

“Yan Guiyi, you coward!” Qu Xie said coldly.

Yan Guiyi’s expression turned cold, then he gritted his teeth and said, “Who isn’t afraid of death? I’ve already lost an arm for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but the Jingdu Martial Arts Association didn’t seem to give me any reward!”

Qu Xie’s expression?turned cold, then he frowned and said, “Yan Guiyi, are you crazy?”

Yan Guiyi snorted and said, “Qu Xie, am I not telling the truth?”

“How many people in the prison were captured by me all these years? What benefits did I get?”

“I’ve applied for the bloodline power many times this time, but all of you rejected it. Now, you want me to die for you guys?”

Qu Xie opened his mouth, but he was speechless.

Although he was the president, the real power was not in his hands, but in the hands of the higher-ups.

This was why Yan Guiyi dared to blame Qu Xie.

“Let’s deal with the accident first and think about how to explain it to the others,” someone said.

Qu Xie took a deep breath and said coldly, “We must catch this black-robed man no matter what! No matter what the price!”

...

At this moment, Qin Yu had already fled back to his house.

As soon as he entered the house, Qin Yu saw that the mustached man was sitting several meters away from the coffin. He stared at the coffin without blinking, as if he was afraid that the coffin would make any strange movements.

“I’ve brought the things back for you. It’s time for you to tell me how to activate the two male corpses,” said Qin Yu.
