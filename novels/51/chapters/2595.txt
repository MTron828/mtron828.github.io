Chapter 2596: Sabersman

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

However, his hands were trembling uncontrollably after fighting so many giant monsters. The last slash was a sign of exhaustion, or else the giant demon would not have retaliated.

Another two giant monsters surged toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu almost could not breathe.

He was sprinting full speed in the battle with a few ogres. His body did not slow down at all. At this moment, he was facing these two giant monsters.

He could not even control his head to release the energy of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

“Whoosh!”

A flash of blade passed, slashing across the kneecaps of two ogres.

This slash directly cut a deep wound in their kneecaps.

As the two enraged ogres were about to pounce on that person, their kneecaps suddenly snapped, leaving only their ferocious heads to emit angry roars.

“Thank you, Brother. Are you an outsider too?”

There was another person beside Qin Yu. He held an extremely extraordinary saber in his hand. Compared to Qin Yu’s sorry state, he was much calmer.

“Ju Wuwei, please take over from me if I’m tired.”

He nodded slightly and cut off another giant demon’s kneecap with his saber.

“What a terrifying sabersman! Almost every slash landed on the ogre’s kneecap, and he didn’t completely cut it off. The moment the ogre exerted force, the kneecap would break, and the threat of the ogre who lost its legs would reduce significantly.”

Although his arms were trembling, his breathing was still very stable.

Qin Yu nodded without hesitation. It was certainly best to have another teammate now. Moreover, he had taken the initiative to save his life first.

“Boom!”

The city wall suddenly shook.

After nearly twenty ogres entered the city wall, another ten ogres pounced on them.

The west gate’s city wall fell into a purgatory.

Countless soldiers rushed forward and fought the ogres.

These ten ogres were not something that ordinary soldiers could withstand. Even if they went all out, they would still be smashed into meat patties.

The necromancer sitting on the giant carriage suddenly raised the scenter in

his hand.

He raised his pale arm, and a ball of burning energy slowly gathered at his fingertips. The evil shadow and the flames intertwined, forming a scorching fireball. The fireball emitted a flickering red light, and the surrounding air seemed to be distorted by its heat.

As the necromancer’s arm fell, the fireball released scorching flames and distorted energy. It roared as it smashed down on the city wall. The fireball roared and burned the air into distorted ripples.

The commando team behind him moved in unison to meet the terrifying fireball.

“Technique!”

Qin Yu was scared out of his wits. It must have been that necromancer that was making a move again.

This was the first time he had seen technique since he came to this Saint Kingdom.

This also made him understand that his previous guess was correct. It was not that there were no techniques in this Saint Kingdom, but he had not reached the level of observing the way.

With his current strength, he might be slightly better than some low-level natives.

Moreover, the power of this flame was not something that the mortal realm could compare to.

A technique activated by Saint power seemed to be able to destroy the world.

Flames burned in the sky and kept falling on the city walls.

More and more soldiers fell, and their bodies burned into charcoal. This technique burned about 50 commando soldiers to ashes.

“Boom!”

At this moment, an ogre had rushed toward Ju Wuwei.

A club smashed down fiercely toward him, and a terrifying gust of wind almost blew Qin Yu away.

“Roar! ”

Ju Wuwei had nowhere to dodge and fiercely met it with his saber.

“No, the difference in strength is too great! We can’t win!”

Qin Yu held his head and focused his gaze on the lower right side of the ogre.

Although he wanted to aim the pupil’s gaze at his kneecap, he was temporarily unable to control this massive power. Therefore, he could only concentrate his strength on a relatively larger area.

“Boom!”

The area where the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze focused on suddenly emitted a muffled sound.

One of the ogre’s legs was hit by that massive force.

Its leg broke off at a strange angle, and the iron rod brushed past Ju Wuwei’s body and smashed down.

“Thanks.”

Ju Wuwei’s face was somewhat pale. Almost at the same time, he used all his strength to strike again and cut off the other kneecap of the ogre. However, he was also hit by the ogre’s staff and sent flying dozens of meters away.

On that side, there were also three or four ogres. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When they saw the figure smashing at them, they roared and attacked Ju Wuwei.

Soon Ju Wuwei fell into a desperate situation.

Although the ogre’s strike just now was not as terrifying as a full-power critical hit, it was far more powerful than an ordinary ogre.

Ju Wuwei was swept by that power. Even if he could gather some Saint power, he should not be able to recover to his full strength.

wnat was even more despairing was tnat tne Intense battle over tnere nad attracted the three ogres to join in.

In the blink of an eye, he was completely surrounded.

Even though he tried his best to block the attacks of these giant monsters with his saber, many injuries appeared on his body in a short time.

There were also a few outsiders who were not wearing battle armor. They all looked on indifferently and did not care at all.

“Boom!”

Ju Wuwei’s body was hit again, and he crashed into a watchtower.

Blood flowed down his face, but he did not show any emotion as he looked at the five ogres charging at him.

When the ogres arrived before him, his right arm became thicker. He waved his blade, and a powerful aura instantly erupted.

A blade light flashed!

The five ogres were split into halves at the point where their necks met their bodies.

Tiger Wings, sweeping through a thousand troops!

There was still reserve strength. What a terrifying sabersman! Moreover, under the gaze of Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he clearly saw that Ju Wuwei’s blade did not touch these ogres.

Saber qi!

The sabersman before him had already comprehended the essence of the saber technique in this Saint Kingdom. He should be a top-notch sabersman in the mortal realm. Otherwise, he would not be able to unleash such a terrifying saber strike in a short time.

Within this short time, Qin Yu killed another two ogres.

His body was at its limit, but there were still two ogres on the battlefield.

Ju Wuwei’s attack seemed to have attracted its attention. At this moment, it ran wildly toward Ju Wuwei.

The iron rod in its hand rubbed against the ground, sparkling. Ju Wuwei struggled to stand up.

He pointed his saber at the ogre without the slightest fear.

However, his arm kept trembling. Qin Yu understood that he could not take this attack no matter what..
