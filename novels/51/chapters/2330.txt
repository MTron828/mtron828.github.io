2331 The Wrath of the Sacred Beast

The Heavenly Fire!

Such a scorching temperature could even melt one’s soul.

Qin Yu’s skin instantly turned into charcoal. He stretched out Suo Lin to block in front of him.

The fire unicorn’s inner core had absorbed massive fire elemental energy.

Otherwise, Qin Yu would probably have been burned and not even his soul was left.

The fire element was not emitted outside the barrier.

But the distortion of space caused by the extreme heat was clear.

The Suo Lin in Qin Yu’s hand began to tremble wildly. In an instant, the energy of Suo Lin’s boxing glove was almost saturated.

Then, the nine flaming dragons spiraled out with soul-hunting sounds.

The surging fire elements in the air wildly surged into the nine fire dragons.

In just a breath’s time, the fire dragons’ bodies had almost doubled in size!

To the fire unicorn’s inner core, these fire elements were supplements.

“Boom!”

The nine fire dragons landed on the Vermilion Bird’s body.

Suddenly, the nine fire dragons let out a wail as if they were injured.

The nine fire dragons entered the Vermilion Bird’s body directly without a trace of life.

The Vermilion Bird had actually absorbed all of Suo Lin’s full-powered attack!

A weird smile appeared on the mysterious demon’s face, and he grabbed a demon grass tip and put it into his mouth to chew, his expression resembling someone watching a show.

This kid was a little stupid. He actually used a fire technique to attack the Vermilion Bird.

The Vermilion Bird looked at Qin Yu as countless divine inscriptions appeared on her face again.

Before the launch of the attack, Qin Yu’s skin was scalded by the high temperature, forming countless blood blisters.

Qin Yu’s body moved. Instead of retreating, he advanced.

He did not have high hopes for the first attack, so he was ready for the second attack. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In his sea of consciousness, the divine sense spirit bead emitted a bright light, responding to the power of the Path of Heaven.

The technique on his hand swiftly changed.

In the void, a divine sense that carried the heavenly might suddenly attracted a massive star.

A massive power of the stars struck Qin Yu’s body like a bolt of lightning. In an instant, Qin Yu felt his body about to split apart.

The Star Seal!

He forcefully suppressed the power of the star in his hands from exploding. He wanted to concentrate all his power on one point.

Qin Yu’s hands trembled and sealed the massive star power on her fists.

The Bead of Chaos in his body also released, surging to his arm and controlling his arms.

It was the first time he used both the divine sense spirit bead and the Bead of Chaos simultaneously. The Vermilion Bird’s pressure made him not hold back at all, and he attacked with all his might.

The fist was filled with shocking power as it slammed into the Vermillion Bird’s massive chest.

“Bang!”

The radiant star power burst forth from the tip of Qin Yu’s fist, and Qin Yu’s entire arm instantly lit up.

The Vermilion Bird suddenly opened her eyes, and her pupils emitted a flickering flame.

Her chest suddenly turned into a burning sea of fire, and Qin Yu’s arm disappeared in it.

The light of the star power gradually returned to silence in the endless sea of fire.

His entire arm had fused into the Vermillion Bird’s body. He retreated with one hand, and the flames continued spreading along the cut in his arm.

Qin Yu shouted and cut off his right shoulder with his left hand.

Otherwise, the flames would burn his entire body into ashes along his bones.

Qin Yu’s face was deathly pale. It was his most powerful technique, but it actually did not cause any harm to the Vermilion Bird.

Was the gap so huge?

The power of his attack just now had already surpassed the Peak of True Saint, but it still could not impact the Vermilion Bird.

He was very strong, but still not enough…

The mysterious person of the demon race shook his head.

In the distance, the patriarchs of the nine great aristocratic families were also staring at the barrier.

Although they could not see through the barrier to see the battle inside, they could feel the internal qi inside and roughly judge the battle scenes.

“To unleash such an attack with the strength of fourth-grade True Saint, he’s indeed a top-notch genius. There aren’t many people in the Holy Region who can do this.”

“Sigh, it’s a pity he’s facing a naturally born sacred beast, Vermillion Bird, and we can’t save him. Otherwise, those few people would probably attack as well, and the situation at that time would be unpredictable.”

“As long as there are enough resources, geniuses are everywhere. Those who overestimate themselves will only waste precious resources. They know that they will die, but they still go ahead. What else is this if not a fool?”

…

But inside the barrier, Qin Yu did not have the chance to catch his breath at all.

His vision blurred, and the Vermilion Bird’s long dress fluttered like a butterfly. Qin Yu did not have time to react.

Before Qin Yu could react in time, the blood-red dress had already wrapped him up like a dumpling, and then an extreme sea of fire suddenly erupted.

Even within this barrier, a red light was still shooting into the clouds.

The Sumeru qi. The spatial segregation.

At the moment of life and death, Qin Yu cut open a space and rushed out in a flash.

His body was covered in blood, and nearly half of his skin was melted by the high temperature.

Even more than half of the skin on his face was mangled, making him look incomparably miserable.

Previously, when he met Master Hei Yu, Hei Yu had told him before.

The spatial qi in the Sumeru ring was sharper than any other divine weapon.

If used properly, the Sumeru ring was not just a space but also a very powerful treasure.

The Vermilion Bird seemed annoyed that Qin Yu had escaped two consecutive attacks.

She soared into the sky, and the red divine inscription rose again.

This time, even the blood-red clothes on her body emitted a red light.

She was like the sun, and the gravel on the ground melted into glass.

The entire barrier was melted by this terrifying high temperature, and even the air could not avoid it.

Qin Yu looked solemn. At this moment, his chaotic qi was almost exhausted.

He had no way of receiving such a large-scale attack.

Flames Burning the Source!

A massive flame exploded once again, but this time, its power was several times more terrifying than before.

Even though it was a boxing glove made from the fire unicorn’s inner core, Qin Yu could sense its fear.

Even fire unicorns had to retreat when facing a true King of Fire.

A terrifying flame once again ignited out of thin air. These fire elements seemed to have entered the void at the same time and instantly covered the entire barrier space.

In an instant, the entire barrier sank nearly a thousand meters, and the flame directly melted the ground.
