Chapter 131: The Shameless Wu Hongchang Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Cousin, it’s him!” The blondie said as he pointed at Qin Yu’s nose.

As soon as he finished speaking, he saw a young man walking over.

He rubbed the ring on his finger and slowly walked over to Qin Yu.

“It’s you who beat up my cousin?” The young man sized up Qin Yu and said.

“Why don’t you ask him why he was beaten up?” Qin Yu sneered.

“I don’t care about that. Since you dared to beat up my cousin, I’ll cripple you today!” The young man snorted coldly.

Qin Yu guessed that he was also an unreasonable person, so he waved his hand and said, “You’d better call Lu Shuming over.”

The young man froze, and then he said angrily, “Mr. Lu has a lot of affairs to attend to every day. How can you call him over so casually?”

“If you don’t call him, I will.” Qin Yu took out his phone and called Lu Shuming.

Soon, Lu Shuming picked up the phone.

He said enthusiastically on the phone, “Mr. Qin, why are you calling me so late at night?”

Qin Yu said, “Mr. Lu, you own Midnight KTV?”

Lu Shuming froze and quickly said, “Yes, I’m at Midnight KTV right now. Do you want to come to have some fun? I’ll arrange it for you right away!”

“No, I’m at Midnight KTV right now. Your manager threatened to cripple me,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Lu Shuming’s expression immediately changed. He hurriedly asked, “Mr. Qin, where are you? I’ll be there right away!”

“Room 888,” Qin Yu said.

“Okay, I’ll be there right away!” Lu Shuming said anxiously.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu looked at the blonde’s cousin.

“Lu Shuming will be here right away,” Qin Yu said nonchalantly.

“Hehe, I think you’ve had too much to drink. Who do you think you are? Do you think you can call for President Lu just because you want to?” The young man couldn’t help but sneer.

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste time with him, so he didn’t say anything more.

The blonde’s cousin snorted coldly. He waved his hand and said, “Let’s cripple him.”

“Break his legs!” The blonde said fiercely from the side.

“No problem.” His cousin’s expression was calm.

These seven to eight strong men immediately walked towards Qin Yu. They looked fierce, and it was obvious that they weren’t to be trifled with.

At this moment, the door of the private room was suddenly opened.

Then, they saw Lu Shuming standing at the door as he panted.

When he saw Lu Shuming, the blonde’s cousin froze.

He hurriedly went up to him. He said obsequiously, “Mr. Lu, why are you here?”

Lu Shuming ignored him and walked to Qin Yu quickly.

“Mr. Qin, are you okay?” Lu Shuming said somewhat anxiously.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m fine, Mr. Lu. The manager of your KTV is so impressive.”

Lu Shuming’s expression changed. Qin Yu had just saved his life, yet now, such an incident had happened. How could Lu Shuming not panic?

“Mr. Qin, don’t worry. I won’t let him off easily!” Lu Shuming said with a forced smile.

Then, Lu Shuming turned to look at the manager.

At this time, the manager was already scared sh*tless.

He said with a terrified look, “Mr. Lu, I didn’t know he knew you. Please... Please spare me...”

Lu Shuming said coldly, “Spare you? I think you’re too arrogant. You even dare to offend Mr. Qin!”

The manager hurriedly knelt in front of Qin Yu and begged desperately, “Mr. Qin, I know I was wrong. Please forgive me this time...”

“Alright, you guys can drag him out.” Lu Shuming waved his hand impatiently.

“Yes, Mr. Lu.” The seven to eight strong men immediately changed their stances and dragged the manager out.

Not far away, the yellow-haired man was trembling with fear. He didn’t expect Qin Yu to have such powerful connections!

“Sir, I... I was wrong...” the yellow-haired man said with quivering lips.

But the yellow-haired man didn’t expect Qin Yu to completely ignore him.

It was obvious that Qin Yu didn’t take this yellow-haired man seriously at all. No matter how he pleaded, he was still ignored.

This made the yellow-haired man feel extremely humiliated, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

Lu Shuming walked to Qin Yu’s side and said, “Mr. Qin, let’s go to the private room next door and chat.”

Qin Yu glanced at Sun Ying, who was barely conscious on the sofa, and shook his head. “Forget it. I still have something to do, so I won’t chat anymore.”

Lu Shuming didn’t say anything more and nodded in agreement.

Then, Qin Yu picked up Sun Ying and walked out of the KTV.

“Do you know where her home is?” After getting into the car, Qin Yu looked at Chen Xin and asked.

Chen Xin said with some surprise, “Aren’t you her brother-in-law? You actually don’t know where her home is?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I’ve never been there,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

Chen Xin secretly stuck out her tongue, and then said, “Then I’ll take you there.”

Qin Yu agreed, and then signaled Yao Qing to drive.

...

In the Liu family’s villa.

“Dad, you absolutely can’t let it go like this. You absolutely can’t give the Water Dragon Cave to Qin Yu!” Liu Shihui said through gritted teeth.

Liu Yi glanced at him and snickered. “Of course. During this period of time, I sent someone to Jingdu to investigate and confirmed that the Yan family won’t interfere.”

When he heard this, Liu Shihui’s eyes immediately lit up and said somewhat excitedly, “Really?”

“Absolutely.” A cold look flashed in Liu Yi’s eyes.

“Since the Yan family won’t interfere, I definitely won’t let him off the hook!” Liu Yi said with a sinister expression.

The reason the Liu family kept a low profile during this period of time was because they had sent people to Jingdu.

After knowing that the Yan family wouldn’t interfere, Liu Yi relaxed completely.

“Mr. Liu, a person called Wu Hongchang requests to see you.” At this moment, a subordinate suddenly walked in and said.

“Wu Hongchang?” Upon hearing this name, Liu Yi couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Isn’t he Lu Shuming’s subordinate?”

“Haha, that’s all in the past.” At this moment, Wu Hongchang walked in from outside the door.

He smiled nonchalantly and said, “Mr. Liu, how have you been?”

Liu Yi sized up Wu Hongchang and was a little nervous for a moment.

Because among all the hangers-on of the Liu family, only Tao Shan could deal with Wu Hongchang.

Wu Hongchang noticed Liu Yi’s worried look, so he smiled nonchalantly and said, “Mr. Liu, don’t be nervous. I’m here to defect.”

“Defect?” Liu Yi was even more confused.

“Aren’t You Lu Shuming’s subordinate? As far as I know, Lu Shuming treats you quite well.” Liu Yi asked suspiciously.

Wu Hongchang snorted and said, “A talented person is free to choose his own boss. Moreover, Lu Shuming won’t have any big developments. He’s short-sighted and bad at discerning the real deal from wannabies. I’ve decided not to help him anymore.”

Wu Hongchang’s shamelessness was indeed shocking. He was obviously chased away by the Lu family, but he acted like he had abandoned the Lu family.

“Why should I believe you? Who knows if you were sent by Lu Shuming.” Liu Yi narrowed his eyes and said.

Wu Hongchang laughed loudly and said, “What kind of person am I, Wu Hongchang? I have countless followers! Not to mention that I’m the one who abandoned Lu Shuming.”

At this point, Wu Hongchang paused for a moment and said with a nonchalant smile, “As far as I know, you have a grudge with Qin Yu, right?”

Liu Yi nodded. This matter had already spread throughout South City and even Chuzhou. It wasn’t strange for Wu Hongchang to know.

Wu Hongchang said with a nonchalant smile, “To tell you the truth, I don’t like him either. I’ve decided to seek justice and help the Liu Family salvage its dignity!”
