2218 Returning the Favor

“Boom!”

At the back of Qin Yu turned into nothingness, and a drop of cold sweat dripped down from his forehead.

A wound the size of an arm appeared on his chest. The sword aura alone had caused him so much damage.

The young man stepped forward and held his sword horizontally.

He swept his sword horizontally, slashing out sparks.

That speed was almost instantaneous. Qin Yu barely managed to raise his hands, and his body was sent flying by the terrifying slash.

His hands were almost cut off. At this moment, blood was flowing out of his body. A massive force sent him flying.

The young man walked forward and stepped on Qin Yu’s chest.

“Evil Exterminator, let me search for you. His cultivation technique doesn’t seem like evil cultivation.”

Uncle Ling said.

“There’s no need. I would rather kill a thousand than miss one.”

The young man said indifferently. He looked at Qin Yu as if he was looking at an ant.

The evil extermination held the sword vertically and then slashed down.

All of a sudden, a vine that was several meters thick swept out.

The massive force was like a tornado.

“A little tree demon dares to be so outrageous!”

The evil extermination suddenly changed his direction.

He pointed into the void, and the gigantic vine instantly shattered into countless pieces.

“The Tree Realm descends.”

An aged voice sounded.

The calm thousand-meter space began to shake violently immediately, and countless vines that looked like pythons shot out from the ground.

The hundreds of meters-long vines instantly enveloped the three and covered them.

A white sword light shot out from the top of the vine. Space shattered like glass, and the way collapsed.

The vines that filled the sky disappeared in an instant. The evil exterminator coldly stared at a specific spot in the void.

“It’s too fast. This tree demon should have a spatial supreme treasure.”

Uncle Ling shook his head.

In another space, the elderly man’s face was ashen. He seemed to have suffered severe injuries.

“Daffodil Little Girl.”

Qin Yu was pleasantly surprised. Weren’t they the grandfather and granddaughter he had met when he had just entered purgatory?

Moreover, the daffodil little girl had given him a daffodil petal. He did not expect them to save him again this time.

“Call me Xiaoru, and I’m not a little girl. I’m an adult daffodil girl.”

Xiaoru proudly puffed her small chest and said.

“As expected of an evil exterminator. It instantly broke through the space of the way. It’s terrifying. How did you provoke this person? Logically speaking, he had no reason to attack humans.”

The old man shook his head and said.

“He wanted me to release my divine sense to let them search, but I refused.”

Qin Yu did not mention the netherworld cultivation technique. Even though the two had saved his life, he still maintained a trace of vigilance.

“The people from the Evil Extermination Sect see the demon race as their greatest enemy. You’re considered very lucky to have survived his sword.”

The old man said to him.

“Senior, why did you risk your life to save me?”

Qin Yu could not help but ask curiously.

“You use your previous physical cultivation technique again,” the old man said.

“The Saintly Body Technique?”

Qin Yu circulated his Saintly Body Technique.”

“Who are you to the senior who passed down this cultivation technique to you?”

The old man revealed an excited expression.

“He is my father.”

Qin Yu was also somewhat curious. It seemed that his father had also been to purgatory.

“No wonder Xiaoru said you looked familiar when she first saw you.”

The old man was enlightened and continued.

“The demon race took a much longer time to develop self-cultivated consciousness than humans, and it is even more difficult for plants. Take my locust tree clan for example, it’s only me for tens of thousands of years, and Xiaoru is rarely seen for nearly fifty thousand years. Back then, when I manifested my consciousness, the heavenly tribulation came, and countless Demonic Beast cultivators came to snatch Xiaoru’s inner core. Your father had saved Xiaoru and me.”

The old man raised his head, seemingly reminiscing.

“We followed that lord for a long time. He taught us cultivation techniques and ways to cultivate. After that, we parted ways on level nine of purgatory and never saw each other again. I didn’t expect to be fortunate enough to meet the descendant of my lord today.”

The old man wiped the corners of his eyes.

“Father, what kind of person are you?”

Qin Yu raised his head in a daze. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Back then, when he almost broke down and committed suicide, his father’s words made him find himself. Until now, he was still trying his best to trace his father’s footprints.

“Big brother is so handsome. I miss Big Brother so much.”

Xiaoru said infatuatedly at the side, causing Qin Yu to burst into laughter.

“Humans and demons have different paths. Your father was besieged by many cultivators and suffered severe injuries to save us. Otherwise, I don’t know what that lord’s limit is.”

The old man was full of respect.

“Actually, your strength is not bad. You can dodge the Evil Extermination Sword, but the time you’ve cultivated is too short. Cultivations are counted in thousands of years. Sometimes, a few hundred years would just pass for a retreat.”

The old man stared at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu sighed. How could he have so much time?

The speed in the Hummingbird Space was tremendously fast. While they were talking, they had already entered Solitary Cloud City.

“Qin Yu, there are many mighty realm cultivators in Solitary Cloud City. We will only bring you trouble if we follow you. Besides, we have some things to do. We will part here.”

Elder Huai cupped his fists and said.

“Alright.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Little Brother, when can I see you again?”

Xiaoru looked at Qin Yu pitifully, holding Qin Yu with both hands and refused to let go.

“When I’ve repaired my soul, I’ll go find you! I’ll beat whoever comes, just like a big brother!”

Qin Yu rubbed Xiaoru’s cute little head.

“This is one of my marks. It seals my full power.” Elder Huai handed Qin Yu a piece of vine.

Elder Huai scratched his head and then took out another piece of wood and stuffed it into Qin Yu’s hand.

“This is the hardest piece of wood I’ve refined for more than 10,000 years. It can’t be cut open by cultivators below the Tribulation Transcendence Stage. Keep it to protect yourself.”

Without waiting for Qin Yu to reject, Elder Huai left with Xiaoru.

“Sigh.”

Qin Yu suddenly felt a little emotional. What was a human? What was a demon? And what was a devil?

It was not wrong that humans and demons had different paths.

Some favors might last only a few decades for humans, but for such a long time, Elder Huai and Daffodil Girl had always remembered this favor.

“There’s still a month before that 10,000-year-old ginseng turns into a demon. I’ll take advantage of this time to further advance my cultivation.”

Qin Yu found a place and began to meditate. This place of blood and sea similarly had many villainous creatures.

And also that evil exterminator who had almost killed him. That gaze that looked at him like he was an ant made Qin Yu feel unprecedented pressure.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and began to meditate. As he was afraid of attracting attention, he did not even dare to circulate the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

In his divine sense, the ghostly qi on the divine sense figurine seemed to have become a little denser.

The golden and black internal qi were constantly intertwining, and one of the pupils of the golden figurine had already turned partially black.

It looked very eerie. Qin Yu had a headache. He did not know how to deal with this situation.

Suddenly, his mind stirred, and he began searching for that fragment of memories left by his father.

If there were records related to Satan, it would be helpful for his current situation.
