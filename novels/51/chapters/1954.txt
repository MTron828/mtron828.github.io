1955 The Duel of Secret Technique

Si Shifeng narrowed his eyes and sneered, “So you actually know that you’re going to die? Why did you still dare to come then?”

Qin Yu glanced around, then said with a smile, “If you lose, won’t you die too?”

“Will I lose?”

With a roar, an extremely terrifying and powerful force instantly exploded from his body!

!!

This force formed an incredibly terrifying storm that swept out in all directions with Si Shifeng in the center!

It was as though a hurricane at the scene and implicated everyone. The terrifying pressure made everyone’s heart tremble.

“Is this Si Shifeng’s strength? It’s truly terrifying!” someone exclaimed.

“As expected of the Si family’s heir. Even the experts of the old generation have to be wary of his internal qi!”

On the city wall, the Prince of Great Xia was also shocked.

The people in the surroundings stood in front of the prince to protect him. They were afraid that he would be implicated as he was so weak.

“As expected, Si Shifeng has some ability,” the Prince of Great Xia cried out in shock.

Someone beside him nodded and said, “That’s right. Although he’s not as good as the Si Shiyue of the Si family, he’s still considered top-notch.”

“Look at Qin Yu. He’s actually not affected at all!” At this moment, someone noticed something.

Qin Yu was very close to Si Shifeng, but the collision of the forces did not shock him.

He stood there without moving like a pine tree and looked extremely calm.

Si Shifeng looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, you’re going to pay for what you’ve done!”

After saying this, he suddenly raised his hands, and a circular icy halo appeared in his palms.

The halo hovered on his palm, containing an extremely destructive power!

“Go and die!” After Si Shifeng shouted, his palm ruthlessly slapped Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

The ground underneath Qin Yu’s feet suddenly exploded, and the smoke and dust blocked his vision, causing everyone unable to see.

The surrounding people were all pushed back. In the aftermath of this internal qi, their faces turned ashen!

“What a terrifying Si Shifeng!”

“I’m afraid Qin Yu is dead under this strike!”

“No, Qin Yu’s internal qi is still around!”

The smoke and dust dispersed, revealing Qin Yu’s face.

He stood there without a speck of dust and looked extremely unworldly. This strike did not hurt him in the slightest!

Qin Yu looked at Si Shifeng nearby him and said coldly, “You don’t have to use such a small trick to embarrass yourself. Show me your true ability.”

A cold smile appeared on Si Shifeng’s lips. He placed his hands behind his back and said, “Of course, I know this technique can’t hurt you. This is just an appetizer. Qin Yu, let me see for myself what you’re capable of.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. The internal qi on his body rose rapidly at this moment!

A dazzling golden light burst out of his body, forming a semicircle around him. The semicircle swept into the distance, covering the sky.

The powerful internal qi once again shocked everyone!

Qin Yu’s internal qi was not inferior to Si Shifeng’s in the slightest bit!

At this moment, even Si Shifeng frowned.

“This kid had entered the middle stage of Reversion Void. No wonder!” Si Shifeng said to himself in a low voice.

However, he was not worried. Although Qin Yu had a chaotic body, he was not weak either!

As the heir of the Si family, how could a rogue cultivator be compared to him?

“I was wondering how capable you are. It turned out you’ve just entered the Middle-stage of the Reversion Void,” Si Shifeng said sarcastically.

“Si Shifeng, did you forget something?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

When Si Shifeng heard this, a hint of confusion appeared on his face.

“Don’t forget even Si Shiyu lost to me in the same cultivation realm. What about you?” Qin Yu sneered and said.

As soon as Qin Yu said this, Si Shifeng’s expression changed drastically!

That was right. Si Shiyu and Si Shiyue were the two heroes of the Si family. If Si Shiyu had lost to Qin Yu under the same cultivation realm, how could Si Shifeng fight Qin Yu?

“D*mn! This brat is trying to disrupt Young master Feng’s dao mind!” At this moment, someone noticed something unusual!

Losing the confidence to win a great battle was an incredibly terrifying thing!

“Young Master Feng, don’t listen to this brat’s nonsense. Young Master Yu suppressed his cultivation realm and couldn’t display his normal strength at all!” The Si family members exclaimed in shock.

Hearing this, Si Shifeng’s tense expression relaxed a little.

He was as though reminded, and his expression became peaceful.

“Are you worthy of comparing with Brother Yue?” Si Shifeng regained his spirit , and his face showed a proud expression.

Qin Yu beckoned to Chu Shifeng, saying, “Then you and I don’t need to go through the hassles of back and forth anymore. Let’s end the battle quickly and not waste any time.”

“That’s what I was thinking!” Si Shifeng sneered and said.

After saying that, Si Shifeng took the lead to make a move. He extended his hand and pointed it at the sky. His entire palm flickered with light as if it was transparent. It was incredibly terrifying!

“Big Dipper Slash!” Si Shifeng roared, and his voice shook the heavens as he chopped down with his palm!

Looking into the distance, the void trembled, and a blade-like radiance flashed out. It contained a terrifying aura as if it wanted to cut everything in the world!

...

Soon, someone recognized the technique. The first was the Prince of Great Xia.

The Big Dipper Slash seemed to have cut off everything, and its powerful aura was incredibly terrifying. The sharp blade looked extremely sharp from a distance, but thick at a closer look. The power it emitted alone was enough to shatter the void and shake the mountains and rivers!

“It’s actually an Immortal Emperor’s secret technique. It looks like Si Shifeng wants to use this to uphold the name of the Si family.”

“The Immortal Emperor’s secret technique can outline the Great Dao of heaven and earth. It can shatter mountains and rivers. No matter how strong the chaotic body is, it can’t resist it.”

Everyone’s eyes turned to Qin Yu, wondering how he would deal with this.

The Big Dipper Slash seemed to have cut off everything, and its powerful aura was extremely terrifying. The sharp blade looked extremely sharp from a distance but extremely thick at a close distance. Just the power it emitted was enough to shatter the void and shake the mountains and rivers!

Qin Yu was also shocked. This was the secret technique of the Immortal Emperor. Everyone would be fearful of it.

“Buzz!”

At that moment, Qin Yu made his move. He raised his hands, and numerous Great Dao outlines appeared between his arms!

The movement of his hand alone was enough to show the extraordinary skill of this technique! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“The two are fighting with the Great Dao of heaven and earth. It’s so too terrifying!”

...

“They’re only Reversion Void Stage cultivators, but it’s so easy for them to connect with the Great Dao!”

“What’s the background of Qin Yu? Did he also master the Immortal Emperor’s secret technique?”

“It’s hard to say. He’s from Thunder Courtyard. He might have received the inheritance of Dean Lei or even Immortal Emperor Lei!

The Great Dao was outlined between Qin Yu’s arms. Soon, a circle was quickly outlined.

Upon close inspection, it seemed to be a small world. However, it seemed to be a star upon closer inspection.
