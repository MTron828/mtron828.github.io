2153 Flower Granny Appears

Of course, Dean Lei would not sit still and wait for death. He stood up with difficulty and coldly glanced at Si Liuhe. “You, Si Liuhe, are just a person who bullies the weak by number…”

Si Liuhe’s face revealed a hint of anger when he heard this.

Undoubtedly, as heaven’s favorite, he could not accept such comments.

However, at this moment, a True Saint beside him walked forward and said, “Si Liuhe did not come to challenge you. Today’s matter is a joint affair of the nine great aristocratic families. How is there bullying of the weak by number?

Si Liuhe instantly felt much more comfortable hearing this.

Dean Lei gritted his teeth. He swept his gaze across the crowd and shouted, “Come on! Even if I die, I can still take a few with me!”

Looking at the mad Dean Lei, there seemed to be a hint of concern in everyone’s hearts except Si Liuhe, who was not afraid at all.

He knew that even if Dean Lei went crazy and might be able to kill a True Saint, he could not possibly kill him.

Looking at Dean Lei’s trembling body, Qin Yu, who was not far away, burst into tears.

Dean Lei at this state was no different from risking his life. After this battle, Dean Lei probably would no longer be in this world.

However, at this moment, a palm landed on Dean Lei’s shoulder.

This palm seemed to have come from the depths of time, and the vicissitudes of time had carved numerous marks on its skin.

She was as withered as a piece of ancient wood that had aged through the years. Every wrinkle was like a deep canyon, bearing witness to the merciless carving of time.

The skin tone of the palm resembled a weathered stele that had been through the baptism of wind and rain, imbued with a deep, dark, and aged hue.

This person had appeared beside Dean Lei almost silently, and even Si Liuhe and the others did not notice!

Such a terrifying method shocked everyone!

“It’s better to take a good rest.” The voice entered Dean Lei’s ears. When Dean Lei saw who it was, he heaved a sigh of relief.

“Flower Granny…” Qin Yu could not help but mutter!

Qin Yu had heard a lot of legends about Flower Granny. Rumor had it that she was an extraordinary woman with peerless beauty back then. She was even praised by countless people as the number one in the world and had the possibility of vindicating dao!

But in the end, trapped by her emotions, she disappeared and faded into obscurity, never to be heard of again.

Now that she appeared, everyone was shocked!

Dean Lei’s internal qi dissipated instantly. It seemed that his burdened heart had been set free.

“Fortunately, you came in time,” Dean Lei said bitterly.

Immediately after, without turning his head, he ran directly to Qin Yu’s side and sat down.

“Dean Lei, can Flower Granny handle so many True Saints?” Qin Yu frowned slightly and asked.

Dean Lei waved his hand and said, “Just wait and see.”

Seeing Dean Lei’s incomparable sense of ease in his tone, Qin Yu became even more curious.

What kind of character was Flower Granny? Even Dean Lei admitted defeat?

Not far away, a True Saint stepped forward and scolded coldly, “Old lady, leave quickly and don’t meddle in other people’s business!”

Flower Granny did not say a word. She silently stood there with eyes closed, like an ancient pine tree, experiencing the wind and rain without fear.

The True Saint was about to speak again when Si Liuhe cupped his hands and greeted her, “Flower Granny.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Before everyone was shocked, Yan Tianshi stepped forward and greeted respectfully, “Flower Granny.”

When they heard this, everyone was shocked and taken aback!

“What She’s Flower Granny?”

“That Flower Granny who once captivated the world and made all the heroes in the world flee at the mere sight of her?”

“It is unexpected that Flower Granny is still alive. However, she seems to be different from the legends…”

“Isn’t Flower Granny a lady with her beauty that can topple a nation? This is clearly an old lady…”

Everyone was discussing animatedly as if they could not believe that the person in front of them was Flower Granny.

“Flower Granny,” Si Liuhe cupped his hands and said,” We don’t want to attack Dean Lei. However, this is a serious matter. We must kill Qin Yu.”

Yan Tianshi also nodded.” This kid kidnapped the Yan family’s saintess and almost brought her to the teleportation array. I…”

Before Yan Tianshi could finish, Flower Granny interrupted him and said quietly, “The two of them are in love. Why do you stop them?”

Yan Tianshi was stunned and instantly speechless.

Only then did he remember that Flower Granny was trapped by her emotions and could not vindicate dao back then.

“Flower Granny, my Yan family has our own family plan. Please don’t interfere in this matter,” Yan Tianshi could only bite the bullet and say.

“I can make the decision. As long as Dean Lei doesn’t interfere in this matter, we will definitely not attack him. We will also apologize and compensate him for this matter.”

Si Liuhe, standing by the side, hurriedly said, “That’s right. Our Si family is willing to let our Holy Son follow Dean Lei as compensation for one of his disciples!”

Faced with their “sincerity”, Flower Granny was expressionless. It was obvious that she disagreed with this matter.

The two frowned. Si Liuhe stepped forward and said, “Flower Granny, does this mean you must interfere in this matter?”

Flower Granny glanced at Si Liuhe with her turbid eyes and said in a voice tinged with a touch of age, “I’m from Thunder Courtyard.”

Although it was just a simple sentence, she had made herself clear.

Si Liuhe’s face turned cold as he said coldly, “Flower Granny, I respect you, and that’s why I’m trying to persuade you nicely. However, it’s a fool’s dream for you to stop us!”

Hearing Si Liuhe’s words, a True Saint behind him shouted, “That’s right. Everyone said that you, Flower Granny, were a stunning talent with hopes of vindicating dao. You were even called the number one person in the world, but that’s all in the past!”

“Hehe, many people had the hope of vindicating dao, but they didn’t!”

Many True Saints mocked Flower Granny and did not take her seriously at all.

Only Yan Tianshi seemed to be reluctant. He cupped his hands at Flower Granny again and said, “Flower Granny, please don’t interfere in this matter. The Yan family will definitely reward you heavily after this!”

Flower Granny remained silent. She had her hands behind her back and even closed her eyes slightly.

Si Liuhe was completely enraged. He shouted, “Holy Lord Yan, you don’t have to waste your breath on her! It was said that she was once the number one person in the world, and her strength was unfathomable. I, Si Liuhe, would like to see it for myself!”

Si Liuhe’s internal qi surged as he raised his hands as if he was about to activate some terrifying secret techniques!

Si Liuhe’s internal qi surged around him. It was a powerful internal qi to the extreme as if boundless divine power was boiling in his body.

He raised both his hands, his palms facing the sky. A vast power immediately surged out of his body, following which it evolved into a mysterious rune!

These runes were like the supreme powers of creation in the world. They controlled a mysterious power of life and death, creation and destruction, making people feel incomparably shocked and terrified!
