1857 The Tong Family Sending People Again

Iron Egg was not stupid. He sneered and said, “Qin Yu, are you taking me as your fighter?”

“Just tell me if you’re going or not,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

“You must tell me the benefits I will get,” Iron Egg said with a smile. “If there’re benefits, I might consider it.”

“D*mn it! You don’t need to go then!” Qin Yu lost his patience. After all, it did not make much difference with additional or less one person.

Qin Yu then brought Demon Jingshan to the bottom of the well in Boundless Temple and suppressed him with dharma.

After that, Qin Yu planned to leave.

The moment he reached the door, he saw Iron Egg waiting for him.

With a green foxtail grass in his mouth, he looked at Qin Yu sloppily.

“Where are you going?” Iron Egg asked.

“The Tong family. The Tong family in Zhongzhou. How about it? You don’t dare to go, do you?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“You can’t goad me into doing that,” Iron Egg sneered and said.

“Alright,” Qin Yu spread out his hands and said. “See you again.”

After saying this, Qin Yu quickly left Boundless Temple without looking back.

After returning to Thunder Courtyard, the peak master asked, “How did you deal with him?”

“He’s locked up in Boundless Temple. He probably won’t show up for a while,” Qin Yu answered truthfully.

The peak master nodded and said, “I estimated this mission to be issued in three days at most. You should get prepared.

“After all, we’re going to the Tong family this time. No one knows what kind of foundation the Tong family has.”

“If there’s any danger, you all can leave quickly,” Qin Yu said.

The peak master didn’t say much. As the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak, he naturally had to be responsible for everyone’s safety.

After returning to the cave abode, Qin Yu took out the Life Aura.

Even though this small bottle of Life Aura was not considered rich, the amount was pretty good.

Qin Yu sniffed it and said in a low voice, “If I have enough Life Aura, I might try to improve my physical body”.

Of course, this kind of thing couldn’t be rushed. It was also only a whim.

In the following few days, Qin Yu and Chang Mang stayed together every day, waiting for instructions from the Tong family.

At this moment, the Tong family was also waiting for Qin Yu’s arrival.

Tong Guangqing was the leader of this matter, so he was naturally in charge of the entire matter.

In the main hall, Tong Guangqing kept walking around.

Uncle Guan, sitting by the side, looked quite calm.

“This Qin Yu wouldn’t give up just like that, would he?” Tong Guangqing said with a frown.

“No, he won’t,” Uncle Guan took a sip of tea as if everything was under his control.

Tong Guangqing looked at uncle Guan and said coldly, “If it doesn’t work, I’ll take the Saint Weapon and wait for Qin Yu at Thunder Courtyard!”

“You must not.” Uncle Guan immediately shook his head.

“This matter is no longer as simple as you and I’ve thought. It has been delayed for so long and Qin Yu must have already prepared a foolproof plan,” Uncle Guan continued.

Tong Guangqing was somewhat puzzled and looked at Uncle Guan, waiting for him to continue.

“If he’s really desperate, he’ll likely spread the news about the key to the entire Holy Region before he’s captured,” Uncle Guan said coldly. “Therefore, no matter what, we must keep him within the Tong family’s territory!”

Tong Guangqing was silent. After a while, he suddenly said, “What if Qin Yu told someone about the key before he came to the Tong family?”

“This is what I’m worried about. It is also the reason he must come to the Tong family,” Uncle Guan said calmly.

“As long as he’s captured by us in the Tong family, we’ll be able to search his soul before we kill him.

“If he did tell others, we can also find the other party and get rid of him.”

Tong Guangqing finally understood. He sighed and said, “Looks like I’ll have to send someone to give him some warning…”

As the two were talking, an elderly man suddenly walked in from outside.

Seeing the elderly man, Uncle Guan and the others quickly got up and stood aside respectfully.

It was none other than the current head of the Tong family, Tong Lianyang.

“Father,” Tong Guangqing bowed and greeted him with respect.

Tong Lianyang walked straight through the Great Hall and sat on the throne. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“You’re still not done with the matter?” Ling Lianyang said with a slightly displeased tone.

Tong Guangqing didn’t dare to say anything and immediately looked at Uncle Guan.

Uncle Guan quickly stepped forward and said, “Sir, this matter involves Thunder Courtyard. We must be careful.”

“So what if it’s Thunder Courtyard?” Zhi Lian Yang snorted coldly.

He then waved his hand, and a young man walked in from outside.

This young man’s face was cold and had abundant internal qi. He walked straight in with a majestic gait.

Seeing this young man, Tong Guangqing’s expression changed slightly, and a hint of jealousy flashed in the depths of his eyes.

He walked up to Tong Lianyang, bowed slightly, and greeted him, “Master.”

“Mmm.” Tong Lian Yang nodded, and a look of relief flashed in his eyes.

...

This young man was none other than Tong Lianyang’s personal disciple, Tong Haoyang.

He was only slightly over a hundred years old, but he had reached the middle stage of the Reversion Void.

What was even more exaggerated was that he had once killed eight Reversion Void Stage cultivators of the same cultivation realm as him. He was the number one heaven’s favorite of the Tong family with his abilities far beyond Tong Guangqing’s!

It was also due to this that he had an extremely high status in the Tong family, and was Ling Lianyang’s favorite.

“Haoyang, do you want to go to Thunder Courtyard?” At this moment, Tong Lianyang suddenly spoke.

“I’ll let Master decide on everything,” said Tong Haoyang with a bow.

A faint smile appeared on Tong Lianyang’s face as he said, “Then you go to Thunder Courtyard. With your ability, it’s not difficult for you to get in.”

“Yes, Master.” Tong Haoyang didn’t say much. He immediately got up and walked out of the hall.

After he left, Tong Guangqing and Uncle Guan immediately understood what Tong Lianyang was up to.

“Sir, are you going to let him go to Demon-slaying Peak to kill Qin Yu?” Uncle Guan frowned.

“You’re right,” Ling Lianyang said indifferently.

...

“As long as he becomes a member of Demon-slaying Peak, killing Qin Yu will not be a violation of the rules. Thunder Courtyard can’t do anything either.”

Tong Guangqing gritted his teeth and said, “Father, I can go too!”

“You?” Tong Liangyan shook his head. “With your abilities, I’m afraid Thunder Courtyard will not accept you.”

Tong Guangqing’s pupils suddenly constricted, and blue veins bulged on his forehead like earthworms.

These words undoubtedly dealt a deep blow to Tong Guangqing. A sense of frustration and anger arose spontaneously.

“Alright. The decision is made. With Haoyang’s help, killing Qin Yu is not a difficult thing,” Tong Lianyang said as he stood up.

“I believe in a few days, Haoyang will bring the token and Qin Yu’s corpse back to see me.”
