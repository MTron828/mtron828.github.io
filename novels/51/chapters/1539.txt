Chapter 1540: Chapter 1,540, I’ve changed my mind 

Huai Chang frowned. He tried to struggle, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all.

“Qin Yu, what do you mean?”Huai Chang said with an unfriendly tone.

Qin Yu looked at Huai Chang coldly. He suddenly exerted force with his hand and threw Huai Chang out!

This force was extremely strong. Even though Huai Chang tried his best to stabilize his body, he still failed.

His body crashed into the crushed stones, turning them into fine powder!

The sudden change made everyone dumbstruck.

Yong Ji said with a dark face, “Qin Yu, what are you doing? Why did you suddenly attack Huai Chang?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He looked at everyone and said, “I’ve changed my mind.”

Changed his mind? Changed his mind about what? Wasn’t he toying with them?

Yong Ji also had a bad premonition.

He tried to ask, “Qin Yu, what exactly do you want?”

Qin Yu looked at Yong Ji coldly and said, “Compared to the heavenly cloud sect, I seem to hate the northern lands more.”

When he said this, everyone was shocked!

......

Although he didn’t say it explicitly, everyone knew in their hearts that Qin Yu was planning to stand on the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s side!

The battle situation changed again and again, and this made it difficult for everyone to accept.

“Qin Yu, the enmity between you and the northern lands can be settled after this battle is over. What do you mean by suddenly changing your mind now?”Yong Ji said somewhat unwillingly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. He looked at Yong Ji, he shouted loudly, “At least the Heavenly Cloud sect is working hard to resist the northern lands. They would rather let the heavenly cloud sect become an empty city than protect the ordinary people in the various large cities. This state of mind is not something you can compare with.”

“Qin Yu!”Yong Ji was completely enraged.

He shouted, “Do you know what you’re saying? !”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Looks like I didn’t say it clearly enough. Alright, then I’ll tell all of you. Other than Huai Chang and the others, everyone else, get lost.”

As soon as these words were said, everyone’s expression instantly became extremely defeated!

Qin Yu was determined to protect the heavenly cloud sect!

“Aren’t they enemies? Why did Qin Yu change his mind?”

“Yeah, this person is really weird.”

“Isn’t this F * cking sure that we are in danger? When the Heavenly Cloud sect comes back to their senses, they will definitely take revenge on us!”

“Qin Yu, don’t go too far!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “I don’t want to say it again. Of course, if any of you want to attack me, you can try.”

“Qin Yu, do you think you are invincible? !”Someone shouted in the dark.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He suddenly stretched out his palm and slapped at a certain spot in the air.

“Boom!”

That piece of Void was instantly shattered. The top-notch martial artist hidden in the Void was directly killed by a single palm strike!

The scene instantly fell silent. For a moment, no one dared to say anything.

Qin Yu’s strength had clearly exceeded their imaginations!

“If there’s anyone else who isn’t convinced, feel free to make a move,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu’s gaze directly landed on Yong Ji.

This was almost the same as declaring war with Yong Ji.

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, I saved your life. Have you forgotten?”

Qin Yu sneered, “That’s why I let you leave. Otherwise, just based on the fact that you colluded with the northern lands, I will kill you.”

“Impudent!”Yong Ji instantly flew into a rage!

As one of the top three lunatics, how could he let Qin Yu provoke him like this! !

“Do you think I’m afraid of You? !”Yong Ji took a step forward, full of fighting spirit!

Qin Yu sneered, “Yong Ji, you can try to fight me. Right now, you have just experienced a big battle and your aura is unstable. You are definitely not my match.”

“You!”Yong Ji’s expression became uglier and uglier.

In this battle, regardless of whether he won or lost, it was not a good thing for him.

If he won, everyone would not feel ashamed of Qin Yu.

But if he lost, then he would be completely reduced to a background.

“Qin Yu, since you want to fight, then you can try,”Yong Ji said coldly.

He could not avoid this battle. Otherwise, he would definitely be scolded by others.

“Okay!”Qin Yu didn’t waste any words. He jumped up with the intention of making a move.

“Benefactors, please stop here.”

At this moment, a leisurely voice came from not far away.

Turning around, he saw an old man dressed like a monk appear in front of everyone. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu was very familiar with this old man. He was the mysterious old monk he had met in the temple!

“Monk Hongxi? He’s actually here.”

“Monk Hongxi is also one of the three uniques. His strength is no weaker than Yongji.”

“Does he have to stand on the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s side as well?”

Qin Yu sized up the old monk in front of him and frowned. “It’s You?”

Monk Hongxi bowed slightly to Qin Yu and said, “We meet again.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “So you are monk Hongxi.”

Qin Yu didn’t expect that he had seen so many people among the three lunatics and three uniques a long time ago.

“Monk of Hongxi, what are you doing here?”Yong Ji asked coldly.

On the surface, he looked extremely cold, but in fact, he was very happy deep down.

The arrival of the monk of Hongxi naturally gave him a way to retreat. How could he not be happy.

Even so, he could not lose face.

Yong Ji took a step forward and said coldly, “Do you want to participate in this matter too?”

The monk from Hongxi bowed slightly and said, “The fight between the two of you has already caused too many casualties. Why do you have to force me?”

Yong ji sneered and said, “If I retreat today, the Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely seek revenge on me in the future. Have you ever thought about that?”

Hearing this, the first elder who was not far away hurriedly said, “On behalf of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, I promise you that our Heavenly Cloud sect will never seek revenge on you in the future!”

He seemed to be afraid that Yong Ji would not believe him, so he hurriedly said, “I will never go back on my words in front of so many people, including everyone here!”

The monk of the great dawn cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Yong Ji, I believe you have heard the first Elder’s words.”

Yongji narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly, “I will believe you if you swear on your primordial spirit.”

At this moment, the first elder did not think too much in order to save his life. He immediately followed Yongji’s request and swore on his primordial spirit.

After hearing these words, Yongji heaved a sigh of relief.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You ungrateful thing, I will not let you off.”

Qin Yu similarly sneered and said, “You hypocrite, I won’t let you off either.”

Yong Ji coldly snorted. He didn’t say anything more and turned to leave.

No one had expected that this battle would end like this.

And no one had expected that Qin Yu and Yong Ji would actually become enemies.
