Chapter 698: Exposing the Inside Story! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“This Qin Yu... wants to kill Qu Xie?” Yan Sihai was surprised when he saw the video.

“Hehe, this is the efficiency of Jingdu Martial Arts Association. It’s really ridiculous,” Han Xiu sneered.

He pushed the door open, turned his head, and rushed toward the Taoism Theory Library.

Other than Han Xiu, there were also several people rushing to the library.

Qin Yu stood above the Taoism Theory Library. He looked at Qu Xie who was locked in a cage, a trace of madness flashed across his face.

“Qin Yu, let me go!” Qu Xie’s face had a trace of fear.

At this moment, he didn’t care about his dignity anymore.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He stretched out his hand and took out the bronze sword.

The scarlet sword was in his hand, and traces of killing intent spread from the blade.

Qu Xie couldn’t help but tremble when he felt this killing intent.

“Qin Yu, if you let me go, I can withdraw from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!” Qu Xie roared crazily.

“As you know, I’m just a pawn. I don’t have the final say in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“I’m just following the orders of the higher-ups behind me! Please spare me!”

As soon as he said that, there was an uproar!

“What? Qu Xie doesn’t have the final say in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“Who are the higher-ups Qu Xie is talking about? Even Qu Xie is just a pawn?”

“What secret is Jingdu Martial Arts Association hiding? What roles are the so-called higher-ups behind playing?”

At that instant, everyone was talking about this matter!

Qu Xie roared maniacally, “That’s right! I am just a pawn. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has eight higher-ups behind it!”

“They control all the resources. They know where in Pyro and even the entire world possess abundant cultivation resources!”

Qu Xie seemed to have gone mad as he continued to shout out, “They have sealed off all the cultivation resources, making us deceive our superiors and subordinates, and keep everyone in the dark!

“Even the leaders of Pyro are completely unaware of this!

“If not for Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s blockade of the martial arts resources, everyone’s cultivation would not have been so difficult!”

Hearing those words, Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes.

Qin Yu knew nothing about this information! Qu Xie had never told Qin Yu either!

“Is what you said true?” Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie and couldn’t help but frown.

Qu Xie sneered, “Of course, it’s true, it’s absolutely true!”

Qu Xie originally thought that Jingdu Martial Arts Association would send someone to save him, so he hid it in his heart. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Even when Qin Yu interrogated him, he didn’t tell him about this.

But until now, no one from Jingdu Martial Arts Association had come to save him. This had caused Qu Xie to be in total despair!

He looked at everyone’s camera and shouted, “Film me, come, I want to tell you all the truth!

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has been lying and deceiving Pyro many times, treating the public resources as their own, and going against their original intentions!

“They have used a special method to seal the spiritual energy. As soon as they discover it, it will become their private resource!

“Not only that but they also...”

“President Qu, what nonsense are you talking about?” At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared at the door.

At a glance, a man with a hooked nose appeared at the entrance of the Taoism Theory Library.

This man was short. He had white eyebrows and a forehead full of wrinkles.

However, his internal qi and spirit were extremely powerful and incomparable. No one dared to ignore him!

Other than that, this man was holding a weapon that looked like a crossbow.

“President Qu, you can’t simply say such things,” the hooked nose man said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “Who are you?”

The hooked nose man said with a faint smile, “I’m an old friend of President Qu. I’m here to save him.”

“Who is your friend?!” Qu Xie suddenly roared!

“This person’s name is Ao Zhan! He’s the mastermind of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“Not only that, but Ao Zhan was also a criminal who committed heinous crimes! The Jingdu Martial Arts Association announced that they were going to execute him, but they then turned him into one of their own!” Qu Xie roared crazily!

When he said this, everyone was shocked!

Qu Xie gritted his teeth and said, “This is the virtue of Jingdu Martial Arts Association. On the surface, they are protecting the martial arts world, but in fact, they are all protecting their own interests!”

“Whoosh!”

Just as Qu Xie was roaring crazily, a beam of light suddenly shot over!

Its speed was far faster than Qin Yu could imagine.

In almost an instant, it shot into the space between Qu Xie’s eyebrows!

A seemingly blood-red flower suddenly bloomed between Qu Xie’s eyebrows!

“You are full of nonsense.”

Qin Yu glanced at Qu Xie in the dog cage. Qu Xie’s divine sense was directly blown away by his attack!

“What a vicious method,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Even Qin Yu wouldn’t kill Qu Xie’s divine sense in this manner!

“Ao Zhan? I remember now!” At this moment, someone seemed to recognize Ao Zhan!

“Just as Qu Xie said, Ao Zhan was an unpardonable criminal! The Jingdu Martial Arts Association claimed that they had executed him!”

“Ao Zhan... Yes, that murderous maniac!”

“Not only did Jingdu Martial Arts Association not punish him, they even took him under their wings?! Is this the so-called official of the martial arts world?!”

For a moment, everyone was cursing Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

A trace of chill flashed across Qn Yu’s face.

He looked at Ao Zhan in front of him and couldn’t help but sneer, “It seems that as long as you’re useful to Jingdu Martial Arts Association, you can be spared from death no matter what crime you have committed.

“But if it is useless, you will be sentenced to death even if you are slightly disrespectful.

“You still dare to claim that you are the official of the martial arts world? What a joke! Right or wrong, it is up to you to decide, isn’t it?”

Ao Zhan narrowed his eyes.

He had never thought that Qu Xie would suddenly reveal everything this time!

After all, Jingdu Martial Arts Association didn’t allow outsiders to know the relationship between him and the association!

Ao Zhan took a deep breath. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Since all you know about it now, I can only kill all of you!”

Hearing this, everyone immediately turned pale with fright and fear!

Ao Zhan waved his hand and directly blocked the way and the door!

“No one can escape today,” Ao Zhan said coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and said, “Do you think I’m afraid of you?”

Beside Qin Yu were the two masked guardians, Burly and Robust!

Although it was just a physical body, Martial Marquis was definitely not comparable to it!

Ao Zhan played with the crossbow in his hand and sneered, “Killing you is just a matter of raising my hand.”
