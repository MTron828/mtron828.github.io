Chapter 1234: Chapter 1,234, the endangered old Mister Yan 

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he said in a low voice, “You mean... this bottomless abyss is related to the ancient times?”

“That’s right, I did have such suspicions,”Deer Emperor said.

“I don’t want to hide it from you. Before this, I had publicly selected volunteers to step into this bottomless abyss.”

“However, everyone who stepped into it did not come out. In fact, the moment they stepped into it, their internal Qi mysteriously disappeared.”

Qin Yu frowned. With his current knowledge, he had no way of knowing the origin of the bottomless abyss.

Could it be that this place was connected to another world? Or could it be that this was a passage similar to a teleportation formation?

“Although this bottomless abyss is strange and unpredictable, it has indeed brought me many treasures,”deer emperor said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

“Little Friend Qin, no one knows what treasures are hidden in this bottomless abyss, but I firmly believe that the treasures inside are definitely not inferior to those in the Holy Region.”

Qin Yu glanced at deer emperor and said, “Could it be that you want me to jump in to search for treasures?”

Deer emperor laughed and said, “I’m only telling you about the existence of the bottomless abyss. As for what you choose, that’s up to you. After all... risks and opportunities coexist.”

Qin Yu was also a bit conflicted.

Deer Emperor took out a few treasures. These treasures all emitted an extremely ancient aura. The internal Qi of these treasures was extremely ancient.

Although Qin Yu’s ability was unable to discern the origin of these treasures, the ancient aura of these treasures could indicate that they were extraordinary.

And all of this came from the bottomless abyss. This could indeed prove the mystery of the bottomless abyss.

“Little friend Qin, I have never told outsiders the secret of the bottomless abyss,”deer emperor said, intentionally or unintentionally.

Qin Yu looked at Deer Emperor and nodded. “This place is indeed quite mysterious, and it is very likely to contain unimaginable treasures. It’s just that... the risk is too great.”

Now was the crucial moment to set foot into the holy region. Qin Yu had waited for so long and was about to set foot into the holy region to meet Yan Ruoxue. It was really not worth taking such a risk at this time.

Deer Emperor nodded slightly and said, “That’s fine too. But please keep it a secret for the bottomless abyss, Little Friend Qin.”

“Of course.”Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

“Alright. In that case, little friend Qin, why don’t you follow me to the hall for a chat?”Deer Emperor stretched out his hand and said.

Although Qin Yu didn’t want to be friends with deer emperor, this deer emperor had indeed given Qin Yu a great deal of face.

As the saying goes, one shouldn’t hit a smiling face with one’s hand, so Qin Yu couldn’t go too far, so he nodded and agreed.

The two of them came to Deer Emperor’s hall, and Deer Emperor sent someone to brew a pot of tea.

This tea was not simple, and it contained powerful spiritual Qi.

One mouthful of it was refreshing.

Although this tea could not be compared to the Enlightenment tea, it was far superior to ordinary herbs!

“This tea also comes from the bottomless abyss. Bring some with you when you leave later,”Deer Emperor said with a smile.

Qin Yu put down the teacup and sighed, “As the saying goes, one has to rely on mountains and rivers to survive. You can rely on this bottomless abyss to develop a top-tier sect.”

“That’s right!”Deer Emperor nodded.

“At the same time, I’m also worried. I’m afraid that one day someone will snatch the bottomless abyss away. This is also why I must rope you in.”

Qin Yu was silent. This bottomless abyss had brought so many treasures to deer emperor. No wonder he was nervous.

“You told me about the bottomless abyss. Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill you and take it for myself?”Qin Yu questioned coldly.

Deer Emperor waved his hand and said, “I don’t believe you will do that, because it won’t do you any good.”

“I have already shared the bottomless abyss with you. Why do you need to waste your energy to kill me?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

Deer Emperor’s train of thought was quite clear. No wonder he could stay in Deer Emperor Island for so many years.

“Okay.”Since they had already talked about this, Qin Yu couldn’t refuse anymore.

“I can only tell you that if there is a chance in the future, I will help you.”

Lu Huang smiled and said, “Your words are enough.”

Qin Yu stood up and was about to leave when he suddenly thought of something.

“I am not sure. You have put in so much effort, but you and I still have not become friends. Is there a point in doing this?”Qin Yu frowned and said.

Deer Emperor took a sip of tea and said indifferently, “At least we’re not enemies. This is a positive and a negative. It means a lot to me.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Okay, see you in the future.”

The two of them were in different situations, so their thoughts were definitely different. Therefore, they were destined not to be friends.

Comparatively, Qin Yu preferred people like Chang Mang.

After turning around and walking out of the castle, Qin Yu returned to the hotel.

Seeing Qin Yu return, Di Zun ran up and said, “Master, that Deer Emperor didn’t make things difficult for you, right?”

Qin Yu shook his head and then said, “He gave me a lot of inspiration.”

“Ah?”Di Zun scratched his head, as if he didn’t quite understand.

Qin Yu didn’t explain to Di Zun.

That bottomless abyss gave Qin Yu endless reveries, letting him know that the world was definitely not what it looked like now. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Just how many secrets were still hidden on this ancient star, and it still needed to be developed.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

Picking up the phone, he saw that it was an unfamiliar number from Jingdu.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. With suspicion, he picked up the phone.

As soon as the call was connected, he heard the deep voice of a middle-aged man from the other end.

This person was none other than Yan Ruoxue’s father, Yan Yongxiu.

He said in a somewhat sorrowful tone on the phone, “Qin Yu, my father is...”

“HMM? What happened to old Mister Yan?”Qin Yu suddenly had a bad feeling in his heart.

Yan Yongxiu said in a deep voice, “My father is...”

“Damn it, it’s so hard to say a word! He’s already dead by the time you’re Done!”At this moment, the phone was snatched by Yan Sihai.

He said on the phone, “Qin Yu, my father is about to die. If you want to see him one last time, come to the Yan family’s manor.”

After saying this, Yan Sihai directly hung up the phone.
