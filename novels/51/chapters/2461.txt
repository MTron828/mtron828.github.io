Chapter 2462 Moon Demon Godly King

Flower Granny and Lei Xin went up to them. Wherever Flower Granny Hua passed, the petals fell from the sky, and the monster race that came into contact with the petals would be cut into several pieces. Lei Xin also transformed into the body of the Thunder God, and wherever he went, the monster race that came into contact with him turned into dust.

In less than a minute, the two had directly killed these 3,000 monster races.

“Buzz!”

Suddenly, Qin Yu sensed Evil Eye in his hand a little strange. The souls of the dead monster race were actually guided by Evil Eye.

Evil Eye’s sword hilt absorbed the power of the origin of the souls bit by bit, which then slowly spread throughout the entire Evil Eye.

As the power of the origin of the souls entered Evil Eye, Qin Yu seemed to sense the exciting cheers and lively sounds of jumping sparrows coming from the sword.

“Just nice. I’ll let you devour as much as you want today.”

Qin Yu’s killing intent flashed. He would not have any pity for this monster race.

The power of annihilation!

He instantly appeared in the monster race army like a demon god, and the vast annihilation domain suddenly spread out.

The bodies of nearly 5,000 of the monster race around him instantly burned with black flames.

In an instant, not even bones were left.

“Ding! Ding!”

The ghostly sword bell emitted an eerie and chilling ringing sound. As the sound wave spread, the souls seemed to have been summoned again and slowly swam toward Evil Eye.

The instant these monster race souls approached Qin Yu, they were also instantly devoured by Evil Eye.

“Attack immediately. Don’t let these monster race armies charge.”

Following Qin Yu’s attack, Lei Xin commanded his people to charge into the monster race army.

As long as these monster race armies did not charge in formation, the danger they faced would be much lesser.

After these monster races died, wisps of green power of the origin of their consciousness were sucked and entered Evil Eye.

Qin Yu felt that as the power of the soul entered, the sorcerer tribe’s Sain’t Weapons, the scarecrow hilt, the Soul-hunting Bell, and the bone of Fengdu seemed to be more closely connected. The power of the soul seemed to have the effect of tempering Evil Eye.

At this moment, the green Evil Eye sword emitted a layer of green light, giving off a tremendously illusory feeling.

In less than an hour, under everyone’s attack, this monster race army had only 10,000 people left.

An enormous figure slowly emerged from the smoke.

Was it finally here?

Qin Yu stared at the enormous phantom. It should be the commander of this army. He did not attack as if waiting for the army to exhaust the strength of Qin Yu and the others.

At this moment, a nearly 5,000 monster race army carried a golden throne and slowly advanced again.

A hundred-foot-tall monster race with a mountain-like body walked down expressionlessly.

The moment he landed, the entire continent was as if tilted by his enormous force.

“Cang Ming!”

The 10,000 monster race let out earth-shaking roars.

“A monster race general in the Tribulation Transcending Stage. As for the exact level, it’s hard to judge! Be careful!”

Lei Xin reminded everyone that this was not a competition.

On the battlefield, everyone was going all out. Life and death were within an instant.

Lei Xin was afraid that Qin Yu and the others would hold back their strength, so he quickly reminded them. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Boom!”

He picked up the spiked club that was dragging on the ground.

The instant he picked it up, even the sun in the sky seemed to be blocked by the massive weapon, and darkness descended in an instant.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu directly received it.

Singularity space!

The power of the spatial blurry rune directly surged into his hands.

After that, an earth-shattering force clashed with the spiked club.

“Rumble!”

Nearly 30,000 spatial distortions spread out. After the entire space flipped, it emitted a dreamy and dazzling light.

Everyone felt as if they had entered a kaleidoscope world.

Under the massive force, the 30,000 space shattered almost instantly in the blink of an eye. Then, the spiked club and Qin Yu’s fist in the cosmic form clashed.

The clash between the two attacks was a tremendous physical clash.

A man and a monster retreated quickly. Qin Yu almost could not feel anything from half of his body.

“What a terrifying power! If it wasn’t for the fact that the Singularity Space had already neutralized half of the power, I’m afraid I would have been severely injured by this attack!”

His current body could erupt with the power of the Tribulation Third Level.

Coupled with the cosmic form, it could be said to have reached the power at the peak of the third level.

However, he still did not gain an advantage in the physical clash. This was enough to show how terrifying Cang Ming was.

Cang Ming slowly stood up from the ground and sat back on the golden throne.

The remaining soldiers raised the golden chariot and slowly retreated.

“You want to leave?”

Lei Xin sneered.

Ninth Heaven Divine Thunder!

Just as he was about to use the technique, he suddenly felt a tremendous palpitation.

The air before him rippled like water, and a pitch-black arrow suddenly appeared.

The enormous power only erupted when it appeared.

“Boom!”

Yan Ruoxue moved her fingers, and the space beneath Lei Xin’s feet changed.

“Boom!”

In the blink of an eye, the dark arrow brushed past them like black lightning and crashed into the depths of the continent. A terrifying explosion then sent everyone flying.

A heaven-shaking force suddenly transmitted over. When they looked behind them, they gasped.

Behind them, nearly one-tenth of the Solitary Shadow Continent had become a bottomless abyss.

A boundless abyss appeared in front of him. A breath ago, this was still a flat plain.

The power of an arrow was so terrifying.

On the peak in the distance, a monster race the size of a human slowly stood on the peak.

“Moon deity! Moon deity!”

The monster race army roared.

“Looks like this is one of the eight Godly Kings of the monster race, the Moon Demon Godly King.”

Lei Xin’s face turned ashen.

Even though Ruoxue attacked in time, nearly one-third of his body was cut open, and a portion of his internal organs were taken away by that massive force.

“What a speedy arrow! What a terrifying power!”

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. If Yan Ruoxue had not discovered this fluctuation in time, Lei Xin would have died here.

“You guys enter the Sumeru ring first. I’ll meet this person.”

Qin Yu put everyone back into the Sumeru ring. There was no monster race army now.

Facing such a terrifying person, more people would become a weakness.

Qin Yu stared at the purple-haired monster race. This person was holding a bow and arrow, and the bowstring in his hand was extremely tiny.

Even the skeleton that supported the entire bow was like a strand of hair.

It was hard to imagine that such a thin bowstring could unleash such a devastating blow. Qin Yu tapped his foot.

His divine sense had already locked onto this monster race, and the sea of the Path of Heaven rippled.

A wisp of the power of the sorcerer tribe bit the moon deity’s internal qi, and the pitch-black power of the sorcerer tribe slowly extended into the moon deity’s body like maggots.

“Lock on.”

Qin Yu suddenly landed in front of him, and the moon deity in front of him revealed a strange dangerous expression as if he was not nervous at all.
