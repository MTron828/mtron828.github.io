1794 The Powerful Primordial Spirit

Although they were all aggressive, the atmosphere was quite harmonious.

Soon, Cao Huang was in front of Qin Yu.

He looked at Qin Yu in front of him and said proudly, “Kid, this time no one can help you. I don’t believe Jue Wu will take action against me in front of so many people.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “As long as you keep your word, there’s no need for Jue Wu to take action…”

“Alright! Alright! I, Cao Huang, will do as I’ve said,” Cao Huang said.

After saying that, he directly suppressed his internal qi to the Mighty Realm.

“Since your primordial spirit is damaged, I’ll suppress my cultivation realm to the Advanced-stage of Mighty Realm. I’m not bullying you, am I?” Cao Huang said as he waved his thick arm.

“I’m fine with the Peak of Mighty Realm or even half-step Reversion Void Stage,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

The Advaned-stage Mighty Realm was even lower than Qin Yu’s realm. In that case, Cao Huang probably would not have had the power to fight back.

However, Cao Huang said with extreme confidence, “No, there’s no need. I can easily crush you at the Advanced-stage Mighty Realm!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help raising his eyebrows and said, “Then you’re going to be embarrassed.”

“Stop bragging, kid!” Cao Huang sneered and said. “Today, I’ll let you experience the pain I suffered last time!”

With that, the internal qi on Cao Huang’s body exploded. He then threw a punch at Qin Yu’s face!

Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch. He only looked at Cao Huang coldly, allowing his fist to land on his face.

A loud “clang” was heard at this moment!

Cao Huang was instantly forced back a few steps, and his wrist was in great pain!

A trace of surprise flashed across his face as he said in disbelief, “How is this possible?”

Not only Cao Huang, but also the surrounding people were also discussing in hushed voices.

Qin Yu shook his neck and said, “I forgot to tell you that my physical body has reached the Reversion Void Stage. Your fist can’t hurt me at all.”

Cao Huang squinted his eyes and said in a low voice, “Your physical body entered the Reversion Void Stage first? You have some ability… If that’s the case, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

With that, Cao Huang let out a furious roar. A terrifying radiance appeared in both his hands. The radiance was like obsidian, bright and hard as if it was going to suppress everything!

“Ha!”

With a roar, Cao Huang held the radiance in his hands and pressed it down on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked up at the radiance, and his body emitted a golden light.

Following that, Qin Yu suddenly threw out a punch to meet the attack.

“Boom!”

There was a loud explosion at this moment. The beam of radiance was shattered by Qin Yu’s punch and disappeared without a trace!

Everyone instantly became even more shocked.

They were well aware of Cao Huang’s strength, and even more so of the horror of this technique!

But it was now easily resolved by Qin Yu, which was really puzzling!

Qin Yu looked at Cao Huang coldly and said, “I’ll give you one more chance. Raise your strength to the Peak of Mighty Realm. Otherwise, you won’t have another chance.”

Although Cao Huang was shocked a little, he refused to believe it. He adjusted his internal qi, and his terrifying technique appeared again.

Qin Yu frowned and said coldly, “It’s time for me to make a move.”

With that, the internal qi on Qin Yu’s body instantly exploded. His feet stepped on the line word formula, and he appeared in front of Cao Huang almost instantly!

Cao Huang was shocked, and his expression changed drastically!

It was simply too fast!

Even his technique didn’t have the time to react!

The golden fist was approaching Cao Huang!

This punch contained terrifying extreme power.

Although Cao Huang had suppressed his cultivation realm to the Mighty Realm, his physical body was still the Reversion Void Body. If he did not use his full strength, it would be difficult for him to end the battle with this punch.

“Boom!”

As Cao Huang’s eyes widened, Qin Yu’s fist landed on his body.

“Bang!”

Cao Huang’s body was directly smashed into the ground, creating a huge hole.

The surroundings were silent.

They didn’t seem to have expected such an outcome.

“It seems like the rumors about him are true!”

“His primordial spirit is damaged, but he still has such terrifying battle prowess?”

“Tsk! Tsk! If he steps into the Reversion Void stage, his strength will probably be among the top few in Demon-slaying Peak!”

The surrounding people were discussing spiritedly. They seemed to be shocked by Qin Yu’s strength.

The peak master in the crowd also nodded slightly. He placed his hands behind his back and muttered, “No wonder even Xiao Sheng also recommended him. He really does have some ability.”

At this moment, Cao Huang suddenly dashed out from the ruins.

His body was covered in blood, and he was panting heavily. It was a terrible sight.

Qin Yu looked at Cao Huang in surprise.

He could actually still stand up?

It was as expected of someone who was able to enter Thunder Courtyard. If he were anyone else, he would have been on the verge of death if not killed by a single punch.

Looking at Cao Huang in front of him, Qin Yu remained silent, waiting for him to continue.

If he wanted to continue fighting, Qin Yu certainly would not be afraid.

“D*mn it, I’ve underestimated my enemy.” After a while, Cao Huang retracted his internal qi and muttered softly.

“Hahaha! Cao Huang, you’re really embarrassing.”

“That’s right. You were almost killed by a newbie with one punch. You’re done for in the future!”

“F*ck you! I only underestimated the enemy!” Cao Huang cursed at his surroundings.

However, the crowd burst into laughter. They kept making fun of Cao Huang.

On the other hand, Cao Huang was not angry. Instead, he looked at Qin Yu.

“You’re quite capable, kid,” Cao Huang muttered.

“I’m not your match,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “If you raised your cultivation realm to the Peak of Mighty Realm, I might not be your match.”

Cao Huang was stunned. Of course, he knew that Qin Yu was giving him a way out. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said triumphantly, “Did you guys hear that? If we were in the same cultivation realm, I would definitely win!”

The crowd in the surroundings was still laughing. But of course, they were just joking.

“Kid, when you reach the Reversion Void stage, let’s fight again!” Cao Huang said.

“Alright. It’s a deal,” Qin Yu agreed and said.

After leaving, Qin Yu went straight back to the cave abode.

He could clearly feel that ever since the power of his primordial spirit had increased, his strength had increased as well.

For Qin Yu, this seemed to be a new way of cultivation.

After the previous dao lecture, Qin Yu vaguely felt that there were signs of a breakthrough.

He was only a step away from reaching the half-step Reversion Void stage.

This speed had far exceeded Qin Yu’s expectations.

With the help of devouring primordial spirits, the time it took for him to reach the Reversion Void Stage seemed to be rapidly decreasing.

“If I can control my inner demons, I might have a chance to close the gap,” thought Qin Yu.

Qin Yu, who had been worried, had figured it out at this moment. And he was now feeling much more comfortable.
