1896 The Same Path

At this moment, Chang Mang’s entire body was emitting red light, and his terrifying battle intent was spine-chilling.

Saintess Gu, by the side, couldn’t help but be surprised. She looked at Chang Mang and said, “Holy body? A chaotic body and a holy body. Interesting.”

But Chang Mang couldn’t be bothered. He clenched his fists and glared at Yan Yunfan.

Yan Yunfan was so angry that his chest heaved up and down. As the holy son of the Yan family, he had never been treated like this before.

!!

“Mr. Yan, forget about it. Since the sanctum has appeared, everyone is entitled to enter based on their abilities.” Saintess Gu tried to smooth things over.

Yan Yunfan gritted his teeth. He looked at Chang Mang coldly and said, “I’ll remember you.”

“I’ll also remember you.” Chang Mang refused to be outdone.

Qin Yu patted Chang Mang’s shoulder, indicating for him to leave for the time being.

Chang Mang did not have the protection of the holy robe. Thus he would definitely be at a disadvantage if he were to fight here.

Fortunately, Chang Mang didn’t dwell on it too much. He only said, “If there’s anything, remember to call out to me.”

After he left, Qin Yu looked at Yan Yunfan and said with a smile, “Saintess Gu has said that everyone is entitled to enter. It’s just a matter of ability.”

Yan Yunfan snorted and said, “It’s up to you whether you want to enter. But I’m warning you, don’t come with us. The Master of Path of Heaven was invited by us.”

Qin Yu glanced at the two elders and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t take advantage of you.”

Yan Yunfan couldn’t be bothered by Qin Yu anymore. He turned around and walked to the side to chat with Si Shifeng.

Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

He actually did not want to be enemies with Yan Yunfan. After all, Qin Yu still wanted to enter the Yan family and find an opportunity to get in touch with Yan Ruoxue.

Once he offended Yan Yunfan, he would probably not have any chance.

After a while, under the gentle voice of Saintess Gu, everyone stepped into the sanctum. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The sanctum had an enormous entrance like a city gate. A few people stepped in.

Qin Yu followed closely and went in.

After stepping into the sanctum, one could see the array platform one after another inside. In addition to the array platform, the sanctum was winding with numerous small paths.

Qin Yu could deeply feel the terrifying killing intent in the sanctum. Even a wisp of it was incredibly frightening. It hit the holy robe, making the “bang” sound continuously.

The two elders were deducing the dao technique and comprehending the Path of Heaven, trying their best to avoid the killing formations in this sanctum.

The terrifying killing formation had distorted the space, and even time seemed to have been affected.

Therefore, the two elders’ deduction was not easy. They sweated from time to time and were quite tired.

However, no one dared to neglect the killing formation in the sanctum. It was set up by the Tribulation Stage great cultivator and would trigger the dao technique of heaven and earth. If it was triggered inadvertently, death was inevitable.

Qin Yu looked much more relaxed. He had a detailed map in his mind, so he could effortlessly shuttle through the sanctum.

After walking for a long time, Qin Yu’s route was exactly the same as the Saintess Gu’s.

Yan Yunfan’s expression turned cold, and he said, “Why do you keep following us? I’ve warned you not to take advantage of the Master of Path of Heaven we’ve invited.”

“Who’s following you?” Qin Yu sneered and said. My deduction is exactly the same as yours, and we’re both walking on the correct path. On what basis you said that I’m following you?”

“Deduction? Do you know how to deduce? You’re talking nonsense,” Yan Yunfan snorted coldly and said.

“I’m too lazy to explain it to you,” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

In this sanctum, no one dared to act rashly. Therefore, even though Yan Yunfan was angry, he could only endure it.

“If you’re taking advantage, then you’re. There’s no need to find excuses for yourself,” Si Shifeng also snorted and said.

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste time talking to them. He moved forward step by step based on his memory.

The two elders were indeed quite capable. The path they had deduced was precisely the same as Qin Yu’s, which was enough to prove that the two of them had taken the right path.

In front of them, there were stone tablets erected one after another. At the same time, they emitted an incredibly frightening terrifying dark energy

It seemed like a natural and perfect formation that no one could control. It was a natural formation released by a Tribulation Stage great cultivator after his death.

As for the two elders, they seemed to be getting more fatigued. Their internal qi became somewhat chaotic as if they were about to suffer a backlash.

At this moment, a man suddenly appeared in front of them.

This man didn’t emanate any internal qi. However, the moment he appeared, everyone’s expression changed!

“Hurry up and avoid him. Otherwise, we’ll all die here today!” the Master of Path of Heaven quickly said.

Following that, the Master of Path of Heaven pulled everyone to the other path.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the man seemed to have seen Qin Yu and the others. Two terrifying beams of light shot out of his eyes as he approached them!

Even though the Master of Path of Heaven was tremendously fast, Si Shifeng was still a step slower.

The light closed in on his body. With nowhere to hide, Si Shifeng quickly spread his hands and activated his dao technique to receive it!

However, all his techniques were instantly defeated the moment he touched the light. Soon, his palm was smashed!

“What a terrifying internal qi!” Si Shifeng’s expression changed drastically!

He had already used all his might in that palm strike just now, but he couldn’t resist the man at all!

“Mr. Si, are you alright?” Saintess Gu asked.

Si Shifeng looked at his bloody palm, shook his head, and said, “I’m fine, no big deal.”

Yan Yunfan’s brows furrowed slightly. He looked at the two Masters of Path of Heaven and said, “What’s the man’s background?”

The Master of Path of Heaven shook his head and said, ” No idea. It’s very likely a living being born from the sanctum.”

...

“It’s so scary. The sanctum of the Tribulation Stage great cultivator can actually evolve life,” Saintess Gu murmured.

“It’s not for us to fathom out the abilities of a Tribulation Stage great cultivator,” the Master of Path of Heaven said with a smile.

“Where do we go next?” Yan Yunfan looked a little impatient.

“I’m afraid there’s a killing formation ahead,” Master of Path of Heaven said in a deep voice. “This killing formation is self-formed and changes according to the dao technique. It’s not easy to deduce. I’m afraid it will take some time to avoid the killing formation.”

“An irregular killing formation?” Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

The Master of Path of Heaven glanced at Qin Yu with a mocking look on his face without saying a word.

“Old b*stard! You’re quite arrogant,” Qin Yu could not help but curse in his heart.

Si Shifeng smiled and said, “Don’t you also know how to deduce the Path of Heaven?” Deduce yourself, don’t come with us.”

“It’s none of your business. I’m not even talking to you,” Qin Yu snorted coldly and said.

Si Shifeng didn’t get angry. He only smiled and said, “If you have high aspirations, don’t follow us. Don’t even think about following our path.”
