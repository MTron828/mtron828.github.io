Chapter 519: The Panicked Xia Hang Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xia Hang’s expression was extremely unsightly. Although he didn’t know what exactly happened, he knew that the current him probably couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association has so many resources, but in the end, you’re still such a loser.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Xia Hang looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, you ruined my opportunity. What else do you want?”

“What else do I want?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and then sneered. “Of course, I want to kill you.”

Xia Hang’s expression became vicious.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Kill me? I’m...”

“Don’t bother to tell me your identity. I’m not interested. Moreover, even if you were the king, I wouldn’t care.” Qin Yu interrupted Xia Hang’s words.

Xia Hang became even angrier. He raised his head and roared, “Qin Yu, you’re going too far. Do you really think that I, Xia Hang, am a pushover?!”

Following Xia Hang’s angry roar, streams of mist-like internal qi burst out from the Dragon Vein!

In an instant, it was as if the entire power of nature in the Dragon Vein had been absorbed by Xia Hang!

A true dragon had actually condensed in midair!

This Divine Dragon that was forged from the power of the Dragon Vein seemed to have its own life. Its dark pupils swept across the surroundings coldly.

The internal qi on it made people feel a chill down their spine! Some people even knelt down on the spot!

Even Qin Yu felt a trace of abnormality from the body of this Divine Dragon.

He felt as if he was facing an irresistible divine power!

Xia Hang panted heavily. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, don’t be so ruthless. Are you really going to force me into a dead end?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Qin Yu glanced at Xia Hang and said coldly, “Don’t say such useless nonsense. When you crippled my dantian, did you ever think of being merciful?”

“Okay!”

Xia Hang didn’t say anything more. He bit his finger and flicked his finger. A trace of blood essence instantly fell into the Divine Dragon’s body!

In an instant, this Divine Dragon, which was made of the power of the Dragon Vein, seemed to be dyed with color.

“Go to h*ll!”

Xia Hang roared, and the entire Divine Dragon instantly swooped down toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu stared at this Divine Dragon and sneered. “It’s just a spirit body that has no life. Do you really think I’m afraid of you?!”

After saying that, Qin Yu clenched his fists and faced it head-on!

“Boom!”

A huge collision occurred. At the moment of the collision, Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change!

The power of this Divine Dragon was beyond Qin Yu’s imagination. It instantly knocked Qin Yu to the ground!

“As expected of the power of the Dragon Vein. It’s indeed extraordinary.” Qin Yu frowned.

He clenched the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist and rushed forward for the second time!

However, the result was still the same this time. The moment they collided, the golden light on Qin Yu’s body was directly shattered!

Not far away, Xia Hang watched this scene coldly with a hint of solemnity on his face.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu touched his chin and sneered. “Divine Dragon, right... Well, then I’ll be a dragon slayer today!”

Qin Yu put his hands together and muttered, as if he was casting some kind of spell!

In just a short moment, Qin Yu’s body began to expand! In an instant, his body expanded to over three meters tall!

Not only that, but his body was also covered in a layer of golden light, making him look incomparably resplendent!

This spell was precisely the cosmic form that he had used when he fought He Teng back then!

And after Qin Yu stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, his body became even larger, and his light became even more resplendent!

Everyone looked at this golden giant with a flash of shock in their eyes!

“Cosmic form?” Xia Hang was even more shocked!

“How come this kid knows the cosmic form?” Xia Hang couldn’t help but take two steps back.

Countless thoughts flashed through his mind, and the fear in his eyes became even more obvious!

“We were all wrong!” Xia Hang seemed to have thought of something.

He whispered, “All along, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association thought that Qin Yu was an ordinary person, but we didn’t expect that he... He probably has something to do with that person!”

Thinking of this, Xia Hang became even more panicked!

“I have to tell this to the Martial Arts Association as soon as possible!” Xia Hang said coldly.

In the sky, that Divine Dragon swooped down toward Qin Yu again!

This time, Qin Yu didn’t dodge at all.

He waved his hands and grabbed the neck of the Divine Dragon directly!

The huge force instantly made the “Divine Dragon” struggle violently!

However, Qin Yu’s hands were like two iron pincers, making it unable to move!

“I thought it was really a Divine Dragon, but it turns out it was just a power condensed from the surface of the Dragon Vein.” Qin Yu sneered.

Then, Qin Yu grabbed the Divine Dragon and slammed it to the ground!

The moment it touched the ground, the Divine Dragon instantly disappeared!

Clouds of mist-like internal qi returned to the Dragon Vein!

Qin Yu turned around and looked coldly at Xia Hang.

“What other moves do you have? Just use them,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“I also want to see the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s tricks.”

Xia Hang was Han Wei’s mentor, so they must be connected.

Through Xia Hang, Qin Yu could learn Han Wei’s tricks.

But at this time, Xia Hang seemed to have lost the will to fight. He took out a Martial Marquis Weapon and threw it into the air!

“Martial Marquis Weapon? Do you think it will be useful against me?” Qin Yu sneered.

When he was still in the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm, Qin Yu had already broken four Martial Marquis Weapons, let alone now!

Xia Hang didn’t say anything. He muttered in a low voice, and it was unknown what kind of strange spell he was activating.

Qin Yu wasn’t anxious. He just wanted to see what kind of trick Xia Hang had so that he could know how to deal with Han Wei.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, Xia Hang’s body suddenly flashed with light!

He was holding a Magic Artifact that looked like a command flag in his hand!

“Spatial Magic Artifact?” Qin Yu’s expression changed!

As expected, the moment the Magic Artifact appeared, Xia Hang’s body began to disappear!

In less than half a second, Xia Hang disappeared without a trace!

“Hahahaha!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

He glanced at the members of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and sneered. “This is your leader? He abandoned you guys and ran away.”

Everyone looked at each other, as if they couldn’t believe what was happening in front of them.

At this time, Xia Hang was rushing to Jingdu.

“This kid must not be left alive. After I inform the higher-ups, I will definitely use all my strength to kill him!” Xia Hang said coldly.
