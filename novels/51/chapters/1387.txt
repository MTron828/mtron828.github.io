Chapter 1388: Chapter 1,388, comprehend it yourself

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “Are you sure this is okay?”

“Master, Trust Me.”Di Zun patted his chest.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only nod.

Di Zun’s suggestion was indeed better. If he brought Zhen Yue and the others with him, Qin Yu would indeed have difficulty moving.

“Master, what do you plan to do next?”Di Zun asked.

Qin Yu said, “I’ll find the vital energy first and recover my spiritual essence first.”

Di Zun hummed in gratitude and said, “Master, I’ll help you negotiate. If there’s any news, I’ll let you know immediately.”

“Okay. If you really find the vital energy, send it to the GU city auction and look for sister Lin,”Qin Yu said.

“I can’t stay any longer. I have to leave quickly.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

But at this moment, a disciple appeared outside the door.

This disciple sized up Qin Yu and said with a dark face, “Aren’t you the delivery man from an Fenglou? Why are you here?”

Qin Yu immediately pretended to be stupid and said, “I... My stomach hurts and I was looking for the toilet. I accidentally ran here. I thought this was a toilet...”

“Open your dog eyes wide and see clearly. This is the place where the great elder cultivates. How could it be a toilet! ?”The disciple immediately flew into a rage.

Di Zun, who was at the side, waved his hand and said, “That’s enough. We have to be more polite to others. It’s common for people to go to the wrong place. There’s no need to be angry.”

“Yes, young master Di.”The disciple hurriedly bowed and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and quickly left the place.

Ding Yi was waiting for Qin Yu in the square of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

When he saw Qin Yu coming out, Ding Yi quickly walked up.

“Are you going to the toilet?”Ding Yi asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu glanced at Ding Yi and said, “If I’m not going to the toilet, where else can I go?”

Ding Yi snorted and said, “I seem to have guessed who you are.”

“Oh?”Qin Yu raised her eyebrows.

Ding Yi looked around and said in a low voice, “Are you Qin Yu?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! Her heart thumped.

“Don’t talk nonsense,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“TSK, seeing that you are so nervous, you must be Qin Yu! But don’t worry, I Won’t talk nonsense,”Ding Yi said with a smile.

Qin Yu said with a dark face, “I told you, I’m Not! I’m just an ordinary person.”

Ding Yi opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Qin Yu quickly walked down the mountain.

“TSK, we’ll find the evidence sooner or later,”Ding Yi snorted. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

...

After finishing this matter, Qin Yu also planned to leave Anfeng Tower.

He wanted to go back to Gu City to find sister Lin.

Therefore, Qin Yu went to find boss Zheng that day and planned to resign with him.

Boss Zheng seemed to have guessed it. He smiled and said, “Why? Are you going back?”

Qin Yu was stunned and said, “How did you know?”

Boss Zheng stood up and walked to Qin Yu with a smile.

He raised his hand and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder, saying, “You are going to Gu City to find sister Lin, right?”

“Yes.”Qin Yu didn’t hide it.

Boss Zheng said with a smile, “I’ve already prepared everything. It just so happens that I have nothing to do during this period of time. I’ll leave an Fenglou to him.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

Boss Zheng laughed loudly and said, “I just happen to be planning to go to Gu City. Let’s go together. I’ve already prepared the flying exotic beast. We can set off at any time!”

Speaking up to this point, boss Zheng paused for a moment. He leaned over Qin Yu’s ear and whispered, “I spent a lot of money to get this flying exotic beast! It’s very fast!”

Qin Yu said a little awkwardly, “This... This isn’t good, right?”

“What’s not good about this! I’m also planning to go out to relax,”said boss Zheng with a straight face.

Seeing that she couldn’t refuse, Qin Yu had no choice but to agree.

In this way, Qin Yu saved herself some trouble.

At the same time, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. Dog-licking was really F * cking awesome.

That day, Qin Yu and boss Zheng were riding on flying exotic beasts, planning to head to Gu City.

At this time, Ding Yi ran out hurriedly from inside.

“Where are you going?”Ding Yi asked in a daze.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “Home.”

“Home... Home? Are you coming back?”Ding Yi’s expression was a little ugly.

Qin Yu shook her head and said, “I won’t be back for a while.”

Ding Yi’s face instantly turned a little pale. She bit her lips and whispered, “Where is your home? I’ll look for you later.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then she looked at boss Zheng and said, “Let’s go.”

The Flying Exotic Beast flew across the sky and sped toward Gu City.

Qin Yu didn’t answer Ding Yi’s question in the end, because he knew clearly that the two of them had only met by chance.

“Yan Qin, Ding Yi seems to have taken a fancy to you,”said boss Zheng.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Of course, he knew.

“It’s really strange. Ding Yi is quite good-looking. Why would he take a fancy to you?”Boss Zheng couldn’t help but sigh.

Qin Yu rolled her eyes at him and said indifferently, “Sometimes, what attracts a person is not his face.”

“Then what is it?”Asked boss Zheng, puzzled.

“Figure it out yourself.”

“...”
