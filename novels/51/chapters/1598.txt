Xiao Hai’s expression was still as cold as ever. He reached out with his palm, and his coarse and huge palm slammed out with a bang!

The ice spikes that the three godly monarchs had unleashed were actually shattered by a single palm strike!

This caused everyone to turn pale with fright! The Godly monarchs who were known to be the strongest under the northern Lord had unleashed spells that were easily shattered by Xiao Hai. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Such strength was enough to shake the past and present!

Everyone’s hearts were hanging in the air. They all broke out in cold sweat for Xiao Hai.

“Xiao Hai, are you really going to force us!”A deity King raised his head and roared angrily.

It was as if they were forced into a desperate situation. In their own territory, they were forced to retreat repeatedly by a cultivator from the southern region!

“In that case, even if we use up our essence qi, we must kill you today!”A deity King roared explosively!

Following that, wisps of essence qi emitted from his glabella.

These essence qi fused with the world of the northern lands, as if they were casting some terrifying spell!

The three godly monarchs did the same. They all offered up their essence qi!

“Rumble...”

In an instant, the Earth began to shake!

In a short moment, figures erupted from the ground.

These people were dressed in black armor, and each of their bodies emitted an extremely terrifying internal Qi.

And they did not have the slightest change in expression. Other than the terrifying battle intent that emanated from their bodies, there was nothing else!

“Oh no, it’s the Northland Gods!”Someone cried out in alarm.

“Northland Gods? What’s That?”

“Rumor has it that the Northland gods are powerful creatures that are buried underground. Every single one of them contains extremely powerful strength. These gods probably already possess the power of the reversion void stage!”

“Reversion void stage? ! How is that possible! You must know that any one of the reversion void stage can easily wipe out a mighty figure!”

“That’s right, but the gods and demons of the north do not have full combat strength, but they are still extremely terrifying.”

Upon hearing everyone’s words, Qin Yu could not help but have a horrified expression!

He could naturally sense the terrifying strength of the gods and demons of the north, but when he heard the words “Reversion void stage”, he could not help but be greatly alarmed!

“Bullsh * t gods and devils of the northern lands. This is clearly the corpse of the immortal slaying sect’s ancestor!”At this moment, Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s voice suddenly came from the spatial magic artifact!

When Qin Yu heard this, he hurriedly asked, “The corpse of the immortal slaying sect’s ancestor? What does that mean?”

Heavenly blood rainbow said coldly, “After the immortal slaying sect’s ancestor died in battle, his corpse was left under the sect’s ground. His body would not be damaged for a thousand years, and would not be destroyed for ten thousand years. As long as he borrowed the immortal slaying sect’s secret technique, he would be able to summon him up and fight for himself! “This is to prevent the sect from suffering a powerful external enemy. This is to ensure that the sect will not be destroyed for ten thousand years!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. In other words, what Xiao Hai had to face next was no longer the godly monarch of the northern lands, but the corpse of the immortal slaying sect’s elders!

On the northern border, everyone’s expression was solemn. Their Hearts were hanging in the air.

Everyone knew that this was a great battle that would never return, but everyone hoped that Xiao Hai could return safely!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold. He clearly remembered that back then, the Heavenly Blood Rainbow had once mobilized the white bone army.

It was this white bone army that gave Qin Yu and the others a headache.

Now, the northern lands had used the same, or even more brilliant methods!

How terrifying was a corpse at the reversion void stage! Any one of them possessed strength that was difficult to resist!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. After pondering for a moment, he immediately walked towards the Dead River.

Since Xiao Hai could cross the Dead River, then Qin Yu believed that he could too!

He quickly walked to the side of the Dead River and raised his foot to step into it.

“Chi la!”

A heart-piercing pain!

Qin Yu’s expression instantly became extremely ugly. This pain was not something that a human could withstand!

“Come up!”

At this moment, iron egg suddenly reached out and pulled Qin Yu back.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Are you tired of living?”

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at his calf. Sure enough, his skin had already festered.

If he had stayed for another half a second, his calf would have been directly corroded!

“Senior Xiao Hai endured this kind of intense pain and crossed the river of death...”Qin Yu could hardly believe it!

One had to know that he was a chaotic body!

But even so, he was unable to withstand this river of death. It was imaginable how much pain Xiao Hai had endured!

On the other side of the river of death.

The great battle had already begun in an instant.

One after another, corpses of the reversion void stage crawled out from the ground. They brandished their fierce bodies, as if they wanted to shatter this world!

The three godly monarchs panted slightly. They retreated to the side and said in a low voice, “I didn’t expect this Xiao Hai to be so terrifying... he actually made us reveal our trump card in advance.”

Their condition was very poor. If it weren’t for the fact that Xiao Hai was unable to display his full strength, they would have already turned into corpses.

At this moment, Xiao Hai still did not show any fear. He laughed arrogantly and said, “So what if you are corpses of the reversion void stage. Today, I will kill all of you!”

He raised his rough palm, and thousands of rays of light condensed on his palm. His invincible battle intent and Dao technique fused at this moment. At this moment, Xiao Hai was the god of War!

“Boom!”

With a palm strike, the sky collapsed and the earth cracked, almost shattering this piece of heaven and earth!

The corpse of the reversion void stage was also directly smashed into pieces, turning into a pile of dry bones!

This made everyone gasp! ! How terrifying was Xiao Hai that he could smash the body of a warrior at the reversion void stage with one palm? !

“Just one palm?”Someone around exclaimed.

“Xiao Hai... is too terrifying! If he claims to be number one, no one will dare to claim to be Number Two!”

“This is Xiao Hai’s strength. He is not afraid even when facing a warrior at the reversion void Stage!”

Even iron egg revealed a trace of surprise on his face.

“This Xiao Hai... is a little interesting,”iron egg said in a low voice.

Qin Yu was not as optimistic as them. He knew very well that this seemed to be just a palm strike, but in fact, it was the condensation of all of Xiao Hai’s battle intent. He did not know how many dao techniques had been fused together.

If the palm strike failed, it meant that Xiao Hai would definitely die in battle here!

One after another, warriors at the reversion void stage emerged from the ground. They had extremely powerful physical bodies and an enormous number of them!

No one knew just how many physical bodies were buried under the ground!

Every palm strike from Xiao Hai signified the weakening of his internal Qi.

If this continued, Xiao Hai would definitely die!

“Senior Xiao Hai...”Qin Yu clenched his fists, his expression incomparably ugly.

Seeing Xiao Hai fighting with blood, everyone was moved.

They silently prayed for Xiao Hai, only hoping that Xiao Hai could return safely.

“Hahaha! Today, even if I, Xiao Hai, die in battle, I will drag all of you down with me!”Xiao Hai’s impudent smile shook the entire world!

The earth was shaking, and countless icebergs in the north were shattering!

Xiao Hai raised his head and let out a furious roar. All of his Qi energy was sucked out in an instant, and then he slammed his palm into the air!
