Chapter 2570 Junior Brother, You’re Injured Too

“Clang!”

At this moment, on Zi Yang’s chest, the Green Duckweed Sword stopped at the skin and slowly pierced through.

A massive wound appeared on his chest. He stared at Qin Yu indifferently.

“Good sword technique.”

It was unsure if he was praising Xuan Xin or Qin Yu.

However, that was all. The attack that gathered the power of the Human Race Watch’s higher-ups and Xuan Xin’s full-powered sword only caused a wound on his chest.

A drop of blood seeped out from his chest and slowly dripped onto the ground. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

On the ground, a gigantic red lotus began to bloom at some point in time. The bud faced toward the sky, perfectly condensing a drop of essence.

Blazing Sun Red Lotus.

Zi Yang said indifferently.

As the blood essence seeped into the red lotus, the red lotus of tens of thousands of feet exploded with destructive light resembling the scorching sun.

“Retreat!”

At this moment, even the face of Xiang Yu, the general-in-chief of the monster race, distorted in fear as he shouted.

His entire body frantically flew backward. The palm-sized red lotus had already caused a destructive explosion.

When this Blazing Sun Red Lotus exploded, it was unknown how massive the explosion would be.

Qin Yu no longer had any strength after delivering that sword attack again.

He suddenly hugged the seriously injured Yan Ruoxue and said softly.

“I’m sorry, Ruoxue.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and apologized. He had messed up again.

If he had not participated in this conflict, perhaps today’s disaster would not have happened.

“Qin Yu, this is a calamity that can’t be avoided.”

Qin Yu hugged Yan Ruoxue’s slender body tightly and shielded her from the red lotus. Though futile, it was the last thing he could do.

Vaguely, he only saw endless explosions and tremors, and then he completely lost all consciousness.

Zi Yang’s clone returned to the sky and then his true body.

“Senior Brother, you can be on your way.”

At this moment, his internal qi was much more formidable than when he came.

Moreover, he seemed to have a sense of sharpness that eliminated the inner demons. That kind of sharpness was even more terrifying.

“What a terrifying internal qi! The Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect seemed to have completely exterminated.”

Su Xinghe sighed and felt a little regretful.

The human race’s Saints chose to step back when faced with Zi Yang, who was ready to fight to the death. No one wanted to confront a Saint who was willing to fight relentlessly.

Perhaps he could have changed the outcome if he had persisted a little longer.

“I’m afraid that no one in the human race can confront this internal qi.”

Revered Qi was silent for a long time before he finally spoke.

Zi Yang was one of the earliest Saints of the human race. After feeling lost for nearly a Path of Heaven year in the Misty Forest, he finally opted to become a monster.

Furthermore, after experiencing the baptism of the holy energy of the monster race and severing the inner demons of the human world, his sharpness had already suppressed any Saints of the human race.

In the Kingdom of Saint where he was, countless chains of order extended from the divine kingdom.

In the realm of Saint, holy energy was crazily absorbed into his kingdom through the chains of order and then into his soul.

“Junior Brother.”

Chen Shuang spoke for the first time, revealing a smile.

He then began to laugh loudly, and tears kept flowing down his face.

Zi Yang just stared at Chen Shuang indifferently, wanting to see what this former senior brother had to say.

“Junior Brother, look at you. Even if you are strong enough to walk the path of the divine, even if you are determined to sever many inner demons that you think are binding you, even if you have reached this peak, you still get injured. In a world where the Saints are unrivaled, you still get injured. Hahaha.”

Chen Shuang pointed at Zi Yang and laughed maniacally.

He laughed to the extent of tears covering his face and suddenly cried like a madman.

Chen Shuang suddenly stopped his frantic laughing.

“Originally, I should have returned to my Kingdom of Saint by now, but I’ve changed my mind.”

An enormous energy beam suddenly pierced his body, and the energy entered his body.

His heavily injured body began to recover to its peak state.

Moreover, his internal qi soared beyond the peak, surging up at an even more terrifying peak.

Chen Shuang’s Kingdom of Saint began to shake violently in the Saint’s world. The terrifying energy caused the holy energy flowing in the entire Saint Kingdom to fluctuate.

“What does Chen Shuang want to do? Does he want to start a war?”

“Such a weak Saint! Does he want to start a war with our monster race?”

Other than Zi Yang, the other sixteen Saints opened their eyes almost simultaneously.

Their internal qi was fixed on Chen Shuang’s Saint Kingdom, wanting to see what he was up to.

“Could it be that Chen Shuang wants to start a war with Zi Yang in the Kingdom of Saint? He can’t possibly win!”

All the Saints of the human race suddenly became nervous.

In the mortal world, no matter how intense the battle between the Saints was, as long as the soul imprint of the Kingdom of Saints remained, it would return to the divine kingdom and not die even if the body perished.

If a war broke out in the Saint’s world, it would be a battle to the death.

The locations of the eighteen Kingdom of Saint had been fixed. All the Saints had to go through a tremendously difficult path before they occupied the Kingdom of Saint and left behind a soul imprint to become a Saint.

There were only two ways to start a war.

One was to use the power of the Kingdom of Saint to attack each other. It was a fighting method that would injure both parties.

The other way was to invade. However, invading the Kingdom of Saint was an act of courting death.

Even the weakest Saint Kingdom would not be invaded. In the Kingdom of Saint, one was practically unrivaled, and even a Seventh-Level Divine would have to pay a tremendous price.

A clash between the Saint Kingdoms was a competition of the strength the Kingdom of Saint had accumulated over the years. Even the winner would have to pay a heavy price.

The accumulation of power in the Kingdom of Saints was tremendously slow. This life-and-death struggle between two kingdoms would almost exhaust the strength accumulated over a long time.

In the four stages after the Primordial Chaos, the Primordial Chaos stage, the division of the Path of Heaven, the Supreme of the Divine Land, and the current Era of Annihilation, wars between the Kingdom of Saint were extremely rare. They could be counted on one hand.

“Gather all the Saints of the human race immediately. Chen Shuang might start a Saint Kingdom war with Zi Yang!”

At this moment, even Revered Qi, who had the most robust cultivation, his body trembled imperceptibly.

A war between Saint Kingdoms meant a high chance that the Saints would fall.
