Chapter 2770: The Seven Tribulation Sin

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The air was filled with a thick smell of blood that was no less than the smell in the Tomb of Heavenly Sins.

At this moment, Qin Yu had landed at the edge of the spaceship. He glanced at the bottom of the cliff.

He could not see how deep this place was. An unknown muffled roar came from the depths.

The reverberation in the bottomless abyss was especially terrifying.

When Qin Yu was observing, a group of topless laborers was carrying a huge sack. They walked to the edge with numb expressions.

Then, they opened the sack and revealed the corpses inside.

They dragged the corpses out of the sacks one by one and threw them into the bottomless abyss.

In an instant, mournful howls came from the abyss and they quickly joined.

The originally dead abyss was suddenly filled with a screech that made one feel sorry.

The flesh and blood have awakened the sleeping demonic beasts in the abyss. Those people were not surprised. They left after throwing the corpses away as if they had just thrown away a bag of trash.

“Kid, entering the Nine Nether Cliff comes with pay. There are Dharma Treasures everywhere.”

Someone beside Qin Yu suddenly said in a sinister voice.

Qin Yu turned around and saw an extremely ugly man staring at him with burning eyes as if he were staring at a treasure.

They were probably targeted the moment they got off the spaceship.

Moreover, this person should be probing. It was obvious that a few more powerful internal qi were behind him.

Before he finished speaking, his body had been split into two by Qin Yu’s Tiger Wing.

“How is it?”

Someone looked in Qin Yu’s direction and yawned at the back.

“The Qi Detection Jade didn’t detect the peak power. There shouldn’t be any problem with the jade. He’s probably at Dao Consciousness level 9. I wonder who tricked him to come here. Should we make a move?”

An almost naked woman laughed coquettishly. Only a few important parts of her body were covered with cloth.

The few people behind her occasionally glance at her from the corner of their eyes.

“There’s no rush. Although this is the Land of Disorder, we should still respect the rules.”

“Are you talking about the people of the Path of Heaven Academy? Although they are also considered a top-notch faction here, they still don’t have any position to speak in the Nine Nether Cliff! If we are willing, we can even eliminate them.”

The woman laughed out loud. Her voluptuous breasts trembled violently with her laugh.

“Don’t be too confident, Qin Ji. In this Nine Nether Cliff. I’ve witnessed the fall of countless people stronger than me. This has taught me to be modest and prudent. This is also the reason why we can live for so long. According to my information, Lord Sui of the Path of Heaven Academy might personally come this time. It seems that his goal is someone in this spaceship. Therefore, we should not make a move to the people on this ship for the time being.”

A man crouched on the treetops and took a long drag from the pipe in his hand.

Although he did not look old, he gave off a murderous aura that could not be ignored.

“Smoker Xie, aren’t you interested in the arrival of that person from the Path of Heaven Academy? For him to personally make a move, he probably had a big motive. If we capture everyone on this ship, we should be able to get some information out of them.”

Qin Ji grinned and jumped onto the branch. Her voluptuous chest leaned against Smoker Xie.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I’m not interested. If you’re interested, you can do it yourself. Don’t bring my men to their deaths. My goal is to earn enough money for my retirement and leave this da*n place as soon as possible.”

Smoker Xie answered cheerfully.

“As if I would believe you!”

“There’s another reason. There has been some unrest here recently and some strange people have appeared. One of them is from the Guardian of Order, Yi Yun. He is one of my few good friends, but his body has undergone some changes. He looks like being controlled.”

Smoker Xie revealed a strange smile.

“He still knows me. His memories have not changed, and his body is not under control. However, he has a deep taboo towards certain things. Furthermore, he is in awe of them. The Yi Yun I know does not seem to have such a reaction. An impressive figure has likely arrived.”

“It’s exciting here recently. It’s just that we’re bored.”

Qin Ji jumped down. A piece of cloth covering a part of her body accidentally fell to the ground.

Immediately, the eyes of the two subordinates at the side were fixed on her.

“Do I look good?”

Qin Ji didn’t care at all. Instead, she straightened her waist.

“Anyway, I’m planning to hide and be a coward recently. I can’t afford to offend those people.”

Smoker Xie shrugged.

“Do you think this is a sign of chaos in this Saint Kingdom? Do you think we will ydie?

“It’s hard to say. We shall try not to die.”

“Forget it. It’s too cowardly to live like this. I’m going to have some fun. There was a pretty boy who came. I’ll go give him a test first.”

Qin Ji ended this boring conversation and left.

Qin Yu was slowly walking in the Nine Nether Cliff. The size of this place had exceeded his imagination.

It was not a flat ground. Instead, it was of different heights and levels.

Qin Yu walked in different spaces. He discovered that almost all the people here were emitting a murderous intent.

Moreover, almost everyone was extremely cautious.

Although he saw many people along the way, they merely glanced at him. None of them made a move directly.

This was out of Qin Yu’s expectations. Perhaps people on the verge of death would cherish their lives more.

Qin Yu was also a little clueless now, not knowing which direction to go.

He wouldn’t even dare to trust a dog in a place like this.

“That’s right! Taoist Master Cang Yunzi gave me a map before. I can check if there is any information about this place! ”

Qin Yu suddenly remembered something important. He took out the map from his space ring.

After a careful search, there was indeed a place called the Nine Nether Cliff.

After browsing through it, Qin Yu put down the map in his hand.

According to the map that Cang Yunzi had given him, the higher the place, the more experts there were.

Many top-notch people would set up life-and-death rings in various highlands of the Nine Nether Cliff.

The loser would naturally lose everything, including one’s life.

Therefore, the higher the place, the stronger the person in the arena.

On the contrary, those without a certain level of strength would not dare to occupy the highest place.

The low-lying land he was in now had fewer battles. They were all low-level battles.

To sum up, the true experts were at the cliff peak.

“With Chang Mang’s personality, it’s very likely that he’ll set the arena at a

higher level..”
