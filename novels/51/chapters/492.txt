Chapter 493: Saint Confucian Sect, Here I Come! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The long-clawed man immediately panicked. He tried to struggle, but found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“Half-step Martial Marquises are good resources.” Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

Then, Qin Yu summoned the Heaven Swallowing Technique and slapped the long-clawed man’s head!

“Buzz!”

The Heaven Swallowing Technique instantly appeared. In a moment, the long-haired man was sucked into a dried corpse!

“How comfortable.” Qin Yu licked his lips in satisfaction!

His technique instantly shocked everyone!

Their expressions were extremely unsightly, and their hearts were filled with terror!

“Clang!”

At this moment, another person clenched his fist!

A sound like the collision of steel was immediately heard. The spell caster only felt waves of numbness in his fist. He felt as if he was about to lose consciousness!

Qin Yu’s body wasn’t damaged at all. There was only a white dot left!

“You’re too brazen!” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold and he swung his golden palm.

“Snap!”

His neck was broken instantly and his internal qi was drained quickly!

Qin Yu didn’t let go of this opportunity. He used the Heaven Swallowing Technique again and swallowed him!

“It’s your turn.” Qin Yu glanced at the remaining few people.

These few people were extremely scared. They even had the intention of retreating.

However, Qin Yu didn’t give them a chance at all. He used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique to chase them!

Hong Yi Sect had no choice but to continue fighting. Their spells and magic artifactss were thrown out non-stop at this moment.

Qin Yu’s golden light suddenly appeared and lit up the entire street!

He was so powerful that he was awe-inspiring!

“Boom!”

Another punch was thrown out, and the head of a half-step Martial Marquis was directly shattered!

Qin Yu’s Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist was incomparably fierce, and all of their spells weren’t even worth mentioning in front of this fist!

No one had expected that this great battle would turn into a one-sided massacre!

No wonder so many people were afraid that Qin Yu would step into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!

For a full three hours, the bodies of these ten half-step Martial Marquises were almost completely shattered, and they fell to the ground in unbearable pain!

Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t miss this opportunity. He walked in front of them and swallowed them all.

In the blink of an eye, only the hawk-nosed man was left among the elites sent by the Hong Yi Sect.

He lay on the ground with his eyes closed while waiting for the judgment of fate.

“You are their leader, right?” Qin Yu said coldly.

The hawk-nosed man opened his eyes and said coldly, “So what if I am, so what if I am not?!”

Qin Yu stared at him for a moment before he suddenly retracted the golden light on his body.

“Go away. I will spare your life,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The aquiline-nosed man was stunned. He frowned and said, “Are... are you telling the truth?”

“Since you’re honorable, get lost,” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

The aquiline-nosed man hurriedly got up from the ground and ran away.

“Go back and tell your sect master not to provoke me again.” Qin Yu said coldly.

The hooked-nosed man froze for a moment, then turned his head and left.

One person beheaded ten half-step Martial Marquises. His power shocked the world!

It wasn’t a lie to say that the chaotic body was invincible among those of the same level!

“Next, it’s time to go to the Saint Confucian Sect.” Qin Yu said coldly.

The Saint Confucian Sect had Martial Marquises guarding it and no one dared to cross it. However, Qin Yu, who was full of fighting spirit, wasn’t afraid at all.

Moreover, they had captured the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Qin Yu had to rescue her.

After that, Qin Yu arrived at the airport and rushed towards the Saint Confucian Sect.

The Saint Confucian Sect was located in the Hongzhou’s Cangzao City and wasn’t far from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. He could arrive in just two hours by plane.

At present, the Saint Confucian Sect had long forgotten about Qin Yu.

Elder Qu was carefree every day and lived quite comfortably.

As for He Teng, he chose to stay in the Saint Confucian Sect and baptize himself with the spirit spring every day to step into the realm of a Martial Marquis.

...

Qin Yu arrived at the vicinity of the Saint Confucian Sect.

The roads near the Saint Confucian Sect were quite complex. It wasn’t easy to find them in a short period of time.

Right at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly caught a glimpse of a car from the corner of his eye.

The person sitting in this car was none other than Li Zinan!

“Li Zinan?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but snort coldly when he saw this figure.

He arrived in front of the car in the blink of an eye!

At such a close distance, it was too late for it to brake! He could only crash straight into it!

“Clang!”

Qin Yu raised his palm and grabbed the front of the car!

The front of the car instantly exploded! The pungent smell of gasoline was extremely pungent!

“Qin... Qin Yu!”

When he saw the person who stopped the car, Li Zinan’s expression immediately changed!

He jumped out of the car and turned around to run, but Qin Yu didn’t give him a chance and reached out to grab his head!

“You’re still staying in the Saint Confucian Sect?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

Li Zinan was a little scared. He said in horror, “Qin Yu, you... you have already crippled me. What else do you want?”

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Don’t be afraid. I just want you to lead the way.”

“Lead the way?” Li Zinan was stunned.

“Go... Go where?” Li Zinan asked tentatively.

“The Saint Confucian Sect,” Qin Yu said coldly.

A trace of craftiness flashed in Li Zinan’s eyes.

Go to the Saint Confucian Sect? Wasn’t the Saint Confucian Sect trying to capture Qin Yu?

He didn’t expect that he would actually deliver himself to their doorstep!

He could turn in Qin Yu and take credit!

“No problem!” Li Zinan patted his own chest.

“Lead the way.” Qin Yu let go of Li Zinan.

Li Zinan didn’t hesitate and immediately led Qin Yu toward the Saint Confucian Sect.

After going around in circles for nearly half an hour, the two of them finally arrived at the Saint Confucian Sect.

Although the Saint Confucian Sect was filled with modern buildings, there was a huge stone tablet at the entrance.

There were a few words written on the stone tablet: the Saint Confucian Sect is recruiting all the Saint Confucians in the world!

“Saint Confucian Sect... how ironic.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

Li Zinan glanced at Qin Yu from the corner of his eyes. When he saw that he wasn’t paying attention to him, he ran away! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Qin Yu has been captured by me! Qin Yu has been captured by me!” Li Zinan shouted as he ran!

Qin Yu sneered. He raised his hand and slapped out!

“Boom!”

The huge palm that rose up in the air instantly smashed Li Zinan into meat paste!

“From today onwards, I, Qin Yu, have become enemies with the Saint Confucian Sect!” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, he held the golden light in his hand and smashed it toward the stone tablet!

The stone tablet instantly shattered into pieces!

The loud sound shook the entire Saint Confucian Sect!

Staring at the Saint Confucian Sect, Qin Yu snorted coldly.

He slowly raised his hand and a terrifying power gathered in his palm.

A moment later, a huge golden palm suddenly appeared!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu waved his huge palm and the huge palm slammed towards the Saint Confucian Sect!

In an instant, the Saint Confucian Sect shook like an earthquake!

Countless buildings collapsed in an instant, and the originally quiet Saint Confucian Sect was instantly thrown into chaos!

“What’s going on?!” Several Elders of the Saint Confucian Sect hurriedly shouted!

“It’s Qin Yu!” At this moment, someone shouted!

Qin Yu said, “Saint Confucian Sect, weren’t you looking for me? I, Qin Yu, am here!”

The loud voice contained spiritual energy and carried a surging might as it spread throughout the entire Saint Confucian Sect.
