1917 Seeing Shi Shiyue Again

Yan Ruoxue’s expression was a little ugly, and Qin Yu also understood Uncle Yan’s intention.

“Let’s go,” Yan Ruoxue said to Qin Yu.

Uncle Yan brought along many people with him this time. Thus Yan Ruoxue did not dare to get too close to Qin Yu.

Therefore, Qin Yu followed behind Yan Ruoxue and came to Uncle Yan.

!!

When the crowd below saw Yan Ruoxue clearly, they were shocked.

“She’s the Yan family’s saintess!”

“No wonder she has such an extraordinary temperament. That’s why I said she didn’t look like someone from our neighborhood.”

“The Yan family’s saintess actually came to our place…”

Yan Ruoxue looked at Uncle Yan and said in a low voice, “Why do you need to make such a big hoo-ha?”

“Miss Yan, no one can bear the responsibility if anything happens to you,” Uncle Yan sighed and said.

“What can happen to me? I’m feeling very comfortable here,” Yan Ruoxue said with some displeasure.

“Miss Yan, once the bloodline in your body awakens completely, you’ll definitely become one of the strongest in this world!” Uncle Yan said in a deep voice. “The Yan family’s glory would get to continue! But do you know how many people don’t want to see this?”

Yan Ruoxue opened her mouth but did not know how to respond.

“Miss Yan, if you come to such a place again, you will only bring disaster to them,” Uncle Yan looked down and said indifferently.

His words carried a strong sense of threat. To the Yan family, they could destroy this kind of marketplace with a lift of the hand.

“I know.” Yan Ruoxue didn’t say much. She became cold again like previously. She was very different from the little girl playing around just now.

Qin Yu followed behind him, not daring to say a word.

They followed Uncle Yan back to the Yan family.

This time, Uncle Yan seemed to have deliberately made a big fuss out of this matter to let many people from the Yan family know that Yan Ruoxue had sneaked out.

Several elders were waiting for them when Yan Ruoxue and the rest returned.

These elders were all experts from the older generation of the Yan family. Their status and seniority in the Yan family were extremely high. Even Yan Ruoxue had to bow to them.

“Ruoxue, you can’t leave the Yan family on your own next time, no matter what.”

“Even if you want to go out, you must let Uncle Yan go with you, understand?”

“I’m sure Holy Lord won’t be happy to know about this.”

Yan Ruoxue acknowledged each of them without a single complaint.

After everyone had left, Uncle Yan retreated to the side.

Yan Ruoxue looked at him and said coldly, “Uncle Yan, you don’t have to send so many people to Mount Donghuang next time.”

“I had no choice. Please forgive me, Miss Yan,” Uncle Yan sighed and said.

Yan Ruoxue didn’t say anything else. She turned around and returned to the edge of the cliff, sitting cross-legged.

Just as Qin Yu was about to follow her, he was shocked to realize he had been silently isolated from the surrounding as if he had entered another world!

“This…” Qin Yu frowned. He tried to escape, only to find out he had been surrounded by an iron wall. It was also like a void, and there was nowhere to run.

“Qin Yu, I don’t want this kind of thing to happen again,” Uncle Yan said coldly.

Obviously, Uncle Yan thought it was because of Qin Yu that Yan Ruoxue had run out of the Yan family.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and wanted to explain, but then he shook his head and said with a smile, “I understand, Uncle Yan.”

Uncle Yan snorted coldly. He waved his hand, and the surroundings returned to normal.

Qin Yu walked to Yan Ruoxue’s side and sat down. Before Qin Yu could speak, Yan Ruoxue said, “I’ve caused you trouble this time.”

“Don’t talk nonsense.” Qin Yu quickly shook his head.

Yan Ruoxue sighed and said, “You’ve seen it for yourself. It’s not that easy for me to get out.”

Qin Yu didn’t know what to say for a moment. Too much hope was on her, so she naturally didn’t have as much freedom as a rogue cultivator.

That night, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue sat on the edge of the cliff. They didn’t dare to act rashly because Uncle Yan must have been watching them in the dark.

The following morning. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Someone rushed to Yan ruoxue’s side and cupped his hands. “Miss Yan, Mr. Si is here.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s face changed.

Mr. Si? Si Shiyue? What was he doing here?

“What’s he doing here?” Yan Ruoxue frowned and asked.

“He’s certainly here to visit you.” At this moment, Uncle Yan walked out from not far away.

Yan Ruoxue’s brows furrowed even more as she subconsciously glanced at Qin Yu.

When she saw Qin Yu’s expression, Yan Ruoxue immediately said, “Just say that I’m not well and won’t see any guests.”

“Miss Yan, this is not good,” Uncle Yan frowned and said.

“There’s nothing bad about it. I’ve said I’m not seeing guests.” Yan Ruoxue sounded incredibly cold.

Qin Yu knew that Yan Ruoxue was doing this out of consideration for his feelings. But he also did not want to bring trouble to Yan Ruoxue.

Therefore, Qin Yu took a step forward and said with a smile, “It’s fine. I also want to see this Shi Shiyue.”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue was stunned. She pulled Qin Yu to the side and whispered, “You’re no match to him now. You must not be reckless.”

“Don’t worry. I know what to do,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

...

“Moreover, this Si Shiyue doesn’t know my identity. I’m now only a servant of the Yan family.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Yan Ruoxue pondered for a moment before she said, “Alright. I’ll listen to you.”

Therefore, Yan Ruoxue walked up to Uncle Yan’s side and said, “Let him in.”

Uncle Yan glanced at Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “Should we let this kid stay away?”

“No need.” Yan Ruoxue shook her head without even thinking.

Uncle Yan didn’t say anything else and immediately turned to leave.

Yan Ruoxue sat cross-legged on the edge of the cliff, while Qin Yu stood beside her.

After a while, two young men followed Uncle Yan in.

The two young men were high-spirited and had extraordinary temperaments.

When Qin Yu saw the two people clearly, he frowned again.

Qin Yu had seen both of them before. One of them was the Si family’s Holy Son, Si Shiyue, and the other was Si Shifeng, whom he had met not long ago at the sanctum.

...

“He came, too,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Eh? You know him?” Yan Ruoxue asked in surprise.

“Not really,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “We’ve only met once.”

As they were talking, the two brothers from the Si family walked over.

Si Shiyue walked up to Yan Ruoxue. He bent and said quietly, “Ruoxue, I heard you ran out yesterday. You didn’t encounter any danger, did you?”

“I’m fine. Thank you for your concern, Mr. Si,” Yan Ruoxue said calmly.

Si Shiyue glanced around and then his eyes fell on Qin Yu.

“What are you doing? Don’t you know how to look after Miss Yan?” Si Shiyue said coldly.
