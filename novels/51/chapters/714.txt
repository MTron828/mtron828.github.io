Chapter 715: Heaven Swallowing Python VS Yan Jinyao Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Jinyao’s eyes were filled with madness as he nodded and said, “That’s right. It’s the bloodline of Yan Ruoxue!”

“I really didn’t expect that such a holy object would awaken in Yan Ruoxue’s body!”

Yan Sihai was confused as he listened. He knew nothing about the power of this bloodline.

“Dad, has there ever been a great cultivator in our family’s history?” Yan Jinyao asked.

Yan Sihai still shook his head and said, “I’m afraid you’ll have to ask your grandfather about this.”

Hearing this, Yan Jinyao immediately said, “Father, find him right away. I have something to ask him.”

“Is it very important?” Yan Sihai seemed to be somewhat unwilling.

During this period of time, he had almost given up on hunting down Old Mister Yan.

Of course, through the power of the Yan family, Yan Jinyao was also secretly suppressing the development of Old Mister Yan’s career.

“It’s very important,” said Yan Jinyao.

“I’ve already comprehended 80% of this bloodline! Just 80% is enough to enlighten me!”

“Do you know what this means? The talent of this generation that worships me has been forcefully enhanced under this bloodline!”

Speaking up to this point, Yan Jinyao clenched his fist. Rays of resplendent light gathered on his palm.

This casual grip seemed to contain destructive energy!

The heat caused Yan Sihai’s expression to change slightly.

“Boom!”

Then, Yan Jinyao gently waved the light in his hand.

This light instantly swept across, and a mountain peak in the distance was instantly split into two halves!

A casual attack could move mountains and overturn seas, and this caused Yan Sihai to turn pale with fright.

“I’ve only comprehended 80%! If I could possess all the bloodline power, the number one person in the world would definitely be me.” The more Yan Jinyao spoke, the crazier he became.

“I even feel that I would become the first person to step into the Martial Saint Realm!”

When he heard this, Yan Sihai’s expression turned grave.

“Alright, I’ll think of a way to bring him back,” Yan Sihai said.

Then, Yan Sihai continued, “Oh right, Qu Xie was killed by Qin Yu, and there’s an important piece of news.”

Yan Sihai told everything he knew to Yan Jinyao.

After Yan Jinyao heard it, he immediately frowned.

“Mystic Realm? What is this? Why have I never heard of it?” Yan Jinyao frowned.

“Not to mention you, even I haven’t heard of it before,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“It’s said that this Mystic Realm contains a real heritage.”

Yan Jinyao said coldly, “Mystic Realm... I got it.”

At this moment, Yan Jinyao didn’t seem to be interested in the Mystic Realm.

Compared to the Mystic Realm, Yan Jinyao hoped to obtain all the bloodlines!

It was because that power was too tyrannical, as if a new world had opened up!

...

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

At nine o’clock in the morning, the entrance of the academy was already filled with people.

To Qin Yu’s surprise, there were at least close to a hundred people here!

The weakest among them was only an Inner Strength Grandmaster!

“Why are there so many people?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

Chang Mang said in a deep voice, “Could it be that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association gained a conscience?”

“Impossible.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Having crossed paths with them so many times, Qin Yu already knew how this association was.

“Sigh, let’s not bother about them. Having more people won’t be a bad thing,” Chang Mang said.

Qin Yu didn’t say much. He and Chang Mang walked into the academy in large strides.

They were the first batch of students, and their strength was at the Martial Marquis Realm. Therefore, there were almost no restrictions on them in this academy.

Of course, no one would come to impart spells.

The only benefit of joining this academy was that they could enter the Mystic Realm together.

After a simple ceremony, they could be considered to have officially joined this academy.

As for their first experience in the Mystic Realm, they would have to be notified separately.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang walked into the Martial Arts Academy. Qin Yu released his spiritual sense to rely on the method from the last time to find the Mystic Realm.

Unfortunately, there were too many people here, and the internal qi was chaotic. Qin Yu couldn’t even catch a trace of the internal qi.

“Looks like I can only try again tonight,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, a black-haired youth blocked Qin Yu’s way.

This person was none other than the Heaven Swallowing Python Blackie.

Blackie looked at Qin Yu coldly, the killing intent in his eyes wasn’t concealed at all.

Even though he had completely restrained his internal qi, he could still feel the powerful internal qi from his body.

“What are you trying to do?” Chang Mang took a step forward and said loudly. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Blackie glanced at Chang Mang and said coldly, “It has nothing to do with you. Get lost.”

Chang Mang was instantly enraged. He was about to speak, but was stopped by Qin Yu.

“Chang Mang, step aside. This is my own business,” Qin Yu said.

However, Chang Mang couldn’t take this in. Without saying anything, he clenched his fist and rushed towards Blackie’s face!

Blackie stood there without moving, allowing Chang Mang’s fist to land on his face.

“Dang!”

After a loud sound, Blackie was unharmed!

A black light burst out from his body.

This black light was extremely familiar. It was the color of the Heaven Swallowing Python!

“Huh?” Chang Mang glanced at his fist somewhat dubiously.

“You don’t know your limits.” Blackie snorted coldly, and then slapped Chang Mang!

The terrifying power directly forced Chang Mang back dozens of steps!

In the next second, Blackie opened its mouth slightly and spat out streams of internal qi!

This internal qi had a pungent smell and a foul stench.

The moment this internal qi appeared, Qin Yu felt that something was wrong!

Because this internal qi was poisonous!

Qin Yu hurriedly pulled Chang Mang up and blocked him behind him.

Following that, Qin Yu raised his palm and a stream of purple flames immediately flew forward!

Internal qi was an extremely bright item, and it could restrain all darkness and evil. Naturally, Blackie’s internal qi was no exception.

After that internal qi was successfully extinguished, a strange smile appeared in Blackie’s eyes.

“You have some ability,” Blackie said coldly.

As he spoke, he took off his black robe, revealing his extremely smooth skin.

“It really is the Heaven Swallowing Python.” Seeing his skin, Qin Yu frowned.

The Heaven Swallowing Python was a top-grade demonic beast!

Moreover, his strength was far above Qin Yu’s!

“There’s a good show to watch.” The people at the side quickly surrounded him.

“I didn’t expect that I would encounter such an interesting thing as soon as I came out of seclusion.”

At this moment, a familiar voice was heard.

Turning his head, he saw Yan Jinyao slowly walking over with his hands in his pockets.

“Yan Jinyao?” When he saw Yan Jinyao, Qin Yu’s expression darkened again.

This b*stard actually came too.

Yan Jinyao ignored Qin Yu and looked at Blackie. He acted like a senior and said, “Don’t worry. Just attack him. I will protect your life.”

Blackie frowned slightly. He looked at Yan Jinyao and said coldly, “Get lost.”
