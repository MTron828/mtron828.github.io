Looking at the shy little grass, Qin Yu felt a little embarrassed.

He coughed dryly and said, “I’m really sorry about what happened in the abandoned pool today. I didn’t expect that...”

“Ah!”

Hearing this, little grass’face turned even redder. She covered her face and quickly ran into the refining workshop.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but scratch his head.

“Is this child so shy?”Qin Yu whispered.

Then, he followed Xiao Cao into the refining workshop.

After entering the door, they were greeted by an uncle. Xiao Cao explained the purpose of her visit to the uncle. After the uncle heard it, he couldn’t help but look at Qin Yu in surprise.

“Using the purple-red heaven flame to temper his body? Is this a joke?”The uncle’s face was full of surprise.

Xiao Cao quickly explained, “We didn’t believe it at first, but after seeing it with our own eyes, he really can do it...”

“Heh, what a strange story. Come, I want to see how you use the purplish-red Heaven Flames to temper your body!”The uncle said with great interest.

Then, under the lead of this uncle, they walked toward the abandoned pond.

The abandoned pond of this uncle’s house was even larger than Xiao Cao’s house, so the flames of the abandoned pond were naturally more numerous.

“Come, show me.”The uncle pointed at the abandoned pond and said.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any words. He immediately walked towards the abandoned pond.

With the experience from last time, it was much easier this time.

He directly stepped into the abandoned pond. In an instant, flames rose in all directions and swept over, instantly engulfing Qin Yu!

The pain caused Qin Yu’s skin to begin to melt again, but his expression didn’t change at all.

Seeing this, the uncle couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

He swallowed his saliva and said, “This... This is actually true? There is such a genius in the world?”

“Look, I didn’t lie to you, right?”Xiao Cao said from the side.

The uncle couldn’t care less about Xiao Cao. He hurriedly ran out. In a short while, more than half of the people in the refining city surrounded him.

Seeing this scene, Xiao Cao couldn’t help but frown.

This uncle was famous for his loudspeaker. As long as he knew anything, it was the same as letting everyone in the refining city know.

Fortunately, Qin Yu didn’t care. This way, it would be much more convenient for him to temper his body, so he didn’t have to explain himself every time.

The crowd gathered around the abandoned pool and discussed animatedly. They were all quite surprised by this strange scene and began to Guess Qin Yu’s identity.

...

At the same time, the great battle at the northern border had reached its climax.

The battle prowess of Han Yan and Hong Kui, the two old monsters, could not be underestimated. Even when they were facing the northern land lord when they were young, they were not afraid at all.

This was an unprecedented great battle. The Earth was collapsing and the sky was trembling. The vast northern border had turned into a wasteland!

Everything seemed to have been broken through. No one was able to stop this battle. They stood up terrifyingly and covered the sky and earth. A supreme light enveloped everything!

This was the top expert of the Southern Region, a half-step void transformation! The strength of this expert made people tremble in fear!

Even the Master of the northern region was shaken to the core!

Without a doubt, the strength of the nine caves of the southern region had far exceeded his imagination!

The more it was like this, the more it shocked the northern Lord!

Such an expert was actually defeated by Xiao Hai? ! And it was nine people attacking at the same time? !

“Ah! !”

The northern Lord raised his head and roared angrily. The northern land forbidden arts were endless!

After all, this was not his complete body. If he held back any more, he might really die here!

Facing the powerful northern Lord, Hong Kui and old monster Han Han were forced back and were heavily injured!

The two of them were covered in blood and looked extremely miserable.

The two of them looked at each other and their eyes revealed a strong desire to fight, as if they had come to an agreement.

Then, Old Monster Han Yan rose up from the ground and raised his head to roar. His Qi and blood were burning crazily at this moment!

Old Monster Hong Kui was the same! Their Qi and blood were burning to the extreme. Their previous dispirited state was swept away and replaced by an unspeakable strong desire to fight!

Although the two of them were powerful, they were old after all, and could never be compared to their peak moments.

Facing such a powerful lord of the northern lands, they finally chose to burn their Qi and blood and fight to the death!

It seemed that no one had expected that the nine-hole old monster, who had once committed many evil deeds in the southern region, would now fight to the death!

They would rather sacrifice their lives and qi and blood to give up the last bit of light!

The sky turned black, as if indicating that the South Province would not see the light of day.

The cultivators of the South Province clenched their fists when they saw this scene.

They did not know how to evaluate whether it was the sudden realization of old monster nine holes or the effect of Xiao Hai’s agreement.

No matter what the reason was, they were all fighting to the death for the South Province today!

The war continued for several days. The strength of the northern lord was far beyond imagination.

He relied on the forbidden secret technique of the immortal slaying sect to fight even more valiantly. His monstrous aura had already drowned everything.

The scene in the sky also began to collapse. No one could see the battlefield at the northern border.

The northern border was already covered by dust and light. No one knew what was going on inside. All they knew was that the aura emitted from the internal Qi was terrifying!

Eight days later.

The elementalist walked out from the darkness.

He was covered in blood. His hair was disheveled and his body was covered in blood. His internal Qi was also extremely unstable.

However, when they saw this scene, the crowd watching from afar immediately felt despair.

“Han Yan and Hong Kui... lost!”

At this moment, they did not know who to place their hopes on. In this huge battle, countless people had their hopes rekindled.

But in the end, they were still defeated!

“So what if it’s nine holes? No one can stop me!”The elementalist raised his head and roared angrily! That terrifying voice instantly dispersed the dark clouds in the sky!

It was like a pillar of light soaring into the sky, almost piercing through the sky!

At this moment, everyone in the southern region was in despair. No one knew how to face the Northern Region’s crusade.

The elementalist stood there coldly. It was as if he was showing off his might, but also as if he was announcing something.

A moment later, he slowly retreated back to the northern border.

It was obvious that his condition was not good. Facing the two old monsters of the nine caves, the young lord of the northern region was also having a hard time dealing with them.

The four godly monarchs quickly appeared in front of the elementalist. They cupped their hands and said, “Lord.”

The elementalist coldly asked, “Have you seen that Xiao Hai?”

Sima Bei and the others’expressions changed slightly at the mention of Xiao Hai.

“We have. The one who forcefully crossed the death river previously was Xiao Hai,”Sima bei answered truthfully.

The elementalist’s expression turned cold as he coldly said, “So it was him... if it wasn’t for him, I would have completely recovered by now. Damn it...”

After this battle, the elementalist had no choice but to face the two great experts of the southern region.

According to time, the northern region’s master should have fully recovered by now. However, he had only recovered from his youth because of Xiao Hai!Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
