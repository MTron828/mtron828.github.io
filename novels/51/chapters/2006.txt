2007 Attack Again!

Yan Ruoxue also sighed and said, “It indeed surprised me. Third Princess… is a stubborn lord.”

“Whatever it is, this matter has been resolved perfectly. You can put your worries to rest now. ”

Uncle Yan didn’t tell Yan Ruoxue his actions had caused Yan Guyun to target him, which would cause a fight in the future.

…

After the escape, Qin Yu and Jue Wu rushed into the distance.

Since the Yan family had discovered this place, they would probably arrive soon.

From the looks of it, Thunder Courtyard was the safest place now. However, Qin Yu did not want to return to Thunder Courtyard at the moment. Moreover, Jue Wu was in urgent need of treatment.

After fleeing for a long time, Qin Yu arrived at a somewhat remote city.

This city was called Five Mountain City. It had five mountains towering into the clouds, like five pillars of the sky.

Five Mountain City was a mining city. Almost all the people there lived off the mines. Their daily job was to mine and exchange for spirit coins.

Qin Yu brought Jue Wu to an inn and stayed there temporarily.

After entering, Qin Yu could not wait to treat Jue Wu’s injuries.

Although Jue Wu’s injuries weren’t serious, her internal qi was extremely weak. If Qin Yu hadn’t protected her vitality gate in time, her primordial spirit would probably have dissipated by now.

Without delay, Qin Yu took out the medicinal cauldron and started refining qi-replenishing pills for Jue Wu.

This kind of pill was not considered high-grade, so it was not a problem for Qin Yu. In just a few hours, Qin Yu had already refined dozens of qi-replenishing pills.

He fed Jue with the pills, but her internal qi didn’t change at all. Her tightly closed eyes showed no signs of opening.

Qin Yu frowned. He stretched out his hand trying to sense Jue Wu’s internal qi.

As expected, her internal qi was still extremely weak.

“How could it be…” Qin Yu’s expression was tremendously ugly.

He tried to feed Jue Wu a few more pills, but the result was the same. Jue Wu did not react to the pills at all.

Qin Yu instantly panicked. He hugged Jue Wu and was at a loss. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s feelings for Jue Wu were rather complicated. It was no exaggeration to say she was definitely one of the people Qin Yu trusted the most.

If anything happened to Jue Wu, Qin Yu’s dao heart would be in chaos!

“Why is the qi-replenishing pill not helping…” Hugging Jue Wu, Qin Yu’s heart trembled slightly.

Looking at Jue Wu’s weak body, Qin Yu could not help but feel his heart aching.

“No, I can’t let Jue Wu follow me anymore.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

If she met someone like Yan Guyun, she might lose her life!

Qin Yu tried numerous methods but failed to wake Jue Wu up. After thinking about it, he decided to head to Zhoungzhou to look for a higher-level alchemist to treat Jue Wu’s injuries!

Sky City was definitely a tremendously dangerous place now. However, for the sake of Jue Wu, Qin Yu planned to take the risk and give it a try.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave Five Mountain City, he suddenly thought of something!

“Could it be… due to her physique?” Qin Yu slapped his head and recalled his encounter in Nanzhou.

That time, when Jue Wu was injured, she only needed to eat and drink a lot, and her body returned to normal!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly settled Jue Wu down. Then he ran out of the inn and went to the tavern to buy meat and wine.

Qin Yu couldn’t wait to rush back to the inn with the wine and meat.

He fed the meat and wine to Jue Wu. As expected, when she ate the 108th duck leg, she slowly opened her eyes, and her internal qi recovered by more than half!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu instantly heaved a sigh of relief.

“Really…a weirdo.” Qin Yu could not help but shake his head.

Jue Wu opened her eyes sleepily. She scratched her head and said in a daze, “Where is this place?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and could only tell Jue Wu what had happened.

After hearing this, Jue Wu seemed to have thought of something.

She frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “That Yan Guyun is extremely terrifying. With my strength, I’m afraid I won’t be able to do anything to him at all! Moreover… I don’t think it was even his true strength.”

Qin Yu also had the same feeling. He looked at Jue Wu and said coldly, “After all, he’s from the Yan family. In the future, we will encounter more powerful existences like him. If we bump into them, we will definitely die!”

After hearing what Qin Yu said, Jue Wu said casually, “If we’re afraid of them, we’ll just run!”

Qin Yu, who had wanted to take the opportunity to scare Jue Wu, could not help but sigh.

Jue Wu had always been insensitive. How could she be frightened by a few of Qin Yu’s words?

“Jue Wu, with your strength, you will surely surpass Yan Guyun in the future and become one of the strongest people in the entire starry sky,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Why are you telling me this?” Jue Wu asked, feeling puzzled.

“Therefore, you don’t need to risk your life by staying by my side,” Qin Yu said solemnly. “You’d better hurry back to Thunder Courtyard. With Dean Lei around, I believe no one will dare to do anything to you.”

Jue Wu glared and immediately reprimanded, “I’m not leaving! What’re you going to do after I leave? Unless you come back to Thunder Courtyard with me!”

“I have my own methods. As long as you don’t follow me, no one will know my identity,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After that, Qin Yu immediately activated his secret technique and changed his appearance.

“In this way, no one can find me. However, if you follow me, you will attract their attention instead. Therefore… You should rush back to Thunder Courtyard,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Do you think it works?” Jue Wu sneered and said. “With your methods, once you meet someone like Yan Guyun, I’m afraid you’ll be seen through with a glance, right?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth but could not refute what Jue Wu said.

...

Yan Guyun’s strength had surpassed Qin Yu’s understanding. No one knew how powerful he was.

“Alright, I won’t be going back. Don’t forget I still have a Saint Weapon I haven’t used,” Jue Wu grinned and said.

“I underestimated him this time. Next time, I’ll take out my Saint Weapon. Even if I can’t kill him, I can at least escape.” Jue Wu said casually.

Qin Yu shook his head helplessly. He knew it was impossible to change Jue Wu’s thoughts. Thus he did not say anything else.

“Looks like I have to think of a way to get a magic artifact for Jue Wu that can hide the internal qi,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

In the following few days, Qin Yu and Jue Wu did not leave Five Mountain City. They planned to hide here for the time being and observe in secret.

If the people from the nine great aristocratic families were to pursue them relentlessly, they could only escape when the time came.

Another five days went by. Five Peak Mountain was still quiet. At the same time, the mysterious person of the demon race attacked again!

His target this time was even more shocking because that person was none other than the previous Holy Son of the Yan family, Yan Yunfan!
