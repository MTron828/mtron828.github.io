Chapter 1721: Yuan Xiu Arrived at Tianyun Sect Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Just as Qin Yu had thought, this Pilgrimage City was built by the two men of the Chao family.

The entire city was filled with their people. It was no exaggeration to say that there was not a single outsider in the entire city.

Qin Yu’s sudden arrival naturally attracted a lot of attention.

Qin Yu asked directly while the two were chatting, “Sir, is there only Pilgrimage City in Xihuang?”

The old man shook his head. “Of course not. There are three cities in Xihuang, but Pilgrimage City is the most powerful of the three. If our sect master wanted to, those two cities would have disappeared a long time ago.

Qin Yu touched his chin and asked, “I’m very curious about how you guys usually cultivate. The spiritual energy here is so thin that it doesn’t seem to be suitable for cultivation.”

The old man replied indifferently, “I can’t tell you that, but if you really want to know, I can introduce you to someone.”

“Thank you so much!” Qin Yu said happily.

The old man said, “Wait here for a while, I’ll be back soon.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Alright, thank you.”

After the old turned around, he went straight to the center of Pilgrimage City.

In City Lord Palace of Pilgrimage City, a man with long hair and a fierce look was sitting on the throne.

He was playing with a bead in his hand, and he seemed to like this bead very much.

Chao Cang said coldly, “Brother Shou, Qin Yu was kind of stubborn. I invited him twice and he rejected me twice.”

“It’s fine,” The man on the throne said indifferently.

This person was Chao Shou.

“Brother Shou, do you have the confidence to defeat Xiao Sheng this time?” Chao Cang continued to ask.

Chao Shou sneered. He shook the bead in his hand and said, “With this item in hand, I’m not afraid of anyone. I can use great divine abilities with it.”

Chao Cang nodded and said, “That’s true.”

They had obtained this bead by chance. It was also because of this bead that the two brothers of the Chao family became the most powerful people in Xihuang and almost reigned here.

However, the two of them still didn’t know what the bead was. They didn’t even know much about its abilities.

At this moment, the old man hurriedly walked in.

He cupped his hands to the two brothers and said, “A strange young man came to the city and asked for a lot of information about Xihuang.”

“What’s so strange about that? After the dead river disappeared, people came to Xihuang every day.” Chao Shou was inddiferent.

The old man nodded and said, “However, this young man is not simple. You’d better go and take a look. I suspect he was sent by Nanzhou.

Although Chao Shou was reluctant, he still asked after thinking for a moment, “What kind of young man is he?”

The old man didn’t hide anything and immediately described Qin Yu’s characteristics.

After Chao Cang heard this, he couldn’t help but frown. “Could he be Qin Yu? Did he really come?”

“Qin Yu?” Chao Shou was also interested.

Chao Cang nodded and said, “His description indeed matches Qin Yu. However, he clearly said that he wouldn’t come. Why did he come now?”

Chao Shou stood up slowly. With a faint smile, he said, “I heard that Qin Yu has a chaotic body and defeated Yuan Xiu when Yuan Xiu was young. I’m quite interested in him.”

Chao Cang reached out with his hand and a portrait appeared in front of the old man.

“Is it him?” Chao Cang asked.

The old man took a closer look and nodded repeatedly. “That’s right. It’s him!”

“It really is Qin Yu.” Chao Cang’s expression immediately turned cold.

“Please wait a moment. I’ll go and bring him back.”

After saying that, Chao Cang turned around to look for Qin Yu.

At this moment, Chao Shou reached out and stopped Chao Cang.

Chao Shou said indifferently, “I want to meet this Qin Yu personally. Lead the way.”

“Yes!”

In North Plain, two of Yuan Xiu’s three clones stayed to protect the original body, while the last one was planning on something. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Sima Bei and Yong Ji half-knelt in front of Yuan Xiu. The two of them were waiting for Yuan Xiu’s orders.

There were hundreds of thousands of people outside the door. They were all dressed in black and looked quite imposing.

“Tomorrow, follow me to Nanzhou.”

Yuan Xiu said this coldly after a long time.

Upon hearing this, Sima Bei and Yong Ji were instantly overjoyed and quickly shouted, “Yes!”

“Master, where are we going in Nanzhou tomorrow?” Sima Bei asked.

“Tianyun Sect, of course. It’s time for Xiao Sheng to pay the price.” Yuan Xiu squinted his eyes and sneered.

“Hell yeah! Finally!” Yong Ji roared inwardly.

He couldn’t wait to see how frustrated Xiao Sheng would be when he was defeated.

It was the same for Sima Bei. He and Yong Ji shared the same thoughts, but there were some differences.

Sima Bei wanted to see Yuan Xiu unify Lizhou!

The next day, a large number of people from North Plain began to gather and rush toward Nanzhou.

Ever since Yuan Xiu had recovered, the people at the northern border had begun to retreat. Without Reversion Void Stage, they would only be courting death if they stayed.

Dense black shadows appeared in the sky of Nanzhou. They were like dark clouds.

Such a terrifying scene shocked everyone in Nanzhou.

“What’s that? A huge flock of birds?”

“What are you talking about? Those are obviously dark clouds! It’s going to rain. Go home and take your clothes inside!”

“Are you two blind? They are humans! They are from North Plain!”

“What the hell? People from North Plain? Are they going to make a move?”

As soon as these words came out, a lot of people immediately panicked. The scene was a mess.

In Tianyun Sect, Deputy Sect Master ran to the foot of Cultivation Mountain in a hurry and shouted desperately, “Sect master, bad news! We just got information that the people of North Plain have already begun to take action!”

In a short while, Xiao Sheng walked down from Cultivation Mountain.

“Sect master, bad news! Yuan Xiu has personally led a team into Nanzhou and his target seems to be Tianyun Sect!” Deputy Sect Master panted and looked terrified.

However, Xiao Sheng seemed to be a little excited.

“Finally!” Xiao Sheng said in a low voice as he narrowed his eyes.

“Sect master, Sima Bei and Yong Ji are here as well! There are three men of Reversion Void Stage!” Deputy Sect Master’s expression was kind of terrible.

A man of half-step Reversion Void Stage was definitely no match for three men of Reversion Void Stage. Even Xiao Sheng could not be sure that he was able to win this battle.

Xiao Sheng did not say anything more. With a leap, he turned around and left Tianyun Sect. He landed on a mountain peak far away from Tianyun Sect and quietly waited for the arrival of Yuan Xiu.

As time passed, a large group of people arrived at Tianyun Sect.

Those people surrounded Tianyun Sect.

For a moment, the people of the entire Tianyun Sect were flustered and at a loss.

Yuan Xiu looked down at them with a cold expression.
