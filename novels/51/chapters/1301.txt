Chapter 1302: Chapter 1302, the difference in status 

The holy power of the half-saint weapon filled the air, shocking everyone.

The closer the half-saint weapon was, the more powerful the holy power became. Those who were weak couldn’t withstand this power at all.

Qin Yu’s face became more and more serious. His brain was spinning rapidly as he thought of countermeasures.

“TSK, TSK, tsk. Aren’t you guys too shameless? Who Bullies People Like This?”

At this moment, a voice sounded out.

Turning around, he saw two youths walking over with cheeky smiles on their faces.

Upon seeing these two youths, the Almighty’s face turned black as he coldly said, “Who are you people? You Dare to meddle in other people’s business? Could it be that you’re Qin Yu’s accomplice?”

“Bullshit! We’re just passing by and roaring at injustice,”the two youths muttered.

Qin Yu looked at the two young men and realized that their clothes were luxurious, but their temperament didn’t match their clothes at all.

“I advise you to mind your own business...”at this moment, Ling Yun walked over from not far away.

He looked extremely weak, but the viciousness in his glasses didn’t diminish.

“It’s not that we’re meddling in other people’s business, but aren’t you guys being too much of a bully? We agreed on a 1V1. If you can’t beat me, you found so many people and even threatened me with a half-saint weapon. Shameless!”One of the young men scolded.

“That’s right, that’s right. Bah, Shameless!”

The two of them chimed in, making Ling Yun, who was already furious, look even more unsightly.

“Both of you, I advise you not to meddle in the affairs of our Heavenly Cloud Sect.”The almighty sized them up and seemed to have noticed that these two people had extraordinary backgrounds. He didn’t dare to make a move immediately and only spoke out to probe, using the Heavenly Cloud sect to oppress the two of them.

Unexpectedly, these two people didn’t take it seriously at all. One of the young men even snorted and said, “What’s wrong with the Heavenly Cloud Sect? is the Heavenly Cloud sect unreasonable?”

“I think you’re courting death!”Ling Yun instantly flew into a rage!

Following Ling Yun’s angry scolding, the nine almighty experts also took a step forward in unison.

These two young men weren’t afraid at all. They snorted coldly and said, “Are you trying to scare us? Do you think we’re Big Shots?”

Seeing their attitude, the almighty felt that something was wrong.

He narrowed his eyes and asked tentatively, “Who are you two? Why do you want to interfere in the affairs of our Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“This young master is called Wen Da, and this is my younger brother Wen Er!”One of the young men patted his chest and said.

The young man called Wen er also said casually, “That’s right, we are the famous Wen Brothers!”

“Wen Brothers? How come I’ve never heard of them?”

“Where did they come from? They don’t seem to be very strong.”

Even the almighty beside Ling Yun couldn’t help but look puzzled. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Wen Da and Wen Er? weren’t they just two nameless people?

“That shouldn’t be. How would a nameless person dare to interfere in the affairs of my Heavenly Cloud Sect...”he thought to himself.

“Cut the crap. Kill them both!”Ling Yun said through gritted teeth.

Just as the few almighty experts were about to make their move, Ling Yun’s follower suddenly thought of something.

He hurriedly shouted, “Stop!”

Ling Yun’s expression turned cold as he said coldly, “What are you doing?”

“Young Master, allow me to investigate before making a decision,”the Almighty said.

Then, he looked at Wen Dawen er and asked tentatively, “Who is Wen Wanli to you?”

“That’s my grandfather!”Said Wen da proudly.

Hearing this, the expression of the almighty instantly became a bit ugly.

They really had a background!

“These two kids... are actually Wen Wanli’s grandsons...”

“Wen Wanli? That Wen Wanli who killed eighteen almighty experts from various sects?”

“No wonder he dared to challenge the Tianyun sect. He’s actually Wen Wanji’s grandson...”

“There are really many hidden dragons and tigers in this Gu City...”

Wen Wanji’s name seemed to be extremely famous, and many people started discussing it.

Even the nine mighty figures subconsciously took a few steps back.

“So what if you’re Wen Wanji... If you dare to meddle in my business, I’ll kill you!”Ling Yun almost roared.

“TSK TSK TSK, this is for you. Come, try touching my finger!”Wen Da gave Ling Yun the middle finger.

“That’s right, that’s right. If we lose a single hair, my grandfather Will Skin You Alive!”Wen Er also shouted.

“You two old trash, how dare you shout at me!”Ling Yun shouted angrily.

The Wen brothers didn’t feel embarrassed at all about the old gnawing. Instead, they said proudly, “I can gnaw, Can You Gnaw? Are you envious?”

Ling Yun, who was extremely furious, was even more furious now.

He glared at his follower and said through gritted teeth, “Kill him! Kill them!”

However, that Almighty shook his head and said, “Young Master Ling, you mustn’t. If you touch them today, Wen Wanli will definitely not let it go...”

“So what! My Tianyun sect isn’t afraid of him!”Ling Yun shouted loudly.

Wen Da, who was not far away, sneered. “Little Bi, stop shouting at me. Think about your identity carefully.”

“That’s right, that’s right. You’re not the son of the sect master of Tianyun sect, but we’re my grandfather’s biological grandchildren!”Wen Er added.

Even the attendant beside Ling Yun said in a deep voice, “They’re right. If you’re the descendant of the sect master, you might be able to challenge them, but aren’t you...”
