2354 Thunder Action

In Solitary Cloud City, at this moment, a group of people had already obtained all the information.

The information intelligence capabilities of the great aristocratic families were tremendously powerful. For some information, they only needed to verify with each other to determine its authenticity.

At this moment, the expression of everyone became very intriguing. Si Qianjing looked at Ni Wuxiao and Yao Xi with an unfriendly expression.

“Your two families have actually attempted to conceal such important news and keep it to yourselves. It’s truly disheartening.”

The Yan, Jiang, and Gu families also stared at them with unfriendly expressions.

“Everyone, it isn’t the time to argue now. Holy Son Yao and I felt the news was unreliable and thus wanted to test it first.”

Ni Wuxiao braced himself and explained.

“For the Jee family’s treasures this time, you two will receive your portions reduced by half.”

Yan Yunfan’s suddenly voiced out, representing the will of the Yan family. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Half? Absolutely not.”

Yao Xi’s expression changed drastically. The Jee family had such terrifying treasures. If he were to take his portion reduced by half, his family would doubt his ability in the future.

Ni Wuxiao’s expression also turned extremely ugly. He stared at Yan Yunfan with an unfriendly expression.

“Don’t look so murderous. You two families have plotted against us in the first place. This isn’t the will of my Yan family alone. The other seven families and the Teng family have also notified you. Furthermore, we have informed your Holy Lords.”

Yan Yunfan sneered and said.

“Hmph!”

Ni Wuxiao flung his sleeves, his face turned cold, and he spoke no more.

Seeing the seven families united, Yao Xi dared not say anything else. The nine great aristocratic families had been restraining each other. This time, they had provoked everyone’s anger, and the nine great aristocratic families indeed had evidence to use against them.

“Qin Yu, I must kill you!”

Yao Xi’s face contorted, and the flesh on his cheeks kept twitching.

“Since we’ve already decided, let’s head to the Azure Ridge Continent immediately. We’ve received news that Qin Yu has established a sect in the Azure Firmament Sect, and everyone from the Ji family is in the original Azure Firmament Sect.”

Yan Yunfan sneered and said.

“If he knows what’s good for him, so be it. If he doesn’t, kill him with the power of thunder. I’m not like you guys who will give him a chance.”

“What the hell? If you have the ability, go and kill him.”

When Yao Xi saw Yan Yunfan’s behavior, he instantly cursed.

“You don’t have to worry. I’m not as brainless as you two. When are you going to use the criminals here, if not now? Xi Menn, Chang Ye, Mei Li, and someone who has already broken through.”

Yan Yunfan immediately made arrangements. Even Ni Wuxiao could not find any loopholes in this arrangement.

“Brother Teng, do you think my arrangement is safe?”

Yan Yunfan looked at Teng Zixu.

“Brother Yan, go ahead with your arrangements. I won’t interfere in these matters. But I just want to remind you that if he succeeds in cultivating the holy body, we might not be able to kill him if the Path of Heaven doesn’t change.”

With a slight move of his body, Teng Zixu disappeared from the Moon Listening Pavilion.

“Hmph, everything has been well arranged. Those criminals should be arriving at the Azure Ridge Continent by now. We should set off now.”

Yan Yunfan sneered and said.

Nearly 20 people with shackles on their feet were brought out. These people were chained to each other.

Each of them appeared lifeless, their expressions devoid of emotion, as if they had already endured countless tortures.

“Brother, my feet hurt. Can you loosen a little?”

A skinny little girl was dragging the ankle cuff with difficulty. Her cultivation was tremendously low, and as she had been in prison for too long, she could not use her spiritual power at all.

At this moment, the shackles were deeply embedded in her ankles, and blood dripped down her fair feet onto the ground.

“Loosen my foot! Hurry up!”

Yao Xi slapped the little girl’s face, venting his anger.

“If we kill her, who will control Xi Menn?”

Yan Yunfan frowned and said unhappily.

“It’s none of your business. I’ll take responsibility if I kill her, okay?” Yao Xi snorted coldly.

“Hmph, I’m afraid you can’t take the responsibility.”

Yan Yunfan snorted coldly.

He took out a gourd from his hand and blew a breath of spiritual energy into it.

The gourd instantly grew hundreds of times bigger, and then it swept everyone inside and began to sail toward the Azure Ridge Continent.

…

Just as Qin Yu started cultivating, he was interrupted by a massive explosion.

“Chang Ye?”

His divine sense scanned the many people outside the door. All these people seemed to be the top-notch martial artists of purgatory.

With a move of his body, he arrived outside the sect, staring at the many people before him.

“Everyone, we don’t seem to have any grudges against each other. Now that the alien races constantly descend, you’re attacking my sect. What do you mean by this?”

Qin Yu looked at Chang Ye and asked.

“Sigh, we have no choice.”

Chang Ye shook his head with a bitter expression.

“The Holy Region forced you to come?”

Qin Yu’s expression changed.

He had long received news that the Holy Region had banished many talented cultivators who had offended them to purgatory, but they had controlled their loved ones.

They used this to control them and this method to firmly control a large faction in purgatory.

Qin Yu had suffered a blow from Xi Menn when he first entered purgatory. It was because Xi Menn had received a message from the Holy Region.

“They came so soon. It seems that not all from the Holy Region are idiots. They want to kill you before you completely cultivate your holy body.”

Ji Yue looked at the cultivators at the door, and her expression was extremely ugly.

It was very likely that all the aristocratic families had already received the news and were now going all out to plunder the Jee family’s treasures.

“Qin Yu, you can just hand me over and escape.”

Qin Yu shook his head with a smile. Sensing Ji Yue’s emotions, he said without fear.

“Don’t worry, even if I die in battle, I won’t hand you over. I have to face this situation soon or later.”

“Are you guys here to reminisce or what?” Yao Xi shouted in a sharp voice.

Yan Yunfan’s gourd magical artifact tore through the air and appeared above everyone’s heads.

Nearly a hundred people landed on the empty ground.

“Qin Yu, my parents are in their hands. Sorry to offend you.”

Chang Ye crossed his palms, and his ten fingers moved like playing a musical instrument.

Two brilliant, star-like powers of the Path of Heaven descended into his palms, and countless tiny tadpole-like symbols lit up.

The power of the Path of Heaven turned into a hundreds of meters long talisman stuck in front of the Azure Firmament Sect.

“Boom!”

A massive surge of spiritual energy suddenly exploded, its immense force causing the entire Azure Firmament Sect to tremble vigorously.

In the positions of the four symbols and eight trigrams in the Azure Firmament Sect, countless spiritual energies appeared.

And these spiritual energies suddenly transformed into giant eight trigrams in the air.

It directly absorbed the explosive power of the rune and slowly rotated to digest the power within.

The Heaven and Earth Formation of the Universe.

“This formation can withstand peak saint power. They can’t break in if it doesn’t suffer too much power simultaneously.”

Wang Feng appeared beside Qin Yu and carefully stared at the attacking cultivator.
