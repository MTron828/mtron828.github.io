Chapter 1035: Chapter 1,035, I don’t want to kill you

Zhai Xing held the Soul Bell and pondered for a long time before finally putting it away.

“No matter what, we must get rid of him, no matter what price we have to pay!”

These words circled around Zhai Xing’s ears.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu had already returned to the Heaven Gate.

He sent people to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and brought Little Qing to the Heaven Gate.

Little Qing’s talent was not considered strong, but her strength was not weak.

She had already stepped into the realm of the martial marquis at such a young age.

In the room, Little Qing carefully sat opposite Qin Yu.

She, who had yet to experience the world, looked somewhat shy.

Qin Yu poured her a cup of tea and said with a smile, “Don’t be nervous. I just want to ask you a few questions.”

Little Qing nodded and waited for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu took a sip of tea and said quietly, “You are a native of the second mystic realm. I want to know the relevant information about the second mystic realm.”

“For example... how many people are there in the second mystic realm, how many people are controlled by the Gu family, and how powerful the Gu family is.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Xiao Qing was slightly surprised.

She said in a low voice, “I’m just an ordinary person in the second secret area, and I don’t have much to do with the Gu family. There are many things that we don’t have the right to know.”

“Then tell me what you know,”said Qin Yu.

Little Qing tried hard to recall the information about the second secret area.

“The population of the second secret area is about 30,000 people, more than half of which is occupied by the Martial Marquis,”said Little Qing.

“Around thirty thousand people?”Qin Yu could not help but raise his eyebrows.

This surprised him a little.

In other words, there were at least ten thousand martial marquis in the second secret area!

Even a martial saint would have to weigh such a number.

“I really underestimated them,”said Qin Yu with a frown.

“As for your strength and foundation, I’m not too sure. I only know that the Gu clan is very powerful,”continued little qing.

“Do you know Master Zhai Xing?”At this moment, Xiao Qing suddenly thought of something. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes.”

“Although the Gu family controls the second mystic realm, Zhai Xing controls more than half of the military power,”Xiao Qing said.

“In addition to the military power, there are also the storage of magical artifacts, the storage of herbs, and so on. They each have their own duties.”

“The GU family only needs people who control Zhai Xing to be able to firmly control the second mystic realm in their hands.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

It seemed that the structure of the second mystic realm was similar to that of the current world, and it was controlled level by level.

However, it was not strange. It had been like this since ancient times. No one could control the entire world on their own.

“However, the most powerful one is still Gu Zizhen. It is said that they have a few extremely terrifying spiritual artifacts that were given to them by the heavens,”Xiao Qing continued.

“It was also because of these few spiritual artifacts that the Gu family became the chosen one. This also caused everyone to be willing to follow them. After all, no one was willing to go against the heavens.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

The second secret realm was clearly still in a state of unliberation.

The so-called chosen one was just a tool used to control power.

Just like the ancient uprisings, most people would use this kind of excuse to win over the hearts of the people.

“The heaven you speak of should be those eight high-level officials,”said Qin Yu.

“Those few spiritual artifacts should have been given to them by the high-level officials.”

Little Qing shook his head and said, “I’m not too sure about that. Anyway, this kind of legend is widely spread. Everyone, from the elderly to the children, knows about it.”

“Other than these, I’m not too sure about the rest,”Little Qing said.

Qin Yu touched his chin.

The strength of the second mystic realm was obviously much stronger than he had imagined.

In this way, his three hundred disciples would probably be reduced to cannon fodder.

It was impossible to develop a large number of martial marquis in a short period of time.

Even if all the martial artists in the world were added together, they would not be able to gather ten thousand martial marquis.

“Can I go back now?”Xiao Qing asked carefully.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I have already arranged a place for you. There are people waiting for you outside.”

Hearing this, Xiao Qing quickly stood up and walked out.

Qin Yu sat in the room and could not help but fall into deep thought.

If Qin Yu went crazy over 10,000 martial marquis, he might be able to win, but the price would be too high.

Moreover, Gu Zizhen was not a pushover.

The best way is to lure Gu Zizhen to this world and kill him! Qin Yu thought to himself.

As long as he killed Gu Zizhen, the second mystic realm would be destroyed.

That night, Qin Yu thought for an entire night, but he still could not come up with a good idea.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to go to the second mystic realm first.

With Qin Yu’s current ability, it would not be easy for the second secret area to trap him.

Even if it was Gu Zizhen, who was at the peak of the Martial Saint Realm, Qin Yu was not afraid.

“I wonder if the higher-ups will have a backup plan.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Even the Wan family secret area had a backup plan, let alone the second secret area.

Qin Yu did not continue to think about it. He planned to go to the second secret area first.

On the same day.

A piece of news spread out:

Zhai Xing had killed Qin Yu in the name of Gu Zizhen. Now, he had arrived at Jingdu!

This piece of news immediately attracted countless eyeballs!

One had to know that Zhai Xing represented the top experts among the old martial saints. His battle achievements were illustrious. Who knew how many Martial Saints had died at his hands!

And Qin Yu was the martial saint of the new generation. He had killed Qiao Zun with three punches and flattened the Wan family’s mystic realm. He was currently in the limelight!

This battle was undoubtedly full of gimmicks!

Not only did many martial artists of the current era come when they heard the news, even some disciples of the secret realm had risked their lives to rush to the vicinity of the Heaven Gate. They intended to witness this battle with their own eyes!

“Zhai Xing... I knew you would definitely come.”Qin Yu’s face was expressionless as he looked at the message on his phone.

Regarding Zhai Xing, Qin Yu’s heart was rather complicated.

He could sense that Zhai Xing’s nature was not bad.

When the Sky Blood Rainbow attacked, Zhai Xing was the only martial saint who stood out!

He disregarded his own safety and fought the sky blood rainbow with all his might. He almost died!

More importantly, he had let Qin Yu go twice! Otherwise, Qin Yu would have become a skeleton long ago!

“Zhai Xing... Why Did you come? I don’t want to kill you...”Qin Yu could not help but clench his fists.
