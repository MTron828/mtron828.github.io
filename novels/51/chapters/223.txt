When he heard Qin Yu’s words, Hui Ming’s expression suddenly changed!

He hurriedly took two steps back and said with some vigilance, “Qin Yu, what do you mean by this?”

“What do I mean?” Qin Yu sneered repeatedly.

“Do you still want to pretend? You tried to take my life three times. Do you really think I didn’t notice?” Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, Hui Ming still tried to hide it.

He braced himself and said, “Qin Yu, you and I have fought each other before. Why would I take your life...”

Qin Yu drank a mouthful of water and said indifferently, “Indeed, Tao Shan wouldn’t take my life and wouldn’t provoke me. But unfortunately, you aren’t Tao Shan.”

As soon as he said this, Hui Ming’s face was immediately filled with shock!

Since things had already come to this point, there was no point in continuing to pretend. Therefore, Hui Ming simply stopped all pretenses.

He sneered and said, “I really didn’t expect to be seen through by you.”

“But... I’m very curious. How do you know that I’m not Tao Shan?” Hui Ming asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “You have too many flaws. The most important thing is... Tao Shan is a tough man, but you... are like a sissy.”

Hui Ming’s pupils suddenly dilated!

He glared at Qin Yu and shouted, “You’re insulting me!”

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “Tsk tsk, I can’t believe you saw through it.”

Hui Ming’s body was full of dark energy and he had the intention to make a move!

“If I’m not wrong, you’re that b*stard from the Earth Fiend Valley, right?” Qin Yu continued to say.

Hui Ming frowned again and the shock on his face deepened.

“Hahahaha!” Hui Ming burst into laughter.

“I didn’t expect you to guess it! But so what? Do you think you can walk out alive today?” Hui Ming sneered.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, looked indifferent.

He glanced at Hui Ming and sneered. “Stop pretending. If you really had the ability to kill me, there would be no need for you to go through such lengths.”

It was just as Qin Yu said.

Hui Ming wasn’t confident at all.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t need to use Jiang Gu at all.

“If we fight openly, I might not be your opponent,” Hui Ming said sinisterly.

“But do you think I would stand here if I wasn’t fully prepared?”

As soon as he said that, Hui Ming suddenly roared!

In an instant, nine streams of black energy burst out from nine different directions!

The black energy seemed as if it was going to swallow up the entire house. The eerie and terrifying aura was even more freaky!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the scene in front of him and asked in a low voice, “What is this?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Hui Ming didn’t say a word. His hands quickly slid through the air.

A few minutes later, the nine streaks of black gas began to disappear.

The surrounding environment didn’t seem to have changed at all. It also seemed as if everything had changed.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “You’ve been shouting for quite some time, yet this is all you’ve got? It seems that the Earth Fiend Valley’s cultivation method isn’t that good.”

When he heard Qin Yu’s words, a few veins popped up on Hui Ming’s forehead.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, you won’t be complacent for too long. Let me tell you, you won’t be able to escape today!”

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He looked coldly at Hui Ming and said, “Even if you didn’t come looking for me, I would have still come looking for you, because the people of the Earth Fiend Valley deserve to die!”

“Hahahaha!” Hui Ming burst into laughter.

“Then give it a shot!” Hui Ming put his hands behind his back and looked very confident.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

He detested the Earth Fiend Valley to the extreme.

This kind of spell that harmed ordinary people shouldn’t exist in this world!

Since he couldn’t kill the ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley for the time being, he might as well kill Hui Ming, who was in front of him!

“Whoosh!”

Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. The energy in his entire body burst out and his body suddenly disappeared from where he was!

An extremely fierce fist arrived in front of Hui Ming in an instant!

This astonishingly fast speed made Hui Ming’s expression change!

His aura made Hui Ming even more fearful!

Even Jiang Gu, who wasn’t far away, had a face full of fear!

This time, Qin Yu... seemed to be even stronger than he was the last time they exchanged blows!

“Bang!”

He punched Hui Ming’s face without any deviation.

His entire body was sent flying and smashed into the wall!

His entire face almost cracked. If Tao Shan’s body wasn’t tough, this punch would have smashed his head!

Qin Yu looked at Hui Ming and couldn’t help but snort coldly. “Is that all you’ve got?”

“Hahaha!”

However, Hui Ming quickly stood up from the ground.

What was shocking was that the wound on his face was healing at an extremely fast speed!

In almost an instant, his face had recovered to its original state! Not a single scar could be seen!

“How is this possible?!” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Even a top-tier pharmacist wouldn’t be able to heal it in such a short period of time!

“No matter what trick you have, I will destroy it today!” Qin Yu roared angrily and stepped forward once again!

This time, Qin Yu’s punch was even more ferocious!

Just the force of the punch caused the entire room to vibrate and almost collapse!

“What a powerful qi energy!” Hui Ming exclaimed!

However, not only did he not panic, but a hint of excitement flashed in his eyes instead!

“Boom!”

This punch smashed Tao Shan’s tough body into pieces!

Large patches of flesh and blood appeared, and countless tendons and bones were shattered!

“Just a physical body can unleash such terrifying power. How inconceivable...” Jiang Gu was also shocked by this punch!

“Hahaha!”

Very quickly, Hui Ming stood up once again.

As usual, his physical body recovered very quickly.

“Hahaha! As expected of a chaotic body!”

“Originally, I only wanted to take back the stone statue. Ever since I found out that you are a chaotic body, I’ve changed my mind.” Hui Ming’s eyes were filled with frenzy!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Why? Do you want to possess me?”

Hui Ming sneered and said, “No, this body of mine is enough.”

“I want to kill you and use your body to resurrect the ancestor!”

“At that time, the Earth Fiend Valley will no longer have to cower in the southwest!” Hui Ming raised his head and laughed loudly.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

He glanced at Hui Ming and said indifferently, “The ancestor you mentioned... could it be that old b*stard in the stone statue? Tsk tsk, you are really a filial good lap dog.”

When he heard this, Hui Ming’s pupils instantly dilated!

“You... you’ve already entered the stone statue?” Hui Ming glared at Qin Yu and said angrily.

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “That’s right, not only have I entered, but I’ve also absorbed his dark energy.”

“I have to say, this old b*stard’s dark energy is really vast. He’s a good tool to exploit.”

Qin Yu’s words infuriated Hui Ming!

He raised his head and roared, “Ah!!! You actually dared to treat the ancestor as a tool! Qin Yu, I’m going to kill you!!”

After saying that, Hui Ming pressed his palms together and chanted a spell silently. A huge black sphere quickly appeared above his head!
