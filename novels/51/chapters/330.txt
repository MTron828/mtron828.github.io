Chapter 331: Because... I Have Blue Spiritual Fire Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When the two alchemists saw the green-colored spiritual fire in the girl in red’s palm, their expressions changed drastically!

They immediately stepped aside and said, “Please come in!”

The girl in red put away the spiritual fire and strode into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

When she passed by Qin Yu, she even deliberately glanced at him, and her eyes seemed to contain some disdain.

“So you have green spiritual fire! We really are a match made in heaven!” Yao Qing said with a smile.

The girl in red stopped in her tracks and said coldly, “As if you’re worthy?”

After saying this, the girl in red strode into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Yao Qing rolled up his sleeves and said angrily, “Stop right there! I’ll teach you a lesson!”

“Enough. Don’t you find it embarrassing?” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Yao Qing said angrily, “Mr. Qin, this b*tch mocked you! How can I tolerate this?!”

“Screw you!” Qin Yu smiled and kicked Yao Qing’s butt.

“Don’t waste time. Hurry up and go in.” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Therefore, Qin Yu and Yao Qing strode into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

By the time they entered, the girl in the red dress had long disappeared. She must have wanted to get rid of Yao Qing.

As soon as they entered the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the first thing they saw was a huge building that looked like an ancestral shrine.

In the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, herbs and alchemists could be seen everywhere.

Many herbs that had been used for decades were used for the training of alchemists.

Such extravagance was really eye-opening.

Soon, an apothecary walked up.

He sized up Qin Yu and asked, “You are?”

Qin Yu said politely, “I’m here to apply for the position of an apothecary.”

“Qin Yu?” He asked tentatively.

“It’s me.” Qin Yu nodded.

The apothecary nodded and said, “Fifth Elder has been waiting for you for a long time. Come with me.”

After saying that, he took the lead and walked forward. Qin Yu and Yao Qing followed closely behind.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion was extremely large, and there were countless houses.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was like a small city!

Not only were there modern and ancient style buildings, but there were even mountains, rivers, forests, and trees.

The apothecary led Qin Yu around and finally stopped in front of a mansion.

On the door plaque of the mansion, there were a few big words: Elder’s mansion.

And at the end of the plaque, there was a small number “5” .

“Go in.” The apothecary said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu hurriedly walked towards the Elder’s mansion.

“You can’t go in.” At this moment, the apothecary stopped Yao Qing.

Yao Qing touched his nose and said, “Mr. Qin and I are...”

“Even if you are his father, you can’t go in,” the apothecary said with a cold expression.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Wait for me outside.”

Then, Qin Yu took the lead and stepped into the Elder’s residence.

As he pushed the door open and entered, Qin Yu smelled a strong herbal aroma.

There were several hundred-year-old herbs around the Elder’s residence!

These herbs were scattered all over the ground. None of them were treated like top-rank herbs.

“Qin Yu, you’re here.”

At this moment, Fifth Elder’s voice came from the side.

Qin Yu cupped his hands to him and said, “Greetings, Fifth Elder.”

The Fifth Elder smiled and said, “You’re too polite. Hurry up and sit down.”

Qin Yu and the Fifth Elder sat in front of a stone table.

The Fifth Elder poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu and said indifferently, “I knew you would come.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but force a smile when he heard this. “To tell you the truth, I didn’t really want to come before. It’s just that...”

“It’s just that time is too tight, and you come from a humble background. You don’t have any resources or connections, right?” The Fifth Elder said indifferently.

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “Fifth Elder, how did you know?”

The Fifth Elder laughed out loud and said, “I’ve also heard about the matter between you and the heiress of the Yan family!”

Qin Yu’s face instantly turned red and he appeared extremely bashful.

Fifth Elder, on the other hand, was very open-minded. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said jokingly, “What’s there to be embarrassed about? Don’t people spend their lives pursuing money or women?”

After hearing the Fifth Elder’s teasing, Qin Yu felt much more relaxed.

He smiled and said, “I didn’t expect you to be so forthright.”

The Fifth Elder sighed and said, “Back then, I had also fallen head over heels in love with a woman. It’s a pity that she married a rich person in the end.”

At this point, the Fifth Elder waved his hand and said, “Alright, let’s not talk about this.”

He said seriously, “With your talent, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion should at least give you a position as an Elder. However, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion does not have such a precedent, so we can only let you put up with it for the time being.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Fifth Elder, you are too courteous.”

Immediately after, the Fifth Elder took out a purple token from the side.

On the token, two words were engraved: Qin Yu.

“I have already prepared it for you. From today onwards, you are a purple alchemist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Other than the Elders and the Pavilion Master, you have the highest rank.” The Fifth Elder handed the token to Qin Yu.

After Qin Yu received the token, he couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

This was the first time he knew that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s alchemists were also divided into ranks.

“You can stay in the Divine Alchemist pavilion with peace of mind. I will apply to the Pavilion Master to let you become an Elder,” said the Fifth Elder.

It could be seen that the Fifth Elder attached great importance and affection to Qin Yu. The conditions he gave Qin Yu were also extremely generous.

Of course, the root of all this was because Qin Yu had outstanding abilities.

Through their conversation, Qin Yu learned that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s power was beyond imagination. Their members were spread all over the world.

The directors of many local tertiary rank hospitals were very likely members of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

In other words, as long as one obtained the token of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, they would become a distinguished guest of various hospitals.

“Alright, I’ll bring you to meet the pharmacists of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion now.” Fifth Elder stood up and said.

“Alright.” Qin Yu nodded.

He followed behind Fifth Elder all the way to the lecture hall.

In the lecture hall, many pharmacists had already gathered here and were waiting.

Fifth Elder brought Qin Yu to the front and waited for everyone to gather.

At this moment, the girl in the red dress also walked over.

She glanced at Qin Yu, but her eyes were filled with disdain.

Qin Yu didn’t care much and greeted her with a smile.

After about ten minutes, Fifth Elder saw that almost everyone had arrived, so he coughed.

Everyone immediately quieted down.

Fifth Elder cleared his throat and said, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion has added two new members.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

With that said, Fifth Elder pointed at the girl in the red dress and said, “She is Taozi, an ordinary alchemist.”

Then, Fifth Elder pointed at Qin Yu and said, “He is Qin Yu, an upper-rank alchemist.”

The crowd quickly erupted into thunderous applause. However, at this moment, Taozi shouted, “Why?!”

Fifth Elder frowned slightly and asked in surprise, “What’s wrong?”

Taozi said with a cold expression, “I have green spirit fire, but I’m just an ordinary alchemist. What makes him an upper-rank alchemist? Just because he has a good relationship with you?”

When Fifth Elder heard this, he didn’t know how to react.

“Qin Yu’s ability is above yours, so of course he’s an upper-rank alchemist,” Fifth Elder said helplessly.

Taozi sneered. “Above me? On what basis do you say that?”

Before Fifth Elder could say anything, Qin Yu took a step forward.

He said with a nonchalant smile, “Taozi, right?”

Taozi snorted lightly and turned her face to the side.

Qin Yu continued, “Although your green spiritual fire isn’t bad, it’s worse than mine.”

“Because... I have blue spiritual fire.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s palm suddenly erupted with a flame that flickered with a blue light!
