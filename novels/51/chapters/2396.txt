2397 The Fall of the Holy Son

A thunder dragon shot out as he punched, and in an instant, he reached the peak of speed.

“The speed is good, but not the strength.”

Yao Xi sneered. It was a joke for the strength of seventh grade to break his defense, not to mention he had treasures all over him.

He grabbed Jiu Xioa’s head with one hand, and the next moment, his head exploded like a watermelon.

“Senior Brother Jiu Xiao!”

The faces of Demon-slaying Peak’s disciples who had rushed over turned ashen, and some junior sisters began sobbing.

Jiu Xiao of Demon-slaying Peak had always cared for his junior brothers and sisters. He had even lent the points he had painstakingly accumulated to Qin Yu.

“Yao Xi, my Thunder Courtyard and your Yao family are irreconcilable enemies.”

A beautiful girl dressed in a plain, simple robe came to Yao Xi. Looking at Zhao Wan Er’s corpse, she started to tremble. She was also Flower Granny’s direct disciple, Lu Xue.

“Lei Xin and Flower old lady are held back by the three Holy Lords. I want to see what you trash can do to me! Kill all the people from the five peaks. Since you’ve already made your move, don’t show mercy!”

Yao Xi laughed maniacally. He was originally the person with the most outstanding talent for cultivation in the Yao family.

However, he had fallen from his position as a god ever since he lost to Qin Yu. Subsequently, when he went to purgatory to snatch the Jee family’s treasure, he had also failed. His current status in the family was far way below previously.

Now, even Yao Meng, who came to the Holy Region later, had a higher status than him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Today, in Thunder Courtyard, he finally found the feeling he once had.

“Crack!”

Lu Xue pulled out a fiery red whip, and wherever the whip was wielded, explosions followed.

She walked toward Yao Xi step by step. Although her arm moved slightly, the long whip seemed to have a life of its own as it swam around Yao Xi. It was like a venomous snake that was about to devour Yao Xi.

“It’s refined using the monster realm’s demonic vine. It seems to have its own consciousness. As expected of the Demon-slaying Peak, it’s simply too wasteful for an eighth-grade True Saint to use a tribulation divine artifact!”

Yao Xi’s hands remained unmoved as if he was not nervous at all. He was even commenting on Lu Xue’s weapon.

“Senior Sister Lu Xue, you can do it! Kill this madman!”

A figure stared at him coldly. Qin Yu’s face carried a terrifying killing intent, causing his body to emit a cold aura.

Qin Yu’s body suddenly curled up and transformed into a blood-red spear.

Under Lu Xue’s control, the demonic vine instantly turned into a spear, and the space around the spearhead emitted a terrifying sonic boom.

It then pierced through Yao Xi’s head.

“Great! Senior Sister Lu’s illusion technique was indeed terrifying. So what if he’s the Holy Son of the Yao family? He was still hit!”

Amid the fierce battle surrounding Flower Peak, a roar sounded. However, just a second later, all the sounds came to an abrupt halt.

Suddenly, a figure slowly walked out of Yao Xi’s body. The figure silently walked out while withstanding Lu Xue’s spear of the demonic vine. The scene was tremendously eerie.

The corpse of the Celestial Saint!

Previously, Yao Xi had used this corpse to deal with Qin Yu. It could unleash an extreme attack under the suppression of the Path of Heaven.

This corpse could be considered one of the more powerful tribulation magical artifacts. The spear of the demonic vine could not break through his defense at all.

“Well! Well! You actually made me fall into an illusion!”

Yao Xi’s expression distorted as he thought about how he had fallen into an illusion.

Moreover, it was Qin Yu. This made him even more furious.

“Go to hell!”

The corpse of Celestial Saint jumped up with a destructive internal qi and slapped Lu Xue into a meat paste directly.

The tremendous tremor caused the entire Flower Peak to tremble. The power of this attack had reached the Tribulation First Level!

At this moment, the people of the three families had completely shed all pretense of cordiality because of Yao Xi. They were all fighting crazily.

However, the three families had mobilized almost all elites for this sudden movement. Thus the casualties of Thunder Courtyard were much heavier.

“Boom!”

Yao Xi looked at Yan Ruoxue, surrounded by thunderclouds in the sky. He laughed crazily as he stomped on the air.

He came up to the top of the Flower Peak directly. He raised the fist of the corpse of the Celestial Sain high and punched down fiercely.

“Only I, Yao Xi, am the strongest. Do you want to break through before me? Despicable!”

The most crucial moment for a breakthrough was comprehension. Yao Xi’s punch at this moment was to destroy Yan Ruoxue.

A palm suddenly rested on Yao Xi’s wrist. The strange power of the corpse of Celestial Sain was released and merged with Yao Xi’s.

Qin Yu said indifferently.

Seeing Qin Yu, a hint of fear flashed across Yao Xi’s eyes.

Qin Yu looked at the corpses on the ground. Zhao Wan Er, Lu Xue, Jiu Xiao, Xiaobai…

One familiar person after another. His expression was very calm, so calm that it made Yao Xi feel scared.

“What are you pretending for? There’s no suppression from the Path of Heaven, so I can unleash the full power of the corpse of the Celestial Saint! Go to hell! Celestial Saint as One!”

The corpse of Celestial Saint suddenly entered his body, and a terrifying aura burst out from his body.

The other of his hands stabbed into Qin Yu’s throat like a bolt of lightning, and the sound of metal clashing suddenly exploded.

Yao Xi’s three fingers were broken at the same time, and he let out an immense miserable howl.

The Sound of Lei Ming suddenly sounded eerily.

Qin Yu’s body turned into a massive arc of lightning. In the next moment, he had already grabbed Yao Xi’s neck.

“You’re f*cking courting death!”

Yao Xi’s eyes were red. Qin Yu raised his entire body high up, and an enormous internal qi suddenly erupted from his body.

Five marks appeared on his body. They were actually five talismans. Then they bombarded Qin Yu’s body directly with lightning speed.

The power of the Tribulation Second Level! The power of the talisman suddenly exploded on Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu’s body shook violently, and he felt a sweetness in his throat.

“You’re indeed a Holy Son. The Golden Path of Heaven has just descended, and the Yao family gave you the Tribulation Second Level talisman as soon as the Golden Path of Heaven descended. They really are wealthy and generous!”

Qin Yu said coldly. His expression was very calm, but it caused Yao Xi’s body to emit a cold aura instead.

“You can’t kill me. If I die, the Yao family and Thunder Courtyard will fight to the death. You don’t want to see more people from Thunder Courtyard die, do you?”

When Yao Xi saw Qin Yu’s indifferent gaze looking at him, he instantly felt a chill.

Nine Thunder God’s Thunder Technique!

A bolt of white lightning suddenly struck down, piercing through Yao Xi’s head like a bolt of lightning.

Qin Yu threw the charred corpse on the ground and turned to look at the others.

In an instant, the heads of all the Yao family members buzzed. One of the Yao family elders let out a shrill scream.

“Qin Yu, you dared to kill the Yao family’s Holy Son. Are you crazy?”

Although Yao Xi’s status was not like before, he was still the Holy Son of a great aristocratic family.

They had witnessed the death of a Holy Son at this moment.

Many people’s hearts turned cold as if they had already predicted a great battle to come.
