Chapter 482: The Second Crusade of the Saint Confucian Sect! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As he spoke, the First Elder tried her best to remain calm.

His performance was impeccable.

The First Elder was the Pavilion Master’s most trusted person, so she nodded and picked up the bowl of porridge.

The Pavilion Master’s rosy lips slowly touched the bowl.

The First Elder’s expression immediately became a little nervous.

Only when the Pavilion Master slowly drank the bowl of porridge did the First Elder heave a sigh of relief.

“Lord Pavilion Master, you should rest well.” The First Elder picked up the bowl and bowed.

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything and only nodded.

She was holding a newspaper in her hand, and no one knew what she was reading.

The First Elder didn’t dare to stay any longer. He took the bowl and hurriedly jumped down.

The entire day, the First Elder had been feeling uneasy.

According to Elder Qu, after taking this Spirit Severing Pill, there wouldn’t be any obvious symptoms.

Only when she took action would she realize that the inner strength in her body was depleted.

Therefore, the First Elder didn’t leave.

That night, the First Elder tiptoed out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

He walked to the end of the street and quickly got into a car.

“How is it? Is it done?” Elder Qu asked.

The First Elder nodded and said, “Yes, it’s done.”

Elder Qu raised his eyebrows and said, “Are you lying to us?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Anger flashed across the First Elder’s face.

He said coldly, “Don’t use people you suspect. Use people you don’t suspect. If you don’t believe me, you can treat it as if I never came!”

Xu Beiji hurriedly pulled Elder Qu back and said with a smile, “First Elder, don’t be angry. Don’t lower yourself to his level. We all believe in you.”

The First Elder snorted. He glanced at Xu Beiji and said, “Remember what you promised me.”

Xu Beiji smiled and said, “The Saint Confucian Sect, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and the major families in Jingdu all hope that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion can be in the hands of our own people.”

“You are one of us.”

The First Elder nodded slightly and then got out of the car.

After he left, Xu Beiliu’s expression instantly turned cold.

“We’ll make a move tomorrow! Crusade against the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” Xu Beiliu said coldly.

...

The next morning, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was business as usual.

No one knew that a disaster was quietly approaching.

At noon, the sun shone brightly.

It was supposed to be a leisurely afternoon, but the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had welcomed a group of uninvited guests.

The Pavilion Master lay on the rocking chair and was about to take a lunch break.

At this moment, her eyes suddenly opened.

“Someone is here.” The Pavilion Master frowned slightly.

In the next second, she floated down from the pavilion like a fairy.

In the square of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Elder Qu, Xu Beiliu, and the others were standing in the square while quietly waiting.

“What? Still not giving up?” Seeing these people, the Pavilion Master narrowed his eyes slightly.

Xu Beiliu took the lead and took a step forward while sneering. “Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, if you are willing to surrender now, you might be able to suffer less.”

The Pavilion Master couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. “Just the few of you?”

“Yes, just the few of us!” Xu Beiliu sneered repeatedly.

The internal qi on their bodies suddenly erupted.

The powerful internal qi instantly stirred up gusts of hurricanes!

This was the second time that the Saint Confucian Sect had come to crusade against the Divine Alchemist Pavilion! Compared to the last time, they were clearly more confident.

“Lord Pavilion Master!”

First Elder and Second Elder also hurriedly ran over.

Second Elder glared angrily at this group of people and berated, “You guys really don’t know when to give up. Do you really think that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is easy to bully?!”

“Hahahaha!” Xu Beiliu laughed out loud.

“The Divine Alchemist Pavilion thinks highly of itself and thinks that it’s detached from the outside world and don’t differentiate in terms of status. I have long disliked you guys!” Xu Beiliu shouted sternly!

Light began to encircle his fists!

In a short moment, two dragon heads covered his fists!

This technique was Xu Beiliu’s famous technique, the Azure Flame Dragon Fist!

Back then, Xu Beiliu had relied on this technique to become a high-ranking member of the Saint Confucian Sect!

“Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, I will give you one last chance. Are you going to surrender or not?!” Xu Beiliu shouted.

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “Where’s all this nonsense coming from?”

“Alright!”

Xu Beiliu roared explosively, and the qi energy all over his body suddenly erupted!

After that, Xu Beiliu took the lead and walked over before charging towards the Pavilion Master!

The enormous fist shadow carried waves of dragon roars as it ruthlessly smashed towards the Pavilion Master from a few meters away!

The terrifying fist force even caused waves of strong winds!

The Pavilion Master’s long hair was blown by the fist wind, but there wasn’t the slightest trace of emotion on her face.

“Go to h*ll!”

Xu Beigu roared repeatedly as his fist ruthlessly smashed toward the Pavilion Master!

The Pavilion Master wasn’t flustered at all. Light lingered in her palm as she met the fist head-on!

“Rumble!”

At the instant of the collision, waves of internal qi spread out in all directions with the two of them as the center!

In an instant, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion buzzed non-stop and the buildings collapsed, as if it was a scene of disaster!

Palm against fist, it was a stalemate.

“Huh?”

The Pavilion Master frowned slightly.

She could clearly feel that the internal strength in her body seemed to be much depleted.

Otherwise, this palm would be enough to send Xu Beiji flying!

“You aren’t crippled?” Xu Beiji’s expression changed greatly when he saw this. He subconsciously looked at the First Elder!

For a moment, the atmosphere was a little stiff.

Xu Beiji hurriedly took two steps back and looked coldly at the First Elder.

“As expected of the number one alchemist in the world. Even after taking the Spirit Severing Pill, you’re still able to display such strength.”

At this moment, a voice came from the dark.

They saw He Teng slowly walking over.

“Spirit Severing Pill?” The Pavilion Master frowned slightly.

He Teng sneered. “That’s right! This Spirit Severing Pill is a prescription from hundreds of years ago! As long as you swallow the Spirit Severing Pill, you will become a cripple!”

Speaking up to this point, He Teng paused for a moment, then sighed. “So far, you are the first person who hasn’t been crippled, but... it’s impossible for you not to be affected!”

“If I’m not mistaken, your current strength is less than 50% of your peak stage strength!” He Teng changed the topic and sneered.

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything.

Just as He Teng said, after consuming the Spirit Severing Pill, the Pavilion Master’s strength was indeed affected, and she only had 30% of her peak stage strength!

Otherwise, even if these few people attacked together, they wouldn’t be a match for the Pavilion Master!

“Lord Pavilion Master!” The Second Elder hurriedly walked forward with a somewhat panicked expression.

“Are you alright?” The Second Elder asked anxiously.

Pavilion Master didn’t speak. Her elegant face seemed cold at this moment.

“Lord Pavilion Master, if you are willing to hand over Qin Yu, I might consider handing over the antidote.” At this moment, He Teng suddenly said.
