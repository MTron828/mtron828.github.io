Chapter 282: Surrender or Die Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The four great martial families of Chuzhou were the Wang family, the Li family, the Hua family, and the Luo family.

Over the years, the four great families appeared peaceful on the surface, but in reality, they were fighting amongst each other.

The other small families of Chuzhou had to give them regular offerings.

They collected countless herbs every year.

Qin Yu’s eyes were cold as he whispered, “It’s time to make you guys bleed.”

Then, Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at the Divine Medicine in his hand.

He didn’t refine the pill. Instead, he temporarily put the Divine Medicine into his wristband. This was because the refinement of this Divine Medicine would probably take a very long time.

Moreover, Qin Yu was somewhat dissatisfied with his current strength.

Many high-grade pills required the support of strength.

Therefore, Qin Yu planned to step into the Monastic Stage and then use this medicinal herb.

At that time, Qin Yu could try to refine a divine rank pill.

The next day, the four great martial arts aristocratic families arrived at the Jiang family.

In a pavilion, everyone toasted each other in satisfaction.

“Mr. Jiang, why is Qin Yu looking for us?” Wang Wu of the Wang family asked.

Jiang Gu shook his head and said, “I’m not sure either.”

“Tsk tsk, being called the King of Chuzhou at such a young age is really enviable.” At this moment, someone from the Hua family suddenly said in a sarcastic tone.

Jiang Gu glanced at him and said, “Mr. Qin has the qualifications. Moreover, the title of King of Chuzhou was given to him by other people.”

As he was speaking, Qin Yu walked over from not far away.

When they saw Qin Yu, everyone stood up and greeted Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded slightly as a form of greeting.

He walked into the pavilion, found a seat, and sat down. Then, he looked at the people in front of him.

“Mr. Qin, why are you looking for us?” Wang Wu asked.

Qin Yu took a sip of water. Then, he looked at everyone and said straightforwardly, “I want you all to submit to me.”

As soon as he said this, everyone was shocked!

Wang Wu stood up angrily and said loudly, “Submit to you? Our four big families have been in Chuzhou for many years, but we have never submitted to anyone!”

“That’s right. Even when the Jiang family was at its peak, we have never submitted.”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said indifferently, “That’s because I hadn’t come. Now that I’m here, all of you should submit to me.”

“From today on, I want you all to offer me a stalk of herbs every month for more than fifty years.”

Qin Yu’s overbearing tone immediately aroused the dissatisfaction of the crowd.

Wang Wuleng looked at Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, this is highway robbery! Do you think this is reasonable?”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “You are right. But as far as I know, all the martial arts families in Chuzhou also offer you a stalk of herbs every year, right? Even some herbs merchants have to sell you guys herbs at a low price. Do you consider that as highway robbery?”

“That’s what they should do.” Wang Wu snorted.

Luo Zhan of the Luo family also said indifferently, “It’s just the law of the jungle. They’re not strong enough, so they deserve to be robbed.”

When he heard that, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “Yeah, in my eyes, aren’t you guys the same?”

“If all of you bully others, I can also bully all of you.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

When they heard this, the four of them couldn’t sit still anymore!

They slammed the table and stood up, shouting angrily, “Qin Yu, don’t go too far! Although our four families can not be considered as top aristocratic families, you’re definitely not qualified to humiliate us!”

Wang Wu said coldly, “I’m sorry, we won’t accept your condition.”

Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd coldly and said, “Do you think I’m discussing this with you? I’m informing you.”

“Today, I’ll only give you two choices. Either you submit to me or you die here.”

Everyone’s expressions changed. Wang Wu took large strides towards Qin Yu and berated, “Qin Yu, you’re going too far!”

Qin Yu immediately waved his large hand and slammed his palm towards Wang Wu!

With a crisp sound, Wang Wu was sent flying! He spewed out a mouthful of blood!

“You guys have to agree no matter what,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Seeing Wang Wu lying on the ground and not being able to get up, the few of them had ugly expressions on their faces.

“Mr. Qin, can you give us some time to think about it?” Luo Zhan braced himself and asked.

“No.” Qin Yu was extremely overbearing and didn’t give them any chance at all.

“Hehe, Qin Yu, do you know that the Hua family used to be a prestigious family in the Jiang Bei region?” At this moment, Hua Jie suddenly asked.

“So?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

Hua Jie said indifferently, “Jing Lu used to be a friend of the Hua family. My son, Hua Liyu, is also known as a genius!”

“Yes, Jing Lu once knelt down and begged for mercy in front of me,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

When Hua Jie heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “You’re bragging! Jing Lu is a genius of the Jiang Bei region. How can he beg for mercy from you?”

“I testify that what Mr. Qin said is true,” Jiang Gu said in a deep voice.

Hua Jie cursed loudly, “Jiang Gu, you and Qin Yu are in cahoots with each other. Do you think I’ll believe your words?”

Jiang Gu’s expression turned cold. He suddenly reached out and grabbed Hua Jie’s neck!

“Who gave you the courage to challenge me?” Jiang Gu said coldly.

He gradually exerted strength in his hand, and Hua Jie’s face instantly turned red!

“Jiang Gu... F * ck you!” Hua Jie gritted his teeth and spat out these words.

“You’re too big for your britches!” Jiang Gu suddenly exerted strength in his hand, and Hua Jie’s neck was broken on the spot!

The faces of the few people present instantly turned ashen, and they were extremely frightened.

“I’ll only give you one minute to consider,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

The few people looked at each other. Wang Wu was the first to clench his teeth and say, “Mr. Qin, I... I’m willing to submit!”

Qin Yu nodded with satisfaction and said, “What about you?”

The others also agreed, “We’re also willing to submit!”

Qin Yu nodded in satisfaction. He slowly stood up and swept his gaze over the crowd while saying, “I won’t take your herbs for free.”

After saying that, Qin Yu extended his palm, and three Foundation Establishment pills fell into his palm.

“This pill is called the Foundation Establishment Pill. After being swallowed, it can cause a small increase in the stage of your strength.” Qin Yu flicked his finger, and the three pills fell into the hands of the few of them.

After receiving the pill, they quickly cupped their hands and said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin!”

Qin Yu glanced at everyone and said, “I hope that you guys can send the herbs to me tomorrow.”

After saying this, Qin Yu was ready to get up and leave.

“The King of Chuzhou is really overbearing.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from not far away.

After turning around, he saw an old man slowly walking over with his hands behind his back.
