1827 Devouring the Huangji Buddha Flame

In a cave abode of Thunder Courtyard, a cauldron was placed in front of Qin Yu.

A rich medicinal fragrance was emitting from within the cauldron. A ball of purple spiritual fire was throbbing slightly.

Although Jue Wu said that she didn’t need any elixir, Qin Yu still made several pills for her.

After refining the pill, Qin Yu handed it to Jue Wu.

Jue Wu took the pill and muttered, ” I already said I don’t need it. I’ll be fine after resting for a while…”

Qin Yu sighed slightly and said, “Just make me feel less guilty.”

Seeing this, Jue Wu didn’t say anything else. She stuffed the pill into her mouth and swallowed it.

The two men were extremely powerful. They were at least in the Advanced-stage of the Reversion Void.

Jue Wu alone fought against two persons. Not only did she win, but she also killed one of them. This battle record was enough for her to stand proudly in the entire Holy Region.

“After this, it’s time for me to go for closed-door cultivation,” Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and said.

“No problem. Leave it to me if there’s anything,” Jue Wu nodded and said.

Qin Yu’s desire for strength had reached its peak.

He didn’t want to hide behind others for everything anymore, and he didn’t want others to be implicated because of him.

It would take at least a year to devour the Huangji Buddha Flame.

It also meant that Qin Yu could not participate in any missions for one year.

This was not in line with the rules of Demon-slaying Peak. If one did not participate in the mission for a month, they would be automatically expelled from Demon-slaying Peak.

Therefore, before he went for seclusion, Qin Yu had to look for the peak master for a discussion.

In the cave abode of the peak master, Qin Yu expressed his intention.

After hearing from Qin Yu, the peak master could not help but laugh. He said, “Demon-slaying Peak does have this rule. That’s why many people in Demon-slaying Peak suppress their cultivation realm and try to break through in one go.”

“Why?” Qin Yu looked at the peak Master and asked.

The peak master explained, “Entering Demon-slaying Peak means one has chosen the cultivation technique, not a realm. Therefore, over the years, the people of Demon-slaying Peak have been replaced by new ones. After accumulating enough cultivation techniques, many people will leave Demon-slaying Peak and go to other main peaks.

“In other words, the current Demon-slaying Peak is like a springboard in Thunder Courtyard. Once you go to the other main peaks from Demon-slaying Peak, you must be one of the best in the main peak.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu instantly came to a realization.

After they had obtained enough points, they would choose to exchange for cultivation techniques.

Bringing these powerful cultivation techniques along, they would choose another main peak and seclude themselves to break through. Once they broke through, not only would they have a new realm, but they would also have the powerful cultivation techniques of Thunder Courtyard.

“Moreover, to Thunder Courtyard, there’s not much meaning in seclusion. Listening to the Immortal Emperor’s dao lecture is much more meaningful than seclusion,” the master continued.

“That’s true,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice. “However, I have a treasure that I need to devour, so I have no choice but to go into closed-door seclusion.”

In a year, no one could step into the Reversion Void Stage from the Mighty Realm, even if listening to the dao lecture of the Immortal Emperor.

However, devouring the Huangji Buddha Flame was a different story.

“Peak Master, do you have any way for me to go into closed-door seclusion for a year?” Qin Yu asked.

“Normally, you should choose another main peak,” the peak master said in a deep voice. “But you might be different. Maybe the dean will give you a leeway.”

“A leeway?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“Why?” he asked, feeling puzzled. “Was there a precedent?”

“Of course not,” the peak master shook his head.

“Then why do you think the dean will give me a leeway?” Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

Although Qin Yu was exceptionally talented, there were many geniuses in the entire Thunder Courtyard. Qin Yu did not think that he could defeat them.

“Cultivating at the immortal graveyard is something that has never happened in the history of Thunder Courtyard. But didn’t the dean agree to it?” the peak master said meaningfully.

Qin Yu was stunned, and he was even more confused instantly.

Why did the dean treat him so well? It didn’t make sense.

“Let’s go and ask the dean,” the peak master got up and said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. He then bade goodbye to Jue Wu and followed the peak master to the first main peak.

As soon as he obtained the dean’s permission, Qin Yu planned to go into closed-door seclusion directly.

After leaving the Demon-slaying Peak, the two of them rushed to the first main peak.

At this time, the peak master suddenly frowned.

He subconsciously looked in a specific direction outside Thunder Courtyard.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked.

The peak master said in a deep voice, “I seem to have sensed a powerful internal qi, and even… a wisp of Holy Power.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu instantly felt uneasy.

He immediately activated his desolate divine eye and looked in that direction.

With his desolate divine eye, Qin Yu saw a familiar figure.

It was the young master of the Tong family, Tong Guangqing!

Two other people were following him!

“It’s him indeed…” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly.

He knew the Tong family would not let the matter rest so easily, but he did not expect it to come so soon!

“It seems my guess is right,” Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said in a low voice.

The Tong family was so anxious. Qin Yu must have been right!

“Why? do you know them?” the peak master asked.

“Yes, they’re from the Tong family,” Qin Yu said.

“The group of people who injured Jue Wu?” the peak master frowned.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “I’m afraid they’re here with Saint Weapons.”

“It seems there’s a deep grudge between you two,” the peak master said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu didn’t explain. He didn’t want to tell anyone about the token and the Forbidden Zone at this point.

“But don’t worry, no one would dare to step into Thunder Courtyard,” the peak master said.

Soon, Qin Yu and the peak master arrived at the first main peak.

This time, the two of them arrived at the dean’s house easily.

“Dean, I…

“It’s me who let Qin Yu in.”

Before the peak master could finish speaking, the dean’s voice came from inside.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any time. He quickly walked in.

The moment he entered, the door closed instantly.

The house on the first main peak began to glow, separating the peak master and the house.

Inside the house, Qin Yu stood opposite the dean, bowed slightly, and then expressed his intention.

“I need to go into closed-door seclusion for at least a year. I hope to keep my identity as a Demon Hunter,” Qin Yu said.

“Why do you need to go into seclusion for a year?” the dean asked indifferently.

“I need to devour the Huangji Buddha Flame,” Qin Yu flipped his palm and took out the Huangji Buddha Flame directly.

The dean was a bit surprised. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Is this the Huangji Buddha Flame that appeared in Nanzhou a few years ago?”

“Yes, it is.” Qin Yu nodded.

“I didn’t expect such a supreme treasure to fall into your hands,” the dean said with emotion.

After that, the dean looked at Qin Yu and said, “Alright. You have my consent.”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
