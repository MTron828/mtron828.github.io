The two men looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “What is that thing in your hand? It clearly belongs to that Tomb Raider! If you don’t know him, how could it be in your hand!”

Qin Yu looked at the loudspeaker in his hand and felt a bad feeling in his heart.

“This… He ran away in a hurry just now. Before I could give it to him, it was already in my hand,”Qin Yu braced himself and said.

“If you don’t know him, why would he give it to you!”The two people said angrily.

Qin Yu opened his mouth, not knowing how to explain for a moment.

“Come back with us. You must be his accomplice!”The two people shouted, and the internal Qi on their bodies immediately exploded!

Such a terrifying internal Qi made Qin Yu immediately feel a strong pressure!

The strength of these two people was unfathomable. They probably came from a large family!

But even so, Qin Yu absolutely could not go back with them.

Man with the mustache had committed some heinous crimes. If he went back with them, he would most likely die!

Qin Yu quietly mobilized the internal Qi in his body, planning to find an opportunity to escape.

But he was shocked to find that the surrounding space seemed to have collapsed. There was no way to escape!

“Come with us. You’ll suffer less.”The two of them walked towards Qin Yu step by step.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and cursed the man with the mustache in his heart. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He said coldly, “I told you, I don’t know him at all!”

“Whether you know him or not, you’ll know when you go back with us.”They raised their palms and grabbed Qin Yu’s arms!

Golden Light burst out from Qin Yu’s body. Rays of light burst out from his body and his clothes were instantly shattered!

Just as Qin Yu was about to fight to the death, one of them suddenly shouted, “Wait!”

“What’s Wrong?”The other person asked.

That person glanced at Qin Yu’s chest and then leaned on the other person’s ear, saying something unknown.

The gazes of the two people inadvertently glanced at Qin Yu’s chest.

“It was a misunderstanding. I’m sorry.”The attitude of the two people suddenly changed drastically, cupping their hands toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was stunned, and he could not help but lower his head to look at his chest.

He saw a jade pendant hanging on his chest. The jade pendant was sparkling, and the dark green color was extremely ancient and unadorned under the sunlight.

At this moment, Qin Yu instantly understood.

These two people were probably from the central plains and recognized the relationship between this jade pendant and the Yan family.

Qin Yu simply used the tiger skin as a banner and said indifferently, “Sigh, I originally wanted to hide my identity, but I didn’t expect that I would still be discovered by you.”

Hearing this, the two people immediately became even more flustered.

They hurriedly said, “I’m really sorry. We were blind just now and offended young master. Young Master, Please Be Magnanimous and forgive us this time…”

Qin Yu coughed dryly and then asked, “What exactly did that man with the Mustache Do to you?”

At the mention of Man with the mustache, the faces of the two people turned somewhat ugly.

“That bastard. He stole one of our scrolls. That scroll is extremely important to us,”the two people gnashed their teeth and said.

“If we catch him, we’ll definitely tear him into pieces!”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “I don’t know him.”

“Young master, you must be joking. You look like a talented person. How could you know that kind of trash?”The two of them hurriedly said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “I like to hear that.”

“Since you’ve already recognized my identity, then I’m not afraid to tell you that my relationship with Yan Ruoxue is extremely good,”Qin Yu said rather proudly.

“Third Princess?”The two of them were stunned, and then their expressions became even more respectful.

Qin Yu thought to himself, “Third princess? It seems that the Yan family has quite a number of princesses.”

Then, Qin Yu took the opportunity to inquire about the news, “Sigh, I’ve been out on business for a long time under the orders of the Yan family. Speaking of which, I really miss it. has there been any news about the Yan family recently?”

The two of them looked at each other and said, “As one of the nine great aristocratic families, the Yan family has always been active in the eyes of everyone. However, if you want to talk about major matters, it seems that there hasn’t been any recently.”

Qin Yu continued to ask, “Then, is there any news about the third princess?”

“Young master isn’t interested in the third princess, right?”One of them laughed.

“Don’t talk nonsense. who dares to have designs on the third princess?”The other person hurriedly said.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “What’s wrong with the third princess? Don’t hide it. Tell us the truth.”

The two people looked at each other and then said with a wry smile, “Young Master, we really don’t know…”

“How dare you! If you don’t tell us the truth, don’t blame me for being impolite!”Qin Yu shouted angrily.

Seeing Qin Yu getting angry, the two of them could only sigh and said, “As far as we know, the third princess seems to have married someone and will be married a few years later.”

“What? !”Qin Yu’s face changed greatly. He subconsciously grabbed his arm and said anxiously, “Married? Who Did she marry? Was it her own initiative or forced? Who Did you hear it from?”

Seeing Qin Yu so agitated, the two of them seemed a little strange.

“You’re not really interested in the third princess, are you?”They asked doubtfully.

Only then did Qin Yu realize that he had lost his composure. He took a deep breath and said, “Of course not. I just admire the third princess.”

“Cut the crap. Quickly tell us what’s going on.”Qin Yu asked with a dark face.

“We don’t know the details either, but we heard that the third princess and the chaotic body are a match made in heaven, and it just so happens that there’s a young master of an aristocratic family in the central plains who is a chaotic body.”They muttered.

“Rumor has it that merging with the chaotic body is beneficial to both sides.”

“Yeah, the two of them are both sons of great aristocratic families. They are really a good match, making others envious.”

Hearing their conversation, Qin Yu’s face could not help but turn green. He gritted his teeth and said, “Well-matched with you? What bullshit chaotic body? It must be the Yan family who made the decision on their own, for some so-called cultivation!”

“These B * stards, even if they are in the holy region, they are still the same. They don’t care about personal wishes at all. F * ck!”

Qin Yu clenched his teeth, and he was beyond furious.

Before the two of them were shocked, Qin Yu continued to ask, “When are they getting married? Have you heard of it?”

The two of them thought for a moment and said, “It seems like they are waiting for a big day. Rumor has it that that day is the day of the Heavenly Dao.”

“How long is the day of the Heavenly Dao?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

“It’s hard to say. It could be two to three years, or four to five years at most.”The two of them speculated.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly, and he did not speak for a long time.

He did not expect that there was another chaotic body in this world! And it grew up in a great aristocratic family!

To Qin Yu, this was definitely not good news!

“Can we leave now?”The two asked.
