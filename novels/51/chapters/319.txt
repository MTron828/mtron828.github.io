Yan Ruoxue’s words stunned Qin Yu.

Yan Yunheng said embarrassedly, “Ruoxue, I haven’t finished acting yet...”

“What? If you don’t stop, I’ll get angry.” Yan Ruoxue frowned and pretended to be angry.

Yan Yunheng didn’t know how to react. He waved his hand and the internal qi around him disappeared instantly.

Qin Yu’s body instantly returned to normal.

“This... This Iis?” Qin Yu was confused for a moment.

Yan Yunheng said with a bitter smile, “If I don’t stop, my granddaughter will probably pull my beard off.”

Qin Yu, looking extremely puzzled, scratched his head.

What was going on? Why did Old Mister Yan seem like a different person in the blink of an eye?

“My Grandfather wanted to test you,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Yan Yunheng said with a nonchalant smile, “Your performance wasn’t bad. You didn’t disappoint me.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. He scratched his head and said, “To be honest, I was a little scared just now...”

“Your performance was already very good.” Yan Ruoxue gently patted Qin Yu’s head.

“Alright, if there’s nothing else, come and play a game of chess with me,” Yan Yunheng said with a smile.

Updates by

At this moment, Yan Yunheng seemed to have changed from a big shot who looked down on the world to a genial old man.

“okay.” Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and agreed.

“You guys play chess first. I’ll go to the kitchen to help cook,” Yan Ruoxue said.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but say in surprise, “You... want to cook?”

“Ever since she came back from Jiangcheng, she has been learning to cook painstakingly,” Yan Yunheng said with a smile.

Yan Ruoxue said shyly, “Don’t talk nonsense!”

After saying this, Yan Ruoxue quickly ran away.

Qin Yu immediately set up the chess board and played chess with Old Mister Yan.

It was said that one’s chess moves was reflective of one’s life. It had to be said that Old Mister Yan’s view of the big picture was beyond imagination.

In almost every chess game, Qin Yu lost. He didn’t know how to make a move many times.

After three games, Qin Yu didn’t win a single game.

“Hahahaha!” Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

He said somewhat proudly, “Qin Yu, your go skills aren’t good. You’re no match for me.”

Seeing Old Mister Yan’s comical expression, Qin Yu didn’t know how to react.

He even began to doubt whether the legends of Old Mister Yan in Jingdu were true.

“Cough cough!”

At this moment, Old Mister Yan suddenly began to cough violently.

Along with a few coughs, a few more traces of blood couldn’t help but appear on Old Mister Yan’s palm.

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed. He hurriedly asked, “Old Mister Yan, Are you alright?”

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “What could be wrong with me? I’m old, it’s normal for me to have some minor illnesses.”

Minor illnesses?

Qin Yu wasn’t so optimistic. He couldn’t help but recall what Han Wei had said.

Then, Qin Yu activated his medical skills and looked at Old Mister Yan.

Sure enough, there was black energy between Old Mister Yan’s eyebrows.

Although this black energy wasn’t obvious, it was indeed the aura of death.

“Old Mister Yan, shouldn’t you... go to the hospital to have a check?” Qin Yu’s voice carried some worry.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “I said, I’m fine.”

The more Old Mister Yan didn’t care, the more anxious Qin Yu became.

He hesitated for a moment, then stood up and said, “Old Mister Yan, I have something I don’t know if I should say.”

Old Mister Yan waved his hand to indicating that he didn’t care.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Old Mister Yan, you’d better go to the hospital to have a check. Han Wei once told me that he said...”

“What did he say?” Old Mister Yan said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t know what to say for a moment. He stood there at a loss.

“He said that I have less than a year to live, right?” Old Mister Yan said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu was stunned and said with a wry smile, “You know about it?”

Old Mister Yan put down the chess piece in his hand and said slowly, “Even he knows about it. How can I not know about my physical condition?”

“Then... then haven’t you thought of any solutions? For example, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, for example...” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and interrupted Qin Yu’s words.

He said with a courageous tone, “There are some things that you can not control, such as life and death.”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly, and he was even more puzzled deep down.

Why wouldn’t Old Mister Yan go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, which claimed to be able to treat any illness?

Or perhaps, he could also try to treat Old Mister Yan’s illness.

“There’s no need to say anything more. Let’s end this topic,” said Old Mister Yan.

Qin Yu was unwilling to. He probed, “Old Mister Yan, does Ruoxue know about this matter?”

Old Mister Yan immediately shook his head and sighed. “It’s better not to let her know about this matter for the time being.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a sense of heartache.

Old Mister Yan really doted on Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to imagine how much anguish Yan Ruoxue would feel if she knew about this matter.

“Old Master, it’s time to go down and eat.” At this moment, a servant came up and said.

Old Mister Yan laughed and said, “Qin Yu, let’s go. Come and have a drink with me tonight.”

Qin Yu nodded with worry. He followed behind Old Mister Yan and headed downstairs.

It was only five o’clock in the afternoon, and the Yan family’s men had yet to return.

The table was already filled with a dazzling array of dishes. The degree of extravagance was beyond imagination.

Not long after, Yan Ruoxue came with a dish.

This dish was obviously meticulously made. Although it just had a simple ingredient, it was placed extremely exquisitely.

Yan Ruoxue placed the dish in front of Qin Yu and said with some anticipation, “Quick, try it. I made it myself!”

“This is made for you alone,” Old Mister Yan teased from the side.

“Grandpa!” Yan Ruoxue was instantly a little vexed.

Old Mister Yan forced a smile and said, “Alright. I won’t say anything anymore.”

Qin Yu picked up the chopsticks and took a bite before putting it into his mouth.

“How is it?” Yan Ruoxue asked expectantly.

Qin Yu praised, “Super delicious!”

“Really?!” Yan Ruoxue was so excited that she almost jumped up!

“Really!” Qin Yu picked up his chopsticks and stuffed them into his mouth.

This made Yan Ruoxue feel quite satisfied. She whispered, “I’ll cook something else for you in the future.”

Amidst this warm scene, a middle-aged man suddenly walked in from outside.

Upon seeing this middle-aged man, Yan Ruoxue stood up and called him Uncle.

Upon hearing this address, Qin Yu hurriedly raised his head and looked at this man.

He had a strong figure, a cold expression, and a ruthless air.

“He’s Yan Sihai?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Yan Jiang had said that besides Old Mister Yan, Yan Sihai was the person with the most power in the Yan family.
