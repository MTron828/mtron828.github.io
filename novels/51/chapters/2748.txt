After Gu Ying died, Qin Yu felt the terrifying gravity disappear.

He leaped into the air a few times using Ling Bo.

The lava covered his skin, melting almost half of his body and head.

This was lava from the depths of the earth which had even developed intelligence.

Even Qin Yu’s holy body could not withstand the extreme heat.

The Night Qi pervaded the air. In the next moment, Qin Yu transferred this power into the passageway.

Qin Yu slowly extended his palm and pressed it against the black figure.

The Hell Nightmare slowly disappeared and turned into Night Qi that swam within Qin Yu’s body.

“What a terrifying move!”

He didn’t expect to achieve such a result the first time he used Hell Nightmare.

However, this also had something to do with people. Gu Ying had a deep plan, but he chose to retreat when faced with the possibility of obtaining greater power from the Tomb of Heavenly Sins.

Thus, his will was probably not strong enough, but the activation of the Heart of Saint Kingdom required the support of all his will.

He had already discovered this when he used the Heart of Saint Kingdom. Under the effect of the Ruler’s Power, he was almost invincible.

If it wasn’t for the Hell Nightmare that made him lose focus for a moment, the Nine Heavens Holy Sword wouldn’t have been able to hit him.

Qin Yu picked up the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom on the ground. This diamond-shaped gem formed from nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom instantly rippled with terrifying power in his hand.

An unsought fortune! He would be even more confident when he entered the Tomb of Heavenly Sins!

Qin Yu clenched his fists and placed his hand on the wall of the divine hall.

The next moment, he felt as if the wall in front of him had turned into a passage and a strong gravitational force sucked him in.

He could not resist this power at all. Fortunately, it did not harm him.

Qin Yu suddenly fell into a pitch-black space.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt a burning pain in his chest. The gravestone mark on his chest seemed to have sensed the Tomb of Heavenly Sins and was

“Suppress!”

Qin Yu forcefully suppressed this power with his holy energy.

However, he was surprised to find out that this place seemed to have formed its own space. Even his strength was suppressed.

This was a divine hall that looked like a plain. There were countless god statues on the walls.

These god statues were lifelike, and Qin Yu could sense a powerful internal qi from them.

Moreover, it was currently filled with a dense blood mist. Even the Nine

Heavens Manifestations Gaze could only see a few dozen meters away.

However, this fog was sometimes thick and sometimes thin.

Therefore, Qin Yu took advantage of the gap to see the entire interior of the divine hall.

At this moment, there was already a wave of bloody smell in the air. It seemed that all the people with the second mark had been teleported here.

Moreover, he could feel a strong internal qi fluctuation. However, the strange thing was that this place seemed to be silent. Qin Yu could not hear any sound. Even if there was a battle very close to here, Qin Yu could not hear anything.

There wasn’t even the sound of air flowing here.

Suddenly, goosebumps appeared on Qin Yu’s arm.

A huge thunder hammer suddenly pierced through the space. Qin Yu subconsciously raised his arm to block it.

A strong silver light immediately spread out and countless cracks appeared on his arm.

Then, it exploded. This force was so powerful!

Qin Yu’s arm was directly smashed into minced meat.

The Night Qi wrapped around his arm. His arm slowly recovered.

Qin Yu felt a chill run down his spine. He changed his position several times using Ling Bo.

However, it was useless.

A long saber came from his back again when he almost landed. There was no aura fluctuation and no details that could be detected.

The long blade appeared quietly as if it were the oxygen in the air.

“Burning Wood! ”

Qin Yu’s Tiger Wing blocked in front of him.

After a few consecutive slashes, the air in front of him exploded and a sea of fire erupted in front of him.

Following this force, Qin Yu retreated frantically.

The Night Qi was his greatest trump card, so he could not use it without restraint.

Furthermore, Qin Yu discovered that there seemed to be some kind of power suppressing the power of the Dao of Dreams in this space.

When he used the Night Qi just now, the consumption was a lot.

His arm trembled slightly as he blocked the attack of the long saber. At this moment, his arm was almost numb.

“What a terrifying power! What the he*l are these divine general statues?”

As Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze spun, he discovered these statues seemed to be alive.

However, there was no energy transmission in their bodies. It was impossible to know how it could erupt with such terrifying power.

In addition, there was a strange fluctuation of order in this place, so it was impossible to detect their attacks.

In an instant, Qin Yu fell into a predicament. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The four statues behind Qin Yu suddenly revealed strange smiles.

The four divine generals had already appeared behind Qin Yu silently. The weapons had entered Qin Yu’s body before he realized that the four statues had appeared behind him.

“F*ck! Do you think I’m easy to bully?”

The Night Qi transferred the damage to the passageway.

Qin Yu poured holy energy into the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom.

Suddenly, a violent power erupted.

The power of the nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom instantly erupted.

Qin Yu squeezed all his Saint Power into his heart. The next moment, his heart started beating violently.

Vast Qi of Milky Way!

Intense silver holy energy burst out. Qin Yu held the Boundless in his hand. A silver light suddenly burst out from under his feet and he smashed the nearest statue.

Then, he punched the Heart of Saint Kingdom with holy energy. A strong silver light exploded.

The three divine generals in front of him were instantly turned into countless crushed stones.

The fog gradually became thinner.

In Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, nearly ten divine generals were already less than three meters away from him.

“F*ck! ”

Qin Yu was scared out of his wits. How many divine generals were there?

He bent his legs slightly and a violent power instantly erupted.

He suddenly flew deeper. There was only a straight and huge passage here. It should not be wrong to go forward!

“Boundless, Ruler!”

Qin Yu did not dare to slack off at all. He erupted with the power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom.

Now, he could finally sense the signs of these divine generals attacking him. With the support of the Ruler’s Power, he successfully avoided the pursuit of countless divine generals.

In the end, they stayed in an open space without fog. There were already many people here.

However, most of them were in a sorry state. They seemed to have suffered a lot at the hands of the divine generals.

“Qin Yu, over here!”

A joyful voice entered Qin Yu’s ears. It was Cang Yunzi and the rest.

“Taoist priest.”

Qin Yu wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and walked towards them..
