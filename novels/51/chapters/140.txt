Chapter 141: You Have to Change Your Bad Temper Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Commander Guo didn’t comment on this, but he still waved his hand and said, “Don’t doubt my decision.”

Xiao Yu didn’t say anything. He was Commander Guo’s favorite soldier, so he disobeyed orders very often.

Time passed by minute by minute, and the two of them stood there waiting.

Finally, an Audi drove over slowly.

As soon as the car stopped, a young man walked out.

Seeing this, the two of them quickly walked in Qin Yu’s direction.

Qin Yu looked at the two unfamiliar faces in surprise and couldn’t help but be a little vigilant.

“You two are?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Before Commander Guo said anything, Xiao Yu took a step forward and said, “You are Qin Yu. We are from the Chuzhou Region.”

“Chuzhou Region?” Qin Yu was even more confused.

“I don’t seem to have anything to do with you guys.”

Xiao Yu was about to say something when Commander Guo smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, don’t misunderstand. We are here to specially invite you to attend the banquet under the orders of our superiors.”

“Banquet?” Qin Yu suddenly remembered the banquet that Su Bo mentioned.

Rumor had it that this banquet was specially designed to invite a young man, and that young man was actually himself?

“Is there no one at home? Why don’t you guys go in?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

Xiao Yu said with some displeasure, “You actually have the nerve to say that? We’ve been waiting here for several hours. Not to mention people, but there’s not even a bird.”

Qin Yu hurriedly walked to the door, and sure enough, the door was locked.

“Yao Qing isn’t home?” Qin Yu muttered as he opened the door.

“Officers, please come in,” Qin Yu said politely.

Commander Guo nodded and immediately followed behind Qin Yu.

Looking at the huge yard and the magnificent villa, Xiao Yu couldn’t help but say enviously, “To live in such a good place, you must be from a rich family.”

“Xiao Yu, don’t talk nonsense!” Commander Guo scolded.

Xiao Yu immediately kept quiet, but his expression showed that he still felt defiant.

Qin Yu went to make a pot of tea and poured it for the two of them. Then, he asked, “If you have something to say, just say it.”

Commander Guo smiled and said, “It’s like this. Under the orders of the Deputy Chief, we would like to invite you to take up a post in the Chuzhou Region.”

“Take up a post?” Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of water.

He shook his head and smiled. “Don’t joke around. What kind of capabilities do I have to be able to take up a post in the Chuzhou Region?”

“Yeah, I think so too. You even made our Deputy Chief personally invite you,” Xiao Yu snorted.

Qin Yu glanced at him and didn’t argue.

“We aren’t sure about that either. In short, it was an order from the higher-ups,” Commander Guo said politely.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and then said, “Could it be Chief Wu’s idea?”

Commander Guo was stunned and couldn’t help but forced a smile. “It seems that you know about it.”

“Of course he knows. It’s obviously nepotism!” Xiao Yu snorted lightly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He didn’t quite understand Xiao Yu’s hostility towards him.

“I don’t think we know each other.” Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and frowned. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I don’t know you. I’ve never heard of you.” Xiao Yu said in an unfriendly tone.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Then why do you keep going against me?”

Just as Xiao Yu was about to speak, Commander Guo scolded him, “Xiao Yu, don’t be rude!”

“Hmph.” Xiao Yu scowled and was obviously very unhappy.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “If you have something to say, just say it. I won’t fuss over it.”

With Qin Yu’s words, Xiao Yu suddenly had confidence.

He stood up and said, “Although I, Yu Jin, am not a person of high status, I look down on you rich kids who came to our military district just to have some fun!”

“Do you know what the Military District is? It’s a place for national defense, not a place for you rich kids to go and have fun!”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He approved of Yu Jin’s words.

“I agree with what you said, but unfortunately, I come from a humble family and have been poor since childhood. I’m not some rich kid.” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Yu Jin snorted coldly and said, “If you weren’t a son of a rich family, would you live in such a lavish place?”

“If you weren’t a son of a rich family, would Chief Wu have sent a Deputy Chief to invite you?”

“How can a nobody enjoy such treatment?”

Commander Guo remained silent. Obviously, he was also puzzled.

Qin Yu put down the teacup in his hand and said, “That’s not my fault. You should go back and ask Mr. Wu.”

“As for the treatment you mentioned... I’m actually not too sure either. I have the same doubts as you.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Yu Jin sneered and said, “Stop pretending. Let me give you a piece of advice. If you don’t have any real talent, don’t go to the Chuzhou Region to defile us!”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, I won’t go.”

“Humph, he is indeed a useless piece of trash. Commander Guo, we can go now.” Yu Jin snorted coldly.

When he heard Yu Jin’s words, Qin Yu’s expression finally turned cold.

He looked at Yu Jin and said coldly, “Stop.”

Yu Jin paused, turned around, and said, “What? Do you have something else?”

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “I don’t know you, but you have insulted me many times. Why? Is this the privilege of people of the Chuzhou Region?”

“Mr. Qin, Yu Jin has a bad temper. You must not lower yourself to his level,” Commander Guo explained.

Qin Yu looked at Yu Jin and said coldly, “If you have a big temper, you have to change it. Otherwise, you will suffer because of it sooner or later.”

“Suffer? I dare you to let me suffer!” Yu Jin suddenly stood up, and the internal qi on his body instantly reached its peak!

“Inner Strength Master Hands?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “Come on, let me, a good-for-nothing, change your temper.”

“That’s exactly what I want!” Yu Jin roared and quickly clenched his fist as he rushed toward Qin Yu!

He pushed his internal qi to the maximum. It was obvious that he wanted to show Qin Yu his might!

However, Qin Yu didn’t move at all. He didn’t even look at Yu Jin and simply waved his hand.

A terrifying force surged towards him like a landslide!

When he felt this force, Yu Jin’s expression changed drastically! However, it was too late!

This huge force was so terrifying that Yu Jin felt as if he had been hit by a train. His entire body was sent flying!
