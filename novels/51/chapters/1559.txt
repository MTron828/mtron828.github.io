Chapter 1560: Chapter 1,560, Xiao Hai’s painstaking efforts 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu had never liked owing others favors. Even though he had accepted many people’s help unconsciously, he still remembered all of this help in his heart.

After bringing these materials, Qin Yu planned to leave Gu City and return to set up the Dragon Protection Formation.

However, just as he was about to leave, he accidentally heard another piece of news:

The three madmen, Baro and Feng Hai, had also joined the northern lands.

Upon hearing this news, Qin Yu’s expression could not help but darken, but he was not surprised.

According to the news from the Heavenly Blood Rainbow, the northern lands had indeed obtained the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect.

As a large sect that was once the number one sect in the world, their spells were countless. It was not strange at all for Baro and Feng Hai to join the northern lands in pursuit of strength.

The people around were discussing animatedly. They seemed to be filled with worry about the southern region.

“Two of the three maniacs have already joined the northern lands. There’s only one ultimate dance left.”

“Sigh, perhaps before long, ultimate dance will also join the northern lands. At that time, the southern region will really be finished.”

When Qin Yu heard this, he could not help but say with a dark face, “It’s impossible for ultimate dance to join the northern lands. Don’t make wild guesses.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s voice, everyone immediately looked at Qin Yu.

Looking at Qin Yu in front of them, they seemed to have recognized Qin Yu’s identity.

......

“Are You Qin Yu?”Someone took the lead to ask.

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and only nodded.

After receiving Qin Yu’s acknowledgment, this group of people quickly surrounded him.

They cupped their hands to Qin Yu and said with some pleading, “Mr. Qin, please resist the northern lands.”

“That’s right. If even you join the northern lands, our southern region will really be finished...”

Qin Yu looked at everyone in surprise and said in confusion, “Even if the northern lands really entered the southern region, you can still choose to leave the southern region. Why are you so worried?”

When everyone heard this, they could not help but sigh and say, “That’s right. To you powerful people, you can indeed leave the southern region at any time. But what about us? With our cultivation, when will we ever be able to leave the Southern Region?”

“That’s right. We can only place our hopes on you. To us, the better the South Province is, the more chance we have to struggle.”

At this moment, Qin Yu came to a sudden realization.

He suddenly understood Xiao Hai’s good intentions.

With Xiao Hai’s ability, he was able to go to the Central Province. However, he did not make such a choice. Instead, he stayed in the South Province and fought for the South Province.

Back then, Qin Yu wasn’t exhausted. However, at this moment, Qin Yu understood.

To ordinary people, how could there be so many opportunities to leave? If all the experts left, they would only be lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s admiration towards Xiao Hai increased by a few notches.

He looked at everyone and said with a firm tone, “Everyone, don’t worry. I will definitely not join the northern lands. In a few days, I will head to the border.”

“As long as I, Qin Yu, am alive, I will definitely fight until the last moment.”

When everyone heard this, they cupped their hands towards Qin Yu. Some even planned to kneel down, but Qin Yu stopped them.

Looking at the people in front of him, Qin Yu felt a myriad of emotions.

Once an all-out war broke out, the first ones to be affected would definitely be these ordinary people.

Especially the spells controlled by the northern lands, which originated from the immortal slaying sect.

Those were extremely brutal spells that were too horrible to look at.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “Looks like I have to hurry to the northern lands.”

An all-out war was bound to happen sooner or later, so Qin Yu had to hurry.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and immediately left gu city.

“Qin Yu, there are so many people. You Can’t save them. No one can save anyone...”

Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s voice came from the spatial magic artifact.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks.

Of course, he understood that heavenly blood rainbow was right.

But if every expert had this mentality, then the South Province would really be finished.

Qin Yu didn’t explain too much to him and quickly rushed toward the hunter organization.

After returning to the hunter organization, Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and immediately began to set up the dragon-protecting formation.

Setting up the Dragon Protection Formation was not an easy task. With Qin Yu’s method, it would take at least a week.

The rest of the week was busy.

When the hunters saw this, they could not bear it.

“In fact... Qin Yu could have just left.”

“Yes, the loss of the white bone club can not be blamed on him...”

Jing Bai looked at Qin Yu’s figure and was even more silent.

He secretly clenched his fists and could not help but feel resentful in his heart. He hated himself for not having powerful strength.

...

While Qin Yu was setting up the formation, a sect suddenly emerged in the South Province.

This sect was called Teng Gate. In just a few days, it had destroyed dozens of sects of all sizes!

And the owner of Teng Men was none other than he teng!

He Teng had relied on his own powerful strength and the support of the white bone staff to become the second largest sect in the South Province in just a few days, just below the Heavenly Cloud sect!

The already chaotic South Province, with the addition of He Teng, this shit stirring stick, immediately became even more chaotic.

At the same time, the people of the northern lands began to invade the South Province.

These northern cultivators who had entered the southern region burned, killed, and plundered the southern region, committing all kinds of evil.

Because of the great battle last time, the Heavenly Cloud sect had suffered a great blow, so their strength had also been reduced, causing the southern region to become even more rampant.

Many ambitious people formed their own teams and began to fight against the northern cultivators.

...

In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.

Clouds of mist appeared above the entire Hunter organization.

The Mist covered the Sun and moon. From time to time, one could see a dragon-like internal QI swaying in the mist.

“It’s finally done.”

Qin Yu buried the iron rod at the core of the formation. The moment the iron rod was placed there, the mist of the entire hunter organization slowly closed like a huge door.

At a glance, it actually looked somewhat similar to the Cultivation Mountain of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“It’s about time to head to the northern lands,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Therefore, Qin Yu found Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang and taught them the method to activate the Dragon Protection Formation.

“This formation can only be activated by the two of you at the same time. Therefore, it’s best for the two of you to stay together in the future,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Guan Zhuang muttered, “Is this formation really that powerful?”

“Yeah, this formation looks very ordinary...”a hunter beside him whispered.

“No matter how you look at it, this formation doesn’t look like it can protect the sect...”

Qin Yu smiled. Just as he was about to speak, a dense crowd of people suddenly appeared above him.

These people were like a dark cloud, blotting out the sky and covering the sun.

They stood above, looking down at the crowd from above.

“Listen up, from today onwards, the hunters will stop us. Otherwise, today will be the day the hunter organization is destroyed!”

The voice was like thunder, rolling over, shaking the earth and causing it to rumble.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
