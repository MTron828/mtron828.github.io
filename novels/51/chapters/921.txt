Chapter 922: Chapter 922, Xu Huaigu VS the three martial saints 

Xu Huaigu was dressed in a long robe and had a long beard. He looked like a celestial being.

When they saw this person, many martial saints narrowed their eyes slightly.

They were not unfamiliar with Xu Huaigu.

He was the only martial saint in the current era. He was also the only person who had gone against the martial saint of the mystic realm.

Therefore, the people in the mystic realm hated him to the bone.

“Xu Huaigu?”The first to speak was uncle otter, who had attacked Qin Yu.

The other martial saints also stepped forward.

“Are we going to go over?”Zhai Xing looked at Gu Xinghe.

Gu Xinghe shook his head and said, “No, we still have to win over the hearts of the people and use them for my purposes. Now is not the time to make a move.”

Zhai Xing nodded slightly when he heard this.

Xu Huaigu walked straight to the side of Qin Yu and the others.

He placed his hands behind his back and looked at Uncle Otter and the others in front of him quietly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Fellow Daoist, why must you be so aggressive?”Xu Huaigu said quietly.

Uncle otter sneered, “So what if you’re aggressive? You’re Only a new martial saint. Don’t tell me you want to become enemies with all of us?”

Xu Huaigu said quietly, “The more powerful you are, the more responsibility you have. Although I don’t know them, since I’ve become a martial saint, I have my own responsibilities.”

“Hahahahaha!”Hearing these words, Uncle Otter immediately burst into laughter.

“From your words, you’re planning to protect them?”

Xu Huaigu said with a calm expression, “If you insist on fighting, I can only exchange blows with you.”

“Good! Today, I will teach you a lesson, this junior who doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!”Uncle Otter roared, his internal Qi instantly rising!

With a wave of his large hand, an intense force rushed towards Xu Huaigu’s face!

Xu Huaigu’s expression was calm and did not panic. With a wave of his large sleeve, an equally powerful force rushed towards him!

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, the two of them exploded like a cannonball!

Then, they saw Uncle Otter take a few steps back!

On the other hand, Xu Huaigu remained calm. He stood where he was without moving an inch.

This undoubtedly boosted the confidence of the many aristocratic disciples!

Everyone shouted, “Senior Xu is invincible under the Heavens!”

Uncle Otter’s expression was extremely ugly.

Although the two sides were only exchanging blows, they were at a disadvantage when they raised their hands. This could be said to have lost the face of all martial saints in the mystic realm.

“I really underestimated you!”Uncle Otter said with a cold face.

At the same time, Uncle Zhen and the others also took a step forward together.

At a glance, they saw Xu Huaigu fighting against three martial saints alone!

“What kind of ability is it to bully the weak with numbers!”

“If you have the ability, fight against senior xu one-on-one!”

“Even if you win, it will be an unfair victory!”

However, Uncle Zhen sneered and said, “We have more martial saints. This is also our strength. Even if it’s three-on-one, why not!”

Uncle Otter narrowed his eyes and said, “Xu Huaigu, if you leave now, we might be able to stop.”

Xu Huaigu glanced at them and said quietly, “All of you, attack together.”

“You’re courting death!”These words undoubtedly infuriated everyone!

Uncle Otter and the other three martial saints exploded with Qi energy in an instant and closed in on Xu Huaigu!

The terrifying qi force instantly made everyone unable to withstand it.

Even Qin Yu felt a wave of stuffiness in his chest!

Xu Huaigu raised his palm and a wave of gentle qi force instantly covered Qin Yu and the others.

On the other hand, his other hand slowly condensed beams of resplendent light to meet the three people!

“Boom!”

The great battle erupted in an instant. Xu Huaigu fought one against three, but he was not at a disadvantage at all!

“Retreat quickly!”Qin Yu saw that things were not going well and shouted hastily.

A full-force battle between Martial Saints was not something an ordinary half-step martial artist could withstand!

Under Qin Yu’s lead, everyone retreated a few miles in one breath and watched the battlefield from afar!

Xu Huaigu’s moves were extremely ordinary, but each move contained extremely terrifying power.

Even when fighting against three people, he was not at a disadvantage at all.

Everyone’s blood boiled as they watched, and they all clenched their fists.

“Senior Xu will definitely win!”

“Even if it’s one against three, senior Xu still firmly holds the advantage!”

“Senior Xu is the role model of our generation!”

Qin Yu did not say a word. In his heart, he also had a trace of admiration for Xu Huaigu.

For the sake of the current generation of martial artists, he would rather offend all the major secret realms, and even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

This kind of temperament was worthy of respect!

“Boom!”

Along with a burst of explosion, the moves of both sides exploded in the sky!

In an instant, this gorgeous light illuminated the sky, turning the night into day!

It seemed that it would be very difficult to determine the victor in a short period of time in a fight between four people!

“No!”Qin Yu was somewhat anxious.

They had seven martial saints! Now, only three of them had made a move!

If one more person joined them, then Xu Huaigu would die without a doubt!

“Damn it!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth anxiously.

He wanted to help, but he was afraid of exposing his identity.

At this moment, Qin Yu even wanted to bring out that Coffin to suppress Uncle Otter and the others!

Qin Yu stared straight ahead, and his heart became increasingly anxious.

If he could not stop this battle as soon as possible, Xu Huaigu would only become weaker and weaker!

“Damn it, if I really can’t do it, I will take out those two corpses!”Qin Yu thought to himself!

Those two corpses were existences that surpassed mighty figures!

If these two corpses could resurrect on their own, killing these martial saints would not be a problem at all!

Seeing that the other martial saints nearby were getting restless, Qin Yu could not wait any longer.

Xu Huaigu was fighting at the front, yet he was hiding here. This was not Qin Yu’s personality!

“I’m going all out!”Qin Yu cursed in his heart! He decided to take out the two corpses!
