2064 The Evil Holy Son

The strength of these people was incredibly extraordinary, and they also had tribulation magical artifacts.

Under such circumstances, Qin Yu was definitely reluctant to take risks.

However, in the subsequent two days, they did not intend to leave even though everyone who came to the Chaos Grave died in their hands.

“It’s going to be troublesome.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and was at a loss for a moment.

Would they wait here forever? In that case, Qin Yu would have no chance at all!

“I wonder what attitude the nine great aristocratic families will have when they arrive,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

On the other end, three days passed quickly, and Xuan Jizi walked out of the Si family’s Mystic Realm.

Holy Lord Si had been waiting for a long time, bringing a tribulation magical artifact along. In the dark, an unusual internal qi was surging.

Obviously, Holy Lord Si was fully prepared. The Si family would kill Xuan Jizi here and now if Xuan Jizi dared to play tricks on them.

“You can hand over the thing now, right?” Holy Lord Si said coldly.

Xuan Jizi didn’t answer. He slightly closed his eyes and shook his head. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I can’t do it here. Once I give you the supreme bone, I might not be able to leave the Si family,” Xuanji said.

Holy Lord Si suppressed his anger and said, “What do you want then?”

“Take me out of the Si family. As long as I have the means to escape, I will naturally hand over the thing to you,” Xuan Jizi said.

Although Holy Lord Si was reluctant, he still agreed in the end.

He took Xuan Jizi out of the Si family’s entrance. As soon as he stepped out, Holy Lord Si blocked his way.

Xuan Jizi closed his eyes and sensed for a while before nodding. “It’s good enough.”

With a flip of his palm, he took out a sparkling white bone from his bosom.

The white bones emitted an incredibly mysterious internal qi. This internal qi was full of hoariness, and it indeed looked extraordinary.

No one had ever seen what the true supreme bone looked like, and the bone in Xuan Jizi’s hand was indeed taken from a tribulation great cultivator.

Thus, after obtaining the bone, Holy Lord Si’s eyes lit up in excitement!

“Alright, I’ve given you the thing. I should go now,” Xuan Jizi said calmly.

Holy Lord Si held the bone tightly. His eyes flickered, and in an instant, numerous thoughts flashed through his mind.

“Hahaha! That’s for sure. Who wouldn’t want to befriend your Si family if there’s an opportunity?” Xuan Jizi said with a faint smile.

Holy Lord Si obviously didn’t want to offend a True Saint. Thus he bowed slightly and ignored him.

Xuan Jizi didn’t stay for long and disappeared into the void.

“Holy Lord, is this really the supreme bone?” an elder beside him walked over and asked.

Holy Lord Si took a deep breath and said, “He probably won’t lie to me, and he wouldn’t dare to either. Pass down the message. We’ll leave immediately, heading to the Chaos Grave!”

This time, the Si family sent a True Saint to the Chaos Grave to ensure they could take control of the Chaos Grave!

In the vicinity of the Chao Grave, Qin Yu was still waiting anxiously. Soon, a carriage flew across the sky, and a large number of people surged toward the Chaos Grave!

He raised his head and saw the Si family’s carriage!

The carriage was grand and full of people. At a glance, there were hundreds of cultivators traveling together!

This aura made everyone feel hungry, shocked, and terrified! Even the trio below could not help but frown slightly.

“The Si family is here.”

“What do we do now?”

“What else can we do? It’s not a wise choice to fight the Si family head-on. Let’s retreat first! ”

Then the three quickly hid.

Qin Yu could not help but curse in his heart. “These three b*stards left at the right time!”

Why did they have to wait for the arrival of the Si family before they left?

As soon as the Si family’s carriage appeared, another carriage streaked across the sky!

Looking up, he saw the enormous word “Jiang” written on the carriage!

It was the Jiang family’s war chariot! They were here too!

The leader of the Jiang family was a young man. He had a bright smile on his face, and his white clothes made him look like a young man in the neighborhood without any craftiness.

He was the Holy Son of the Jiang family, Jiang Wushuang!

“Why are the people of the Jiang family here?” Seeing this, the elder of the Si family could not help but frown.

Holy Lord snorted and said, “It’s up to them if they want to come. Anyway, they don’t have the supreme bone and chaotic blood. It’s useless for them to come over.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter in his heart, “The Jiang family indeed has the supreme bone, but where did they get the chaotic blood?”

Qin Yu had been careful and did not give them the chaotic blood. Other than Qin Yu and Si Shiyue, no one else had the chaotic blood!

Soon, the two carriages landed together, and the people from both sides quickly met.

Jiang Wushuang took the lead to cup his hands, greeting Holy Lord Si, “Uncle Si.”

Holy Lord Si glanced at Jiang Wushuang and nodded in response.

Then Holy Lord Si asked, “Wushuang, what are you doing here?”

“This is Senior Wu Ji’s Big Grave, after all. My Jiang family is also quite interested in such a legendary figure’s grave,” Jiang Wushuang said with a smile.

Holy Lord Si raised his eyebrows and said, “So you guys have also obtained the supreme bone?”

“That’s right. We’re lucky enough to get one,” Jiang Wushuang laughed and said.

Holy Lord Si’s expression changed slightly. He frowned and said, “Where did you get it? What conditions did you offer to exchange for it?”

“It’s all thanks to the grand event you organized. We didn’t expect someone to send it to our Jiang family. Our Jiang family spent 100 million Spirit Coins to exchange for the supreme bone.” Jiang Wushuang was neither overbearing nor self-effacing as he smiled.

However, his words made Qin Yu, hiding in the dark, almost laugh out loud.

This Jiang Wushuang looked harmless, but he was actually very evil. His words obviously meant to provoke Holy Lord Si!

Who didn’t know that the Si family had even thrown out their immortal scripture to obtain the supreme bone?

However, the Jiang family had only used 100 million Spirit Coins to exchange for the supreme bone. How could he not be furious?

“Sigh! We only wanted to give them 10 million Spirit Coins, but they disagreed. They wasted another 90 million Spirit Coins of ours.” Jiang Wushuang made a regretful and unwilling expression.

This made Holy Lord Si’s face turn ashen, and he almost cursed.

A mere 100 million Spirit Coins was nothing to the nine great aristocratic families!

“I’m just afraid the supreme bone in your hands is fake. There’s no good thing if it’s cheap,” Holy Lord Si snorted coldly and said.
