Chapter 714: Yan Jinyao Came out of Seclusion Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Chang Mang looked at He Teng’s back and then at Qin Yu, and his internal qi started to disappear.

“Okay, I’ll listen to you.” Chang Mang snorted.

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Why are you here? Didn’t Zhen Yue say that you were captured?”

Chang Mang nodded and said, “Yeah, I was almost captured. Fortunately, I woke up and escaped.”

“After I escaped, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association sent many black-gold robe powerhouses to hunt me down, so I didn’t dare to show myself.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I didn’t expect them to attack you as well.”

Chang Mang waved his hand and said, “The outside world said that you died in the Immortal Slaying Sect. You...”

“I was lucky to escape,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Chang Mang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “There must be good fortune after surviving a great disaster! Qin Yu, it was all thanks to you back then. I owe you my life!”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s register first.”

Both of them were extremely talented people, so it wasn’t a problem for them to join this academy.

After completing the relevant procedures, Qin Yu and Chang Mang walked out of the academy together.

The official opening of the academy would be three days later. As for the exact details, no one knew.

“Follow me back to the Green Moon Villa first.” Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang and said.

Chang Mang nodded and said: “Alright!”

And so, the two of them left the Jingdu together before hurrying toward Cangzao City.

After they returned to the Green Moon Villa, Zhen Yue prepared a large table of food.

At night, the few of them sat under the moonlight and drank with each other.

“Brother Qin, over the past few months, I have traveled almost half of the country before I was able to escape from the pursuit.” Chang Mang said as he took a sip of his wine.

Having said that, Chang Mang tore off his clothes, revealing his strong muscles.

“Look, this is what they have done.” Chang Mang said as he pointed at a shocking wound on his chest.

“Of course, they aren’t much better off. I killed six of their black-gold robe powerhouses!” Then, Chang Mang changed the topic and said with a smile.

Qin Yu took a sip of wine and said in a low voice, “The Martial Arts Association of Jingdu isn’t that simple. Rumor has it that the purple-robed men are their strongest combat strength, but the likeliness of this isn’t high.”

Chang Mang stared at Qin Yu and waited for him to continue.

Qin Yu continued, “Now, I seriously suspect that they might have a Martial Saint.”

“Martial Saint?” A trace of surprise flashed across Chang Mang’s face.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right, I have a strong premonition that they not only have a Martial Saint, but there might also even be more than one.”

Chang Mang’s expression gradually became solemn.

If there really was a Martial Saint, then no one would be able to go against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

No matter how many Martial Marquises were gathered, they weren’t worth mentioning in front of a Martial Saint.

“If they really have a Martial Saint, why didn’t they just send out a Martial Saint?” Xiao Yu tilted his head and said with some doubt.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. Perhaps for some reason, they can’t attack at will.”

This feeling was very strong. Putting everything aside, just these eight high-ranking officials made Qin Yu feel a sense of danger.

“I have a thought. Do you think the Martial Saint of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is cultivating in the Mystic Realm?” Zhen Yue, who had been silent all this time, suddenly asked.

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up slightly, then he nodded and said, “I have the same thought as you.”

“Before the Mystic Realm was exposed, I didn’t think that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had such a powerful force.”

“But ever since I found out that a large number of resources were hidden in the Mystic Realm, I changed my mind.”

When he said this, Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd and continued, “Even if they don’t have a Martial Saint, there will definitely be someone who will step into the Martial Saint realm. Anything is possible in the Mystic Realm.”

The atmosphere instantly became somewhat heavy. Chang Mang, who had always been optimistic, couldn’t help but frown.

“Then what should we do? What can we do?” Chang Mang asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “What we can do is to increase our strength as soon as possible. At least, before their Martial Saint makes an appearance, we will have a certain amount of battle strength.”

“This is the only way.” Chang Mang sighed with emotion.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

At this moment, he felt that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was like an insurmountable mountain.

However, in order to save Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu had no choice but to go forward.

After dinner, Qin Yu and Zhen Yue returned to the hall.

Qin Yu took out the Prajna ruler and placed it in front of Zhen Yue.

“This object is called the Prajna ruler. It’s a Martial Saint’s weapon,” Qin Yu said.

Zhen Yue stared at the Prajna ruler in front of her, and her eyes had a strange look.

Qin Yu handed the Prajna ruler to Zhen Yue and said, “I’ll be returning to Jingdu tomorrow. I’ll leave this Prajna ruler to you.”

“If anything happens, I think the Prajna ruler should be able to handle it, but don’t use it unless it’s a critical moment.”

Zhen Yue frowned and said, “Will you be gone for a long time?”

“I don’t know.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“In short, you have to guard the Green Moon Villa well.”

Seeing Qin Yu’s grave expression, Zhen Yue didn’t dare to ask further. She could only nod carefully.

The Green Moon Villa might become Qin Yu’s base.

After all, it was impossible to uproot the Jingdu Martial Arts Association singlehandedly.

...

At this moment, in a manor in Jingdu.

In a secret room in the manor, there was a strange sound, as if something was about to explode.

“Boom!”

A moment later, the secret room exploded with a strange color. The light slowed down for half a second, and then spread out like water ripples in all directions!

The loud sound immediately woke up Yan Sihai, who was sleeping soundly.

Yan Sihai frowned slightly. He put on his clothes and hurried downstairs.

He saw a young man standing at the door of the secret chamber.

The young man’s face was as white as paper. There was no color of blood on his face. He looked like a sickly man.

However, the aura on his body was extremely powerful. No one dared to look at him directly!

“Jinyao, have you come out of seclusion?” Yan Sihai walked up quickly.

After walking in, Yan Sihai realized that there was a crazy smile on Yan Jinyao’s face.

Half a second later, Yan Jinyao laughed out loud. “Hahaha, I understand! I understand!”

Yan Sihai was confused and frowned. “Jinyao, what’s wrong?”

Yan Jinyao glanced at Yan Sihai and then sneered. “Dad, I finally understand the secret of this bloodline.”

“The mystery of the bloodline?” Yan Sihai was stunned. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
