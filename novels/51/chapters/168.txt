Chapter 169: Someone Is Bullying Me! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu frowned when he heard the tattooed guy’s words.

Xiao Yu, who was at the side, cursed, “Are you a f * cking idiot? Go home and find your mom. Let your mom accompany you!”

The tattooed guys weren’t angry. They continued to laugh and said, “You’re so feisty. We like feisty girls!”

Then, they looked at Qin Yu and shouted, “Bro, it must be nice to bang such a beautiful girl every day, right?”

After saying that, they laughed again. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xiao Yu was immediately angry. She grabbed the dishes on the table and threw them over!

“How have the guts you talk dirty?!” Xiao Yu said angrily.

The tattooed guys had soup splashed all over their bodies. Their expressions gradually became a little ugly.

“Little sl*t, you’re so shameless. Today, you’d better lick all the soup off my body!” A few people stood up and walked towards Xiao Yu coldly.

Although Xiao Yu was angry, she wasn’t stupid. Seeing these people stand up, she immediately ran behind Qin Yu and hid.

“Qin Yu, beat them up for me!” Xiao Yu said while glaring at them.

Qin Yu sat there without moving and continued to eat his skewers.

A few young men quickly walked to Qin Yu’s side. They sized up Qin Yu and said, “Kid, your girlfriend splashed soup all over us. What do you think we should do?”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said indifferently, “What do you guys want to do?”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, they immediately felt that Qin Yu was a coward.

Therefore, they said with a nonchalant smile, “Let your girlfriend accompany us for one night, and we’ll forget about this matter. How about it?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head.

He put down the skewers in his hand and said indifferently, “First, she’s not my girlfriend.”

“Second, if you don’t want to die, you’d better scram right now.”

Hearing that, the few of them immediately laughed loudly and said, “Kid, you sure talk big!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Bullsh*tting isn’t a good habit.”

The few of them said with dark expressions, “You’re courting death! Don’t be shameless. Bros, cripple him for me!”

After saying that, the few of them immediately rushed towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sat there. He didn’t even stand up. With a wave of his hand, the few of them were instantly sent flying!

A huge force sent them flying, and they even spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Serves you right! If you have the guts to spout nonsense again, I’ll tear your mouth apart!” Xiao Yu said while glaring at them.

A few youths got up from the ground. They pointed at Qin Yu’s nose and said, “Brat, just you wait. We are members of the Red Star Society! If you have the guts, don’t leave!”

“I haven’t finished my meal. Of course I won’t leave,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

These young men gritted their teeth and turned around to leave.

“What bullsh * t Red Star Society? I’ve never heard of it!” Xiao Yu said with a snort.

At this time, the owner of the restaurant suddenly walked over.

He advised, “Young man, you’d better leave quickly. This Red Star Society isn’t to be trifled with. They have dozens of people under their command. They run amok in this area. No one have the gutss to provoke them!”

“Run amok?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

The owner sighed and said, “Yes, they always owe us money when they come to eat. They never pay us back. We get angry, but we don’t have the guts to speak up.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then why do you still serve them food?”

The owner forced a smile and said, “I’m just a small business owner. If I can tolerate it, I’ll tolerate it. Who wants to cause trouble?”

“Are they that despicable? What era is this? They actually have the guts to oppress ordinary civilians?!” Before Qin Yu could finish, Xiao Yu was so angry that she lambasted them indignantly.

“Owner, don’t worry. I’ll get justice for you today!” Xiao Yu patted her own chest and said.

The owner forced a smile.

“You’re just a little girl. How can you do anything?” The owner forced a smile.

Qin Yu, who was at the side, smiled and said, “She might really be able to do something for you.”

The owner was stunned, and his face was immediately filled with confusion.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yu took out her phone and dialed a number.

After the call was connected, Xiao Yu said on the phone, “Mr. Guo, I was bullied at the Jade Dragon Street barbecue stall. The Red Star Society wants to take me away. Mwaah...”

Then, Xiao Yu continued, “Yes, bring more people. They have hundreds of people under them!”

On the other end, Mr. Guo was shocked.

Mr. Wu’s daughter was bullied by Society X? How could that be?

He immediately ordered, “Gather the second combat division. Go to Jade Dragon Street immediately!”

“Yes!”

...

At the barbecue stall, Xiao Yu said with a smile, “Don’t worry. The Red Star Society will be gone soon.”

The owner naturally wouldn’t believe it. The Red Star Society had been tyrannizing them for so long. How could it be eradicated by a little girl?

“You guys should leave quickly. If you don’t leave now, you might even implicate us. I won’t charge you for this meal. Just treat it as my treat, okay?” The owner pleaded.

Xiao Yu widened her eyes and said, “What are you talking about? I’m not one of those hooligans. How can I take advantage of you?!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I didn’t expect you to have such a strong sense of justice.”

“Of course! Everyone in our school calls me the incarnation of justice!” Xiao Yu said proudly.

Qin Yu sighed to himself.

How many small organizations like the Red Star Society were there?

Would those people who were bullied by them be lucky enough to meet someone like Xiao Yu?

Seeing that he couldn’t persuade them, the owner didn’t say anything more. He could only sigh at the side.

Qin Yu and Xiao Yu didn’t care and continued to eat the barbecue.

Soon, a few cars drove over from a short distance away!

The leader drove a Mercedes-Benz, and behind him, there were a bunch of luxury cars.

As soon as the car stopped, they saw a bald man wearing a gold necklace and playing with mala beads in his hand get down.

“Bro, it’s them!” The young men who had been beaten up hurriedly pointed in Qin Yu’s direction.

The bald man snorted, waved his hand, and said, “Go surround their table!”

“Yes!”

Dozens of underlings quickly swarmed over and surrounded Qin Yu’s table!

Xiao Yu couldn’t help but feel a little scared and hid behind Qin Yu.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was calm and didn’t take these people seriously at all.

The bald man walked in front of Qin Yu. He played with the mala beads and said, “You are the one who beat up my buddy?”

Qin Yu didn’t even raise his head and said coldly, “If you don’t get lost, you will be the next one to be beaten up.”

The bald man’s expression immediately turned cold. He snorted and said, “You reckless little b*stard, cripple him for me!”

“Yes!” Dozens of people instantly grabbed their clubs and charged towards Qin Yu!

“Rumble...”

At this moment, a series of rumbling sounds suddenly came from a short distance away.

After turning around to look, they saw countless war chariots driving over!
