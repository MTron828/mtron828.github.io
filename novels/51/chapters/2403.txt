Chapter 2404 Opening up the Acupoints

Just like Jun Yixian, he could make you live in the most painful world for hundreds of years with a thought. Only this kind of soul punishment was the most terrifying.

Qin Yu recalled the time when he fought against the Nightmare. At that time, his father had protected his origin.

The extreme pain of his soul being squeezed alive still made him tremble.

“If you want to die, I won’t stop you. I’ll go to the Ni family and take your child back.”

Qin Yu threw down the green sword in his hand and turned to wait at the door.

Ni Yun’s screams of agony went on in the room, and it was unknown how much time had passed before they gradually subsided and finally quieted down.

The only sound in the room was the prince’s soft breathing. No one knew what he was thinking.

After Chang Mang and Jue Wu killed those people, they came to Qin Yu and waited quietly.

After some time, the smell of blood wafted out from the room.

Qin Yu’s face revealed a sorrowful expression. The three of them slowly walked into the house.

On the bed, the prince’s eyes were closed, and a divine sense jade slip was beside him.

“Qin Yu, thank you for preserving my last bit of dignity. In these hundred years, almost all of my self-esteem has been destroyed. It’s an endless nightmare whenever I close my eyes. I’m not as good as you, and I know I don’t have the strength to take revenge. Cremate me and bring me back to the Imperial of Sky City. I want to go home…”

Qin Yu was silent for a long time. A black flame engulfed the prince’s corpse and he collected Qin Yu’s ashes in a jade bottle. He closed his eyes and finally could no longer hold back his tears.

….

“Bring Your Highness home.”

Endless fatigue filled Qin Yu’s voice as he entered the Sumeru ring.

Several of them sailed on the void warship together, although the speed was a little slow.

However, they could cultivate in the Sumeru ring, while Qin Yu forcefully suppressed the frustration in his heart.

He took out Yao Xi’s Celestial Saint corpse and absorbed the enormous energy of dead bodies.

This corpse was already capable of communicating with the Rules of Heaven and Earth and absorbing energy by itself.

“It’s still not enough. It seems that the corpse of the Celestial Saint is absorbing the energy of dead bodies at a tremendously slow speed.”

Qin Yu frowned. He did not leave his divine sense mark in the sea of the Path of Heaven. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The current techniques needed a vast amount of spiritual energy. If he replenished the energy of the Glazed Holy Body, it would be a little troublesome if he encountered a formidable enemy.

With a thought, he focused on the Immortal Emperor’s corpse.

In the beginning, the Immortal Emperor’s corpse still trembled violently in the coffin as if wanting to break free.

However, it had been tremendously quiet these few days as if it had been completely suppressed.

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment and gently opened a corner of the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes.

With a bong!

The terrifying energy of dead bodies instantly erupted from inside, and a withered hand covered in massive tendons suddenly stretched out five fingers.

Qin Yu’s body was fiercely sent flying.

“Nine Thunder God’s Thunder Technique!”

Qin Yu was tremendously shocked.

With a thought, he used the most formidable technique of Immortal Emperor Lei, and a massive thunderbolt struck that palm.

The palm slowly stretched out and grabbed the thunderbolt out of thin air! After that, the palm emitted a surge of energy of dead bodies that slowly dissolved the thunderbolt.

“Quickly help and hit it back. Once this thing comes out, we’re doomed!”

Qin Yu shouted.

“Get lost!”

Chang Mang rushed over and punched the claw.

However, that finger flicked lightly, sending Chang Mang flying.

The coffin trembled violently and bounced up into the air.

Qin Yu hurriedly rushed to the side of the coffin and swiped his finger across. He used the method the man with the mustache had told to activate the coffin.

“Whoosh!”

The coffin started to spin violently, and the corpse inside seemed severely injured.

Chang Mang stepped forward to the back of the coffin and kicked it with all his might.

The coffin lid finally closed a little, and Jue Wu also arrived above the palm.

She pressed her palm down with all her might, and her hands turned red in an instant.

The palm energy carried a trace of the Vermillion Bird’s power as it slammed onto the palm.

The power of the Vermilion Bird roamed on the palm and seemed to have melted some skins of the Immortal Emperor’s palm.

An enormous mass of the energy of dead bodies exploded once again. Jue Wu’s face suddenly darkened, and she fell straight to the ground.

The palm suddenly retracted, and Qin Yu and Chang Mang took this opportunity to close the coffin lid.

“Qin Yu, this energy of dead bodies is highly toxic.”

Elder Guai’s expression changed drastically.

Xiaoru, Little Fatty, and the others collapsed almost instantly.

Elder Guai and Chang Mang’s expressions were extremely ugly.

“Traceless Immortal Scripture!”

Qin Yu’s palm suddenly jerked, and the energy of dead bodies immediately entered his body.

Without stopping, he slapped Jue Wu’s body and sucked out the energy of dead bodies in her body.

In Qin Yu’s body, wisps of the Immortal Emperor’s energy of dead bodies spread out, instantly turning into an ocean of chaotic qi.

In less than ten breaths, the holy bones and the cells in his body were filled with vast amounts of chaotic qi.

His body swelled up like a balloon, and the qi the Immortal Emperor emitted almost made him explode.

It was the gap in the quality of the energy!

It was the gap between the energy of the Imperial Immortal and the True Saint.

Even if he had reached the Tribulation First Level, a small ball of Imperial Immortal energy could probably explode his body directly.

Qin Yu’s body seeped out countless traces of blood. That terrifying energy was rampaging in his body, looking for a breakthrough point to rush out.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and forcefully controlled the chaotic qi to rush into the acupoint of the vitality gate on her spine. That acupoint instantly emanated an intense pain as if it was about to explode.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s mind exploded. That vitality gate acupoint was compressed to the extreme, and suddenly, a force compressed to the extreme spewed out.

That force pierced into Qin Yu’s head like a formation. Qin Yu felt a buzzing sound in his head.

He felt sore and numb in the middle of his forehead. After that, Qin Yu’s soul saw an incredibly vast space.

A vast amount of spiritual energy surged into it, and the space in the acupoint of the forehead was like a giant beast.

All the massive chaotic energy converted from the energy of dead bodies surged into it.

On Qin Yu’s body, his Glazed Holy Body emanated a green light that was much stronger than the previous internal qi fluctuation.

After a long time, Qin Yu’s body gradually calmed down.
