1855 The Hall of Justice’s Decision

As the two of them didn’t trust each other, they could only swear.

After this, Qin Yu knocked out Demon Jingshan.

He then looked at the haziness in front of him.

Instead of hazy, this place would be better described as chaotic.

!!

The internal qi once again made him feel the abnormality.

It was because the internal qi here very much resembled the internal qi Qin Yu felt in the chaos.

The only difference was that it was very much thinner here as if it had been diluted countless times.

“Is it because this method imitates the environment to create Life Aura?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Back then, when Qin Yu was looking for Life Aura in the mountain range of Yang City, that place was surrounded by a thick fog. The locals called that internal qi the demonic qi, and some called it the chaotic qi.

The internal qi of the formation here resembled very much the internal qi in the mountain range of Yang City.

If that was the case, it was very likely that Life Aura was bred from the so-called demonic qi.

“In the future, if the so-called demonic qi becomes even more intense, will that terrifying mysterious green creature be born?” Qin Yu thought to herself.

It was very likely.

The mysterious green creature was extremely powerful and strange.

It was as if they were without life, and they survived on the so-called demonic qi.

If the demonic qi here was strong enough, it would not only produce Life Aura, but also the mysterious green creature.

“What are you thinking?” Chang Mang asked.

Qin Yu shook his head. He pointed at the internal qi in front of him and said, “I’ve seen this kind of internal qi in a mountain range. The locals call it demonic qi, but I always feel that this internal qi seems to have originated from the beginning of chaos. Perhaps it’s more appropriate to call it chaotic qi.”

“Who cares what it’s called? It’s just a name. Why are you thinking so much about it? Even if you call him sh*t qi, who cares? Aren’t all names given by humans?” Chang Mang mumbled.

Hearing Chang Mang’s words, Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

“You’re right,” he laughed and said. “I’m overthinking.”

Once a complicated problem was simplified, it would often become more understandable.

Thus Qin Yu stopped overthinking it. He then took out a small bottle of Life Aura. He clenched his golden fist and destroyed the formation.

After the formation was destroyed, the cultivators who were used for Life Aura absorption regained control of their bodies.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang did not stay for long. They brought Demon Jingshan with them and returned to the teleportation formation, embarking on their journey back to Thunder Courtyard.

Soon, the three of them returned to the Demon-slaying Peak of Thunder Courtyard.

Qin Yu did not waste time. He brought Demon Jingshan with him and went all the way to the cave abode of the peak master.

As usual, the peak master was playing chess with Jiu Xiao.

Qin Yu strode into the cave abode with Chang Mang. He then threw Demon Jingshan in front of the peak master with one hand.

“I’ve brought him back,” Qin Yu said.

The peak master and Jiu Xiao looked at Demond Jingshan in unison.

“Is everything done?” The peak master’s words clearly had a hidden message.

“Yes, everything is going according to plan,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

The peak master sighed. He walked forward and slapped Demon Jingshan’s face.

Demon Jingshan was instantly awakened. He suddenly opened his eyes and looked around.

Looking at the unfamiliar environment around him, he knew that he had been brought back to Demon-slaying Peak although he had never been here before.

“Just ask if there’s anything,” Demon Jingshan snorted and said.

“You’re quite sensible,” the peak master raised his eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu frowned and kicked Demon Jingshan. “Mind your attitude.”

Demon Jingshan was smart. He gritted his teeth, pretended to be aggrieved, and begged, “This matter has nothing to do with me. It was the Tong family who made me do this!”

Although the peak master had already known about Qin Yu’s plan in advance, he played along with the others.

After going through the procedure, Qin Yu looked at the peak master anxiously and said, “What is it now?”

The peak master said in a deep voice, “This Tong family has committed a heinous crime! However, this matter still needs to be reported, and the higher-ups will make a decision.”

“You can’t make the decision?” Qin Yu frowned.

The peak master rolled his eyes at Qin Yu and said, “Of course, I can’t make the decision. Thunder Courtyard has a specialized Hall of Justice. Everything is decided by the Hall of Justice.”

“Then this Hall of Justice… Can they pass this?” Qin Yu felt a headache.

He didn’t expect the peak master not to be able to make a decision at all. If the Hall of Justice saw through him, all his efforts would be in vain.

“Should be,” the peak master said.

The peak master sighed and said, “I’m more worried than you are. If the Hall of Justice discovers, not only will I lose my position as the peak master, I’m afraid I’ll be expelled from Thunder Courtyard.”

Only then did Qin Yu realize how much risk the peak master had taken for him.

“Whatever it is, don’t talk nonsense.” The peak master looked at Demon Jingshan sort of unintentionally.

Demon Jingshan was also a smart person. He quickly said, “I’m telling the truth. It’s all because of the Tong family!”

“Mmm,” the peak master responded. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “I’m setting off now to the Hall of Justice. Wait for my news.”

“Many thanks, Peak Master,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

The peak master didn’t waste time. He immediately got up and rushed to the Hall of Justice.

Jiu Xiao said while setting up the chess game, “Do you want to play?”

“Alright,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Therefore, Qin Yu sat opposite Jiu Xiao.

As they were playing chess, Jiu Xiao laughed and said, “I’ve underestimated you. You even dare to do such a thing. Do you know the consequences of lying to the Hall of Justice?”

“I don’t know, and I don’t want to care. No matter what the consequences are, I have to do this,” Qin Yu said.

“What if Demon Jingtian suddenly changes his mind?” Jiu Xiao said.

“Doing this won’t do him any good,” Qin Yu said.

Jiu Xiao didn’t say anything else and focused on the chess game.

Despite what he had said, Qin Yu’s heart was hanging in the air. It was not because he was afraid of the punishment of the Hall of Justice, but he was worried that he could not have the opportunity to use the power of Demon-slaying Peak once he was discovered. It would also mean Qin Yu no longer had the opportunity to bring Jue Wu back.

The peak master did not return for the entire day.

It made Qin Yu even more worried. His worry was beyond words. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The peak master still did not return the following day.

For the following three days, there was no news at all. It was as if the peak master had disappeared without a trace.

In the blink of an eye, it was the fifth day, but the peak master still did not show up.

Qin Yu couldn’t take it anymore. He stood up immediately and planned to go to the Hall of Justice.

Just as Qin Yu walked out of the main entrance of Demon-slaying Peak, she finally saw the peak master.

Qin Yu quickly walked up to him.

“Peak Master, how is it? What’s the Hall of Justice’s decision?” Qin Yu asked anxiously.
