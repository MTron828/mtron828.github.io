1792 Jiu Xiao Versus Jue Wu

A purple light was flickering at the entrance. It was the formation that Jue Wu had set up. It was extremely powerful.

However, Qin Yu at this point had almost lost his mind.

His rationality was screaming in his heart, but he couldn’t control his body at all.

Qin Yu walked to the entrance of the cave step by step, raised his palm, and threw a punch!

!!

The formation set up by Jue Wu was directly shattered by Qin Yu’s punch!

Such a terrifying qi energy truly terrified people!

Qin Yu took stepped forward, planning to leave the cave.

Fortunately, Jue Wu appeared in front of Qin Yu in time. When she saw Qin Yu’s appearance, she was instantly shocked, and her face turned a little ugly.

Jue Wu didn’t dare to think much. She roughly pulled Qin Yu and forcefully dragged him back.

She then once again used her secret technique to seal the cave.

“Jue Wu… I’m feeling very uncomfortable…” Qin Yu, with his remaining rationality, painfully looked at Jue Wu.

Jue Wu gritted her teeth. She reached out her hand and took out a dying cultivator, throwing him in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu couldn’t take it anymore. He rushed up like a beast and devoured the cultivator’s primordial spirit crazily.

After devouring the primordial spirit, Qin Yu’s inner demons were reduced, and the pain in his body also disappeared.

Qin Yu, who had regained his rationality, looked at everything in front of him in a daze. Her face was full of confusion and pain.

“I…” Qin Yu grabbed his head with both hands as if he was in great pain.

Jue Wu hurriedly walked forward to comfort him. “Don’t think too much. This person is a b*stard. I’ve been looking for a few days to find such suitable candidate.”

After hearing Jue Wu’s words, Qin Yu suddenly felt some warmth in his heart.

He looked at Jue Wu and said softly, “Thank you.”

“There’s no need to thank me.” Jue Wu waved her hand.

Qin Yu was silent.

After he devoured the primordial spirit, he felt much more comfortable. The mental addiction had also disappeared.

In that case, the situation would only aggravate in the future.

He could only temporarily maintain his rationality by constantly devouring other people’s primordial spirits.

“Phew!” Qin Yu let out a long breath.

Whether he liked it or not, Qin Yu was no different from a devil at this moment.

Jue Wu, who had always been carefree, was like an understanding big sister at this moment.

She looked at Qin Yu seriously and said, “Actually, this isn’t necessarily bad. Bad people like him should be killed.

“In the past, you killed them out of kindness. Now, it’s just that you’ve changed your method.

“And think about it. It might even encourage you to do good things, right?”

After hearing Jue Wu’s words, Qin Yu felt much better.

He looked at Jue Wu with a smile and said, “I’m really grateful to you,”

“Why are you thanking me? If you really want to thank me, drink with me!” Jue Wu flipped her palm and took out a few pots of wine.

“Where did you get them?” Qin Yu was surprised and asked.

Jue Wu laughed and said, “I bought them on my way out. Wait for me here.”

After saying this, Jue Wu directly rushed into the forest of the cave abode.

After a while, she came out with a huge beast.

Compared to this beast, Jue Wu’s small body instantly appeared even smaller, and the scene looked a bit unnatural.

However, Jue Wu’s dissection technique was definitely one of a kind.

She skinned the beast clean in no time. She then lit a fire and began to roast it.

Jue Wu seemed to always carry the seasoning with her. The way she used the seasoning was very particular as if she was a chef.

After a long time, the beast was finally cooked.

Qin Yu didn’t think so much. He accompanied Jue Wu to eat and drink. It was very satisfying.

After drinking, Qin Yu lay on the grass, feeling much more relaxed.

Jue Wu, on the other hand, fell asleep soundly. Her alcohol tolerance was excellent, and this little wine couldn’t possibly make her drunk.

Obviously, Jue Wu was extremely tired these few days. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have fallen asleep so quickly.

This made Qin Yu’s heart ache a little.

He looked at Jue Wu lying on the ground and said softly, “I will always remember you.”

Although Qin Yu felt better now, he knew this was not a long-term solution.

If he had the chance, he had to think of a way to control this inner demon.

Time flew by, and the sky gradually darkened.

At this time, a burst of noise suddenly came from outside.

Qin Yu looked up and saw Cao Huang at the door.

At the entrance, the secret technique that Jue Wu had laid down had disappeared. Thus Cao Huang effortlessly strode in.

This made Qin Yu feel annoyed.

“Simply entering and leaving other people’s houses as you please, didn’t your parents teach you about manners?” Qin Yu said with a cold face.

Seeing Qin Yu’s attitude, Cao Huang was stunned for a moment before he burst out laughing. “So you have a temper too? I thought you were only good at hiding behind women. Hahaha!”

Qin Yu’s face turned extremely cold in an instant. He slowly stood up, and his body exuded killing intent.

“You still f*cking dare to come over!”

At this moment, Jue Wu suddenly woke up.

She glared at Cao Huang and said, “Are you courting death? I didn’t manage to subdue you the last time, did I?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Looking at Jue Wu in front of him, Cao Huang’s expression was still somewhat unnatural.

But he bit the bullet and said, “Jue Wu, don’t be too arrogant. It’s Demon-slaying Peak here, not your Nanzhou!

“Are you reasoning with me now?” Rolling up her sleeves, Jue Wu didn’t waste any time and immediately rushed toward Cao Huang!

Just as Jue Wu’s small hand was about to hit Cao Huang, a hand suddenly stretched out and grabbed Jue Wu’s wrist.

Jue Wu’s petite body was suddenly lifted in the air.

The person who came was none other than the famous Jiu Xiao, the number one person of Demon-slaying Peak.

Jiu Xiao looked at Jue Wu coldly. He looked extremely cold.

“Hehe! With Jiu Xiao backing me up, I’m not afraid of you!” Cao Huang said proudly.

Jue Wu coldly looked at Jiu Xiao in front of her and said, “Let go.”

Jiu Xiao ignored Jue Wu. Instead, he looked down and said coldly, “You’re breaking the rules of Demon-slaying Peak.”

“I told you to let go!” Jue Wu was furious. Her palm emitted a purple light and ruthlessly slapped in the direction of Jiu Xiao!

However, Jiu Xiao was the number one person in Demon-slaying Peak. Not only was he have a realm higher than Jue Wu, but he had also listened to the Immortal Emperor’s dao for many years!

Most importantly, he had learned countless cultivation techniques from Thunder Courtyard!

Facing Jue Wu, he wasn’t afraid at all.

He waved his hand in the air, and a mark lit up.

This mark met Jue Wu’s palm and suddenly let out an explosion. The light on Jue Wu’s hand disappeared without a trace instantly!
