Chapter 2226 A Sword in a Thousand Years

“Flee!”

The man with the mustache suddenly rushed and gave him another corner marker. The two instantly shifted to another location.

“D*mn it! These people have gone crazy.”

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth away, and the internal qi in her body surged frantically.

In an instant, almost everyone displayed a desperate and fierce aura, attacking with all their might. This frenzy of aggression sent shivers down one’s spine.

“Thank goodness I have you, the man with the mustache.”

“Each person takes half. This formation took me three months to prepare in advance. It’s the result of my painstaking efforts and giving up cultivation. I even consumed numerous blood essence and treasures…”

The man with the mustache stared at Qin Yu warily.

“Okay, okay, shut up.”

Seeing him starting to count his contributions, he immediately felt a headache.

The ginseng that had transformed into a baby boy was only left with his head. White bones were all over its body as if it had been dismembered.

Tears kept flowing down his face, and he looked confused. He seemed puzzled why these cultivators attacked him.

Qin Yu sighed. This ginseng was like an ignorant baby who had just experienced a terrifying heavenly tribulation and was about to die now.

He had no chance at all under the gaze of countless frantic demonic beasts and cultivators.

Several cultivators with powerful internal qi grabbed at the ginseng’s head.

“The Tree Realm descends.”

A hoary voice suddenly appeared, and in an instant, numerous vines wrapped around the head.

“Little brother, don’t be afraid. Big sister will save you.”

The daffodil girl sent a stream of pure spiritual power into the ginseng’s head.

In an instant, the vines wrapping around the ginseng and the daffodil were about to penetrate the void.

“Boom!”

A sword light slashed down, and the void gate shattered.

The evil exterminator stepped forward and looked at the three of them expressionlessly.

“This ginseng only has a little soul left.”

Elder Guai frowned and said.

“Demon, die!”

The evil exterminator said coldly.

“Hahaha, another daffodil demon delivered itself to our doorstep. Although it can’t compare to the demonic ginseng, it’s still a supreme treasure!”

When a cultivator saw through the daffodil’s true body, he instantly laughed frantically.

Many treasures fiercely attacked Elder Guai’s body, and numerous wounds instantly appeared on his body.

“Whoosh!”

The massive whip lashed out, and the sound reverberated in the air. Some cultivators ‘eardrums were bulging, and blood flowed out of their ears.

Hundreds of vines lashed out like whips, causing the air to ripple with a massive force.

Several cultivators who could not dodge in time were chopped into pieces by the terrifying vines and screamed in agony on the ground.

It took a thousand years to forge a sword, and its icy edge remained untested.

The evil exterminator walked forward step by step.

The massive sword force was like a wave, rising steadily.

The sharp sword energy slashed numerous demonic beasts in the surroundings into pieces.

A giant sword slowly formed in the sky. It seemed to be the king of heaven and earth.

The spiritual energy, life force, death force, and demonic qi in the space all rushed toward the giant sword, becoming a part of it.

The sword aurora was like the sun, and the scorching light made people submit.

Within a thousand kilometers, there is no sign of life.

“Grandpa, Sister, you guys quickly leave.”

The baby boy struggled to open his eyes.

“Little Brother, don’t be afraid. Big Sister will protect you.”

She tried her best to shield ginseng using her spiritual power.

“Xiaoru, are you afraid? We might die here today. I underestimated his ability.”

Elder Guai smiled bitterly.

“A sword in a thousand years, kill!”

The evil exterminator was expressionless. In the next moment, the giant sword rushed out like a meteor.

“I want to save them!”

Qin Yu roared, and his body had already shot out abruptly. He arrived before the three of them right away using the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique.

“Don’t joke around! This is almost an attack from the peak of Saint Realm!”

The man with the mustache shouted shockingly.

Qin Yu did not have time to explain.

The giant shield that Elder Guai had propped up shattered instantly, unable to block it for even a moment.

Qin Yu clenched his fist the size of dozens of meters. Destructive power surged forward from his fist.

The moment the two rules clashed, Qin Yu’s fist phantom shattered.

“Desolate Divine Eye!”

All the spiritual energy in Qin Yu’s body frantically surged into his fist, and the destructive power blasted toward the weakest point.

The Wood of Locust Technique!

The toughest wooden door Elder Guai had given him, which had been nurtured for 10,000 years, was blocking the front.

After that, Qin Yu’s Saintly Body Technique was circulated to the extreme, blocking the three behind him.

Elder Guai pulled Qin Yu over to be behind him.

The shocking sword strike landed on Elder Guai’s back and pierced through.

Qin Yu felt his body torn into halves. He stood before Xiaoru and Ginseng, blocking the remaining power of the sword aurora.

After an unknown period of time, his vision turned black, and he fell to the ground.

“Flee!”

Before he fainted, he heard the roar of the man with the mustache.

“Formation Master? I can’t feel his internal qi anymore.”

Uncle Ling closed his eyes and shook his head for a long time.

The evil exterminator stared coldly at the space where the few of them disappeared, and no one knew what he was thinking.

…

In Solitary Cloud City, Qin Yu felt he had a remarkably long dream.

In his dream, he was split into halves. The pain in his soul was so real, and the other half of his body was watching him.

They were clearly the same person but seemed to have completely different thoughts.

He was swimming with all his might in the sea of the soul while the other Qin Yu on the shore stared at him expressionlessly.

Meanwhile, a massive vortex appeared in his sea of soul and kept tearing him apart, moving him deeper.

Qin Yu felt he could not flee from the soul space even if he tried his best.

A drop of green liquid suddenly dripped into Qin Yu’s divine sense. In an instant, he felt pure energy make his soul fill with energy again.

He forcefully floated up and finally reached the shore. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Whoosh!”

The man with the mustache’s voice entered Qin Yu’s ears.

“Are Elder Guai and Xioaru alright?”

Qin Yu suddenly sat up.

He seemed to have exerted too much strength and felt the world spin.

“F*ck, are you this fierce when you get up?”

The man with the mustache’s voice entered Qin Yu’s ears.

“Are Elder Guai and Xioaru alright?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“Big brother!”

Xiaoru bounced and hopped as she ran in. When she saw Qin Yu get up, she happily jumped up on the spot.

Behind him, an old man walked in shakily. His body was like a dried corpse.

“Elder Guai!”

Qin Yu’s eyes were red.

“Young man, it’s a great joy to survive. Fortunately, my Locust Tree Clan can regenerate its branches. Otherwise, I would have died long ago when my main branch was crushed.”

Elder Guai laughed heartily, not minding it at all.

“Why did you attack? We are of different races. This time, we went to save little ginseng. We thought of just giving it a try. I didn’t expect the evil exterminator to hate our tree demon race so much.”

Elder Guai sighed and said.

“Yeah, why? Actually, I don’t know either.”

Qin Yu suddenly smiled and rubbed Xiaoru’s head.

Perhaps it was because Xiaoru had given him a petal from the beginning or because of his father. It might also be he could not stand the concept of evil extermination, or he was moved when he saw the little boy struggling.

In any case, at that moment, he only wanted to save those three innocent people.

If he did not make a move, he might regret it for the rest of his life.
