absorb the destructive internal qi. As he shuttled between the dream and reality, he fused a trace of the Ten Annihilation divine artifact’s power into his divine soul.”

“Elder sister, how is this possible? The Ten Directions Annihilation internal qi is a divine artifact of death. Every trace of the qi is filled with curses and destruction. Would anyone take the initiative to savor such power?”

The little girl was in disbelief.

Ten Directions Annihilation itself was a divine artifact of the Divine Realm’s curse. It was born in the Sea of Curse, and the power it contained was something that no one was willing to come into contact with.

It was because every time one came into contact with a trace of the internal qi, it was as if one had suffered the cruelest torture.

Therefore, after Ten Directions Annihilation released his power, Zi Yan was surprised to see that Qin Yu was still alive. She did not expect him to take the initiative to absorb that trace of power.

Qin Yu’s body emitted a terrifying internal qi, and power akin to that of an ancient god suddenly spread out from his divine soul.

That power was contained in the depths of Qin Yu’s divine soul. At this moment, this power completely erupted in the continuous dream of reincarnation.

The Dusk Saber Blade in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness let out a mournful roar.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A feeling of fear turned the blade into a cloud of mist. This was the first time the consciousness of the Saint Kingdom’s extremely powerful Way of Rules sensed a consciousness that was even more ferocious than it.

At this moment, facing the internal qi of a fierce beast, it began to feel panic.

Submit or die!

Qin Yu stared at the Destruction Saber indifferently, surrounding it with his soul power.

If the Saint Kingdom’s consciousness still didn’t submit completely, Qin Yu didn’t mind destroying it.

If he could completely suppress the Order of Saint Kingdom with the help of the power of Ten Directions Annihilation, he would not have to worry about suffering the backlash of the Dusk Saber in the future.

A black lightning flashed across Qin Yu’s soul power. This lightning suddenly shuttled through the Dusk Saber.

In an instant, it let out a terrified roar.

The time that this power passed by, only did it discover that more than half of its consciousness was devoured.

Finally, Qin Yu felt that the Dusk Saber in the sea of consciousness had completely calmed down. It was no longer as restless as before. The trace of darkness in his eyes finally completely receded.

“Hmm?”

Hua Tian seemed to have noticed the change in Qin Yu’s body. At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have been relieved of a heavy burden.

The internal qi on his body once again became powerful. Hua Tian raised the Divination Sword and sneered at Qin Yu.

“Haha! No matter how you break through today, you will die here.”

Hua Tian laughed loudly, and the Divination Sword in his hand suddenly burst out with a terrifying Spiritual Energy Sword.

The trigrams on the sword changed again. The Great Expansion Divine Technique, the Eight-Trigram Sixty-Four Swords.

A huge Tai Chi pattern suddenly appeared under Hua Tian’s feet.

As he thrust his sword into the air, Qin Yu’s body shook violently.

Qian 1, Dui 2, Li 3, Zhen 4, Xun 5, Kan 6, Gen 7, Kun 8.

Sixty-four swords stabbed out from eight directions.

Dusk Saber, protect!

These 64 swords surrounded Qin Yu. The Tiger Wing in Qin Yu’s hands suddenly flapped.

His Tiger Wing let out a sound like a tiger’s roar, and the tornado-like saber energy clashed with the sixty-four swords.

The Great Expansion Divine Technique collided directly with the Dusk Saber. The power of rules clashed.

The collision was accompanied by a surge of consciousness. Countless divine souls seemed to be whispering and roaring above the entire Demon Sealing Valley.

The collision of the swords and the saber produced a huge flame that spewed out and exploded on the surrounding buildings.

After the will raged out, the disciples with lower cultivation levels within a 100 -meter radius directly fainted.

“What a terrifying power! How can someone at the True Consciousness Realm be able to control such a terrifying rule?”

Even Gu Ying was shocked when he saw this battle.

“That’s right. According to Dao Consciousness, this kind of power can only be completely mastered by someone who has reached the Dao Consciousness Realm or even the Holy Consciousness Realm. As expected of someone who has obtained the Holy Lord’s runes. These outsiders are not simple.”

Gu Yi’s expression was also a little ugly. They had lived in this area for a long time.

However, he realized that he was far inferior to the outsiders at this moment. This was somewhat difficult for him to accept.

Boom!

The Tiger Wing and the Divination Sword bounced off after a short contact.

Qin Yu’s right hand, which was holding the Tiger Wing, was trembling slightly. Moreover, many extremely deep wounds had appeared on his body.

Hua Tian’s power was stronger than his, and he was already heavily injured before he suppressed the Dusk Saber. This time, he was heavily injured again.

“What a terrifying Order of Rules! This consciousness even slightly suppressed my Great Expansion Divine Technique. What a terrifying opponent!”

Hua Tian was surprised. This was the first time he had faced Qin Yu’s Dusk Saber.

He felt that consciousness was like a fierce beast that suppressed the power of the Great Expansion Divine Technique before crazily attacking his sea of consciousness.

If Wu Tian’s black lotus had not blocked it, he would not have had such an easy time.

“No. I must kill you here today. Otherwise, how can I suppress you in the future once I get through this?” Hua Tian couldn’t help but shiver.

Buddha’s Light!

A ferocious-looking Buddha statue suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu. Its six arms struck out fiercely.

The fist that carried the power of the evil Buddha’s light slammed into Qin Yu’s body with invincible power, tearing his body apart again.

This was the move of the Evil Buddha. Hua Tian inherited the move after killing the Evil Buddha, Molou Shura, and obtained the Buddha prayer beads.

At this moment, taking advantage of Qin Yu’s heavy injuries, he used this move to kill Qin Yu once again.

“Hmm?”

However, Hua Tian keenly discovered that this time, the dreamy internal qi on Qin Yu’s body would only…

Qin Yu did not return to reality for a long time as if he was struggling on the edge of a dream.

In that dreamland, countless butterflies danced around Qin Yu.

He gritted his teeth and realized that he could not return to reality.

In his sea of consciousness, a voice kept telling him that this was where reality

was.

The sound of ravings was as if the person closest to him was whispering in his ear.

“Qin Yu, stay here. Please don’t leave me. I’m so tired.”

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes were filled with tears as she extended her hand towards him pitifully.

The light and shadow in front of him became even more blurry, almost making him unable to breathe.

“Slash!”

The Dusk Saber slashed fiercely in his sea of consciousness.

The intense pain in his divine soul made the light shadow disappear, and Qin Yu appeared in front of Hua Tian again.

He spat out another mouthful of blood. His back was still injured by the 64 swords.

“I’ve already reached my limit to use Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly. If I use it again, I’m afraid I’ll be lost in the dream forever.”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly..
