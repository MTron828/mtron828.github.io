Chapter 475: You Aren’t Qualified Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu stood up excitedly and said with some excitement, “Pavilion Master, is what you said true?”

Pavilion Master said indifferently, “What do you think?”

Qin Yu didn’t even know what to say for a moment.

He hurriedly bent down and said respectfully, “Thank you, Pavilion Master, your great kindness...”

“That’s enough.” The Pavilion Master interrupted Qin Yu’s words.

She sized up Qin Yu and said indifferently, “But I have a request.”

Qin Yu immediately nodded and said, “Let alone one request, ten requests will do!”

“Don’t be in a hurry to agree.” The Pavilion Master said with a nonchalant smile.

“This request isn’t simple.”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “Pavilion Master, you have helped me so much. Even if you want me to go up a mountain of knives or into a sea of fire, I’m willing to!”

Pavilion Master didn’t say anything more. She said indifferently, “There’s no rush. It’s still early. I’ll inform you when the time comes.”

“Okay!” Qin Yu nodded vigorously.

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something.

He hurriedly took out the Three Pure Ancient Tree and handed it to Pavilion Master.

“Lord Pavilion Master, this is a treasure I just obtained. It’s called the Three Pure Ancient Tree,” Qin Yu said.

A hint of surprise flashed in Pavilion Master’s eyes.

She took the Three Pure Ancient Tree and carefully examined it.

The Three Pure Ancient Tree in Pavilion Master’s hand flickered with an emerald green light, forming a sharp contrast with Pavilion Master’s fair and tender hand.

“It really is the Three Pure Ancient Tree.” Pavilion Master was even more surprised.

“You have to hide this thing well,” Pavilion Master said in a deep voice.

“Once word that you have it spreads, it will definitely attract disaster.”

Seeing the Pavilion Master’s serious expression, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent.

He hurriedly nodded and said, “Now, only the two of us know about this Three Pure Ancient Tree.”

At this point, Qin Yu said with some doubt, “Pavilion Master, do you know the origin of this Three Pure Ancient Tree?”

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment before dhe slowly said, “It is said that the Three Pure Ancient Tree is a divine tree used for cultivation.”

“This tree has an extremely strong growth rate, and its effects will increase as well.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After saying that, the Pavilion Master sized up the Three Pure Ancient Tree in Qin Yu’s hand and continued, “The tree in your hand is still in its embryonic form. There is a lot of room for it to grow in the future.”

Just an embryonic form had such an effect. If it grew and took shape, wouldn’t the effect be beyond imagination?!

“Put it away,” said the Pavilion Master.

“Remember my words. The Three Pure Ancient Tree can’t be known by a third person. Otherwise, it will definitely attract disaster.”

“When that time comes, I won’t be able to protect you.”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “I understand, Pavilion Master.”

Just as the two of them were conversing, an attendant suddenly ran over.

“Pavilion Master, Elder Qu of the Saint Confucian Sect requests to see you,” the attendant said softly.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “He’s here to look for me.”

The Pavilion Master wasn’t surprised. She glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Go and rest first. I’ll bring you to the warehouse tonight.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

Then, he said worriedly, “Lord Pavilion Master, be careful.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything. Her body was as light as a swallow as she jumped down from the pavilion.

...

In the hall, Elder Qu and a few disciples of the Saint Confucian Sect were sitting there drinking tea.

A few pharmacists beside them served tea and didn’t dare to be negligent.

At this moment, the Pavilion Master walked in.

Upon seeing the Pavilion Master, Elder Qu smiled nonchalantly and stood up while saying, “Greetings, Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

The Pavilion Master nodded, and then sat opposite Elder Qu. She went straight to the point and said, “Why has Elder Qu come to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

Elder Qu was silent for a moment, and then said, “Pavilion Master, I won’t beat around the bush with you. I’ve come this time to ask for someone.”

“Ask for someone?” Pavilion Master raised his brows.

Elder Qu nodded and said, “I know you favor Qin Yu, but Qin Yu destroyed an important treasure of our Saint Confucian Sect! I must take revenge!”

Pavilion Master took a sip of tea and said nothing.

Elder Qu continued, “Pavilion Master, I don’t know what relationship you have with Qin Yu, but Qin Yu is a troublemaker. If you keep him, he will bring disaster to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion sooner or later!”

The Pavilion Master finally raised her head.

She sized Elder Qu up and said, “Are you threatening me?”

Elder Qu didn’t directly answer this question. Instead, he said, “I know that Qin Yu is an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, but...”

“Since you know that he is an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, why did you come here to ask for him?” The Pavilion Master interrupted Elder Qu’s words.

Elder Qu’s expression immediately turned somewhat ugly.

“From your words, you don’t intend to hand him over?” Elder Qu said coldly.

When the Pavilion Master heard this, she said with a nonchalant smile, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion has never known what it means to hand someone over.”

Elder Qu immediately flew into a rage! He slammed the table and stood up!

He glared at the Pavilion Master angrily and said, “You better think this through! If you protect Qin Yu, you will not only offend me, but the entire Saint Confucian Sect!”

The Pavilion Master glanced at Elder Qu and said indifferently, “Let your sect master tell me this. You aren’t qualified.”
