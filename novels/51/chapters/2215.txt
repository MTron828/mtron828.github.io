2216 The Blood Sect

Gradually, the cultivators at the Moon Listening Pavilion noticed something not right.

Some discovered that while cultivating, the spiritual energy in the space was depleted without them knowing. A portion of the spiritual energy was even plundered from some cultivators who were absorbing the inner core.

“Who’s causing trouble!”

“Who’s cultivating? He’s actually depleted all the spiritual energy in the space.”

“What a domineering cultivation technique!”

…

Instantly, the cultivators in the entire Moon Listening Pavilion discussed animatedly.

The Traceless Immortal Scripture began to circulate wildly within Qin Yu’s body. Its speed became increasingly faster.

“Explode!”

Qin Yu felt he was only a step away from the third-grade True Saint realm.

He suddenly crushed 30 or so inner cores, and a stream of spiritual qi as thick as the liquid poured into Qin Yu’s head like a waterfall.

As time passed, lights were flowing on Qin Yu’s body. There was a fierce tiger-like force under his golden skin.

“Bang!”

Suddenly, the formation in front of his room was kicked hard and exploded.

Immediately after, the wooden door was kicked open.

“So, it’s you who’s robbing my demonic qi! How dare you!”

A drunk burly man walked in, supporting two women with his left and right hands.

Qin Yu was tremendously angry. This time, after comprehending the Traceless Immortal Scripture, his experience improved.

In this half a month, he had already entered a state of selflessness.

Given more time, he might have broken through directly.

Moreover, such a big commotion would probably cause him to go berserk.

“Get lost!”

Qin Yu kicked the burly man in the chest, sending him flying.

“Mr. Qin, leave quickly. He was a Demonic Beast, Xuan Ren. He had once obtained the blood of the divine beast, the black tortoise. He was almost invincible in Solitary Cloud City.”

Ji Yue looked solemn.

“Where are you going?”

Xuan Ren patted the dust off his body.

Then he slapped Qin Yu with his palm. Qin Yu reached out his hand to block the slap and firmly grabbed the wrist.

An enormous force came from his hand. Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

A fist smashed toward Xuan Ren’s head, but he blocked it with his palm.

“Crack!”

Even the people hundreds of meters away could hear the massive sound waves.

A violent storm exploded from the collision, directly shattering a few surrounding rooms.

“Interesting, interesting.”

One could actually encounter such an interesting scene in Solitary Cloud City.

A handsome and somewhat devilish man laughed in a nearby room.

Behind him, nearly 20 powerful cultivators were bow-standing like slaves.

Qin Yu’s clothes on his upper half body burst open. The muscles on his body were like calves, and the strength of his body completely exploded.

The two punched each other, and their fists clashed relentlessly, landing one after another on each other’s bodies as if without defenses and in a wild and frantic brawl. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Hahaha, it’s not bad that a human body can be cultivated to this level. However, it’s still far from the body of our Demonic Beasts.”

Xuan Ren laughed loudly. His wounds healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Shut up, Old Turtle. You’ve lived thousands of years and only have this much strength? Go home and feed the little turtles!”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“You’re courting death!”

Xuan Ren’s eyes shot out a cold light as his body suddenly expanded.

A chilling feeling instantly spread throughout Qin Yu’s entire body. Xuan Ren actually transformed into half of his true body.

Its gigantic body size directly blew up six or seven floors.

A claw that carried the terrifying power of a mountain was about to smack Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to activate his holy body.

He would probably be smashed into a meat pie if he did not use his spiritual power.

Hmm?

Xuan Ren forcefully retracted the claw and then the true body.

“Hmph, you’re lucky, Kid. I activated my true body and attracted the attention of those few Asura in Solitary Cloud City.”

Xuan Ren snorted coldly.

Qin Yu only felt a massive divine thought sweep past in an instant. The feeling was like when he was facing the tribulation cultivator from the Black Platform Continent previously. In fact, it was even more ruthless and terrifying.

A cold sweat appeared on his head. If he had used his spiritual power just now, he felt that this massive divine thought could even kill him with just a thought.

“Old Turtle, just you wait. I will definitely take revenge for you ruined my cultivation today.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“Arrogant Brat, I’ll remember you.”

Xuan Ren was furious. He could not stand being called an old turtle.

“Not bad, Kid. You’re actually on par with Xuan Ren with just your physical strength.”

Ji Yue walked over with an unconcealable surprise on her face.

Almost no one in Solitary Cloud City dared to provoke Xuan Ren. He was a tortoise who had cultivated for nearly 5,000 years. Coupled with the black tortoise bloodline, even True Saint Realm cultivators could not fight him. He did not expect to have been defeated one day.

“Old Turtle, I’ll kill it one day.”

Qin Yu snorted coldly and said.

“He also has many Demonic Beasts yielded to him. You’re too high-profile. You’ve only been here for a while but have already offended so many people.”

Ji Yue said maliciously.

“Kid, you’re not bad. I’ll take you in.”

The devilish young man walked out.

“Young Lord Zong Yue of Blood Sect,” Ji Yue bent slightly, greeted, and turned to leave.

“Are there any benefits? For example, one or two ten-thousand-year-old herbs or something similar?”

Qin Yu was delighted.

This person had quite an imposing manner. The cultivation of the cultivators following behind him was not low, but they were bow-standing throughout, appearing very respectful.

“There are no benefits, but I can let you be the beast for my transportation. Your physical body seems just right for carrying me around. If you agree, I won’t pursue the matter of you stealing my spiritual energy for the past month.”

Zong Yue said with a smile.

“Why don’t you get your mother to carry you?”

Qin Yu had seen arrogant people before but not such an arrogant person.

“It’s a pity that you don’t seize the opportunity.”

Zong Yue wiped his lips with his hand and licked them lightly.

A powerful soul aura suddenly rushed out of the sea of consciousness of a nearby cultivator like a knife and stabbed into Qin Yu’s head. Almost at the same time, another fourth-grade True Saint aura erupted, and the gigantic axe in his hand slashed at Qin Yu’s body.

A divine thought swept past, and the two were instantly wiped out.

“You run quite fast, but where can you run to? Our Blood Sect has endless manpower. In this Solitary Cloud City, with each person delivering a strike, what can you do with your strong physical body?”

Zong Yue chuckled.

“Search.”

“Young Lord, we can’t find him. He must have some treasures that conceal his internal qi, and it was of a high level.” An elderly man shook his head. His vast divine sense reached out but found nothing.

“Trash!”

Zong Yue’s expression changed as he slapped the elderly man’s face.

The elderly man trembled as he knelt, not daring to resist at all.

At this moment, in Solitary Cloud City, a person overflowing with demonic qi was strolling around like he was shopping. Qin Yu used the pearl he had previously obtained from the black-striped Tiger King to avoid the elderly man’s search.

A massive gash was slashed across his chest, and blood dripped down his body.

An attack from a fourth-grade True Saint with all his might, and he only resisted using his physical strength. This was shocking enough.
