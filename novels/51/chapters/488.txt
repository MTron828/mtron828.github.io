Chapter 489: Consummate Realm Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Standing in the empty warehouse, Qin Yu was surprised to find that the surrounding spiritual energy had almost disappeared.

In other words, the entire warehouse’s spiritual energy had almost been completely absorbed by Qin Yu.

He clenched his fist and felt the power surging from all over his body. His eyes couldn’t help but flash with a trace of joy.

“This... This is the power of a half-step Martial Marquis?” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that this power was at least tens of times stronger than before!

“Something’s wrong.”

But very quickly, Qin Yu realized that something wasn’t right.

Although his strength had been greatly increased, it seemed that he hadn’t reached the edge of the Martial Marquis realm.

Even though the half-step Martial Marquis realm wasn’t a clear realm, he could feel the power of a true Martial Marquis. It was a realm above the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm.

However, Qin Yu still felt that he was in the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm.

On the contrary, Qin Yu couldn’t sense the feeling of reaching the Martial Marquis realm at all.

“Could it be... that I’m still in the Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm?” Qin Yu’s brows furrowed tightly.

“But my strength has indeed increased by tens to nearly a hundred times.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something.

His pupils constricted, and he muttered in a low voice, “Could it be that I have reached the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster realm?”

The probability of such a realm appearing was extremely low, and the probability was less than 0.01% .

However, there were rumors that at the peak of the realm, those who had reached the consummate realm were all geniuses.

In the future, the path of cultivation would be filled with many obstacles. However, once one reached the consummate realm, they would be invincible in the world.

If one wanted to cross the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster stage, they would need a sliver of opportunity.

For example, a certain pill or some fortuitous encounter.

“The Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster stage...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

There seemed to be a thin line between him and a half-step Martial Marquis.

However, Qin Yu could feel the surging power within his body!

This power was definitely not weaker than an ordinary half-step Martial Marquis’. In fact, it was much stronger!

“The Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster realm is enough,” Qin Yu said coldly.

With his current strength, Qin Yu was confident that he could kill someone like He Teng within three seconds!

For a moment, Qin Yu didn’t know whether it was a blessing or a curse.

At the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm, Qin Yu had surpassed the half-step Martial Marquis Realm.

How strong would he be when he stepped into the true half-step Martial Marquis realm?

He didn’t dare to imagine!

Qin Yu couldn’t feel the passage of time in this warehouse.

Therefore, he didn’t know when the door would open.

The door couldn’t be opened by brute force, so Qin Yu could only wait.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and began to search through his inherited memories while trying to find a way to break through from the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm.

Soon, traces of memories entered Qin Yu’s mind.

A pill called the “Reincarnation Pill” entered his eyes.

“The Reincarnation Pill requires five thousand year-old herbs, three demon beast inner cores, and eight thousand year-old herbs...”

Seeing this pill formula, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel dumbstruck!

This pill formula was a little too ridiculous!

Up until now, Qin Yu had never seen five thousand year-old herbs!

Not only that, but the Reincarnation Pills also had extremely high requirements for alchemists. It required two alchemists who possessed purple spirit fire to refine it at the same time! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Just this alone had already stumped most people!

“Two alchemists with purple spiritual fire... Fortunately, the Pavilion Master also has purple spiritual fire,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

This way, the most difficult thing was to find five thousand year-old herbs.

“Looks like I’ll have to trouble the Pavilion Master again.” Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

Qin Yu stood up and looked at the herbs in the warehouse.

Because of Qin Yu’s absorption of spiritual energy, the herbs in the entire warehouse had almost withered.

This also made Qin Yu feel a trace of guilt.

He didn’t know how much trouble he had brought to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion ever since he came to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

The Pavilion Master’s wholehearted help to him made him feel immense gratitude.

Without the help of the Pavilion Master, Qin Yu didn’t know how long it would take for him to step into the perfection realm.

Although he didn’t step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, with his current realm, dealing with Han Wei was no problem at all. Qin Yu laughed coldly.

He put away the Three Pure Ancient Tree and quietly waited for the warehouse door to open.

...

Outside, the First Elder was holding his daily lecture.

He knew very clearly inside that these pharmacists simply didn’t accept him.

Therefore, he had to brainwash them every day and use both kindness and coercion.

At noon on this day, the First Elder gathered all the alchemists in the square.

He swept his gaze over everyone and said indifferently, “Ji Yuhong has already become a thing of the past, and I am the second-generation Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion! Those who obey me will naturally be rewarded, but there is only one outcome for those who do not obey me!”

Before he finished speaking, two people dragged a half-dead old man over.

This old man was none other than the Second Elder!

His entire body was covered in blood and his internal qi was weak. It was a tragic sight to behold.

“Second Elder!” Someone immediately shouted from below!

The First Elder extended his palm and caught the Second Elder in his own hand.

“Since I am the New Pavilion Master, disobeying me is equivalent to betraying the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” The First Elder said coldly.

“I won’t tolerate traitors!”

After saying this, the First Elder grabbed the Second Elder’s wrist and suddenly exerted force!

“Crack!”

The enormous force actually directly crushed the Second Elder’s hand!

Blood and shattered bones fell under the First Elder’s feet.

Painful wails reverberated in the square for a long time!

“This is the ending! If you refuse to obey me, I will continue to enforce the rules!” The First Elder said coldly.

Below, everyone had ugly expressions and no one made a sound.

Even though they hated the First Elder to the core, there was nothing they could do.

The First Elder snickered. “You all are dismissed!”

After the First Elder left, everyone hurriedly ran to the Second Elder.

“Second Elder, are you alright...”

“Quick, refine medicine for the Second Elder to stop the bleeding!”

The Second Elder gritted his teeth and waved his hand.

He said in a low voice, “Tomorrow morning, Qin Yu will come out of seclusion... when he comes out, he definitely won’t spare the First Elder...”

When everyone heard this, they subconsciously looked in the direction of the warehouse.

“Send me to the door of the warehouse. I want to see Qin Yu come out of seclusion with my own eyes...” The Second Elder said with difficulty.

No one dared to say anything more. They hurriedly helped Second Elder to the door of the warehouse.

...

At night, the Second Elder sat alone at the entrance of the warehouse.

“Second Elder, are you alright?”

At this moment, the Fifth Elder walked over.

After seeing the Fifth Elder, Second Elder snorted coldly and said, “Why don’t you hurry to curry favor with the new Pavilion Master and protect your position? Why did you come here?”

The Fifth Elder smiled bitterly and said, “Second Elder, you misunderstood me. I want to kill him! The reason why I did this was to save the lives of those alchemists...”

“If all the alchemists leave, then the Divine Alchemist Pavilion... will really be disbanded.”

The Second Elder frowned sand said with some suspicion, “Is what you said true?”

“It’s absolutely true! I swear!” the Fifth Elder said with a bitter smile.

The Second Elder opened his mouth and was about to say something when a sound suddenly came from the door of the warehouse.

Then, the restrictive power on the door disappeared, and the door slowly opened.

“Huh? It opened in advance?” The Second Elder was stunned, then he was overjoyed!
