Chapter 258: Excited Xiao Yu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu sized up the young man and found him unfamiliar.

“Do we know each other?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

Yang Zhao sneered. “Why? Are you pretending not to know me? Didn’t you drive that shabby Rs7?”

When he heard this, Qin Yu finally remembered.

This kid was the one who drove the M 3 on the highway.

“Yang Zhao, do you know him?” Xiao Mi asked in surprise.

Yang Zhao snorted. “He’s just a coward. I don’t know him.”

When she heard Yang Zhao’s words, Xiao Mi became even more excited.

She pulled Xiao Yu and said, “Did you hear that? Yang Zhao said that he’s a coward. How could he know Yang Jing?”

“Exactly. How famous is Yang Jing? He can’t even brag convincingly,” Xiao Mi snorted.

Xiao Yu glared at them and said, “What are you guys talking about? You’re a coward. If you dare to talk nonsense again, I’ll tear your mouth apart!”

Such an intense reaction naturally startled Yang Zhao and Xiao Mi.

“No way, Xiao Yu. Why are you so angry?” Yang Zhao scratched his head and said.

“Get lost. Do I know you very well?” Xiao Yu said angrily.

Yang Zhao was embarrassed by the continuous curses.

He narrowed his eyes and said fiercely, “Your father has already retired. What is there for you to be arrogant about? Who made you so spoiled?”

Xiao Yu cursed, “F * ck you! So what if he’s retired? I look down on you even after he’s retired. You are a piece of sh * t!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After saying that, Xiao Yu pulled Qin Yu’s arm and said, “Let’s go. Let’s not lower ourselves to their level!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t you want to watch the concert?”

“If you don’t want to watch it, then don’t. What’s there to be arrogant about?” Xiao Yu said angrily.

Qin Yu patted Xiao Yu’s head and said, “Alright, wait here for a while. Yang Jing will be here in a while.”

“Still bragging? I want to see how you’re going to call Yang Jing over,” Xiao Mi snorted.

Xiao Yu seemed to be a little anxious.

She pulled Qin Yu and whispered, “If you can’t get in, you can’t get in. Don’t brag! This place is full of her fans. How could she come here?”

“Don’t worry. Yang Jing’s camouflage skills are... well, top-notch.”

Qin Yu thought of the situation when Yang Jing came to find him and couldn’t help but praise her.

Time passed minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, more than ten minutes had passed.

“The concert is about to start. Why isn’t Yang Jing here yet?” Yang Zhao seemed to be a little impatient.

“Yang Zhao, he must be bragging. Shall we go in?” Xiao Mi blinked her eyes and said.

Yang Zhao said proudly, “Of course, no problem! Come, let’s go in!”

“Xiao Yu, if you coax Yang Zhao well, maybe you can go in too,” Xiao Mi said sarcastically.

Xiao Yu was livid, but she had no way to retort.

“She’s here.”

At this moment, Qin Yu saw a woman who was dressed very strangely walking over.

This time, she was dressed even more exaggeratedly. She wore a shabby hat on her head and a shabby mask over her face.

No one would have thought that this would be the star that they were obsessed with.

“Who’s here?” Xiao Yu asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu pointed at the “shabby hat” not far away and said, “Yang Jing is here.”

“Hahaha! I’m dying of laughter!” Xiao Mi laughed exaggeratedly.

“Are you kidding? Yang Jing is a stunner. How could she be dressed like this?” Yang Zhao also sneered.

Qin Yu ignored them and just waited quietly.

Soon, Yang Jing came from not far away.

She ran in front of Qin Yu and said cautiously, “Let’s go. I’ll take you to the VIP Passage.”

“Hey, stop.” At this time, Yang Zhao stopped Yang Jing.

Yang Jing frowned and said, “What’s the matter?”

Yang Zhao sneered. “Who are you trying to fool by being dressed like this? Take off your scarf for me to see.”

“Why do you want me to take it off? Why should I listen to you?” Yang Jing said with a cold expression.

“Hehe, if you don’t take it off, it proves that you’re fake. It proves that Xiao Yu is lying!” Yang Zhao shouted.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Don’t bother with them. They’re just idiots.”

Yang Jing was angry. She looked around to make sure no one was paying attention to her. Then, she took off the disguise over her face.

Under the scarf, it was indeed Yang Jing.

“It... It really is Yang Jing?” Xiao Mi swallowed hard and was dumbfounded.

“Wow, Yang Jing, I like you very much!” Xiao Yu also shouted excitedly.

Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Keep your voice down. Don’t let anyone hear you.”

Only then did Xiao Yu react and she quickly covered her mouth.

Yang Jing put on her scarf and said with a dark expression, “I don’t like you very much, and I don’t want you to enter the venue.”

Yang Zhao’s expression suddenly changed, and Xiao Mi felt even more regretful!

So, the two of them couldn’t enter?

Viciousness flashed across Yang Zhao’s face, then he gritted his teeth and shouted, “Yang Jing, she...”

“Pa!”

Before Yang Zhao could finish his sentence, Qin Yu smashed his back teeth.

Half of his face swelled up.

“Do you want to cause a stampede?” Qin Yu glanced at Yang Jing coldly.

Just as Qin Yu had guessed, Yang Zhao wanted to tell everyone that Yang Jing was here!

At that time, the fanatical fans would definitely cause a stampede! Yang Jing might not survive it!

Yang Zhao, his face full of anger, covered his face! But he couldn’t say a word.

“Let’s hurry up and leave.” Yang Jing tugged at Qin Yu’s arm.

Qin Yu nodded.

And so, the few of them walked towards the VIP passage.

Those who could walk through this passage were either their insiders or good friends in the social circle.

Along the way, Xiao Yu was excited and kept expressing her love for Yang Jing.

Then, Xiao Yu said excitedly, “Well done, Qin Yu. I didn’t expect you to really know her! I underestimated you!”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Okay, stop talking nonsense. Hurry up and go in.”

After sending Xiao Yu in, Yang Jing looked at Qin Yu and said with a derisive tone, “I didn’t expect you to like this kind of girl. What, are you robbing the cradle?”

“Don’t talk nonsense. She can only be considered my sister,” Qin Yu said helplessly.

“Oh, really? Sister?” Yang Jing snorted.

“None of your business,” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

“You!” Yang Jing was so angry that she gritted her teeth, but there was nothing she could do.

“Forget it. I can’t be bothered with you. I have to get my makeup done,” Yang Jing said.

“Oh right, I have reserved a seat for you,” Yang Jing said before she left.

Qin Yu calculated the time. This concert would take two hours.

Since he had nothing to do, he might as well go in and take a look.

Therefore, Qin Yu walked into the venue and found a place to sit down.
