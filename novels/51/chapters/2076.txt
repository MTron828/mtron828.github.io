2077 Three True Saints

The news kept pouring out. For a moment, everyone in the Holy Region was anxious and panicking.

“Have you heard the news? The Si family has even hunted down Dean Lei’s closed-door disciples, and their fate remains unknown at this point!”

“And that Xiao Hai, who has a closed relationship with Qin Yu, that cultivation genius, has also disappeared.”

“Whoever dares to provoke the Si family will now be trampled to the ground instantly.”

The crowd discussed non-stop, and the Si family did not intend to end its pursuit. Instead, it became even more intense.

In the Jiang family, Holy Son Jiang stood on the mountain peak with his hands behind his back. Using the treasure to cover tens of thousands of stars, he could see waves of people from the Si family swarming out.

“It’s troublesome now. I’m afraid the Si family is going to break the balance,” Holy Son Jiang murmured.

In Cold Moon Palace, Saintess Gu and Yao Xi sat opposite each other.

“Do you think we’ll be dragged into the Si family’s storm this time?” Yao Xi took a sip of tea and said softly.

Saintess Gu shook her head with a smile as she played the zither. “I’m afraid it’s hard to say. The Si family’s goal now is to involve all of us. After all, if the Traceless Immortal Scripture really falls into Qin Yu’s hands, Qin Yu will be the target of public criticism. When the time comes, I’m afraid we, the nine great aristocratic families, will have to gang up.”

“That’s true.” Yao Xi nodded. ” Over the years, all the treasures in the Holy Region have fallen into our hands. This time should not be an exception.”

Saintess Gu did not say much about this. She just quietly played the zither and drank tea.

…

On Peach Blossom Island.

This place was named as such because the island was full of birds and flowers, and the scenery was beautiful.

However, as far as the eye could see, Peach Blossom Island was surrounded by endless black water. It was incomparably desolate.

“Cough, cough…”

On the island, a pale young man stood on the shore, looking at the endless black water.

On Peach Blossom Island, he could almost possess everything he wanted but lost his freedom. He did not know if it was fortunate or sad.

“Your Highness, rumor has it that Qin Yu has gotten the Traceless Immortal Scripture,” an elderly man walked up to the prince, bowed, and said.

The prince did not show much emotion. He said slowly, “The Traceless Immortal Scripture has finally surfaced.”

“The Traceless Immortal Scripture is an incomparable supreme legend.” The prince intentionally ignored the elderly man’s words.

Seeing this, the elderly man did not say anything else and could only slowly retreat to his back.

The prince’s face looked even paler. He looked at the black water that filled the sky and said in a low voice, “The balance among the nine great aristocratic families… might be broken now.”

…

In Dragon Burial Cave.

More and more powerful internal qi appeared in Donghuang.

Xiao Sheng, who had an incredibly sharp divine sense, naturally noticed this change.

He sat cross-legged near the Dragon Burial Cave like a stone man, not moving at all. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Swish…”

A breeze blew past, and dark clouds seemed to float in the sky.

However, upon closer look, it was not a cloud but dense and endless human figures!

They blotted out the sky and the sun, causing people to tremble in fear!

Xiao Sheng’s eyes opened slightly. Looking up at the uninvited guests, his eyes still exuded incomparable indifference.

“Three True Saints…” Xiao Sheng murmured as if he was talking about something very ordinary.

Soon, the people of the Si family arrived above Dragon Burial Cave.

Si Qianjing was leading the group, and the one following him was the elderly man who followed Si Shifeng when Qi Yu killed him that day.

They were wearing long robes, but they could not hide their almost withered bodies.

Their faces were almost bloodless, and their skin was like dried tree trunks, full of gullies.

“Qin Yu is actually hiding in Dragon Burial Cave,” Si Qianjing said quietly with his hands behind his back.

“Perhaps we should consider attacking straight away,” a True Saint beside him said coldly.

Si Qianjing did not say anything.

He would not take action until a critical moment. After all, they were not True Saints at the peak. Every time they took action, it meant that their lifespan would decrease. If he were to fight with all his might, he might even die on the spot.

Si Qianjing looked down for a long time, then said coldly, “Qin Yu, come out!”

The voice was not loud, but it clearly entered everyone’s ears!

The voice seemed to be coming from his body. It was very soft but extremely ear-piercing!

Everyone in Donghuang was shocked by this voice. They rushed over and looked up at the massive and mighty army!

“What’s going on? Someone has stepped into our Donghuang!”

“Why did you come to our Donghuang without greeting us? Could it be that someone is interested in our territory?”

“Go and look for Lord Donghuang!”

In the Dragon Burial Cave, Qin Yu was also awakened by this voice!

At this moment, his body was surrounded by a faint light. Under the protection of this light, Qin Yu could almost cultivate in the Dragon Burial Cave.

However, the prerequisite was Qin Yu must have enough dragon blood. Only by relying on dragon blood could Qin Yu be safe and sound in this Dragon Burial Cave.

“The people from the Si family are finally here,” Qin Yu murmured. He could sense the three tremendously formidable internal qi. The Holy Power emitted from their bodies was even more terrifying.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “I don’t think they can enter Dragon Burial Cave. I have the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror and Wu Ji’s clothes on me. I should be able to protect myself in Dragon Burial Cave.”

For an existence like Wu Ji, even the internal qi after death around him could give birth to life, not to mention the clothes he was wearing. It was almost equivalent to a secret treasure.

“Qin Yu, hand over the thing, and we’ll leave your corpse intact.” Si Qianjing’s voice sounded in everyone’s ears again.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. Then he sneered and said, “Looks like they already knew it. Dream on if they want me to go out!”

Si Qianjing shouted three times from outside, but there was still no response coming from the Dragon Burial Cave.

At this moment, a potbellied elderly man suddenly stepped into the void and stood in front of Si Qianjing.

The elderly man bowed slightly to Si Qianjing and said with a faint smile, “May I know who you are, and why you’re making a big fuss to come to Donghuang?”

Si Qianjing frowned slightly, a hint of displeasure flashing across his eyes.

“Who are you?” the cultivator beside Si Qianjing frowned and said.

“I’m incapable, but people call me Lord Donghuang,” the elderly man said indifferently. “Looking at your attire, I guess you are not ordinary people. But you should at least greet me when you come to Donghuang, shouldn’t you?”
