“How could it be? How could he use the Way of Yin and Yang?”

Ji Ao’s eyes widened.

Even though he had the Five Emperor Coins to protect his soul, he could barely use this move. Qin Yu’s Way of Yin and Yang was even more powerful than his.

“All!” The Supreme Elder revealed a crazed expression.

His body started to tremble crazily. In the next second, he suddenly stopped roaring, and a strange smile appeared on his face.

An elder of the Ji Family beside him suddenly grabbed his soul and swallowed it.

The cultivators of the Ji family instantly screamed in fear. They did not understand why their Supreme Elder suddenly attacked them.

The Way of Yin and Yang was a sword strike from the Evil Eye Ghostly Sword that wielded the power of both realms. The most terrifying thing was its power of transformation. With a slash, that Supreme Elder was controlled.

“Awesome! I’m finally out!”

With a move of his body, he slashed an elder of the Ji family into halves with the ghostly sword.

In an instant, this elder of the Tribulation Second Level instantly turned into a dried human.

All the spiritual energy in his body was sucked dry.

“Awesome!”

“Boom!” Qin Yu’s body turned into a ghost, reaping the lives of the Ji family members like a death god.

Pfft! He had only managed to absorb this little bit of chaotic power after such a long time, but it was enough!

Qin Yu raised his hands, and suddenly weather in the sky changed. Lightning that blotted out the sky and covered the earth swam in the entire Ji family.

“Nine Heavens Divine Lightning Level Two, explode!”

With a loud bang, the massive power of thunder and lightning pierced through downward. Countless ordinary people and cultivators below the True Saints of the Ji family were instantly killed by this stormy divine thunder.

This attack had killed at least hundreds of thousands of the members of the Ji family.

“Suck! Traceless Demonic Scripture!”

Qin Yu’s mouth curled into a sinister smile.

Amidst the crisp shattering sound, countless souls and spiritual energy entered like an ocean into the body of Qin Yu, who laughed maniacally. These souls howled miserably as if crying for Qin Yu’s mercy. However, before the overbearing Traceless Demonic Scripture, they all turned into the purest spiritual energy and entered Qin Yu’s body.

“Qin Yu, you beast! These are all ordinary people from the Ji family. They don’t have any cultivation at all. Why did you kill them? If you cultivate this evil attack, the entire human race will not let you off.”

Ji Ao shouted. Although these hundreds of thousands of people had low cultivations, many were very close to them.

“Why?” Qin Yu’s looked somewhat confused.

“I feel better this way!

“Come over here!”

Qin Yu grabbed the Supreme Elder in his hand and stabbed his finger into the neck of the Ji family’s Supreme Elder with a sinister smile.

In an instant, all the Tribulation Third Level cultivation entered Qin Yu’s body in a few breaths.

Qin Yu licked the blood on his hand and let out a satisfied burp.

“Still, the power of the Tribulation Third Level Soul Sinking tastes better!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Today, you inhumane little bastard will die here.”

The five enormous copper coins behind Ji Changhong floated up and slowly changed.

Five Great Emperors were formed. The power of holiness, might, and justice surged from their bodies.

That power instantly pressed down on Qin Yu’s body. It was like ice meeting the scorching sun. The demonic sword on Qin Yu’s body was suppressed.

His black soul was also injured. This power was the nemesis of all darkness and evil.

Ji Tianming’s body moved, and the power of the ancestor of sorcery’s protection was activated to the limit. The throne in the sky released power again.

All of them entered his body, and his muscles let out exaggerated sounds. In an instant, his body’s strength had already rushed to the Peak of Third Level.

“Thump!”

A punch directly exploded on Qin Yu’s head. That speed was so fast that even divine sense could not capture it.

Almost at the same instant, Qin Yu sensed that something was wrong.

He waved his hands and instantly pulled Ji Ao and Ji Yuyi to his front.

“D*mn it!”

Ji Tianming cursed and forcefully smashed his fist onto the ground.

“Boom!”

This punch directly shattered the ground, and hundreds of thousands of feet of the ground were directly smashed into powder by this blow.

The underground water rose to the sky, and the Ji family instantly turned into a flowing ocean.

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu stabbed his hands into their necks and was about to break their heads.

“Freeze!”

Ji Changhong’s expression changed drastically. He activated the Five Emperor Coins to the extreme and froze Qin Yu on the spot.

“Slash!”

Ji Tianming roared and wanted to cut off Qin Yu’s arms with a hand knife.

Qin Yu could only withdraw his hand and let go of the two of them.

Qin Yu revealed a sinister smile as he activated the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

Ji Ao’s and Ji Yuyi’s souls suddenly exploded in Ji Tianming’s hands.

“Ji Ao!!”

Ji Changhong let out a miserable scream. He could not believe that the situation could turn upside down in an instant.

In this moment of relaxation for the mind, Qin Yu slashed out his ghostly sword again.

“The Way of Yin and Yang!”

The 300,000 souls condensed near the Evil Eye’s sword body suddenly exploded on Ji Changhong’s body.

Ji Changhong’s eyes suddenly froze. The power of this sword had gathered more than 300,000 souls of the Ji family.

And the most formidable combat power of a hundred or so. Ji Changhong was instantly controlled the moment the Way of Yin and Yang erupted.

“Go!”

Ji Changhong’s body turned into a stream of light and suddenly crashed toward Ji Tianming.

“Boom!”

Ji Tianming closed his eyes and punched Ji Changhong. He instantly seemed to have aged a thousand years.

The Ghostly Sword Evil Eye was not something that ordinary people could control. If they did not have the Five Emperor Coins, even he would not be able to control Evil Eye. He did not expect Qin Yu to have a dark divine sense in his body. And that divine sense and the Evil Eye were a perfect match.

“How could the Supreme Elder of the Ji family kill his family head?”

Qin Yu burst into laughter.

“Qin Yu, I, Ji Tianming, will watch you like a maggot in my lifetime. I will kill everyone related to you! Leave nothing behind!”

Ji Tianming roared at the sky, tears dripping down his old cheeks and onto the ground.

“Shut up, you’re so noisy.”

Qin Yu completely ignored this old fellow.

As he opened his arms, his body had already turned into a violent black hole. The Traceless Demonic Scripture was released again.

The remaining spiritual energy, divine sense, and all the vitality in the space entered Qin Yu’s body.

The entire space instantly became a land of death!

Amidst the violent suction, the restrictions on the Ji family’s treasure vault suddenly burst open. Countless pills and treasures were sucked into Qin Yu’s body, then turned into gravel without any spiritual energy and fell out.

“Awesome!”

Northern Underworld! Heaven and Earth! Connecting with wood! Star absorption! Soul-collecting!

Suddenly, his body made a loud noise. Behind his head, five fist-sized stars suddenly formed.

The moment they appeared, the vast power of the stars exploded.

These were the five stars with the strongest suction force in the Traceless Demonic Scripture.

Ji Tianming’s expression changed drastically. He instantly felt that his soul began to become somewhat unstable. The violent suction force even wanted to suck his soul out..
