Chapter 1279: Chapter 1,279, the Genius of the Heavenly Cloud sect 

Qin Yu was also quite curious about Jin Lun.

He did not know what kind of person Jin Lun was. He only knew that he was very strong and was known as the Hunter King.

However, the performance of his subordinates today had greatly damaged his impression of Qin Yu.

Guan Zhuang and Jing Bai brought the equipment back to the equipment warehouse. Many hunters came to collect the equipment one after another.

“Eh? Dragon Horn Bow? The equipment this time seems to be a little different.”

“This is... Blazing Sun Sword? This blazing sun sword seems to be quite expensive.”

“Quick, look, this is bloodthirsty frenzied sword! Holy Sh * t, this time the group leader is letting out blood?”

Jing Bai also looked at Guan Zhuang suspiciously, as if waiting for Guan Zhuang’s explanation.

Guan Zhuang waved his hand and said, “Qin Yu personally paid 200,000 yuan to update the equipment for everyone.”

“Qin Yu? F * ck, so generous?”

“As far as I know, he doesn’t seem to need any equipment at all.”

“TSK TSK, this is the first time I’ve seen a hunter spending his own money to upgrade our equipment. Such dedication really makes me admire him.”

After this move, Qin Yu’s reputation in the hunter organization rose again.

To Qin Yu, this was completely unexpected.

He only felt that he had earned a lot of money, and it didn’t matter if he spent a little. He didn’t expect to have unexpected gains.

Qin Yu stayed in his room, holding the deity refining clothes in his hand, and began to study it carefully.

The deity refining clothes flickered with an extremely strange light. Under the cover of this light, the entire deity refining clothes looked faintly discernible, extremely mystical.

“This really is a treasure.”

Qin Yu touched the spirit refinement garment and only felt a trace of coldness.

Just as Qin Yu was studying the spirit refinement garment, Gu City had already smelled information related to Qin Yu.

After all, Qin Yu had played in Gu City’s largest market for a day. Now that the wanted notice had been issued, many people ran to the imperial palace to report it.

Looking at the news that kept coming up, the city Lord’s brows furrowed even more tightly.

There was no other reason. The place that these people had told him about was long gone.

This meant that Qin Yu had already left Gu city long ago and had lost all information again.

Ling Yun sat in the seat that should have belonged to him. His expression became even colder.

That icy killing intent made even the city lord feel uncomfortable.

He had heard of this genius youth.

Rumor has it that this person was extremely cruel. He had killed countless people at such a young age and loved to massacre the entire city. He didn’t spare anyone, from the elderly to the children.

Countless people had scolded him behind his back for such cruel actions.

However, he was the precious Babe of the Heavenly Cloud sect. No one dared to provoke him.

“Are you people from Gu City all trash?”Ling Yun’s fingers tapped on the table. Every strike seemed to strike the hearts of everyone.

The city Lord said in a deep voice, “Don’t worry. Since he has been to Gu City, we will definitely find information related to him.”

Ling Yun stood up at this moment and said slowly, “I have lost my patience.”

These words undoubtedly made everyone nervous.

The city lord frowned and said, “What do you want?”

Ling Yun opened his mouth and was about to speak when someone suddenly reported loudly from outside.

“City Lord, someone claims to know about Qin Yu!”A Spy rushed in hurriedly.

The city Lord’s eyes lit up as he hurriedly said, “Let him in quickly!”

A few minutes later.

Accompanied by a few heavy soldiers, a middle-aged man dressed in a brocade cannon walked in.

This middle-aged man was none other than the owner of the stone gambling shop!

After entering the palace, he knelt in front of the city lord with a “Plop”sound.

“Greetings, City Lord,”the owner of the stone gambling shop said with a trembling voice.

The city Lord said anxiously, “You said that you’ve seen Qin Yu? where is he?”

The owner of the stone gambling shop didn’t dare to hide anything. He immediately told the city lord what had happened.

“That Qin Yu came with someone named Guan Zhuang. I reckon that he’s from the hunter organization,”the owner of the stone gambling shop said.

“Hunter organization? I see.”Ling Yun narrowed his eyes and couldn’t help but sneer.

“Do you think that I can’t do anything to you just because you hid in the hunter organization?”

The city Lord said in a deep voice, “Young Master Ling, this hunter organization isn’t like other organizations. It’s best to be careful. As far as I know, they are very protective. It Won’t be easy for them to hand you over.”

Ling Yun glanced at the city lord and said coldly, “Are you teaching me how to do things?”

The city Lord opened his mouth and smiled bitterly. “I don’t dare.”

Ling Yun snorted coldly and stood up immediately. “Let’s go to the hunter organization.”

“Young Master Ling!”

However, at this moment, the stone gambling shop owner suddenly called out to Ling Yun.

He smiled sheepishly and said, “I’ve helped the Heavenly Cloud sect so much. I wonder if there’s any reward...”

Ling Yun’s long and narrow eyes narrowed when he heard that.

A tense atmosphere quickly rose in the great hall.

Everyone had a bad feeling, but the owner of the stone gambling shop was the only one who didn’t understand.

“You want a reward?”Ling Yun asked coldly.

The owner of the stone gambling shop smiled sheepishly. “It’s naturally best if there’s any reward...”

Ling Yun nodded slightly. He looked at the owner and sneered, “Alright, then I’ll satisfy you.”

Before he could finish his sentence, Ling Yun’s finger suddenly stretched out and a ray of light shot out from his fingertip!

This ray of light was extremely fast. In an instant, it pierced through the forehead of the owner! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Fresh blood spilled onto the red carpet.

The owner of the stone gambling shop fell straight down.

Ling Yun looked down at the corpse and said calmly, “You can only take what I give you.”

After saying that, Ling Yun turned around and left.

He brought the three almighty experts and rushed towards the hunter organization.
