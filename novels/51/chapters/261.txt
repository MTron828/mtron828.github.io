Chapter 262: Gu Taichu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After Qin Yu returned home, he quietly waited for Gu Taichu’s arrival.

According to the agreement, Gu Taichu would arrive in Chuzhou the next day to take revenge for his disciple.

“Mr. Qin, Gu Taichu is saying that he will give you one last day,” Yao Qing said in a sullen voice.

“This matter has become a hot topic on the Internet,” Yao Qing said with a frown.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked in surprise, “On the Internet?”

“Yes.” Yao Qing took the phone and handed it to Qin Yu.

After Qin Yu took it, he found that the screen showed a web called the martial arts forum.

“Martial arts forum... I’ve never heard of it,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Yao Qing explained, “This is the official forum of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and also the gathering place of this community.”

“Basically, whatever happens, it will be the first to be posted on this forum.”

Then, Yao Qing pointed to a post at the top and said, “This is the news from Gu Taichu.”

Qin Yu opened it and took a look. He saw Gu Taichu threatening to get rid of Qin Yu.

The Jiang Bei region covered many provinces and could be said to be a place full of people with hidden potential.

Even Gu Taichu couldn’t be ranked first in the Jiang Bei region.

Updates by

Because there were too many hidden top-notch martial artists in the Jiang Bei region.

Qin Yu opened the thread and took a look. Countless people were commenting below.

“Qin Yu is indeed extremely arrogant. He is younger, but he is actually so cocky.”

“You can’t say that. One must have a backbone. You can’t abuse your seniority to make others bow down to you, right?”

“Qin Yu represents the power of the new faction! He also represents the new generation!”

Basically, the forum was divided into two factions. One supported Qin Yu, and the other supported Gu Taichu.

Gu Taichu had been famous for many years. Naturally, there were more people who supported him.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Help me respond to one. Say that I’m waiting for him in Chuzhou.”

Yao Qing’s expression changed slightly. He frowned and said, “Mr. Qin, if that’s the case, it won’t be easy to end things...”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Do you think Gu Taichu will go back on his word? A person like him will definitely care about his reputation very much.”

Yao Qing hesitated for a moment and finally agreed.

Then, Yao Qing replied online, “Gu Taichu, I’ll wait for you in Chuzhou.”

Just a few words had made this news that was about to die down start buzzing again!

In just a few short hours, this post had received over a thousand replies!

No one had expected Qin Yu would actually take the initiative to respond!

The next day, the Jiang Bei region’s Martial Arts Association even sent a reporter to watch this matter.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu got up early and stood in the courtyard to wait for Gu Taichu.

What was surprising was that Gu Taichu didn’t appear from morning till evening.

This made people’s jaws drop in shock.

Could it be that Gu Taichu was afraid? He was actually indifferent to the provocation of a junior?

Even Qin Yu felt that it was a little strange.

With Gu Taichu’s ability, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to deal with Qin Yu. Why would he go back on his words?

“Strange.” The people from the Martial Arts Association couldn’t help but frown.

“Could it be that Gu Taichu is really afraid?”

“Forget it, let’s retreat first. It’s better to send people to interview Gu Taichu,” the reporters said in a low voice.

Then, they left Chuzhou.

...

The Jiang Bei region covered five provinces.

Chuzhou was the weakest of them all.

The region with the most powerful martial artists was the Bin Province.

And Gu Taichu was from Bin Province.

At this moment, in a medium-sized chinese-style mansion in Peach Blossom City in Bin Province, an old man with white hair was drinking tea.

“Master, why did you break your promise?” His disciple looked a little angry!

However, Gu Taichu didn’t say anything and just drank tea.

The tea he drank was extraordinary and each piece was emerald green.

The most shocking thing was that this tea contained a dense spiritual energy!

The density of spiritual energy was almost comparable to that of hundreds of years old herbs!

“How many pieces of this tea are left?” At this moment, Gu Taichu suddenly looked at his disciple and asked.

His disciple said, “There are three pieces left.”

“Three pieces... in a flash, dozens of years have passed,” Gu Taichu muttered softly.

His disciple frowned and said, “Master, where did this tea come from? Why do you take it so seriously?”

Gu Taichu had always been extremely cautious with this tea. Even his disciple had no idea where it came from.

Facing his disciple’s question, Gu Taichu hesitated for a moment, then slowly said, “This tea is called Enlightenment Tea. It was once given to me by a top-notch martial artist.”

“Enlightenment Tea?” His disciple seemed a little surprised.

Gu Taichu lamented, “That was fifty years ago. Thinking back, I was just an ordinary martial artist...”

Fifty years ago, Gu Taichu’s talent was average. Not to mention an Inner Strength Grandmaster, it was even hard for him to become an Inner Strength Master Hands.

And during a training trip, Gu Taichu met an top-notch martial artist who was traveling.

It was that man who casually gave Gu Taichu more than ten pieces of Enlightenment Tea.

It was also because of this Enlightenment Tea that Gu Taichu reached where he was today.

“If I remember correctly, that top-notch martial artist’s surname was Qin,” Gu Taichu whispered.

“The same surname as Qin Yu?” His disciple was a little surprised.

Gu Taichu didn’t say anything else.

He put his hands behind his back, stood up, and looked into the distance. He murmured, “I really don’t know. My good fortune was casually given to me by that top-notch martial artist. I really wonder if Qin Yu is related to that top-notch martial artist...”

It was precisely because of this reason that Gu Taichu suddenly canceled.

“Master, won’t you know whether they’re related or not after you go and take a look?” His disciple suggested.

Gu Taichu was silent for a moment before saying, “Pick a suitable time to go to Chuzhou.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, Master.”

...

Gu Taichu didn’t come, but Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to remove his formation.

Because no one knew if Gu Taichu would suddenly visit.

At this moment, at a large bar in the provincial capital, Yang Zhao was partying on the dance floor and he looked extremely happy.

“Young Master Yang, what are you so happy about?” A woman wearing a tight-fitting skirt walked up and asked.

Yang Zhao said proudly, “Xiao Yu has agreed to compete with me. She said that as long as I win, she will do whatever I tell her to.”

“Oh really? Compete with Young Master Yang? Isn’t she being overly confident?” The woman in the tight-fitting skirt asked in surprise.

Yang Zhao sneered and said, “I originally invited Qin Yu, but for some reason, Xiao Yu volunteered to compete with me.”

“If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being impolite...” A hint of lust flashed in Yang Zhao’s eyes.

Thinking of Xiao Yu’s graceful figure and pretty face, Yang Zhao felt aroused.

He couldn’t wait for that day.
