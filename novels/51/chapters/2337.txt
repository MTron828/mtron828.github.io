2338 Pi Xiu

She then grabbed his soul and casually threw it to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not waste time and threw the soul into the Sumeru ring to suppress it.

After that, he continued to cultivate. Other than the vertebra, some glazed holy bones had begun to grow some rib bones now.

However, at the rate it went, it would take a long time before the complete glazed body would form.

Qin Yu immersed himself in the bone cultivation water at the eighth level of purgatory. The demonic qi in the bone cultivation water here was much denser than that of the seventh level.

As there were also many tremendously powerful people here, Qin Yu had chosen to cultivate on the seventh level in the beginning.

An enormous spiritual energy entered Qin Yu’s body again, and the domineering aspect of the Traceless Immortal Scripture was displayed to the fullest.

This terrifying speed of absorbing spiritual energy was something that even the nine aristocratic families’ immortal scriptures could not compare to.

This was the first time Qin Yu had circulated the Traceless Immortal Scripture to the utmost for so long. He was completely immersed in the pleasure of absorbing spiritual energy.

In the end, he actually affected almost everyone cultivating on the level.

Some cultivators and demon races came over to watch, but they were frightened away by Jue Wu’s fierce appearance.

Within the boundless demonic qi, countless invisible divine senses gathered together and formed a massive throne in Qin Yu’s divine sense. A person was sitting on it.

He gazed at Qin Yu with an indifferent expression, and the might of his presence had already caused the soul power nearby Qin Yu to collapse.

“You’re truly courting death. We only dare to absorb the demonic qi from the bone cultivation water after partial refining and complete refining of the power of divine sense.”

A nearby cultivator sneered, ready to snatch the treasure after Qin Yu was in trouble.

“Hmph! The will in the bone cultivation water contains a trace of emperor might. Even if it’s invisible, it’s not something a True Saint can resist when it accumulates.”

“Wait for this guy to turn into an idiot before we attack. He has quite many treasures on him.”

Many people had prepared themselves. Previously, it was not that they were afraid when they saw Jue Wu’s incomparable strength, but because they did not see the need.

But now, with the temptation of supreme treasures like Suo Lin, they had to give it a try, even if it was dangerous. Many people present had the same thought.

Jue Wu also sensed something wrong at this moment. She returned to Qin Yu’s side and took Qin Yu back.

Elder Guai’s strength now had recovered to its peak and had even improved. He could now be of great help in battle.

He did not expect these faint wills to cause such a change when they gathered together.

The figure stared at Qin Yu with a disdainful look as if he was the king here.

“D*mn it! Even if you’re a Demon Emperor, it’s my sea of consciousness here!”

In Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, countless golden sharp swords slowly formed.

The Soul Shattering Golden Radiance.

Countless golden lights were like a sword formation piercing toward the throne.

However, before the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance could get close to the throne, it turned into countless golden powders.

Qin Yu’s divine sense golden figurine clapped his hands.

Countless powers of the soul instantly surged, and tens of thousands of golden swords fused into one instantly. The giant sword instantly stabbed toward the throne.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The giant sword shattered piece by piece. At this moment, Qin Yu also began to fight with all his might.

In his sea of consciousness, the spirit bead was glowing.

Qin Yu activated the divine sense spirit bead, and the utmost soul power was channeled into the giant golden sword.

The giant sword emitted a dazzling golden light, and the collapsed sword body took shape again.

The giant golden sword finally pierced into the throne. At this moment, even Jue Wu and the others could sense the terrifying fluctuations emitted from his sea of consciousness.

The giant golden sword collapsed and formed again repeatedly. Behind the throne, Black Qin Yu suddenly appeared.

With a twist of his hand, a Soul Vortex formed under the activation of the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

In the black vortex, the ghostly qi was like a giant millstone crushing the power of the soul that was sucked in and then turned into a tonic that fused into his soul.

Black Qin Yu was another personality born from the Soul Torment Mind Technique, but this personality was now completely suppressed by Qin Yu.

Using the Black Qin Yu to activate the Soul Torment Mind Technique was tremendously powerful.

The Soul Vortex almost turned the throne into a phantom. Traces of Soul Power entered the vortex and slowly weakened the power of the throne.

The power of Soul Vortex was already almost half of the power of the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance.

Qin Yu’s giant sword shook violently, crushing the throne into countless pieces directly.

The fragments slowly integrated into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. Instantly, Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness shone with golden light.

Qin Yu had just integrated a fragment when he felt his sea of consciousness had been almost filled.

The divine sense spirit bead slowly rotated, and the power of the soul fused into it, and then slowly integrated into the sea of consciousness.

When the power of the soul in the spirit bead reached its limit, a trace of utmost soul power spread into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

This divine power was equivalent to the divine power compressed and refined by the spirit bead. Qin Yu was overjoyed.

This spirit bead that made him suffer intense pain did not disappoint him.

In this situation, it was equivalent to his spirit bead akin to a perpetual motion machine slowly producing this kind of ultimate divine power as long as he had enough soul power. Eventually, it would replace his current Sea of Soul.

Thinking of this situation, Qin Yu could not help but tremble with excitement. When the time comes, with this terrifying soul power, who could stop him?

After settling these matters, Qin Yu slowly floated out of the bone cultivation water.

After staying here for three to four days, he could feel that the energy contained in this place had become much diluted.

However, to his surprise, a complete rib bone had grown out of the glazed holy bone.

“Qin Yu, are you done?”

Jue Wu was overjoyed.

“What do you mean by ‘I’m done’? This description is strange…”

Qin Yu was speechless.

“Thump! Thump! Thump!”

Behind them, a person with a gloomy expression slowly walked over.

Although his figure was tremendously small and skinny, every step he took seemed to carry the strength of a thousand pounds. Even Qin Yu, in the river of bones, could feel the tremors.

Qin Yu was shocked and could not imagine what kind of energy this skinny body contained.

The skinny man stood in front of the bone cultivation water and stared coldly at Qin Yu. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“It seems to be a demon race. This demon is called Pi Xiu, the ninth son of the dragon.”

Jue Wu seemed to have seen this kind of demonic beast before.

The bone cultivation water suddenly rippled. Then, under Qin Yu’s shocked gaze, the bone cultivation water soared into the sky.

In a short while, nearly half of the bone cultivation water entered Pi Xiu’s mouth.
