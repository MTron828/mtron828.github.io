Chapter 2696: The Mine Cave

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“You’re courting death! Take this Mountain-splitting Whip of mine.”

The middle-aged man’s Saint Power surged. The whip in his hand suddenly flew out.

Sonic booms sounded around the whip. Suddenly, terrifying Saint Power gathered on his arm.

His arm visibly grew thicker as he leaped high into the air.

The entire whip instantly became straight. The whip in his hand was like a large knife and aimed at Qin Yu’s head. It made an exaggerated sound.

Then, he directly slapped Qin Yu’s head. Qin Yu tilted his head slightly.

This whip landed directly on Qin Yu’s shoulder and a crisp sound came from under his feet.

The huge force shattered countless hard ore on the ground. The huge smoke and dust immediately surrounded Qin Yue

The huge force pressed the ground under his feet deep into the ground. One could imagine how terrifying the power of this attack was.

Tie Nan stared at the smoke and dust.

Although the whip did not reach Qin Yu’s head, it landed on his shoulder. This power was enough to tear a Dao Realm level 3 person apart.

“How… How is this possible?”

When Tie Nan saw Qin Yu appear in front of him unscathed, he revealed a look of disbelief.

A terrifying sonic boom suddenly swept through the air.

Tie Nan only saw a burst of intense silver light in front of him. In the next moment, a huge force had already grabbed his neck and lifted his entire body into the air.

“Little brother, please show mercy. Tie Nan was just testing you.”

Zui Rao frowned and stopped him.

“I gave him a chance.”

Qin Yu said indifferently as he exerted a little force in his palm.

Kacha!

Qin Yu instantly crushed Tie Nan’s neck. Then, a force swept out from his palm.

The Saint Power that exploded instantly entered his hands and his sea of consciousness. When the corpse landed on the ground, it was already withered and old, just like an ordinary old man.

“What a vicious act!”

Zui Rao’s face changed. She stared at Qin Yu.

That half of her rotten face looked especially terrifying at the moment.

“Vicious? You were the one who instructed him to attack just now, weren’t you?

If you have the guts, try it yourself.”

Qin Yu sneered, not showing her any respect at all.

He only felt that it was laughable. Who knew how many outsiders had fallen into her hands and been tortured?

At this moment, how dare she say that Qin Yu was ruthless?

When he said that, the surrounding people could not help but burst into an uproar.

Stationing herself on this staircase to the heavens represented a force recognized by others.

Moreover, she was also a ruthless lord. She did not even lose here.

Seeing that Qin Yu was more vicious than her, she could not help but reveal her killing intent.

It was just that Qin Yu’s strange soaring into the sky previously really made her a little uncertain. She did not make a move instantly. The two of them were in a deadlock.

“Sister Zui Rao, you said the most ruthless words. He even killed your bed warmer, Tie Nan. Don’t tell me you don’t dare to attack anymore?”

Xiao Qing said with a smile on her face.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and his body moved slightly.

Ling Bo.

Everyone only saw silver holy energy explode, and Qin Yu had already appeared in front of Xiao Green.

His speed was ridiculously fast after he attained the Milky Way Holy Body.

His speed was at least ten times faster than before. When Zui Rao saw that terrifying speed, her pupils couldn’t help but shrink. Her eyes actually couldn’t capture Qin Yu’s figure.

“What a fast speed!”

Xiao Qing’s expression changed drastically as Qin Yu’s fist landed on her abdomen.

Her human-shaped skin swelled up like a balloon, and then countless cracks slowly appeared on the surface of her skin.

As the mark expanded, her body exploded.

Hundreds of snake shadows suddenly shot out towards the surrounding holes.

“Soaring Wind Slash!”

Qin Yu directly locked onto a snake shadow. His divine sense power suddenly grasped the internal qi of the snake’s shadow.

Then, he appeared in front of it, and green blood splattered in all directions.

Slash!

Xiao Qing’s figure appeared again. Qin Yu’s palm blade had cut her lower body off. She revealed a terrified expression.

Qin Yu grabbed a bag in his hand. It was a small Qiankun Bag.

He could sense a powerful Saint Power fluctuation from it, so he took it from Xiao Qing’s body. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He opened it and saw a pile of crystals.

Qin Yu sensed that each crystal contained dense holy energy.

Moreover, these crystals were divided into two different colors. The copper-colored crystal had some impurities.

However, only five crystal ores contained an enormous amount of energy. “I feel that there’s something to eat again.”

Before Qin Yu could take a closer look, the Qiankun Bag in his hand directly dried up.

The ore that contained Saint Power turned into a pile of useless slag in the blink of an eye.

“Sleep. Sleep. It’s not even enough to fill the gaps between my teeth.”

Qin Yu only felt like crying. The ores disappeared in less than three seconds after he got them.

This should be the holy energy ore produced by the Endless Mine. However, he didn’t have the time. Otherwise, he wouldn’t mind to get more of this crystal ore.

Qin Yu thought to himself. Meanwhile, Xiao Qing, who was at the side, had already fled with a panicked expression. She had never encountered such a terrifying outsider.

Just by relying on the strength of his physical body, he had severed her body.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and ignored her.

After a short pause, he sensed the internal qi here and rushed to a place with strong holy energy.

The surrounding forces were all looking at each other with wide eyes. Qin Yu’s attack just now had intimidated them.

For a moment, no one paid attention to Qin Yu. “Boss, are we just going to let this kid leave like this?” Two of Zui Rao’s subordinates asked softly.

“He won’t be playing rampant around for long. Keep an eye on him.”

Zui Rao coldly stared in the direction Qin Yu had left. Right now, her cold expression made her rotten face look even more terrifying.

The two people around them couldn’t help but shiver. It had been a long time since they saw their boss’s expression. It seemed that she was furious.

About five kilometers away from here, a huge cave appeared.

Except for the hole, there was nothing on the ground. The hole seemed to be dug deep underground. Thick holy energy was coming out of the hole.

“What a dense holy energy!”

Qin Yu was a little surprised. It seemed that there must be a lot of holy energy ore underground. Otherwise, it would be hard to emit such a powerful holy energy.

All of a sudden, a shocking aura flashed by.

Qin Yu’s back instantly broke out in cold sweat. When he used the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze to examine carefully, he did not find anything else
