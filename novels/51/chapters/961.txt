Chapter 962: Chapter 962, different paths 

Jiang he’s strength had completely exceeded Zhai Xing’s expectations.

At this moment, even Zhai Xing regretted not getting rid of Jiang he earlier.

“Hehe.”Finally, Gu Xinghe spoke.

He glanced at Jiang he in front of him and said indifferently, “The famous Jiang he really lives up to his reputation.”

Jiang he looked at Gu Xinghe and said, “Let’s go. Don’t set foot here in the future.”

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes. A moment later, he sneered and said, “Alright, I’ll give you face today.”

This sentence immediately shocked everyone.

Gu Xinghe actually agreed to Jiang He’s request?

This did not suit his personality.

“Let’s go.”Gu Xinghe turned around and planned to leave.

Zhai Xing furrowed his brows tightly. He took a deep look at Jiang he and followed behind Gu Xinghe down the mountain.

It was not until they descended the mountain that Zhai Xing could not help but ask, “Why don’t you let me take action?”

Gu Xinghe glanced at Zhai Xing and said, “Is there any use for you to take action now?”

Zhai Xing knew that this matter was caused by him, so he said with some guilt, “I will handle this matter.”

“There’s no need.”Gu Xinghe waved his hand and then sneered, “There’s no need for you to act.”

“What do you mean?”Zhai Xing asked in confusion.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Someone will do it.”

Zhai Xing frowned. He suddenly raised his head and said in a low voice, “You mean... The Sky Blood Rainbow?”

“That’s right.”Gu Xinghe took a deep breath.

“I want to divert the trouble and let the Sky Blood Rainbow interfere in this matter.”

Speaking up to this point, Gu Xinghe did not forget to win over the hearts of the people.

He glanced at Zhai Xing and said, “Even if you can beat Jiang He, I’m afraid it will be very difficult. I don’t want to see anything happen to you.”

Zhai Xing, who had a pure nature, did not know what Gu Xinghe was thinking.

His eyes were a little touched, touched, and also a little guilty.

“Young Master Gu, I’m sorry...”Zhai Xing bowed and said.

Gu Xinghe could not help but sneer in his heart. He patted Zhai Xing’s shoulder and said, “Uncle Zhai Xing, you’re being too polite. Get in the car.”

Everyone left nine Pinnacles Mountain.

The mountain was already in a mess.

Qin Yu and the others ran out of the house. He rushed to Xu Huaigu and asked in a low voice, “Senior, how do you feel?”

Xu Huaigu waved his hand. He opened his mouth but couldn’t say anything.

“I’ll leave Xu Huaigu to you,”Jiang he said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Senior Jiang he, don’t worry.”

With that, Qin Yu carried Xu Huaigu on his back and walked into the room.

Xu Huaigu’s internal and external injuries had impacted his internal organs.

Qin Yu first sealed his mingmen and then prepared to refine pills.

He wrote a prescription and handed it to Zhuang Teng.

“Buy the medicine according to this prescription,”Qin Yu said.

Zhuang Teng quickly nodded. After he took the prescription, he planned to go down the mountain.

“I’ll go with you,”Chang Mang said in a deep voice.

Zhuang Teng agreed and the two of them rushed down the mountain.

“Don’t Tell Me Gu Xinghe and the others are lying in ambush at the foot of the mountain?”Yao Meng asked with a frown.

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but feel a little worried.

If they met Gu Xinghe, they were afraid that they would be doomed.

Everyone waited on the mountain. Fortunately, this trip was not dangerous. In the evening, the two of them rushed back.

“How is it? Nothing happened on the way, right?”Qin Yu asked. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Zhuang Teng shook his head and said, “No.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He didn’t say anything more. After taking the herbs, he began to refine pills.

He took out the pill cauldron, and a wisp of spiritual fire lit up in his palm.

The moment the flame fell, the herbs shrank in the pill cauldron.

Everyone surrounded the pill cauldron, seemingly quite interested.

Qin Yu spent most of the night refining three kinds of pills. They were the meridian-protecting pill, the nine Yang Pill, and the Jade Dew Pill.

These three kinds of pills were used to protect the vital meridians, and to treat internal and external injuries.

After feeding these three kinds of pills to Xu Huaigu, his breathing immediately became much more stable.

“Is that enough?”Yao Meng asked softly.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I’m afraid that senior will need to rest for a period of time.”

Xu Huaigu nodded slightly and said, “Thank you.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I should be thanking you. Senior, tell me, if senior Jiang he doesn’t come, are you planning to self-destruct?”

Xu Huaigu didn’t answer, but his silence had already indicated his answer.

“Senior, your selflessness is admirable.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but cupped his hands to Xu Huaigu.

The others also bowed to Xu Huaigu.

Xu Huaigu waved his hand and said, “Maybe the path I’m taking is wrong.”

Everyone was speechless, as if they didn’t understand what Xu Huaigu meant.

However, Qin Yu understood what Xu Huaigu was thinking.

After this battle, Xu Huaigu probably regretted the path he had chosen.

If he was like Jiang he, and every move was decisive and decisive, why would he have to walk the path of self-destruction?

“Senior, rest well.”Qin Yu bowed to Xu Huaigu.

“I’ll stay and take care of senior Xu,”Yao Meng said.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Thank you for your hard work.”

After walking out of the room, Qin Yu glanced at everyone and said, “Everyone, rest early.”

“Okay.”They all nodded.

After everyone left, Qin Yu was silent for a moment. Then, he followed Jiang he’s internal Qi and walked into a certain room.

Jiang he seemed to have expected Qin Yu to come. When Qin Yu opened the door, he was sitting quietly in front of the table and making a pot of tea.

“Senior Jiang He.”Qin Yu walked forward and leaned forward slightly.

Jiang he nodded and poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu.

“Senior, when did you enter the Martial Saint Stage?”Qin Yu asked with some doubt.

Jiang he said, “Three days ago.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he said, “Senior, you also comprehended your own dao techniques before you entered the Martial Saint Stage, right?”

This surprised Jiang he.

“You actually know how to comprehend dao techniques. I spent more than a month to understand this principle.”Jiang he shook his head slowly.

“No wonder ji Yuhong thinks so highly of you.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I only understood this principle when I was discussing dao with senior Xu Huaigu. It’s just that... I haven’t been able to find my own dao. I wonder if senior can give me some pointers.”
