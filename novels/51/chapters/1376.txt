Chapter 1377: Chapter 1,377, Sister Lin’s help 

Sister Lin agreed, “Okay, see you in three days’time.”

Qin Yu nodded. He cupped his hands to sister Lin again as a form of thanks.

“Be careful,”sister Lin warned.

After saying this, sister Lin didn’t stay any longer and quickly left.

After she had gone far away, iron egg couldn’t help but ask, “Do you really believe her? What if she brings people from the heavenly cloud sect to see you in three days’time?”

Qin Yu said, “I’ve already seen it before I came here. In the three stars to the east of the East Gate is a mountain forest. Although it’s not big, it’s very convenient to hide.”

In such a world, one must be wary of others.

Then, Qin Yu left Gu city directly.

In the next few days, he wandered around the vicinity of Gu City, hiding his face with his hat.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, feeling a little uneasy.

He was worried that the heavenly cloud sect would attack the people around him.

Perhaps the heavenly cloud sect would not touch di zun because they lacked talent.

However, it was hard to say for Zhen Yue and Fang Yue.

Especially for Zhen Yue. She was not talented to begin with and was brought here by Qin Yu. It was very likely that the heavenly cloud sect would attack her first.

These three days were extremely difficult to endure. It could be said that the days were like years.

Finally, the third day’s time arrived.

Early in the morning of this day, Qin Yu arrived at the agreed location.

He hid on a tree, using leaves to cover his body. He covered himself tightly, and only two eyes were exposed.

In addition, there were no fluctuations of nature essence in Qin Yu’s body, so even if someone passed by, they wouldn’t be able to find Qin Yu.

In other words, there was only one way to find Qin Yu Now, and that was to use the naked eye.

As time passed, Qin Yu’s cold gaze swept past the crowd.

As long as there were any abnormalities, Qin Yu was prepared to escape.

Fortunately, there were no suspicious people throughout the entire day.

The sky gradually darkened, and the moon hung on the treetops.

The ground was illuminated by specks of light, turning the originally quiet forest into a rather artistic scene.

Qin Yu activated the desolate God’s eye and looked at the entrance of Gu City from afar.

A few minutes later.

A beautiful figure appeared at the eastern entrance.

She walked hurriedly towards Qin Yu’s direction.

Every two steps, she would turn around to take a look, as if she was afraid that someone would follow her.

Sister Lin’s strength was not weak, she was much stronger than Wen Da and Wen Er.

With her spiritual sense, she was able to discover the people in the dark.

After nearly half an hour, sister Lin finally arrived in the vicinity.

She looked around, obviously looking for Qin Yu’s figure.

But Qin Yu was not in a hurry to go down, instead, he planned to wait.

Sister Lin simply found a place to sit down. From time to time, she looked into the distance, looking up at Qin Yu’s figure.

It was not until sister Lin stood up and was about to leave that Qin Yu jumped down from the forest and landed in front of sister Lin.

“Sister Lin, I’m sorry. I’m late,”Qin Yu said with an embarrassed smile.

Sister Lin rolled her eyes at Qin Yu and said, “Are you late, or do you not believe me?”

Qin Yu was stunned, then smiled bitterly and said, “I really can’t hide anything from sister Lin... I’m in a special situation now, so I have to be careful. Please forgive me, Sister Lin.”

“Well, if I blamed you, I would have ignored you long ago,”sister Lin scolded with a smile.

She took out a bottle of medicine from the space divine tool and handed it to Qin Yu, saying, “Put this medicine on your face. After about two hours, you will change into a different appearance.”

Qin Yu took the medicine and said gratefully, “Thank you, sister Lin.”

Sister Lin nodded and continued, “But I have to tell you that this medicine can only last for a month. It will lose its effect after a month. Be careful.”

“A month is enough.”Qin Yu held the bottle tightly.

Then, Qin Yu bowed to sister Lin again and said, “Sister Lin, I can’t stay here for long. I’ll leave first.”

“Wait.”At this moment, sister Lin called out to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was startled and said, “Sister Lin, is there anything else?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Sister Lin muttered, “Can you tell me your plan?”

Qin Yu obviously didn’t expect sister Lin’s words. He was silent for a moment and said, “My friends are still in the Heavenly Cloud sect. I’m afraid that something will happen to them, so I plan to stay near the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“If the Tianyun sect really wants to touch them, then I can only appear.”

Sister Lin seemed to have already guessed Qin Yu’s thoughts. She pulled Qin Yu aside and said, “If that’s the case, I can introduce you to a place.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Can you be trusted?”

Sister Lin smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I Won’t tell them your true identity. By introducing you to a place, not only can I guarantee your safety, but I can also let you enter and exit the Tianyun sect.”

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up and he hurriedly said, “Are you serious?”

“Of course. When have I ever lied to You?”Sister Lin said with a smile.

“But... is there really such a place? I Can’t join the Heavenly Cloud sect. It’s too risky,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Sister Lin shook her head and said, “Don’t worry. Since I said that I can guarantee your safety, I Won’t lie to you.”

“Wait for me here tomorrow morning. I will write you a letter of introduction and a map,”said sister Lin.
