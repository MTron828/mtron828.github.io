Chapter 2704: The Terrifying Battle

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The huge sandworm was sent flying by the punch and collapsed.

A huge area collapsed in front of Qin Yu. The mine in front of him became a huge space due to the attack.

A sandworm that was thousands of meters long fell to the ground. It was only then that Qin Yu saw its appearance.

What shocked Qin Yu was that the surface of the sandworm was covered with a

thick level of crystal ore.

He had not found this crystal ore until just now despite he explored until such a deep location.

One could imagine how rare this kind of ore was. At this moment, the sandworm’s body was covered in this kind of holy energy crystal. How many crystal ores had it devoured?

What was strange was that its face was the face of a Buddha statue.

This Buddha statue was the marks he had seen previously on the foreheads of those people at the contact points!

Before Qin Yu could think further, the Buddha statue revealed a strange smile.

Then, it suddenly opened its mouth, revealing its fine teeth.

Qin Yu only felt a tremble at his side. The sandworm’s tail lashed out horizontally.

The wall of the mine was directly swept away by the tail, leaving a large space. The hard ore was turned into powder and a terrifying explosion occurred.

Qin Yu used both his arms to block the explosion shockwave and shielded the little boy behind him.

Looking at the dusty mine cave, Qin Yu felt as if his soul had left her body.

Even Dao Realm level 10 may not be able to cause such damage.

The woman stretched out her hand again, but her thin palm emitted unimaginable power.

This tail landed in front of her palm, but it could no longer proceed.

Her body was suddenly covered in a level of pure white light. She looked very ethereal, like a fairy.

Then, the internal qi spread out with her as the center.

The moment this level of light covered Qin Yu, he felt something had been injected into the space he was in.

It was an indescribable feeling. He wanted to open his mouth to speak, but he could not hear his voice.

He took a few steps forward and realized that time seemed to have slowed down by dozens of times.

The action that could be completed in one breath took more than ten seconds.

When he turned around, he saw an afterimage behind him, which almost scared him.

At this moment, there were hundreds of afterimages behind Qin Yu. What was even more surprising was that when he raised his hand to touch the afterimage, he felt could touch that physical body.

This meant that these hundreds of afterimages were all real him.

“What a strange technique!”

Qin Yu had never seen such a technique before. This should be the woman’s second time using it.

Moreover, the technique used this time was even more powerful. It even affected him.

And now, the sandworm and the woman were already fighting.

The space was chaotic and afterimages flew like just now.

All Qin Yu could see were the afterimages of the woman and the sandworm.

The huge sandworm could not gain any advantage in front of the woman.

Countless crystals on its body exploded. A spell blew away a large part of its tail.

In just ten seconds, countless huge holes had appeared on its body. These were all blown up by this woman.

“Could this woman have already reached the Holy Consciousness Realm?” Qin Yu was extremely shocked.

Qin Yu had experienced the hardness of the crystal ore before. He could not break it even with his full strength.

However, the sandworm’s body was like a sandbag in front of the woman. It was not worth mentioning at all. Moreover, its terrifying strength was completely suppressed by the woman.

The woman suddenly struck out with her palm. Countless palm shadows instantly appeared in space.

Countless palm shadows hit the sandworm. A level of crystal powder exploded on its body.

“What a terrifying defensive power! It seems like this body isn’t its fatal weakness.”

Qin Yu used the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze to observe this battle. This kind of battle observation that crossed realms would be of great help to his future.

He had a vague idea that the weakness of the sandworm should be on that

head.

The woman seemed to know that, but the sandworm would focus on protecting its head when she attacked.

Therefore, she had no choice but to start destroying its body.

Her body suddenly retreated and her chest heaved slightly.

It seemed that creating this space had consumed a lot of her energy. She stretched out a finger that was like a green onion.

Weng!

A copper coin was spinning on her fair slender fingertips.

With a wave of her finger, the copper coin flew out like a sword light.

In an instant, the entire space was filled with the shadow of the copper coin.

For a moment, the sound of the copper coin hitting the sandworm resounded throughout the entire mine.

Ding!

A copper coin seemed to have been sent flying by the sandworm’s body, directly entering the mine through his head.

In the next moment, it attacked again.

Countless laser-like lights enveloped the entire space. This attack seemed to have severely injured the sandworm.

Its body was covered in countless copper wounds. Even his head was covered in these wounds.

If it was an ordinary demonic beast, it would have died countless times.

However, Qin Yu did not expect it to let out a furious roar and burrowed into the mine just like that.

Even Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze saw that the sandworm left at a terrifying speed.

“It’s still alive!”

Qin Yu was dumbfounded.

The woman landed on the ground and the light she emitted slowly retracted into her body.

Qin Yu’s strange feeling only gradually disappeared when the power was completely withdrawn.

She stood on the spot and pondered. At this moment, she seemed to have come from another world, making people feel a kind of transcendental beauty. To be honest, this woman was the most special one Qin Yu had ever seen.

Suddenly, her gaze fell on Qin Yu.

Even if she didn’t make a move, she gave Qin Yu extremely terrifying pressure.

With this woman’s strength, he probably wouldn’t even be able to withstand a single exchange.

“Why didn’t you enter the Nineteenth Prison?”

The woman frowned slightly and her gaze fell on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu felt that her crystal-like eyes could see through his divine soul and all his secrets.

After a long time, she shifted her gaze and looked at the little boy again. “A lone star in the sky, so that’s how it is…”

“Miss, can I ask you something? What happened here? What was that sandworm just now?”

Qin Yu was a little scared by her recitation, so he could not help but ask. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“How about I make a deal with you?”

The woman frowned slightly and suddenly said to Qin Yu.

“What deal?”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to reject her directly because he was afraid that he would anger her.

“You help me enter the Nineteenth Prison and I owe you a favor.”

The woman said seriously..
