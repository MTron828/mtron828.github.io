Hearing this, Qu Xie sneered, “Xia Hang, do you think I’m an idiot? Will he, Qin Yu, dare to come to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

In the first place, Xia Hang did not want to let Qin Yu in. So after hearing Qu Xie’s words, he immediately stood up and said, “Then just pretend that I didn’t say anything.”

After saying this, Xia Hang turned his head and walked out.

Qu Xie frowned. He looked at his assistant and said, “Go to the door and see if what Xia Hang said is true.”

The assistant agreed and then walked out.

A few minutes later, the assistant ran back while panting. There was a clear palm print on his face.

“President Qu, that Qin Yu... is really at the door! He said he wants to talk to you! I... I have already sent him to the conference room.” The assistant panted heavily.

Hearing this, Qu Xie suddenly stood up, and a trace of shock flashed across his face.

“This Qin Yu... is really unpredictable,” Qu Xie said with narrowed eyes.

Then, Qu Xie looked at the people around him and said coldly, “This time, we must kill Qin Yu no matter what!”

...

In the conference room.

Qin Yu made himself comfortable with a pot of tea while the two Guardians beside him poured tea for him.

“No one in the world has enjoyed the privilege of having two mighty figures serve them.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel proud.

At this moment, the door of the conference room opened.

Then, Qu Xie strode in with more than ten people behind him.

Eight of them were in black and gold robes, and three of them were in purple robes.

Qu Xie held the Prajna ruler in one hand. As he walked, he hit it against his other hand.

“Qin Yu, you still dare to come to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? You sure have guts,” Said Qu Xie with a cold smile.

Qin Yu sat up from the sofa and said with a faint smile, “Qu Xie, I’m here to negotiate with you.”

“Negotiate with me?” Qu Xie almost laughed out loud when he heard that.

The purple-robed people behind him couldn’t help but laugh as well.

“Tell me, what do you want to talk to me about?” Qu Xie said with some amusement.

Qin Yu’s expression gradually became serious.

He looked at Qu Xie coldly and said word by word, “If you are willing to let me take Yan Ruoxue away, I can spare your life.”

As soon as he said this, Qu Xie couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He laughed and said, “Qin Yu, do you know what you are talking about? Spare my life? Just you?”

“Why don’t you take a look at yourself? Do you really think you are invincible?”

“Kid, do you know what a negotiation is? A negotiation is only qualified when both parties, who sit at the same table, are equally powerful! As for you, you are not even worth mentioning in front of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Everyone sneered and kept mocking.

Qu Xie waved his hand and sized up Qin Yu. “Qin Yu, I admit that you have some ability. If you continue to grow, you might really be able to threaten the Jingdu Martial Arts Association one day.”

“But now... you are not qualified!”

As he spoke, a strong killing intent burst out from Qu Xie’s body.

The people behind him took a step forward in unison.

Qu Xie didn’t seem to want to waste any more time. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Kill him.”

“Yes.”

Three purple-robed men walked over at the same time. Their terrifying internal qi shook the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Qin Yu’s face turned cold and he ordered, “Kill them all. Leave no one alive.”

Upon receiving the order, the two Guardians slowly walked forward.

At a glance, these two Guardians seemed ordinary. They did not even have the slightest fluctuation of internal Qi.

Therefore, they did not take these two Guardians seriously at all.

The pressure from the three of them was rapidly spreading, and their bodies were emitting waves of flames.

“Go to hell!”

One of the purple-robed men shouted angrily. Then, he raised his hand and grabbed at Guardian Burly!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He immediately used his divine sense to control Burly.

Burly clenched his hand and threw a punch.

“Boom!”

The seemingly ordinary punch instantly arrived in front of the purple-robed man.

After sensing the terrifying internal Qi on his fist, the purple-robed man’s expression changed drastically.

“This is bad!”

The purple-robed man cursed inwardly. He wanted to turn around and escape but he was too late.

Burly punched his head and smashed it into pieces.

Blood splashed on Qu Xie’s face.

The bloody smell filled the entire conference room.

“How... How could this be?!” Qu Xie’s expression changed drastically.

He killed a purple robe with one punch. What kind of strength was this? This was too ridiculous!

The remaining two purple robes’ expressions were extremely unsightly. They subconsciously looked at Qu Xie.

Qu Xie gritted his teeth. Just as he was about to speak, Burly walked over again.

He stretched out his two palms and grabbed the remaining two purple robes.

Then, Burly moved his palms slightly, and a crisp cracking sound came from the necks of the two purple robes.

The necks of the two men were crushed by Burly.

The bodies of the two purple-robed men immediately went limp and still in Burly’s hands.

When Qu Xie saw this, his facial expression became even more shocked.

One had to know that the purple-robed men were the foundation of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s combat strength. In the world, they were also considered top-notch existences.

But now, facing Burly, they actually did not have the power to retaliate. How could anyone accept this!

Burly threw the three bodies on the ground, then reached out his hand and directly took out the golden cores of the three of them. Afterward, he turned around and handed them to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu played with the three golden cores and sneered, “Qu Xie, do I have the right to talk to you now?”

Qu Xie’s face was extremely cold. Although he was shocked, he was not afraid.

The reason was that Qu Xie had a Martial Saint Weapon in his hand. This was his confidence.

Qu Xie narrowed his eyes and looked at Burly. He said coldly, “Your skills are not bad. Why don’t you come and work for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

Qin Yu sneered when he saw this.

“Qu Xie, they only listen to my orders. Don’t waste your energy,” Qin Yu sneered.

When Qu Xie heard this, he immediately stood up and said, “Oh? Is that so? It’s such a pity. I can only bear the pain and kill them...”

As he spoke, the Prajna ruler in Qu Xie’s hand began to flash with light. Streams of terrifying Martial Saint’s internal Qi gathered on the Prajna ruler.

The Martial Saint’s internal Qi was extremely terrifying. Just a wisp of it was enough to make people tremble in fear.

Even Qin Yu could feel the pressure of the Martial Saint Weapon in his chest. It was as if his blood was about to gush out. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“In front of the Martial Saint Weapon, everyone must die!”

Qu Xie roared furiously and the Prajna ruler in his hand immediately pressed forward.

In an instant, an intense light burst out from the Prajna ruler.

This light carried an extremely pure Martial Saint’s internal Qi as it crushed towards Burly.
