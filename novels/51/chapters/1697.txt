Chapter 1698: Chapter 1698, Eternal Void Return! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

However, Qin Yu soon felt that it was impossible. Even if the ancient heavenly court really existed, it was definitely not the same as the legendary scene.

Qin Yu finally put the token away. He put the token back into the spatial magic artifact and kept thinking about his guess.

After thinking about it, this seemed to be the only possibility.

“If I bring this divine tea token into the dragon burial cave, I wonder what effect it will have,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

In any case, he had already been planted with the east barren’s mark. In the future, he wouldn’t feel any psychological pressure when he entered the east barren.

“I shouldn’t enter the east barren for the time being. I’m afraid it’s already too late,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The northern lands could make a comeback at any time. As for the young man he met recently, he didn’t know when he would attack. Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t have that much time.

He sat cross-legged by the wall as countless thoughts flashed through his mind.

Before this, Qin Yu had never thought that he had the qualifications to fight against an elementalist who was in an all-out state. This was because it was absolutely impossible for Qin Yu to step into the reversion void stage so quickly.

However, ever since he saw Saint Xiao make his move, Qin Yu changed his mind.

Since there was a chance of defeating an elementalist who was half-step into the reversion void stage, there might still be a glimmer of hope once he stepped into the half-step into the reversion void stage.

Therefore, Qin Yu decided to rush to the location that Xiao Sheng had given him the next day for closed-door cultivation.

The next day, Qin Yu set off early and rushed to his destination.

In the next few days.

There were still people making breakthroughs in various parts of the southern region. The number of cultivators at the reversion void stage, which had always been extremely precious, had actually reached 13 in the entire Southern Region!

This was an extremely terrifying number! If 13 reversion void stage cultivators were to make a move together, even elementalists would have to think twice!

“The great world has changed. My master has been stuck at the half-step reversion void stage for many years, unable to advance even half a step. However, in just a few short days, he has stepped into the reversion void stage in one go. How terrifying.”

“Yeah, our master is the same. Sigh, the changes in this world are really fast.”

“Let’s not talk about your master. The weakest member of our clan has been stuck at the early-stage of the Almighty realm for decades. Not long ago, he broke through in one fell swoop. It’s too terrifying!”

“Speaking of which… it’s truly a pity for senior Xiao Hai. With his talent, if he could live until today, who knows how terrifying his cultivation would be?”

For a moment, the southern region began to miss Xiao Hai, and they felt a strong sense of regret for him.

The northern lands. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

They had naturally noticed the news of the great change in the world.

This could not help but make Sima bei worried.

The southern region was vast and had many cultivators. With the great change in the world, many people’s strength had improved qualitatively. With such a huge base, the northern region was instantly caught in a dilemma.

“This time, it won’t be so easy for the northern region to attack the southern region,”Sima Bei said in a deep voice.

He Teng, who was at the side, smiled faintly and said, “They are so timid, so why would they stop us?”

Sima bei shook his head and said, “That might not be the case. When their strength is weak, they are naturally unwilling to attack. However, once their strength reaches a certain level, their mentality will change.”

“Hahahaha!”In this regard, he teng could not stop laughing.

He placed his hands behind his back and said faintly, “Lord Sima Bei, you think too highly of them. I admit that what you said does indeed have the possibility of happening, but to them, we can easily disintegrate them from the inside.”

Sima bei did not say anything and waited for he teng to continue.

He Teng said indifferently, “First, the invasion of the northern lands will not cause them any harm. There is no point for them to make a move.”

“Second, even if they really make a move, the northern lands can give them a certain promise.”

“Think about it carefully. Now is the golden era. Everyone can deeply feel the changes between heaven and earth. In this era, everyone is filled with hope for the future. Other than people like Xiao Hai, who would be willing to risk their lives at this time?”

Sima bei did not say anything, but he felt that he teng’s words made some sense.

“Lord Sima Bei, you can rest assured that this will not have any effect on the northern lands.”He Teng said faintly.

Sima bei sighed slightly and said, “Let’s Hope so. If the northern lands loses this time, I’m afraid the consequences will be very miserable.”

Just as the two of them were talking, a ray of light suddenly flashed not far away!

Then, the northern sky began to be covered with dark clouds, and lightning flashed and thunder rumbled!

It was very obvious that another person was about to break through, and step into the reversion void stage!

“It’s the eternal limit,”Sima Bei said first.

He Teng said indifferently, “As expected of one of the three unique skills of the southern region, stepping into the reversion void stage in such a short period of time.”

The two of them did not say anything more, silently looking at the heavenly tribulation that condensed in the sky.

They were waiting, waiting for the breakthrough of the eternal pole.

After countless heavenly tribulation, the sky slowly regained its calmness. A powerful internal Qi immediately swept over the surroundings!

The power of this internal Qi even made Sima Bei’s heart tremble!

As both of them were at the reversion void stage, Sima bei even felt that the power of the eternal pole wasn’t weaker than him at all!

“He actually stepped into the reversion void stage as well…”Sima bei muttered in a low voice. He had a bad premonition in his heart.

He had always been worried about Yong Ji. Now that he had stepped into the reversion void stage, no one knew what he would do.

Right at this moment.

Yong Ji’s figure appeared in the sight of the two of them.

His footsteps seemed extremely slow, but in a few breaths’time, he had already arrived in front of the two of them!

This speed, even Sima bei couldn’t help but be shocked!

Who Wasn’t a genius! ! Yong Ji was known as one of the three unique, so he was naturally one of the most talented people in the southern region!

“Congratulations, Congratulations.”He Teng was the first to break the silence, saying with a smile that wasn’t a smile.

Sima bei also returned to his senses. He said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner, “I’ve finally stepped into the return to void realm. It can also be considered as adding a portion of strength to my northern lands.”

Yong Ji did not say anything. He stared coldly at the two people in front of him. The Aura on his body was extremely strange and strange. Internal Qi was extremely powerful.

Sima bei frowned slightly. He adjusted his aura and was ready to make a move at any time.

After an unknown amount of time, Yong Ji finally spoke.

He clenched his fists and looked coldly at the opposite bank.

“This time, I want to make the southern region tremble. I want to let them know the consequences of offending me. I want to let them know just how strong I, Yong Ji, am!”

Yong Ji’s voice was bone-chilling, causing the entire dead river to tremble!

Hearing these words, Sima bei KE finally heaved a sigh of relief.

His worries vanished into thin air, and a trace of a smile appeared on his face.

“Yong Ji, prove it to them.”Sima bei struck while the iron was hot.

“Now that you have already stepped into the reversion void stage, you can go and fulfill your dream!”

“That Xiao Sheng is merely a half-step into the reversion void stage. You can chop him up like cutting melons and cutting vegetables! In this way, your reputation will definitely be greatly boosted!”
