Chapter 158: The Despicable Zhou Tong! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

With Qin Yu’s assurance, Mr. Yang was relieved.

But in reality, Qin Yu wasn’t 100% confident.

From last night until now, Qin Yu’s strength had recovered by 30% at most.

Without the support of spiritual energy, Qin Yu’s alchemy skills would drop dramatically.

“There should be no problem.” Qin Yu looked at the crowd on the stage and muttered softly.

Time flew by, and the selection went through round after round.

Zhou Tong’s disciple survived every round by a landslide.

After nearly an entire morning, the selection finally came to an end.

Besides Zhou Tong’s disciple, three other contestants were selected.

Including Qin Yu, there were a total of five people.

During the lunch break, Qin Yu and Mr. Yang casually found a place to have lunch.

At this time, Zhou Tong was sitting in the restaurant with the other judges and his disciple.

“Luo Jian, come in and take a seat.” Zhou Tong waved to his disciple.

The young man called Luo Jian quickly walked into the private room and greeted everyone politely, “Greetings, judges.”

Updates by

“Hehe, Luo Jian, you don’t have to be so polite.”

“Yeah, your technique really surprised us.”

“That’s right, this technique rivals your mentor Zhou Tong’s!”

Zhou Tong even said with some pride, “To tell you the truth, Luo Jian has long surpassed his mentor!”

Luo Jian sat silently at the side, but a hint of pride appeared on his face.

After the meal, the judges took the lead to leave.

Zhou Tong, on the other hand, pulled Luo Jian and said in a sullen voice, “Luo Jian, you have to pay special attention to that person called Qin Yu. This person isn’t easy to deal with.”

Luo Jian, however, said indifferently, “I know him. He’s just a martial artist. He’s not worth mentioning. It’s easy for me to win against him!”

Zhou Tong, however, said with a solemn expression, “Luo Jian, I believe in your strength, but Qin Yu isn’t easy to deal with. You have to do your best, understand? I will also secretly help you.”

Luo Jian said with a nonchalant smile, “Sir, I said that I don’t need your help. I can defeat him easily!”

Zhou Tong frowned slightly. Just as he was about to speak, Luo Jian waved his hand.

Then, he saw Luo Jian spread out his palm. In his palm, flames actually condensed.

When he saw this flame, Zhou Tong’s pupils suddenly dilated! He suddenly stood up straight!

“This... this is spiritual fire?” Zhou Tong swallowed hard, and his eyes were filled with amazement!

Luo Jian said with a nonchalant smile, “That’s right, sir, now you know why I have such confidence, right?”

Zhou Tong said somewhat excitedly, “I really didn’t misjudge you. Luo Jian, you’re a genius!”

To Zhou Tong, spiritual fire was something rare and precious.

He had worked hard all his life, but he had never succeeded in producing spiritual fire. Unexpectedly, his disciple had already mastered spiritual fire!

Luo Jian said with a nonchalant smile, “Sir, just watch how I beat him.”

With that, Luo Jian turned around and walked out.

In the afternoon, the final competition of the Chinese Medicine Conference officially began.

What surprised Qin Yu was that the final competition was completely different from the previous advancement competition. The venue was full of people!

Many high-ranking officials and noblemen had come to the venue to watch. There were also countless low profile martial arts experts as well.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and quickly understood.

These high-ranking officials and noblemen also wanted to build a good relationship with the victor. If there was an opportunity, they would probably take the opportunity to recruit him.

“Mr. Qin, good luck.” Mr. Yang said somewhat excitedly.

Qin Yu nodded and said with a smile, “Mr. Yang, don’t worry.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked straight to the stage.

Coincidentally, Luo Jian was standing next to Qin Yu. The distance between the two of them was no more than two meters.

“You’re Qin Yu?” Luo Jian glanced at Qin Yu and asked indifferently.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and ignored him.

Luo Jian wasn’t angry. He snorted lightly and said, “You humiliated my mentor, right?”

Qin Yu still ignored him. He just closed his eyes to recover the spiritual energy in his body.

“Humph, putting on airs.” Luo Jian couldn’t help but snort.

“I announce that the final competition of the Chinese Medicine Conference begins now!” At this time, the host walked up to the stage and shouted!

After the shout, a few people carried the medicine baskets up.

These medicine baskets were filled with herbs for the participants to use.

Qin Yu lowered his head and glanced at his own medicine baskets. He couldn’t help but frown.

Because his medicine baskets were filled with almost abandoned herbs! Not to mention spiritual energy, but even the medicinal effects were almost nonexistent!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He couldn’t help but look at Zhou Tong, who was below the stage.

As expected, Zhou Tong had a proud smile on his face. He looked at Qin Yu provocatively.

“What a despicable person.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself inside.

“The competition time is one hour. In one hour, the judges will decide the winner! Let’s start now!” The host shouted.

After the shout, the contestants on the stage began to refine medicine rapidly.

Luo Tong, who was at the side, did the same. He skillfully threw the herbs into the pot and then glanced at Qin Yu.

Only Qin Yu stood there with a frown without moving at all.

Because these herbs couldn’t be used at all.

“Let’s see how you win!” Zhou Tong sneered.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “It seems that I can only use that method.”

After saying that, he threw all the abandoned herbs into the pot.

Then, Qin Yu poured water, started a fire, and began to boil the herbs.

The people below the stage couldn’t help but frown and say, “What method is this? Throwing all the herbs in and stewing them in one pot?”

“I think this kid doesn’t know how to refine medicine at all. Does he think that this is stewing pork?”

“I heard that the Soul Nourishment Pill was produced by him. It’s probably a lie.”

Zhou Tong couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Is he giving up on himself? Hahaha, I’ve never seen such a technique before!” Zhou Tong sneered repeatedly.

At the same time, Zhou Tong was also rejoicing inside.

This way, Qin Yu would have no way to push the responsibility of the herbs being unuseable onto himself!

Despite hearing the discussions, Qin Yu remained silent. He only focused on increasing the flames and boiling the herbs into a paste as soon as possible.

Very soon, the herbs in Qin Yu’s pot were boiled into porridge, but there wasn’t a single hint of medicinal fragrance in it.

“Qin Yu, if you boil the herbs like this, the medicinal effects will have been completely drained. Is there still a need to continue?” Luo Jian sneered.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He just stared at the pot of medicinal herbs.

“Hehe, you really don’t live up to your reputation. I think you should hurry up and scram. Don’t embarrass yourself!” Luo Jian continued to ridicule.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “I indeed don’t live up to my reputation, but it shouldn’t be a problem to beat you.”

With that, Qin Yu suddenly raised his palm and inserted his hand into the paste-like medicinal herbs!

Waves of spiritual energy surged out from Qin Yu’s palm! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In an instant, the pot of paste-like herbs turned light blue!
