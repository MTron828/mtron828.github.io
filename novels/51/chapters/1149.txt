Chapter 1150: Chapter 1,150, the might of a mighty figure 

At this moment, Gu Xinghe’s entire body was exuding a monstrous aura. It was like a vast ocean, surging over. No one dared to ignore it!

Qin Yu also felt the extremely terrifying internal Qi that was released from his body!

This internal Qi even surpassed that of the eight higher-ups!

“Gu Xinghe?”Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

Hearing Qin Yu’s voice, Gu Xinghe’s eyes suddenly looked over! A bright light shot out from his eyes, heading straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s feet shook, and his body rose into the air, brushing past the bright light.

“Boom!”

The bright light hit the ground, creating a huge crater!

“Gu Xinghe, why are you here?”Qin Yu asked with a cold face.

“I should be the one asking you this! Don’t forget, this is my home!”Gu Xinghe shouted.

“Today, I will tell you that I, Gu Xinghe, will definitely get back what I lost!”

With that, Gu Xinghe did not waste any time and arrived in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye!

This extremely fast speed made Qin Yu’s heart skip a beat!

Before he could react, Gu Xinghe had already slapped his palm towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did not have the time to dodge and could only activate his green wood true body. He crossed his arms in front of him and forcefully withstood this palm!

“Bang!”

Qin Yu’s entire body instantly shot towards the ground!

“Boom!”

Like a golden fireball, Qin Yu’s body sank into the ground, creating a huge pit that was more than ten meters deep!

“What a terrifying power...”Qin Yu got up from the ground, and his face couldn’t help but change!

This seemingly ordinary palm directly shattered the green wood true body!

Qin Yu knew that the Gu Xinghe in front of him was definitely not the weak Gu Xinghe from before.

Therefore, he didn’t dare to be negligent and immediately activated the fourth level of the fighting word formula!

A terrifying surge of genuine qi burst out from the pit, like a pillar of light, piercing straight into the sky!

Seeing this, a trace of surprise flashed across Gu Xinghe’s eyes. He then snorted coldly, “No wonder you could defeat my father. You have some ability.”

At this moment, Qin Yu walked out from the pit.

He raised his head to look at Gu Xinghe in front of him and said coldly, “Gu Xinghe, it seems that you have benefited greatly from the first mystic realm.”

“Cut the crap. I came here today to take revenge!”Gu Xinghe did not say anything more and directly slapped out of thin air!

A huge palm print instantly slapped towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu let out an angry shout, the veins on his right arm bulged, and then he suddenly clenched his fist to meet it!

“Boom!”

This was an extremely terrifying collision, waves of internal Qi rapidly spread out in all directions!

Even though the surrounding crowd hurriedly blocked it, they were still sent flying.

It was not an exaggeration to say that even the second mystical realm could not withstand such a big battle, and cracks appeared one after another!

Qin Yu was also in a bad mood. This slap almost broke his arm. The powerful penetrating force even caused his body to bleed non-stop!

Looking at Qin Yu who was struggling to hold on, a trace of ridicule flashed across Gu Xinghe’s face.

“If you can withstand one slap, then what about the second one?”Gu Xinghe did not say another word and sent another slap over!

The two palms overlapped, and Qin Yu couldn’t take it anymore. His body was slammed into the ground!

“This Gu Xinghe... how can he have this kind of strength!”Someone exclaimed.

Gu Xinghe looked at Qin Yu coldly. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, you are not my match. Kneel down obediently and bow. Maybe I can consider sparing you.”

However, How Could Qin Yu admit defeat? He stood up from the ground once again. Under the enhancement of the ‘fighting’formula, his fighting spirit was overflowing!

“One punch can break ten thousand techniques!”

Qin Yu did not say anything more. His internal Qi gathered into his right fist and smashed fiercely at Gu Xinghe!

Gu Xinghe snorted. He raised his hand and casually grabbed his fist.

At the moment of collision, Gu Xinghe’s expression suddenly changed!

The power of this punch was much greater than he had imagined!

The light surrounding his palm was instantly shattered, and his palm was almost smashed into pieces!

Gu Xinghe frowned slightly and hurriedly shot backward.

He looked at his right hand that was about to explode, and a hint of amusement appeared on his face.

“Amazing, Amazing!”Gu Xinghe laughed out loud.

“I didn’t expect you to be able to hurt me in my current state.”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

The punch just now had been unleashed under the enhancement of the DOU word formula.

But even so, Gu Xinghe still managed to withstand it. He only injured one hand, and even his arm was intact. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Then I’ll let you see what I can do,”Gu Xinghe said with a cold smile.

He raised his hand, and streams of true energy gathered in his palm.

“Fuyao Sacred Seal!”

Gu Xinghe murmured, and a huge seal appeared on his palm!

He pressed his left hand forward lightly, and the huge seal whistled forward!

The strong pressure almost made people unable to stand up! Everyone within a radius of several kilometers was instantly smacked to the ground!

Before the Great Seal arrived, the ground began to shatter. The surrounding void was like broken glass, making loud crashing sounds!

Seeing that the great seal was getting closer and closer to the ground, finally, the surrounding pavilion master and the others could not bear it anymore. Their bodies suddenly stuck to the ground, and streaks of blood appeared on their bodies!

Qin Yu forcefully withstood the pressure. He raised his arms, and golden light shot out in all directions. Then, he raised his hands to meet the Great Seal!

The Great Seal was like a towering mountain, and the pressure was immense!

Qin Yu roared furiously, and his two arms held the great seal tightly. Golden light shone from his body and spread out in all directions!

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu roared. He had already exerted his strength to the limit, but he was still unable to stop the Great Seal’s crushing pressure!

Every pore on Qin Yu’s body began to bleed, and the ground beneath his feet began to crack inch by inch, as if an earthquake had occurred!

“Boom!”

Finally, Qin Yu could no longer endure it. His body was ruthlessly crushed under the Great Seal.
