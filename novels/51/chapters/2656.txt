Chapter 2657: Asking

“However, there’s something about this Hua Tian that gives me chills. He’s incredibly mysterious. If we’re going to support someone in the end, he’s the most suitable candidate. If even I can see through him easily, then he’s not worthy of being the Lord of this realm.”

Gu Yi shook his head, his expression somewhat dejected.

At the onset of the collapse of order here, he had entertained some wild thoughts.

However, Dan’s return and his words extinguished those wild ideas completely. They were merely living beings born from this place, destined to be bound by this world’s constraints forever. That couldn’t be changed.

“Besides, these matters are inconsequential to the plane. We needn’t concern ourselves with them. I must now consider the follow-up matters carefully.” “Yes, Master,” Gu Tian said, bowing respectfully.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu, who was amid cultivation, felt a growing sense of unease.

Regardless, he found it difficult to calm his soul. This was an entirely new sensation for him.

“My friend Qin Yu seems somewhat troubled,” a cold voice came from outside the door.

“My friend Jing Xin,” Qin Yu responded, quickly opening the door.

“Master has scheduled a dao lecture for today. She sent me to inquire whether you wish to attend. It’s a rare opportunity,” Jing Xin said with a smile.

“Naturally, I’ll attend,” Qin Yu replied promptly.

Since breaking through the peak of Human Consciousness, he had encountered many obstacles. This was a chance for him to gain clarity.

“The lecture will commence in four hours, in the main hall of the dao lecture hall,” Jing Xin informed him softly.

Four hours later, Qin Yu and the peak master arrived punctually at the dao lecture hall.

Taking in the scene, Qin Yu noted that the vast hall was already filled with people. Even the square outside was packed with members of the Demon Sealing Valley.

With a wry smile, Qin Yu found a spot to sit outside as Elder Xin Yue made her entrance.

After the initial commotion died down, Elder Xin Yue began the lecture without much preamble.

For the next two days, Elder Xin Yue delved into various topics, including inner cultivation techniques and the distinction between Human Consciousness and True Consciousness.

She then proceeded to demonstrate her cultivation methods verbally and manually, leaving a deep impression on everyone present.

This lecture not only solidified Qin Yu’s current half-step True Consciousness cultivation realm but also shed light on many lingering questions.

Although he wasn’t affiliated with any cultivation sect, he found common ground in many of the practices.

Suddenly, a deep sound emanated from the ground of the Demon Sealing Valley.

It seemed as though it had been subjected to a terrifying force from the deepest depths, as a massive crack tore open in the middle of the dao lecture hall. This crevice extended to an unseen horizon.

In the distance, demonic qi continued to billow forth, enveloping the entire Demon Sealing Valley.

“Don’t fret. It’s just that everything that was meant to happen has come to pass,” Xin Yue remarked, rising to her feet with a trace of sorrow in her expression.

“Today’s lecture ends here. Junior disciples, you may depart,” Jing Xin announced to the anxious disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley.

“My friend Qin Yu, please hold on.” Jing Xin interjected, halting Qin Yu as he moved to leave with the others.

Meanwhile, outside the Demon Sealing Valley, Hua Tian appeared and was engaged in fierce combat with the invading ancient demons.

At this point, his power had firmly reached the True Consciousness Realm, rendering most of the ancient demons no longer a threat to him.

Furthermore, upon inspection with his Heavenly Eye, he found no hostile presence in the vicinity, leaving him with little cause for concern. “Hahaha, become the nourishment for my Saint Power.”

Hua Tian bellowed triumphantly. A colossal fist, reminiscent of a giant serpent, materialized from the void and pulverized the ancient demons in its path into mincemeat. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As Daozu once said: “Dao begets one, one begets two, two begets three.”

From this perspective, fate was also derived from the Dao, emerging from the void. The Book of Changes discussed symbolic numbers, where symbolism preceded numbers. Symbolism represented infinite change, while numbers merely represented the rules of change, bringing something from nothing.

Thus, everything had its destiny, indicating that natural laws could not be surpassed, and one had to align with the cosmic order; only then could one harness the blessings of natural energy.

Hua Tian’s face twisted into a maniacal grin. After his rampage, he sensed his cosmic luck, his destiny, seemingly growing stronger once again.

He had already surmised that something was amiss here.

Outsiders like them were undoubtedly among the choices of the Demon Sealing Valley. Once chosen, they would undoubtedly receive significant cosmic luck, which explained his recent surge in power.

At this point, fate was already leaning in his favor, but he needed to secure his position further. Killing these ancient demons would undoubtedly elevate his status within the Demon Sealing Valley.

Furthermore, having made a pact with Wu Tian, he knew the formidable ancient demons in this area would not pose a threat to him.

As Hua Tian slaughtered the ancient demons, he silently plotted his next moves.

Meanwhile, within the Dao lecture hall, Qin Yu, Xin Yue, and Jing Xin found themselves alone.

“Elder Xin Yue, do you have any instructions?” Qin Yu inquired, his tone respectful.

“Qin Yu, let me ask you if the Demon Sealing Valley were to spare no effort to aid you, and if the valley were to face peril, would you be willing to sacrifice yourself to assist us?” Xin Yue posed her question suddenly.

“No, please forgive me, Elder,” Qin Yu responded after a prolonged silence.

He couldn’t bring himself to lie to this esteemed elder.

While he held respect for Elder Xin Yue’s faction, it wasn’t to the extent of risking his life for them.

Realizing that the Demon Sealing Valley had become a dead end for them, Qin Yu understood that breaking free from their current predicament would be challenging, let alone breaking the shackles in the future. He preferred to deal with situations as they arose. The present opportunity lay in the Dao Competition.

“The Dao Competition?” Qin Yu questioned, intrigued by the peculiar name.

‘Yes, it’s a competition held by the Demon Sealing Valley every fifty years. Even outsiders like you can participate,” Xin Yue explained..
