Watching Jiang Gu’s back as he left, Qin Yu remained silent.

Although Jiang Gu had followed Qin Yu for a long time, he knew very well that the two of them had maintained a certain distance.

Now, Qin Yu was already very gratified that Jiang Gu could make such a choice.

“Yao Qing, get ready. Follow me to Flood Dragon Village tonight,” said Qin Yu.

Yao Qing immediately became anxious.

He ran to Qin Yu’s side and said, “Mr. Qin, are you kidding? If you go to Flood Dragon Village now, aren’t you deliberately exposing yourself?”

Qin Yu glanced at Yao Qing and sighed slightly. “I also want to know how much strength I have now.”

“Then I’ll accompany you to practice,” Yao Qing muttered. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Enough, don’t say anything more. Get ready to set off.”

“Elder Qin, I want to go with you,” said Taozi as she walked forward.

Qin Yu glanced at Taozi and said, “What are you going for? Stay at home and refine pills.”

“I must go! If you’re injured, I can help you,” said Taozi stubbornly.

Qin Yu couldn’t refuse any further and could only nod in agreement.

That afternoon, Yao Qing drove Qin Yu and Taozi towards Flood Dragon Village.

Updates by

Flood Dragon Village was the Martial Arts Village specially set up by the Martial Arts Association. It was the most important place in Chuzhou’s martial arts world.

Even the Martial Arts Association of Chuzhou had elite forces stationed there.

Not only did they provide martial artists with herbs, but they also held competitions in Flood Dragon Village to stimulate the development of Chuzhou’s martial arts world.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that almost everyone in Flood Dragon Village was a martial artist.

It was said that the strongest among them had already stepped into the realm of an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

The car drove quickly. When Qin Yu arrived at Flood Dragon Village, the sky had already darkened.

“As expected of the Martial Arts Village. I can feel a strong internal qi fluctuation as soon as I get out of the car,” Yao Qing sniffed and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He looked at his watch and said, “There is a street in Flood Dragon Village called Divine Dragon Street. Unusual treasures often appear on this street.”

Yao Qing’s expression changed slightly.

He said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, I have specially investigated Flood Dragon Village over the past few days. I also have some understanding of the Divine Dragon Street.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and signaled Yao Qing to continue.

Yao Qing continued, “In order to stimulate the development of martial arts, Flood Dragon Town set up different rules in the Divine Dragon Street.”

“It is said that as long as you are strong enough, you can forcefully buy and sell, or even rob someone. As long as no one is killed, no one will care.”

A hint of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

Qin Yu was a little surprised about this.

Usually, people would maintain order on these streets and alleys. They were afraid that someone would break the rules and kill people for their goods.

But the Flood Dragon Village actually did the opposite. It was simply unheard of.

“If that’s the case, how could people with low strength levels dare to go?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

Yao Qing nodded and said, “Yes, so in Flood Dragon Village, there is a special kind of bodyguard industry. As long as you have money, you can hire top-notch martial artists to go to the Divine Dragon Street.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “Then why don’t these hired top-notch martial artists go to the Divine Dragon Street to rob themselves? Wouldn’t that make the money come faster?”

“That’s right.” Yao Qing nodded slightly.

“This kind of thing has happened before. Once a treasure that is attractive enough appears, the so-called bodyguards will immediately betray them.”

“So, in the end, it’s more reliable if you have the ability.”

Qin Yu agreed with this.

“The Divine Dragon Street is really quite different... Let’s go to the Divine Dragon Street.” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Yao Qing was instantly speechless.

The reason he said all this was to persuade Qin Yu to leave.

He not only failed, but aroused Qin Yu’s interest instead.

“D*mn it, let’s go. If I’m cornered, I’ll start a massacre!” Yao Qing muttered.

He knew that Qin Yu wouldn’t listen to his advice, so he could only let it go.

The three of them drove towards the Divine Dragon Street.

Soon, the three of them appeared near the Divine Dragon Street.

As soon as they got out of the car, Qin Yu felt a few streams of powerful internal qi.

Among them, there were the most Inner Strength Past Masters and few Inner Strength Grandmasters. As for Inner Strength Grandmasters, Qin Yu only found three of them.

“Mr. Qin, do we really have to go in? Why don’t you put on the green hat?” Yao Qing flipped his palm and took out the magic tool hat that he had prepared.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “You should put it on yourself.”

After saying this, Qin Yu strode toward the Divine Dragon Street.

Although the Divine Dragon Street was known as a treasure street, this was Chuzhou after all. The resources there were limited, so there weren’t many treasures in the Divine Dragon Street.

Herbs that were decades old and hundreds of years old could be seen everywhere.

To the current Qin Yu, they no longer had any appeal.

While walking on this street, Yao Qing looked frightened and was trembling nonstop.

He kept looking around, because he was afraid that someone would attack him.

“Hello.”

At this moment, someone patted Yao Qing’s shoulder.

Yao Qing suddenly turned his head and shouted, “What do you want?! Let me tell you, I’m not afraid of you!”

The other party was stunned and said suspiciously, “I just want to ask if you need any medicinal herbs. I just picked them on the mountain. Why are you so nervous?”

Yao Qing wiped the sweat on his forehead and said awkwardly, “Sorry...”

“Look at how much sweat is flowing from your forehead. It must be kidney deficiency. This herb of mine can nourish your body. Do you want to buy some?” The other party said with a smile.

“You’re the one with kidney deficiency! Hurry up and scram!” Yao Qing scolded impatiently.

Qin Yu was amused.

Yao Qing was obviously scared out of his wits. He was afraid of everything.

As they continued to walk forward, the gazes around him became more and more hostile.

Qin Yu could clearly feel that there were dozens of gazes on him from both sides of the street.

“Mr. Qin, I suddenly feel so cold...” Yao Qing grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and whispered.

Qin Yu looked calm and composed, as if he was strolling leisurely.

“Look, is that person Qin Yu?” Someone whispered in the dark.

“It seems to be him! And that perverted-looking kid next to him is Qin Yu’s follower.”

“Yes, I didn’t dare to confirm it until I saw that white-haired perverted-looking man, but now, I’m sure that he is Qin Yu!”

Yao Qing blushed and he was extremely angry.

“Mr. Qin, am I perverted-looking?” Yao Qing muttered.

Before Qin Yu could answer, Taozi, who was next to him, nodded seriously and said, “Quite perverted-looking.”

The discussions around them grew louder and louder.

However, Qin Yu completely ignored them and continued walking along the Divine Dragon Street.

“Pfft!”

At this moment, Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood, and his face instantly turned a few shades paler.

“Qin Yu spat out blood. Looks like the rumors are true.”

“It looks like this kid is really seriously injured!”

“Now is a good time to kill him!”
