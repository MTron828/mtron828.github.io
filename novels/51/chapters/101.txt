Chapter 102: What Do You Want to Do? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Jiang’s eyes were filled with contempt.

This contemptuous gaze made this old servant extremely displeased!

He had had his way in South City for so many years, but no one had ever dared to look down on him like this!

“Get lost right now, and I can spare your life,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

The old servant laughed loudly and said, “No one has ever dared to speak to me like this!”

In the car, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

He, afraid that Yan Jiang wouldn’t be able to defeat this old man, kept staring out of the window.

“Gee, don’t worry,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

She took the snacks and asked, “Do you want to eat some?”

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “I’m not in the mood to eat snacks...”

“You’re just always worried about something.” Yan Ruoxue rolled her eyes and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. His eyes were fixed outside the window.

At this moment, the old servant made his move.

He raised his internal qi to the maximum. His palm turned into a claw again and he grabbed at Yan Jiang fiercely!

However, Yan Jiang didn’t move at all. He allowed the old servant’s palm to grab at him!

“Got him!” The old servant was delighted. His claw just happened to grab Yan Jiang’s chest!

However, in the next second, the old servant’s expression changed drastically!

It was because he realized that he couldn’t hurt Yan Jiang at all!

“Is that all you’ve got? No wonder you can only stay in the small South City,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

The old servant’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to retreat, but it was already too late!

Yan Jiang reached out and grabbed the old servant’s wrist, and then he used force to crush it!

“Ouch! ! !” The old servant cried out in pain!

Yan Jiang’s attacks were powerful, and he didn’t hesitate at all. He reached out his hand, and with a slap, he smashed the old servant’s head into pieces!

With just one move, Yan Jiang killed the old servant!

Qin Yu, who was in the car, couldn’t help but gulp!

Yan Jiang was actually that strong? How easy did he go on him last time?

“See, I told you not to worry.” Yan Ruoxue seemed to have expected this.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

As expected of someone from an aristocratic family in Jingdu. It was indeed far beyond his imagination.

Not far away, Liu Shihui’s expression was even uglier! The fact that he killed the old servant in one move, coupled with the Jingdu license plate, made Liu Shihui immediately feel uneasy!

These people were definitely from an aristocratic family in Jingdu!

“Sir, I didn’t know your identity. Please show mercy!” Liu Shihui quickly knelt down and bowed.

Yan Jiang walked in front of Liu Shihui and looked down at him. He didn’t move for a long time.

Liu Shihui hurriedly continued, “I didn’t know that man was a disciple of a prominent family in Jingdu. I’m willing to apologize and take all the responsibility!”

Yan Jiang sneered. “That man? You seem to be mistaken. I’m doing this for Miss Yan.”

“As for Qin Yu, he has nothing to do with us.” Yan Jiang snickered.

Qin Yu, who was sitting in the car, heard these words clearly!

“Yan Jiang is really quite vindictive.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself.

Liu Shihui, who was kneeling on the ground, hurriedly nodded and said, “I understand. Please show mercy and spare my life...”

Yan Jiang frowned. He sized up Liu Shihui and then snorted coldly. “Get lost.”

Liu Shihui immediately felt as if he had been pardoned and turned to run!

Then, Yan Jiang walked to the front of the car, bowed and said, “Miss Yan, it’s getting late. Please go back and rest early.”

Yan Ruoxue nodded and said, “Thank you for your hard work. You can go back now.”

“Yes, Miss Yan.” Yan Jiang bowed and then retreated to the side before watching the car leave.

Qin Yu had mixed feelings inside.

“So this is the capability of an Inner Strength Grandmaster.” Qin Yu took a deep breath. The desire to improve his strength as soon as possible grew stronger! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The car soon returned to the hotel.

Yan Ruoxue had booked a suite beforehand. After getting the room card, the two of them walked upstairs.

After arriving at the room, Yan Ruoxue winked at Qin Yu and said, “I’m going to take a shower first.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but blush.

And Yan Ruoxue seemed to like Qin Yu’s shy expression, so she leaned against Qin Yu’s ear and said softly, “Wait for me obediently.”

As soon as Yan Ruoxue said this, Qin Yu’s face instantly flushed all the way to the root of his neck!

Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but cover her mouth and laugh, then she went straight to the bathroom.

Qin Yu sat on the bed while growing more and more nervous.

When he heard the sound of running water coming from the bathroom, Qin Yu was even more on edge!

“Phew...”

To say that he didn’t have any lust was definitely a lie. With such a beautiful woman in front of him, no one could resist.

He could only breathe as hard as he could to calm himself down.

Half an hour later, Yan Ruoxue walked out of the bathroom.

She was only wearing a simple bathrobe, and her smooth skin appeared in front of Qin Yu.

Her fair skin formed a sharp contrast with her long black hair. Her perfect figure exuded an astonishing sense of charm. Her fair and smooth feet stepped on the ground, and everything about her was so alluring.

Qin Yu was momentarily stunned as blood gushed out from his nose.

“Pfft!”

Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but laugh. She rolled her eyes and asked, “Am I beautiful?”

“You’re... beautiful,” Qin Yu muttered softly.

“Hmm... am I really beautiful?” As she spoke, Yan Ruoxue walked to Qin Yu’s side and sat down.

Such a close distance between them almost made Qin Yu lose control!

He got a whiff of the bodily fragrance coming from Yan Ruoxue’s body, and his mind went blank!

Yan Ruoxue continued to lean on Qin Yu’s body. She used her fingers to gently slide over Qin Yu’s body, and said with a seductive smile, “What do you want to do?”
