Chapter 1030: Chapter 1,030, slaughtering the gods in anger!

The entire space shook non-stop, and the people around them fell into extreme fear.

This sudden change in the environment brought a fear of facing ignorance.

Qin Yu’s feet were also trembling non-stop. His body shook along with it, but his face didn’t show much fluctuation.

All of the fear came from the lack of strength. When one was strong enough, there was no need to fear anything.

He looked around. The green oil lamp was still shining brightly.

Something seemed to be coming out from under the ground.

And all of this was because of the giant ghost statue in front of him!

“What is this thing?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The giant ghost statue not far away suddenly opened its mouth slightly.

The bloody mouth emitted waves of stinky internal Qi.

“Netherworld... Holy Region!”

The ghost statue let out a roar, and then rows and rows of armored skeletons emerged from the ground!

These skeletons were like a well-trained and powerful army!

They held ancient weapons in their hands, and with neat steps, rows and rows of skeletons appeared on the ground!

“What... What is this thing!”

“Ghost... Ghost? Are We all dead?”

“I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die in such a confused manner!”

Everyone began to panic. They couldn’t be blamed for this, because the scene around them was extremely similar to hell!

Most importantly, the holy power that emanated from the ghost statue made people tremble!

It was clearly a ghost statue, but it looked like a god!

Facing a god, not to mention fighting, even the slightest disrespect was difficult!

Seeing the disciples around him kneel down one by one, Qin Yu’s face turned solemn.

“This technique is similar to the power of faith of western sects,”Qin Yu said with a frown.

Strangely, although Qin Yu could feel the holy power, he had no intention of kneeling down.

“Mortal, why don’t you bow when you see God!”

The huge ghost statue let out a solemn and mighty sound.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the ghost statue and said coldly, “What do you think? Why should I bow to you?”

“How dare you!”

Hearing Qin Yu’s disrespectful words, the ghost statue immediately let out a deafening sound!

At the same time, a skeleton suddenly moved.

He held the executioner’s broadsword in his hand and walked in front of a disciple of Qin.

The disciple was kneeling on the ground and trembling. He wanted to get up, but the fear in his heart made him unable to stand up at all!

Immediately after, the skeleton waved the executioner’s broadsword and slashed towards the disciple’s neck!

With a “Shua”sound, the head was directly chopped off!

The skeleton raised its palm and absorbed the Disciple’s divine sense into its body!

“Ah! !”

Seeing this scene, the disciples who were already terrified instantly felt as though they had lost their parents!

“We... I’m afraid we’ve really fallen into Hell...”

“It’s an execution... it’s an executioner from hell!”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

He originally thought that there wouldn’t be any injuries in this battle, but he didn’t expect that one of his disciples would still die.

The executioner skeleton held a large saber in his hand and walked towards the other disciple.

He waved the large saber in his hand in mid-air, and then ruthlessly slashed towards the neck of the second disciple!

At this moment, Qin Yu stepped forward and swung his fist towards the executioner skeleton!

This punch contained boundless might, and instantly shattered the executioner skeleton into pieces!

“How dare you, Mortal!”

The ghost statue seemed to have been angered by Qin Yu’s actions!

“You dare to defy the gods, I will betray you and send you to the eighteen levels of hell!”The ghost statue roared repeatedly!

Qin Yu sneered, “Send me to hell? Before that, I will send you back first.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked towards the large ghost statue. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

His feet shook and his chariot-like fist carried rolling might as it ruthlessly smashed towards the ghost statue!

At this moment, the ghost statue opened its mouth. Its mouth rapidly enlarged, as if it had turned into a huge door!

And Qin Yu’s body directly sank into his bloody mouth!

“Overconfident mortal...”after Devouring Qin Yu, the ghost statue’s eyes widened in anger as it looked at the many heaven gate disciples present!

“It’s over... Even the sect master hasn’t been devoured by him. He’s probably really a god from hell...”

“We’ve gotten into big trouble this time. I don’t want to go to Hell...”

“Let me go, let me go...”

However, this ghost statue had no feelings, so how could it care about their begging for mercy?

The ghost statue opened its big mouth, and the big door opened again, ready to swallow everyone inside!

However, the moment it opened its mouth, Qin Yu rushed out of the mouth.

Looking at the ghost statue in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

After entering his body, Qin Yu seemed to have fallen into another world.

No matter how Qin Yu swung his fist, it would smash into nothingness.

“Could this ghost statue really be a god from hell?”At this moment, even Qin Yu began to doubt.

After being swallowed into his stomach, Qin Yu’s body seemed to be falling into another world.

His body was sinking rapidly, and his surroundings were empty.

Although it was different from the legendary hell, there was still a strong sense of fear in his heart.

“Could it be that this is really a god that was summoned through some kind of method?”Qin Yu frowned.

He looked at a disciple behind him and said coldly, “Stand up. These skeletons don’t have any battle strength yet. Why are they kneeling on the ground?”

“Gate... Gate Master, I can’t stand up at all...”the disciple said in fear.

“It’s as if something is pressing down on my heart. Fear, fear, respect, fear...”

Qin Yu touched his chin as if he had guessed something.

“I understand.”Qin Yu laughed coldly.

He looked at the ghost statue in front of him and shouted, “You are indeed a god. I admit it, but you don’t have any fighting strength, right?”

“How dare you, Mortal!”

The ghost statue ignored Qin Yu’s words and continued to shout.

Qin Yu sneered, “You should be relying on the power of a god... or an aura? This kind of aura can not be withstood by an ordinary person. They won’t even have the thought of fighting back, and then they will become meat for slaughter...”

“In other words, if I am not afraid of you, if I am not afraid of a god, you can’t do anything to me, right?”

The ghost statue’s eyes were as wide as copper bells, but it didn’t say a word.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of a sentence:

If you believe it, you have it. If you don’t believe it, you don’t have it.

Perhaps it was the same principle.

As long as you weren’t afraid, the ghosts and gods couldn’t hurt you at all!

“Whether you’re a god or an evil ghost, I’ll let you taste my fist today!”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and a golden light rose from his body.
