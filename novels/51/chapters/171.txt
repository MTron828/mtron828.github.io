Qin Yu’s sudden move caught them all off guard!

However, just as Qin Yu was about to slap Jiang Yu’s face, a hand suddenly reached out and grabbed Qin Yu’s wrist.

After turning around, he saw Wei Ming holding Qin Yu tightly.

“Mr. Qin, don’t.” Wei Ming shook his head at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, calm down.” Even Mr. Wu advised him.

This made Qin Yu frown.

Their attitude clearly showed that Jiang Yu was of extraordinary status.

“You want to hit me?” Jiang Yu narrowed his eyes.

“You want to hit me? Do you know who I am?” Jiang Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu ignored Jiang Yu. He looked at Wei Ming and said, “What’s going on?”

Wei Ming pulled Qin Yu aside and said, “In short, I’ll give you the herbs. Don’t ask anymore, okay?”

“No.” Qin Yu broke free from Wei Ming’s restraints.

He turned to Mr. Yang and said, “Mr. Yang, tell me the truth. What exactly is going on?”

Mr. Yang seemed to be in a dilemma. He wanted to say it, but he felt that it was inappropriate.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I, Qin Yu, can bear all the consequences.”

At this moment, Jiang Yu laughed and said, “You want to know? Fine, let me tell you!”

“I like your Nine Dragon Pill. I forcefully exchanged your Nine Dragon Pill with an ordinary ginseng. Why? Is there a problem?” Jiang Yu said indifferently.

“As expected.” Qin Yu understood.

He looked at Wei Ming, then looked at Mr. Yang, and said in a somber voice, “Thank you for your good intentions, but the truth comes out eventually.”

Things had developed to this point, and it was far beyond Wei Ming’s control.

“Alright, Qin Yu, forget it.” Mr. Wu pulled Qin Yu’s arm.

Jiang Yu, who was at the side, sneered. “Did you see that? The people around you are all trying to stop you because they know very well what it means to offend the Jiang family.”

Qin Yu looked at Jiang Yu coldly and said, “What does it mean to offend you?”

Jiang Yu was stunned, then he frowned and said, “Are you provoking me?”

Qin Yu ignored this sentence and repeated, “Let me ask you, what does it mean to offend you?”

Jiang Yu seemed to be enraged. He said with a cold expression, “Offending me means offending the Jiang family. Offending the Jiang family means that you can’t survive in Chuzhou!”

“Qin Yu, forget it.” Mr. Wu shook his head.

Then, he looked at Jiang Yu and said, “Jiang Yu, stop talking.”

However, Jiang Yu didn’t stop. He sneered and said, “Qin Yu, let me tell you. I’m already showing you respect by giving you an ordinary ginseng. If you know what’s good for you, you should be grateful, understand?”

Qin Yu sneered again and again.

He pushed away Mr. Wu’s hand, looked at Jiang Yu coldly and said, “Your arrogant attitude of looking down on everyone really makes me unhappy.”

“Hehe, so what?” Jiang Yu raised his eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “If you return the Nine Dragon Pill now, I can let it go.”

“Return the Nine Dragon Pill?” Jiang Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered. “I’ve already eaten it, so how can I return it? How about I sh*t it out for you?”

After saying that, Jiang Yu burst into laughter.

Qin Yu held back his anger and said, “Then ask your family to send a stalk of hundred-year-old herbs.”

“Ask my family?” Jiang Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “It seems that you really don’t know the Jiang Family!”

“Kid, let me tell you clearly. Even if I snatch this Nine Dragon Pill out in the open, you have to suck it up!” Jiang Yu shouted.

Following his angry roar, the two bodyguards beside Jiang Yu immediately took a step forward.

At the same time, intense qi energy burst out from their bodies!

“Inner Strength Past Master!” Wei Ming’s expression changed.

Jiang Yu said coldly, “You have already angered me. It’s best for you to disappear from my sight right now.”

“What if I don’t disappear?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Jiang Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Then I’ll cripple you.”

The two bodyguards moved forward once again, and the terrifying qi energy approached Qin Yu!

Qin Yu was unfazed and said coldly, “With just the two of them?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu waved his large hand, and the terrifying force sent the two bodyguards flying!

The crowd couldn’t help but exclaim in shock. Even Wei Ming and Mr. Wu couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

To send two Inner Strength Past Masters flying with a wave of his hand, what kind of strength was that?

Jiang Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “You dare to hit my people?”

“Not only do I want to hit your people, but I also want to hit you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

As he spoke, Qin Yu took another step toward Jiang Yu.

However, Jiang Yu wasn’t afraid at all. On the contrary, he was calm and collected.

“Stop scaring people. In Chuzhou, no one dares to touch me,” Jiang Yu said indifferently.

“Is that so?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and was about to attack!

At this moment, Wei Ming hurriedly grabbed Qin Yu’s arm.

He shook his head desperately and said, “Mr. Qin, calm down! You can’t afford to offend Jiang Yu!”

“Qin Yu, you’re not from the provincial capital. You don’t know the power of the Jiang family,” even Mr. Wu said in a somber voice.

“The Jiang family not only has many top-tier martial artists, but they have extremely powerful connections as well.”

“If you beat him up, no one can save you!” Mr. Wu said in a somber voice.

“Yes, it’s not too late to endure it for a while and take revenge later!” Wei Ming advised.

The internal qi on Qin Yu’s body immediately weakened.

He stood there silently while thinking about something.

“Kid, did you hear that? Didn’t you want to hit me? Why? Are you scared now?” Jiang Yu sneered.

He was used to getting his way in Chuzhou. In all these years, no one had ever challenged the Jiang family’s authority.

Therefore, no matter who Jiang Yu faced, he wouldn’t show any fear.

Qin Yu’s internal qi had been completely restrained. Wei Ming and Mr. Wu also heaved a sigh of relief.

Just when the two of them thought that things had calmed down, Qin Yu suddenly gave Jiang Yu a hard slap in the face!

This slap sent Jiang Yu flying! It was unknown how many tables had been smashed before he finally stopped!

Qin Yu looked at Jiang Yu coldly and said, “Turns out the Jiang family is powerful, but unfortunately, bullying the weak and fearing the strong isn’t reflective of my character.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Qin Yu, you!” Mr. Wu and Wei Ming’s expressions instantly turned extremely ugly!

As for the others around, their expressions were even more ashen!

There was actually someone who dared to hit a member of the Jiang family? Was he crazy?

Just as everyone was feeling shocked, Qin Yu walked towards Jiang Yu.

He grabbed Jiang Yu like he was holding a chick and strode out of the door.

When he walked to Mr. Wu’s side, Qin Yu stopped and smiled. “Mr. Wu, please pass a message to the Jiang family and ask them to exchange a stalk of hundred-year-old herb for him.”
