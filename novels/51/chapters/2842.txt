Chapter 2843: Living Towards Death

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The branches of the Guardian of Order involved information, money, and even countless cultivators.

“What’s wrong with that old dog Shangguan? He is only fickle-minded. Watch as I pull out your branches one by one.”

Chang Mang laughed heartily. His sullen expression instantly lessened.

Shangguan Siming, who was standing far away, turned pale.

A huge organization involved many complicated aspects, especially when it was finally condensed into one.

These people all had their matters, thus they could form a giant.

Shangguan Siming’s current cultivation was also related to this organization.

But now, Chang Mang had shaken his position. He was able to intimidate the four leaders.

However, he could not intimidate everyone in the Guardian of Order. Moreover, his expression turned completely cold when he saw the direction in which Qin Yu was heading.

The Endless Mine was the most important place for the Guardian of Order.

“You’re courting death!”

A sense of fear of death enveloped Chang Mang. He subconsciously dodged to the side.

A breath later, the terrifying black flame storm hit him.

A gash appeared on his right arm, which was as smooth as a mirror. The black flames on it were still burning.

A black dragon burned with flames in front of him and blocked his path.

It was a huge black dragon tens of thousands of meters long. At this moment, it was using its body as a bow to launch the earth-shattering spear attack together with Shangguan Siming.

This spear was called Lightning Rush.

“The intent is faster than the lightning. I’m surprised that you’re still alive.”

Shangguan Siming smiled faintly.

Although he still looked calm, his anger had reached its peak.

The black dragon slowly shuttled around his body. Even the cultivators with peak power might not withstand the power this black dragon emitted.

“Come on! Mother f*cker!”

Chang Mang dashed towards Shangguan Siming like a meteor.

Heaven Punishing Palm!

He slapped Shangguan Siming with his palm.

“You really look down on me, Chang Mang!”

Shangguan Siming didn’t even move. Chang Mang was sent flying with a swing of the dragon’s tail.

The terrifying power caused Chang Mang to vomit another mouthful of blood. He turned around.

He used himself to block Jue Wu just before he reached the ground.

A ravine nearly a thousand meters long was formed on the ground.

In the next moment, Chang Mang charged out once more.

Heaven Punishing Palm!

“You really don’t have a good memory!”

Shangguan Siming shook his head and the black dragon swung its tail again.

Void Shattering Finger!

At the moment of contact, Chang Mang changed his palm to a finger.

The finger pierced through the dragon’s tail and then a boundless power rushed into the dragon’s body.

He was sent flying again.

The black dragon let out a frenzied roar. Although the wound was almost invisible compared to its size, the power that rushed into its body did make it feel abnormally painful.

“Come on!”

Chang Mang laughed maniacally.

Heaven Suppressing Pagoda! Great Annihilation Fist!

Chang Mang clenched his teeth and mustered all his strength as he charged forward.

An austere peak power emanated from him as if it had infected Chang Mang’s will.

“Step down, black dragon.”

A strange look flashed across Shangguan Siming’s face.

As the fists’ shadows filled the sky, the space they came into contact with collapsed.

Break the illusion!

Shangguan Siming accurately received Chang Mang’s fist.

Almost at the same time, the other hand pierced through Chang Mang’s body.

A huge bloody hole appeared in Chang Mang’s abdomen.

Boom!

The black dragon released a dragon breath simultaneously, smashing into Chang Mang’s chest.

His entire body was blasted to the ground like a cannonball.

“I’m sorry, Auntie Jue Wu.”

Two bloody holes appeared on Chang Mang’s chest and abdomen.

He wanted to charge out again, but his body could no longer keep up with his thoughts.

He tried his best to raise his strength, but his body only moved a little.

“If this kid grows up, he might become a terrifying existence that isn’t inferior to Ye Qiubai.”

Looking at Chang Mang struggling to get up, Shangguan Siming’s face flashed with admiration.

“It’s fine, brat. I’ll let you off this time. Stand up.”

Jue Wu almost fell but a hand caught her.

“Old dog Shangguan! Is that all you have?”

Chang Mang laughed.

Although his voice was a little low, it was still full of arrogance.

Whoosh!

The spear pierced through his right arm.

The black dragon’s tail struck Chang Mang’s leg.

Chang Mang, who was already exhausted, had his legs broken.

Jue Wu wanted to extend his hand to protect Chang Mang, but she was also exhausted like Chang Mang.

Shangguan Siming might want to show off his authority besides to lure Qin Yu over.

He was not in a hurry as he continued torturing Chang Mang.

“Has the news already spread?”

He sent a voice transmission to the Guardian of Order nearby. He was relieved after receiving an affirmative reply.

Boom! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The space where Chang Mang and Jue Wu were exploded violently.

A black spear burning with flames pierced through the space and turned the two of them into ashes.

The space slowly recovered. Not even sand could exist in it.

Shangguan Siming didn’t know why, but he felt uneasy.

“I see.”

In another place, a monk was sitting on a praying mat.

A few people with extremely powerful internal qi were beside him.

They were the real chess players behind this game. Shangguan Siming was just a gun in their hands.

“Living towards death, it’s a pity that he lacks a guardian.”

Chen Zhisha said softly.

At this moment, the four Boundless Hearts of Saint Kingdom were spinning in the air.

They slowly broke down into 36 Hearts of Saint Kingdom, which then penetrated through space and disappeared into various parts of the Saint Kingdom.

These Hearts of Saint Kingdom formed a massive array.

They emitted a heavy internal qi with the Saint Kingdom as the foundation.

Consciousness in the space made Shangguan Siming’s expression turn ugly.

“Old dog, come and hit me!”

That was Chang Mang’s consciousness. At this moment, Chang Mang felt this Saint Kingdom was his body.

His divine soul and thoughts seemed to have become fragments of this Saint Kingdom.

The floating Hearts of Saint Kingdom carried his consciousness.

This was the true power of the Divine Might Chasing Star.

He needed to live towards death and maintain his self-awareness between life and death.

Then, he would use the Hearts of the Holy Kingdom to fuse with this Saint Kingdom in an instant.

This was the true power of the Divine Might Chasing Star.

However, the difficulty lay in the way to maintain his will when he died.

As a result, only Ye Qiubai had the prestige of the only inheritance of the Divine Might Chasing Star in the past billions of years.

This time, Chang Mang had completed Ye Qiubai’s path in this life-and-death situation.

Just like Chang Mang, the phoenix cries filled the sky.

Countless divine phoenix spirits descended here. The phoenix cries wrapped around Jue Wu’s divine soul.

They gathered in this world.
