Chapter 1205: Chapter 1205, the immortal slaying sect’s legacy technique 

He Teng’s eyes emitted a blood-red radiance.

This radiance floated in the air like an internal QI.

“I also want to fight with you...”He Teng said sinisterly.

“Unfortunately, now is not the time. I don’t think you will take advantage of the situation...”

He Teng shook his broken arm and opened his mouth wide.

Qin Yu sneered, “For a person like you, killing you is the only goal. Taking advantage of the situation? Even if you die, I will step on you again.”

“Hahaha... good, good. Unfortunately, I will not make a move today. We will meet again if we are fated...”

He Teng threw down these words and directly pierced through the void. Then, his body burrowed into the void and escaped.

That speed was something that even Qin Yu could not pursue with his desolate divine eyes.

Qin Yu could not help but frown as he looked in the direction he had left.

He did not expect that he would still be able to escape in the end.

In mid-air, the twenty mighty figures had solemn expressions as if they were waiting for Qin Yu’s next words.

“Qin Yu, it has nothing to do with us if he escapes,”a mighty figure could not help but take the lead and say.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Don’t worry. I said I won’t kill you, so I definitely won’t kill you.”

When everyone heard this, they finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“Everyone, follow me to the Heaven Gate first. I have something to discuss with everyone,”Qin Yu said.

After that, Qin Yu walked to ye Qing’s side.

“Commander Ye, Are You Alright?”Qin Yu asked.

Ye Qing shook his head and said, “It’s not a big problem.”

“En, then you should return to the Heaven Gate first. I will treat your injuries later,”Qin Yu said.

Ye Qing agreed and walked towards the Heaven Gate.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu took a step forward and walked all the way to the side of Tian Xuehong.

Tian Xuehong had yet to step into the martial saint realm. He had no chance of winning against the current Qin Yu.

The fist force that drifted over had severely injured him and he fell to the ground, unable to get up.

“Qin Yu... you bastard...”Tian Xuehong gnashed his teeth with a face full of hatred.

Qin Yu completely ignored Tian Xuehong. He squatted in front of Tian xuehong and asked directly, “Who is the person behind you?”

Tian Xuehong’s pupils suddenly constricted as he said coldly, “You Already Know?”

“It seems that what Chu Hedao said is true.”Qin Yu frowned.

“Speak. Who is the person who obtained the immortal slaying sect’s inheritance? If you tell me, I might be able to spare your life.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Heavenly Blood Rainbow, however, said with a vicious expression, “In your dreams! I will never tell you!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but grab the Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s hand. In the next second, he suddenly exerted force and instantly crushed the palm of the Heavenly Blood Rainbow!

The pain made Skyblood Hong break out in cold sweat.

“I have many methods of torturing people. Do you want to try?”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Skyblood Hong gritted his teeth and said, “I also want to tell you, but unfortunately, I don’t know his identity at all.”

“You don’t know his identity? Then how can you know that he has obtained the immortal slaying sect’s inheritance?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“That’s because I can sense the internal Qi of the members of the Massacre Immortal Sect...”heavenly blood rainbow said with sweat all over his head.

“Internal Qi? Then can you teach me?”Qin Yu touched his chin and said.

Heavenly Blood Rainbow shook his head and said, “I can’t teach you. Unless you also received the inheritance, you can only sense that unique internal Qi.”

“And let me tell you, the only people who received this inheritance are me and him! As long as I die, you will never find him!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Are you trying to use this to blackmail me and spare your life?”

“You want to go yourself!”The Sky Blood Rainbow sneered.

“I can only tell you that once the inheritor succeeds, no one will be able to stop him!”

“Everyone in the world thinks that our slaughterer immortal sect used a secret technique to absorb the divine sense of the Earth warriors. In fact, you’ve completely underestimated our slaughterer immortal sect!”

“Back then, our slaughtering immortal sect set up a formation in all the major galaxies in the universe! If it weren’t for that masked woman causing trouble, we would have been invincible long ago!”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “So, if that inheritor succeeds, he will once again set up a formation in all the major galaxies?”

“That’s right! He will definitely complete the unfinished great plan of our slaughtering immortal sect. At that time, I’ll see which of you can stop him!”Tian Xuehong laughed crazily.

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He lowered his head to look at Skyblood Rainbow on the ground and said, “You said so much just to let me spare your life, right?”

“Hahaha! You have no choice but to let me go! Otherwise, all the life star areas will face a disaster!”Skyblood rainbow laughed wantonly.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and then said in a low voice, “Back then, the masked woman was able to kill the peak of the slaughtering immortal sect. I think I can also kill that inheritor, even if he succeeds.”

Tian Xuehong’s expression suddenly changed, and he said in a trembling voice, “Qin Yu, you... you have to think clearly! With me around, you can completely kill him in the bud!”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “I love fighting with strong people the most in my life. Since you said that he is invincible after reaching the great success stage, I really want to see it.”

Tian Xuehong secretly felt that things were not good. He hurriedly said, “I can give you the secret technique of the Immortal Massacre sect! When that time comes, you can set up a formation and absorb their essence souls!”
