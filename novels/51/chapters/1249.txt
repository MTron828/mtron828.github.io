Chapter 1250: Chapter 1,250, Qin Yu’s talent test 

Zi He and the young men beside him all looked at Di Zun with serious expressions.

Di Zun, on the other hand, had an excited look on his face. He grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said, “Master, did you see that? 93! Do you think I’m Awesome?”

Qin Yu was also a little surprised.

He didn’t know how talented Di Zun was, but from the performance of the elders, this number seemed to be very high.

“Kid, don’t be happy too early. Maybe there’s a problem with the test god Stone. Let’s do it again,”zi he said coldly.

At this point, Zi he looked at the girl next to him and said, “Zi Ru, go and exchange for a test god Stone.”

“Okay.”The girl called Zi Ru nodded slightly.

She flipped her palm, and another test god stone appeared in her palm.

Zi Ru placed the testing stone on the table and looked at Di Zun. “You, do it again.”

Di Zun excitedly raised his palm and placed it on the testing stone.

Half a minute later, another number appeared on the testing stone.

The entire number was still 93 points.

This time, no one could remain calm.

Zi He, Zi Ru, and the other youths, as well as the elders, all walked forward.

“Ninety-three points. I didn’t expect there to be such a genius here!”An elder with graying sideburns suppressed his excitement and said.

Then, the elder looked at di zun and said, “Young man, What’s Your Name?”

“My name is Di Zun,”he said excitedly.

“Are you willing to follow us to the Holy Region?”The elder continued.

Di zun said excitedly, “Of course I’m willing. If not, why would I Come!”

“Hahahaha!”

The elder couldn’t help but stroke his beard and laugh.

He stared at di zun and said, “Di Zun, I’m in a great mood today. I want to make an exception and take you in as my last disciple. What do you think?”

“Elder Bai, you...”hearing this, Zi he was a little unhappy.

Elder Bai waved his hand and looked at Di Zun with a smile.

“Kid, elder Bai hasn’t accepted a disciple for a long time. Kneel down and acknowledge him as your master,”zi he said coldly.

Di Zun scratched his head and said awkwardly, “Elder Bai, I’m really sorry. I heard from my father that a person can only acknowledge one master in his lifetime. I. . . I already have a master.”

“Oh?”Elder Bai was slightly surprised.

“Kid, do you know who elder Bai Is? Don’t be so Shameless.”Zi he said with some displeasure.

Zi Ru also crossed her arms and snorted softly, “Is your master worthy to be mentioned on the same level as elder Bai?”

Elder Bai at the side waved his hand and said, “Di Zun, who is your master? I’ll negotiate with him.”

“I’m his Master.”Qin Yu took a step forward and cupped his hands.

Seeing Qin Yu, Zi he couldn’t help but Snort coldly.

“Are you that Qin Yu Who’s called the number one person in the world?”Zi he said coldly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “That’s just an empty title.”

Zi Ru sneered and said, “Are you qualified to be someone else’s master? I advise you to be sensible and take the initiative to leave Di Zun.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He disliked being threatened the most.

“Di Zun is an independent person. He has his own choice. If he is willing to take elder Bai as his master, I will not stop him.”After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu said faintly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Di Zun glanced at elder Bai, cupped his hands and said, “Elder Bai, I can’t do such a thing. This... I will forget about the last disciple.”

“Kid, you really don’t know how to appreciate favors!”Zi he immediately scolded.

Elder Bai waved his hand and said, “No worries, no worries. Since this Qin Yu is known as the number one person in the world, his talent must be not low. If it’s suitable, the two of you can cultivate together with me.”

Hearing that, Di Zun was immediately overjoyed.

He hurriedly looked at Qin Yu and said, “Master, with your talent, there’s absolutely no problem!”

Qin Yu nodded slightly, but he wasn’t in a hurry because the next person to take the test was Zhen Yue.

“What’s the full score of this test God Stone?”Di Zun asked excitedly.

Zi Ru said indifferently, “It’s a hundred points system.”

“So you’re saying that I almost got a full score?”Di Zun said excitedly.

“That’s right. Your talent is indeed rare,”elder Bai said with a smile.

Di Zun looked at Qin Yu excitedly and said with a chuckle, “With my master’s talent, he should be able to exceed the full score and directly destroy this god testing stone!”

“Humph, keep bragging,”zi he said with a cold snort.

Qin Yu didn’t argue with them. As for how many points he could get, no one knew.

Next was Zhen Yue. She walked up to them and raised her hand to put it on the god testing stone.

Unfortunately, Zhen Yue wasn’t so lucky.

Her final score was only 51 points, which wasn’t up to the standard.

Seeing this result, Zhen Yue couldn’t help but sigh, and a trace of regret flashed across her face.

Although she didn’t have much hope for herself, this result still made her a little sad.

“51 points is considered pretty good among the trash,”zi he said lightly.

Zhen Yue, who was already in a bad mood, looked even worse when she heard this.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown as well.

This guy really stinks when he talks.

“Come on, the number one person in the world. It’s your turn,”Zi Ru looked at Qin Yu and said with a faint smile.

Many people gathered around as if they wanted to see how much Qin Yu’s talent could be measured.

Qin Yu walked in front of the god testing stone.

He slowly raised his hand and placed it on the god testing stone.

Rays of light lit up and entered Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu only felt a trace of strangeness in his body, as if something was swimming all over his body.
