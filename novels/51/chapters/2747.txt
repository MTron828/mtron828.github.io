The strange thing was that half of the huge diamond-shaped Heart of Saint Kingdom was deeply embedded in the space.

It was like an old tree root buried deep under a tree. Its roots pierced deep into space.

Boundless!

In an instant, a violent tremor came from the void.

Dense energy tendrils gathered towards the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom. An intense light released from it enveloped Gu Ying.

He was like a god, and an inhuman power erupted from his palm.

The next moment, the damage was completely transferred.

However, he still felt his internal organs twist violently. The Boundless holy energy was too powerful, and even the Night Qi could not completely divert the damage.

“It’s the Soul Suppression Ring. You are the one who set up the Endless Mine, right?

Gu Ying’s face revealed an expression of ‘I knew it’. “Your Boundless can restrain the Book of Wishes?”

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn.

They had sworn an oath before, but Gu Ying could still attack him.

Qin Yu couldn’t think of anything else other than this nine-in-one Heart of Saint Kingdom.

Boom!

Gu Ying ignored Qin Yu’s question.

He punched Qin Yu again. A whistling sound instantly exploded in the air.

vast Qi of Milky way!

Qin Yu suddenly unlocked the power of the Milky Way Holy Body.

He caught the punch with his palm with the silver holy energy. The terrifying power pushed him away. Then, he was sent flying heavily against the wall of the Heavenly Sin divine hall.

Hah!

Gu Ying roared and opened his palm towards the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom on his back.

Then, his huge Heart of Saint Kingdom slowly shrank and sank into his forehead.

Meanwhile, countless violent energies in the Saint Kingdom seemed to be summoned.

All the power broke through the void and suddenly entered the fist qi. The energy instantly became ten times stronger and pierced through Qin Yu’s body.

Boom!

Nine Heavens Holy Sword!

Qin Yu suddenly opened his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze. The destructive power stored in his pupils transformed into a golden holy sword and directly exploded the fist qi in front.

Qin Yu panted slightly. His body had just been penetrated.

He didn’t use the power of the Dao of Dreams because he sensed a powerful force that seemed to isolate his Night Qi.

Therefore, he did not dare to take the risk to use it. The consequences would be unimaginable if he failed to use the Night Qi.

The space in front of him squirmed like a living thing. Countless space blades that emitted a cold light slowly formed.

Gu Ying surrounded Qin Yu within a 360-degree radius, and his body appeared above Qin Yu.

“I’ll give you a chance. Leave the ring on your right hand and I’ll let you go.” “Your goal is the Soul Suppressing Ring from the beginning, isn’t it?” Qin Yu said with narrowed eyes.

He had felt that this person from the Guardian of Order had been paying special attention to him.

Moreover, he had not been anxious at all when the Formation Master encountered difficulties in breaking the formation. It turned out that his goal was not the Tomb of Heavenly Sins, but the Soul Suppression Ring in his hand.

“The things in the Tomb of Heavenly Sins are too abstract, but the coordinate ring of the Nineteenth Prison is a ready-made power. This power can only be in my hands.”

Gu Ying clenched his fist and the space blade pierced through space.

It completely pierced through the place where Qin Yu was.

What a fast speed and terrifying physical strength!

Gu Ying was shocked.

The speed that Qin Yu had unleashed in that instant earlier had squeezed out a path of survival as if he had teleported.

The Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom, the ruler.

Gu Ying’s forehead emitted a brilliant light. As the diamond-shaped light refracted, his body seemed to have a hazy feeling.

His body floated and the air formed a staircase under his feet.

The breeze around Qin Yu gently stirred. In the next moment, it had already formed a tornado that could cut through space.

The terrifying hurricane tore Qin Yu’s body. Even the Milky Way Holy Body was cut and bled.

Ice and snow fell from the sky. The ice and tornado intertwined.

It instantly transformed into terrifying strength. Qin Yu continuously dodged a portion of the fatal attacks.

However, how could he completely dodge the combination of snow and tornadoes?

A pitch-black power filled Qin Yu’s pupil.

Then, it covered half of his body. As long as the Night Qi was there, he was not afraid. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although the Might of Heaven and Earth was powerful, it was far inferior to God’s Space of the holy daughter.

“Qin Yu, nothing can escape my perception in my ruling country. The power of the Soul Suppression Ring and the Dao of Dreams can send you to another space. The same is true for damage transfer. You need to enter the Nineteenth Prison to transfer the damage. What about this?”

Gu Ying’s expression was indifferent.

“Ruler, seal it!”

A terrifying power exploded from the Heart of Saint Kingdom on his forehead.

The black energy in Qin Yu’s eyes slowly faded and the injuries on his body exploded. He could not transfer into the dream realm.

An extremely powerful force sealed the entire space.

He could not enter the passageway even if he placed his thumb on the Soul Suppression Ring.

“You won’t be able to escape this way. We’ve wasted too much time here. It’s time to end this.”

Gu Ying clapped his hands together.

The ground under Qin Yu’s feet suddenly cracked open and he fell.

A terrifying gravity pulled his body down rapidly from the bottomless abyss.

This was not an illusion, but something that was happening.

Under the control of Gu Ying’s Ruler’s Power, the ground cracked open and gravity exploded.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body almost turned into an afterimage.

Under the bottomless abyss, a terrifying flame came from the depths.

An earth dragon roared from a bottomless abyss. This extremely deep magma had already developed intelligence at this moment.

Seeing the presence of the Holy Consciousness’s internal qi, it immediately roared angrily.

The flames instantly enveloped Qin Yu and his skin was visibly charred black.

Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze!

A golden holy sword lit up and attacked Gu Ying in the air.

“Is he struggling on his deathbed?”

A smile appeared on Gu Ying’s face.

The Nine Heavens Holy Sword was moving in slow motion, so it couldn’t hit him.

However, a look of disbelief appeared in his eyes in the next moment.

“Heavenly Devil? How is this possible? Are you an otherworldly Heavenly Devil? Isn’t the Heavenly Devil forbidden from entering the three realms? Why are you here?”

Gu Ying roared madly.

When the Nine Heavens Holy Sword approached him, a voice came from behind him.

My name is Hell…

Gu Ying saw a black figure standing behind him when the Nine Heavens Holy Sword pierced him.

His Ruler’s Power didn’t detect this figure at all..
