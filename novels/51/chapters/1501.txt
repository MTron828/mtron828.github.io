Chapter 1502: Chapter 1502, another battle with the eighteen gods 1 

Di Zun panicked and stood there, explaining non-stop.

Seeing this, the first elder behind him could not help but laugh out loud, “Di Zun, your mission has been completed. Come back! Qin Yu will soon become a corpse. There’s no need to care about his feelings!”

Di Zun’s expression was extremely ugly. He glared angrily at the first elder and berated, “First Elder, you actually used me!”

Following that, Di Zun hurriedly looked at Qin Yu and said, “Master, I didn’t know at all. I also didn’t know that the first Elder was lying to me!”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said indifferently, “Of course I believe you. You were deceived by the old fox, First Elder.”

Di Zun pulled Qin Yu’s arm and said, “You... you quickly escape! I’ll go with you!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Run? Since I dare to come, I’m naturally not afraid of him!”

“Master, those are the eighteen gods, you...”

“It doesn’t matter. So what if they are the eighteen gods? Last time, I could destroy one of them. This time, I can destroy all of them,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing that, the first elder could not help but laugh out loud, “Arrogant words! Qin Yu, you will pay the price for your arrogance and ignorance!”

Qin Yu pushed Di Zun to the side, and then looked at the first elder coldly, saying, “Old dog, today I will make sure you never come back!”

After saying this, the internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body instantly exploded! The earth instantly stirred up dust! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

......

Feeling the internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body, the first elder’s face could not help but slightly change, and his heart was extremely shocked.

In just a few days, why did Qin Yu’s strength increase so much? But it seemed like he was only in the nascent soul realm!

I have to get rid of this kid! First Elder thought to himself.

At this moment, first elder couldn’t help but feel regretful. He knew that Qin Yu had some talent, but he didn’t expect him to be so abnormal!

If he hadn’t killed Zhen Yue back then, he might have had a chance to negotiate, but it was obviously impossible now.

At this moment, the eighteen gods walked over and surrounded Qin Yu.

As usual, they couldn’t feel any internal Qi fluctuations from their bodies. They were as calm as an ancient well.

Qin Yu looked at the eighteen gods coldly, then looked at the first elder and said, “Old Dog, why are you still standing there and waiting to die?”

The first elder said with a cold face, “Don’t worry. The eighteen gods will get rid of you.”

As they spoke, the eighteen gods had already moved.

They raised their palms, and several rays of light condensed. In an instant, the weather changed, and the sky turned dark.

The Earth of Yin Palace collapsed at this moment, and countless cracks appeared. A mysterious light emitted from the void, indicating how terrifying this spell was.

A terrifying internal Qi pressure was like a heat wave, spreading out in all directions. Just this aura alone made people shudder.

Countless rays of light gathered on the palm of one person. The eighteen godly men in the lead held the rays of light in their hands, their faces as cold as ice.

In the next second, they pushed their palms forward. In an instant, the terrifying internal Qi pressed down on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked coldly at the disc-like rays of light, and his body emitted rays of golden light.

He clenched his right fist, revealing his blue veins. In the face of the light that was pressing down on him, he did not show the slightest bit of panic.

Just as the disc approached, Qin Yu roared, and his right fist arrived with a bang!

The golden light seemed to explode at this moment, appearing in the horizon!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, the heaven and earth collapsed, and the Earth collapsed! Under Qin Yu’s Golden Fist, that light actually shattered instantly, turning into nothingness!

The huge explosion shattered the void, and like a piece of glass, it fell down, revealing a large area of pitch-black!

Qin Yu’s long hair danced in the wind, and his battle intent was overflowing! Under the Golden Light, he was like an undefeatable war god!

“This technique is useless against me, so don’t waste your time,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, he looked at the eighteen gods and said, “You can try activating the Rashomon sect again, and see if I can kill all of you.”

The eighteen celestials’expression was terrifyingly calm, as if they were emotionless robots.

Qin Yu’s entire body was emitting an undefeatable radiance. His ice-cold eyes stared directly at the first elder who was not far away.

The first Elder’s face was as dark as water. He wanted to get rid of Qin Yu even more urgently.

Even he might not be able to escape unscathed from the spell just now! But this Qin Yu was actually unharmed!

A nascent soul stage cultivator already had such terrifying battle prowess. If he were to grow up, how terrifying would that be?

“I must die, I Must Die!”First Elder roared madly in his heart.

Following that, first elder looked at the eighteen gods and shouted, “Use the fastest time to kill him!”

The eighteen gods seemed to have received an order, and the eighteen figures immediately surged towards the same direction.

Soon after, the eighteen gods’bodies began to turn illusory, and then they continued to overlap.

After a moment, the eighteen of them actually merged into one!

The eighteen turned into one, and their battle prowess also increased exponentially!

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. When he sensed the internal Qi on their bodies, he could not help but feel shocked!

Such surging internal Qi was almost no weaker than Jue Wu, Qu Zhu, and the others!

“Eighteen gods turned into one. Even the sect master would not dare to ignore eighteen gods in such a State!”First Elder said coldly.

“Qin Yu, your luck has come to an end!”

Qin Yu looked at the eighteen gods in front of him and felt even more shocked. However, he was not afraid at all. Instead, he was looking forward to it!

“With such combat strength, it is not comparable to Jue Wu, but it is not too far off. I would like to give it a try...”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and muttered in a low voice.

“Kill him immediately!”First Elder shouted angrily.

After the eighteen gods received the order, they instantly shot toward Qin Yu!

In the blink of an eye, he had already arrived in front of him!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly stepped on the line word formula and shot backward.

“What speed!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

It seemed that the combat strength of the eighteen gods after merging was not just a little bit higher.

“I still underestimated him...”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

After saying that, Qin Yu didn’t dare to hide his strength anymore. He directly opened the fifth level of the fighting word formula!

With the support of the fifth level of the fighting word formula, Qin Yu’s battle strength also doubled! A powerful internal Qi kept surging out of his body like an endless river!

First Elder’s heart suddenly trembled, and his face became more and more unsightly.

“This kid...”first elder clenched his teeth!

This internal Qi was probably above his!

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, the eighteen gods appeared in front of Qin Yu once again.

His moves were no longer fancy, but a huge hand slapped toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu naturally did not dare to be negligent. His internal Qi surged, and his golden hair danced wildly. He raised his hand and met the incoming ten thousand spell breaking punch!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, Qin Yu felt a huge force pouring over, as if he had been hit by a meteorite!

“Whoosh!”

In the next second, Qin Yu was directly sent flying.
