Chapter 1508: Chapter 1,508, the plot of the northern lands

Qin Yu instinctively paused when he heard Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s voice.

After so long, he had already forgotten about heavenly blood rainbow. He didn’t think that he was still alive.

“What do you mean?”Qin Yu asked with divine sense.

Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s voice was a little weak. He slowly said, “This aura... must have been inherited by the immortal slaying sect...”

As soon as he said this, Qin Yu immediately felt a chill down his spine!

If his guess wasn’t wrong, this group of people should have come from the northern lands.

Could it be that the northern lands had obtained the immortal slaying sect’s internal Qi to be able to develop to this day?

If that was really the case, then it would definitely be an extremely terrifying matter!

The immortal slaying sect was definitely not something that the sects of the southern region could compare to. Their internal Qi was extremely terrifying.

What Qin Yu knew was only the tip of the iceberg!

Even the heavenly blood rainbow only got a small part of it!

“How did they get the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect...”qin yu murmured, “Did the people of the immortal slaying sect reach the holy region back then?”

“It’s nothing strange... When the immortal slaying sect was at its peak, nothing could stop them. Since the holy region was so prosperous, they naturally came...”heavenly blood rainbow said slowly.

......

As he spoke, there was a faint sense of pride in his voice, as if he was recalling the peak of the immortal slaying sect.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Could it be that the person behind you gave the Northern Land’s legacy?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Heavenly Blood Rainbow was not the true successor, and the successor behind him was even more terrifying.

However, his identity was extremely mysterious, and he had not even seen heavenly blood rainbow before. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I don’t know...”the heavenly blood rainbow said in a low voice.

Qin Yu was silent. He hurried towards his destination.

The few black-robed men had already been surrounded by the GU city army. However, they were not worth mentioning in front of the black-robed men. In fact, they did not even have the strength to fight back.

The many generals of Gu City were beaten until they vomited blood. Some of them even had their divine sense absorbed on the spot and fell to the ground.

For a moment, the scene was too horrible to look at. Many of Gu City’s soldiers even turned around and ran.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu was even more certain that the inheritance of the northern lands was definitely related to the immortal slaying sect!

Could it be... the person behind the Heavenly Blood Rainbow is he teng? Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, he didn’t continue to think about it. Now wasn’t the time to think about this.

Qin Yu looked coldly at the black-robed man in front of him and said coldly, “I didn’t expect that the people of the northern lands have already entered Gu City.”

The black-robed man looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Not only gu city, but the entire southern province has our people everywhere.”

“As long as we give the order, it is enough to destroy the entire southern province!”

Just as Qin Yu was about to speak, the city Lord of Gu City arrived in a carriage.

He stood high in the sky and looked at the bloody scene. His expression became more and more unsightly.

“Who are you people? How Dare You Touch My People!”The city Lord of Gu City shouted!

The few black-robed men below all raised their heads and looked at the city Lord of Gu City.

“You are the city Lord? Then I’ll kill you first.”

A black-robed man said this and immediately stretched out his palm towards the carriage!

As the castellan of Gu City, he naturally had some ability.

Facing this huge palm, the castellan did not panic. He silently chanted a spell and a sharp blade immediately flew out from between his brows!

The castellan held the sharp blade in his hand and directly slashed towards the palm that was swinging towards him!

“Swish!”

With a slash of the sword, the palm was instantly cut into two!

“You must pay the price for what you have done!”The castellan coldly said.

The black-robed man said gloomily, “As expected of the city Lord of Gu City. He has some ability, but unfortunately... he has stopped here.”

Before he finished speaking, several black-robed men attacked at the same time, charging straight at the city Lord of Gu City.

For a moment, the sky was filled with killing intent, and the light was like fireworks, scattering all over Gu City.

Countless people of Gu City raised their heads to look at this scene, and they couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

“It’s the city Lord! The city Lord is personally fighting for us!”

Many ordinary people also ignited their fighting spirit and rushed towards this place.

Unfortunately, this was a cultivation world. Without strength, no matter how many people there were, it was useless.

“Everyone, don’t come any closer,”qin yu shouted loudly. “Don’t come forward and throw your lives away!”

After saying this, Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the sky.

The city lord was obviously unable to deal with these black-robed men.

The sharp blade in his hand had almost curled up, and his chest had been hit hard by a palm. He staggered back countless steps, and a mouthful of blood flowed down from the corner of his mouth.

“City Lord of Gu City, today I’m going to use my actions to tell the Heavenly Cloud sect not to interfere in the matters of the northern lands. Otherwise, the entire southern region will be implicated!”One of the black-robed men reprimanded coldly.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly, instantly understanding the intentions of the northern lands.

This was more like they wanted to shift the conflict onto the heavenly cloud sect, and then use the other party to kill them...

The Heavenly Cloud Sect’s suffering was not bad news for Qin Yu.

“I can sit back and reap the benefits,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Now that the supreme intent had made a move against the heavenly cloud sect, the northern lands had also pointed the spearhead at the Heavenly Cloud sect. The Heavenly Cloud sect had suffered a pincer attack from both sides, and it was hard to say who would win or lose.

If Qin Yu joined in, the chances of the Heavenly Cloud sect winning would probably be even smaller.

“Alright, it’s time for you to die.”

In mid-air, the black-robed man suddenly raised his palm, and a pitch-black radiance gathered in his palm.

In the next second, the black-robed man roared, and his palm slammed fiercely towards the city lord’s chest!

At this moment, a golden light streaked across the sky, instantly arriving in front of the city Lord who was holding it up!

The Golden Fist was incomparable as it met the pitch-black light.

“Boom!”

After a huge explosion, the black-robed person staggered back countless steps! Half of his palm was directly broken!

“Qin Yu, you...”seeing Qin Yu who attacked, the city lord could not help but be a little shocked.

Qin Yu ignored him and only looked coldly at the few black-robed people in front of him.

The black-robed man’s expression changed and he berated coldly, “Brat, you are Qin Yu? !”

“That’s right,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The black-robed man narrowed his eyes and berated loudly, “This matter has nothing to do with you. You had better not interfere! Moreover, we are targeting the heavenly cloud sect. You should be thanking us!”

Qin Yu could not help but laugh out loud when he heard that and said, “If you are targeting the heavenly cloud sect, then go to their sect! Why are you targeting these ordinary people? Are you bullying the weak and afraid of the strong?”

“The sect of the Tianyun sect is standing there. You can go at any time.”

The black-robed man’s face turned black as he coldly said, “This has nothing to do with you. You’d better mind your own business!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “I think you want to use this method to force the Tianyun sect to cooperate with you, right?”

“At that time, won’t you all be wearing the same pants? In the end, the ones who will benefit are you, and the ones who will suffer are these ordinary people!”
