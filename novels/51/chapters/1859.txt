1860 Meeting Tong Haoyang Head-On

When he came to Thunder Courtyard, he knew nothing about Qin Yu except he was at Demon-slaying Peak.

But now, when he recalled Qin Yu’s combat style, he could not help but think of someone.

That person was none other than Si Shiyue.

Back then, Tong Haoyang had seen Si Shiyue in action by chance. Now that he thought about it, it was very similar to Qin Yu.

The two’s moves were incomparably overbearing, grand in scale, and destructive.

“Chaotic body… I didn’t expect Qin Yu to have a chaotic body.” Not only was Tong Haoyang not panicking, but he was looking forward to it.

“I can’t defeat Si Shiyue, but I can kill you.” Tong Haoyang sneered.

He was looking even more forward to it. It would be something to brag about if he could kill a chaotic body.

The following day, Qin Yu arrived at the Martial Arts Hall early in the morning.

The Martial Arts Hall of Demon-slaying Peak was exceptionally unique. Rumor had it that the Dean had personally set it up.

It was a Mystic Realm that was constructed in the void. Although it was not comparable to real space, its stability was beyond imagination.

For many years, the Martial Arts Hall had experienced countless battles, big and small. However, it remained intact, which was sufficient to prove how terrifying the Martial Arts Hall was.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang were standing near the Martial Arts Hall.

“Do we kill him together later?” Chang Mang asked in a low voice.

“No need,” Qin Yu said coldly. “I can kill him by myself”.

“Mmm,” Chang mang responded. “If you need my help, just let me know. I don’t care about the stupid rules. At most, we’ll just leave this place.”

As they were talking, Xiaobai walked over from not far away.

He stood beside Qin Yu and said with emotion, “After you made your moves yesterday, you’ve changed the majority’s impression of you. Even now, I suspect your so-called damaged primordial spirit is fake.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly but did not explain.

He then looked at Xiaobai and said, “How is Cao Huang now?”

“I can only say that he’s quite seriously injured. I’m afraid he won’t be able to come today,” Xiaobai said.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to say something when he saw Cao Huang arrive at the entrance of the Martial Arts Hall, supported by Jiu Xiao.

He walked to Qin Yu with great difficulty and said weakly, “Qin Yu, you must… kill this d*mned thing!”

Qin Yu patted Cao Huang’s shoulder and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll take revenge for you.”

Qin Yu then nodded to Jiu Xiao.

Jiu Xiao glanced at Qin Yu and did not say anything.

At this point, Jiu Xiao knew that he might not be Qin Yu’s opponent if they fought.

The people of Demon-slaying Peak gradually gathered.

Their attitude toward Qin Yu had obviously changed tremendously. It was a place where strength was highly respected. As long as one was strong enough, one would be respected.

The crowd chatted casually with Qin Yu, intentionally or otherwise, and cheered for him.

Soon, Tong Haoyang also arrived at the venue.

The moment they saw Tong Haoyang, the atmosphere turned somewhat strange.

A strong killing intent burst out from many people. This killing intent caused the surrounding temperature to drop suddenly. In an instant, it became bone-chilling.

However, Tong Haoyang ignored them. He walked through the crowd and came in front of Qin Yu.

He looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, I’ve seen through your secret.”

“What an idiot,” Chang Mang, standing by the side, cursed.

“You’ve even seen through his secret. Didn’t you go home and see what color your mother’s underpants are?” Chang Mang cursed without mercy.

No matter how good Tong Haoyang’s temper was, his expression was slightly displeased when he heard Chang mang’s words.

He pointed at Chang Mang and said, “After I kill Qin Yu, you’ll be next.”

“Try pointing again and see,” Chang Mang immediately took a step forward, looking like he was about to attack.

Qin Yu stopped Chang Mang, signaling him not to be rash.

Chang Mang snorted coldly. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, slap his mouth later. Smash his mouth first.”

“Alright,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

The atmosphere was tense and critical as if a fight would break out at any time.

However, Qin Yu didn’t want to cause any trouble for the peak master. Thus he didn’t say anything else.

Time passed by, and soon it was noon.

The peak master finally showed up. He walked with a majestic gait to the vicinity of the Martial Arts Hall.

After that, the peak master gave Tong Haoyang a meaningful look and said, “You’re responsible for your own life and death,”

“You should say this to him,” Tong Haoyang said indifferently.

The peak master didn’t say anything else. He raised his palm, and after performing a series of secret techniques, the entrance to the Mystic Realm appeared in front of him.

Everyone followed the peak master and stepped into the Martial Arts Hall.

“Let’s go,” Qin Yu glanced at Chang Mang and said. They then entered the Martial Arts Hall together.

The Martial Arts Hall was different from what he had imagined. There was nothing inside at all as if he had entered a blank space.

Qin Yu glanced around and didn’t find any traces of fighting in the surroundings.

...

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel somewhat surprised. The Martial Arts Hall had been established for many years and experienced countless fights. Normally, it should be scarred.

Chang Mang also had the same doubts. He raised his head to look at the sky and could not help but say in surprise, “What kind of magical artifact is that?”

Qin Yu looked up and saw that the sky was like covered by a piece of huge cloth, which was emitting a mysterious internal qi.

“Is it due to this magical artifact?” Qin Yu thought to herself.

He reached out his palm and suddenly blasted it to the side.

The blank space beside him instantly shattered, revealing a dark void.

At the same time, the sky emitted a mysterious light. As the light swept past, the shattered void was restored to its original state.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang could not help but feel shocked. There was actually such a magical artifact in this world? Wouldn’t that mean they could create another new space? A truly small world? Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“This place cannot withstand Holy Power. Thus no one is allowed to use Saint Weapon,” the peak master said coldly.

Qin Yu suddenly realized.

There was indeed a limit to the power of this magical artifact. Otherwise, Thunder Courtyard would have created a second Holy Region.

...

At this moment, Tong Haoyang had already arrived.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, this day next year will be your death anniversary!”

Qin Yu did not hesitate either. He stomped his feet lightly and arrived in front of Tong Haoyang.

Facing Tong Haoyang, Qin Yu’s killing intent could no longer be concealed. It instantly swept through the entire Martial Arts Hall.

“After I kill you, I’ll bring your corpse to the Tong family. It’ll be considered a gift to the Tong family,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing this, Tong Haoyang couldn’t help but sneer and say, “There’s only one possibility if you want to go to the Tong family. And that’s I kill you and bring your corpse to the Tong family.”

At this point, Tong Haoyang paused and then said indifferently, “Chaotic body? I’m very interested.”
