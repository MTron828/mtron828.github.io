Qin Yu’s body instantly tensed up, but he immediately reacted. If Meng Jing wanted to kill him, he wouldn’t have the chance to run.

“The life I owe you has been repaid.”

Meng Jing said softly.

At this moment, her state was a little strange as if she was a little upset.

The internal qi on her body was not as strong as before. “Is there a problem with the Saint Kingdom?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and made a rough judgment.

Meng Jing was born in response to the fate of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. In other words, her fate was tied to the kingdom.

If the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom was strong, then she would naturally be stronger.

If something happened to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, she would also be affected.

“Recently, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Heart of Saint Kingdom have been transferred. Now, the Saint Kingdom’s power has weakened and many people have begun to invade.” Meng Jing said softly.

Qin Yu gasped.

The main reason why the ancient demon, Wu Tian, escaped during the battle in the Demon Sealing Valley was that the power of one of the Hearts of Saint Kingdom had been transferred to the Zi Yang Saint Kingdom.

That was why the order was in disorder. The loss of the second Heart of Saint Kingdom caused the Buddha to set up the Nineteenth Prison Attraction Formation.

They slaughtered nearly 100,000 people.

Four Hearts of Saint Kingdom were lost in a row this time. One could tell what kind of turmoil would occur in the core. It was no wonder that there was something wrong with Meng Jing.

“The Holy Lord has fallen, so chaos is inevitable. However, the person who stole the power of Saint Kingdom is a little terrifying. We need to stop him as soon as possible.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Once might be a coincidence, but not for six times.

The Heart of the Saint Kingdom was something that everyone had their eyes on. To be able to steal this power six times meant that this person’s strength and plans were already the top of this Saint Kingdom.

Moreover, the thing that Qin Yu found the most terrifying was the coincidence in the Endless Mine.

If the Buddha had allied with the person who stole Saint Power, it meant that the power behind this person was terrifying.

Thinking of this, he felt a little uneasy.

“I will personally chase after this person. Before that, you can ask me if you have any questions. This is the first time I owe someone a favor.”

Meng Jing said seriously.

“Do you recognize this ring?”

Qin Yu did not waste any time. He indeed still had many questions that needed to be resolved.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“This is the Nineteenth Prison’s Soul Suppression Ring. You must have gotten it from the Buddha. This is the coordinate to reach the Nineteenth Prison. There are three of these rings in the entire universe. You know what this means.”

Meng Jing said softly. This information shocked Qin Yu so much that he almost could not withstand it.

Of course, he knew what it meant. It meant that even the Holy Lord would be jealous of this item.

Even the high and mighty Gods would have bad thoughts if they knew this item was in the hands of an ant-like character.

“The Soul Suppression Ring’s power attribute driven by the Dao of Dreams is extremely high. It even far surpasses the power of the Eight Trigrams you cultivate. Even if you encounter a Holy Lord, they won’t be able to stop you as long as you activate this power in time.”

Meng Jing spoke coldly again as if she had seen through Qin Yu’s worry.

“Then how do I cultivate the power of the Dao of Dreams?”

Qin Yu asked again.

His current limit was the fist-sized Night Qi.

He could use the power of dream conversion, step into the passageway, or even enter the real Nineteenth Prison through the passageway.

Everything depended on this power but he did not know how to continue cultivating it.

“The power of the Dao of Dreams can only be cultivated by chance. I’ve seen one in the Demon Sealing Valley before, but I don’t know how he cultivated it. However, your power is similar to Xin Yue’s, so it should be at the elementary level of the power of dreams. You’re luckier than him because you have a Nineteenth Prison’s Soul Suppression Ring. Otherwise, you might have been dead by now.”

Meng Jing answered again.

Qin Yu nodded with a bitter smile. Although her words were harsh, they were the truth.

“Then what is my current strength? How can I improve in this Saint Kingdom?” Qin Yu was curious.

He had not encountered a complete systematic system since he came here. He also wanted to understand it.

“In the Saint Realm, the weakest person after being baptized by the Saint Power is at the pseudo-Saint Level. there were five realms at the Saint Level: Confused Consciousness, Human, True Consciousness, Dao Consciousness, and Holy Consciousness. You should be at level 9 of Dao Consciousness now, but your strength is strange. You’ve cultivated the Dao of Dreams and have the Nineteenth Prison Soul Suppression Ring. Even I can’t keep you here, so I don’t know which combat strength you can fight with.”

“Then what other realms are there above Dao Realm level 9?”

“The limit is the 15th level. You need to know that above the 9th level, you will awaken a secret technique based on the Saint Kingdom. This secret technique is called the ‘peak’. This power is the strongest power hidden in the body and the largest level of the Dao Realm. Some terrifying powers can even threaten the Holy Lord. Level 10 to level 15 are divided according to the ‘peak’ you have comprehended. There are a few experts at the 15th level in this Saint Kingdom. Even I am afraid of them.”

“Then how do I cultivate the ‘peak’?”

Qin Yu gasped hearing about the different levels of power.

Moreover, it was a killing move obtained by unsealing the body’s power. Qin Yu had an extreme desire when he heard it.

“Peak is somewhat similar to the power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom, but this is only power at the entry-level. This power is the greatest technique comprehended based on the Saint Kingdom. Therefore, outsiders cannot comprehend the peak unless they assimilate into the natives.”

Meng Jing said with a frown.

“Of course, this isn’t absolute. However, it is thousands of times more difficult. In such a long time, I’ve never seen an outsider who hasn’t assimilated comprehend the power of the peak. However, outsiders also have another method: to collect nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom and fuse them to form a brand new Heart of Saint Kingdom. Later on, it will give rise to even more powerful techniques. This kind of power is probably at the peak of level 11 or even level

12.”

Meng Jing explained in detail.

Qin Yu looked at the three Hearts of Saint Kingdom in his body: The Seal of Heaven Returning, the Order of Vessel, and the Divine Shield.

It was indeed as Meng Jing had said. After entering the core region, he had never used this power.

When the Endless Mine was bombarded by the power of Kun Peng, the Seal of Heaven Returning’s power was completely suppressed and could not be activated.

“It looks like I have to speed up the collection of the Heart of Saint Kingdom!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Among the four people in the Guardian of Order, almost all of them have more than nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom. One of them has already collected fifteen and will soon be able to fuse with a new Heart of Saint Kingdom. At that time, a new technique will be born.”

Meng Jing told Qin Yu everything she knew..
