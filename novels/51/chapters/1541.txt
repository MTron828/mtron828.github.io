Chapter 1542: Chapter 1,542, the death of the first elder

The moment the first elder, who had already lost the hearts of the people, took out the heaven origin bell, he immediately aroused the hatred of everyone.

The Heaven Origin Bell was originally a magical artifact used to protect the sect, but now, it was secretly put away by the first elder!

Most importantly, even when the Heavenly Cloud sect was in danger, he still refused to take out the heaven origin bell because of his own selfishness!

“First Elder’s actions are indeed too selfish,”someone in the crowd said coldly.

A stone stirred up a thousand waves, and everyone began to blame First Elder.

“First elder has indeed gone too far. Could it be that the life and death of the Heavenly Cloud sect can’t be compared to his personal interests?”

“This heaven origin bell was originally the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s possession, yet he hid it. How could such a person be qualified to represent the Heavenly Cloud sect! ?”

“Sect master has really misjudged the person. He actually allowed such an old thief to represent the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”

Hearing the curses of the people around him, Qin Yu could not help but smile.

As for the first elder who was lying on the ground, his expression became even uglier. His expression was extremely complicated. There was panic and anger, but most of it was fear and unwillingness.

“Enough! All of you, shut up!”The first elder was so embarrassed that he turned into anger as he roared crazily.

However, at this moment, the first elder had already lost his heart. How could anyone still listen to him?

Under everyone’s abuse, the first elder suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. Following that, his face turned even paler!

......

“It’s all your fault, it’s all your fault... Qin Yu, all of this started because of you!”The first Elder’s eyes were bloodshot as he stared at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked at first elder coldly and said, “You brought this upon yourself. The internal Qi in your hand can not save you. Instead, it will push you into the Abyss and make you stink for ten thousand years.”

“You’re talking nonsense... you’re talking nonsense! I’m going to kill you! !”

Following First Elder’s furious roar, he grabbed the internal Qi in his hand.

In an instant, the internal Qi emitted rays of extremely mysterious light. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This light carried an aged internal Qi as it drifted towards Qin Yu.

In an instant, everyone seemed to have sensed the intense internal qi emitted from the internal Qi Bell. Everyone could not help but scatter in all directions, except for Qin Yu, whose expression was as calm as ever.

Looking at the internal Qi that drifted over, Qin Yu could only feel the return to void Qi on it. Other than that, there was nothing special about it. It was even inferior to the Silver Spring in Zhuo Jing’s hand.

The aura of internal Qi arrived, as if it wanted to Smash Qin Yu into pieces.

The seemingly illusory light, when it approached, erupted with an extremely powerful and terrifying power!

However, Qin Yu’s expression was extremely calm. Facing this burst of light, he slowly raised his hand, and golden light instantly appeared!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s hand seemed to be plated with gold. It was extremely dazzling, making it almost impossible to see clearly!

“Pa!”

In the next second, Qin Yu gathered all his strength and slapped out!

The light emitted by the heaven origin bell was instantly scattered!

The first elder who was holding the Heaven Origin Bell suffered a backlash. He staggered back a few steps and spat out a mouthful of blood!

Qin Yu stepped on the line word formula and instantly appeared in front of the first elder.

Before he could react, Qin Yu had already snatched the heaven origin bell into his hands.

First Elder looked at the empty palm and was instantly stunned on the spot.

“You... I...”First Elder was extremely flustered and did not even know what to say!

Qin Yu sneered, “The Heaven origin bell is gone too, what else do you have to rely on? Is it Sima Bei who is far away in the northern lands? Or is it the sect master on the Cultivation Mountain?”

First Elder stared with his eyes wide open. Due to his fear, his entire body was trembling non-stop.

“Qin... Qin Yu, you... You let me off this time...”first elder said with a trembling voice.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You are the first elder of the Heavenly Cloud sect after all. Even if you die, you should die with some dignity, right?”

“I... I don’t want to die...”first elder said with a terrified expression.

“Please, don’t kill me. I. . . I will do anything for you in the future. As long as you spare my life...”

As he said this, the first elder actually knelt down!

Looking at the first elder in such a sorry state, everyone couldn’t help but sigh.

This first elder really didn’t have any backbone. As an existence above tens of thousands of people under one person in the Heavenly Cloud sect, he was actually so spineless now.

“Qin Yu, I beg you, please spare me...”tears flowed down First Elder’s face, and he looked a little pitiful.

However, Qin Yu was no longer that young kid who had just entered the jianghu. He was already used to this kind of scene, so he naturally didn’t feel the slightest bit of pity in his heart.

Seeing that Qin Yu still didn’t express his stance, first elder hurriedly looked at Di zun and said anxiously, “Di Zun, I can be considered as your master. You... quickly help me plead for mercy!”

Di Zun opened his mouth and was about to speak, but Qin Yu was one step ahead of him and said coldly, “I’ve said before, anyone who pleads for mercy will end up like him.”

Once these words were said, Di Zun could only obediently shut his mouth and retreat to the side.

“First Elder, be a wise person in your next life.”Qin Yu’s cold voice sounded.

The first elder’s expression changed drastically. He was about to speak, but Qin Yu’s fist was one step ahead of him.

With a bang, first elder’s head exploded and turned into a bloody mist.

His primordial spirit that wanted to escape was wiped out before it could escape.

First Elder’s tall body fell heavily to the ground, stirring up waves of dust.

Everyone present was silent.

Some people sighed slightly, while others were filled with emotions.

In this world, anyone could turn into a pile of yellow dirt at any time, no matter what position they were in.

The cruelty of the immortal cultivation world made everyone feel a bit of coldness.

“First elder died just like that. It’s really hard to imagine.”Someone Sighed.

“Yeah, back then, first elder was also a powerful figure. God knows how many people died in his hands. I didn’t think that he would end up like this.”

Other than sighing over first elder’s death, they were more impressed by Qin Yu’s strength.

He had easily killed the first elder when he had just advanced to the mighty realm. He had even reached the level of three madmen and three absolutes. How great would he be in the future?

It was likely that the entire South Province would be reshuffled.

After congratulating Qin Yu, they left one after another.

Qin Yu looked at the deputy sect master and said, “In the future, you should be the representative of the Tianyun sect.”

The deputy sect master’s resentment toward Qin Yu had also lessened quite a bit, so his tone had become much gentler.

“I’m afraid that my body will need to rest for a few days,”said the deputy sect master.

Qin Yu smiled. He didn’t say anything more, but looked at Di Zun.

“Di Zun, you should stay. Cultivating here is the best choice for you,”said Qin Yu.

Di Zun took a step forward and asked, “Master, What About You?”

Qin Yu glanced at the cultivation mountain and then looked to the north, and then said coldly, “I want to go to the northern border.”
