“The rules of the Demon Sealing Valley must be followed, as the sect master may still appear. After all, these are the rules set by the sect master,” Roger said with a smile. The people nearby chuckled at his words.

It had been many years since the sect master of the Demon Sealing Valley, Wu Ya, had appeared. There were many rumors within the sect.

There were even rumors of the sect master’s death. Gu Yi only dared to act against his will after there was no news of the sect master.

Roger clapped his hands, and a young man emerged from behind them.

His face was pale, and his body trembled slightly.

“Since we cannot intervene, the battles between outsiders are none of our concern,” Roger said with a smile, turning to the young man.

“Come, let’s spar with these fellow countrymen from the next generation. If you lose, you know the consequences.”

The young man let out a low roar and charged toward Qin Yu and the others like a wild beast.

Ling’er exclaimed and moved to intervene. However, Jing Xin stopped her, sighing softly.

“If we intervene, their fate may be even worse.”

Sword Drawing Stance!

The young man rushed in front of Aiden and crouched down like a swordsman drawing his sword.

As a sword light flashed, the Spiritual Energy Sword slashed out along with the drawn sword.

The Spiritual Energy Sword unexpectedly enveloped all the outsiders. This young man was indeed a genius swordsman! To be able to release such Spiritual Energy Sword!

Qin Yu shattered the Spiritual Energy Sword with a punch, and the residual force slammed into the young man’s sword.

Block!

The young man suddenly blocked with his sword, absorbing all the remaining force of the punch.

He stared at Qin Yu with an apologetic expression.

With a leap like a rabbit, he arrived in front of Qin Yu.

The movement of his sword changed. Gripping the hilt with both hands, he

emitted a magnificent and domineering aura similar to a saber.

“Scorching Slash!”

The sword fell toward Qin Yu’s head. The ground under Qin Yu’s feet emitted a charred smell. The heat wave on the sword even boiled the water vapor around

Qin Yu.

Swoosh!

Qin Yu suddenly drew his Tiger Wing and blocked his body.

Although the young man had comprehended “force”, it was obvious that he had been captured by the people from the Demon Sealing Valley. His Saint Power of the divine soul and physical strength were much weaker than Qin Yu’s.

Qin Yu took his full-powered attack with just his physical body.

With a flash, a saber was already placed on the young man’s neck.

“You lost,” Qin Yu said as he retracted his Tiger Wing. He didn’t want to kill the young man in front of him. From his terrified expression, he had likely suffered a lot of torture.

“Thank you…” The young man said with a complicated expression.

“Be careful!”

Suddenly, Jing Xin anxiously reminded him.

As soon as he finished speaking, the young man in front of him suddenly changed his appearance.

The clothes on his body suddenly burst open, and black curses that looked like hemp ropes emerged from his neck, chest, and abdomen.

These black curses seemed to be alive as they moved around his body.

In the blink of an eye, his body suddenly swelled up. The Saint Power in his body seemed to have exploded, and he directly self-destructed in front of Qin

Yu.

“It’s a Daoist talisman. It’s a way to control them,” Jing Xin said softly.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold all of a sudden. The huge impact of the explosion had also caused him to suffer some injuries.

However, at this moment, he was filled with anger. This Daoist of the Demon Sealing Valley was more like a demon.

“Don’t look at us like that. Back then, before the order in the Ancient Demon Land collapsed, we couldn’t attack the outsiders. How did these outsiders use the Demon Sealing Valley to kill so many of us? This can only be considered karma,” Roger said, not caring about Qin Yu’s murderous gaze.

“It’s still not too late for you to join Elder Gu Yi’s faction. As you can see, if you join Elder Gu Yi’s faction now, we will give you a chance to live. As long as you obey our orders, you will have no problem surviving and venturing deeper into the Saint Kingdom. However, if you still refuse to come to your senses, you will have to stay in the Demon Sealing Valley forever. After fighting for so long, no one has come out to stop you. If you’re not stupid, you should understand why, ” Roger continued.

The few outsiders hesitated. They had no way out of the Demon Sealing Valley.

It was indeed as Roger had said. If the people of the Demon Sealing Valley wanted to stop them, they should have been able to do so long ago.

The current situation had already shown that Elder Gu Yi’s faction held the upper hand. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Elder Xin Yue’s faction was only relying on the sect master’s authority to intimidate them. As long as they kept looking for loopholes, it would be difficult for outsiders like them to survive.

“Are you done with your nonsense? If you’re done, don’t block the way,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Roger shrugged. “Since you’re so stubborn, let’s continue. I happen to have a few troublemakers with me. They’re pretty good.”

“You can come out now! If you kill them, I might let your subordinates go.” As Roger spoke, a man with iron shackles suddenly tore off his black hood.

Qin Yu gasped in shock. The person in front of him was completely unrecognizable at this moment.

His nose, and eyes, were all gouged out and sealed with curses. Moreover, the various wounds on his body seemed to indicate the inhuman torments he had endured.

Five large sealing incantations appeared on his naked body. It was the Daoist method of sealing the five senses.

It completely deprived a person of their sight, touch, smell, taste, and bodily sensations.

This was an extreme punishment, akin to being possessed, where the body felt like a walking corpse yet remained aware of its surroundings.

Such punishment was reserved only for those who committed the most heinous crimes within Daoist practices, and it persisted through generations.

However, the methods of the Demon Sealing Valley were even more refined, using curse seals to forcibly deprive individuals of their senses.

Despite his current appearance making it impossible to discern his former self, Qin Yu couldn’t shake the feeling of familiarity with the person before him, though he couldn’t recall when he had encountered him.

“You’re nothing but inhumane beasts. Even the most inhuman demons wouldn’t stoop to such depravity!” Ling’er trembled as she tightly clenched her fists.

As fellow members of the Demon Sealing Valley, only they could grasp the true horror of such punishment.

The middle-aged man walked out slowly, his aura remarkably calm, seemingly oblivious to the horrific state of his body.

“Release him!” The w woman behind Roger suddenly intoned an incantation.

The curses binding the middle-aged man were undone, allowing him to prepare for battle..
