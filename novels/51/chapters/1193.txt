Chapter 1194: Chapter 1,194, exploring the bottom of the sea again 

Hearing He Teng’s words, Tian Xuehong’s eyes immediately lit up.

That’s right! Since there were no experts in this world, why not use the same trick again?

“According to what you said, this is actually an opportunity for us?”Tian Xuehong said with faint excitement.

“That’s right.”He Teng smiled faintly.

“You don’t need me to teach you how to do it, right?”

The sky blood rainbow sneered, “I’m not a fool. Don’t worry.”

“After my spell absorbs the divine sense of a warrior, I’ll wait for the next extradition of a saint. hahahaha, excellent!”

He Teng nodded in satisfaction. He didn’t say anything more and turned to leave.

As the saying goes, whoever sees it has a share. Since he teng proposed this idea, he naturally wanted a share.

Tian Xuehong understood this principle, but he sneered in his heart.

When the spell arrangement is completed, who will care about you, he teng?

...

On the other side, Qin Yu was still looking for information about his mother. At the same time, he was also trying to recover his spiritual power.

But unfortunately, no matter what method he used, his spiritual power could not be recovered.

On this day, Qin Yu came to Ye Qing’s residence.

He cut off his white hair and wrapped his body with clothes. He walked straight into ye Qing’s home and sat on the sofa, quietly waiting for ye Qing’s return.

It was past ten o’clock in the night when ye Qing dragged his exhausted body back home.

Because Qin Yu had lost his spiritual power, he could not capture his internal Qi. After ye Qing entered the house, he did not notice a person sitting on the sofa.

“Commander Ye.”

Qin Yu’s sudden voice frightened ye Qing so much that he staggered.

He hurriedly turned on the light and looked at the man on the sofa.

“You Are... Qin Yu? !”

When Qin Yu took off his hat, ye Qing’s eyes widened.

He walked quickly to Qin Yu and frowned, “Didn’t you go to the Holy Region? Why are you here?”

Qin Yu waved his hand. “I didn’t go. I have some unfinished business. I hope Commander Ye Can Keep It a secret for me.”

Hearing this, Ye Qing couldn’t help but frown slightly, as if he was thinking about something.

Qin Yu saw through ye Qing’s doubts and said indifferently, “Don’t worry. I’m not interested in the power in this world.”

Ye Qing didn’t continue this topic, but he was clearly relieved.

With Qin Yu’s current strength, no one could stop him. Even a country would have to pay a huge price.

“You came to see me late at night, I think you must have something to do.”Ye Qing lit a cigarette and leaned against the sofa.

Qin Yu acknowledged and took out a portrait.

This was a portrait of Xuxu Yusheng. It was a portrait that Qin Yu had found many painters to draw and was satisfied with.

The person in the portrait was none other than the woman that Qin Yu had seen in the inkstone.

“Please help me investigate this person, Commander Ye.”Qin Yu pushed the portrait to Ye Qing.

Ye Qing looked her up and down and frowned. “Who is this person?”

Qin Yu was silent for a long time and did not answer.

Seeing this, Ye Qing did not continue to ask.

He took a puff and continued to ask, “Do you have any information? For example, the date of birth, location, age, and so on.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I only know that 31 years ago, she gave birth to a baby boy. Other than that, I don’t know anything else.”

“In that case, I’m afraid it will be difficult to investigate,”ye Qing said with a frown. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“If it wasn’t difficult, I wouldn’t have bothered Commander Ye,”Qin Yu said calmly.

Ye Qing thought for a moment, then nodded. “Give me a few days.”

“Many thanks.”Qin Yu cupped his hands.

As long as he lived in this world, there would definitely be traces left behind. Qin Yu firmly believed in this matter.

No one knew when the people of the holy region would arrive, so Qin Yu didn’t have much time to waste.

With ye Qing’s help, this matter was much simpler.

Therefore, in the following days, Qin Yu planned to go to the underwater world to explore.

Although he couldn’t go to the Holy Region, Qin Yu found many holy places for cultivation in the current world.

For example, the underwater world, or the burial pit in the Holy Mausoleum.

That night, Qin Yu came to a seaside.

There were few people here, and the breeze was bone-chilling.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He tried to mobilize the spiritual power in his body, but unfortunately, he failed.

“Did my spiritual power really disappear just like that?”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

According to Lu Guan, he would probably need to use vitality to offset the old qi before he could return to his previous state.

Qin Yu slightly clenched his fist and felt the vast power coming from his main body.

The power of his physical body alone was probably not weaker than any martial saint in the world.

As for the sturdiness of his physical body, it was even more terrifying. Even a mighty body could not be compared to it.

“Before I head to the holy region, perhaps I can try to refine the nine transformation golden pill and improve the fighting word formula again,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

In that case, even if he didn’t rely on his spiritual energy, not many people would be Qin Yu’s match.

He slowly sank into the sea and shot toward the bottom of the sea.

As his body sank, the pressure under the sea spread out once again.

Qin Yu’s body emitted a faint golden light. This golden light seemed to be emitted by Qin Yu’s body, and it had perfectly integrated with his body.

Soon, Qin Yu had already sunk down to ten thousand meters below.

At this moment, the surrounding water pressure could easily crush steel into pieces!

However, facing this water pressure, other than feeling a faint pressure, Qin Yu did not feel any discomfort.

“This twilight Qi has improved my physical body once again. Even without the help of the green wood true body and the fighting word formula, my physical body has surpassed any solid material in this world,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Not only that, Qin Yu’s body was also filled with an extremely vast power. This power was not weaker than spiritual power at all.

After that, Qin Yu continued to dive down. He ignored the water pressure and once again shot down for more than a thousand meters.
