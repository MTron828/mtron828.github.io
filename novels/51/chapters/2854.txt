Chapter 2855: The Will that Brings Death

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In an instant, countless ice crystals appeared on the surface of the fireball.

Ice and fire!

However, it was unknown if the Primal Chaos Flame had devoured the power here or if it was for some other reason.

The Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth was unable to suppress Primal Chaos Flame. Instead, it was being suppressed.

In just a breath, the ice crystal was covered in cracks.

As the flames spread, they instantly turned three generals into ashes.

The two Absolute Beginning Life Stones fell to the ground, but Qin Yu didn’t look happy.

The Primal Chaos Flame was known to devour all things. The only thing that could restrain it was the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth.

If the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth was destroyed, even he would not be able to survive in this terrifying flame.

In an instant, Qin Yu had already made a decision.

Ling Bo.

He stomped on the air and arrived above the Primal Chaos Flame.

Even though he had already refined the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth, the terrifying temperature at this moment seemed to make him feel suffocated.

The powers of creation in his body surged into his palm. Then a palm containing all his peak power pressed down from the void.

Thick white smoke suddenly rose from the sea of flames. The entire sea of flames seemed to be slashed.

The flames that were originally burning to the sky were now under Qin Yu’s palm with his peak power.

The flames were cut in half. The ice crystals in the sky took advantage of this opportunity to grow crazily again.

It once again surrounded the Primal Chaos Flame and entered Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu’s face was somewhat pale. The battle with Primal Chaos Flame had almost exhausted seventy percent of his peak power.

Moreover, it was extremely difficult to replenish such power in the Burial Heaven Cave.

It wasn’t just two generals. Even the other two generals which were out of his perception had died under the flames.

Qin Yu only felt some lingering fear.

As the Power of the Ancients exploded, four generals died in this small space.

Moreover, the Primal Chaos Flame seemed to be able to absorb the Power of the Ancients as fuel. Even the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth could not suppress the transformation.

If Qin Yu had not decisively used the powers of creation to suppress the power of the Primal Chaos Flame, it would probably have escaped the seal of the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth by now. Qin Yu would probably have died under this terrifying flame.

No wonder it became the number one dangerous place for Dao Xuan.

Qin Yu used his powers of creation to wrap up the three strands of the God Source and a tiny Absolute Beginning Life Stone.

His luck was pretty good. These four generals had left behind the two supreme treasures.

However, such a supreme treasure could only be enjoyed when one was alive.

Qin Yu placed his index finger on the Soul Suppression. He still could not enter the passageway here.

The power of the Nineteenth Prison was obviously suppressed by the Power of the Ancients. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu also tried to sit cross-legged for a while, but he could not replenish his peak power again.

It was as if a layer of space separated this place from the entire Saint World.

Moreover, Qin Yu was almost smashed into a meat patty by a general while he was sitting cross-legged.

This scared Qin Yu so much that he did not dare to continue trying.

Qin Yu did not notice a woman wearing a silver mask was already quietly watching the scene in the distance.

A hint of surprise flashed in her eyes. She hadn’t had such an emotion for many years.

“Lord Zi Yan, the overlapping of the two types of Power of Ancients this time has caused many people to die at the hands of the generals. However, we have also obtained a lot of the God Source and Absolute Beginning Life Stones. If we continue to hunt, we may get more than we have in the past.”

A man was kneeling on one knee behind her. The man seemed to be excited.

He was also quite surprised by the harvest this time. The God Eaters had been lying low here for many years.

Every time the Power of Ancients exploded, they could at most get two hands worth of God Source and Absolute Beginning Life Stones.

But now, they had broken their records in a short period this time.

The man’s shoulders trembled uncontrollably at the thought of this.

Zi Yan stretched out her palm and blocked the multicolored light.

The expression on her face under the silver mask revealed a seriousness that she had never seen before.

“Why do I have this uneasy feeling?”

“Stop hunting the generals. Inform everyone to focus on protecting themselves. We’ll act depending on the changes here.”

A cold voice sounded in the man’s ear. By the time he reacted, Zi Yan had already disappeared.

Between the rotation of the aurora and the ghost fog in the entire Burial Heaven Cave, the number of living beings had decreased rapidly in a short time.

In these few days, Qin Yu once again suffered from three generals.

At this moment, his peak power was almost exhausted. He had suffered quite a few injuries.

The Power of Ancients was like an ancient sun that had always been shining on everyone’s tracks.

However, Qin Yu was unable to maintain his powers of creation. Once the powers of creation were gone, he would suffer the powerful suppression of these two powers.

He was weakened and his six sensor organs were in chaos.

Every power greatly weakened Qin Yu’s combat strength.

It was an extremely terrifying thing, especially in such a dangerous place.

“This is not easy to handle.”

According to the information that Cang Yunzi had obtained, this Power of Ancients would sometimes last for a long time.

The longest one lasted for nearly ten years before it slowly faded.

He might not be able to hold on for a month, let alone ten years.

“Hahaha!”

One figure after another in the Burial Heaven Cave let out a carefree laugh.

Suddenly, his body froze and he was drawn into the sand.

A moment later, the power of the ghost fog slowly descended. It passed through the space just now.

“What a terrifying power! However, why did such a power help me?”

In the sky above him was a huge eyeball.

The pupil in the eyeball looked around and transmitted the feedback to the person below him.

This person was wearing a Tang suit and had a pair of exquisite mustaches on his face.

This person was the Upper Dome’s Lord Sui. He originally wanted to finish off Qin Yu in the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

However, he was unable to make it in time due to a series of coincidences. This time, the Eye of Destruction appeared beside him when he was in seclusion.

Moreover, it brought with it the will of a Saint Supreme. That meant he must finish off Qin Yu in the Burial Heaven Cave.

He didn’t know why Qin Yu could provoke the Eye of Destruction, but it didn’t matter as long as they had the same goal.

In any case, his goal was not to obtain the items that the big shots valued. As long as he could obtain the Soul Suppression Ring, it would be an unparalleled thing for him.

This time, the Eye of Destruction had descended upon the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

The power of the Saint Supreme could be triggered within the eye.
