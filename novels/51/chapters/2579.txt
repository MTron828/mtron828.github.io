Chapter 2580: The Skills of the Heart of Saint Kingdom

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Village Chief, how can a dead person be resurrected?”

Hong Yu said bitterly. As he had cried for a long time, his eyes were red.

“Some people die when they die, but some can be resurrected.”

The village chief said with a smile.

The village chief said with a smile.

“Strange, why isn’t my power increasing at all? Why can’t I absorb his Saint power?”

Dark Heart frowned, looking puzzled.

Killing living beings could increase one’s strength.

This was the first Saint Kingdom rule that they had ever understood. It had never been an exception since the day they were here.

It included killing the villagers here. Every villager they killed would also increase their strength.

Why was there an exception this time? Could it be that this person was still alive?

Dark Heart suddenly thought of this possibility.

In the moment of bewilderment, a dagger pierced through his head.

“How is that possible?”

This was the only thought in his mind after the world before him collapsed.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s corpse was nowhere to be seen.

Just like his killing of Qin Yu was just a dream, Dark Heart did not understand what was going on even when he died.

Time went backward to twenty seconds ago.

When Qin Yu’s head was pierced through, he suddenly heard a mechanical-like voice resonating in his mind.

“Heaven Returning Technique, activate.”

The Seal of Heaven Returning in his soul lit up. A beam of light pulled his soul that drifted toward Dark Heart into a dark green passage.

At the same time, he could see his corpse in the village.

As he stepped forward, Qin Yu suddenly realized that his head, pierced through a second ago, had strangely grown back.

Moving forward again, his body seemed to rewind through time, slowly reversing its course.

Although Qin Yu had yet to figure out the reason, he realized he could no longer move after taking a few steps.

At this moment, his body was right above Dark Heart.

His body seemed to be sitting on top of Dark Heart, but Dark Heart did not notice anything.

This was a good opportunity!

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up. Dark Heart was still in a daze, and this was the perfect opportunity to assassinate him.

“How do I go back? Quickly go back!”

Qin Yu was a little anxious. No matter what, this unforeseen event was surely a good thing for him.

As this thought appeared in his mind, Qin Yu felt his soul being forcefully pulled by an irresistible massive force.

After that, his body appeared above Dark Heart, and he still held the dagger in the same position as earlier.

He took the opportunity to wield the dagger, and the dagger sank into Dark

Heart’s head.

“Boom!”

A surge of Saint power drifted into his soul, and it was the most powerful Saint power he had ever seen.

As the two fused, Qin Yu could feel his body become very light.

“This time, I can significantly strengthen my body. This guy isn’t simple. He can gather such terrifying Saint power in such a short time!”

Qin Yu was a little surprised. Even with the help of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he was not as exaggerated as Dark Heart.

If not for the unforeseen event that had just occurred, he would have died by now.

“Brother, you’ve come back to life!.”

The voice of the little boy, Hong Yu, disrupted his thoughts. He pulled the old man in surprise and disbelief.

“Is this your village chief?”

Qin Yu frowned and stared at the young man who looked like a hoodlum before him. He looked at the little boy and the old man with suspicion.

“Yes, I am. The visitor is a guest. Hong Da, pack up and make a cup of tea for the guest. Hong Yu, go hide in the house first. Otherwise, you cry again.” The young man said casually.

Qin Yu looked at the old man strangely as he cleaned up the villagers who had died tragically and poured away the blood boiled by the monster race. That feeling was very strange. The old man looked as if he was cleaning up the house.

“So many villagers died tragically at the hands of outsiders. Don’t you hate them?”

Qin Yu asked tentatively.

“Why should I hate them? It’s survival of the fittest, and their deaths are destined. If you want to hate, then shouldn’t the demonic beasts that have been eaten for the past few hundred years also hate?” The young man asked with a strange expression.

Qin Yu did not know what to reply.

“You guys have been together for so long. Don’t you have any feelings for each other? And your strength shouldn’t be weak either. Otherwise, Dark Heart and the others wouldn’t have let you go. Why didn’t you stop them?”

Qin Yu was still somewhat puzzled. This young man looked sloppy.

However, being able to survive at the hands of three demonic cultivators, this guy was not simple.

Moreover, from what the old man had said, this guy could transform the Confused Consciousness to the Human Consciousness. This was not something that ordinary people could do.

“I can’t attack outsiders unless they trigger some kind of rules.”

The young man shook his head.

“Village Chief, I heard Hong Yu say that I was resurrected. Do you know that this is some kind of rule?”

“This is the skill of the Heart of Saint Kingdom. There are eighty-one fragments of the Heart of Saint Kingdom, each sealing a skill within. Your Heart of Saint Kingdom’s skill should be ‘Heaven Returning’. It allows you to rewind to a period after your soul is extinguished. As your soul grows stronger, the duration of the rewind will extend further back.

The village chief laughed lewdly as if he thought of a strange scene.

“If I use this to watch Widow Zhang bathe, I won’t be afraid even if she chops me to death with a knife.”

“Cough, cough, cough.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Although Qin Yu did not reveal any expression on his face, his heart was greatly shaken.

If analyzing it according to the mortal realm, it was an incredibly terrifying power of time reversal.

Moreover, he had never grasped the Way of Time. How could he use such heaven-defying power with just a Holy Kingdom Heart?

He let his divine sense look at the Seal of Heaven Returning in his consciousness. At this moment, the Seal of Heaven Returning in his soul had completely dimmed.

As a trace of power entered the Seal of Heaven Returning from his soul, the Seal of Heaven Returning slowly recovered a trace of light.

However, looking at this speed, it would probably take at least ten days to half a month to recover.

“Is there a limit to the use of this skill?”

Qin Yu quickly asked. With this thing, wouldn’t he have an additional protective talisman in this Saint Kingdom? He could explore this Holy Region even more boldly.

“The use of the skill is related to the power of the owner’s soul. Moreover, the stronger the skill, the slower its recovery. You have to wait for the Heart of Saint Kingdom to absorb enough power before you can use it again. This skill is useless. ”

The village chief seemed very well versed with the Heart of Saint Kingdom and explained these things to Qin Yu in detail.

“By the way, what is this Heart of Saint Kingdom all about?” Qin Yu asked curiously. It was the first time he had heard this name. “Aren’t you an outsider? How come you don’t even know about this?”

This time, it was the young man’s turn to feel strange.

“The eighty-one Heart of Saint Kingdom can control the entire Saint Kingdom and become the kingdom’s ruler..”
