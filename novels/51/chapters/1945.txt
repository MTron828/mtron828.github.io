1946 Xiao Sheng vs Si Shifeng

Qin Yu saw Si Shiyue and Si Shifeng walking over. The person who spoke was Si Shifeng.

With ridicule on his face, Si Shifeng’s said indifferently, “You don’t have much ability, and you dare to talk dao technique. What a joke! Aren’t you afraid of misleading others?”

Qin Yu coldly looked at Si Shifeng and said, “Everyone has the right to discuss the dao technique. What does that have to do with you?”

“Hahaha! I’m just afraid you’ll mislead others,” Si Shifeng sneered and said.

Following that, he looked at Xiao Sheng and said, “Did you hear that? Don’t blame me for not reminding you to stay away from this kid. Otherwise, you’ll get into trouble easily.”

Xiao Sheng frowned slightly, but he didn’t say anything.

The person behind Si Shifeng was somewhat displeased and loudly rebuked, “Get lost quickly! Don’t you understand?”

Xiao Sheng’s face turned cold in an instant.

He slowly got up and looked at Si Shifeng.

Xiao Sheng was very tall, probably 6.2 feet to 6.5 feet, taller than Si Shifeng by a head.

Xiao Sheng looked down at Si Shifeng at this moment and his internal qi instantly suppressed him.

It made Si Shifeng extremely uncomfortable. He looked coldly at Xiao Sheng and said, “Quickly get lost!”

“Are you talking to me?” Xiao Sheng asked coldly.

“Who else?” Si Shifeng asked.

Instantly, a murderous aura burst forth from Xiao Sheng’s body.

Si Shifeng, who was in a bad mood, became even more furious.

He glared at Xiao Sheng and shouted, “Are you tired of living?!” How dare you intend to kill me? Do you know who I am?”

Xiao Sheng didn’t say anything. He raised his slender finger and pointed it at Si Shifeng.

“Boom!”

A terrifying light instantly exploded!

Si Shifeng couldn’t dodge in time and was directly sent flying, and his face was covered in bruises!

This scene shocked everyone instantly.

Was this kid crazy? He actually dared to attack Si Shifeng? That was the Si family!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel shocked.

This guy didn’t change, and his moves were clean-cut!

“You’re courting death!” Suddenly, Si Shifeng stood up and brandished his spear, charging at Xiao Sheng!

Xiao Sheng didn’t have any magical artifacts, but spots of light appeared on his body.

These lights were like vitality gates, each exuding an extremely powerful internal qi!

Xiao Sheng raised his palm and pressed it in the direction of Si Shifeng.

In an instant, the method in his body exploded with a dazzling light, and an extremely powerful force ruthlessly crushed Si Shifeng!

“Boom!”

The moment they came into contact, Si Shifeng’s spear was sent flying! The light landed on Si Shifeng’s body, making him vomit blood, and his internal qi instantly weakened!

“So powerful!” Qin Yu could not help but be shocked!

During this time, Xiao Sheng’s strength had already reached such a terrifying level! Facing an expert like Si Shifeng, he directly crushed him!

Si Shifeng fell to the ground and vomited blood. He stood up with difficulty and glared at Xiao Sheng, wanting to continue attacking.

However, Si sSiyue stopped him and shook his head. “You’re not his match.”

Although Si Shifeng wasn’t convinced, he couldn’t defeat Xiao Sheng.

“You dare to attack the people from my Si family? Who are you?” Si Shiyue looked at Xiao Sheng and asked coldly.

Xiao Sheng’s face was expressionless as he quietly said, “I’m just a rogue cultivator. As for who he is, it has nothing to do with me. I only know that he has provoked me.”

“You’re very arrogant,” Si Shiyue said coldly.

“Aren’t you afraid of my Si family would take revenge?”

“I’ve been traveling around the world. Even if I kill him, your Si family might not be able to find me,” Xiao Sheng shook his head.

The atmosphere suddenly became extremely cold as if both sides were about to fight at any time.

Qin Yu didn’t know what cultivation realm Xiao Sheng was in now, nor did he know if he was a match for Si Shiyue. He quickly moved forward and stood beside Xiao Sheng.

Fortunately, Si Shiyue didn’t make a move. He just looked at Xiao Sheng coldly and said, ” I’ll remember you. Someone will be looking for you.”

“I’ll wait.” Xiao Sheng’s words were brief and to the point.

Si Shiyue didn’t say anything else and left with his people.

After he left, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief, and the people around her also felt relieved.

If the two of them were to fight here, everyone would probably suffer.

“What cultivation realm are you in now? You’re actually so powerful?” Qin Yu could not help but ask.

Xiao Sheng shook his head and did not answer the question.

“They’re from the Si family. You’d better be careful and quickly leave Sky City,” Qin Yu reminded him.

Xiao Sheng wasn’t in a hurry. In his opinion, even if the Si family were to send people over, it would take time. Thus, he sat back.

“What you’ve just said makes sense,” Xiao Sheng said in a deep voice.

...

“Maybe this will bring me new enlightenment. I will leave for Donghuang tomorrow.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “Dnghuang is a very dangerous place. You must be careful. I don’t think the Si family will take the risk to look for you in Donghuang.”

“Take good care of yourself,” Xiao Sheng got up and planned to leave the tavern.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry to leave. He looked at Xiao Sheng’s back and shouted, “The next time I see you, I hope you’ll be even stronger.”

Xiao Sheng paused for a moment. Without saying anything, he turned around and left.

After he left, someone gathered around Qin Yu.

“Who is that guy? He’s so fierce,” he asked in a low voice.

“You won’t know him even if I tell you,” Qin Yu said, waving his hand and said. “He’s not from Zhongzhou.”

“Tsk! Tsk! Not many people dare to make a move on the Si family like this,” he couldn’t help but sigh and say.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded but didn’t continue the conversation.

Qin Yu was tremendously shocked to see Xiao Sheng’s powerful combat strength.

...

No wonder even Dean Lei also tried so hard to extend an invitation to Xiao Sheng, even setting a precedent by reserving a spot for him.

Even Qin Yu didn’t have such treatment.

“The two brothers from the Xiao family are truly terrifying,” Qin Yu muttered in her heart.

After that, Qin Yu also left.

Si Shifeng was injured by Sheng Xiao and probably would not recover in a short time.

It was an advantage to Qin Yu. Most likely Si Shifeng wouldn’t make a move after three days, and thus the battle between the two would be postponed.

“It’s time to try breaking through,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu did not plan to leave Sky City. After all, this place once belonged to the Great Xia Royal Family. Not only was it rich in resources, but also in dao techniques. It was extremely safe.

However, Qin Yu was unsure if his thinking made sense. Thus he had to ask the Prince of Great Xia.

“I wonder if the Prince of Great Xia is easily accessible,” Qin Yu thought to himself. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After much thought, Qin Yu decided to go to the palace of Great Xia at dawn and try to meet the Prince of Great Xia.

The following morning, Qin Yu got up in a hurry and rushed to the palace of the Great Xia Royal family.
