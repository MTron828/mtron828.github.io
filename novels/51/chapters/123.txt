Chapter 124: Foundation Establishment Stage! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Almost all the spiritual energy in the Water Dragon Cave was the same, and everyone who was soaking in the water enjoyed it immensely.

Even when Qin Yu had just entered the water, he felt immense warmth.

“This is probably a qi-gathering formation!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

A natural qi-gathering formation gathered all the surrounding spiritual energy here, which was one of the reasons the Water Dragon Cave was everlasting!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu jumped into the water.

He closed his eyes, opened the pores of his body, and tried to absorb the spiritual energy in the water.

Soon, Qin Yu felt the surrounding water start to spread toward him bit by bit, but after the water touched Qin Yu’s body, it quickly spread out in all directions.

“As expected!” Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

This was actually a natural spiritual energy formation!

If he could absorb all the spiritual energy in the water, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He immediately closed his eyes and opened all the pores in his body to absorb the spiritual energy from his surroundings!

In an instant, all the water flowed towards Qin Yu. After touching Qin Yu, it quickly dispersed.

As long as it touched Qin Yu, the spiritual energy in the water would disappear completely and enter Qin Yu’s body.

Soon, a small whirlpool formed around Qin Yu!

The crowd, their faces filled with shock, couldn’t help but look over.

However, Qin Yu was completely isolated from the world while ravenously absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy.

As time passed, the flow of water in the entire Water Dragon Cave became much faster.

The density of the spiritual energy in the Water Dragon Cave far exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

The accumulated spiritual energy in the Water Dragon Cave had been accumulated for countless years, but now, it was all absorbed into Qin Yu’s body in one breath!

As time passed from noon to the evening, the tourists in the water dragon cave gradually dispersed. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In the darkness, a faint light appeared on Qin Yu’s body.

“Buzz!”

At two o’clock in the morning, Qin Yu’s body suddenly emitted waves of light!

In an instant, Qin Yu’s cells seemed to have undergone a transformation!

Even his skin became smooth and clear at this moment. It was as if a God had descended to the mortal world!

Yao Qing, who was standing by the side, was dumbstruck!

This process lasted for an entire half an hour.

During this period of time, Qin Yu didn’t have any reaction.

“Boom!”

Half an hour later, Qin Yu’s body suddenly emanated a burst of black qi!

Qin Yu also opened his mouth in an instant and spat out bursts of black internal qi!

The internal qi gradually dissipated, and in the Water Dragon Cave, a well-proportioned young man stood there quietly.

The look on his face was calm, and there was no sadness or joy on it. The muscles on his body were perfectly chiseled.

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin?” Yao Qing called out tentatively.

Qin Yu slowly looked at Yao Qing.

“I have finally advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage.” Qin Yu clenched his fist, and he felt as if the spiritual power in his body was about to burst!

Compared to the Qi Refining Stage, his spiritual power had increased by several times during the Foundation Establishment Stage!

And Qin Yu’s state of mind was also drastically different at this moment! It was as if he was a God who was overlooking the world!

“Mr. Qin, are you alright?” Yao Qing said with some worry.

Qin Yu walked out of the water. With a slight shake, the water on his body was instantly evaporated.

“I’m fine, and I’m very well.” The corner of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up into a smile.

This power was beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

If he met Liu Shihui again now, Qin Yu could easily defeat him!

“Wu Hongchang? Tao Shan? They aren’t even worth mentioning,” Qin Yu said quietly.

Qin Yu didn’t even take them seriously when he was at the peak of the Qi Refining Stage. Now that he had advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage, they were nothing to him!

Qin Yu picked up a water bead and then gently flicked it forward.

“Bang!”

The water bead was wrapped by spiritual power and shot out like a bullet!

The nearby mountain rock was instantly smashed into a big pit!

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu looked at the dumbfounded Yao Qing and said with a smile.

Yao Qing nodded blankly and followed Qin Yu out of the Water Dragon Cave.

Qin Yu slept very soundly that night. This steady and peaceful feeling was extremely enjoyable for Qin Yu.

He slept until the next afternoon.

When Qin Yu woke up, it was already three o’clock in the afternoon.

As soon as he woke up, Qin Yu saw several calls on his phone. They were all from Lu Shuming.

Qin Yu called him back and asked, “Mr. Lu, what’s the matter?”

Lu Shuming said politely on the phone, “Mr. Qin, I wonder if you have time tonight. I have to trouble you with something.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu didn’t even ask what it was and agreed.

The first reason for this was that he was short-handed.

Secondly, it was because of Qin Yu’s strong self-confidence from the inside out.

Lu Shuming, who was on the other end, couldn’t help but freeze, then he smiled and said, “Okay, I’ll pick you up tonight.”

In the evening, Lu Shuming’s Land Rover parked downstairs.

Upon seeing Qin Yu, Lu Shuming said warmly, “Mr. Qin, we meet again.”

Qin Yu nodded. After getting into the car, Qin Yu casually asked, “Mr. Lu, what do you need my help with?”

Lu Shuming smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, you also know how I started my career. I’ve offended many people during these years.”

“I have an enemy who was chased out of South City by me. I heard that he’s back recently, so I’m going to meet him tonight.”

Qin Yu immediately understood.

Perhaps this was the reason Lu Shuming spent so much money on his hangers-on.

“I heard that he trained under someone overseas these past few years and learned a lot of skills. To be on the safe side, I called you over,” Lu Shuming said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else.

Qin Yu had just advanced to the Foundation Establishment Stage, so it was time for him to find someone to practice with.

“You’d better not disappoint me,” Qin Yu said nonchalantly.

Lu Shuming didn’t say anything when he heard this.

In fact, he didn’t ask Qin Yu to come here because of Qin Yu’s skills. Instead, he wanted the help of the Yan family, who were backing Qin Yu, just in case.

If he really just wanted someone with superb combat skills, Wu Hongchang alone would be enough.

Soon, the group arrived at a relatively remote restaurant.

As soon as they entered the restaurant, Qin Yu saw that everyone from that day were there, but Wu Hongchang was still as cocky as before.

“Why is he here too?” Wu Hongchang was a little displeased when he saw Qin Yu.

Lu Shuming quickly explained, “There is strength in numbers.”

Wu Hongchang snorted lightly and said, “I alone will be enough. There’s no need for others to help at all.”

Ever since the last time they met, Wu Hongchang had been displeased with Qin Yu.

Now that they met again, Wu Hongchang was naturally unhappy.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s state of mind had already undergone a huge change. In his eyes, Wu Hongchang was beneath mentioning, and he couldn’t care less.
