The message on the phone was from Xia Hang.

He told Qin Yu an important piece of news, and this news was related to the imprisonment of Yan Ruoxue!

“The person who suspects me is the purple-robed Chen Huang,” Xia Hang said on the phone.

“As far as I know, the person who took Yan Ruoxue away from the prison that day was Chen Huang.”

Looking at this news, Qin Yu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

“Chen Huang...” Qin Yu muttered softly, and then the corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

This meant that as long as they found Chen Huang, they would be able to know where Yan Ruoxue was being held.

Thus, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Return to Jingdu immediately.”

“The injuries on your body... are they really not serious?” The man with the mustache furrowed his brows tightly.

At this moment, Qin Yu looked extremely terrifying. The blood stains all over his body almost made it impossible to see his appearance.

“It’s just a minor injury. Let’s hurry up and leave.” Qin Yu frowned and said.

Then, the two of them rushed back to Jingdu.

Qin Yu changed his clothes and prepared to go look for Chen Huang.

At night.

Chen Huang sat in his mansion as usual.

On this day, there were many guests in his mansion.

Among them were the purple-robed man who followed Xia Hang that day, as well as Yan Guiyi and the others!

“Mr. Chen, Xia Hang almost died at the hands of Qin Yu that day. He... He can’t be in cahoots with Qin Yu, right?” A purple-robed man asked.

“Indeed, Xia Hang is now the president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. His status is noble. Why should he have anything to do with a person like Qin Yu?”

At this time, Yan Guiyi couldn’t help but grit his teeth and said, “When Granny Qin recovers, Qin Yu will definitely die! No matter how stupid Xia Hang is, he won’t get involved with Qin Yu!”

Chen Huang snorted and said, “It doesn’t matter whether he has a relationship with Qin Yu or not. What matters is how to make him abdicate.”

As soon as he said this, everyone in the room fell into silence.

“Yan Guiyi, I will let you control the black-gold robe powerhouses as soon as possible,” Chen Huang said lightly.

“As long as purple-robed men and the black-gold robe powerhouses disagree with Xia Hang, he will have to step down.”

A hint of excitement flashed across Yan Guiyi’s face. Then, he hurriedly nodded and said, “Thank you, Mr. Chen!”

Chen Huang glanced at the purple-robed man and said, “When I become the president, the purple-robed men will be led by you.”

“At that time, in the entire Jingdu Martial Arts Association, other than the higher-ups, we will be the ones in charge!”

The purple-robed man was overjoyed and thanked him profusely.

Obviously, Chen Huang knew how to win people’s hearts.

“Xia Hang is just a tool to communicate with the outside world. Does he deserve to be the President?” Chen Huang snorted.

“That’s right. Before Qu Xie died, his position was even lower than mine. Now, he is suppressing me. It really makes me unhappy!” Yan Guiyi said resentfully.

Chen Huang smiled and said, “Don’t worry. After Xia Hang leaves the stage, I won’t let him off easily.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I really didn’t expect that the inner circle of Jingdu Martial Arts Association would be so exciting.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

The expressions of the few people changed, and they all looked in the direction of the door!

They saw Qin Yu slowly walking over, then sitting down next to Yan Guiyi.

Yan Guiyi’s expression changed. He stood up and wanted to leave.

“Mr. Yan, don’t be in such a hurry to leave.” Qin Yu reached out and patted Yan Guiyi’s shoulder.

“Qin Yu, don’t do anything reckless,” Yan Guiyi said with some fear.

“Reckless?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. Then, he suddenly grabbed Yan Guiyi’s arm. He exerted force with his hand and broke Yan Guiyi’s arm!

“Is this reckless?” Qin Yu sneered.

Yan Guiyi grimaced in pain and broke out in cold sweat, but he didn’t dare to say a word.

“Qin Yu, how do you know this place?” Chen Huang asked with narrowed eyes.

Qin Yu glanced at Chen Huang and poured himself a cup of tea.

“What do you think?” Qin Yu took a sip of tea and asked with a faint smile.

Chen Huang narrowed his eyes and snorted. “Xia Hang told you that?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded.

Chen Huang was stunned.

He didn’t expect Qin Yu to admit it so directly!

“Xia Hang... really betrayed the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!” Chen Huang said coldly.

Qin Yu said with a faint smile, “A good bird chooses a tree to roost in. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is at its end. Xia Hang just made the right choice.”

“Qin Yu, don’t be arrogant!” The purple-robed man said angrily.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “It was you who followed Xia Hang that day, wasn’t it?”

“You... you discovered me?” The purple-robed man’s expression immediately changed.

Qin Yu said sarcastically, “Your ability to hide is too clumsy. It’s difficult for me not to discover you.”

“So... you deliberately put on an act for us to see?” Chen Huang asked with a cold look.

“That’s right.” Qin Yu smiled faintly.

Chen Huang couldn’t help but sneer when he heard that. “You admitted it very straightforwardly.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. “Guess why I told you all these things?”

“Why?” Chen Huang asked.

“Because you’re going to die soon. Dead people can always keep secrets,” Qin Yu said faintly.

Hearing this, the purple-robed man next to Chen Huang shouted, “Arrogant! Do you think you’re invincible? No one dares to threaten us, purple-robed men!”

After saying that, he actually walked straight towards Qin Yu!

A sharp blade condensed in his palm and pierced straight towards Qin Yu’s chest!

Qin Yu didn’t dodge. He allowed the sharp blade formed by his Qi force to pierce him!

“Clang!”

At the instant of contact, the sharp blade was directly shattered!

And this purple-robed man was even forced back four to five steps!

“How could this be?” The purple-robed man’s expression changed greatly!

Qin Yu sneered. “Is that all you have?”

Before he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s figure suddenly disappeared!

In the next second, he arrived in front of this purple-robed man!

The purple-robed man only felt a golden light covering his eyes. In the next second, his head and divine sense were directly crushed!

He was killed in one hit!

The purple-robed man of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was actually unable to fight back!

This immediately made Chen Huang and Yan Guiyi’s expressions change drastically!

“Qin... Qin Yu, this has nothing to do with me. I... I didn’t hear anything...” Yan Guiyi said with a slight tremble.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Yan Guiyi, I had already forgotten about you. Why did you have to get involved in this mess?”

Just as Yan Guiyi was about to speak, Qin Yu slapped him in the air!

His head and divine sense exploded instantly!

Then, Qin Yu’s gaze fell on Chen Huang.

Chen Huang’s body tensed up. He pretended to be calm and said, “Qin Yu, what are you trying to do?”

Qin Yu ignored him and asked, “You were the one who took Yan Ruoxue away that day, right?”

Chen Huang’s expression changed and he hurriedly explained, “I was just following the orders of the higher-ups...”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I’ll give you a chance. Tell me where you took Yan Ruoxue.”

Chen Huang was stunned. He asked tentatively, “Can I tell you... in exchange for my life?”

“No.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Chen Huang said coldly, “Then why should I tell you?”

Qin Yu grinned and said, “Because I can leave your divine sense behind. You should know that if your divine sense is destroyed, your soul will be destroyed.”
