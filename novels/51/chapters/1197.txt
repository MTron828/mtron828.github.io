Chapter 1198: Chapter 1,198, the arrogant he teng 

At this moment, Qin Yu was speeding toward Jingdu.

Once the spell of the Church of the massacre immortal was activated, it could not be stopped unless Xiao Yu appeared again.

However, Qin Yu was not sure if Xiao Yu had gone to the holy region. If she really awakened all her memories, she would not need anyone to extradite her to the Holy Region.

Three lights had already lit up in the surroundings. Once all eight lights lit up, it meant that the formation couldn’t be stopped.

Qin Yu wasn’t the only one who noticed this spell. The other martial artists also noticed it.

“This is... the spell of the Sky Blood Rainbow!”

“How... how did it appear again!”

“The Sky Blood Rainbow actually hasn’t given up?”

“It’s over. Qin Yu and the others have already gone to the Holy Region. Who else can stop him...”

For a moment, the atmosphere of fear pervaded the crowd of warriors.

Ye Qing, who was investigating the news of Jade Bodhisattva for Qin Yu, also stopped what he was doing.

His expression changed slightly. He immediately dialed a number and said coldly, “Find out where Tian Xuehong is. Immediately bring some people to stop him!”

“Yes!”

Near the Heaven Gate, he teng, Tian Xuehong, and the twenty or so almighty experts were standing there.

“They actually set up so quickly this time?”He Teng looked at Tian Xuehong with some surprise.

Tian Xuehong smiled faintly and said, “There’s no need to cover such a large area this time. We just need to cover a few major areas nearby.”

He Teng nodded slightly and said, “That makes sense. Currently, all the martial artists in the world respect the Heaven Gate. More than half of the martial artists are gathered in the nearby areas. They are enough.”

As he spoke, he Teng’s eyes inadvertently looked at the Twenty-odd mighty figures.

With He Teng’s own ability, there was no way he could win against these twenty-odd mighty figures, even if they were not in their peak condition.

But with the Sky Blood Rainbow, it was a big difference. As long as he activated his spell, these twenty-odd mighty figures would also die.

When they died, the sky blood rainbow was even less worth mentioning.

The heavenly blood rainbow calmly set up his spell. Soon after, a fourth pillar of light rose from the ground.

“How much longer will it take?”He Teng asked.

The heavenly blood rainbow said, “Around two hours.”

“So Slow?”He Teng couldn’t help but feel a little anxious.

The heavenly blood rainbow sneered, “What are you so anxious for? Don’t tell me there’s someone who can stop us?”

He Teng was stunned. Then, he laughed loudly and said, “That’s true. In this world, we are already the most respected.”

“Rumble...”

At this moment, a series of rumbling sounds suddenly came from outside.

The loud sound caused the ground to buzz. The gravel on the ground was stirred up as if thousands of soldiers and horses were passing by.

Soon, war chariots appeared in front of everyone one after another.

He Teng raised his brows and a cold smile could not help but appear on the corner of his mouth.

“What’s going on?”Tian Xuehong couldn’t help but frown.

He teng snorted, “What else could it be? It must be ye Qing.”

As expected, as soon as he finished speaking, ye Qing stepped out of a military green chariot.

He looked at He Teng and the others coldly and shouted, “Stop what you’re doing right now, or don’t blame me for being rude!”

“Leave this to me,”he teng said to Tian Xuehong.

Then, he walked towards ye Qing step by step.

“Commander Ye, why are you here? Why are you making such a big fuss?”He Teng said with a smile.

Ye Qing said with a cold face, “I don’t want to talk nonsense with you. Stop your spell right now.”

He Teng said indifferently, “This spell is only targeted at martial artists and has nothing to do with ordinary people. To put it bluntly, this is a matter of the martial arts world. What does it have to do with you?”

“Impudent!”Ye Qing was instantly enraged!

“The martial arts world is also under our control. Stop it immediately!”

He teng snorted lightly, “What if I don’t?”

“Then don’t blame me for being impolite!”Ye Qing said coldly.

He Teng laughed loudly and said, “Are you relying on these broken pieces of metal behind you? Do you think these things can hurt us?”

Ye Qing looked at he teng coldly and said, “Don’t think that I really can’t do anything to you guys.”

He Teng laughed lightly and said, “That’s right. I admit that you guys do have a way to get rid of me, but it’s not by relying on these pieces of trash behind you.”

“After we finish our big task, we will leave this place and head to the holy region. Why do we need to be with you guys?”

“Commander Ye, let me give you a piece of advice. Go By yourself. Consider it as me giving you a way out. Don’t leave this stain on your career.”

Such provocative words naturally angered ye Qing.

He was already at the martial saint stage, and the internal Qi on his body instantly exploded!

“What, you plan to make a move?”He Teng squinted his eyes slightly and said.

“Commander Ye, you have already been abandoned by the times. Don’t find trouble for yourself.”

Ye Qing furrowed his brows tightly. He knew that he was not this he Teng’s opponent at all.

After so many years of working as a professional, ye Qing had long abandoned his martial arts.

Although he had already stepped into the martial saint realm, he had not fought for a long time. How Much Combat Power could he unleash?

“Let me tell you, Qin Yu will be here soon. It’s not too late for you to leave now,”ye Qing said with a face full of warning.

As soon as he said this, he teng immediately laughed even more happily.

“Who in the world doesn’t know that Qin Yu has already gone to the Holy Region? Commander Ye, do you think you can scare us with just his name?”He Teng said darkly.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the fifth light pillar lit up! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Qing’s expression changed. He took a step back and immediately ordered, “Fire! Blast them all to death!”

“Yes!”

In an instant, the sky was filled with artillery fire! This piece of land instantly became a wasteland!

But what was shocking was that Tian Xuehong and the others were actually unharmed!

Other than the clothes on their bodies, there was no other damage!

He teng sneered and said, “Although our bodies aren’t as abnormal as Qin Yu’s, I’m afraid that such firepower looks down on us too much.”

With that, he teng walked towards ye Qing step by step.

“Commander Ye, the number one person in the world back then made the wrong choice and wasted his own cultivation,”he teng said with narrowed eyes.

“He Qin Yu can kill the number one person in the world, Yan Jinyao. Today, I, he teng, will kill you, the number one person in the world, ye Qing!”
