Chapter 2563 The War Begins

Qin Yu sighed softly.

Whether a person cultivated the indifferent Path of Heaven or the compassionate Path of Heaven ultimately depended on the person himself.

“Xuan Xin, there is one more thing I would like to ask. Why did Sect Master Chen Shuang consume his blood essence to condense the Seal of Heaven Returning for me before the battle? Wouldn’t that weaken Sect Master Chen Shuang’s chances of winning?”

Qin Yu said with a frown. This Seal of Heaven Returning was the key to him evolving the Myriad Manifestation Gaze.

Although it was tremendously important to him, it was almost negligible compared to the battle between the Saints.

However, it could not be denied if it was an agreement with his father.

Nevertheless, that would be too rigid, and he could wait until after the war to condense this Seal of Heaven Returning.

“Perhaps Sect Master Chen Shuang has seen something in the future, which I can’t understand. However, with the Kingdom of Saint, even if Sect Master Chen Shuang dies here, his soul won’t die. You don’t have to worry about that.”

Xuan Xin shook his head.

The eighteen divine kingdoms actually had such power.

Qin Yu reined his scattered thoughts and looked at the dark clouds within arm’s reach.

What was supposed to happen had already happened, and he could not stop it…

Those who should not have come would not appear again.

Junior Brother Zi Yang, you’re here.”

Chen Shuang raised his head slightly and inserted the three incense sticks into the incense burner.

“Whoosh!”

His body dissipated on the spot. On the peak of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, a yellow sword energy shot out and reached the clouds.

Transforming into a rosy cloud akin to the setting sun, it swept over with the vast, sprawling dark clouds that covered the sky.

The moment the two powers of heaven and earth collided, the entire world seemed to lose its color.

In front of everyone, there were only grayish-white and black colors.

It was the power of the Saint…

If the battle venue was not in the sky tremendously far away, the residual power emitted from this attack could destroy a large number of living beings. It was a battle of a different level.

“Kill!”

The 3,000 eight-winged monster race army suddenly let out an earth-shaking roar.

Xiang Yu’s face turned ferocious, and the muscles on his right arm bulged like balloons.

He threw out the halberd in his hand like a deathly black dragon. Along its way, this halberd shredded all the humans within a hundred meters into minced meat.

The long halberd ruthlessly nailed onto the barrier of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, emanating a shocking sound.

“Demonic Qi Storm!”

His body smashed into the crowd like a meteor, and the demonic qi around his body set off a massive storm.

The surrounding people were swept into his massive demonic qi, and they were all curled into skeletons by the sharp demonic qi.

“Too weak!”

He Teng licked the blood at the corner of his mouth. He raised his enormous palm and formed a giant palm behind him.

With a wave of his hand, the demonic palm suddenly fell toward a crowded place.

The demonic palm was like a falling meteorite, smashing down with soaring demonic flames.

The faces of the people nearby revealed a look of despair. This casual attack had the strength of a fifth level, and it was not something they could block. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Get lost!”

As a cold voice sounded, the surrounding air seemed to have become a ripple.

A dull and dense spiritual energy vibration suddenly connected into a large area.

The peak master wielded a giant hammer, slightly angling his body.

The giant hammer in his hand fiercely met the enormous demonic palm. The spiritual energy of the people of Demon-slaying Peak behind him poured into the peak master’s body like spring water.

With a massive explosion, He Teng’s palm strike rotted.

“Oh? A person with only a little over fifth level strength blocked my palm strike?”

He Teng looked surprised.

“Peak Master!”

Although he got to know the people of the Human Race Watch were rushing over through the nebula map, Qin Yu still felt excited when they appeared in front of him.

Seeing the army that suddenly appeared, Xuan Xin had a complicated expression.

A cold light suddenly appeared at the Peak Master’s throat, and an enormous black wing stretched out from the void.

Draco suddenly appeared before the peak master, his scarlet eyes staring at the peak master.

However, no matter how hard it tried, the tip of its wings stopped a centimeter away from the peak master’s throat, unable to move any further.

The Mystic Ice Barrier.

A spiritual energy fluctuation that was exactly the same as before suddenly appeared, and an ice shield appeared before the peak master.

The Death Godly King’s wings were covered with a layer of ice. His body suddenly disappeared into the distance, returning to the monster army.

“Their cultivation method is a bit strange. It looks a bit like the cultivation method of our eight-winged.”

Draco said with a frown. He flapped his wings and shattered the ice crystals that covered half of his wings.

“You actually came?”

The peak master said with some surprise. He did not expect the people of the Gu family to appear.
