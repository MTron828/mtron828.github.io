1793 Another Fight

Jiu Xiao’s expression looked extremely relaxed and calm. He didn’t care about Jue Wu’s moves at all.

Jue Wu was instantly enraged. She once again rushed toward Jiu Xiao.

But this time, Jiu Xiao’s body burst out with a brilliant light.

As the light enveloped him, his movements became incomparably swift. In almost an instant, he had grabbed Jue Wu in his hand!

Jue Wu’s expression changed slightly. She tried to struggle but found the power of Jiu Xiao’s hand extremely terrifying. She couldn’t break free at all!

At this moment, Jiu Xiao raised his knee and ruthlessly hit on Jue Wu’s lower abdomen!

Jue Wu instantly felt the pain and her face turned red!

However, Jiu Xiao didn’t intend to stop. He grabbed Jue Wu and his knee kept hitting Jue Wu’s lower abdomen!

When Qin Yu, who was not far away, saw this, his face turned extremely ugly!

“Let go of her!” Qin Yu flew into a rage and rushed to Jiu Xiao!

However, Jiu Xiao only glanced at Qin Yu, and a powerful internal qi directly shook away Qin!

Jiu Xiao was indeed someone who had obtained countless inheritances from Immortal Emperor. His strength was terrifying!

Without a doubt, this was Jue Wu’s most awkward moment.

Facing Jiu Xiao, even she was powerless.

“You broke the rules, so you must be punished,” Jiu Xiao said coldly.

“Go to hell!”

Along with Jue Wu’s angry curse, her body emitted a brilliant purple light!

This light exploded and forced Jiu Xiao to step back a few steps!

Jue Wu wasn’t someone to be trifled with. When had she ever suffered such humiliation?

She raised her small hand, and a terrifying radiance kept shooting at Jiu Xiao like a cannonball!

The power of each ray of light was terrifying to the extreme, as it was accompanied by the power of the purple cloud pearl besides Jue Wu’s power.

After a round of bombarding, that area was reduced to dust.

Jue Wu wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and looked at the dust coldly.

As the dust slowly settled, several wounds appeared on Jiu Xiao’s body.

His clothes were almost torn to pieces, and his fair face was covered in bloody scars. Blood was flowing out of every part of his body.

“Jiu Xiao!”

Seeing what happened, Cao Huang’s expression changed drastically!

He looked at Jue Wu in horror, and his face was full of disbelief!

Because Jiu Xiao was extremely powerful, it was no exaggeration to say that no one in the entire Demon-slaying Peak could hurt him!

However, Jiu Xiao was in such a sorry state today. It was probably the first time in history!

Jiu Xiao’s body exuded a cold chill.

This chill was directed at Jue Wu.

Obviously, he had been angered by Jue Wu.

However, Jue Wu wasn’t a person who was afraid of trouble. No matter what cultivators she faced, she had no fear.

Jue Wu adjusted her internal qi and planned to fight Jiu Xiao again.

“Stop!”

Just then, Qin Yu stood between the two of them.

He knew that Jue Wu would most probably lose if they continued fighting. And it would not benefit any party.

Therefore, Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “This matter started because of me. It has nothing to do with Jue Wu.”

After that, Qin Yu looked at Cao Huang coldly and said, “Didn’t you want to fight with me? Fine, I’ll agree to it.”

Cao Huang also felt that things had gotten out of hand. He hurriedly walked up to Jiu Xiao and said embarrassedly, “Big Brother Jiu Xiao, forget it. It’s not a big deal, anyway. Moreover, Demon-slaying Peak doesn’t allow infighting…”

Jiu Xiao was silent for a moment. He then slowly retracted his internal qi.

“To be able to hurt me, you must have some ability,” Jiu Xiao said coldly.

“If you want to fight, let’s fight. Don’t act tough,” Jue Wu coldly snorted and said.

Fortunately, Jiu Xiao did not say anything else. He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “I hope you’ll be punctual for the appointment tomorrow morning.

After saying this, Jiu Xiao walked out.

As for Cao Huang, he seemed to know that he had caused trouble. He did not dare to stay any longer and hurriedly walked out.

After they left, Qin Yu’s face turned cold.

“Jiu Xiao, this b*stard…” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

When he saw that Jue Wu was injured, there was anger in his heart that he couldn’t release.

“This b*stard is too arrogant. I must beat him up in the future!” Jue Wu muttered.

“How are you? Are you alright?” Qin Yu asked Jue Wu.

Jue Wu waved her hand and said, “This is nothing. It’s just a minor injury.”

“That’s good.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“You should worry about yourself. Is your condition okay?” Jue Wu asked.

“As long as he suppresses his strength to the Mighty Realm, I’m not afraid of him,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

“Alright. If he dares go back on his word, I’ll definitely beat him up,” Jue Wu said, waving her small fist.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He lay on the ground with his eyes slightly closed.

Jiu Xiao’s strength was indeed terrifying. He had not used his true strength just now. Otherwise, Jue Wu definitely would not be his match.

Of course, Jiu Xiao’s cultivation realm was above Jue Wu’s, not to mention he had been in Thunder Courtyard for many years. Jue Wu certainly was not comparable with him.

The following day.

Once again, a large group of people gathered on the training field.

On the way to the training field, Qin Yu was a little worried.

Once the matter spread, this group of people would probably target Qin Yu and Jue Wu.

However, when Qin Yu arrived at the training field, he realized that things were not as bad as he had thought.

Everyone was extremely calm, and no one talked about the matter. It was as if they didn’t know that Jue Wu had attacked.

This surprised Qin Yu.

Could it be that Cao Huang and Jiu Xiao did not tell anyone about this at all?

If that was the case, this Cao Huang was rather righteous.

“Didn’t the two fight previously? Why is it happening again?”

“Maybe Cao Huang is not convinced. After all, Qin Yu had used a magical artifact previously.”

“That’s true. However, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was injured and he had just arrived at Thunder Courtyard. Understandably, he would need to use a magical artifact.”

Qin Yu was even more surprised when he heard the discussion around him.

It seemed that Cao Huang did not tell anyone about the matter!

“This guy is quite righteous,” thought Qin Yu.

As he was thinking, Cao Huang walked over from not far away.

He had quite a muscular build. He was as conspicuous as an iron tower when he walked over, Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After Cao Huang showed up, the surrounding people began to make fun of him.

“Cao Huang, you lost last time. Don’t embarrass yourself this time.”

“Yeah, if you lose to a newbie, it will be so embarrassing!”

While waving his hand, Cao Huang chuckled and said, “No, I won’t. Other than Jiu Xiao, I don’t even take any of you seriously!

“Go to hell! You continue to brag. Watch out or I’ll beat you up next time!” someone beside him laughed and said.

“After I’m done beating up Qin Yu, I’ll come and beat you up!” Cao Huang replied.

Seeing the atmosphere in the crowd, Qin Yu suddenly felt that this group of people was not as hard to get along with as he had imagined.
