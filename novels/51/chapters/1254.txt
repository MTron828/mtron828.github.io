Chapter 1255: Chapter 1255, Eve 

Di Zun was stunned. He frowned and said, “What do you mean? I’m going to take him as my master?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Not only do you have to take him as your master, but you also have to show that you’ve broken up with me.”

Di Zun was silent for a moment, then shook his head and said, “Master, I don’t understand.”

Qin Yu sighed and said slowly, “This elder Bai seems to have promised to take me to the Holy Region. In fact, he just wants to stabilize me temporarily.”

“You mean... he will kill you if you go to the Holy Region?”Di Zun asked in surprise.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Yes, it’s already very difficult for me to protect myself. I Can’t protect you at all.”

“So you must take the opportunity to cut me. Do you understand?”

Di Zun remained silent, and Zhen Yue bit her lips.

“This is the only way,”Qin Yu sighed.

“Master, why don’t you wait for the next trip to the Holy Region?”Di Zun asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I can’t wait any longer.”

He had already missed it once, and he couldn’t miss it again.

Seeing this, Di Zun could only nod and say, “Alright then, I’ll just be a spy for you!”

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Alright, once you’ve learned all of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s secret techniques, run away!”

“Hahahaha!”Di Zun couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

That night, Di Zun and Zhen Yue left the cave together and went to find elder Bai.

“Elder Bai, I’ve thought about it for a long time, but in the end, I still think it’s a better choice to take you as my master,”Di Zun said calmly.

Elder Bai raised his eyebrows and said in surprise, “Oh? Why did you suddenly think it through?”

Di zun sighed and said, “Qin Yu doesn’t have spiritual power. The moves he taught me are really difficult to fit with me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t want to leave him. Sigh.”

“Hahahaha!”Elder Bai couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Okay, I’ll agree to it.”

Zi Ru immediately shouted, “Hurry up and kneel down to acknowledge your master!”

Di Zun had no choice but to follow elder Bai’s request and kowtow three times and nine times.

After the ceremony, elder Bai nodded with satisfaction and said, “That’s right. From today onwards, you are my last disciple. I can promise you that I will make you the top disciple of the Tianyun sect in a year at most!”

“Thank you, elder Bai. Oh No, master,”Di Zun bowed and said.

With Di Zun’s connections, Zhen Yue finally joined elder Bai’s camp.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting in the cave, feeling the flow of energy in his body.

The strength of this energy was beyond Qin Yu’s imagination.

Without any hesitation, even Qin Yu himself didn’t expect that punch to be able to break the void.

When I go to the saint realm, I have to find a way to recover my spiritual energy, Qin Yu thought to himself. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Once he recovered his spiritual energy, God knows how terrifying Qin Yu’s strength would be.

In the next few days, Qin Yu sat cross-legged in the cave, slowly comprehending the battle formula.

In the last few battles, Qin Yu had never used the battle formula, so Qin Yu himself didn’t know what would happen if he unleashed his full strength.

“I wonder how Chang Mang and the others are doing.”

Qin Yu leaned against the cave at night and couldn’t help but think of his old friends.

With their talent, they should be able to cultivate very quickly.

He just didn’t know how Lu Guan’s sect was doing.

Time passed day by day, and the number of people coming for the test started to decrease.

Elder Bai had already chosen five people:

The fourteen-year-old young grandmaster, Di Zun, Zhen Yue, and the two young martial marquis.

Among these five people, the most talented one was di zun. His score was as high as ninety-three.

And in second place was the young grandmaster.

This young Grandmaster was called Hong Ping. He had delicate features and was quite handsome, but there was a trace of coldness between his brows that did not match his age.

Hong Ping’s score was 89, almost the same as Di Zun’s.

As for the other two, they only had about 70 points, which was considered good.

This selection lasted for eight days.

What surprised Qin Yu was that he teng and Jiang Yi did not participate in this selection.

“It seems that they don’t plan to go to the holy region this time,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

It had always been a pity that he couldn’t kill he teng. Of course, now that he Teng’s body had been occupied by another primordial spirit, perhaps he had already found another way to go to the holy region.

On this day, elder Bai sent someone to bring Qin Yu some news:

Three days later, they were going to the holy region.

After hearing this news, Qin Yu immediately left the east continent and returned to the Heaven Gate to make some arrangements.

Following that, he found the locked up Sky Blood Rainbow.

“I plan to bring you to the Holy Region,”Qin Yu looked at the Sky Blood Rainbow in front of him and said indifferently.

When the Sky Blood Rainbow heard this, he was immediately overjoyed and said excitedly, “Really? I have the qualifications to go to the Holy Region?”

“That’s right, but I can only bring your essence soul there,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Tian Xuehong was stunned. Before he could ask what Qin Yu meant, Qin Yu had already punched out.

This punch directly shattered Tian Xuehong’s head! If not for Qin Yu retracting his strength, even his essence soul might have been wiped out!

“Qin Yu, you...”

A hint of resentment and anger flashed across Tian Xuehong’s face.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “You know that I don’t believe you. Of course, if you perform well, I will find you another body.”
