Chapter 112: Photos of Yan Ruoxue Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Liu Shihui was so angry that his whole body was trembling! If he wasn’t afraid of the Yan family, he would have fought with Qin Yu to the death!

“Okay.” Liu Shihui pointed at Qin Yu and then sneered. “I want to see how long you can be so cocky!”

After saying this, Liu Shihui turned around and left.

Qin Yu looked at his back and couldn’t help sneering.

Then, he personally poured spiritual energy into Yao Qing and brewed a few pills to treat Yao Qing’s injuries.

Looking at Yao Qing, who was lying on the bed, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Yao Qing was really a loyal guy. Without his help, he would have been interrupted by Liu Shihui.

At noon the next day, Yao Qing woke up from his coma.

“Mr. Qin.” The moment he woke up, Yao Qing hurriedly tried to get up.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Lie down properly. You can’t move your body now.”

Yao Qing gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “It’s all my fault for being useless...”

“No.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“It’s all thanks to you,” Qin Yu said seriously.

Yao Qing forced a smile. He sighed and said, “Liu Shihui is an Inner Strength Master Hands. His strength can’t be underestimated. The gap between us is too big.”

“Inner Strength Master Hands?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

If it was compared to cultivation levels, Liu Shihui’s level was equivalent to the early Foundation Establishment Stage. He was slightly better than Qin Yu, who was at the peak of the Qi Refining Stage.

However, Qin Yu wasn’t worried.

Cultivation and martial arts were two different things. His strength was definitely above that of martial artists.

Qin Yu was fully confident that he could easily defeat Liu Shihui.

“Don’t worry, I will take revenge for you,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Yao Qing was stunned. He hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, you must not act recklessly! The Liu family is powerful. They are even above the Shen family!”

“You’ve heard of the Liu Family?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Yao Qing nodded and said, “When I was with Shen Tian in the past, they had worked together, so I know a little about them.”

Qin Yu grunted and signaled Yao Qing to continue.

Yao Qing said in a low voice, “The Liu family’s business is different from ordinary businesses. Their family supports a large number of hangers-on, including celebrities from all walks of life.”

“For example, big shots in the calligraphy world, celebrities in the jade stone world, and experts in the martial arts world...”

“Not only that, but the Liu family also focuses on martial arts. Liu Shihui is quite famous in the martial arts world of Chuzhou, and he is considered one of the best of the younger generation.”

After he heard Yao Qing’s words, not only was Qin Yu not worried at all, but he was even slightly excited.

“In that case... if I win against Liu Shihui, I will definitely become famous in Chuzhou,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Yao Qing was stunned. He didn’t expect Qin Yu to be unafraid at all!

Right now, Qin Yu urgently needed to become famous. This way, it would be more convenient for him to get in contact with people in the martial arts world.

This way, Qin Yu would be able to get the herbs faster.

“Have a good rest. I’ll bring you to South City in three days.” Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He got up and walked out.

The surrounding spiritual energy was quite dense, so Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t miss it.

He sat by the river and closed his eyes slightly while absorbing the spiritual energy from nature.

...

The matter between Qin Yu and Liu Shihui soon spread.

The Liu family was afraid that the Yan family would blame them, so they deliberately created a commotion. They wanted everyone to know that Liu Shihui and Qin Yu were having a “friendly exchange and fair competition.”

Almost half of Chuzhou had heard about the incident between Qin Yu and Liu Shihui.

“Haha, I knew that someone would try to settle the account with Qin Yu once Miss Yan Left!”

“I didn’t expect the Liu family to act so quickly!”

“With the Liu family as the vanguard, Qin Yu is doomed!”

The news spread around quickly.

At this moment, Qin Yu wasn’t fazed at all.

He was sitting by the river while absorbing the surrounding spiritual energy.

For an entire day and night, the surrounding spiritual energy was almost completely absorbed, but he was still unable to break through to the Foundation Establishment Stage.

“It seems that breaking through to the next level is much harder than I imagined,” Qin Yu opened his eyes and murmured softly.

He clenched his fists and felt the abundant power in his body.

His power was at least several times stronger than before.

“I really don’t know what kind of strength a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator will have.” Qin Yu began to look forward to it more and more.

“Excuse me, is Mr. Qin at home?” At this moment, someone suddenly shouted at the door of the villa.

Qin Yu looked over and saw a man standing at the door while looking around.

After walking all the way to the door, Qin Yu said somewhat suspiciously, “I’m Qin Yu. Who are you?”

The other party smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, there’s a package for you here. It’s from Jingdu.”

“Jingdu?” When he heard this, Qin Yu’s heart skipped a beat.

He hurriedly took the package and couldn’t wait to open it.

He saw that the package was filled with photos.

At a glance, he saw that there were at least a hundred of them.

And these photos were all of Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu at the amusement park.

Looking at these photos, Qin Yu felt a mixture of happiness and sorrow.

In the photos, Yan Ruoxue’s smile was so warm and brilliant that he wanted to touch it.

Qin Yu caressed the photos, and a happy smile appeared on his face.

“Ruoxue, wait for me.” The look in Qin Yu’s eyes instantly became extremely determined!

After signing his signature, Qin Yu took the photos back to his room.

He asked Yao Qing to buy some glue, and then pasted the hundreds of photos on the wall.

The entire wall was covered with photos of the two of them.

Looking at these photos, Qin Yu instantly felt invigorated!

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, there was only one day left before the competition with Liu Shihui.

At this time, upper class blue blood from all walks of life in South City had gathered at the Liu family.

“Young Master Liu, who is Qin Yu? How dare he challenge you to a fight?” Someone asked.

Liu Shihui took a sip of tea, and coldness flashed in his eyes. Then he said, “He’s a b*stard!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When everyone heard this, their expressions couldn’t help but turn cold.

“Young Master Liu, could it be that Qin Yu is very powerful?” Another person asked.

Liu Shihui snorted lightly. “A few days ago, my subordinate, Mr. Fan, fought with him. It’s not even worth mentioning.”

Mr. Fan was referring to the old servant who was instantly killed by Yan Jiang.

Mr. Fan’s strength was inferior to Liu Shihui’s, so Liu Shihui was completely confident.

However, Liu Shihui didn’t know that in these few days, Qin Yu’s strength had improved by leaps and bounds.

“He dares to challenge Young Master Liu despite his little abilities? Young Master Liu, give me the word, and I’ll go kill him!” Someone at the side shouted.

“Yes, we’ll go deal with him. There’s no need for Young Master Liu to personally make a move!”

Liu Shihui put down the teacup in his hand. He swept his gaze across the crowd and said nonchalantly, “Okay, but I have to remind you that he has a close relationship with Yan Ruoxue of the Yan family.”

When they heard this, the crowd instantly quieted down.

“Who’s going?” Liu Shihui swept his gaze across the crowd.

The crowd, who were still acting aggressive and indignant just now, immediately fell silent.

Liu Shihui pointed at a random person and said, “You go ahead.”

“Ahem, um... Young Master Liu, I... I have something to do these few days. I can’t... I can’t go.”

“Young Master Liu, I still have something to do at home. I have to go back quickly, so I’ll take my leave first.”

“Gee, my wife gave birth today. I forgot. Young Master Liu, I’ll leave now.”
