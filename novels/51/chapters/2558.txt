Chapter 2559 Snooping

Outside the cage, before Qin Yu’s eyes lay the boundless radiance. Vast streams of divine light intertwined, forming a dazzling world.

Qin Yu’s divine sense was blinded by this bright light in an instant for a long time before it slowly recovered.

Eighteen vast kingdoms were before his eyes.

Eighteen divine lights of different colors burst out from the periphery of these kingdoms.

These eighteen kingdoms were covered with a layer of mysterious veil as if floating in a fog, hazy and blurry.

Looking from afar, Qin Yu could only see an outline and a shadow, unable to identify its true form accurately.

It seemed to exist at the border between the real and the dream world. No matter how Qin Yu pulled his divine sense closer, he could not capture the details completely.

Qin Yu’s body trembled uncontrollably. The internal qi this kingdom emanated made every pore in his body feel an overwhelming sense of dread.

It was as though his body would turn into ashes if he were to clash with the slightest bit of this power.

Within these eighteen kingdoms, Qin Yu seemed to be able to hear the overwhelming breathing sound. It was the breathing of the Divine Kingdom.

The entire Divine Kingdom submerged and gradually fell back after a long time.

Was this the power of the Saint? He could even move the entire river of the Path of Heaven with a single breath. It was not just one of the Path of Heaven’s power of rules.

It was the entire river of the Path of Heaven.

Qin Yu suddenly felt his idea of the fifth-level’s strength resiting a sixth-level Saint was ridiculous.

In the surging sea of the Path of Heaven, only half of the water had been lost.

Half of the Holy Region slowly condensed in the middle of the eighteen Kingdom of Saint. Every Kingdom of Saint seemed to have a special connection and resonance with heaven and earth.

In just a short time, a tremendously exaggerated amount of energy had gathered in the middle of the eighteen divine kingdoms.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. It seemed that there was no sense of tit-for-tat between the divine kingdoms. Instead, there was a sense of cooperation.

The eighteen Kingdom of Saint seemed to be mobilizing the power of heaven and earth through specific rituals and ceremonies, making them unite to form a kind of sucking force that could absorb the power of the sea of the Path of Heaven.

As the energy in the middle condensed to the extreme, it suddenly exploded.

Like a downpour of thunderstorms, these energies slanted onto the Cage of the Path of Heaven.

Under Qin Yu’s shocked gaze, this Cage of the Path of Heaven actually reinforced again after receiving this surge of energy.

He felt suffocated as if the connection between his true body and his soul was about to be cut off.

Qin Yu was suddenly shocked. He fiercely retracted his gaze back into his body.

But at this moment, he realized he could not retract his gaze on the Cage of the Path of Heaven.

The vision of the Myriad Manifestation Gaze seemed to have sent a wisp of his soul to this Kingdom of Saint, not just spying.

Qin Yu was instantly shocked. If he could not retrieve this wisp of soul, it would probably impact his true body significantly.

Moreover, he did not know what methods the Saint would use to attack his true body through this soul.

“Shatter!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s true body slightly raised his head. The desolate divine eye before this had completely shattered.

Xuan Xin, beside him, stared fixedly at the Myriad Manifestations Gaze on Qin Yu’s forehead, revealing an incomparably shocked expression.

“Who exactly are you? Are you the person who has obtained the inheritance or his bloodline descendant? Previously, the owner of this pupil caused the Immortal Emperor to fall completely. Now that it has appeared again. What kind of chaos will it bring…”

Xuan Xin muttered.

The brownish-red Myriad Manifestation Gaze stared at the Cage of the Path of Heaven. Its pupils flickered with a faint light in the darkness like the faint light of the stars.

At this moment, the power of his pupil slowly entered the cage, piercing through the layers of fog and striking the core within.

They were like his hands, traces of the Path of Heaven’s power slowly unraveled and dissected under his gaze.

Finally, that layer of seal weakened again. Taking this opportunity, that wisp of soul drilled back into Qin Yu’s body.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s face was ashen. It had only been a few seconds, but it was like a century to him.

Following the departure of the wisp of Qin Yu’s soul, a violent wind suddenly blew where his soul was previously.

A figure slowly appeared. His body was enveloped in a layer of faint divine light like the embodiment of an ancient god. Every step he took seemed to resonate with some rules between heaven and earth.

At this moment, his eyes were staring at the spot where Qin Yu had left, and a hint of doubt appeared on his face.

He stared at the place. At this moment, the world where Qin Yu’s divine sense was previously seemed to have frozen.

He slowly peeled it off from its original spot and placed the world gently in his hand.

The figure’s lips curled into a strange smile, and a mysterious and powerful internal qi emitted from his body. He closed his eyes and immersed himself in deep meditation. A gentle breeze gently blew his long robe, causing it to flutter.

The scene between heaven and earth kept changing in front of him as if the progress bar and timeline of space were constantly adjusting.

A transparent thread appeared on his other hand.

Guided by this wisp of internal qi, the figure closed his eyes. In the space on his left hand, one could clearly see his soul began to seep into the dimension of time and space.

His thoughts were like an invisible clue, entangled in the long river of time. He began to deduce and search for the source of the internal qi that was left behind.

Suddenly, the figure’s eyes slowly opened, and a smile appeared on his face.

“I’ve caught you…”

Suddenly, a sense of extreme vigilance sounded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. This feeling was as if someone was frantically stabbing his sea of consciousness with needles.

At this juncture, he no longer cared about his depleted soul power. He quickly threw his soul into his sea of consciousness. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The nebula map in his sea of consciousness seemed to be about to explode at this point. He did not know what had happened.

As soon as his divine sense entered it, he discovered a scene that shocked his mind.

A person slowly walked toward him, and in the end, that person was none other than him.

It was the image of the Saint that he had been monitoring previously! Looking at the figure walking toward him, Qin Yu felt his body had fallen into an ice cave. For a moment, he was stunned on the spot.

“Stop daydreaming! Use the energy of the Seal of Heaven Returning to activate the Myriad Manifestations Gaze and cut off your internal qi completely!”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s voice was like a thunderclap in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Only then did Qin Yu react and activate the Myriad Manifestations Gaze.

He retained his eye power on his body and completely cut off the cosmic luck he was emanating.
