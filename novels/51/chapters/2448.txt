2449 Son of an Old Friend

Xiao Hai chuckled as he locked onto another army.

“The last interesting living being I came across is the masked woman. The Path of Heaven is in chaos. Perhaps you are a variable in this chaos of the Path of Heaven. Have you ever thought that as you become stronger through battle, you will ultimately become the sharpest sword in the ghost realm?”

Little Bodhisattva watched as the ghost race army was slaughtered in a frenzy, but he did not care at all.

“It won’t happen.” Xiao Hai smiled and shook his head.

Little Bodhisattva looked at Xiao Hai’s confident look and seemed irritated. He did not know how many tens of thousands of years had passed, but this strange emotion had surfaced for the first time.

He moved his hand slightly, and the ghost moon responded to his gesture and emitted an intense light. The suction force was like the giant mouth of a Kun Peng, piercing through Xiao Hai.

Xiao Hai did not react. His mental ability had already dissipated, and his current actions were almost all instinctive.

Why did the dissipation of mental ability not affect this human being?

Little Bodhisattva could not understand.

“Stop trying to figure it out. I have some ideas that I want to attack you with.”

After killing these troops, Xiao Hai suddenly appeared before Little Bodhisattva.

He struck out with his palm again.

Soul Piercer.

The way that was extremely fine enveloped his hand.

The palm landed on Little Bodhisattva’s body simply and directly.

In an instant, a mighty power entered Little Bodhisattva’s body and pierced through.

It was a tremendously simple power of the way, but it had directly flattened tens of thousands of miles behind.

“You’ve become stronger again. The simple power of rules can unleash such formidable power in your hands. It’s truly not simple. Even King Qin Guang couldn’t do it.”

Little Bodhisattva once again revealed an expression of interest, mimicking the palm strike that Xiao Hai had just unleashed.

“It’s still not enough.”

Xiao Hai shook his head and sat down cross-legged directly to cultivate.

After three consecutive attacks, he had gained some enlightenment, and just sat cross-legged on the ground.

“Xiao Hai, since you have completely died from the human race, you are now a member of my ghost realm. Why don’t you let go of your instinctive obsession and completely become a member of the ghost realm? This way, I won’t have to follow you all the time. After this chaotic reshuffle, the ghost realm may be able to replace the human race.”

“I believe in my instincts.” Xiao Hai’s voice was calm.

“I found an interesting little brat. This person seems to be an old friend of yours.”

With a wave of the Little Bodhisattva’s palm, waves surged through the sky.

It was as if ripples were stirred up in the lake. When the ripples subsided, Qin Yu’s figure appeared in the sky.

Xiao Hai frowned slightly. He felt this person very familiar.

He stared at the little Bodhisattva and wondered what he wanted to do.

“Using the power of the soul to break the space between the two realms, he has defeated the black and white reapers, Ox-Head, Horse-Face, the day and night wandering deities, and other ghost messengers. Moreover, his talent seems to be as monstrous as yours. I feel that he is stronger than you.”

Little Bodhisattva looked into the void and then landed beside Xiao Hai.

“I want to make an attempt and then make a deal with you.”

“I never make deals.” Xiao Hai frowned slightly, not knowing what this little Bodhisattva was planning.

He smiled and did not answer Xiao Hai.

In front of Qin Yu, the ground suddenly burned with a raging ghost fire.

This ghost fire could burn the soul. Even if a trace of its power came into contact with the soul, it would continue to burn into ashes.

A terrifying power instantly covered the entire space. Tens of thousands of ghost races suddenly trembled and knelt on the ground at the same time.

In front of Qin Yu, a middle-aged man with a fierce and determined appearance descended from the sky, slowly hovering to the ground. He had fierce eyes like a leopard, a lion-like nose, sideburns, wore a square-shaped crown on his head, and held a tablet in his left hand against his chest.

His gaze landed on Qin Yu. In an instant, Qin Yu felt a tall mountain pressing down on him.

The might of a single gaze had been so terrifying.

His eyes were filled with intricate patterns, and in that brief moment of locking eyes, Qin Yu was lost in thought for a while.

He could feel his soul memories being replicated by a unique power and then entering that eye.

“The first hall Yama, King Qin Guang.”

The young man’s expression was cold, wondering why the leader of the ten Yamas would appear here.

“So you’re the son of an old friend, but it seems the tiger’s fierceness did not pass down. I wonder why K?itigarbha Bodhisattva has specifically asked me to meet you.”

King Qin Guang said in a hoarse voice.

Hearing this dignified voice, Qin Yu was powerless to respond.

At this moment, most of his strength was resisting King Qin Guang’s soul power.

“At the Tribulation Fifth Level, he has peeped the power of the origin. In addition, King Qin Guang is the chosen one of the ghost realm. This battle is indeed bullying.”

Xiao Hai’s palm moved slightly.

“See carefully. I arranged this battle. You can’t make any move.”

Little Bodhisattva sat on the ground.

“He will win.” Xiao Hai took a step back and sat down as well. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“So confident?”

“Someone who can leave an impression on me must not be simple. Even King Qin Guang can’t kill him.”

Xiao Hai’s expression was very calm, just like in the Holy Region.

As long as it was something he had set his mind on, it would not change.

Just like the war between Nanzhou and North Plain in the Holy Region, he had single-handedly held off the invasion of North Plain.

No matter how many benefits North Plain offered him, his determination did not change.

The three lunatics, three extremes, one legend, he was the one who had always stood at the top.

After his death, his soul entered the ghost realm, but he still did not seem to have changed.

“The gap is too big. He can’t win.”

Little Bodhisattva shook his head again. Above the Tribulation Transcending Stage, closing the gap between each cultivation realm is as difficult as the awakening of insects during the “Waking of Insects”.

This was especially true for King Qin Quang, the chosen one of the netherworld. Regardless of his strength or cultivation method, he was at the top.

With Qin Yu’s current strength, attempting to battle across realms was extremely difficult.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly turned pitch-black.

The ghost messenger token appeared above his head, and the power of the Path of Heaven of the ghost race instantly penetrated his entire soul.

Evil Eye released a green sword aurora that almost completely devoured the power of the Path of Heaven.

Facing King Qin Guang, even stabilizing himself was difficult, let alone holding back.

Therefore, Qin Yu started to go all out at this moment.

Soul Guiding Power!

It was the power of rules the black and white reapers used, and it was also the most extensive sea of the Path of Heaven in the ghost realm.

The token of the ghost messenger floated above Qin Yu’s soul, exuding a mysterious power.

Like a cultivator casting a spell, the dark soul’s sea of the Path of Heaven surged with shocking waves.

The power of the seabed was injected into Evil Eye through the token, and Evil Eye’s sword aurora turned tremendously green.

It was still not enough…

Even if he used the power of the seabed, it was only the power of the Tribulation Fourth Level Condensed Throne.

“If it’s just like this, you may go without worry.”

King Qin Guang stared at Qin Yu with an indifferent expression. He seemed a little disappointed. This was the trash that he had wasted his time to come to deal with?
