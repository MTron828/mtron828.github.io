2513 Alliance’s Summon

“Hahaha, I’m just joking. However, I seem to get used to this kind of busy life. I was in charge of all the trivial matters in the Moon Listening Pavilion in purgatory. I quite like this feeling.”

Seeing that the flesh from Qin Yu’s waist was about to be pinched off, Ji Yue explained with a smile.

“Hmph.”

Yan Ruoxue snorted before she let go of Qin Yu.

Just as everyone was about to confirm the details, Ji Yue suddenly frowned.

“Someone from the alliance is here. They seem to want you to make a trip to Sky City.”

At the entrance, two Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators were waiting. They cupped their fists in admiration when they saw Qin Yu and the others.

In this war, the role of Human Race Watch was noticeable.

Especially when Qin Yu managed to stall the Fallen Godly King, which also helped Human Race Watch not to be outdone.

If the Fallen Godly King was allowed to fight among the human race, no one seemed to be able to stop this terrifying number one Godly King of the monster race, except Si Shiyue and Teng Zixu, who might be able to.

“On the orders of Revered Qi, I invite Qin Yu to Sky City for a chat.”

One of them said softly. After that, as if afraid that Qin Yu would misunderstand, he explained again.

“It’s probably about the arrangements for Human Race Watch after this battle.”

“Alright, I’ll set off immediately.”

Qin Yu agreed without much hesitation.

This war had also imperceptibly narrowed the gaps among the various factions of the human race.

Under such circumstances, it would be courting death if the human race continued to engage in internal strife. Therefore, Qin Yu was not as worried as previously.

“Alright, if Senior Qin Yu is fine, please set off as soon as possible. Revered Qi sounded a little anxious, and he seemed to have something important to discuss.”

Another person also said with some admiration. Qin Yu knew this person. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He should be the younger brother of the Jiang family’s Holy Son, Jiang Wushuang. He did not expect him to become a member of the alliance.

The alliance members who could enter Sky City were almost all core members of the great aristocratic families.

Only those who had great value would enter the alliance. They received generous treatment If they contributed, they would have many copies for treasures.

Although this person was a messenger, his status was far higher than most of the cultivators in the Jiang family.

“Alright, we can set off today.”

Qin Yu nodded.

Qin Yu asked with a frown after the two left.

“Revered Qi Zun has invited me, so he probably won’t attack me, but I can’t figure out his thoughts either. Do you guys think I should go to Sky City?”

“As far as I know, Su Xinghe and the loli of Divine Night Sect are still in Sky City. This time, they should be discussing some matters between the alliances. I think you can still go. Moreover, I’m afraid it won’t be good if you don’t go. I wonder what those people from the Ji and Ni family are going to say. I think you can go, and should go all out to make a big show of it.”

Ji Yue said with a cold smile. She could not figure out what the alliance would use to make things difficult for Qin Yu.

If the alliance still dared to suspect Qin Yu based on his performance this time, it would naturally cause a tremendous stir within the human race.

“Then I’ll make a trip to the alliance. Although Immortal Crane and the other higher-ups are heavily injured, we have to prevent them from having healing treasures or hidden methods. It just so happens that I have some details to discuss with the alliance.”

The alien race currently had various arrangements like the masterpieces of God’s hand.

Including killing Yan Tianfeng and others previously, they had fooled the human race.

Therefore, they had to be well-prepared. If the alien race ambushed them again, the higher-ups of the human race should take action simultaneously.

Since he had already decided to head to the alliance, Qin Yu set off immediately after talking to the dean and the others. Soon, he arrived at Sky City.

After the guards on duty reported his arrival, Qin Yu followed them into the former Great Xia Palace.

This place had been completely refurbished after the last war.

At this moment, this place was even more luxurious and beautiful than previously.

Qin Yu walked into the main hall. The tall ceiling was covered with exquisitely drawn murals as if vivid stories were unfolding before his eyes, immersing him in endless history.

“This is the original appearance of the Grand Xia Palace. Some craftsmen familiar with history restored it one by one. Even the former royal family could fall into the dust of history. Isn’t this the same as the current status of the human race? The alliance naturally chose this place for this reason.”

Yan Minglong looked at Qin Yu, who fell into silence and said softly.

All the higher-ups were there, including Si Shiyue, who had just come out of seclusion, and Teng Zixu.

The alliance leader, Revered Qi, was also there.

“This time, you used the power of your Human Race Watch to hold back He Teng, the Godly King who has fallen into the monster realm. You can be considered to have won a great advantage for the human race. We’ve seen you in the ninth level of the purgatory previously. At that time, we were already shocked to the core, but we didn’t expect you to give us such a bou endless pleasant surprise again in this battle.”

Jiang Qingyuan suddenly patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and revealed a rare smile on his face.

“Martial Uncle, you know this kid?”

Jiang Wushuang was shocked.

“Yeah, I met this kid in purgatory. Look at yourself. What kind of sh*t you’ve cultivated after consuming all the resources of the family!”

Jiang Qingyuan pointed at Jiang Wushuang’s head and cursed.

“Yes, yes, yes! Martial Uncle is right!”

Jiang Wushuang dared not even utter a sound and quickly dodged to the side.

“It’s a pity that Baiyi has passed away. Otherwise, she would get to see your elegant demeanor.”

Yan Minglong’s expression was a little gloomy. They were guarding the ninth level of purgatory all the time, and the three had deep friendships.

They did not expect Baiyi of the Gu family to be the first to die.

“Qin Yu, although Gu Ning had schemed against you, I swear on the name of my bloodline that the members of the Gu family will definitely join Human Race Watch sincerely. Please treat this bloodline well.”

Jiang Wushuang hesitated for a moment and said.

Initially, the alliance had a different opinion about this matter and wanted to force the Gu family members to join the alliance.

In the end, due to different opinions, they dropped the proposal.

“Don’t worry, Senior Jiang. Senior Baiyi had taken good care of me, and I could feel it. Besides, I have a good relationship with the Saintess Gu. In Human Race Watch, the Gu family has always been the one that allocates the most resources. This time, I plan to bring the family members who volunteered to go to purgatory.”

Qin Yu said solemnly to the two seniors. These seniors could guard the ninth level of purgatory for nearly a Path of Heaven year.

The loneliness and sacrifice involved were not something ordinary people could imagine.

“This time, taking the opportunity of the alien race’s higher-ups being severely injured, we need to take some actions. At that time, we might join forces again in purgatory! They forced the human race to reveal the trump card. We naturally can’t let it go so easily.”

Jiang Qingyuan sneered and said.
