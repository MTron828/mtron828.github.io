2177 Retreat in the Void

In the void, a strange scene appeared around Qin Yu’s body. The light around his body gradually increased, like a dazzling halo surrounding him.

As the speed at which he absorbed the chaotic qi increased, the surrounding void began to distort. The weak light penetrated the darkness, illuminating a colorful and blurry scene.

The brilliant beams of light intertwined in the void, forming countless strange geometric patterns like twinkling stars in the starry sky. These beams of light flickered with the rhythm of Qin Yu absorbing chaotic qi, emitting a mesmerizing light.

At the same time, an invisible force surged into the void. This power contained the mysteries of the universe and had infinite possibilities. It merged with Qin Yu’s body in an incredibly subtle way, permeating into every cell of his, filling his body with surging power.

As the absorption of the chaotic qi continued to deepen, Qin Yu’s physique gradually changed. His muscles gradually became stronger and more powerful, filled with the tension of strength. His skin had become even more delicate, like a translucent polished jade. His eyes shone with a deep light as if he could see through everything.

At the same time, his consciousness entered a state of transcendence. He could feel the pulse of the universe and sense every movement. His thoughts became clearer while his insight also increased significantly. He seemed to resonate with the universe and found a sense of harmony with his inner strength in the void.

In this strange scene, Qin Yu’s body gradually merged with the power of chaos, becoming a part of the universe. He could sense the universe’s boundless vastness and feel his insignificance. However, he did not feel fear or despair. On the contrary, he felt an unprecedented confidence and strength.

The chaotic qi continued to instill in Qin Yu’s body, and his body began to undergo subtle changes. Veins surged on his muscles, forming a complex and exquisite pattern like an incomparably mysterious painting scroll.

Qin Yu’s body emitted a majestic internal qi as if he had transformed into an endless source of power. His existence seemed to shake the order of the universe, causing the surrounding void to tremble.

In this void, Qin Yu felt his transformation and evolution.

…

At the Yan family, with the help of the Yan family’s alchemist, Jue Wu finally woke up slowly.

She looked at the unfamiliar environment around her and could not help but frown slightly.

“You’re awake.” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue’s voice came from the side.

She saw Yan Ruoxue sitting in front of the wooden window with a needle and thread in her hand. She did not know what she was sewing.

Jue Wu rubbed her head and sat up from the bed.

She looked at her healed wounds and said, “Did you help me?”

“Who else could it be?” Yan Ruoxue smiled faintly.

Jue Wu was silent for a moment before saying, “The Yao family must have come to look for me, right?”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue said lightly, “You’d better stay in the Yan family for now. Although the Yao family dares not barge into Mount Donghuang, they must be waiting nearby.”

Jue Wu snorted and said, “I’m not afraid of them. With their abilities, I can kill them single-handed!”

“if they dare to come, they’re naturally fully prepared. Don’t be reckless,” Yan Ruoxue said.

“This place is very safe. Without my permission, no one will come in. You can recuperate here.”

Jue Wu thought for a moment and said, “Thank you. Is there anything to eat? Quickly get me something to eat. I’m starving!”

Yan Ruoxue could not help but laugh. She immediately arranged for people to bring food to Jue Wu.

In the following period of time, Jue Wu temporarily stayed in Mount Donghuang.

She watched Yan Ruoxue’s cultivation from the side every day and discussed dao with her from time to time. As time passed, the relationship between the two slowly eased.

In the blink of an eye, Jue Wu had been here for a month.

During this month, the news of the Yao family’s Supreme Elder being killed spread throughout the entire Zhongzhou.

This immediately caused the Yao family to become even more restless. They sent a large number of people to the vicinity of Mount Donghuang. The moment Jue Wu dared to go out, she would definitely suffer the most severe revenge from the Yao family.

…

In the depths of the void, Qin Yu silently deduced everything.

Although there were no rules of time here, Qin Yu still figured out the rules in the long process.

He could rely on his own deduction to count the passage of time.

In the blink of an eye, half a year passed.

During this half year, Qin Yu’s internal qi had improved unprecedentedly, even completely fusing with the void.

That dense internal qi seemed to have become a gift from the heavens that had brought significant improvement to Qin Yu’s cultivation.

“Swoosh!”

On this day, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes, and two rays of light burst out.

The void quickly devoured them, but Qin Yu’s eyes were bright and spirited.

“At this rate, it might only take a few years to reach the True Saint Realm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Such speed was beyond imagination. It was equivalent to stepping into the True Saint Realm before the age of fifty.

In the entire Holy Region and even the entire cultivation world, this speed was indeed considered outstanding!

“Speaking of which, it’s a blessing in disguise.” Qin Yu sighed in his heart.

He felt the internal qi in his body and tried to stand firm in the void. Unfortunately, the space here was tremendously strange. Qin Yu’s body was like a small boat in the vast ocean that could only sway along with it.

“After I become a True Saint, I’ll have a chance to escape this d*mned place,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Thinking of his date with Si Shiyue, Qin Yu’s eyes instantly lit up with determination.

Following that, Qin Yu closed his eyes again.

However, Qin Yu did not expect 50 years to have passed when he opened his eyes again.

The passing of time was far more terrifying than he had imagined. It was nearly impossible to sense the flow of time during cultivation, especially in the void.

Qin Yu only felt that her cultivation was like a duck to water. The absorption of chaotic qi was far beyond imagination. All the internal qi seemed to be able to fuse with his body, causing the true essence in his body to expand rapidly.

In the blink of an eye, ten years went by. Qin Yu was still immersed in this cultivation.

And during the ten years, the Holy Region had changed rapidly under the great era.

Numerous young cultivators stepped into the True Saint Realm. Many among the young heaven’s favorites were invincible in the Holy Region. Si Shiyue, Holy Son Jiang, Teng Zixu, and others were the best among them.

Besides these heirs of the aristocratic families, many rogue cultivators also stood at the top. They were Xiao Yuan, the long-disappeared He Teng, and Jue Wu, who was being pursued by the aristocratic families.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
