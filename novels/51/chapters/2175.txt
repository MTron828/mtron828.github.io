2176 Save Her

Yan Ruoxue was a smart person. Thinking of Jue Wu’s injuries, she immediately understood everything.

“The Yao family…” Yan Ruoxue murmured. She stared in the direction of the internal qi, and coldness filled her eyes.

After a short while, several elders of the Yao family appeared nearby Mount Donghuang. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Floating in the air, they looked coldly at Yan Ruoxue beneath. Besides coldness, there was a hint of vigilance in their eyes.

“Deducing from the internal qi, Jue Wu is here,” an elder of the Yao family said coldly.

“This is the Yan family’s territory, after all. No matter what you do, you must be careful,” an elder said in a low voice.

Then, they slowly descended and arrived before Yan Ruoxue.

An elder smiled, cupped his hands, and greeted, “Saintess of the Yan family.”

Yan Ruoxue coldly glanced at the two and said, “You barged into the Yan family’s Mount Donghuang in the middle of the night. Are you declaring war on the Yan family?”

The elders were stunned. They did not expect Yan Ruoxue’s attitude to be so cold and to label them straightaway!

“Saintess Yan, this’s not true.” Although the elder was furious, he suppressed his anger and spoke politely.

“Please go back then. The Yao family doesn’t welcome you,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

Hearing this, an elder said coldly, “Isn’t Saintess Yan going overboard? A few days ago, you went to my Yao family raising a ruckus, but my Yao family didn’t say anything! Now, we have only come to Mount Donghuang, and you put such a label on us. Could it be that you really don’t take my Yao family seriously?”

“Honestly speaking, my purpose of going to the Yao family that day was to start a war, but so what?” Yan Ruoxue said with a hint of sarcasm. “If you are willing, you can always do the same. No one will stop you.”

“You!” The elder was furious but could not do anything to Yan Ruoxue!

“Saintess Yan, please calm down. It is indeed our fault for disturbing you so late at night. Our trip here is to look for someone,” an elder walked out and said with a smile.

“Who is it?” Yan Ruoxue pretended to be ignorant.

“Jue Wu,” the elder said politely.

Yan Ruoxue snorted and said, “I’ve never seen any Jue Wu here. Please leave immediately.”

“Saintess Yan, we indeed followed her internal qi to this place, and it just so happened that her internal qi disappeared at Mount Donghuang!” an elder said coldly.

“So what?” Yan Ruoxue snorted and said. “I’ve told you, there is no Jue Wu here. I want to rest now. Please leave!”

“Yan Ruoxue!” An elder was furious but was quickly stopped by the other elder.

“Saintess Yan, Jue Wu went to my Yao family raising a ruckus. She killed countless people and even a Supreme Elder. We have to kill her,” a slightly older elder said tremendously politely.

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue could not help but feel shocked!

Did she kill a Supreme Elder? Jue Wu actually had such an ability?

This was indeed a great thing!

Nevertheless, Yan Ruoxue maintained a calm expression on her face.

She glanced at the elder and said indifferently, “I’ve told you. I don’t know any Jue Wu. As for who she killed, it has nothing to do with me. I’ll say it one last time, leave this place immediately!”

Several elders did not say anything else and looked at the slightly older elder.

After a moment of silence, the elder smiled and said, “How about this? Saintess Yan, please do us a favor and let us search for it. If we can’t find it, we are willing to apologize to SaintessYan. If…”

“No.” Before he could finish, Yan Ruoxue interrupted him rudely.

She looked at them coldly and said, “Who are you to search for Mount Donghuang?”

The elders of the Yao family looked at each other in dismay. They realized that Yan Ruoxue’s hostility toward the Yao Family had reached an extreme point. She would not let them off easily.

“Saintess Yan, we’re not here to make things difficult for the Yan family. We only want to find Jue Wu and solve all the mysteries,” an elder tried to ease the situation.

Yan Ruoxue smiled coldly and said firmly, “In that case, you can leave Mount Donghuang. There’s no need for you to stay here.”

The Yao family elder looked at each other and understood that Yan Ruoxue had made up her mind. They knew confronting Yan Ruoxue on the Yan family’s territory would not bring them benefits.

“Alright, since the saintess is so determined, we’ll leave for now,” an elder of the Yao family said through gritted teeth. They knew that staying here would only cause them more trouble.

Under Yan Ruoxue’s watchful eyes, the Yao family’s elders turned around and left. Floating in the air, they flew into the distance. Their hearts were full of anger and resentment, but they could not do anything to Yan Ruoxue at the moment.

Yan Ruoxue watched as the Yao family’s elders left. A trace of coldness was between her brows. She knew that the Yao family would not end things here. The safety of Jue Wu and Qin Yu was still her main concern.

“Uncle Yan, strengthen the defense of Mount Donghuang. We must always be vigilant,” she ordered coldly.

Uncle Yan nodded slightly and said, “They definitely won’t leave just like that. I’m afraid they’ll wait outside. Speaking of which, this Jue Wu is quite crazy. She actually killed a Supreme Elder of the Yao family. It’s been a long time since such a thing has happened.”

“Yes, that’s why I must keep an eye on her,” Yan Ruoxue said softly.

Then she looked at Uncle Yan and said, “Uncle Yan, immediately go and call the best alchemist of the Yan family over to treat Jue Wu’s injuries.”

Uncle Yan nodded in agreement and vanished.

At a mansion in Mount Donghuang, Jue Wu was lying on the bed, unconscious.

Yan Ruxue stood before Jue Wu, quietly looking at her pale face.

After a long time, Yan Ruoxue chuckled and said, “Qin Yu seems quite charming.”

…

Deep in the void, Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged, frantically absorbing the purest chaotic qi from the void.

His body still suffered from intense pain, but it was precisely because of this that it constantly tempered his temperament.

In this place, Qin Yu could not sense time or anything at all, except endless nothingness.

In the depths of the void, a pitch-black and silent landscape stretched endlessly. There were no stars, no light, and no traces of any existence. It was a realm of nothingness, unaffected by the constraints of time and space.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged in the void. His body emitted a weak light, forming a sharp contrast with the surrounding darkness. His entire body seemed to be bound by an invisible restraint. The pain came like a tidal wave, making him almost unable to withstand it.

Chaotic qi permeated the void. It was a formless energy that contained the universe’s power of origin. Qin Yu yearned for this power because he knew it was only through absorbing the chaos qi that he could break through his limitations and obtain greater power.
