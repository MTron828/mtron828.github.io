The man with the mustache jumped down from the wall.

He walked in front of Qin Yu and rolled his eyes. “You’re already injured, and you still have the mood to ask this?”

How could Qin Yu listen to all this? He said anxiously, “Are the things ready or not?”

The mustache man shook his head. “It’s not that simple. I’m still lacking material. I need you to go with me.”

“But looking at you now... I’m afraid you won’t be able to go.” The mustache man spread his hands and said.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “You need me to go with you? Why?”

The mustache man said seriously, “I need your constitution.”

Qin Yu immediately fell into silence. He gritted his teeth and said, “Okay, I’ll go with you now.”

“If you go now, you’re going to die.” The mustache man shook his head and said.

“Even if you’re at your peak condition, you may still get seriously injured. In this state, you’ll definitely die.”

Having said that, the mustache man patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Fellow Daoist, you’d better take good care of your body first. Some things can’t be rushed.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, as if he was thinking about something.

A moment later, he looked at the mustache man and said, “Wait for me for a week. I’ll go with you in a week.”

“A week?” The mustache man raised his eyebrows.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “Do you think your injury can be cured in a week?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “There are some things that I can’t explain to you. In short, come and find me in a week.”

Seeing this, the mustache man could only nod and say, “Since you’re so stubborn, alright then.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude, then turned around and was about to leave.

“Where are you going?” The mustache man hurriedly asked. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I’m going to do something,” Qin Yu said.

After saying this, Qin Yu no longer paid attention to the mustache man.

He supported his body with great difficulty and left the place.

Looking at Qin Yu’s back, the mustache man couldn’t help but squint his eyes.

“TSK TSK, this kid pushes himself too much,” The mustache man said in a low voice.

...

Xia Hang’s home.

A man covered in a black robe was sitting on the sofa, panting heavily.

This man was none other than Qin Yu.

His eyes were half-open as if he would close them at any time.

Even though Qin Yu wrapped himself tightly with his clothes, fresh blood still seeped through the black robe and dripped onto the sofa.

The entire room was filled with the stench of blood.

Xia Hang, who had returned home, quickly found Qin Yu lying on the sofa.

He quickly walked in front of Qin Yu and said coldly, “You still dare to come! Now, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is arresting you and the authorities are looking for you. Don’t you know!”

Qin Yu grinned and said, “Of course, I know... Xia Hang, I came to look for you because I have something important.”

“What is it?” Xia Hang asked coldly.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said in a weak tone, “If I want to take down the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, I will need your cooperation... only by working together in collusion from the inside and outside of the association will I have a chance.”

Xia hang said coldly, “I have already made it clear to you last time that my position in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is just an empty position.”

“And ever since what happened last time, Qu Xie doesn’t trust me anymore.”

Qin Yu waved his hand weakly and said, “I’ll give you a chance to get real power and regain his trust.”

“A chance? What chance?” Xia Hang frowned.

Qin Yu pointed at his nose and said, “As long as you capture me back, you’ll naturally regain your trust and the attention of the higher-ups.”

“Bring you back?” Xia Hang raised his eyebrows and then sneered, “Do you know that you will definitely die after being brought back?”

“This has nothing to do with you.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

He slowly stood up and said, “Make preparations. When the time comes, I will cooperate with you and let you bring me back.”

Hearing this, Xia Hang sneered and said, “Qin Yu, with your current state, I’m afraid you are not my match. If I want to bring you back, why wait for you to give me a chance?”

As he spoke, a strong killing intent burst out from Xia Hang’s body.

Qin Yu turned around and glanced at Xia Hang. He did not hide anything and nodded, “That’s right. In my current state, you can indeed take me back at any time.”

“Now, the choice is in your hands.”

Qin Yu sat on the sofa and looked at Xia Hang quietly.

Their eyes met, and for a moment, the atmosphere froze. After a long time, neither of them says a single word.

“Alright, I give in.”

Finally, Xia Hang shook his head.

He withdrew the murderous aura from his body and sat next to Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you really put in a lot of effort. Is there any meaning to it? What do you want? Just for a woman?” Xia Hang lit a cigarette.

Qin Yu said, “You are someone who grew up in the upper class. Of course, you wouldn’t understand.”

“You also wouldn’t understand how warm the beam of light, that shot into your life when it was dark, felt.”

Xia Hang took a puff of his cigarette and slowly said, “Qin Yu, haven’t you ever thought that if I really captured you today, everything that you worked so hard for would be for naught?”

Qin Yu glanced at Xia hang and said, “Of course, I know, but you are an indispensable part of my plan.”

“If you didn’t catch me today, I would be able to truly trust you.”

At this point, Xia Hang asked with some confusion, “If I caught you, you would be dead.”

“It wasn’t easy to escape from the Martial Saint Weapon, why do you still want to go back?”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “If I didn’t get caught, they would definitely think of a way to torture Yan Ruoxue and force me to show myself.”

“So, it’s only a matter of time before I get caught.”

“Rather than being caught like this, it’s better for you to catch me.”

“As for whether I will die... it still depends on whether my next plan can succeed.”

Xia Hang heard this and sighed slightly, “You are meticulous and brave. Maybe you can really succeed.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He stood up with difficulty and turned around to leave.

After leaving Xia Hang’s house, Qin Yu didn’t go back. Instead, he prepared to head to another place.

This place was a residence near the military district of Jingdu.

One kilometer away from the military district of Jingdu, there was a small two-story building that was neither too big nor too small. This was also the only private house within a radius of several miles.

The person who lived here was none other than Ye Qing, the god of war in the Military District!

It was already late at night, and the surroundings were completely silent. The lights of this two-level building had been turned off long ago.

Unlike the higher-ups of the Military District, not only did Ye Qing not live in the Military District, but his residence was also not guarded.

The reason was that Ye Qing did not need anyone to protect him.

At this moment, Qin Yu was leaning against the wall, standing at the door without saying a word, as if he was waiting for something.

Upstairs, Ye Qing, who had fallen asleep, suddenly opened his eyes at this moment.

“Someone has arrived.” Ye Qing narrowed his eyes. He took the opportunity to grab his coat and jumped down.

“Commander Ye...” Seeing Ye Qing, Qin Yu forcefully supported his body and cupped his hands.

“Qin Yu?” Seeing Qin Yu in front of him, Ye Qing’s face couldn’t help but turn cold.

“Qin Yu, how dare you! You still dare to come and find me!” Ye Qing strode forward, an imposing aura suddenly exuded from his body.
