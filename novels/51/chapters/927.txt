Chapter 928: Chapter 928, the spiritual artifact of the Second Secret Realm! 

Qin Yu smacked his head.

As expected, it was no different from what he had guessed.

Gu Xinghe would never distribute the large spiritual stone mine equally.

“F * ck you! If you don’t like it, then let’s Fight!”Someone stood out.

“Let’s fight, who’s Afraid of Who!”

Those Martial Saints kept silent and quietly watched the changes in the scene.

Everyone knew in their hearts that the ones who could decide the outcome were definitely not ordinary martial artists like them.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a loud explosion erupted from the horizon!

It was unknown who had activated the spell, but a fireball that was like the sun rose up from the sky and smashed towards the ground!

“You’re courting death!”

A lot of people stood up and shouted loudly. They pushed their hands into the air and faced this huge fireball!

Under the push of those hands, the fireball actually slowly retreated. In the end, it was pushed into the air and exploded!

“Come, you’d rather live standing than die kneeling!”Someone shouted and stepped forward!

A great battle instantly erupted between the two sides!

Qin Yu sat there without saying a word. His eyes were cold as he looked at those martial saints and Gu Xinghe, who was at the front.

“Tell me, why do you think their desires have become so great?”Gu Xinghe glanced at the long brows beside him and sighed slightly.

The long brows nodded and said, “That’s right. When Granny Qin was here, all the resources were in the hands of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. No one caused any trouble, but now...”

“It’s different.”Zhai Xing shook his head.

“Before this, it was because no one knew that the Jingdu martial arts association controlled so many resources.”

“Ever since Qu Xie was exposed, the credibility of the JINGDU martial arts association has been declining. Now, it can be considered to have completely exploded.”

Gu Xinghe sighed slightly. He slowly stood up and said with narrowed eyes, “I originally wanted to rely on fair negotiations to let us firmly control the dominant position. Now it seems... martial strength is still reliable.”

Before he finished speaking, Gu Xinghe reached out with his palm and took out a spiritual artifact.

This spiritual artifact looked like a short sword. It was pitch-black like a black hole and emitted an extremely terrifying internal Qi.

When Zhai Xing saw this spiritual artifact, his body tensed up!

“Young master Gu, you actually brought out the heavenly poison?”Zhai Xing said with a face full of fear.

“Heavenly poison? The Gu family’s Mountain Protection Magic Tool? !”Long Mei’s eyes widened.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “If anyone dares to go against my will today, I will kill them!”

With that, Gu Xinghe slowly activated the heavenly poison and looked at the crowd coldly.

As Gu Xinghe waved his hand, rays of black light suddenly burst out from the heavenly poison!

Wherever the light passed, the warrior’s body was instantly enveloped by the black flames and turned into ashes in the blink of an eye!

Not only that, even the rocks on the ground were burned to ashes in an instant!

In an instant, the entire venue wailed incessantly! Countless warriors had died under the sky poison!

Even a half-step martial saint would not be able to retaliate under the Sky Poison!

“Ah! !”

At this moment, Chang Mang’s arm was covered in black flames!

The soaring flames covered his entire arm in an instant and spread rapidly!

“Chang Mang!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! He did not care about anything else and immediately took out his bronze sword. With a swoosh, he slashed towards Chang Mang’s arm!

His arm was instantly cut off. The arm that was covered in black flames quickly turned into thick water and disappeared without a trace.

“How are you? Are You Alright?”Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Chang Mang.

Chang Mang glanced at his broken arm and said in a low voice, “Thank you. If you hadn’t acted in time, the Flames would have devoured my entire body.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He looked around, afraid that his identity would be exposed.

Fortunately, the scene was extremely chaotic and no one noticed him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Therefore, Qin Yu put away the bronze sword and thought to himself, “It’s all thanks to Chang Mang’s special physical body. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to save him in time.”

After Gu Xinghe made his move, the crowd became much calmer.

The battle also came to an end at this moment.

Gu Xinghe played with the heavenly poison in his hand and said coldly, “I don’t care which aristocratic family you’re from, which secret realm you’re from, and how you divide the resources, it’s up to me!”

“Why should I!”A warrior shouted indignantly.

Gu Xinghe glanced at him and immediately activated the heavenly poison to slash at him!

“Ah! !”

The warrior’s body was stained with black flames and instantly turned into ashes!

When the crowd saw this, they immediately sucked in a breath of cold air and their faces were filled with fear!

Qin Yu’s expression was also a little ugly.

He did not expect Gu Xinghe to actually take out such a top-notch magic tool!

“Who else is not convinced?”Gu Xinghe asked coldly.

The scene was silent. No one dared to say anything for a moment.

Just as Gu Xinghe was about to make a decision, Xu Huaigu stood up.

He looked at Gu Xinghe calmly and said quietly, “I don’t think anyone will agree to your proposal.”

“Xu Huaigu...”Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes.

“Why? Aren’t you afraid of Death?”

Xu Huaigu said calmly, “No one isn’t afraid of death, but to me, there is something more important than life and death.”

“Something more important? Is it protecting these ants?”Gu Xinghe sneered.

“What do you think you can change by yourself?”

Xu Huaigu sighed slightly and said, “I can not change much, but I believe that as long as I resist, there will be people who will continue to resist until they succeed.”

Hearing these words, Gu Xinghe was instantly furious!

For the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, what they were afraid of was someone resisting!

He looked coldly at Xu Huaigu and said, “Spiky... Alright, since you want to die, then I’ll Satisfy You!”

With that, Gu Xinghe grabbed the heavenly poison.

“Senior Xu!”Seeing this scene, Qin Yu’s expression immediately became extremely ugly!

Before Qin Yu could release the two corpses, Gu Xinghe had already activated the heavenly poison and slashed towards Xu Huaigu!

The black flame was heading straight for Xu Huaigu!

Xu Huaigu’s expression was still calm. He stretched out one of his palms and grabbed towards the black flame!

However, this black flame was extremely strange and instantly stained both of his hands!

“Senior Xu!”Seeing this, everyone could not help but shout out in shock!

Xu Huaigu looked at his own palm and saw that his arm shook and actually shattered his palm and the flame!

“Eh?”Gu Xinghe frowned slightly.

Before he could be shocked, Xu Huaigu’s other hand had already reached out and was heading straight for Gu Xinghe!

When Gu Xinghe saw this, his expression immediately changed!

He anxiously shouted, “Star Seizer, star Seizer!”

“Boom!”

Star Seizer instantly attacked and collided with Xu Huaigu’s palm!

A terrifying pressure spread out. Some people could not even withstand this pressure and directly vomited blood!

Star Seizer was a top-notch martial saint. Even Xu Huaigu would find it difficult to resist.

This collision caused Xu Huaigu to take a few steps back.

It was obvious who was stronger and who was weaker.

“Star, kill him for me!”Gu Xinghe opened his eyes wide, Crazy Roar!
