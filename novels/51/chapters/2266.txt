2267 The Divine Command of Execution

A tremendously strange feeling spread to Qin Yu’s heart. That place seemed to have a strong summon that his body could not resist and went over involuntarily.

“Perhaps this Ghost Mansion has something to do with the Soul Torment Mind Technique I cultivated?”

Qin Yu frowned as he pondered. He was a little hesitant now.

Although the man with the mustache was usually reliable, his background was very mysterious. His judgments on many things he mentioned were very accurate. As this was the first time he had earnestly cautioned Qin Yu, he could not help but contemplate the seriousness of it.

While he was thinking, the ghostly qi erupted into the sky again. The rules of heaven and earth seemed to have changed vaguely. Even the naked eye could vaguely see the traces of ghostly qi. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

And that feeling was actually growing stronger.

Just like an addiction, it was impossible to shake off.

After hesitating for a while, Qin Yu decided to head to the seventh level of purgatory.

With this feeling of summon, this Ghost Mansion must have some connection with him or the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

Although he had temporarily suppressed the black Qin Yu, it was still a hidden danger.

To find the answer, he had to explore it himself.

“Now, I’ll deal with you first!”

Qin Yu revealed a sinister smile and looked at Zong Yue.

As long as he killed him and searched his divine sense, he could naturally find a way to break the God-slaying Parasite.

“You dare!”

Zong Yue’s expression changed drastically.

Qin Yu remained unfazed. With a slight clap of his hand, the surging force in the void suppressed Zong Yue to the ground, unable to move.

He stepped on Zong Yue’s back and tried to search his soul forcefully.

However, a strong sword shadow appeared on his back at this moment. There was a vague sense of familiarity with the sword intent.

A middle-aged man holding an ancient token appeared in front of everyone. His expression was cold, and his internal qi was incomparably powerful.

“The Divine Command of Execution?”

As soon as that internal qi appeared, everyone’s expression changed drastically.

“The Divine Command of Execution? What is that?”

Qin Yu frowned.

“Qin Yu, the Divine Command of Execution is a command issued by the Evil Extermination Sect. After seeing it, one must follow the order of the person holding the token. Otherwise, the Evil Extermination Sect will hunt down those who don’t listen to the order.”

Elder Guai’s voice came from the Sumeru ring.

“Usually, the Divine Command of Execution is only issued when there is a huge threat to the human cultivators. Previously, a tremendously ferocious divine beast from the demon race emerged. That divine beast razed thousands of cities, and all the cultivators were helpless against it. In the end, the Divine Command of Execution was issued, and the strongest cultivators in this galaxy gathered to kill this divine beast.”

The Divine Command of Execution this time should be related to the seventh level of purgatory. Otherwise, it would not be so coincidental.

Could it be that this Ghost Mansion posed a significant threat to cultivators?

“Everyone, go to the seventh level of purgatory immediately.”

The middle-aged man said with a cold expression. His voice spread throughout the Blue Horizon Continent, revealing his profound expertise.

Zong Yue was overjoyed. He shouted at the middle-aged man, “Help! He’s not letting go of me yet!”

“I’ve said it. Go to the seventh level of the purgatory immediately. Otherwise, you’ll have to bear the consequences.”

The middle-aged man looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Whoosh!”

Amidst the sound of breaking through the air, the people of the Mysterious Dark Sect set out one after another.

Wu Feng, Shui Yuan, and the others glanced at the middle-aged man before swiftly breaking through the air, departing.

“Release the God-slaying Parasite, and I’ll let you go.”

Qin Yu grabbed Zong Yue’s neck like a little chick.

“Are you taking the Divine Command of Execution as a joke?”

The middle-aged man’s expression turned cold.

“He planted the God-slaying Parasite in my divine sense. If he doesn’t undo it, I definitely won’t let him off. Otherwise, how do I go to the seventh level of purgatory if I die?”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“Look, he did not take the Divine Command of Execution seriously. Quickly kill him!”

Zong Yue was delighted and hurriedly shouted at the middle-aged man.

“I don’t care what reason you have. Release him now and head to the seventh level immediately!”

The middle-aged man shouted coldly. He had placed his hand on the sword on his waist.

“Are your d*mn ears not working? He’s threatening me now, not the other way around!”

Qin Yu was furious. Was this person retarded?

He had expressed his willingness to let Zong Yue go. But if he let Zong Yue go like this, the God-slaying Parasite would remain in his sea of consciousness and would become a big problem for him.

“Presumptuous!”

With a crisp unsheathing sound, a blazingly bright sword light slashed horizontally.

Qin Yu suddenly clamped down on the sword light with two nimble fingers.

With a little force, the sword energy abruptly shattered.

“You actually dare to retaliate!”

The middle-aged man revealed a trace of anger on his face.

With the Divine Command of Execution in his hand, his body suddenly soared into the sky and stopped at a height of tens of thousands of feet.

A shadow suddenly appeared, emitting a powerful sword intent in the air.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. Even though he was far away, he could still feel the suffocating sword energy.

“Evil exterminator.”

The Divine Command of Execution actually contained a trace of the evil exterminator’s divine thought. Otherwise, this sword intent would not be so terrifying.

The middle-aged man suddenly crushed the Divine Command of Execution in his hand. In the next moment, the sword aurora slashed down.

The heaven and earth suddenly darkened as if the sword energy had suppressed the light in the sky.

“Although your sword intent is strong, your cultivation is too weak.”

Qin Yu shook his head and closed his eyes.

A golden divine light flashed, and a unicorn appeared in the void, clashing fiercely with the sword intent.

The unicorn almost instantly crushed the sword intent, and the shadow in the air suddenly disappeared.

“Fine, fine, you actually dare to fight back. Once this matter settles, my Evil Extermination Sect will definitely visit you to demand an explanation.”

The middle-aged man was furious.

“Are you f*cking sick?”

Qin Yu was utterly flustered and exasperated. If it was not out of the fear of the evil exterminator, he really wanted to slash this idiot to death with a saber.

Suddenly, an incomparably intense spiritual energy fluctuation appeared in the void. The massive spiritual energy fluctuation even shook the space.

A black crack suddenly appeared, and a strange fluctuation of rules emitted from the pitch-black void.

The evil exterminator’s shadow suddenly appeared in the sky above the Blue Horizon Continent, and that figure stared at Qin Yu.

“Those who violate the Divine Command of Execution shall be executed!”

The divine sword in the phantom’s hand pointed into the air in the distance, and a sword intent that was a hundred times more terrifying locked onto Qin Yu.

“Projection of Rules!”

Qin Yu gasped. It was a complex set of spatial rules. He had seen this ability in his father’s memories.

The person who projected this had almost the strength of his true body. In other words, he was facing the evil exterminator himself. No wonder no one on this continent dared to disobey the Divine Command of Execution. There was a reason for this.

No, it would not work. It would undoubtedly lead to a fierce battle if he went against the intentions of the caster of the Projection of Rules. Engaging in a battle with Evil Extermination Sect here would inevitably affect the upcoming journey to the Mystic Realm.

Qin Yu directly kicked and sent Zong Yue flying and left a restriction in his divine sense. He then rushed to the seventh level of purgatory.
