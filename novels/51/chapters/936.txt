Chapter 937: Chapter 937, demon saint 

Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache vigilantly scanned their surroundings with traces of panic on their faces.

Although these people were all at the half-step martial saint realm, they had the body of a Demon Beast!

Their strength was far above that of humans!

“Kill him!”

At this moment, someone gave an order.

“SWISH SWISH SWISH!”

In an instant, several rays of light shot out! They headed straight for Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache!

The great battle erupted in an instant. Qin Yu held the Golden Light in his hand and fought with all his might. Each of his punches contained a force of ten thousand tons!

The two of them faced more than ten demonic beasts at the half-step martial saint realm. For a moment, it was difficult to determine the victor.

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu raised his head and let out an angry roar. He held the absolute beginning holy fist in his hand. The golden light burst out and smashed fiercely toward a demonic beast.

The collision of the two fists was like the Moon hitting the earth. It exploded with an extremely terrifying sound!

What shocked Qin Yu was that the demonic beast was only forced back, but it wasn’t injured at all!

“As expected of the body of a demonic beast...”Qin Yu murmured. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Any one of them here was probably not weaker than little black!

Qin Yu subconsciously glanced at the mustache. He was surprised to find that the mustache wasn’t at a disadvantage when facing several demonic beasts. It was even steadily suppressing one of them!

“This kid...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

Just as Qin Yu was in a daze, another Demon Beast stepped forward!

His body trembled, and a feather that looked like a dagger actually grew out of his body!

This feather was incomparably sharp, shooting towards Qin Yu from all directions!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. With a furious roar, he unleashed his Golden Fist to the extreme, and a powerful internal Qi burst out from his body!

The endless feathers landed on Qin Yu’s body, scraping out white spots one after another on Qin Yu’s body!

This time, it was the Demonic Beasts’turn to be shocked.

They sized up Qin Yu, as if they were shocked by Qin Yu’s body.

“Boom!”

The number of demonic beasts continued to increase. Qin Yu and the moustache were engaged in a bloody battle, and traces of injuries appeared on his body.

However, the demonic beasts were even more miserable. Many of their bodies had been destroyed, and their bodies were slowly recovering in the distance.

In the blink of an eye, the battle between the two sides had already lasted for three hours!

During these three hours, the losses of the demonic beasts were getting more and more serious.

They did not seem to have expected that the two humans in front of them were actually so powerful!

“No, if this continues, we will definitely die of exhaustion,”the mustached man said in a low voice.

Qin Yu was also slightly panting. Just as the mustached man had said, their numbers were too large! If they continued fighting like this, they would most likely die!

“Let’s go all out.”At this moment, Qin Yu gritted his teeth and prepared to use his trump card.

However, at this moment, the many demonic beasts suddenly looked in a certain direction in unison.

They saw a young man slowly walking over from afar.

He had a slender figure, a head of white hair, and wore a long white robe. His eyes were extremely long and narrow.

Most importantly, the oppressive feeling from his body made it hard for people to breathe!

“Greetings, Lord Immortal Crane!”Upon seeing this young man, everyone shouted in unison.

“Immortal Crane?”

Upon hearing this address, the mustached man couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Why? is his background very big?”Qin Yu asked.

The mustached man gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “I’m afraid it’s more troublesome than we imagined.”

He stared at the man who was called Immortal Crane not far away and said in a low voice, “Immortal crane is a genuine heaven rank demonic beast, and this person has clearly stepped into the martial saint realm.”

“A heaven rank demonic beast who has stepped into the martial saint realm... It’s extremely terrifying!”

As he spoke, the crane had already walked over.

He looked down at Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache from above. Not a trace of emotion could be seen on his ice-cold face.

The handlebar mustache clenched his teeth and bowed as he said, “Greetings, Lord Crane. We are only lost here and have no intention of offending you. Please forgive us, Lord Crane. We will leave immediately.”

However, the crane did not say a word.

It slowly raised its hand and lightly slapped towards the mustached man!

That extremely fast speed even left afterimages in the air!

The moment his hand shook, an extremely terrifying internal Qi gathered in his palm.

“Pa!”

A crisp sound could be heard!

This extremely tender palm slapped onto the mustached man’s forehead!

The mustached man’s body swayed slightly, and then with a bang, he fell to the ground and lost consciousness.

“Mustached man!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu was instantly unable to contain his anger!

“What did you do to the mustached man? !”Qin Yu Glared angrily at the immortal crane, and there wasn’t the slightest trace of fear in his eyes!

The Immortal Crane didn’t reply, and only used the same trick again. That tender palm gently moved towards Qin Yu’s forehead!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu’s body suddenly flashed and retreated dozens of meters away!

The immortal crane frowned slightly, and a trace of surprise flashed in its eyes.

“The mustache has already said that we did not mean to offend you at all. We just accidentally stepped into your territory. Why do you have to force us so bitterly!”Qin Yu said coldly.

“How dare you! How dare you talk to Lord Immortal Crane Like That!”Someone beside them shouted loudly.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said coldly, “He is your Lord, not mine! You Want to kill me, right? I will not sit still and wait for death. So what if you are a martial saint!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s internal Qi exploded to the extreme!

That resplendent golden light was like the sun, making people unable to open their eyes!

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu was the first to make a move. He raised his hand and used his trump card to break ten thousand techniques with a single punch!

All the golden light gathered on his right fist and exploded in an instant!

The Immortal Crane’s expression was calm. He raised his palm and lightly welcomed the attack!

“Boom!”

An earth-shattering sound shook the entire city!

Dust was stirred up and shattered rocks were sent flying. The power of this punch shocked everyone!

Qin Yu’s fist collided with the Immortal Crane’s palm.

After the dust fell, traces of blood actually flowed out of the Immortal Crane’s Crystal Clear Palm!

His eyes were filled with astonishment, as if he did not believe that this young man in front of him could injure him!

“Lord Immortal Crane was actually injured!”

“How is this possible! Lord Immortal Crane is a martial saint, how could he be injured by a half-step martial saint! ?”

Qin Yu was panting heavily not far away, but his heart was filled with despair.

This was his strongest punch, but it only injured Xianhe’s flesh!

More importantly, this punch had almost exhausted all of his physical strength.

Xianhe, who was not far away, shook the blood from his palm. Then, he walked towards Qin Yu step by step.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. At this critical moment, he could only use all of his trump cards!

In an instant, a mark flashed between Qin Yu’s brows.

This mark was the power of the Divine Dragon!

And the moment the power of the Divine Dragon appeared, all the demonic beasts present had terrified expressions, as if they were facing a great enemy!
