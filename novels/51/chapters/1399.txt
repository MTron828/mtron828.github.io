Chapter 1400: Chapter 1,400: drinking the water of Life 1

Qin Yu thought about it carefully. This Brother Dao did seem a little strange.

He had spent so much effort to find the water of life, but he had given it to Qin Yu so easily.

One had to know that the water of life was extremely precious. In the entire holy region, it was a top-tier treasure. No matter how close he was with sister Lin, he shouldn’t have given the water of life to him so easily.

“How Strange.”The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more he felt that something was amiss.

But soon, he couldn’t be bothered to think about it anymore. In any case, the water of life was already in his hands. The key was to quickly raise his strength.

Thus, Qin Yu took out the jade bottle and prepared to consume the water of life.

At this moment, Qin Yu was surprised to discover that the jade bottle was actually an extraordinary treasure. There were traces of spiritual energy and an ancient aura swimming around the mouth of the bottle.

“It’s actually a treasure? and... It’s given to me?”Qin Yu widened his eyes.

At this moment, Qin Yu began to believe tie Dan’s words.

This brother Dao was probably not simple!

...

On a desolate desert in the southern province.

A figure was speeding at an extremely fast speed. He would appear at times and disappear into space at other times.

He did not know how long he had been speeding for before he finally stopped in an empty space.

The moment he stopped, a figure dressed in a black robe suddenly appeared from the empty space.

“How is it? is everything done?”The black-robed man asked coldly.

“Yes, it’s done. He has already obtained the water of life, and he was the one who dealt with the hand of death,”the man said. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This man was none other than Brother Dao!

“Alright, since it’s done, we should go back and report,”the black-robed man said.

The two of them did not say anything more. With a shake of their palms, their figures slowly disappeared.

...

Qin Yu poured the water of life in the jade bottle into his stomach and began to slowly absorb it.

At this moment, Qin Yu was extremely nervous and excited, because he did not know whether the water of life could allow him to fully recover his spiritual power, or rather, how many numbers could be added to his forehead.

“I hope this water of life is enough to support me to recover my spiritual power.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He didn’t think anymore. He closed his eyes slightly and began to slowly cultivate.

As the water of life entered Qin Yu’s body, the liquid slowly turned into gas and flowed around his body.

Just as Brother Dao said, although this water of life looked small, it was actually an extremely large amount.

The drops of water of life exploded in his abdomen like a small bomb.

His aura was slowly flowing through his body, recovering his aura.

On the other side, the heavenly cloud sect’s actions were getting bigger and bigger.

They arrested all the people related to Qin Yu and threw them into the heavenly prison.

In the Elder’s mansion, the first Elder was reporting this to the sect master.

“Have you found out everything? Are you sure it has something to do with Di Zun?”The sect master frowned.

The first elder nodded and said, “Yes, although this child belongs to our Heavenly Cloud Sect, his mind is still on Qin Yu!”

The sect master was silent. No one knew what he was thinking.

After a moment, the sect master said in a deep voice, “This at least shows that Di Zun is still a person who values relationships.”

The Great Elder was stunned. He never thought that the sect master would say such a thing.

How much did the sect master like Di Zun? Even at this time, he was still trying to excuse him?

“Sect master, I’m afraid that this kid stayed in the Heavenly Cloud sect to learn our spells!”The Great Elder said hurriedly.

The sect master smiled and said, “With his talent, no matter where he goes, the sect will want him, even if it’s the Central Plains.”

A trace of coldness flashed across the first elder’s face, and then he said coldly, “Since he can’t serve us, then we have to kill him!”

The sect master waved his hand and said, “No need. After we kill Qin Yu, Di Zun will naturally have to serve us.”

“But... but aren’t you afraid that I will take revenge for Qin Yu?”The first elder frowned tightly.

The sect master said faintly, “As a sect, if it doesn’t even have the ability to make people pledge their loyalty, then the sect is not far from disappearing.”

Hearing the sect master’s words, the great elder understood that no matter what, the sect master had to protect this Di Zun today.

Therefore, the great elder no longer insisted on his own opinion. Instead, he asked, “Sect master, then what should we do now?”

“Let’s put him in the sky prison first.”The sect master waved his hand and said.

“Yes.”Seeing this, the great elder no longer insisted.

...

Gu City, in a small teahouse next to the auction.

Ding Yi looked out of the window, as if he was waiting for something.

“What? Still Waiting?”At this time, sister Lin walked in from outside.

Ding Yi grunted and said, “Sister Lin, I believe that he will definitely come back.”

Sister Lin sighed and said, “He is not Qin Yu. This is all your wishful thinking. What’s more, even if he really is Qin Yu, so what?”

Ding Yi smiled and said, “I just want to follow him. As for the other things, I have never thought about it.”

Seeing this, sister Lin sighed and said, “I’ll say it again. He is not Qin Yu. He really is not. Little Sister, you should hurry back.”

Ding Yi was extremely stubborn and just sat there.

This was already the fifth day she had been sitting here, and she still had no intention of leaving.

At this moment, three old men in long robes suddenly appeared outside.

These three people stood in front of sister Lin with cold smiles on their faces.

Sister Lin frowned slightly and said, “Who are you people? What’s the matter?”

“You are sister Lin from the GU city auction, right?”One of them asked coldly.

“We are from the Heavenly Cloud sect. We want to take you back to understand something.”

Sister Lin’s heart thumped. She suddenly realized something, but her face remained calm.

“Can you tell me why you want to take me back?”Sister Lin asked with a smile.

“Why? We are all sensible people. I think there is no need to pretend to be stupid,”one of the hemp-robed elders said indifferently.

“Sorry, I don’t understand.”Sister Lin still shook her head.

Seeing this, the hemp-robed elder immediately snorted and said, “You sent Qin Yu to an Fenglou and secretly hid the prisoners of the heavenly cloud sect. Do you know what kind of crime this is?”
