Following the direction Xue Hu pointed to, Qin Yu saw a tall and straight middle-aged man with burning eyes.

There was no expression on his face, but he was imposing, making people dare not to look at him directly.

“He is Ye Qing?” Qin Yu whispered.

Qin Yu tried to feel his strength, but found that Ye Qing was like an ancient well that couldn’t be seen through at all.

Ye Qing’s arrival undoubtedly brought things to a climax.

Many people stepped forward one after another and greeted Ye Qing.

Ye Qing nodded to them one by one and then sat there quietly.

“Ye Qing is the role model of all martial artists,” Xue Hu muttered in a low voice while looking at Ye Qing with respect.

It had to be said that Ye Qing’s temperament was indeed extraordinary, and he made people feel a sense of worship for him.

With Ye Qing’s arrival, this competition officially began.

Dozens of cannons shot into the sky, followed by the speeches from officers.

During this period, Ye Qing had been sitting there without saying a word.

“An event has been temporary added to this competition,” the host said.

“In addition to the 18 team members participating in the competition, this time, the head coach will also participate in the competition. The final result will be determined by the jury.”

Updates by

There was an uproar!

The temporary addition of this event caught many people off guard.

Because there were many head coaches who were experienced in training, but they didn’t have strong strength themselves.

Once they entered the competition, the outcome would be terrible.

“Mr. Long, your head coach is in trouble,” Mr. Sun said with a smile

Commander Long snorted and said, “Qin Yu is a famous genius in Chuzhou. His achievements will shock you to death.”

Hearing that, Mr. Sun immediately laughed and said, “Chuzhou is a pea-sized place. What kind of talent can there be? I’d like to hear what achievements he has. Let’s see if he can shock me to death.”

Commander Long said with a cold expression, “Gu Taichu of the Jiang Bei region was defeated by Qin Yu. Gu Taichu is a fifth level Inner Strength Grandmaster!”

Hearing this, Mr. Sun couldn’t help but shake his head and laugh. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“You should brag more convincingly. An Inner Strength Master Hands defeated a fifth level Inner Strength Grandmaster? Do you think it’s possible? Even Mr. Ye couldn’t do it back then.” Mr. Sun sneered.

Commander Long snorted and didn’t say anything else.

He had only heard rumors about Qin Yu’s battle results, so Commander Long didn’t have much confidence in it.

“The competition has now officially started. The first round will be the Chuzhou region against the Central Plains region!” The host shouted.

Deafening music immediately sounded in the stadium. Along with the sound of the music, the people from the Central Plains region slowly arrived at the center of the training ground.

Qin Yu swept his gaze across the crowd and shouted, “Listen up, our enemy is not the central plains region’s military district, but all military districts!”

“And we only have one goal, and that is to be number one! Even if we face the military district of Jingdu, you have to go all out and defeat them!”

Hearing this, Xue Hu hurriedly pulled Qin Yu’s arm and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, didn’t Commander Long say that our goal is number two? We can’t compete with the military district of Jingdu!”

Qin Yu glanced at Xue Hu and said, “Since I’m the one leading the team, then I’ll have the final say.”

“You just said that no one will remember number two.”

After saying this, Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Everyone, listen up. We can only win. We can’t lose!”

“Yes!” The eighteen members of the Longhu team immediately raised their heads and shouted!

Amidst the waves of music, the Longhu team arrived at the center of the training ground in unison.

As for Lu Chen, he walked to Qin Yu’s side.

“I really envy you guys,” Lu Chen said indifferently.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What do you envy us for?”

Lu Chen smiled and said, “I envy you guys that you can go home soon, and I still have to stay here. Sigh.”

“You want to go home so much? I’ll send you home later,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Lu Chen snorted lightly. “With just their ability? You don’t have the ability, do you?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He was displeased with Lu Chen’s words.

As he was speaking, the match began!

The battle began at that moment! Both sides began to fight on the training ground!

“Bang!”

The members of the Longhu team seemed to have been injected with stimulants. They were all brave and mighty, and they practically took out one rival with every punch!

The Central Plains’ Military District suffered a crushing defeat!

In just five minutes, everyone in the Central Plains’ Military District fell to the ground and couldn’t get up anymore!

On the other hand, almost no one in the Longhu team was injured!

When he saw this scene, Lu Chen’s expression was extremely ugly!

“How is this possible?!” Lu Chen stared fixedly at the stage.

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “It seems that we have won.”

Lu Chen gnashed his teeth and looked at Qin Yu. He said coldly, “You have quite some ability, but it’s useless. I’ll get payback!”

“Really? I’ll wait and see,” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

Lu Chen snorted coldly and turned to leave.

The eighteen people from the Central Plains’ Military District walked off the stage dejectedly.

Lu Chen stood among them and cursed!

“Mr. Sun, I’ll give you the last place this time. Don’t stand on ceremony,” Commander Long said with a smile.

Mr. Sun said with a cold expression, “Don’t get too cocky. It’s not over yet.”

The other military districts also started to discuss in low voices.

“The Chuzhou region seems to be different from before this time.”

“I heard that there’s a new head coach.”

“The battle ended in five minutes. Such efficiency is amazing.”

In the stands, Ye Qing still had his eyes closed, as if he didn’t care about the Chuzhou region’s results.

“The Chuzhou region won by a landslide. Next, the two head coaches will participate!” The host shouted from the stage!

“Let’s welcome the two head coaches!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Chen jumped onto the training ground and beckoned Qin Yu with his finger.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, slowly walked over.

“I will win in five minutes and level the score,” Lu Chen said coldly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I will beat you down in three minutes and advance to the last round!”

“How cocky. I’ll see how long you can keep talking like that!” Lu Chen roared, and the qi energy of a second level Inner Strength Past Master instantly burst out!

“So you’re just a second level Inner Strength Past Master. It seems that I’ve overestimated you.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Facing Lu Chen’s weak qi energy, Qin Yu looked extremely calm.

“It seems that you have given up. Very well, I will send you home as soon as possible!” Lu Chen roared, and the qi energy all over his body burst out before shooting toward Qin Yu like an arrow leaving a bow!

His entire body was wrapped by a thick qi energy, and it even formed a whirlwind around him!

On the other hand, Qin Yu only raised his fist and clenched it, then went up to confront him head-on.
