After returning to the Xue family, the people of the Xue family were eagerly waiting for Qin Yu.

Seeing that Qin Yu had returned, they all rushed up.

“Qin Yu, how is it?” Xue Yuzhi asked first.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “The Purple Flame Sect is gone.”

After saying that, Qin Yu went straight back to his room.

Xue Yujie hesitated for half a second, then hurriedly looked at the people around him and said, “Quick, go to the Purple Flame Sect and check out the situation!”

“Yes!”

Half an hour later, this follower returned to the Xue family.

“How is the Purple Flame Sect now?” Xue Yujie hurriedly asked.

That follower said in a trembling voice, “The Purple Flame Sect... more than a hundred people of the Purple Flame Sect, all... all died...”

The few people present couldn’t help but gasp when they heard this.

Qin Yu... actually killed all of them?

“Killing only the sect master was clearly enough, but he... he actually massacred the entire sect...” Xue Yujie muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, the members of the Xue family began to feel a little afraid.

For the next few days, Qin Yu didn’t leave the main door.

“Are we just going to hide in the house every day?” The mustached man couldn’t help but mutter.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Don’t worry, let the bullets fly for a while.”

Qin Yu was waiting for the news to spread.

When the news of the destruction of the Purple Flame Sect spread throughout the entire Sheng Kingdom, Qin Yu could take action.

In the Sheng Kingdom, there were dozens of forces, big and small.

Among them, the powerful ones had many Martial Marquises, such as the Purple Flame Sect

And the weak ones also had Martial Marquises.

As long as they unified all the forces, then the Xue family would no longer have any risks, and Qin Yu would also have the capital to fight against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the various aristocratic families!

At night.

On Qin Yu’s bed, there were beads placed one after another.

These beads were precisely Golden Cores.

Qin Yu counted, and there were a total of forty-one beads.

“Forty-one Golden Cores, this is valuable wealth.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little excited.

The killing intent in Qin Yu’s heart grew stronger and stronger.

He even had the idea of killing everyone and taking out their Golden Cores for his own cultivation many times.

Fortunately, this idea was eventually suppressed by Qin Yu’s rational thoughts.

Three days later.

The news of the destruction of the Purple Flame Sect had spread throughout the entire Sheng Kingdom.

“The Purple Flame Sect has been destroyed, and more than a hundred people from the sect have actually died.”

“The Purple Flame Sect haf over twenty Martial Marquises. How could they be annihilated just like that?”

“Not only that, but the Purple Flame Sect also has a Martial Saint weapon! It’s said that the Martial Saint weapon was shattered with a single punch.”

“What kind of strength and how vicious is this? He actually massacred their entire sect...”

Just as everyone was discussing animatedly, a piece of news spread out.

“All the forces in Sheng Kingdom, I’ll give you three days to submit to me. I’ll wait for you at the Xue family. Otherwise, I’ll slaughter a sect every other day!”

Once this news was sent out, all the forces couldn’t help but be frightened!

Slaughter a sect every other day? This was a bit too arrogant!

In the hall of the Xue family.

Xue Yujie said with some fear, “Qin Yu, aren’t you going a bit too far... by doing this?”

“Yes, Qin Yu. If they unite to deal with you, you...”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “No worries.”

“If they really don’t come forward to submit, will you really slaughter their entire sect?” Xue Yujie asked tentatively.

Qin Yu didn’t think and nodded, “Mr. Xue, do you think I’m joking?”

These words made Xue Yujie shiver.

After Qin Yu left, Xue Yujie stood up and said, “Qin Yu is too vicious! I’m really afraid that he will destroy the Xue family too!”

“He won’t...” Xue Yuzhi shook her head.

“Qin Yu’s actions are also for the sake of the Xue family...”

Xue Yujie opened his mouth, but he had nothing to say.

He sighed slightly, and his eyes were filled with worry.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Early in the morning, Qin Yu had been waiting in the square of the Xue family.

Qin Yu had been waiting from eight o’clock in the morning to twelve o’clock in the afternoon.

However, not a single faction came.

A trace of coldness flashed through Qin Yu’s eyes, and he said in a low voice, “It seems that they think I’m joking...”

After saying this, Qin Yu’s figure suddenly disappeared.

At three o’clock in the afternoon, Qin Yu returned to the Xue family.

He was covered in blood and had a few more Golden Cores in his hands.

In the evening, the Sheng Kingdom sent out news: The Sky Harmony League was destroyed and dozens of people died tragically!

This couldn’t help but make all the forces start to fear!

The Sky Harmony League was also a powerful sect! However, it was destroyed in the blink of an eye!

Everyone started to panic.

They realized that Qin Yu wasn’t joking at all. He was really going to wipe out the entire sect!

“How about... we submit to him.”

“Even the Martial Saint weapon couldn’t do anything to him, let alone us.”

“To destroy the Martial Saint weapon with one punch, we don’t seem to have any other choice in front of such strength...”

All the major forces made their decisions one after another.

The next morning.

Qin Yu was still sleeping when someone knocked on the door.

The moment the door opened, he saw Xue Yuzhi standing at the door.

“Auntie Xue, what’s wrong?” Qin Yu rubbed his sleepy eyes.

Xue Yuzhi smiled bitterly and said, “The Sect Masters of the major sects are waiting for you in the hall...”

Qin Yu was immediately energized when he heard that.

He sneered and said, “Are all of them here?”

“More or less.” Xue Yuzhi smiled bitterly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, I got it.”

After returning to his room and briefly tidying up, Qin Yu walked toward the hall of the Xue family.

At this moment, this huge hall was already filled with people.

The moment Qin Yu stepped into the hall, his internal qi was released.

That powerful pressure made everyone tense up!

Qin Yu walked straight to the main seat and sat down.

He swept his gaze across the crowd and found that there were at least dozens of people present!

This meant that dozens of forces, big and small, of Sheng Kingdom were all present!

Qin Yu’s cold eyes swept across everyone present.

Everywhere he looked, people were trembling.

After a long time, Qin Yu finally opened his mouth.

He swept his eyes over everyone and said indifferently, “From today onwards, Sheng Kingdom won’t have various sects. All of you will belong to the same sect.”

“This sect will be called Heaven Gate.”

“Heaven Gate?” Everyone looked at each other.

Qin Yu said coldly, “As for your sects, from today onwards, it will be renamed Heaven Gate. Do you understand?”

Everyone was silent for a moment before someone stood up and said, “Greetings, Sect Master Qin.”

The moment these words were said, everyone shouted in unison, “Greetings, Sect Master Qin!”

From then on, the Heaven Gate was established!
