Chapter 1352: Chapter 1,352, Young Generation 1 of the South Province 

Qin Yu looked at the young man and saw that he had a smile on his face. It was like a spring breeze that made people feel comfortable.

“You are Qin Yu? The person who killed Ling Yun?”The others were also shocked when they heard this.

Li Yingying looked at Qin Yu in astonishment as if she wanted to see through Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded at him as a form of greeting.

These people seemed to be filled with curiosity towards Qin Yu, and one after another, they invited Qin Yu to take a seat.

The two Wen brothers, who had already been neglected, were instantly seething with anger, but they still sat to the side.

“I’ve long heard of Brother Qin’s great name. Today, I finally got to meet you,”said the youth.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “This fellow brother is joking.”

After some small talk, they learned that this young man’s name was Zhuo Jing. He could be considered a well-known person in the region.

Not only that, he also knew Ling Yun. He had even been compared with Ling Yun back then. This was enough to prove his talent.

“Brother Qin, we know quite a bit about Ling Yun’s strength. How did you kill him with two punches?”Zhuo Jing asked in puzzlement.

“That’s right. There aren’t many people in the younger generation in the entire south province who can compare to Ling Yun’s abilities. However, from what I can see, Brother Qin’s realm... doesn’t seem to have any spiritual energy fluctuations,”Li Yingying said with a frown.

Qin Yu knew that it was difficult to hide this matter anymore, so she decided to tell the truth.

“Does that mean that brother Qin isn’t the legendary special crippled body?”Zhuo Jing asked in shock.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Special waste body? I have heard this name many times, but I have never really understood it.”

“The legendary waste body is the body that is beyond imagination and is not weaker than the demon beasts in the depths of the green rock forest. But the only pity is that the future is limited, so very few people are willing to see it,”Zhuo Jing explained.

“That’s right. The legendary crippled body is born unable to cultivate. Since ancient times, no one has been able to cultivate.”Li Yingying followed closely behind and said.

Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered, “I really want to see this kind of crippled body...”

“It’s meaningless.”Zhuo Jing shook his head and said.

“Think about it. This kind of body is indeed extremely powerful in the early stages. Very few people are his match. But because they can’t cultivate, they simply can’t catch up to him.”

“That’s right. Everyone can completely avoid his sharp edge. When we reach a higher realm in the future, this kind of physique will be like fish meat at the mercy of others.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. This was the truth.

Not to mention that kind of physique, even the current Qin Yu was too easy to be “Walked”by others. This was indeed a shortcoming.

“If Brother Qin is really poisoned by the Twilight Qi, then... Once you recover in the future, I’m afraid that no younger generation in the entire South Province is your match.”Li Yingying covered her mouth and exclaimed.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I do need a large amount of life qi. If you have any connections, please tell me. I, Qin Yu, will forever remember this favor.”

“Brother Qin, you must be joking. If I have any news, I will definitely tell you immediately!”Li Yingying took the lead and stood up.

The way she looked at Qin Yu seemed a little strange.

It was clearly the first time the two of them met, but there was some love in their eyes. This feeling made Qin Yu very uncomfortable.

“Qin Yu, Qin Yu! Where’s little meat cushion? Hurry up and come over!”

At this moment, Jue Wu’s voice suddenly spread throughout the entire great Yue mountain. It was so loud that it made people’s ears hurt.

Qin Yu only felt a little headache. Although this Jue Wu was a top expert in the South Province, she did things without any scruples. Qin Yu couldn’t do anything to her.

“Everyone, I’ll take my leave first. Please understand,”Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Everyone also cupped their hands and stood up to send her off.

Wen Da and Wen Er followed behind Qin Yu. As they walked, they said, “Damn it, the way that Li Yingying looks at you is too f * cking weird.”

“That’s right, that’s right. It’s really weird. Sister Lin was like this last time, and Li Yingying is also like this this time!”

Qin Yu glanced at Wen da and said, “This Li Yingying is obviously Mu Qiang’s woman. The two of you are not suitable for each other.”

As she was speaking, Jue Wu had already sprinted over from not far away. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

She directly sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Where have you been? What took you so long?”

Qin Yu raised her hand and patted Jue Wu’s head. She pretended to be angry and said, “Don’t call me that next time, understand?”

Jue Wu widened her eyes and said angrily, “I just look f * cking small. It doesn’t mean that I’m really a child. If you dare to touch me like this again, I’ll break your fingers. Do You Hear Me? !”

Qin Yu coughed dryly and said with slight embarrassment, “I’m sorry... But You’re not allowed to make such a big fuss next time, understand?”

“Alright, Alright.”Jue Wu waved her hand.

“Let’s go. Quickly take me to the top of the mountain. There is a kind of fruit there that is especially delicious.”Jue Wu licked her lips and said.

Qin Yu rolled her eyes and said, “What a foodie. What do you know other than eating?”

Jue Wu hurriedly shook her head and said, “I’m not eating it. That kind of fruit can help me cultivate, and it’s very delicious!”

Qin Yu was stunned and said with some surprise, “It can help you cultivate? Are you kidding?”

“Absolutely!”Jue Wu said with certainty.
