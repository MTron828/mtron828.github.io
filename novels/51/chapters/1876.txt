1877 The Battle with Nangong

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He didn’t expect to be noticed so soon. It seemed he could no longer hide it.

Therefore, Qin Yu admitted frankly, “That’s right.”

The young man from the Si family narrowed his eyes and said, “I didn’t expect another chaotic body in this world.”

!!

Not to be outdone, Qin Yu replied, “Yeah, I didn’t expect there’s another chaotic body in your Si family.

The young man was stunned and then said with a gloomy face, “You’re quite arrogant. If there’s a chance, let me see your ability.”

“You’ll definitely have a chance as long as today you can last until the end,” Qin Yu said.

“I didn’t expect you to participate in this competition. Why? Did Jiu Xiao back off?” the young man laughed heartily and said.

“You don’t have to ask so much about it.” Qin Yu knew he would become enemies with this guy sooner or later. Thus he decided not to treat him nicely.

The young man did not say anything else and turned to leave.

After he had walked far away, the peak master frowned and said, “You know Si Shiyu?”

“No, I don’t,” Qin Yu said.

“Mmm,” the peak master responded. “This Si Shiyu isn’t simple. Don’t underestimate him.”

“Don’t worry,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “I’d like to see what the Si family’s children are capable of.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This Si Shiyu was definitely not as good as Xin Shiyue. But telling from his name, his status in the Si family should not be low.

However, Qin Yu didn’t care about his sh*t identity at all. Worst scenario, he would just hide in Thunder Courtyard.

No matter how capable the Si family was, they couldn’t come to Thunder Courtyard to kill someone.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu felt a lot more relaxed.

After a short while, the people from the aristocratic families arrived.

Qin Yu didn’t know much about the nine aristocratic families in Zhongzhou.

They were the Yan family, the Gu family, and the Si family.

Of course, most of the people sent here today were elders of the respective aristocratic families. The head of the families certainly would not be here. Qin Yu did not pay much attention to them. He only noticed that they all sat beside the dean, and each had extremely overbearing internal qi.

“It should be starting soon,” Qin Yu said.

“Mmm,” the peak master at the side responded. “Basically, everyone’s here.”

“Do we draw lots later?” Qin Yu asked.

“The dean will arrange it,” the peak master said.

Qin Yu could not help but pray in his heart.

He hoped he would not encounter Zhao Wan Er. It would be best if he could fight with Nangong of Ethereal Peak or Si Shiyu of the Si family.

It was noisy at the scene. Everyone seemed to be reminiscing about the past.

Although there were not many opportunities for the main peaks to meet each other, everyone seemed to have some contact with each other. Therefore, many people took advantage of this opportunity to chat.

“Is that Si Shiyue disciple of one of the elders of the first main peak?” Qin Yu asked.

“That’s right,” the peak master nodded and said. “He’s from the Si family, after all. He naturally won’t join other main peaks.”

Speaking up to this point, the peak master’s old face turned red, and he said with slight guilt, “Qin Yu, Speaking of which, we don’t have an advantage either. Most of their peak masters are powerful, and those who participate are their closed-door disciples. But our Demon-slaying Peak…”

Although he didn’t finish his sentence, what he meant was very obvious. The strength of the Demon-slaying Peak’s peak master was much more inferior.

Qin Yu didn’t care about that. He waved his hand and said, “But we’re more experienced in actual combat.

“That’s just us consoling ourselves,” the peak master sighed and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He wasn’t too worried.

A moment later.

An enormously majestic voice came from all directions.

It sounded like the chiming of an ancient bell. It was majestic and carried a surging valiant internal qi.

Following the sound, the originally noisy scene soon quieted down.

The dean slowly stood up. With his hands behind his back, he gazed at the crowd and said, “The 8,936th round of competition of Thunder Courtyard begins now.”

Then, with a wave of his hand, several large words appeared in front of him.

These words were the names of the participants.

As if having their own consciousness, the words intertwined and merged continuously in the void.

Qin Yu was a little nervous. He was not afraid but did not want to encounter Zhao Wan Er in the first round.

In just a while, the outcome was shown to everyone.

Qin Yu’s opponent was Nangong.

As for Zhao Wan Er’s opponent, it was an unknown kid.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

“It’s alright,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

But the peak master and the others did not think so. Jiu Xiao patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said half-jokingly, “You’re not very lucky. You encounter a strong opponent like Nangong in the first round.”

“Brother Jiu Xiao, it’s not that I’m looking down on him. But I don’t give a d*mn to Nangong at all,” Qin Yu laughed and said.

The peak master rolled his eyes at Qin Yu and said, “He’s only second to Si Shiyu.”

...

Qin Yu shrugged and couldn’t care less.

The first battle was between Zhao Wan Er and a cultivator from the sixth main peak. The cultivator’s name was Qu Zhonghun.

The name looked somewhat powerful, but Jiu Xiao and the others had never heard of it.

“This Zhao Wan Er is Flower Granny’s personal disciple. Although it hasn’t been long, to be able to catch Flower Granny’s attention, she must be quite talented. She might even become the dark horse of this competition,” the peak master analyzed and said.

Jiu Xiao, by the side, nodded and said, “That’s right. Flower Granny’s strength is unfathomable. The disciples she personally trains are definitely not simple.”

Right at this moment, a gentle light drifted over and dispersed everyone.

Immediately after, the gentle light fell on everyone and wrapped them up to prevent the battle from affecting others.

Standing there, Qin Yu quietly looked at the center of the battlefield.

The battle started immediately, and Zhao Wan Er took the lead.

With a wave of her delicate hand, flowers like rain filled the sky. Her formidable internal qi made everyone tremble.

The moves looked extremely elegant, but the power was beyond imagination!

...

Even people like Qin Yu and Jiu Xiao couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.

Each of the flowers contained a power that could destroy the world. It was like an enhanced version of the Heavenly Flower of All!

Anyone who touched a petal would probably be crushed to pieces!

“It seems Wan’er is also a tough opponent,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

This battle did not seem to have much suspense.

In just half a day, Qu Zhonghun admitted defeat facing Zhao Wan Er’s formidable strength.

He was covered in blood, and his physical body was shattered. He looked extremely tragic.

After winning this battle, Zhao Wan Er could not help but look in Qin Yu’s direction. Her eyes were full of pride.

Qin Yu shrugged and couldn’t care less.

“Alright, it’s your turn now,” the peak master said.

As he spoke, Nangong stepped into the center of the battlefield, with his thunderous eyes staring at Qin Yu.
