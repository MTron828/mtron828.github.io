2013 The Overbearing Elder Si

This Mr. Gen did not seem very reliable, but Qin Yu had no choice at this moment. He could only wait for him for three days.

After that, Qin Yu turned around and left the shop, wandering around Divine Fortuity City.

Divine Fortuity City wasn’t big and was even a little cramped. However, it was full of shops.

Whenever Qin Yu walked into a shop, he would discover tremendously extraordinary magical artifacts.

!!

In the backyard, there were even master refiners refining magical artifacts.

Rumor had it that these master refiners were all from the Artifact Refining Guild, and their refining skills were tremendously mighty.

At this moment, Qin Yu noticed many people standing at the entrance of a shop.

They gathered together, observing something.

Qin Yu walked over quickly. He squeezed into the crowd and came to the forefront. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Soon, Qin Yu noticed a transparent pearl displayed in front of everyone.

This pearl was incomparably smooth. Deep inside, there seemed to be a stream flowing, which was incredibly magical.

“This pearl is called Yuan Ding Divine Pearl. It’s inherited from Immortal Emperor Yuan Ding and contains endless secrets and hidden treasures of the Immortal Emperor. There are rumors that the Yuan Ding Divine Pearl contains the secrets of Immortal Emperor Yuan Ding’s dao comprehension.” The shop owner was shouting hard to attract the attention of numerous people.

Hearing his words, Qin Yu could not help but snort.

If it contained the secret of the Immortal Emperor, it would probably attract everyone to come and fight for it. No one would be so stupid to sell it.

“Of course, this Yuan Ding Divine Pearl was copied by the later generations when they observed Immortal Emperor Yuan Ding comprehending the dao. Nonetheless, it contains a trace of the Immortal Emperor’s dao.” At this moment, the shop owner suddenly changed the subject and said with a smile.

“This pearl does look extraordinary. I was lucky enough to have comprehended it in Immortal Emperor Yuan Ding’s sanctum. It does have a similar internal qi,” someone said at the side.

“That’s right. Rumor has it that Lord Zhu obtained the real Yuan Ding Divine Pearl by chance. After comprehending the Dao within it, he created twelve imitation Yuan Ding Divine Pearls for future generations to comprehend.”

“According to the rumors, 38 of them comprehended dao from Yuan Ding Divine Pearl and stepped into the True Saint cultivation Realm.”

“38 people? Weren’t there only twelve pearls?” someone asked curiously.

“There were indeed only twelve, but each was passed down in the hands of many. Each time it passed through a person’s hand, its remaining dao technique would weaken a little. Therefore, we can’t determine whether this pearl still has any value.”

After hearing their comments, Qin Yu came to a realization.

Qin Yu had heard of Lord Zhu when he was in Luminous City.

He was a Tribulation Stage great cultivator of the Yao family and also one of the most powerful Tribulation Stage great cultivators in history.

“Boss, do you know how many generations this pearl has been passed down?” someone by the side asked.

“If I knew it, why would I sell it?” the boss laughed and said.

“How much do you plan to sell it for?” someone asked.

The boss shook his finger and said, “There is no fixed price for this item. It will be auctioned off. Everyone, please make your bids.”

“I’ll pay three million spirit coins.” Soon, someone offered.

“Three million? You really look down on this item. I’ll offer 10 million!”

“I’m willing to pay 50 million!”

“100 million!”

The price quickly increased. Qin Yu remained silent at the side. He quietly extended a wisp of divine sense and covered the pearl, wanting to pry something from it.

However, the moment he touched it, the shop owner noticed it. He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Sir, you should follow the rules.”

Qin Yu stuck out his tongue and could only withdraw his divine sense silently.

The price continued to rise, and soon, it had increased to a billion or so spirit coins.

When the price reached two billion spirit coins, more people had already gathered around, but fewer people were bidding.

Obviously, these people were not rich, and two billion had almost reached their limit.

Qin Yu counted the spirit coins in his hand and felt that two billion was not expensive. Thus he planned to bid for it.

However, at this moment, there was a commotion in the crowd.

He turned around and saw an elderly man in a white robe walking over. The people around him consciously made way for him.

When Qin Yu saw this person, his brows furrowed tightly.

This person was none other than Elder Si, who had attended the meeting not long ago!

“He’s here too.” Qin Yu frowned slightly and quickly hid in the dark.

With Elder Si’s ability, it was very likely that he could discover Qin Yu’s true identity. Therefore, he could only avoid him for the time being.

Elder Si’s arrival immediately silenced the scene. Some people greeted Elder Si, but he ignored them.

“So it’s the arrival of the Third Elder of the Si family. Please forgive me for not welcoming you from afar,” the boss said with a fake smile.

Elder Si ignored him. He looked at the pearl in front and examined it for a long time.

“Elder Si is also interested in this item?” The boss took the opportunity to ask.

Elder Si glanced at him and said indifferently, “Do you know the origin of this item?”

“Of course, I know,” the boss smiled and said. “My ancestor got this by chance when he was traveling.”

“By chance?” Elder Si snorted and said, “This item was once in the hands of my Si family’s ancestors, but they accidentally lost it later! I don’t know how your ancestor obtained this item, but this pearl belongs to my Si family!”

Hearing Elder Si’s shameless words, the shop owner couldn’t help but sneer and say, “If we were to trace its source, I’m afraid this item belongs to the Yao family. It doesn’t have much to do with your Si family, right?”

Elder Si wasn’t surprised. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Don’t worry. The Si family has always been kind to people. Thus we can give you a decent amount of spirit coins.”

“Oh? How much does Elder Si intend to give me?” the shop owner asked.

...

Elder Si extended three fingers and said, “30 million spirit coins.”

“30 million spirit coins? Elder Si, is this any different from daylight robbery?” the shop owner said with a dark face.

“You can’t be too greedy,” Elder Si said calmly. “30 million spirit coins is already a lot. Besides, this item belongs to the Si family.”

Hearing Elder Si’s shameless words, Qin Yu could not help but curse repeatedly at the side.

This old b*stard was truly shameless to the extreme!

“30 million spirit coins. Do you want it or not?” Elder Si’s tone was full of threat.

“Three billion,” the shopkeeper said coldly. “This pearl will be yours. Otherwise, no deal!”

As soon as he said that, a terrifying internal qi burst out from Elder Si’s body.

“Are you sure?” he asked coldly.
