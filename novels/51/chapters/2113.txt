2114 Si Liuhe’s Breakthrough!

“In such a great era, no one can thrive solely on his own. However, the Alchemist Association might become your hiding place in the end,” the Pavilion Master said.

Qin Yu felt grateful in his heart. He nodded and said, “Thank you, Pavilion Master.”

After that, Qin Yu sat there and discussed the dao with the Pavilion Master for three whole days.

Qin Yu was shocked to discover the Pavilion Master’s understanding of the dao technique was way beyond his imagination.

In just three days of discussing dao, Qin Yu had a more thorough understanding of the dao technique.

On the fourth day, Jue Wu ran to this side room.

She looked at Qin Yu and then the gorgeous woman in front of him. Then she muttered, “This kid is really good with women.”

Hearing Jue Wu’s words, Qin Yu let out a dry cough. He said in a somewhat embarrassed manner, “Pavilion Master, please don’t mind. Jue Wu has always been like this.”

Of course, the Pavilion Master would not stoop to Jue Wu’s level. Moreover, Jue Wu was far older than the Pavilion Master in age.

She slowly stood up and said, “Alright, it’s time for you to leave.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yao Meng… I’ll leave it to you.”

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly. She knew Yao Meng, so she was more at ease.

After that, Qin Yu bid farewell to the Pavilion Master and left the Alchemist Association with Jue Wu.

It was as usual outside the Alchemist Association’s door. The moment the door opened, the crowd was like wild beasts that had opened their bloody mouths and swarmed in.

Unfortunately, the Alchemist Association had long set up a prohibition. Even if the door was open, they could not step in.

Qin Yu pushed the crowd aside and quickly left with Jue Wu.

Not long after leaving the Alchemist Association, lightning suddenly flashed, and thunder rumbled in the sky. Large patches of dark clouds covered the sky and the sun, and terrifying visions continuously appeared.

Seeing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he immediately had a bad feeling in his heart.

“Someone has stepped into the True Saint Realm.”

“That’s right. It shouldn’t be too far from here. After waiting for so long, someone has finally become a True Saint.”

“I wonder who has become a True Saint first.”

Numerous discussions emerged instantly, adding turmoil and suspicion to this unsettled world.

“Qin Yu, look!” Jue Wu pulled Qin Yu’s hand and pointed at the vision in the sky.

Qin Yu looked up and saw a golden light suddenly flash from the dark clouds. It was as if a god had descended, making it unbearable to look at.

That was the symbol of the True Saint Realm.

“Someone has indeed stepped into the True Saint Realm,” Qin Yu said in a low voice, feeling a little uneasy.

Qin Yu’s brows furrowed tightly. He was feeling a little uneasy.

This place was the closest to the Si Family, so Si Liuhe most probably had stepped into the True Saint Realm.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu pulled Jue Wu and left quickly.

“Where to?” Jue Wu asked.

“Return to Thunder Courtyard immediately,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu had no way to protect himself against a True Saint at his peak. All his methods were not worth mentioning.

It was impossible to cross the gap of the True Saint’s strength. The safest thing to do now was to return to Thunder Courtyard

Without hesitation, the two immediately turned around and left, rushing toward Thunder Courtyard. The crowd behind them was still discussing who had stepped into the True Saint Realm, but they were no longer in the mood to pay attention.

Everything was as Qin Yu had expected. The person who had stepped into the True Saint Realm was none other than Si Liuhe.

He was a genius of the Si family, to begin with, and he had once swept across the entire world by himself. He could be said to be invincible in his same cultivation realm.

In the Degenerate Age, he pioneered an alternative dao technique to become a Saint. Now that he had stepped into the True Saint Realm, no one knew how terrifying his strength was.

Numerous people in the Si family were kneeling on the ground. They were waiting quietly at the place where Si Liuhe retreated.

The person leading was the current Holy Lord of the Si family, Si Shiyue.

His expression was cold and emotionless. To welcome Si Liuhe out of his retreat, he even ended his own retreat.

A moment later, a series of strange phenomena came from the retreat’s place. After that, all the light began to converge and finally disappeared into the cave abode.

The scene was silent.

After five minutes, Si Liuhe slowly walked out of the cave abode.

At this moment, His temperament is extraordinarily ethereal. The Holy Power surged in every move he made.

The moment Si Liuhe walked out of the cave, the whole world seemed to tremble under his feet.

His internal qi was as deep as the ocean and immeasurable, and his gaze was as sharp as swords, piercing and compelling. A power to crush and destroy lay in his seemingly ordinary movements.

His clothes fluttered without the wind, like a king who was unrivaled in the world, dignified and solemn. His black hair was like a waterfall, and a starry brilliance shone between his eyebrows and eyes. His eyes were as deep as the night, like divine eyes that could see through everything.

Si Liuhe walked out of the cave abode step by step. Every step he took was like he was stepping on heaven and earth. Every step he took seemed to resonate with heaven and earth as if he was the master of the world. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Around him, an invisible air current began to revolve as if numerous divine beasts were circling him, supreme and overbearing. That was the symbol of the True Saint Realm. It was a brand new realm that he had stepped into that he attained nearly invincible power.

Si Liuhe, who had been on the decline for many years, was now reborn like a handsome young man.

“Welcome Grandmaster to the True Saint Realm,” Si Shiyue bowed slightly and said quietly.

“Welcome Grandmaster to the True Saint Realm!” The Si family’s resounding roars toward the sky immediately could be heard from behind!

This sound is as intense as the shattering earth and tumultuous as the surging tides. It reverberated in the air as if it had an endless force of vibration, causing a strong tremor in people’s hearts.

Glancing at the crowd, Si Jiuhe put his hands behind his back and said nothing.

After a while, Si Liuhe’s gaze fell on Si Shiyue.

“Why isn’t Holy Lord here?” Si Liuhe said indifferently.

Si Shiyu frowned and told Si Liuhe what had happened.

Si Liuhe’s expression turned cold.

“The dignified Holy Lord is actually so angry that he can’t get up. This is really embarrassing for the Si family!” Si Liuhe said coldly.

Si Shiyue was silent. After all, he was his father, and he was not qualified to comment.

“Shi Yue, are you the Holy Lord now?” Si Liuhe asked.

“That’s right, Grandmaster,” Si Shiyue bowed slightly in response.

Hearing this, Si Liuhe immediately bent down and greeted, “Holy Lord.”

Si Shiyue turned pale with fright. He hurriedly bowed and said, “Grandmaster, I’m only temporarily holding the position of Holy Lord. We’re all waiting for you to come out of seclusion and take charge of the situation.”

Si Liuhe frowned and said, “Me? I’m afraid that’s not appropriate.”

“Right now, only you can hold this position,” Si Shiyue said in a deep voice.
