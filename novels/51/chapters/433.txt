Chapter 434: Capture Old Mister Yan Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Everything you have is mine!” Xiaoru said crazily.

Qin Yu sneered. “You think someone like you is worthy to cooperate with others?”

“Cut the crap!” Xiaoru became even more unhinged.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I will imprison you and make you beg for death every day!”

“Aren’t you an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? I will make you spit out your pill formulas one by one! You have to make sure that you have enough, because that way, you can live longer...”

As he looked at the crazy woman in front of him, the disgust in Qin Yu’s heart intensified.

“The thing you want is on me. Bring it on,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xiaoru clenched the folding fan in her hand, and a strong gust of wind instantly surrounded her.

Her internal qi rustled, and her hair fluttered in the wind, making her look like a crazy shrew!

“Watch me cripple you!” Xiaoru screamed, and her whole body floated over.

The folding fan in her hand carried a strange internal qi, and a bright red light slowly floated up.

This light made people feel as if it was going to penetrate their nerves.

“Spiritual artifact?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Only then did he realize that the folding fan in Xiaoru’s hand was actually a spiritual artifact!

Moreover, it was an extraordinary spiritual artifact!

“Your eyes are really sharp, but it’s a pity that it’s useless even if you know!” Xiaoru roared crazily.

The folding fan was like a steel knife fiercely slashing at Qin Yu’s waist!

“Dang!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The deafening sound was like the collision of steel!

Xiaoru’s body took a few steps back, and her palm was hurt from the impact!

“It’s a good thing, but it depends on who uses it,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xiaoru’s expression changed, and she sneered. “Your body is really tough beyond imagination, but without the support of internal qi, you are just a walking corpse!”

After saying that, Xiaoru waved her hand, and countless bullet-like energy burst out from the folding fan.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The energy hit Qin Yu’s body, and a crisp sound was heard.

Qin Yu seemed to be bathed in the rain, and white spots appeared on his body one after another, but he didn’t seem to be injured at all.

“What a strong body.” Xiaoru’s expression changed.

She didn’t dare to be negligent anymore. She immediately held the folding fan with both hands, and waves of internal force flowed along the folding fan.

In an instant, a huge portrait condensed in front of her!

A fierce beast with fangs grew out of the portrait. The murderous aura from the ancient times made people shudder!

“Tear him apart!” Xiaoru pushed the folding fan with all her strength. This fierce beast, which was formed from a spiritual artifact, immediately rushed toward Qin Yu!

“Let’s not talk about it being fake, so what even if it was a real beast? I’ll still smash it with one punch!” Qin Yu shouted, and a dazzling golden light immediately burst out from his fist!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu clenched his golden fist and smashed it toward the head of the beast!

“Kacha!”

His fierce fist instantly smashed the head of the beast into pieces!

The force that burst out from the folding fan immediately dissipated!

Meanwhile, Xiaoru suffered the backlash of the huge force. She took a few steps back and spat out a mouthful of blood!

“You... didn’t your dantian get damaged? How... how...” Xiaoru’s mouth was bleeding, and her face was full of panic!

“If my dantian didn’t get damaged, how could fish like you take the bait?” Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

Xiaoru was terrified and screamed, “You... how dare you lie to us?!”

“It’s your fault for falling for the bait,” Qin Yu said.

“If you hadn’t wanted to kill me, how could you die in my hands?”

As he spoke, Qin Yu walked toward Xiaoru step by step.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me!” Xiaoru, trying to escape, climbed desperately on the ground.

However, how could Qin Yu give her the chance? He immediately raised his hand and slapped her head.

“Ah!!”

The pain from the bottom of her heart made Xiaoru let out a shrill cry!

Her plump body quickly withered and turned into a dried corpse.

“You are the first,” Qin Yu said coldly as he looked at the corpse.

Then, Qin Yu flicked his finger, and a wisp of purple spiritual fire immediately landed on Xiaoru’s corpse.

In less than half a second, the corpse disappeared into thin air.

“A sixth level Inner Strength Grandmaster’s improvement to me is too small for me.” Feeling the internal qi from Xiaoru’s body, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

They were both Inner Strength Grandmasters, but the improvement brought by the peak of an Inner Strength Grandmaster was far greater than that of a sixth level Inner Strength Grandmaster.

The difference between them was huge.

“Although a fly is small, it is still meat.” Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

Then, Qin Yu picked up the folding fan that had fallen to the ground and carefully lit it up.

This folding fan was made quite exquisitely. The pink body of the fan added a sense of contrast.

It was clearly a spiritual artifact that was filled with danger, yet it had such a cute shape.

If one didn’t look closely, no one would have thought that this was a spiritual artifact that could kill people.

“Perhaps I can give it to Fang Yue as a gift,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After putting the folding fan into his Spatial Magic Artifact, Qin Yu took out his cell phone and gave Fang Yue a call.

The call was quickly picked up. Fang Yue said with a smile, “Since you suddenly called me, are you going to cancel the partnership?”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “I was afraid Miss Fang would instead.”

“Mr. Qin may be able to deceive others, but you can’t deceive me,” Fang Yue said with a smile.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh inside.

This woman was really smart. As expected, he couldn’t deceive her.

“If it’s convenient, let’s meet,” Qin Yu said to Fang Yue.

Fang Yue said with some surprise, “This seems to be the first time Mr. Qin took the initiative to ask me out.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and waited for Fang Yue’s answer.

A few minutes later, Fang Yue said, “Mr. Qin, if it’s convenient, why don’t we meet in Sea City?”

“Sea City?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Fang Yue agreed and said, “Yes, I happen to have something to do in Sea City.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu immediately agreed without thinking.

Qin Yu also had the intention to go to Sea City because it was the second largest city after Jingdu.

No matter what the resources, Sea City would not be inferior to Jingdu.

...

Sea City Airport.

Five tall and burly men stepped out of the plane.

The leader was a man who looked slightly feminine.

“Why do we need Elder Li to personally capture a merchant? We are enough,” said a tall man beside him.

“Humph, what do you know?”

The person who spoke was none other than Li Zinan.

As he wished, he became an Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect. Although he was ranked at the bottom among the Elders, his status was still high.

It was said that no matter where an Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect went, he would be received by local bigwigs.

And their purpose for this trip was to bring Old Mister Yan back to Jingdu.
