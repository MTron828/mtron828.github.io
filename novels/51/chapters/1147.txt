Chapter 1148: Chapter 1,148, the mighty Gu Xinghe! 

The few of them quickly decided on a candidate and immediately sent someone to call Gu Xinghe in.

The moment Gu Xinghe entered the door, he fell to his knees with a thud.

His head hit the ground and his posture was extremely low.

“Sir, is there something you need from me?”As he spoke, Gu Xinghe still did not raise his head, as if he was one of their dogs.

The higher-ups looked at each other, then could not help but burst into laughter.

That laughter was like a sharp blade, piercing into Gu Xinghe’s heart.

However, he still did not have the intention to resist. Instead, he put on an even lower posture.

“Gu Xinghe, haven’t you always wanted to avenge your father?”At this moment, Yan Yongfu opened his mouth to speak.

When Gu Xinghe heard this, his body suddenly trembled.

“Sir, are you willing to avenge me?”Gu Xinghe’s voice was trembling. It was unknown whether it was because of excitement or some other reason.

Yan Yongfu said indifferently, “That depends on how you perform.”

Gu Xinghe hurriedly said, “As long as I can avenge my father, I’m willing to do anything!”

Yan Yongfu raised his eyebrows and looked at the other higher-ups.

Then, Yan Yongfu said indifferently, “Okay, then I’ll test you. As long as you perform well, we’ll consider it and agree to it.”

Yan Yongfu touched his chin and thought for a moment, then said, “Go to the door and kneel for three days and three nights to show your loyalty.”

“Yes!”

Without thinking, Gu Xinghe got up and was about to leave.

“Wait.”At this time, Yan Yongfu called out to Gu Xinghe again.

He pointed to the ground and said, “Kneel and crawl out.”

Gu Xinghe didn’t hesitate at all. He immediately knelt on the ground and crawled toward the door.

Yan Yongfu obviously didn’t do it to torture Gu Xinghe.

The reason why he did it was to see if Gu Xinghe was loyal to him.

A person who still had his dignity would not listen to him.

“That’s enough.”Yan Yongfu waved his hand and said calmly, “Gu Xinghe, if I let you cut off your legs and arms, are you willing to do it?”

Gu Xinghe did not say anything. He activated his zhen qi and shattered his limbs!

“As long as I can avenge my father, I’m willing to do anything...”Gu Xinghe said while enduring the pain.

Yan Yongfu nodded in satisfaction. He slowly stood up and said, “Alright, since you want to take revenge so badly, we’ll give you a chance to take revenge yourself!”

Gu Xinghe’s expression immediately turned ugly. He said dejectedly, “I’m not his match at all...”

“Hahaha! Of course, you’re not his match. However... we’ll use a secret technique to give you our strength,”Yan Yongfu said indifferently.

“With the strength of the eight of US injected into your body, killing him, Qin Yu, will be a piece of cake!”

Upon hearing this, Gu Xinghe’s heart immediately began to beat violently.

He lowered his head to his chest and said, “How am I worthy of having the strength of a few higher-ups...”

“Hahaha!”Yan Yongfu could not help but stroke his beard and laugh loudly.

He said calmly “Back then, your father, and even the entire Jingdu’s martial arts association, had once received our favor. As his only son, how could you not have the qualifications? You just need to tell us, are you willing or not?”

“I am willing! I dream of it even in my dreams!”Gu Xinghe’s voice was high-pitched, but his head was still lowered. He did not raise his head at all.

“Okay!”Yan Yongfu nodded. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He exchanged a glance with the other higher-ups, then waved his hand and said, “Go and wait for us in the cultivation room. Later, we will impart our spiritual power to you and let you take revenge personally!”

“Yes! Thank you, higher-ups!”Gu Xinghe didn’t say anything. He used his body and slowly crawled toward the training room.

Yan Yongfu only sighed slightly after Gu Xinghe crawled far away.

“We have paid too much to get rid of this Qin Yu,”Yan Yongfu said in a low voice.

“Yes, but we have no other choice.”

These people had always been cautious. Even the first secret realm was sealed.

But now, in order to get rid of Qin Yu, they would rather pass on their strength to Gu Xinghe. This was enough to prove how afraid they were of the future Qin Yu!

“If we pass on our strength to this Gu Xinghe, will we still be able to take it back?”Among the eight people, the only female executive asked.

Yan Yongfu said indifferently, “Of course, but we need Gu Xinghe’s cooperation.”

“What if he doesn’t cooperate?”A higher-up asked.

Yan Yongfu sighed slightly and said, “So, this is an adventure. But... This Gu Xinghe is just a spineless person. Where did he get the courage to go against us?”

“Yes, trust Gu Xinghe. It’s much safer than letting Qin Yu Live.”

The few of them didn’t say anything else and walked towards the training room.

In the training room, Gu Xinghe was lying in the center of a huge array platform.

The eight higher-ups were in eight different positions.

With the secret language spoken by Yan Yongfu, the inheritance ceremony officially began.

A Ray of light flashed between the brows of the eight people. This was the power of their divine sense!

This kind of inheritance was extremely terrifying. Not only could it impart one’s spiritual power to the opponent, it could even impart the power of one’s divine sense!

A trace of pain flashed across Gu Xinghe’s face. The sudden vast divine power was somewhat unbearable for him.

Even so, Gu Xinghe still gritted his teeth and endured it.

The ceremony lasted for a full three hours.

Three hours later, the light on the array platform finally began to fade.

The eight executives’faces darkened, and their internal Qi became a little sluggish.

Yan Yongfu waved his hand weakly and said, “Gu Xinghe, I’ll leave the rest to you...”

Gu Xinghe’s body was slowly recovering in the center of the array platform.

At this moment, he finally raised his head, and a strange smile appeared on his face.

“You really think I, Gu Xinghe, AM a dog, right...”Gu Xinghe’s voice was slightly cold, and the corners of his mouth curled into a strange smile.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was focused on studying the fighting formula.

But at this moment, his heart suddenly throbbed, and his right eyelid twitched violently.

An uneasy feeling filled Qin Yu’s heart.
