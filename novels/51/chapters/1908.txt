1909 Entering the Yan Family

This cultivator looked totally different from the other cultivators just now.

The other cultivators looked like coming from noble families and were dressed up nobly. However, the cultivator in front of him looked like a beggar in ragged clothes.

“Yes, I’m,” Qin Yu nodded and said without thinking much.

“Mmm,” the man responded. “Let’s go. I’ll take you to Xihuang Island.”

!!

Qin Yu didn’t say much and immediately followed him, getting ready to go to Xihuang Island.

The Yan family was huge beyond imagination. One could not see the end of the family.

The entire Yan family was like a world, and in his world, it was divided into countless cities.

Qin Yu did not dare to miss a single spot, and his eyes kept looking around.

However, he did not dare to release his divine sense. It was in the Yan family, after all. Who knew what kind of old monsters were hiding here?

“By the way, Senior, what kind of place is this Xihunag Island?” Qin Yu asked.

The other party turned around and glanced at Qin Yu. He then smiled and said, ” No wonder they sent you to Xihuang Island. With your appearance, you can only go to Xihuang Island.”

Qin Yu was tremendously displeased. D*mn it! Was being ugly mean I must be discriminated against?

“Sigh! It’s better to leave the Yan family than go to Xihuang Island. The conditions are incredibly harsh there,” he continued.

“Why did you say so?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

The other party said in a deep voice, “Xihuang Island is an isolated island suspended in the air. Rumor has it that a terrifying existence is suppressed under the island. Therefore, you can’t see anything on Xihuang Island. There are only solitary stones. As for spiritual energy, you can forget about it. There is endless dark energy there.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Dark energy?” Qin Yu was stunned for a moment, and then overjoyed!

It was indeed an extremely harsh condition for others, but for Qin Yu, it was simply a great blessing!

“Why are you so happy?” The cultivator noticed Qin Yu’s strange response and frowned.

Qin Yu quickly shook his head and said, “No, it’s just that I like peace and quiet. I have a solitary personality.”

The other party nodded and continued, “The scariest person on Xihuang Island is the third princess. The third princess is unruly and cruel. She once raised a large number of evildoers on Xihuang Island for her to play with. With your look, you will definitely be played by her when you go to Xihuang Island. At that time, it will be a double torture, mentally and physically.”

Qin Yu touched his chin, getting even more curious about the third princess now.

“Who exactly is this third princess?” Qin Yu was confused.

“She’s the third princess of the Yan family. What else could she be?” the other party said in an unpleasant tone.

At the mention of the third princess, his expression became a little unnatural as if he had been tortured by her before.

Qin Yu wasn’t afraid. As long as he didn’t expose her identity, there was nothing he couldn’t endure.

“By the way, Senior, there’s one more thing. Where is Yan Ruoxue?” Qin Yu asked.

“You can’t call the saintess by her name here,” the other party was stunned, frowned, and said.

Qin Yu snorted. D*mn it! The Yan family indeed had many rules.

“So, where is the saintess?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

“The saintess is on Mount Donghuang, the opposite direction of Xihuang Island,” the other party said.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly had a bad feeling.

D*mned! It would probably take several days to get to Mount Donghuang from Xihuang Island.

By then, it would be difficult for Qin Yu to leave Xihuang Island.

“In that case, I won’t get to see Yan… the saintess,” Qin Yu said.

“Why do you want to see the saintess? Do you want to scare the saintess with your appearance?” The other party laughed.

Qin Yu glared at him and said, “Senior, I respect you and call you Senior. But you’ve already belittled my appearance three times!”

“Hahaha!” The other party couldn’t help but laugh. He waved his hand and said, “Alright. I promise I won’t say that again.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at him, waiting for him to continue.

“It’s not entirely impossible for you to see the saintess. The saintess has been to Xihuang Island before,” he continued.

“When was that?” Qin Yu quickly asked.

“You know Si Shiyue from the Si family, do you?” he asked with a smile.

When he mentioned Si Shiyue, Qin Yu’s expression became somewhat unnatural.

“Yes,” he said. “He’s the famous Holy Son of the Si family. I’ve heard so much about him.”

“Then you know Si Shiyue has a chaotic body, do you? Besides spiritual energy, the chaotic body also requires dark energy to cultivate ,” he said with a smile.

“Back then, when Si Shiyue went to Xihuang Island for a retreat for some time, the saintess was accompanying him.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he said with a cold face, “The saintess was accompanying Si Shiyue? Only the two of them?”

“Yes, only the two of them,” he continued.

Qin Yu’s expression became even more unnatural. His face was gloomy, and he could not help but emit a trace of killing intent.

“What? Do you admire the saintess?” the cultivator laughed and said.

Qin Yu suppressed his displeasure, nodded, and said. “Yes, I do.”

“Hahaha! Most of the people in the Yan family admire the saintess. She is gentle and is never arrogant because of her talent. She is also very beautiful. Who wouldn’t admire her?” the cultivator said with emotion.

It was true. Back then, when they were still on Earth, Yan Ruoxue was rather gentle to people and had never been arrogant.

“How did the saintess hook up with Si Shiyue and even go to Xihuang Island with him?” Qin Yu said angrily.

“It must be the arrangement by the head of the Yan family,” the cultivator sighed.”It’s called a force majeure.”

...

Hearing this, Qin Yu felt a little better.

“Will Si Shiyue come often?” Qin Yu was puzzled.

“No, he rarely comes to Xihuang Island,” the cultivator said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded and didn’t say anything else. He started to plan how to get to Mount Donghuang.

The two walked for two days before they finally arrived nearby Xihuang Island.

The closer they got to Xihuana Island, the thinner the spiritual energy became. The surrounding green mountains and rivers also began to disappear as if spring had turned into winter.

As far as the eyes could see, in the void away from the Yan family, an isolated island was floating in the air. This isolated island was Xihuang Island.

A small palace was right next to Xihuang Island. It was bustling, and the notorious third princess lived in it.

“Xihuang Island is right in front of us,” the cultivator pointed at the island and said.

“You go over by yourself, ” he said. “I won’t be accompanying you.”

“Why?” Qin Yu was puzzled and asked.

...

“I don’t want to see the third princess again,” he snorted and said.

Qin Yu didn’t think much of it, but asked curiously, “The environment here isn’t good at all. Why did the third princess choose to live here?”

“Who would want to live here? The third princess is only being punished and lives here,” the cultivator said.
