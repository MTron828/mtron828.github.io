1840 Meeting Old Acquaintance

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He suddenly had a premonition of what had happened.

“Dean Lei, please speak,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Dean Lei took a sip of tea, then said with a grave expression, “Something has happened to Jue Wu.”

“What?” As soon as he said that, Qin Yu stood up!

He looked at Dean Lei and said, “What’s the matter with Jue Wu? What has happened to her?”

!!

“Don’t be anxious, “Dean Lei waved his hand and said. “Let’s sit down and talk.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. Although he was very anxious, he sat down obediently.

“I have promised you to take good care of Jue Wu, but something unexpected has happened,” Dean Lei said with emotion. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

After that, Dean Lei told Qin Yu what had happened.

Qin Yu’s face turned extremely cold after hearing that.

“Jue Wu, this fellow!” Qin Yu could not help but grit his teeth.

This fellow looked carefree, but in reality, she was meticulous.

She seemed to have never troubled anyone. No matter what happened, she liked to solve it by herself.

It made Qin Yu feel even more distressed, and his heart was full of guilt.

At this moment, Dean Lei stretched out his palm, and an image appeared abruptly in front of them.

It was the image of Jue Wu hanging on Tianyun Sect’s city wall.

“Jue Wu!” Seeing this, Qin Yu instantly stood up again!

The people who passed by were cursing at Jue Wu, while Li Yingying on the city wall had a triumphant look.

Looking at Li Yingying’s ugly face, Qin Yu’s expression became even colder.

He took a deep breath and coldly said, “Li Yingying… You’re actually not dead yet!”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

But at this moment, Dean Lei raised his palm and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

“Where’re you going?” Dean Lei asked indifferently.

“I’m going to save Jue Wu,” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said.

“They might have Saint Weapon in their hands. Are you going there to be killed? ” Dean Lei asked indifferently.

Qin Yu fell into silence.

Even though he had already stepped into the Reversion Void Stage, it was totally impossible to resist the Saint Weapon.

“Let’s think about this matter at length. You’re bound to fail to do the right thing if you’re impulsive,” Dean Lei said.

Qin Yu calmed down a little after hearing what Dean Lei said.

“You’re right, Dean,” he bowed slightly and said.

“There’s another piece of news. Your friend, Chang Mang, is here,” Dean Lei suddenly said.

“Chang Mang?” Qin Yu was stunned. He quickly asked, “Dean Lei, where’s Chang Mang now?”

Dean Lei smiled but did not say anything. He waved his hand again, and an image appeared in front of them.

The image was of Chang Mang wreaking havoc in Thunder Courtyard.

Qin Yu was lost for words seeing the scene.

“This fellow is still as reckless as ever.” Qin Yu could not help but smile bitterly.

“Alright. Do what you need to do. As for how to save Jue Wu, it depends on you.” Dean Lei waved his hand.

Qin Yu quickly nodded. He bowed deeply to Dean Lei and said, “Thank you, Dean Lei.”

Qin Yu then turned around and left Thunder Courtyard.

At Demon-slaying Peak, a large group of people gathered in Chang Mang’s cave abode.

This group of people seemed to be playing cards under Chang Mang’s lead.

As the instigator, Chang Mang naturally worked the hardest, constantly shouting in the crowd.

Qin Yu quietly walked behind him and looked down at the game in front of him.

“D*mn it! Do you guys know how to play?

“You can’t play like this. Oh my God, you’re really a blockhead.

“Quickly give it to me. Let me teach you!”

Watching the scene, Qin Yu smiled without saying a word. He stood behind Chang Mang and said indifferently, “The pot calling the kettle black. You’re not that good at it either.”

“Nonsense! I’m…” Chang Mang turned around and was about to curse. But when he saw Qin Yu’s face, he was stunned on the spot.

“Qin… Qin Yu? D*mn it!”

After cursing, Chang Mang pulled Qin Yu into his arms.

Tears flowed out of the rough man’s eyes. He hugged Qin Yu tightly and said in a sobbing tone, “Finally, I get to see you. Why did you take so long to come?”

Qin Yu was also full of emotions. He patted Chang Mang’s back and scolded with a smile, “It’s enough. Don’t let others laugh at you.”

Only then did Chang Mang come back to his senses. He looked at the people around him, waved his hand, and said, “You guys get out of here. I’m not playing anymore today.”

“Sure. We wouldn’t dare to interrupt your romantic time,” the people around him said jokingly.

“Go to hell!” Chang Mang scolded with a smile.

After the crowd dispersed, Chang Mang looked at Qin Yu and said somewhat excitedly, “How are you? Are you doing fine?”

“Fine, I’m doing very fine,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

After that, Qin Yu told Chang Mang about his experience, including the fact that he had arrived at Holy Region a year later.

“How about you? Where did you descend after you came to Holy Region from Earth back then?” Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang.

“The teleportation formation that brought us to Holy Region back then had a problem halfway through,” Chang Mang said in a deep voice. “We fell from it and almost died in the formation.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help feeling surprised. He had thought that Chang Mang and the others would arrive at Zhongzhou and didn’t expect such a problem to occur.

“Fortunately, I managed to survive and fell into the Crimson Moon Continent. When I woke up again, I had been unconscious for many days,” Chang Mang continued.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and asked, “What about Yao Meng and the rest? How are they doing now?”

Chang Mang sighed and said, “There was a problem with the formation. Everyone fell out of the formation and was separated. When I woke up, I was lying alone in the desert.

“To be honest, I’ve been trying to find you. Unfortunately, there was no news until not long ago, someone who claimed to be from the Yan family found me.”

Qin Yu was silent.

He had never expected Chang Mang and the others to end up like this.

“In other words, you had no idea that I didn’t come to Holy Region,” Qin Yu said.

“That’s right,” Chang Mang said with a bitter smile. “It was until you told me today that I realized you didn’t step into the formation.”

“It’s really a joke,” Qin Yu could not help but smile bitterly.

Then Chang Mang brought over some wine, and the two chatted as they drank.

Chang Mang told him everything he had experienced since he came to Holy Region, and Qin Yu told him everything he had encountered during this time.

In the end, Chang Mang couldn’t help but start crying.

He wiped his tears and said in great pain, “Actually… Someone stayed with me on the Crimson Moon Continent back then…”
