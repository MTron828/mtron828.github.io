1901 The Embarrassed Holy Sons

These people looked very miserable. They were covered in blood and their clothes were torn and tattered. Blood was flowing out of their mouths uncontrollably. Some of them even had half of their bodies smashed.

They were none other than Si Shifeng and the others.

Looking at the several embarrassed people, Saintess Gu couldn’t help but be surprised. She quickly walked up to them.

“You guys…” Saintess Gu was surprised.

Yan Yunfan ignored Saintess Gu. He turned his head to glare at the two Masters of Path of Heaven.

“Is this the path you chose? We almost died in there!” Yan Yunfan said furiously. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The two Masters of Path of Heaven were in an even worse state. Blood was gushing out of their bodies, and their internal qi was tremendously unstable.

In the face of Yan Yunfan’s angry roar, they did not dare to say anything. They could only pant slightly.

“B*stard! Fortunately, we were lucky. Otherwise, I’m afraid we would have died in the sanctum!” Si Shifeng also said.

At this moment, he seemed to have come to his senses and couldn’t help but look at Saintess Gu.

Seeing Saintess Gu in perfect condition, a trace of surprise flashed across Si Shifeng’s eyes. He quickly looked around as if he was looking for someone.

After a while, Si Shifeng’s gaze fell on Qin Yu.

Noticing Si Shifeng’s complicated expression, Qin Yu started mocking him.

“Mr. Si, I had warned you but you didn’t listen,” he said with a faint smile.

Just as Si Shifeng was about to speak, Yan Yunfan pushed him away and quickly walked to Qin Yu, grabbing his collar.

“Tell me! How did you know the correct path?” Yan Yunfan shouted.

“Do I need to explain it to you?” Qin Yu said with a cold face. Mr. Yan, please be more polite.”

“Mr. Yan, calm down.” Saintess Gu tried to smooth things over.

Yan Yunfan gritted his teeth and let go of Qin Yu. He then squinted his eyes and sized her up.

“Is this kid Master of Path of Heaven?” Si Shifeng said in surprise.

Yan Yunfan snorted and did not say anything.

At this moment, Chang Mang quickly walked to Qin Yu’s side for fear that something would happen to him.

“Saintess Gu, did you find any treasures in this sanctum? ” Si Shifeng asked tentatively.

Qin Yu was afraid that Saint Gu would spill the beans, so he hurriedly said, “What does it have to do with you whether we found any?”

Si Shifeng’s eyes narrowed and he said with a seeming smile, “Looks like you guys have obtained some treasures from this sanctum.”

“So what if you have? it has nothing to do with us.” Yan Yunfan snorted.

Saintess Gu chuckled and changed the subject. “You’re severely injured. Why don’t you come to my residence for treatment? I happened to get some ointments from Divine Medicine Conference not long ago. How about it?”

“It sounds good. Speaking of which, it has been a long time since I last visited Saintess Gu’s residence,” Si Shifeng quickly replied.

Initially, Yan Yunfan had wanted to reject, but his injuries were quite severe. So he finally agreed.

Although Qin Yu was reluctant, he could not say anything. He could only bring Chang Mang along and follow behind Saintess Gu, heading to her residence in the Mystic Realm.

Several people were sitting in the huge carriage. Saintess Gu was chatting with the few young men from aristocratic families.

Qin Yu wasn’t from the same circle as them, so he didn’t participate. Instead, he dragged Chang Mang to the cabin of the warship to taste the delicious food.

“Qin Yu, they didn’t make things difficult for you, did they?” Chang Mang asked.

“No, they didn’t,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “They would never fight in the sanctum.”

Chang Mang’s expression changed slightly. He looked in the direction of the warship’s deck and said coldly, “Would it be a trap?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. He then shook his head and said, “I don’t think so. Saintess Gu has no reason to attack.”

Chang Mang snorted coldly and said, “They’re from the same circle. After all, who are we? Who can guarantee she’s not pretending?”

After Chang Mang reminded him, Qin Yu was a little more vigilant.

“Great! You’re thoughtful now,” Qin Yu joked and said.

“Go to hell.” Chang Mang rolled his eyes at Qin Yu. “You should think about what to do. If not, we’ll find an excuse to leave this place.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He slowly got up and walked to the window, looking at the beautiful scenery outside.

“Let’s take it one step at a time,” Qin Yu said after a while. “If we fight, even if we’re not their match, we can still escape.”

After Chang Mang agreed with him, he didn’t say anything else.

The warship sailed across the sky, heading toward the Mystic Realm of the Gu family.

After a long time, the warship stopped at a huge mansion suspended in the void.

The entire mansion flickered with an icy blue light, and it looked like Asgard.

Above the mansion, there were a few big words, “Cold Moon Palace”.

“It must be Saintees Gu’s residence,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The entire mansion exuded cold air. After stepping into the mansion, everything in the surroundings completely turned into cold lights and a celestial aura.

As soon as they entered the Cold Moon Palace, a rabbit jumped into Saintess Gu’s arms.

It was an exquisite rabbit as if it was sketched by someone. It was incomparably beautiful, and it slightly exuded a mysterious internal qi.

Seeing the rabbit, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

As if recalling something, Qin Yu turned around to look at the words “Cold Moon Palace” behind his back.

“What’s wrong?” Chang Mang asked.

...

“Don’t you feel it looks familiar?” Qin Yu touched his chin and asked.

“Familiar? I don’t think so.” Chang Mang was taken aback and scratched his head.

“Cold Moon Palace, the rabbit, and the scenery here,” Qin Yu said in a low voice. “it seems to be from a certain place.”

“The Moon Palace? Chang’e?” Chang Mang suddenly realized.

He was stunned and looked around. His face was only full of astonishment and shock!

Now that he mentioned it, the more he looked at it, the more he felt like it.

“Could it be that Saintess Gu is Chang’e?” Chang Mang scratched his head in a daze.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “That’s impossible. The time doesn’t match. Besides, that’s just a myth.”

“Why? Is this your first time here?” At this moment, Si Shifeng came over.

Qin Yu glanced at him and didn’t bother to respond.

“You guys are just low-level rogue cultivators and have stepped into the Cold Moon Palace for the first time,” Si Shifeng said sarcastically. “It’s good enough that you’re able to do this.”

...

“You talk a lot of crap,” Chang Mang frowned and said.

But Qin Yu stopped Chang Mang. He looked at Si Shifeng and said with a faint smile, “I’m indeed curious about the Cold Moon Palace. Is it an extraordinary place?”

“You said it right. This Cold Moon Palace was passed down by the Saintess Gu’s ancestral granny,” Si Shifeng said indifferently.
