Chapter 494: Massacre! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The loud shouts caused the entire Saint Confucian Sect to buzz!

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s name, a large group of people immediately rushed out!

The one leading them was Elder Qu!

At a glance, there were at least dozens of people blocking the entrance.

Among them, a large portion were Inner Strength Grandmasters, and there were only two half-step Martial Marquises: Elder Qu and the other donkey-faced Elder.

This large group was indeed terrifying, but in Qin Yu’s eyes, it wasn’t worth mentioning.

For some reason, the people from the Saint Confucian Sect were like a bunch of ants in Qin Yu’s eyes.

“Qin Yu, you actually dared to come to the Saint Confucian Sect to make a ruckus?” Elder Qu raised his eyebrows and said with some amusement.

“Do you know that we’ve been trying to capture you?”

Qin Yu didn’t have the time to listen to his nonsense. He looked coldly at Elder Qu and said word by word, “Where is the Pavilion Master?”

Elder Qu was stunned and then laughed out loud. “The reason you came to the Saint Confucian Sect is to save the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

“I am asking you where the Pavilion Master is!” Qin Yu roared!

This voice contained a terrifying spiritual power that shook people’s eardrums until they felt pain!

Ordinary Inner Strength Past Masters died on the spot!

Elder Qu’s expression gradually turned cold.

“You want to find the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, right? Alright, I’ll tell you, she’s already dead!” Elder Qu grinned.

“But don’t worry, I’ll send you to see her immediately!”

Qin Yu felt as if he had been struck by lightning!

His mind went blank, and his ears buzzed!

Anger filled Qin Yu’s chest and his entire body trembled!

“You said... the Pavilion Master is dead?” Qin Yu asked in a trembling voice.

“Hahaha, yep!” Elder Qu couldn’t stop laughing.

“Next, the one who will die will be you!”

After saying this, Elder Qu took a step back, waved his hand, and said coldly, “Kill him!”

The people from the Saint Confucian Sect rushed toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu stood there in a daze and kept repeating, “Pavilion Master is dead... She is dead...”

Countless spells kept hitting Qin Yu’s body.

However, these spells quickly turned into nothingness, and not even a white dot was left!

“Saint Confucian Sect, I will make you pay with blood!”

Then, Qin Yu let out a furious roar, and the energy around his body exploded like a bomb!

A surging power spread out! The surrounding Inner Strength Grandmasters were sent flying!

“Saint Confucian Sect... I will kill all of you!”

Qin Yu’s eyes were scarlet red, and his entire body was filled with murderous internal qi, as if he was a demon from h*ll!

This strong murderous internal qi caused even the expressions of Elder Qu and the donkey-faced man to change!

This strong murderous internal qi was something they had never seen before!

“Kill him!” Elder Qu knew that things were bad, so he looked at the donkey-faced Elder.

The donkey-faced Elder didn’t know Qin Yu’s strength, so he nodded and walked towards Qin Yu.

“This kid has gone crazy, so it’s best to avoid confronting him,” Elder Qu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he turned around and left.

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, a golden light appeared in the crowd!

Qin Yu was like a grim reaper while shuttling through the crowd. With each palm strike, one person died!

Countless people’s bodies were smashed into meat paste, and countless people’s skulls were smashed into pieces!

Everyone began to be afraid. They kept retreating and their faces were filled with fear.

This was the first time the Saint Confucian Sect had suffered such a massacre! And the murderer was a young man only in his early thirties!

“Enough!”

At this moment, the donkey-faced Elder took a step forward and stood in front of Qin Yu.

He said coldly, “Since you dared to start a massacre in the Saint Confucian Sect, I think you’re looking for... Pfft!”

Before he could finish his words, Qin Yu had already slapped him!

This slap caused the donkey-faced Elder to retreat repeatedly, and his sternum was shattered!

“You’re courting death!” The donkey-faced Elder immediately flew into a rage. He was about to use his finishing spell, but Qin Yu had already stepped forward!

A large golden hand grabbed the donkey-faced Elder’s head and lifted him into the air!

“Go to h*ll!” Qin Yu roared angrily. He suddenly exerted force with his hand, and the donkey-faced Elder’s head was crushed!

Everyone was dumbstruck. A terrifying atmosphere filled the air.

The dignified Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect didn’t even have the chance to fight back and was crushed to death?

Was... was Qin Yu even human?!

“Run!”

Someone reacted first and ran away!

Then, everyone ran as fast as they could!

However, Qin Yu had already lost his mind. He killed everyone he saw, so how could he let them go?!

Qin Yu was like a demon as he chased after them!

In an instant, the Saint Confucian Sect was covered in blood and corpses. Countless people had died under Qin Yu’s hands!

This was the first time the Saint Confucian Sect had suffered such a disaster! The number one sect in the north was actually destroyed by a young man!

Elder Qu had already fled back to the main hall.

He patted his chest and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu seems to have gone mad! He actually came to the Saint Confucian Sect to start a massacre!”

If this news were to spread, people would be astonished!

“Fortunately, there is a Martial Marquis Weapon in the main hall...” Elder Qu looked up at the four corners of the main hall and heaved a sigh of relief. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

As long as there was a Martial Marquis Weapon, Elder Qu wasn’t afraid of Qin Yu.

After all, it contained the power of a Martial Marquis!

“Oh no!” Someone escaped into the hall.

“Qin Yu has gone mad! Many disciples have died at his hands!”

Elder Qu said coldly, “What are you panicking for? If he dares to come to this hall, I will definitely kill him!”

“But... but too many of our disciples have died...”

“There are only a few hundred people in the entire Saint Confucian Sect. At least a hundred people have died at the hands of Qin Yu...”

Elder Qu’s expression turned extremely ugly!

Since the sect master wasn’t around, he would be responsible for the Saint Confucian Sect.

If such a thing happened, the sect master would definitely blame him!

“Qin Yu...” Elder Qu clenched his fists.

He had never thought Qin Yu would dare to start a massacre within the Saint Confucian Sect!

He had never thought Qin Yu would have such destructive power!

“Oh no, Qin Yu is charging towards the main hall!” After a cry of alarm, he saw Qin Yu carrying a corpse in one hand as he charged towards the direction of the main hall!

That golden ray of light was incomparably dazzling. When mixed together with the scarlet blood, it was terrifying!
