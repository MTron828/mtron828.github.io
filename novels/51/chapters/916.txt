Chapter 917: Chapter 917: Monkey calls himself king 

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at Yu Qin, intending to ask if he could take him to see this old immortal.

But before Qin Yu could speak, Yu Qin whispered, “Unfortunately, this old immortal is very bad. He uses his own ability to bully us every day.”

“Oh?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

He suddenly thought of something and looked at the herbs in the basket.

“Are these herbs also for that old immortal?”Qin Yu asked.

Yu Qin said in surprise, “How do you know?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and didn’t answer.

It seemed that this so-called old immortal wasn’t very powerful.

Otherwise, these herbs wouldn’t be able to improve him at all.

“I’ll accompany you to deliver the herbs tonight,”Qin Yu said.

The smile on Yu Qin’s face suddenly became a little wider. She quickly nodded and said, “Okay!”

Then, Qin Yu continued to pick herbs with Yu Qin.

The two of them only went back in the evening.

Yu Qin seemed to be very happy. She kept chattering along the way and kept talking.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, seemed to be more depressed. He just nodded from time to time.

On the way back to his residence, Qin Yu followed Yu Qin to have dinner as usual.

The food in the village was good every day, and they had a clear division of labor.

Some people went to choose the vegetables, while others went hunting.

After the meal, they sang and danced as usual. This time, Qin Yu was not in a hurry to leave, but blended in.

After a round of fun, everyone could not help but gasp.

“Xiao Qin, the old immortal hasn’t made things difficult for you recently, has He?”At this time, the old man in the village walked to Yu Qin’s side.

Yu Qin said softly, “He... didn’t make things difficult for me.”

“Really?”The old man frowned slightly, as if he didn’t quite believe it.

Seeing that Yu Qin didn’t speak, the old man sighed and said, “I’ll go and talk to him again tomorrow.”

“En!”Yu Qin nodded and said, “Then uncle Lin, we’ll go back first.”

After saying goodbye to Uncle Lin, Qin Yu followed Yu Qin back to the residence.

After returning, Yu Qin sorted out the herbs as usual and prepared to give them to the old immortal.

It was not until ten o’clock in the evening that Yu Qin was done sorting out.

“Do you really want to go with me?”Yu Qin asked carefully.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Of course. I have already promised you. Let’s go.”

“Yes, yes!”Yu Qin nodded excitedly.

The two of them left the house together and rushed towards the old Immortal’s residence.

Along the way, Qin Yu used his divine sense to cover the nearby area, searching for the old immortal’s figure.

After a full half a day, Qin Yu finally found the old immortal’s figure.

“Grandmaster?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

This realm was not worth mentioning in front of Qin Yu, but among ordinary people, it was indeed a top-notch existence.

“It’s in front.”Yu Qin pointed at a residential house not far away and said.

She said worriedly, “No matter what happens later, you... you don’t say anything, understand?”

“Okay,”Qin Yu answered casually.

Yu Qin grunted and took a deep breath. Then, she rushed to the old immortal’s residence.

Qin Yu followed behind her and entered the room.

As soon as she entered, Qin Yu saw a bald old man.

The old man sat cross-legged on the bed with his hands clasped together as if he was cultivating.

“Old immortal, the herbs are here,”Yu Qin said softly as she placed the herbs beside him.

After hearing Yu Qin’s voice, the old immortal opened his eyes.

“Who is this person?”The old immortal’s gaze landed on Qin Yu.

“He... He is my friend,”Yu Qin explained.

The old immortal snorted and said, “Alright, come and give me a massage.”

Yu Qin frowned slightly. She subconsciously looked at Qin Yu as if she was embarrassed.

“What are you still standing there for!”At this moment, the old immortal suddenly shouted and slapped Yu Qin in the face!

Yu Qin covered her face aggrievedly and walked towards the old immortal.

But at this moment, Qin Yu grabbed Yu Qin’s arm.

Yu Qin was stunned and she looked at Qin Yu suspiciously.

Qin Yu ignored her and looked at the old immortal coldly. He said, “You Old Baldy, you really know how to play tricks. Old Immortal, I think you are an old fart.”

Hearing this, the old immortal was furious!

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You dare to disrespect me, that is disrespectful to the heavens. I must punish you on behalf of the Heavens!”

After saying that, the old immortal used the same trick again and slapped at Qin Yu!

However, before the internal Qi he released could even get close to Qin Yu, it instantly vanished into thin air.

“There really is no tiger in the mountain. A monkey calls himself the king. He is just a grandmaster, yet he dares to flaunt his power and oppress the common people,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The old immortal’s expression changed slightly. He narrowed his eyes and said, “You actually know of a Grandmaster? It seems that we are of the same path. Friend, I advise you to mind your own business.”

“Qin Yu, you... Don’t provoke him. There will be trouble...”Yu Qin said softly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Trouble? In My Eyes, he is like a chicken or a dog.”

The old immortal said with extreme displeasure, “Friend, watch your words. I respect that you are on the same path, but don’t be ungrateful.”

Qin Yu ignored this sentence and said indifferently, “You should have obtained some secret treasure, right? Hand it over, and maybe I can consider letting you die a quick death.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

A trace of panic flashed across the old immortal’s face, and his face quickly turned cold.

He slowly got up from the bed and sneered, “Since you already know, then I can’t let you leave alive.”

“Kid, today I’ll let you see the power of a Grandmaster!”

With a roar, the internal Qi on his body began to rise rapidly!

Then, he clenched his fists and condensed the internal Qi into his fists. Then, he smashed his fists at Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu, be careful!”Seeing this, Yu Qin was so anxious that her forehead was full of sweat.

She subconsciously ran to Qin Yu and tried to block the fists for him.
