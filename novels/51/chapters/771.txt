Xia Hang knew nothing about this.

Qin Yu walked all the way to Xia Hang, and at this moment, he suddenly stopped.

“What’s wrong?” Xia Hang asked.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his brows immediately furrowed.

Before Xia Hang could continue to ask, Qin Yu said in a low voice, “Hit me.”

“Huh?” Xia Hang was instantly stunned.

“Hurry up and hit me! Don’t talk nonsense!” Qin Yu said angrily.

After saying that, Qin Yu took the lead to hold the golden light in his hand and threw a punch at Xia Hang!

This punch directly shattered Xia Hang’s chest! His entire body was sent flying!

Following that, Qin Yu held the golden light in his hand and said coldly, “Xia Hang, you dare to ask me out alone? As if you are my opponent?!”

Xia Hang lay on the ground in extreme pain.

He kept spitting out blood from his mouth while looking extremely miserable.

With Xia Hang’s strength, he was not Qin Yu’s opponent at all. He didn’t even have the strength to fight back!

Before Xia Hang could react, Qin Yu had already walked over!

He grabbed Xia Hang by the collar and threw him in a certain direction!

This direction was where the purple-robed man was hiding!

“Oh no!” The purple-robed man’s expression changed. He quickly stood up and disappeared from Qinggang Mountain at an extremely fast speed.

Only after he completely disappeared did Qin Yu put away the murderous aura on his body.

After making sure that there was no one around, Qin Yu pulled Xia Hang up.

He placed his palm on Xia Hang’s chest and injected his spiritual energy into it.

After a full ten minutes, the wound on Xia Hang’s chest eased up slightly.

“You... What’s going on?” Xia Hang couldn’t help but ask angrily.

“I really thought you were going to kill me just now!”

Qin Yu looked around and said coldly, “You’ve been targeted by someone.”

“What?” Xia Hang’s expression instantly changed.

Qin Yu stepped on the ground and said, “Someone was hiding here just now.”

“If I don’t do this, you will definitely be exposed.”

Xia Hang’s expression immediately became a bit ugly.

If this matter was exposed, he would definitely die!

“Think about it. Who is suspecting you?” Qin Yu frowned.

Xia Hang frowned. He thought for a moment, then shook his head and said, “I don’t know, I really can’t figure it out.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “There’s no rush. Since they sent someone to follow you, I think they will definitely find trouble with you in the next few days. When that time comes, you will naturally know who it is.”

Xia Hang frowned and said, “But... if I didn’t die at your hands, I’m afraid it wouldn’t make sense.”

Qin Yu didn’t think of this.

He rubbed his chin and walked around, then said, “If anyone asks, just say that you promised to give me a stalk of herbs, so I spared your life.”

“At the same time, after you go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association tomorrow, immediately find someone to collect the herbs and take the initiative to make trouble. Tell them about what happened tonight.”

Xia Hang nodded and said, “Okay, I got it.”

“If there’s anything next time, I’ll look for you,” Qin Yu reminded him.

Xia Hang grunted and agreed, “I understand.”

“Let’s get down to business.” Qin Yu sat on a piece of gravel.

Xia Hang said in a deep voice, “Today, the higher-ups found me for a meeting. This meeting is about you.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and signaled Xia Hang to continue.

Xia Hang said, “They won’t make a move against you for the time being. I guess they’re waiting for Granny Qin.”

“As expected.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

These higher-ups were quite cautious.

“That’s not the point.” At this time, Xia Hang changed the topic.

“According to my probing today, these eight higher-ups can’t make a move personally.”

Then, Xia Hang told Qin Yu the whole story.

After Qin Yu heard it, his brows immediately furrowed.

Not only had no one seen them, but these eight higher-ups couldn’t even personally make a move. What was the reason?

“Maybe Granny Qin knows the secret,” Xia Hang reminded.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and nodded. “Since they can’t personally make a move, I’m relatively safe for the time being.”

If those eight higher-ups made a move personally, Qin Yu probably had no chance of survival.

“Oh right, how is Granny Qin now?” Qin Yu asked.

Xia Hang said, “She probably wouldn’t wake up in a short period of time. According to the news, that palm almost took Granny Qin’s life.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

The one who made a move was a Guardian! His strength was even above that of a Mighty Realm powerhouse. How could a peak Martial Marquis be compared to him?

“Alright, I understand.” Qin Yu stood up and said.

“You can go back. Remember, find out who is suspecting you as soon as possible.”

Xia Hang nodded and said, “Alright, I understand.”

After parting with Xia Hang, Qin Yu turned around and left Mount Qinggang.

The next day.

Qin Yu left Jingdu with the man with the mustache and rushed toward the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

He arrived at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. The moment he stepped through the door, countless pharmacists swarmed over.

“Elder Qin, you’re back!” A group of pharmacists rushed forward and surrounded Qin Yu in the middle.

“Qin Yu, you’ve been in the limelight recently.” At this moment, the Fifth Elder also walked over.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Fifth Elder, don’t joke with me.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I’m not joking with you.” The Fifth Elder rolled his eyes.

“Back then, I saw that you were a talent, but I really didn’t expect that you could grow to this stage.”

Qin Yu laughed embarrassedly and then asked, “Oh right, where is the Pavilion Master?”

“She’s waiting for you at the Pavilion Master’s building,” said the Fifth Elder.

Qin Yu grunted and quickly walked towards the Pavilion Master’s building.

He came to the Pavilion Master’s building.

Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and said, “Wait for me here. I’ll come down later.”

The man with the mustache impatiently waved his hand and said, “Alright, I got it. Don’t bother me anymore.”

His eyes looked around with greed.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with him. He immediately stomped his feet and arrived at the Pavilion Master’s building.

At the edge of the Pavilion Master’s building, the Pavilion Master and Jiang He were drinking tea.

Qin Yu walked forward quickly and bowed, “Greetings, Pavilion Master, and senior Jiang.”

“Sit.” The Pavilion Master waved her hand.

Qin Yu sat directly opposite the Pavilion Master and said with a smile, “Pavilion Master, what do you need me to do? Feel free to ask.”

However, the Pavilion Master didn’t pay attention to this question. Instead, she said indifferently, “The battle between you and the Heaven Swallowing Python was truly mind-blowing.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, “I’m currently worrying. Once the Heaven Swallowing Python recovers, it will definitely attack again.”

“I have no way to deal with the power of the Martial Saint that he controls.”

When the Pavilion Master heard this, she couldn’t help but laugh. “Then why don’t you run?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. “Run? I only need to win to see Yan Ruoxue. If I miss this opportunity, I don’t know when I will be able to see her again.”

When they heard this, the Pavilion Master and Jiang He couldn’t help but look at each other and smile.

When he saw this scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but say with some surprise, “Pavilion Master, do you have any ideas?”
