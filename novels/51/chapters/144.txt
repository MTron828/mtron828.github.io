Su Bo got up from the ground and stared at the cell phone in the person-in-charge’s hand.

He had completely panicked at this point.

“You still won’t admit it?” The Deputy Chief’s expression was extremely cold.

“You’re really stubborn.” Yu Jin snatched the cell phone and pressed the play button.

A recording was played from the phone.

“Qin Yu is a good-for-nothing. A good-for-nothing actually dared to disobey me. How can I let him go just like that?!”

“Don’t worry, I’m the elite of the Military District. I have connections with powerful people! Who would dare to go against me?”

“This time, I want Qin Yu to kneel in front of me and beg me. Otherwise, I will shut his factory down!”

When they heard these recordings, everyone’s expressions turned extremely gloomy.

Meanwhile, anger appeared on the Deputy Chief’s face.

“Embarrassing, this is simply embarrassing!” The Deputy Chief said furiously!

“Chuzhou Region actually has such a scum. I have been completely humiliated by you!”

Upon seeing the Deputy Chief’s attitude, Su Bo fell to his knees with a plop!

He begged miserably, “Deputy Chief, I didn’t know that Qin Yu was our honored guest. I... was wrong...”

“From what you said, if I was just an ordinary person, I deserved to be messed with by you, right?” Qin Yu questioned coldly.

“No... No, I absolutely didn’t mean that!” Su Bo hurriedly waved his hand.

He gritted his teeth and said, “It’s all Su Yan’s fault! It was Su Yan who asked me to do this. She said that she wanted me to take revenge for her. It has nothing to do with me!”

“Someone without morals or a sense of responsibility doesn’t deserve to stay in the Military District,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Commander Guo immediately took a step forward and said, “Qin Yu, don’t worry. I will immediately expel him from the Military District and take legal action!”

“No... Don’t. I know I’m wrong. Sir, please forgive me for once...” Su Bo begged desperately.

It wasn’t easy for him to reach where he was today. He was naturally unwilling to return to his original state.

But unfortunately, the Deputy Chief couldn’t give him a chance.

“Take him out quickly. He’s a disgrace!” The Deputy Chief said coldly.

As soon as he said that, a few soldiers came forward and grabbed Su Bo’s arm before bringing him to the car.

“Qin Yu, I’m really sorry. I didn’t expect there to be such a scum in the Military District. Sorry for the trouble.” The Deputy Chief personally walked forward and shook hands with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu said politely, “Deputy Chief, you’re too courteous. Please take a seat in the room.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Okay.” The Deputy Chief didn’t stand on ceremony. He nodded and followed Qin Yu into the office.

After the Deputy Chief entered and sat down, Qin Yu personally brewed a cup of tea for them.

“Sigh, I originally wanted to invite you to join the Chuzhou Region of the Military District. Now, I don’t even have the nerve to say this.” The Deputy Chief rubbed the teacup and shook his head.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Deputy Chief, that has nothing to do with this matter. I don’t want to go to the Military District for the time being. Thank you for your kind intentions.”

The Deputy Chief didn’t insist any further. He nodded and then changed the topic, “Qin Yu, your Soul Nourishment Pill is a key project in the province. Rumor has it that the Soul Nourishment Pill has been taken to the province to be a model for research!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu said with some surprise, “Deputy Chief, is what you said true?”

“Of course!” The Deputy Chief laughed out loud.

Mr. Yang, who was beside him, also hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, this officer is right. Do you still remember the Chinese Medical Conference?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “To tell you the truth, I came to the factory this time for the Chinese Medical Conference.”

Mr. Yang heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “That’s good. That’s good. I have submitted the information to you.”

The Deputy Chief asked in surprise, “The Chinese Medicine Conference?”

“Chief, you also know about the Chinese Medicine Conference?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

The Deputy Chief laughed out loud and said, “Of course. Although the Chinese medicine world has declined over the years, the higher-ups still attach great importance to this Chinese Medicine Conference.”

At this point, the Deputy Chief looked at Commander Guo and said, “If he submits the Soul Nourishment Pill, Qin Yu should be able to get a guaranteed spot in the finals, right?”

Commander Guo shook his head and said, “Deputy Chief, I don’t know much about this...”

The Deputy Chief muttered, “I’ll ask around when I get back.”

Qin Yu, looking a little embarrassed, scratched his head.

“I really didn’t expect that a mere Soul Nourishment Pill would cause such a big impact,” Qin Yu muttered inside.

“Qin Yu, you must have put in a lot of effort for this Soul Nourishment Pill, right?” The Deputy Chief asked casually.

Qin Yu said somewhat awkwardly, “To tell you the truth, this Soul Nourishment Pill was only casually refined by me...”

This wasn’t false. The Soul Nourishment Pill was only the simplest pill in Qin Yu’s inherited alchemy methods handbook. It wasn’t worth mentioning at all.

The Deputy Chief smiled. It was obvious that he didn’t believe it.

But he didn’t say anything. In the Deputy Chief’s opinion, it wasn’t a bad thing for a young man to have some vanity.

Half an hour later, the Deputy Chief and the others were ready to leave the factory.

Before leaving, the Deputy Chief warned, “Qin Yu, you have to work harder in the future. I have high hopes for you.”

“Yes, our Deputy Chief said that you might become the second Ye Qing!” Yu Jin said with a wink.

“Yu Jin!” Commander Guo frowned slightly and glared at Yu Jin.

Yu Jin stuck out his tongue and quickly covered his mouth.

They didn’t stay any longer. After saying goodbye, they left the factory.

Qin Yu touched his chin and whispered, “Ye Qing... how come I’ve never heard of this name?”

After returning to the office, Qin Yu looked at Mr. Yang and asked, “When will the Chinese Medical Conference begin?”

Mr. Yang quickly said, “I took the initiative to submi your information half a month ago. About a week later, the Chinese Medicine Conference will officially begin.”

Qin Yu nodded silently, then stood up and said, “Mr. Yang, I’ll have to trouble you to help guide me when the time comes.”

Mr. Yang hurriedly waved his hand and said, “You must be joking. Your achievements are far above mine. You should be the one to guide me.”

These people who were obsessed with a certain academic field were like this. They didn’t care about age, and only cared about achievements.

For example, Mr. Yang, and Yu Jin.

Qin Yu didn’t stay in the factory for long, and soon returned to Dragon Paradise Villa.

When he returned home, Qin Yu found that Sun Yumei and the members of the Su family were actually standing at the door.

“What are they doing here?” Qin Yu frowned slightly and then walked over quickly.

“What are you doing at my house?” Qin Yu asked with a cold expression.

When he saw Qin Yu, Su Wu suddenly seemed to have gone crazy as he rushed towards Qin Yu.

“You b*stard, you actually ruined my son’s career! Do you know how much effort my son put into it?!” Su Wu gnashed his teeth and said.

When he heard Su Wu’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“Your son didn’t live up to expectations, but now, you blame it on me?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“F * ck you, you have to take responsibility!” Su Wu gritted his teeth and said.

Su Wen also said fiercely, “Not only did you harm my daughter, but now, you also want to harm my nephew. Because of you, the Su family is in turmoil now. How are you going to take responsibility for it?!”
