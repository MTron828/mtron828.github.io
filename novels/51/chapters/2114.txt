2115 The Terrifying Living Beings in the Nine Sanctums

Si Liuhe was silent. Obviously, he was not interested in the so-called Holy Lord position.

Just as Xiao Sheng had said, those who were truly ambitious in such a great era would not be obsessed with power. Their ambition was more to comprehend the dao and step into the peak of cultivation.

“Right now, I urgently need to retreat. Therefore, I can’t take up the position of Holy Lord. Si Shiyu is so conceited, so he’s unsuitable for the Holy Lord position,” Si Shiyue continued.

Si Liuhe nodded thoughtfully. After being silent for a while, he said slowly, “In that case, I’ll temporarily assume the position of Holy Lord. When the Si family settles down, I’ll select a new successor.”

Upon hearing this, Si Shiyue’s expression changed, and he quickly said, “Thank you, Grandmaster.”

Following that, Si Liuhe gathered all the higher-ups of the Si family and listened to everything that had happened recently.

“Now that the Traceless Immortal Scripture has fallen into Qin Yu’s hands and Thunderous Courtyard has stepped in to save him, we have no way to deal with Qin Yu,” an elder of the Si family said in a deep voice.

“That’s right. No one knows what Qin Yu has obtained from the Chaos Grave, but he must have gained a lot. In a short period of time, he broke through from the middle stage of Reversion Void to the Semi-Saint.”

“The Si family nowadays isn’t the same as before. An elder insisted on burning his blood essence but was stopped by the Holy Lord. Everyone is waiting for you to come out and take charge of the situation.”

Si Liuhe did not say a word upon hearing what everyone said.

He held a cup of tea and took a sip before slowly putting it down.

“Thunder Courtyard… I’ll personally pay a visit. As for the Si family, perhaps it’s time to do something,” Si Liuhe finally spoke after a long time.

Although he sounded incomparably calm, every word and sentence exuded an unparalleled dominance.

Everyone was startled, then cupped their hands and said, “Please make the decision, Holy Lord!”

As Si Liuhe had stepped into the True Saint Realm, he was naturally confident.

It was no exaggeration to say that he now had the confidence and ability to go anywhere in this starry sky!

In the following few days, numerous people visited Si Liuhe to congratulate him. For a while, the crowd in the Si family was in an uproar, and the Si family was thrust into the eye of the storm.

The news that Si Liuhe personally assumed the position of the Holy Lord was like a heavyweight bombshell, causing a tremendous upheaval within the Holy Region.

Although some people were worried about Qin Yu, most were filled with awe toward Si Liuhe. After all, he was a True Saint and powerful enough to intimidate the entire Holy Region.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Jue Wu had fled back to Thunder Courtyard.

The three gathered in Dean Lei’s dao enlightenment room, playing chess and drinking tea.

Jue Wu was, as usual, laid back and did not take the matter seriously. She ate, drank, and had fun all day.

Qin Yu was startled and could not help but smile bitterly.

“This physique is indeed terrifying.” Qin Yu felt a little helpless.

Jue Wu indulged in eating, drinking, and having fun all day long, and did not care about anything, but her cultivation speed was tremendously terrifying.

Dean Lei seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s thoughts. He held a black piece in his hand and slowly placed it down. “Jue Wu’s cultivation speed is so fast. Perhaps it’s not only because of her unique physique but also her state of mind.”

“State of mind?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

“Jue Wu’s dao mind is clear, and she’s not indecisive or worried about gains and losses.”

Qin Yu was silent.

These words seemed to be talking about Jue Wu, but in reality, pointing at Qin Yu.

Compared to Jue Wu’s simplicity, Qin Yu seemed to be much more complicated. In the long run, it was very likely to become an obstacle on his path of cultivation.

“Dean Lei, aren’t you worried about Si Liuhe?” Qin Yu asked.

“So what if I’m worried or not worried? Regardless if you’re worried or not, what can you change?”

“That may be the case, but…”

“Don’t do meaningless things.” Dean Lei interrupted Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked at Dean Lei thoughtfully. He knew Dean Lei’s words made sense. He should not entangle in things that could not change. It would only waste time and energy.

“I understand now.” Qin Yu nodded as a hint of determination flashed in his eyes.

On the other end, almost everyone in the Holy Region fixed their gazes on Si Liuhe as if they wanted to see what he would do next.

“The Si family has always wanted to get rid of Qin Yu, but there’s Dean Lei. Thus they haven’t been able to make a move.”

“I’m afraid it won’t be the same this time. Si Liuhe has emerged. He’s now a True Saint born in the Golden Age.”

“That’s Si Liuhe! The awe-inspiring figure back then! He was almost invincible and greatly contributed to the Si family!”

“Since Thunder Courtyard did not respect the Si family, how could Si Liuhe not get back at them?”

Compared to Dean Lei, everyone seemed to have been more optimistic about Si Liuhe.

After all, Si Liuhe was so famous back then. He was nearly invincible, equivalent to Xiao Sheng of Nanzhou.

Although Dean Lei was still in peak condition, he was not as strong as Si Liuhe, who was younger and stronger.

Several days passed in the blink of an eye, but Si Liuhe still did not make a move. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This made people wonder if Si Liuhe was afraid and did not dare to find trouble with Dean Lei at all.

A few more days passed.

Si Liuhe, quiet all this time, finally left the Si family.

However, he did not go to Thunder Courtyard but to the Chaos Grave.

Terrifying internal qi was still rippling around the Chaos Grave.

The nine sanctums were shining brightly, and each was tremendously mysterious.

These were the nine sanctums that Wu Ji left behind, each shining with a very different light, representing nine different dao techniques. They were mysterious and unfathomable.

However, every sanctum had incredibly terrifying living beings, so no one dared to approach them.

Numerous tomb slaves were standing in the tomb. They were like walking corpses but mastered terrifying power because they had become a part of the dao technique in the tomb.

The living beings in the nine sanctums were all born from the dao techniques in the Chaos Grave. They were like the guardians of the sanctums, and each possessed terrifying power.

Their bodies were huge, and they were all like ancient divine beasts. Their bodies contained the formidable power of the dao techniques. Some could control lightning, and their every move would cause lightning to vibrate. Some could travel through time and space at will as if they had god-like abilities.

Their eyes flickered with a cold light as if they could see through everything, leaving people no place to hide. They could spit out all kinds of terrifying attacks from their mouths. Regardless of scorching flames or bone-piercing ice, they could instantly kill the enemy.
