2005 Uncle Yan versus Yan Guyun

Jue Wu, who had powerful combat power, was actually directly sent flying by a thought from him!

What realm had Yan Guyun stepped into? Could it be a True Saint?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed drastically!

Now that Yan Guyun had taken away her last trump card, Qin Yu had no chance of winning!

“Third Princess, are you alright?” Yan Guyun asked.

The third princess, who was always unruly, appeared somewhat calm in front of Yan Guyun. She only nodded.

“Take the third princess to the side and protect her well,” Yan Guyun said lightly.

“Yes!”

The few people beside him immediately brought the third princess to the side and used a secret technique to protect her. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s expression was tremendously ugly. From the conversation between Yan Guyun and the third princess, one could see that Yan Guyun had a very high status in the Yan family. Even in front of the third princess, he was neither overbearing nor self-effacing.

“D*mn it!”

At this moment, Jue Wu had already rushed over. She didn’t care about Yan Guyun’s strength and status at all and was about to attack.

Qin Yu hurriedly stopped Jue Wu and shook his head. “No, this Yan Guyun is not someone we can deal with.”

“I don’t care who he is!” Jue Wu said fiercely.

“Listen to me!” Qin Yu scolded. “Don’t die in vain!”

After saying this, Qin Yu looked at Yan Guyun.

He took a deep breath and cupped his hands. “Senior, this matter has nothing to do with Jue Wu. Can you let her leave first? She is the closed-door disciple of Dean Lei.”

“Are you trying to scare me with Dean Lei?” Yan Guyun raised his eyebrows.

“I don’t dare…” Qin Yu instantly felt even more uneasy.

“This matter has nothing to do with Jue Wu. I will bear the responsibility for everything!”

“Bear my a*s!” Jue Wu couldn’t care less. Her body glowed with purple light, and she immediately rushed toward Yan Guyun!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically upon seeing this, and he hurriedly shouted, “No!”

However, it was too late. Jue Wu held the purple light in her hand and charged directly at Yan Guyun!

Yan Guyun’s expression was incredibly calm. Looking at Jue Wu, he snorted, waved his sleeve, and a powerful energy surged out!

“Bang!”

As expected, the purple light on Jue Wu’s body was instantly destroyed as soon as they came into contact. Her body was also sent flying!

When Qin Yu saw this, he hurriedly got up and held Jue Wu. But even so, Qin Yu still suffered a huge impact and only stabilized his body after a long time!

“What a terrifying power!” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

He looked at Jue Wu in his arms. Jue Wu was covered in blood, and her internal qi was weak.

Such strength could not help but shock people!

Just a casual wave of his hand had shaken Jue Wu into severe injuries. It was truly terrifying!

Without hesitation, Qin Yu hurriedly sent spiritual energy to Jue Wu. Fortunately, Yan Guyun didn’t kill her, so Jue Wu’s life wasn’t in danger.

“She was the one who attacked me first. Even Dean Lei can’t do anything to me,” Yan Guyun said lightly.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He walked forward and said, “Senior, I will bear all the consequences. Please send Jue Wu to Thunder Courtyard…”

“Oh?” Yan Guyun smiled faintly. He put his hands behind his back and said, “You dare to attack the third princess, which is a capital crime. No one can save you.”

“You want to kill me?” Qin Yu was feeling uneasy.

Yan Guyun didn’t hide his thoughts. He nodded and said, “That’s right.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I’m sorry then. I won’t sit still and wait for death.”

“Oh?” Yan Guyun raised his eyebrows. His eyes were full of contempt as if he was looking down at an ant.

“Even if you’re incredibly powerful, I still want to try,” Qin Yu said coldly.

With that, the Golden Light on Qin Yu’s body instantly erupted, and he adjusted his internal qi to the extreme!

Then Qin Yu stepped on the line word formula and rushed toward Yan Guyun!

He clenched the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch and unleashed all his strength!

However, Yan Guyun did not move at all. Looking at the approaching Qin Yu, his body emitted a thin layer of light.

“Bang!”

As soon as Qin Yu’s fist came into contact, he was immediately counterattacked by a powerful force, and his body flew backward!

Not only did his punch fail to break Yan Guyun’s defense, but it also made him spit blood!

“How terrifying…” Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth, and his expression became even more shocked!

What kind of strength was this? It was so terrifying!

Qin Yu was unwilling to give up. He charged at Yan Guyun again, unleashing all his secret techniques and bombarding Yan Guyun.

Unfortunately, none of the techniques could break through Yan Guyun’s defense.

He stood there without moving, allowing Qin Yu to attack.

In just a while, Qin Yu was almost exhausted.

He panted heavily, a trace of despair emerging from the bottom of his heart.

...

“He is too strong. I have no chance of winning…” Qin Yu murmured in a trembling voice.

It was the first time he had felt such despair. Yan Guyun was like an insurmountable mountain that no one could shake.

“Is it over?” Yan Guyun said lightly.

Qin Yu’s expression was ugly, but he did not say a thing.

Yan Guyun sighed. He raised his hand and said, “Then it’s my turn.”

As he raised his palm, a terrifying power that could overturn the heavens and earth surged!

Everything in the surroundings was instantly destroyed. Even though far away, one could still feel the powerful sense of oppression!

Under this sense of oppression, Qin Yu could not even move!

“Senior, I still have something to say!” At the critical moment of life and death, Qin Yu hurriedly shouted!

Unfortunately, Yan Guyun didn’t care. He raised his hand and said, “You have nothing to say.”

After saying that, the big hand pressed down in Qin Yu’s direction!

...

A destructive force immediately approached Qin Yu! Before the palm reached him, Qin Yu had been pressed to the ground!

The Golden Light on his body instantly crushed, and his bones made cracking sounds!

Once this palm landed, he would die without a doubt!

At this moment, an enormous hand reached out from the dark and headed toward Yan Guyun!

“Boom!”

At the moment of collision, a terrifying power swept out, and the void collapsed bit by bit!

When the light fell, a middle-aged man stood opposite Qin Yu.

“Yan… Uncle Yan!” Qin Yu was shocked! He didn’t expect the person who attacked to be Uncle Yan!

Not far away, Yan Guyun was not surprised. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Yan Pingnan, you finally showed up.”

Uncle Yan smiled, then cupped his hands and said, “It seems you have already noticed me.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly again.

Yan Guyun’s status was even higher than Uncle Yan’s! The Yan family actually sent such an existence!
