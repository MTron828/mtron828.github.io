1805 The Secret of the Forbidden Zone

Qin Yu devoured Zhong Wenyi’s primordial spirit mercilessly. Jue Wu, standing beside him, didn’t say a word as well. It was as if she was already used to this

After devouring her primordial spirit, the surroundings began to resume slowly.

“How are you feeling now?” Jue Wu asked.

“Mmm, much better,” Qin Yu said.

“That’s good. Let’s go. Otherwise, they’ll suspect us,” Jue Wu said.

!!

Qin Yu followed Jue Wu and quickly caught up with Gu Sanchen and Yang Yu.

At this moment, Gu Sanchen and Yang Yu were chatting happily. As Gu Sanchen was very curious about the Forbidden Zone, he kept asking questions.

As a result, they did not notice anything unusual at all.

Yang Yu only stopped after walking for a long time.

He turned around and looked at the back. He frowned and said, “That’s strange. Where’s Zhong Wenyi?”

Jue Wu glanced at him and said, “Are you asking me? How would I know?”

Yang Yu’s brows furrowed even more. He released his divine sense covering the surroundings, trying to find Zhong Wenyi’s traces but in vain.

However, Zhong Wenyi had been killed by Jue Wu, and there was no trace of her internal qi.

“Strange! She’s not here,” Yang Yu said in a low voice.

“Maybe she’s gone,” Qin Yu said casually.

Although Yang Yu had doubts in his heart, he didn’t say much.

At this moment, they were getting closer to the Forbidden Zone. Yang Yu suddenly stopped, pointed to the front, and said, “Forbidden Zone is less than one star away from here. No one can enter that place, so it’s best we stop here.”

Gu Sanchen shook his head and said, “I’m here for the Forbidden Zone. Please lead the way.”

“Are you serious?” Yang Yu asked. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Of course,” Gu Sanchen replied with a smile.

Yang Yu didn’t say anything else and continued to lead the way.

The closer they were to the Forbidden Zone, the more uneasy everyone felt.

This feeling came from the bottom of their hearts and was difficult to restrain. It was as if being stared at by a hungry beast, and there was a dagger at the back.

Everything in the surroundings was blood red. They were as if stepping into hell. It was extremely terrifying.

Although Qin Yu was very interested in the Forbidden Zone, he knew he would never have the chance to enter it.

Therefore, all his thoughts were on Yang Yu, and all he could think about was how to kill him.

At this point, Yang Yu suddenly stopped.

There was a small ditch in front of him. It was like a boundary that separated two vast lands.

“Forbidden Zone is in front,” Yang Yu said in a deep voice.

Standing at the edge of the Forbidden Zone, Qin Yu could clearly feel the terrifying internal qi coming out of it.

This internal qi was even more intense than killing intent. It made people tremble in fear.

Qin Yu tried to activate his desolate divine eye to find out what was going on there. Unfortunately, his desolate divine eye’s vision was instantly blocked, and he could not see anything.

This place seemed even more terrifying than the Dragon Burial Cave.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Sanchen as if waiting for his next move.

Naturally, Gu Sanchen did not dare to step into it hastily. He flipped his palm and took out a few runes.

These runes emitted a dark radiance in his hand.

Following that, Gu Sanchen bit his palm and dripped a drop of blood on them.

In an instant, another Gu Sanchen formed in front of him!

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but exclaim, “Is this a clone?”

Gu Sanchen glanced at Qin Yu, shook his head, and said, “It’s not exactly a clone. It only has a bit of divine sense and biological instincts. It won’t be able to go too far.”

Then Gu Sanchen urged the clone to step into the Forbidden Zone.

The clone was walking in the Forbidden Zone. As he went further step by step, he did not seem to encounter any abnormalities.

Soon, the clone could no longer be seen clearly as if he had already stepped into the depths of the Forbidden Zone.

The group remained silent, waiting for Gu Sanchen’s further action.

After a while, Gu Sanchen opened his eyes.

“I can’t feel anything in this Forbidden Zone,” he said in a low voice, frowning.

“Eh? How did this happen?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“This forbidden zone is full of danger,” Yang Yu explained. “Maybe we can take a few more steps forward.”

Gu Sanchen was silent. He was unwilling to take the risk, so he created another clone to walk into the Forbidden Zone.

This time, Gu Sanchen’s brows furrowed even tighter.

“How is it?” Qin Yu asked.

Gu Sanchen shook his head and said, “I still can’t see anything. This clone could only walk a short distance. Perhaps this part of the road is safe.”

“I think so, too,” Yang Yu said.

“You guys follow me,” Gu Sanchen said in a deep voice. “We’ll enter the Forbidden Zone together.

“Of course, I won’t force you if you don’t want to go in.”

After saying this, Gu Sanchen’s body suddenly started to glow.

The light gathered on his body and finally formed a divine robe.

A wave of Holy Power instantly spread out.

“Eh? It’s a Saint Weapon!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

There were many Saint Weapons left in this world. Most of them were offensive, and defensive ones such as this were rare.

Gu Sanchen stepped into the Forbidden Zone without hesitation.

“How is it? Are we going in?” Jue Wu asked.

Qin Yu remained silent. He was a little conflicted.

His intuition told him that danger lurked in every corner of this Forbidden Zone, and he had a slim chance of survival.

But at this time, Yang Yu quickly followed.

Therefore, if he wanted to kill Yang Yu, he could only follow him.

“Let’s go,” Qin Yu said.

Qin Yu thus followed him and strode toward the Forbidden Zone.

Shi San, who had remained silent the entire time, turned around and left without hesitation.

He didn’t plan to enter the Forbidden Zone. Instead, he planned to scout around the area.

…

It was scarlet red in the Forbidden Zone, and there seemed to be a faint mist in between.

Qin Yu could not help but think of the chaotic qi. The two seemed to be very similar.

There were many terrifying stone statues in the surroundings. The stone statues’ eyes were wide open as if they were glaring at them.

The four of them were very careful, like walking on thin ice.

However, there was nothing unusual in the surroundings. Other than the blood-red radiance, there was nothing strange.

Just then, Gu Sanchen stopped in his tracks.

“This is the furthest I’ve walked,” he said in a deep voice. “I don’t know what will happen if we go any further.”

After saying that, Gu Sanchen looked at Yang Yu and said, “Based on your experience, should we continue moving forward?”

Yang Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know. I’ve never stepped into the Forbidden Zone before. But we’ve observed it from the outside.

“The True Saints from those aristocratic families never appeared again after entering the Forbidden Zone. However, no one knows how far they went and how they died.”

Everyone was at a loss for a moment, not knowing what to do

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He looked at the vast Forbidden Zone. There was a tall mountain in the distance, but it looked extremely strange. It was like a big mountain that had flipped over.

“This mountain… Why is it so familiar?” Qin Yu murmured.

He thought hard and suddenly thought of something!

After that, Qin Yu took out the Venerable Fifth Mountain directly.
