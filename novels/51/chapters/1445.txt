Chapter 1446: Chapter 1446, absolute dance moves 1

It was a slender and beautiful figure, even a little petite.

She stood in front of Qin Yu and grabbed the light emitted by the demon subduing divine lamp. Then, she crushed it!

A huge explosion sounded nearby! The Void was instantly shattered, revealing a large patch of black!

The terrifying Shockwave forced Qin Yu back, but at this moment, a hand grabbed Qin Yu’s arm.

“Damn it, you little bastard, you still dare to bully my meat cushion!”

A voice sounded, causing everyone to be shocked!

Opening their eyes, they saw that it was absolute dance!

Wen Da and Wen Er were below, shouting loudly, “Beat him to death, beat him to death!”

Qin Yu rubbed his eyes and said in surprise, “Jue Wu? Why are you here?”

Jue Wu glared at Qin Yu and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? Of course I’m here to save you!”

“It’s Jue Wu!”The surrounding people also recognized Jue Wu’s figure.

“Jue Wu, one of the three madmen, is actually here!”

“She crushed the demon subduing lamp with her bare hands? Is it that terrifying?”

For a moment, everyone was shocked!

They knew that Jue Wu’s strength was not ordinary, but they did not expect her to be so powerful!

Not far away, the Great Elder’s face was ashen. He gritted his teeth and was on the verge of collapse.

Just as he was about to kill Qin Yu, a Jue Wu suddenly jumped out!

“Jue Wu... This matter has nothing to do with you. You’d better stay out of it!”The Great Elder, who had lost his mind, was practically begging for mercy!

Jue Wu stared at her round eyes and said, “You Little Bastard, how dare you talk to me like that? Are you tired of living?”

The great elder roared angrily, “Whoever dares to stop me today will die! Even you can’t do it!”

With that said, the great elder grabbed the demon subduing divine lamp in his hands!

With the divine lamp in hand, the great elder was filled with confidence!

Jue Wu mocked, “Who are you trying to scare with a broken lamp? I heard that when I was in seclusion, you barged into my Hualing Mountain, right?”

The Great Elder’s face was gloomy, but he was still a little worried.

He knew that Jue Wu’s strength was not ordinary. He was definitely not a match for her.

Even with the demon subduing divine lamp in his hands, he was not completely confident.

The Great Elder took a deep breath and said, “Jue Wu, you better leave immediately. I must kill Qin Yu today.”

“F * ck your grandpa. Leave the divine lamp now and get lost. I might spare you,”Jue Wu snorted. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The first elder was completely enraged. He grabbed the divine lamp and roared, “If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being impolite. Go To Hell!”

Then, the first elder activated the divine lamp again, and the light on the divine lamp instantly appeared!

This time, the light emitted by the divine lamp was even more shocking, and its power was completely different!

Beams of light were emitted from the divine lamp, and the terrifying airwaves pressed down on people until they couldn’t breathe.

“Jue Wu, be careful,”Qin Yu said with a frown.

Jue Wu held her waist and snorted, “If I don’t beat him up today, he’ll be considered clean!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry for a moment.

At the moment, he didn’t have the ability to resist the divine lamp, so he retreated to the side.

“How are you? Are You Hurt?”Wen Da and Wen Er quickly came up to him.

Qin Yu looked at the cracks all over his body and said with a bitter smile, “What do you think?”

“Sigh, it’s good that you’re not dead. It’s nothing for a man to shed a little blood,”Wen da said with a wave of his hand.

Wen Er also nodded and said, “That’s right, that’s right.”

Zhuo Jing also quickly walked forward and said with a smile, “It just happened to be dangerous. If it wasn’t for the sudden appearance of the last dance, I’m afraid it would have been really dangerous.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. I also didn’t expect the last dance to appear at this time.”

In mid-air, the two rays of light emitted from the divine lamp grew increasingly intense and slowly intertwined in the void.

In less than half a second, the light actually transformed into a dragon, emitting waves of dragon roars!

Everyone was terrified, and some people even shot out for thousands of meters!

Only Jue Wu, who had her hands on her waist, did not panic in the slightest.

Qin Yu could not help but break out in cold sweat for Jue Wu.

There was naturally no need to doubt Jue Wu’s strength, but her crazy appearance always made people feel that she was somewhat unreliable.

“Go to hell!”

The first elder roared angrily. The dragon-shaped light on the divine lamp instantly tore through the void and headed straight for absolute dance!

Absolute dance raised her two small hands. Subsequently, rays of light rapidly gathered on her hands.

In a short moment, the two void hand seals appeared in the air.

Seeing that the dragon-shaped light was getting closer and closer, absolute dance finally made her move.

She waved her large hand and ruthlessly slapped the head of the dragon-shaped light seal!

A crisp “Pa”sound was extremely ear-piercing at this moment.

The Divine Dragon that was charging forward had actually been slapped to the side of its head!

Without waiting for everyone to be shocked, absolute dance slapped again.

After two consecutive slaps, the dragon-shaped light started to crack. Then, it started to shatter at an extremely fast speed!

“What is this? It’s so flashy.”

After finishing his final dance, he wrinkled his little nose.

At this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned.

This... This was the end?
