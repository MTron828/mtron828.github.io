The man with the mustache muttered, “What’s the rush? I’ve run so far. No matter what, you have to let me eat something.”

“Eat my ass. When the matter is done, I’ll treat you to whatever you want to eat.” Qin Yu tugged at the man with the mustache and said.

The man with the mustache still said unhappily, “Sigh, I don’t have the energy to work if I don’t eat...”

“Don’t you want to see that mask?” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Once this topic was brought up, the man with the mustache immediately became spirited.

He waved his hand and said, “Forget it, forget it. I don’t want to eat anymore. Let’s go!”

Thus, Qin Yu followed the man with the mustache and left the Green Moon Villa on the same day.

Not long after Qin Yu left, purple-robed men from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the people sent by the various aristocratic families arrived at the Green Moon Villa.

An extremely solemn aura lingered around the villa.

Several top-tier Martial Marquises stood on the square.

Even though they had restrained their internal qi, the aura on their bodies still sent chills down people’s spines. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Who... are you looking for?” Zhen Yue saw that these people weren’t to be trifled with, so he tried his best to ask politely.

“Where’s Qin Yu?” One of the purple-robed men asked coldly.

“Mr. Qin just left. He seems to be out to do some business,” said Zhen Yue.

The purple-robed man frowned slightly, and his body slowly floated up. Then, a terrifying spiritual sense directly covered the entire Green Moon Villa!

A few minutes later, the purple-robed man said coldly, “He’s not here.”

“How long has he been gone?” Then, someone looked at Zhen Yue.

Zhen Yue thought for a moment and said, “About half an hour.”

“Half an hour... He hasn’t gone far. Go after him!” One of the purple-robed men said.

The group immediately left the Jade Moon Villa to search for Qin Yu’s whereabouts.

... . .

At that moment, Qin Yu was following the man with the mustache to search for the last ingredient.

Pyro was a vast and abundant land, and the place they were heading to this time was located in the most desolate region in the northwest.

After taking the plane, they took the bus, and after taking the bus, they took the donkey cart.

After a long bumpy ride, the two of them arrived in a desert.

Standing at the edge of the desert, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a wave of heat.

“Are you sure the material that you mentioned is here?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

No matter how he looked at it, it didn’t seem like a place with treasures.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “I have already inspected it several times. Follow me.”

After saying that, the man with the mustache took out another compass.

He followed the direction on the compass and brought Qin Yu into the desert.

There was no one in the desert, only endless sandstorms.

The two of them walked in the desert for an entire day and night, but they still didn’t see the treasure that the man with the mustache was talking about. Instead, they felt that it was getting hotter and hotter.

“Is it reliable or not?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

The man with the mustache said impatiently, “What are you so anxious for? You can’t lose your patience. Come with me.”

Qin Yu had no choice but to follow the man with the mustache all the way until it was dark.

At noon the next day, the sun was shining brightly.

Qin Yu stood in the desert, his clothes wet with sweat.

“Why is it so hot...” Qin Yu wiped his sweat, feeling that his whole body was on fire.

The man with the mustache looked even more miserable. His face was flushed red from the heat, and he was dehydrated.

“We’re almost there. It’s just ahead,” the man with the mustache said weakly.

After another few miles, a big pit appeared in front of the two of them.

The closer they were to the big pit, the hotter their bodies became.

The man with the mustache panted and said, “It’s in that pit.”

Qin Yu supported his body and walked quickly to the front of the pit.

He saw that there was a flame burning in the pit!

The flame was extremely hot, and its temperature was many times higher than that of ordinary flames!

“It’s in here?” Qin Yu pointed at the pit with a doubtful look on his face.

“That’s right.” The man with the mustache wiped his sweat.

“This flame is known as True Fire. With my body, as long as I touch it, it will turn into thick water.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “True Fire? Is the temperature here so hot all because of this huge pit?”

“That’s right.” The man with the mustache nodded.

Qin Yu picked up a handful of sand from the ground and threw it into the fire pit.

The moment it touched, the sand immediately disappeared.

“What a high temperature!” Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

“Even with my physical body, I’m afraid I’ll be heavily injured if I jump down.”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “If it wasn’t difficult, I wouldn’t have let you come.”

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at the huge pit. He couldn’t see the end of it at a glance.

The heatwave coming from the front almost burned Qin Yu’s face.

“Why? Are you afraid?” The man with the mustache teased from the side.

“If you’re scared, it’s still not too late to back out.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and a hint of determination flashed across his face.

“In order to resurrect the two male corpses, I have to go down.” Qin Yu clenched his teeth.

He tried to put his hand into the flame. The moment he touched it, Qin Yu’s hand was directly swallowed by the flame!

The flame was extremely manic. In just a moment, it burned Qin Yu’s palm until the skin and flesh were split open!

“No.” Qin Yu hurriedly extinguished the flame.

He frowned and said, “If I jump down, I’m afraid I’ll die without a doubt.”

The man with the mustache spread his hands and said, “I’ve thought of many ways and tried to use magic artifacts to protect my body, but none of them worked.”

“All the magic artifacts can’t withstand this True Fire, so you can only rely on your special constitution.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “If my cultivation base had advanced one step further, I might have been able to walk out of this fire alive, but now... it’s impossible.”

The moment they touched, Qin Yu’s hand was almost burnt to a crisp, let alone jumping into this fire pit.

“Anyway, the thing is under this fire pit. If we can’t get it, we won’t be able to control the two male corpses,” the man with the mustache said with his hands spread out.

Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but turn ugly. For a moment, he was caught in a dilemma.

“If you really can’t do it, then give up.” The man with the mustache tugged at Qin Yu.

“Anyway, there are many ways to save people. We don’t have to rely on the two male corpses, do we?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, this is the fastest way.”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “Then jump down.”

Qin Yu stood in front of the fire pit and didn’t say anything for a long time.

“That’s right!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly patted his head!

“I have an idea!” Qin Yu said excitedly.

He hurriedly took out the coffin of the masked woman from the Spatial Magic Artifact!

The moment the coffin appeared, the temperature immediately dropped by a few degrees!

Qin Yu pointed at the coffin and said, “As long as I hide in this coffin, I can avoid the flames, right?”

The man with the mustache was also stunned for a moment. He scratched his head and said, “You’re really a genius! But... can this coffin withstand the True Fire?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. I can only try.”

“I’ll drill into this coffin later. Throw the coffin down,” Qin Yu urged.
