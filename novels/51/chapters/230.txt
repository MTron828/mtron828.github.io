Qin Yu simply didn’t want to lower himself to their level.

He waved his hands at Yao Qing to indicate for him to ignore them.

Although Yao Qing was angry, he could only endure it.

“Looks like this car is quite prone to trouble.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself.

The car passed the toll station and entered another highway.

The two young men were still waiting on the road. As soon as they saw Qin Yu, they stepped on the accelerator and sped out.

Yao Qing was also a hot-headed young man. He originally wanted to chase after him, but because of Qin Yu’s orders, he could only obediently follow behind.

The car drove slowly on the road. Qin Yu closed his eyes and breathed lightly.

Unfortunately, the moment he closed his eyes, Han Wei’s arrogant appearance appeared in his mind.

“Han Wei...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

At this moment, the car suddenly came to a sudden stop!

Qin Yu’s head hit the front seat again!

“F * ck...” Qin Yu was about to curse when he saw the scene outside the window.

The car was stopped by the two young men. They blocked the front of the car with arrogant expressions.

“It’s not over yet...” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and couldn’t help but feel a little impatient.

He pushed open the car door and got out of the car.

The two young men stood in front of the M 3 and looked at Yao Qing arrogantly.

“What? Are you scared already?” A young man with yellow hair sneered.

“You’re driving like a turtle. What are you dawdling for? Are you afraid?” Another young man also shouted.

Yao Qing gritted his teeth. He suppressed his anger and said, “We don’t want to compete with you. Also, the person in the car is the famous King of Chuzhou, Qin Yu.”

He thought that he could scare them by mentioning the King of Chuzhou.

But unexpectedly, after hearing this title, they became even more excited.

“King of Chuzhou? I’ve wanted to see him since long ago.” The blonde guy said with a grimace.

“You’re hyped up on the internet every day and use some special effects to deceive people. If you have the ability, let’s try it out now. I’ll go call someone now. Do you have the guts to?” The blondie sneered. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qin Yu was impatient.

He took a step forward and looked coldly at the blondie while saying, “Are you done?”

“Hehe, you’re the King of Chuzhou? The one who is overhyped and only knows how to brag? Come, tell us, which media company are you from?” The blondie sneered.

The young man next to him also shouted, “If you have the capabilities, then let’s have a try. Otherwise, you will post a video on the internet saying that you are my younger brother!”

“That’s right, let them know who the real king is!” The blonde guy sneered.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said coldly, “I’m on my way. Get lost right now.”

The blonde guy sneered. “You don’t understand what I said? You want us to get lost? Who do you think you are?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took a step forward and raised his hand to slap the blonde man!

Although he held back, the slap made the blonde man turn 360 degrees on the spot, and he fell to the ground.

“Don’t look for trouble,” Qin Yu glanced at them and said coldly.

The young man next to the blonde man was so scared that he didn’t have the guts to say anything. When he came back to his senses, Qin Yu had already driven away.

...

Without the blonde man’s harassment, the journey was much faster.

Soon, the two of them arrived at Bai City.

The villa here was already surrounded. As soon as they entered the door, there was a large independent space.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and felt the faint spiritual energy around him. He muttered in a low voice, “If I set up a spiritual energy gathering formation here, the spiritual energy will definitely be several times denser.”

He didn’t waste any time. He immediately took out the materials and started to set up the formation.

The spiritual energy gathering formation was considered the most basic formation for cultivators. Although it couldn’t be compared to a natural spiritual energy gathering formation, it was still useful for ordinary cultivators.

By the time Qin Yu set up the formation, it was already night.

Looking at the starry sky, Qin Yu murmured, “I wonder if I can break through this time.”

He sat cross-legged on the ground and closed his eyes while preparing to break through to the seventh level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

Unfortunately, he failed to break through this time.

He had reached the seventh level, but he still couldn’t break through.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground and said helplessly, “It seems that I still need a fortuitous event to break through. If I stay behind closed doors, I will never be able to reach the seventh level.”

During this period of time, Qin Yu spent almost all his time cultivating.

Perhaps he should enter the secular world at the right time.

In the next few days, Qin Yu opened up a large vegetable garden in this spiritual energy gathering formation.

Different from ordinary vegetable gardens, the plants here were all herbs.

With the support of the spiritual energy gathering formation, the growth rate of the herbs was several times faster.

Under the scorching sun, Qin Yu waved his hoe and was so tired that he was drenched in sweat.

“Mr. Qin, why did you plant vegetables...” Yao Qing muttered.

Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead and said, “Sometimes, planting vegetables is also a kind of cultivation.”

“I don’t understand...” Yao Qing shook his head while looking very confused.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Everyone’s cultivation has a different path. Only by finding your own path can you succeed.”

Yao Qing was confused and didn’t seem to understand.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He raised his head to look at the sun and whispered, “Path... What is my own path...”

After a few days of exploration, more than half of the villa had become a vegetable garden.

“The originally nice villa has become like this,” Yao Qing muttered.

Qin Yu was quite satisfied.

Looking at these herbs that were growing healthily, Qin Yu had a satisfied look on his face.

At noon the next day, Qin Yu continued to explore as usual.

At this moment, his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Lei Hu.

Qin Yu walked to the side and picked up the phone.

“What’s the matter?” Qin Yu asked.

On the other end, Lei Hu said, “Mr. Qin, I’ve already made Xiong Yi talk.”

Qin Yu agreed and motioned Lei Hu to continue.

Lei Hu said in a sullen voice, “The one who is cooperating with him is Dong Tianhai, who is known as the medicine king in the Jiang Bei region.”

“Dong Tianhai?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Qin Yu had never heard of this name before.

On the other end, Lei Hu explained, “This medicine king has spent more than half of his life traveling the world and collecting herbs. He has countless top-grade herbs in his hands!”

“The batch of herbs that Dong Tianhai traded with Xiong Yi are defective items in Dong Tianhai’s hands.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be shocked!

Herbs that had medicinal effects for decades were considered defective items?

How many top-grade herbs did Dong Tianhai have in stock for him to be so magnanimous?

“Can I get his contact information?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

On the other end, Lei Hu smiled and said, “Dong Tianhai has been in Chuzhou recently. I have already made an appointment for you. He is in Bai City.”
