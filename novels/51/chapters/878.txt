Chapter 879: Chapter 879, just one punch! 

A cold smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face, and the internal Qi on his body was also rising rapidly.

This was exactly what he wanted. Under such circumstances, Qin Yu did not believe that Gu Xinghe would not make a move!

“Kid, if you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”At this time, long brows suddenly stepped forward quickly and blocked in front of Gu Xinghe.

Qin Yu glanced at him and mocked without concealing it, “You? You’re just a dog of Gu Xinghe, do you think you’re Worthy?”

“What, now master doesn’t dare to make a move and let a dog stand out?”

When Long Mei heard this, his anger immediately soared.

He took a step forward and said coldly, “Kid, your parents didn’t teach you what it means to be educated, so I’ll teach you on their behalf!”

After he finished speaking, long brows took the initiative to attack. With a wave of his sleeve, streams of sharp qi force rushed towards Qin Yu!

Without even thinking, Qin Yu raised his hand and used the absolute beginning holy fist!

The Golden Fist instantly shattered long brows’s spell and sent him flying back dozens of meters. He even spat out a mouthful of blood!

This made people involuntarily suck in a breath of cold air!

After all, long brows was at the half-step martial saint stage and was only a hair’s breadth away from the martial Saint Stage!

But now, he was actually sent flying by Qin Yu’s punch?

Long Mei crawled up from the ground. He wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and said through gritted teeth, “Kid, you really have some ability...”

“What, are you still here to throw your life away?”Qin Yu said coldly.

“If you come any closer, I won’t be polite.”

Long Mei shouted loudly. He was about to make a move when he was stopped by Gu Xinghe.

With a playful smile on his face, he said with a faint smile, “Today is the Big Day of the new semester. I wanted to spare your life, but I didn’t expect you to press on step by step and disrupt the scene.”

Qin Yu said with a faint smile, “Don’t talk nonsense. Everyone should also want to know how much stronger a young master like you, who came out of the mystic realm, is than us.”

At a glance, sure enough, there was some longing and expectation in the eyes of everyone below the stage.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Alright, if that’s the case, then I’ll let you know how big the gap between us is!”

As he spoke, Gu Xinghe’s internal Qi rose rapidly. He slowly raised his hands, and a scorching energy that was as hot as the sun condensed on his chest!

A wave of heat assaulted his face, and the temperature instantly rose!

It was supposed to be winter, but now it was as hot as Summer!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and a trace of craftiness flashed across his face!

He had no intention of wasting time with Gu Xinghe, but to end the battle as quickly as possible!

Qin Yu suddenly raised his hand, and with a raise of his hand, he used his trump card move, one punch to break ten thousand arts!

This punch contained all of Qin Yu’s life’s knowledge, spiritual power, spiritual fire, Divine Dragon’s power, and so on. All the power was gathered on this punch!

All the Qi and energy in his body seemed to have been sucked dry, shining brilliantly on his golden fist!

“Not good!”

Gu Xinghe’s face immediately changed!

Even though Qin Yu had not made a move yet, he could already feel the terrifying power on that fist!

This power was definitely not something that the spells in his hands could withstand!

“Kid, you’re cheating!”Gu Xinghe could not help but be furious!

In his opinion, how could raising one’s hand be a trump card!

However, Qin Yu grinned and sneered, “Do you think I’m here to play with you!”

Accompanied by a furious roar, Qin Yu’s earth-shattering punch was thrown out!

In an instant, the entire martial arts academy fell apart!

The entire scene was filled with violent winds, the sky was dark, and a long tunnel of ruins appeared on the ground! It was caused by the residual power of Qin Yu’s fist!

The spell in Gu Xinghe’s hand had not even been completed before it was already dead in the womb!

Half of his body was directly shattered, and his body was sent flying for hundreds of meters!

“Young Master!”

Long brows instantly became anxious! Gu Xinghe was Gu Zizhen’s only son. If anything happened, it would be over!

He rushed towards Gu Xinghe in a hurry, but Qin Yu was one step ahead of him and grabbed Gu Xinghe in his hand.

At this moment, Gu Xinghe was like a dead dog, caught in Qin Yu’s palm.

Fresh blood flowed down his clothes.

“You... F * cking... cheated...”Gu Xinghe used all his strength to spit out these words, and then he completely fainted.

The people below the stage were even more dumbfounded.

They naturally couldn’t understand the details, they only knew that Qin Yu killed the young master of the second mystic realm, Gu Xinghe, with one punch!

“Damn... I thought it would be a fierce battle. I didn’t expect it to be resolved with one punch.”

“Should we say that Qin Yu is too strong or that Gu Xinghe is too weak?”

“There are both. However, Qin Yu seems to be only at the perfect stage of the Martial Marquis Realm. He is not even a half-step martial saint...”

“It’s too terrifying. Gu Xinghe has no way to fight back in front of Qin Yu...”

Everyone was discussing, and only Qin Yu understood.

The reason why he was able to win so quickly this time was because of the word ‘fast’.

The side effect of Qin Yu’s self-created ten thousand arts breaking punch was also quite big. After using it, he would lose all his internal Qi.

However, from the outside, Qin Yu’s punch was just an ordinary punch. He would not be overly cautious.

“Kid, let My Young Master Go! Otherwise, I Promise I’ll skin you alive and pull out your tendons!”Long Mei widened his eyes and shouted angrily.

Qin Yu was no longer in the mood to continue fighting. He looked coldly at long mei and said, “I won’t kill him. Go back and tell Gu Zizhen that I’ll give him three days to get rid of the spirit binding spell.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Long Mei tried to stop him, but Qin Yu raised his hand and placed it on Gu Xinghe’s dantian. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“If you don’t want him to die, go back and tell Gu Zizhen,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Long-browed remembered bared his teeth. He gnashed his teeth and looked at Qin Yu, saying, “If young master Gu loses even a hair, I promise you that everyone related to you will die without a burial ground!”

“I believe that you have the ability, but don’t doubt my determination,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu grabbed Gu Xinghe and turned to leave.

The scene was in chaos.

It was supposed to be the opening ceremony, but such a thing happened.

Everyone was talking about it, as if they were discussing Qin Yu’s strength.

Long Mei gritted his teeth. He didn’t dare to waste time and immediately rushed to the second secret realm.
