Du Hengsheng looked at the pill repeatedly. In the end, he ascertained that this was the pill Qin Yu had given him!

“Mr. Du, are you done looking at it? It’s time to return it to me.” Mayor Li took the Soul Nourishment Pill back.

Then, Mayor Li said jokingly, “Mr. Du, you have to be careful. Lei Hu might become the richest man in Jiangcheng and replace you.”

The others also joked, “Mr. Du, your position is in danger!”

Everyone laughed. Du Hengsheng looked embarrassed and couldn’t laugh.

...

At downtown Jiangcheng, there was a set of shops. This was Lei Hu’s office.

Recently, Lei Hu’s office had been crowded with people. Many rich people wanted to get the Soul Nourishment Pill’s power of agency and even wanted to monopolize it.

This was also the first time Lei Hu enjoyed the feeling of being kissed up to.

“Lei Hu, Mr. Sun wants to see you.”

“Lei Hu, Mr. Zhang has been waiting at the door for an hour.”

“Lei Hu...”

Lei Hu impatiently waved his hand and said, “I won’t see him. I’m not free!”

Before this, these so-called bosses looked down on Lei Hu, but now, they were begging at the door.

“It’s all thanks to this Soul Nourishment Pill,” Lei Hu said proudly.

At this moment, the office door was suddenly opened.

“Didn’t I say that I won’t see anyone?!” Lei Hu scolded impatiently.

“Lei Hu, you’re so imposing.” At this moment, a voice entered Lei Hu’s ears.

Lei Hu turned around and saw Shen Yun standing at the door, and Zhao Gang following behind him.

“President Shen? Why are you here?” Lei Hu’s expression changed, and he hurriedly stood up to greet him.

Shen Yun snorted lightly. He didn’t say anything and sat down on the sofa.

“Why aren’t you pouring water for President Shen?” Zhao Gang said as he glared at him.

Lei Hu looked at Zhao Gang with some displeasure, but he still obediently poured a glass of water for Shen Yun.

“President Shen, why are you looking for me?” Lei Hu sat opposite Shen Yun and said sheepishly.

Shen Yun drank a mouthful of water and said nonchalantly, “I heard that you have a medicine called the Soul Nourishment Pill, right?”

Lei Hu’s expression changed, and he had a bad feeling.

“President Shen, the Soul Nourishment Pill is indeed in my hands...” Lei Hu braced himself and said.

Shen Yun coldly snorted and said, “Give me the formula for the Soul Nourishment Pill, and I can give you a sum of money.”

After saying that, Shen Yun took out a bank card and placed it on the table.

“There is one million in the card. It is enough to buy your formula.” Before Shen Yun said anything, Zhao Gang was already showing off his wealth.

Lei Hu’s expression changed, and he couldn’t help but curse, “Only one million? Do you think I am a beggar or something?”

“Are you any different from beggars?” Shen Yun sneered.

Hearing this, Lei Hu couldn’t help but lose his temper.

He glared at Shen Yun and said, “Shen Yun, don’t go too far!”

“Go too far?” Shen Yun’s expression turned cold, and he said icily, “How dare you talk to me like that?”

After saying that, Shen Yun waved his hand, and a few bodyguards immediately rushed in from outside. With a few punches and kicks, they pressed Lei Hu to the ground!

Shen Yun looked down at Lei Hu and said, “Lei Hu, either hand over the prescription, or I’ll cripple you. It’s your choice.”

Lei Hu’s expression was extremely ugly, and he didn’t speak for a moment.

“You won’t speak?” Shen Yun nodded. “Break his legs for me!”

“Yes!” A few bodyguards shouted loudly and were going to break Lei Hu’s legs.

“Wait!” Lei Hu saw the situation and hurriedly shouted.

He raised his head to look at Shen Yun and said with a sheepish smile, “President Shen, it’s not that I don’t want to give it to you. The main thing is... I don’t have a prescription either. This Soul Nourishment Pill was sold to me by someone else...”

“Someone else?” Shen Yun frowned and asked, “Who?”

Lei Hu got an idea and said, “It’s... it’s a doctor! How about this, I’ll make an appointment for him to meet you in three days? Do you think it’s okay?”

Shen Yun sized up Lei Hu and pondered for a moment. Then, he snorted coldly and said, “It’s okay, but I’m warning you. If you dare to play me, I won’t let you off the hook!”

“I wouldn’t dare. I wouldn’t dare...” Lei Hu said with a sheepish smile.

Shen Yun waved his hand and left Lei Hu’s office with his people.

After he left, Lei Hu couldn’t help but spit on the ground.

“What the h*ll! Just you wait for me!” Lei Hu cursed.

Then, Lei Hu drove out of the office and went straight to Dragon Paradise.

At this time, Qin Yu was in the huge manor and doing breathing exercises with his eyes closed.

“Mr. Qin!” Lei Hu, looking very anxious, ran to Qin Yu with sweat all over his head.

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes and looked at Lei Hu. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“What’s the matter? Why are you in such a hurry?” Qin Yu said nonchalantly.

Lei Hu wiped his sweat and hurriedly said, “Shen Yun came to find me. He gave me a million yuan and asked me to hand over the pill formula.”

Qin Yu’s expression was calm. He wasn’t surprised.

He had long guessed that the Shen family would be interested in this pill formula.

“What did you say?” Qin Yu asked nonchalantly.

“I lied to him that the pill formula was given to me by an old Chinese doctor. I also promised him that he would meet him in three days,” Lei Hu said carefully.

“Mr. Qin, Please don’t blame me. Shen Yun wanted to cripple my legs, so I had no choice but to say this!” Lei Hu hurriedly added.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

He put his hands behind his back and looked into the distance. He said nonchalantly, “You did well. Lei Hu, go and make arrangements. In three days, all those who want to get the pill formula will come to the No. 1 Grand Mansion.”

“At that time, I will choose a robust company to cooperate with.”
