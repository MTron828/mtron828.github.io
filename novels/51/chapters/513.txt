Chapter 514: Absorbing Dark Energy! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Rays of resplendent golden light headed straight for the stone tablet!

“What are you doing!?” The man with the mustache on the side immediately panicked.

He wanted to stop it, but it was already too late.

The enormous force instantly caused the stone tablet to shake a little! But it didn’t shatter!

“hOW hard.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

The man with the mustache at the side heaved a sigh of relief. He patted his chest and said, “Buddy, you can’t act rashly. The treasure isn’t hidden here.”

Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and said, “If it’s not hidden here, where is it hidden?”

“Of course it’s around here! I can tell that you don’t have any experience!” The man with the mustache muttered.

He drew a circle for the stone tablet and said, “Who would inscribe the place where the treasure is hidden on the tablet? Isn’t that making the treasure’s location too obvious?”

“That’s true!”

After being reminded by the man with the mustache, Qin Yu also reacted.

So, the treasure hidden in the Dragon Vein wasn’t the herbs under the stone tablet?!

If that was the case, then the Dragon Vein could be salvaged again!

“Buddy, we can’t pull out this thing anymore,” the man with the mustache muttered as he began to carve tools.

The man with the mustache had a complete set of tools. He had almost everything one could think of.

“Why are you so afraid of pulling out this stone tablet?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

The man with the mustache glared at him and said, “I’m here to find treasure, not to die! If there’s something dangerous down there, I’ll be screwed!”

Qin Yu thought for a moment. What he said seemed to make sense.

If there wasn’t a real treasure hidden under the stone tablet, then there was indeed no reason to take the risk. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, to Qin Yu, this dark energy wasn’t something to be avoided. Instead, it was a sacred thing for his cultivation.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to the man with the mustache. He mustered all his strength and threw another punch!

“Boom!”

With this punch, the stone tablet finally began to loosen.

“Gee, buddy, why are you so stubborn?!” The man with the mustache muttered as he dodged to the side.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, if there is really something dangerous, I will protect you.”

The man with the mustache muttered, “Protect me? I’m just afraid that there is some Nascent Soul Stage monster hidden below...”

As he spoke, Qin Yu threw another punch.

After three consecutive punches, the stone tablet could no longer withstand the force and cracks began to appear on it.

“Crack!”

A crisp sound rang out and the stone tablet instantly shattered!

A similar giant pit appeared in front of Qin Yu at this moment.

Compared to the giant pit of the Dragon Vein, this giant pit seemed to be much more shabby.

Not only were there no herbs, but there wasn’t even a cultivation technique.

At a glance, there was a pitch-black mirror, two bronze medals, and a green hairpin inside.

Seeing this, the man with the mustache hurriedly ran over.

He stroked his beard, and his eyes were shining as he kept sizing up these few items.

Qin Yu didn’t hurry to choose, but said politely, “Buddy, which one do you like?”

A trace of craftiness flashed through the man’s eyes.

He coughed and said, “To tell you the truth, I like that hairpin. I wonder if you can give it to me?”

“Okay, that hairpin is yours.” Qin Yu waved his hand and put away the black mirror and the bronze plate without saying anything.

The man with the mustache couldn’t help but be dumbfounded when he saw this.

His eyes were staring at the black bronze mirror.

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

The man with the mustache mumbled, “You are so kind. This hairpin is a treasure. Don’t you want it?”

“No, no, no. How can I take away what someone else fancies?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

The man with the mustache couldn’t help but look up to the sky and lament, “The biggest trick is sincerity...”

Looking at his pained expression, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Buddy, could it be that the pitch-black bronze mirror is a treasure?”

When the bronze mirror was mentioned, the man’s mouth couldn’t help but twitch.

Then, he widened his eyes and said, “From now on, you aren’t allowed to mention the words ‘bronze mirror’!”

Qin Yu was secretly delighted. It seemed that he had guessed correctly.

This bronze mirror was the real treasure.

“This thing is nothing impressive. Wait until I make a move, then you will know what a real treasure is,” the man with the mustache licked his lips and said.

He picked up his tools and began to fiddle around on the ground.

It had to be said that this man with the mustache was indeed professional.

He walked around the area a few times while holding a shovel in his hand and muttering to himself.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, stood to the side and waited quietly.

This man with the mustache looked crazy, but in fact, he was quite capable. Qin Yu believed in his abilities.

At this moment, a strange movement suddenly occurred in the huge pit.

In a moment, streams of icy cold dark energy were emitted from the huge pit!

In an instant, the surrounding temperature suddenly dropped!

Endless dark energy instantly filled the entire valley!

“How dense!” Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

Not far away, the man with the mustache took out a peach wood sword and said in a trembling voice, “Demons? I’m not afraid of you!”

Qin Yu, his eyes showing some excitement, ignored him.

He really didn’t expect that there would be a dark energy pit hidden near the Dragon Vein!

Such powerful dark energy was a great tonic for Qin Yu!

“Since the Pavilion Master was able to forcefully suppress her cultivation level, I think I can do it too.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Therefore, he didn’t waste any time and immediately sat down cross-legged.

“Buddy, I’ll leave this treasure-digging business to you. I’ll wait for you.” Qin Yu said with a smile.

The man with the mustache mumbled, “I’m doing all the work, so you have to give me more of the treasures later.”

“Don’t worry,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Then, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time.

He closed his eyes, and the pores all over his body opened up as he began to absorb the surrounding dark energy.

“Chaotic body?”

Seeing this scene, the man with the mustache, who had been smiling mischievously, suddenly frowned.

He stared at Qin Yu for a moment, but in the end, he didn’t say anything.

At the same time that dark energy burst out from the huge pit, the pit above the Dragon Vein also began to produce strange movements.

The spiritual energy balance, which was in homeostasis with dark energy, was broken at this moment!

Endless amounts of spiritual energy burst out from the pit!

“What a dense amount of spiritual energy!” Yan Yuqi said excitedly.

All the members of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had sensed the spiritual energy in the pit at this moment!

“This trip wasn’t in vain. As expected of the Dragon Vein!”

Although they didn’t know what had happened, this was a perfect opportunity for cultivation!

For a moment, Yan Yuqi and the others sat down cross-legged and began to cultivate in seclusion!

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

What was unexpected was that the speed at which more than ten people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association absorbed spiritual energy at the same time was actually slower than the speed at which Qin Yu alone absorbed dark energy!

In three days, the dark energy in the valley was completely absorbed by Qin Yu!

And above the Dragon Vein, there was still abundant spiritual energy!
