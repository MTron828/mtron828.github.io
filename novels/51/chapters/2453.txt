2454 Returning to Nanzhou

“Master, I’m back!”

As the voice echoed, two figures walked toward them on a small path in the back mountain.

“Qin Yu, it’s you. I told my father it was your voice, but he didn’t believe me!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Wen Er laughed and hugged Qin Yu.

Wen Wanchong looked at them with a smile by the side, his expression somewhat emotional.

It had been 200 years since they parted ways in Zhongzhou, and he thought he would never see Qin Yu again. He never thought that he would appear in Huaning Mountain like a dream.

“Are you courting death, kid? Didn’t you hear me calling you?”

Jue Wu sent Wen Er flying with a kick, making him sweat from the pain.

Jue Wu grabbed Wen Wanchong’s beard and asked, “Old man, did you steal my wine?”

Wen Wanchong’s expression froze, and he immediately said no.

“Granny Jue Wu, my dad said your wines are too strong. Every time he drank them, he had to sleep for a few days before he could recover. He ate and drank.”

Wen Er complained by the side like a lackey.

“I’ll beat you to death, you old fart! These are my collection for so many years!”

Jue Wu was furious instantly. She pulled Wen Wanchong’s beard, making him cry in pain.

A group of people was making noise and causing a commotion. Qin Yu looked at the scene and let out a soft sigh.

After returning from the ghost realm, he had been suppressing himself. After seeing Master Wen Wanchong and Wen Er, he finally felt better.

At night, being familiar with the terrain, Jue Wu skillfully hunted several delicious griffins.

After Wen Er had cleaned up the prey, they started a bonfire and began barbecuing on the spot.

Qin Yu had particularly wanted to drink that night. He almost did not stop drinking since he began.

Yan Ruoxue sat beside him worriedly and gently held Qin Yu’s hand.

Wen Wanchong drank until his tongue stiffened. He had to say several times to finish his sentence.

“Master, this time, my soul went to the ghost realm. I saw Wen Da”

Wen Er and Jue Wu were originally grinning. They suddenly fell silent when they heard Wen Da’s name.

Wen Wanchong had thought that Qin Yu was drunk, but when he saw Qin Yu’s eye expression, he knew that Qin Yu was not lying.

He fell silent and did not know what to say. However, tears welled up in his eyes. The pain of seeing someone younger than his age die was not something that anyone could understand.

“Did he say anything?”

After a long time, Wen Wanchong finally composed himself.

Qin Yu told him about the encounter with Wen Da in the ghost realm and souls.

Hearing the fight with the demonic dragon, Wen Er clapped hard at the side as if he was the one who was fighting with all his might.

“Birth, aging, sickness, and death are the fundamental order of the human world. Who can live forever in the Path of Heaven? If Wen Da is just a living being in the ghost realm pursuing his mental ability and constantly risking his life, I would rather he be reincarnated as soon as possible. Even if he turns into ashes, it’s better than being tortured there.”

Wen Wanchong pondered for a long time before saying.

When they heard about the order of the ghost race’s mental ability, the group of people finally understood how the ghost realm managed to survive under the suppression of the strongest immortal emperor of the human race, even in tremendously harsh planes.

The group of people was completely shocked by the order of the ghost realm. It was an order that toyed with the mind to the extreme.

Moreover, they used the most terrifying mental power of different races, and the strongest people in the human world had extremely determined willpower.

The ghost realm used this power to make them unleash all their potential in pursuit of mental ability. It was like giving them a faint hope to unleash their greatest potential.

“In the ghost realm, almost all the powerful people I saw were human beings, including the masked woman, Brother Xiao Hai, and of course, quite several living beings of alien race.”

Qin Yu took another sip of wine.

“What? You saw Xiao Hai?” Jue Wu was shocked.

“I could come back because of Brother Xiao Hai, but he must have paid a huge price to send me back. If I ever meet Xiao Hai again in the future, it might be in a life-and-death battle.”

Qin Yu felt like a breath stuck in his chest. He drank the remaining wine in the pot in one gulp.

Qin Yu’s words were too shocking. Wen Er even thought that Qin Yu was talking nonsense.

But seeing his serious expression, he knew what Qin Yu said was true.

“I’m sorry to Big Brother Xiao Hai.”

Qin Yu silently shed tears. The power that pulled her back.

However, Xiao Hai’s mental ability might have already been completely taken away by the ghost realm. There would no longer be Xiao Hai in the human world.

Wen Wanchong drank the entire pot of wine and placed one hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“There are some things that you shouldn’t overthink. You’ll get caught up in a whirlpool of contradictions if you overthink. Just like when I took you in as my disciple, I actually learned about your past from Pavilion Master. On one hand, I cherished your talent, and I felt your loneliness and bitterness on the other. I felt it was too hard for you as a child, and you got along well with Wen Da and Wen Er. I just wanted to show some kindness.”

Wen Wanchong looked at Qin Yu with a smile.

Tears welled up in Qin Yu’s eyes. At that time, his strength was actually not extraordinary at all.

In the face of three lunatics, three extremes, and one legend, he did not even have the strength to resist any of them at the beginning.

Many of them would have attacked him if it wasn’t for Wen Wanchong.

“It’s the same for Wen Da’s incident. I know your state of mind. You had never returned since you came back. Whether you believe it or not, I still have to say this. I have never blamed you for Wen Da’s death. It’s a person’s destiny and cannot be reversed. Some people lost their lives because of my karma. If you continue to be obsessed with these things, precious time will be wasted and life will be meaningless.”

Wen Wanchong stared at Qin Yu. He knew that this disciple of his was tremendously emotional.

If he could not walk out of these accumulated matters, it would probably be a significant problem for his future advancement.

“I don’t care what Xiao Hai’s reason is. Since he has made this decision, as his friend, you must understand him. Otherwise, it would be a complete waste for him to sacrifice himself and become a member of the ghost realm. Perhaps he wants to face you personally in the future. At that time, he can have a hearty battle. This might not be a bad thing.”

Wen Wanchong shouted.

“Qin Yu! Don’t disappoint Xiao Hai on the battlefield in the future! Otherwise, I’ll expel you from the sect! Did you hear me?”
