Chapter 840: Two Martial Saints!

Yao Meng said in a low voice, “Yes, since they have jointly organized the exchange meeting, of course they know each other.”

“But... as for whether their relationship is good or not, I can’t say for sure. To be more precise, there is no distinction between good and bad.”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu asked.

Yao Meng explained, “To the various aristocratic families, they are more concerned about their interests.”

“Furthermore, there are only so many resources in the world. Even the resources in the Mystic Realm are plundered from the human world.”

“Hence, although the various aristocratic families appear peaceful on the surface, in reality, they are secretly competing with each other.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “In other words, as long as the temptations are sufficient, they will also become enemies?”

“That’s right, it’s the same for any aristocratic family.” Yao Meng nodded.

“I understand.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Qin Yu, if you really want to join the exchange, I can help you to get a spot. Take it as an apology to you.” Yao Meng stood up and said.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “That’s not necessary. As long as you don’t think about harming Yan Ruoxue, that’s enough.”

Yao Meng smiled bitterly and said, “Why would I think about harming Ruoxue...”

“Alright, if there’s nothing else, I won’t keep you any longer. I still have something to do,” Qin Yu stood up and said.

After sending Yao Meng away, Qin Yu took out his cell phone and gave Le Xian a call.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu said, “Mr. Le, I have something I want to talk to you about in person. Just the two of us.”

Le Xian hesitated for a moment, but finally agreed.

...

This conversation lasted for a whole day.

Qin Yu went out in the morning and didn’t come back until evening.

For the next two days, Qin Yu didn’t go out.

He prepared countless treasures for this exchange meeting.

In the blink of an eye, the day to go to the exchange meeting arrived.

Early that morning, Qin Yu stood at the entrance of the Martial Arts Academy, waiting for Le Xian.

Ten minutes later, a Mercedes-benz car stopped at the entrance.

“Mr. Qin, please get in the car,” Le Xian said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded at him, then got into the car.

The car drove slowly, and in the blink of an eye, it drove out of Jingdu, then came to a remote and deserted place.

At this moment, there were already many people standing here.

Among them, Yao Meng, Zhuang Teng, and Kong Yun were all here.

Other than them, there were also a few old men that Qin Yu didn’t recognize.

They possessed an extraordinary temperament. They were probably masters who specialized in a certain field.

After Qin Yu got out of the car, he walked in the direction of Yao Meng and the others.

“Qin Yu?” Everyone was a little surprised when they saw Qin Yu.

Wan Guqiong took a step forward and sneered. “What are you doing here? Didn’t I say that I won’t give you a spot?”

“I invited him here,” Le Xian said from the side.

Wan Guqiong immediately put on an act and said, “Uncle Le, what do you mean? This guy and i have a grudge.”

Le Xian smiled faintly and said, “He has a grudge against you, but he doesn’t have a grudge against me. Qin Yu is a top-tier alchemist, so he naturally has the right to participate in the exchange meeting.”

Wan Guqiong snorted lightly, but there was a hint of excitement hidden in his displeased expression.

“Qin Yu, how do you know Le Xian?” Yao Meng said with some surprise.

Qin Yu said perfunctorily, “He came to find me. Before this, I didn’t know him.”

“Impressive,” Kong Yun said in a low voice.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He closed his eyes slightly and waited quietly for the opening of the Mystic Realm.

About half an hour later, a light suddenly flashed in front of everyone.

Then, an exit suddenly appeared.

Two men walked out of the Mystic Realm.

“Just these people?” Looking at the few people in front of them, these two people seemed to be a little surprised.

Wan Guqiong nodded and said, “This is the first exchange meeting after all, so the number of people participating isn’t too many.”

The two people didn’t say anything more and immediately agreed. Then, they said, “Alright, follow me in.”

The group of people followed behind the two of them and strode into the Mystic Realm.

The moment they stepped into the Mystic Realm, the entrance also disappeared.

As soon as they entered the realm, waves of strange internal qi assaulted them.

This internal qi didn’t seem like internal qi. Instead, it had a rotten smell.

“What’s that smell?” Qin Yu wasn’t the only one who noticed this strange smell. The others also felt the same.

Wan Guqiong glanced at them and said, “This is an abandoned internal qi realm. Let alone resources, it doesn’t have anything.”

“After all, you are outsiders. Who can guarantee that you won’t harbor any ill intentions?”

These words naturally aroused the dissatisfaction of the crowd. Kong Yun snorted coldly and said, “Are all of you from the Mystic Realm so superior?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wan Guqiong glanced at Kong Yun and didn’t say anything.

Although they were from the Mystic Realm, they didn’t want to provoke these rich children in the secular world.

“The exchange will be held in three hours. The location is the palace in front,” said Wan Guqiong as he pointed ahead.

“You can go and prepare.”

The group didn’t say anything else and just walked towards the palace.

The group arrived at the palace.

The palace was also dilapidated and there were broken walls everywhere.

Just as Wan Guqiong said, this Mystic Realm was completely abandoned. Not to mention the spiritual energy, even the trees were almost withered.

At this moment, many people had set up stalls in this palace to exchange.

“These people, are they all from the Mystic Realm?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Yao Meng nodded slightly and said, “They should be.”

At a glance, there were at least dozens of people present.

Such a huge number made Qin Yu feel a little surprised.

“There are actually so many Mystic Realms in this world?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Yao Meng explained, “Actually, Mystic Realms are not as mysterious as you think. Many people shuttle between Mystic Realms and the human world. Some people even treat Mystic Realms as their homes.”

Qin Yu nodded to show his understanding.

Then, Qin Yu released his divine sense.

Soon, he discovered two strange internal qis!

This internal qi was exactly the same as the one Qin Yu had encountered in the second realm!

“Martial Saint?!” A trace of uneasiness flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

Wan Guqiong sneered. “You sensed it? Since you’re already here, I’m not afraid to tell you that the Wan family has dispatched two Martial Saints!”

“Do you really think that Le Xian has taken a fancy to your talent? What a joke! That’s just my scheme. My goal is to trick you into the Mystic Realm and get rid of you!”
