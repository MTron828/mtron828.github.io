Qin Yu understood Yao Meng’s situation. She was once heaven’s favorite, as dazzling as the stars in the sky.

However, in such a great era, she ended up becoming a person who could not cultivate. She was bullied everywhere and even expelled from the aristocratic family.

Qin Yu had experienced this before, so he could understand Yao Meng very well.

The feeling of being looked down upon everywhere, indeed, was unpleasant.

Qin Yu placed his hand on Yao Meng’s shoulder and said softly, “Everything is over now. After today, you will get back what you lost. I know how dazzling you were in the past.”

Tears welled up in Yao Meng’s eyes upon hearing Qin Yu’s words.

She wiped it gently and tried her best to smile.

“Qin Yu, thank you. I will never forget your kindness,” Yao Meng smiled and said.

Qin Yu was silent. Not many people from Earth were still alive in the Holy Region. This made Qin Yu cherish the remaining people even more.

“I wonder how Chang Mang is doing now.” Qin Yu sighed slightly. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He had always wanted to save Chang Mang, but Chang Mang was imprisoned in the Skywater Prison, which was located deep within the Si family. It was unrealistic to attack the Si family.

“Sigh!” Qin Yu sighed.

If he had stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm now, he could go anywhere in the world. He absolutely would not be afraid of the Si family.

However, it was unrealistic for him to become a True Saint in such a short time.

“I hope Chang Mang can hold on,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The following day, the three left Quiet Wind City with Li Shen and headed to the Alchemist Association.

Qin Yu, Yao Meng, and Li Shen left Quiet Wind City and embarked on their journey to the Alchemist Association.

They passed through dense forests and high mountains. After trekking for a few days, they finally arrived at a mysterious and grand place.

The Alchemist Association was located in a vast mountain range. It was surrounded by dense clouds and mist, like a fairyland. At the peak of the mountain range was an enormous and magnificent building that emitted a mysterious and powerful internal qi.

Qin Yu and the rest stepped into the Alchemist Association’s main door and immediately felt a vast and ethereal spiritual energy shrouding the entire place.

The Alchemist Association was like an independent city, with wide bustling streets and a constant flow of people.

Numerous tall and imposing buildings were closely clustered together. Various unique buildings and huge alchemy furnaces were embellished among them, emitting a lingering medicinal fragrance.

Walking on the street, Qin Yu and the others saw diverse crowds of people.

There were cultivators dressed in gorgeous clothes with powerful internal qi. They were obviously top-notch martial artists who had come to join the Alchemist Association. There were also descendants of ordinary families who yearned for alchemy and hoped to find opportunities here. There were also vendors, teleportation formation masters, and other practitioners who provided their services to the Alchemist Association.

In the square in the center of the Alchemist Association, there was a large alchemy platform called the “Alchemy Divine Platform”. It was the most important place of the Alchemist Association which numerous alchemists fought for eagerly.

The Alchemist Association had very stringent rules. Everyone could only use the Alchemy Divine Platform within the specified time. Moreover, they were required to contribute a certain amount of medicinal ingredients to the Alchemist Association before they could use it.

Here, alchemists could interact with each other, compare notes on alchemy skills, and obtain valuable experience and resources. Besides the Alchemy Divine Platform, the Alchemist Association had many facilities and activities.

There was a treasure hall. The Alchemist Association’s treasure hall was a place that people yearned for.

It was a gigantic building with various precious medicinal ingredients, prescriptions, and alchemy tools on display.

These treasures emitted powerful spiritual energy and mysterious light, attracting many alchemists to visit and seek inspiration.

The Alchemist Association also had an alchemy square. It was a market area, and the stalls were full of various medicinal ingredients, medicinal herbs, and pills. Alchemists could buy the ingredients they needed or trade the pills they refined here.

In addition, the Alchemist Association also had an alchemy arena. It was a place for alchemists to show their strength and skills.

In the arena, alchemists could engage in the contest of alchemy and skill exchanges to learn from each other’s experiences and lessons.

Looking at this rather vast Alchemist Association, Qin Yu was incomparably shocked deep down.

“It seems different from what I’ve imagined,” Jue Wu whispered.

Qin Yu nodded. He had thought that this place would be like Thunder Courtyard. However, it was unexpected to be so lively.

“Since people can enter and leave this place as they please, why do many people say that the Alchemist Association’s threshold is very high?” Qin Yu asked in confusion.

Li Shen glanced at Qin Yu. He placed his hands behind his back and slowly said, “Because this place isn’t the real Alchemist Association.”

Li Shen pointed his finger at a tall tower in front of him in the distance.

The tower was called the Alchemy Hall, which was the actual location of the Alchemist Association.

The Alchemy Hall towered into the clouds. It was full of a mysterious and majestic internal qi, making people feel like prostrating themselves in worship.

Under Li Shen’s lead, the three soon arrived at the entrance of the Alchemy Hall.

Several people were standing there. They were dressed luxuriously and had unusual internal qi. They were either the heads of powerful aristocratic families or sect leaders with powerful backgrounds. However, there was a hint of humility on their faces at this moment, which was completely different from the outside world.

Although these people had extraordinary backgrounds, they all had humble expressions at this moment.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly saw a familiar face in the crowd.

“An elder of the Yao family?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

Qin Yu had seen this person before. He was an elder who protected Mount Pheonix that day.

However, he was no longer as overbearing as before. Instead, he appeared tremendously anxious and humble.

He stood at the door, hesitating. He seemed eager to enter the Alchemist Association.

The moment Qin Yu saw him, his gaze also fell on Qin Yu.

In the next second, his pupils were as if they were about to burst into flames. His figure shook, and he instantly appeared in front of Qin Yu.

“What a coincidence,” the elder narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “What? Are you here to seek Yao Xi’s medicine? It shouldn’t be. I had been merciful, but I had beaten him to such a state?”

The elder’s expression turned cold, and he said coldly, “You’ve thought too highly of yourself. My Holy Son’s injuries have long recovered.”

“Oh? Then why are you here? Could it be your life is ending soon, and you’re here to extend your life?” Qin Yu mocked and said.

The elder’s expression turned cold, and he said coldly, “Little b*stard, let me tell you! You can’t be arrogant for long. To tell you the truth, Si Liuhe will be coming out of seclusion soon, and soon our Yao family will also have a new Saint. When the time comes, even Dean Lei can’t protect you!”
