Chapter 686: Resurrection Was Imminent Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Her body exuded an extremely alluring charm that no one could resist.

However, Qin Yu was an exception. He did not feel anything when faced with this woman’s temptation.

Seeing that Qin Yu did not speak, the woman reached out with her palm and a dagger appeared.

“If you don’t agree, then I can only kill you,” The woman said with a regretful expression.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. If he wanted to break through this acupuncture point, he would need some time.

Therefore, he hurriedly said, “Wait, wait! Don’t be anxious!”

The woman said with a smile, “Why? Have you changed your mind?”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “That’s it, I’ll agree to the deal. You’re so beautiful, how can I refuse...”

“Oh? Really?” The woman’s eyes lit up and she immediately bent down.

“Really! Let go of me first, or else... it won’t be convenient!” Qin Yu quickly said.

The woman played with the dagger. She thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “That makes sense.”

Qin Yu was delighted and immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

This woman was indeed easy to deceive. As long as she opened his acupoints, Qin Yu would have a chance to continue stalling for time.

“However... your four limbs seem to be a little annoying. Let’s chop off your four limbs first,” The woman said with narrowed eyes.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically, and he couldn’t help but curse, “You vicious woman, b*tch!”

“Hehe, you’re right. I’ll cut off your tongue later,” The woman said with a smile.

Qin Yu secretly felt that something was wrong. He hurriedly urged his internal Qi and tried his best to attack his acupuncture points.

Just as the dagger was about to land on Qin Yu’s arm, a golden light exploded from Qin Yu’s body.

The terrifying internal Qi instantly forced the woman back a few steps.

Qin Yu got up from the ground and wiped the sweat off his forehead. He couldn’t help but say with some lingering fear, “That was close...”

The woman raised her eyebrows and said, “You have some ability. You actually broke through my spell so quickly...”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. His palm shook and he took out the bronze sword.

“B*tch, I’ll chop off your head later!” Qin Yu said coldly.

The woman said with surprise, “How could you bear to do this to me?”

“Alright, let me do it.” At this moment, the man seemed to be unable to hold it in anymore.

He took a step forward and looked at Qin Yu coldly, “I’ll give you one last chance. Hand over the mask!”

“I’ll hand over the f*ck!” Qin Yu sneered.

The man clenched his fist, and his face turned cold.

“Tsk tsk, why do you look like you’ve eaten sh*t?” Qin Yu mocked.

“Oh, I understand. You two are a couple, right? This woman is so flirtatious. She must be cheating on you every day, right?”

Qin Yu said to himself, “I see. No wonder you’re so angry. Speaking of which, it’s quite miserable...”

These few words made the man’s face turn even colder.

His palm lightly shook, and a pair of gloves wrapped around his fist.

This pair of gloves was obviously a special magical artifact, flickering with a dark radiance in the darkness.

“Ignorant thing!” The man coldly spat out these words, and then he stepped toward Qin Yu.

His fist, which was the size of a casserole, brought with it an extremely violent strength, and fiercely smashed towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent and hurriedly held onto the bronze sword to receive the attack.

“Clang!”

Following a loud sound, a terrifying force spread out on the bronze sword.

This enormous force instantly forced Qin Yu back a few steps. His wrist was in extreme pain.

“What a huge force!” Qin Yu could not help but be shocked.

The man did not say a single word and charged at Qin Yu once again.

His speed was no less than that of that woman’s. Qin Yu had no way of escaping and could only hold his sword to deal with it.

For a moment, the sound of “clang clang clang” was incessant.

The terrifying strength shook the web of Qin Yu’s thumb until they split apart. He could not even hold his sword anymore.

“Clang!”

Another punch!

Under this punch, the bronze sword in Qin Yu’s hand was directly sent flying.

“Damn it!” Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change.

Before he could pick up the bronze sword, that man’s iron fist smashed towards him again.

Qin Yu had no choice but to clench his fist and receive it.

“Clang!”

This punch sent Qin Yu flying, and his wrist was even fractured.

“What a terrifying strength!” Qin Yu’s expression could not help but darkened.

He subconsciously glanced at the mustache man not far away. At this moment, the mustache man was activating a spell. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu took a deep breath and slowly raised his hands. The golden light on his body slowly exploded.

Following that, Qin Yu’s body suddenly expanded.

A huge figure appeared in front of the two of them.

This spell was the cosmic form. The huge figure looked extremely oppressive.

“Wow, so big!” Seeing this, the woman could not help but cover her mouth excitedly!

“Humph, do you think you can beat me just because your body has grown bigger?” The man sneered.

He clenched his fist and then smashed it toward Qin Yu in a volley.

A fist shadow with monstrous power rolled toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu clenched his fist and raised his hand to meet it.

“Boom!”

The collision of the fists immediately caused the Earth and mountains to shake.

The man didn’t stop there. He shouted loudly and quickly raised his fists.

Two huge fists appeared in the air above Qin Yu.

The fists were ice blue in color and emitted a powerful internal Qi.

Qin Yu’s face darkened when he felt the internal Qi from the fists.

Even though the fists had not arrived, Qin Yu still sensed a hint of danger.

“Boom!”

The man’s fists landed and the ice blue fists in the air smashed down like two huge mountains.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and clenched his fists. His golden fists met them head-on.

“Boom!”

A terrifying internal Qi instantly spread out in all directions.

That internal Qi was like a sharp blade that directly sliced off the peak of the mountain in the distance.

Gravel rolled down from the peak of the mountain.

“Boom!”

Following that, the man threw another punch.

Under this punch, Qin Yu’s cosmic form seemed to be unable to withstand it.

“Whoosh!”

At the same time, that woman also attacked.

She only raised her palm, and numerous icy blue sharp blades condensed around Qin Yu’s body.

The two of them used their spells at the same time, and Qin Yu instantly appeared to be in a sorry state.

“Boom!”

Finally, that man’s fist smashed into Qin Yu’s cheek, directly sending Qin Yu’s huge body flying dozens of meters.

“Suppress!”

The man suddenly shouted, and a terrifying phantom directly smashed into Qin Yu’s body!

“Strangle!” Then, the man spat out another word.

Qin Yu’s body was instantly strangled to the point of cracking. Sparks even jumped out one after another.

“This kid’s body is really strong,” The man couldn’t help but say in a low voice when he witnessed the scene.

“That’s right. When an ordinary person is strangled, their body and divine sense will be directly crushed. He can actually withstand it for so long,” The woman said in astonishment.

“It’s useless. No one can survive under this technique,” The man said indifferently.

“Sigh, what a pity for such a body,” The woman said with a slight sigh.

Not far away, Qin Yu was struggling bitterly.

This extremely inexplicable force almost ground qin Yu’s body into pieces! Even his spiritual sense seemed to be moving crazily!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth tightly. He looked in the direction of the handlebar mustache and said with difficulty, “You motherf*cker... are you done yet...”

The mustache man did not say a word. His mouth was still muttering.

“Ah!!!” Qin Yu almost could not bear it anymore. His mouth let out a painful wail.

Right at this moment, the formation platform suddenly shook violently. Following that, two rays of light shot into the sky.

The mustache man also opened his eyes at this moment. He stared at the two male corpses in front of him and said in a low voice, “Should be done...”
