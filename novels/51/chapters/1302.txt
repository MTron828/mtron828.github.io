Chapter 1303: Chapter 1,303, the second young master of the Wen family 

Although these words were unpleasant to hear, they were the truth.

Even though Ling Yun was called Young Master, he wasn’t the son of the sect leader. He wasn’t even related by blood.

It was only because he was talented that he was pampered by the Heavenly Cloud sect as a babe.

However, this kind of relationship was far from being related by blood.

If Wen Dawen er was killed, his grandfather would have to fight the Tianyun sect with all his might.

Ling Yun gritted his teeth and glared at the Wen Brothers in front of him.

These two brothers had his grandfather’s support, so they were even more unbridled. They kept spewing profanities.

“Brat, what are you looking at? If you continue to look, I’ll Call My Grandfather to beat you to death!”

“That’s right, that’s right. What BULLSH * T number one genius? Calling people when you lose. I don’t think that’s all there is to it.”

The two of them kept shouting. Ling Yun, who was originally not very angry, was trembling in anger.

Such a scene couldn’t help but look a little comical.

The city Lord, who was standing on the city Lord’s Tower, couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

He didn’t want to appear at all. There was no other reason. He couldn’t afford to offend either of the two gangs.

All the rules set by the city Lord were only effective against the weak.

“Qin Yu, just you wait...”Ling Yun said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu knew that he wouldn’t be able to kill Ling Yun today, so he didn’t waste any more words. He only said coldly, “Ling Yun, I look forward to the next time we meet. When that time comes, I hope that you won’t let anyone else help you.”

Ling Yun wiped off the blood at the corner of his mouth. He looked angrily at the attendant beside him and roared, “Why aren’t you leaving? What are you standing here for!”

“Yes, Young Master Ling.”The Almighty naturally didn’t dare to say anything else. He brought Ling Yun along and turned around to leave. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He rode on a huge demonic beast and left this place.

Qin Yu only heaved a sigh of relief after Ling Yun left.

“What are you guys still standing there for? Do you believe that I’ll get my grandfather to beat you up?”Wen Da looked at the nine almighty experts who were standing in mid-air.

Of course, the nine almighty experts couldn’t afford to offend the Wen Brothers. They didn’t dare to say anything and turned around to leave.

Very soon, the scene returned to silence.

Qin Yu looked at the Wen brothers and cupped her hands. “Thank you for saving us.”

“Great, what is this? We hate people who bully others!”Wen Da patted his chest and said.

“That’s right, that’s right. If you really want to thank us, you can accompany us to have a good drink,”Wen er said.

Qin Yu could not help but be speechless. Then, he smiled helplessly and said, “Of course, no problem. The two of you can choose a place.”

“En... I think we should go to the gathering of sages building. After all, we are also great sages,”Wen da said.

“That’s right, that’s right. Besides us, who else can bear the word ‘sage’!”Wen Er added.

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He quickly said, “Alright, I’ll listen to you two.”

But at this moment, a person wearing a golden cannon stepped through the air and came over.

He cupped his hands and said, “Please Wait a moment.”

Wen Er glanced at that person and said, “Who are you? What do you want to Do? I’m telling you, don’t even think about trying to build a relationship with us!”

“That’s right, that’s right. My grandfather said that we should make friends outside, but we can’t make friends randomly.”Wen Er nodded repeatedly.

The other party laughed bitterly and said, “I’m the city lord of this Gu City. I’ve long heard of your names. Why Don’t you come to my imperial palace to have a chat? I’ve already sent someone to prepare wine and food.”

The city Lord complained endlessly in his heart. He simply didn’t want to pay attention to these two people.

However, the Wen brothers were well-known devil kings in this world. They relied on their powerful grandfather to cause trouble everywhere.

If something happened in this Gu City, he, as the city lord, would have to bear the responsibility. It would be better to invite them to the imperial palace.

“Prepared some food and wine? Let me tell you, you can go and take a look.”The Wen brothers touched their chin.

“Two of you, please.”The city lord cupped his hands.

After saying this, the Wen brothers followed the city lord towards the imperial palace.

But at this moment, the attendant beside the city Lord Stopped Qin Yu.

“The city Lord invited the Wen family’s young master, not you.”The attendant said coldly.

The city Lord kept silent, this was obviously his intention.

Seeing this, Qin Yu did not say anything more. He immediately turned around and was about to leave.

But at this time, Wen da pulled Qin Yu back and glared at the city lord.

“What do you mean?”Wen da said with some anger.

The city lord hurriedly explained, “Young Master Wen, this Qin Yu has offended the heavenly cloud sect. My imperial palace can not tolerate a great Buddha like him.”

“F * ck your grandfather. If you don’t let him go, then I won’t go either!”Wen Da said furiously.

“That’s right, that’s right. Let’s go to the gathering sage building. Tomorrow, I’ll tell my grandfather that the city Lord has chased us out,”Wen er muttered.

Seeing this, the city lord could not help but curse in his heart.

If he had known earlier, he would not have appeared.

“Brothers, you can go. I Won’t go,”Qin Yu said quickly.

Wen Da stared at him and said, “That won’t do! Let’s go to juxian tower. Who cares about his broken imperial palace!”

“That’s right, that’s right. I’ll bring you to our Wen family later!”Wen Er also said.

The city Lord had no choice but to cupped his hands again and said, “Please wait. Little Friend Qin, come with us to the banquet.”

“That’s more like it.”Wen Da snorted and said.

He pulled Qin Yu and said, “Let’s go. Let’s eat freely today. Since someone is treating, it’s a waste not to eat!”
