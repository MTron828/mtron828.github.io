After saying that, the Pavilion Master gazed in that direction and slowly stood up.

At this moment, Qin Yu was on the way to the Divine Alchemist pavilion with Old Mister Yan.

On the way, Qin Yu’s divine sense had been covering his surroundings because he was afraid that accidents would happen.

The car drove slowly, and the driver was chatty on the road.

Soon, the car entered a forest.

The moment they entered the forest, Qin Yu felt a trace of an unusual internal qi.

Although this internal qi had been hidden, it still couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s perception.

“Not good.” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He subconsciously looked at Old Mister Yan and said, “Old Mister Yan, go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion later. I will come later.”

Old Mister Yan said in a deep voice, “The people from the Yan family are here?”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, “I’m not sure either, but... I can sense an unusual internal qi.”

At this moment, three figures suddenly appeared in front of the car.

Because the appearance was too sudden, the driver didn’t even have time to step on the brakes.

“Ah!!” The driver immediately screamed in fear.

But the car stopped abruptly!

The entire car suddenly leaned forward, and the driver’s head hit the steering wheel.

“D*mn it, are you tired of living?!” The driver was furious.

He pushed open the car door and walked out while cursing.

“You three don’t want to live anymore, right? If you want to die, don’t harm others. I...”

“Pfft!”

Before the driver could finish his sentence, his body was smashed into pieces by Qiao Wu’s palm.

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned extremely cold.

“Old Mister Yan, wait for me in the car,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

After saying that, Qin Yu walked out of the car.

Qiao Wu sized up Qin Yu from head to toe and sneered. “Qin Yu, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to him. He walked to the driver and raised his hand to cover his chest.

Unfortunately, the driver’s internal qi had completely disappeared.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said coldly, “He is just a taxi driver, an innocent person. Why did you kill him?”

This shocked Qiao Wu.

He looked at Qin Yu with a playful look and said, “He’s just an ant. Who cares if it’s trampled to death?”

“Ant?” Qin Yu immediately burned with anger!

“In that case, you guys are just lapdogs of the Yan family. What’s the difference?”

Qiao Wu wasn’t offended by Qin Yu’s words.

He put his hands behind his back and said aloofly, “Don’t worry. I’ll send you to see him right away.”

As soon as he said that, Qiao Wu’s figure suddenly disappeared!

Such a fast speed exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

It was several times faster than Cao Shan was back then!

“Bang!”

Before Qin Yu could react, his back was already covered by a huge palm!

“Pu!”

The terrifying force shook Qin Yu to the point that he vomited blood. He staggered and fell to the ground.

“For you to be able to endure my palm strike, not bad,” Qiao Wu said aloofly.

Qin Yu got up from the ground and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. A grave expression appeared on his face.

They were both at the peak of the Grandmaster realm, but Qiao Wu’s strength was far above Cao Shan’s!

“You might be able to withstand one palm strike, but what about the second one?” Qiao Wu raised his eyebrows.

Before he could finish his words, he stepped forward once more!

His extremely fast figure left an afterimage on the spot.

Even Qin Yu’s eyes couldn’t catch up!

“Shrinking Ground Into An Inch!”

In the panic, Qin Yu used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and retreated!

“Hmph, you want to run? In your dreams!” Qiao Wu snorted coldly and once again chased after him!

Qiao Wu’s speed was extremely fast. Even if Qin Yu used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, the distance between the two of them was shrinking bit by bit!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. The energy in his entire body erupted, as if he was brewing something.

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!”

Just as Qiao Wu was about to touch Qin Yu, Qin Yu suddenly let out an angry roar and turned around to face Qiao Wu!

At this moment, Qiao Wu was blinded by the light!

The light from those two iron fists almost made him unable to open his eyes!

The terrifying energy even threatened to tear his face apart!

This was the power that erupted after Qin Yu fused the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist with the strange force in his body!

It was dozens of times stronger than an ordinary Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

“Boom!”

Qiao Wu didn’t expect Qin Yu to suddenly counterattack. He had nowhere to hide from this punch, and his entire body was instantly struck by this huge force that was slanting towards him!

“Boom!”

Qiao Wu’s body fell down from midair!

The huge impact created a huge pit several meters deep on the ground!

Smoke and dust rose up, and the entire ground seemed to be shaking!

Qin Yu stood in the air and couldn’t help but gasp.

This punch contained all of his qi energy, and its power even exceeded that of a bomb!

“Ah...”

The smoke and dust slowly fell, and Qiao Wu climbed out of the huge pit.

His entire body was covered in blood, and half of his body was almost shattered.

Ghastly white bones were exposed and looked extremely horrifying!

The Inner Strength Grandmasters of the Yan family couldn’t help but be stunned. No one would have thought that Qin Yu would be able to cripple half of Qiao Wu’s body with one punch!

“He’s actually not dead.” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

If it was an ordinary peak Inner Strength Grandmaster, this punch would probably have killed him.

“You actually dared to hurt me...” Qiao Wu’s eyes were filled with madness!

To him, this was a great humiliation!

A terrifying internal qi slowly spread out with Qiao Wu as the center.

Qiao Wu’s entire body suddenly became larger!

His entire body flickered with light, and his killing intent surged. He was like a towering mountain that threatened to suffocate him!

“Go to h*ll!”

The next second, Qiao Wu’s hands suddenly shook, and a terrifying power instantly condensed in the center of his fists!

This power was extremely vast and rippled toward Qin Yu layer by layer!

It was too late, but it happened in the blink of an eye!

The power was like water ripples, stacking up layer by layer! Level by level!

Under this enormous power, the surrounding trees were cut in half, and the rocks in the distance were even shattered into powder!

“Level four of the Saintly Body Technique!”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He raised his head and roared furiously. He mobilized his entire body and forced himself to use level four of the Saintly Body Technique!

Under the augmentation of level four of the Saintly Body Technique, Qin Yu’s body became even harder! The light was even more dazzling, and even the sun seemed to pale in comparison!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu roared repeatedly. He raised both his fists at the same time and met it head-on!

There was a huge explosion!

The moment he made contact, the light on Qin Yu’s fists was shattered!

Even the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth was covered in layers of cracks!

“Rumble...”

That power was still being continuously reinforced. The power was like water ripples as it continuously stacked up.

When it was stacking up to the fourth level, Qin Yu couldn’t hold on any longer.

The golden light on his body was like glass as it shattered layer by layer. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The enormous pressure made Qin Yu feel immense pain!

But even so, Qin Yu still didn’t have the intention to give up!

“Saintly Body Technique... level five!”

Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily while forcefully activating the fifth level of the Saintly Body Technique!
