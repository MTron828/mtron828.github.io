Most importantly, Yan Sihai was on good terms with the Han family.

This was definitely not good news for Qin Yu.

The moment Qin Yu looked at Yan Sihai, Yan Sihai also looked at Qin Yu.

“Who is this person?” Yan Sihai pointed at Qin Yu and asked.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “He is Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu?” When Yan Sihai heard this name, the corners of his mouth curled up into an imperceptible sneer.

“Alright, sit down quickly and eat,” Old Mister Yan said expressionlessly.

“Yes.” Yan Sihai bowed to Old Mister Yan. Then, the servant changed his clothes and he sat at the side of Old Mister Yan.

During this period of time, Yan Sihai and Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He didn’t even look at Qin Yu.

But for some reason, when facing Yan Sihai, Qin Yu felt a little uneasy.

No matter how normal Yan Sihai acted, Qin Yu could still feel the hostility from him.

Not long after, the remaining members of the Yan family also returned to the Yan family.

The Yan family had a total of four children, with Yan Sihai as the oldest. Under him were Yan Ruoxue’s father, Yan Yongxiu, Yan Shanhe, and Yan Tianhong.

Yan Yongxiu seemed to be somewhat shocked by Qin Yu’s arrival.

“Qin Yu, why are you here?” Yan Yongxiu asked in surprise.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Mr. Yan, I just happened to come to Jingdu to do some business, so I came by to see Ruoxue.”

“Ruoxue? What an intimate address,” Yan Shanhe said with a half-hearted smile.

Yan Tianhong also glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Is it that just anyone can marry into the Yan family? Do you think that you can go from rags to riches by doing so?”

Faced with the ridicule of the crowd, Qin Yu didn’t know how to answer.

After all, they were Yan Ruoxue’s elders, so it was impossible for Qin Yu to rebuke them.

“Ruoxue, this is the first time you brought a man home, right?” Yan Shanhe asked.

Yan Ruoxue nodded and said, “The first and only one.”

The people at the table immediately became somewhat displeased.

“Hmph, there are so many young masters in Jingdu, yet you don’t want them. Instead, you want to find a country bumpkin who crawled out of a ravine!” Yan Shanhe berated.

“Do you want to embarrass our family?”

Yan Ruoxue was neither shocked nor angry. She calmly said, “I don’t think Qin Yu will embarrass the Yan family. Moreover... I think he is many times better than those so-called young masters of the noble families in Jingdu.”

“Hehe, the Yan family isn’t so easy to marry into!” Yan Shanhe said coldly.

“All of you, shut up!” At this time, Old Mister Yan suddenly shouted loudly.

“Whoever doesn’t want to eat, put down your chopsticks and scram!”

Old Mister Yan still had a lot of authority. The table immediately fell silent.

No one said another word.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but secretly contemplate about how the situation of the Yan family was probably more complicated than he had imagined.

Just from a few sentences, he could tell that Yan Yunheng’s status in the Yan family wasn’t high, and was far inferior to Yan Sihai’s.

And the other two brothers of the Yan family seemed to be on Yan Sihai’s side.

“It seems that Yan Jiang is right,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“I’m full.” Not long after, Yan Sihai put down his bowl and chopsticks.

He tidied his clothes, got up, and left.

“I’m full too. I really can’t eat anymore.” After Yan Sihai got up, Yan Shanhe followed closely behind.

“Tianhong, are you still eating?” Subsequently, Yan Shanhe asked.

Yan Tianhong shook his head and said, “I still have some things to deal with, so I won’t eat anymore.”

“If you guys don’t want to eat, we’ll eat.” Old Mister Yan snorted coldly.

Other than Yan Yongxiu, the few brothers of the Yan family got up and left the place.

At this moment, Qin Yu realized that these brothers didn’t live here, but had their own residences.

However, they had to come to the Yan family manor to eat every day. This was the rule set by Old Mister Yan.

After the few of them left, Old Mister Yan smiled and said, “Don’t bother about them. Qin Yu, you can eat what you want.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you, Old Mister Yan.”

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu still felt some pressure from the bottom of his heart.

The Yan family’s attitude towards him made Qin Yu realize how difficult it was to marry Yan Ruoxue.

Seeing that Qin Yu’s expression didn’t look good, Yan Ruoxue whispered, “Don’t bother about them. Anyway, I’m the one who will marry you, not them.”

With Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu’s expression eased up a lot.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue and said softly, “I won’t let you sacrifice your relationship with your family for me.”

Qin Yu believed that the Yan family would accept him one day.

After dinner, Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “Qin Yu, let’s go. Play two more games with me.”

“Okay!” Qin Yu stood up and followed Old Mister Yan to the second floor.

The two of them continued until it was getting dark.

Qin Yu looked out of the window, got up and said, “Old Mister Yan, it’s getting late. I should go back.”

Old Mister Yan smiled and said, “Do you want to stay here for a night?”

Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand and said, “No, we’ll talk about it in the future.”

“Alright.” Old Mister Yan didn’t urge him to stay.

“Ruoxue, send Qin Yu off,” Old Mister Yan said.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue walked out of the Yan family’s villa.

While walking along the quiet path in the Yan family’s Manor, Qin Yu was worried.

“What are you thinking about?” Yan Ruoxue blinked her eyes and said.

Qin Yu smiled and shook his head. “Nothing.”

“Don’t worry too much. Just be yourself.” Yan Ruoxue tiptoed and patted Qin Yu’s head.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the entrance of the Yan family manor.

Yan Ruoxue stopped in her tracks. She pulled on the corner of her clothes and said softly, “I’ll send you off here.”

Qin Yu turned to look at Yan Ruoxue and said reluctantly, “I really want to be with you all the time.”

“Me too.” Yan Ruoxue’s eyes sparkled.

Under the night sky, the two of them expressed a sense of innocence that didn’t belong to their age. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Time seemed to have stopped for the two of them at this moment.

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu finally let go of Yan Ruoxue’s hand.

“I’ll wait for you,” Yan Ruoxue said softly as their eyes met.

“Thank you for believing in me,” Qin Yu said sincerely.

No matter what difficulties he encountered, as long as he faced Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu felt that all the difficulties weren’t worth mentioning.

At this time, the sky was already dark. Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and turned around to leave.

After traveling for several hundred meters, Qin Yu finally arrived at the main road outside the manor.

At this time, Qin Yu noticed that there was a land rover parked not far away.

Even though this car looked ordinary, Qin Yu still felt an indescribable sense of oppression.

As expected, just as Qin Yu walked to the front of the car, the lights of the car lit up.

Then, he saw two men get out of the car and block Qin Yu’s path.
