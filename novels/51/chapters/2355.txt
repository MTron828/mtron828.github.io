2356 Suo Lin’s Might

Yao Xi’s expression changed drastically, and he quickly raised Saint’s hand to block the attack.

With a punch, taking advantage of the fact that Yao Xi had just finished his attack and had yet to withdraw his momentum, he directly blasted open his defense.

Yao Xi struggled frantically, and the dragon shadow formed by the Spiritualization Technique revealed countless wounds.

The spirit bead in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness started circulating wildly. A strand of spirit bead’s power of divine sense immersed into the giant dragon straightaway. In an instant, that energy surged again, making Yao Xi unable to move.

Behind Qin Yu, Teng Zixu lightly slashed out his saber.

His attacks were very simple, but each contained the power of heavenly might. Qin Yu gritted his teeth and did not intend to dodge this attack.

Then he infused the terrifying destructive power into his arm, and a Black Dragon Wave blasted toward Yao Xi’s head.

“Help!”

Yao Xi cried out miserably.

Teng Zixu was somewhat surprised. He did not expect Qin Yu to actually completely not block his attack.

With a slash, Qin Yu only felt a piece of bone on his back completely smashed into powder. That force flowed on his bones as if it wanted to destroy all the skeletons. The terrifying force almost made him faint.

When he fought Teng Zixu previously, he had to resist using the power of annihilation of the Sumeru World. This time, he solely relied on his physical body to resist the power of heavenly might, but it had caused severe damage to him.

When the Black Dragon Wave approached Yao Xi’s head, Yan Yunfan crushed it straightaway using his claws.

“Ridiculous! If we have so many people, yet you manage to kill someone through trickery, then I, as the Holy Son, can go back now. Do you understand? This is the power of the great force, unstoppable.”

Yan Yunfan sneered and said, completely ignoring Yao Xi’s murderous expression.

“You should have rested well, right?”

Yan Yunfan looked at Xi Menn again.

Xi Menn slowly stood up and attacked again.

Teng Zixu, Si Qianjing, Yao Xi, and Ni Wuxiao attacked almost simultaneously. All four could reach the power of heavenly might. With the addition of Xi Menn, even a half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator might not withstand such an attack.

A world phantom appeared again. Five terrifying attacks instantly turned into countless rule precepts in Qin Yu’s eyes.

The Fist of Annihilation aimed at the weakest point of the power of rules and bombarded it. In the terrifying collision, space shattered everywhere.

A massive force lingered around Qin Yu, crushing his bones piece by piece.

“Break!”

Enormous spiritual energy once again injected into his left fist. The power of annihilation erupted to the utmost and finally broke through the weakest point.

Qin Yu’s entire body passed through the attacks of the five people, and the enormous power caused the entire Azure Ridge Continent to tremble violently.

The cracks on the ground spread in all directions, and the thunder in the sky produced a deafening roar.

The combined power of these five people seemed to have already surpassed the limits of the power of heavenly might.

At this moment, the Path of Heaven revolved as if investigating who was challenging the heavenly might.

Qin Yu was panting heavily, and his body was covered in blood.

Under these two attacks, almost half of the bones in his body had shattered.

“What a terrifying character!”

Teng Zixu stood in the void, his face revealing a solemn expression for the first time.

“So what if he’s terrifying? He’ll surely die here today!”

Yao Xi shouted venomously.

The five of them represented the existence with the highest combat strength at this point. Whether it was the timing of the attack or the coordination of power, they were definitely top-notch. However, Qin Yu still stood upright after two consecutive rounds of attacks.

“Qin Yu, surrender. You should know that you have no chance of winning today. Hand over Ji Yue, and we will leave. There are absolutely no lies.”

Yan Yunfan shouted. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Bullsh*t, who said we’re going to let him go? Who the f*ck do you think you are?” Yao Xi roared angrily. Their Yao family had paid a massive price for their comeback this time, but they had obtained nothing. Moreover, the family had already planned to support a new Holy Son.

With such humiliation, he absolutely would not let Qin Yu off.

“Shut up.”

Yan Yunfan’s gaze was as cold as ice, and the murderous intent within it fixed on Yao Xi as if it were a tangible substance.

This calmed Yao Xi down immediately. Seeing Ni Wuxiao shaking his head at him, he stopped saying anything else.

“Do you think everyone is like you? Even if I die in the battle today, I can still laugh in the underworld!”

Qin Yu spat a mouthful of blood, but her tone did not change at all.

At this moment, his Suo Lin had recovered, and his fist shone with an extremely bright red light.

If one were to gaze at Qin Yu’s glazed holy bone at this moment, one would see Qin Yu’s emerald green glazed holy bone slowly dimming at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It was the terrifying spiritual energy flowing out of the glazed holy bone. Qin Yu knew that he could not sit still and wait for death.

Enormous spiritual energy poured into Suo Lin, and lava dripped down from his boxing gloves.

At a depth of 10,000 feet underground, lava kept surging up.

The entire space seemed to have turned into a land of flames, and countless lava spewed like fountains.

Scorching fire rain fell from the sky, and a giant unicorn was faintly discernible in the void.

That unicorn let out a fierce roar that contained a faint soul-hunting sound.

Qin Yu raised his fist high and smashed it down on the ground.

Dozens of gigantic fire dragons suddenly shot out from the ground and attacked the people of the Holy Region.

However, the fire dragons avoided all the “criminals”.

Mei Li, Chang Ye, Xi Menn, and the others were stunned. They seemed puzzled.

It was a full-powered attack from a peak divine artifact. Each of these dozens of fire dragons was the power of heavenly might.

Suo Lin himself was a divine weapon at the Peak Tribulation Transcending Stage. It was difficult for a True Saint to unleash the power of a magical artifact.

But now, the glazed holy bone had raised Qin Yu’s chaotic power to a higher level. Furthermore, he had absorbed the power of the Vermillion Bird earlier.

However, its flames contained a trace of the power of the Vermilion Bird’s flames, which had forcefully increased this power to the half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage.

What?

The power of heavenly might? And it was a group attack?

Yan Yunfan also blocked the attack in a hurry. A section of Yao Xi’s hair was burned off, and his face seemed to have been burned.

Both Ni Wuxiao and Si Qianjing were in a sorry state.

If they focused the power on one point and reached the strength of half-step heavenly might…

And merged with Yao Xi with the Celestial Saint’s corpse, Si Wuxiao holding the Non-immortal Sword, Xi Menn, Teng Zixu, and the others, they could do it.

However, to disperse the power and attack everyone whose power had all reached this level, even the chosen one, Teng Zixu, could not do it.

The moment the attack landed, Qin Yu’s Sumeru ring suddenly expanded to its maximum.

With a thought, his body instantly appeared beside Yan Yunfan.

In the Sumeru World, this speed was almost instantaneous. Even Yan Yunfan could not react in time.

A wisp of Sumeru qi swept up, then swept everyone around Yan Yunfan into the Sumeru ring.
