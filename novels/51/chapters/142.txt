Seeing Su Bo, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel puzzled. What was he doing here?

Without much time to dwell on it, Qin Yu quickly drove to the front of the crowd.

As soon as he saw Qin Yu, Mr. Yang hurriedly walked over.

“Mr. Qin, I was just about to call you.” Mr. Yang’s face was full of anxiety and worry. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu quickly asked, “Mr. Yang, what happened?”

Mr. Yang pointed at Su Bo and the others a short distance away and said, “They said that our herbs are not up to standard and that they have to destroy all of them. They also have to investigate our factory.”

“Mr. Qin, with this investigation, we will have to stop all of our work. I don’t know when we will be able to resume our business...”

After hearing Mr. Yang’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but squint and look at Su Bo coldly.

It was very obvious that Su Bo was trying to cause trouble.

The factory had been open for so long, and it had always received good reviews.

As for the herbs, it was even less likely that there would be problems because the requirements for herbs for the Soul Nourishment Pill was extremely low. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have reached the stage of mass production.

“Mr. Yang, don’t be anxious. Leave this matter to me to handle.” Qin Yu consoled him considerately.

Mr. Yang quickly nodded and said, “Okay, okay. We will give gifts when we should. Don’t be too stubborn...”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I understand, Mr. Yang.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked toward Su Bo.

Su Bo seemed to have expected it. He sized up Qin Yu and said with some amusement, “I didn’t expect you, a good-for-nothing, to open your own factory. It’s quite impressive.”

Qin Yu looked at Su Bo coldly and said, “What do you want to do?”

“What do I want to do?” Su Bo couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“What else can I do? I’m here to investigate your factory.” Su Bo sneered.

“Investigate the factory?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and asked coldly, “You don’t seem to have the right to do that, right?”

Su Bo sneered and said, “Is there a problem with the joint inspection of our Military District and the Quality Inspection Department?”

“There’s no problem.” Qin Yu nodded. He moved aside and said, “You can investigate however you want. If there is a problem, you don’t have to tell me. I will shut it down myself!”

Hearing this, Su Bo laughed again.

“Qin Yu, you are really childish. Isn’t it up to me to decide whether there is a problem or not?” Su Bo sneered.

After saying this, Su Bo immediately waved his hand and said, “Go and check his warehouse! As long as there are any problems, burn it on the spot!”

The relevant personnel of the Quality Inspection Department immediately walked towards Qin Yu’s warehouse.

As for Su Bo and Qin Yu, they just stood at the door and waited.

Not long after, two people ran out and shouted, “Found it! These few herbs are all products that don’t meet standards!”

Su Bo couldn’t help but sneer. He coughed and said indifferently, “Okay, burn them immediately!”

“This... This is a false accusation!” Mr. Yang immediately became anxious.

He ran to Qin Yu and explained anxiously, “Mr. Qin, I personally selected these herbs. There is absolutely no problem. You have to believe me!”

Qin Yu smiled and comforted him, “Mr. Yang, of course I believe you. This matter has nothing to do with you. He is here to target me.”

“Kid, don’t slander me!” Su Bo said with a nonchalant smile.

“I’m following the procedure. What do you mean by I’m here to target you?” Su Bo sneered.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and walked to Su Bo. He said, “Su Bo, I don’t think I’ve offended you, right?”

“You haven’t offended me?” Su Bo couldn’t help but sneer.

“A certain someone didn’t have this attitude yesterday. Why? Aren’t you quite arrogant? Why aren’t you showing off?” Su Bo snickered.

Anger flashed across Qin Yu’s face. He looked at Su Bo coldly and said, “Just because of a verbal conflict, you want to use your power for personal gain and retaliate. Su Bo, you really don’t deserve to stay in the Military District!”

“Hehe, whether I deserve it or not, it’s not up to you to decide.” Su Bo snickered.

“Let me tell you the truth. Not only do I want to burn your herbs, but I also want your factory to be renovated!”

“If I’m in a good mood, I’ll let you resume production in one or two years. If I’m in a bad mood... I might have to change it for ten or twenty years.”

At this point, Su Bo paused for a moment. He leaned towards Qin Yu’s ear and whispered, “If you don’t want your factory to close down, beg me. Maybe I’ll be merciful and let you resume production as soon as possible. Hahaha!”

Looking at Su Bo’s face, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a trace of anger.

He looked at Su Bo coldly and said, “I will definitely tell ymy superior about this matter.”

“Tell my superior? Who do you think you are to have the right to see my superior? What a joke!” Su Bo sneered.

After saying that, Su Bo waved his hand and shouted, “Burn these herbs that don’t meet standard on the spot!”

“Yes!” A few people from the relevant departments immediately walked towards the direction of Qin Yu’s warehouse.

“Let’s see who dares to!” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted and swiftly arrived at the door of the warehouse!

With this shout, everyone couldn’t help but freeze in their footsteps. The terrifying pressure made them cautious for a moment.

Su Bo’s expression turned cold and he immediately walked towards Qin Yu.

As he walked, he shouted, “Qin Yu, do you want to go against the law?! If you dare to go against the law, I will kill you on the spot!”

“I dare you.” Qin Yu said coldly.

“See if I dare to!” Su Bo quickly walked in front of Qin Yu.

Without saying anything, he took out his gun and pointed it at Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu quickly reached out and grabbed the gun in his hand. In the next second, the gun was crushed by Qin Yu!

Su Bo’s expression suddenly changed. He took two steps back and then said angrily, “Qin Yu, if you want to snatch the gun, I have the right to kill you on the spot!”

“If you dare to take another step forward, I guarantee that you will die here first,” Qin Yu said coldly.

When he heard Qin Yu’s words, a wave of fear suddenly rose in Su Bo’s heart!

He didn’t know why, but he didn’t dare to take another step forward!

“Well, well. You actually dare to threaten a soldier!” Su Bo gritted his teeth. He pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Just you wait. I will report this to my superior right now!”

After saying this, Su Bo took out his phone and was about to make a call.

“I will wait for your superiors to come. Coincidentally, I have some ties with them,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing this, Su Bo immediately burst into laughter.

“You have ties with my boss? Who do you think you are? Get a reality check!” Su Bo laughed crazily.

Qin Yu sneered. “I’m sorry, but your commander personally invited me to the Military District. Do you think I have a good relationship with him or not?”

As soon as he said that, Su Bo laughed even crazier.

He held his stomach and said, “Invited you to the Military District? To wash clothes and cook? I’m dying of laughter! Hahaha!”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He just waved his hand, indicating for him to make the phone call.

At this moment, a car with a government license plate suddenly drove over from a short distance away.

“This is Qin Yu’s factory?” The Deputy Chief looked outside and asked with a smile.

“Yes, Deputy Chief,” Commander Guo hurriedly replied.

The Deputy Chief nodded slightly and said, “I talked to the provincial Department of Commerce a few days ago. This is a key factory in the province. You must take good care of it.”

Commander Guo forced a smile and said, “Qin Yu is very famous in Jiangcheng. Who would make things difficult for his factory...”
