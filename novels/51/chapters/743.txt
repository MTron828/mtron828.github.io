Chapter 744: Herbs In Hand! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This person was wearing a black robe, and there was a sinister internal qi around him!

And the face hidden under his black robe was none other than He Teng’s!

“Qin Yu... do you think only you can get the news?” He Teng said sinisterly.

Qin Yu’s expression was a bit ugly. He took a deep breath and said, “He Teng, didn’t you go to the Mystic Realm? Why are you here?”

He Teng snorted lightly and said, “For this ten-thousand-year-old herb, what’s the big deal about giving up the Mystic Realm?”

“Cut the crap and quickly return the herb!” Tang Mo shouted loudly.

The folding fan in his hand was aimed at He Teng, as if he was going to attack at any moment.

However, He Teng didn’t panic at all. He swept a glance at Tang Mo and said with a nonchalant smile, “Tang Mo, I know that your strength isn’t ordinary and you hold a Martial Saint weapon. Unfortunately, you can’t do anything to me...”

When he heard He Teng’s words, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed drastically!

“Oh no! He Teng has a spatial spell. Make sure he doesn’t escape!” Qin Yu hurriedly shouted!

He Teng sneered and said, “You do know quite a lot, but unfortunately, it’s already too late!”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to dwell on it. He immediately clenched his golden fist and threw a vicious punch!

“Boom!”

However, this punch went straight through He Teng’s body!

“Hehe, Qin Yu, this herb are mine. Goodbye...” He Teng grinned.

His figure was gradually disappearing, as if he had disappeared into the void.

It was very obvious that He Teng’s spatial magic had improved by a step!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly, and his heart was filled with despair!

If he couldn’t obtain this herb, Qin Yu wouldn’t have the slightest chance of defeating Blackie!

“He Teng... You d*mn b*stard!” Qin Yu’s eyes widened in anger!

Just as Qin Yu was in despair, He Teng’s body began to materialize again!

His disappearing figure appeared in front of everyone again!

He Teng frowned. He looked at his body and said in a low voice, “What’s going on?”

“You’re not the only one who knows spatial spells,” at this moment, the man with the mustache said indifferently.

He turned around and saw the man with the mustache holding densely packed talismans.

These talismans landed in the air and confined this space!

This place was like a cage, where spatial spells couldn’t escape!

Qin Yu was so happy that he said excitedly, “Good job!”

In the air, He Teng’s expression was extremely cold. He tried to use the spatial spell again to escape, but he still failed.

“B*stard!” He Teng couldn’t help but curse!

He glared at man with the mustache and said coldly, “I will remember you. Since you ruined my plan, I will definitely kill you!”

The man with the mustache stuck out his tongue and grinned. “Come and hit me. Screw you!”

“Just you wait!” He Teng’s eyes were widened!

“Cut the crap and hand over the item!” Qin Yu took a step forward, and a terrifying internal qi instantly erupted!

Tang Mo and the others also took large strides forward. With more than twenty Martial Marquises and a Martial Saint weapon, He Teng had no chance of winning!

Although He Teng was unwilling, if he didn’t hand over the herb now, he was afraid that he would die without a doubt!

“Qin Yu, consider yourself lucky!” He Teng gritted his teeth and threw the herb in his hand directly to Qin Yu. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qin Yu hurriedly reached out and grabbed the herb.

“Qin Yu, let’s wait and see!” He Teng planned to escape.

“Stop, who said you can leave?” Qin Yu took a step forward.

He Teng’s expression turned cold as he said, “Qin Yu, don’t go too far!”

“Too far? Let me ask you, what’s going on with Fang Yue? How can I wake her up?” Qin Yu questioned loudly.

He Teng frowned. He took a deep breath and said, “You only need to find a similar Demonic Beast Spirit Pill to wake her up.”

“Is that true?” Qin Yu frowned.

“It’s true,” the man with the mustache said from the side.

Qin Yu nodded. Then, he looked at He Teng coldly and said, “He Teng, you have done many evil things and ruined my plans many times. If I don’t kill you today, the heavens won’t tolerate it!”

He Teng looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, are you determined to do so?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “What do you think? You have tried to kill me many times. Why are you saying such nonsense now?”

“Let me do it!” Tang Mo didn’t waste any words. He immediately activated the folding fan in his hand and slashed it towards He Teng!

A wisp of Martial Saint’s internal qi directly rushed towards He Teng!

Facing the Martial Saint’s weapon, He Teng had nowhere to hide!

“Boom!”

Under this attack, half of He Teng’s body was directly shattered! His body was instantly covered in blood. He looked extremely horrifying!

“Ah...” He Teng was overcome with pain. He glared at Qin Yu and said, “You d*mn b*stard... I won’t let you off!”

Qin Yu sneered. “That depends on whether you still have a chance to live.”

Just as Qin Yu was about to make a move, He Teng suddenly turned into a black light and sped into the distance.

Qin Yu snorted coldly. “You want to run? In your dreams!”

Qin Yu activated the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique. Just as he was about to chase after him, his expression couldn’t help but change.

He could clearly feel that there were several Martial Marquis’ internal qi rushing over from the dark.

“Stop chasing. Someone is coming,” the man with the mustache said.

“The most important thing now is to protect this ten-thousand-year-old herb,” Tang Mo also said.

“I can only activate the Martial Saint weapon once. It’s better to be careful.”

Qin Yu looked in the direction He Teng had left and couldn’t help but curse, “D*mn it, he got away again!”

“Let’s go quickly,” the man with the mustache said.

Qin Yu grunted. He didn’t say anything else and immediately turned around to leave.

Not long after Qin Yu and the others had left, Granny Qin and the others arrived at the scene.

She scanned her surroundings and looked at the bloodstains on the ground. Her expression became more and more unsightly.

Then, Granny Qin took a deep breath and felt the medicinal fragrance in the air.

“This... is really the place where ten-thousand-year-old herb was born!” Granny Qin said coldly.

As soon as she finished speaking, Granny Qin looked at Chou Heguang coldly.

A trace of panic flashed across Chou Heguang’s face. He hurriedly explained, “Granny Qin, this... This was an accident... I didn’t expect two herbs to be born at the same time...”

“You didn’t expect it? Then what do I need you for?!” Granny Qin’s body suddenly emitted an extremely cold murderous internal qi!

After sensing this murderous internal qi, Chou Heguang instantly became even more flustered!

He said in a trembling voice, “Granny Qin... Granny Qin, even if I didn’t contribute much, I still worked hard. At least I helped you find a five thousand year-old herb...”

“Worked hard? It’s because of you that I missed this ten thousand year-old herb! You d*mn b*stard!” Granny Qin’s mournful voice spread throughout the surroundings.
