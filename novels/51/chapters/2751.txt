“Fatty, I want to exchange for this flame.”

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment, but he still walked forward to ask.

He was broke now, and the ores he had were all from the Tomb of Heavenly Sins.

He also had an idea, but it still depended on whether Fatty would accept it.

“I’m only using this flame as a pillow. If I sell this thing, my father will probably scold me to death.”

Fatty quickly waved his hand. Thinking of his father’s methods, the fat on his stomach twitched a few times.

“Then let me ask you, Fatty. What are you doing here? You want to get excited.

If the nine Guardians don’t find something interesting to do, what’s the point?”

Qin Yu said with a smile.

‘What ideas do you have? Don’t try to fool me. I’m not easy to fool!” Fatty’s eyes lit up as if he was a cat that had smelled blood.

“With the power of your family, you should have known what would happen in the first three layers. Even if the power of the Heavenly Sin this time is great, it shouldn’t be a challenge for you, right?”

Qin Yu pulled Fatty to the side.

“The pass to the fourth level of the Heavenly Sin. How about I exchange it for your flame?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and asked.

“Hahaha, brother, don’t joke around. As far as I know, no one in the world can pass the fourth Heavenly Sin.”

Fatty shook his head when he heard that. However, he was shocked when he saw the fourth form tombstone mark on Qin Yu’s chest.

He was stunned and did not react for a long time.

The first level was the additional seal, the second level was a test, the third level was advancement, and the fourth level was killing.

By the time he reached the fourth level, Heavenly Sin had already possessed a portion of his true body’s power.

Therefore, even the most powerful people before this had almost all died in this third level.

One had to be a sinner with a powerful bloodline recognized by Heavenly Sin to obtain the fourth mark.

The second was to obtain a portion of the true body of several hundred Heavenly Sin. This was an almost impossible task.

“Big brother, here you go! I’ll be relying on you to protect me in the future. If I go to the fourth level and encounter any danger, you have to protect me.”

Fatty came back to his senses and took out the Primal Chaos Flame without hesitation.

“Brother, the Primal Chaos Flame is one of the top three fires in the world. This power is not something that humans can control. The only thing it fears is the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth. Only the cold dew can destroy it. Therefore, cold dew is the key to using it. I don’t know anything else, but this thing has backfired on many people. You should be careful.”

Fatty excitedly stuffed the Primal Chaos Flame wrapped in the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth into Qin Yu’s hand.

“By the way, Brother Qin Yu, I’ll also give you these two level 14 peak power talismans. They’re the most precious trigger talismans that can prevent sneak attacks. I don’t have many on me, so I can only give you two!”

Looking at the excited Fatty, Qin Yu felt a little guilty.

This guy probably thought that he was a top-notch talent on the spot. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If not for Sir Dagger, he would not have been able to pass the fourth test.

“Yes, if I have the strength to spare, I will protect you from danger.” Qin Yu braced himself and said.

When Qin Yu took the two talismans over, he felt a different feeling.

Qin Yu could feel the vast energy of internal qi within the thin talisman material.

“This is a talisman made from the primordial mother metal of the Divine Realm. Otherwise, it would not be able to contain such energy to release peak power! Although it’s a little expensive, I still have a few baskets.” When Fatty saw Qin Yu sensing carefully, he immediately said smugly.

“This is the Stars-shifting and the Three God-slaying Styles. One for attack and one for defense!”

Fatty introduced them to Qin Yu in detail.

“Thank you very much!”

Qin Yu originally thought that he would be lucky enough to be able to exchange for the Primal Chaos Flame. A drop of heart blood would not cause much loss to him. However, he did not expect that he would get two powerful talismans.

Fatty’s eyes were filled with excitement. Being able to enter the fourth level of Heavenly Sin attracted him more than anything else. “Oh right, brother! There’s something I need to remind you of.”

A Chaotic Space suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu.

It seemed like his spiritual sense was being sucked in by some kind of power.

However, Fatty’s body appeared in front of him.

“Be careful with that dagger in your body. ”

The internal qi squirmed in front of Qin YO and a few small words slowly appeared.

Qin Yu was shocked. Of course, he knew that the weapon Fatty was talking about was Sir Dagger.

However, Fatty seemed to have a deep understanding of Sir Dagger.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body returned once again.

Fatty gave him a look. Just as he was about to say something, a wave of energy suddenly enveloped them.

“Prepare to enter the second level!”

Cang Yunzi loudly reminded everyone.

At this moment, a pitch-black fog covered everyone. It did not cause any harm.

However, Qin Yu seemed to be deprived of something after the fog surged for some reason.

At this moment, there were no air fluctuations under their feet.

As the fog dissipated, the place where they were completely changed. Qin Yu felt as if he had arrived in a primitive forest.

When he looked up, he saw a towering tree that was impenetrable. Moreover, the ground was covered in broken limbs as if a great battle had taken place.

The ground was filled with magical artifacts that didn’t have any energy fluctuations.

Qin Yu picked up a piece of the fragment. He could still see the runes carved on the weapon.

Moreover, the people around him had all disappeared. The blood that had flowed previously had also gone.

It was as if the first divine hall was just an illusion.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Could this be an illusion?

When the thick fog attacked earlier, Qin Yu did not sense any spatial fluctuations.

In other words, they should still be where they were. But how could the others suddenly disappear?

Moreover, he could sense the battle fluctuations instantly if he was nearby.

Hundreds of crows flew up from Qin Yu’s body. The power of the Dao of Dreams made his body a little bit transparent.

Wasn’t it a dream?

Qin Yu fell into deep thought. He did not know where this place was.

Could it be that it was an extremely high – level secret spatial formation that teleported them to different places?

A burst of intense light erupted from his body all of a sudden.

Before he could react, a bright energy barrier had completely enveloped him.

A terrifying power exploded. It continued to circulate on the energy barrier and

increased its speed..
