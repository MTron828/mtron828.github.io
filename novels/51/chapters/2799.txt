“Meng Jing, live happily and be a good girl in the small house. The heavenly fate is not a reason to restrain you. You are you. Aiden, do your best and become the new king of the elven race.”

Qin Yu’s voice became weaker and weaker.

A large amount of blood mist erupted from his body. Fine pores on his body expanded.

Countless drops of blood dripped out. In an instant, Qin Yu’s entire body turned into squirming flesh and blood.

It was like a person who had been crushed into a meat patty but still had a consciousness of life.

He let out a painful roar. His body twisted crazily and countless tentacles exploded on his body.

Divine Doctor Lu, who was wearing thick glasses, stared at Qin Yubehind him.

His pupils flickered with disbelief.

Why could the person who became a god still transmit the will of his origin?

This person had just entered the Investiture of Gods, so his strength should be very weak.

Could this power have the opportunity to let his consciousness escape at some point?

Or was there a chance to escape from the incomplete Investiture of Gods?

Divine Doctor Lu subconsciously adjusted his glasses.

With a tap of his body, he disappeared from where he was.

In the Treasure Continent, Qin Yu was always under the surveillance of the Situ family no matter what.

He wasn’t afraid that Qin Yu would hurt Fatty Situ.

“Patriarch.”

Situ Qianxun reached out and stopped Divine Doctor Lu.

At this moment, a screen in front of him was playing the scene just now at ten thousand times slower.

Holy energy poured into it like a river around the screen,

The holy energy was consumed even faster than a level 9 Dao Consciousness expert in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom annually.

“Even with the help of the Mirror of the Past, I can’t see what happened just now. However, one thing is certain. When that person moved, the space internal qi in the area of 100,000 meters outside the Treasure Continent was stable. It doesn’t seem to be a force that tore through the void.”

A smile appeared on Situ Qianxun’s face as he gently tapped his knee with his right hand.

“Patriarch, do you mean that the power he used was a planar projection? How is this possible? It must be at least a top-notch existence in the Investiture of

Gods to project a plane from it, isn’t it?”

Divine Doctor Lu shook his head and denied Situ Qianxun’s guess.

In the early years, Evil Exterminator also used spatial projection.

That was only in purgatory.

However, Dimensional Projection was of a higher grade. The energy required to project between different planes was even more different.

According to the legend of the Investiture of Gods, the number of times the

Zenith Heaven Immortal showed his divinity could be counted on one hand.

Moreover, they were all top-ranked immortals. That was why they could be projected from the Investiture of Gods.

With Qin Yu’s current situation, it was 100% impossible.

“There are two possibilities now. One is that the spaces in the incomplete Investiture of Gods are not connected, but this possibility is not high. The other is the change that just happened. Qin Yu’s power temporarily broke through the limit and a portion of his consciousness was projected into this world.”

Divine Doctor Lu analyzed the only two possibilities.

“I’m more inclined to the second possibility. In other words, this child has a power comparable to that of an expert during the Investiture of Gods period. This power allowed him to break through just now.”

Situ Qianxun said with a smile.

“It’s a discovery for us anyway. Imprison him near the Treasure Continent.

Don’t let him leave!”

Situ Qianxun chuckled and stood up.

He suddenly pointed his finger and holy energy exploded from Divine Doctor Lu’s body.

The Eight Fatal Needles were like buzzing sounds as they pierced into the eight acupoints on the finger.

The Eight Fatal Needles reversed Yin and Yang!

A reversed Eight Trigram Formation suddenly formed with the eight needles.

The sound of a tide came from his fingertips.

The space in front of him suddenly turned upside down.

The terrifying power shattered the power of the eight trigrams formed by the eight needles.

A force hit Divine Doctor Lu. His feet slid on the ground for thousands of meters before he finally stopped.

At this moment, Divine Doctor Lu’s face was flushed red. Countless bones in his body were broken and shattered.

His clothes were completely soaked. Seawater dripped from the corner of his clothes.

His hair was stuck to his forehead.

All these proved that the finger had brought him to a divine sea.

After the power entered his body, it continued to move around.

It had completely made up for the loss of the Eight Fatal Needles.

All of Divine Doctor Lu’s injuries had been completely healed. In an instant, his thoughts were clear.

It seemed like the power of the Eight Fatal Needles had changed.

It was a subconscious change in his body.

At this moment, the eight needles appeared again. The Eight Fatal Needles erupted with a roar that was like a dragon’s roar.

The eight needles trembled violently as if they would fly out at any moment to unleash a shocking attack.

Hiss!

Cold sweat trickled down Divine Doctor Lu’s face and dripped onto the ground.

“That’s right. This is the power of the Investiture of Gods. We can already use the weakest power of this incomplete version.”

Situ Qianxun’s voice was mixed with an unconcealable madness.

After obtaining the incomplete Investiture of Gods, the Situ family gathered the strength of all the top geniuses in the family.

They worked together to develop this magical artifact from the Primordial Chaos Era. Through the past information collection, they also had a trace of the power to use it.

However, this was still very dangerous. Three of the Situ Clan’s top geniuses had already died in the experiment.

This was a magical artifact that could change the overall situation. If they could continue to develop it, they would not dare to continue guessing what kind of progress the Situ family would make in the future.

“Young Lord has made a great contribution this time! Even the past Situ family’s patriarchs have never achieved such a feat by giving up the talisman of the Luo River Divine Map and the Divine Sun Vine to obtain an incomplete version of the Investiture of Gods.”

Divine Doctor Lu sighed.

However, he was still a little worried after he left. Fatty Situ’s current condition did make him a little worried.

This person was the same as Situ Qianxun, but also different.

Given the Situ family’s strength, Fatty Situ should be the type of person with low emotions.

However, Fatty Situ would have a deeper emotional expression towards those he approved of.

When he was seven years old, his pet cat died in an accident.

He had been immersed in grief for nearly three years. In the end, he had to use eight needles to stop his memory.

Only then did Fatty Situ relieved. This time, it was hard to say if Fatty Situ could pull himself together to face Qin Yu who saved his life. However, Situ Qianxun seemed to be immersed in the power of the Investiture of Gods..VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
