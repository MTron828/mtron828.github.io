Chapter 1545: Chapter 1,545, absolute dance’s frankness 1

Qu Zhu, who was about to leave, suddenly felt a headache coming on.

He rubbed his head and said, “Absolute dance, I really didn’t say anything.”

“Don’t think that I didn’t hear it,”absolute dance rolled her eyes and said.

Qin Yu also hurried up and said, “I really didn’t say anything. We were just chatting...”

Without saying anything, Jue Wu sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

She shook her calves and said, “I heard everything you said. It’s about my constitution, right?”

Qin Yu’s face slightly changed.

Heard It?

This should be a very difficult problem for Jue Wu to accept, right?

“Sigh.”

At this time, qu Zhu sighed.

He sat down again and slowly said, “Qin Yu, as a nirvana body, Jue Wu naturally knows about his constitution problem.”

“As for Jue Wu, the current Qin Yu is no longer the same Qin Yu from before. Not long ago, he killed first elder and also killed one of Sima Bei’s clones.”

......

As soon as these words were said, Jue Wu immediately turned pale with fright!

“Killed one of Sima Bei’s clones? Is it that Sima bei from the Northern Lands?”Jue Wu jumped down from Qin Yu’s body and said with a shocked expression.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “At that time, he was already injured. However... even if he was at his peak condition, I might not be afraid of him.”

Jue Wu widened her eyes and said, “Are you bragging? I’ve seen so for myself that Sima Bei’s ability. Even I don’t have absolute confidence to take him down. You...”

“Jue Wu, don’t underestimate the potential of the chaotic body.”Qu Zhu took a pot of wine from his waist and took a sip.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Zhu in surprise and said, “Brother Qu Zhu, you even know about the chaotic body?”

Qu Zhu spread his hands and didn’t say anything.

He didn’t expect this guy to be so knowledgeable. He really knew a lot of things.

“Not bad, Kid.”Jue Wu jumped up and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“Your current ability is probably not inferior to mine, right?”

Qu Zhu smiled and said, “Now, the outside world is saying that the current Qin Yu is already comparable to the three madmen and three ultimate.”

“Not bad, not bad.”Jue Wu patted her small hand, looking quite pleased.

Qin Yu said seriously, “So there are many problems now. There’s no need to hide it from me. For example, the problem with your body.”

Jue Wu waved her hand and said, “That’s nothing. I’ve enjoyed it for nearly a thousand years. I’ve lived enough.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.

“Any problem has a solution,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and said, “If I can’t find a solution in the south region, I’ll go to the central region. If I can’t find it in the central region, I’ll leave the Holy Region and travel across the universe.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s generous words, Jue Wu felt a little warm in her heart.

Although she looked carefree, she was still a girl.

Which girl could accept losing her looks, especially in such a short period of time.

“Okay, let’s not talk about this anymore.”Qu Zhu changed the topic.

“Jue Wu, tell us about the situation at the northern border. Our Qin Yu is planning to go to the northern border,”qu Zhu joked.

Jue Wu sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder again and said in a deep voice, “The current situation at the northern border is not optimistic.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Are their people very strong?”

“Being strong is one aspect,”Jue Wu said with her hand on her cheek.

“The most troublesome thing is their spatial formation.”

“Because the northern and southern regions have a dead sea that is difficult to cross, the people of the northern region can enter the southern region, but we can’t go to their old camp.”

“Many times, when their people were about to be killed, they were sent back by the spatial formation.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. I saw so for myself not long ago.”

“Is there no solution?”Qu Zhu asked.

Jue Wu said, “Yes, Xiao Hai is thinking of a solution now. He has a bold and crazy idea.”

“What Idea?”Qin Yu and Qu Zhu said almost at the same time.

Jue Wu said, “Xiao Hai plans to forcefully pull the southern region and the northern land together!”

“Forcefully pull them together?”Qin Yu could not help but be stunned.

“Yes, the northern land and the southern region are slowly approaching, but according to our calculations, it will take at least three to five years,”Jue Wu continued.

“But three to five years is too long. Such a long time is enough for the northern regions to exhaust us to death, so Xiao Hai plans to use brute force to forcefully pull these two large plates.”

Qin Yu could not help but say with a shocked expression, “This... isn’t this a little too crazy?”

“Yes.”Jue Wu spread out his hands.

“That guy is indeed crazy when he does things.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying, “I have a general understanding. I will set off for the northern border in a few days.”

“Why are you in such a hurry?”Jue Wu said with some surprise.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There’s no time to lose. If you delay, things will change.”

Jue Wu thought for a moment and said, “Then wait for me for a moment.”

After saying that, she ran away like a wisp of smoke.

A few minutes later, Jue Wu returned to Qin Yu with a bracelet.

This bracelet was flickering in gray, and it seemed to be made of wood.

And on this bracelet, there was a familiar aura.

This aura was the internal Qi of the void.

“Take this. Maybe it can save your life,”Jue Wu said.

Qin Yu took the bracelet and said with a smile, “An internal Qi of the void shouldn’t mean much to me, right?”

“Aiya, I told you to take it, so you just took it. Why are you talking so much nonsense?”Jue Wu rolled her eyes.

“In a chaotic battle, a void-level artifact is still very useful.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Bringing up this topic, Qin Yu suddenly thought of Qingyan Forest.

Qin Yu still hadn’t been able to avenge the hatred of Qingyan Forest. The death of the group leader was inextricably related to Qin Yu.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and said, “I plan to go to the Hunter Organization.”

“What are you going there for?”Jue Wu asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu waved the virtual entity in his hand and said with a smile, “This virtual entity should not be comparable to the white bone club of the Hunter organization, right?”

“Of course not. Rumor has it that the white bone club is a saint’s weapon, but it has not been fully resurrected,”Jue Wu said with certainty.

At this point, Jue Wu seemed to have thought of something. She looked at Qin Yu in puzzlement and said, “What are you going to do?”

“I’m going to snatch it over,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Snatch it over? Qin Yu, don’t underestimate that big white bone club. Even if you are very strong now, you are definitely not a match for that big white bone club.”Absolute dance wrinkled her little nose.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “The good stuff depends on who has it.”

Moreover, Qin Yu also had a powerful magical artifact in his hands.

Putting aside the divine picture, just this iron rod alone was enough to make them drink a pot of wine.
