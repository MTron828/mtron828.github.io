Chapter 91: Shut up! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Yongxiu and his two bodyguards soon appeared at the door.

The door was deliberately left open, as if he was waiting for them.

This surprised Yan Yongxiu somewhat.

Qin Yu hurriedly got up and walked forward to say, “Greetings, Mr. Yan.”

Yan Yongxiu didn’t pay attention to him. He walked straight to the sofa and sat down. Then, the bodyguards beside him lit a cigar for him.

It was impossible to say that Qin Yu wasn’t nervous when facing such a person. However, Qin Yu tried his best to appear calm.

Yan Yongxiu took a puff of his cigar and said indifferently, “You knew that I would come?”

“No, I didn’t know.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“I just happened to see you from outside the window.”

Yan Yongxiu couldn’t help but laugh. He slowly stood up and walked in front of Qin Yu. He asked directly, “What qualifications do you have to be with my daughter?”

Qin Yu was stunned.

This question was indeed difficult for him to answer.

Currently, Qin Yu wasn’t worthy of Yan Ruoxue in any aspect. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The two of them were worlds apart in terms of social status.

Qin Yu fell into silence and didn’t speak for a long time.

Yan Yongxiu couldn’t help but shake his head. He slowly stood up and said in a low voice, “It seems that my daughter has overestimated you.”

“Mr. Yan.” At this moment, Qin Yu finally opened his mouth.

He took a deep breath and said, “Currently, I am indeed a nobody, but give me a year’s time. I will prove that I am worthy of Miss Yan.”

“A year’s time?” Yan Yongxiu narrowed his eyes and then said coldly, “Why should I wait for you for a year? What qualifications do you have to make me give you a year’s time?”

Qin Yu looked at Yan Yongxiu and said word by word, “I’m worth you waiting for.”

“Hahahahaha!” Yan Yongxiu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Young man, you’ve only been a frog in the well in Jiangcheng! How much have you seen of the real world?” Yan Yongxiu said coldly.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Mr. Yan, one who has made great progress in a short period of time should be treated differently! My current achievements are indeed nothing in your eyes, but there’s still a long way to go. No one can dismiss my future potential!”

“Oh really?” Yan Yongxiu raised his eyebrows.

Yan Yongxiu, who was about to leave, stopped again.

“Don’t think that I don’t understand you,” Yan Yongxiu said coldly.

“The only thing you are proud of now is your martial arts skills, right?” Yan Yongxiu narrowed his eyes, as if he wanted to see through Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t deny it.

Just as Yan Yongxiu said, what Qin Yu could rely on now were indeed his martial arts skills and cultivation methods.

When Yan Yongxiu saw this, he couldn’t help but snort, “Your mediocre skills aren’thing in my eyes! Any of my subordinates can kill you with the flip of a wrist!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the bodyguard beside Yan Yongxiu took a step forward and said coldly, “My name is Yan Jiang, President Yan’s bodyguard.”

After saying that, Yan Jiang gestured at Qin Yu with a provocative look on his face.

Qin Yu stood there motionlessly.

He knew very well that he was no match for Yan Jiang.

“What? You don’t even have the guts to fight?” Yan Yongxiu said coldly.

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately clenched his fist.

He looked at Yan Jiang, and a belligerent look appeared in his eyes!

In fact, Qin Yu also wanted to know how powerful these so-called top martial artists were!

When he saw Qin Yu’s reaction, Yan Jiang couldn’t help but sneer.

He beckoned Qin Yu again and said, “Show me your trump card. Let me see it.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He mobilized the internal spiritual energy in his body and heightened it to the max.

“Mr. Yan, then I won’t go easy on you.” Qin Yu said with some expectation.

“Yan Jiang, be mindful,” Yan Yongxiu reminded him.

Yan Yongxiu also felt a little helpless. If it were any other time, he wouldn’t even bat an eye even if he killed Qin Yu.

However, this kid was the man that Yan Ruoxue liked. If anything really happened to him, his daughter would probably hate him for the rest of her life.

Yan Jiang nodded and said, “Yes, Mr. Yan.”

After saying that, Yan Jiang beckoned Qin Yu again.

Qin Yu didn’t hesitate at all. He roared angrily, clenched his fist, and rushed toward Yan Jiang!

The speed of his punch was extremely fast, and its strength was even more powerful! Qin Yu used up almost all of his strength to prove himself!

However, when the fist was about to touch Yan Jiang, Yan Jiang dodged it agilely.

“How... how is this possible?!” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly!

He didn’t even see Yan Jiang’s dodging move clearly! He clearly saw that he had already punched him!

“Again.” Yan Jiang’s eyes were filled with some amusement.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, roared angrily, and charged towards Yan Jiang again!

This time, Qin Yu used both his fists and legs, and his speed was raised to the peak!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already thrown out dozens of punches!

However, what made Qin Yu feel despair was that these dozens of punches didn’t even touch Yan Jiang’s clothes! Instead, it had exhausted him!

Qin Yu panted heavily, and layers of sweat appeared on his forehead.

On the other hand, Yan Jiang was calm and composed with his internal spiritual energy stable.

“Hmph, is that all you’ve got?” Yan Jiang sneered.

“If this is your trump card, then I advise you to give up early,” Yan Yongxiu also said coldly.

“This mediocre skill of yours... isn’t even worth mentioning in Jingdu! Any young master is far better than you by a thousand times or ten thousand times!” Yan Yongxiu berated loudly!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. He clenched his teeth tightly with defiance!

“Again!” Qin Yu roared and charged towards Yan Jiang once again!

However, the result was the same this time. No matter how hard Qin Yu tried, he couldn’t even touch a single hair on Yan Jiang’s head!

Yan Jiang placed his hands behind his back and allowed Qin Yu to attack. He didn’t have the slightest intention to attack!

“How is this possible?!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but roar repeatedly!

He knew that there was a gap between him and Yan Jiang, but he didn’t expect the gap to be so huge!

“You’re too weak, too weak.” Yan Jiang dodged while shaking his head. The ridicule in his eyes was unconcealed.

“With your little abilities, do you think you are qualified to make Miss Yan wait for you?” Yan Jiang sneered.

“You’d better lie low and stay in Jiangcheng. Miss Yan should be with outstanding people.” Yan Jiang sneered.

“Shut up!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly roared! His internal spiritual energy instantly peaked, and he threw a punch at Yan Jiang’s face!

The sudden increase in speed made Yan Jiang unable to react in time!

This punch landed squarely on Yan Jiang’s face!

Yan Jiang, with anger and disbelief on his face, couldn’t help but take a step back!

On the other hand, Yan Yongxiu seemed to be somewhat intrigued.

Qin Yu stood in the distance while panting heavily.

He grinned and said, “So you aren’t invincible... hehe...”
