2135 Where the Path of Heaven Descends

Qin Yu stared at the Soul Chasing Chain on his body and said softly, “Reincarnation begins with birth and ends with death. The path of escape lies in breaking the chains.”

In an instant, the cultivation in his body soared. A powerful aura emitted from his body and skyrocketed into the sky.

After that, Qin Yu’s finger lightly tapped in the air. Instantly, a mysterious rune appeared at the tip of his finger. It was a unique secret technique, particularly for undoing the Soul Chasing Chain.

This method was inherited from the Traceless Immortal Scripture. Qin Yu had long mastered the escape method, so he did not panic at all.

He slowly placed the rune on the Soul Chasing Chain, then used his true energy to activate the rune. He watched as the rune burned on the Soul Chasing Chain.

The runes burned with increasing intensity. Just as the Soul Chasing Chain was about to melt, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes and roared, “Break!”

Following his furious roar, the runes on the Soul Chasing Chain instantly exploded. Instantly, the cracking sound rang out endlessly!

In just a while, the Soul Chasing Chain broke apart and turned into dust!

Qin Yu looked at the indestructible wall. He gently clenched his fist, and the golden light instantly soared!

In his palm, golden light flowed, and stars shone. Suddenly, his body shook, and he fiercely pressed forward with all his might.

Qin Yu’s fist was like a shooting star that broke through the air, striking the indestructible wall of the prison.

At that moment, it was as if the entire world fell silent.

“Boom!”

In an instant, a deafening earth-shattering explosion suddenly sounded. The prison wall seemed to have been hit by an unstoppable force and instantly cracked, forming a huge gap.

The golden dao technique was like the sun illuminating the prison.

Qin Yu did not stop there. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he instantly dashed out and quickly left the prison. He leaped and rushed into the sky.

Immediately after, Qin Yu stepped on the line word formula and shot toward where the Path of Heaven descended at an incredible speed!

Such a big commotion naturally shocked First Elder and the others. The expressions of the three linen-robed elders changed, and they hurriedly returned to the prison.

When they saw the hole in the warship, their expressions instantly turned extremely ugly.

“This kid… He actually escaped!” a linen-robed elderly man said coldly.

At this moment, First Elder also walked in from outside.

“Look, what’s that!” At this moment, an elderly man suddenly discovered something.

A golden text was left on the wall. “Thank you for sending me off. We’ll meet again!”

Seeing the sentence, the few people, already filled with immense anger, turned even more livid, and their faces were ashen.

“This kid actually dares to ridicule us!” a linen-robed elderly man said in a low voice, full of anger.

First Elder sighed slightly. He knew that this outcome could no longer be changed.

“Chase! Chase after him immediately!” another linen-robed elderly man roared.

However, First Elder stopped them just as they were about to chase.

“It’s meaningless,” First Elder said in a deep voice. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

A linen-robed elderly man frowned and seemed puzzled.

First Elder raised his finger and pointed at where the Path of Heaven descended. He said, “After passing through that barrier, no one can make a move. Qin Yu has probably stepped into it long ago.”

The crowd fell silent.

Although they were tremendously unwilling, they knew what First Elder said was true.

“This kid broke the Soul Chasing Chain again. He does have some ability,” a linen-robed elderly man said in a low voice.

“Don’t worry. Although no one can touch him when the day the Path of Heaven arrives, once it ends, this kid will die for sure!” another person said coldly.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu had already shot toward the barrier.

This barrier was jointly set up by the various aristocratic families to prevent too many people from entering.

Outside the barrier, cultivators were everywhere.

They sat cross-legged like fish nearly dying of thirst, desperately absorbing the power of rules of the dao technique.

Such a barrier naturally could not stop Qin Yu.

Qin Yu stood outside the barrier and could not help but snort coldly.

In the next moment, he suddenly increased his cultivation. His figure was like a bolt of lightning as he directly broke through the barrier.

All the spectators were stunned. They did not expect this young man, the focus of everybody’s attention, could break through the barrier so easily.

“It’s Qin Yu. He’s here!” someone recognized Qin Yu and could not help but whisper.

Everyone had mixed feelings. Some were envious, while others were jealous.

They understood that Qin Yu had also cultivated step by step from the bottom up until now. But now, he had become one of the experts.

“Sigh!” Someone sighed helplessly and closed his eyes.

On the other end of the barrier, a mysterious scene unfolded before Qin Yu’s eyes.

It was a world that shimmered with radiant light, filled with the formidable power of the way.

That was the Path of Heaven, an existence that all living beings could not resist.

Inside the barrier, it was like another world.

The light was radiant there, illuminating the entire space.

Boundless aura surged like sea waves. It was the power of the way and the charm of the Path of Heaven.

Floating islands of various shapes and sizes surrounded it.

They looked broken but attracted and repelled each other as if a mysterious force was wandering within them.

On each island, there were ancient stone tablets, strange statues, and countless runes flowing in them, shining with charming light.

In the sky, rainbow-like beams of light connected the islands, like a grand and mysterious painting scroll.

These light beams contained traces of dao power. At times, they were as dense as a river, and at times, they were as sparse as the morning fog. They were full of changes, but they also appeared in order.

In the middle of the light beams, some cultivators were cultivating in the air. They absorbed the power of the Path of Heaven to pursue a higher realm. Some were shuttling among the islands, searching for their own dao.

The entire space was filled with a mysterious and ancient internal qi as if it had existed for billions of years.

Here, the power of the Path of Heaven was so dense that one could even feel it directly.

Even though it was so bright, there was no trace of warmth, only a faint chill.

It was the coldness that came from the depths of the world. It was the indifference of the Path of Heaven and the profundity of the universe.

In this space, everything seemed to be magnified, including the cultivators’ desires, pursuits, and persistence.

Here, they could come into close contact with the Path of Heaven, feel its power, and understand its way.

However, before Qin Yu could carefully experience this place where the Path of Heaven descended, he saw numerous familiar figures.
