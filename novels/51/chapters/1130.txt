Chapter 1131: Chapter 1,131, improving the fighting formula 

Tian Zong’s corpse was lying on the ground. Yun Long, who was fighting with Chang Mang, had a bad feeling.

He had no intention of fighting with Chang Mang, so he immediately planned to escape.

“Do you think you can escape?”Qin Yu’s cold voice sounded in his ears.

With the support of the desolate divine eye, nothing could be hidden.

Before Yun Long could escape, Qin Yu had already punched a certain spot in the void!

“Ka-cha!”

The void immediately shook violently, causing Yun long, who was hiding in the void, to fall out!

“Don’t Kill Me!”Yun long roared.

“Qin Yu, hand him over to me!”Chang Mang waved his iron-like arm and swung it over!

No one could resist the overwhelming force!

Yun long, Chang Mang, slapped his chest with his arm, and blood immediately gushed out!

Yun long got up from the ground and wanted to escape into the void again, but Qin Yu immediately shook his feet, and rays of light spread out in all directions!

The same old trick was used again! This was the heavy falling space!

Yun Long’s control of space spells was far inferior to Tian Zong’s. The moment the heavy falling space was cast, his speed of escaping into the void instantly slowed down.

Chang Mang seized this opportunity and took a step forward. A fist the size of a casserole headed straight for Yun Long’s head!

“Kacha!”

The strength of this punch was not inferior to Qin Yu’s. It directly shattered Yun Long’s head along with his divine sense!

Fresh blood splattered in all directions, and his skull shattered into dregs.

Yun Long’s body fell from mid-air. He no longer had any signs of internal Qi.

“Damn it, I’ve finally caught you!”Chang Mang stared at Yun Long’s corpse and cursed.

The surrounding martial artists couldn’t help but sigh in their hearts.

From today onwards, who in the world would dare to offend these two? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Before the opening of the Holy Region, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Qin Yu was the number one person in the world!

Even if it was an unborn almighty, he probably wouldn’t dare to Offend Qin Yu again!

“Mr. Qin is truly unparalleled under the heavens.”Someone walked forward and cupped his hands.

“This level of strength is enough to look down on all heroes.”

“From today onwards, I’m afraid that no one can be compared to Brother Qin.”

Everyone cupped their hands one after another, as if they were congratulating him, but also as if they were trying to build a relationship.

Qin Yu thanked them one by one. He looked towards Tian Zong’s corpse and said, “I’ll leave that corpse to you guys to handle.”

When they heard this, everyone was stunned for a moment before swarming forward!

The bodies of mighty figures could be said to be filled with treasures. Bones could be used to forge peerless divine weapons, and fresh blood could be used to refine medicine!

However, none of this was of much use to Qin Yu. He might as well do them a favor.

While everyone was fighting over the corpse, Qin Yu had already turned around and left.

...

In the room, Qin Yu’s internal Qi was rapidly decreasing.

“I didn’t expect Tian Zong to really die.”Even the pavilion master couldn’t help but sigh.

“If that’s the case, I think those eight higher-ups don’t have to be afraid anymore,”Xu Huaigu said from the side.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It wasn’t easy for me to win against him.”

This battle seemed to be quite easy, but people who knew knew knew that every punch and kick of the two’s exchange contained the pinnacle of both parties’Daoist techniques and spiritual power. The slightest carelessness could lead to eternal damnation.

Moreover, the strength that Tian Zong displayed was only half a step away from a mighty figure. If he burned his blood essence and forcibly restored his strength, Qin Yu might not be able to defeat him.

“That mighty figure will probably leave the first secret realm in less than ten days. It seems that he won’t be able to do much in just ten days,”pavilion master said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s impossible to raise one’s realm in ten days. No one can do it, but there is still hope to raise one’s strength.”

For example, the fighting word formula, the green wood true body, and even the nine transformation golden pill.

This would be Qin Yu’s last resort.

“That’s eight mighty figures...”

Thinking about it, one couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “There’s no other way. The enmity has already been formed. Naturally, we have to face it.”

“Qin Yu, don’t worry. I’ll fight alongside you!”Chang Mang patted his chest and said.

“Yes, and Chang Mang.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of Chang Mang’s formidable combat strength!

His strength was absolutely not inferior to his own. Every punch contained extreme strength! It was just that he lacked the support of spells!

If he was like Qin Yu and had many spells, his strength might not be inferior to Qin Yu!

“Senior Jiang He!”Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Jiang he.

“I implore senior Jiang he to impart the ‘Dou’formula to Chang Mang!”

“‘Dou’formula? What is that?”Chang Mang asked in a slightly honest manner.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “It’s an extremely powerful technique. Such a technique would be a top-notch secret art even in the Holy Region.”

In just ten days, it was impossible to learn too many techniques. To be able to comprehend the ‘Dou’formula was already good enough.

“Alright.”Jiang he hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement.

“Thank you, Senior!”Qin Yu bowed in gratitude.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry to enter seclusion. This battle had consumed too much of his divine sense and physical strength, and he needed some time to recover.

Therefore, he returned to his room and fell asleep.

At this moment, the news of Qin Yu killing a mighty figure had already spread throughout the five lakes and four seas.

Who knows how many talented people came because of the fame and gathered in the Heaven Gate.
