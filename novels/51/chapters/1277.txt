Chapter 1278: Chapter 1,278, the overbearing golden wheel 

Guan Zhuang could not help but widen his eyes, which were like copper bells.

Qin Yu sighed, then looked at Guan Zhuang and said, “When you came out, no one made things difficult for you, right?”

“No, but it’s not good to stay here for long. They will definitely notice later,”said Guan Zhuang.

“Let’s go back quickly.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I’m worried that if I go back, I’ll implicate the entire Hunter Organization.”

Guan Zhuang waved his hand and said, “Most likely not. Even the Heavenly Cloud sect isn’t willing to shed all pretense of cordiality with our hunter organization.”

Qin Yu had heard this before, but he wasn’t too sure.

That team leader didn’t seem too strong, and Qin Yu hadn’t seen many experts in the entire hunter organization.

Even the so-called king of hunters, Jin Lun, was only in the middle stage of the Almighty Realm.

How could such strength make the Heavenly Cloud Sect Afraid?

Guan Zhuang saw Qin Yu’s doubt and said indifferently, “Don’t forget, the hunter organization is extremely huge, and our supply is spread throughout the entire South Province and even more than half of the Li Province!”

“Do you know how many people’s interests are involved? If the hunter organization is eliminated, it would be the same as touching most people’s cake. Would the Heavenly Cloud sect do this?”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

It turned out that even in the cultivation world, there was a figure of capital.

Once someone monopolized a certain industry, it meant that they would have an extremely high status.

“Then let’s hurry back,”said Qin Yu.

Guan Zhuangen replied. The two of them did not say anything more and rushed toward the hunter organization.

When they were about to arrive at the hunter organization, Guan Zhuangen stopped in his tracks.

He said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, it’s best that you don’t tell anyone about this in case it causes unnecessary panic.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry, I understand.”

Then, the two of them rushed back to the hunter organization.

As soon as they returned, Zhong Wu ran up eagerly.

The moment he saw Zhong Wu, Qin Yu immediately felt a little awkward.

Qin Yu had long forgotten what he asked Qin Yu to bring.

“That... I’m sorry. I forgot what you asked me to bring,”Qin Yu said awkwardly.

Zhong Wu was stunned, then he waved his hand and said, “It’s okay. I didn’t tell you that.”

He looked around, then came in front of Qin Yu and whispered, “That golden wheel didn’t leave. He’s waiting for you.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s eyes immediately lit up.

“Really?”Qin Yu said with some surprise.

Zhong wu frowned and said, “Qin Yu, this golden wheel is not simple. You...”

“I know.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Guan Zhuang, who was at the side, scolded, “Don’t meddle in other people’s business. Get lost!”

Qin Yu followed Guan Zhuang and walked towards the hunter organization.

Soon, Jing Bai walked over as well.

He blocked Qin Yu’s path and asked, “How is it? Did you buy all the equipment?”

“Yes, it’s all here.”Guan Zhuang shook his spatial magic artifact.

Jing Bai nodded slightly. Then, his gaze fell on Qin Yu. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Jin Lun is waiting for you. Hurry up and leave,”Jing Bai said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Why should I leave? I want to see so for myself.”

Jing Bai said with a dark face, “Qin Yu, this Jin Lun...”

“I know he is not simple,”Qin Yu interrupted Jing Bai.

“If he is a simple opponent, I don’t want to find him,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Jing Bai frowned and advised earnestly, “Qin Yu, Jin Lun has rich combat experience. I don’t know how many demonic beasts he has killed. I know that you are not ordinary, but it is better to avoid the sharp edge for now.”

Qin Yu was about to speak when two strong men suddenly walked over.

“You are Qin Yu?”The two strong men quickly walked forward. One of them even raised his hand and placed it on Jing Bai’s shoulder.

Jing Bai frowned slightly. He tried to shake off the two men’s palms, but found that the two men’s strength was extremely great.

“Jing Bai, what do you mean? You want to let him go? Do you want to offend our boss Jin Lun?”The two men said with a faint smile.

As they spoke, the strength in their hands became heavier and heavier.

These two men were huge, and their palms were like cattail fans.

Jing Bai, on the other hand, was quite delicate and pretty. This palm almost pinched his entire arm, causing him unbearable pain.

Qin Yu coldly glanced at the brawny man and said, “Let go.”

The Brawny man raised his eyebrows. He sized up Qin Yu and said, “Are you talking to me?”

“Or what? You’d better release Jing Bai immediately. I don’t want to repeat myself,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The burly man mocked, “Kid, you... Ah! ! !”

Before he could finish his words, Qin Yu suddenly stretched out his hand and broke his arm!

The arm that was as thick as a tree trunk was shattered instantly! Even the bones were shattered into pieces!

Fresh blood splattered all over Jing Bai’s face, but Jing Bai’s expression was getting uglier and uglier.

He knew that this battle was inevitable.

“Kid, just you wait!”The Brawny man covered his broken arm and said fiercely.

“If you’re a man, don’t Run!”The other person warned.

Qin Yu sneered, “Why should I run? I’ll wait for Jin Lun here.”

“Good, good. You have guts!”The two men threw down these words and turned to leave in a hurry.

Qin Yu looked at Jing Bai and said, “Are you okay?”

Jing bai frowned and said, “Qin Yu, Jin Lun is an extremely overbearing person. You hurt his people, so he definitely won’t let it go.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I’m not afraid of him.”

Jing Bai wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Qin Yu with a wave of his hand.

“Brother Guan, give the equipment to Jing Bai. I’ll go back to my room first,”said Qin Yu.

Guan Zhuang opened his mouth, but in the end, he only nodded.
