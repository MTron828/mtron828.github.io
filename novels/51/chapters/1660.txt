“How is this possible!”The elementalist was instantly enraged, causing the entire snow mountain to Rumble!

“The techniques I left behind are definitely not something he can resist!”

The techniques left behind by the elementalist were indeed not something Qin Yu could resist.

However, in reality, Qin Yu had won.

The elementalist remained silent, while the three godly monarchs were trembling.

They were afraid that the furious elementalist would vent his anger on them.

“Unless... he still has some secret treasures on him.”After a moment, the elementalist finally spoke.

He Teng, who was at the side, immediately replied, “Master, Qin Yu indeed has a lot of treasures on him...”

“Why? Are you very familiar with him?”The elementalist asked coldly.

He teng en replied, “We come from the same place. We can be considered old acquaintances.”

“HMPH, as expected.”The elementalist snorted coldly.

“Master, what should we do now?”Sima bei asked. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The elementalist said coldly, “Wait for me to recover. As long as I fully recover, no one can stop me.”

“But... We can’t go to the southern region now.”Sima bei sighed.

The elementalist snorted. “Then we’ll go somewhere else. If there’s no other way, then we’ll start from the north!”

“In short, no matter the price, we must ensure that I can be resurrected in one piece as soon as possible!”

Sima Bei and the others had ugly expressions on their faces.

Start from the north? One had to know that these people were extremely loyal to the north.

Sima bei wanted to give some advice, but in the end, he didn’t say anything.

...

Mount Dayue.

Qin Yu lay on the bed and fell into a deep sleep. He didn’t know how many days had passed before he slowly woke up.

“You’re Awake?”

The moment he opened his eyes, he saw the extremely wretched Wen da sitting beside him.

Qin Yu was so frightened that he staggered. He hurriedly got up from the bed and said, “What are you doing?”

Wen Da rolled his eyes and said, “Taking care of you. Speaking of which, why are you sleeping so deeply? Also, what kind of dream did you have?”

“Dream?”Qin Yu was startled.

He looked at Wen da suspiciously and said, “What do you mean?”

Wen da muttered, “These few days when you were unconscious, you kept repeating a name. It seems to be Yan... Yan... Xue...”

At this point, Big Wen chuckled and said, “Tell Big Brother, who is this Yan... Xue?”

Qin Yu’s old face turned red, and he kicked Big Wen to the side.

“Don’t talk nonsense. Don’t ask about things you shouldn’t,”Qin Yu muttered.

Just as the two of them were fooling around, Wen Er walked in from outside.

“Qin Yu, you’re awake. It just so happens that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is here. He wants to see you,”Wen er said.

“The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”Qin Yu frowned.

Wen Er grunted and then whispered, “You have quite a reputation. It’s rare for him to come and look for you in person.”

Qin Yu sat on the bed for a moment, then stood up and said, “Take me there.”

On the great Yue Mountain, next to a pond outside.

There was a wooden table placed here, and the environment next to it was quite beautiful.

However, there wasn’t tea on the table, but wine. Wen wanye was drinking while bragging to Xiao Sheng.

“You know, I, Wen wanye, have never taken these three madmen and three unique skills seriously. If I didn’t have diarrhea back then, I would definitely be one of them!”Wen wanye said proudly.

Xiao Sheng sat cross-legged and smiled without saying anything. The two people’s images formed a sharp contrast.

“Like what Yongji Stream? I’ve wanted to fuck him for a long time! When he comes to the South Province next time, I’ll definitely fuck him!”Wen wanye cursed.

Speaking up to this point, Wen wanye seemed to have thought of something.

He said with some sadness, “It’s a pity that Jiwu is dead. Sigh, I really don’t know how she is now...”

“The lifespan of a nirvana body is very difficult to last over a thousand years. Jiwu is already several hundred years old,”Xiao Sheng said.

“You already knew about Jue Wu’s physique?”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s voice came from behind.

Xiao sheng nodded and said, “I have some understanding.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then do you know how this Nirvana body can break this curse?”

“I don’t know,”Xiao Sheng said without hesitation.

“People’s life and death are fated. I advise you not to waste your efforts.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t think so. Moreover... Jue Wu is still alive. I will definitely wake her up and break the curse on her body.”

Xiao Sheng raised his eyebrows and continued, “Do you know how terrifying the Nirvana body without the curse is? Do you know how fast their cultivation speed is?”

“If you can really break the curse on her body, Jue Wu will definitely become one of the strongest people in this world.”

Qin Yu sat at the side and sighed, “That would be the best.”

Xiao Sheng did not continue this topic. He asked, “I really want to know how you survived in the domain.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “You came to me for this question?”

“It’s one of the questions,”Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu did not hide it and said, “I relied on a secret treasure. As for what it is, I can’t tell you for the time being.”

Xiao Sheng did not continue to ask about this topic.

He asked in a deep voice, “When did you create the phenomenon?”

Qin Yu could not help but laugh when this topic was brought up.

“Speaking of which, I have to thank you. The last time I discussed Dao with you, it gave me a lot of inspiration. Perhaps it was because of that opportunity,”Qin Yu said.

Xiao Sheng nodded slightly and did not continue to ask.

“I also have a question to ask you,”Qin Yu suddenly said at this time.

Xiao Sheng didn’t say anything and signaled Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Back then, I killed your son. Why didn’t you kill me?”

“All this time, I thought you were afraid of something or that you didn’t have that ability. But now, it seems that if you wanted to kill me back then, it would have been effortless. I’m afraid that no one in the entire South Province can stop you. Wen Wanyu can’t do it, and so can jue Wu.”

Xiao Sheng was silent for a long time. Then, he raised his head to look at Qin Yu and said, “Someone tried to persuade me.”

“Someone tried to persuade you? Who?”Qin Yu was instantly stunned and hurriedly asked.

In that instant, countless names flashed through Qin Yu’s mind.

Could it be that the Yan family had warned Xiao Sheng? One had to know that back when Qin Yu was on Earth, Yan Ruoxue had sent people to protect him in the dark.

“Xiao Hai.”

But at this time, Xiao Sheng said a name that surprised Qin Yu.

“Xiao Hai...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice and instantly fell into silence.

This was a heavy topic. Although Qin Yu’s heart was full of doubts, he didn’t continue to ask.

“There’s still one more question,”Qin Yu said.

“Today, although I defeated the Northern Land Lord when I was young, you and I both know clearly in our hearts that the fully recovered him can not be compared to the young him.”

“One day, if he comes to Nanzhou, are you sure you can defeat him?”
