Chapter 464: Evenly Matched Battle! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

With his incomparable speed, He Teng was indeed hard to catch.

Qin Yu, without the chance to retaliate, was pushed back repeatedly.

However, just as He Teng attacked Qin Yu for the umpteenth time, a large golden hand suddenly stretched out and grabbed He Teng’s neck!

He Teng’s expression instantly changed!

For some unknown reason, his speed seemed to have slowed by a lot in that instant just now!

It was also in this instant that he slowed down that Qin Yu seized the opportunity and grabbed his neck!

“Have you fought enough? Is it my turn now?” Qin Yu’s powerful palm grabbed He Teng’s neck as he said coldly.

He Teng’s expression changed. He was just about to struggle when the golden palm ruthlessly whipped over!

“Slap!”

A loud sound rang out as he ruthlessly struck He Teng’s face!

The strength of Qin Yu’s physical body was extremely great. Under this smack, He Teng’s mouth immediately began to overflow with blood!

“Slap!”

There was another smack!

Qin Yu exerted all his strength and grabbed He Teng with one hand while his other hand continuously struck He Teng’s face!

One smack, two smacks, three smacks...

The sounds of smacking kept on ringing in their ears, and everyone was dumbfounded by what they saw.

“What... is going on?”

“A half-step Martial Marquis is being smacked around by an Inner Strength Grandmaster?”

“D*mn... It’s as if he’s hitting his son...”

Everyone gasped, as if they couldn’t believe what was happening!

“If this continues, He Teng will be smacked to death...”

“Such pure physical strength is unheard of...”

“Could it be... that it’ll be over just like that?”

Just as everyone was shocked, a black light suddenly erupted from He Teng’s body!

“Enough!”

With a loud shout, the terrifying internal qi directly pushed back Qin Yu! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, He Teng’s body was already enveloped by a black light!

Every inch of his skin appeared to be the purest of black. Under the illumination of the setting sun, it flickered with a strange light.

“Qin Yu, don’t think that only your physical body is strong!” He Teng wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and said angrily!

“You are only an Inner Strength Grandmaster. What right do you have to fight with me, a half-step Martial Marquis?!”

“Even if I can only fight with my physical body, I’m still not afraid of you!”

With He Teng’s explosive shout, the black light on his body became even denser!

Even though the crowd was far away, they could still feel the cold internal qi on He Teng’s body!

Qin Yu stared at this black body and sneered. “What the h*ll? Did you smear dog sh*t on your body?”

He Teng didn’t pay attention to Qin Yu’s insult. After he shouted, he actually took the initiative to rush towards Qin Yu!

“Taking the initiative to fight my physical body? It seems that you are very confident!” Qin Yu snorted coldly. He didn’t waste any more time and immediately shot out explosively while charging towards He Teng!

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

Both sides used only their physical bodies to fight!

Terrifying explosive sounds were like muffled thunder as they continuously burst out in midair!

Black light and golden light interweaved. The extremely fast speed even made it difficult to see clearly!

Amidst the intense blood battle, streams of terrifying power spread out in all directions!

Under the collision of the two, the surrounding hills were all shattered, and the river water even began to evaporate!

The spectators were dumbfounded, and they swallowed hard in fear!

How powerful was this collision? How many years had it been since a fight of this level had happened?

“Boom!”

He Teng’s black fist punched Qin Yu’s chest. It contained powerful internal qi and instantly forced Qin Yu back.

Qin Yu’s fist also smashed into He Teng’s face!

In the next second, both sides launched the second round of attacks!

“Go to h*ll!” He Teng raised his head and roared. The black light turned into a giant dragon and charged towards Qin Yu with a buzzing sound!

Qin Yu didn’t want to be outdone. He immediately used the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist and swung his entire fist!

“Boom!”

The huge collision forced Qin Yu back a few steps!

A mouthful of blood spewed out from his mouth!

Cracks appeared on Qin Yu’s body and the golden light seemed to have dimmed a little.

Even Qin Yu himself didn’t expect that he would be at a disadvantage just from the collision of their bodies.

“The gap between an Inner Strength Grandmaster and a half-step Martial Marquis is really huge,” Qin Yu said in a low voice as he stared at He Teng.

If they were at the same level, Qin Yu would only be able to kill He Teng with a raise of his hand.

However, there was a huge difference in strength even though they were only one level apart.

He Teng looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Is this all of your abilities? It seems that you’re just so-so!”

Qin Yu looked at He Teng and said in a deep voice, “If I step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, I’ll be able to kill you in less than three seconds.”

He Teng’s expression changed, and displeasure flashed across his face.

Although he was unwilling to admit it, Qin Yu was telling the truth.

With the power of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, Qin Yu fighting him to such an extent already made He Teng feel afraid.

If Qin Yu stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, he probably wouldn’t be able to fight back at all.

“It’s precisely because of this that I can’t let you live,” He Teng said with narrowed eyes.

“No matter how strong you are after stepping into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, it’s useless. Because... you will never have that chance!”

Following He Teng’s furious roar, his body began to curl up!

Then, black light began to gather above his head!

The moment this energy gathered, the ground began to tremble!

Streams of divine power spread out from the black light. No one knew what spell He Teng had used, because it didn’t come from the He family!

“The four symbols demonic seal from hundreds of years ago?” Jiang He, who had been silent all this time, suddenly asked.

His disciple hurriedly asked, “Master, what is the four symbols demonic seal?”

Jiang He said in a deep voice, “In the early years, when I traveled the world to cultivate, I once saw the records of this technique. It is said that the complete four symbols demonic seal can suppress everything. Everything will be shattered upon contact.”

“So, does that mean that Qin Yu is going to lose?” His disciple said with some excitement.

Jiang He shook his head and said in a low voice, “In short, it’s not looking good for him.”

As he spoke, the internal qi on Jiang He’s body began to surge.

His disciple hurriedly said, “Master, you promised that you wouldn’t make a move!”

Jiang He opened his mouth. After he hesitated for a while, the internal qi on his body finally slowly disappeared.

The black light was still condensing, as if it had absorbed the essence of the world. The powerful deterrent force was so strong that people could not stop vomiting blood.

There were even people who were turned into minced meat on the spot by this pressure and died tragically.

Even Qin Yu felt an extremely strong pressure, and his body made cracking sounds continuously.

This was a terrifying power. Qin Yu even had the intention to retreat.

“Rumble!”

However, at this moment, countless chains grew out from under Qin Yu’s feet!

These chains seemed to have come from h*ll, and they bound Qin Yu tightly, making him unable to move!

“Since I can’t escape, then I can only take it head-on.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

A divine seal appeared between his brows, and he chanted a spell silently. Golden light flashed on his body, as if he was casting some secret technique!

The surrounding internal qi gathered in Qin Yu’s internal qi, and his physical body seemed to have grown a little bigger.

“This is... the cosmic form?!” Jiang He’s pupils constricted, as if he had realized something.
