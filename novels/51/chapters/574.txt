Chapter 575: The Furious Qin Yu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s fist was extremely fierce. This was practically all of his strength!

“Clang!”

The sound of this punch instantly became louder!

But the iron cage still didn’t move at all. It wasn’t affected at all!

“How... how could this be...” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely flustered.

He refused to give up and once again clenched his fist to smash it.

One punch, two punches, three punches!

Clattering sounds continued to be heard and spread throughout the entire prison.

However, this iron cage wasn’t affected at all!

Qin Yu hurriedly took out his bronze sword. He bit his finger and dropped a drop of blood essence onto it.

Then, Qin Yu held the bronze sword in his hand and ruthlessly hacked it down!

“Clang!”

Another loud sound rang out. Not even a single line was left on the iron cage!

Qin Yu used all of his trump cards and did his best. All kinds of spells appeared one after another, but they were unable to shake the cage in the slightest!

“How could this be...” Qin Yu’s face was filled with despair!

Despite seeing his beloved suffer, he was helpless. This kind of pain was indescribable!

He knelt on the ground with both knees, and tears couldn’t help but flow out.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association... You bunch of b*stards!” Qin Yu’s eyes revealed a fierce light, and his hatred reached its peak at this moment!

“It’s useless...” Yan Ruoxue, who was in the prison, said weakly.

She looked at Qin Yu and said with difficulty, “Talk to me...”

“Okay!” Qin Yu hurriedly stood up from the ground.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue and said in a trembling voice, “Ruoxue, what exactly is going on? Why did Jingdu Martial Arts Association bring you in? What exactly are they going to do?!”

Yan Ruoxue shook her head. She didn’t answer this question. Instead, she said with some relief, “I really didn’t expect you to reach this step so quickly...”

“Did you know that on the day of the decisive battle between you and Han Wei, you were as dazzling as a hero... Qin Yu, I really didn’t misjudge you...”

When he heard Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu’s heart felt like it was being cut by a knife. He was in great pain.

“I must save you!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth. His fingers flickered with golden light as he shot towards the chains on Yan Ruoxue’s body!

“Clang!”

However, this chain-like pipe wasn’t affected either!

“Qin Yu, it’s useless. Don’t waste your energy...” Yan Ruoxue said with difficulty.

“Qin Yu, how have you been during this period of time?”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “I’m fine! I’m now a Martial Marquis. No one can kill me!”

“I killed Gu Canghai, destroyed the Saint Confucian Sect, and established the Green Moon Villa...”

“Next, I want to force Yan Sihai to abdicate. I also want to crush the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Yan Ruoxue smiled gently and said, “Qin Yu, no matter what, you have to protect yourself...”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to speak when a ray of light suddenly flashed in the prison.

This ray of light was extremely bright and carried an extremely strong force!

“Qin Yu, hurry up and leave, or else... you won’t be able to leave...” Yan Ruoxue forced herself to speak.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t want to leave...”

“Boom!”

At this moment, the light poured down on Qin Yu and ruthlessly smashed onto Qin Yu’s back!

The force was extremely strong and Qin Yu’s body was dripping with blood. He fell to the ground!

“Hurry up and leave...” Yan Ruoxue’s eyes revealed a trace of heartache.

Qin Yu struggled to stand up from the ground. He wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth, shook his head, and said, “I don’t want to leave... I want to save you...”

“It’s useless. Hurry up and leave...” Yan Ruoxue was a little anxious.

But if one saw one’s beloved locked in prison, who would be willing to leave?

Moreover, to Qin Yu, everything he did was for Yan Ruoxue!

“Boom!”

That ray of light spread out again. This time, it was even more powerful and it knocked Qin Yu to the ground.

His body was riddled with wounds, and his internal organs seemed to have received an impact.

Even though Qin Yu’s physical body was indestructible, this ray of light was an unknown magical artifact that shattered Qin Yu’s defense.

Qin Yu climbed up from the ground again. He opened his mouth, and just as he was about to speak, that ray of light shot out again!

“Go to h*ll!” Qin Yu roared angrily, and clenched his fist to meet it!

“Boom!”

The two fists collided and created a huge explosion! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, the force was too great. Qin Yu’s body immediately smashed onto the iron cage!

“Hurry up...” Yan Ruoxue became more and more anxious.

“Rumble...”

At this moment, a series of explosions came from afar. The iron gate of the prison seemed to be slowly closing!

“Qin Yu, leave quickly!” Yan Ruoxue seemed to have used up all her strength to say this.

“You are the only one I have now. You can’t die, and you can’t be locked in...”

“Qin Yu, as long as you are still outside, I have the hope of being rescued. If you are also locked up here, then I have no hope at all...”

When he heard Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu’s expression became even uglier.

Yan Ruoxue was right. If he was locked up here, then there was no hope at all!

The door was still slowly closing, and the gap was getting smaller and smaller!

“Hurry up and leave...” Yan Ruoxue’s voice had some pleading in it.

Qin Yu glanced at the iron door, then at Yan Ruoxue.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Ruoxue, I will rescue you very soon. Wait for me!”

After saying that, Qin Yu immediately rushed towards the door!

The gap in the door became smaller and smaller. It looked like there was only room for one person left!

Qin Yu used all the strength in his body. The Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique was used to the maximum!

“Boom!”

Finally, Qin Yu tightly brushed against the door of the prison and escaped.

The door closed with a bam.

In the prison, Yan Ruoxue finally heaved a sigh of relief. A relieved smile appeared on her face.

Qin Yu stood there without leaving for a long time.

His eyes were fixed on the door, and he clenched his fists.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association... I must kill all of you!” Qin Yu gnashed his teeth.

“I will make all of you suffer Ruoxue’s current pain a thousand times or a hundred times over!”

Although Qin Yu was unwilling, he couldn’t stay for long.

He had to leave this place and think of a way to save Yan Ruoxue!

A golden light flashed, and Qin Yu escaped from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association at an extremely fast speed.

Not long after he left, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s reinforcements arrived at the scene.

Not only that, but Xia Hang even informed the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s higher-ups!

“He actually escaped,” a tall man said coldly.

This person’s name was Yan Guiyi, and he was a Martial Marquis of the sixth level! He held an important position in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Most importantly, he had several top-tier magical artifacts on him!
