Chapter 1134: Chapter 1,134, painstaking efforts 

Hearing the higher-ups’words, Qin Yu almost couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

These idiots actually thought of Qin Yu as their patriarch!

“That’s right, I am your patriarch. Quickly kneel down!”Qin Yu continued to shout loudly.

“You Bastards, do you know how big of a sin you have committed? !”

The higher-ups on the other end said, “It’s really the elder ancestor! Listen to this voice, is it coming from all directions? Besides the elder ancestor, who else has such ability?”

“That’s right, even we might not be able to do such a spell!”

“May I ask what instructions the Elder ancestor has? Please grant us new resources!”

Qin Yu laughed so hard that he fell over. He held his stomach and forced himself to laugh, “You bastards, you have committed such a big mistake, and you still dare to ask for new resources?”

“May I ask what mistake did we commit? Please enlighten us!”A higher-up exclaimed.

Qin Yu coldly berated, “You still dare to ask me? You forcefully broke the seal and threatened to kill Qin Yu. Do you know who that Qin Yu Is?”

The higher-ups on the other end were stunned for a moment before saying, “We know that Qin Yu is the son of the Dao Protector, but... he insulted me too much! Moreover... This Dao Protector can not act on Qin Yu’s behalf!”

“That’s right, this Qin Yu has extraordinary talent. We have already fallen into a deep hatred. If we don’t kill him, he will definitely kill us in the future. Patriarch, please understand!”

Qin Yu coughed and berated, “Bastard! I’m not talking about his level of identity!”

“Then... What kind of identity is that? Patriarch, please speak Frankly!”A higher-up shouted.

“He, Qin Yu, is your... biological father!”

After saying this, Qin Yu finally couldn’t hold it in anymore and burst into laughter.

The higher-up on the other end was instantly stunned.

They were stunned for not only half a second, but also reacted.

“No, this person called US Old Beasts! He is definitely not some ancestor!”

“This voice seems to be coming from the seal! Could it be the voice of the second secret realm!”

“It’s that Qin Yu! I’ve heard his voice before!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Only now did you react? Come, quickly call me father!”

The higher-ups on the other end said in a deep voice, “Little Bastard, you dare to play us!”

“Why wouldn’t I Dare?”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

“A bunch of idiots. With Your IQ, you still claim to be some higher-ups? Bullsh * T!”

The higher-ups on the other end gritted their teeth in anger, smoke coming out of their seven orifices.

“Little Bastard, just you wait, I’ll see how long you can be arrogant!”

“When we break this seal, I’ll definitely break your mouth! I’ll make you kneel down and beg for mercy!”

Qin Yu said sarcastically, “You treat your own father like this? You’re really too much!”

“Just you wait. When we step into the second mystic realm, we’ll definitely kill you!”The higher-ups on the other side were on the verge of breaking down as they shouted.

After that, a series of curses came out from the passage.

Qin Yu was too lazy to waste time with them. He took advantage of them and left.

Just as he walked out of the first mystic realm, he bumped into Zhai Xing and pavilion master.

“You came out of seclusion?”Seeing Qin Yu, Zhai Xing appeared to be quite surprised.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I just came out of seclusion.”

Then, Qin Yu looked at pavilion master and said, “Pavilion Master, why are you here?”

Pavilion master looked at Zhai Xing and wanted to say something, but he stopped.

Zhai xing coughed and said, “Qin Yu, I found her. After a few days of speculation, we found a place with good feng shui. I’m afraid there are top-tier spiritual artifacts there.”

“Top-tier spiritual artifacts?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

For cultivators, besides their own strength, spiritual artifacts were also very important.

If they could really obtain a top-tier spiritual artifact, it wouldn’t be a problem for them to cross ranks and fight.

Many spiritual artifacts could even develop their own consciousness, and their own strength was even stronger than their master’s!

“That’s right.”Zhai Xing nodded.

“As long as you go to this place and obtain this spiritual artifact, these eight high-level officials aren’t worth mentioning.”

With that, Zhai Xing took out a map and handed it to Qin Yu.

The location was already marked on the map. This was an extremely remote country. Qin Yu had never even heard of it.

“This is the place,”Zhai Xing said.

“Don’t waste time. Let’s go now. Remember, no matter what, you must get this magic artifact. Don’t let it fall into the hands of others!”

Zhai Xing said it as if it was true, and there was a hint of panic in his eyes.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. He took the map and said in a low voice, “This... time seems to be running out.”

“There’s time, there’s definitely time!”Zhai Xing said.

“I’ve already arranged a private plane for you. Don’t worry.”

With Zhai Xing’s ability, it wasn’t difficult to arrange a private plane.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it.

He picked up the map and nodded, “Okay, master Zhai Xing, thank you.”

“Let’s go quickly. Time is of the essence,”Zhai Xing urged.

With that, a car drove over not far away.

Zhai Xing seemed to have arranged everything. Qin Yu did not need to worry at all.

“Thank you,”Qin Yu thanked him again.

“Hurry up and get in the car.”Zhai Xing personally opened the car door for Qin Yu.

After Qin Yu got in the car, he pulled down the window and said, “I’ll be back as soon as possible.”

“Okay.”Zhai Xing hurriedly nodded.

The car quickly left and headed straight for the airport.

After the car was far away, Zhai Xing sighed slightly.

“This is the only way,”Zhai Xing said in a low voice.

Pavilion master frowned and said, “Are you sure that it’s safe there?”

“It’s safe,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“It’s a very unique country. It’s almost completely closed off, and the news is also extremely blocked.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“In the world, no one has even noticed their existence.”

Pavilion master pulled back the hair on his forehead and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, I hope you can understand our painstaking efforts...”
