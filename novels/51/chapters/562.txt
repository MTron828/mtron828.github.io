Chapter 563: Gu Canghai’s Death! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Gu Canghai told Yan Sihai with a trembling voice.

Yan Sihai was stunned for a moment after hearing it, and then he said angrily, “What did you say?! Qin Yu has become a Martial Marquis?”

“Yes... yes...” Gu Canghai braced himself and said.

Yan Sihai gritted his teeth and said, “Trash, you trash!”

“Gu Canghai, the Yan family has spent so many resources on you all these years, yet you can’t even handle such a small matter!”

In the face of Yan Sihai’s criticism, Gu Canghai didn’t dare to say a word.

“What’s the use of having a trash like you?!” Yan Sihai almost smashed his phone.

He didn’t expect that Qin Yu would actually step into the Martial Marquis Realm in such a short period of time!

“President Yan, we had already succeeded, but Yan Jiang appeared again!” Gu Canghai explained.

“If it weren’t for Yan Jiang, Qin Yu would be a corpse now!”

“Yan Jiang?” Yan Sihai frowned slightly.

It had been too long. He had almost forgotten about Yan Jiang.

“President Yan, you have to think of a way. Otherwise, Qin Yu will never forgive me...” Gu Canghai started to be afraid. The only person he could ask for help now was Yan Sihai.

Yan Sihai sneered, “Useless thing. I should think of a way? Think of a way for you? I should send someone to protect you?”

“You’re a mighty Martial Marquis, yet you still need someone to protect you? Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at if this gets out?”

Gu Canghai said somewhat anxiously, “President Yan, you’ve seen the fight between Qin Yu and Han Wei. Once he steps into the Martial Marquis Realm, even Young Master Han wouldn’t be able to retaliate, let alone me...”

On the other end, how could Yan Sihai listen to this? He sneered and said, “Think of a way yourself. Whether you live or die, you deserve it.”

After saying this, Yan Sihai hung up the phone.

This time, Gu Canghai completely panicked.

If the Yan family didn’t help, then he had no power to go against Qin Yu!

After thinking for a while, Gu Canghai quickly got up.

He called Deng Sheng in and said coldly, “Immediately pass the message that the Saint Confucian Sect will be closed from today onwards! No one is allowed to enter or leave!”

Deng Sheng naturally knew what had happened. He nodded and said, “Okay, I understand.”

After walking out of the main hall, Deng Sheng couldn’t help but sneer.

“It seems that Gu Canghai is really afraid. Perhaps I can really get the position of the Saint Confucian Sect’s Sect Master.” The corners of Deng Sheng’s mouth couldn’t help but curl up into a proud smile.

After Deng Sheng left, Gu Canghai couldn’t wait to leave the hall.

He paced back and forth and finally made up his mind.

He should leave Saint Confucian Sect for the time being and find a place to hide!

Otherwise, he would definitely be killed by Qin Yu!

Thinking of this, Gu Canghai immediately left Saint Confucian Sect.

...

The Green Moon Villa was peaceful.

The mountain gate was destroyed, so it needed to be rebuilt.

Fortunately, Zhen Yue didn’t lack money. Besides being a martial artist, she also ran many businesses.

At night, Qin Yu and Zhen Yue buried all the members of the Green Moon Villa who had died in battle and set up gravestones for them.

“Mr. Qin, perhaps you are more suitable for the position of the Sect Master,” Zhen Yue, who was standing beside Qin Yu, suddenly said.

Qin Yu glanced at Zhen Yue and shook his head. “I promised you that I would let you be the Sect Master, so I won’t go back on my words.”

“Besides, I’m not interested in the sect at all.”

Zhen Yue bit her lips and didn’t know what to say for a moment.

“I’ll leave the reconstruction of the sect to you,” Qin Yu said.

Zhen Yue nodded and then asked, “What are your plans?”

Qin Yu said, “I’m going out tomorrow.”

“Where?” Zhen Yue asked.

“To kill people.”

...

The next day, Qin Yu carried the unconscious Yan Jiang and left the Green Moon Villa.

Although the Green Moon Villa was developing well, not many people dared to enter because of the Saint Confucian Sect.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry. He knew very well that the most important thing now was to establish his authority.

Of course, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to go to the Saint Confucian Sect. Instead, he brought Yan Jiang to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Yan Jiang had helped Qin Yu many times. This time, he had helped him greatly.

If it weren’t for Yan Jiang, Qin Yu probably would have died.

In the Pavilion Master’s building, Qin Yu placed Yan Jiang on an empty space at the side.

The Pavilion Master drank a mouthful of tea. She glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “You’ve stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I just made a breakthrough yesterday.”

The Pavilion Master put down the water in her hand and said with a smile, “Old Mister Jiang was right.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Pavilion Master, thank you for your help during this period of time. I might have to trouble you again.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the unconscious Yan Jiang.

The Pavilion Master nodded and said, “What are your next plans?”

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold as he said, “I’ll go kill everyone in the Saint Confucian Sect first. Next, I’ll go straight to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“No matter what, I’ll take Ruoxue away!”

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment and said, “Qin Yu, don’t underestimate the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. They...”

“I know,” Qin Yu interrupted the Pavilion Master.

“Although I have become a Martial Marquis Realm, I also know that there are people beyond that level, not to mention in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“As for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, I know nothing but legends about them. I also want to personally see how powerful they are.”

The Pavilion Master frowned and said, “Aren’t you afraid that you won’t be able to leave if you go?”

“I’m not afraid,” said Qin Yu in a deep voice.

“Even if I can’t do anything to them, I still have a way to escape.”

The Pavilion Master knew that Qin Yu had made up his mind to leave, so she didn’t say anything more.

“Then I wish you all the best,” said the Pavilion Master.

Qin Yu bowed slightly and said, “Thank you for your kind words.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After putting down Yan Jiang, Qin Yu left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

His next trip was to the Saint Confucian Sect!

Qin Yu, who had just stepped into the Martial Marquis realm, didn’t know how powerful he was. Gu Canghai was the right person to practice with.

Moreover, Gu Canghai had given Qin Yu a lot of trouble. He had no choice but to take revenge.

On this afternoon, it was sunny, and the Saint Confucian Sect appeared somewhat peaceful.

A figure suddenly appeared outside the mountain gate.

The gate of the Saint Confucian Sect had long since been sealed.

A young man took a deep breath and roared, “Gu Canghai, come out and die!”

With just a roar, the mountain gate was shattered!

A terrifying internal qi penetrated deep into the Saint Confucian Sect!

For a moment, the entire Saint Confucian Sect buzzed!

“Oh no, Qin Yu is here!” Someone cried out in alarm.

“Quick... go summon the Sect Master!”

Everyone immediately panicked. They all hid in the main hall in fear.

Qin Yu walked towards the Saint Confucian Sect step by step. Along the way, no one dared to stop him.

“Gu Canghai, come out and face your death!” Another shout sounded!

This time, the plaque hanging on the main hall was shattered!
