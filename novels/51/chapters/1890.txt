1891 Seeing the Man with the Mustache Again

They could destroy a star with a raise of their hands, and even if they wanted to eradicate the Holy region, it would only take a short while.

“Let’s go and take a look,” Qin Yu said to Chang Mang.

The two didn’t waste time and quickly left their accommodation and rushed toward the sanctum.

Along the way, many people rushed to the sanctum, and they could see the sky blotted and the sun blocked when they looked up. It was like a large swarm of locusts flocking over.

Eight hundred stars weren’t far, so Qin Yu and Chang Mang only took a few short days to reach the place.

Although it was not a wasteland, it was by no means an oasis. There was nothing else other than a few trees.

However, there was an extremely powerful aura around this place. Those who were slightly weaker couldn’t take even half a step closer. Even existences like Qin Yu and Chang Mang could feel incredibly powerful pressure.

At a glance, there were dozens of dao flags in the center. They seemed to be temples, and there were many altars around them.

However, Qin Yu could not see through it thoroughly because the sanctum was covered by a thick fog.

“This sanctum doesn’t seem to have been completely born yet,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Chang Mang couldn’t see through the thick fog, so he said in a deep voice, “With our strength, I’m afraid it won’t be easy to enter this sanctum.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. Even the Big Grave of a True Saint had almost killed him, let alone the sanctum of a great cultivator at the Tribulation Stage.

Of course, at that time, Qin Yu’s strength was somewhat weak. If he were to step into a True Saint’s Big Grave again, it shouldn’t be so difficult now.

“If I could return to Earth, I’ll definitely go and take a look at the True Saint’s Big Grave again,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

There was a large crowd in the surroundings, but they didn’t get close to the sanctum. They only watched from a distance.

The real big shots had yet to show up, and they also had no chance to get involved.

Of course, Qin Yu and Chang Mang also did not dare to get close. They hid among the crowd, planning to get a share of the loot.

Chang Mang tried to approach the sanctum, but his body felt intense discomfort as he got close.

“No, I can’t do it.” Chang Mang frowned.

“We can’t get close to this sanctum at all. It is already so terrifying even before it’s completely revealed. If it’s completely revealed, we’ll definitely die the moment we get close,” Chang Mang said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu felt the same. “If that’s the case, how did the saintess of the Gu family get close to this sanctum?” He said in a deep voice.

“The elders of the family must be accompanying her,” Chang Mang said.

Although the Gu family’s saintess was very powerful, she had not entered the True Saint realm yet. The difference in strength between her and Qin Yu would not be too big.

“She may also be using some sort of secret treasure,” Qin Yu said.

No elders accompanied her when he saw the saintess of the Gu family yesterday. She was alone.

“Probably, as secret treasure is nothing to their families,” Chang Mang said.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “I suspect there’s something wrong with this sanctum. Otherwise, the sanctum of a great cultivator at the Tribulation Stage would have attracted the elders of the nine great aristocratic families. They wouldn’t just let the younger generation come.”

Chang Mang also felt Qin Yu’s analysis made sense.

A part of the sanctum had been revealed. If it was a complete sanctum of the Tribulation Stage great cultivator, the people of the nine great aristocratic families would have been surrounding it.

“Maybe there’s someone who can help us.” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He released his divine sense covering a radius of nearly a hundred li.

Soon, Qin Yu noticed several incredibly powerful existences in the crowd. There were even a few that he could not see through.

“Is there a Semi-Saint here?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was very likely that some Semi-Saint rogue cultivators were here to seek fortuitous opportunities.

After all, in this era, they had the capabilities to turn things around and would definitely be reluctant to feel contented with their current situations.

“I found it!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes lit up, and he sneered and said, “I knew this b*stard would definitely come.”

“Who is it?” Chang Mang was puzzled and asked.

“Man with the mustache,” Qin Yu said.

As long as a treasure surfaced, this d*mned thing would definitely show up without exception!

“That wretched guy?” Chang Mang muttered.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. Without any delay, he immediately took Chang Mang and walked in the direction of the man with the mustache.

In the crowd, the man with the mustache was looking around sneakily.

He had deliberately disguised himself and even used a secret technique to cover his face.

However, he couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s eyes. Qin Yu quickly walked in the direction of the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache seemed to have noticed Qin Yu. His body tensed up slightly, and he turned around to run.

“Don’t go!” Qin Yu immediately stepped the line word formula and shot toward the man with the mustache!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu blocked the man with the mustache’s way.

Seeing that he couldn’t escape, the man with the mustache cupped his hands and said, “My friend, are you calling me?”

“Stop pretending, man with the mustache,” Qin Yu glared at him.

The man with the mustache coughed and said, “I don’t seem to understand what you’re saying. I have a mustache, but you can’t discriminate against me because of it…”

“Man with the mustache, don’t be pretentious!” Qin Yu said with his eyes wide open.

“I really don’t understand. I’m afraid you’ve mistaken me for someone else. I have something to do, so I’ll make a move first!” The man with the mustache turned around and wanted to run away.

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and grabbed the man with the mustache. He sneered and said, “If you continue to play tricks on me, I’ll send you to the Gu family.”

...

Hearing this, the man with the mustache’s face instantly changed. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He glared at Qin Yu and said, “Little b*stard! What do you want? My disguise was flawless. How did you see through it?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “That’s enough. Don’t talk nonsense with me. What’s in that sanctum?”

“How would I know?” the man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Is there anything that you don’t know?” Don’t talk nonsense. Quickly tell me the truth.”

The man with the mustache sighed and muttered, “I really f*cking indebted to you. How did I get to know a god of the plaque like you…”

Qin Yu didn’t waste time talking nonsense to him. He pulled the man with the mustache and walked to a place where no one was around, and sat down.

“Tell me,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “What? You want a share of the loot, do you? Let me tell you, you don’t have that kind of strength. It’s a sanctum of the Tribulation Stage great cultivator. A wisp of the internal qi can kill you!”

“Don’t I have you?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

The man with the mustache hid to the side as if he was hiding from the god of the plague. He waved his hands and said, “I don’t have that ability. I’m just here to take a look.”

...

“Stop pretending,” Qin Yu frowned and said. He seemed to have lost her patience.

The man with the mustache knew he couldn’t fool him. Thus he could only sigh slightly and tell the truth.
