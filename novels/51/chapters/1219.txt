Chapter 1220: Chapter 1,220 was once again injected with the strengthening agent! 

This punch contained a force of a thond catties as it mercilessly smashed towards the sea chicken!

And at this moment, the sea chicken’s two palms rapidly reformed, once again covering its body to resist Qin Ypunch.

“Clang!”

In an instant, sparks flew in all directions. The sea chicken’s feathers were like steel protecting its body, but a few were still shattered by that punch!

Its huge body even took a few steps back in the sea.

The feathers that had already been shattered pierced into its empty body, causing blood to gush out.

“It’s this blood!”Professor Chicken immediately shouted excitedly.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu beckoned to the sea chicken, “Come, continue!”

However, at this moment, the sea chicken was already starting to be afraid. There was no longer any killing intent in its eyes. Instead, it revealed traces of fear.

Without a complete divine sense, everything it did was instinctive.

At this moment, its huge body was trembling in the water like a frightened puppy.

Looking at its trembling state, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be moved. For a moment, he couldn’t even bear to do it.

“Why? Are You Afraid?”Qin Yu asked.

The sea chicken’s huge body didn’t say a word. It was extremely docile.

For a moment, Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He never thought that this huge and powerful sea chicken would be as harmless as a docile little animal at this moment.

Qin Yu laughed bitterly. He pointed at the sea chicken’s wound and said, “I’ll get some blood from you and then let you go. Is that okay?”

The sea chicken’s divine sense seemed to be very low. It couldn’t understand Qin Ywords at all.

“Get me a few porcelain jars,”qin youted at Professor Chicken.

Professor Chicken naturally didn’t dare to waste any time. He hurriedly ran back to the laboratory with his men and took out a few huge porcelain jars.

Qin Yu turned around and took the porcelain jar in his hand. Then, he walked towards the sea chicken’s wound.

He followed the fresh blood from the wound and collected it with the porcelain jar.

However, the sea chicken, which had an extremely low divine sense, did not understand what Qin Yu was doing.

The frightened sea chicken immediately became irritable, and its body swayed.

“Don’t move!”

Qin Youted, then raised his hand and grabbed the sea chicken’s arm.

The sea chicken still wanted to struggle, but to its surprise, it could not move at all under Qin Ytremendous strength!

This made the already terrified sea chicken even more disheartened!

It understood that the power contained in this tiny human in front of it was not something it could withstand!

This also made the sea chicken slowly calm down. It stood motionless in the sea, afraid of angering this human.

Qin Yu filled the few large porcelain jars with fresh blood. Then, he looked at professor chicken and shouted, “Is it enough?”

Professor chicken nodded repeatedly and said, “It’s enough, it’s enough.”

Only then did Qin Yop. He patted the huge head of the sea chicken and said, “Alright, let’s go. You have to treat the wound yolf.”

The sea chicken stood motionless in the sea water like a statue.

Qin Yew that it didn’t understand his words, so he ignored it and turned around to return to the island.

“I’ll leave the blood to you,”Qin Yid.

Professor Chicken took the blood and gave Qin Yu a thumbs up. “I didn’t expect this beast to be so obedient.”

Qin Yiled bitterly. “Everything it does is instinctive. It will naturally be attracted to Qiang.”

“Okay, let’s not disturb it. Let it go back,”Qin Yid with a wave of his hand.

Professor chicken was dancing with excitement. How could he care about this sea chicken? He immediately got someone to bring the jar full of blood back to the laboratory.

Qin Yu did not stay ode and followed him back to the laboratory.

It was not until ten minutes after Qin Yu returned to the laboratory that the sea chicken rushed into the sea and disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu leaned against the window and saw everything clearly.

He could not help but lower his head to look at his hands and said in a low voice, “The strength of this body... is really powerful.”

This made Qin Yu begin to have some longing, longing for the strength after recovering his spiritual power.

Professor Chicken worked through the night to develop the strengthening agent.

Fortunately, they had already had experience, so this strengthening agent did not need too much time. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The next morning, after Qin Yu woke up, he went to the laboratory.

Professor Chicken, who was almost sixty years old, did not sleep for a night, but he did not feel sleepy at all. Instead, he was extremely excited.

“How is it?”Qin Yu asked.

Professor Chicken pointed to the side and said, “There are already thirty bottles.”

“How many bottles of blood can be developed?”Qin Yu asked.

Professor chicken rubbed his eyes and said, “Roughly, there are about a hundred bottles.”

Then, he grabbed a bottle of strengthening agent and handed it to a professor beside him.

“Come, give me a shot!”Professor Chicken said excitedly.

Qin Yexpression changed and he hurriedly said, “Professor Chicken, your body can’t withstand this strengthening agent.”

Professor chicken waved his hand: “This bottle has been diluted a hundred times, it should not be a problem.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu did not stop him.

He looked at the 30 bottles of strengthening agent, and said: “Inject these into my body temporarily, as for the others, they can wait here for a while longer.”

Because of the formation flag, Qin Yu could not stay any longer.

Therefore, he had to inject the strengthening agent into the saturated state as soon as possible.

Professor chicken nodded and said, “Of co, no problem.”

Then, professor chicken lay on the bed, and the diluted bottle of strengthening agent was injected into his body.

After being diluted a hundred times, an ordinary person could indeed endure it.

He said excitedly, “Great, it’s a success!”

At that moment, doctor chicken seemed to have become tens of years younger.

“Qin Yu, come, I will inject you with an enhancer now. I want to see how many bottles you can endure.”Doctor Chicken jumped up from the bed.

Qin Yu did not waste any time and immediately laid down on the bed.
