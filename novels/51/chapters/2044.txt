Chapter 2045: Fighting Si Liuhe

Who was Si Liuhe? He was an existence that swept across all directions and was famous throughout the Holy Region!

No one doubted his strength. Not many people in the Holy Region were his match. Xiao Hai was just a junior, yet he wanted to defeat him with his bare hands!

What was even scarier was Xiao Hai had seen through Si Liuhe’s palm technique with just a glance!

What was it called? It was called a martial arts genius!

“Just a glance… and he has learned it?” Someone at the scene swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and the shock on his face could not be concealed.

“Who… Who would dare to fight him in the future? Doesn’t that mean he’ll learn all the techniques?”

Not only others but Qin Yu was also tremendously shocked!

Of course, he knew the terrifying talent of the two Xiao brothers, but he did not expect Xiao Hai to comprehend the Si family’s technique so easily!

Qin Yu could not help but recall the scene in North Plain back then.

At that time, Xiao Hai had only stepped into North Plain, but he had quickly comprehended the dao techniques of the North Plain.

Everyone would be shocked by such terrifying talent!

“What a terrifying talent!” Saintess Gu spoke first.

Yao Xi also frowned and said in a low voice, “In the Golden Age, there will always be a few unexpected freaks.”

Si Liuhe was silent. Looking in Xiao Hails direction, he was thinking about something.

“This era… is indeed interesting. I’m afraid the younger generation will be incredibly outstanding,” Yan Guyun said with a vague smile.

Si Liuhe spoke at this moment.

He looked in Xiao Hails direction and said, “Xiao Hai, there’s no deep grudge between you and the Si family. As long as you are willing to join us, we can write off all your past grudges. What do you think?”

The crowd gasped again!

Si Liuhe… had actually put down his arrogant attitude and extended an olive branch to Xiao Hai!

It was simply unprecedented!

Si Liuhe knew very well that Qin Yu had a lot of freaks around him.

Although these people were still not strong enough, they would definitely form an incredibly terrifying force in time!

This force was enough to shake the current structure of the Holy Region! It would affect the nine great aristocratic families!

Everyone was waiting for Xiao Hail s response. In their opinion, this seemed to be the best choice.

“I know what you’re thinking.” Seeing Xiao Hai not responding, Si Liuhe continued, “If you are willing to join the Si family, I can let Qin Yu go today.”

Everyone was dumbfounded again.

For the sake of Xiao Hai, Ji Liuhe was even willing to let Qin Yu go!

This… This simply changed everyone’s worldview!

Unfortunately, Xiao Hai was a person who never bowed down. He laughed and said, “Thank you for your kindness, but I, Xiao Hai, am used to freedom. I don’t like to join any aristocratic families.”

Xiao Hai paused for a while before continuing, “Moreover, I don’t fit in with your Si family’s ideology and dao technique. I can never fit into your circle.”

Just as Xiao Hai had said, he was a man with a strong sense of justice. How would he be willing to join the Si family?

“This Xiao Hai really doesn’t know how to appreciate favors.”

“It’s Si Liuhe! Si Liuhe invited him personally, and he dared to reject him!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Does he think he’s some treasure? The Si family can destroy him any time.”

Si Liuhe’s face turned cold. He looked at Xiao Hai and said, “If you disagree, you’ll die here today. I definitely won’t let you make good.”

Xiao Hail s body trembled, and he said, “I, Xiao Hai, have always been righteous wherever I go. I have never thought about my ending. To die today means to end today. What is there to be afraid of?”

“Good!” Si Liuhe shouted. He was obviously enraged by Xiao Hai.

“I admit you have some talent, but your strength is not worth mentioning in front of me!”

Si Liuhe’s aura rose again after a shout!

Even though the people were far away, they could still feel Si Liuhe’s terrifying pressure!

Qin Yu was tremendously anxious. He quickly looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Do you have any Saint Weapon with you?”

The man with the mustache said with a cold expression, “Perhaps we don’t need a Saint Weapon anymore. ”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu frowned.

The man with the mustache took a deep breath and said, “Although I can’t predict how the Chaos Grave will spread, I’m sure it’s destructive.

“If they don’t remove this formation, everyone will die here together.”

“Is what you said just now true?” Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he asked.

The man with the mustache did not say anything else. He closed his eyes slightly, thinking about something.

At this moment, Si Liuhe started to make his move.

He casually raised his palm, and thousands of dao techniques instantly served him. His terrifying internal qi was like a huge mountain, pressing down on people until they could not breathe!

Even Xiao Hails expression turned grave facing this internal qi.

He didn’t have any fancy technique. He raised his hand and released dense spiritual energy, intending to fight Si Liuhe to death.

However, everyone knew Xiao Hai was only powerful among his peers. He could not resist Si Liuhe, a top-notch existence of the older generation!

Once Si Liuhe was serious, life and death would probably be decided in an instant!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and instantly activated his cosmic form, intending to fight Si Liuhe to the death!

...

Seeing Qin Yu, tens of feet tall, Si Liuhe narrowed his eyes.

“You have quite many techniques. Unfortunately, in the face of absolute strength, everything is not worth mentioning,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

Before he could finish his sentence, Si Liuhe’s huge hand had already slapped over!

In an instant, the huge hand covered the sky and earth, blotting out the sun and leaving people no place to hide!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He adjusted his internal qi to the extreme and received the attack with all his might!

Xiao Hai naturally wouldn’t just sit back and watch. His feet shook, and he also went up to receive it.

“Boom!”

The two internal qi collided violently. However, Qin Yu’s body was slammed back to its original form in less than half a second the two parties resisted.

Xiao Hai also could not withstand it any longer. He was soon slammed onto the ground, bleeding profusely!

It was Si Liuhe’s true strength! No one knew what cultivation realm he had stepped into, but he was enough to sweep through more than half of the Holy Region!

As the dust settled, Qin Yu and Xiao Hai lay on the ground, looking rather tragic.

...

Qin Yu stood up with difficulty. He looked at Xiao Hai and said, “Brother Xiao Hai, are you alright?”

Xiao Hai wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth and said, “I’m fine. It’s just that… I’m afraid we won’t be able to escape this calamity today.”

Qin Yu felt a little sad. He said guiltily, “Brother Xiao Hai, I’m sorry. I’ve troubled you.”

“Hahaha! It has nothing to do with you! I, Xiao Hai, am destined to die in battle. Come!” Xiao Hai shouted angrily, and several dragons vaguely coiled around his body..
