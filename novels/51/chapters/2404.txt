2405 Ambush

The acupoint located between the eyebrows was also filled with spiritual energy.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. When the Glazed Holy Body was first formed, the vitality gate acupoint on his spine had already contained a vast amount of spiritual energy. Subsequently, his holy body also slowly grew from the supply of the vitality gate acupoint.

This time, when he absorbed the chaotic qi to the utmost, an aperture actually opened in his glabella.

This aperture was like a vast ocean. When his divine sense probed inside, he seemed to have sensed a vast space world.

“Could it be that this is the special feature of the Glazed Holy Body? Or do all those who cultivate their bodies have this special way of enlightening?”

Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled and could not grasp the specifics either.

No wonder when it came to the Tribulation Transcending Stage, each cultivator’s different methods of practice would create significant disparities between them.

However, this should be a good thing. With the opening of the acupoint between his eyebrows, the chaotic qi in his body had increased by almost 50%. With the content of chaotic qi in the Glazed Holy Body, this amount was considered tremendously terrifying. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“F*ck, Qin Yu, are you okay?”

Chang Mang’s large face leaned over, and he carefully poked Qin Yu’s stomach for fear that Qin Yu’s body would explode.

“I’m fine. I didn’t expect the Immortal Emperor’s energy of dead bodies to have such high quality. I almost exploded.”

Initially, Qin Yu had wanted to see if he could absorb another wisp of the Immortal Emperor’s energy of dead bodies. However, after thinking about it, he felt it was too risky.

After cultivating his Glazed Holy Body, he had tempered it many times.

Especially after obtaining the Heart of Thunder, the Way of Thunder and Lightning had been tempering his body.

All of this might be the prerequisite for enlightenment. His body might explode if he were to do it again.

“Strange. Did you all notice that some people have been watching us not long after we came out of Peach Blossom Island? Their cultivations seem to be quite high. I can’t catch them.”

Jue Wu was puzzled and said.

“It must be those old brats from the nine great aristocratic families. They must have been thinking of revenge after we killed so many of their people this time.”

Chang Mang analyzed the situation and felt that these people were definitely up to something.

“Should we go back to Thunder Courtyard first and discuss with Flower Granny and Lei Xin before taking any specific action?” Elder Guai was more cautious and felt it inappropriate to go straight to Sky City.

“Don’t be afraid. I’m only afraid this bunch of good-for-nothings not showing up. They’re a bunch of animals.”

Chang Mang spat fiercely.

“Quite many cultivators from purgatory have come, especially those from the nine great aristocratic families. Many Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators have returned to their families. It’s only right to be more cautious.”

Ji Yue agreed with Elder Guai.

“It’s fine. I can now open a spatial passageway using the primordial rune. As long as it’s not Tribulation Third Level Soul Sinking, and I have the most profound the Way of Rules. Worst scenario, I can escape.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and decided to fulfill the prince’s wish.

This was his old friend’s wish before he died, so he had no reason not to help him fulfill it.

He put away the void warship. This warship was too big of a target and would easily attract attention.

The Sumeru ring turned into a speck of dust, disappeared into the void, and continued rushing.

At this time, Qin Yu did not want to use the Thunder and Lightning Escape Technique for the time being. That escape technique was faster, but the commotion it created was too big. It could easily attract people’s attention.

Qin Yu had the deepest comprehension of spatial rules. After all, his soul had submerged into the bottom of the sea of space. Although he only swam once, his speed was tremendously fast when he was rushing his way.

They were already close to Sky City in less than half a day.

In the blink of an eye, when the Sumeru ring entered the void again…

The endless darkness in front of him seemed to suddenly move slightly.

That feeling was very strange. If Qin Yu had not tightened his divine sense to detect the movements in the surroundings, he definitely could not have noticed this fluctuation.

A soundless saber qi instantly slashed at the Sumeru ring but passed through it.

It then exploded at the side. Qin Yu controlled the Sumeru ring again at the last moment and shuttled into the Holy Region to avoid this slash.

Waves of fluctuations came from the endless void. They seemed very close but yet very far away from them.

It was like a complex mountain range in the void, overlapping each other, and their positions constantly changed.

At this moment, Jue Wu seemed to have noticed something unusual.

“Black Saber!”

Qin Yu’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. It seemed to be a soundless ultimate slash.

All the force was contained in the saber qi, and that power was at least the power of tribulation.

If this strike struck the Sumeru ring and swept them into the depths of the void, he might not be able to return to the Holy Region even if he could evolve a passageway using the primordial rune.

Qin Yu was covered in cold sweat. What exactly was going on?

He traveled through the void and rushed his way using the Sumeru ring. Even if the person monitoring him was Dean Lei, Qin Yu felt he could not continue to lock onto him.

The assassin seemed to have been waiting there all along. The final slash was as if predetermined. It would have caused a big disaster if he had not reacted fast enough.

“Could it be a mighty realm cultivator specializing in cultivating the soul?”

Elder Guai asked with a frown.

“It looks like someone is unhappy about this trip to Sky City!”

The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth curled into a cold smile. There were countless opportunities along the way if he wanted to kill them.

But he only made his move at last when they almost reached Sky City.

He wanted to see why someone was unwilling to let him fulfill the prince’s last wish.

He stepped forward and sped up further to Sky City.

When they arrived above Sky City, Qin Yu felt a strange situation.

The street was bustling with people, and the sky was cloudless.

The children were making noise everywhere, and all of this revealed that everything was normal.

“Qin Yu, I don’t know why I feel very uncomfortable.”

Jue Wu came out of the Sumeru ring and scratched her head.

“I can’t describe that feeling either. It’s like smelling unpalatable meat. Anyway, I’m feeling uncomfortable.”

The desolate divine eye on Qin Yu’s forehead suddenly opened, but he did not notice anything unusual.

“Perhaps the killing intent here is too strong.”

Qin Yu frowned and rushed straight to the Imperial Palace.

At this moment, there was no more warm royal aura above the Imperial Palace.

In the entire Imperial Palace, apart from some stationed cultivators, there were no other signs of human presence.

“Freeze! This is the base of the nine great aristocratic families. Get lost immediately or go to hell!”

In an instant, four or five figures appeared before Qin Yu and the others. The person in the lead had a fierce expression on his face. Under the fluctuation of his internal qi, he was clearly at the Peak of True Saint.

“Why are the tones of people of the nine great aristocratic families all the same?”

Qin Yu felt puzzled. The person guarding the Imperial Palace was actually a Peak of True Saint.

It was a little strange. Those who could reach this stage were almost certain to be able to enter the Tribulation Transcending Stage, but they were stationed as guards. Moreover, from their looks, they were definitely not the ones in charge here.

There must be someone with a higher cultivation. Could it be that something was hidden in the Imperial Palace?
