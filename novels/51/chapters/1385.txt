“I could feel the strength of that sharp blade. With my cultivation level, I couldn’t withstand it at all, but you blocked it with your hand,”Ding Yi continued to ask.

“This doesn’t make sense at all. Moreover, there is no spiritual power fluctuation in your body.”

He turned to look at Ding Yi and said, “What exactly are you trying to say?”

Ding Yi was silent for a moment and said, “I’m just wondering if you’re...”

“I’m not. I’m nothing. I’m just born with divine power,”Qin Yu interrupted Ding Yi.

“Also, don’t make wild guesses. I’m just an ordinary person.”

Ding Yi, who was already a little skeptical, heard Qin Yu’s denial and became even more curious.

She scrutinized Qin Yu’s face carefully, as if she was trying to find a flaw.

This made Qin Yu a little worried, but fortunately, he was about to leave this place, so it was somewhat comforting.

When they returned to anfeng tower, the sky had already darkened.

When boss Zheng saw the two people who had returned, he did not say anything. He just nodded and left in a hurry.

“En? Boss Zheng seems a little strange today,”said Ding Yi.

Qin Yu didn’t think much about it. After all, she wasn’t very familiar with boss Zheng.

“Do you know Xiao Hai?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly looked at Ding Yi.

Ding Yi immediately said, “Of course I know him. He’s a famous hero in the South Prefecture.”

“Why don’t you like him, but you like that Qin Yu?”Qin Yu said with some puzzlement.

“Xiao Hai’s strength is even stronger, and he is extremely loyal. He seems to be more worthy of worship than that Qin Yu, right?”

Ding Yi rolled his eyes and said, “How do you know that I don’t like Xiao Hai? He is also my idol, but... he has been famous for too many years, and there is a sense of distance, and Qin Yu is like a person who lives by his side.”

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t continue asking.

The next day.

Qin Yu and Ding Yi continued to load the goods. At noon, the two of them were ready to set off for the Heavenly Cloud sect.

An Fenglou wasn’t far from the Heavenly Cloud sect, but it was still some distance away.

If you wanted to go to the Heavenly Cloud Sect, you had to pass through a small town.

Qin Yu and Ding Yi walked through the small town as usual. At this moment, the scene not far away made the two of them stop in their tracks at the same time.

They saw a young man wearing a heavenly cloud sect uniform punching and kicking an old man in shabby clothes. He was cursing non-stop.

“F * ck!”Ding Yi cursed. Then, he ran up and kicked the back of the young man with a bang.

This kick was extremely powerful. It sent the young man flying several meters and smashed the mountain into pieces before he could stabilize his body.

“Motherf * cker, you son of a B * Tch who bullies people!”Ding Yi gnashed his teeth and said.

Qin Yu, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but be a little surprised. She thought that Ding Yi would just say it, but she didn’t expect him to really attack.

The young man got up from the ground. He rubbed his back and shouted angrily, “Are you F * cking courting death? !”

Ding Yi said with a black face, “Son of a B * Tch, who the F * ck are you to hit people?”

“I’m willing to fight, what do you care? I’m from the Heavenly Cloud Sect, how dare you meddle in other people’s Business?”The young man said angrily.

As he spoke, the young man walked towards Ding Yi, his palm suddenly reaching out towards Ding Yi.

This young man was from the Heavenly Cloud sect after all, so his strength was naturally not to be underestimated.

And Ding Yi was only an itinerant cultivator, and his talent was quite ordinary. How could he be a match for this young man.

In just a few exchanges, Ding Yi was beaten back repeatedly.

“Since you dare to attack a member of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, you must be prepared to die.”The young man walked towards Ding Yi step by step.

His palm flickered with light, and a terrifying aura was brewing.

“Go to hell!”

He suddenly raised his hand and fiercely slapped Ding Yi’s head!

At this moment, a fist that flickered with a faint golden light burst out from not far away!

Before the young man could react, Qin Yu’s fist had already closed in on him.

“Kacha!”

In just an instant, his head exploded!

Ding Yi, who was standing by the side, could not help but turn pale. It was as if she had never seen someone kill with her own eyes!

“You... you killed him?”Ding Yi swallowed his saliva and said with some fear.

Qin Yu glanced at Ding Yi and said, “He is a member of the Heavenly Cloud Sect. If you don’t kill him, you will be the one who dies. You should have thought of this before you made your move.”

Then, Qin Yu directly put the corpse into the spatial artifact.

The next second, Qin Yu’s gaze fell on the old man.

Feeling Qin Yu’s cold gaze, the old man’s expression immediately changed.

Ding Yi seemed to have realized Qin Yu’s intentions. She said somewhat nervously, “You... What are you doing?”

Qin Yu looked at the old man coldly and said, “He saw everything. Aren’t you afraid that he will tell the Heavenly Cloud sect about this?”

“No... impossible, absolutely impossible!”Ding Yi hurriedly said.

“You saved him. How could he report us?”

The old man also hurriedly said, “Don’t kill me, don’t kill me. I... I didn’t see anything...”
