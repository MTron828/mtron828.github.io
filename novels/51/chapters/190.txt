Chapter 191: Jiang Gu’s Fury Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The news of Jiang Gu’s exit from seclusion quickly spread throughout Chuzhou!

Almost all the aristocratic families knew about this news!

A lot of people became panicked by this news. Those who had a grudge against the Jiang family even fled away from Chuzhou!

And there were also people secretly watching the show.

“Jiang Gu has stopped his seclusion. It’s said that he has already stepped into the Great Grandmaster Realm!”

“Tsk tsk, Qin Yu is in trouble this time!”

“I have to say, Qin Yu picked a perfect timing to run away!”

Following that, the top families of Chuzhou all brought gifts to the Jiang family to congratulate Jiang Gu!

In Chuzhou, other than the Jiang family, there were also a few martial arts aristocratic families.

Although they were not as good as the Jiang family, they were also top-notch in Chuzhou.

Originally, if these families joined forces, they could still fight against the Jiang family.

Now that Jiang Gu had stepped into the Great Grandmaster Realm, they had completely lost hope.

Everyone was willing to bow down to him.

“Congratulations on stepping into the Great Grandmaster Realm, Lord Jiang!” The head of the Sha family in Chuzhou bowed with a respectful expression.

“It’s our fortune to have Lord Jiang in Chuzhou!” The Li family brought their whole family to pay their respects.

“Lord Jiang is the role model of our generation. We are willing to stand up for the Jiang family!”

Looking at these families that had been against him secretly, but now bowed to him, a faint smile couldn’t help but appear on Jiang Gu’s face.

“Thank you all for taking care of me during these three years of seclusion,” Jiang Gu said faintly.

“Now that I have broken through to the Great Grandmaster Realm, I will pardon the world today.”

“All the grudges from the past will be written off from today onwards.”

After hearing Jiang Gu’s words, everyone heaved a sigh of relief secretly.

“Lord Jiang is indeed the number one person in Chuzhou. He’s way more forgiving than all of us!” Everyone applauded in unison. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

At this moment, Jiang Gu changed the topic.

He looked coldly at everyone and said in an icy tone, “I can let go of all the grudges from the past, but the person who injured my son... must die!”

As soon as he said that, everyone’s body suddenly trembled!

Everyone present was terrified by Jiang Gu’s killing intent!

“We are willing to give you a hand!” Someone hurriedly shouted.

Then, the others also shouted in unison!

On this day, all the families in Chuzhou seemed to have been unified!

In the military district, Uncle Wu’s face was somewhat gloomy.

“Jiang Gu has come out of seclusion,” Uncle Wu said in a deep voice.

Officer Guo frowned and said, “Fortunately, Qin Yu ran in time. Otherwise... it would have been troublesome.”

Uncle Wu nodded slightly and said, “Yes, if he had stayed a bit longer, I’m afraid he wouldn’t have been able to leave.”

“I heard that Jiang Gu has already spread the word that if he can’t find Qin Yu, he will attack the people around him,” officer Guo said with a frown.

Uncle Wu was silent.

He didn’t have any good ideas about this.

...

House Wei.

Wei Tao was a little worried.

The news of Jiang Gu’s exit from seclusion had already spread throughout Chuzhou. Jiang Gu had been talking about revenge constantly.

This was definitely not good news for Wei Tao.

“We have already drawn a clear line between us and Qin Yu. I believe that Jiang Gu won’t do anything to us,” Wei Tao comforted himself in his head.

At this moment.

A figure suddenly flashed past outside.

Wei Tao, who was already on tenterhooks, suddenly tensed up!

“Who is it?!” Wei Tao hurriedly ran to the door and shouted.

However, there was no one at the door.

Wei Tao wiped the sweat from his forehead and frowned. “Could it be that my eyes are playing tricks on me? It seems that I am a little too nervous.”

However, just as Wei Tao turned around, he saw Jiang Gu sitting on the sofa and quietly drinking tea.

Wei Tao’s expression suddenly changed!

He took a deep breath and suppressed the fear in his heart. He said politely, “Lord Jiang, why are you here?”

Jiang Gu glanced at Wei Tao and said indifferently, “Can’t I come?”

Wei Tao hurriedly shook his head and said, “I... I didn’t mean that. You can come to my humble house. My humble house is honored by your presence...”

Jiang Gu took a sip of tea. He looked at Wei Tao and said indifferently, “I heard that you have a good relationship with Qin Yu?”

What he was afraid of came true!

Wei Tao’s body went limp and he almost fell to the ground!

“L-Lord Jiang, these are all rumors. We, the Wei family, have nothing to do with Qin Yu...” Wei Tao hurriedly said.

“Is that so? I heard that your son has a good relationship with Qin Yu,” Jiang Gu said with a faint smile.

Wei Tao’s expression was extremely ashen. He anxiously said, “Lord Jiang, these are all rumors. There must be a villain who wants to frame me!”

“Rumors? “Lord Jiang narrowed his eyes.

He suddenly raised his palm, and a large hand appeared out of thin air and directly grabbed Wei Tao’s neck!

“Hand over your son,” Jiang Gu said indifferently.

Wei Tao was in extreme pain. He said with difficulty, “Lord Jiang... it has nothing to do with my son...”

“Huh?” Jiang Gu narrowed his eyes. “Do you think I won’t be able to find him if you don’t tell me?”

Wei Tao’s face instantly turned purple, as if he was going to be suffocated in the next second!

“Let go of my dad!” At this moment, Wei Ming suddenly rushed out!

He stared at Jiang Gu and gritted his teeth. “If you want to kill someone, come at me. It has nothing to do with my dad!”

Jiang Gu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “You’re Wei Ming? Where’s Qin Yu?”

“I don’t know.” Wei Ming took a deep breath.

“You don’t know?” Jiang Gu raised his eyebrows and increased the strength of his hand!

“Let go of my father!” Wei Ming was suddenly furious. He activated his inner strength and dashed towards Jiang Gu!

“What a clown.” Jiang Gu snorted. He raised his finger lightly and a ray of light instantly sent Wei Ming flying!

“Son!” Wei Tao ran over as if he had gone mad.

He hugged Wei Ming tightly, tears streaming down his face.

“Don’t worry, he won’t die. At most, he’ll be a vegetable,” Jiang Gu said lightly.

Wei Tao’s face instantly turned ashen.

However, not only did he not dare to flare up, he even half-knelt on the ground and said in pain, “Many... Many thanks to Lord Jiang for not killing my son...”

Jiang Gu snorted coldly, his body flashed, and he left in large strides.

Following that, everyone related to Qin Yu was suppressed.

Wei Jiang even lost his job because of this!

“Family head, there’s still no news of that Qin Yu. He fled abroad, and we can’t find him at all,” Uncle Zhong said with a frown.

Jiang Gu snorted coldly and said, “Follow me to Jiangcheng. As long as he doesn’t appear, I’ll kill a person. I want to see how long he can hide!”

“Yes, Master!” Uncle Zhong nodded quickly.

...

At this time, Qin Yu had already made 31 raw pills.

“Phew, it’s finally done.”Qin Yu wiped his sweat, looking a little tired.

Then, Qin Yu handed the Marrow Pill and the Impulse Protection Pill to Yang Jing.

“Take the Impulse Protection Pill first. As for the Marrow Pill, take it once a day. After a month, come to me for more medicine,” said Qin Yu.

Yang Jing looked at the Marrow Pill and asked curiously, “Can this really cure my father?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “If you don’t believe it, you can throw it away.”

“No way! I spent three hundred million!” Yang Jing said with a bit of heartache.

Peter and Xu Maojun took the Marrow Pill and began to study it carefully.
