Chapter 37: No One Will Be Able to Rescue You Today! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The crowd at the scene gasped as they looked at Shen Tian, whose mouth was covered in blood!

Qin Yu actually had the guts to hit Shen Tian? And he struck so ruthlessly?

”This brat is dead meat!” Su Yan and Zhao Gang were ecstatic! They were well aware that Shen Tian would never let Qin Yu off the hook!

”Thanks a lot, Mr. Qin...” Lei Hu said gratefully.

Qin Yu did not say anything as he slowly stood up and gave Shen Tian a cold, hard look.

Shen Tian wiped the blood on his mouth and said with indignation, “You... You have the guts to hit me?”

Qin Yu replied coldly, “You insulted me numerous times and at first I didn’t take it seriously. However, not only did you not call it a day, but you became more aggressive instead. Do you really think I wouldn’t get angry?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Shen Tian was so enraged that he roared, “I’ll kill you!” and rushed towards Qin Yu with clenched fists!

Shen Tian had been training in the Chuzhou Region since he was a child so was naturally not to be underestimated.

However, he was no match for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu easily dodged Shen Tian’s attack multiple times.

”Are you done fighting?” Qin Yu said, a cold smile on his lips.

Shen Tian stood gasping for breath at a distance, his rage intensifying the more he looked at Qin Yu.

”Since the fight is over, it’s now my turn.” Qin Yu sneered, then clenched his fist and swung it hard at Shen Tian.

Qin Yu punch was extremely quick and had such tremendous force! Even from a distance, one could sense the unrivaled force of his punch.

Shen Tian’s expression changed and he quickly tried to dodge to his side, but was unfortunately too slow.

The punch landed solidly on Shen Tian’s chest!

With a loud bang, Shen Tian took several steps backwards and landed on his bottom!

”Qin Yu, I’ll kill you!” Shen Tian glared at him with rage.

Qin Yu frowned a little as he took a step forward and said coldly, “If people like you aren’t taught a lesson, you’ll never change.”

”For the sake of Miss Yan, I will only break your arm today.” Qin Yu slowly walked towards Shen Tian.

Shen Tian’s face immediately grew pale. Since he was a child, no one had ever dared to hurt him, making him extremely brazen. Therefore, he didn’t expect that Qin Yu was going to break one of his arms today.

At that moment, Qin Yu extended his hand to Shen Tian’s arm.

”How dare you!”

At that very moment, the white-haired young man made a move.

With a furious bellow, he threw a punch at Qin Yu.

”You can’t do anything to stop me!” Qin Yu remained unfazed and reached out to meet him head on.

The two fists collided with a “bang”.

The white haired young man’s wrist broke instantly.

”This... How is this possible?” The white-haired young man looked down at his wrist incredulously.

Qin Yu snickered.

Right from the moment he saw the white-haired young man, Qin Yu could tell that this person was dangerous and that even he himself was no match for him.

Therefore, Qin Yu had prepared himself early, and in the midst of the crowd’s tirade of scorn, he gradually took his time to absorb the concentrated spiritual energy of the place.

Just a short while ago, he had successfully reached the third level of Qi Refining stage.

”If I hadn’t reached this new level, I really might not have been able to be his opponent.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but to secretly muse as he glanced at the white-haired young man.

This made Qin Yu lament that there was no telling how many experts these rich families had at their disposal.

”Now, it’s your turn.” Qin Yu turned around to look at Shen Tian coldly.

”Help me! Hurry up and help me!” Shen Tian was completely distraught. He could sense that Qin Yu was definitely not fooling around.

The white-haired young man gritted his teeth and rushed towards Qin Yu again.

Qin Yu didn’t even dodge, but instead punched him directly in the other arm.

With a sharp crack, the white haired young man’s arm was broken.

”Ouch!” The white-haired young man roared in pain as he tried to move both arms.

The crowd couldn’t help but gasp and move away to avoid getting caught in the crossfire.

”When did Qin Yu... become such a skilled fighter...” Even Su Yan couldn’t help but cover her mouth, an astonished expression on her face.

By this time, Qin Yu had already walked up to Shen Tian.

”No one will be able to rescue you today,” Qin Yu said menacingly.

”Qin Yu, if you try to lay your hands on me, my father won’t let you off the hook!” Shen Tian roared in terror.

He fell to the ground, and kept retreating backwards.

Faced with Shen Tian’s threat, Qin Yu wasn’t in the slightest bit intimidated.

He slowly raised his foot and stomped down on Shen Tian’s arm.

Another crisp crack resounded, and Shen Tian’s arm was broken into pieces.

”Ouch!” Shen Tian yelled out in pain.

Covering his arm, he roared in fury, “You son of a b*tch... How dare you break my arm... I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!”

When he heard Shen Tian’s furious snarl, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He turned around.

”You really have a potty mouth.” Qin Yu extended his hand to give Shen Tian a heavy slap on the mouth.

The slap was so heavy that it ruptured Shen Tian’s lips and fractured his jaw. He couldn’t utter a single word.
