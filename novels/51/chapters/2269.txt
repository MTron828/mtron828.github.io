2270 The Red-Haired Fang-Toothed Evil Spirits

“What exactly is hidden underground?”

Qin Yu was thinking intensely. Could it be that Xiao Yu was below? Qin Yu dared not imagine what kind of terrifying existence would breed when such terrifying spiritual energy entered the depths of this palace.

At this moment, the “person” with red hair and fangs was killed again in the palace, and his body had actually doubled in size, and his face looked like an evil spirit. His pupils were like two red lanterns, and the skulls in his hands were emitting billowing green smoke. Regardless of who the terrifying iron chain came into contact with, one would be destroyed immediately. No one was a match for it.

“The source of their power seems to be from underground. The more people die, the stronger the evil spirits that appear in this palace will be. It’s useless to waste time here.”

Situ Haoyue said softly and closed his eyes.

Several streams of the power of Path of Heaven broke through the compact palace and accurately landed on the bodies of several fang-toothed evil spirits.

The evil spirits’ bodies staggered. They were temporarily suppressed by a terrifying gravity struggling wildly.

“This is the limit. We can’t trap them for long.”

Situ Haoyue frowned.

“We can only enter the core of this Ghost Mansion and find the crucial point of destruction to have a chance of survival.” Chang Ye shook its head.

“However, entering it also means boundless encounters. If we encounter the masked woman who exterminated the Immortal Slaying Sect back then, we will certainly die. However, I haven’t sensed any tremendously powerful existence in the Ghost Mansion in the meantime.”

Chang Ye narrowed his eyes and said.

“Boom!”

Suddenly, a terrifying fluctuation shook the space.

Several massive chains of the way invisible to the naked eye suddenly connected to the remaining red-haired evil spirits.

The red-haired evil spirits suddenly struggled violently. Their legs suddenly swelled up, and their bodies expanded to nearly a hundred meters tall. Red flames appeared in the pupils of the heads on their chains.

The iron chain turned into a blood-red sickle, and drops of blood from ancient times slowly seeped down.

The terrifying power of internal qi had even made several strongest people reveal a fearful expression. In this palace where strength was suppressed, not many people could match the strength of these evil spirits.

The power of rules that Situ Haoyue had suppressed on them instantly broke free.

The red-haired evil spirit suddenly kicked out, and its body turned into a terrifying red light as it arrived in front of a ninth-grade True Saint cultivator.

The blood-red sickle slashed down. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Chirp!”

A black crack appeared in the palace, and the shadow of the sickle slowly disappeared after a few seconds.

A line of blood appeared in the middle of the ninth-grade True Saint’s forehead. His body suddenly split into two and fell onto the ground. His internal organs were smashed and scattered everywhere.

He killed a ninth-grade True Saint in one hit!

A chill enveloped everyone’s hearts.

The red-haired evil spirit’s leg bent backward slightly, and the green muscles on its calf expanded wildly. The massive veins bulged like hemp ropes, and Qin Yu felt a chill in his heart.

Before his gaze could capture any information, the red-haired evil spirit had already appeared behind him.

Without any hesitation, he unleashed the line word formula under the Gale Resistance Boot and used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique. His body instantly turned into an afterimage.

That sense of danger did not disappear, and Qin Yu’s hair stood on end.

He dared not even spend additional divine sense to sense where the red-haired evil spirit was. Wherever his figure went, countless shadows of red sickles instantly appeared and followed Qin Yu’s afterimage to another location.

In just an instant, the sickle had already slashed 30 to 40 times.

Throughout the space, there were immense sounds of void tearing and ripping. Qin Yu’s physical body was terrifyingly strong, to begin with, and coupled with various techniques and the Gale Resistance Boot.

Although he had suppressed it in terms of the way, its speed was terrifyingly fast. Even with such speed, he was still unable to shake off the red-haired evil spirit.

“What a fast speed.”

Situ Haoyue praised.

“My speed is inferior to his.” Chang Ye was also a little surprised.

At this moment, the evil exterminator narrowed his eyes and suddenly slashed at the ground.

Even under the suppression of rules, the terrifying sword light still carried a tremendous power of rules as it ruthlessly landed in the palace.

The massive sword energy instantly lit up the entire palace.

The ground shook violently, but after the quake, there was not a single crack.

“Let’s attack the center of the netherworld with all our might!”

The evil exterminator’s voice suddenly spread throughout the entire palace.

In an instant, except for the cultivators chased by the evil spirits, everyone had a solemn expression as they prepared to attack.

Those who survived were all powerful people. Everyone could see that something was wrong.

If they did not destroy this palace, no one could escape.

In an instant, the heaven-shaking spiritual energy almost tore the entire space apart.

However, the palace only shook for a while and then returned to normal.

After that, there was a strange vibration of rules. Energy seemed to be transmitted from underground and surged into the red-haired evil spirit.

The evil spirit evolved again. This time, after the evil spirit’s body expanded, Qin Yu’s speed was no longer comparable to the evil spirit.

A suffocating sense of danger enveloped Qin Yu’s heart. Without thinking, he punched out with all his might. With the help of the erupting qi energy, he accelerated again. The blood-red sickle brushed past his scalp.

The strong smell of blood almost made Qin Yu vomit. His divine sense suddenly transmitted countless bloody scenes from ancient times. The sickle seemed to carry ancient memories. Even the moment it came into contact with him, it conveyed the bloody historical events.

The next moment, the hundred-meter-tall evil spirit appeared before Qin Yu. The blood-red giant sickle was raised high, and then it slashed down at a speed that was difficult to capture with the naked eye and divine sense.

Qin Yu was scared out of his wits. He crossed his hands and propped them up.

Suddenly, a white-robed man stood up, and a terrifying sword light containing tremendous killing intent suddenly slashed down.

The red-haired evil spirit was bombarded to the wall of the palace, and the evil spirit’s massive body was violently rammed against the wall by the sword light.

The sword light did not dissipate and let out a massive sword chant, cutting the body of the red-haired evil ghost wildly.

After dozens of seconds, the sword light slowly disappeared.

“Thank you.”

Qin Yu looked at that familiar person and was at a loss for words.

From the beginning, the aristocratic families of the Holy Region had used his sister’s life to threaten him to kill Qin Yu, but he granted Qin Yu some time.

After the last strike, he kept away his sword and stopped attacking.

Now, he again saved his life here. Qin Yu could not understand this person’s thoughts.

A massive sword gash appeared on the red-haired evil spirit’s body, and green mucus was left behind from his body. The moment the liquid dripped onto the ground, it emitted countless white corrosive mists.

“What a strong person!”

“He’s Xi Menn, isn’t he?”

This terrifying sword energy finally allowed the people in the palace to heave a sigh of relief.
