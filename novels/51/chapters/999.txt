Chapter 1000: Chapter 1000, Princess?

Qin Yu sat in the hall and couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

A few minutes later.

NIE tianxiang walked in with a man.

This man’s appearance was extremely strange, and there was a strange mark between his brows.

The man walked directly to Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Greetings, Sect Master Qin.”

Qin Yu stood up and said somewhat impatiently, “You have the Heavenly Vanilla in your hand? Is It True?”

The Man didn’t answer in a hurry. Instead, he glanced at nie tianxiang beside him.

Qin Yu immediately understood and immediately waved his hand. “You can go out first.”

“Yes.”Nie tianxiang cupped his hands and turned to walk out of the hall.

In the hall, only Qin Yu and this strange man were left.

The man looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Let me introduce myself. My name is Hua Zongxiong. You can also call Me Brother Xiong.”

Qin Yu was not in the mood to listen to his nonsense, but he did not want to be too direct, so he could only respond politely, “Greetings, Brother Xiong.”

Hua zongxiong continued, “Back then, you unified all the sects in Shengguo in one go. Such a magnificent feat is indeed admirable.”

“Brother Xiong, you flatter me.”Qin Yu said patiently.

However, at this time, Hua Zongxiong changed the topic.

He said with a faint smile, “Unfortunately, after you unified the Heaven Gate, you left Shengguo. Although you controlled everyone with the divine seal pill, unfortunately, you are not popular at all. You have no foundation to speak of.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu already felt that something was strange.

He frowned and asked, “Brother Xiong, what do you mean by this?”

Hua zongxiong said indifferently, “Therefore, you, the sect master, are not worthy of your name.”

“Now that you’ve suddenly returned to the Sheng Kingdom and spread the news, I’m afraid there’s only one reason why you want a stalk of heavenly vanilla.”

“That’s because you failed to transcend the tribulation! You couldn’t stay in the country anymore and ran to the Sheng Kingdom to escape!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly, “You don’t have any heavenly vanilla at all?”

“Hahaha, not bad!”Hua zongxiong laughed loudly.

“I came here to persuade you.”

Qin Yu frowned.

Sure enough, as long as there were people, there would be disputes.

“If you are willing to give up the Heaven Gate now, I might consider sparing your life or even keeping you in the Heaven Gate,”Hua Zongxiong said indifferently.

Qin Yu said coldly, “What if I don’t agree?”

“If you don’t agree, then I will kill you,”Hua Zongxiong said straightforwardly.

After he finished speaking, the internal Qi on Hua Zongxiong’s body exploded!

“Martial saint? !”

Qin Yu’s face instantly changed drastically!

The Hua Zongxiong in front of him was actually a martial saint!

Hua zongxiong said indifferently, “You should know that you don’t have the slightest power to fight back in front of me.”

“I’ve already given you enough face by sending all the people out and talking to you alone. I hope you don’t fail to appreciate my kindness.”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

If he were to directly clash with this Hua Zongxiong, he would definitely die.

“Give me a few days to think about it,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Hua zongxiong snorted lightly and said, “Sure, I can give you three days, but I hope you won’t play tricks.”

“In three days, I hope you can give me the answer I want.”

After saying that, Hua Zongxiong stood up and left.

After he left, NIE tianxiang rushed in.

“Sect Master Qin, how is it? Did he give you the heavenly vanilla?”Nie tianxiang asked.

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile and said, “No, it’s not that easy to get the heavenly vanilla.”

A hint of confusion flashed across nie tianxiang’s face.

He wanted to ask more questions, but Qin Yu waved his hand and interrupted nie tianxiang.

Hua Zongxiong was right. He had no foundation in the Heaven Gate.

To the disciples of the Heaven Gate, it didn’t make any difference who would be the sect master.

That night, Qin Yu sat on the roof and couldn’t fall asleep for a long time.

“It seems like it’s impossible to obtain the Heaven Vanilla,”Qin Yu muttered softly.

“Do I really have to be trapped in the half-step martial saint realm for the rest of my life?”

This made Qin Yu feel extremely hopeless.

If all the cultivation stopped here, then this journey would be meaningless.

“If it really doesn’t work, I can only temporarily give up the Heaven Gate.”Qin Yu made up his mind.

At this moment.

Qin Yu suddenly felt a movement coming from the dark.

“Who is it? !”

Qin Yu hurriedly turned around and shouted.

“Divine sense is quite sharp.”A voice came from behind.

Turning around, he saw a middle-aged man in luxurious clothes standing behind him.

Qin Yu looked at this person with vigilance and said coldly, “Who are you? Why are you spying on Me?”

The other party put his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile, “The Golden Core left such a DAO wound. I think you must have broken through to the martial saint realm by force, right?”

Qin Yu shouted, “Cut the crap! Who exactly are you! If you don’t tell me, Don’t blame me for being impolite!”

“Oh?”The other party raised his eyebrows and a trace of ridicule flashed across his face.

Qin Yu was instantly furious and charged at him with a clenched fist!

Although this punch was purely physical strength, the power was unimaginable!

But what shocked Qin Yu was that when Qin Yu’s fist touched his body, the fist directly passed through his body!

“Huh? !”Qin Yu frowned tightly.

He turned around and threw another punch! But the result was still the same!

That was clearly a physical body, but Qin Yu couldn’t touch it at all!

“Spatial spell?”Qin Yu seemed to have stepped on something.

“You know spatial spell?”The other party was clearly a little surprised.

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “If you have practiced spatial spell to such a degree, I’m afraid your strength is at least a martial saint.”

“Martial Saint?”That middle-aged man raised his eyebrows and then laughed out loud.

“Alright, I won’t tease you anymore.”At this time, he said seriously.

Qin Yu’s face was gloomy and he was extremely vigilant.

The middle-aged man smiled lightly and said, “Don’t be nervous. The princess sent me here to give you something.”
