Chapter 722: See You In a Month! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The heavenly guardian book was the legendary book of contract.

Just as the man with the mustache had said, this contract couldn’t be violated, or else it would endanger the soul.

The man with the mustache placed the heavenly guardian book in front of the two of them with a flattering smile on his face.

“Granny Qin, I was afraid that Qin Yu wouldn’t keep his word, so I specially prepared the heavenly guardian book for you,” the man with the mustache said with a grin. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Even though he said so, everyone knew that the man with the mustache was obviously helping Qin Yu.

If Qin Yu really lost, then he would face death, so why would he need to sign a heavenly guardian book?

Granny Qin’s expression was a bit gloomy. She fiercely glared at the man with the mustache, and looked as if she wanted to swallow the man with the mustache alive.

“I don’t need to sign a heavenly guardian book,” Granny Qin said with a cold snort.

“I represent the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. I will never break the contract.”

Qin Yu sneered. “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has always backtracked. If you don’t dare to sign it, then say you don’t dare to.”

Granny Qin’s expression became colder and colder. She narrowed her eyes and said, “Qin Yu, watch your tone when you speak.”

“Cut the crap. Do you dare to, or do you not dare to?” Qin Yu sneered.

“It seems that you don’t have much confidence in this beast that you raised. Why? Are you afraid that I’ll kill him with a slap?”

Before Granny Qin could speak, Blackie couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He strode forward and said coldly, “I’ll sign with you! Who’s afraid of you?!”

Seeing this, the man with the mustache hurriedly said, “Come, bite your finger and drop your blood on the heavenly guardian book.”

Blackie snorted. Just as he was about to bite his finger, Granny Qin grabbed his wrist.

“Let me do it,” Granny Qin said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered. “Anyone can do it. The result will be the same anyway.”

Granny Qin didn’t say anything. She walked to the heavenly guardian book and bit her finger.

Drops of blood dripped onto the heavenly guardian book along her finger.

The moment the blood dripped, thick smoke immediately rose from the heavenly guardian book!

Then, the thick smoke turned into wisps of light and headed straight for Granny Qin’s glabella!

“Buzz!”

The light entered Granny Qin’s glabella and the bet was officially signed.

“It’s your turn,” Granny Qin said with her eyes narrowed.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He bit his finger and dripped the blood onto the heavenly guardian book.

Another flash of light, and the bet between the two of them officially took effect.

“See you at the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in a month.” The man with the mustache put away the heavenly guardian book.

He grinned at Granny Qin, then pretended to warn Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, let me tell you. If this bet isn’t completed, you will never be able to break the agreement. Your soul will be signed with the underworld for the rest of your life. Do you understand?” The man with the mustache said.

It seemed like he was saying this to Qin Yu, but in reality, he was warning Granny Qin.

If anything happened to Qin Yu during this period of time, it meant that the bet couldn’t be completed according to the agreement, let alone be broken.

As a result, Qin Yu gained a month of safety.

“I understand,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

At this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t help but give the man with the mustache a thumbs up in his heart.

This guy was really “crafty”.

Granny Qin also saw through the intentions of the man with the mustache. She glared fiercely at the man with the mustache and said, “Kid, you have quite a few tricks up your sleeve...”

The man with the mustache hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Granny Qin, you’re joking. I’m just an ant, a bottom-level person. How can I have any tricks up my sleeve?”

Granny Qin couldn’t help but clench her teeth again.

This man with the mustache spoke in a sarcastic manner. It really made people angry.

Granny Qin took a deep breath. Then, she sized up the man with the mustache and said, “Are you interested in working for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

As soon as these words were said, everyone was shocked!

Even Qin Yu opened his mouth slightly.

Granny Qin was actually recruiting the man with the mustache?

“Granny Qin, is what you said true?” The man with the mustache asked in surprise.

Granny Qin said with a nonchalant smile, “I think you are a talent. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association won’t miss out on any talent.”

The man with the mustache exclaimed, “Granny Qin, is what you said true? A lowly ant like me has the qualifications to join the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? Oh my God, is this a dream?”

“Aren’t those who can join the Jingdu Martial Arts Association all people with noble bloodlines like you? Am I worthy?”

When these words were said, someone below the stage couldn’t help but laugh.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

This man with the mustache was really a drama Queen.

Granny Qin’s expression became uglier and uglier, and her face even twitched slightly.

Obviously, Granny Qin was thoroughly enraged.

She looked coldly at the man with the mustache and said, “You shameless thing.”

The man with the mustache smiled embarrassedly and said, “Granny Qin, what are you saying? I just feel that I’m not worthy of such a noble organization.”

Granny Qin knew that she wouldn’t be able to gain any benefits, so she no longer paid attention to the man with the mustache.

She looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, cherish your last moments.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You should say that to your beast.”

Granny Qin didn’t say anything more. She turned around and left with Blackie.

After she left, Qin Yu also came down from the stage.

“Qin Yu, you are really capable. Blackie seems to be Granny Qin’s personal disciple. Even I might not be 100% certain of defeating it.” Yan Jinyao walked forward and said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Jinyao and said with a sneer, “Whether you’re confident or not is none of my business. You really think highly of yourself.”

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes slightly and said in a cold voice, “Qin Yu, you’ve already offended Granny Qin. Don’t tell me you want to offend me.”

Qin Yu pointed at Yan Jinyao’s nose and said, “Yan Jinyao, I’ll kill you in a month. Don’t be anxious.”

Yan Jinyao laughed and said, “Madman! I also want to experience it. Why don’t you show me now?”

“If you want to beat me, I’ll accompany you!” At this time, Chang Mang jumped up and stood in front of Yan Jinyao.

Yan Jinyao looked at Chang Mang coldly and said, “Kid, you’re not dead yet? Well, I wanted to teach you a lesson since last time.”

“Is that so? Then you can come and try!” Chang Mang was full of energy and fighting spirit.

Qin Yu tugged at Chang Mang and then looked at Yan Jinyao and said, “Yan Jinyao, don’t worry. I’ll satisfy you in a month.”

Yan Jinyao snorted and said, “Okay, I’ll see you in a month.”

After saying that, Yan Jinyao turned around and left.
