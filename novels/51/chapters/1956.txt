1957 The Vision of the Ancient Supreme Cultivator

What Qin Yu said was true. Under such circumstances, it would definitely affect the dao mind.

Si Shifeng’s expression was gloomy and uncertain. Although he had the life-and-death diagram, he was far inferior to a genius like Si Shiyu!

Si Shiyu’s talent wasn’t any worse than Si Shiyue’s. It was just that he didn’t have Si Shiyue’s physique!

Even Si Shiyu’s life-and-death diagram could not stop Qin Yu, let alone a mere Si Shifeng!

“Come, Si Shifeng. Today, I’ll break your dao heart!” Qin Yu took a step forward, and the surface of the entire ground began to crack!

With the support of the fighting word formula, Qin Yu’s internal qi became even more terrifying. He could almost sweep everything away!

Si Shifeng shouted as well. He stretched out his hand, and a spear appeared from the death diagram!

This spear was the divine weapon Si Shifeng often used. At this moment, the divine weapon had fused with the death diagram, and its power had reached a terrifying level!

“Qin Yu, don’t be so arrogant. Today is the day you must die!” After Si Shifeng angrily shouted, he trusted his spear forward.

Almost in an instant, the spear had stabbed out hundreds of times, leaving extremely glaring traces in the void!

Everything in the surroundings crumbled. No one could withstand the destructive internal qi anymore. They all fled toward Sky City to seek protection!

Qin Yu’s technique was very simple. He raised his hand and cast the Star Seal again!

However, with the help of the life-and-death diagram, the Star Seal seemed to be caught in a difficult position. After a few seconds, the Star Seal trembled and suddenly exploded!

Qin Yu, who had used this technique, was immediately hit by the backlash. His body retreated a few steps, and he spat out a mouthful of blood!

“The power of the life-and-death diagram is too terrifying,” the Prince of Great Xia said in a low voice on the city gate tower.

Although he had lost the ability to fight, his judgment of the situation was tremendously accurate.

“Yes. Under such an attack, I’m afraid even Qin Yu will find it difficult to deal with it,” someone beside him chimed in.

There was no way Si Shifeng would miss such an opportunity. The spear in his hand stabbed out randomly, and in an instant, it was as if ten thousand arrows were shooting out!

Qin Yu hugged the Star Seal and protected it behind him. At the same time, he took out the Venerable Fifth Mountain and pressed it down on Si Shifeng!

“All the bullsh*it magical artifacts are useless in front of me!” With an explosive shout, Si Shifeng’s spear received the attack!

“Clang!”

The Venerable Fifth Mountain could only withstand it for less than half a second before it was repelled!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He could not help but feel shocked.

Although the Venerable Fifth Mountain was damaged, it contained overwhelming force. It could nearly suppress everything! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

But now, Si Shifeng had used his spear to force it back. How terrifying the power was!

“Even Si Shifeng is so terrifying. I wonder how powerful Si Shiyue is,” someone exclaimed.

” Si Shiyue is the Si family’s Holy son. Among the younger generation in the world, he can be the king. It’s definitely not a good decision for Qin Yu to offend him.”

“He does it for the beauty, but he has to care about his life!.”

Faced with this terrifying attack, Qin Yu was forced to retreat in a sorry state.

“Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!”

Soon, being careless, Qin Yu’s body was stabbed with several bloody holes.

Even his golden body was unable to resist, leaving behind traces of blood.

“If this continues, Qin Yu will die for sure.” The crowd sighed. The outcome of this battle seemed to be clear now.

“Go to hell!”

At this moment, Si Shifeng shouted and pointed his spear at Qin Yu.

The black light turned into a horned dragon and coiled around the spear, turning it into pure black color!

An extremely thick black light beam shot out from his spear. The destructive power terrified everyone!

“What a terrifying power!”

The entire earth began to collapse, and the ground within a radius of several stars collapsed completely. Other than the Sky City, the other cities were completely destroyed!

“Rumble!”

The Great Dao was crumbling, and the rules seemed to be in disorder. A battle of such a scale could actually affect the Great Dao!

The destructive power continued, and everything within a radius of several hundred stars was shattered. No one dared to imagine what kind of terrifying battle this was!

“He already has such terrifying combat power at the Reversion Void Stage. If he is a True Saint… Wouldn’t that be enough to destroy the Holy Region?”

“Not to mention destroying the Holy Region. He can at least destroy Zhongzhou!”

“No wonder the True Saints have stopped making their moves. If they want to make a move, I’m afraid they’ll have to go to regions outside!”

Just as everyone was talking, the spear was fast approaching Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

It was a terrifying explosion that seemed to be able to destroy everything!

“This Qin Yu is dead for sure!” Seeing this, everyone exclaimed!

However, at this moment, a star as big as the full moon appeared in the black light!

Before the crowd could exclaim, a huge body appeared in front of them!

This body was a phantom, and the phantom was none other than Qin Yu!

“It’s Qin Yu!” someone said shockingly.

“It… It is his vision!”

...

“He used the vision to cast the Star Seal! I can’t believe there’s such a combination in this world!”

“He has withstood it!”

Qin Yu’s body was riddled with wounds and was too horrible to look at. However, the vision behind him was holding a star and blocking the attack!

Si Shifeng’s expression changed drastically, and he angrily shouted, “Vision! It’s actually your own vision!”

Qin Yu didn’t say a thing, but the vision behind him smashed down fiercely with the Star Seal!

“Qin Yu, you’re no match for me!” Si Shifeng raised his head and roared.

At this moment, a similar vision also appeared behind him!

It was a blurry figure that no one could see clearly. The huge vision raised its palm and pushed it straight toward the Star Seal!

“Boom!”

The huge hands caught the Star Seal, and the two parties immediately began their battle!

“Rumble…”

...

Both parties were in a constant stalemate. Even though Si Shifeng had summoned an incredibly terrifying vision, he was unable to stop the Star Seal!

“Hmph! Do you think I have no other way?” Si Shifeng snorted coldly. He then stretched out his hand and took out a magical artifact!

The magical artifact exuded an extremely ancient internal qi. When this internal qi entered the phantom, the phantom immediately became more solid, and its power also increased drastically!

“Boom!”

With the support of this magical artifact, the Star Seal was pushed away and exploded in the void!

“What a terrifying vision! He seems to be an ancient supreme cultivator of the Si family!”

“That’s right. It must be the ancient supreme cultivator of the Si family. Otherwise, how could he be so terrifying?”

Si Shifeng didn’t give Qin Yu a chance to catch his breath. He activated his vision and ruthlessly threw a punch!

Qin Yu closed his eyes and activated the vision. A terrifying golden light burst out from his fist to receive the attack!

“Boom!”

A terrifying collision occurred at this moment!
