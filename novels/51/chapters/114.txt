Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Mr. Long couldn’t help but frown.

“Who are you?” Mr. Long said with a cold expression.

“I’m Qin Yu. Don’t you know me?” Qin Yu snorted coldly.

“Enough, Qin Yu. Stop fooling around. The Qin Yu that Mr. Long is talking about isn’t you, Qin Yu!” Sun Ying rolled her eyes.

Mr. Long turned to Sun Ying and said, “Sun Ying, who is this person?”

Sun Ying said somewhat reluctantly, “My cousin’s husband is also called Qin Yu. He’s just a good-for-nothing son-in-law.”

When Mr. Long heard this, he couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Kid, I really don’t know you!” Mr. Long said with some amusement.

“I don’t know a loser like you.” At the end, Mr. Long added another sentence.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “At least I’m better than someone like you, who only knows how to brag.”

“I’m bragging? Kid, do you want to get beaten?!” Mr. Long instantly flew into a rage and walked in front of Qin Yu!

Yao Qing immediately took a step forward and looked at Mr. Long coldly.

“If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you,” Yao Qing said coldly.

Mr. Long sized up Yao Qing and couldn’t help but sneer. “Why is a cripple acting all high and mighty? I don’t bully disabled people.”

“Mr. Long, forget it. He’s my brother-in-law after all. Stop fooling around.” Sun Ying saw the situation and hurriedly stopped him.

Mr. Long glanced at Sun Ying and said with a cold expression, “After he dared to talk to me like that, how can I just let it go?”

Sun Ying’s expression was a bit ugly. She quickly walked over and pulled Qin Yu while saying, “Qin Yu, Mr. Long is from a powerful family. Quickly apologize to him!”

“Apologize to him? Is he worthy of it?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“Qin Yu!” Sun Ying’s expression instantly turned ashen!

Mr. Long’s expression was dark as he said, “Kid, you’re really arrogant to the extreme! I have to teach you a lesson today!”

After saying that, Mr. Long clenched his fists and walked towards Qin Yu.

At this time, Sun Ying held Mr. Long back firmly.

She said with some pleading, “Mr. Long, just let it go for my sake, okay?”

Mr. Long looked at Sun Ying’s figure, and a crafty look flashed across his face.

“Okay, I won’t lower myself to his level for your sake,” Mr. Long said indifferently.

Sun Ying quickly said, “Thank you, Mr. Long!”

Mr. Long snorted and didn’t say anything else.

Then, Sun Ying quickly walked to Qin Yu and said with some anger, “Qin Yu, this isn’t Jiangcheng. It’s South City! You’d better not cause trouble, or else I won’t be able to explain to my sister!”

“Your sister and I have nothing to do with each other. You don’t need to account to anyone,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Sun Ying didn’t know that Qin Yu and Su Yan had divorced. She thought that Qin Yu was just saying so in anger again, so she waved her hand and said, “Forget it. I can’t be bothered to care about your business. Just don’t cause trouble for me.”

After saying that, Sun Ying turned her head and walked to the side.

After she left, Yao Qing couldn’t help but say, “Mr. Qin, why don’t you let me teach Jiang Long a lesson?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There’s no need to lower yourself to his level.”

Yao Qing could only nod his head.

Qin Yu looked at the Water Dragon Cave.

He tried to release his internal qi to feel the hot air coming out of the Water Dragon Cave.

As expected, a faint spiritual energy surged into Qin Yu’s body.

Although it was very thin, it was enough to prove that there was definitely something in the Water Dragon Cave.

“Just from the heat alone, I can feel the spiritual energy in it. I wonder what is in the water,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

When the competition was over, he must go in and take a look.

As time went by, more and more tourists came to this area.

Although the Water Dragon Cave was sealed off, there were still many people watching outside the quarantine line.

Soon, it was past seven o’clock in the evening.

The sky gradually darkened, and lights were lit up near the Water Dragon Cave.

At this moment, commotion suddenly came from the crowd a short distance away.

“Young Master Liu is here!” Someone shouted.

When everyone heard this, they immediately looked in the direction of the sound!

Sun Ying and the others beside them also looked in that direction.

“Mr. Long, Young Master Liu is here!” Chen Xin reminded from the side.

Mr. Long said indifferently, “I know. I’ll greet him later and bring you in.”

“Thank you, Mr. Long!” Sun Ying and Chen Xin shouted. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“However, he can’t go in.” At this time, Mr. Long pointed at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “I don’t need you to bring me in.”

“That’s good.” Mr. Long snorted.

As he spoke, Young Master Liu was already walking toward the direction of the Water Dragon Cave while surrounded by the crowd.

He was getting closer and closer to Qin Yu and the others. Mr. Long took this opportunity and walked forward quickly.

“Young Master Liu!” Mr. Long walked quickly to Young Master Liu and bowed.

Liu Shihui looked at Jiang Long and frowned. “You are?”

“I’m Jiang Song’s son, Jiang Long. We ate together!” Jiang Long said quickly.

Liu Shihui frowned and thought for a moment. Then he nodded and said, “I remember. There seemed to be such a person.”

Hearing this, Jiang Long suddenly looked at Sun Ying and the others with pride, as if he was showing off.

Then, Jiang Long continued, “Young Master Liu, the Water Dragon Cave is already isolated. It’s too far away. My friends can’t see it. Can you let us go in to watch for my sake?”

Liu Shihui frowned slightly and immediately looked at Jiang Long coldly.

“For your sake?” Liu Shihui narrowed his eyes and said.

As soon as he finished speaking, Liu Shihui suddenly raised his hand and slapped Jiang Long’s face!

“Who do you think you are? How dare you ask for a favor from me? In my eyes, your father is just a nobody. Who do you think you are?” Liu Shihui berated coldly.

Jiang Long covered his face and stood there looking extremely embarrassed.

“Get lost!” Liu Shihui’s henchman shouted.

Jiang Long looked at Liu Shihui awkwardly and ran back dejectedly.

Sun Ying and the others were even more dumbfounded. There was a hint of disdain in their eyes.

“My father and the Liu family might have had a conflict,” Jiang Long braced himself and explained.

“It’s not a conflict, is it? I heard him clearly. He said that your father is a nobody,” Qin Yu said indifferently from the side.

When he heard this, Jiang Long’s face flushed again.

He was a little embarrassed and angry as he scolded, “So what? He’s still much more superior than a loser like you!”

Qin Yu snorted lightly and couldn’t be bothered with him.

At this moment, Liu Shihui walked towards Qin Yu.

“Young Master Liu is coming!” Chen Xin hurriedly shouted.

Jiang Long was stunned, and then he immediately felt lucky.

Could it be that Young Master Liu had changed his mind?

“See, Young Master Liu must be here to invite us in!” Jiang Long patted his chest and said.
