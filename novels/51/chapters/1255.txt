Chapter 1256: Chapter 1,256, heading to the Holy Region 

Of course, regardless of whether the heavenly blood rainbow agreed or not, Qin Yu had already shattered his physical body.

Afterwards, Qin Yu put the Heavenly Blood Rainbow into the spatial magic artifact.

Although this was a spatial magic artifact, in reality, it was equivalent to a prison.

To the Heavenly Blood Rainbow, this should be the most suitable place.

After doing all this, Qin Yu hurried back to the mountain forest of the East Continent, waiting to head to the Holy Region.

“I’m finally going to the saint-level.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter to himself.

In order to go to the saint-level, Qin Yu had waited for far too long, so long that everyone was about to lose hope.

Towards the saint-level, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with hope and anticipation.

It was said that it was a place where experts competed. Top-notch martial artist were as common as clouds, and geniuses were endlessly emerging.

In the golden era, who knew how many top-notch martial artists he would meet.

Of course, the most important thing was that he would be able to meet Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu sat alone in this forest, waiting for the news of his journey to the Holy Region.

He seemed to have gotten used to living alone, and his state of mind became more and more stable.

“Once I go to the Holy Region, I will be able to look for vitality,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Once he found vitality, he would be able to recover his spiritual energy and be able to cultivate again.

Over the past year, Qin Yu had traveled to more than half of earth and experienced a hundred different life experiences.

After he recovered his spiritual energy, he might be able to directly raise his cultivation realm. After all, there was no lack of spiritual energy required for cultivation in the saint realm.

At this moment, the sound of footsteps could be heard from outside.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and stood up subconsciously.

He saw several mighty figures standing outside the door.

They were the reclusive mighty realm. A total of five people had come to pay a visit.

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “Elder Bai has already agreed to take you to the holy region. Why are you still looking for me?”

The few mighty figures looked at each other and then said, “Qin Yu, although the holy region is an even wider world, it also means that there are many dangers there. It Won’t be easy for the few of us to protect ourselves.”

“That’s right. Although we are in the mighty realm, our blood essence has dried up, so we might not be valued. So after thinking about it, we still feel that it’s better to follow you.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

He couldn’t even protect himself, so how could he protect these people.

“With my suggestion, it’s best if you don’t go.”Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

“Following me is an impossible thing. To be honest, in my current state, I’m afraid I Won’t be as valued as you guys.”

Not being able to cultivate meant that the road ahead was very short, and no one was willing to invest in it.

Of course, others didn’t know that Qin Yu was affected by the Twilight Qi, which was why it was like this. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

These few mighty figures thought that this was Qin Yu’s excuse, so they all pleaded.

However, Qin Yu was stubborn and resolutely refused them.

Moreover, Qin Yu didn’t tell them elder Bai’s true intentions. After all, these reclusive mighty figures weren’t worthy of trust.

Seeing that Qin Yu didn’t agree, they had no choice but to leave resentfully.

The sky gradually darkened. People had already begun to curry favor with elder Bai, Zi Ru, and the others.

Of course, they couldn’t be blamed for this. After all, going to an unfamiliar place without sufficient strength was a very dangerous thing.

The next morning.

In a certain ancient array platform in the mountain forest, it was already filled with people.

The leader was naturally elder Bai, while Zi Ru and the others followed behind him.

Although there was no limit to the number of people on this trip to the holy region, it couldn’t be helped that their requirements were extremely high. Therefore, there weren’t as many people who could actually go to the holy region as last time.

Qin Yu slowly walked towards the ancient array platform from the cave.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, a trace of viciousness flashed across Zi Ru’s eyes, but it was fleeting.

Other than Zi Ru, the others were also quite unnatural.

Elder Bai even hid a knife in his smile. He chuckled and said, “Qin Yu, I thought you weren’t coming.”

Qin Yu smiled faintly and said, “I’ve already spent too much effort to go to the holy region. How could I not come?”

Elder Bai couldn’t help but sneer in his heart.

I’m afraid that you won’t come!

When you go to the Holy Region, I’ll Teach You a lesson!

After that, elder Bai didn’t say anything more. He took out the formation flags and placed them in various positions.

The moment the formation flags fell, an extremely mysterious light began to circulate on the ancient formation stage.

Internal Qi of an old man rushed toward them. This aura was extremely heavy and heavy, making it difficult for them to breathe.

At elder Bai’s request, everyone walked up to the array platform.

Many people were still surrounding the ancient array platform. They seemed to want to witness the moment the ancient array platform was activated.

Elder Bai chanted an incantation silently, and the light on the ancient array platform became brighter and brighter.

“Buzz!”

After a while, an extremely ear-piercing sound cut through the silence of the mountain forest.

All of a sudden, a brilliant light covered everyone’s bodies, and the ancient array platform was officially activated!

Qin Yu felt as if his body had disappeared into the void. His surroundings were pitch-black, and he couldn’t even see his own fingers.

His body seemed to have used some sort of mysterious method to travel at high speed!

This feeling was extremely uncomfortable, and many people immediately fainted.

Even Qin Yu felt a hint of sleepiness.

But he didn’t dare to fall asleep, because he knew very well that once he reached the saint-level, he would have to start running.

“Saint-level... I’m Coming!”

Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, his heart filled with excitement and anticipation.
