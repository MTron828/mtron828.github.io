Chapter 948: Chapter 948, sucking blood

Yan Jinyao, who had thought that he was already outstanding enough, was once again struck down.

No one had expected that Qin Yu would be able to defeat a martial saint!

This truth, which had always been considered impossible, had now been broken by Qin Yu.

Just as the entire martial arts world was shocked, Qin Yu had already been brought to a prison in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

This prison was the one that had previously imprisoned Yan Ruoxue!

Not only that, even the equipment that had absorbed Yan Ruoxue’s blood had yet to be evacuated.

Qin Yu was thrown into this prison. The door was tightly shut, and measures had been put in place to prevent Qin Yu from escaping.

Looking at the prison that had been imprisoned, many prisoners looked over one after another.

“Qin Yu? Why is he being imprisoned again?”

“It seems like two martial saints brought him here this time. Could it be that he has already entered the Martial Saint Stage?”

“Hey, Qin Yu, Are You Alright?”

While many prisoners were discussing, Qin Yu was lying on the ground, unable to speak.

Qin Yu, who was already injured, had used his internal Qi to break ten thousand techniques with one punch twice. At this moment, his aura was in an extremely empty state, and he did not even have the strength to speak.

Qin Yu used the corner of his eye to look at the equipment placed in the prison, and his expression instantly became extremely gloomy.

Anger filled his chest.

This equipment, to Qin Yu, was an indelible pain.

He tried to stand up, but he simply couldn’t.

Helpless, Qin Yu could only maintain this action and try his best to recover his strength. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Unfortunately, there was no qi/spiritual energy in this prison, which made it impossible for Qin Yu to recover to his peak condition.

The next day.

Qin Yu’s body was finally able to move slightly.

He got up from the ground and looked at the huge device in front of him.

The scene of Yan Ruoxue being hung on the device appeared in his mind again.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his fists.

At this moment, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

What surprised Qin Yu was that the people who walked in were actually Gu Xinghe and Yan Jinyao!

“Young Master Gu, thank you,”Yan Jinyao said indifferently.

Gu Xinghe laughed loudly and said, “Don’t say that, Brother Yan. Our Jingdu Martial Arts Association will still need the support of Your Yan family in the future.”

Yan Jinyao bowed slightly to express his gratitude.

Gu Xinghe didn’t stay any longer and turned to leave.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Yan Jinyao and said, “Yan Jinyao, I didn’t expect you to show up. I thought you were going to hide forever.”

“Hide?”Yan Jinyao raised his eyebrows and sneered, “What do you mean by hide? Competing with trash like you is not hiding anymore, right?”

Qin Yu did not want to waste his breath on Yan Jinyao, so he said coldly, “What are you doing here?”

Yan Jinyao did not answer this question. Instead, he squinted his eyes and said, “I heard that you defeated a martial saint. I don’t know if it’s true or not.”

“What? You’ve suffered a great blow, haven’t you?”Qin Yu grinned and said.

“I’m not afraid to tell you that I have indeed defeated a martial saint. If not for Zhai Xing, I could even slaughter a martial saint.”

“This is beyond your reach, right?”

Although Yan Jinyao already knew about this matter, he was still extremely shocked when he heard Qin Yu admit it personally.

“It’s really surprising.”Yan Jinyao shook his head and said.

“I’m thinking, what kind of secret is hidden in your body?”

“I wouldn’t be so surprised if you could defeat a martial marquis as a martial grandmaster. After all, many people have done it before.”

“But now, you’ve defeated a martial saint... This makes me suspicious.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “What are you farting about? Hurry up and do it.”

Yan Jinyao still did not answer directly. He stared at the device behind Qin Yu and said, “This device was once used to suck the blood of your beloved woman. It’s said that the pain is unimaginable.”

“Qin Yu, do you want to try what kind of pain the woman you love has suffered?”

Qin Yu’s face turned cold and he said coldly, “What exactly do you want to say?”

Yan Jinyao smiled faintly and said, “Nothing. I just want to know if your body is like Yan Ruoxue’s and has some unimaginable bloodline?”

“F * ck you!”Qin Yu could not help but curse.

Yan Jinyao was not angry. He said with a faint smile, “I will naturally know if I have tried.”

“If I can fuse your bloodline with Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline, I wonder what kind of power will burst out.”

Qin Yu shouted, “F * ck you! Yan Jinyao! Are you a parasite? Do you have to rely on the bloodline of others to cultivate? !”

Yan Jinyao sneered, “In order to obtain strength, these are not worth mentioning.”

“Qin Yu, I have to admit that the current me is indeed no match for you, but so what?”

“80% of the bloodline in my body has awakened! If I can obtain your bloodline, then no one in the world will be my match!”

Qin Yu’s heart thumped!

He remembered what old Mister Yan had said before!

He said that his father had once told Old Mister Yan that Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were a match made in heaven.

If the two of them were together, they would be able to display even more powerful strength!

Did this mean the fusion of blood?

“Qin Yu, let’s wait and see.”Yan Jinyao grinned, then turned around and walked out.

Yan Jinyao’s guess had a very high possibility.

The reason why the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had first arrested Yan Ruoxue was not because of the bloodline in her body.

It was to prevent Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue from staying together, or to engage in dual cultivation.

Because that would bring a great increase in Qin Yu’s strength.

But they never expected that the bloodline in Yan Ruoxue’s body was even more powerful!

This also caused the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to change their target!

However, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association never thought that these two bloodlines could fuse and be injected into another person’s body!

...

In Gu Xinghe’s office, Yan Jinyao expressed his intention.

“You mean... to absorb Qin Yu’s Bloodline?”Gu Xinghe frowned slightly.

Yan Jinyao said faintly, “80% of the bloodline in my body has awakened. I’m willing to be the subject of this experiment.”

Gu Xinghe was silent for a moment, then he nodded and said, “Okay, I promise you.”

“Thank you, Young Master Gu.”Yan Jinyao slightly bowed and said.
