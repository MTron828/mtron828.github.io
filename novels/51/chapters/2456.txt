2457 Are You Willing to Go with Me?

In the vast Holy Region, the most elite demon race had to hide in the Azure Rock Forest to survive.

…

“Qin Yu, I have something to tell you.”

Ji Yue walked to Qin Yu’s side. She seemed to be a little hesitant.

“What’s wrong? Just say it.”

Qin Yu said with a smile. Ji Yue could be said to be his benefactor. Even if he had to go through fire and water, he would still make the attempt.

“I would like you to save the remaining people of my family in purgatory. You know I’ve set up many tricks in the Moon Listening Pavilion. Many people in my family hid their identities and sneaked into purgatory to collect intelligence. When they came back, many had thought that the disaster wouldn’t spread so fast, so they stayed in purgatory. Now, the disaster of the monster is spreading widely and causing chaos. Many people from my family have died, and the rest are living in fear of death.”

Ji Yue said with a bitter smile. It was tremendously dangerous in purgatory now.

Furthermore, many of the ancestors of the Holy Region had already returned. The human race’s forces in the purgatory were currently very weak. Even with Qin Yu’s current strength, he would probably be in danger if he went over.

“I’ll go! Sister Ji Yue, I must save the people of your family. I have inherited the treasures of the Jee family, so I naturally have to repay your kindness.”

Qin Yu agreed without thinking.

“Now, in every place in purgatory that the monster race occupies, the women are made the reproduction tools, the children as meat, and the men and dead bodies for worshipping the Path of Heaven of the monster race. It can no longer be described merely as gruesome.”

Ji Yue’s expression was very ugly. She had listened to the message transmitted from her people.

The voice recorded made her unable to sleep for several nights. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“The monster race is the existence of evildoer. There is no such thing as human emotions in the monster world. Almost all the monster race is extremely vicious, heartless, and merciless. They harm the common people and are the embodiment of darkness and evil. This dark power, including the negative emotions of all living beings, is the source of all the power of the Path of Heaven of the monster race. It is also the foundation for the survival of the monster race. In times of chaos, the strength of the monster race can be best unleashed.”

Elder Guai seemed to have a deep understanding of the monster realm and immediately said to everyone.

“The monster race I ate last time was disgusting! It’s disgusting just thinking about it!”

Jue Wu’s face was pale as she retched.

“Who told you to eat it? That thing looks so scary, and only you would eat it.”

Chang Mang said from the side, and Jue Wu directly kicked him to the side.

“One more thing. It’s about the Xuanyuan Sword that Qin Yu mentioned earlier. This sword is the inheritance of the Jee family ancestor. We still have a chance if we go and retrieve my ancestor’s Xuanyuan Swordword now. Otherwise, once the monster race builds the foundation, it’ll probably be very difficult to steal it again.”

Moreover, she was worried if purgatory was truly occupied by the purgatory…

And if the mystic realm of the ancestors of the Jee family was discovered, wouldn’t the ancestor’s inheritance fall into the hands of the monster race? This was something she did not want to see.

Qin Yu nodded. When he encountered the Xuanyuan Sword previously, he felt that he could not resist the sword’s might at all.

Now that his cultivation had advanced significantly, he might be able to keep the Xuanyuan Sword.

“And now is a good opportunity. Many humans have gathered in the Holy Region and are going to purgatory to hunt the monster race. If we go together, the risk will be much lower.”

Ji Yue’s intelligence work had always been excellent. Even when she came to the Holy Region, she could still receive information from the pawn in purgatory.

Even Qin Yu did not know how she received the information.

“There are still some human cultivators who have strategic mindsets. Hundreds of billions of living beings in purgatory are the human race. If the monster race slaughters them all and offers them as sacrifices, I’m afraid the strength of this monster race will increase to an unknown cultivation realm.”

Qin Yu said with a frown. He had fought with the monster race in purgatory before.

This monster race did not seem to have a good understanding of the Path of Heaven, but they had special sacrificial techniques.

As long as they sacrificed humans, they could be baptized of the power of the Path of Heaven and continuously strengthen themselves.

In other words, as long as the monster race continued slaughtering, their overall strength would continue to strengthen.

After returning to the Holy Region, it had been a while since he had seen the monster race. He wondered how powerful the strength of the monster race was in purgatory now.

“Since we’ve confirmed, let’s go to purgatory directly. However, I need to settle some things before that.”

Xiao Hai’s shadow suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s mind. If he saw the human race in such a miserable state, he would also risk his life to save them…

Qin Yu’s body moved, and he dashed toward Thunder Courtyard.

In the sound of thunder, Qin Yu turned into a thunder dragon and suddenly appeared in Thunder Courtyard.

Lei Qingye, Lei Huan, Lei Li, Hua Qianjie, Hua Qianje, Hua Zhikong, and the other Supreme Elders arrived almost instantly after sensing the internal qi.

At this moment, all of them had solemn expressions on their faces. It was the opposite of their expressions from the past few days.

Even Lei Qingye did not expect Qin Yu to have obtained the Judge’s Brush, a divine artifact of the ghost realm during his trip there.

Moreover, after absorbing the terrifying soul power through the Northern Underworld Demonic Technique, Qin Yu’s current strength had already steadily reached the Tribulation Third Level Soul Sinking.

Coupled with his strange cultivation method and the Judge’s Brush, it was good enough to pose a threat to him.

The most terrifying thing was the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor, who had restored a part of his soul.

Hua Zhikong shouted.

“Shut up if you don’t want to die.”

Qin Yu glanced at him coldly. Evil Eye had already appeared in his hand.

The dark brown power of the soul instantly covered him, and in an instant, Hua Zhikong’s body turned cold.

He felt being watched by the Grim Reaper. If he moved, he might attract Qin Yu’s shocking attack.

He gulped a few times, but in the end, he dared not utter a sound.

Seeing Lei Qingye retreating, he dared not bet on Qin Yu’s words.

“That’s right, little sissy.”

Chang Mang sneered from the side and said. Chang Mang would never show him a friendly expression.

“Qin Yu, you came to Thunder Yard just to humiliate people?”

Hua Qianjie said sternly.

“Old witch, don’t talk nonsense. If I didn’t have Immortal Emperor Yao’s corpse in hand, I’m afraid our ending would be many times more miserable than humiliating others, right?”

Qin Yu laughed coldly.

“I’m not here to look for you people today. You’re not worthy.”

He turned around and walked toward Lei Xin and Flower Granny.

“Dean, Flower Granny, I plan to head toward purgatory. Before I do that, I would like to ask if you are willing to go with me.”

“Qin Yu, we’ll follow you. Thundet Courtyard has completely changed. It’s fine if we don’t stay here.”
