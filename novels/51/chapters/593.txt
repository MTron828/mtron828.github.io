Chapter 594: Fighting He Teng Again! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s punch contained anger, and its power was beyond imagination!

More importantly, the distance between the two was too close, so Yan Guiyi couldn’t retaliate at all!

He could only quickly put his arms in front of him to take Qin Yu’s punch head-on.

“Boom!”

This punch landed squarely on Yan Guiyi’s arm.

In an instant, Yan Guiyi’s body shot backward, and his arms went numb from the impact!

If not for the protection of the Black Gold Stone, this punch would have broken his bones! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If you dare to say another word, I will kill you!” Qin Yu had a ferocious look in his eyes, and his aggressive look made people look extremely terrified!

Yan Guiyi’s expression was a bit cold. He shook his arm and sneered. “So anxious? Hehe, it’s just useless rage.”

“Say that again!” Qin Yu took a step forward and a terrifying internal qi burst out!

Yan Guiyi’s expression turned cold and he said coldly, “I think you’re courting death!”

Just as the conflict between the two sides was about to break out, He Teng suddenly walked over slowly.

He stood between the two and faced Qin Yu. He said with a nonchalant smile, “Mr. Qin, Captain Yan is our leader and our senior. You should at least have some respect.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “He Teng, what are you trying to say?”

He Teng wasn’t angry. He put his hands behind his back and said slowly, “Not only do you not know respect, but you even fought with them. This is the reason why they look down on us, do you understand?”

“You really talk a lot of bullsh * t.” Qin Yu walked toward He Teng step by step.

“You two b*stards are in cahoots with each other. Why are you talking big to me about here? Are you even worthy?” Qin Yu shouted angrily.

He Teng sneered and said, “To be honest, the last time I was defeated by Mr. Qin, I learned from my mistakes and cultivated day and night.”

“Now, my hard work yielded some results. I also want to see Mr. Qin’s skills.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “Good, I let you escape last time. This time, I want to see who can save you!”

After saying that, Qin Yu shouted, then the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist instantly appeared and headed straight for He Teng!

He Teng didn’t want to be outdone. His hands quickly slid in front of him, and a black internal force condensed!

“Puff!”

Qin Yu’s fist smashed into this ball of energy, but the expected head-on collision didn’t happen.

The ball of energy was like a ball of cotton. The moment Qin Yu touched it, the force on his body disappeared.

This feeling was like throwing a punch with enough force, but hitting a pile of cotton.

He Teng sneered. “It seems that Mr. Qin doesn’t know what it means to use softness to overcome hardness.”

Qin Yu looked at He Teng coldly, narrowed his eyes and said, “He Teng, your body seems extremely weak. All your abilities are from that guy in your body, right?”

He Teng put his hands behind his back and didn’t comment.

“You can only rely on his enormous inner strength as support. In other words, you are just a puppet now.” Qin Yu sneered.

“You are just a walking corpse, so how can you be called the number one person in the Central Plains?”

He Teng sneered and said, “History will only remember the victor, no matter what the means used.”

After saying this, He Teng turned to look at Yan Guiyi and cupped his hands slightly,. “Captain Yan, I request to spar with Qin Yu.”

Yan Guiyi had been waiting for this moment, and He Teng was obviously deliberately speaking to him.

“Sure,” Yan Guiyi said.

“Young people should spar more.”

He Teng sneered.

“If I beat him, I will be the fourth person on the list, right?” He Teng asked.

“Of course.” Yan Guiyi nodded.

“Okay!” He Teng immediately looked at Qin Yu coldly.

His entire body was wrapped in a black energy. This energy looked like a fluid that was slowly circulating around his body.

“Go to h*ll. Instead of challenging the disciples of the Jingdu aristocratic families, you’re fighting with our own people. Let me deal with you!”

At this moment, Chang Mang suddenly took a step forward and stood beside Qin Yu.

His entire body was burning with energy. His fierce body was completely red.

It had to be said that Chang Mang was extremely reckless.

He Teng glanced at Chang Mang and said coldly, “You aren’t worthy to fight with me. Furthermore, who is one of you?! Scram!”

Chang Mang said furiously, “I’m unwilling to treat you as one of us too. Take a punch from me first!”

Chang Mang’s moves weren’t flashy at all. He only had a tough and fierce body.

However, the result of this punch was the same as Qin Yu’s. The fist sank into the energy and all the power was instantly dissipated.

“What the h*ll is this? If you’re a man, fight me head-on!” Chang Mang shouted.

He Teng said coldly, “You really don’t know your place. I don’t mind killing you first!”

“Why would I be afraid of a sissy like you?!” Chang Mang shouted.

Qin Yu pulled Chang Mang to the side and shook his head. “This is between me and him. Chang Mang, you can leave first.”

Chang Mang frowned and snorted, “Alright, when you’re done fighting, I’ll deal with him!”

Qin Yu ignored Chang Mang. He knew very well that He Teng wasn’t as simple as he seemed.

His strength wasn’t weaker than that of the young masters present.

“Qin Yu, I’ve been looking forward to this day for a long time.” He Teng said with narrowed eyes.

“Everyone says that the chaotic body is invincible among those of the same level. I’d like to experience it today.”

Before he finished his sentence, He Teng took the initiative to attack.

With a wave of his hand, the black energy surrounding his body shot out explosively!

This energy turned invisible. It seemed to be balls of soft inner strength, but when it came in front of Qin Yu, it turned into a fierce fist!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent and immediately clenched his fist to defend against the attack!

However, the moment Qin Yu’s fist smashed over, this energy turned into a soft shape and wrapped around Qin Yu’s fist!

“Boom!”

Before Qin Yu could react, another ball of energy turned hard and smashed into Qin Yu’s side!

The huge impact instantly sent Qin Yu flying!

“This is the combination of hardness and softness. It is specially used to restrain people who have strong bodies, like you,” He Teng said with a sinister tone.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground. He looked at He Teng coldly and frowned slightly.

The inner strength surrounding He Teng’s body was extremely strange. Every punch that Qin Yu threw seemed to have hit nothing. This kind of feeling made him very uncomfortable.

“Qin Yu, it’s time for payback!” He Teng snorted coldly. That ball of energy once again shot toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. The flames all over his body were burning. His body was wrapped in spiritual fire. Purple and gold merged into one, and a powerful pressure rushed toward him!

“What combination of hardness and softness? As long as one is strong enough, one can shatter all things!” Qin Yu roared angrily.
