“You know about the Prajna Ruler?” Qin Yu shook the ruler in his hand and said in surprise.

Han Xiu frowned.

The Martial Saint Weapon was the most important item. It was extremely important even to the well-known families.

Usually, the Martial Saint Weapon would not be taken out of the house. It would not be used unless it was at a critical moment!

However, no one had expected Qin Yu to have a Martial Saint Weapon.

“Come, let me see that broken crossbow of yours,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Ao Zhan’s expression was extremely ugly. He did not even have the intention to attack now.

“Isn’t that crossbow some Earth Rank weapon? Why are you hiding it?” Qin Yu asked cheekily.

Ao Zhan said coldly, “The Prajna ruler belongs to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, you...”

“It’s mine now,” Qin Yu grabbed the Prajna ruler in his hand and casually waved it forward!

A terrifying Martial Saint’s internal qi instantly rippled out!

Ao Zhan’s expression changed drastically! He quickly activated the crossbow and it exploded with light to fight against it!

However, in front of the Martial Saint Weapon, his crossbow could not even withstand a single blow!

All the light disappeared in an instant, and the Martial Saint’s internal qi swept out!

“Ptui!”

After suffering this blow, Ao Zhan immediately spat out a mouthful of blood!

A huge cut appeared on his waist and abdomen, and blood was flowing out from it!

Qin Yu sneered, “It seems that your broken crossbow has failed.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ao Zhan stood up from the ground with difficulty.

He took a deep breath and said coldly, “Qin Yu, you’re lucky today. If you’re capable, you can always carry the Prajna ruler with you!”

After saying this, Ao Zhan ran away!

He was extremely fast and disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu played with the Prajna ruler and turned to look at Han Xiu.

“Mr. Han, what about you?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

As an important figure on par with Yan Sihai, Han Xiu naturally would not show any signs of panic.

Han Xiu spread his hands and said, “Since you have the Martial Saint Weapon, I certainly don’t want to have bad luck. However, a Martial Saint Weapon doesn’t mean anything.”

Qin Yu laughed coldly and said, “This Martial Saint Weapon can at least guarantee that you won’t dare to attack us rashly.”

Han Xiu sneered and said, “Qin Yu, only your own strength is real.”

After saying this, Han Xiu was ready to leave.

After taking two steps, Han Xiu suddenly stopped.

“Oh yes, I forgot to remind you. The Martial Saint Weapon has a limitation in its usage. Each time it is used, the Martial Saint’s internal qi will weaken a little until it completely disappears,” Han Xiu said indifferently.

“The Prajna ruler in your hand... I remember it can be used at most three times, right? Oh, no, you just used it once. So there are only be two times left.”

After he finished speaking, Han Xiu turned around and left the Taoism Theory Library.

However, Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change drastically. He was so anxious that he bared his teeth.

“D*mn it, why didn’t you say so earlier!” Qin Yu’s face was filled with regrets!

If he had known it earlier, he would not have initiated that attack just now!

“No wonder they don’t use the Martial Saint Weapon so easily. It turns out that every time they use it, the number of usages reduces,” Qin Yu muttered.

This meant that to get rid of him, Jingdu Martial Arts Association had indeed invested a lot.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and immediately left the Taoism Theory Library.

...

This matter caused a huge uproar immediately!

A hole was torn in the ugly face of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

In an instant, the video spread and even penetrated the lives of ordinary people.

Qu Xie’s words swept through the entire martial arts world!

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association actually controls all the resources!”

“On the surface, they help us, the ordinary martial artists, but in reality, they’re just trying to swindle and control our resources!”

“This isn’t fair. Just how many resources that belong to us has Jingdu Martial Arts Association blocked?!”

Looking at the news on the internet, even the higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association couldn’t sit still.

“Something’s going to happen,” a cold voice came from the dark.

“We have to handle this properly, or we will be in big trouble!”

“Qu Xie is dead, someone has to replace him.”

“Qu Xie exposed the existence of the eight of us. It’s time for us to disappear for a while.”

The eight figures slowly sank into the darkness.

At the same time, Xia Hang received the appointment letter and became the new president!

Not only did Xia hang become the new president, he even had higher authority than Qu Xie!

There was no other reason other than the eight higher-ups wanted to stay out of the limelight for the time being.

As the matter continued to ferment, this mess naturally fell on Xia Hang’s head.

“The higher-ups will definitely question this matter,” Xia Hang’s face was full of worry.

The higher-ups did not give specific instruction on this matter. This had also made Xia Hang not know how to deal with it.

At this moment, the phone in Xia Hang’s office rang.

As soon as the call was connected, he heard an extremely dignified voice.

“Your Jingdu Martial Arts Association is really bold! Who gave you the right to forcefully seal off the resources?!”

Xia Hang did not dare to say anything. He could only smile and apologize continuously.

“The documents submitted are all fake!” the Grand Secretary on the other end flew into a rage!

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association had to report their work to the higher-ups every year, including a summary of the current resources.

But all these years, the resources reported by the association were all fake.

What they reported was less than 1% of the true situation.

“This was all done by Qu Xie. I... I just took office,” Xia Hang said with a bitter smile.

The Grand Secretary on the other end said coldly, “Don’t play dumb with me! Xia Hang, I don’t believe that you don’t know anything!”

Xia Hang opened his mouth and was instantly speechless.

The Grand Secretary was silent for a moment and then continued, “And also, where are those higher-ups? I want to see them.”

This instantly put Xia Hang in a difficult position.

As he did not know where these higher-ups were.

“I really don’t know. I also don’t know whether Qu Xie’s words are true or not,” Xia Hang smiled bitterly.

The Grand Secretary did not intend to make things difficult for Xia Hang.

He was silent for a moment and said, “You’d better come up with a concrete plan. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Xia Hang quickly agreed, “Don’t worry, I will certainly do it!”

After hanging up the phone, Xia Hang could not help but lean on the sofa and let out a long sigh.

On the other end.

After Qin Yu returned to the Green Moon Villa, he planned to bring Xiao Yu to the Immortal Slaying Sect.

The coffin was unearthed in the Immortal Slaying Sect. Xiao Yu might be able to obtain something.

But to enter the Immortal Slaying Sect, he would probably need an array platform. The current Qin Yu didn’t have any information on the array platform.

Even if he were to search through the inherited memories, it would probably take some time.

.....

That evening.

Qin Yu strolled around the Green Moon Villa as usual.

Su Qian’s voice suddenly sounded from behind Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, we have found what you have wanted us to investigate,” Su Qian said indifferently.
