Perhaps this assertion itself was erroneous. They might be just like them, all living beings, and not creatures without consciousness.

Qin Yu and the others looked at the two sorrowful individuals, tacitly refraining from disturbing them. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After a long while, the two gradually eased their emotions.

One of them lifted their head and addressed Qin Yu and the others, the outsiders. As he spoke, his emotions had already recovered their calmness.

If not for their reddened eyes, it would have been impossible to discern that they had just experienced a life-and -death parting.

“Everyone, the three of us are inner sect disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley. Now that the shackles of the Ancient Demon Land have slowly been loosened, it is no longer safe for you to stay here. You can accompany us to the Demon Sealing Valley. Of course, the decision is yours; you are free to go or stay.” Jing Xin spoke softly.

“My friend Jing Xin, could you clarify a matter regarding the Demon Sealing Valley?”

Qin Yu hesitated briefly before posing the question.

“Please, go ahead.”

Jing Xin nodded.

“I encountered an inner sect disciple of the Demon Sealing Valley before. According to him, he is Gu Yi’s disciple, but his hostility towards us outsiders was quite evident. His actions were aimed at killing us directly. I wonder what stance the Demon Sealing Valley currently holds?”

Qin Yu inquired directly, feeling that the two individuals before him were credible.

Had it not been for them, escaping from the Evil Buddha would not have been so straightforward.

“You guys survived after encountering Gu Tian? He has killed many outsiders,” Ling’er asked in disbelief.

Ling’er asked incredulously.

Jing Xin extended her hand, interrupting Ling’er. After a moment’s hesitation, she softly explained to everyone.

“The Demon Sealing Valley and the Ancient Demon Land were originally established as a balance by the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. The Ancient Demon Land has sealed many heinous demons, but Holy Lord Chen Shuang

chose not to kill them outright. Instead, he suppressed and sealed them. We, on the other hand, oversee the forces in this region.”

“Why such an approach? With the power of the Holy Lord, wouldn’t it be feasible to simply eliminate or expel them from the Saint Kingdom?” Qin Yu questioned with skepticism.

“I surmise it’s for the sake of equilibrium. The Ancient Demon Land poses a significant threat to our Demon Sealing Valley, yet it serves as a test of patience for all disciples. The disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley dare not relax, tirelessly cultivating since its inception. Within the sect, many have emerged as cultivators comparable to the ancient demons.” Jing Xin turned calmly to look at the Ancient Demon Realm.

“Until the demise of the Holy Lord and the shattering of the Heart of Saint Kingdom into eighty-one fragments, numerous ancient demons in this region had sensed it and were already restless. However, owing to the formidable might of the Demon Sealing Valley, major upheaval was temporarily averted. However, with the appearance of the holder of the Heart of Saint Kingdom, a rift has emerged.”

“The holder of the Heart of Saint Kingdom Heart at the True Consciousness Realm can already harness the power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom. The Heart of Saint Kingdom in their possession is imbued with the Saint Power of this Ancient Demon Realm. As the Saint Power is siphoned from the Saint Kingdom, the order of the ancient demons suppressed by Saint Chen Shuang begins to crumble, and numerous formidable ancient demons begin to emerge. The Evil Buddha today is one of them. Perhaps as time passes, even more formidable ancient demons may appear.”

Jing Xin explained the general changes that had occurred before their arrival, giving the outsiders a preliminary understanding.

“Why are there still conflicting voices within the Demon Sealing Valley? Can you provide detailed answers to our questions?” Qin Yu asked in a serious tone. They had reached a crossroads.

Staying in the Ancient Demon Realm might prove challenging with the awakening of the ancient demons.

However, if they chose to go to the Demon Sealing Valley, they needed a clear understanding of the various factions and pathways. Otherwise, entering blindly might lead to trouble.

“The collapse of order in this realm doesn’t just affect the Demon Sealing Valley, it affects us all. The establishment of the Demon Sealing Valley was meant to supervise the Ancient Demon Land. As the sect’s power increased, many began to entertain other thoughts after the demise of Holy Lord Chen Shuang.”

“Some elders wish to disrupt the established order, seizing the opportunity to break free from its constraints. They envision a future where we are not bound to this region but can roam freely within the Saint Kingdom. Representing this faction is Elder Gu Yi. On the other hand, Elder Xin Yue, Senior Sister Zi Xia’s master, leads a faction that sees the complete collapse of order as a catastrophe rather than an opportunity.”

With this explanation, the outsiders present had a rough understanding of the situation.

“Elder Gu Yi seeks to control the outsiders. To the natives, the power wielded by outsiders, particularly those with the Heart of Saint Kingdom, represents a

significant threat. If outsiders can fully grasp the rules and reach the True Consciousness Realm, their ability to mobilize the power of the Saint Kingdom may even pose a threat to those in the Dao Consciousness Realm. Therefore, their stance is to eliminate outsiders or bring them under sect control.”

Qin Yu nodded, reflecting on his own experiences and the power of the Saint Kingdom he possessed.

“On the other hand, there is a faction that aims to protect the outsiders. When the Ancient Demon Land is fully unsealed, they intend to use the power of the Saint Kingdom to suppress the demons and maintain balance. Both factions have their followers. Therefore, you can either stay here or accompany me to meet with Elder Xin Yue.”

After Jing Xin’s thorough explanation, they were left to make their own decisions.

“One more thing, there’s internal unrest within the sect. It’s uncertain which faction holds sway, and there may be internal crises,” Jing Xin added.

“I’ll join you.” Qin Yu decided after some hesitation, to head to the Demon Sealing Valley.

With the Heart of Saint Kingdom in his possession, he couldn’t remain hidden for long. Staying in the Ancient Demon Land was no longer feasible. Despite objections from some within the Demon Sealing Valley, Xin Yue’s faction seemed trustworthy for now, having just saved their lives.

There were a total of seven outsiders present, with one person expressing unwillingness to follow.

The other six people indicated that they followed Jing Xin back to the Demon

Sealing Valley..
