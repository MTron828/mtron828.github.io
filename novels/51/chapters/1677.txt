Chapter 1678: Chapter 1,678, Dragon Eyes in hand 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A drop of dragon blood flowed from the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth into his stomach.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted! It was as if a ball of flame had exploded in his body!

His body was extremely hot, and his skin had turned red. Pain and swelling could be felt everywhere!

“Bang!”

Soon, Qin Yu fell to the ground. He kept struggling on the ground, and he felt as if his entire body was about to explode!

“It’s... It’s so uncomfortable...”Qin Yu clenched his teeth. He hurriedly circulated the meridian circulation technique to dilute this drop of dragon blood.

The blood boiled in his body and fused into every part of his body.

It had to be said that just a drop of dragon blood was far more than all the spirit herbs!

This feeling was unbearable for Qin Yu. He kept kicking his legs on the ground, and his eyeballs almost popped out!

“Don’t fucking die. If you die, I’ll be trapped here too!”Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s voice came from the spatial magic artifact.

How Could Qin Yu care about him? He tried his best to circulate the meridian circulation technique, but even so, the powerful force of that drop of blood was still about to Burst Qin Yu!

He lay on the ground like this, and the pain filled his body.

Fortunately, under the circulation of the meridian circulation technique of Qin Yu, the power of this drop of blood began to dissipate and was slowly absorbed.

After an unknown amount of time, the pain gradually disappeared, but the absorption of the blood was less than one-tenth.

Qin Yu climbed up from the ground, wiped the sweat on his forehead, and said in a trembling voice, “What a terrifying power... is this dragon’s blood?”

Heavenly Blood Rainbow in the spatial magic artifact heaved a sigh of relief. He said in a deep voice, “This divine dragon has been dead for countless years. His blood is probably about the same as a drop of holy blood now.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Just a drop of blood almost took his life. God knows how strong this divine dragon was when he was alive.

The gap between realms was hard to cross. Qin Yu immediately felt inferior.

Compared to such a great cultivator, the current him was probably not even an ant.

He let out a long sigh and did not continue thinking. Instead, he sat cross-legged and slowly digested the trace of blood.

Although this blood almost killed Qin Yu, it had to be said that this blood brought about a powerful effect.

Very soon, Qin Yu’s depleted energy slowly recovered. The powerful medicinal effect of the drop of blood slowly circulated throughout his body, and the effect it brought far surpassed that of Panaceas.

“I’ll probably need ten days to half a month to completely absorb this drop of blood,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He didn’t know what level this drop of blood could bring him to, so he had some faint anticipation in his heart.

Ten whole days.

Qin Yu sat there cross-legged, slowly absorbing the blood.

After ten days, the blood was finally completely absorbed.

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes. He felt the power in his body and said in a low voice, “The peak of the early-stage mighty figure is just a step away from the middle-stage of the mighty figure.”

It was only a drop of blood! And Qin Yu had several jars of this blood!

More importantly, there was a huge eyeball hanging on it!

If he swallowed this eyeball, who knew what kind of effect it would bring!

“Forget it. Let’s take this eyeball first,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

This trip to the east continent had indeed brought him great gains. As long as he took this eyeball away, he did not need to worry about his future cultivation.

Therefore, Qin Yu stood up and continued to dig out that eyeball.

In the outside world, Zhuo Jing no longer held any hope.

He leaned against the wall of the dragon burial cave with a look of despair on his face.

Those insects outside were not something he could resist, not even with the Silver Spring in hand.

“Back then, my father came to a place like this.”Zhuo Jing could not help but sigh.

It was really rare to be able to walk out of here.

“It has already been twenty days. I’m Afraid Qin Yu is already dead.”Zhuo Jing laughed and cried.

Under the strong corpse Qi of the dormitory, Zhuo Jing also appeared somewhat weak.

His spiritual power had been completely suppressed, and he was almost no different from an ordinary person.

Time passed by minute by second, and in the blink of an eye, another ten days had passed.

And the eyeball on the dragon corpse had finally been seized by Qin Yu.

The eyeball was like a small mountain, and it suddenly smashed into the ground, creating a big hole in the ground.

Qin Yu hurriedly ran to the entrance of the hole and took out the dragon eye.

“Damn, I finally got it,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He raised his head to look at the other eyeball, and he couldn’t help but feel a little greedy.

“It would be great if I could take that eye away as well,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Other than that eye, Qin Yu also looked at the huge hole in the eye socket.

“If I crawl into the eye socket, wouldn’t I be able to get its internal organs? That is where the essence of the body is located,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, after thinking about it, Qin Yu finally gave up.

The power of the Divine Dragon was unfathomable. If he crawled into its body, he would probably be crushed into meat paste.

‘it shouldn’t be a problem for me to take this dragon eye and leave this place,’Qin Yu thought to himself. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He didn’t put this eye into the spatial magic artifact. Instead, he dragged it with one hand to intimidate those true saints.

Apart from that, Qin Yu also hung the venerable fifth mountain above his head.

After making all the preparations, Qin Yu walked out step by step.

“I hope Zhuo Jing is fine,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He raised the huge dragon eye with one hand and walked toward the entrance of the Dragon Burial Cave. The scene was quite comical.

Soon, the ten true saints blocked Qin Yu’s path once again.

The powerful pressure from their bodies still made Qin Yu not dare to underestimate them.

Qin Yu swallowed his saliva. He gripped the dragon eyes tightly and braced himself to walk forward.

The ten true saints were standing on the path Qin Yu had to pass through.

When Qin Yu walked past them, his heart was almost in his throat. He was afraid that he would accidentally anger this true saint.

With their abilities, Qin Yu probably didn’t have the ability to fight back.

Fortunately, there was no danger. When Qin Yu passed by them, they didn’t do anything. They just looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Not bad.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief.

After he left these ten true saints, he immediately closed his eyes. He was afraid that he would accidentally meet that Black Shadow again.

Just like that, Qin Yu walked step by step towards the cave entrance slowly.

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu finally walked out of this dangerous situation.

As soon as he came out of the sight of the Dragon Corpse, Qin Yu Ran and arrived at the entrance of the cave in a few flashes.

At this time, Zhuo Jing was already extremely weak. He leaned against the wall. The double blow to his heart and body made him look like he was on the verge of death.

“Zhuo Jing, are you okay?”Qin Yu walked quickly to Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing rubbed his eyes and said with a wry smile, “I’m hallucinating again, damn it.”
