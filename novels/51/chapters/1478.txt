Chapter 1479: Chapter 1,479, refining a nascent soul pill

The alchemist King’s expression changed slightly, and his expression was extremely unnatural.

“Let me tell you, I don’t care about anything that you care about, so you don’t have to treat me as an enemy. Of course, you don’t have the qualifications either,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Although the alchemist King was angry, he didn’t dare to compete with Qin Yu.

After a moment, his mood gradually calmed down.

“Okay, I got it.”The Alchemy King took a deep breath and said.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I won’t stay here for long. After I finish refining the pill I want, I’ll naturally leave.”

“Okay, I Won’t disturb you during this period of time,”said the Alchemy King.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and waved his hand. “Okay, you can go back to your work.”

After saying this, Qin Yu began to search for herbs on the top floor.

It had to be said that the resources here were indeed too rich. Compared to Earth, this place was simply a Holy Land.

Herbs that were tens of thousands of years old could be seen everywhere. Qin Yu wanted even more.

If one was careful, one could even see 100,000-year-old herbs.

“This is just a small southern state. How rich are the resources in the central state...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Compared to this, the cultivation environment on Earth was really too harsh.

It was really not easy to produce geniuses like Yan Jinyao and Chang Mang.

“Alright, it’s time for me to refine the nascent soul pill,”Qin Yu said in his heart.

He picked a batch of herbs and then found a room to seal the room before starting to refine the pill.

On the other side.

After King Lian returned to his room, his heart could not calm down for a long time.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. The rosary beads in his hand were crushed by him!

As the Pill King of the Southern Region, the Top Alchemist of the Medicine Sacred Hall was revered everywhere? When had he ever been so angry?

“Damn it!”

The Pill King raised his hand and slapped the table. The table immediately shattered!

“This bastard actually dares to humiliate me! I will definitely not let him off! !”Although the Alchemy King wanted to roar loudly, he was afraid that Qin Yu would hear him. For a moment, he felt extremely uncomfortable.

He thought for a moment before finally laughing coldly.

“Qin Yu, just you wait. I will definitely make you pay the price!”The Alchemy King said coldly.

He immediately sent people to the Heavenly Cloud sect, intending to inform the first elder of this matter.

Now, the first elder was still in charge of the Heavenly Cloud sect. The hatred between him and Qin Yu even exceeded the hatred between Qin Yu and the Heavenly Cloud sect!

“When the first elder finds out about your location, he will definitely send people to kill you!”The alchemy king laughed coldly.

“So what if you have talent? If you don’t know how to restrain yourself, the final result will only be a skeleton!”

...

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t know what the Pill King was thinking. At this moment, all of his attention was focused on pill refinement.

At night, Qin Yu successfully refined the first batch of pills. Inside the Dragon Cauldron, seven nascent soul pills lay quietly.

Qin Yu took out the nascent soul pill from the Dragon Cauldron and examined it carefully.

Different herbs would produce different pills.

The Pill in Qin Yu’s hand looked fuller than the nascent soul pill made from ten-thousand-year-old herbs, and the spiritual Qi was more abundant.

Not only that, the number of pills made from the same amount of herbs was also completely different.

Compared to the ten-thousand-year-old herbs, this batch of herbs had three times more.

“With this, I can shorten the time,”Qin Yu thought.

His goal was to refine forty nascent soul pills, but because of this batch of herbs, Qin Yu planned to refine a hundred nascent soul pills in case he didn’t have enough.

Then, Qin Yu got up and went to fetch another batch of herbs and began to refine pills.

Time passed day by day, and in the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

During these three days, Qin Yu never left the pill room.

And during these three days, there were alchemists in the Medicine Sacred Hall who wanted to visit Qin Yu, but they were unable to open the door.

For a time, Qin Yu’s pill room’s door was in an endless stream.

The pill refining King, who was already furious, saw this scene and his face turned ashen.

“We must let this Qin Yu Die!”The pill refining king said through gritted teeth.

Especially su song, he actually took the initiative to run to Qin Yu’s pill room’s door and became a guard.

As long as anyone came, he would persuade them to leave.

Even if Qin Yu didn’t have the mood to fight for the title of Alchemy King, his alchemy skills had long spread among the crowd.

In the long run, his title of Alchemy King might not live up to its name.

“You won’t be able to be arrogant for long.”The Alchemy King hid in the dark and watched coldly from the side.

...

Heavenly Cloud sect.

The people sent by the alchemist King had already told the first elder the truth about Qin Yu’s whereabouts.

This made the first elder extremely furious. He asked Mo Hong to keep an eye on him, but in the end, Qin Yu had already left. That Idiot was still keeping an eye on him nearby.

“This idiot!”The first elder couldn’t help but curse.

After that, he once again found the white-clothed Daoist.

“Immediately head to the medicine Saint Capital with the eighteen gods,”the first elder said coldly.

The white-robed Daoist said with slight surprise, “Why do you want to go to the medicine Saint Capital?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Qin Yu is there,”said the first elder with a dark face.

The white-robed Daoist said with a faint smile, “Why bother the eighteen gods? I can kill him alone!”

However, the first elder shook his head and said, “Absolutely not. I must ensure that Qin Yu dies there.”

When the white-robed Daoist saw this.., he could not help but stand up and say, “First Elder, the war at the border is getting more and more serious. A large number of people from the northern lands have poured into the border. They seem to want to take down thirty stars by force. Why Don’t you let the eighteen gods go to the northern border?”

When this matter was brought up, first elder felt an extreme headache.

He did not want to care about the northern lands at all. As long as it did not affect the heavenly cloud sect, he did not care about how many people he loved to death.

However, the sect master had given the order, so he could only follow it.

“I have already sent someone else to the border,”said the first elder.

“Moreover, there is still that idiot Xiao Hai to support us. There is no need to worry.”

The white-clothed Daoist saw through the first elder’s thoughts.

In the first Elder’s eyes, Qin Yu was much more important than the northern lands.

“Alright.”The white-clothed Daoist did not say anything else. “I will set off now.”

“Mm.”First Elder nodded slightly. Then, he summoned the eighteen gods and secretly went to the alchemist Sage’s capital to kill Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu was completely unaware that he was still refining the pill at a leisurely pace.

It was unknown whether it was the improvement in his technique or the increase in his primordial spirit’s power, but Qin Yu’s speed of refining the pill was getting faster and faster.

He originally thought that he would need ten days. However, in just six days, Qin Yu successfully refined a hundred nascent soul pills.

“A normal person needs at most ten pills. I have prepared a hundred pills. It should be enough,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Therefore, he pushed open the door and prepared to leave.

As soon as he stepped out, he saw Su Song standing there.

“Mr. Qin.”Su Song cupped his hands to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “What are you doing here?”
