Chapter 1495: Chapter 1,495, Myriad Heavens Flower VS three yuan sacred palm! 1

Both of them raised their hands with killing techniques, as if they wanted to kill each other.

These two people didn’t seem like they were challenging each other, instead, they seemed like two life and death enemies!

Hua Zi’s strength was indeed not to be underestimated. Even if Qin Yu had recovered his spiritual power, it was almost impossible to kill him in a short period of time!

“Boom!”

Hua Zi raised his hand and pierced through the heaven and earth. A force of ten thousand tons poured toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did the same. He waved his golden fist, and the absolute beginning sacred fist was shining brilliantly!

The two of them did not Dodge. They used their desperate strength to meet each other!

Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but sneer!

The same technique, Qin Yu’s physical body was definitely not something that hua zi could compare to!

Hua Zi seemed to have gone mad. He did not Dodge or Dodge. He swore to kill Qin Yu here and now!

“Boom!”

The two of them did not Dodge. Their fists smashed into each other’s chest.

Seeing the terrifying explosion, their bodies were pushed back hundreds of meters!

Qin Yu’s body was shining with golden light. Hua Zi’s punch actually failed to penetrate Qin Yu’s physical body!

On the other hand, Hua Zi’s body was covered with a layer of dark golden light. He was actually not injured at all!

“Hahaha! If I didn’t have any tricks up my sleeves, I wouldn’t have gone all out against you!”Hua Zi’s voice shook the heavens and earth, causing a buzzing sound to ring out.

The surrounding crowd turned pale with fright. They had witnessed this battle with their own eyes. A casual trace of might was already unbearable, but these two actually managed to withstand it!

“So this is the current Heaven’s favorite!”Someone exclaimed.

“Don’t forget, Qin Yu is only in the nascent soul realm, while Hua Zi is enough to step into the Almighty realm for many years!”

“If that’s the case, Qin Yu is still better.”

“That’s right, but don’t forget, only when a genius grows up can he be called a genius! If he dies here today, then he’ll just be a speck of dust.”

Qin Yu looked at Hua Zi coldly, his body emitting a bone-piercing chill.

This hua zi indeed had a secret treasure hidden on him. Yong Ji had probably put in a lot of effort on him.

“Qin Yu, I’ll definitely kill you today!”Hua Zi shouted loudly, his internal Qi actually continued to climb!

However, Qin Yu was not afraid at all. Instead, he sneered and said, “Bring out your true ability. Don’t waste any more time.”

Hua Zi laughed out loud and said, “The same goes for you! Qin Yu, if you don’t bring out your true ability, I’m afraid you won’t have a Chance!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I don’t need to waste too much energy to kill you. Come On!”

“You’re courting death!”These words undoubtedly infuriated hua zi. After a loud shout, he charged at Qin Yu again.

This time, Hua Zi’s strength became even stronger. Even Qin Yu was somewhat in a difficult position to deal with him.

“Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch!”

Qin Yu let out an explosive shout, and the power that penetrated through the ages poured out!

Hua Zi laughed loudly and said, “This is the technique that I’ve been waiting for. Come!”

His two hands moved, and a brilliant light condensed between his hands. It was spotless and extremely holy.

However, under this holy power, it contained an extremely terrifying power!

This power seemed to have borrowed the power of Heaven and earth. It was incomparably terrifying!

“Boom!”

Another collision. Qin Yu still did not gain any benefits. His body was pierced through, and large amounts of blood flowed out!

“It seems that Qin Yu’s physical body can’t hold on any longer.”Someone commented.

“That’s right. No matter how strong his physical body is, he isn’t invincible.”

Everyone had their own opinions, but Jue Wu didn’t say a word.

Her small hand touched her chin, thinking about something.

“What is this kid doing? This is definitely not his true strength,”Jue Wu thought to herself.

The battle continued. In the blink of an eye, hundreds of rounds had passed between the two sides.

Hua Zi seemed to be getting stronger as the battle went on, but he didn’t escape with any benefits.

After so many battles, both of their bodies were stained with blood.

This battle was destined to be extremely intense.

“Buzz!”

Hua Zi activated both of his hands, and a brilliant sword of light closed in!

Qin Yu used the line word formula and shot out several meters. He stood at a high place and looked coldly at Hua Zi.

Hua Zi was somewhat annoyed. He had an extremely strong feeling in his heart. It seemed that Qin Yu was going to be defeated every time, but every time, he was not able to hurt him.

“Die!”Hua Zi roared. He put his hands together and then slammed his palm forward!

Everyone was shocked when they saw this technique!

Because this technique was Yongji’s trump card, the three elements holy palm!

“What! Hua Zi is forcing out his trump card just like that!”

“Impossible, he clearly has the upper hand all the time!”

Jue Wu’s face also showed a hint of shock.

Could it be that this hua zi had some other trump card that he did not know about?

If that was the case, it would be really troublesome!

The power of the three elements holy palm was endless as it rolled over.

It was like waves of the ocean that were continuously stacking up.

At this moment, the void shattered and the earth collapsed. Wherever it passed, everything turned into nothingness!

Qin Yu also did not think that hua zi would be so impatient. He looked at Hua Zi coldly as his mind quickly skipped over the heavenly flower of all creation that Jue Wu had taught him!

He narrowed his eyes slightly, and his body shook violently. An extremely bright light instantly appeared behind him, as if he was facing the holy sun!

Under the cover of this light, Qin Yu looked like an angel that had descended, incomparably holy!

“It’s the heavenly flower of all creation! Jue Wu’s spell!”

“The three elements holy palm against the heavenly flower of all creation. This is equivalent to the fight between Yongji and Jue Wu!”

“The two of them are no longer representing themselves!”

As the three elements holy palm overlapped, the light behind Qin Yu became even more dazzling!

Just as Jue Wu said, the spiritual power required for this spell was too dense, and even Qin Yu could not hold on for a moment.

“Ah!”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and the myriad heavens flower exploded behind him!

In an instant, the sky and earth were enveloped by this radiance. Even the people hidden in the void could not stop vomiting blood!

Under the myriad heaven flower, everything in the surroundings suffered a blow.

This spell was an indiscriminate attack. Anyone who was in the midst of this radiance would be injured!

Fortunately, Jue Wu had acted to protect everyone. Otherwise, the surrounding people would have died here!

The layers of the three Yuan holy palm pressed toward Qin Yu!

Meanwhile, the heavenly flower of all creation had already enveloped hua zi.

The powerful force instantly shattered hua zi’s black-gold radiance and pressed toward his body!

“Ah! ! !”

At this moment, Hua Zi’s body started to bleed!

Under the cover of the heavenly flower of all creation, his blood seemed to be evaporated, and even his bones began to collapse!

Such a scene could not help but cause people to turn pale with fright!

“Is this the sky flower of all creation? !”

“With Huazi’s ability, it doesn’t seem to be able to withstand it at all!”

“Rumor has it that once the sky flower of all creation is unleashed, not a single blade of grass will grow within a radius of ten Li! Moreover, it is an indiscriminate attack, it can be said to be a godly skill!”
