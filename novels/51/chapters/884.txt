Chapter 885: Chapter 885, lurking in the dark 

The two of them were like an ordinary couple, lying on the bed, feeling each other’s warmth and this moment of warmth.

Qin Yu gently held Yan Ruoxue’s hand, and a strange emotion burst out of their eyes.

The two of them were getting closer and closer, so close that they could feel each other’s breathing.

At this moment, there was a sudden movement from outside.

Qin Yu looked out of the window somewhat irritably.

He saw that the people who came were the group of young masters from Jingdu.

Zhuang Teng, Chu Heng, Yao Meng, and the others were almost all here.

“F * ck, why are they here?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

Wasn’t this ruining his good thing! !

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue quickly went downstairs. As soon as they went downstairs, Zhuang Teng and the others walked over excitedly.

“Miss Yan, we’ve finally met you,”Zhuang Teng said politely.

Yan Ruoxue also responded politely and returned a generous smile.

“Miss Yan, we were especially heartbroken about what happened last time. Fortunately, Qin Yu is here,”Chu Heng also said with a smile.

“We heard that you were back, so we hurried over.”

Everyone was unusually enthusiastic, but Qin Yu felt a headache.

“Oh right, Brother Qin, Miss Yan, I specially held a dinner party at home today,”Zhuang Teng said while patting his chest.

“This dinner party is to welcome Miss Yan!”

Yan ruoxue frowned slightly and shook her head with a smile. “There’s no need for that, right?”

“Aiya, Miss Yan, you can’t not give me face. I specially prepared this for you!”Zhuang Teng said excitedly.

Yan Ruoxue did not respond. Instead, she looked at Qin Yu, as if waiting for Qin Yu’s answer.

Qin Yu sighed slightly and said, “Alright, we’ll go in a while.”

“Okay!”Zhuang Teng said excitedly.

“Then we’ll go back first. See You Tonight!”

Zhuang Teng led everyone and left. Only Yao Meng stayed.

It could be seen that the relationship between Yao Meng and Yan Ruoxue was really good. The two of them were talking and laughing, and the atmosphere was quite harmonious.

“Zhuang Teng will definitely invite all kinds of people to the banquet,”Yao Meng said with a bitter smile.

Yan ruoxue smiled and said, “Zhuang Teng has always been like this. This is also good.”

Yao Meng said jokingly, “We are not like you. We are quite popular no matter which world we are in.”

Although these words were a joke, it was also the truth.

Like Yao Meng and the others, their assets were not considered top-notch. It was just that their martial arts strength was relatively strong.

But it was different for Yan Ruoxue. Back then, the Yan family could be said to be able to call the wind and summon the rain in Jingdu. Regardless of their various professions, they had to give some face.

Then, Yao Meng changed the topic to Qin Yu.

“Ruoxue, I can’t help but admire your foresight,”Yao Meng said with a smile.

“At that time, I was still wondering how much courage it took for you to find a poor kid with no background. Now it seems that I’m still short-sighted. The foresight of the Yan family is indeed worthy of its reputation.”

Yan ruoxue smiled and said, “Do you think I like Qin Yu just because I have good taste?”

Yao Meng’s eyes were a little surprised, as if she was waiting for Yan Ruoxue’s answer.

Yan ruoxue smiled and said, “I do think Qin Yu will definitely achieve something, but that’s not why I like him. It’s more because I like him.”

“Even if he really has no achievements, I’m willing to support him.”

Yao Meng opened her mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.

To Yao Meng and the others, their lives had already become a profit field.

It was as if everything in this world was marked with a price, even for people.

“Qin Yu is crazy enough... For You.”Yao Meng smiled and shook her head.

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue’s eyes could not help but look at Qin Yu.

The way she looked at Qin Yu seemed to have a different color.

“Okay, Ruoxue, let’s see you tonight.”Yao Meng didn’t stay any longer. She said goodbye to Yan Ruoxue and left.

After she left, Yan Ruoxue came to Qin Yu’s side.

“The food we prepared seems to be useless.”Yan ruoxue spread her hands.

Qin Yu also whispered, “Yeah, I was planning to cook a bowl of noodles for you.”

“Well... speaking of which, I really want to eat the noodles you cooked. That should be the first time you cooked for me, right?”Yan ruoxue blinked her eyes and said.

Qin Yu also smiled and said, “I also want to eat the fish you cooked. Tomorrow, we’ll be at home by Ourselves Tomorrow, and we won’t see anyone!”

Speaking up to this point, Yan Ruoxue said with some worry, “You also know that many people are interested in my bloodline. Aren’t you afraid that... Something will happen at tonight’s Banquet?”

Qin Yu put down the remote control in his hand and sneered, “I just want to find these people who are hiding in the dark!”

Yan Ruoxue opened her mouth. She wanted to say something, but after a moment, she laughed again.

“That’s right. You are no longer the Qin Yu that everyone can bully.”Yan Ruoxue gently patted Qin Yu’s forehead.

Qin Yu could not help but be a little absent-minded.

He did not know how long this kind of warm little life would last.

...

At night.

Qin Yu changed into a suit and attended the banquet with Yan Ruoxue. They arrived at the Zhuang family.

Yan Ruoxue’s appearance was like a beautiful scenery. No matter where she went, she would attract enough attention.

For a moment, many people from the Zhuang family came forward and greeted Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue also responded politely.

“Ruoxue, come and sit here.”Yao Meng waved at Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu followed Yan Ruoxue and walked to the sofa.

The entire venue was packed with people, and the people attending this banquet were all important figures in Jingdu.

Qin Yu sat at the side and didn’t say anything. He released his spiritual sense and covered the entire venue.

One, two, three... Six powerful auras were lurking in the dark, and the internal Qi of the people in the banquet hall was very strong.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “Someone is really targeting us.”

“What’s Wrong?”Yan ruoxue noticed Qin Yu’s abnormality.

Qin Yu smiled and shook his head. “Nothing.”

At this moment, a young man came over with a wine glass in his hand.

He walked directly to Yan Ruoxue’s side and said with a smile, “Miss Yan, long time no see.”

Yan ruoxue nodded slightly as a greeting to him. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The young man continued, “Miss Yan, are you interested in dancing with me?”

Yan ruoxue glanced at him and said mercilessly, “I’m not interested. Even if I dance, I Won’t dance with you.”

When the young man heard this, he couldn’t help but put the wine glass in his hand on the table.

“Yan Ruoxue, do you still think that you are the Miss of the Yan Family? Do you still think that old Mister Yan is protecting you?”The young man said with a faint smile.

Yan Ruoxue’s expression didn’t change much. She just smiled and said, “Does this have anything to do with whether you dance or not? Even if I have nothing, I still don’t Fancy You.”
