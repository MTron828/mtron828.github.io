Anger flashed across Su Bo’s face.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Why? Because I’m a big shot in the Chuzhou region! Because my status is higher than yours!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “In the eyes of people like you, a high status means superiority, but in my eyes, everyone is the same, regardless of whether their status is high or low.”

“As for you, from the way you speak, I already know that you aren’t worthy of me welcoming you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The corner of Su Bo’s mouth twitched slightly. It was obvious that he was somewhat annoyed by Qin Yu’s words.

“Young man, you must be mindful of what you say.” Su Bo raised his hand and pressed it on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu immediately felt a force on his shoulder, and the corner of Su Bo’s mouth curled up into a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His arm shook, and a huge force was immediately returned to him!

Su Bo’s wrist was immediately hurt from the force, and he even took a few steps back!

“You’re also a martial artist.” Su Bo’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Su Yan, who was beside him, hurriedly warned him, “Cousin, he’s quite good. Don’t fight with him!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Su Bo shook his wrist and sneered. “How good can an ordinary person’s skills be? Moreover, if I want to deal of him, there are many ways!”

“Since I have a mission, I won’t lower myself to your level for the time being. After I’m done with this matter, see how I’ll deal with you!” Su Bo pointed at Qin Yu’s nose and said.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with him at all. The reason he stayed here was only for Old Mister Su.

After that, Su Bo went to the sofa and sat down. The members of the Su family surrounded him and kept flattering him.

“Xiao Bo, who is your senior officer coming to Jiangcheng this time? Can you tell us about it?” Su Wen asked while pouring tea.

Su Bo said indifferently, “I don’t know. Moreover, this is a secret. We can’t reveal it at will.”

“Xiao Bo, there’s nothing you can’t tell your family.” Su Wu said from the side.

Hearing this, Su Bo immediately smiled nonchalantly and said, “There’s no harm in telling you guys.”

When they heard this, everyone immediately pricked up their ears with excitement.

Su Bo slowly said, “According to our Commander, this person knows Chief Wu. However, there’s a small misunderstanding between the two of them. Otherwise, the person who came to invite him would be Chief Wu.”

When everyone heard this, they immediately asked in surprise, “Who actually needs Chief Wu to personally invite him?”

Su Bo smiled nonchalantly and said, “In short, he is a very outstanding person. Although I have never seen him before, to be able to get so many important people to invite him, he is definitely an extraordinary person.”

At this point, Su Bo paused for a moment and continued, “Of course, our Deputy Chief’s subordinates are also the elites of the Military District.”

He was obviously boasting about his position in the military district.

“Of course. I knew that Xiao Bo would have a bright future!” Su Wen quickly shouted.

“Gee, Xiao Bo finally came back, so we have to celebrate tonight!” Sun Yumei said obsequiously.

The rest of the relatives also shouted, “That’s right. We will all get drunk tonight!”

Just when the atmosphere was getting merry, Qin Yu suddenly said coldly, “The old man’s body isn’t cold yet, and he is still lying on the bed. As his descendants, it’s bad enough that you guys aren’t sad at all, but you guys are actually celebrating instead. You guys are really f * cking inhuman.”

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, everyone in the living room immediately became quiet, and the atmosphere became a little tense.

“Tsk tsk, you are an outsider, so why are you pretending to be filial?”

“That’s right. If you were really so filial, why didn’t you come back earlier?”

“It’s already good enough that we didn’t ask you to get out!”

Su Bo snorted coldly and said, “A son-in-law who married into the family really thinks highly of himself. Don’t you know what it means to live in the present?”

Qin Yu glanced at Su Bo and said, “Filial piety is the first priority. You don’t even know filial piety, yet you actually dare to say that you’re an elite. I think you’re not far from being fired.”

“Hehe, sorry, but I’m steadily rising in the military district. The higher-ups praise me a lot, and might promote me at any time.” Su Bo smiled nonchalantly.

“But you, a piece of trash who married into the family, have been kicked out. I think it’ll be hard for you to even survive.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and didn’t say anything else.

Soon, the car of the crematorium arrived at the door of the house.

Qin Yu personally carried Old Mister Su’s body into the car and accompanied everyone to the cremation and burial.

It took the entire day, and when he was done, the sky was already dark.

“We’re finally done. Let’s go back and drink!” Su Wen said with a smile.

“We have to get drunk tonight and have a good time!” Su Wu and Su Wen put their arms around each other’s shoulders, and the atmosphere was quite harmonious.

Qin Yu glanced at them and felt that it wasn’t worth it for Old Mister Su to care so much about them.

Maybe Old Mister Su already expected this scene, so he told him not to harm the Su family, Qin Yu thought to himself.

What a pity.

Then, Qin Yu drove to Dragon Paradise.

At this moment, two people stood at the gate of Dragon Paradise.

These two people were tall and had a dignified bearing. They had bold features and gave off a gallant air.

“Commander Guo, how come I’ve never heard of Qin Yu? Why did Commander Wu insist on recruiting him into the war zone?” One of the slightly younger people said.

The man called Commander Guo smiled and said, “Xiao Yu, don’t make wild guesses. Chief Wu naturally has his own plans.”

Xiao Yu said somewhat defiantly, “He actually let the Deputy Chief personally come to recruit him. I’ve never seen something so high profile. Anyway, I don’t think it’s worth it.”

Commander Guo was silent for a moment, then said, “Not long ago, Liu Shihui of the Liu family was defeated by him.”

“He’s just a kid from a rich family. I can do it too,” Xiao Yu said defiantly.

Officer Guo was instantly speechless.

It was true. Although he was quite capable, it wasn’t worth Chuzhou spending so much manpower to invite him.

“Officer Guo, you actually don’t know much about it, right? I suspect that there’s something shady going on,” Xiao Yu muttered.

Officer Guo immediately reprimanded, “Don’t talk nonsense!”

Xiao Yu said defiantly, “It’s true. I’ve heard rumors that Qin Yu has treated Commander Wu’s illness before. There’s even some aristocratic family backing him! Maybe he’s a rich kid who wants to go to the military district to squander money”
