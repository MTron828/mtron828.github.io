Chapter 1512: Chapter 1512, the figure in the mausoleum

When Qu Zhu heard this, he couldn’t help but gently stroke his chin.

“To tell you the truth, I’ve read many legends. Many of the legendary figures seem to come from that ancient star,”qu Zhu said.

“Didn’t the Heavenly Cloud sect send people there not long ago? They wanted to find some secret treasure.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. I followed them here. Unfortunately, they didn’t find anything.”

Only Qin Yu knew where the secret treasure on Earth was. He had seen it with his own eyes in the underwater world.

Unfortunately, no one knew about this secret except for Qin Yu.

It was even more impossible to get those secret treasures.

Qin Yu did not continue this topic. He looked at Qu Zhu and said, “Big Brother Qu Zhu, what are your plans next?”

Qu Zhu stretched lazily and said, “Don’t count on me. I’m used to traveling the four seas. If I meet people from the northern lands, I might take action. But don’t think about anything else.”

Qin Yu laughed bitterly. Of course, he knew.

The reason why he gathered these people was not just to resist the northern lands. It also included Qin Yu’s selfishness.

Only when everyone resisted could the northern lands point the spearhead precisely at the heavenly cloud sect, so that the heavenly cloud sect would not be pressured to negotiate with the northern lands.

Qu Zhu did not stay any longer and left Mount Hua Ning the next day.

......

As for Zhuo Jing and the others, they were full of hot blood, so they naturally supported Qin Yu.

“Brother Qin, there’s still no news about what I promised you before.”

Before he left, Zhuo Jing pulled Qin Yu to the side and said.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s fine. There’s no rush.”

Zhuo jing grunted and said, “As long as there’s news, I’ll definitely tell you at the first moment.”

“Okay.”

After that, Zhuo Jing and the others left Mount Hua Ning.

Qin Yu also planned to search for this dark energy grave according to the address provided by sister Lin.

Even the treasures unearthed there were filled with dark energy. It was definitely an excellent place for cultivation.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the sky. At this moment, dark clouds covered the earth and the Sun couldn’t be seen.

“Hopefully, I’ll be able to step into the mighty realm as soon as possible,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Every time he broke through to the mighty realm, Qin Yu would have to expend a lot of effort. This time was probably no exception.

After saying goodbye to Wen Dawen er, Qin Yu set off on his journey.

...

The northern lands was a land of snow and wind.

It was bone-piercing cold here, and the spiritual Qi was thin.

At this moment, a few people were walking in the snow.

“Our actions didn’t force the Heavenly Cloud sect to retreat,”one of them said.

“That’s right. Not only did they not retreat, but they also sent a large number of people to the border. Many of us have already died at their hands.”

The leader was a tall man. He swept his gaze across the crowd and then said in a deep voice, “I already know about this news.”

“Sir, Yongji has sent news. Rumor has it that he has someone hiding in the heavenly cloud sect.”

“Oh? Yongji? is he the Yongji of the South Province’s three extremes?”

“That’s right. According to Yongji’s news, the current heavenly cloud sect is almost empty. Almost all the elites have been sent to the major cities as well as the northern border. I think that we might be able to take this opportunity to directly uproot the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”

In the snowstorm, that “Lord”suddenly stopped, and the others followed closely behind.

“Lord, the Heavenly Cloud sect will sooner or later become an obstacle for us. This opportunity is very rare for us.”

That Lord was silent for a moment, and then said coldly, “Who can guarantee that this isn’t a conspiracy of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? And who can guarantee that Yongji isn’t trying to use us?”

After this Lord’s Reminder, everyone also came back to their senses.

Yong Ji had been thinking about the heavenly cloud sect for a long time, but he himself hadn’t made a move yet. No one knew if there was a trap or not.

“Since it’s Yong Ji’s suggestion, then let him take the lead to attack the Heavenly Cloud sect. If there’s no trap, we’ll naturally send people,”this Lord said.

The person next to him frowned and said, “But... we’ve already played Yongji once. This time, he might not agree.”

“HMPH, that’s his business. He can choose to refuse. We don’t need him.”

After saying this, the Lord continued walking forward.

...

Yongji city.

A black-robed man stood in front of Yongji.

He conveyed the lord’s meaning to Yongji.

After listening to him, Yongji’s face turned ashen.

He slapped the table and said coldly, “Do you northern lands think I’m an idiot? Why, do you have to force me to go to the northern border as well?”

The black-robed man was not worried. He smiled faintly and said, “I believe that Mister Yongji won’t do that. Moreover, we’re doing this for your sake.”

“If the northern lands makes a move first and you take the opportunity to make a move, wouldn’t that mean that you will bear the blame? At that time, everyone will think that it is you who has joined hands with the northern lands.”

Yong Ji frowned slightly, as if he felt that it was somewhat reasonable.

He sat down again and did not speak for a long time.

“Why? What is Mister Yong Ji worried about? The elites of the heavenly cloud sect have long left. What do you have to be afraid of?”The black-robed man laughed.

Yongji opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he did not say anything.

“Alright, I’ll agree to it.”After hesitating for a long time, Yongji finally agreed.

He had coveted the heavenly cloud sect for too long. To him, this might be his only chance.

The sect master had gone into seclusion and the elites had already left. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

“Alright, I’ll wait for Mr. Yongji’s good news.”The black-robed man cupped his hands.

“Don’t worry. Our people from the North will soon make a move to assist Mr. Yongji. At that time, the South region will only think that our north is taking advantage of the situation and won’t suspect Mr. Yongji.”

After saying this, the black-robed man turned around and left.

Yongji thought for a long time and immediately stood up. “After waiting for so long, it’s time to make a move... Heavenly Cloud sect, it’s time for all of you to disappear!”

...

Qin Yu held the map in his hand and spent several days before he finally arrived near his destination.

This place was barren. From thousands of stars away, he could feel the cold and dark energy.

Qin Yu sniffed and then grinned. “Sister Lin is still reliable...”

Hence, he sped up and rushed towards his destination. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As he got closer to his destination, the dark energy became stronger.

When Qin Yu reached the vicinity, the intense dark energy made Qin Yu shudder!

“Good Place, it really is a good place!”

Qin Yu activated his desolate God’s eye and looked in front of him.

This seemed to be a mausoleum. Unfortunately, this mausoleum had already been excavated and there did not seem to be anything left.

“HM?”

At this moment, Qin Yu discovered a sneaky figure.

He was lying in the mausoleum, as if he was pulling something.
