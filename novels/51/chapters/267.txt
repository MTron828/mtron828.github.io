After hearing Jiang Gu’s address, Cheng Cai couldn’t help but feel stunned.

These two people were actually together?

And this senior actually addressed him as Mr. Qin?

“Humph, he must be a rich young master,” Cheng Cai said coldly.

He tried to sense Qin Yu’s internal qi and found that Qin Yu’s strength was so low that it could be ignored.

This confirmed Cheng Cai’s thoughts.

“Why don’t we go together? We have already arranged a car,” Tang Ling said while pointing at an off-road vehicle not far away.

It was indeed a waste of time to look for a car since the matter was urgent.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Okay, thank you.”

Therefore, they got into the car together and rushed to the ancient tower.

Along the way, Cheng Cai was chattering non-stop.

“Rumor has it that this ancient tower is mysterious and unpredictable. It even sells a top-grade pill. As long as you take it, you can increase your strength,” Cheng Cai said.

Tang Ling also nodded and said, “Oh right, and you can even make a wish. Many people say that making a wish here is especially effective!”

“Mr. Qin, they’re talking about the Earth Fiend Valley,” Jiang Gu said softly at the side.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at Jiang Gu with puzzlement and said, “The Earth Fiend Valley actually sells pills?”

“That’s right, and the industry is extremely huge,” Jiang Gu said in a sullen voice.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and said, “I don’t believe what they say. The Earth Fiend Valley is an evil sect, and its purpose is definitely not as simple as it seems.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jiang Gu sighed and said, “Yes, the Earth Fiend Valley is definitely not in it for money, but no one knows what it is for.”

The car sped along and soon arrived at an ancient tower.

Although the ancient tower was called a “tower” , it was actually a small hill. However, on the hill, there was something similar to a signal tower.

On the signal tower hung a golden plaque, which recorded all kinds of mysterious history.

Qin Yu sized up the signal tower and couldn’t help but frown.

“Don’t you feel that this signal tower is a bit strange?” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

Jiang Gu hurriedly nodded and said, “This signal tower seems to be emitting a strong spiritual power, making people unconsciously yearn for it.”

“The power of faith?” Qin Yu whispered.

Rumor had it that the power of faith was the purest power, and its effect was beyond imagination.

“I don’t have time to think too much about it. Let’s go,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Then, they rushed toward the small hill.

A long stone ladder was built under the hill.

The stone ladder was at least dozens of meters long, and two martial artists stood on both sides of the stone ladder.

Qin Yu glanced at them and found that the two martial artists had reached the Inner Strength Master Hands realm.

“Are there any conditions to enter this place?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“Of course, if you want to enter this place, you must be devout. Otherwise, you don’t have the qualifications to enter,” Tang Ling explained with a smile.

Cheng Cai glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Many rich kids want to use money to cheat their way through, but unfortunately, they haven’t succeeded.”

He was obviously referring to Qin Yu. In Cheng Cai’s opinion, Qin Yu was a useless young master from a rich family.

And Jiang Gu was Qin Yu’s bodyguard.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He strode forward and arrived at the entrance in the blink of an eye.

The two people at the entrance quickly reached out to stop Qin Yu.

In front of them was a stone tablet.

The stone tablet was emitting a dark energy.

If one wanted to enter, they had to go through the inspection of the stone tablet.

“I’ll go first!” Cheng Cai quickly walked to the front of the stone tablet.

He raised his hand and placed it on the stone tablet. A moment later, a rumbling sound was emitted from the stone tablet.

Although the sound wasn’t loud, one could clearly see that the stone tablet was shaking.

“You can enter now,” the two guards said nonchalantly.

Cheng Cai was overjoyed when he heard this!

However, he wasn’t in a hurry to enter. Instead, he waited for Tang Ling and the others.

Just as Tang Ling was about to check, the guard said, “Women are exempt from inspection. You can enter directly.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

This Earth Fiend Valley was indeed not in it for money.

“Sir, hurry up. I’ll wait for you,” Cheng Cai shouted from the side.

Jiang Gu frowned slightly. He looked at Qin Yu, as if waiting for Qin Yu’s order.

“I’ll go first.” Qin Yu walked to the front of the stone tablet. He raised his hand and placed it on the stone tablet.

The moment he touched it, Qin Yu immediately felt a lightning-like internal qi pass through his body!

In just an instant, Qin Yu’s divine sense became dimmer!

“It absorbs the power of divine sense?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, the two guards walked forward and said coldly, “You aren’t devout enough, so you can’t enter.”

“Haha, I knew it!” Cheng Cai laughed crazily at the side.

“How would a playboy like you know martial arts, and how would you know what faith is?” Cheng Cai sneered.

Qin Yu ignored him. He glanced at the guard and said coldly, “How can I be devout enough?”

The guard said impatiently, “Don’t ask me. I don’t know. In short, everything depends on the stone tablet.”

“Don’t waste our time. Wait for us outside,” Cheng Cai shouted from the side.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He looked at the two guards and said, “If I can’t pass the test of this stone tablet, I can’t go in, right?”

“That’s right.” The two guards nodded.

“What if I have to go in?” Qin Yu’s tone became more and more unfriendly.

“Can you not waste our time?” Cheng Cai, who was beside him, shouted impatiently.

“If you don’t pass the recognition of this stone tablet, you can’t go through the Heaven Gate, understand?” Cheng Cai said with some displeasure.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Heaven Gate?”

Cheng Cai sneered and said, “It seems that you don’t know much about the ancient tower.”

“This ancient tower is a heaven-blessed land. It is a gift from God! If you aren’t accepted, you will be isolated by the Heaven Gate! No matter how capable you are, you have to stand outside obediently!” Cheng Cai snorted coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at the entrance.

As expected, there was a transparent barrier at the entrance.

As long as one didn’t pass the stone tablet’s approval, they would be isolated outside.

And after passing the stone tablet’s approval, they would be able to pass through this barrier.

“You haven’t received the approval of the heavens. Do you understand?” Cheng Cai shouted.

Tang Ling also whispered at the side, “I think I’ve heard of it before. Don’t make things difficult for them. They can’t control the Heaven Gate either...”

Qin Yu laughed coldly.

He looked at the gate and the stone tablet at the side, then smiled.

“If I break this so-called Heaven Gate, won’t I be able to enter?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

Hearing this, Cheng Cai immediately burst into laughter.

“You’re really funny. You want to break the Heaven Gate? You’re drunk, right? Even an Inner Strength Grandmaster can’t do it, understand?” Cheng Cai sneered.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He clenched his fist and rays of golden light wrapped around it.
