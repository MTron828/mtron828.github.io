Chapter 1080: Chapter 1,080, Yan Jinyao’s letter of challenge 

Although he had said this, Qin Yu still felt somewhat heavy in his heart.

After entering the martial saint realm, the improvement of one’s strength would be relatively easier. At least, it would not be as difficult as when one had entered the martial saint realm.

However, Qin Yu was still worried. He was worried that the strength of those eight higher-ups would exceed his expectations.

“I need to settle this matter as soon as possible. I also need to enter that picture and give it a try.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He took out a pen and paper and listed out the enemies that might exist in the dark.

If he didn’t destroy them, Qin Yu wouldn’t dare to disappear for a month.

Now that he had connections and a sect, he had more worries.

“What are you thinking about?”The Mustache Man muttered.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It’s nothing.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The mustache man muttered, “We agreed before that I would lend you the purple-gold Calabash and you would let me search for treasures in the second Mystic Realm.”

“Go on, go on.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

He hadn’t found any Babe anyway. If he gave it to the moustache man, there might be some unexpected gains.

The moustache man was instantly overjoyed. He said with a smile, “Then I won’t waste your time. Bye Bye!”

After saying this, the moustache man ran out excitedly.

Qin Yu sat in the main hall and silently looked at the names on the paper:

Yan Jinyao, he teng, and the Hong Yi sect.

Other than them, who knew how many other people were secretly thinking about Qin Yu.

However, it would not be so easy to find the enemies in the dark.

“Yan Jinyao... Let’s start with you first.”A trace of viciousness flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

This battle must tell the world that if they provoked me, I, Qin Yu, will not show mercy!

In the outside world, the battle between Yan Jinyao and Qin Yu had already caused a commotion.

The two of them were the top existences of the younger generation, so they would naturally attract the attention of everyone.

In the Han family, Han Wei looked at the news that was spreading like wildfire and felt extremely uncomfortable in his heart.

Ever since he lost to Qin Yu, he had been unable to recover and was still stuck at the early-stage of the Martial Marquis realm.

Not to mention fighting with the disciples of the various aristocratic families, even ordinary martial artists had already left him far behind.

“Yan Jinyao, you will definitely follow in my footsteps!”Han Wei’s eyes were filled with a hint of madness.

Han Wei’s state of mind had already changed unknowingly.

From the beginning, he had hoped that Qin Yu would be killed, but now, he gradually hoped that more people would be defeated by Qin Yu and become like him, unable to recover!

“Why? Are you giving up just like that?”

At this moment, a voice sounded.

He turned around and saw that it was his uncle, Han Xiu.

“Uncle.”Han Wei hurriedly stood up.

Han Xiu sat opposite Han Wei and said in a deep voice, “In this life, I’m afraid that it will be different from all the previous eras. Martial artists will receive unprecedented authority and status.”

All along, martial artists had only been a small group, a group that could not see the light of day.

But in this life, it was very likely that the current situation would change.

It had to be said that there was a reason why Han Xiu was valued. His vision far exceeded that of ordinary people.

“Every era has a different strategic vision. The reason why our group can become a top aristocratic family is because we have seized the opportunity,”Han Xiu said indifferently.

“In this life, martial arts might become the next point of contention. Whoever can seize this opportunity will become a new aristocratic family.”

“So, you have to pull yourself together.”

Han Wei looked at Han Xiu in a daze and then smiled bitterly, “But... but no matter how hard I Try, my strength can’t advance even a little bit...”

“That’s because of your Inner Demon,”Han Xiu said coldly.

“If you want to get rid of the Inner Demon, you have to face it head-on!”

“Face it head-on?”Han Wei was stunned.

“Are you asking me to face Qin yu head-on? I’m afraid that the current me can’t even survive one move...”

Han Xiu looked at Han Wei coldly and said, “The current you is indeed no match for him, but that doesn’t mean that you have to give up!”

“A man is born between heaven and earth, how can he be depressed all day long!”

“Han Wei, let me tell you. As a man, you can die standing up and never kneel down to Live!”

These few words made Han Wei’s blood boil.

He stood up and said, “If I fight with Qin Yu, Will I Die?”

“Yes, and maybe not,”Han Xiu said coldly.

“Don’t expect others to save you. You have to rely on yourself.”

“You’d rather be beheaded by Qin Yu than live under his shadow all day long. Otherwise, you’re not worthy of being called a man!”

Han Wei clenched his teeth. He took a deep breath and nodded. “Uncle, I understand!”

...

Time flew by.

There was only one day left until the battle between Qin Yu and Yan Jinyao.

That morning, Yan Jinyao sent someone to deliver a letter of challenge to Qin Yu.

On the cover of the letter of challenge was a shocking word, “Death.”.

After flipping through the letter of challenge, the time and place were written on it.

The location was set at the Qingdi Park on the side of Jingdu.

Although this place was called a park, it was actually desolate and uninhabited. It had long since been abandoned.

It was said that when this park was being built back then, strange things kept happening. Later, it was urgently stopped and construction stopped.

“Qingdi Park...”Qin Yu caressed the letter of challenge and couldn’t help but laugh coldly.

“This Qingdi Park seems to be one of the undeveloped resources recorded by the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was a good opportunity to take a look at it. Perhaps there would be some unexpected gains.

Qin Yu burned the letter of challenge in his hand, then stood up and said in a low voice, “Yan Jinyao, I have been waiting for this day for a long time.”

“You are the owner of Yan Ruoxue’s blood. Tomorrow, I will behead you in front of the world!”
