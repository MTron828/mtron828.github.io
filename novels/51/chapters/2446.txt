Chapter 2447: Three Saint Weapons

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Then he pointed at the scarecrow’s glabella, and the Ox-Head immediately let out a tremendous scream.

His body was like a kite with a broken string, smashing into an enormous

palace, and flattening instantly.

He struggled several times but could not stand up.

“The power of the sorcerer tribe!”

The expressions of Horse Face and the three ghost messengers wandering day and night changed drastically.

Although the power of the sorcerer tribe was extremely close to the Path of Heaven of the ghost realm, it was still the power of the Path of Heaven of the human race. Being able to activate its power was enough to show how powerful Qin Yu’s soul was.

“No, the sword in his hand is strange. That scarecrow seems to be the Saint Weapon of the sorcerer tribe.”

Horse Face’s expression changed drastically. He took a step forward and sensed an immense threat from Evil Eye.

The saber in Horse Face’s hand flickered with a cold light and landed directly on the ground.

In an instant, a surge of power pierced through the heavens and earth triggered by the saber.

With Horse-Face’s feet as the center, the surrounding 1,000 meters became a land of ice and snow.

The souls of tens of tens of thousands of living beings of the ghost realm turned into popsicles and fell to the ground stiffly.

Countless ice flowers appeared on Qin Yu’s hair, eyebrows, and even the fine hairs on his body.

The Ice of Soul!

It was not just the surface of his body. Countless ice flowers appeared on the periphery of his soul and even his origin. Even his thoughts seemed to have slowed down.

In the legends of the netherworld on Earth, Horse-Face was also known as Horse-head Rakshasa or Horse-head Ghost. Horse-Face had the head of a horse and the body of a human. He was the partnering ghost messenger with Ox-Head. In Iron City of the netherworld in the human world, copper snakes and iron dogs run amok, tigers and wolves howl wildly, and the eyes of the Ox-Head and Horse-Faced were roasted red by the fire. They held knives and spears in their hands and drove the ghosts into the city, pushing them into the endless hell.

Ox-Head and Horse-Face were responsible for bringing the evil spirits to the netherworld, reporting their crimes to Yama. These evil spirits were all villains who ran amok in the world. Therefore, Ox-Head and Horse-Face were also the nemesis of evil spirits.

The Ox-Head used the red-hot iron trident to pick up the ghosts one by one and threw them into the raging fire to receive the punishment of being burned. Horse-Face’s saber was bone-chilling and was used to cut off the struggling limbs of the ghost.

Looking at it now, the legend of the netherworld was most likely true.

Fortunately, he had already dealt with Ox-Head with lightning speed.

Otherwise, dealing with these two people, one tire and one ice combined would have been more difficult.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s soul power was ignited to resist the power of ice.

A pitch-black token suddenly appeared above Horse-Face’s head. The word “Inferior” was written on it.

The moment this token appeared, the flow of the world in the ghost realm suddenly stopped.

A colossal phantom of a throne slowly appeared in the sky. The power of the Tribulation Fourth Level Condensed Throne was suddenly injected into Horse Face’s body through the token.

In an instant, the souls within ten thousand miles froze!

The souls of countless living beings from the ghost realm instantly froze into ice crystals.

Qin Yu’s soul fire instantly extinguished. Ten thousand miles froze into ice, and even his thoughts froze.

His soul fell to the ground, and numerous cracks appeared.

It was the most precious treasure of the ghost realm. Ox-Head and Horse-Face had worked a long time to obtain enough merit points before exchanging them for this supreme treasure.

The treasure capable of directly communicating with the sea of the Path of Heaven was tremendously rare, to the extent that its grade could not even be assessed.

How could a treasure that was unavailable in the human world be graded? Almost simultaneously, the day and night wandering deities attacked in an instant.

The two held hands and stuck together from the front to the back, becoming a conjoined body.

A massive vortex appeared beneath Qin Yu.

The Infernal Hell appeared beneath Qin Yu’s feet, emitting a hair-raising, agonizing wail from within.

Underneath, countless living beings were being tortured.

A little ghost of the ghost race opened the mouth of a living being, clamped its tongue with iron pliers, stretched it out, and slowly pulled it out.

Some ghost race living beings’ souls were wrapped in a powder that could sense pain better, and the little ghost kicked them into a pot of oil and stir-fried them.

Some living beings were crushed back and forth by a stone mill filled with Soul Devouring Spikes. These Soul Devouring Spikes kept crushing their souls until the souls could no longer endure the pain and dissipated.

There were also ferocious living beings that hugged a one-meter-tall copper cylinder naked. Lava was burning inside the cylinder, and the little ghosts were constantly fanning at the side. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

No matter how powerful Qin Yu’s soul was, his face turned somewhat pale from the sight.

This was the true eighteen levels of hell. Most people who had seen the day and night wandering deities, also known as ominous deities on Earth, had bad luck. It was probably due to the influence of the Infernal Hell.

The day and night wandering deity squatted on the ground, and his arm slowly melted into the Infernal Hell.

“Then, among countless planes of hell, giant hands began appearing out of nowhere. These giant hands selectively seized the most sinister beings.

When these evil spirits were being tortured, they were still unruly and emitted an extremely fierce aura. Even the punishment of the Infernal Hell failed to make them bow.

These were the real evil ghosts that the day and night wandering deities seized.

“Hundred Ghosts Parade!”

A hundred evil ghosts were pulled out of the Infernal Hell. A ferocious aura of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood instantly enveloped the entire space. The moment they looked at Qin Yu, they pounced on him as if they were hungry wolves staring at the most delicious food.

“Meat! Meat! The most delicious meat of the soul! I want to eat!”

“I’m starving! This living being is mine!”

“Hehehehe, you idiots. The soul tastes the best after suffering extreme pain.

Let me torture him first before eating!”

When these living beings saw them escape from the Infernal Hell inexplicably, they let out shrill cries.

In the blink of an eye, these evil ghosts, which were thousands of feet tall, ruthlessly smashed into Qin Yu’s soul. They then bit on him with their big mouths and wanted to devour him directly.

Feeling the soul tremble violently, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. Although it was just the simplest tear and bite, its force was shocking.

Horse Face’s soul freezing for thousands of miles, coordinating with the day and night wandering deities, attacked with full strength.

At the border of the ghost realm, the clone of Qin Yu’s soul origin clone had released its second-level desolate divine eyes to the extreme.

A wave of the power of the sorcerer tribe landed on his body and reverberated back onto Qin Yu in the confrontation.

The ghostly sword in his hand lit up with a strange green light, and the scarecrow on the hilt soared into the sky.

It turned into a scarecrow vengeful spirit that soared into the sky, and an extremely evil and resentful aura appeared in the void, revealing the image of an enormous scarecrow that terrified countless living beings.

The scarecrow held the human bone comb and the evil spirit mirror. Its pupils were burning with green karmic fire.

“The scarecrow, the human bone comb, and the evil spirit mirror. The three Saint Weapons of the sorcerer tribe?”

The day and night wandering deities revealed an extremely fearful expression.

During the last war, these sorcerer tribe’s Saint Weapons had harvested many living beings from the ghost realm. They were considered notorious in the ghost realm.
