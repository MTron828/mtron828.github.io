Qin Yu turned around and went back to the hotel.

Although the Chuzhou region’s Military District had arranged a place to stay, Qin Yu, who was used to being alone, still found a hotel with Yao Qing.

“Mr. Qin, how is the Yan Family? Are you engaged to Miss Yan?” As soon as he entered the room, Yao Qing asked with a smile.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at Yao Qing and said, “What are you asking for? Go to sleep quickly.”

“Why won’t you tell me? I saw that Miss Yan treated you so well. The two of you must have secretly gotten engaged,” Yao Qing muttered.

Qin Yu ignored him. He sat cross-legged on the bed and couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

Judging from the dead energy between old Mister Yan’s brows, he probably couldn’t even hold on for half a year.

When that time came, what would Yan Ruoxue do?

Such a tight schedule made Qin Yu feel immense pressure. He wasn’t even in the mood to sleep.

That night, Qin Yu didn’t sleep. Instead, he chose to take out the herbs and refined pills.

A few herbs were enough for Qin Yu to refine a few Vitality Enhancing Pills.

After the entire night, Qin Yu successfully refined three Vitality Enhancing Pills.

But he wasn’t in a hurry to consume them because there was still a tough battle today.

At eight o’clock in the morning, Qin Yu arrived at the military district of Jingdu on time.

Updates by

Commander Long and the others had already been waiting in the stands early on, while Xue Hu was reprimanding the team members on the training ground.

Qin Yu walked straight to Commander Long’s side and sat down, then asked, “Commander Long, how’s the situation?”

When he saw Qin Yu, Commander Long’s face was filled with indescribable excitement.

He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder forcefully and said, “Qin Yu, you’ve made a great contribution this time! Our score is 99 points, the same as that of the Jingdu Military District! Second place is already assured!”

“Tell me, what reward do you want? I’ll apply for it for you! Money? Or a position?” Commander Long asked.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “If you really want to give me a reward, can you give me herbs? The best ones are those that are more than a thousand years old.”

When he heard this, Commander Long’s face immediately fell.

He touched his chin and said, “There aren’t many herbs in the military district, but I can help you ask around.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Commander Long, you have a lot of connections. It’s good enough that you can help me ask around.”

“Okay, no problem!” Commander Long nodded and said.

“By the way, today is the day of the fight with the Jingdu Military District. Whether we can win or not, we have to make sure Commander Ye isn’t humiliated, understand?” Commander Long reminded.

“Okay,” Qin Yu agreed.

Then, Qin Yu walked towards the training ground.

The moment the members of the Longhu team saw Qin Yu, they immediately shouted, “Greetings, Instructor Qin!”

Qin Yu waved his hand. He swept his gaze across the crowd and said, “I only have one request for the Longhu team, and that is to only win and not lose!”

“No matter who the other party is or what their background is, we have to do our best to defeat them, understand?!”

“Yes!” The members of the Longhu team immediately roared!

Qin Yu nodded in satisfaction. At this time, Xue Hu pulled Qin Yu aside.

“Qin Yu, Commander Long should have told you that we can only lose today, not win,” Xue Hu said with a frown.

Qin Yu glanced at Xue Hu and said, “My memory is not very good, so I forgot about this matter.”

“Qin Yu, Commander Long...”

“Alright, I will bear the consequences alone.” Qin Yu interrupted Xue Hu and patted his shoulder.

Xue Hu didn’t say anything more.

Of course, he wasn’t too worried.

Because the person leading Jingdu’s military team was Ye Qing’s disciple.

It was said that Ye Qing had personally trained twenty-four disciples, and now, they were all serving in the Military District.

The disciple leading the team this time was Ye Qing’s newest beloved disciple.

A disciple personally trained by Ye Qing was definitely not weak.

In Xue Hu’s opinion, Qin Yu might not necessarily win.

Time passed minute by minute, and soon, Ye Qing personally arrived at the scene.

As usual, he sat in his seat from yesterday with his eyes closed.

With Ye Qing’s arrival, the final match began.

The host stood on the stage and shouted, “This is the final round of this year’s final match! The Chuzhou region vs. the Jingdu region! Please welcome the members of both sides!”

After the shout, the two sides came to the center of the training ground amidst the loud music.

Qin Yu stood up and stared at the members of both sides.

The difference in strength between the members of both teams wasn’t big. It could even be said that the members of the Longhu team were stronger.

“The final match has officially begun!” The host shouted.

After a loud shout, both sides began to engage in close combat!

The sound of metal clashing could be heard continuously!

Both teams possessed extremely strong combat strength. The thrilling fight instantly attracted countless gazes!

Even Ye Qing opened his eyes and looked at this scene!

“Bang!”

With a loud bang, someone was knocked off the training ground!

For a moment, the two sides were in a deadlock! They were evenly matched!

This shocked people! One had to know that in the past, the Jingdu Military District had always been unrivaled!

In the face of an opponent, the Jingdu military district would usually crush them!

“What has the Chuzhou region experienced?”

“F * ck, the Chuzhou region is no weaker than the Jingdu Military District this year!”

“It’s unbelievable! The Jingdu Military District used the training plan left behind by Commander Ye!”

Afraid of missing out on any detail, everyone stared at this scene!

Every time a member fell, there would be waves of cheers!

In half an hour, thirteen members of Jingdu’s team had fallen, while only eight of the Chuzhou region’s team had fallen!

Commander Long watched anxiously. He clenched his fists and said somewhat angrily, “Qin Yu actually dares to disobey my orders!”

The number of members on the field became fewer and fewer before finally forming a three-on-one situation!

The Chuzhou region, which already had a slight advantage, was now in a situation where victory was certain.

“Pfft!”

However, at this moment, an accident happened!

The remaining three members of the Longhu team were hit by a punch and fell to the ground!

Despite having a three against one advantage, they actually lost!

The Jingdu Military District won against the Chuzhou region with an extremely weak advantage!

Commander Long put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Fortunately, I was already prepared.”

He knew that Qin Yu might not necessarily listen to his orders, so he warned the team members in advance.

These team members didn’t want to go against Qin Yu’s intentions, but they also didn’t dare to go against Commander Long’s orders.

So, they chose not to lose so miserably.

But how could all of this escape Qin Yu’s eyes?

He couldn’t help but frown slightly with displeasure.

“I now announce that the Jingdu Military District has obtained victory, and the next battle will be between the two team’s leaders!” The host shouted.

On the stage, Ye Qing frowned slightly.

Beside him stood a young man.

This young man was Ye Qing’s newest disciple and also the captain of the Jingdu Military District’s participating team. His name was Pang Ding.

Pang Ding bowed to Ye Qing and said, “Commander Ye, we won.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ye Qing glanced at Pang Ding coldly and said, “They went easy on us.”

Pang Ding was stunned and said indignantly, “How is this possible?! Commander Ye, how could they be so kind as to go easy on us on purpose?”

Ye Qing stared at the stage and said coldly, “We are no match against them in a one-on-one fight, let alone in a three-on-one fight.”

“That... that’s because they aren’t strong enough. It’s because our tactics are good!” Pang Ding said indignantly.

Ye Qing’s cold gaze immediately landed on Pang Ding.

He said icily, “A loss is a loss. You aren’t as strong as Qin Yu. You aren’t as capable as Qin Yu!”

Although Pang Ding was unconvinced, he didn’t dare to talk back. He could only bow and say, “I understand, Commander Ye.”

Ye Qing glanced at Pang Ding and said, “During the second half, return the favor.”
