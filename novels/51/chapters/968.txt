Chapter 969: Chapter 969: Cooperation

After Qin Yu put on the silver hoop charm, he sat down beside him.

“Since we have reached an agreement, we should be honest with each other, right?”Qin Yu said.

“Yes,”he said somewhat reluctantly.

Qin Yu said with a smile, “Then let me ask you, What’s Your Name? What was your cultivation level in the past? who were you trapped here?”

The questions he threw out in a row clearly made him a little unhappy.

However, after a few seconds, he finally replied, “I’ve already forgotten my name. I only know that I once had a title, called the number one killer! Back then, I...”

“So you don’t have a name?”He was just about to brag when he was interrupted by Qin Yu.

“Since you don’t have a name, then I’ll give you one. HMM... from today onwards, you shall be called... Tie Dan.”Qin Yu muttered.

“I’ll F * ck you! I’ll F * cking...”

“Tie Dan, what’s your cultivation level?”Qin Yu interrupted him once again.

He said angrily, “Don’t call me tie Dan! Call me Asura!”

“Got it, tie Dan.”Qin Yu seemed to be deep in thought.

“If I’m not wrong, you should be... at the peak of the Martial Saint Realm? Or the Almighty Realm?”Qin Yu guessed.

Tie Dan snorted coldly and said, “I’ve said it before, a martial saint is not worth mentioning in front of me! Back then, I was almost able to break through to the level of a mighty one and step into the virtual entity! Unfortunately, I was sealed before I had the time to do so.”

“Virtual entity?”Qin Yu could not help but be a little surprised.

Up until now, Qin Yu had never met an expert at the virtual entity Stage!

A martial saint was at the nascent soul stage, and above the nascent soul stage was the level of a mighty one, also known as the soul formation stage.

After breaking through to the soul formation stage, it was the return to void stage!

And the return to void stage also had another title, it was called a saint, or an ancient saint!

It was said that the return to void stage possessed great magical powers, and with a raise of a hand, it could destroy the world!

This kind of strength was indeed incomparably powerful!

“Even an expert who was about to enter the return to void stage would be suppressed, then the person who suppressed you is probably not simple.”Qin Yu muttered.

Tie Dan snorted coldly and said, “Isn’t that nonsense! Of course, if I were to enter the return to void stage, it would be hard to say who would win or lose.”

Qin Yu was too lazy to care about these things. He waved his hand and said, “Let me ask you, after I give you a thousand spiritual stones, what stage can you enter?”

“A mere thousand spiritual stones are not worth mentioning at all. At most, I can recover to the martial saint stage.”He muttered.

Qin Yu frowned.

Martial Saint Realm? It was much worse than he had expected.

“Of course, if you have five thousand spiritual stones, I might be able to touch the Almighty Realm.”At this moment, tie Dan changed the topic.

“Five thousand... That’s a bit too much.”Qin Yu scratched his head.

Currently, Qin Yu only had around five thousand spiritual stones in total.

He was really reluctant to give all of them to him.

“You can’t even bear to give a mere five thousand spiritual stones? When I come back to life, I’ll bring you back to earn it back,”iron egg muttered.

“Are you serious?”Qin Yu asked.

“Absolutely!”Iron Egg said with confidence.

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then waved his hand and said, “Forget it, let me think about it.”

With that, Qin Yu left the spatial god tool.

After returning to his original body, Qin Yu took out spirit stones from another spatial god tool.

At a glance, it was about five thousand spirit stones.

The efficacy of these spirit stones was beyond imagination. Qin Yu was reluctant to give them away just like that.

However, the current Qin Yu indeed needed a strong helper.

“It is said that there is a heavenly vanilla in the second secret realm. If tie Dan can take me to the second secret realm to collect the heavenly vanilla, then the five thousand spiritual stones will not be a loss,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Without the heavenly vanilla, it was impossible for Qin Yu to step into the martial saint realm. Even his golden core would be further damaged.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Five thousand it is. If you don’t want to give up, you won’t be able to catch the Wolf!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Thus, Qin Yu put all these spirit stones into the spatial god tool.

The moment he put them in, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense followed.

In the spatial god Tool, spirit stones were falling into the abyss one by one.

Qin Yu stood by tie Dan’s side, quietly watching him absorb these spirit stones.

One Spirit Stone after another was absorbed into the light. These spirit stones seemed to be not worth mentioning in front of him.

The moment they touched, they melted away like snowflakes encountering a heat wave.

This process was very fast. In less than half an hour, the five thousand spirit stones disappeared without a trace.

“So Fast?”Qin Yu could not help but be a little surprised.

The Ray of light was silent, as if it had fallen into silence.

“Tie Dan?”Qin Yu called out tentatively.

At this moment, the ray of light suddenly began to shake.

He condensed at an extremely fast speed, and in the blink of an eye, he transformed into a human form!

This person was only about 1.4 meters tall, and his appearance was somewhat ugly.

Different from the wretched appearance of a handlebar mustache, there was a vicious and murderous aura between this person’s brows, and his pair of eyes made people shudder! “...”

Even Qin Yu was shocked by his honorable appearance.

“Tie Dan?”Qin Yu called out tentatively.

“Say it again, I’m not called Tie Dan!”He said angrily.

Qin Yu said with a smile, “Tie Dan, You Brag so much about yourself. How did you end up like this?”

Tie Dan narrowed his eyes slightly. He grinned and said with a sneer, “Do you know why I went on a killing spree for the first time back then?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know.”

“It’s because someone said I was ugly,”tie Dan said with a cold face.

“From then on, I killed whoever said I was ugly!”

“I killed at least hundreds of thousands of people! How is it? Are you scared?”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Hundreds of thousands of people said you were ugly? Then you must be suffering in your heart, right?”

“Tell me the truth, have you ever hidden in the quilt and cried secretly?”Qin Yu said with a smile.
