Chapter 2603: Fury of the Demon Saint

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Subsequently, Qin Yu was immersed in the cultivation of the reflection.

The ogre’s esophagus required a corpse to enter it before it could summon a corpse. Moreover, the range of the esophagus and the number of summons were linked to one’s soul power, and the summoning would consume tremendous mental strength.

Unless he could obtain a powerful corpse, summoning this esophagus was rather ineffective.

On the contrary, he would advance greatly if he familiarized himself with the Order of Reflection.

However, his current maximum range is around 60 meters, and using this power within this range would not incur significant consumption.

However, in the event it was more than 60 meters, not only would it be unduly challenging to aim, but it would also consume a lot of mental strength.

Moreover, even within this sixty-meter range, the lines shot out from that hole would exhibit irregular and erratic movements.

Therefore, Qin Yu would need a specific preparation time to aim at the final target point. If the enemy had a fast movement speed in battle, it was almost difficult to hit them.

This was probably why Yin Lin had summoned the ogre’s esophagus previously. It could delay him.

“This seems to be the way of this Saint Kingdom. However, it’s quite remarkable that it doesn’t require any cultivation. There’s no need to cultivate at all. One can use this way of strength, which is completely different from the mortal realm.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Qin Yu thought to himself. In the human world, one had to comprehend the way constantly to grasp it completely.

However, it seemed to be completely different in the Saint Kingdom.

Qin Yu guessed that this might be related to the divine flame that Chen Shuang had bestowed. The divine flame mark was like a pass to this land, and their souls had been baptized by the power of this Saint Kingdom, which was why they could quickly accept this power.

No matter what, he had obtained these two orders of rules.

It was a significant advancement for Qin Yu, but now was not the time for joy.

Qin Yu sat on the ground and pondered for a long time. This battle was against Yin Lin, who was also at the utmost limits of his strength.

No matter how he deduced, he found that both had the opportunity to kill each other.

Even if he had the Seal of Heaven Returning, the hat of the void, and even the divine bow, Yin Lin still had a chance to kill him.

Actually, in terms of strength, Yin Lin was slightly inferior to him.

However, in terms of speed, Yin Lin could crush him.

This could be told from the ease and comfort Yin Lin displayed on the battlefield compared to his plight.

Yin Lin was very calm even when facing the ogre.

However, his true body was tremendously impacted after Qin Yu destroyed his two clones.

In his perfect condition, Qin Yu did not have the confidence to win at all.

Regardless of the seeds planted by the Saints, the order that he had spent a lot of effort to pry into, or even the skills of the Heart of the Saint Kingdom. Each was intensely mysterious. If one could use it, it would not be difficult for the weak to defeat the strong.

“Hahaha, kid, you’re not bad. You’ve thought so deeply. However, you’re right. The living beings that can come to the Saint Kingdom are not easy to deal with, especially those chosen by the Saints. In my opinion, everyone will have a chance to obtain the 81 Heart of Saint Kingdom to control this Saint Kingdom.” As if he sensed Qin Yu’s thoughts, Immortal Emperor Yao spoke again.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, what’s the difference between the seed and the order of rules?”

Qin Yu hurriedly asked while this fellow came out.

“The seed only contains a trace of the Saint’s power. Once used, the power will weaken. However, using these two orders of rules as an example, this is the power of rules deduced by the Saint when he forcefully peered into the power of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. Once mastered, it will completely fuse with your soul and won’t be detached unless you die.”

Immortal Emperor Yao seemed in a good mood and immediately answered Qin Yu’s question.

“However, the power of forcibly peering into deductions is somewhat different from the one in the Saint Kingdom. It is much weaker than the complete order of rule. You will understand when you can pry into the way of the Saint

Kingdom.”

Qin Yu gasped. He did not expect it to have such a vast amount of information.

Outside the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, in the boundless expanse of heaven and earth, eighteen huge divine kingdoms were floating in different regions.

At this moment, a massive energy fluctuation suddenly appeared above one of the Saint Kingdoms.

The entire Saint Kingdom was bathed in an energy light that no one could look straight at. It was full of terrifying energy fluctuation.

As a furious voice sounded in the sky, the energy gathered by the Saint Kingdom suddenly transformed into a pillar of light that blasted out, landing on the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

A sea of fire appeared in the sky above the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, and the entire Sacred Kingdom trembled slightly.

In the Saint Kingdom, this terrifying power also brought a terrifying disaster to the mortal realm.

“Qin Yu! I, Emerald Serpent Witch, will capture you and use the cruelest punishment in the world to make you regret coming to this expanse of heaven and earth.”

In the Saint Kingdom, an extremely furious voice rang out in the void.

This mournful voice echoed throughout the entire realm of the Saints.

“Looks like the descendant of the Emerald Snake Witch is completely dead. That’s why she has to vent the anger in her heart even if she has to use the power of the Saint Kingdom. However, with her methods, she would have made some arrangements. How could she let Qin Yu kill him?”

The Holy Lord of the Divine Firmament Sect, Loli, said curiously.

The inheritance of the Emerald Snake lineage was tremendously strange. When it gave birth to a new offspring, the mother had to eat the other half to give birth to a healthy offspring.

Yin Lin was also a precious son she had left behind. Now that he had died, no wonder she was so furious.

“It’s just too impulsive. Yin Lin is a vulnerable spot for this crazy woman. Now, it’ll be a fight to the death.”

Loli frowned and said.

“The Saint Kingdom is ever-changing. Even if I go all out, I won’t be able to predict the changes within. If he’s even afraid of this, I’m afraid he won’t be able to obtain the 81 Heart of Saint Kingdom in the end.”

Su Xinghe shook his head.

“However, even if he survives till the end, you know his ending if he doesn’t become the new master of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.”

Shen Xiao smiled bitterly. No one could protect him if a Saint targeted him.

After the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom fell, a battle already quietly began.

Basically, all the Saints had set up their most powerful methods. Even the strongest Saints among the Saints had no way of knowing who the final Lord of this Saint Kingdom would be.

“If this Saint Kingdom doesn’t end up with the human race in the end, the ending is destined. The battle for the mortal realm is especially intense now, and the human race has suffered heavy casualties. It’s funny that the other human race Saints still want to compromise with the Saints of the alien race.
