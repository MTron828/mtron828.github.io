1919 The Skywater Prison

Those people had come for Qin Yu, but Chang Mang left Cold Moon Palace before him!

In the cold Moon Palace, Chang Mang already showed disrespect for Si Shifeng and even embarrassed him many times!

Given Si Shifeng’s personality, he would definitely take revenge even for a minor grievance!

“What did you do to him?” Qin Yu asked subconsciously.

Their eyes immediately fell on Qin Yu.

Realizing he had a slip of the tongue, Qin Yu quickly stepped back.

“Do you have the right to speak here?” Si Shifeng said with a dark expression.

Yan Ruoxue was afraid that Qin Yu would be exposed, so she quickly shouted, “Watch the rules!”

“Miss Yan, you have to discipline your servant,” Si Shifeng said with some displeasure.

Yan Ruoxue ignored Si Shifeng’s words and continued to ask, “So what did you do to that holy body?”

Si Shifeng spread his hands and said, “I taught him a lesson, but this kid is too stubborn. I could only take him back.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu again failed to hold back.

He stepped forward and looked at Si Shifeng coldly, asking, “What did you do to him? Where is he now?”

“Are you courting death?” Yi Shifeng was instantly more displeased. He slowly stood up, ready to attack.

But at this time, Qin Yu could no longer care less.

He looked at Si Shifeng coldly and said, “I’m asking you. What did you do to him?”

“Qin Yan! Don’t you know the rules?” Yan Ruoxue shouted. As she was afraid that Qin Yu would lose his mind, she looked at Uncle Yan and said, “Uncle Yan, take him away!”

Uncle Yan had long wanted to make a move. With a wave of his hand, a terrifying force directly captured Qin Yu in his hand and took him to the side.

After Qin Yu was taken away, Si Shifeng said, “Miss Yan, this kid is too unruly. He needs to be taught a lesson.”

Yan Ruoxue ignored him and said in a low voice, “The holy body you took away is an old friend of mine. Can you do me a favor and let him go?”

“Ah?” Si Shifeng was startled. Then he shook his head and said, “Unfortunately, Miss Yan, you’re late. He has already been thrown into the Skywater Prison.”

Hearing the words “Skywater Prison,” Yan Ruoxue’s expression turned ugly.

“Is there any way to get him out of the Skywater Prison?” Yan Ruoxue continued to ask.

Si Shifeng smiled bitterly and said, “Unless Holy Lord uses a formation. Otherwise, the Skywater Prison can never be opened.”

Yan Ruoxue opened her mouth and was about to say something when Si Shiyue, who was beside her, said, “Holy Lord has gone out to travel the world and won’t be back for a while.”

This instantly cut off Yan Ruoxue’s plan to plead for mercy. It left her speechless.

“I’m curious. Ruoxue, how do you know that so-called holy body? From what I know, he doesn’t seem to have any background,” Si Shiyue slightly narrowed his eyes and said.

“Don’t tell me that kid is from the same place as you?”

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and said expressionlessly, “Of course not. I’ve only met him once in the streets, and he’s a friend to me.”

“I see.” Though Si Shiyue acknowledged her, he was suspicious in his heart.

“Ruoxue, don’t worry. When Holy Lord returns, I will definitely plead for you,” Si Shifeng said.

“Thank you very much,” Yan Ruoxue nodded and said.

“Alright. Since you’re fine, I should go now,” Si Shiyue got up and said. “Speaking of which, I haven’t seen Yan Yunfan for a long time. Let’s go and visit him.”

After that, the two said goodbye to Yan Ruoxue and left Mount Donghuang.

After they left, Uncle Yan brought Qin Yu out.

Yan Ruoxue hurriedly took out the medicine and gently applied it to Qin Yu’s wound.

“Ruoxue, the person they took away is Chang Mang!” Qin Yu said anxiously, ignoring his injuries.

As Yan Ruoxue was applying the medicine, she said, “I know,”

“No, I have to save him!” Qin Yu said in a panic.

Yan Ruoxue glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You’re going to save him? He’s in the Si family’s Skywater Prison. No one can open it except Holy Lord. What’s the point of you going?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Skywater Prison? What kind of place is that?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“It’s a prison invented by a secret technique of the Si family. It can…”

“Uncle Yan!”

Yan Ruoxue interrupted Uncle Yan before he could finish.

She looked at Qin Yu and said softly, “Don’t worry, Chang Mang will be fine. I’ll go to the Si family to get him out for you.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth but couldn’t say anything. Although he was tremendously anxious, he had no choice but to nod and say, “Thank you very much.”

“Alright. What you need to do now is to recuperate.”

Yan Ruoxue let Qin Yu lie down and considerately applied medicine for him.

Uncle Yan couldn’t help but snort softly and immediately retreated to the side.

After applying the medicine to Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue also calmed down.

“How are you feeling now?” Yan Ruoxue asked.

Qin Yu rubbed his chest and said, “He didn’t intend to kill me with that strike. Otherwise, I’m afraid I would be dead by now.”

“You’re right.” Yan Ruoxue nodded. “Si Shiyue’s strength is incredibly terrifying.”

Qin Yu sighed lightly.

...

That was right. Si Shiyue’s strength was indeed more terrifying than he had imagined.

With just a casual palm strike, he had easily broken through all of Qin Yu’s defenses.

Qin Yu’s chances of winning were almost zero if he were to fight with him now.

“Have a good rest. Don’t overthink. After all, his cultivation realm is beyond yours,” Yan Ruoxue gently patted Qin Yu’s head and said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded, forced a smile, and said, “I know.”

Although he said that, Qin Yu did not calm down in his heart.

“You rest well. I’ll go scout for information,” Yan Ruoxue stood up and said.

“Alright.” Qin Yu agreed.

Yan Ruoxue then left Mount Donghuang with Uncle Yan.

After leaving Mount Donghuang, Uncle Yan couldn’t help but ask, “Miss Yan, you should know the Skywater Prison had a slim chance of survival. Why did you…”

“Chang Mang won’t die,” Yan Ruoxue interrupted Uncle Yan. She then looked at him and said coldly, “We must not let Qin Yu know the truth about the Skywater Prison.”

...

Uncle Yan sighed and could only agree, “I know.”

“By the way,” Yan Ruoxue continued.

“Si Shiyue must have noticed something. He’s a meticulous person and will definitely suspect Qin Yu,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

Uncle Yan was startled and asked in confusion, “You’re saying… He would suspect the person beside you is Qin Yu?”

“At the very least, he would suspect he’s related to Qin Yu,” Yan Ruoxue took a deep breath.

“Uncle Yan, arrange for Qin Yu to go to the outer hall.”

“You want him to be a disciple in name?” Uncle Yan asked in surprise.

“Mmm,” Yan Ruoxue responded. “We can only do this now.”
