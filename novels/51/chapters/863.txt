Chapter 864: Chapter 864, the closest to death

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically when he felt this power!

This power was exactly the same as the power he had felt in the second secret realm!

Not only Qin Yu, but the pavilion master and Old Mister Yan’s bodyguards also felt this terrifying power approaching!

Everyone could not help but feel their hair stand on end and their hearts palpitate!

“Is this... a martial saint?”Qin Yu exclaimed in shock.

The Pavilion Master could not help but stand up as he looked towards the direction of the door.

“Old Mister Yan, please wait a moment. I’ll be right back.”The pavilion master said.

Qin Yu also stood up and prepared to follow the pavilion master.

At this moment, the pavilion master stopped Qin Yu and shook his head, “This person is most likely here for you. It’s better if you don’t appear.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Do you think I can escape in front of a martial saint?”

The Pavilion Master opened his mouth and finally, he could only nod his head.

The two of them leaped down from the pavilion master’s Building and went straight to the square.

That force was still approaching. As the distance between them got closer and closer, Qin Yu’s expression could not help but become extremely ugly.

“What a terrifying force...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

In front of this power, Qin Yu couldn’t even think of resisting!

It was as if he was facing a huge mountain, and that terrifying oppressive feeling made him seem extremely small.

His figure got closer and closer, and very quickly, he appeared at the door.

He slowly walked towards the two of them.

Qin Yu’s expression became more and more nervous, and a drop of cold sweat couldn’t help but drip down from his forehead.

The pavilion master’s long and narrow eyes also landed on him, not daring to shift his gaze at all.

Finally, Zhai Xing arrived in front of the two of them.

He looked down at the two of them from above. There was no sadness or joy in his eyes, as if he was staring at two ants.

“Lord Zhai Xing?”After seeing this person, the pavilion master seemed to recognize him.

“Greetings, Lord Zhai Xing.”The pavilion master bowed slightly and said politely.

Zhai Xing glanced at the pavilion master and said, “You know me?”

The pavilion master smiled and said, “When you became famous, I was just a child. However, your reputation has left an indelible impression in my heart.”

Seeing the pavilion master’s attitude, Qin Yu could not help but suck in a cold breath.

This was the first time he saw the pavilion master’s humble attitude.

“Since you know me, then there’s no need to say anything more,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“Which one is Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He braced himself and took a step forward, saying, “I am.”

Zhai Xing grunted in gratitude and said, “I am here to kill you. I have been ordered to kill you.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “What you said is quite straightforward.”

Zhai Xing raised his hand and said, “You snatched Yan Ruoxue from the second secret realm and angered the higher-ups. I have to say, you have guts.”

Qin Yu said with some bitterness, “Can I understand that you are complimenting me?”

Zhai Xing said coldly, “Those who have too much guts usually won’t live for long.”

As he spoke, Zhai Xing’s finger slightly curved. Qin Yu immediately felt a force suddenly appear around his body!

This force was continuously contracting, as if it wanted to crush Qin Yu’s bones!

Qin Yu clenched his teeth. He used all the spiritual power in his body to fight against this force!

When he saw Qin Yu’s body explode with an intense golden light, blue veins popped up on his forehead. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Even so, he still appeared extremely weak in front of a martial saint.

“Crack, crack, crack!”

Soon, bursts of cracking sounds came from the bones all over Qin Yu’s body, as if they were about to be crushed.

Qin Yu could not help but spit out fresh blood from his mouth!

“Lord Zhai Xing!”

At this moment, the pavilion master hurriedly walked forward and cupped his hands as he said, “Lord Zhai Xing, Please Show Mercy!”

However, Zhai Xing coldly said, “Do you want to stop me?”

The pavilion master hurriedly said, “With my strength, how could I have the qualifications to stop you?”

“Then scram to the side!”Zhai Xing coldly berated.

However, the pavilion master stubbornly stood in front of Qin Yu. She opened her mouth and was about to speak when Zhai Xing waved her hand!

That terrifying force was like a storm, directly sending the pavilion master flying!

Her delicate body fiercely slammed into the wall, and blood oozed out from all parts of her body!

Just a casual palm had made it almost difficult for the pavilion master to Stand Up!

“Lord Pavilion Master!”Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth, and a wave of anger filled his chest!

Zhai Xing said coldly, “You actually still have the strength to care about others. No wonder you alerted the higher-ups.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “If I don’t die today... I will never forgive you...”

“Do you think you still have a chance to live today?”Zhai Xing snorted coldly.

“Ah! ! !”

A piercing pain came from Qin Yu’s body!

This pain was unbearable and he almost died!

At this moment, the pavilion master got up from the ground with difficulty.

She walked to Zhai Xing and said in a deep voice, “Master Zhai Xing, The Guardian has an agreement that martial saints are not allowed to appear. Do you want to go against the agreement...”

Zhai Xing glanced at the pavilion master and said coldly, “Are you trying to scare me with the Guardian? If I kill this kid and return to the second secret realm immediately, who would know?”

“No matter how strong the guardian is, it’s impossible for him to know everything.”

The pavilion master said in a deep voice, “Lord Zhai Xing, you’re wrong. Qin Yu is different from the others.”

Zhai Xing narrowed his eyes and said in a cold voice, “What do you mean?”

The pavilion master said, “Lord Zhai Xing, can we have a word in private?”

“Why? Are you trying to stall for time? Don’t play tricks with me,”Zhai Xing said with some sarcasm.

The pavilion master shook his head and said, “In front of you, no matter what tricks are used, it’s useless.”

“I will only delay you for five minutes. I think that five minutes won’t change anything.”

Zhai Xing fell silent.

He seemed to feel that what the pavilion master said made sense.

Therefore, Zhai Xing’s palm loosened, and the power that was lingering around Qin Yu’s body also disappeared.

Qin Yu fell to the ground with a bang, and his mouth was constantly gasping for air.

This was the closest he had ever been to death! This feeling made Qin Yu feel a trace of fear.

“I’ll only give you five minutes,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“Don’t worry, I only need five minutes,”the pavilion master said.

Therefore, Zhai Xing followed behind the pavilion master and walked to one side.

The two of them stood not far away, and no one knew what they were talking about.

Qin Yu’s eyes kept looking at the two of them, and he was extremely worried.

Soon, five minutes passed.

Zhai Xing and the pavilion master walked back to Qin Yu’s side.

He sized up Qin Yu from head to toe, and could not help but frown slightly.

“Are you telling the truth?”Zhai Xing asked coldly.

“Absolutely.”The pavilion master nodded.

Zhai Xing took a deep breath and said coldly, “Okay, your name is Ji Yuhong, right? I’ll remember you.”

After saying this, Zhai Xing turned around and left.

Qin Yu was immediately dumbfounded.

He got up from the ground and said with a shocked expression, “Lord Pavilion master, what did you say to him?”
