2473 The Confusion about the Altar

In the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect, Martial Uncle Chen Zhisha could be considered the great pillar of strength to the disciples.

He had been traveling around in the secular world and had enlightened countless people.

He once saved countless lives of the human race. Even amid the boundless universe and mainlands, legends of his deeds echoed across multiple spaces.

Previously, when Qin Yu met Chen Zhisha in purgatory, he was fighting against the monster race for the sake of the human race.

But now, this individual had forsaken the human race, leaving Wan Li and the others furious and bewildered.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who was leaving, felt a tremendous vibration coming from behind him.

“The people from the Buddhist sect seemed to have arrived. I can sense another powerful killing intent besides the power of the Buddhist sect.”

Qin Yu said in awe. The person arriving must have possessed extraordinary strength, as the terrifying vibrations could reverberate across vast distances.

“Qin Yu, keep moving forward in this direction. It seems that the monster race army’s attack becomes more frequent when we move forward in this direction..”

Lei Xin and Flower Granny were by Qin Yu’s side. The monster race chasing them was all six-winged, and each possessed the power above the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

Even Qin Yu found it strenuous to clash with this kind of power.

“Alright!”

Hearing Flower Granny’s reminder, Qin Yu headed in that direction and moved on swiftly.

After passing through numerous mountain ranges, unexpectedly, there was another vast expanse of new land.

Many humans, demonic beasts, and even some monster race living beings lived here.

However, there were no signs of war here. Moreover, there were many cultivators here due to the dense spiritual energy.

Almost one in ten thousand people had spiritual energy fluctuations, which was relatively high, and it was only slightly lower when compared with the cultivators in the Holy Region.

However, True Saint was the highest cultivation realm here, which not many, and 95% of the cultivators here were below the Reversion Void Stage.

Qin Yu swept his divine sense across and immediately discovered a particular area of the space seemed rather unusual.

His body flashed and came to a mountain peak.

Even though it looked familiar, he could not suppress his anger.

Many human race women were imprisoned here. Compared to the outside world, about 5,000 human race women were imprisoned here. However, what shocked Qin Yu was that these 5,000 human race women were all cultivators above True Saint, and there were even dozens of cultivators at the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

The moment they saw these people, everyone was in absolute shock.

A Tribulation Transcending stage cultivator was considered a top figure, even in the Holy Region. However, they had become the monster race’s tool for reproduction.

A layer of energy restrained these women’s bodies. What was surprising was that all these women were pregnant.

The Moon Demon Godly King and nearly 3,000 six-winged monster race slowly walked out. They stared at Qin Yu and others indifferently but did not make a move.

“Retreat.”

Lei Xin said softly. With the Moon Demon Godly King guarding this place, they had no means to rescue the people here.

With a casual arrow, Qin Yu would be injured. Its strength was probably above Qin Yu’s.

Qin Yu stared deeply at the group of the human race women. Their lifeless gazes stung Qin Yu.

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly and retreated deeper into the forest with Lei Xin.

They could not be encircled by the monster race again. Moreover, they had another mission to find out the purpose of the monster race here.

“Could it be that these human race women are the ultimate target of the monster race? These human race women are considered top talents even in the Holy Region. Combining them with the power of the monster race bloodline, I’m afraid the monster race’s offspring they give birth to will be tremendously terrifying. Coupled with being baptized by the power of the Path of Heaven, it is probably an invincible army. We must think of a way to save these human race women.”

Lei Xin pondered for a long time before voicing out his judgment.

“The fact that the Moon Demon Godly King and 6,000 six-winged army guarding that place shows that it’s the most important place for the monster race. It should be tremendously difficult to launch a sneak attack. I don’t know how long these human race women have been imprisoned but many seem to be from the previous years of the Path of Heaven. Sigh!”

Flower Granny continued, her expression filled with unrestrained sadness.

Even if a person was not tormented, being imprisoned in such lightless caves for a Path of Heaven year would drive anyone mad, let alone these human race women enduring continuous humiliation from the demon race.

Moreover, in this place, even suicide was a luxury for them. Previously, after they rescued the group of human race women, they directly committed suicide because their souls had long broken down.

While thinking about the solutions, a few of them probed the surrounding environment again. They wanted to see if there were any monster race nests deeper in.

“We can’t go any deeper. If we attract the six-winged monster race here, I’m afraid the people here will suffer a tremendous disaster. Even the four-winged monster race isn’t something they can resist.”

Qin Yu stopped and was about to leave for another place.

“Wait, something is wrong.”

Lei Xin said with a frown. This place was confirmed long under the control of the monster race, so how could they not know there was another land here?

“Dean, are you saying the monster race has deliberately kept this land? What is their purpose then?”

Qin Yu was somewhat bewildered.

“Do you remember the power of sacrifice previously? I suspect they offer human lives for the sacrifice. Let me investigate.” Lei Xin’s body turned into a bolt of lightning and shot out in an instant.

A moment later, he returned to his original spot with an ugly expression.

“Follow me.”

Qin Yu and Flower Granny followed Lei Xin to one of the places.

At this moment, an enormous altar appeared before them.

That enormous structure, resembling a small mountain, had an octagonal shape and felt cold as metal to the touch, but it was impossible to discern what kind of metal it was made of.

Different patterns carved with monster inscriptions were on the eight sides. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

From the shape of it, it seemed to originate from its original intent. One side was engraved with the ancient ritual of the monster race.

One side was engraved with undying faith, one was with the sorcerer’s affirmation, one was a fiery red flame that seemed to symbolize death and war, and the other the pale ashes of the world.

These few monster inscriptions seemed to announce the most ancient language of the Path of Heaven.

Qin Yu touched the altar with one hand. Suddenly, he felt the altar in front of him begin to expand tremendously before his eyes. It was as far away as a tall mountain.

The altar at this moment was like the Path of Heaven. Endless dark language told Qin Yu the story of the monster race.

Time and all things would dissipate with time.

Only chaos, slaughter, darkness, war, and death could keep all living beings vigilant, ultimately making them stronger.
