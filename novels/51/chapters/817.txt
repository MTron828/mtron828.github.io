“How much strength did the Jingdu martial arts association hide?”Qin Yu became more and more suspicious.

No one knew who those eight high-ranking officials were.

“As the controller of the Second Secret Realm, Gu Zizhen must know the way to open the divine binding technique,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

As long as he could win against Gu Zizhen, everything would be solved easily.

Qin Yu turned around and walked out of Xiao Qing’s room.

Then, Qin Yu came to the Pavilion Master’s building.

Standing in front of Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a trace of heartache.

Although under the Pavilion Master’s care, Yan Ruoxue’s injuries had already recovered, the paleness on her face still couldn’t be concealed.

This immediately made Qin Yu even more anxious.

“Pavilion Master, I have to return to Jingdu,”Qin Yu said.

After saying this, Qin Yu pointed at Yan Ruoxue in the medicinal bath and said, “I have to bring Ruoxue away.”

The pavilion master glanced at Qin Yu and said, “She is very safe here with me.”

However, Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Pavilion Master, I can’t guarantee when the JINGDU martial arts association will send people over. If the Jingdu Martial Arts Association really goes crazy, I’m afraid the Divine Alchemist Pavilion will find it difficult to resist.”

“In this way, Yan Ruoxue will be taken away, and the Divine Alchemist pavilion will also be implicated.”

The pavilion master pointed in the direction of the secret chamber and said, “Qin Yu, believe me, I will make proper arrangements. Moreover, Jiang he is here.”

“In addition, I will also use the corresponding connections to protect the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“Qin Yu, you can go without worry.”Jiang he also walked over from the side.

“Do you think it’s appropriate for Yan Ruoxue to run around with you in her current state?”

Qin Yu was instantly speechless.

He gritted his teeth and then bowed. “Then I’ll have to trouble the two of you. I’ll come back as soon as possible.”

Then, Qin Yu said goodbye to them and turned to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

...

At this moment, in the second mystic realm.

In a building that looked like a palace, a tall man was sitting on the imperial throne.

This man was none other than the Master of the second secret realm, Gu Zizhen! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In this second secret realm, Gu Zizhen was like an ancient emperor, possessing absolute power and dignity!

The power under his command was even more powerful!

Eighteen martial saints and twenty-one half-step martial saints!

As for the Martial Marquis realm, there were countless of them.

If this power left the second secret realm, it would be enough to sweep across the entire world!

However, at this moment, Gu Zizhen’s face carried a hint of worry.

“Father, it’s just a mere Qin Yu. Why are you so worried? As long as you give the order, I will immediately go and capture him for you!”

A young man beside Gu Zizhen said.

This young man was none other than Gu Zizhen’s eldest son, Gu Xinghe.

And his strength had reached an astonishing half-step martial Saint Stage!

Gu Zizhen glanced at him and said, “That Qin Yu is not an ordinary person. Moreover, he now possesses the power of a martial saint.”

However, gu xinghe ridiculed, “Can a genius outside of the mystic realm be considered a genius?”

“The resources they possess are pitifully few. Regardless of their background or background, they are not worth mentioning!”

Gu Xinghe agreed with this.

The geniuses of the human world were not worth mentioning in the second secret area.

“Dad, let me go. I have not become a martial saint. Even if I leave the secret area, it would not be considered breaking the agreement.”Gu Xinghe volunteered.

Gu Zizhen shook his head and said, “No, too many people have died at the hands of that Qin Yu.”

“Dad, don’t you believe me?”Gu Xinghe was extremely displeased.

Gu Zizhen was silent for a moment before he said, “Even if I go, I have to wait until the power of the Martial Saint Qin Yu disappears.”

“And... If you lose to Qin Yu, he will definitely use you to blackmail me and negotiate terms. He will even use you to return the divine binding technique.”

“At that time, I might become the Second Qin Yu.”

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Dad, who does Qin Yu think he is? Does he have the right to be compared to me?”

“Isn’t the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in need of manpower? Why Don’t you let me take over Granny Qin’s position?”Gu Xinghe suggested.

Gu Zizhen thought for a moment, then asked, “Do you really want to go?”

“Absolutely! Dad, you should know that I’ve been coveting Granny Qin’s position for a long time,”Gu Xinghe said excitedly.

Gu Zizhen thought for a moment, then slammed the table and said, “Okay! Then I’ll agree to it!”

“Tomorrow, I’ll choose three half-step martial saints to follow you to take over the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

...

At this time, Qin Yu had already arrived near the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

He took out his phone and called Xia Hang.

“I’m on the roof of the long run building on the east side of the association. I want to see you,”Qin Yu said.

After he hung up the phone, Xia Hang rushed over about an hour later

After seeing Qin Yu, Xia hang was about to say something when Qin Yu took the lead and asked, “How is it? Who is in charge of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association Now? Can you take over Granny Qin’s position?”

Xia hang shook his head and said, “After Granny Qin died, it was indeed up to me. But it’s only limited to now. The higher-ups have not given any orders.”

“According to past experience, the higher-ups will definitely drop an expert to take over this position.”

“I’m afraid it’ll be a little difficult to get real power.”

Qin Yu glanced at Xia hang and said, “At least now the real power is in your hands.”

Xia hang frowned and said, “What do you want me to do?”

“I want to enter the Scripture Pavilion,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing this, Xia Hang’s expression changed again.

He couldn’t help but say, “Qin Yu, if I let you enter the Scripture Depository, then I will definitely be exposed! At that time, I’m afraid I Won’t be able to escape death.”

“Then organize everyone to enter together,”Qin Yu said.

“Organize all the students of the martial arts academy to enter the Scripture Depository together.”

Xia hang was stunned. He scratched his head as if he felt that this method was feasible.

“I’ll give it a try,”Xia hang said.

“It has to be done.”Qin Yu’s tone was extremely cold.

Xia hang opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he only nodded his head.

After meeting Xia Hang, Qin Yu went straight back to the martial arts academy.

When the surrounding people saw Qin Yu, they all unconsciously took a step back, as if they were avoiding the god of plague.

The reason was simple. From the outside world’s perspective, Qin Yu had killed Granny Qin. They were afraid that they would be implicated.

“Brother Qin.”At this moment, Zhuang Teng suddenly walked over from not far away.

Chu Heng was also with him.

Qin Yu nodded slightly as a form of greeting.

“We have arranged a banquet in the courtyard. I wonder if Brother Qin is interested?”Zhuang Teng asked with a smile.

Chu Heng, who was at the side, added, “Brother Qin, we have great respect for you. You must not reject us.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment.

It was a good opportunity to tell them his intention to go to the Scripture Depository.

These young masters of aristocratic families had seen the scripture depository before. They must know something.

Therefore, Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”
