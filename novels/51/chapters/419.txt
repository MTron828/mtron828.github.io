Chapter 420: First Catch the Leader! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was a resplendent light that erupted from the darkness!

Qin Yu once again stood in front of Huang Biao.

His clothes had already been torn apart, and streaks of white marks appeared on his body.

Most importantly, Qin Yu’s body was dyed with an even more resplendent golden light!

Under this golden light, Huang Biao’s technique instantly paled in comparison!

“How is this possible?” Huang Biao’s pupils suddenly dilated!

Under this wild bombardment, Qin Yu was actually completely fine?

Qin Yu quietly looked at Huang Biao and said, “There aren’t many who can force me to use the Saintly Body Technique with just their physical strength. You’re one of them.”

These words were praise of Huang Biao.

However, to Huang Biao’s ears, it was filled with ridicule.

“Quit putting on an act! I want to see just how strong your physical body is!” Huang Biao roared angrily. The golden light rose again and surged forward before pressing towards Qin Yu!

Facing Huang Biao’s fist, which was full of killing intent, Qin Yu was indifferent as he casually went up to meet it.

“Boom!”

A big explosion sounded! The entire surface of the river received a huge impact!

And under the ground, Yao Qing suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood!

Traces of blood dripped from the corner of his mouth. He was obviously unable to withstand this force!

Fortunately, everyone’s line of sight was on the battlefield, so no one noticed Yao Qing’s abnormality.

The light entered everyone’s sight, and no one could see clearly what was happening in the sky.

Finally, the light gradually disappeared. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

And in the air, only Qin Yu was left.

“Where’s Huang Biao?” Someone asked anxiously.

“He’s... He’s over there!”

Everyone saw that the golden light on Huang Biao’s body had been shattered, and his body was injured in many places!

His body was dyed red, and the golden light had disappeared!

“You... have such a strong body...” Huang Biao pointed at Qin Yu and struggled to get up from the ground.

Qin Yu looked at Huang Biao coldly and said, “If I wanted to, I could have taken your life just now.”

Huang Biao was stunned, and a hint of disappointment flashed across his face.

Although he didn’t want to believe it, he knew very well that Qin Yu’s trump card, the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist, hadn’t been used at all.

“I give up,” Huang Biao said quietly.

He looked at Elder Zhuo and the others and said, “I give up on this Meridian Circulation Technique.”

“Huang Biao, you!” Elder Zhuo wanted to say something, but Huang Biao had already made up his mind and didn’t give him a chance to.

Then, Huang Biao looked at Qin Yu and said, “You are the only person I, Huang Biao, admire. See You Again.”

After saying this, Huang Biao turned around and left, leaving everyone looking at each other in dismay.

No one had expected that Huang Biao would lose so miserably to the point where he had no strength to fight back!

Most importantly, Huang Biao’s strength was among the best among them.

“Everyone, there is something strange about his body. No matter what, we must not let him touch us,” said Elder Zhuo coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t panic. With a slight movement of his feet, he landed in front of everyone.

Faced with the siege of more than ten people, Qin Yu looked like he was leisurely strolling in a courtyard. There was no emotion to be seen on his face.

“Don’t waste time. I still have things to do,” Qin Yu said quietly.

But for a moment, no one was willing to be the first to attack.

“Hmph, a bunch of cowards.” Elder Zhuo couldn’t help but snort coldly.

In the next second, Elder Zhuo suddenly clawed at Qin Yu!

Seeing Elder Zhuo make his move, the others didn’t waste any more time and unleashed their spells one after another!

In an instant, many spells were unleashed!

Yao Qing couldn’t take it anymore. Afraid that he would be affected, he hurriedly ran to the side.

“Kacha!”

Elder Zhuo’s palm grabbed at Qin Yu’s body in mid-air.

In the next second, the sky suddenly turned dark, and lightning pointed at Qin Yu from the top!

“Rumble!”

On the other side, inner strength power formed by spells attacked him like raindrops!

Facing enemies on all sides, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid at all!

“Insect-like spells aren’t worth mentioning!” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed, and then his body suddenly shook!

In an instant, the golden light spread out in all directions with Qin Yu as the center!

All the spells were shattered at this moment!

“Everyone, don’t be afraid. This is a spell that I have carefully studied, the heavenly lightning spell! Under the heavenly lightning, Qin Yu...”

Before Elder Zhuo could finish his words, his expression darkened!

Qin Yu opened his mouth and actually forcefully swallowed the so-called heavenly lightning into his stomach!

“It’s not worth mentioning.” Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

Elder Zhuo felt his heart skip a beat! This kid was too freaky!

“Are you done? It’s my turn.” Qin Yu coldly swept his gaze across the crowd. Every word was like a life-threatening talisman, making people terrified!

“Whoosh!”

In the next second, Qin Yu suddenly disappeared!

Golden light reflected in everyone’s eyes. His powerful moves seemed to split the heavens and earth apart. Wherever it landed, not a single blade of grass grew!

Everyone scattered and fled. No one was willing to endure Qin Yu’s punch!

“Bang!”

However, Qin Yu was too fast. In the end, there were still people who couldn’t dodge in time.

The violent punch pierced through their flesh and they turned into a pile of withered bones!

At the moment of their death, Qin Yu immediately used the Heaven Swallowing Technique and swallowed them into his body, along with their divine sense!

“How comfortable.” Qin Yu licked his lips and sneered non-stop.

This technique made people’s hearts thump!

“Soul Binding Lock!”

At this moment, the Spiritual Master roared loudly!

In an instant, several chains flew out from his body!

The speed of these chains was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, they entered Qin Yu’s mind!

Qin Yu instantly felt his divine sense go into a trance, and he almost fell to the ground again.

“Huh? What is this?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

The moment he was dazed, Elder Zhuo seized the opportunity!

“Great Divine Slash!”

Accompanied by Elder Zhuo’s angry roar, a ray of heavenly light instantly shot up!

The ray of light instantly used intense power to slash at Qin Yu’s head!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. It was already too late for him to dodge.

“Slash!”

The light slashed across Qin Yu’s chest!

A bloody scar appeared in front of everyone!

“Well done!” Someone shouted excitedly!

This at least meant that Qin Yu’s body could be injured as well!

While he looked down at the bloody scar on his chest, Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

“You... are their commander?” Qin Yu looked at Elder Zhuo coldly.

Elder Zhuo’s expression instantly changed!

Oh no, he had his eyes on him!

“If you want to catch the thugs, first catch the leader. I’ll kill you first.” A cruel smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face.
