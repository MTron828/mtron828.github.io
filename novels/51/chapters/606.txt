Chapter 607: You Can Stay Here! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This technique was one of the Divine Rank techniques that Qin Yu controlled. It was called the Spiritual Fire Seal. The energy contained within it was enough to destroy a top-tier sect!

Everyone could feel the terrifying power contained within the Spiritual Fire Seal. For a moment, everyone’s expressions couldn’t help but change.

“Go to h*ll!”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar. The lotus flower in his hand ruthlessly pressed down on Yan Guiyi!

Yan Guiyi’s expression changed drastically. He had regained his senses at this critical moment.

Unfortunately, the lotus flower had already arrived in front of him at this moment!

Even with the protection of the Black Gold Stone, Yan Guiyi still sensed a hint of danger!

He hurriedly raised his arm to block his body.

“Boom!”

The lotus flower exploded on Yan Guiyi’s body, and a terrifying airwave instantly spread out in all directions!

The terrifying power even caused the entire island to shake slightly, and that space instantly turned into a sea of fire!

The flames soared into the sky and entered everyone’s sight.

Yan Guiyi was engulfed by the sea of fire, and nothing could be seen clearly.

Qin Yu panted heavily, and his expression was ice-cold.

This was the second time he had used the Spiritual Fire Seal, and the last time was when he was fighting Meng Wuxiong.

This technique consumed a lot of energy, so Qin Yu wasn’t willing to use it easily.

However, other than the spiritual fire, Qin Yu couldn’t think of any other way to hurt Yan Guiyi!

The crowd froze, and everyone’s eyes were fixed on the sea of fire.

As the aura and flames rushed toward them, everyone could feel the scorching waves of fire.

“Ah!!”

At this moment, a figure rushed out of the sea of fire.

His right arm was swallowed by the flames, and it looked extremely painful.

Not only that, the flames didn’t stop there. Instead, they spread towards his body!

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly furrowed, and a trace of solemnity flashed across his face.

Even after using two top-notch techniques, he still couldn’t kill Yan Guiyi.

This middle-stage Martial Marquis of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was indeed impressive!

The flames were still slowly engulfing Yan Guiyi. If this continued, Yan Guiyi would definitely die!

His face was already covered in tears, and a rarely seen trace of fear appeared in his eyes.

At this moment, Yan Guiyi gritted his teeth, as if he had made a decision.

With a furious roar, he grabbed his arm with one hand, then suddenly exerted force and tore off the arm wrapped in flames!

Blood immediately splattered everywhere. Without the support of the internal strength in his body, the arm that had been torn off was instantly burned into ashes by the spiritual fire.

Yan Guiyi’s expression was extremely ugly, and his eyes were filled with anger!

“You... actually destroyed one of my arms!” Yan Guiyi glared at Qin Yu. At this moment, his anger had reached its peak!

In all the years he had been in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, no one had been able to hurt him!

One arm was too much of a price for Yan Guiyi!

“Qin Yu... I will definitely tear you into pieces!!!” Yan Guiyi raised his head and roared as inner strength instantly burst out!

For a moment, the entire hall was shaking. Yan Guiyi’s anger made people tremble in fear!

“If I had been the one fighting him just now, I’m afraid my ending would have been even worse,” Yan Jinyao said in a deep voice.

“I didn’t expect Qin Yu to have such a spell on him,” Chu Heng also said in a deep voice.

Chu Hedao, who had been silent the whole time, said, “Qin Yu always creates miracles every time. No one should underestimate him.”

Chu Heng glanced at him and said, “It seems that you know him quite well.”

Chu Hedao didn’t say anything and silently walked to the side.

Not far away, Yan Guiyi became a one-armed man.

He clenched his fist with one hand, and all the inner strength gathered on his arm.

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn, and his body was shining with golden light. He was ready to fight Yan Guiyi.

“I really didn’t expect that the divine judgment technique and the Spiritual Fire Seal could only make him lose one of his arms,” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

“Stop watching the show. It’s time for us to make our move.” Yan Jinyao’s body flashed with purple light as he took a step forward.

The martial artists at the bottom class also took a step forward in unison. Yan Guiyi had lost an arm, which undoubtedly boosted their morale.

The battle between the two classes was about to break out at this moment!

The qi energy of both sides reached its peak at this moment!

“You bunch of d*mn ants, I’m going to kill all of you!” Yan Guiyi gnashed his teeth. He walked towards Qin Yu step by step.

“Rumble...”

Just as both sides were about to make their move, the ground suddenly began to tremble violently!

Following that, the Main Hall began to crack. A terrifying internal qi filled the entire Immortal Slaying Sect!

Everyone’s expressions changed slightly. In the face of this sudden turn of events, their expressions were somewhat solemn. After all, this was the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“Crack!”

Right at this moment, a terrifying killing force cleaved down from the sky!

This single strike had actually pierced through Yan Guiyi’s Black Gold Stone!

“Everyone, be careful!” When he saw this scene, Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change drastically as he hurriedly shouted!

A trace of fear flashed across Yan Guiyi’s face. He swept his gaze over everyone and said, “Hurry up and retreat. I’m afraid that the killing formation of the Immortal Slaying Sect has been activated. Hurry up and leave!”

At this moment, they couldn’t care less about their grudges.

Against the killing formation of the Immortal Slaying Sect, Martial Marquises had no chance of winning at all!

“Rumble...”

At this moment, another change occurred!

The gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect was slowly closing!

“Run!” Qin Yu shouted.

Everyone cast their spells and ran towards the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect desperately!

“Crack!”

Killing moves continued to erupt. Every strike was enough to pierce through the ground!

Qin Yu was halfway there when he suddenly thought of Chang Mang!

“Oh no, Chang Mang is still lying there!” Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change.

He gritted his teeth and turned around to go back and save Chang Mang.

“Mr. Qin, don’t go back. If you go back now, you won’t be able to make it out,” Yao Meng said in a deep voice.

“Qin Yu, hurry up and leave. If you are locked up here, you will definitely die!” The martial artists at the bottom class also hurriedly shouted.

Qin Yu glanced at the door that was about to close and then looked at Chang Mang, who was lying on the ground.

He gritted his teeth and said, “You guys go first!”

After saying this, Qin Yu immediately ran in Chang Mang’s direction. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He picked up Chang Mang and hurriedly ran in the direction of the door.

The door was about to close, and the murderous internal qi became more and more intense.

Except for Qin Yu and Chang Mang, everyone had successfully escaped from the Immortal Slaying Sect.

Qin Yu channeled all the spiritual power in his body and ran toward the door with all his might.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu found Yan Guiyi standing at the door while looking at Qin Yu coldly.

He channeled the light in his hand, and a creepy smile appeared on his face.

“Qin Yu... you can stay here!” Yan Guiyi shouted!
