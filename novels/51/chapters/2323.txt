2324 Absolutely Not Accepted

Qin Yu once again circulated the Five Element and Eight Trigram Technique, and the Eight Trigram Formation in the void slowly rotated.

Suddenly, Qin Yu seemed to have noticed something and punched directly at the empty space.

As the smoke and dust settled, a figure stood there smiling.

“You’re indeed quite capable and actually found me.”

Huan Tian patted his round belly.

“Stop deducing my location. My Primordial Heavenly Divination’s attack methods are not good, but my divination of heavenly secrets is very strong.”

“You can try, and I’ll definitely make you wish you were dead if you let me see you.”

Qin Yu said softly. Hua Tian had used bloody methods to kill people on the Heavenly Origin Continent, taking pleasure in killing people, and now, he was ruining his plans.

At this moment, Qin Yu was filled with anger. He would use a lightning strike to kill this person if he were to deduce his location.

“Don’t get agitated. I left behind this image to represent my goodwill. You’re a person with great cosmic luck, so I don’t want to be your enemy.

“Therefore, I’ll give you a piece of information. Situ Haoyue could live for two Path of Heaven years because he obtained a piece of Vermillion Bird’s flesh in the ninth level.”

Huan Tian smiled and said.

“This is the information I obtained after eating him. You can break the curse of the Nirvana Body if you can obtain the Vermillion Bird’s blood essence, and from then on, the Nirvana Body will soar to the sky without any shackles and resist the Path of Heaven.”

“What do you think?” Huan Tian patted his belly. “I’m being sincere with this news.”

“Is what you said true?”

Qin Yu looked unsure.

“Believe it or not, hahaha, but let me remind you that the Vermillion Bird’s blood essence is not easy to obtain.”

Hua Tian laughed maniacally as his figure slowly disappeared.

It was a technique similar to the evil exterminator’s projection technique that could not capture the location of the true body at all.

“Master, are you lying to him? He’ll be tortured when he enters the ninth level, even if he doesn’t die. At that time, we can kill him in one fell swoop.”

“Who said I was lying to him? He can easily deduce whether my words are true or false with his current cultivation realm. It’s meaningless to lie to him.

Hua Tian revealed a smug expression before him.

An enormous compass gave off countless information as his hand slowly slid past it.

In the end, without exception, the images displayed were all of Qin Yu’s death.

“I am the Son of Cosmic Luck of this world. The others are only providing nourishment for me.”

Huan Tian laughed wildly.

…

At this moment, inside Qin Yu’s Sumeru ring.

Jue Wu’s body exploded with massive qi energy, and her body floated in the void of the Sumeru ring.

As she punched out, the Sumeru ring suddenly shook violently.

Qin Yu was tremendously shocked.

The Sumeru ring had become incomparably stable. Even if he wanted to shake the Sumeru ring, he probably could not do it without using the divine sense spirit bead.

However, Jue Wu’s attack had such terrifying strength.

He released Jue Wu from the Sumeru ring.

“Whoosh!”

Almost simultaneously, a green stream of light followed Jue Wu and appeared at her back.

The demonic egg!

At this moment, the internal qi that Jue Wu emitted was still continuously strengthening. In a short period, she had broken through to eighth grade.

She reached the ninth grade straight away. The punch in the Sumeru ring was probably not her limit.

It was even more terrifying than Situ Haoyue’s Fist of Star.

However, what made Qin Yu’s heart heavy was that Jue Wu’s breakthrough did not offset the death qi in her soul.

The death qi seemed to have become even stronger as she broke through.

Her entire soul was completely gray as if she would die at any moment.

“Is it because of this demonic egg? This demonic egg was definitely related to the ghost realm and the monster realm. Furthermore, as the connection between Jue Wu and the demonic egg deepened, Qin Yu soon discovered the death qi in Jue Wu’s soul.”

Desolate divine eye.

On Jue Wu’s body, vitality slowly flowed into the demonic egg.

And the demonic egg was also feeding back, emitting traces of internal qi to feed Jue Wu.

However, the demonic egg was absorbing Jue Wu’s precious life and death.

“You’re courting death!”

A cold light flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes, and his power of divine sense transformed into a terrifying dagger and was about to cut off the connection between the two.

However, after a shock, the attack actually split into two equal forces.

And they flowed into Jue Wu and the demonic egg respectively. Jue Wu suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

“D*mn it! The two are completely connected.”

In the world of the desolate divine eye, Jue Wu’s soul had completely fused with the demonic egg.

It could be said that a person and an egg were one, and they could not be separated at all.

The Five Element and Eight Trigram Technique.

Qin Yu unleashed the technique again and started deducing again.

However, no matter how he deduced, Jue Wu’s only way to survive was to obtain the Vermillion Bird’s blood essence.

“We can’t delay any longer.”

Qin Yu suddenly withdrew his divine sense.

“Ji Yue, help me find the information about the Vermilion Bird in the ninth level of purgatory!”

“What? Are you crazy? Wait for me. I’ll come and look for you right away.”

“Forget it. I’ll go to Solitary Cloud City to look for you.”

Qin Yu thought for a while and decided to return to Solitary Cloud City first.

When he returned to the Moon Listening Pavilion, Ji Yue was already waiting for him in the main hall.

“Do you know something? Tell me everything.”

“The Vermillion Bird is located nearly in the center of purgatory. Are you going to die? That’s a place that even the evil exterminator dares not go.”

Ji Yue’s face turned pale, and her hands trembled.

“I’ve already deduced that there’s a slim chance of survival there, but I must go.”

“Qin Yu, do you know the concept of the four great divine beasts? They’re the demonic beasts that fight against the Path of Heaven. I don’t know why you are looking for out there, but your approach itself is foolish behavior, completely a means of self-destruction.”

Ji Yue scolded sternly. “Back then, during the battle at the ninth level of purgatory, even the Immortal Emperor was injured by her. Under the current Path of Heaven, the four divine beasts can use the power of tribulation without fearing the arrival of the Path of Heaven! Even if your cultivation has increased tremendously, going over is equivalent to self-destruction!”

She had invested a lot in Qin Yu and even thought Qin Yu could protect her when he grew up and developed in the future.

“I will do my best, but I must go now.”

Earlier, when Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu, he felt that Jue Wu’s vitality was already on the verge of death. That demonic egg seemed to be about to completely absorb Jue Wu’s vitality.

He absolutely could not accept watching Jue Wu die like this.

“Qin Yu, what she said is correct. Having you die in exchange for me, who is already dying, and with a 100% certainty that you can’t make it, I’ll not accept it even if I had to end my life.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jue Wu was not a fool. She had already deduced about 80-90% of their conversation.
