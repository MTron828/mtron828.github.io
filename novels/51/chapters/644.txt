Chapter 645: He Is Qin Yu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The battle prowess displayed by Qin Yu was obviously beyond their imagination.

They had never thought that Qin Yu’s physical body would be so powerful!

If they had gotten this information earlier, they wouldn’t be in such a sorry state now!

“If this continues, it might be disadvantageous to us,” the few people said coldly.

Qin Yu had the same thought in his heart.

The few sword moves he swung out were used to use a large amount of spiritual power.

Although Qin Yu could use his physical body to fight, at that time, he wouldn’t be able to use the Saintly Body Technique or the power of the Divine Dragon, and Shrinking Ground Into An Inch would also disappear.

More importantly, there was no telling if the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had any support!

The two sides looked at each other, as if they were testing each other.

“Everyone, if you can’t kill him, then trap him!” At this moment, the few of them seemed to have made up their minds.

In the next second, they took a few steps back! Then, the few of them whispered at the same time, as if they were casting some kind of spell!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time. He took a deep breath, then his feet shook, and the Heavy Falling Space instantly spread out!

“I must kill them in the shortest time possible,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He strode forward toward these people!

Under the influence of the Heavy Falling Space, their speed was greatly restricted. They were far from being on par with Qin Yu!

Golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body, and his pair of iron fists carried a great sense of oppression!

“Go to hell!”

Just as Qin Yu was about to make his move, the golden bowl suspended in mid-air suddenly exploded with a ray of light!

The golden bowl suspended in mid-air grew larger and larger, and from high above, it covered Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He wanted to use Shrinking Ground Into An Inch to escape, but he realized that he couldn’t break free at all!

A few rays of light condensed under Qin Yu’s feet once again before firmly wrapping around Qin Yu’s body!

The golden bowl covered Qin Yu, and the bright light began to converge on the top of Qin Yu’s head!

“Boom!”

Finally, the golden bowl fiercely pressed down on the ground while raising waves of dust!

Seeing this, the few of them finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“Trap him here, then bring him back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” the few of them said coldly.

They glanced around. In this battle, three of them were actually seriously injured!

“Bang!”

At this moment, a loud sound came from the golden bowl!

“Bang!”

Before they could react, another loud sound came from the golden bowl!

“He won’t break this golden bowl, will he?” Someone frowned.

“Don’t worry. This golden bowl is as hard as Black Gold Stone. It’s impossible to break it.”

Qin Yu kept throwing punches at the golden bowl.

Although the golden bowl appeared to have collapsed, it didn’t show any signs of collapsing.

Looking up at the huge golden bowl, Qin Yu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

Then, Qin Yu’s palm shook, and he took out the bronze sword again!

“There’s no disk to protect their bodies now, right?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu held the sword with both hands, and rays of bright light condensed on the bronze sword!

“Nine Taiqing Slashes, third slash!”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and all his spiritual power was injected into the bronze sword!

A terrifying sword light rose up, and slashed across the golden bowl from top to bottom!

Then, a sword mark appeared on the golden bowl!

“What... What is this?” The expressions of the black-gold robe powerhouses couldn’t help but change!

Before they could react, the crack burst out with brilliance, and the entire golden bowl was actually split into two halves!

“It’s broken! The golden bowl is broken!” Seeing this scene, they immediately panicked!

Qin Yu jumped out of the golden bowl!

He held the bronze sword in his hand while panting.

It was obvious that Qin Yu was already exhausted.

“I can’t continue fighting. I have to escape as soon as possible.” Qin Yu glanced around.

Without the golden bowl, the surrounding light naturally disappeared.

Qin Yu glanced at them coldly, then turned around and left!

He quickly disappeared from their sight.

These black-gold robe powerhouses didn’t dare to chase after him. They only looked coldly in the direction where Qin Yu escaped.

“We actually let him escape,” one of them said coldly.

“It’s not our fault. No one expected that this person not only had excellent swordsmanship, but also an unparalleled body.”

“Let’s go back first and report this situation to President Qu.”

The few of them looked at each other. They helped the injured people up and left the place.

...

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Xia Hang was sitting in his office while feeling uneasy.

He kept drinking tea, and his eyes looked out from time to time.

At this moment, the few black-gold robe powerhouses appeared in Xia Hang’s field of vision!

He quickly stood up and went out to greet them.

“How is he? Is he dead?” Xia Hang asked anxiously.

The few of them just looked at Xia Hang coldly and didn’t say anything.

“What’s going on? Is he dead?” Xia Hang asked anxiously.

The few of them ignored him and strode toward Qu Xie’s office.

Xia Hang had no choice but to follow closely behind.

They came all the way to Qu Xie’s office.

When he saw the severely injured people, Qu Xie couldn’t help but frown. “What’s going on? Did you catch the black-robed man?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“No,” they said coldly.

“What? No?!” Xia Hang immediately became anxious.

“Are you all trash?! So many people can’t even kill a single black-robed man?!”

The few of them looked at Xia Hang coldly and their eyes were filled with a strong sense of threat.

“President Qu, we underestimated this black-robed man. Not only does he have superb swordsmanship, but his physical body is also beyond imagination!”

“That’s right. This black-robed man used his fist to destroy the Black Gold Stone and even shattered the golden bowl.”

After Qu Xie heard this, he couldn’t help but frown. “His swordsmanship is amazing, but his physical body is also so strong? How is this possible?”

“But it’s true,” they said coldly.

“Also... This kid’s technique is somewhat similar to the late Qin Yu’s.”

“Both have golden lights, and both have tough bodies.”

“To be precise, this person’s prowess is above Qin Yu’s, and it far surpasses Qin Yu’s.”

“We suspect that... he is Qin Yu’s mentor.”

Qu Xie frowned tightly.

“Qin Yu... actually has a mentor! No wonder he has been targeting the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!” Qu Xie said coldly.

Xia Hang’s face was extremely pale.

He knew very well that if Qin Yu didn’t die, he would definitely guess that the ambush was related to him!

At that time, wouldn’t his daughter be killed?!

His expression was extremely ugly, and his mind was racing.

After hesitating for a long time, Xia Hang grabbed Qu Xie’s arm!

“Xia Hang, what are you doing?!” Qu Xie said unhappily.

Xia Hang said with a trembling voice, “President Qu, that black-robed man isn’t Qin Yu’s mentor. He... He is Qin Yu!”
