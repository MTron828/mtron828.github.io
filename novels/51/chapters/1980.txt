1981 Gu Xinghe’s Scheme

Yang Tong’s expression was tremendously cold. His eyes were about to spit fire.

Seeing this, Qin Yu took a sip of tea and said, “Quickly get lost. Don’t disturb my tea time.”

Yang Tong looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Kid, I’m inviting you out of goodwill. Please know how to appreciate it.”

“Didn’t I make myself clear enough? You’re inviting me? You’re not qualified. You old fellow, you really think too highly of yourself! Qin Yu cursed.

!!

No matter how good-tempered Yang Tong was, he couldn’t hold it in any longer.

“Little b*stard! I think you’re courting death. Do you think I won’t dare to do anything to you?” he said furiously.

Qin Yu stood up abruptly as well. He looked at Yang Tong coldly and said, “Old b*stard, if you have the ability, try and touch me. See if I don’t break your teeth off!”

Yang Tong’s body exploded with intense killing intent, and his internal qi was also tremendously mighty. An invisible sense of oppression rushed over.

Qin Yu’s body was emitted light, quietly resisting the internal qi.

The two forces were silently fighting against each other. Qin Yu was certainly not Yang Tong’s match and could only support his body with difficulty.

“I’ll ask you one more time. Are you coming with me, or do you want me to break your legs and take you back?” Yang Tong said coldly.

“I’ll also ask you one last time,” Qin Yu grinned and said. “Are you taking me back for investigation, or are you going to investigate if you’re your father’s biological son?”

“You!” Yang Tong was so angry that he almost vomited blood, but he understood Qin Yu’s intention. In the end, his reasoning calmed him down.

“Kid, you can’t be arrogant for long. The rules of Sky City will disappear sooner or later. You’re nearing your end,” Yang Tong said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, You should also cherish the remaining days. From your look, you should not be far from death.”

Yang Tong knew he couldn’t win the argument against Qin Yu. He snorted coldly and left with his men.

After he left, the cultivators in the Great Hall no longer said anything else.

Even Yang Tong had suffered a loss, not to mention them.

At night, Jue Wu returned with glory.

She had destroyed the majority of the Si family’s properties with her violence.

Although Jue Wu’s actions were considered to have violated the rules of the royal family, the prince pretended to be ignorant and only symbolically sent someone to punish Jue Wu. It was not a big deal.

In the following few days, Jue Wu and Qin Yu behaved the same.

Qin Yu no longer stayed in the Imperial Palace. He strolled on the street, not taking the people from the aristocratic families seriously.

Five days passed in such a way, but there was still no action from the auction house.

“Strange.” Qin Yu touched his chin. “These people are really patient.”

Jue Wu muttered, “Yeah. Why am I feeling what we’re doing is useless? They can rebuild what has been destroyed at any time, not to mention these people have long taken the treasures away. Thus the loss is not big.”

“That makes sense.” Qin Yu nodded and rubbed his head. Suddenly, he had an idea and said, “Tomorrow, you accompany me to the Si family’s gambling house. You have better luck than me. And with my desolate divine eye, they will definitely suffer heavy losses.”

“Okay. I’ll try, but I can’t guarantee anything,” Jue Wu agreed.

“It’s fine. They can’t fake anything in the gambling house. After all, they can’t see through the natural ore themselves,” Qin Yu said.

Therefore, the two hit it off and decided to do it.

The following day, Qin Yu and Jue Wu came to the Si family’s gambling house.

To the nine great aristocratic families, gambling houses were one of the most important sources of income. They could be found everywhere in the Holy Region.

And Sky City Gambling House was the biggest gambling house of the aristocratic families.

When Qin Yu and Jue Wu arrived at the gambling house, it was full of people. The appearance of Qin Yu and Jue Wu instantly made everyone somewhat nervous.

They subconsciously stepped back and gathered together. As for the people from the gambling house, they quickly walked out and blocked the two people outside the door.

“What are you guys trying to do?” one of them asked coldly.

Jue Wu waved her fist and said, “I will do whatever I want. It’s none of your business!.”

“I’m warning you. You’d better not cause any trouble here.” At this moment, the person in charge of the gambling house walked out of the dark.

With a wave of his hand, the entire gambling house began to emit a strange light.

The light was dense and covered the gambling house.

Under this internal qi, Qin Yu was surprised to find the spiritual power in his body seemed to have frozen, and he could not use it at all.

“It looks like the Si family values this gambling house very much,” Qin Yu touched her chin and mumbled. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Thinking of this, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. We’re just here to try our luck. Why? Can’t we come to the gambling house?”

“Try your luck?” the person in charge sneered and said. “You want to gamble stones? Do you have money?”

“Are you looking down on me?” Qin Yu smiled. With a wave of his hand, he took out the card and said, “There’re tens of billions inside.”

The person in charge took over the card from Qin Yu’s hand suspiciously, then sent a wisp of divine sense into it.

True enough, tens of billions were on the card.

“Can we go in now?” Qin Yu said.

The person in charge snorted slightly and returned the card to Qin Yu. Then he said, “You can go in. But I’m warning you, don’t cause trouble here.”

“Don’t worry, we’re all good people,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

After that, Qin Yu pulled Jue Wu and walked into the gambling house.

The person in charge looked at Qin Yu’s back and said coldly, “Keep an eye on him. Don’t let them cause any trouble.”

“Yes.” The two cultivators nodded and then followed behind Qin Yu.

During this time, Yang Tong and Gu Xinghe were meeting up on a mountain peak outside Sky City.

...

“This Qin Yu is trying to force us to make the first move and break the rules,” Yang Tong said coldly.

Gu Xinghe was not surprised. With his hands behind his back, he said indifferently, “He and I came from the same place. In our world, if you want to survive, you must master some skills.”

“So?” Yang Tong looked at Gu Xinghe.

“When it comes to playing tricks, I’m on par with him,” Gu Xinghe said indifferently. “When it comes to being despicable, even ten of him wouldn’t be a match for me.”

“Say it if you have something to say.” Yang Tong was obviously somewhat impatient.

Gu Xinghe looked at Yang Tong and said, “Didn’t Qin Yu cause a scene in Sky City? Then you can just lure him out of Sky City.”

“Aren’t you talking nonsense? He’s not stupid. How would he leave Sky City?” Yang Tong berated.

“I knew he would do this,” Gu Xinghe said with a smile. “So I’ve long prepared for this.”

He waved his hand, and a few figures appeared in front of him.

“I’ve sent people and located them. Send a few people over to bring them here and force Qin Yu to leave Sky City,” Gu Xinghe said indifferently.
