Chapter 238: Tempered Body 531 Times! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yao Qing didn’t know when the body tempering session would end.

In the blink of an eye, it was already night time.

And at this time, Qin Yu had already rebuilt his body 531 times! It had exceeded the highest record by more than 400 times!

“It isn’t over yet...” Yao Qing looked at Qin Yu in a daze.

At the 532nd time, all the bones in Qin Yu’s body turned white!

And his skin was flashing with a golden light!

This light was brewing on Qin Yu’s body, like a bomb that was about to explode!

“Boom!”

Finally, after the 533rd time of body tempering, the light on Qin Yu’s body burst open!

An intense power burst out, and the terrifying force thrust Yao Qing, who was sitting on the ground, into the air!

Qin Yu’s body had already reached an incredible state!

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes and his eyes filled with puzzlement, he looked around.

Yao Qing hurriedly got up from the ground and arrived in front of Qin Yu in a few steps.

He stared at Qin Yu and said excitedly, “Mr. Qin, do you know how many times you have rebuilt your body?”

Qin Yu looked at his own body and guessed in a low voice, “A hundred times?”

Yao Qing hurriedly shook his head and said, “Far more than a hundred times!”

Far more than a hundred times?

Could it be that he was close to the highest record?

Or... he broke the highest record?

“150 times?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Yao Qing could no longer hold it in and shouted, “A total of 531 times! This is too unbelievable!”

“What?!” Qin Yu was stunned and couldn’t help but be shocked!

More than 500 times of body tempering? How was this possible?

“You... Are you speaking the truth?” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

Yao Qing hurriedly nodded and said, “It’s absolutely true! Mr. Qin, you really are a genius!”

This time, even Qin Yu’s face showed a frenzied look!

He looked at Yao Qing and said, “Yao Qing, use your full strength and attack me.”

“Huh?” Yao Qing was stunned.

“I want to test the strength of my physical body,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

When he heard this, Yao Qing hurriedly nodded his head.

He summoned his inner strength and used all his strength to ruthlessly punch at Qin Yu! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Clang!”

Yao Qing’s hand bones were shattered and his body was sent flying!

Qin Yu stood there without moving and not even a white mark was left!

Qin Yu frowned. He turned around and returned to his room. A moment later, Qin Yu came out with a bronze sword.

Qin Yu threw the bronze sword in front of Yao Qing and said slowly, “Try it with this.”

Yao Qing nodded and picked up the bronze sword. Then, he took a deep breath and swung it at Qin Yu with all his strength!

“Clang!”

There was another crisp sound!

Yao Qing’s thumb and forefinger were shaken so forcefully that they were bleeding. The bronze sword in his hand also fell to the ground!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s body was still not injured in the slightest!

With such toughness, even Qin Yu gasped!

“This is too over the top...” Yao Qing couldn’t care less about the pain in his wrist as he stared blankly at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was excited.

With this body and his Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, Qin Yu was bound to obtain the Divine Medicine!

“Fortunately, Dong Tianhai was ignorant.” The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth curled into a sneer.

Comparatively speaking, the value of this Nine Transformation Golden Pill far exceeded the value of five hundred years worth of herbs!

...

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed.

There were only two days left until the Divine Medicine would be released.

And on this day, the big families of the Jiang Bei region all came to Bai City.

The already prosperous Bai City was even more crowded these few days.

Even the local economy was rapidly boosted, and the prices of hotels rose day by day.

In the Jiang family’s home, a tea set was placed in front of Jiang Gu. He stood up personally and poured water for the people in front of him.

“Jiang Gu, I heard that you lost to a thirty-year-old young man?” An old man in front of him said indifferently.

This old man’s name was Chen Meng, and he was the famous patriarch of the Chen family of the Jiang Bei region. His strength had even reached the third level of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm!

Jiang Gu said politely, “I did lose to Qin Yu, and I was completely convinced.”

“Hehe, did you lose to Qin Yu, or did you lose to the family supporting Qin Yu?” Another old man beside him said with a nonchalant smile.

This person’s name was Zhang Hua, and he also had an extremely high position in the Jiang Bei region.

Jiang Gu said with a bitter smile, “You two must be joking. I am not a match for Qin Yu.”

“Chuzhou has always been a place where the martial art world’s strength is weak. However, we would never have thought that such a young man would dominate the huge Chuzhou. What a joke.” Chen Meng said with a cold smile.

Jiang Gu remained silent.

Although the Jiang family was one of the top families in Chuzhou, in the entire Jiang Bei region, the Jiang family was nothing.

“Let’s get down to business. Jiang Gu, why did you call us here?” Chen Meng said seriously.

Jiang Gu was silent for a moment, then said, “I think the two of you are here for the Divine Medicine. There are definitely many people who are coveting the Divine Medicine, and there are even top martial artists among them.”

“So?” Zhang Hua raised his eyebrows.

Jiang Gu quickly cupped his hands and said, “There are too many strong enemies. Maybe we should join forces.”

“Join forces?” When he heard this, Zhang Hua and Chen Meng laughed at the same time.

“No way, Jiang Gu. Even you covet this Divine Medicine?” Zhang Hua snickered.

Chen Meng, who was at the side, sneered. “You’re just a newly advanced Inner Strength Grandmaster. What right do you have to snatch this Divine Medicine?”

Faced with the ridicule of the two people, Jiang Gu was angry, but didn’t dare to say anything.

He braced himself and said, “With the Jiang family’s ability, I naturally don’t have the right to cooperate with you two. However, we’re old friends after all... and I’ve helped the two of you before...”

When he heard these words, Chen Meng’s expression immediately turned cold.

Zhang Hua, who was at the side, narrowed his eyes and said, “Jiang Gu, you’re so old, yet so naive. If you keep bringing up old favors, it will become enmity. Don’t you understand this logic?”

“Old friends? In the face of benefits, how can there be any friendship?”

Jiang Gu’s expression changed slightly.

He had guessed that these two people might reject him, but he didn’t expect that they would reject him so bluntly.

“Jiang Gu, we can give you a chance.” At this time, Zhang Hua changed the topic and said indifferently.

Jiang Gu hurriedly bowed and said, “Thank you, Mr. Zhang!”

“Don’t be in a hurry to thank me.” Zhang Hua said indifferently.

“We aren’t cooperating with you, but with the King of Chuzhou, Qin Yu.”

“Since you lost to Qin Yu, Qin Yu’s ability must be above yours.”

Chen Meng nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. If Qin Yu is really that capable, we are naturally willing to cooperate with him.”

Jiang Gu was immediately overjoyed. He quickly stood up and said, “Okay, please wait a moment. I will call Mr. Qin right now!”
