Chapter 2543 The Primordial Chaos Punch

This attack was stuck right before the God-slaying Dusk landed on the ground. The timing was perfectly right.

“Death Godly King! Draco!”

Qin Yu’s eyes were about to spew flames. Under this attack, some of the army in his hands would surely die.

However, he was interrupted by the Death Godly King observing in the depths of this place. The power of dusk pushed him away.

Just as he was about to pursue and attack, he suddenly sensed something.

In the void, a ball of flames plummeted down forcefully.

Qin Yu clenched Evil Eye horizontally, blocking the meteorites from falling from the sky.

After the meteorite fell onto the ground, countless lava and gravel slowly gathered and squirmed. A flame giant stood up.

“Chief of Flame! You don’t look for it when there’s a way to heaven. There’s no door to hell, but you barge in!”

In this instant, Qin Yu’s killing intent condensed to the extreme.

“Xuan Xin, Xuan Tian, help me block the Death Godly King!”

Qin Yu roared.

A drop of extreme demonic elemental energy and devil’s elemental energy floated out of Qin Yu’s acupoint and slowly into his heart.

Along with the compression of the heart, the two forces shot into his dantian at a tremendously fast speed.

Primordial Chaos!

As the energy of the Primordial Chaos surged in his body, surges of terrifying sound waves emanated from his body. The sound was like a roar from hell and a low groan from a monster.

Qin Yu’s eyes were bloodshot, and her soul seemed to be about to split apart.

That terrifying power was as hard to control as a wild horse that had escaped its reins. In an instant, the soul seemed about to be torn apart.

In just a few seconds, the places the power of Primordial Chaos impacted, his skin, bones, and muscles turned into minced meat and separated from his body. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This power was no longer something that a human body could control.

“This is too reckless! His body was about to collapse! Prepare to use the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror to protect his soul!”

Xuan Tian roared. He stepped forward and prepared to attack.

“Meditation!”

Qin Yu let out an earth-shattering roar. His soul suddenly burrowed into his body.

Countless soul talons grabbed his body tightly and pulled back the separated minced meat onto his body in an instant.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu clapped his hands, and a terrifying palm wind directly turned Flame Demon’s body into nothingness.

Every trace of the palm wind was close to its limit and directly pierced through his body.

“Save me!”

The fear made Flame Demon’s fire tremble violently.

As long as a wisp of the soul could reach the magma, Flame Demon could quickly recover to its most formidable state despite its body being destroyed and its soul torn apart.

This was the terrifying aspect of Flame Demon.

Qin Yu let out an angry roar like a monster. Wherever the sound wave reached, sand and stones flew.

Along the way, countless mountains and swamps were turned into the most primitive powder.

He leaped high into the air.

The power of his stomping of feet caused the entire ground to sink hundreds of meters.

Qin Yu put his hands together and raised them high. The friction between his fists and the space resulted in a radiant blaze akin to the brilliance of the sun.

His entire body fell to the ground like a star.

Before the fist landed, a terrifying wind utterly blew and shattered thousands of feet of the ground. The entire Misty Forest was full of sand and stones, and the hurricane raged.

“Hurry up and stop him!”

Flame Demon screamed in horror. Its true body was now completely exposed.

Seeing the fist fall like a falling star, it felt the fear of death for the first time.

Throughout the long years, even amidst the most intense war among races or facing the mightiest adversaries in the past, it had never felt this close to death.

Behind him, a terrifying gust of wind tore through the air.

Two figures suddenly appeared behind Qin Yu. They were the Titan King and the Death Godly King.

Seeing Flame Demon facing death, they attacked again to interrupt Qin Yu’s powerful punch.

The Giant Titan raised his giant hammer high. The handle of the hammer contained a heavy force as if a huge mountain was pressing down on his shoulder. The surface of the massive hammer was full of cracks as if it had endured countless battles and impacts.

With a roar, the giant stepped forward fiercely and swung his giant hammer. The air whistled sharply as the massive hammer streaked across as if the sky was torn apart.

The impact of the giant hammer was like the power of destruction. With a strike, mountains collapsed, and earth and stones flew everywhere. The air was full of intense energy fluctuations, enveloping everything in a terrifying sense of oppression.

The terrifying force of the hammer smashed directly toward Qin Yu’s back.

Meanwhile, the Death Godly King’s black wings had already swept into the sky like dark clouds.

The massive black wings even blocked the entire moonlight. The scythe-like black wings, like flying knives, cut at Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu naturally felt the terrifying power as well. He gritted his teeth and completely ignored these two tremendous attacks.

However, if he did not seize this opportunity, he might not have another chance to kill the Fire Demon King!

Meditation! Ultimate defense!

At this moment, countless tentacles stretched out of his soul and grabbed his body tightly.

At this moment, he could not care less if he were to end up like He Teng, where his soul and physical body would fuse and lose the opportunity to advance in the future.

He directly unleashed the power of meditation to the extreme.

His body instantly emitted a dazzling light like an indestructible fortress.

The light contained immense energy, exuding an awe-inspiring internal qi.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s muscles and bones rapidly solidified, as hard as iron.

His skin visibly became extremely tough, like being covered with an indestructible protective shield. Even the sharpest sword or powerful force could not cause any damage to it.

His Glazed Holy Body’s most powerful spine also emitted a massive light.

As the strikes of the hammer and wing landed on him, his body resonated with a sound akin to the beating of war drums.

Titan stared at the broken hammer in confusion, unable to react for a while.

Even those at the fifth level, only a handful dared to face the force of his hammer strike.

Moreover, after taking on his and the Death Godly King’s attacks, this person did not halt his original attack, but he also borrowed the momentum to attack!

He accelerated and slammed onto the ground.

When his fists clashed with the ground, a shockwave visible to the naked eye spread out like a tidal wave out of the Misty Forest.

With this attack, countless dark living beings were killed straight away.

Countless gazes nearby landed on the Misty Forest. They did not know why such shocking fluctuation occurred in the forest.

Within the boiling lava river, numerous terrifying energies wrapped around its surface as it flowed.

As the shockwave completely engulfed the lava, it seemed to have lost its life force.
