Chapter 58: I Promise You Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Zheng Mingshuo stopped again.

He turned around and said politely, “Mr. Qin, is there anything else?”

Qin Yu stood up and returned the ginseng to Zheng Mingshuo.

Zheng Mingshuo was stunned and said with some fear, “Mr. Qin, what do you mean?”

Qin Yu said nonchalantly, “I promise you, and I guarantee that the Zheng Family Martial Arts School will win.”

“As for this ginseng, you can take it back. I’ll help you for free this time.”

Qin Yu had always hated the Lin family’s attitude.

In addition, Zheng Mingshuo’s attitude was very polite, which formed a sharp contrast with Lincheng’s.

Even if there was no ginseng, Qin Yu would help the Zheng family.

Zheng Mingshuo was stunned at first, then he said excitedly, “Mr. Qin, is what you said true?”

“Absolutely true,” Qin Yu said aloofly.

Zheng Mingshuo was immediately overjoyed. He reminded, “Mr. Qin, I heard that Lincheng has invited an inner strength expert. You must be careful.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu said aloofly, “I can crush him to death with one finger.”

A mere level one inner strength expert didn’t even have the right to fight back against Qin Yu.

Zheng Mingshuo bowed repeatedly and left Dragon Paradise.

The time was set for tomorrow, which Qin Yu looked forward to.

Ordinary people didn’t pay attention to the match between the two.

However, for some rich people and martial artists, this match was a big deal. Some people even started betting.

The Lin family and the Zheng family had been competing for many years. From the beginning, when Lincheng and Zheng Mingshuo fought, to later when their disciples fought, the Zheng family would lose every time.

But the Zheng family would never let go of any chance to compete with the Lin family.

Zheng Mingshuo believed that as long as he didn’t die, he would eventually be able to prevail

The next day, Zheng Mingshuo was prepared to send a car to pick up Qin Yu, but was rejected by Qin Yu.

He, Yao Qing, and Lance went to Jiangcheng City Stadium together.

Many people had already gathered in the stadium early on, and the tickets here were sold in the four figures.

Lincheng, Lin Wan, and the others had been waiting here for a long time.

“Qi Yang, you have to finish early. I still have to go shopping later!” Lin Wan said petulantly.

Qi Yang smiled nonchalantly and said, “What’s the point of shopping? I’ll take you to an upscale banquet after it’s over!”

“Wow, really?!” Lin Wan’s eyes suddenly lit up, and she said excitedly, “Thank you, Qi Yang!”

Lincheng, looking like a top-notch martial artist, sat at the side with his eyes slightly closed.

The local businessmen of Jiangcheng City walked up and greeted him frequently.

It could be seen that Lincheng had a very high status in Jiangcheng City.

“Master, Zheng Mingshuo is here,” Zhang Xing whispered in Lincheng’s ear at this time.

Hearing this, Lincheng immediately opened his eyes and looked at the door.

He smiled and said, “Let’s go and meet Mr. Zheng.”

Then, he stood up and walked toward Zheng Mingshuo with Qi Yang, Zhang Xing, and the others.

“Mr. Zheng, long time no see!” Lincheng shouted with a smile.

Zheng Mingshuo looked at Lincheng and cupped his hands politely as he said, “Mr. Lin, you’re here early.”

Lincheng smiled nonchalantly as he said, “Yes, I want to finish early and go home early. After all, everyone is busy.”

Zheng Mingshuo didn’t say anything about Lincheng’s provocation.

“Huh? Why don’t I see your disciple?” Lincheng looked around and his gaze fell on the sidekick beside Zheng Mingshuo.

“It can’t be this kid, right? From the looks of it, he probably can’t even take a punch, right?” Lincheng laughed loudly.

“You!” Zheng Mingshuo’s sidekick was instantly enraged. He was about to speak, but was stopped by Zheng Mingshuo.

Zheng Mingshuo smiled and said, “Mr. Lin, it’s indeed not him. My disciple hasn’t come yet.”

“Could it be that he doesn’t have the guts to come?” Lincheng sneered.

“It doesn’t matter whether he comes or not. In any case, he will lose.” Qi Yang smiled and said.

Zheng Mingshuo’s gaze fell on Qi Yang, then he smiled and said, “He’s Mr. Lin’s disciple, right?”

Lincheng said proudly, “That’s right! His name is Qi Yang, and he’s a level 1 inner strength expert!”

Zheng Mingshuo’s expression changed slightly.

It seemed that the rumors were true. Lincheng had indeed invited an inner strength expert.

“Mr. Zheng, do you think there’s still a need to fight?” Lincheng said with a smile.

Zheng Mingshuo said politely, “The outcome hasn’t been decided yet, so there’s no rush.”

“Hmph, there aren’t many people in Jiangcheng who can rival Qi Yang!” Lin Wan snorted at the side.

Zheng Mingshuo smiled. He looked at Lin Wan and said, “Miss Lin, you should be studying at this time, right? Why do you have the time to follow your father to watch the competition?”

Lincheng frowned.

Lin Wan was notorious in Jiangcheng for being pampered and spoiled. Everyone knew that Lincheng’s daughter was rebellious and had been expelled from many schools a while ago. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Obviously, Zheng Mingshuo was deliberately rubbing salt into the wound.

“I can go wherever I want. It’s none of your business, old man,” Lin Wan scolded.

Zheng Mingshuo burst into laughter and ignored the Lin family.

The few of them sat on the spectator stand while waiting for the match to begin.

In the blink of an eye, more than ten minutes had passed.

“Mr. Zheng, why aren’t your people here yet?” Lincheng said with a hint of mockery.

“There’s no rush. Perhaps there’s a traffic jam on the road,” Zheng Mingshuo explained.

“Hehe, is there a traffic jam, or are they afraid to come?” Lincheng sneered.

“Mr. Zheng, how about this?” At this moment, Qi Yang suddenly said.

“Since your disciple isn’t here, why don’t I fight with you?” Qi Yang clenched his fist.

“If you’re not my match, then your disciple doesn’t need to come.”

Zheng Mingshuo’s expression immediately became a little ugly.

Qi Yang was obviously humiliating him! Lincheng had sent a disciple to fight with him. Regardless of whether he won or lost, it would make people laugh their heads off!

“Hehe, it can’t be that you don’t have the guts to, right? This is only one of my disciples.” Lincheng ridiculed from the side.

Zheng Mingshuo’s expression was extremely unsightly. He didn’t care about the previous jab, but Qi Yang was dissing him way too outrageously!

“I...”

“Mr. Zheng, I’m sorry for being late.”

Just as Zheng Mingshuo was about to agree, Qin Yu’s voice suddenly sounded from outside the door.

Following that, Qin Yu brought along Lance, Yao Qing, and the others as they walked towards Zheng Mingshuo’s direction.
