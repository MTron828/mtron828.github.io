1893 Despicable Thing

Everyone looked at Qin Yu in surprise, with their eyes full of shock and confusion.

Although this group of people greatly admired the Gu family’s saintess, they only dared to watch from afar.

Not to mention Qin Yu’s loud shout, even looking at her once again seemed blasphemy to the goddess.

“Who is this kid? How dare he be so rude to the saintess?”

“He might be an admirer of the saintess. He’s a rude guy.”

“This guy is really bold. He dares to shout like this.”

The crowd was in a heated discussion, and some even glared at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was dumbfounded. He did not expect his shout to have caused such a big commotion.

It seemed that the influence of the saintess of the Gu family was much greater than he had imagined.

The crowd looked at Qin Yu and the Saintess Gu from time to time.

The man with the mustache was even more nervous. He said with a resentful face, “Who told you to shout? You got into trouble now. What if she comes over? I’ll see what you’ll do!?

“She will come over to see me?” Qin Yu laughed. “Why do you think so highly of yourself? She’s…”

“Holy sh*t! She’s coming!”

Before Qin Yu could finish his sentence, Chang Mang pushed him hard.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Saintess Gu was walking toward Qin Yu!

Her delicate feet did not touch the ground as if she was floating over. Her entire body was full of celestial aura, and countless people were fascinated wherever she passed.

“Saintest Gu is walking toward that kid!”

“D*mn it! Is Saint Gu going to see him? ”

“D*mn it! Why didn’t I shout just now?”

All of a sudden, countless people felt regretful.

Qin Yu didn’t think much of it. To others, Saintess Gu might be a high and mighty existence that couldn’t be offended. But in Qin Yu’s eyes, she was just a beauty.

Soon, Saintess Gu came to Qin Yu.

At such a close distance, the fragrance on her body became even more mesmerizing, and the internal qi she emitted was even more seductive to people’s souls.

“Were you the one who called me just now?” Saintess Gu looked at Qin Yu and said gently.

The surrounding people were even more furious when they saw this. They glared at Qin Yu, wishing they could skin him alive.

“That’s right. I was the one who called you,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Young Master, what’s the matter?” Saintess Gu opened her red lips slightly, and a trace of surprise was on her face.

“Nothing,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “I just called you casually. I just wanted to say hello to you because you’re pretty.”

Seeing Qin Yu’s frivolous look, the surrounding people were even angrier.

“Brat, be more polite to the saintess!”

“That’s right. If you dare to talk nonsense again, watch out, or we’ll pull out your tongue!”

“Quickly kneel in front of the saintess!”

“What a bunch of bootlickers,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

Saintess Gu wasn’t angry but said in surprise, “Chaotic body?”

“That’s right. I’m the incomparably powerful and the only chaotic body in the world!” Qin Yu said shamelessly.

In any case, people would find out sooner or later. Therefore, there was no need to hide it. It was better to admit it.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Saintess Gu couldn’t help but cover her mouth and chuckle.

“The only one in the world? What about Mr. Si?” Saintess Gu laughed.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “I don’t know any Mr. Si. I only recognize myself. I’m the one and only only existence!”

Saintess Gu laughed again.

She glanced at Qin Yu up and down, chuckled, and said, “You’re an interesting person.”

After saying this, Saintess Gu turned around and walked away.

The people who scolded Qin Yu just now ran over after Saintess Gu left.

“D*mn it. Brother, you’re amazing. You even hit on the saintess!”

“Brother, can you teach us? How did you manage to be so thick-skinned?”

“If I had your thick skin, I might have gone to the Gu family to live off a woman. Who would still come out and run around?”

“F*ck you! You look like a pig. It’s useless even if your skin is as thick as the city wall.”

Qin Yu could not help but smile bitterly.

These people were a bunch of bootlickers. They were angry just now, but in the blink of an eye, they came over and regarded Qin Yu as their idol.

After dispersing the group of people, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache, who was sweating profusely and looked like he was about to run away at any time.

“Brat, what despicable things have you done to Saintess Gu? You’re so scared.”

“What could I have done? Besides, who’s scared… The man with the mustache waved his hand.

“You’re not scared? Alright. I’ll call her over.” After saying that, Qin Yu pretended to call out Saintess Gu again.

The man with the mustache quickly covered Qin Yu’s mouth. He glared at Qin Yu and said, “You b*stard! Shut up!”

...

“Are you going to tell me or not?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

The man with the mustache was helpless and stammered, “Back then, I stole underwear from her boudoir and was chased by her for thousands of stars…” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Is that true?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“Of course, it’s true!” the man with the mustache said with some pride.

“To be honest, I peeked at her bathing! If she caught me, she would have skinned me alive!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but give a thumbs-up to the man with the mustache.

This guy’s skin was thicker than he had imagined.

“I’ve told you everything. Can I leave now?” the man with the mustache said pitifully.

Qin Yu grabbed his arm tightly and shook his head. “That won’t do. I’m not interested in what you’ve done to her. You have to tell me how to get into the sanctum.”

“Brat, you don’t play fair, and you don’t keep your word!” The eyes of the man with the mustache were wide open as he said angrily.

Qin Yu didn’t want to argue with him. Without saying anything else, he wanted to take him to see Saint Gu.

...

The man with the mustache had no choice but to agree reluctantly.

He reached out his hand and took out a purple robe, then handed it to Qin Yu.

This robe looked extremely extraordinary, and there were traces of dao techniques slowly circulating it.

“What is this?” Qin Yu took it and said in surprise.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “It doesn’t matter what it is. In any case, this item allows you to go in and out alive.”

“You’re not lying to me, are you?” Qin Yu said suspiciously.

“Whoever lies to you is a son of a b*tch!” the man with the mustache said angrily. “Qin Yu, you don’t go too far!”

“I’m begging you for one last thing, just one thing!” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“What the hell is that? Speak!” the man with the mustache said angrily.

Qin Yu pointed at Chang Mang, who was not far away, and said, “Just this one isn’t enough…”
