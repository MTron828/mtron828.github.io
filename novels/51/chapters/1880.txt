1881 The Si Family’s Secret Technique

It was naturally the most eye-catching battle. The combat strength the two of them had displayed yesterday was incredibly shocking!

Of course, everyone was naturally more optimistic about Si Shiyu. After all, he had easily won with a strike yesterday.

“You won’t be so lucky today.” Nangong, whom Qin Yu had defeated, snorted coldly.

He had mixed feelings. He was hoping that Qin Yu would win so that he would not be embarrassed for admitting defeat. However, he was also hoping that Qin Yu would lose to redeem himself from yesterday’s humiliation.

Si Shiyu stood in the middle of the battlefield and looked at Qin Yu with his torch-like eyes.

“Come, let’s fight!” Si Shiyu shouted.

Of course, Qin Yu was not afraid. He snorted coldly and stepped forward, standing in front of Si Shiyu.

Their eyes met, and the collision of their internal qi started to cause the surrounding space to distort.

The powerful battle intent exuded by the two of them livened up and shocked everyone incredibly.

“Qin Yu, I hope you and I can have a good fight today, unleashing all of your skills,” Chu Shiyu said coldly.

“Don’t worry, ” Qin Yu said coldly. “I won’t hold back. I also hope you won’t waste time.”

“Certainly,” Si Shiyu shouted.

Following his explosive shout, the internal qi on his body began to grow even more vigorous!

The battle between the two parties was on the verge of breaking out. Everyone held their breath, not wanting to miss this earth-shattering battle.

Si Shiyu’s body exuded an extremely holy light. This light fused with his physical body and caused his body to look somewhat crystal clear.

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s body was shining with a golden light as if he was trying to compete with the sun and the moon!

“Make your move!” Si Shiyu took the lead and shouted!

Naturally, Qin Yu did not hold back. After a loud shout, with his feet stepping the line word formula, he swung his Golden Fist at Si Shiyu!

It was the extremely powerful and pure energy within Qin Yu’s body. It also contained Qin Yu’s incomparable battle intent!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, Si Shiyu also made his move. He stretched out his palm and transformed into the Divine Phoenix to receive Qin Yu’s fist.

The two parties collided fiercely, and they both retreated instantly.

The first collision between the two was a draw!

Seeing the scene, the surrounding people were terrified because a wisp of the internal qi emitted by the collision of the two just now could pierce through the void!

Qin Yu was not afraid. The battle intent on his body became even stronger, and the golden light was burning like a fire. It was incredibly terrifying!

Si Shiyu’s expression was calm. The rays of the light around him became even more holy. Each ray of light seemed to have merged with the Great Dao and was terrifying. He was like a fierce beast that was about to awaken.

Qin Yu’s fists transformed into spells and dao techniques. His moves were grand as he closed in on Si Shiyu.

At this moment, an exceptionally holy sound was emitting from Si Shiyu’s body. This sound was incredibly mysterious as if god was chanting. It was tremendously powerful!

Under this sound, Qin Yu’s body instantly trembled violently! He quickly cast the Saintly Body Technique to protect his physical body and the dao technique to safe guard the space between his brows to block the invasion by the sound.

Qin Yu took a step back. He looked at Si Shiyu in front of him and felt incomparably strange.

“What kind of technique is this?” Qin Yu was incredibly shocked but not afraid.

His body trembled slightly, and all the effects disappeared. He then cast the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch and blasted it toward Si Shiyu!

The earth crumbled in an instant, and the void continued to transform. Qin Yu’s unstoppable divine power pierced through everything instantly!

Si Shiyu backed off, but the light surrounded his body became even more dazzling and holy! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Boom!”

Qin Yu didn’t care about that. His fists opened and closed, and the power contained within was incredibly overbearing. It continuously repelled Si Shiyu.

Seeing this, the surrounding people exclaimed one after another as if they had not expected Qin Yu to have the upper hand in such a short time!

“It seems that this Qin Yu is not simple,” someone in the stands whispered.

“After all, it’s a chaotic body. We can’t underestimate it.”

Dean Lei stroked his beard, smiled, and said, “This is just the beginning. We can’t determine the outcome yet.”

No one doubted the abilities of the two. They fixed their eyes on the battlefield not to miss anything.

A battle of this scale might end in the blink of an eye. It might last for days, or the outcome might be determined in an instant.

Qin Yu’s Golden Fist became even more terrifying. All kinds of dao techniques were displayed on his arms. Countless immortal beasts appeared as if they were injecting mysterious power into him.

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu roared furiously, and the divine beasts were in and out. He unleashed his Golden Fist and punched in the direction of Si Shiyu!

Then, something shocking happened. The light on Si Shiyu’s body transformed into hundreds of dao techniques and then condensed into a terrifying gigantic hand, blocking Qin Yu’s fist again!

Qin Yu trembled in his heart and was incredibly frightened because he knew how terrifying the power of his punch was!

Before Qin Yu could figure out the origin of the gigantic hand, Si Shiyu’s palm had formed a yin-yang diagram!

“Eh?” Qin Yu frowned and was even more shocked.

“Is it the Si family’s life and death diagram?” At this time, Dean Lei said in surprise.

The Si family’s elder laughed and said, “That’s right! I didn’t expect Si Shiyu to have fully comprehended the Si family’s life-and-death diagram! No wonder the moves just now looked familiar!”

Hearing the Si family’s elder’s confirmation, Dean Lei was shocked.

It was an incredibly terrifying technique of the Si family, and it was no weaker than the top-notch technique of Thunder Courtyard.

“I’m afraid this battle will be difficult,” Dean Lei thought to himself.

Qin Yu didn’t look too good either.

Just now, Si Shiyu was actually unleashing his dao technique!

There was a yin-yang diagram on Si Shiyu’s body displaying life and death.

The life diagram would protect the physical body, while the death diagram contained the power of desolation, making people not dare to approach!

“We can start now.” Si Shiyu was incomparably domineering. He no longer dodged. Instead, with the power of the death diagram in his hand, he stepped toward Qin Yu!

At this moment, Si Shiyu’s eyes were bursting with golden light. His hands were displaying different powers. He was like a god of war, sweeping through everything!

Of course, Qin Yu was not afraid. He snorted coldly and immediately went up to them!

“Boom!”

A terrifying collision rang out. Si Shiyu’s palm landed on Qin Yu’s left shoulder while Qin Yu aimed his punch at Si Shiyu’s physical body!

It was an incredibly terrifying power. The collision between the two parties shattered everything in the surroundings.

If not for the secret technique’s protection on the bodies of the surrounding crowd, they would have been seriously injured from this collision.

Qin Yu’s left shoulder was bleeding from the slap, and his white bones were exposed.

Under the protection of the life diagram, a mysterious power circulated around Si Shiyu, and he instantly recovered his physical body.

Before Qin Yu could feel shocked, Si Shiyu had stepped forward again!
