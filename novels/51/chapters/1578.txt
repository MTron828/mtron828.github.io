Chapter 1579: Chapter 1,579, he TENG’s ambition 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

With this palm strike, elder Bai’s head instantly shattered and he fell to the ground, unable to get up.

Qin Yu walked in front of him and checked his breathing. He discovered that elder Bai was already dead.

“He’s dead,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The surrounding people sighed slightly. For a moment, they didn’t know what to say.

Qin Yu was also a little moved, so he did not choose to erase elder Bai’s primordial spirit. At the very least, his soul would not be destroyed.

Although reincarnation was only a legend, the entire cultivation world attached great importance to it.

After killing elder Bai, Qin Yu took out the remaining pills and handed them to Di Zun.

“Take these pills once a day,”Qin Yu said to Di Zun.

Di Zun took the pill and asked, “Master, are you leaving?”

“I’m not leaving. I Won’t leave until I get the news of the dance. Help me find a quiet room later,”Qin Yu said to Di Zun.

Di Zun quickly nodded and said, “Okay, no problem.”

Qin Yu nodded. He planned to take advantage of these few days to swallow the rest of the great Yue fruit.

......

As for the Huangji Buddha Flame, Qin Yu didn’t have any plans for the time being. This huangji Buddha Flame had too many uncertainties, so Qin Yu didn’t want to take the risk for the time being.

Then, Di Zun found a room for Qin Yu.

“Other than the news about Jue Wu, Don’t disturb me,”Qin Yu said to Di Zun.

Di zun nodded and said, “Don’t worry.”

After di Zun left, Qin Yu took out the remaining Big Yue fruit.

When he saw the big yue fruit, the image of Jue Wu appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

This made Qin Yu’s body emit a chill, and his face carried a bit of viciousness.

“I will definitely kill you...”Qin Yu clenched his teeth.

...

At this moment, the two godly monarchs still had not left the South Province.

They cast their gazes on Qin Yu.

Not long after Qin Yu left, they received the news.

The two of them used extremely powerful methods to secretly hide behind Qin Yu.

Such methods were extremely powerful, and even Qin Yu did not notice it.

“This Qin Yu will definitely become a threat to the northern lands in the future. We must get rid of him in advance,”one of the godly monarchs said coldly.

“That’s right. We couldn’t find an opportunity initially. We didn’t expect him to leave the northern borders.”The other godly monarch sneered.

The two of them were not in a hurry to attack. Instead, they planned to wait for Qin Yu to leave the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Ever since the last battle, they had a psychological trauma towards the heavenly cloud sect. They did not dare to attack rashly.

With their strength, they could look down on almost the entire southern region. However, there were two exceptions. One was the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, and the other was Xiao Hai.

In the Tianyun sect.

Qin Yu stuffed one big Yue fruit after another into his mouth.

The effect of the Big Yue fruit was even better than the Enlightenment tea, but it was not as obvious on Qin Yu, at least not as obvious as the absolute dance. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed, and there were not many big yue fruits left in Qin Yu’s hands.

There were dozens of big yue fruits, but not a single one was left. At this time, Qin Yu’s mental state had also been greatly improved.

Although it was not as exaggerated as a breakthrough, the effect was also beyond expectations.

After swallowing the last few great yue fruits, he stood up and left the room.

In the meeting hall, the deputy sect master’s body had already recovered a lot. Although his internal Qi was still unstable, at least he could move freely.

“Deputy sect master, should we consider taking back a portion of the people?”An elder suggested.

“Yes, many people from the northern lands have already entered the southern province. Now that the sect leader is not here, no one can guarantee that the northern lands will not attack us.”

“In the past few days, who knows how many people in the entire southern province have died at their hands. We also have to worry.”

The vice sect leader remained silent. In fact, he was also worried about this.

At this moment, a disciple suddenly ran in from outside.

“Deputy sect master, there’s a person outside who calls himself Teng men requesting an audience,”the disciple said.

When they heard the name Teng men, everyone in the room was somewhat shocked.

During this period of time, Teng Men’s fame was extremely great. It was rapidly expanding at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The current Teng Men was now the second most powerful sect in the southern region.

“What are they doing here...”the deputy sect master frowned.

After thinking for a moment, the deputy sect leader said, “Let him in.”

A few minutes later, a man in a black robe walked in.

On the black robe, there was a large golden word: Tengmen.

“Greetings, deputy sect leader.”The man cupped his hands to the deputy sect leader.

The deputy sect leader said in a deep voice, “What are you here for?”

The black-robed man smiled faintly and said, “I am under the orders of our sect leader to invite you to Tengmen sect for a chat.”

“A meeting with Teng sect? I don’t seem to know him.”The deputy sect leader frowned and said.

The black-robed man smiled and said, “There’s no need to know him. Our sect leader has said that he wants to discuss the great plan with you. I hope that the deputy sect leader can show his face.”

The deputy sect leader said with a cold face, “If he really wants to discuss the great plan, why doesn’t he come to Our Heavenly Cloud Sect? Go back and tell your sect leader that if there’s really something important, he can come to the heavenly cloud sect to see me.”

After hearing these words, not only was the black-robed man not shocked, he even said with a bit of arrogance, “Deputy sect leader, our sect leader has said that he hopes that you won’t be ungrateful. If you go, it will be good for you and the Tianyun sect.”

“Are you threatening me?”The deputy sect leader’s face immediately turned black.

“Hahahaha, you can understand it this way.”The black-robed man said without hiding anything.

The deputy sect master narrowed his eyes and said, “What if I don’t go?”

“If you don’t go, Teng Gate will make the heavenly cloud sect disappear completely!”The black-robed man said with a cold face.

“You’re courting death!”The deputy sect master immediately flew into a rage!

“No one has ever dared to threaten my heavenly cloud sect!”

The black-robed man was not anxious either. He said indifferently, “After experiencing this battle, the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s vitality has been greatly damaged, and your sect master is not on the Cultivation Mountain.”

“In other words, the current heavenly cloud sect has long been in name only. Once Our Teng sect launches a general attack, you guys won’t be able to hold on at all!”

The deputy sect master’s expression became even gloomier. He did not expect that Teng sect would be so rampant!

“With such a big appetite, aren’t you afraid that you won’t be able to eat?”

At this moment, Qin Yu walked in from outside.

The black-robed man glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You are?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He walked in front of the black-robed man, raised his hand and grabbed his neck. Then, he violently pulled off the black robe on his head.

“Why do you people like to wear a black robe? Is it shameful?”Qin Yu mocked.

A trace of panic flashed across the black-robed man’s face. He said angrily, “You dare to attack me? Are you courting death!”

“Attack you? I’m going to take your life!”

After saying that, Qin Yu waved his hand and smashed his head into pieces!

Qin Yu threw his corpse to the side. Just as he was about to speak, a figure suddenly floated out from the corpse.

This figure was none other than he teng!
