Chapter 452: Facing A Half-step Martial Marquis! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When facing Meng Wuxiong’s attack, Qin Yu didn’t show any expression.

He clenched his fist and went forward to attack.

“Clang!”

A loud sound instantly echoed throughout the entire room!

Meng Wuxiong’s body was pushed back several meters, and his fist was even shattered!

“Without a magic artifact, what qualifications do you have to fight with me?” Qin Yu sneered.

Meng Wuxiong gritted his teeth. He stood up from the ground and berated, “The few of you, attack together!”

“Yes!”

These people shouted and quickly rushed forward!

“Just in time!” Qin Yu sneered.

Qin Yu was no longer threatened by ordinary peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters.

After possessing the power of the Divine Dragon, his strength had already reached an incredible level!

Qin Yu swiftly executed the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, and his figure suddenly disappeared.

In the next second, he appeared in front of a person.

“Huh?” The other party was stunned. Before he could even react, Qin Yu’s palm was already approaching!

The Heaven Swallowing Technique was instantly activated, and surging power flowed along Qin Yu’s palm towards the dantian!

In a few seconds, this peak Inner Strength Grandmaster was sucked into a dried corpse!

The rest of the people were so frightened that their faces turned pale. They stood on the spot and didn’t dare to move.

“What... What kind of evil technique is this?!” Someone said with a trembling voice.

Meng Wuxiong’s expression wasn’t too good either. He never expected that a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster would be completely powerless in front of Qin Yu!

“Many thanks for the gift.” Qin Yu licked his lips like a devil.

In the next second, Qin Yu approached again!

In the blink of an eye, another Inner Strength Grandmaster was swallowed!

The remaining people were completely panicking. They looked at Meng Wuxiong, as if they were asking for help, and their eyes were filled with panic.

“Mr. ... Mr. Meng, save us!” The few people stuck close to Meng Wuxiong and they looked imploring.

Meng Wuxiong took a deep breath, looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “No wonder Mr. He is so cautious...”

Qin Yu sized up Meng Wuxiong and said indifferently, “Tell me the secret of your cultivation, and I will spare your life.”

“In your dreams!” Meng Wuxiong sneered.

“Qin Yu, since I can be the king of Dongchuan and keep the cultivation secret, do you think I don’t have the means to protect myself?!” Meng Wuxiong sneered.

Qin Yu crossed his arms and raised his eyebrows. “Oh really? It seems that you have a lot of secrets.”

Meng Wuxiong roared, “Qin Yu, you will pay the price for your arrogance sooner or later!”

After saying that, Meng Wuxiong stomped on the ground!

Then, he bit his finger, and drops of blood fell to the ground!

Formation patterns immediately appeared on the ground.

Countless formation patterns were densely packed together, and it seemed as if they contained a mysterious power.

The entire ground began to rumble, and even the mountains in the distance began to drop rolling boulders!

In the Water Rhyme Tower, He Teng was startled awake by this sound again.

His long and narrow eyes glanced to the side, and he said in a low voice, “As expected, the mountain protection artifact was used.”

“Rumble...”

Loud rumbles continued, and Meng Wuxiong’s face revealed a crazed expression.

As he felt the surrounding energy that was rushing over, Qin Yu’s face couldn’t help but reveal a trace of solemnity.

“Boom!”

Along with a loud sound, several rays of light suddenly appeared from the horizon!

The rays of light condensed in the sky and then turned into a ball!

This ball of pure energy entered Meng Wuxiong’s body! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In an instant, Meng Wuxiong’s internal qi began to climb rapidly!

He actually broke through the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm and advanced toward the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!

“What is this thing?!” The serious look on Qin Yu’s face deepened!

What kind of method did Meng Wuxiong use to forcefully raise his internal qi to the half-step Martial Marquis Realm?

Finally, the surrounding light began to disappear.

Meng Wuxiong’s internal qi also increased by a large margin.

He rubbed his fists and looked coldly at Qin Yu. He grinned and said, “Qin Yu, I know you’re very strong, but I don’t believe that you can cross realms to fight a half-step Martial Marquis!”

“Currently, I’m a true half-step Martial Marquis!”

As he looked at Meng Wuxiong, the solemn expression on Qin Yu’s face actually began to slowly disappear.

What replaced it was a trace of indescribable excitement and battle intent!

“Coincidentally, I also wanted to experience the power of a half-step Martial Marquis...” Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.
