Chapter 649: I Want to Save Her! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qu Xie said excitedly, “Young Master Yan, this method is naturally excellent, but... President Yan...”

Yan Sihai said coldly, “It’s impossible for me to agree.”

Yan Jinyao smiled and said, “Dad, you don’t have to be so resistant. I think you can agree to President Qu.”

“No!” Yan Sihai said angrily.

“How can the people of the Yan family be humiliated like this?!”

Yan Jinyao smiled and said, “Even if you refuse, don’t those aristocratic families still know about it? In fact, they have already understood it.”

Yan Sihai frowned slightly.

These words made some sense.

“Dad, if you believe me, you can agree to President Qu’s request,” Yan Jinyao said earnestly.

Yan Sihai was a little hesitant.

Yan Sihai had always been proud of Yan Jinyao.

Not only did he have extraordinary talent in martial arts, but he was also very efficient.

Qu Xie struck while the iron was hot. “If you agree, I can make the decision and give Young Master Yan three more chances to bathe in her blood!”

Yan Sihai glanced at Yan Jinyao, took a deep breath, and said, “Well, since my son has said it, I can promise you.”

“Thank you, President Yan!” Qu Xie was overjoyed. He stood up and cupped his hands.

After Qu Xie left, Yan Sihai asked with a sullen look, “Jinyao, why did you agree to it?”

Yan Jinyao said with a nonchalant smile, “Dad, didn’t you say that you can’t let the Jingdu Martial Arts Association enjoy the benefits alone? I think this is a good opportunity.”

“In fact, the major families don’t know the origin of the blood, but this time, they will know where the blood comes from!”

“To our Yan family, this is foulproof.”

Speaking up to this point, Yan Jinyao paused for a moment. Then, he narrowed his eyes and said, “The most important thing is... I really don’t like Yan Ruoxue!”

Ever since he learned that Yan Ruoxue had a powerful bloodline, Yan Jinyao had a strong sense of crisis at the bottom of his heart!

Therefore, he wished that Yan Ruoxue would die!

“That makes sense.” Yan Sihai nodded slightly.

“Alright, then we’ll do as you say.”

...

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association obtained the consent of the Yan family and immediately began to carry out their plan.

They first issued invitations to the various aristocratic families, such as the Zhuang family, the Kong family, the Chu family, and Yao Meng. They were all invited.

Apart from that, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association publicly released a statement on the forum:

We will publicly show everyone how to draw blood, as well as the source of the blood, at the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.

As for the people on the Martial Arts Forum, they didn’t know where the so-called blood came from.

But the Jingdu Martial Arts Association knew that the black-robed man definitely knew! Therefore, the statement didn’t need to be too detailed.

At this time, Qin Yu had already gone to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

He planned to stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion for a period of time to recuperate and recover from his injuries. At the same time, he would borrow the warehouse of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to cultivate.

However, Qin Yu had just arrived at the secret room when he saw the news on the Martial Arts Forum.

“Openly absorbing blood?” Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly dilated and he immediately stood up!

The Pavilion Master frowned and asked, “What’s wrong?”

Qin Yu handed the phone to the Pavilion Master and said through gritted teeth, “These bastards... Not only did they absorb Ruoxue’s blood, but they also wanted everyone to see it! They want to make Ruoxue suffer humiliation!”

The Pavilion Master said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, this is very likely a ruse. The purpose is to entice you to save her.”

Qin Yu glanced at the Pavilion Master and said, “I know, but... even so, I don’t have a choice.”

“If I don’t go, they will still carry out this project.”

“If I go... maybe I can save Ruoxue.”

The Pavilion Master shook her head and said, “That’s impossible. They will definitely make a perfect plan.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Pavilion Master, I have to go.”

“If I don’t go, they will definitely carry out the second and third round! They will definitely continue to torture Yan Ruoxue until I appear!”

The Pavilion Master opened her mouth, but there was nothing she could say.

Yes, Qin Yu was right.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association had already realized the relationship between the “black-robed man” and Yan Ruoxue. This was the only bait they could use to lure the black-robed man.

Therefore, if Qin Yu didn’t go this time, they would continue to think of ways to torture Yan Ruoxue until Qin Yu appeared!

“Qin Yu, think carefully. If you go this time, it’s very likely that you won’t be able to come back.” The Pavilion Master grabbed Qin Yu’s arm, and her expression was extremely grave.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Pavilion Master, I really have no choice. If I had a choice, I would rather die.”

“Moreover, I might not die.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

A plan arose in his mind.

The Pavilion Master knew that she couldn’t stop Qin Yu, so she didn’t say anything more.

After Qin Yu left, a trace of worry flashed across the Pavilion Master’s face.

“I can’t allow him to die like this.” The Pavilion Master frowned.

Then, she walked out of the secret room and said to the attendant, “Prepare a car. I need to go to the military district of Jingdu.”

“Yes, Pavilion Master.”

...

Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.

Qu Xie requested a Martial Saint weapon from the higher-ups.

He carried the Martial Saint weapon and personally escorted Yan Ruoxue.

Inside the prison, three black-gold robe powerhouses removed the tube from Yan Ruoxue’s body and brought her to a car.

Yan Ruoxue’s face was extremely pale and she looked extremely weak.

“What do you want to do?” Yan Ruoxue said weakly.

Qu Xie smiled and said, “Miss Yan, don’t worry. We won’t do anything to you. We just want to change a place for you.”

The car sped all the way to Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.

New equipment had long been prepared on the square of Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.

A round altar was placed in the center of the square. This would be the place where Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline was publicly displayed.

After arriving at Jingdu Martial Arts Academy, Qu Xie ordered everyone to hang Yan Ruoxue on the square.

Yan Ruoxue’s expression was extremely unsightly. As a young lady from a prestigious family, she naturally couldn’t accept being hung here in such a public place.

“Miss Yan, don’t worry. Those who will come today are all your acquaintances,” Qu Xie said with a smile.

Yan Ruoxue bit her red lips with her teeth and said in a low voice, “Qu Xie, you are despicable...”

Qu Xie laughed loudly and didn’t think much of it.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue, who was hanging on the round altar, and couldn’t help but sigh. “I have to say, Miss Yan is really a top-notch beauty.”

“Of course. As the number one beauty in Jingdu, she lives up to her reputation,” the assistant next to him said with a smile.

“It’s a pity that you don’t have good taste in men,” Qu Xie snorted. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

On the other side, Qin Yu was rushing toward the Martial Arts Academy.

“Without that prison, this might be my best chance to save Yan Ruoxue!” Qin Yu said coldly.
