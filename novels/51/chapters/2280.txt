2281 The Primordial Qi

Moreover, it was a coffin that involved nine ancient dao techniques. It was like having an exceptional woman suddenly appear amidst a group of men.

Qin Yu dared not hesitate. These people had just experienced a life-and-death battle, and their battle intent was already at its lowest point. It would be difficult to deal with them if they were stimulated again later. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Brother, thank you!”

He left a voice transmission for Xi Menn. Xi Menn had helped him a few times in the Mystic Realm this time. He did not understand why, but he had to return this favor if he had the chance.

His body instantly turned into a streak of light, leaving the seventh level of purgatory and rushing toward Solitary Cloud City.

Almost everyone was stunned and did not expect Qin Yu to leave directly.

Qin Yu’s current speed was almost instantaneous, appearing a thousand miles away. No one could catch up to him at all.

“What a tremendous speed. It should be a spatial supreme treasure, right?”

A cultivator said with his mouth agape.

“It must be. Forget it. This treasure is beyond my reach anyway.”

“That’s right. Since he escaped, it means his strength is not good enough. If we don’t give him a chance to react and attack him directly when we bump into him, we can definitely stop him!”

The cultivators discussed animatedly.

“Everyone, as I said, he can only stay in Solitary Cloud City. I suggest that everyone keep an eye on him. Once we have any information about him leaving the city, we should gather together. This kid is tremendously ferocious. Don’t look down on him because he’s only a fourth-grade True Saint. His strength might be on par with mine. Even I find it difficult to defeat him.”

Situ Haoyue said loudly.

“What? Even you find it difficult to defeat him! You must be joking, Mr. Situ.”

“Not only does this kid have the coffin of the masked woman’s nine lifetimes of comprehension, but he also has Suo Lin Divine Artifact at the peak of the tribulation. Therefore, he is tremendously difficult to deal with. However, his own strength is nothing more than that of a commoner. As long as we unite and work together, he can’t withstand the immense exhaustion even if he possesses divine artifacts.”

Gu Ming said sinisterly. He only wanted Qin Yu to be buried with his son Zong Yue.

“That’s right. Regardless of the coffin of nine lifetimes or Suo Lin Divine Artifact, they belong to the human cultivators. At the very least, they should be taken out for the human cultivators to comprehend together. How can we let a fourth-grade True Saint take them away?”

Under the instigation of the two, the surrounding cultivators began to feel stirred and started to discuss animately.

“Evil Exterminator, what do you say? It now depends on your attitude. If you agree with my point of view, then not only will Qin Yu have to hand over the masked woman, but he will also have to hand over the coffin of nine lifetimes and even Suo Lin Divine Artifact.”

Situ Haoyue stared at the evil exterminator and asked.

The attitude of the number one person of the largest sect, Evil Exterminator, was especially important. He stood up and said.

“When I fought the masked woman, I had wanted to force her to use a power that surpassed that of a True Saint to let the Path of Heaven kill her. That way, she would no longer have the possibility of reincarnation. I didn’t expect her to rather die than use the power of the tribulation. I feel that this masked woman wouldn’t die so easily.”

The evil exterminator’s body floated up, and he said indifferently, “If I ever deduce that the masked woman is related to Qin Yu, I will definitely kill him.”

After saying that, he straightaway left with Uncle Ling and Ling Yurou. He disdained gatherings like this, full of intrigue and scheming.

The evil exterminator in the air spat a mouthful of black blood. His internal qi was also fluctuating.

“Sect Master, are you alright?”

Ling Yurou said worriedly. With a slight move of her hands, green healing spiritual energy surged into the evil exterminator’s body.

“As expected of the masked woman. If not for the Path of Heaven that suppressed her forcefully, her eight Great Success Great Dao of rules would be sufficient to crush me. However, I gained a lot from this battle. It’s unknown who will win if we meet again.”

The evil exterminator wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said indifferently.

“Evil Extermination, I activated the Eye of Soul when the masked woman died in battle. At that time, a wisp of internal qi seemed to have entered Qin Yu’s body from the masked woman.”

Uncle Ling frowned and said.

“Did you see it clearly?”

The evil exterminator’s expression instantly became solemn.

“At that time, the aftermath of the battle was tremendous, and that wisp of internal qi was tremendously fast. I’m not too sure either.” Uncle Ling shook his head.

“Let’s return to the sect first. I’ll deduce it again when I come out of seclusion.”

The evil exterminator said calmly.

…

At this moment, in Solitary Cloud City.

Qin Yu returned to the Moon Listening Pavilion directly and entered the Sumeru ring.

He began to deduce the masked woman’s first path of nine lifetimes. His fingers continuously formed intricate hand seals, manipulating the lines of the way as if playing a musical instrument. A sense of primordial internal qi emanated from his body vaguely.

“How terrifying! It’s like an ancient beast! His strength would probably rise to a tremendously terrifying cultivation realm if he could really grasp the ancient rules.”

Elder Guai and Wang Feng stared at Qin Yu from the side. Even though it was a second deduction, it was similarly precious to them.

Even if they comprehended a trace of it, it would be of great help to their cultivation realm.

Time slowly passed, but Qin Yu was still stuck at the last step.

Situ Haoyue had interrupted him at the most crucial moment. Otherwise, he would definitely have been able to master this primordial dao technique.

It was truly too difficult to deduce the Path of Heaven solely relying on deduction. Qin Yu ultimately gave up after evolving it to the extreme.

His body floated into the sky above the Sumeru ring.

Qin Yu closed his eyes. Suddenly, he threw a punch.

He did not use any chaotic qi in this punch, but the top of his fist was filled with a profound aura of a distant era.

That internal qi carried an earth-splitting aura. Just a trace of the power seemed to have a tremendously terrifying might.

“Qin Yu, quickly stop! We can’t stand this aura anymore.”

Elder Guai shouted loudly. Cold sweat was dripping down his body. That kind of might was completely different from the power of annihilation.

“Sorry, I got carried away for a moment,” Qin Yu smiled embarrassedly and said

“What a terrifying might. I tried to sense that internal qi just now, and my divine sense nearly collapsed directly. That was the primordial qi from ancient times. At that time, only the most ferocious species could survive. This fiendish aura was an internal qi that only the king who stood at the top possessed. Qin Yu, you must think of a way to deduce this power of rules.”

Elder Guai was shocked.

“Is it that powerful?” Qin Yu was stunned.

Even he did not feel that this aura was so terrifying. Elder Guai pointed upward and said.

“Have you forgotten that this is inside the Sumeru ring? In the outside world, the Path of Heaven today is powerful. The more ancient the Path of Heaven is, the deeper it’s suppressed. That was why you don’t find it terrifying.”

“When does the Path of Heaven have a cycle? What’s the situation of the Path of Heaven today?”

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground and asked Elder Guai humbly.

Although Elder Guai’s strength was not as strong as Gu Ming’s, he had lived for a much longer time.

“The Path of Heaven is like the tides, rising and falling. The Holy Region has always been at the peak of the tides, which means that more complete rules had descended.
