2102 Chaotic Black Hole? Not Worth Mentioning!

At the foot of Mount Phoenix, this powerful air current destroyed numerous trees, They seemed to be swept up by an enormous hurricane, and countless leaves danced in the air, forming green whirlwinds.

The earth began to tremble under the impact of these two powerful forces. Huge cracks spread on the ground like dragons roaming on it. The ground was shaking continuously, and huge rocks were flipping over from the ground as if countless giant beasts were churning underground.

The people at the foot of the mountain were shocked by the power of this battle. They retreated one after another and left the battlefield. Their faces were full of fear. They did not dare to imagine what would happen to them if they were on the battlefield.

Even the elders were ashen. They circulated their true energy with all their might attempting to stabilize the space of Mount Phoenix. However, their strength was very weak in the battle between Qin Yu and Yao Xi.

In the center of the battle, each of Qin Yu’s punches was full of immense power. Every time he swung his fist, a golden light would shoot out from his fist, tearing through space and rushing toward Yao Xi.

Yao Xi was unwilling to appear inferior. Every single one of his counterattacks was full of endless darkness. It was a power that could devour everything, causing fear in people’s hearts.

The great battle was escalating and clearly reached a tremendously intense and crucial stage. Even though Qin Yu was fighting with all his might, under the augmentation of the Emperor Shadow Technique, Qin Yu was in an increasingly sorry state!

If not for Wu Ji’s divine robe, Qin Yu’s physical body would probably have been pierced through long ago! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

It was also due to Wu Ji’s divine robe that Yao Xi could not do anything to Qin Yu for a while!

He was not a True Saint, so he naturally could not directly wipe out Qin Yu’s primordial spirit. However, he failed to cause an impact on Qin Yu’s physical body by relying on technique, so he was in a deadlock for a moment!

“Wu Ji’s divine robe is indeed terrifying,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Relying on this divine robe, Qin Yu even planned to drag this Yao Xi to death!

Once his Emperor Shadow Technique disappeared, Qin Yu would absolutely not be afraid of him!

In this stalemate, Yao Xi’s eyes flickered with a cold, sinister light. He knew that he could not let this battle continue. He had to finish off Qin Yu as soon as possible.

Yao Xi’s hands began to swiftly form a seal, and an even more powerful dark power began to gather around him. This was his trump card, a technique he called the “Chaotic Black Hole.”

The Chaotic Black Hole could devour everything. It had something in common with Xiao Sheng’s Rashomon!

“Since I can’t kill you, I’ll dump you into the void and make sure you’re condemned to eternal damnation!” Yao Xi’s gaze became even colder, and his killing intent toward Qin Yu became even stronger.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He instantly felt a strong sense of danger!

He could never escape once he was swallowed by that black hole!

That place was like a boundless and endless prison. Stepping into it, one would surely die!

“He’s using deadly force!” Holy Son Jiang narrowed his eyes and muttered.

Sainttess Gu’s face was unprecedentedly solemn. She looked at the black hole that was condensed and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu and Yao Xi are of the same generation. If Qin Yu dies here, even Dean Lei can’t say anything.”

“That’s right,” Holy Son Jiang said in a deep voice. “This Chaos Black Hole is incomparably ferocious. Even if I were to attack, I couldn’t think of a countermeasure either!”

They all came from mysterious aristocratic families and had incredibly terrifying trump card techniques. However, when they faced Yao Xi’s techniques, they felt a headache too.

“Could it be that a new star is about to fall here?” Numerous people had this thought in their hearts.

Qin Yu’s expression was rather ugly. He still could not figure out how to deal with this Chaotic Black Hole.

“Qin Yu, I’m sending you out of this world now. You bring along your secret technique and disappear!” Yao Xi shouted repeatedly.

Qin Yu did not say a word. His mind was constantly deducing the dao techniques, and he even recalled Xiao Sheng’s Rashomon!

Back in Nanzhou, Rashomon was known as being invincible. Once Rashomon appeared, it meant the battle was over. Almost no one survived under his Rashomon.

But subsequently, Rashomon was cracked by Zhao Jing! The scene of Xiao Sheng and Zhao Jing’s fight kept appearing in Qin Yu’s mind!

“Buzz!”

At the same time, the Chaotic Black Hole had fully taken shape!

Yao Xi was dragging a huge black hole with one hand. The black hole was emitting an incomparably mysterious light. Yao Xi looked like a true god, tremendously terrifying!

“Hiss, it’s a black hole!” Someone in the crowd sighed with emotion.

“Wrong! It’s the Chaotic Black Hole empowered by Emperor Shadow Technique! It can devour everything!”

Even Holy Son Jiang and the others exclaimed repeatedly because the pressure of the Chaotic Black Hole was too strong. The pure black caused people nearly not dare to look straight at it!

However, Qin Yu looked at the Chaotic Black Hole in Yao Xi’s hand and could not help but laugh heartily.

Seeing Qin Yu laughing wildly, everyone was stunned for a moment.

They looked at Qin Yu with their eyes full of confusion.

“Why are you laughing?” Yao Xi was even more furious and shouted from afar.

Qin Yu looked at the Chaotic Black Hole in Yao Xi’s hand and mocked, “Is this also considered an immortal emperor technique? I’m afraid your comprehension is not mature enough!”

Yao Xi frowned slightly. He seemed not to expect Qin Yu to say this.

“It’s indeed true that I did not comprehend this technique thoroughly enough,” he said with a cold face. “It’s far inferior to my family’s predecessors, but it’s more than enough to deal with you.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “That’s true. How can an immortal emperor technique be so shameful?”

“Shameful? Do you know what you’re talking about that made you so arrogant?” Yao Xi said angrily.

Holy Son Jiang, watching the battle from afar, could not help but mutter, “This Qin Yu is actually still showing off his eloquence at this time!”

“No, no, no. The Chaotic Black Hole in his hands is indeed not so good.” Jue Wu shook her head repeatedly.

Saintess Gu looked at Jue Wu in surprise and said, “This is an immortal emperor technique. Although Yao Xi did not use it to its full potential, it’s nearly invincible against cultivators of the same realm. If you can’t find a way to crack it, how can you say it’s not good?”

Jue Wu smiled and said, “You don’t know anything! There’s a cultivator in my hometown whose black hole is much stronger than this bullsh*t Chaotic Black Hole! It’s bigger, rounder, and darker!”

Holy Son Jiang and Saintess Gu could not help but look at each other, their eyes full of doubt and suspicion.

“Believe it or not, I can’t be bothered to explain to you,” Jue Wu waved her hand and said.
