2238 The Spiritualization Technique

“Hahaha, you don’t know how many people in our Azure Firmament Sect want to kill the six-tailed Demon Fox King, but no one has succeeded! You look like a body-tempering cultivator, but your mental strength isn’t bad. I must praise you generously this time!”

Piao Ruoyun laughed heartily. She was in a good mood.

Although Qin Yu was covered in wounds, he was in a rare good mood. The rewards from this action were not small, and he was also not backstabbed, which was the first time in purgatory.

“Little Junior Sister, why are you so happy?”

A sinister voice suddenly sounded not far away from them. Three people with gloomy expressions walked out.

Qin Yu’s heart skipped a beat. The three people were from the Azure Firmament Sect just now.

The gloomy man had left a trace of his internal qi on him, but he did not expect him to be following them around.

“Senior Brother, what do you want?”

Piao Ruoyun’s expression was tremendously ugly.

“Nothing much. The three of us hunted for this six-tailed demon fox with painstaking effort, and its soul power was almost worn out. It doesn’t seem good for you to take advantage of it like this.”

The gloomy man sneered and said.

“I’ll give you the inner core, and you swear to let us go.”

Piao RuoYun said coldly.

“Haha, Little Junior Sister, you’re indeed intelligent. It’s a pity that you’re displaying your abilities too conspicuously. It might be a little difficult to deal with you normally, but you don’t seem in a good state now. I can spare this little brother’s life as long as he serves me well.”

Ouyang Tina giggled as she winked at Qin Yu.

“Water Mirror Space!”

Dozens of enormous mirrors rose as Piao Ruoyun grabbed the dagger at her waist and threw it out.

The dagger let out a sharp whistling sound. Numerous dagger phantoms darted through in the Water Mirror Space, making it impossible to distinguish the real from the illusory.

“You have to pay the price too if you want me to die!”

Piao Ruoyun’s expression was cold and stern, completely different from earlier.

She spat a mouthful of blood on the dagger, and it sped up again, looking like an agile poisonous snake to the naked eye. It was impossible to capture its position under the reflection of the Water Mirror Space.

“Whoosh!”

The spirit snake sped up again and stabbed into the gloomy man.

“As expected of Little Junior Sister, she can still unleash such a terrifying attack in this state.”

The gloomy man held a bone umbrella and blocked the dagger.

His expression turned fierce as he unleashed his spiritual power, and the Water Mirror Space shattered instantly.

Piao Ruoyun’s expression turned vicious. Her divine sense broke through, and a golden light condensed in the hands of the divine sense figurine. There was a wave of fluctuations in that golden light that made Qin Yu’s heart tremble with fear.

The feeling was like the fear of the soul that a person’s skin would involuntarily stand on end when it came into contact with a sharp weapon. This golden light seemed to be a weapon that specifically targeted the soul.

“Soul-Shattering Golden Light? You actually learned this move!”

The gloomy-faced man was shocked.

“Even if I die, I will heavily injure your divine sense. You won’t have an easy time either.”

Piao Ruoyun said with a ruthless expression.

“Qin Yu, see if you can find a chance to escape later.”

Piao Ruoyun’s voice rang out in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“Ding, Ding, Ding!”

Suddenly, three bells rang in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu only felt his sea of consciousness hit by a small mountain and instantly felt dizzy.

“Tribulation Transcending magical artifact!”

Qin Yu felt a terrifying internal qi coming from the magical artifact. It was a genuine Tribulation Transcending magical artifact.

Just now, he was not the focus of the attack, but his soul seemed about to be taken away.

His soul would probably be shattered if he were to face the magical artifact head-on

As for Piao Ruoyun, who was the focus, collapsed onto the ground. The golden light from the divine sense figurine above her head dissipated as if it did not even have the strength to return to the sea of consciousness.

“Soul-hunting Bell, you actually got this thing!”

Piao Ruoyun’s face filled with despair.

“Haha, do you have any other trump cards? I can wait for you, Little Junior Sister.”

The gloomy man chuckled in a strange and eerie manner.

“Let him go, Senior Brother. I’ll give you the inner core,” Piao Ruoyun said softly as if she had already accepted her fate. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You don’t have the right to bargain now, Little Junior Sister. I told you not to team up with this trash, but you didn’t believe what I said. Now, he can’t help you at all.”

Ouyang Tina giggled.

“What a pity! Such a talented junior sister will die here today.”

She held a flexible sword in her hand as a ruthless smile appeared on her face. She then walked to Piao Ruoyun’s side and placed the flexible sword on Piao Ruoyun’s neck, intending to cut her head off.

“Soul-shattering Golden Light!”

A golden light appeared on Piao Ruoyun’s forehead and pierced through Ouyang Tina’s head like a flying sword.

Ouyang Tina’s face was ashen as she shrieked.

“B*tch! You still have the strength to attack my soul! I want to cut off your flesh piece by piece.”

“Ding!”

The gloomy man seemed to be very afraid of the Soul-shattering Golden Light. He suddenly stepped back and activated the Soul-hunting Bell.

“Spiritualization Technique!”

Qin Yu had been waiting for this moment. The power of his soul surged out and instantly transformed into a giant demon fox.

Dozens of giant fists smashed down on the three of them, causing the entire ground to tremble.

Qin Yu dared not relax in the slightest. He urged the power of his soul with all his might and threw 40 to 50 punches until the power of his soul was completely exhausted.

In the deep pit before them, the three turned into a pile of meat paste.

Qin Yu slumped onto the ground and took a deep breath before he quickly went over to put away the Soul-sucking Bell.

Fortunately, the three had focused on Piao Ruoyun. In their eyes, Qin Yu was severely injured, and they did not need not to guard against him.

They did not expect Qin Yu to have absorbed the souls of many demon beasts and cultivators. His soul had already condensed to a very terrifying level now, and it was just nice for the Spiritualization Technique to release this advantage.

Piao Ruoyun stared blankly at Qin Yu, completely stunned.

“How did you acquire that demon fox’s Spiritualization Technique?”

“I’ve just learned it. Otherwise, I would have taken so many hits for nothing.”

Qin Yu did not explain in detail. In his desolate divine eye, he had slowed down the circulation of the demon fox’s cultivation technique to the extreme. With the help of the desolate divine eye, he had learned the Spiritualization Technique.

Piao Ruoyun could not hide the shock on her face. A third-grade True Saint could kill the six-tailed demon fox and even learn his moves immediately. In this case, she was not surprised that Qin Yu had killed the three people.

“It seems I was too shallow, thinking you were just a cultivator with a relatively powerful physical cultivation. Your divine sense is also ridiculously strong. I have only seen such a powerful divine sense in my master. Fortunately, I’m not your enemy.”

Piao RuoYun said earnestly.
