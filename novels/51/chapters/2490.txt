2491 Entering the Azure Rock Forest

“Qin Yu, are you really going? Gu Ning isn’t a simple person. Gu Baiyi willingly gave up the position of the head of the family to her. This time, she must have a purpose for making you go with her.”

Flower Granny pondered for a long time but could not guess what the Gu family’s Holy Lord was planning.

“Unless she doesn’t care about the saintess and so many Gu family members, she probably won’t target me. After all, I have a good relationship with the Gu family.”

Gu Ning must have had her own plans, but what she said made sense.

This trip might be helpful to his path of anomaly, so he had to go.

Whether it was Teng Zixu or Xiao Shneg, they both gave him a lot of pressure.

If this was really the chance that Gu Baiyi had specially instructed Gu Ning to give him, he might lose a great opportunity if he missed it.

In an open area around Huaning Mountain, the people of the Gu family temporarily settled down.

“Master, Qin Yu has done his best to bring Human Race Watch to support us this time around…”

Saintess Gu hesitated many times and finally gritted her teeth and said.

“I understand what you mean. Everything I said is also true.”

“Martial Uncle Baiyi didn’t leave any parting words, nor did she ask you to bring him along.”

Saintess Gu took a deep breath and looked straight at her master.

“If I didn’t say this, I’m afraid Lei Xin and Flower Granny wouldn’t let him leave. If I wanted to harm him, I wouldn’t have brought so many people here. However, as I said, leaving this place alive is an opportunity. Otherwise, it will be a disaster of death. This is a tremendously important mission for the Gu family. Don’t hesitate anymore, understand?”

Gu Ning’s words carried a hint of authority, instantly deflating Sanintess Gu, who had just mustered the courage to question her.

“Yes, Master…”

In three days, Gu Ning arranged everything.

She also gave Lei Xin and Flower Granny a list of names, so that they could start interacting with the Gu family’s higher-ups.

At the same time, she handed over a portion of the family’s resources to Human Race Watch so that they could use them to increase the strength of the cultivators under Human Race Watch.

“If the Gu family sincerely joins us, and some of the 3,000 cultivators cultivate the joint attack technique, it will definitely increase the strength of Human Race Watch tremendously.”

Lei Xin sighed with emotion and said.

The people who now cultivated the Brilliance of Stars and Moon were from Thunder Courtyard, Ji Yue’s family members, and the Azure Firmament Sect’s people.

These were all reliable people in the sect. They were taught the first part of the joint attack technique.

However, at this point, only cultivators below the fourth-grade True Saint could cultivate it. Therefore, it was impossible to judge its maximum combat strength.

“Qin Yu, we are about to set off. Do you want to go with us?”

At the place where Qin Yu was, the tea in front of him suddenly rippled slightly.

Gu Ning and Saintess Gu suddenly appeared in front of him.

No one noticed when they came in.

“What a terrifying breath control effect.”

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked. The attack power of the Gu family’s celestial artifact, the Heart of the Ocean, was perhaps just average.

However, this kind of heaven-defying effect could indeed be used in a great way.

“The Gu family’s immortal scriptures have always been about using gentleness to overcome strength. This celestial artifact that has protected us for nearly 30,000 years also focuses on protection. I know what you’re thinking. However, you must maintain a calm spirit as even a trace of killing intent appearing on your body would cause the effect of breath control to disappear immediately. Therefore, it’s very difficult to use it to assassinate people.”

Gu Ning explained the effect of the Heart of the Ocean to Qin Yu with a smile.

Qin Yu no longer hesitated. His body flew directly toward the Heart of the Ocean.

In an instant, he seemed to have entered another world of water.

Dense water elements wrapped around him, and every cell of his seemed to be nourished by the gentle power.

The injuries left behind from the previous battle began to be healed by the dense water element power.

The Heart of the Ocean melted into the finest water element and shuttled through the spatial water vapor.

As long as there was water, it would go downstream.

In the blink of an eye, the three were already hundreds of thousands of meters away from Huaning Mountain.

They rushed toward the Azure Rock Forest at a tremendously fast speed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You appeared in Sky City before because you discovered what the Ji family did, did you?”

Qin Yu suddenly remembered Saintess Gu had once appeared in Sky City.

“Yes, Master discovered the Ji family’s arrangement a long time ago. In return for keeping the secret, the Ji family agreed to help us do some things after Evil Eye was refined. We didn’t expect you to interrupt. This is also heaven’s will.”

Saintess Gu said with a bitter smile.

“The hundreds of thousands of bloodlines of the Great Xia Royal Family were wiped out just like that. You guys actually used this as a bargaining chip! Do you have any conscience? No matter what, the Great Xia Royal Family has once achieved remarkable feats for the human race.”

Qin Yu frowned and suddenly felt a little angry.

“So what? The blood the Gu family lost for the human race cannot be understated. The Jee family’s bloodline is still in your Huaning Mountain. If this world doesn’t care about benefits and only talks about standing, it will become like the Jee family sooner or later.”

Gu Ning shook her head, paused for a while, and continued.

“Including the rise of the human race, it is also a path of darkness for other races, not to mention our own people. Darkness can never be erased.”

While talking, they had already entered the Azure Rock Forest.

It was a completely different space from the human world. In the dense forest, thin fog permeated the air, and faint lights flickered among the green leaves as if they were hiding endless secrets.

In the valley that towered into the clouds, the waterfall flowed down, and the mist splashed by the water droplets enveloped the entire valley, emitting a fresh aura.

In the depths of numerous caves, shadows filled the air. Faint footsteps could be heard from the deep darkness as if countless eyes were watching every person who entered.

The Heart of the Ocean passed through the water vapor spread from the lake and the cave.

It was a fantastic feeling. Countless demon babies were hiding under their mothers’ stomachs in the caves.

In a village of the demon race, an elderly man of the demon race sat in front of a house. He was surrounded by a group of children singing cheerful songs, and their laughter echoed throughout the village.

In a bear cave, a mother carefully helped her children tear the food they had hunted into small pieces. A group of cubs were playing around.

The feeling that the entire demon race gave Qin Yu was actually another human race.

Unlike the monster and ghost realm, the demon race was also a race with feelings, which was closer to the human world.

As the Heart of the Ocean continuously went deeper, Gu Ning’s face grew solemn.

The speed began to slow down because the internal qi of the demon race nearby was tremendously powerful.
