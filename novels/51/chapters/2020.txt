2021 The Furious Elder Si

Qin Yu was not afraid of Elder Si at all. He looked at him coldly and said sarcastically, “Old b*stard, do you think I’m afraid of you? I’ve initially wanted to spare your d*mned life for the time being. But since you’ve come to look for me, I’ll send you off, old b*stard!”

Elder Si had been tremendously furious, to begin with. When he heard Qin Yu’s curses at this moment, he became even more furious!

“You little b*stard!” He gritted his teeth and angrily said, “It’s because of you that I was nearly expelled from the Si family. This time, I’m going to tear you into shreds!”

“I’m waiting for you here. You can try!” Qin Yu shouted.

The attendant beside Elder Si seemed to have noticed something unusual. Someone beside him whispered, “Elder Si, this kid seems to be provoking you purposely. Could it be that he has some special method? It’s better to be careful!”

However, Elder Si had long been angered by Qin Yu. How would he listen to him?

“He’s merely at the middle stage of Reversion Void. Killing him is very easy!” Elder Si shouted.

With that said, Elder Si’s body erupted with an internal qi. His body shook, and he suddenly rushed toward Qin Yu!

Just as Elder Si pounced over, Qin Yu quickly put his hand into the dragon blood jar!

He drew out the dragon blood using his spiritual power. The dragon blood scattered into the sky and then entered a few big formation cores of the Endless Killing Formation!

At this moment, the Endless Killing Formation was completely activated. A barrier arising from killing intent surged from all directions, isolating the entire formation from the world. Even Elder Si could not escape from this formation!

The moment the formation was activated, pure killing intent immediately surged, and the terrifying internal qi continued rising!

Even Elder Si also felt a little uneasy under this killing intent.

He stopped in his tracks and turned to look at the barrier around him. His face instantly darkened.

“Little b*stard, you’ve actually set up a formation in this place…” Elder Si narrowed his eyes and said gloomily.

Qin Yu looked at Elder Si coldly and said, “Elder Si, you’ve finally entered…”

Elder Si didn’t panic. Instead, he said sarcastically, “What? Do you think you can defeat me with a small formation? Let me tell you, in front of true strength, everything is illusory!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu sneered. “This formation is called the Endless Killing Formation. With your experience, you should have heard of it. Once you step into this formation, as long as the formation is not broken, you will surely die!”

Elder Si’s expression changed a little when he heard the mention of “Endless Killing Formation”.

However, he did not panic. Instead, he shouted, “It’s fine. After I kill you, I’ll break the formation!”

“Do you think you have a chance?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Looking at Elder Si opposite him, endless battle intent burst out from the bottom of his heart, and his internal qi rose rapidly.

He wasn’t in a hurry to use the Endless Killing Formation. He wanted to fight Elder Si with his own strength and see how big the gap between him and a Semi-Saint was!

Qin Yu slowly raised his hands, and rays of golden light surged on his body.

Seeing Qin Yu’s actions, Elder Si immediately understood Qin Yu’s intentions.

“Hahaha!” Elder Si laughed crazily. “Kid, you’ve spent a lot of effort to set up the Endless Killing Formation, but now you want to fight me with your own strength? What? You want to use me as your touchstone?”

Qin Yu ignored Elder Si. His internal qi was still rising, and his fighting word formula had even reached the fifth level instantly!

A powerful internal qi swept over, mixed with the killing intent that emerged from the Endless Killing Formation. For a moment, even Elder Si was slightly surprised but merely surprised.

“You have some ability, but unfortunately, the gap is too big! ” Elder Si shouted, and the Semi-Saint’s might instantly surged out!

With a shout, his white hair blew in the wind. He raised his hands, and a terrifying dragon-like energy erupted from his sleeves and rushed toward Qin Yu!

Facing Elder Si, whose cultivation was much higher than his, Qin Yu naturally did not dare to be negligent. He roared angrily, and golden light suddenly appeared on his fists. He raised his hand and punched out the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch!

The destructive fist punched toward Elder Si, and the surrounding space instantly began to distort!

Numerous sand and stones turned into powder. Everything in the surroundings seemed unable to withstand this power!

“Boom!”

At the instant of collision, an invisible airwave spread in all directions, and the ground instantly cracked. The powerful force caused the surrounding space to be unstable.

Both Elder Si and Qin Yu stepped back swiftly with the help of the reaction force. Their eyes, as sharp as swords, met.

Although Qin Yu’s internal qi was formidable, it was still far from Elder Si’s. The golden light cracked instantly, and Qin Yu felt as if a huge rock was pressing down on his chest. A hint of sweetness was in his throat.

“As expected of a Semi-Saint. The gap is still too great…” Qin Yu muttered.

Even with the help of the fighting word formula, Qin Yu still had no chance of winning against Elder Si.

Elder Si looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Little b*stard, this is just the appetizer. If you don’t activate the Endless Killing Formation, I’m afraid you won’t have another chance!”

Qin Yu was silent, his face revealing a trace of solemnity.

He knew how big the gap between him and a Half-Saint was, but he was not afraid. The unyielding will in his heart had made him not back off when facing a powerful enemy.

“Little b*stard, I won’t give you any more chance,” Elder Si said coldly.

He had to kill Qin Yu as soon as possible and then think of a way to break this formation.

Once the Endless Killing Formation was fully activated, even if he did not die, his skin would be peeled off!

Therefore, Elder Si did not intend to give Qin Yu more chances. He slowly raised his hands as if preparing a tremendously powerful technique.

Qin Yu, who was not far away, naturally did not dare to be negligent. However, at this moment, he did not show any fear. His face even revealed some excitement.

“This Qin Yu is probably courting death,” the onlookers outside could not help but say coldly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Since he has set up the Endless Killing Formation, why doesn’t he activate it?”

“That’s right. Controlling the Endless Killing Formation requires a lot of mental strength. Under a severely injured state, if he’s not careful, the Endless Killing Formation will go berserk. Once the Endless Killing Formation goes out of control, he will also die inside.”

In the dark, looking in the direction of Qin Yu, Xiao Hai also could not figure out Qin Yu’s motive.

As a cultivator in the realm of Semi-Saint, Elder Si naturally had a powerful trump card technique.

He slowly raised his hands, and a terrifying internal qi and dao technique began to gather in his hands.

“Rumble…”

...

Dark clouds suddenly gathered in the sky, and bolts of lightning were rapidly condensing.

The thunderbolts seemed to have formed a connection with Elder Si’s palm. As he moved his palm, numerous thunderbolts gathered in his palm.
