1804 The Domineering Jue Wu

Jue Wu soon noticed Qin Yu’s abnormality.

She quickly walked to Qin Yu’s side and carefully protected him behind her. From time to time, she would exude a wisp of internal qi to wipe away the sweat from Qin Yu’s forehead.

Not far away, Zhong Wenyi was still chattering non-stop. It was obvious that she was trying to protect Yang Yu.

Yang Yu also went along with her from time to time, but the young man who was mistaken by Qin Yu for Yang Yu remained silent.

The giant anaconda soared in the sky.

The group spent a full three days before they got close to the Forbidden Zone.

The moment they approached the Forbidden Zone, everything in the surroundings changed.

The sky turned dark red, and the whole world was as if covered with a dark red filter.

Not far away, there were many pillars. On each pillar, extremely strange characters were carved on it.

Looking further into the distance, there seemed to be extremely huge statues standing.

These statues were very much like the Devil Lord described in ancient myths. Even though they were very far away, they gave people a strong sense of oppression.

Just looking at it made people feel extremely uncomfortable and depressed, not to mention stepping into it.

At that moment, everyone felt that something was amiss. In such a scene, everyone was deeply affected and furrowed their brows tightly.

Qin Yu’s face turned even uglier.

There was no other reason other than the fact that the radiance of this world was very much similar to the scene that Qin Yu had seen when he was devouring primordial spirits!

Qin Yu, who originally was almost unable to suppress himself, was now on the verge of a breakdown. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

His eyes turned blood-red, and his body trembled slightly.

It was a phenomenon that his resistance against his inner demons had reached its peak.

Seeing that Qin Yu was about to lose control, Jue Wu quickly whispered in his ear, “Qin Yu, you must endure it. Just endure it for a while more and things will be fine!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, but it was really unbearable to be haunted by his inner demons. It was different from the physical pain as it was distracting his mind.

“Don’t you still want to go to Zhongzhou to visit the Yan family? Don’t you want to surpass that chaotic body and marry the princess of the Yan family?” Jue Wu’s voice kept ringing out into Qin Yu’s ears.

Qin Yu finally calmed down a lot after hearing this.

He took a deep breath and did his best to remain calm.

“The Forbidden Zone is right up there. Rumor has it that long ago, several aristocratic families named the six Forbidden Zones. But I don’t know the names of this zone,” Yang Yu stood up and said indifferently.

“I’ve never heard of it,” Gu Sanchen said, shaking his head. “I’m afraid only the elders in the family know about it.”

“How about you?” Zhong Wenyi glanced at Qin Yu again.

“Are you deaf? Didn’t you hear what Brother Gu said? Do you think Qin Yu is an elder? Do you think he looks like your father at his age?” Jue Wu cursed.

Zhong Wenyi’s face darkened, and she said coldly, “You’d better watch your words. Don’t think I’m afraid of you just because you’re from Zhongzhou. Do you know who my father is?”

“You have to go back and ask your mother who your father is. Do I look like your mother?” Jue Wu rolled her eyes.

“You!” Zhong Wenyi was so angry, but she couldn’t do anything to Jue Wu.

“Alright. Everyone, stop quarreling. The Forbidden Zone is up there. Everyone, be careful,” Gu Sanchen said with a smile.

With that, Gu Sanchen put away the giant anaconda, and the group landed on the ground.

The road in this place was winding, and it was extremely complicated.

After moving forward several stars, they would reach the actual Forbidden Zone.

Without anyone leading them, they might accidentally step into the edge of the Forbidden Zone. If that happened, they would surely die.

“Brother Yang, please lead the way,” Gu Sanchen said.

Yang Yu nodded slightly and immediately walked to the forefront.

Gu Sanchen followed closely behind as if he was afraid of getting lost.

Qin Yu was about to follow them, but Jue Wu quietly pulled him.

“Walk slower,” Jue Wu said.

“Why?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Jue Wu pointed at Zhong Wenyi, who was in front of her and said, “Yang Yu has a Saint Weapon, but this fellow definitely doesn’t have one. I’ll get you some antidote later.”

“Antidote?” Qin Yu was startled. It seemed he didn’t understand what Jue Wu meant.

Jue Wu didn’t utter a sound. She only stared at Zhong Wenyi.

Just then, Zhong Wenyi stopped in her tracks.

She turned around and looked at Jue Wu.

“Why are you following me?” Zhong Wenyi said with a frown.

“I’m willing. What can you do?” Jue Wu said, putting her hands on her waist.

“You made me worried. You can go to the front,” Zhong Wenyi snorted and said.

“I don’t want. How about it?” Jue Wu snorted.

“Who knows if you’ll do something by following me around?” Zhong Wenyi said with a gloomy expression.

“Then you can walk slower. I won’t walk in front of you anyway,” Jue Wu rolled her eyes and said.

With that, her pace became even slower, as if she was taking a stroll in the courtyard leisurely.

However, Zhong Wenyi didn’t seem to trust Jue Wu. She gritted her teeth and slowed down her pace.

The three of them seemed to be competing to see who was walking slower. Thus their speed became even slower.

Gu Sanchen and Yang Yu, who were in front of them, didn’t notice anything unusual. They seemed to be discussing the Forbidden Zone and didn’t notice the three people didn’t follow them.

As the distance between the two parties grew further, Jue Wu’s originally cheeky expression instantly turned cold. A murderous intent burst out from her body.

Zhong Wenyi’s expression changed slightly. She seemed to have sensed something wrong.

She wanted to talk to that person, but Jue Wu’s small hand pulled and directly sealed the void!

Her technique was extremely strange. It was as if she had pulled her into the void, and the surrounding area had turned pitch-black!

“You…” Zhong Wenyi was shocked and said. “What’re you doing?”

“What do you think?” Jue Wu’s voice was extremely cold. She stretched out her small hand and slapped Zhong Wenyi’s face.

The slap was so heavy that Zhong Wenyi’s pretty face distorted!

“You… You dare to hit me! You’re courting death!” Zhong Wenyi suddenly shouted and immediately raised her palm to slap at Jue Wu.

Zhong Wenyi’s strength was simply too weak in front of Jue Wu.

During this period, Jue Wu seemed to have become even more familiar with the power of the purple cloud pearl. It was simply extraordinary.

In just a few minutes, Zhong Wenyi was already on the verge of death, and her internal qi was extremely weak.

Jue Wu looked at Zhong Wenyi coldly and said, “Don’t you have a lot of nonsense to say? Say one more sentence to let me listen.”

Zhong Wenyi opened her mouth, but no words came out.

Jue Wu didn’t want to waste any more time with Zhong Wenyi. She looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, hurry up. The antidote is here. Don’t waste any time. It’ll be troublesome if you’re discovered.”

Qin Yu finally understood how the word “antidote” came about.

Therefore, Qin Yu quickly stepped forward, raised his palm, and began to devour Zhong Wenyi’s primordial spirit.
