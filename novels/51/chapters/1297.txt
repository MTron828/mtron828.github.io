Chapter 1298: Chapter 1,298, Let’s Fight! 

Qin Yu’s words immediately caused the young master of the stone gambling shop to be slightly stunned, and then he began to laugh maniacally.

“What did you say? You want me to hand over the money? Are you crazy?”The young master could not stop laughing coldly.

He sized up Qin Yu and could see that there was no spiritual energy fluctuation in Qin Yu’s body, which made him not put Qin Yu in his eyes at all.

“Go, kill him!”The young master shouted and the eight people rushed towards Qin Yu.

However, in less than ten minutes, the eight people started to escape in a sorry state.

They thought that the gate was sealed to trap Qin Yu, but they didn’t expect that they couldn’t escape at all!

In more than ten minutes, the eight people were all beaten to death by Qin Yu’s iron fist.

As for the young master of the stone gambling shop, his eyes were wide open as he stood rooted to the ground in a daze.

Such combat strength... Wasn’t it too terrifying! With just a pair of bare fists, he had killed eight people. This simply caused his worldview to collapse!

Qin Yu shook off the bloodstains on his hands and walked in front of this young man. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Hand over all the money, quickly.”Qin Yu raised his hand and patted his head.

How could this young master dare to resist? He immediately took out all the money on the shop and gave it to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at it and found that there were more than ten million spirit coins on the shop.

Qin Yu nodded with satisfaction. He patted the young man’s head and said, “You’re right. How can gambling stone be faster than directly snatching it?”

Hearing this, the young man even wanted to die.

After taking the money, Qin Yu swaggered out of the shop.

As soon as he walked out, he saw that the entire street had been sealed off.

The Army of Gu City had already arrived at the scene.

Dozens of people surrounded the entire street.

In the sky, a general with a huge carriage and a big belly was commanding the scene.

“Qin Yu, you have nowhere to run. Come back with us,”the general of Gu City said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered. “Don’t worry, I Won’t run. I’ll wait for Ling Yun here.”

“How dare you! How can you call Young Master Ling by his name!”The general shouted.

Qin Yu glanced at the surrounding troops and said coldly, “If you don’t want your men to die, don’t act recklessly. Otherwise, I don’t mind starting a massacre in Gu City.”

The general frowned slightly. It seemed that he didn’t want to make things awkward, so he coldly snorted and said, “We have already informed Young Master Ling. You can wait here.”

“Okay, this young master will wait here.”Qin Yu pulled a stool and sat down.

The scene was quite harmonious. The heavy soldiers of Gu City were quite nervous, but Qin Yu was extremely relaxed.

On a tall building not far away, there were two young men squatting there and watching everything.

“Who is that Kid? What a big lineup,”one of the young men muttered.

The other young man muttered, “How the F * CK Would I know? Who cares? If there’s a good show, then it’s a bastard.”

“TSK TSK, look at how that kid is so F * cking comfortable. Not only is he not in a hurry, he’s even sitting there eating melon seeds,”the young man scolded in a low voice.

“Shh, both of You, don’t talk nonsense.”At this moment, a slightly plump elder walked over.

“This young man has offended Ling Yun of the Heavenly Cloud sect. If someone were to tell Ling Yun about this matter, I’m afraid that he would be angered,”the elder advised.

However, the two young men did not care at all when they heard the name of the Heavenly Cloud sect. Instead, they scoffed and said, “What’s wrong with the Heavenly Cloud Sect? Do you think I’m afraid of Him?”

The other young man rolled his eyes and said, “That’s right, that’s right. Whatever Ling Yun Yi Yun is, it has nothing to do with us.”

Seeing this, the old man did not say anything more.

“But speaking of which, this kid called Qin Yu is quite bold. He still dares to provoke the Tianyun sect in the territory of the South Province?”One of the young men muttered.

“Who knows? Who cares? Just wait for the show to be over.”

Below, Qin Yu was sitting on a bench. He casually picked up a handful of melon seeds from a stall and started munching on them.

He took out a hundred spiritual coins from his card and placed them on the stall. he shouted, “I paid!”

The stall owner didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He didn’t dare to reply.

In a short while, a bunch of melon seeds appeared under Qin Yu’s feet.

“Sigh, this is too boring.”Qin Yu stood up from the bench and stretched.

“Why isn’t Ling Yun Here Yet? I’ve been waiting for him for almost three hours.”

The big-bellied general said coldly, “Don’t worry, we’ve already informed Young Master Ling. He must be on his way.”

“Oh,”Qin Yu replied. He thought for a moment before raising his head and shouting, “Can I ask you something? Do you know where there is life?”

The Big Belly was stunned for a moment, then he said with a dark face, “You’d better shut up!”

Qin Yu muttered to himself, “There must be something in Gu City, such as an auction or some aristocratic family. There must be... Oh right, do you have it in the Imperial Palace? Can you ask your city Lord to give me some?”

The Big Belly seemed to have reached his limit. He gritted his teeth and said, “Shut up! You’re about to die and you don’t know it. How dare you talk nonsense with a cheeky face!”

“I can tell, there must be something!”Qin Yu said with certainty.

“Tell Your City Lord that I’m going to get some from him.”

The big-bellied man gritted his teeth and covered his ears.

On the other side, Ling Yun, who had received the news, was rushing frantically.

He rode on a huge flying beast and headed straight for Gu City.
