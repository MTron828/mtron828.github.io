Chapter 692: I’ll Capture You As Well! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xia Hang glanced around at the darkness, his eyes filled with surprise.

The scene fell silent again.

They seemed to have to consider this question.

“No, there’s no way Yan Ruoxue will be handed over.” At this time, a voice finally came from the darkness.

“You’re right. Even if we don’t save Qu Xie, we can’t let Yan Ruoxue go,” Someone else said.

“I agree.” For a moment, several higher-ups agreed to this suggestion.

Xia Hang couldn’t help but sigh slightly when he heard this.

As expected, these higher-ups simply couldn’t agree to Qin Yu’s request.

“However... we still have to save Qu Xie.” At this time, someone else said.

“Come up with other conditions to exchange.”

Xia Hang said in a low voice from the side, “Qin Yu has two experts by his side. Their strength is beyond imagination. Even the Martial Saint Weapon can’t hurt them in the slightest.”

“Impossible. There is no such person in this world.” Soon, someone denied Xia Hang’s statement.

Xia Hang said hurriedly, “Senior executives, this is true! We saw President Qu holding the Prajna ruler with our own eyes. He was easily suppressed by those two people...”

“He must have used some secret technique.” A senior executive said in a low voice.

“Immediately send someone to scout for news. At the same time, negotiate with that Qin Yu.” A senior executive said coldly.

Xia Hang slowly stood up and volunteered, “Higher-ups, I’m willing to go!”

“No need, we already have a candidate.” A cold voice came from the dark.

Xia Hang opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but these higher-ups slowly retreated and disappeared into the darkness.

Xia Hang frowned slightly.

Already had a candidate? Could it be that even if Qu Xie died, he wouldn’t be able to become the next president?

“It appears that everything doesn’t seem to be that simple...” Xia Hang muttered.

...

Green Moon Villa.

Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged in an empty space. In front of him was a piece of ice heart.

The ice heart was emitting streams of pure spiritual energy. This spiritual energy surrounded Qin Yu’s body and formed a small whirlpool. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

These streams of spiritual energy were extremely pure, but Qin Yu couldn’t calm down at all.

His forehead was sweating non-stop, and his body was trembling slightly.

“It seems that your state of mind is very unstable.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded in Qin Yu’s ear.

Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly opened.

He hurriedly looked behind him and saw a skinny old woman standing there quietly.

Qin Yu looked at the old woman warily and said coldly, “Who are you? Who let you in?”

The old woman put her hands behind her back and said indifferently, “Didn’t you want to talk to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? I’m here.”

Qin Yu’s face darkened and he said tentatively, “You are the higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“Oh? You know about the higher-ups?” The old woman sat opposite Qin Yu and even poured herself a glass of water.

“It seems that you know us very well,” The old woman said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with vigilance, and the internal Qi on his body was also released.

This old woman was able to enter this room silently. Her strength was probably far above Qin Yu.

“Tell me, what conditions do you have?” The old woman drank a mouthful of water and asked indifferently.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I said, I’ll trade him for Yan Ruoxue. The rest is out of the question.”

The old woman shook her head and said, “This is an impossible condition. Let’s change it to another one.”

“Then there’s no need to continue the conversation. Just wait to collect Qu Xie’s corpse,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The old woman was not anxious. She said indifferently, “Once we decide to give up Qu Xie, we will definitely launch a large-scale attack on the Green Moon Villa. We won’t hold back anymore! Have you thought it through?”

Qin Yu looked at the old woman coldly and said, “Old thing, are you threatening me?”

The old woman sneered, “Do you think we can’t do it?”

“Then you can try!” Qin Yu shouted, and a golden light suddenly appeared.

At the same time, Burly’s figure quickly appeared behind Qin Yu.

The old woman could not help but look at Burly behind her, her eyes flashing with rays of light.

Then, the old woman sneered and said, “If this is what you rely on, then your beautiful dream will probably come to nothing.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly, and his heart could not help but thump.

Could it be that this old thing had seen through something?

“If I’m not wrong, this should be a corpse, right?” The old woman continued to say.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly darkened.

“Looks like I was right.” After the old woman saw Qin Yu’s expression, a smile couldn’t help but flash across her face.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and coldly said, “So what if he is, so what if he isn’t! Even if he is a corpse, he still has the ability to destroy the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

The old woman shook her head and said, “Qin Yu, you underestimate us too much. If you can find such a corpse for your own use, we are capable of finding it too.”

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly furrowed, and a trace of unease flashed across his face.

Just as the old woman had said, almost all the resources in the world were in the hands of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Who could guarantee that they had not obtained even more powerful corpses?

Even the mustache man could resurrect these two corpses, let alone the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?

“Qin Yu, you’ve already gotten a chance to talk. I hope you’ll cherish it,” The old woman said faintly.

“This opportunity is now or never. If Qu Xie dies, you’ll have to die with him.”

After saying this, the old woman turned around and prepared to leave.

“Stop!” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted.

Burly immediately stepped forward and stood in front of the old woman.

The old woman’s back was facing Qin Yu, and she said indifferently, “What else do you have to say?”

Qin Yu asked coldly, “Are you the only one who came today?”

The old woman said with a faint smile, “What else? Do you think that I will be like you, creating a big fuss and making it known to the world?”

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he grinned and said, “Although I don’t know who you are, I think you must be very important to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, right?”

The old woman seemed to have sensed something. She turned to look at Qin Yu and asked, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu sneered. “Nothing. Since I can’t threaten you with Qu Xie, I’ll capture you as well!”

“Burly, do it!”

With a loud shout, Burly immediately stretched out his hand and grabbed the old woman.
