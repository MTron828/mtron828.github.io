Chapter 2406 Black Saber

Qin Yu thought, and the person in the lead had already brazenly attacked.

He descended like a fierce tiger, and in an instant, the aura of the Peak True Saint had erupted to the utmost. Even though Qin Yu was in the fourth grade, he was like a lion fighting a hare, going all out.

Thousand Birds!

A tremendously sharp thunderous sound passed, and Qin Yu’s right hand instantly turned into lightning.

The green sword suddenly pierced through the cultivator’s head. In Qin Yu’s eyes, his speed was still too slow.

Qin Yu’s expression changed.

Just as his green sword smashed the cultivator’s soul, a massive force suddenly clamped the green sword.

The approaching cultivator revealed an unusual flush on his face. Qin Yu felt an enormous force coming from his green sword and locked his body like a shackle.

His divine sense blasted fiercely but failed to rush out of his sea of consciousness.

However, as his soul attacked, the cultivator who had attacked spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Elder Qingyang!”

The cultivators behind him roared.

“Soul Burning?”

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. This was ridiculous.

At the very least, he had to test it out first. Who would immediately go all out when encountering someone?

After burning, the soul power of the Peak of True Saint seemed to have entered tribulation in those few seconds.

That power again transformed into a seal that suppressed Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

After doing all this, Elder Qingyang’s body fell like a stone. His soul had already been destroyed, and it was his corpse that fell.

Almost at the same time, the space in front of him fluctuated.

A black saber swept past in front of Qin Yu. This time, Qin Yu clearly saw the saber qi.

Tribulation!

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. He finally knew the reason why Qingyang burned his soul.

It was to buy time for the black saber to attack.

The saber qi was tremendously complex. It carried an immensely grand force, yet it remained completely calm.

Only after touching Qin Yu’s body did the saber qi erupt.

“D*mn it! Do you ignore my existence?”

Chang Mang charged toward the person who had suddenly appeared.

And Jue Wu used her body as a weapon and fiercely clashed with the black saber.

However, the black saber was not affected at all. Instead, Jue Wu was directly sent flying.

Almost in an instant, the black saber had already penetrated his skin and wanted to cut him into two halves.

Qin Yu looked indifferent. A tsunami-like sound appeared in his body.

Forehead acupoint! Explode!

The acupoint on Qin Yu’s forehead that formed a small world instantly exploded.

A terrifying force suddenly exploded in front of Qin Yu’s chest. The hand holding the black saber was suddenly blasted away by this massive force.

The black saber that had cut into Qin Yu’s body turned into boundless water and directly clamped Qin Yu’s muscles.

That person spat out a large mouthful of blood. His body moved and disappeared again.

This person had cultivated the Way of Space to a tremendously profound level. If he had not made a move, Qin Yu could not have detected his figure in the void.

“As an assassin, since you’ve made a move, you must be aware of death.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s voice was as cold as ice. He pulled out the black saber from his chest.

The power of the Annihilation Rules surged into the black saber. In an instant, the black saber seemed to have taken a tonic and a destructive power that could burn the heaven emitted.

“Stop!”

With a stern shout, one, two, and three figures arrived in front of Qin Yu.

After that, many cultivators arrived in an instant.

“Qin Yu, is this a misunderstanding? Can you give my Ji family some respect?”

Ji Ao frowned.

“Alright!”

Qin Yu smiled faintly, and his expression stunned Ji Ao, the Holy Son of the Ji family.

“Boom!”

In a specific space, the saber qi that could destroy the world suddenly exploded. A massive black flame that seemed to be able to destroy the world was burning, and one could vaguely hear people’s miserable cries.

“What a good saber! Even if it carries the power of annihilation, the saber qi is almost soundless. I’ll keep this saber.”

“Qin Yu, in purgatory, my Ji family didn’t attack you. Today, in this place that we have already agreed on, you broke the agreement again. Do you really mean to be a mortal enemy of my nine great aristocratic families?”

Ji Ao, furrowing his brows, seemed displeased.

“Shut the f*ck up. Why didn’t you come out and say it was a misunderstanding during the sneak attack just now? After the fight, you came out and pretended to be a good person. You’ve f*cking done all the acting in the world.”

A murderous look flashed across Ji Ao’s face, but he quickly hid it.

Chang Mang completely disregarded the respect for the Holy Son. His finger almost poked into his nose.

“I didn’t expect you to break through to the True Saint and appear here.”

Qin Yu ignored Ji Ao and looked at Saintess Gu.

It had been a long time since they last met. Gu Xianyu still exuded an even stronger celestial aura. It was unknown what dao technique she cultivated. At a glance, he could only vaguely see her face.

“Long time no see, Qin Yu. Back then, you were chased out of the Holy Region, and I thought I would never see you again. I didn’t expect to be able to see you again after a hundred years. This place is where my fortune lies, and I am not your enemy.”

Gu Cianyu bowed slightly to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu returned the bow. He looked at Ji Ao and saw a girl in red with a cold expression.

She seemed to be Ji Ao’s sister, Ji Tianyu. He had seen the information Ji Yue had given him before and recognized this person.

“Hmph!”

With a move of his body, Ji Ao left directly with a cold face.

The others also left. Saintess Gu did not seem to have any intention of catching up. She smiled and disappeared from the spot.

Ji Yuyi stared at Qin Yu and revealed a very strange smile.

“Finish what you need to do and leave this place quickly.”

Then, she slowly retreated and left.

“They left just like this?”

Chang Mang was somewhat dumbstruck. He had thought that there would be a great battle.

However, these people unexpectedly left just like this. This made him feel like he had nowhere to use his strength.

“That little girl is so strange. I don’t know why I felt a chill when she stared at us just now.”

Jue Wu stared at the back of the little girl and scratched her head.

With Jue Wu’s personality, this was the first time she had said something like this.

Qin Yu frowned. The Ji family’s Holy Son and his sister, black saber, the self-destructed Qingyang, the person who had just arrived, the three cultivators at the Tribulation Transcending Stage, and the Gu family’s saintess were also present.

This Imperial Palace seemed to have some secrets.

Otherwise, the Imperial Palace of a declining royal family was definitely not worth having so many powerful people guarding it.

“Anyway, be careful.”

Qin Yu floated in the air and rushed toward the center.

It was originally a simple matter, but after so many changes, things suddenly became strange and complicated.

Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye observed the entire way, but it did not seem to notice anything unusual.
