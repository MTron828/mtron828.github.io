Chapter 476: Pavilion Master VS Elder Qu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Elder Qu’s eyes suddenly widened, and his expression immediately became extremely ugly!

He stared at the Pavilion Master, and a wave of anger filled his chest.

Elder Qu knew that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Pavilion Master wasn’t easy to persuade, but he didn’t expect that zhe would be so disrespectful!

“Are you going against the Saint Confucian Sect?” Elder Qu said coldly.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Elder Qu and said indifferently, “Do you really think that the Saint Confucian Sect is the number one sect in the world?”

“You!” Elder Qu was angry.

The Saint Confucian Sect was indeed not the number one sect in the world, but in the north, practically no one dared to provoke it!

Traces of killing intent burst out from Elder Qu’s body, and a terrifying pressure spread out at this moment.

“What? Do you want to make a move on the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” The Pavilion Master narrowed her eyes.

Elder Qu shouted loudly, “I want to see just what is so extraordinary about the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”

Before he finished his words, Elder Qu’s palm was shrouded in light as he slammed his palm towards the Pavilion Master!

The Pavilion Master wasn’t flustered. She raised her hand lightly and confronted the attack.

“Boom!”

A loud explosion sounded in the hall!

Elder Qu took a few steps back before he finally fell to the ground.

“Pu!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out from his mouth!

“Who do you think you are to come to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to ask for someone?” The internal qi on the Pavilion Master’s body became extremely cold. Even the temperature in the room had dropped by a few degrees!

Elder Qu’s expression was extremely ugly!

Although it was only a short exchange of blows, the gap between the two was self-evident.

“Well then!” Elder Qu crawled up from the ground.

“I’ll go back and report to the sect master right now!”

The Pavilion Master said expressionlessly, “Send the guest off.”

The few Law Enforcement Elders quickly moved forward while glaring at Elder Qu.

Although Elder Qu felt indignant, he didn’t dare to flare up.

He snorted coldly and turned around to leave.

After walking out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Elder Qu spat out another mouthful of blood.

“Elder Qu, are you alright!?” The disciple of the Saint Confucian Sect hurriedly asked.

Elder Qu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said coldly, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Pavilion Master... lives up to her reputation.”

“Elder Qu, it’s better to tell this to the sect master and let him negotiate.” The person beside him said.

Elder Qu said coldly, “Even if the Divine Alchemist Pavilion wants to protect him, it will have to see if it can protect him!”

Just as Elder Qu was about to leave, he suddenly felt a few strange streams of internal qi approaching him.

“Huh?”

Sensing these few powerful streams of internal qi, Elder Qu immediately frowned.

“Elder Qu, what’s wrong?” The person beside him hurriedly asked.

Elder Qu narrowed his eyes and said with a cold smile, “Perhaps we don’t need to do anything. The people from the Hong Yi Sect are here.”

...

Within the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Qin Yu was sitting in his Elder’s Residence while feeling uneasy.

He didn’t know what the Pavilion Master and Elder Qu were talking about. If he implicated the entire Divine Alchemist Pavilion, then he would be a sinner.

“Elder Qin, this is the dinner that the Pavilion Master asked us to prepare for you.”

At this moment, two apprentice alchemists squatted down and walked in.

Qin Yu hurriedly got up and asked anxiously, “How is the Pavilion Master?”

The two apprentice alchemists looked at each other and said, “The Pavilion Master is resting upstairs. Elder Qin, what’s the matter?”

Qin Yu was stunned. He asked tentatively, “Is the Pavilion Master injured?”

“Pfft!”

Hearing this, the two apprentice alchemists laughed out loud.

As they placed the dishes on the table, they said, “After serving Pavilion Master for so long, I have never seen her injured before. Elder Qin, you should hurry up and eat your dinner.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and nodded. “That’s good.”

Qin Yu had never knew about the Pavilion Master’s strength very clearly.

Now that he had stepped into the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, the enemies that came after him were getting stronger and stronger. Qin Yu didn’t have much confidence in himself.

After wolfing down the meal, Qin Yu patted his stomach in satisfaction.

He looked in the direction of the warehouse with a hint of excitement in his eyes.

“Elder Qin, how have you been?”

At this moment, the Fifth Elder walked in from outside. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Seeing the Fifth Elder, Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and said politely, “Greetings, Fifth Elder.”

The Fifth Elder said jokingly, “Now that your position is above mine, I should be the one to greet you.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Fifth Elder, please don’t tease me.”

The Fifth Elder laughed out loud, and then he said seriously, “Let’s get down to business. Qin Yu, the people from Hong Yi Sect have already arrived.”

“So fast?!” Qin Yu, his face full of worry, suddenly stood up.

“Ten half-step Martial Marquises?” Qin Yu frowned.

The Fifth Elder nodded and said, “Yes, they are now around the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

The worry on Qin Yu’s face deepened.

That was ten half-step Martial Marquises!

No matter how strong the Pavilion Master was, could she withstand ten half-step Martial Marquises?

“It seems that I have to step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm as soon as possible.” Qin Yu immediately felt a little anxious.

If they couldn’t reach an agreement, who in the entire Divine Alchemist Pavilion could help the Pavilion Master?

As long as he stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, those ten half-step Martial Marquises wouldn’t be worth mentioning!

“Don’t worry too much.” Fifth Elder waved his hand and said.

“The Pavilion Master will help you think of a way. What you need to do now is to step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm as soon as possible.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I know. I am waiting for Pavilion Master’s notice.”

“Let’s go.” Fifth Elder said with a smile.

Qin Yu was stunned and said, “Where are we going?”

Fifth Elder said with a smile, “Pavilion Master is waiting for you at the entrance of the warehouse.”

Upon hearing that, Qin Yu said impatiently, “Then let’s hurry up and set off.”

The two of them walked out of the Elder’s Residence and headed towards the mysterious warehouse of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

At the entrance, the Pavilion Master was standing there and waiting quietly.

“Lord Pavilion Master.” Fifth Elder walked forward and bowed slightly.

The Pavilion Master nodded and then looked at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you can only stay inside for a month at most,” said the Pavilion Master.

Qin Yu nodded vigorously and said, “A month is enough!”

“After a month, regardless of whether you have stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm or not, you have to come out immediately. Do you understand?” said the Pavilion Master.

“Yes, Pavilion Master.” Qin Yu bowed and said.

“Go in.” The Pavilion Master gently raised his palm, and the door slowly opened.

The moment the door opened, a wave of medicinal fragrance rushed over.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, then strode into the warehouse.

The warehouse door closed slowly.

The Pavilion Master gently stretched her palm again, and a wave of light fell on the door.

This was a restrictive power. As long as one didn’t obtain the Pavilion Master’s permission, no one was allowed to enter.

It was the same method He Teng used back then. The only difference was that the Pavilion Master’s method was much more brilliant.

“Pavilion Master.” After Qin Yu entered, the Fifth Elder looked at the Pavilion Master.

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly and said, “Let’s go and meet them.”

The Fifth Elder frowned and said, “Those are ten half-step Martial Marquises. Do we need to inform the Law Enforcement Elders?”

“No need.” The Pavilion Master waved her hand.
