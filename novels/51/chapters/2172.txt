2173 Fighting Several True Saints

They coldly stared at Jue Wu, their eyes filled with chilling hostility.

“It’s you?” The Supreme Elder recognized Jue Wu. He frowned and said, “Dean Lei’s personal disciple, why did you bring bloodshed to my Yao family? Do you think that with Dean Lei protecting you, we dare not do anything to you?”

Jue Wu looked at them coldly and said, “I’m going to kill everyone in your Yao family, and none of you will be left alive!”

“This person is here for Qin Yu. There’s no need to talk nonsense with her. Just kill her!” an elder shouted.

A cold smile appeared on Jue Wu’s face. Then the internal qi on her body suddenly erupted. Terrifying Holy Power instantly spread throughout the heavens and earth!

After sensing this internal qi, the expressions of those few elders changed drastically!

“You’ve actually stepped into the True Saint Realm!” an elder exclaimed.

“No wonder you dared to behave atrociously in my Yao family. So it’s because you’ve already stepped into the True Saint Realm. But so what? You will definitely die if you dare to behave atrociously in my Yao family!” an elder shouted, then suddenly slapped his palm fiercely toward Jue Wu.

There was no sign of panic on Jue Wu’s face. She raised her palm and faced it head-on!

“Boom!” The two palms collided, resulting in a deafening sound.

Instantly, the powerful energy waves stirred up a storm, and the surrounding space seemed to collapse. Energy fluctuations spread in all directions from the center of the two, destroying all grass and trees and shattering the earth and rocks.

The cultivators of the Yao family retreated one after another. Their faces revealed fear sensing this terrifying impact.

The figures of Jue Wu and the Yao family’s elder froze on the spot. The surrounding air seemed to have frozen.

The collision between the two triggered intense energy fluctuations. The light was dazzling as if wanting to illuminate the entire world!

The two powerful forces collided, forming a massive energy vortex!

Lightning danced wildly in the air as if countless bolts of lightning were streaking across the sky. The raging flames burned everything around them into ashes. The cold air was piercingly cold, making people feel extremely cold. The Spiritual Energy Sword swept across like tens of thousands of troops charging forward.

The scene was as grand and magnificent as a battlefield!

Energy fluctuations raged, engulfing everything in the surroundings into the vortex of battle!

The Yao family’s formation instantly activated, protecting the Yao family. Otherwise, the entire Yao family would have been destroyed in an instant!

Before everyone could regain their senses, the elder had been sent flying. Half of his body was directly shattered, revealing his ghastly white bones, and his internal qi instantly became much weaker!

On the contrary, Jue Wu remained unscathed, standing there with an internal qi of frostiness and coldness all over her body.

The Yao family’s cultivators stared at this scene with their mouths agape. No one had expected the Yao family’s elder to be defeated so easily!

Although they were both True Saints, their powers were almost incomparable.

Jue Wu stood upright, emitting a cold and eerie internal qi. Her eyes were cold as she swept her gaze across the surrounding cultivators, conveying an unshakable dominance.

“Is this heaven’s favorite of the present era…” someone murmured.

As for the other elders of the Yao family, their expressions were cold. Looking at Jue Wu before them, their eyes could not help but have a hint of vigilance and solemnity.

“As expected of Dean Lei’s personal disciple,” the Supreme Elder said coldly.

“If we were in any other place, we might have died without a doubt if we met you. However, this is the Yao family! No matter who acted atrociously in the Yao family would definitely die!” the Supreme Elder shouted.

After a loud shout, several rays of light immediately appeared from all directions of the Yao family! At the center of the Yao family, extremely resplendent lights were emitted!

That was the Yao family’s magical artifact and formation, which had been activated at will!

The Supreme Elder raised his hands, and his hair swayed wildly. The corners of his clothes fluttered continuously as the light flickered. A massive formation appeared in front of him. The formation contained a powerful force like an indestructible fortress, protecting the Yao family’s cultivators.

The other elders of the Yao family also unleashed their own spells and supernatural powers. The magical artifacts on their bodies released a dazzling light that echoed with Supreme Elder’s formation.

An extremely oppressive internal qi instantly assailed his face. The magical artifacts suspended in the void emitted a destructive power. For a moment, even Jue Wu felt an unprecedented sense of oppression!

Immediately after, three True Saints walked out from the Yao family. Together, they activated a massive magical artifact into the sky!

A gigantic magical artifact floated over from the back of the Yao family. It was like a towering and majestic tower, emitting a dazzling light. The surface of the magical artifact was inlaid with numerous sparkling gems, each emitting powerful energy fluctuations.

This magical artifact was called the “Tower of Holy Light”.

The Tower of Holy Light towered into the clouds like a gigantic tower that reached the sky. It emitted a tremendously powerful light that illuminated the entire battlefield. A bright holy light gem was on the top of the magical artifact. The gem contained pure and sacred power.

The three True Saints of the Yao family stood before the Tower of Holy Light. They focused their attention and gathered their energy, injecting their power into the magical artifact. The Tower of Holy Light instantly emitted an even more intense light. The light shot straight into the clouds as if wanting to pierce through the sky.

Sensing the pressure emanating from the Tower of Holy Light, Jue Wu frowned slightly.

She knew how powerful this magical artifact was. It was the Yao family’s last trump card. Once it was activated, it would pose a tremendous threat to her. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“For so many years, I’ve never thought someone would dare to cause trouble in the Yao family. I’ve never thought the Yao family would activate the Tower of Holy Light because of a nobody like you!” Supreme Elder said coldly.

Jue Wu looked calm but could faintly sense a hint of danger in her heart.

As one of the nine great aristocratic families, no one knew how terrifying their treasure would be!

Several elders of the Yao family controlled the magic artifact together. The tower of Holy Light continuously emitted a sacred light. Every ray was extremely heavy, causing the void to collapse!

In the depths of the Yao family, Yao Qi was watching everything quietly with his hands behind his back.

Standing beside him was Yao Xi.

“Where is the dignity of the Yao family? We have been provoked time and time again!” Yao Xi gritted his teeth.

“Yan Ruoxue, and Jue Wu, they’re both here for Qin Yu,” Yao Qi glanced at him and said.

Yao Xi snorted lightly and said, “Yan Tianshi is the smartest. He deliberately let Qin Yu go and used others to do the dirty job.”

“Not necessary. With Yan Tianshi’s personality and strength, he doesn’t need to do so,” Yao Qi shook his head.

At this moment, he paused for a moment and continued to ask, “When a person dies, the dao disappears. Qin Yu is a person who no longer exists, but some people are willing to avenge him repeatedly, not hesitating to give up their lives. Can you do this?”
