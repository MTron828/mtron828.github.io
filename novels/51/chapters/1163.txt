Chapter 1164: Chapter 1,164, blood absorption 

Gu Xinghe looked at Tian jizi coldly and said, “That has nothing to do with you. You just need to tell me where Qin Yu is.”

Not only did Tian Jizi not answer, he closed his eyes again.

Gu Xinghe said with a sullen face, “Old man, don’t Be So Shameless! If you don’t tell me, I’ll kill you!”

“Even if I tell you, you’ll still kill me,”Tianji Zi said lightly.

Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but be stunned, then he laughed out loud, “You really have some skills! Okay, I Promise You, if you tell me, I’ll Never Kill You!”

“I won’t tell you.”Tianji zi shook his head.

“Today, whether I tell you or not, it’s the day I die.”

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and said, “Old Man, stop playing tricks on me! Are you going to say it or not?”

Tian Jizi could not be bothered to touch Ah Li, Gu Xinghe. He sat cross-legged with his eyes closed, as if he had passed away.

“You’re courting death!”

This undoubtedly angered Gu Xinghe. His palm shimmered and he said coldly, “If you still don’t say it, I’ll slap you to death right now!”

“If you want to kill me, then go ahead and do it. Even if you kill me, there’s no point. It’s just adding to your sin,”Tian Jizi said indifferently.

“You’re courting death!”

Gu Xinghe didn’t say anything else as his large hand covered Tian Jizi!

“No!”Seeing this, Zhai Xing’s expression immediately changed. He stretched out his hand to stop Gu Xinghe. However, with his strength, how could he stop him? !

His palm slapped Tian Jizi’s forehead, and Tian Jizi’s body instantly shattered into pieces, blood splattering in the hall.

The famous Tian Jizi had fallen just like that.

The fresh blood splattered on Gu Xinghe’s ferocious face, making him look like a devil.

Zhai Xing stood at the side, his face full of grief and indignation.

“Gu Xinghe, you... you shouldn’t have done this,”Zhai Xing muttered in a low voice.

Gu Xinghe glanced at Zhai Xing and sneered, “I’ve already entered the realm of invincibility. What can’t I Do?”

“I don’t believe that I can’t find him, Qin Yu!”

After saying this, Gu Xinghe turned around and left.

After walking out of the Hall, Gu Xinghe waved his hand casually and the entire hall instantly turned into ruins.

After killing Tian Jizi, Gu Xinghe once again arranged for people to look for Qin Yu and Yan Yongfu.

Unfortunately, no matter how much power he used, he could not find Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, I will definitely kill you...”Gu Xinghe murmured in a low voice, a trace of viciousness flashed across his face.

...

In a small village that did not know the border.

“Just like, Guess What Daddy Brought You?”A middle-aged father was carrying a little girl who was only a few years old.

The little girl rolled her big eyes and said with surprise, “Is it candy? Is It... is it a toy?”

The father took out a Barbie doll from his back with a smile and said dotingly, “Daddy bought it for you... pfft!”

Before he could finish his words, a bright light flashed in the sky.

The light was like a sharp blade, piercing through the father’s body and cutting his body into two.

His hand froze in mid-air, still holding the bloody Barbie doll in his hand.

Looking at her father who was only half a body left, the little girl’s pupils dilated, and she wailed loudly.

“Daddy, don’t die...”the little girl shook the half of her father’s body, and her tears were like broken beads.

In the sky, there stood a person who looked like a devil.

That person was none other than Gu Xinghe.

He put his hands behind his back and sneered, “Uncle Zhai Xing, how many people do you think I have to kill before Qin Yu appears?”

Zhai Xing’s expression was extremely ugly. He gritted his teeth and said, “They are all innocent people. Why... Why did you do this? !”

Gu xinghe laughed out loud, “They are just a bunch of ants. So what if I kill them? Why, do you feel sorry for them?”

“You are simply not human!”Zhai Xing gritted his teeth and said.

Gu Xinghe raised his eyebrows. Not only did he not feel ashamed, he even said proudly, “Of course I am not human. I Am the god of this world!”

After he said that, Gu Xinghe suddenly raised his palm. A huge palm immediately flashed in the sky. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The palm covered the sky and the earth as it came crushing down.

In an instant, the village turned into ruins, and everything vanished into thin air.

“Alright, it’s time to go to the next one,”Gu Xinghe said faintly.

Having said that, he turned around and left.

Zhai Xing stared at the broken walls below, his face full of pain.

Gu Xinghe’s massacre spread very quickly.

However, he did not have the slightest scruple. Instead, he became more and more arrogant.

In just a few days, countless innocent people had died at Gu Xinghe’s hands.

The martial arts forum condemned him. There were even a large number of righteous people who came together to demand an explanation.

However, how could Gu Xinghe, who was already crazy, give them an explanation? The only thing that welcomed them was death.

...

In the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu was still absorbing the blood.

The blood and Qin Yu’s body continued to merge together, as if it was tempering his body, time and time again.

In just a few days, Qin Yu’s body had been reconstructed hundreds of times.

Even though his state had not improved at all, his strength had soared!

This should have been a good thing, but Qin Yu’s heart was always filled with a trace of unease.

This unease had appeared from the moment Gu Xinghe was born, and now it had reached its peak.

“No.”Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

He closed every pore in his body on his own and forcefully stopped the absorption of the blood.

The absorption stopped at this moment, but the blood still covered Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu’s body shook slightly and the blood fell off. Then, he used the jar to collect it again.

Yan Yongfu couldn’t help but frown. “It’s not over yet. Why did you stop?”

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Yongfu and said, “I have to go out. I keep feeling like something big has happened outside.”
