Chapter 780: Snatching the Pill Formula Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Xue Yuzhi said with a nonchalant smile, “There are some things that cannot be rushed.”

After saying that, Xue Yuzhi looked at the door and said, “If there is anything, you can inform the people outside.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only nod.

After Xue Yuzhi left, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache temporarily stayed here.

He released his divine sense to cover the surroundings and discovered that there were many martial artists in the Xue family.

However, these martial artists weren’t all top-notch. Instead, there were many weak ones.

For example, Inner Strength Grandmasters, and even Inner Strength Past Masters.

“How can there be Inner Strength Past Masters in the Xue family?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

The difference in strength between the Xue family was a little big. Not only were there Martial Marquises, there were even Inner Strength Past Masters.

This simply didn’t make sense. A family with a Martial Marquis definitely wouldn’t take Inner Strength Past Masters seriously.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. After all, there might be geniuses in the Inner Strength Past Masters realm.

In the blink of an eye, night arrived.

However, the Xue family didn’t make any movements, and no one came to inform Qin Yu.

This made Qin Yu a little anxious.

He stood up and walked to the door. He said politely to the person outside the door, “May I ask if Auntie Xue has come?”

“No,” the person said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu said in puzzlement, “I’m here to refine pills for the Xue family. Why hasn’t the Xue family made any movements?”

The person glanced at Qin Yu and sneered. “You’re not the only one who refines pills for the Xue family. You’d better wait patiently.”

Only then did Qin Yu come to a realization.

It turned out that the Xue family hadn’t invited him alone.

Those weaker Inner Strength Past Masters might have been the alchemists that the Xue family had invited.

“Looks like there is still a need for competition.” Qin Yu rubbed his chin as he thought to himself.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion had gathered Pyro’s most elite alchemists. But in the entire world, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion wasn’t the only pavilion that was dominant.

Hence, it was normal for the Xue family to have invited other alchemists.

“The concentric pill... Have you heard of this pill before?” Qin Yu asked as he looked at the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “You are an alchemist, yet you ask me? I have never heard of the concentric pill before.”

Qin Yu said softly, “The concentric pill is a Divine Rank pill. In the current era, most of the Divine Rank pill formulas have already been lost.”

What troubled Qin Yu the most was that there was no concentric pill formula in his inherited memories.

That night, Qin Yu searched for an entire night, but he still couldn’t find the concentric pill.

“This is bad.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but touch the tip of his nose.

If he didn’t have the concentric pill formula, then this trip was destined to be in vain. He could forget about the power of a Martial Saint.

At this moment, the sound of knocking came from outside.

In a short while, a man walked in.

“Who is Qin Yu?” He asked after entering the door.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “I am.”

“Follow me,” the man said.

Qin Yu didn’t hesitate. He immediately stood up and followed the man out of the room.

They arrived at a certain square in the Xue family’s manor.

At that moment, there were already dozens of people gathered in the square!

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “Why are there so many people? Could it be that they are all alchemists?”

“That’s right.” The man nodded and said.

“These people come from all over the world and they all claim to be able to concoct the concentric pill.”

Qin Yu swept his gaze over and discovered that among these people, not only were there people from Pyro, but there were also many foreigners with blonde hair and blue eyes.

“The Xue family has actually invited so many alchemists.” Qin Yu suddenly felt a sense of crisis in his heart.

With so many people, there was no guarantee that none of them would be able to obtain the pill formula of the concentric pill.

He swept his gaze across everyone present and a vicious thought suddenly emerged in his heart.

That was to snatch the pill formula from these people’s hands! In that case, the concentric pill wouldn’t be a problem!

Although his thoughts were a little vicious, Qin Yu had no other choice.

Qin Yu must obtain the power of a Martial Saint.

“Wait here.” That man said these words and then left in a hurry.

Qin Yu stood there silently and waited quietly.

The people around him all had strange expressions on their faces. They looked incomparably arrogant.

They didn’t communicate with each other at all. It was as if they were enemies.

Ten minutes later.

Xue Yuzhi and two men appeared in front of them.

The two men were Xue Yuzhi’s brothers, Xue Yujie and Xue Yuchen.

The three of them stood on high ground and looked down from above. All they could see were alchemists.

“Thank you for coming all the way here,” Xue Yujie said.

“My father is in urgent need of a concentric pill. Whoever can refine the concentric pill will be rewarded handsomely!”

At this point, Xue Yujie stretched out three fingers and said, “I will only give you three days. After three days, I hope that you can bring the pill and gather here again.”

“As for the herbs, you can directly go to the herb warehouse to collect them.”

Everyone present bowed and said, “Mr. Xue, please rest assured.”

Xue Yujie grunted, then waved his hand and said, “Everyone, don’t waste your time. Gather here on time in three days.”

After saying this, the three people of the Xue family turned around and left.

Qin Yu looked at an alchemist beside him and said, “Do you really have the pill formula for the concentric pill?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s none of your business!” The alchemist glared at Qin Yu and turned to leave.

After Qin Yu was rejected, he couldn’t help but feel a little awkward.

Many of the alchemists present rushed to the herbs warehouse, but Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry.

Without the pill formula in his hands, even if he went to the herbs warehouse, he didn’t know what to get.

After returning to his residence, Qin Yu was troubled for a moment.

“How is it?” The man with the mustache came forward and asked.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “The Xue family has found at least dozens of alchemists, and I’m only one of them.”

“So many?” The man with the mustache was also a little surprised.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes. The most important thing is that I don’t have the formula for the concentric pill at all.”

“Then why are you here?” The man with the mustache said.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “We can only take it one step at a time. Maybe we can find another way.”

At this moment, Xue Yuzhi pushed the door open and walked in.

Qin Yu hurriedly got up and said, “Auntie Xue.”

Xue Yuzhi nodded slightly and said with a smile, “How is it going?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and lied, “No problem, but... why did the Xue family invite so many pharmacists? Don’t tell me they all have the formula for the concentric pill?”

“No.” Xue Yuzhi shook her head.

“I told you, the Sheng Kingdom is a country with very poor supervision. Many forces are stationed here.”

“Many people came because of our reputation. In these three days, they will certainly inquire about the news, find out who has the recipe for the concentric pill, and then snatch the recipe for the concentric pill.”

As soon as these words were said, Qin Yu was a bit surprised.

Wasn’t this a coincidence? This plan really coincided with his own.
