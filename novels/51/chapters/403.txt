Chapter 404: A Massacre Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s face was beneath the mask.

Upon seeing this face, everyone’s expressions changed drastically!

“It’s really Qin Yu!” Jing Shihong was the first to shout!

“Qin Yu, you actually dared to lie to us! How despicable and shameless!”

“The treasure must have been stolen by you. Hurry up and hand it over!”

In the face of everyone’s angry roars, Qin Yu was calm and composed, and no expression could be seen on his face.

“Qin Yu, you’re really audacious. Today, you won’t be able to escape death!” Jing Shihong said coldly.

Qin Yu waved his hand, and a slap landed on Jing Shihong’s face!

“Pa!” Jing Shihong’s entire body was sent flying!

“Noisy thing,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Seeing this scene, the crowd immediately fell into a deathly silence!

Sending a peak-stage Inner Strength Inner Strength Grandmaster flying with a single slap? Was he really an Inner Strength Past Master?

“Let go of me quickly...” Yan Haoran roared in pain.

Qin Yu sneered. “On account that you’re Yan Ruoxue’s younger brother, I can spare you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu let go of his hand.

Yan Haoran, who had been given a breather, felt that fresh air was so wonderful for the first time.

He was gasping for breath on the ground. Then, he gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, you killed my grandfather and stole the treasure. How should you be punished?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “The Yan family knows better than anyone how your grandfather died. You want to frame me? Dream on.”

How could Yan Haoran listen to these words? He pointed at Qin Yu and shouted, “Go kill him! Whoever kills Qin Yu will be the leader of the northern martial arts world!”

With such a generous reward, there would definitely be people willing to take a risk. As soon as these words were spoken, someone immediately clenched his fist and rushed towards Qin Yu!

A bright light streaked across the horizon. At this moment, the power of a peak Inner Strength Inner Strength Grandmaster was fully displayed!

On the other hand, Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch. He even closed his eyes.

“Boom!”

A huge explosion resounded!

Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch.

Not a single white spot was left on his body.

“How... how is this possible!?” The attacker raised his head and looked at Qin Yu with beads of sweat forming on his forehead!

Qin Yu grinned and said, “A peak Inner Strength Inner Strength Grandmaster is only so-so.”

Qin Yu’s palm was already glowing!

The golden palm drew an arc, and with a slap, it landed on the Inner Strength Inner Strength Grandmaster’s body!

“Swoosh!”

This strike shattered his body! His bones were broken!

“How is this possible!?” Everyone was shocked by this scene!

What kind of battle prowess was this? A peak Inner Strength Inner Strength Grandmaster was actually unable to retaliate against him?

“I’ll give you guys a chance. Submit to me, and I’ll spare your lives.” Qin Yu said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

“Submit to you? In your dreams!” Bi Guocang was the first to shout!

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s body suddenly disappeared.

In the next second, a huge golden fist appeared in front of his eyes! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Boom!

The fist was like a cannonball as it smashed into Bi Guocang’s body!

In just an instant, Bi Guocang turned into a pile of flesh!

Even his human form couldn’t be seen!

“He killed a peak-stage Inner Strength Inner Strength Grandmaster with one punch...” Jing Shihong swallowed hard, and his legs couldn’t help but tremble.

“Oh no, I promised Fang Yue that I would bring his head back.” Looking at the pile of flesh on the ground, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

“Forget it, bringing his head back is too bloody. It’s better to just kill him.” Qin Yu muttered to himself.

Before everyone could react, Qin Yu had already arrived in front of Jing Shihong!

“Don’t... Don’t kill me!” Jing Shihong shouted in fear.

How could Qin Yu give him the chance? He immediately raised his hand and pinched Jing Shihong’s head.

The Heaven Swallowing Technique instantly appeared, and Jing Shihong’s body rapidly withered!

Another Inner Strength Inner Strength Grandmaster had fallen!

“How comfortable. As expected of a peak Inner Strength Inner Strength Grandmaster.” After absorbing Jing Shihong, Qin Yu took a satisfied breath.

Seeing this scene, the crowd couldn’t help but tremble.

Qin Yu was simply like a devil! A devil that treated human lives like grass!

“It’s your turn.” Qin Yu looked at the crowd and grinned.

“Qin Yu, don’t be too arrogant!” Mr. Tang stepped out and shouted.

“This kid only has a strong physical body, but in front of me, a spiritual master, he’s not worth mentioning! I can destroy his divine sense at any time!” Mr. Tang said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered. “You? Do you think you’re qualified to be called a spiritual master?”

“Ignorant child! I will let you get a taste of spiritual power right now!” Mr. Tang roared angrily!

Then, spots of light flickered between his brows, and rays of light rushed toward Qin Yu!

This was the power of divine sense! It could penetrate through the body and attack the divine sense, and it was also Mr. Tang’s specialty skill!

“Watch how I destroy your divine sense!” Mr. Tang roared crazily!

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and didn’t move an inch.

Just as the light was about to touch Qin Yu, rays of golden light also flashed between Qin Yu’s brows!

The light turned into a sharp blade and slashed toward Mr. Tang’s divine sense!

“Pooch!”

The divine sense power that Mr. Tang transformed into was cut into two halves by a sword!

“Ah!”

The pain was like needles stabbing into his head. It caused Mr. Tang to stagger and almost fall down.

Before he could withdraw his divine sense, Qin Yu had already waved his hand and crushed Mr. Tang’s divine sense!

Mr. Tang, who had lost his divine sense, instantly became a corpse and fell to the ground.

“Didn’t anyone tell you that there’s a price for acting tough?” Qin Yu looked at Mr. Tang’s corpse and couldn’t help but sneer.

As one Inner Strength Inner Strength Grandmaster after another fell, everyone began to panic.

However, they knew very well in their hearts that begging for mercy was useless. They could only fight to the death.

“Buzz!”

Someone used a secret treasure and threw a huge round plate at Qin Yu.

The round plate flew towards Qin Yu!

However, Qin Yu punched it!

With one punch, the secret treasure was smashed into pieces!

In an instant, countless secret treasures were thrown out at this moment!

As Peak Inner Strength Grandmasters, they naturally had an abundant amount of resources.

But now, they discovered that all of their resources were useless against this man!

Because his fist was the strongest secret treasure in the world!

Explosions occurred continuously, and all of the secret treasures were shattered!

The spells they used were unable to stop Qin Yu’s slaughter!

“Dragon Locking Spell!” Someone roared. Countless chains immediately appeared beneath Qin Yu’s feet and bound him tightly!

“Everyone, run!” Taking advantage of this chance, they hurriedly shouted.

“What a petty trick. You want to stop me with just this?” Qin Yu’s internal qi suddenly erupted, and all the chains were shattered into pieces!
