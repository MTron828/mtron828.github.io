Chapter 306: Longhu Team Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When he heard this, Qin Yu immediately became interested in Fang Yue.

Fang Yue wasn’t weak, and her ambition wasn’t small either.

“What about Jing Lu? Was he abandoned by you just like that?” Qin Yu asked with a nonchalant smile.

Fang Yue placed a hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder and said with a chuckle, “Can Jing Lu compare to you? I don’t care about feelings. I only care about value.”

“That’s what I want.” Qin Yu nodded.

Qin Yu had inquired about Fang Yue, and she was quite well-connected.

By relying on her charm, she had bewitched many important figures.

In the future, when he went to Jingdu, she might be able to help him.

“Mr. Qin, what do you think?” Fang Yue raised her eyebrows and asked.

“Deal!” Qin Yu stood up and shook hands with Fang Yue.

Fang Yue smiled and said, “Then I won’t bother you anymore.”

After saying that, Fang Yue turned around and walked out of the door.

When she reached the door, Fang Yue suddenly stopped and said mysteriously, “There’s a surprise in that inner core.”

Before Qin Yu could ask, Fang Yue had already left.

In the empty room, Qin Yu was sizing up this inner core.

The inner core was flickering with a demonic light.

“Fang Yue won’t harm me, right?” Qin Yu scratched his head and thought to himself.

Fang Yue swallowed an inner core and obtained the power of charm.

Then, what kind of effect would he get after swallowing this one?

“I think this inner core will not only increase my strength, but it will probably bring unexpected benefits.”

Qin Yu didn’t think any further and immediately swallowed the inner core.

After that, he began to sit cross-legged and dredge his meridians.

As one of the strongest physiques, the chaotic body’s tolerance was extremely strong!

There was almost nothing that the chaotic body couldn’t swallow.

However, after Qin Yu swallowed this inner core, he felt as if his entire dantian was being rebuilt!

Waves of magical power flowed through Qin Yu’s meridians and into his entire body!

Following that, it wrapped around his internal organs, from the inside to the outside, all the way to his skin

Such a magical effect caused Qin Yu to turn pale with fright!

He felt his entire body making incessant crackling sounds!

In a short moment, Qin Yu’s skin began to contract!

The toughness and strength of his body were rapidly increasing!

A strange force filled Qin Yu’s body!

After more than ten minutes, this strange feeling finally began to disappear, and the terrifying spiritual energy within it exploded!

“Hmm?” Qin Yu’s brows twitched. He seemed to feel that he had the possibility of stepping into the second level of the Monastic Stage!

As expected, this spiritual energy was attacking every acupoint in his body with all its might!

After an hour, a comfortable feeling spread throughout his body.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s strength had reached another level!

“This inner core... can actually enhance my body and strength!” Qin Yu finally understood Fang Yue’s intention!

This inner core was indeed more suitable for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu, whose body was already incomparably tough, had now reached a terrifying state!

“With this body and the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth, no one below the level five Inner Strength Grandmaster realm would be able to break it!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel somewhat excited.

More importantly, not only had this pill reconstructed his skin, but even his internal organs had been greatly improved!

“This inner core... is really quite nice.” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

A strange force appeared in his body, and this strange force had fused with Qin Yu’s body.

Just the strength of his body alone was enough for him to fight against an Inner Strength Grandmaster!

It was only a matter of time before he went to Jingdu!

...

The next day, after Qin Yu woke up, he planned to leave with Yao Qing.

On the way back to Chuzhou, Qin Yu kept feeling as if he had forgotten an important matter.

Qin Yu racked his brains, but he still couldn’t remember what it was.

“Forget it, I’ll just ignore it,” Qin Yu muttered, then leaned against the plane and fell asleep.

In the Chuzhou region, on a huge training field, dozens of well-built men were standing there neatly.

They were all carefully selected soldiers from the Chuzhou region, and they formed a special combat team.

The team was called the Longhu team, and they were about to participate in the year-end competition.

“Mr. Wu, why hasn’t Qin Yu come yet?” A dignified-looking middle-aged man asked with a frown.

Mr. Wu said anxiously, “Commander Long, don’t worry. I’ll call him again.”

After saying that, Mr. Wu walked to the side with his cell phone and called Qin Yu.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu’s phone was turned off. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This gave Mr. Wu a headache. At this critical moment, Qin Yu had disappeared!

“Commander Long, the call didn’t go through...” Mr. Wu said apologetically.

Commander Long snorted coldly and said, “Since he doesn’t want to come, then forget it. It’s better for my people to carry out the special training.”

After saying that, he waved his hand, and a young man walked forward.

“This is my proudest disciple, named Xue Hu. He is not only an Inner Strength Grandmaster, but also has excellent training experience.”

Speaking up to this point, Commander Long paused for a moment, and then said with some pride, “The most important thing is that he has a training plan in his hands.”

“And this plan came from Ye Qing!”

Mr. Wu was stunned and hurriedly said, “Are you serious?”

“Of course!” Commander Long said with a nonchalant smile.

“Although it’s a weakened version, it came from officer Ye Qing. The effect is still beyond imagination.”

When he heard this, Mr. Wu couldn’t help but frown.

It had to be said that a weakened version of Ye Qing’s plan was indeed very tempting.

If it was in the past, Mr. Wu would definitely agree to it without hesitation.

But now, Mr. Wu remembered Qin Yu’s promise.

He had said that he would let the Chuzhou region win first place this year!

And Ye Qing’s weakened version of the training plan definitely would not win first place. After all, there was also the Jingdu Military Zone.

“Commander Long, why don’t we wait? I believe that Qin Yu will definitely come,” Mr. Wu said with a frown.

Commander Long couldn’t help but frown when he heard that. “So what if he comes? So what if he doesn’t come? Do you think that Qin Yu’s training plan can be compared to Ye Qing’s plan?”

Mr. Wu said with some embarrassment, “But... Qin Yu said that he will let the Chuzhou region get first place this year...”
