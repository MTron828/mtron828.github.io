Chapter 2424: Old Friend Came to Visit

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking back at the past, it felt like yesterday.

“I wonder how Wen Er and Master Wen Wanchong are doing. I haven’t seen them for a long time.”

Thinking of the deceased Wen Da, Qin Yu’s eyes welled up with tears instantly.

“Time flies. In the blink of an eye, so many years have passed. Yao Meng and I coincidentally have a family mission and passed by Thunder Courtyard. So we thought of meeting up with you.”

Jiang He nodded and sighed with emotion.

“Yao Meng, you’ve already reached the second level of the Soul Statue, and so has Big Brother Jiang He.”

Qin Yu turned to look at Yao Meng and exclaimed.

Yao Meng had wasted a lot of time in the Holy Region. She did not expect to catch up and be in the first batch to break through.

Moreover, she had reached the Tribulation Second Level Soul Statu in such a short time. This kind of talent was truly terrifying.

“I have to thank you. If you hadn’t helped me solve my problem, I’m afraid I would still be a good-for-nothing now.”

She would have given up on the Yao family long ago if it wasn’t for Qin Yu. Yao Meng was very grateful for this.

“Haha, little brother Qin Yu, you alone exterminated the Ji family. In front of you, don’t talk about strange things such as talent.”

Jiang He stroked his beard. Although his lifespan would be greatly extended and his appearance would become younger as his cultivation advanced, Jiang He did not want to change his appearance.

“However, one will draw unnecessary attention by being prominent. I came here, this time, to remind you that you now have a treasure. Inevitably, people will eye on you. You must be careful.”

Jiang He, like a senior, reminded Qin Yu.

“Don’t worry, Big Brother Jiang He. Previously, I had conflicts with the Jiang family and the Yao family. Did I cause any trouble for you?”

“Yao Xi roared. I’m now the saintess of the sect, and my status is completely different from previously. Also, the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor has already fallen into your hands. Right now, the combat prowess of the Yao family is basically outside of the nine great aristocratic families. However, you have to be careful. The Supreme Elder of the Yao family has already returned from purgatory. Among them, there’s a person I feel is dangerous. I’m afraid he will act against you.”

Yao Meng reminded Qin Yu. The two sides had almost become mortal enemies, and there was no way to resolve the deep-seated hatred.

Qin Yu’s heart warmed. Of course, he knew how much trouble their reminders would bring to them. If the news leaked, the two might be severely punished by their families.

A slight breeze rustled by as gentle as a soft caress to the face.

A black shadow stepped out of the void and came behind Yao Meng.

The space did not even fluctuate.

Yao Meng’s expression changed drastically. The Immortal Emperor’s corpse of the Yao family had appeared behind her at some point. Its indifferent eyes locked onto Yao Meng.

“Boom!”

The Immortal Emperor’s corpse suddenly attacked and punched Yao Meng’s body.

The Yao family’s Immortal Emperor had already recovered a trace of his divine sense with the help of Qin Yu’s Soul Torment Mind Technique. His attacks now contained a little bit of power of the technique.

Compared to the brute force previously, the power was several times greater.

Qin Yu was about to attack, but Yao Meng shouted to stop him.

“Qin Yu, please don’t attack. If I can’t even defeat a trace of ancestor’s soul, I no longer need to continue cultivating.”

Yao Meng showed no fear. A harp appeared in her hand, and the crisp sound of the harp rang out.

The sound wave surged like a tidal wave. With the sound waves pressing ahead, it transformed under the fist of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor’s corpse. After it was compressed to the extreme, it suddenly exploded.

Yao Meng retreated using this force. However, almost simultaneously, the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor appeared in front of her again.

He punched out again.

This time, a vague phenomenon of the way appeared on the tip of that fist.

The corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor used a trace of power of the way. Although it was only a trace, this power had already increased exponentially.

Qin Yu sensed it and realized the power of this punch had reached the Soul Sinking, which was far beyond Yao Meng’s power.

Qin Yu immediately activated the chaotic qi in his body, ready to support her at any time.

“Please don’t. I feel it’s Yao Meng’s opportunity. The Immortal Emperor’s corpse didn’t attack me and only targeted Yao Meng, who has the Yao family’s bloodline. It’s very likely a test to Yao Meng.” Jiang He seemed to have noticed something.

Yao Meng did not show any fear.

Among her delicate fingers, a melodious sound of the zither once again blossomed from the zither’s body. It carried a majestic and kingship aura.

In an instant, the surging sound of the sea of the Path of Heaven suddenly descended on this world, and the phantom of Soul Statue appeared behind Yao Meng.

A pure kingship power surged into Yao Meng’s body.

Following that, the sonorous zither music suddenly blasted out, and the zither music transformed into an enormous domineering figure that walked toward the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor step by step.

The countless souls and power of spiritual energy in the surrounding space suddenly gathered into that figure, making his strength even greater.

These powers seemed to have willingly become a part of the figure. Before launching the attack, its aura had already reached its peak.

Then, under the guidance of the kingship power, it finally gathered into a golden fist qi and clashed fiercely with the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor.

“Boom!”

The kingship figure shattered, but it had received the punch.

“To be able to withstand the punch of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor with the power of the Tribulation Second Level Soul Statue, Yao Meng’s understanding of the Yao family’s immortal scripture is indeed tremendously deep!”

Jiang He’s face was full of amazement. It was not that easy to challenge someone of a higher level.

This was especially true for the Tribulation Transcending Stage. Each cultivation realm could only advance after a deeper understanding of the rules. Those who could challenge those of a higher realm were typically individuals with exceptional talent.

Yao Meng stepped into the air like a butterfly and landed ten thousand meters

away.

However, the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor did not seem to allow Yao Meng to catch her breath. Almost at the same time, it arrived in front of Yao Meng.

A soul fluctuation surged from its body.

The majestic power of divine sense slammed on Yao Meng’s body, but it happened so fast that Qin Yu did not even have time to react before Yao Meng was hit.

“Yao Meng! Are you alright?”

Qin Yu exclaimed.

“Don’t worry, I’m alright. The Yao family’s Immortal Emperor didn’t attack me.”

Yao Meng’s face was pale. Just now, she felt like she was going to die.

However, she did not expect the punch of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor to only send her comprehension of divine sense into the sea of consciousness and not cause any harm to her.

“Qin Yu, I’ve gained a lot this time, and I truly owe you a favor that may be difficult to repay.”

Yao Meng said with a bitter smile. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Hahaha, then be my bodyguard for free in the future.”

After doing all this, the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor entered the void and stood quietly.

As it dreaded the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes, it would stay away from it for a distance.

The moment Qin Yu brought Coffin of Nine Lifetimes up close to it, it would immediately leave and maintain a distance from Qin Yu as if it did not want to be suppressed inside..
