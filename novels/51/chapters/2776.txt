Chapter 2777: The Holy Body- Divine Might Chasing Star

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi- Bo Studio

The sound was dull but deafening. It was not any weaker than the shocking thunder.

Starting from his spine, his physical strength would increase one level after every explosion.

A terrifying power exploded from his palm at the last sound.

An astonishing purple lightning internal qi erupted. A terrifying power penetrated Qin Yu’s body.

It hit a mountain peak tens of thousands of meters behind Qin Yu, revealing a huge pit.

Half of Qin Yu’s body slowly melted. A translucent power circulated his body.

“Power of the dream! The rumors are true. He obtained the Soul Suppression Ring. ”

Aiden looked at the strange power. His eyes were filled with horror.

This kind of close cultivation realm combat made them feel stronger.

The number one kulapati had completely surpassed this category.

Wake up from the dream! Enjoy the simple life!

Qin Yu stretched lazily. That dream-like power covered his body.

His entire body turned transparent.

He arrived in front of Chang Mang in the next moment. Silver holy energy was wreaking havoc from his skeleton.

Vast Qi of Milky Way!

Qin Yu also punched out. The entire Nine Nether Cliff seemed to flash with a bolt of huge silver lightning. The cliff was covered in a layer of silver light.

“Come on!”

Chang Mang’s face turned solemn. Qin Yu’s physical strength was also somewhat exaggerated, giving him an immense sense of pressure. He crossed his arms and barely blocked Qjn Yu’s full-powered punch.

His body was sent flying a hundred meters away.

Purple-red flames burned on his body when he landed. Countless black lights flashed around him.

These were spatial cracks that had been torn open by his body.

Heaven Suppressing Pagoda!

That violent power suddenly spread out and covered Qin Yu within it. In an instant, Qin Yu felt a beast-like divine sense firmly lock onto him. “Heaven Suppression Pagoda, Heaven Punishing Palm! ”

The palm prints that filled the sky finally fused into one that appeared at the front of Qin Yu.

The palm print covered the entire world in Qin Yu’s vision.

A terrifying force slammed down on his head.

Boom!

The entire ground seemed to have sunk a little.

Even Qin Yu’s physical body could not withstand the terrifying power.

The Night Qi spread throughout his body and completely diverted this power.

“Stop it! Stop it! I can’t beat you! The battle means nothing. What’s the point?” Chang Mang was dumbfounded.

Qin Yu returned completely fine after his full-strength attack. He lay on the ground and panted heavily.

‘You’re something! Your Heaven Suppression Pagoda has consumed a large amount of my Night Qi. If it continues to grow, I’m afraid the power of the Dao of Dreams will be completely useless!”

Qin Yu gasped.

Only he could understand how powerful Chang Mang’s palm strike was. If he had not unleashed nearly half of his Night Qi, the power of that palm strike would have been impossible to neutralize.

“Is this the peak power?”

Aiden was curious.

He had also benefited greatly from the hearty battle just now.

“I guess so! My peak power can be considered a kind of will. In any case, it’s an invincible will in battle. Even the world has to be suppressed. I accidentally awakened it during the battle here but I haven’t figured out the specifics yet.”

Chang Mang scratched his head.

“However, it seems that there are other power bonuses!”

Qin Yu frowned. He seemed to have sensed the power of Saint Kingdom from Chang Mang’s body.

“That’s right. It’s the power of the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom. For some reason, my holy body, the Divine Might Chasing Star, can fuse the power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom into it. Moreover, it seems to be able to play a role in battle. I can recover at a breakneck speed if I am heavily injured.”

Chang Mang answered doubtfully.

“Have the nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom fused?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“No, it’s in the nine acupoints in my body. I don’t know anyway. As long as I refine my holy body, I can absorb the Heart of the Saint Kingdom directly.”

“Hmm? It’s strange. Could it be that the Divine Might Chasing Star’s holy body had something to do with the Heart of Saint Kingdom? Or is this power more compatible with the Heart of Saint Kingdom?”

Qin Yu was slightly puzzled. Chang Mang’s power towards the Heart of Saint Kingdom seemed completely different from his.

Qin Yu immediately took out the Vessel, Divine Shield, and two Hearts of Saint Kingdom.

Then, he erased the mark on it.

“Why don’t you try?”

Chang Mang’s body seemed to have sensed something and a violent power erupted from his body.

Then, that power completely wrapped around Qin Yu’s palm. A hint of desire was emitted from that power.

“It’s so magical! ”

Qin Yu curiously released the Heart of Saint Kingdom.

Chang Mang’s strength was like a palm, wrapped around the two Hearts of Saint Kingdom and pulled them into his body.

After a flash of light, Chang Mang’s body seemed to have undergone some transformation. “Have you refined it?”

“I think so.”

Chang Mang seemed to be at a loss as to what was going on.

“Little sissy, since you’re so knowledgeable, why don’t you introduce us?”

Chang Mang asked Aiden. “Are you courting death?”

Aiden’s ears pricked up.

An arrow smashed down, causing Chang Mang to howl in pain.

Qin Yu’s expression was a little strange. It seemed like these two had fought before, otherwise Chang Mang would not have treated him with such an attitude.

“Stop! Stop fighting!”

Qin Yu hurriedly tried to dissuade them.

“Do you feel anything special after fusing the Heart of Saint Kingdom into your body?”

“No, but I feel that my power has become stronger. This also happened before.” Chang Mang frowned.

He struck out hundreds of palm qi again without using his full strength.

However, Qin Yu unexpectedly felt that there was a bit more dense power between this palm energy.

This power was the power of the Divine Shield.

If not for the fact that his current soul power was already terrifyingly powerful, he would not have been able to detect this difference.

In other words, after Chang Mang absorbed the Heart of Saint Kingdom, his peak power could stimulate the power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom and even the skills hidden within.

Qin Yu’s expression was a little strange. Could it be that the Heart of Saint Kingdom was made for Chang Mang?

After reaching the Dao Realm, the Heart of Saint Kingdom skill was too insignificant.

Its power was too weak and could not be used during many times.

For example, the Seal of Heaven Returning at the Human Consciousness realm could restore time.

However, the power of the Seal of Heaven Returning would be greatly suppressed when it faced the Dao Consciousness experts after Qin Yu had reached the realm.

Not to mention the power of the Eight Trigrams, God’s Space, and even the power of the Heavenly Sin.

However, Chang Mang was different. His holy body did not seem to have absorbed a single drop of Saint Power.

He could directly refine it and transform it into his power..Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
