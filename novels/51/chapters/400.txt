Chapter 401: A Breakthrough Was Imminent Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In the huge pit, Qin Yu and Xiao Yu searched around.

Unfortunately, other than this mask, there was nothing else.

There was only endless dark energy.

“The dark energy here is so dense, so let’s cultivate in seclusion here,” Qin Yu said to Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu nodded. She sat cross-legged next to Qin Yu and began to absorb the dark energy from the huge pit.

Endless dark energy surged into Xiao Yu’s body.

Its speed far surpassed Qin Yu’s.

Because of Xiao Yu’s influence, Qin Yu’s absorption of dark energy became somewhat difficult.

This also confirmed Qin Yu’s thought.

There must be a myriad of connections between Xiao Yu and the ghost mask!

Helpless, Qin Yu had no choice but to let Xiao Yu go to the stone house to cultivate alone.

As for Qin Yu, he sat under the light of the huge pit and slowly absorbed the dark energy from the huge pit.

As a chaotic body, Qin Yu had a natural advantage.

The absorption of dark energy was extremely smooth. Through the Meridian Circulation Technique, Qin Yu’s speed improved by leaps and bounds.

Currently, Qin Yu was already at the peak of the Inner Strength Past Master realm. With just one step, he would be able to step into the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm!

‘When I step into the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, I will definitely trigger the heavenly tribulation. At that time, I won’t be able to hide it anymore.’ Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the people in the huge pit as he thought to himself.

Of course, as long as Qin Yu stepped into the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, he would no longer need to fear those people.

He was invincible among those of the same level.

Time passed minute by minute. Qin Yu ravenously absorbed the dark energy from the huge pit.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

The people above were still waiting.

“D*mn it, it’s been so long. Is this guy dead?” Jing Shihong couldn’t help but mutter.

Yan Haoran glanced at Jing Shihong and said, “Don’t rush. Wait patiently.”

Even though he said so, Yan Haoran was also a little anxious.

No one knew how long they would have to wait, let alone whether there was a treasure in this huge pit.

In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.

However, there was still no movement in the huge pit.

Jing Shihong couldn’t hold it in any longer.

He laid on the huge pit and shouted, “Are you dead?!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu opened his eyes and said nonchalantly, “I won’t die even if you die.”

Jing Shihong said angrily, “Do you know who you are talking to?! I will kill you!”

“Alright, come down.” Qin Yu sneered.

“You!” Jing Shihong was instantly furious.

Qin Yu continued, “Young Master Yan said that as long as I go up, the leader of the northern martial arts world will be me! As your superior, even if I scold you a little, you have to endure it!”

“F * ck you...” Jing Shihong was angry.

He was at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, yet he was scolded by a person at the Inner Strength Past Master realm!

“Shut up!” Yan Haoran said coldly.

“That guy is right. He is indeed your direct superior,” Yan Haoran said indifferently in order to stabilize Qin Yu.

Although Jing Shihong was unhappy, he still braced himself and endured it.

“How much longer do you need?” Yan Haoran asked.

Qin Yu raised his head and said, “Give me three more days.”

According to his speculation, Qin Yu could break through to the Enlightenment Stage, which was the realm of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, in three days at most.

Yan Haoran said in a low voice, “Then is there any treasure inside?”

“Yes, of course there is!” Qin Yu said.

“There is a great killing weapon hidden inside! It’s definitely beyond your imagination!”

Great killing weapon?

Yan Haoran’s eyes lit up.

Currently, the Yan family was at the stage of expansion. To them, a great killing weapon was a must-have item!

“Alright, I’ll wait for you!” Yan Haoran agreed with satisfaction.

The huge pit fell into silence.

And above this huge pit, everyone was dying to ask questions.

“Young Master Yan, I have a question.” Finally, someone couldn’t hold it in anymore.

Yan Haoran glanced at him and said, “What question?”

“We are all working for the Yan family, and we are the first batch. Once the Yan family really unifies the martial arts world in the north, who will be the boss? Who will be the president of the Martial Arts Association?”

This was what was on everyone’s mind.

“Yes, the north is vast and rich, and there are many talented people. If a Martial Marquis appears in the future, then will his status be above us or below us?” Someone asked a question even more pressing.

Yan Haoran frowned slightly.

He really hadn’t considered this question carefully.

Although Yan Haoran had grown up in the Yan family, he was only a young man in his twenties after all, and he wasn’t as experienced as Yan Sihai.

He was also inexperienced in managing people.

Therefore, Yan Haoran was stumped by this question.

“When the time comes... you would all be on equal footing,” said Yan Haoran.

“On equal footing? Young Master Yan, where there are people, there will be competition. Even biological brothers will fight for status, let alone outsiders?” Someone said with a nonchalant smile.

He was obviously mocking the current situation of the Yan family.

Yan Haoran wasn’t stupid. He naturally discerned the hidden meaning of the words.

“Are you mocking the Yan family?” Yan Haoran said with narrowed eyes.

The other party’s expression changed slightly and quickly changed his words, “Young Master Yan, I absolutely have no such intention!”

Yan Haoran said coldly, “Don’t think that just because the Yan family needs you, you can do whatever you want. To the Yan family, you are nothing!”

As soon as he said this, the crowd immediately became much quieter.

“Young Master Yan is right.” They nodded one after another.

But deep down, they were a little unhappy.

No matter what, they were all formidable individuals who were in charge of a region. How could they be willing to be treated like this?

And this was also Qin Yu’s goal.

The crowd became quiet and no one brought up this topic anymore.

Below, Qin Yu was still in closed-door cultivation.

The dark energy in his body was already in a saturated state, and he was only a hair’s breadth away from breaking through.

It was this hair’s breadth that prevented Qin Yu from breaking through.

Time passed minute by minute.

In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.

This time, Yan Haoran couldn’t hold it in any longer.

He laid at the mouth of the huge pit and shouted to the people below, “How are you guys doing?”

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes.

He took a deep breath and felt the critical point of his breakthrough.

Then, Qin Yu shouted to the sky, “Young Master Yan, the treasure is about to be born. Get ready.”

Yan Haoran was delighted and hurriedly said, “Okay!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He sat on the ground and began to make a breakthrough.

In an instant, the sky was filled with dark clouds, lightning and thunder!

The dark light shone straight at the huge pit!
