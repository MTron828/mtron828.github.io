Chapter 2416 - 2416: The Cat Curse

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood and laughed manically.

The helpless feeling while the person closest to him was tortured in front of him almost drove him crazy.

“As you wish! Qin Yu, in the name of the ancestor of sorcery, I sentence you, your descendants, and everyone around you to be guilty. The sinners will bear the curse of the sorcerer tribe and their souls will be condemned, unable to reincarnate.”

Ji Tianming’s voice was as cold as ice.

A Supreme Elder of the Tribulation Third Level and an elder of the Tribulation Second Level.

The time and resources for a Supreme Elder to grow to this cultivation realm were unknown.

Even a great aristocratic family would feel heartache for this kind of loss.

Ji Tianming stepped forward, and the entire sky instantly changed color.

In an instant, everyone seemed to have heard the sound of the sea of the Path of Heaven surging. It was the crisp sound of the collision of the ways.

Countless strange phenomena surged in the sky, and an illusory throne slowly took shape in the air.

With the appearance of the throne, the forest-green sky was surging with the utmost curse power. This power was like maggots in one’s bones, and not even a bit could be removed. It would even spread to one’s descendants and the people around them. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The power of curse! The Cat Curse.

Ji Tianming’s head directly flew up and turned into a colossal cat head when it arrived beside Qin Yu.

The colossal black cat’s enormous eyes stared at him. Qin Yu felt the cat demon that Ji Tianming had transformed into could see through everything on his body.

The blood in his body seemed to have been triggered by something. It flowed into the air in a crooked manner and then flowed down like a small snake.

In the sky, a scene that terrified Qin Yu appeared.

His blood, like a paintbrush, projected his birth chart in the air.

The black cat demon stared intensely at Qin Yu’s birth chart.

“Meow!”

Suddenly, the cat’s head let out a shrill scream as a nail pierced straight through its head.

The black cat’s pupils stared intensely at Qin Yu’s birth chart, and it let out a chilling cry.

An obscure power was projected from the sea of curses to the cat’s head and entered Qin Yu’s body through the cat’s pupils. Qin Yu’s skin began to rot.

Numerous pustules grew on his body and festered after they swelled up. The stinky and poisonous water spread to the skin around them.

Qin Yu felt the skin on his body falling off bit by bit. The intensity of the Glazed Holy Body was as fragile as tofu under the curse’s effect.

His body seemed to have been sliced apart by sharp claws, and flesh dropped off piece by piece, but a thread connected them. It was as if he had been cut into pieces.

The stinky blood dripped onto the ground and turned into countless dark green internal qi.

The internal qi revolved around Qin Yu to remember the scent on his body. After that, it burrowed into the void.

Every tiny internal qi was an invisible parasite. These parasites were the most formidable life force of the sorcerer tribe and were nurtured by the most spiritual power of the sorcerer tribe in the sorcerer tribe’s sea of the Path of Heaven.

These parasites would always look for people related to Qin Yu. This was what Ji Wudi meant by declaring him guilty.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and the Evil Eye suddenly appeared in his hand.

In an instant, the power of the curse that surged into Qin Yu’s body was absorbed by the Evil Eye.

This utmost poisonous power seemed to be a great energy supplement for the Evil Eye.

The Heart of Thunder in Qin Yu’s head released its ultimate power to resist the invasion of the Evil Eye’s power.

This power was even more poisonous and evil than the power of curses.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt a frantic killing intent surge up in him. He wanted to kill everyone.

Even the Heart of Thunder, the nemesis of the utmost evil thing, could not withstand the power of the ghostly sword.

“Slash!”

Qin Yu unleashed all his strength and struck Ji Tianming with a powerful strike.

In an instant, the ghostly qi directly devoured the colossal cat demon, and the sword energy slashed Ji Tianming’s body.

“D*mn! You know how to use this sword!”

Ji Tianming’s expression changed drastically, and his body instantly turned into countless parasites that split apart.

The sword energy suddenly exploded, and in an instant, a terrifying ghostly qi exploded, and the power of hell erupted.

The terrifying aura of the Ghost Mansion surged in the air, almost enveloping the entire Ji family.

The power of the Evil Eye was so terrifying!

Flying Descent Technique!

Ji Tianming roared, and another wave of energy surged out from the throne in the sorcerer tribe’s Path of Heaven, clashing with the erupting power of hell. The others also attacked at the same time, finally neutralizing the eruption of the Evil Eye’s sword energy.

In an instant, nearly seven or eight people from the Ji family were killed or injured. There were even three people at the Peak of True Saint laughing frantically.

They attacked the others crazily and were controlled by the Evil Eye.

“You! Even if you die for 10,000 deaths, it can’t dispel my hatred!”

Ji Tianming’s hair scattered as he stared at the corpses of his people.

These were all blood-related relatives. He did not expect Qin Yu to be able to use the Evil Eye.

“Bastard, can you use it a second time? Just wait to be controlled by the Evil Eye and become a brainless puppet!”

Ji Ao roared viciously.

“Slut, go to hell!”

Ji Ao rushed to Ji Yuhong’s side and kicked her leg to pieces.

He tortured Ji Yuhong crazily in front of Qin Yu.

Repeatedly, Qin Yu had defeated him. This was something he could not accept.

Qin Yu knelt on the ground. The Heart of Thunder had become tremendously dim under the impact of the Evil Eye’s power.

The Evil Eye’s power of Ultimate Yin and Evil fused with Qin Yu’s consciousness in a frenzy, turning this killing intent into his instinct, wanting to turn Qin Yu into its puppet.

Qin Yu wanted to stand up and stop Ji Ao, but he realized he could not do it at all.

With his severely injured body and nearly depleted spiritual energy, he could not even stand up.

“Hahaha, in that case, condemn me to hell.”

Qin Yu laughed maniacally. He let the Heart of Thunder sink into the depths of the Sea of Soul.

He allowed the Evil Eye’s power to conquer his soul. In an instant, his eyes turned pitch-black.

Qin Yu’s soul had completely lost consciousness.

Amidst the boundless cold killing intent, Qin Yu suddenly raised the ghostly sword and slashed out.

“He has become a puppet! Just wait for the ghostly sword to finish absorbing his strength. Let’s hide further away first.”

Ji Tianming roared.

He shook both hands, and countless cultivators under his control were shaken out of the space, attracting Qin Yu’s attention.

Although the puppet was not afraid of the corrosive power of the ghostly sword, it did not have its own thoughts.

Now, he just needed some time. He just needed to wait for Qin Yu’s body’s strength to be fully absorbed.

“Who told you I’ve become a puppet? Hahaha!”

Evil Eye’s body began to glow with a tremendously deep ghostly light.

“The Way of Yin and Yang!”

A white and a black light were instantly released from the Evil Eye’s body and swept toward the other Supreme Elder.

A tremendously malicious spirit from the netherworld suddenly pounced on him and crazily devoured his soul..
