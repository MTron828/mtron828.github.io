1985 The History of the Royal Family

The prince only smiled at this question and did not answer specifically.

“In short, Dean Lei is one of the most powerful people on this continent thus far,” he said while looking at Qin Yu.

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel shocked.

He did not expect Dean Lei to be so powerful. No wonder Thunder Courtyard was so glorious.

Following that, the prince also told Qin Yu that although Dean Lei did not accept any disciples, hundreds of people would be ready to go into action in response to a single call by him. There were countless people on this continent that had studied in Thunder Courtyard. Thus no one was willing to provoke Dean Lei.

“Of course, the most important reason is Dean Lei is strong enough, and… ” The Prince suddenly paused as if he had thought of something.

“Do you know Flower Granny?” The prince looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu quickly nodded and soon recalled the somewhat strange old lady.

“I’ve seen her before.” Qin Yu said.

The prince said, smiling, “Flower Granny’s strength is the real mystery. Some people say back then, she was able to pass the tribulation and even reach the Immortal Emperor realm.”

Qin Yu had heard a lot of rumors about Flower Granny when he was in Thunder Courtyard. Thus he was not that really surprised.

While talking, the two arrived at the library.

The royal family’s library was tremendously big, and the books it contained were uncountable.

“Are these the history of the royal family?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

“Yes,” the prince nodded and said. “The royal family has people who specially compiled this book, so the records are more detailed.”

Qin Yu was silent. It was obvious that the royal family was very proud of their history.

“You can go in first. I won’t accompany you,” the prince said with a smile.

“Alright. Thank you, Your Highness,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

After that, without delay, Qin Yu immediately stepped into the library.

Just as Qin Yu and the prince were heading to the library, someone quietly came to Jue Wu’s side.

This person was tall and had a cold expression.

But when he walked to Jue Wu’s side, a flattering look inconsistent with his image appeared on his face.

“Jue Wu?” the burly man asked tentatively.

Jue Wu, who was studying the demonic egg, didn’t even raise her head and said, “What?”

“Dean Lei sent me here,” the man said with a smile. “He wants you to return to Thunder Courtyard immediately.

Jue Wu raised her head and glanced at this burly man. Then she laughed. “Why would I go back to Thunder Courtyard? If I go, who will protect Qin Yu? I’m not going!”

The burly man was startled. He obviously didn’t expect Jue Wu to respond like this.

The burly man frowned and put on a stern expression. “This is an order! It’s Dean Lei’s order!”

“D*mn it!” Jue Wu was extremely unhappy. She got up and said, “Order? What bullsh*t order? Go back and tell Old Man Lei I’m not going back. Do whatever you want!”

The burly man was completely dumbfounded.

Old man Lei? She actually addressed Dean Lei as Old Man Lei? How could she be so disrespectful to the famous Dean Lei?

“What are you still standing there? You’re blocking my view. Get lost!” Jue Wu said impatiently.

The burly man had no choice but to leave the palace dejectedly.

Away from Sky City, the burly man told Gu Xinghe and Yang Tong everything.

“It didn’t work at all. This Jue Wu didn’t take Dean Lei seriously at all. She even called him Old Man Lei…” the burly man said with a bitter smile.

Gu Xinghe and Yang Tong’s expressions turned somewhat ugly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“It seems that Jue Wu and Dean Lei have an extraordinary relationship…” Yang Tong said in a low voice.

“If that’s the case, there’s more reason to send Jue Wu away. Otherwise, something will definitely happen,” Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Yang Tong looked at Gu Xinghe and said, “Do you have any other way?”

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Since she thinks so highly of Qin Yu, then let’s use Qin Yu’s name to make her leave.”

“Qin Yu has entered the royal family’s library,” the burly man said. “I don’t think he’ll leave anytime soon. This is a good opportunity.”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe laughed heartily and said, “Heavens are indeed helping me! I’m going to arrange for people to send Jue Wu away now!”

…

In the library, Qin Yu was flipping the books one by one.

Although this was the royal family’s library, the layout of this place was incredibly unreasonable. It could even be said to be backward.

He could only read the books one by one. It was almost unrealistic to read all the books in the library.

“Where the f*ck do I begin?” Qin Yu felt a slight headache.

Fortunately, Qin Yu found some books about ancient times after a careful search.

On an enormous shelf, there were hundreds of books. These books recorded the history of the royal family in ancient times.

“I can only read them one by one,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He picked up a book from the shelf and began to read it fast.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s divine sense and mental strength were quite strong, and his speed of reading books was also unparalleled.

In just half a day, Qin Yu had read nearly 100 books.

At this rate, it would take him at most three to five days to finish reading all of the ancient books.

...

“D*mn! There are 100 or so books, and they all recorded the development history of the royal family.” Qin Yu was getting even angrier.

The royal family took up many pages describing the glory of the royal family and bragging about their achievements. There were almost no practical records.

“This royal family is really arrogant,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

However, Qin Yu could indeed feel the glory of the royal family back then from the book.

According to the records, the ancestors of the royal family had once led a tremendously powerful army and ruled the entire Holy Region in one fell swoop. All the sects, big and small, had submitted to the royal family.

They even set up ranks and official positions for the major sects to limit their development, controlling the vitality gates of all the sects tightly.

Qin Yu continued his reading. At this time, he saw a book called “The Royal Crisis”.

“The Royal Crisis?” Qin Yu immediately took the book without thinking.

The moment he opened it, a few large words entered Qin Yu’s eyes.

And these few words were none other than Immortal Slaying Sect!

“I finally found a useful book,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

...

He took the book, released his divine sense, and read it carefully.

This book was not very thick, and there were not many records about Immortal Slaying Sect. After Qin Yu finished reading the book, he immediately felt suspicious.

According to the records in this book, Immortal Slaying Sect was founded by a young genius. This young man stepped into the Tribulation transcending Stage in one fell swoop and became the most powerful person in history at that time.

This person was called Ye Chuan. Subsequently, he was called the Demon Emperor.

He was called the Demon Emperor as named by the royal family. They claimed Ye Chuan was the inheritor of the evil path and was the evilest man. The book also recorded all of Ye Chuan’s evil deeds.
