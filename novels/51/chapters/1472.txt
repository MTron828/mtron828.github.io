Chapter 1473: Chapter 1,473, Saint Alchemist Capital 1

First Elder, who had almost given up, heard Mo Hong’s words and did not have any more thoughts.

He looked at Mo Hong coldly and stood up after a while.

“Qin Yu Must Die!”First Elder said coldly.

Mo hong nodded and said, “This kid is too arrogant. We must get rid of him quickly! First Elder, please send out the eighteen gods to kill Qin Yu!”

First Elder glanced at Mo Hong and said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu is currently at Mount Hua Ning. I Can’t go.”

Mo Hong’s expression changed slightly. He was silent for a moment before saying, “We might as well get rid of Jue Wu as well!”

“If it was that simple, we would have made our move long ago,”first elder said coldly.

Not to mention Jue Wu’s terrifying strength, coupled with her many good friends, even the Heavenly Cloud sect did not dare to act rashly.

If they really went all out to get rid of Jue Wu, the Tianyun sect would suffer a great loss.

“When Qin Yu leaves Mount Hua Ning, the eighteen gods will immediately kill him,”first elder said coldly.

Then, First Elder looked at Mo Hong and said, “I’ll leave this matter to you.”

“Don’t worry. I’ll immediately send people to keep an eye on the vicinity of Mount Hua Ning,”Mo Hong hurriedly nodded.

First Elder, however, shook his head and said, “I want you to go personally.”

Mo Hong was startled. Then, he clenched his teeth and said, “Alright, I’ll set off for Mount Hua Ning now!”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu had already planned to leave Mount Hua Ning.

These past few days, he had searched through countless medicinal pills in his mind and finally decided on a medicinal pill called the nascent soul pill.

This kind of medicinal pill had a magical effect on the nascent soul realm, especially for cultivators who were about to break through.

Normally, three nascent soul pills were enough, but based on Qin Yu’s experience, he probably needed a medicinal pill that was several times more powerful than an ordinary person’s.

Therefore, Qin Yu planned to temporarily prepare thirty nascent soul pills, then return to Mount Hua Ning to cultivate in seclusion and step into the mighty realm in one go.

“I can only exert 70% of my strength right now. I’ll probably need several pills just to recover to my peak condition,”Qin Yu said as he counted with his fingers.

Qin Yu sighed slightly and decided to increase the number of pills to 40.

40 nascent soul pills should be enough.

The herbs required for nascent soul pills were not considered harsh. Most of them were herbs that were around 10,000 years old. They were not rare in the holy region.

Qin Yu, who had originally planned to replace the guild, also gave up on the idea.

Hence, Qin Yu found absolute dance and asked, “I want to purchase a batch of herbs that are at least ten thousand years old. Do you have any good recommendations?”

Absolute dance waved her hand and said, “I don’t know. You can ask Qu Zhu.”

Qu Zhu smiled and said, “Absolute dance’s cultivation is different from ours. She doesn’t need overly harsh herbs and environment.”

Qin Yu was stunned and asked in confusion, “What do you mean?”

Qu Zhu smiled and said, “The unique dance’s constitution is a little strange. Her cultivation depends on her mood.”

Qin Yu was even more confused. Depends on her mood? What did this mean?

Could it be that she could break through when she was in a good mood?

Qu Zhu explained, “The unique dance’s constitution is very strange. Every once in a while, she will feel signs of a breakthrough. And she doesn’t need to cultivate at all. She just needs to eat, drink, and have fun.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp when he heard this.

What kind of cultivation method was this? wasn’t it a little too abnormal?

“So, as long as she’s in a good mood, it’s considered cultivation. Look at her eating, drinking, and having fun every day. In fact, that’s also a type of cultivation,”qu Zhu continued.

Qin Yu said with a face full of shock, “Isn’t this F * cking too abnormal?”

“Haha, this can also be considered as one of her dao techniques.”Qu Zhu laughed.

With Qu Zhu’s explanation, Qin Yu somewhat understood.

Everyone chose different dao techniques. Some relied on seclusion to cultivate the righteous dao, while others relied on killing to attain Dao. However, a dao technique like the absolute dance was indeed too comfortable.

“Oh right, what did you want to ask just now?”Qu Zhu asked.

Qin Yu said, “Senior Qu Zhu, I want to buy a batch of herbs. Where should I go?”

Qu Zhu didn’t even think before saying, “Of course it’s the Medicine Sage Capital. Almost all of the best herbs in the southern region are in the Medicine Sage Capital.”

“Medicine Sage Capital? What kind of place is that?”Qin Yu asked doubtfully.

Qu Zhu explained, “The predecessor of the Medicine Sage Capital was the pill refining assembly. It was a place where a group of alchemists gathered. Because of their existence, many herbs flowed to this place. After many years of development, it finally became the Medicine Sage Capital.”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization and couldn’t help but mutter, “In that case, it’s convenient for me to go to the Medicine Sage Capital.”

After all, Qin Yu was also an alchemist, and an alchemist with a purple flame.

Previously, Qin Yu had asked around and found that most of the powerful alchemists had gone to the central plains. Those who stayed were mostly nameless people.

Therefore, the alchemists of the medicine sage capital probably didn’t have much ability.

“Thank you, senior Qu Zhu.”Qin Yu cupped his hands toward Qu Zhu. “Senior Qu Zhu, where is the Medicine Sage City?”

Qu Zhu extended his finger, and rays of light appeared in front of him.

These rays of light interweaved in the air, and after a while, they actually turned into a map of the Southern Region!

This move really shocked Qin Yu!

Just how terrifying was his strength to be able to use spiritual Qi to weave a map?

“It’s here.”Qu Zhu’s finger pointed at a certain location on the spiritual Qi map.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent and quickly memorized this location.

“Thank you, senior Qu Zhu.”Qin Yu cupped his hands toward Qu Zhu once more and then planned to leave this place.

He bid farewell to Qu Zhu, Jue Wu, and the two Wen brothers before leaving this place and rushing toward the Medicine Sage City.

Not long after Qin Yu left, Mo Hong arrived here.

He didn’t dare to approach the Hua Ning Mountain, so he could only hide in the distance and observe in secret.

In order to prevent accidents, Mo Hong tried to probe out a wisp of divine sense, trying to find out the truth in case Qin Yu wasn’t here.

But when his divine sense approached the Hua Ning mountain, it was directly cut off.

Mo Hong’s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly withdrew his divine sense and changed his position, afraid that he would expose his position.

...

Qin Yu sat on the Divine Eagle and silently memorized the location of the Medicine Sage City.

The closer he was to the Medicine Sage City, the more Qin Yu could smell the medicinal fragrance. The surrounding spiritual Qi also began to gradually become denser. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After a long time, Qin Yu arrived near the medicine sage city.

The city gate of the medicine sage city was filled with people. Some people came to look for medicine, while others encountered a bottleneck and went to the medicine sage city to ask someone to refine a pill.

As for those who came to see the doctor, there were very few. After all, this was the holy region, and for cultivators, they had long since recovered from their illnesses.

Looking from the sky, there was a palace that pierced through the clouds in the middle of the Medicine Sage City. This was the place where alchemists lived.

Qin Yu put away the Divine Hawk and then Strode toward the Medicine Sage City.
