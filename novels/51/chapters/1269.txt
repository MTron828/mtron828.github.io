Chapter 1270: Chapter 1,270. It wasn’t me, it was Qin Yu 

“Who am I?”

This question stumped Qin Yu.

He thought for a moment and said, “I am who I am, a different spark.”

“What?”

“Nothing. Bring this spirit monarch lion with you. Let’s go back and collect the reward.”

“...”

Qin Yu walked up to the Spirit Monarch Lion and examined it, wanting to see if there was any life energy.

But unfortunately, there was no life force flowing in the Spirit Monarch Lion’s body.

“Looks like it’s not that easy to obtain life force,”Qin Yu sighed.

He put the spirit monarch lion into the spatial magic artifact and then walked back with Guan Zhuang.

“Qin Yu, if they knew that you killed the spirit monarch lion, they would definitely look at you in a different light!”Guan Zhuang gave Qin Yu a thumbs up.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t care about their opinions. I just want money and a place to stay.”

“A place to stay? Did you cause trouble outside?”Guan Zhuang said.

“How did you know?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Many of those who came here caused trouble. I had no choice but to come here to seek refuge after killing one of our local tycoons.”

Qin Yu suddenly realized that he was not the only one seeking refuge.

“I have also offended a sect. That sect is very powerful,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Don’t worry. As long as you come to the hunter organization, you don’t have to worry.”Guan Zhuang patted Qin Yu’s back.

The two of them chatted and laughed as they rushed toward the hunter organization.

At this moment, in the hunter organization.

Jing Bai’s left eye kept jumping.

This gave him a bad premonition.

“Jing Bai, what are you thinking about again?”Someone beside him asked.

Jing bai frowned and said, “My left eye keeps jumping. I’m thinking that Guan Zhuang might have been killed by that kid.”

“Killed? What nonsense are you talking about? Guan Zhuang has rich combat experience. Even if he can’t save that kid, it’s not a problem for him to protect himself.”

“That’s right. Besides, the left eye twitching is a good thing. Relax.”

Even though that was the case, Jing Bai was getting more and more worried.

The Spirit Monarch Lion had killed too many hunters. He did not want to see anyone else die in vain.

He looked at the remaining orders in his hands and became more and more determined.

“If anything happens to Guan Zhuang, I will destroy these few orders no matter what!”Jing Bai said through gritted teeth.

At this moment, a young man walked over from the side.

He said with a faint smile, “Tear it. Why Don’t You Tear It? Don’t you dare?”

This young man was Jing Bai’s sworn enemy. His name was Zhong Wu. The two of them had been at loggerheads for many years.

If Jing Bai tore up these orders, then his current position would have to be vacated. At that time, it would fall into Zhong Wu’s hands.

Therefore, zhong wu kept provoking him, “If you don’t dare, then so be it. What are you pretending for? Who are you trying to scare?”

Jing Bai looked at Zhong wu coldly and said, “How do you know that I don’t Dare?”

“Hahaha, then tear it up? I think you don’t want to give up this position, right?”Zhong Wu said with a strange tone.

“Yeah, we go out and risk our lives. We risk our lives every day. How can we live as well as you? We can just sit here every day.”

Jing Bai suddenly stood up. He looked at Zhong wu coldly and said, “Even if I leave this position, it won’t be your turn. A person like you doesn’t deserve to sit in this position.”

“I don’t deserve it? I think you don’t deserve it!”Zhong wu snorted.

“Come, tear it up if you have the ability. If you don’t have the ability, shut your mouth!”Zhong Wu looked at Jing Bai coldly.

Jing Bai grabbed the orders and said coldly, “Do you really think I don’t dare to?”

Zhong wu said sarcastically, “Then tear it up. Don’t play with your mouth.”

Jing Bai gritted his teeth and said, “Tear it up then!”

Zhong Wu was instantly overjoyed!

As long as he tore up the orders, this position would definitely be his!

“Tear it up, quickly tear it up!”Zhong Wu roared crazily in his heart.

Just as Jing Bai was about to tear up these few orders, Qin Yu and Guan Zhuang slowly walked over from the depths of the green rock forest.

“Jing Bai, they’re back!”Someone shouted.

Hearing this, Jing Bai suddenly stood up and ran anxiously towards Guan Zhuang.

He kept sizing up guan zhuang and frowned, “Are you injured?”

“Yes, it’s not a big problem,”Guan Zhuang said with a smile.

Jing Bai looked at Qin Yu again and said, “How are you fine?”

“Uh... I don’t know either. I’m fine anyway,”Qin Yu said helplessly.

Jing Bai heaved a sigh of relief and said, “It doesn’t matter whether you can kill the spirit monarch Lion or not. As long as you come back alive, it’s fine.”

After saying that, Jing Bai glanced at Qin Yu and said, “After experiencing this matter, you should know to restrain yourself. I’ll pick out some relatively simple orders for you.”

Qin Yu and Guan Zhuang looked at each other, not knowing what to say for a moment.

“That... Jing Bai, the Spirit Monarch Lion has already been killed,”Guan Zhuang said with a bitter smile.

“En, so be it. As long as... Wait, what did you say?”Jing Bai suddenly reacted and hurriedly looked at Guan Zhuang.

“You killed the Spirit Monarch Lion? !”

Guan Zhuang shook his head and said, “Not me, it’s Qin Yu...”
