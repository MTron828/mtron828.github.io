Chapter 954: Chapter 954, the masked woman was still alive! 

Qin Yu thought about it, but he still felt that he couldn’t let his spiritual sense enter his body.

With his ability, if he wanted to forcefully occupy her, Qin Yu probably wouldn’t be able to do anything.

“Damn it, I’d better forget it. It’s a waste of time,”Qin Yu muttered.

In the next few days.

The equipment on Qin Yu’s body was inexplicably removed.

This made Qin Yu somewhat puzzled.

Could it be that... The blood in his body couldn’t have any effect?

At this moment, Gu Xinghe walked over from outside.

He glanced at Qin Yu and sneered, “Qin Yu, cherish these few days that you’re alive.”

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

He didn’t say anything, but he had already guessed the general situation in his heart.

“It seems that my blood has no effect at all,”Qin Yu said tentatively.

When this topic was brought up, Gu Xinghe’s expression became a little ugly.

Qin Yu caught the change in his expression and guessed, “Could it be that my blood only has effect on Yan Jinyao?”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe’s expression suddenly became a little ferocious!

“Looks like I guessed right.”Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

“Shut up! If you want to die early, I can grant your wish!”Gu Xinghe grabbed the railing and shouted angrily.

Qin Yu sneered, “I don’t have many days left anyway, what’s there to be afraid of?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth, took a deep breath, pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Let’s see how many more days you can be arrogant!”

After saying that, Gu Xinghe turned around and walked out.

After he left, the prisoners all said, “Qin Yu, why do you have to be so calculative with him? After all, we are in his hands now. If we talk properly, we might be able to live for a few more days.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I’m different from all of you. No matter what I say, he won’t let me off.”

Everyone was speechless.

A moment later, someone comforted, “Qin Yu, don’t think too much. Who knows what might happen in a few days.”

“That’s right. When we get out, we’ll work with you!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Alright! Then we’ll meet outside!”

No one expected that Gu Xinghe had no intention of letting anyone off.

...

In the next few days, Qin Yu, who had removed his equipment, recovered a little.

The internal Qi here was extremely weak. It was a very slow process to recover.

Even though Qin Yu had many treasures on him, once he took them out, 90% of them would be discovered.

“Damn it, I don’t care,”Qin Yu cursed.

“If I can recover in these few days, I might be able to escape.”

Thus, when night fell, Qin Yu carefully took out the spirit stone.

The moment he took out the spirit stone, the room flashed with light.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly stuffed the spirit stone into his mouth.

Fortunately, this action did not attract too much attention, and Qin Yu could be considered to be slightly relieved.

He spent almost an entire night to consume this spirit stone.

However, Qin Yu’s body was too severely injured. The equipment had caused great damage to Qin Yu’s body.

Even if he borrowed spirit stones, the recovery speed was extremely slow.

“At this rate, it will probably take dozens of days to recover to its peak.”Qin Yu sighed slightly in his heart.

He raised his head to look at the device in front of him, and his heart was once again filled with anger.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down.

In the prison, many prisoners talked about their daily lives.

From south to north, from history to the future.

They seemed to have gotten used to this kind of life. Although it was boring, it could be considered dull.

From time to time, Qin Yu would join them and chat with them. Their days were pretty good.

On this day.

The prisoners chatted and chatted as usual. At this moment, the door opened.

For some reason, Qin Yu suddenly had a bad premonition.

Looking over, he saw Gu Xinghe walking in with big strides.

And there was another person beside him.

That person was none other than Tian Xuehong!

“Tian Xuehong? !”Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Why did he come here?

Qin Yu had heard of the various actions of Tian Xuehong.

It was said that this person had devoured the inner strength and spiritual sense of countless warriors, causing the entire martial arts world to be filled with grief!

Could it be... He had set his mind on the numerous prisoners?

“You guys can leave first.”Gu Xinghe waved his hand and sent everyone out.

Tian Xuehong swept his gaze around, as if he was calculating the prisoners in this prison.

Very soon, Tian Xuehong’s gaze landed on Qin Yu.

“HMM? Who Is this person?”Tian xuehong sized up Qin Yu and asked.

Gu Xinghe said, “He is Qin Yu.”

“Oh?”Tian Xuehong’s interest was immediately piqued.

He took two steps forward and walked in front of Qin Yu. He said with a faint smile, “You are Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and didn’t say anything.

Tian xuehong said indifferently, “Speaking of which, I really have to thank you. If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid I would never be able to leave the slaughtering immortal sect...”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer, “Then you owe me a favor. When do you plan to repay it?”

“A favor?”Tian Xuehong raised his eyebrows and then said with a faint smile, “Well, if you’re willing to work for me, I can consider it.”

“Tian Xuehong, this Qin Yu is extremely cunning. Don’t be deceived by him,”Gu Xinghe reminded him immediately.

Sky Blood Rainbow ignored him and looked at Qin Yu as if he was waiting for Qin Yu’s answer.

Qin Yu didn’t answer his question. Instead, he said, “Sky Blood Rainbow, aren’t you afraid of being suppressed again? It’s better to be careful.”

“Suppressed again? hahahaha!”When Sky Blood Rainbow heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Who else in the world can suppress me? When I rebuild the Immortal Massacre Sect, it will still be the number one sect in the world.”

Tian Xuehong’s tone was full of confidence and superiority.

“Is that so?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“Tian Xuehong, I have bad news for you.”

Tian Xuehong raised his eyebrows and signaled Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu moved his face to the side of the railing and said carefully, “The masked woman is still alive.”
