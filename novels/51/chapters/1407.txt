Chapter 1408: Chapter 1,408, battle the first elder again

Sixth Brother’s expression immediately changed. He looked at these people in horror and forced himself to remain calm. “You... Don’t act recklessly! If you kill me, the first elder will not let you off!”

The linen-robed old man sneered. “After I kill you, we unspecialized people will immediately escape! With the abilities of the three of us, we will be able to survive no matter where we go!”

“As for you, go to Hell!”

Along with the linen-robed old man’s shout, his eagle-like hand suddenly reached out and grabbed sixth brother’s head!

With a crack, sixth brother’s head was instantly crushed!

After killing sixth brother, the three of them didn’t dare to stay and quickly rushed to the heavenly cloud sect.

After arriving at the Heavenly Cloud sect, the three of them relied on the first elder’s token and directly went to the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s treasury, taking away a large number of spirit coins and treasures.

The first Elder’s treasury was even emptied.

After doing all this, the three of them once again borrowed the first elder’s token and left the South Province on the spatial array formation.

“Aren’t we being a little too greedy by doing this...”

“Greedy? HMPH, he deserves it. Not only is he worried about us, he’s even afraid that we’ll take away his credit. HMPH.”

...

At this moment, the first elder knew nothing about this. He was still waiting for the linen-robed elder and the others to return.

In the blink of an eye, an entire week had passed.

During this one week, Qin Yu’s injuries had almost fully recovered.

His entire body was flickering with a dark golden color, glistening under the sunlight.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s physical body and strength had both received a qualitative improvement.

Although there were still a few parts of his body that had not recovered, the effects were minimal and not worth mentioning.

“Just a little bit more,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“After this matter is done, I have to go to Yang City again to find the last bit of life force.”

Outside the divine capital city.

The first elder frowned, and his face showed that he had lost his patience.

“First Elder, it has been a full seven days. Even if they leave, they should be back by now,”someone beside him said in puzzlement.

The Grand Elder remained silent. It was obvious that he had realized something.

“Let’s Wait a little longer. Let’s wait for the last day,”the Grand Elder said coldly.

In the blink of an eye, another day had passed. The hemp-robed old man still had not returned.

This caused the grand elder’s expression to turn extremely ugly.

He was the one who led this battle. The two consecutive mistakes in his decision-making had already caused him to lose face.

“Looks like he escaped,”someone beside him said in a deep voice.

The great elder berated, “Impossible, something must have gone wrong!”The great elder shouted angrily. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The people beside him didn’t dare to say anything. Even if they had guessed something, they didn’t dare to say it out loud.

“Damn it!”

The Great Elder’s anger had long reached its peak.

However, he couldn’t vent his anger on the hemp-robed elder. Therefore, he could only vent his anger on Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu! You cowardly tortoise, come out if you have the guts. Otherwise, I will definitely execute Di Zun and the others!”

The first Elder’s furious roar shook the entire divine capital, and even activated the divine inscription array.

The golden radiance appeared once again, enveloping the entire divine capital tightly.

Qin Yu, who was recuperating in the divine capital, couldn’t help but open his eyes when he heard this furious roar.

“En? What’s wrong with this old thing? Why is he suddenly throwing a tantrum?”Qin Yu could not help but feel puzzled.

He stood up from the ground and shook his arm, muttering, “It’s time to go out and meet this old fellow.”

Therefore, Qin Yumou exerted all his strength and shouted at the great elder, “Old Thing, what kind of Tantrum did you suddenly throw? What happened? Your Wife was abducted?”

The Great Elder, who was already vexed, was fuming with anger when he heard this.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Little Bastard, don’t show off your tongue. If you have the ability, come out!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Okay, I’ll come out and play with you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu strode toward the door.

He was also looking forward to it. He wanted to know how much power this body of his could display.

As he pushed open the gates of the Divine Capital, Qin Yu landed in everyone’s field of vision.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s appearance had changed drastically. His originally ordinary face had slowly returned to his delicate and handsome appearance. The white hair on his head had also returned to its inky black color.

What was even more dazzling was the faint golden radiance on his body. Under the contrast of this radiance, Qin Yu was like a heavenly god that descended from the sky, incomparably dazzling.

“First Elder, I’m out.”Qin Yu stared at the first elder in the air and said coldly.

The first elder frowned slightly. He seemed to have sensed something strange about Qin Yu.

“Could it be that there are other treasures in the divine capital city? Did this child use these few days to cultivate?”The first elder thought to himself.

“That’s not right!”The first elder quickly denied this thought. After all, almost all the treasures in the entire southern province had been swept by the Tianyun sect. Even the divine capital city was no exception.

Just as the first elder was deep in thought, Qin Yu stomped his foot and shot out explosively!

In just a breath’s time, Qin Yu had already landed on the dragon-headed carriage and stood in front of the first elder.
