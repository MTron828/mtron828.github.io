1995 The Strange Jue Wu

Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly. He looked at the prince and said, “In other words, they might take this opportunity to remove all the privileges of the Sky City?”

“That’s right.” The prince did not hide anything.

“Don’t you have the right to object?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Yes, I do, but what’s the use of nine votes against one?” The prince said self-deprecatingly.

!!

Qin Yu scratched his head.

It would be troublesome as once Sky City’s status was revoked, it would mean it was no longer safe to stay here.

“Looks like I have to think of a way to leave this place as soon as possible,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The prince had the same thought and said, “Hurry up and leave before the grand meeting begins. They’re not just targeting the royal family this time, but more on you.”

“There’s no time to lose. I’ll leave now,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu called out to Jue Wu, and the two packed up to leave the place.

However, when they arrived at the city’s perimeter, they realized the entire Sky City had long been sealed off.

Magical artifacts were densely packed outside the city. As soon as one steps into the city, one would encounter a life-threatening crisis.

“Looks like we no longer can get out.” Qin Yu frowned.

The nine great aristocratic families’ actions were much faster than expected. They were probably going to catch something that had no way of escaping.

Qin Yu, standing at the door, could clearly feel several cold gazes in the dark. Perhaps they had already arranged their people here and were waiting for Sky City’s status to be revoked.

Helplessly, Qin Yu and Jue Wu could only retreat to the Imperial Palace for the time being.

In the Imperial Palace, the prince, Qin Yu, and the others all had tremendously gloomy expressions. They couldn’t think of any countermeasures.

“Looks like I can only take it one step at a time.” Qin Yu sighed.

Worst scenario, Qin Yu could only try to change his appearance again and look for an opportunity to escape from this place.

In any case, Jue Wu was Dean Lei’s closed-door disciple. Thus they probably wouldn’t do anything to her.

On the following day, Wen Er, who had been unconscious, finally woke up.

Accompanied by Master Yun, he arrived at the Imperial Palace.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, his tears flowed uncontrollably.

He rushed forward and hugged Qin Yu, and tears and snot flowed down his face. As he was crying so hard, his entire body was almost twitching.

“Wen Da, he…Wen Da, he… Boohoo…” Wen Er cried until he almost fainted.

Although the two of them often quarreled, they were very close to each other. Now that Wen Da was gone, how could he not feel the pain?

Qin Yu hugged Wen Er, feeling even more upset.

“It’s my fault. It’s all my fault.” Qin Yu hugged Wen Er tightly, his heart filled with mixed feelings.

Wen Er wiped his tears and said with grief and indignation, “I don’t blame you. If I want to blame someone, I’ll blame Gu Xinghe! I must tear him into shreds. I must kill him!”

Looking at Wen Er’s fighting spirit, Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

Wen Er was not so talented in cultivation. Even if he tried his best, he couldn’t possibly deal with Gu Xinghe.

“I will definitely take revenge for Wen Da.” Qin Yu patted Wen Er’s shoulder and sighed slightly.

Jue Wu, by their side, also hurriedly comforted him, “Wen Er, don’t be too sad. Although Wen Da is dead, his divine sense is still alive. He might be able to reincarnate in the future.”

However, Wen Er knew very well.

It remained unknown if Wen Da could reincarnate. Moreover, even if he could, that person would no longer be Wen Da.

“Auntie Jue Wu, I…” Wen Er opened his mouth, and tears flowed out again.

To ease the atmosphere, Jue Wu pulled Wen Er and said, “Alright, I’ll treat you to a drink today. Let’s drink until we’re drunk!”

After saying that, she pulled Wen Er to the tavern, not giving him any chance to say anything.

On this day, Wen Er was completely drunk. He was originally a good drinker but soon passed out.

Looking at Wen Er lying on the table with tears in his eyes, Jue Wu did not say a thing. No one knew what she was thinking.

“Let’s bring him back.” Qin Yu didn’t think much about it and thought Jue Wu was just feeling uncomfortable.

After that, Qin Yu carried Wen Er back to the Imperial Palace.

That day, Sky City seemed to be quite peaceful, but in reality, undercurrents were surging.

Numerous wisps of internal qi had already quietly surged into Sky City. They had sneaked into Sky City before the meeting began.

These internal qis were all tremendously powerful, and there were at least nearly a hundred of them.

It was evident the nine great aristocratic families were serious this time. They no longer used any tricks but planned to directly revoke the current special status of Sky City.

“There seem to be many unfamiliar faces in Sky City.” A great cultivator living in seclusion in Sky City couldn’t help but sigh.

“I’m afraid Sky City will no longer be peaceful in the future. It’ll be a luxury to find serenity.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hehe! Under the Golden Age, no one can avoid the impact of storms unless they find a star field to live in seclusion.”

Some people entered Sky City, and some would leave. The entire situation in Sky City had been changing quietly.

Another day went by. The representatives of the nine great aristocratic families arrived at Sky City.

Most of the people they sent were elders. These elders held high positions in the family, thus naturally had tremendously powerful strength.

That night, the various aristocratic families arrived at the Imperial Palace.

For a moment, the sky was full of divine chariots, covering the sky and the sun. Terrifying internal qi lingered in Sky City and caused everyone to feel uneasy.

...

“Finally, it’s coming.” Qin Yu raised his head to look at the mighty carriages, and his expression could not help but turn solemn.

Jue Wu was strangely quiet. She raised her head to look at the carriages and was expressionless.

These people gathered in the Imperial Palace and exchanged pleasantries with the prince.

Qin Yu swept his gaze around and discovered only seven aristocratic families had arrived at Sky City.

“It seems that the people from the Yan family and the Si family haven’t arrived yet.” Qin Yu frowned.

Could it be that these two families would come together?

“I really don’t know what choice the Yan family will make.” Qin Yu felt uneasy.

If the nine great aristocratic families were really united, how would he face Yan Ruoxue in the future?

The Srive of the Great Era was tremendous shocking news for the entire Holy Region. It had been too long since the nine great aristocratic families had met. Their every move could affect the situation of the entire Holy Region.

Therefore, besides their people, many powerful rogue cultivators also took the opportunity to enter Sky City.

There were too many people. No one could tell their identities.

...

Qin Yu and Jue Wu walked on the streets of Sky City and noticed the bustling streets had become even more bustling now.

People who used secret techniques to hide their faces were seen everywhere. Some had hazy faces, some wore veils, and some used huge bamboo hats to cover their faces.

It might be the first time the security in Sky City was lax. However, during this time, people could only enter Sky City but not leave.
