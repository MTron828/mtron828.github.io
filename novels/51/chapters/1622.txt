Chapter 1623: Chapter 1,623, the young age of the Master of the northern lands Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A godly king hurriedly explained, “It’s because the master of the Tianyun sect is too strong. Even if we tried our best, we could only behead an avatar formed from the divine stone...”

“A mere master of the Tianyun sect has made you suffer such a setback. If you are not trash, then what are you? !”Xue Shan was furious, and the entire northern lands immediately buzzed!

The few godly monarchs trembled, and no one dared to make a sound.

After a moment, Xue Shan said coldly, “From tomorrow onwards, you will be the fourth godly monarch of the northern lands. Are You Willing?”

He Teng was startled, and then quickly said, “Of course I am willing. It is an honor to the extreme!”

“Good. The northern lands has always had four godly monarchs. This tradition must not be broken,”Xue Shang said coldly.

He Teng could not help but be secretly delighted. He had never thought that he could actually become the fourth godly monarch.

But while he was excited, a beam of light exploded from the Snowy Mountain!

The beam of light shot straight towards he Teng’s glabella. It was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, it had entered he teng’s glabella.

He Teng’s expression changed slightly. He stroked his forehead, but he did not find any scars.

“Don’t worry.”At this moment, Xue Shan spoke.

“This is just a Mark I planted on you to prevent you from rebelling.”

He Teng’s expression immediately became a little unnatural.

A person like him would never be loyal to anyone. Everything could be used by him.

Now that he had been planted with a mark, how could he be willing.

“Hurry up and thank the Lord!”Sima bei berated from the side.

He Teng retracted his thoughts and bowed, “Thank you, Lord.”

The snow mountain did not speak again. Sima bei hurriedly asked, “What should we do next? Please instruct us, Lord.”

The snow mountain said coldly, “He’s just a heavenly cloud sect’s sect master. How can he be compared to my northern lands! I’ll go and kill him now!”

With that, the scroll in Sima Bei’s hand suddenly flew up and enveloped the sky above the snow mountain!

In a short moment, the scroll emitted countless rays of light. Each ray of light entered the snow mountain!

After the rays of light dissipated, a figure actually slowly walked out from the snow mountain. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This was a youth in the prime of his life. He wore a white robe and was in high spirits. An unexcelled expression was revealed from between his brows. Each and every one of his actions emitted the aura of a dragon and a tiger.

However, even though this young man appeared to be inexperienced, his eyes contained a rare maturity that no one dared to ignore. The aura that he emitted was even more frightening!

“You... You Are the Master?”Sima bei was the first to recover from his shock and asked tentatively.

That young man swept his cold eyes over the few of them and said indifferently, “Strictly speaking, this is just the me when I was young. The Real Me is still in a deep sleep.”

The Master of the northern lands when he was young? ! He was also the Master of the northern lands who had yet to mature? !

“However, even the Me of this period is not something that the heavenly cloud sect’s sect master can compare to,”the youth said with extreme conceit.

At that moment, a godly monarch reminded him softly, “Master, you can not underestimate the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master. One of his avatars killed one of our godly monarchs. If it was his true body...”

“Oh?”The youth looked at the godly monarch fiercely. His powerful aura instantly forced the godly monarch back!

With just a glance, the godly monarch spat out blood non-stop!

“What a powerful internal Qi!”Even he teng could not help but be greatly shocked!

Such strength was simply beyond imagination!

As expected of the Lord of the northern lands. He had such terrifying strength when he was still a youth. How terrifying was he in his complete state? !

It was unimaginable!

The few godly monarchs hurriedly knelt on the ground. They did not even dare to breathe loudly, afraid of provoking this youth.

“I’ll go to the northern lands now and meet this whatever Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master.”The youth’s tone carried a natural arrogance.

“I’ll go with You Now!”A godly monarch hurriedly said.

However, this youth said coldly, “A few pieces of trash. What’s the use of going? Just stay here.”

The Godly King did not dare to say anything and could only endure silently.

After that, the youth’s feet shook and he instantly disappeared without a trace.

Some godly kings tried to search for his internal Qi but realized that it had long disappeared.

“The Lord has really gone to the north...”a godly king said in a low voice.

“What about us? Do We want to Go Together?”Another godly king asked.

“There’s no need.”Sima bei shook his head. “The Lord has already said that we will stay.”

After saying this, Sima Bei stepped on the snow and walked into the distance.

The other godly monarchs did not stay any longer and quickly left.

Under the vast world of ice and snow, he teng stood there alone.

He narrowed his eyes and thought to himself, with such strength, even if I had the white bone staff, it would be difficult for me to defeat him..

Although the white bone staff was a true holy weapon, it was a pity that it had not been resurrected and could not display its true holy might.

Otherwise, he might be able to give it a try.

He Teng’s eyes narrowed slightly. No one knew what he was thinking.

...

On the great Yue Mountain.

Qin Yu rested for a whole three days.

Three days later, he got up from his bed and walked towards the peak of the great Yue mountain without looking back.

Many sect leaders saw that Qin Yu had woken up and followed him up the mountain.

On the peak of the mountain, almost all the famous sect leaders of the South Province had come here.

This was a rare grand occasion! It was not because of Qin Yu’s influence, but because of the internal unity caused by the external conflicts.

“Qin Yu, if you have this time, you might as well go and cultivate. Why waste it again?”Wen Wentong said coldly.

The sect leaders of the various large sects and sects at the side urged him one after another.

In their hearts, they had long hoped that Qin Yu would become the next Xiao Hai.

That was the hero of the Southern Province, the glory of the Southern Province. Of course, no one wanted anything to happen to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu smiled and shook his head. “Don’t worry. This time, I have a new method.”

After saying that, he took out the medicinal cauldron and began to refine a pill.

However, this time, Qin Yu did not refine a beast spirit pill. Instead, he refined another kind of medicinal pill that could restore vitality.

This kind of medicinal pill’s method was extremely simple. The herbs and time required were not much. As long as one had this kind of medicinal pill, they could greatly reduce their rest time.

Qin Yu spent a day refining dozens of medicinal pills.

He caressed these medicinal pills and said in a low voice, “With this, refining the beast spirit pill will be much easier.”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time, because no one knew when the northern lands would attack again.

Before that, Qin Yu had to ensure that the various large sects had the ability to protect themselves.

Only if they could protect themselves would they have the strength to protect the surrounding cultivators.

Time passed by minute by minute, and the Heavenly Cloud Sect wasn’t idle at the moment.

The deputy sect master lay on the bed all day, as if he had suffered a blow.

How could he not feel sad when the person he had always admired refused to show up.
