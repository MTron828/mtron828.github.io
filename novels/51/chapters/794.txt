Chapter 795: Chapter 795, the fish that escaped the net Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the two hundred Yuan placed on the table, Qin Yu could not help but feel like laughing.

He raised his head to look at Yang Jing and asked in puzzlement: “Who is young master Huang?”

Yang Jing bit her lip and said: “Young Master Huang is a very big family clan in the Sheng Kingdom. You guys can not afford to offend him, so you should hurry up and leave. I will treat you to a meal when I return to the fire country another day!”

After a simple investigation, she found out that this young master Huang was from a local family clan and because he had taken a liking to Yang Jing, he had decided to force himself upon her.

Faced with this young master Huang, Yang Jing had no choice but to send all her family members back to the fire country and face the Huang family clan by herself.

Qin Yu was just about to say something when the door opened.

After that, she saw a young man with two people walking in from outside the door.

“TSK, tsk.”The young man’s eyes fell on Qin Yu as soon as he entered the door.

“What? Stealing a man while I’m not here?”The young man sneered.

Yang Jing quickly explained, “Young Master Huang, he’s my friend. He treated my father’s illness...”

Young Master Huang Glanced at Qin Yu and sneered, “Treated your father’s illness? Do you think I’m a F * cking idiot?”

With that, young master Huang slapped Yang Jing’s face!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and immediately stretched out his palm, taking the lead to slap young master Huang’s face.

Although this slap wasn’t very strong, it still sent young master Huang Flying.

“You dare to hit our young master? You’re courting death!”The two bodyguards beside young master Huang immediately shouted and rushed towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t even look at them and directly smashed their heads into pieces.

Seeing this scene, young master Huang’s face instantly turned pale!

“You... you dare to touch my people...”young master Huang’s eyes widened.

Qin Yu looked at young master Huang coldly and said coldly, “Kid, forcefully twisting a melon is not sweet.”

Young Master Huang stood up from the ground and said with a cold face, “So what? I have many women by my side. She’s just one of them! I don’t care if he’s sweet or Not!”

Qin Yu’s face turned cold and said, “Kid, I advise you to give up on this idea.”

Young master huang sneered, “You are in trouble now. No one dares to provoke our Huang family here!”

“Is that so?”Qin Yu sneered again and again, “What a coincidence. In Shengguo, I am not afraid of anyone.”

Just as Qin Yu said, Qin Yu was the Master of all the major forces. What was a mere aristocratic family to him?

Young Master Huang wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Alright! If you have the ability, don’t leave!”

“I’m not leaving. Go back and tell your father. I’ll give him one hour to bring the Huang family and the young ones to kneel down and apologize,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“If I don’t see them in one hour, I’ll make the Huang family disappear from this world.”

Young Master Huang didn’t say a word. He just sneered.

He turned around and left the Yang family. When he reached the door, he said fiercely, “Don’t go if you’re a man. If you dare to leave, I’ll kill this little B * Tch!”

After saying this, young master Huang ran away. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Jing’s face was very ugly. She couldn’t help but sigh and said, “Qin Yu, you’d better leave quickly. The Huang family is very powerful in Shengguo...”

“How Big?”Qin Yu laughed.

Yang Jing thought for a moment and said, “Do you know about the Tian he alliance? His father is a member of the Tian he alliance! And he is a high-ranking member of the Tian he alliance!”

“The Tian he alliance?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but sneer.

“The Tian he alliance seems to have been destroyed. Don’t tell me you don’t Know?”

Yang Jing frowned and said, “Destroyed? When did it happen? Who Did It? The Purple Flame sect?”

“The Purple Flame sect is gone too.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“To be precise, there is only one force in Sheng Kingdom now. That force is called Heaven’s Gate.”

“And I am the leader of Heaven’s Gate.”

Hearing this, Yang Jing couldn’t help but laugh, “Qin Yu, don’t joke around. I admit that you have some ability, but compared to the forces in Zhe, you are still far from it.”

“Qin Yu, I already owe you a favor. You should leave quickly. For me, there’s no need to offend the Huang family.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t like bullies who force their way in.”

Because the Han family was the same back then. Seeing Yang Jing today, Qin Yu thought of Yan Ruoxue back then.

“Miss, you’d better go and ask about the heaven’s Gate. Now the Heaven’s Gate is the biggest organization in Shengguo. The Heaven’s Peace League is nothing.”The Mustache Man said with a smile.

Seeing this, Yang Jing couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

She obviously didn’t believe Qin Yu’s words.

Tianhe alliance had been standing in Shengguo for many years. How could it collapse just like that?

“Well, go and make some food. I’m a little hungry,”Qin Yu patted his stomach.

Yang Jing couldn’t help but smile bitterly, “You’re still in the mood to eat at this time. You’re so generous.”

Having said that, Yang Jing still obediently went to the kitchen.

A few minutes later, Yang Jing came out with two bowls of noodles.

“There’s nothing to eat at home. Make do with it,”said Yang Jing.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s already very good. My favorite food is noodles.”

“Not bad. It would be even better if there were two heads of garlic,”the mustache man nodded silently.

The two of them picked up the noodles and began to eat slowly.

Seeing that one hour was getting closer and closer, Yang Jing began to feel uneasy.

She paced back and forth anxiously in the living room. The anxiety in her eyes could not be concealed.

“Phew.”At this time, Qin Yu patted his stomach and sat on the sofa in satisfaction.

“I’m full.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu glanced at the clock on the wall and couldn’t help but frown. “It’s been an hour, right?”

Yang Jing said in a low voice, “Yes, exactly an hour.”

A trace of coldness instantly flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

“This Huang family has turned a deaf ear to my words,”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

At this moment, a voice came from outside.

“Who dares to make the Huang family kneel and apologize?”

Before the voice fell, a man walked in with young master Huang.

This man was none other than the head of the Huang family, Huang Ren!

“Who dares to make the Huang family kneel?”Huang Ren said coldly.

Young Master Huang pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Dad, it’s him!”

Yang Jing’s face was a bit ugly. She quickly walked forward and explained, “Mr. Huang, this is a misunderstanding. Qin Yu is my friend. It has nothing to do with him.”

Huang Ren was about to get angry when he heard Qin Yu’s name. His face suddenly changed.

“Qin... Qin Yu?”Huang Ren scratched his ears.

He hurriedly looked at the young man on the sofa and asked tentatively, “You... You Are Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu did not answer him. Instead, he frowned and said, “I clearly remember that the people of the Heavenly Peace Union were all killed by me. How could there still be a fish like you who slipped through the net?”
