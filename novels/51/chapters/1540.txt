Chapter 1541: Chapter 1,541, First Elder, who had nowhere else to go

Looking at the departing Yongji, everyone could not help but sigh.

Seeing that the heavenly cloud sect was about to be destroyed, Qin Yu changed his mind at this time.

No one knew what had happened, and no one knew why Qin Yu had suddenly changed his mind.

“Qin Yu, you have completely offended the northern lands with today’s matter. I will definitely pay a visit to the northern lands another day!”Huai Chang said coldly.

After saying this, he brought his men and planned to leave.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly raised his hand and clenched his fingers. The space instantly distorted!

Huai Chang, who had originally planned to leave, immediately froze on the spot.

“Did I let you leave?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Huai Chang’s expression changed drastically as he angrily berated, “Qin Yu, do you really have to be so ruthless!”

Qin Yu sneered, “You people from the northern lands have attacked me time and time again, do you really think I’m made of mud? Today, let me put it this way, whoever gets close to the northern lands will be my enemy!”

With that said, Qin Yu suddenly exerted force with his hand, and instantly pulled Huai Chang over!

Following that, Qin Yu clenched his fist, and a golden light appeared, and a terrifying power was even more boundless!

“Boom!”

......

Huai Chang did not dare to be negligent. He hurriedly used all his spells in an attempt to resist, but in front of Qin Yu’s Golden Fist, he appeared extremely weak!

Half of his body was directly shattered, and the sky was filled with blood rain. Meanwhile, Huai Chang fiercely fell down!

In the next second, Qin Yu approached him and raised his foot to step on Huai Chang’s body.

Huai Chang’s expression was greatly shocked. He was shocked to find that he was actually unable to retaliate in front of Qin Yu!

“Is this Qin Yu already so powerful? !”Someone exclaimed.

“Huai Chang has no way of fighting back in front of him. If that’s the case, Qin Yu’s strength is probably enough to reach the pinnacle of the three madmen and three deadly ones!”

Huai Chang, who was lying on the ground, turned pale. He gritted his teeth and looked at Qin Yu, saying, “Qin Yu, don’t go overboard!”

“Oh? Too Far?”Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed.

“When you Northland burned, killed, and plundered in the southern region, did you ever think of going too far?”

“You!”Huai Chang was so angry that he almost vomited blood. What made him break down the most was that he did not have any means to retaliate.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Huai Chang and said, “It’s time for you to end your sinful life.”

Just as Qin Yu was about to end Huai Chang’s life, a black mist suddenly exploded from his body!

Following that, Huai Chang under Qin Yu’s feet disappeared without a trace!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He activated the desolate God’s eye in an attempt to find Huai Chang’s figure, but he discovered that Huai Chang had already disappeared without a trace.

“It’s the teleportation formation of the northern lands.”Di Zun walked forward and said.

Qin Yu could not help but frown as he said in a low voice, “Their teleportation formation is really impressive.”

Huai Chang had already escaped, so the remaining disciples of the northern lands were not worth mentioning. Qin Yu was not even willing to make a move.

The surrounding crowd, perhaps to show their loyalty to the Heavenly Cloud Sect, began to fight against the people of the northern lands.

In a short while, the people of the northern lands were completely slaughtered, turning the scene into a sea of corpses.

Monk Hongxi sighed slightly at the side. He cupped his hands toward Qin Yu and said, “Little Friend Qin Yu will definitely become a great person in the future. This old monk will take his leave.”

Qin Yu originally wanted to let him stay and discuss the dao, but on second thought, it was better to pay a visit to the temple of no fate.

After monk Hongxi left, the surrounding people surrounded him one after another.

“Congratulations, Mr. Qin, for stepping into the Mighty Realm!”

“Our South Province has gained another top-notch martial artist. The whole world is celebrating. Congratulations!”

Qin Yu did not have much of a reaction in the face of everyone’s flattery.

He knew very well that these people were just fence-sitters. There was no need to befriend them.

Qin Yu turned around and walked in front of the deputy sect leader. He helped him up with one hand.

“How are you? Are You Alright?”Qin Yu asked.

The deputy sect master opened his mouth as if he wanted to thank him, but he didn’t say it out loud. He only hummed in gratitude.

“Qin Yu, why didn’t you appear earlier!”

At this moment, a discordant voice suddenly sounded.

Turning around, he realized that the person who said this was actually the first elder.

He angrily walked towards Qin Yu and said angrily, “If you had attacked them earlier, our heavenly cloud sect wouldn’t have fallen to such a State!”

Looking at the first elder who was glaring at him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

In the next second, Qin Yu suddenly raised his hand and slapped the first Elder’s face!

The force of this slap was extremely strong, and it almost killed the first elder who was already on the verge of death! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Half of his face was shattered, and it was a terrible sight. One couldn’t even see his face clearly.

“First Elder, I did put aside my grudges with the Heavenly Cloud sect for the time being, but I never said that I would let you go,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Hearing this, the first elder’s face changed drastically!

“Qin Yu, what... What do you mean? !”The first elder said in terror.

Qin Yu walked toward the first elder step by step and sneered, “You killed Zhen Yue and plotted against me many times. Today is the anniversary of your death. Whoever dares to stop me will die with you!”

As soon as he said this, everyone fell silent. No one dared to speak up for the first elder.

“Vice... Vice sect master, stop him!”The first elder said anxiously.

However, the vice sect master closed his eyes slightly as if he had fallen asleep.

“What are you all standing there for? Stop Him!”The first elder yelled at the others.

Everyone present looked at each other in dismay. No one dared to provoke Qin Yu at this time.

“Bastards, You Bunch of bastards!”First Elder flew into a rage. At this time, no one was willing to step forward!

Seeing that Qin Yu was getting closer and closer, First Elder’s heart also became more and more flustered.

“Qin Yu, everything can be discussed. Now, we should be united against the outside world!”First Elder said anxiously.

Qin Yu sneered, “United against the outside world? Don’t think that I don’t know that you’ve never agreed to attack the northern lands. You even want to ally with the northern lands. Shameless Old Man!”

First Elder wriggled on the ground and said anxiously, “Qin Yu, let me go. If you let me go this time, I promise that I won’t go against you again. What do you think?”

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “Do you think I Still Care? From the moment you attacked Zhen Yue, you were sentenced to death.”

Seeing that his words had no effect, first elder immediately changed his face.

He roared, “Qin Yu, you forced me to do this. Do you really think I’m afraid of You? !”

After saying that, first elder waved his hand and a bell appeared in his hand!

This chime carried an extremely mysterious internal QI, and a strong sense of oppression assaulted his face!

“HM? It’s the Heavenly Bell? How could it be in your hands!”The deputy sect master saw this and immediately flew into a rage!

“Just now, when the Heavenly Cloud sect was in danger, why didn’t you take out the Heavenly Bell?”

“No wonder we searched the entire sect, but couldn’t find this magical artifact. It turns out that it was hidden by the first elder!”
