Chapter 2620: Increasing Strength

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The soldier did not enter but spoke faintly at the doorway.

The first item was a completely large knife. This knife was surrounded by a layer of iridescent radiance, emanating immense energy.

It was on a completely different level compared to his Shadowless, and there was no black aura covering the blade. The blade’s condition could be directly examined, making it almost a complete and undamaged weapon. The second item was a suit of armor. Qin Yu’s divine sense delved into the armor.

Subsequently, an enormous amount of information instantly entered his sea of consciousness. Qin Yu immediately witnessed countless battle scenes involving the Nine Vicious Armor.

The Nine Vicious Armor could autonomously defend and, when sensing danger, it would extend wings to evade imminent threats, showcasing remarkable evasive capabilities.

“Being able to see the Nine Vicious Armor here is interesting,” Immortal Emperor Yao remarked with surprise.

“Nine Vicious Armor? Is it a living being?” Qin Yu, unfazed by Immortal Emperor Yao’s sudden appearance, inquired.

“This is a consciousness from the monster race, traversing through various realms. In ancient wars, it gained notorious fame. Unexpectedly, it arrived at the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom and crafted an armor. Although this armor is potent, it has its consciousness. Controlling it is nearly impossible with your current strength,” Immortal Emperor Yao explained with a smile.

Qin Yu felt a bit astonished, realizing his lack of insight.

The profound nature of this armor could rival some Peak of Tribulation Transcendening magical artifacts in the lower realms.

Furthermore, the idea of refining a ferocious spirit into armor could only be said to be fantastical. He did not know how it could be realized.

Qin Yu continued to walk forward. The third item was a transparent bubble. There seemed to be some consciousness inside this bubble.

Qin Yu’s consciousness entered the bubble, but he did not receive any information.

Qin Yu was a little surprised. He probed his consciousness into it again, but there was still no information.

“Hmm? It’s the soul of a spirit cat. This is a good find.” Immortal Emperor Yao expressed surprise.

“Young one, don’t waste your effort. Your consciousness can’t capture this thing. It’s a spiritual beast with the keenest sense of danger in the world. If a mighty figure were to intervene and blind its six senses, no one could capture it. Just choose this one,” Immortal Emperor Yao advised, seeing Qin Yu’s interest. Qin Yu decisively picked up the soul.

“Then how do I use this thing?”

Qin Yu was somewhat curious. In such a small space, it seemed impossible to capture its consciousness. What kind of keen perception was this?

“Consume him directly, integrate him into your divine soul. In a brief period, you will possess six senses as formidable as a spirit cat. During this process, unless confronted by superior strength, it will be challenging to eliminate you. Furthermore, even after the dissipation of the soul’s power, there will be continued enhancement to your divine soul and six senses. This is a single-use item. The extent of fusion with your soul after usage depends on the level of compatibility between you and the spirit cat.”

“Excellent item!”

With Immortal Emperor Yao’s explanation, Qin Yu’s eyes brightened.

The main thing was that there was still a chance to increase his six senses. It had to be known that whether it was a mysterious item or a medicinal pill, they could only temporarily increase his strength. It was extremely rare to be able to strengthen the strength of the main body.

Qin Yu continued to look forward. In front of him was an eyeball.

The eyeball seemed to be a living thing with a pair of strange eyes.

His eyes were still trembling, looking very strange.

“What exactly is this thing?”

Curiosity filled Qin Yu’s voice, yet there was no response from Immortal Emperor Yao.

“Disappeared again?

Qin Yu felt a bit perplexed. One moment he was speaking, and the next he vanished.

Once more, Qin Yu immersed his divine sense into the twin -pupil eyeball. Witnessing the scene change, he saw a beam of light radiate from the pupils.

The pupils faced a demonic race emitting intense demonic qi, and the light shot directly at it.

The demonic being displayed no reaction, but its image peculiarly manifested within the twin pupils.

Then, another person appeared in his eyes. This demon kept sparring with him.

The Pupil of Duplication was a terrifying ability. It seemed to be able to duplicate a person’s aura and form a new living being within his consciousness. Moreover, all the abilities of this living being could be replicated.

Afterward, he could continually practice with this pupil until he discovered a way to defeat him.

This was an extremely heaven-defying ability. Qin Yu was somewhat shocked.

Imagine if you met an extremely powerful person and used this Pupil of Duplication to duplicate them.

Even if he could only learn one or two moves from the pupil, it would be a formidable gain.

However, this pupil, like the previous mysterious one, had cracks, indicating it might be usable two, three times, or even fewer.

At the moment, this wasn’t very impactful for him. He urgently needed to prevail in the final battle.

Qin Yu directed his gaze to the last diamond-shaped space. After immersing his consciousness in it, he received straightforward information.

The Time Rubik’s Cube could absorb souls into it. One year inside equated to one year outside.

Yet, this was a single-use item, and the number of entrants was limited. Only five Dao Consciousness could enter.

A whole year!

To be able to transmit another time and space in this space, this kind of strength would probably require one’s attainments in the spatial rules to reach an extremely terrifying level to be able to refine it.

Qin Yu forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart and grabbed the Time Rubik’s Cube in his hand.

What they needed the most now was time. With this Time Rubik’s Cube, they could reach a new height in a day and a half.

“Just these two.”

Qin Yu informed the soldiers.

The soldier raised his hand, and the token closed the wall again.

At this moment, the monster race army had nearly completed its assembly. They awaited Seifer’s recovery before launching a full-scale assault.

In the general’s residence, Qin Yu, Shen Qian, Ju Wuwei, and Li Yue were in the main hall.

Qin Yu told them about the gains from this trip. Naturally, Qin Yu wanted to take the spirit cat’s soul. This was a military merit that he had exchanged his life for. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

The Time Rubik’s Cube was reserved for Li Yue.

“Next, we have a year. If we still cannot overcome Cang Zhi, we will all perish here. Furthermore, though the City Lord of Nine Tune City will hinder Seifer, with the demise of the Dao Mystical Sage, the order suppression here will significantly weaken..”
