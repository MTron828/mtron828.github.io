Chapter 832: I’m Here to Kill People

The huge force instantly lifted Su Qian up.

Su Qian’s face flushed red as she struggled non-stop. Her eyes were filled with pain and fear.

“You still dare to appear in front of me?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

Su Qian said with difficulty, “I... don’t understand... What are you saying...”

“Don’t understand? As a member of the Hong Yi Sect, how can you not understand?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Su Qian kept patting Qin Yu’s arm and said in pain, “I. . . really don’t understand...”

Qin Yu saw that she didn’t seem to be lying, so he let go of her hand.

Su Qian, who was able to breathe again, desperately breathed in the fresh air.

She looked at Qin Yu and said, “What exactly do you mean?”

“Hong Yi Sect plotted against me. Are you sure you didn’t know?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“Plotted against you? Didn’t they help you bring her out?” Su Qian asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu glanced at Zheng Ke and said, “Do you know her?”

“No,” Zheng Ke said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “Maybe Su Qian really didn’t know.”

“Take me to the Hong Yi Sect,” Qin Yu said to Su Qian.

Su Qian stood up from the ground and said with some bitterness, “You suddenly attacked me. Why should I take you there...”

“If you really didn’t know, I can apologize to you,” Qin Yu said.

Su Qian said in a low voice, “Who cares about your apology?”

Although she said that, she still led Qin Yu in the direction of the Mystic Realm.

The three of them arrived at the entrance of the Mystic Realm.

Su Qian didn’t enter the Mystic Realm in the same way as before.

She could only take out her phone to inform Song Shan.

A few minutes later.

Rays of light flashed like ripples in front of the two of them.

Then, they saw Song Shan walk out of the Mystic Realm. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was about to speak, but when he saw Qin Yu beside Su Qian, his expression changed drastically. Without saying a word, he directly closed the entrance of the Mystic Realm!

Su Qian was dumbstruck. She glanced at Qin Yu and said, “What... What’s going on?”

Qin Yu didn’t explain. Instead, he turned to look at Zheng Ke and said, “You can open this Mystic Realm, right?”

Zheng ke nodded and said, “This is the most ordinary and simplest Mystic Realm. The secret key is also extremely simple.”

“Then don’t waste time. Help me open it.” Qin Yu took a step back.

Zheng Ke walked in front of the Mystic Realm. He took out his token and began to search for the Mystic Realm’s Daoist Techniques.

Although Zheng Ke was also a member of the Hong Yi Sect, he knew nothing about this Mystic Realm.

At this moment, in the Mystic Realm, Song Shan was desperately running towards Ning Kun’s office.

“Mr. Ning, something bad has happened!” Song Shan panted and pushed the door open.

Ning Kun glanced at him and said coldly, “What’s the matter? Why are you making such a fuss?”

Song Shan swallowed hard and said, “Qin Yu is here! He’s at the entrance of the Mystic Realm. I almost let him in just now!”

“Qin Yu?” Ning Kun suddenly stood up and a trace of worry flashed across his face.

Ning Kun knew very well Qin Yu came here this time to settle the score.

“Don’t worry, he can’t open this Mystic Realm.” Ancestor Guan walked forward and said lightly.

“Mr. Ning, what are you afraid of? This is a Mystic Realm. Without our permission, who can enter?”

Ning Kun glanced at him and felt slightly relieved.

But after thinking for a while, Ning Kun finally decided to go to his immediate superior to discuss it.

“You guys stay here and guard. If Qin Yu really comes, you guys think of a way to stall him,” said Ning Kun.

Ancestor Guan sneered. “He is an outsider. How can he enter?”

Ning Kun didn’t say anything and quickly walked towards the black-robed man’s room.

He arrived at the black-robed man’s room.

The moment the door opened, Ning Kun anxiously said, “Qin Yu came looking for us! He’s guarding outside the Mystic Realm now!”

Hearing this, the black-robed man suddenly stood up.

A trace of fear flashed across his face, and he unconsciously took two steps back.

“Sir, what’s wrong?” Ning Kun couldn’t help but feel puzzled.

“Qin Yu is still outside the Mystic Realm. He shouldn’t be able to enter, right?”

The black-robed man didn’t say a word, but cold sweat was dripping down his forehead.

A few minutes later, the black-robed man braced himself and said, “Mystic Realm Master Zheng Ke is in his hands...”

“Mystic Realm Master?” Ning Kun’s expression immediately changed drastically!

The black-robed man pretended to be calm and said, “Think of a way to stabilize him first. I need some time to use a secret technique to deal with him.”

Ning Kun hurriedly nodded and said, “Sir, don’t worry. I understand!”

After saying this, Ning Kun turned around and walked out.

After Ning Kun left, the black-robed man’s expression completely darkened.

“I can’t just sit here and wait for death.” The black-robed man took a deep breath.

“If Qin Yu can come to Qing City at this time, it means that Elder Shen is already dead.”

“Even Elder Shen died at his hands. What strength do I have to fight him? ”

It turned out that this black-robed man didn’t have any secret techniques at all.

All he could think of was to run away quickly!

Outside the Mystic Realm.

Zheng Ke quickly opened the Mystic Realm.

“Wow, how did you do it? ” Su Qian was stunned.

Qin Yu glanced at her and didn’t explain. Instead, he said, “Come in with me.”

“Okay.” Su Qian didn’t think too much. He immediately followed Qin Yu into the Mystic Realm.

As the three of them entered, the entrance slowly disappeared.

The moment they stepped into the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

Compared to the second Mystic Realm of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, this place was indeed too shabby.

Not only was there no rich spiritual energy, and even the buildings inside were in a mess.

“This is a low-level Mystic Realm. There’s nothing strange about it.” Zheng Ke seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s confusion.

“Thank you,” Qin Yu grunted and then strode towards the hall.

In the hall, Ning Kun was sitting there drinking tea, waiting for Qin Yu’s arrival.

In the entire hall, there were several Martial Marquises standing, and Song Shan and Ancestor Guan were standing behind Ning Kun.

Soon, Qin Yu brought Su Qian to the hall.

As soon as they entered, Ning Kun said enthusiastically, “Qin Yu, why are you here? Why didn’t you inform me when you came?!”

“That’s right, that’s right, so that we can go and welcome you!” Song Shan also said with a smile.

Qin Yu glanced at him. Without saying anything, he slapped Song Shan in the air and directly shattered his head!

The sudden change of events immediately caused the entire hall to panic!

Ancestor Guan’s face was filled with shock that turned into fear!

“Qin Yu, you... What do you mean by this?” Ning Kun gritted his teeth and braced himself to say.

Qin Yu looked at Ning Kun coldly and said, “Stop pretending. I’m not here to negotiate with you. I’m here to kill people.”
