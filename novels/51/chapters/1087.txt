Chapter 1088: Chapter One Thousand and eighty-eight, great success 

The mustached man rubbed his chin, and a trace of craftiness flashed through his eyes.

“You don’t seem to have anything on you that you can give me.”The mustached man sized up Qin Yu.

This was the truth. Although Qin Yu had many treasures on him, these treasures were not worth mentioning in the eyes of the mustached man.

“How about this, you give me three drops of blood essence, how about it?”The mustached man said with a smile.

“Three drops of blood essence?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Although blood essence was very important to cultivators, Qin Yu’s three drops of blood essence didn’t seem to be of much use.

“Okay.”Qin Yu agreed without thinking.

As long as he could get the divine sense of the more than ten thousand martial marquis, three drops of blood essence was nothing.

After saying this, Qin Yu was about to force out his blood essence and give it to the mustached man.

At this time, the handlebar mustache stopped Qin Yu and shook his head. “Not now. Your blood essence is worthless in my eyes.”

“Not Now? What do you mean?”Qin Yu frowned and said.

The handlebar mustache said with a smile, “What I Want is your blood essence after the great success stage. A great success stage chaotic body. One Drop of blood essence has the power to destroy the world. It is a rare holy item.”

“After the great success stage?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, and a trace of playfulness appeared in his eyes.

“That’s right. After reaching the great success stage, the chaotic body is said to be invincible in the world, and it can be above the universe,”the mustached man said proudly.

“How is it? Do you agree or not?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Are you so sure that I can reach the great success stage? Aren’t you afraid that I will die halfway?”

“Aiya, this venerable self is fond of gambling. I will treat it as a gamble,”said the moustache man.

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “Okay, Deal!”

Only then did the moustache man pass the jar in his hand to Qin Yu.

The jar emitted traces of divine might. It was the power formed by the divine senses of more than ten thousand martial marquis.

As long as he absorbed this power, Qin Yu was confident that he would be able to step into the middle stage of the Martial Marquis.

However, he was not in a hurry. Instead, he put the jar away for the time being.

“It’s a pity that I didn’t manage to kill Tian Xuehong,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Currently, Qin Yu had three enemies on the surface.

He Teng, Tian Xuehong, and the higher-ups who could appear at any time.

However, Qin Yu had no way to kill these three people because he had no idea where they were.

‘a month is neither a long nor a short period of time. I’m afraid that I’ll have to prepare a complete plan,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was no longer possible for them to seal the second secret realm completely.

With their abilities, it wouldn’t be difficult for them to find a secret realm master.

After thinking about it, the only thing they could do now was to intimidate the world so that they wouldn’t dare to make a move against Qin Yu.

In the next few days, Qin Yu traveled through the mountains and the bustling city. He even came to the entrance of the various secret realms many times and stood there for a long time.

This was an invisible deterrent. The secret realms that were targeted immediately trembled. They didn’t even dare to breathe loudly for fear of angering this killing God. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It was only after several days that Qin Yu stopped his travels.

He returned to the martial arts association of Jingdu and planned to once again enter the Scripture depository to find information about the chaotic body and the star field mentioned by the handlebar mustache.

At this moment, in the first secret realm.

Eight high-ranking officials were gathered on a mountain peak.

There was a huge rock on the mountain peak. The rock was flickering with a dark light. On the rock, there were densely-packed talismans carved.

At this moment, tiny cracks had already appeared on this rock.

The cracks were very small and could not be seen without a careful look. However, this meant that the seal had loosened.

The moment the stone shattered, the first secret realm and the second secret realm would pass through completely.

“Are we really going to break this seal?”An old man among the crowd asked coldly.

“Once this seal is broken, it means that the first secret realm and the current world will pass through completely. At that time, everyone will have the chance to step into the first secret realm.”

“That’s right. Once the seal is broken, there will be no turning back.”

The few of them seemed to be weighing the pros and cons, and each of them had solemn expressions on their faces.

“The seal must be broken.”Finally, someone spoke.

The one who spoke was a hunchbacked old man.

This person’s name was Yan Yongfu. He was the one who had used Gu Zizhen’s body to fight Qin Yu!

The other higher-ups all looked at Yan Yongfu.

Yan Yongfu said coldly, “I have fought with Qin Yu before. His strength is unfathomable, and his future is limitless.”

“He is only at the early-stage of the martial saint stage, but he already has the power to fight against a mighty figure. If he steps into the mighty figure stage, it will be a disaster for us.”

“Is it really that exaggerated?”Someone asked at this moment.

Another person said slowly, “Once the chaotic body is completed, it is indeed invincible in the world. There was once a chaotic body that was completed. It made almost all the great cultivators at the tribulation stage tremble. There are even rumors that this chaotic body almost beheaded the Heavenly Dao.”

“You guys seem to be worrying over nothing,”a beautiful woman who still retained her charm said.

“Even if we go through all the history, how many chaotic body cultivators have stepped into the great success stage? I’m afraid there are only five of them.”

“Moreover, this Qin Yu is only a martial saint. He is still thousands of miles away from the great success stage.”

Yan Yongfu glanced at him and said in a deep voice, “He is indeed very far away from the great success stage, but he is very close to the Almighty.”

“If this child steps into the mighty figure realm, the eight of us working together will most likely be reduced to ashes.”

When everyone heard this, they immediately fell silent.

Even though they had already launched a killing plan against Qin Yu, it still allowed Qin Yu to grow up.

Speaking of which, they couldn’t be blamed. After all, there was a restriction of the seal. They could only use the hands of others to get rid of Qin Yu.

“In order to prevent a disaster from happening, no matter what we have to do, we must get rid of him,”Yan Yongfu said coldly.

At this moment, a young man ran over in panic.

With a slide shovel, he knelt in front of them and said in panic, “Sir, my father... is my father really dead?”

The young man in front of them was none other than Gu Zizhen’s son, Gu Xinghe.

Yan Yongfu looked at Gu Xinghe in front of him and said faintly, “Yes, he was beheaded by Qin Yu. Both his body and soul were destroyed.”
