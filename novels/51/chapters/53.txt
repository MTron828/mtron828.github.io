Chapter 54: Lin Family Martial Arts School Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Lance received a slap from Lin Wan, but he didn’t say a word. However, his hand still held Lin Wan’s wrist tightly.

Lin Wan couldn’t break free, so she looked at the bodyguard behind her in exasperation.

“Zhang Xing, beat him up!” Lin Wan shouted.

The man called Zhang Xing took a step forward and raised his hand to slap Lance’s wrist.

Lance’s wrist was in pain, and he moved his hand away.

“Lance, what’s wrong? You don’t know your place anymore after becoming Lei Hu’s sidekick, do you?” Zhang Xing sneered.

Lance’s expression was a little ugly. He forced a smile and said, “Miss Lin is indeed wrong in this matter...”

“I don’t care who is right or wrong. My master’s orders are for me to protect her!” Zhang Xing snorted coldly.

“Stop talking nonsense and beat him up!” Lin Wan kept shouting angrily.

Qin Yu’s expression became colder and colder.

He looked at Lin Wan icily and said, “How did your parents raise you to be so rude at such a young age?”

“How dare you talk about my parents?” Lin Wan widened her eyes.

“Zhang Xing, beat him up!” Lin Wan stomped her feet and said angrily.

Zhang Xing took a step forward. He looked Qin Yu up and down and said aloofly, “Hurry up and return Angelica dahurica to her. Then bow and apologize to her. I can spare you then.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Are you worthy of it?”

Zhang Xing’s expression changed and he immediately shouted, “You’re courting death!”

After saying that, Zhang Xing clenched his fist and swung it at Qin Yu!

Zhang Xing’s strength was indeed above Lance’s, but his strength wasn’t even comparable to Yao Qing’s, so how could he be a match for Qin Yu?

Qin Yu didn’t even look at him as he raised his foot and kicked Zhang Xing’s lower abdomen.

Before Zhang Xing’s fist touched Qin Yu, his body flew out and he fell heavily to the ground!

A mouthful of blood gushed out!

When she saw this scene, not only did Lin Wan not have the slightest bit of repentance, but she instead clenched her fist and swung it at Qin Yu.

“You’re dead meat. If you dare to provoke me, my father will definitely beat you to death!” Lin Wan continuously hit and kicked Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu became more and more impatient. He wished that he could knock this defiant brat out with a slap.

However, Qin Yu, who had been strictly raised since he was young, was unable to lay a hand on a woman.

Fortunately, Lance managed to pull Lin Wan to the side in time.

Lin Wan was probably tired from the beating, so she stood not far away and pointed at Qin Yu. “Just you wait. My father definitely won’t let you off the hook!”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to waste his breath on such a person, so he ignored her.

After getting into the car, Lance couldn’t help but say apologetically, “Mr. Qin, I’m really sorry...”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “What does this have to do with you? As for your master, I’m wondering whether he’s worthy of his title or not. To have raised such a daughter, I guess he himself isn’t that good.”

Lance heard this and quickly explained, “My master is a good person. It’s just that... back then, he made enemies during a martial arts competition and caused his wife’s death. Therefore, he has always felt guilty toward Lin Wan, so he dotes on her...”

Hearing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

Lei Hu sent Qin Yu back to Dragon Paradise. Before he left, Lance said, “Don’t worry, Mr. Qin. I will definitely explain everything to my master.”

Qin Yu nodded.

He didn’t really care. If Lincheng dared to target him, Qin Yu didn’t mind teaching him a lesson.

After Lei Hu left, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to take out the stalk of Angelica dahurica.

Although the appearance of this stalk of Angelica dahurica wasn’t very appealing, it had a strong herbal aroma. He estimated that this stalk of Angelica dahurica was around ten years old. It was the oldest herb Qin Yu had ever seen.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and prepared to use this stalk of Angelica dahurica to refine the Qi Gathering Pill.

For those in the Qi Refining Stage, the Qi Gathering Pill was a holy object. A single Qi Gathering Pill could advance him to the next level!

“This stalk of Angelica dahurica should be able to refine a Qi Gathering Pill,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, Qin Yu cut the Angelica dahurica open and threw it into the casserole.

Qin Yu hadn’t yet produced spiritual fire, so he could only rely on natural fire.

Qin Yu raised his finger and injected spiritual energy into the casserole. With his spiritual energy as the guide, he refined the Qi Gathering Pill.

After more than two hours, the spiritual energy in Qin Yu’s body was almost completely drained.

Finally, with a loud explosion, the casserole suddenly cracked!

Two pills the size of peanuts lay quietly in the debris of the casserole.

“I actually refined two pills?” Looking at the two Qi Gathering Pills, Qin Yu was extremely excited!

He thought he could only refine one pill, but he didn’t expect to refine two pills! It completely exceeded Qin Yu’s expectations!

“I refined two Qi Gathering Pills with just a ten-year-old herbal pill. If it takes twenty to thirty years or even a hundred years... how many pills would I be able to refine?”

The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more excited he became! As long as he had enough herbs, it wasn’t difficult to enter the foundation establishment stage!

After that, Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and directly swallowed the two Qi Gathering Pills.

...

As the number one martial artist in Jiangcheng, Lincheng was well-known throughout Jiangcheng.

Many rich kids would come to train under him. This was because Lincheng was becoming increasingly well-connected.

“Dad, I don’t care. You have to teach him a lesson no matter what!” Lin Wan stomped her feet and complained petulantly.

Lincheng said with a slight headache, “Did you get into trouble again?”

During this period of time, the Lin Family Martial Arts School was having a competition with the Zheng Family Martial Arts School. Although it was a competition between disciples, it showcased the strength of a martial arts school.

Although Lincheng had many disciples under him, it was rumored that the Zheng family had hired a martial artist to help them. Lincheng was worried about this matter.

If they lost, the prestige of the Lin Family Martial Arts School would plummet.

To the Lin family, this would undoubtedly be a disaster.

“I didn’t cause trouble! It was clearly him who was causing trouble for me!” Lin Wan said angrily.

Lincheng looked at Zhang Xing and said with a dark expression, “What’s going on? Didn’t I ask you to protect her?”

Zhang Xing said somewhat apologetically, “Master, that kid was well-versed in martial arts. I wasn’t his match at all...”

“You piece of trash. He knocked you out with one kick!” Lin Wan couldn’t help but scold him with some disdain.

Hearing this, Lincheng said in surprise, “Jiangcheng has such an outstanding martial artist?”

Zhang Xing was his most outstanding disciple! He actually knocked him out with one kick?

Zhang Xing braced himself and said, “Master, I underestimated the enemy.”

“You’re trash. Don’t make excuses!” Lin Wan crossed her arms in front of her chest and said discontentedly.

However, Lincheng had other ideas.

If he could get him to help, wouldn’t the Lin family’s predicament be solved? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, Lincheng sighed slightly.

His daughter had just offended the other party, so how could the other party help?

“Oh right, and Lance actually helped that kid!” At this time, Lin Wan said angrily.

Hearing this, Lincheng immediately said with some excitement, “You mean... Lance knows him?”

“Yeah, he even helped him. Dad, you must teach Lance a good lesson!” Lin Wan said angrily.

Lincheng was immediately overjoyed. He laughed and said, “God is on my family’s side. Hurry up and call Lance!”

“Okay, I’ll call him over right now and teach him a good lesson!” Lin Wan thought that Lincheng was going to help her get revenge, so she shouted excitedly.
