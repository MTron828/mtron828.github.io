1780 The Terror of Thunder Courtyard

Upon hearing this, Xiaobai was obviously a little surprised.

“Zhongzhou? Do you still want to go to Zhongzhou?” Xiaobai was puzzled and asked.

“Mmm.” Qin Yu nodded and said, “I’m curious about Zhongzhou.”

Xioabai smiled and said, “There are indeed missions in Zhongzhou, but there are only a few of them. Missions in Zhongzhou are usually extremely dangerous. It has to be led by Jiu Xiao.”

“Who is Jiu Xiao?” Qin Yu asked.

“He’s the first Devil Hunter,” Xiaobai said. “He’s also the most respected person in the entire Demon-slaying Peak.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He didn’t really care who he would be going with. After all, he couldn’t go to Zhongzhou in his current state.

“Many thanks,” Qin Yu bowed slightly to Xiaobai.

“Mmm.” Xiaobai then said, “If you need anything, come and find me. I’ve been in Demon-slaying Peak for a long time. So I know more.”

“Sure, I will.” Qin Yu cupped his hands.

After he separated from Xiaobai, Qin Yu carried Jue Wu back to the cave abode.

“By the way, how are you feeling now?” Jue Wu asked casually.

“Basically, I can tolerate it,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“That’s good.” Jue Wu nodded. “When the time comes, you just follow me. Leave that so-called Ji Si to me.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu didn’t try to act brave. It was indeed not the time to do so.

The time was set to be three days later. As for how to get to the East Continent, he would have to figure it out himself. Thunder Courtyard would not provide any help.

This puzzled Qin Yu.

Thunder Courtyard was the inheritance of Immortal Emperor Lei. The capital of such an inheritance was enough to rule the entire Holy Region. It was even comparable to the nine great aristocratic families of Zhongzhou.

However, why did everyone come to Thunder Courtyard?

Thunder Courtyard was a place where everyone was free to do whatever they wanted to. It seemed that there was no point in doing so.

At night, Qin Yu couldn’t sleep. After much thought, he went to Xiaobai’s cave abode.

In the cave abode, Xioabai was writing and drawing as if it was recording something.

There was even a book beside him.

Xiaobai was not surprised to see Qin Yu coming in.

“What’s the matter?” He asked with a smile as he was keeping away the book.

“Nothing,” Qin Yu said. “I was bored and couldn’t sleep. Thus I came to chat with you. I hope I didn’t disturb you.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“No, you didn’t,” Xiaobai smiled and said. “Just ask if you have anything.”

Qin Yu thus told Xiaobai about his doubts.

Xiaobai couldn’t help but burst into laughter after hearing from him.

“Qin Yu, it seems you know very little about Immortal Emperor,” Xiaobai shook his head and said.

Qin Yu nodded. He indeed knew nothing about Immortal Emperor.

“A great cultivator at the Tribulation Stage can ensure the prosperity of a family for 10,000 years. And an Immortal Emperor can create terrifying existences such as the nine great aristocratic families,” Xiaobai said with a smile.

“Do you know why?” Xiaobai asked.

“No, I don’t know,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

“It’s because the inheritance left by Immortal Emperor is a treasure. The inheritance he left behind is not limited to a single item,” Xiaobai said indifferently.

“In Thunder Courtyard, you can indeed feel the internal qi of the Immortal Emperor. Not only that, but in the land of the Immortal Emperor, you are almost free from the rules and Great Dao of the world!

“Let me put it this way. Even a stone can develop a divine sense after being with Immortal Emperor for some time. A wild beast can even surpass a True Saint!

“Then, his former location is the holy land.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu was shocked!

Even a stone could develop a divine sense. What kind of terrifying technique was this?

“Even a piece of rotten wood can become an existence that transcends the world after following Immortal Emperor for some time,” Xiaobai laughed and said.

“We’re staying here to comprehend the Immortal Emperor’s path of being enlightened.”

Xiaobai then pointed at the main peaks in the distance.

“Under the circumstances of Great Upheaval, as long as you’re still alive, you will definitely be able to step into the True Saint realm here. If you have some talent, you can even probe into the cultivation realm of a great cultivator in the Tribulation Stage!” There was a hint of pride in Xiaobai’s tone!

“Therefore, even if your foundation is damaged, you don’t have to be too pessimistic. With time, you can also become a True Saint.”

At this moment, then only did Qin Yu finally know what the real resources of those big aristocratic families were.

The space where the Immortal Emperor existed was all infected and even transformed.

Just like Thunder Courtyard, in the Great Dao seemed to be all the paths of vindicating doa!

As long as one stayed here, it would be a great opportunity.

“Sign!” Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Thinking of this, he felt even sadder.

The chaotic body that was able to match the Yan family must have had a strong background.

He probably was also a disciple of one of the nine great aristocratic families.

They had been born in such an environment, so their understanding of the Great Dao was naturally not something that others could compare with.

“In that case, the descendants of those aristocratic families can reach the Immortal Emperor realm,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“It’s still the same old thing. You don’t understand what ‘Immortal Emperor’ means,” Xiaobai shook his head and said.

“The heaven’s favorites of the aristocratic families may be qualified to step into the Tribulation Stage. However, they no longer can rely on external resources for their last step.

“You must understand that every Immortal Emperor is an amazing existence. There are only a few Immortal Emperors in the history of the Holy Region.”

Qin Yu nodded and roughly understood what Xiaobai meant.

The resources left behind by their families would definitely bring them to a very high level.

However, if he wanted to be at the top of the world, they still had to rely on themselves.

“Qin Yu, why did you choose Demon-slaying Peak? You must know that the death rate of Demon-slaying Peak is not low,” Xiaobai suddenly asked.

Qin Yu couldn’t tell him the truth. Thus he said, “I prefer to comprehend Great Dao during life-and-death battles.”

Xiaobai laughed out loud and said, “It’s good that you have this idea! Let me tell you, blindly cultivating in closed-door cultivation may bring about the advancement of one’s cultivation realm. However, when compared to those heaven’s favorites who have fought their way out of death, they will never be able to compete with them!”

Qin Yu nodded. That was indeed true.

A flower growing in a greenhouse could never compare to a flower that had grown naturally under rain and storm.

“Take good care of yourself to stay alive. Listen to the teachings of Thunder Courtyard’s dao technique and step into the True Saint realm. You can then do whatever you want in the Holy Region,” Xiaobai consoled him and said.

Qin Yu smiled and said nothing. If his foundation was damaged, he probably could only pursue the realm of True Saint.

But that was not Qin Yu’s goal.

“Many thanks.” Qin Yu bowed to Xiaobai, said goodbye, and was about to leave.

Just then, Xiaobai called out to Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you’d better be careful. Your story seems to have spread all over Demon-slaying Peak,” Xiaobai laughed and said.

“What story?” Qin Yu stopped and asked.

“Of course, it’s about what happened in Nanzhou. Especially how you defeated Yuan Xiu at the Mighty Realm,” Xiaobai said.
