Zhou Tong’s expression changed drastically when he saw Qin Yu!

It was as if he had seen a ghost!

“Qin... Qin Yu! How could it be you?!” Zhou Tong shouted in shock, and his body trembled nonstop!

Qin Yu sneered. “Why? Are you disappointed that I didn’t die?”

Zhou Tong’s expression was extremely ugly, and he was extremely puzzled!

He couldn’t figure out how Qin Yu could escape from Hong Wu!

“Zhou Tong, do you know the consequences of finding someone to kill me?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and the expression on his face was menacing.

This terrified Zhou Tong, and he said in a panic, “You... let go of me right now! Otherwise, I’ll call someone!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Okay.”

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his hand and slapped Zhou Tong’s face.

This slap made Zhou Tong turn 360 degrees on the spot, and then he fell to the ground.

“You... you actually dare to hit me! I will revoke your qualification to participate in the competition!” Zhou Tong shouted angrily.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “Sorry, you can’t revoke it.”

After saying that, Qin Yu pulled Mr. Yang away and left.

Mr. Yang was overjoyed. He grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said excitedly, “Qin Yu, you’re not dead. That’s great. We all thought you were...”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s not that easy to kill me.”

On the other side, Zhou Tong’s expression turned extremely ugly after he went back and sat down.

He gritted his teeth, took out his cell phone, and called Hong Wu.

“Hong Wu, what’s going on? Why is Qin Yu still alive?!” Zhou Tong asked angrily.

Hong Wu sighed and said, “I’m not his match.”

“What?!” Zhou Tong’s expression turned even uglier!

Even a veteran Inner Strength Past Master was no match for Qin Yu? How could this be?

At this moment, the news had already spread, and almost everyone was talking about it.

Even the internet was filled with videos of Qin Yu and Hong Wu!

The people in the martial arts world of the provincial capital were discussing this matter and wondering who Qin Yu was.

However, Zhou Tong didn’t know anything about it.

“D*mn it!” After he hung up the phone, Zhou Tong couldn’t help but get angry!

“Qin Yu, let me tell you, you definitely won’t win the championship!” Zhou Tong narrowed his eyes and sneered.

...

Qin Yu and Mr. Yang sat in the audience seats and quietly watched the match on the stage.

Unfortunately, these people weren’t impressive at all. Compared to Qin Yu, they were simply worlds apart. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After watching a few matches, Qin Yu felt bored, so he didn’t continue watching. Instead, he took out his phone and browsed the local news.

News of the incident was playing everywhere, and the video had gone viral.

The comment section below was even more lively. For a moment, it was as if the entire provincial capital was discussing this matter.

Qin Yu looked at the news and couldn’t help but shake his head.

Hong Wu was a veteran Inner Strength Past Master. His defeat would undoubtedly cause a huge uproar.

Compared to the Liu family’s submission, this seemed to be more proof of Qin Yu’s ability.

In the Wei Family’s Residence, Wei Ming stared at the video intently while beads of sweat were dripping down his forehead.

“Hong Wu actually lost...” Wei Ming couldn’t believe it!

He clearly remembered that not long ago, Qin Yu was only on par with Liu Shihui. How could he be so invincible now?

“Fortunately, I didn’t offend him...” Wei Ming wiped the sweat off his forehead while feeling a lingering sense of fear.

A Inner Strength Past Master had the power to rule over an area! A thirty-year-old Inner Strength Past Master would be highly sought after and even recruited!

At the same time, people in the Chuzhou Region also saw this video.

The Deputy Chief, Mr. Wu, and the others were watching the multimedia screen.

On the screen, there was the fight between Qin Yu and Hong Wu.

“Are you sure that he is only an Inner Strength Master Hands?” The Deputy Chief looked at Yu Jin in shock.

Yu Jin quickly saluted him and said, “That’s right, I swear!”

“Hahahaha!” The Deputy Chief couldn’t help but burst into laughter!

He looked at Commander Guo and said, “What do you think? I told you that Qin Yu is definitely worth recruiting!”

Commander Guo also sighed and said, “Hong Wu has been distinguished for many years and is a famous Inner Strength Past Master in Chuzhou. Other than those prominent families, no one can control him. I never thought that he would be defeated by someone much younger.”

This would undoubtedly shock the entire martial arts world of Chuzhou!

Mr. Wu, who was standing at the side, kept silent. He stared at the video and no one knew what he was thinking.

“Chief Wu, what do you think?” The Deputy Chief looked at Mr. Wu and asked with a smile.

Mr. Wu sighed slightly.

He whispered, “I underestimated Qin Yu. Maybe... he really has the qualifications to marry Miss Yan.”

Mr. Wu couldn’t help but think of the bet between him and Yan Ruoxue.

Mr. Wu shook his head helplessly at the thought of this.

“The Yan family really has foresight,” Mr. Wu muttered.

“From now on, Qin Yu’s name might become a household name in Chuzhou.”

...

Qin Yu had no idea about the comments from the outside world.

He had no idea what it meant to win against Hong Wu.

“Mr. Qin, as far as I know, Zhou Tong’s personal disciple is also participating in this competition,” Mr. Yang reminded him.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He looked at a young man on the stage and asked, “Is it him?”

Mr. Yang asked in surprise, “Mr. Qin, how did you know?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “His alchemy skills are quite impressive. The others aren’t on the same level as him.”

“Most importantly, the herbs in his box are obviously much better than the others! This must have been arranged by Zhou Tong,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Mr. Yang suddenly came to a realization. He gave Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “Mr. Qin, you’re quite sharp.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He just looked at the young man quietly.

This young man was indeed quite capable. Moreover, Qin Yu had a premonition that this wasn’t his true strength.

“Mr. Qin, are you sure you can win against him?” Mr. Yang asked tentatively.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said indifferently, “I’m 100% sure. Let alone Zhou Tong’s disciple, even if Zhou Tong comes personally, I can still win!”
