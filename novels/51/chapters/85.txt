Chapter 86: Her Father Arrives! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The man’s expression was cold and fierce. It was obvious that he wasn’t someone to be trifled with.

“Who... who are you?!” Zhao Gang suppressed his fear and said in a trembling voice.

The man didn’t speak. He only said coldly, “Someone paid for a hit on your life. Don’t worry, I will let you go more comfortably.”

After saying that, the man walked towards Zhao Gang.

Zhao Gang said in fear, “Don’t come over! Otherwise, I won’t let you off the hook!”

The man didn’t say anything. He raised his hand and grabbed Zhao Gang.

His fingers were like sharp blades. Whoever he caught was dead meat!

“Bang!”

At this moment, the door was opened again.

The man stopped.

“Qin Yu, you... you came at the right time. Save us quickly!” Zhao Gang took this opportunity and hurriedly ran to the side.

Qin Yu ignored him. He glared at Zhao Gang and said, “Zhao Gang, I hadn’t planned to settle the score with you, but how dare you try to plot against Miss Yan... I must kill you today. I must kill you!”

Zhao Gang’s face instantly turned pale!

He had been exposed? Qin Yu actually knew?

“You... what nonsense are you talking about? I have no idea what you’re talking about!” Zhao Gang braced himself and said.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I won’t give you any chance to explain.”

“Who are you?” At this moment, the assassin suddenly asked in a cold voice.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said coldly, “Get lost!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“How insolent!” The assassin berated.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the assassin and said, “Do you want to die too?”

“That depends on whether you have the ability or not!” The assassin shouted angrily and grabbed at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t have the mood to tangle with him. He immediately clenched his fist and punched him!

This punch almost used up all of Qin Yu’s strength and instantly broke the assassin’s fist!

Following that, Qin Yu punched through the assassin’s chest!

The assassin, his eyes filled with disbelief, stared blankly at the bloody hole in front of his chest.

The bloody scene made Su Yan scream!

“Shut up!” Qin Yu was furious. He kicked a stool at Su Yan!

The stool just happened to hit Su Yan’s mouth!

After dealing with this assassin, Qin Yu walked towards Zhao Gang step by step.

He looked at Zhao Gang coldly and said, “Have you considered the consequences of this? I was kind enough to spare you, but you actually dared to plot against Miss Yan... you are simply unforgivable!”

At this moment, Zhao Gang was already scared to death. His entire body was trembling non-stop, and he couldn’t even stand up.

“Qin Yu, please spare me. It was... it was Shen Tian who asked me to do this. It has nothing to do with me. It has nothing to do with me... !” Zhao Gang knelt on the ground with a plop and kept kowtowing.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold.

It was actually Shen Tian who instigated it!

Originally, Qin Yu had already planned to let the Shen family go. He didn’t expect Shen Tian to actually do such a thing!

“I will never be soft-hearted to anyone in my life ever again.” Qin Yu’s heart grew even colder at this moment.

Looking at Zhao Gang, who was miserably begging him on the ground, Qin Yu didn’t have the slightest bit of pity.

He raised his foot and stomped on Zhao Gang’s head.

Zhao Gang’s head suffered such a huge force that it instantly exploded, like a watermelon!

Su Yan was so scared that she almost fainted. She ignored the pain of her mouth and knelt on the ground to beg for mercy, “Qin Yu, for the sake of us being husband and wife for so many years, please spare my life. I didn’t know about this at all. I swear...”

Looking at Su Yan, Qin Yu no longer had any patience.

He would rather kill a thousand innocent people than let one guilty person go!

Just as Qin Yu was about to make his move, his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu glanced at Su Yan, then walked to the side with the phone.

“Miss Yan, what’s wrong?” Qin Yu asked over the phone.

Yan Ruoxue said, “Where are you now?”

Qin Yu lied, “I’m... I’m at home.”

“I’m at the gate of Dragon Paradise Villa. Accompany me to the provincial capital,” Yan Ruoxue said in a sullen tone of voice.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “Okay.”

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu looked at Su Yan.

“Su Yan, from today onwards, you and I have nothing to do with each other. Of course, I also warn you that you’d better not tell a soul about this,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu quickly rushed to the door.

At the door, a Maybach was waiting.

After Qin Yu got into the car, the car quickly sped off into the darkness.

“You killed Zhao Gang?” Yan Ruoxue asked.

Qin Yu knew that he couldn’t hide it, so he nodded.

Yan Ruoxue didn’t say anything more about this.

“Oh right, this was plotted by Shen Tian!” At this time, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something and quickly said.

Before Yan Ruoxue could say anything, the secretary snorted lightly. “Do you think Miss Yan doesn’t know? Otherwise, why would we go to the provincial capital?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

At this moment, at the Shen family in the provincial capital.

Shen Yun’s family was filled with unease, and everyone had a look of fear on their faces.

“It’s all your fault, you b*stard!” Shen Yun slapped Shen Tian’s face again.

Shen Tian covered his face and muttered, “Dad, things really aren’t as serious as you think... There’s no way the Yan family would know that we did it...”

“F * ck you! You idiot!” Shen Yun’s face was filled with disappointment.

If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have indulged in Shen Tian like this!

At this moment, a car suddenly stopped outside the door.

The moment the car stopped, they saw a tall middle-aged man get out of the car.

He was tall and had an air of grace. His footsteps were sonorous and beside him, there were two bodyguards.

When he saw this man, Shen Yun’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly! Even his body started to tremble!

“Yan... Yan Yongxiu! Why... why is he here...” Shen Yun was already shaking like a leaf!

It was because this man was none other than Yan Ruoxue’s father, the son of Old Mister Yan!
