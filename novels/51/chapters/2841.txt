Chapter 2842: Shangguan Siming

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Then, his eyes locked on Jue Wu, who was in the phoenix spirits. A golden rainbow shot out from his hand.

The golden air spear stopped in front of the phoenix spirit formation as if it had fallen into a quagmire.

The phoenix spirits circled the spear and quickly dispelled the terrifying power.

As expected of the divine phoenix spirits. My full-powered attack was comparable to a level 12 peak power, yet it was so easily resolved.

Shangguan Siming was surprised.

However, it was impossible to control power out of thin air, especially the stronger the power.

Inheritor of the Divine Phoenix Race, how long could your spirit last?

Hundreds of golden spears slowly gathered around Shangguan Siming.

In the next moment, these spears tore through space and emitted a sharp whistling sound.

After that, it fell into the land protected by the phoenix spirits from all directions.

This time, the spears still failed. They were stopped by the phoenix spirits after entering that area.

Shangguan Siming’s pupils constricted slightly. Some of the spears had advanced further compared to last time.

It seemed that they had reached their limit. Were they waiting for the recovery of the Divine Might Chasing Star’s holy body?

Break the illusion!

The peak power covered the entire space. Suddenly, the world in front of Shangguan Siming began to change.

As the phoenix spirits revolved around him, a gap suddenly made his pupils enlarge.

A golden spear pierced through the hole once again.

Shangguan Siming’s body blurred.

The long spear tore through the sky like a golden rainbow, piercing Jue Wu’s body.

Half of her body exploded instantly.

Sky Ablaze!

Jue Wu suddenly opened his eyes. Two flame imprints appeared in the depths of her pupils.

The pure white clouds in the sky instantly turned blood-red.

Countless phoenix spirits danced in the entire space.

Flames that could burn everything exploded from the souls of these phoenix spirits.

The terrifying flames directly turned the space of about 100,000 meters into nothingness.

The mountains and the ground sank thousands of meters, turning into a land of glass.

“She used her life as bait and wanted me to get close to her. What a terrifying fellow!”

Shangguan Siming murmured with a pale face.

He looked at his charred body.

If he had the intent of killing, he would have been burnt to ashes by now after the spear pierced through the lady.

After throwing the spear with all his might, he immediately retreated.

Then, the scene just now happened.

Shangguan Siming retreated nearly ten thousand meters again. The phoenix spirits were no longer as orderly as before.

Jue Wu also fainted on the ground. Her blood stained the glass-like ground.

But even so, Shangguan Siming had no intention of getting close.

Break the illusion!

A golden light broke through the space again.

Bang!

The spear was shattered by a huge force in an instant.

“Auntie Jue Wu, leave the rest to me! I’ve rested enough.”

Chang Mang smashed the spear into pieces.

Looking at the heavily injured Jue Wu, a monstrous rage exploded in his mind.

This extreme anger even temporarily suppressed the pain in his body.

In an instant, dozens of golden rainbows arrived.

He couldn’t dodge such a fast speed.

Chang Mang slapped the air in front of him, blocking the dozens of spears.

The violent tremor pushed his entire body hundreds of meters away.

He was once again severely injured. His eyes had a hint of gloominess.

However, Shangguan Siming had no intention of approaching him.

He was cautious and terrifyingly strong.

Chang Mang was once one of the four leaders of the Guardian of Order, so he had heard many rumors about Shangguan Siming.

To be able to establish the number one faction in this ancient Saint Kingdom, the strength of this native could only be said to be unfathomable.

Shangguan Siming had personally recruited him. Even at his peak condition, Chang Mang had no confidence in winning, let alone in his current condition.

“Little Chang Mang, you must die here today for the sake of this phoenix spirit inheritance.”

Shangguan Siming revealed a strange smile.

He thought Chang Mang wasn’t that much of a threat compared to Jue Wu.

Chang Mang shattered another spear that was coming at him.

He knew that he couldn’t wait any longer. If this continued, he would collapse very soon.

Placing Jue Wu on his back, he once again smashed down three spears with all his might.

His left arm emitted a loud bone-cracking sound. This time, the power had increased by nearly three times.

Chang Mang’s body was a little cold. This person had been holding back.

He suddenly straightened his arm.

Wind Step!

The next moment, he stepped into the air and dashed toward Shangguan Siming.

Heaven Suppression Pagoda, Heaven Punishing Palm!

With a single palm strike, the sky and earth seemed to be crashing towards Shangguan Siming.

In that short contact moment, Shangguan Siming had borrowed the force to retreat at an even faster speed. In that instant, Chang Mang’s explosive speed could not catch up to him at all.

Chang Mang panted heavily and he abruptly halted his movements.

“Stop struggling. Your current role is to lure Qin Yu out.”

Shangguan Siming stopped at a place that Chang Mang couldn’t reach. A smile appeared on his face.

“Old dog, you’re cunning.”

Chang Mang revealed a sinister smile.

Shangguan Siming burst forth at full speed again, but he was not chasing after Chang Mang this time.

Flee! The more flustered he was, the more flaws he would reveal. It was best to leave this place where the Divine Phoenix Race had fallen.

He wasn’t just boasting. He was confident in killing Chang Mang.

However, this place gave him a sense of danger. Mount Wuting, the ruins of the Divine Phoenix Race, probably had some terrifying power.

Shangguan Siming felt that he could never be too careful when it came to the power of that battlefield.

Heaven Punishing Palm!

Suddenly, his face darkened.

Unknowingly, Chang Mang had arrived at the Guardian of Order’s branch.

Under the cover of a terrifying power, none of the people inside survived. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“F*ck you old dog Shangguan, come and beat me up if you dare!”

Chang Mang laughed loudly, but his voice sounded a little hollow.

The blood was mixed in his windpipe, making his voice a little turbid.

He turned around again and rushed towards the other branch.

Chang Mang’s speed was relatively slow, but only for Shangguan Siming.

At this moment, Chang Mang did not care about his injuries. The power of the four Boundless Hearts of Saint Kingdom entered his body.

In the blink of an eye, he could travel 10,000 meters.

Thus, Chang Mang had already destroyed four branches in a short time. Everyone there had died.
