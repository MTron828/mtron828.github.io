2178 The Heavenly Tribulation of True Saint!

Countless ethnic groups coexisted, each rising in their own way.

It was an unprecedented great era. Every heaven’s favorite resembled a shining star, each emitting its own light.

They were both fortunate and unfortunate, as cultivation was like a great wave washing away the sand. Countless heaven’s favorites had become stepping stones for others and forever disappeared in this starry sky. They did not even leave a trace behind and were slowly forgotten.

In these ten years, Qin Yu’s name was gradually forgotten. Many people had completely forgotten the history of Qin Yu’s appearance.

The Holy Region was gradually no longer an independent entity. The door to the starry sky that had been silent for many years was eventually opening in this great era.

It was unknown whether it was because of the opening by Qin Yu or the change in the rules of heaven and earth. In conclusion, the door opened on its own.

Many cultivators chose to step into the starry sky to seek new opportunities. Other ethnic groups also entered the Holy Region. The Holy Region, which had been turbulent since the beginning, became even more lively and chaotic.

Qin Yu had been immersed in cultivation in the void for decades and was completely unaware of the changes in the outside world. He was still focused on his cultivation, doing his best to blend into the void, hoping to escape this place after reaching the True Saint Realm.

Time flew and passed by in a blink of an eye.

When Qin Yu opened his eyes again, 50 years had passed in the outside world!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the surrounding void and then raised his finger, trying to calculate time.

Although Qin Yu could not deduce the exact changes in time, he did a rough estimate.

“The cultivation this time… actually took several decades…” Qin Yu only felt his hair stand on end and a little uneasy in his heart!

But soon, Qin Yu calmed down.

He could feel the surging true essence in his body and the near True Saint internal qi. This made Qin Yu’s uneasiness gradually turn into excitement.

“It’s time to step into True Saint Realm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He was a little excited because he had seen Wu Ji enter the True Saint Realm when he was comprehending the Traceless Immortal Scripture,

At True Saint Realm, Wu Ji was nearly invincible. No one in the same realm could compete with him. He almost killed all the True Saints he encountered in an instant, who did not have any ability to resist.

Even though Wu Ji had only encountered True Saints whose internal qi had withered, it somehow showed how terrifying Wu Ji was.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and lightly clenched his fists.

He sat cross-legged, his body upright, resembling a towering mountain standing in the void. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, immersing himself in the tranquility of his heart.

As he breathed, the surrounding void began to tremble. Powerful energy gradually condensed around Qin Yu’s body. The energy gave off a majestic aura and surged like a tidal wave.

Eventually, a mysterious light began to appear around Qin Yu’s body. The light flowed like flowing water, and every ray of light contained boundless power and wisdom.

Under the illumination of the light, the void began to change subtly. Countless stars flickered in the void. The starlight surged like a tide, and the scene looked solemn and spectacular.

An invisible energy fluctuation gradually rose from Qin Yu’s body, resembling a towering mountain peak between heaven and earth. His body emitted a powerful internal qi that seemed to be able to shake the entire universe.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes were full of determination and resolve. He felt the true essence in his body expand and surge, and every drop of it contained incomparably formidable power.

Along with the breakthrough in his cultivation, Qin Yu’s internal qi became even more condensed. It surged over like a huge wave, causing the wind and clouds in the heavens and earth to change. His body was gradually immersed in a mysterious atmosphere as if it had some incredible resonance with the power of the universe. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, the entire world seemed to have fallen silent as if welcoming Qin Yu’s breakthrough. The void was full of energy fluctuations he emitted. It was as if the power of the True Saint Realm had been brewing in Qin Yu’s body.

“Buzz!”

An ear-piercing sound reverberated in the void. Along with this sound, a tremendous strange scene suddenly appeared in the sky above Qin Yu!

A sky seemed to have suddenly appeared, and it was flickering with tremendously strange colors!

Above Qin Yu, a strange and incredibly terrifying sky appeared.

The sky was full of terrifying scenes that made people shudder as if they were in a nightmarish situation!

There was no sunlight in the sky but only a tremendously pale moon hanging.

This moon was abnormally gigantic and had no light. It emitted a cold internal qi like the embodiment of death and despair.

The moonlight was not in bright silver but rather a translucent pale hue. It resembled a layer of frost enveloping the entire sky.

Strange-shaped dark clouds floated in the sky, condensing into various eerie forms that sent shivers down the spine.

Some dark clouds were like giant skulls, with blood-red light flashing in their eyes. Some were like ferocious demonic beasts, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws as if they were about to pounce on the world at any moment. There were also dark clouds emitting a strong rotting internal qi, like corpses piling up for a long time.

From these dark clouds, spine-chilling roars were occasionally heard while dim flashes of lightning intermittently flickered.

Thunder intertwined among the dark clouds, emanating a terrifying roar like the entire world was trembling.

The lightning streaked across the sky, reflecting a ghastly scene that reminded people of the cursed ghosts wandering in the darkness.

There were also some strange light spots in the sky. They flickered in the darkness and emitted green, purple, blood-red, and other strange lights!

These light spots were like evil eyes in the void, watching the mortals’ every move and emitting evil power!

Under this terrifying sky, Qin Yu felt endless fear and pressure as if countless demons were wandering around him!

Under this terrifying sky, there was a dense internal qi of death. which was suffocating. It was as if being immersed in a graveyard, and the presence of decay and coldness could even be felt between breaths.

The demons in the sky kept roaring. They seemed to be able to sense Qin Yu’s existence and frantically tried to break through the dark clouds and pounce on him. The demons’ bodies distorted and changed. Some looked like ferocious Demonic Beasts, while others had human forms. However, their faces were distorted and ferocious, without any traces of humanity!

“Such a heavenly tribulation?” Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

As expected, there was no way to avoid the heavenly tribulation, even in the depths of the void!

The heavenly tribulation of breaking through to the True Saint Realm was obviously even more terrifying. Such a scene was not like a normal heavenly tribulation at all!

“Could it be that the dao technique is a demon?” Qin Yu teased.

The strange sky seemed to have understood Qin Yu’s words and instantly became even more ferocious.
