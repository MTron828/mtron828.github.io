Chapter 1165: Chapter 1,165, star picking 

“Go Out? Now? Gu Xinghe will definitely look for you all over the world,”Yan Yongfu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Yongfu, then said, “It’s just right. You can compare it with me. Can I fight with Gu Xinghe Now?”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and walked into the courtyard.

Yan Yongfu was stunned for half a second, then quickly chased after him.

After walking into the courtyard, Qin Yu took a deep breath and clenched his fists. The vast spiritual power in his body was surging like an ocean!

His internal Qi was rising rapidly, the entire ground was rumbling, and the hall behind him was trembling!

Yan Yongfu, who was standing at the side, suddenly felt a mountain-like pressure. His spine was almost broken, and it kept pressing down!

“Ah! ! !”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly let out an angry roar, and the internal Qi in his body completely exploded!

The hall behind him finally couldn’t bear it anymore and began to collapse!

Cracks appeared in this mystic realm, and large areas of space began to collapse!

Yan Yongfu turned pale with fright after sensing the incomparably terrifying power in Qin Yu’s body!

He stared at Qin Yu and said in a trembling voice, “This... This is the power of the two combined... it’s too terrifying...”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body had formed a vortex with him at the center due to the powerful airflow.

His long hair, which had not been tidied up for a long time, fluttered in the wind.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Yongfu and asked, “How do you feel?”

Yan Yongfu said with extreme excitement, “Qin Yu, with your current strength, you are no longer weaker than the Almighty Realm! Terrifying, too terrifying! Even when I was at my peak, I’m afraid I still have to weigh it!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and continued to ask, “Compared to Gu Xinghe?”

Yan Yongfu could not help but frown slightly when this topic was brought up.

He said in a low voice, “After all, Gu Xinghe has absorbed the power of the eight of us. He’s no longer someone that an ordinary mighty figure can compare to. Although you’re very strong now, compared to Gu Xinghe, I’m afraid... You’re still a little lacking.”

Qin Yu was not too surprised, as if he had already expected this.

“It doesn’t matter. I haven’t used the ‘fighting’formula yet,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

After saying that, Qin Yu prepared to activate the ‘fighting’formula.

At this time, Yan Yongfu hurriedly stopped Qin Yu. He shook his head and said, “The fifth level of the ‘fighting’formula can bring you a tens of times increase in combat strength. My secret realm can’t withstand such a great power. Quickly stop.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “Then do you think that if I use the fighting word formula, I can defeat him?”

This time, Yan Yongfu didn’t hesitate at all.

He smiled and said, “After using the fighting word formula, you will definitely be able to defeat him.”

“That’s enough,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Take me out.”

Yan Yongfu originally didn’t want to leave this mystical realm, but he also wanted to see Qin Yu’s true strength after absorbing Yan Ruoxue’s blood.

Therefore, after hesitating for a long time, Yan Yongfu decided to take the risk and travel together.

The two of them walked to the entrance of the mystic realm, and Yan Yongfu used the secret key to open the mystic realm.

Accompanied by flashes of light, the two of them walked out of the mystic realm.

Qin Yu looked around, and the uneasiness grew stronger.

“Where are We Going?”Yan Yongfu asked.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “We’re going to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion First.”

Most of his close friends and relatives were in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. The most important thing right now was to ensure that they were safe.

The two of them didn’t say anything more and rushed toward the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

In just a few days, Gu Xinghe’s hands were still stained with countless human lives. He was even called the devil of the current era.

Gu Xinghe didn’t feel ashamed of this title. On the contrary, he was quite proud.

“Uncle Zhai Xing, do you think I will leave my name in History?”Gu Xinghe looked at Zhai Xing and asked faintly.

Zhai Xing did not say anything, but his expression became even more unsightly.

Gu Xinghe snorted and said, “If you weren’t too soft-hearted, Qin Yu would have died long ago.”

“Today, I will change this bad habit of yours!”

After saying that, Gu Xinghe lowered his head and looked at a market.

There were many people gathered in this market, both martial artists and ordinary people.

And this was also Gu Xinghe’s new target for today.

He put his hands behind his back and then pointed below, saying, “Uncle Zhai Xing, I’ll leave this market to you. Use your star picking hand to kill them.”

Zhai Xing’s expression changed. He gritted his teeth and said, “I won’t do that.”

“You won’t?”Gu Xinghe raised his brows and then sneered, “If you don’t make a move, I’ll kill you.”

Zhai Xing angrily said, “Then just kill me! Even if you cut me into pieces, I’ll never do such a Thing!”

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and coldly said, “Zhai Xing, don’t be so shameless. As long as you do as I say, you’ll still be the number two figure in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“F * ck you! What number two figure? Do you think I Care!”Zhai Xing roared, almost on the verge of breaking down.

At this point, a powerful internal Qi suddenly erupted from Zhai Xing’s body!

On his fingers, it was dyed with a radiance that was as bright as the stars.

This was Zhai Xing’s famous technique, the star picking hand!

“Not bad, this is more like it.”Gu Xinghe nodded his head in satisfaction.

He placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “If I continue to slap you like this, you’ll be the number two figure of the martial arts association of Jingdu, ranked above Su Qi!”

The radiance on Zhai Xing’s hand grew stronger and stronger, as if all of his internal Qi was concentrated on his fingers! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Just as Gu Xinghe was feeling satisfied, Zhai Xing suddenly looked coldly at Gu Xinghe.

“Gu Xinghe, go to hell!”

Zhai Xing roared, Zhai Xing hand suddenly slapped at Gu Xinghe!
