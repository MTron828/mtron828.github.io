Chapter 2585: The Seeds Brought into the Saint Kingdom

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi- Bo Stud io

However, from what the village chief had said, he now had a general understanding of the advancement system here.

Everything in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom seemed to have a trajectory but was also traceless.

It forced you to fight, but it helped you to skip the time of cultivation, such as tempering your body. It seemed to be forcing you to become stronger sooner.

If Ji Tianming continued to strengthen his sense of smell and found something that could intimidate various wild beasts, his direction would definitely be tremendously terrifying.

Imagine, if he was the only one who remained unattacked by the potent herd, who else could resist him?

If he had not met Qin Yu, and the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could see the items on his body clearly, he would have been invincible. “Village Chief, you haven’t told me how to advance!”

Qin Yu came back to his senses and quickly asked.

At this moment, the shabby village chief resumed ignoring Qin Yu no matter how he called out to him.

“Again?”

Qin Yu cursed. At this moment, the village chief sneakily looked around wretchedly.

He suddenly stretched his neck and slithered to another house like a snake. It was actually a latrine.

The woman with an exaggeratedly big buttock was exerting force as if she was constipated.

Qin Yu was speechless. This village chief’s aesthetic standards were really ridiculous, even abnormal.

The village chief seemed to have pointed out the key to his advancement. After rewarding him, he immediately returned to his previous state.

Qin Yu carefully thought about what the village chief had said just now. There was only one key that he could advance.

He eliminated the first and second, and the fourth was too hard. He had tried using the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze but could not even see a trace of rules.

He only had the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, the bloodline inheritance, to improve.

He had an idea now, but he had to verify it.

“It’s already the agreed time, but Ji Tianming hasn’t returned yet. It seems that something has happened. ”

An old woman frowned slightly. At this moment, she was standing in the dark forest, but her skin had a layer of strange luster like a light reflection of metal.

She pinched a peach blossom branch with two fingers. Walking past a dying wolf, she casually snapped its neck.

“You still want to escape?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Her body moved and caught up to the person who was trying to escape. She then pierced his head with a branch.

“Hua Qianje, we’re all human beings, and our sect’s brothers and sisters have saved you. Why are you treating us like this?”

A green-veiled woman shouted angrily.

“I remember your name is Shen Rou, and you are also a cultivator of the Divine Will Sect who has cultivated for many years. How can you say such a ridiculous thing?”

Hua Qianjie walked forward with a smile and killed all the dying beasts on the ground.

The seven outsiders around her stared at her with incomparable anger. These dying beasts on the ground were all caused by their desperate efforts, but they did not even have the right to take the final blow.

If they did so, they would immediately die. This time, they would completely disappear from the divine kingdom.

“Fortunately, Revered Qi made a great effort to leave two seeds in my soul. Otherwise, I would have been completely destroyed the first time I faced that spirit. ”

Thinking of that ferocious spirit, even Hua Qianje felt her body tremble.

Killing the spirit had helped Hua Qianje gain an advantage.

She did not waste Revered Qi’s seeds and quickly used this advantage to expand her current strength.

She controlled people to open up the vision of this area. Regardless of outsiders of the human race or other races, they all became her pawns. She only needed to sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor.

“If we continue to let her enslave us like this, we will also die. We might as well fight her with all our might!”

Another Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect’s disciple roared angrily and rushed toward Hua Qianje, disregarding everything.

“Junior Sister! Junior Brother! Run!”

Shen Qian and the other person ran away in different directions without hesitation.

A sharp sound of piercing sky sounded. The peach blossom branch in Hua Qianje’s hand seemed to have become a whip.

The bones in the disciple’s throat made a crisp sound, and then his head drooped down weakly.

She then broke off two finger-thick twigs from the peach blossom branch. She twisted her body and used the strength of her arms to throw the two twigs out.

The thumb-sized tree twigs shot out like an arrow. What terrified the other five was that the two twigs actually let out a soft rumbling sound. If it hadn’t reached a certain level of strength, it wouldn’t have been able to make such a sound.

This power should have belonged to them but was stolen by Hua Qianje.

The head of a Divine Will Sect disciple who was 30 meters away was pierced through. Shen Rou’s body paused for a moment, but she was not fatally injured.

“Forget it. She’s going to die anyway. That’s the territory of the bear tribe. It’s just that Black Bear King doesn’t have the confidence to win for the time being. ”

Hua Qianjie shook his head and ignored Shen Rou, who was limping away. She had more important things to do. At this moment, she sneered and looked at everyone.

“Is there anyone else who wants to resist? It was inevitable to form a group in this Kingdom of Saint. I exchanged my life for my strength. Here, I leave a spark of hope for you. Kill five and leave one alive. Perhaps you can find the Heart of the Holy Kingdom on these demonic beasts. At that time, you might even be able to kill me.”

Hua Qianjie sneered at the other five persons.

“If you want to die, I don’t mind sending you off now. There are many outsiders in this world. If you don’t want to die, then continue to move forward. Remember, the limit is 200 meters away from me. If you exceed this distance, you will die!”

The surrounding people trembled. They looked at each other bitterly and then continued to open the way silently.

“Hua Qianje, you’re really a genius. No wonder Revered Qi thinks so highly of you and even gave you two seeds.”

Ni Fei, the Supreme Elder of the Ni family, nodded. Hua Qianje’s methods were indeed impressive.

She did not exhaust all resources for her own benefit; instead, she gave a spark of hope to these people. This was how they could possess such incredible power in just six days.

“Same here. We are both people chosen by Revered Qi. You should also be bestowed a seed by Revered Qi, right? However, I don’t understand what you are waiting for.”

Hua Qianjie stared at Ni Qian with killing intent in her eyes.

“Hua Qianje, mind your own business. What Revered Qi can give you can be taken back at any time. As for what I’m waiting for, it’s not for you to ask.”

The Ni family’s Supreme Elder said calmly, not afraid of the old woman in front of him at all.

“Of course. It’s just that Elder Ni is so wary of me. It’s really disappointing.”

Hua Qianjie smiled calmly as if she was talking to an old friend..
