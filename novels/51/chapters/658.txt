This internal Qi couldn’t help but make Qin Yu’s hair stand on end!

Indeed, the lively and cute look on Xiao Yu had been replaced by an icy coldness.

“Qin Yu?!”

The moment she saw Qin Yu, Xiao Yu immediately pounced over.

She pounced into Qin Yu’s embrace and said, “I knew you wouldn’t die...”

Qin Yu patted Xiao Yu’s head and said with a smile, “Don’t worry. It won’t be that easy for me to die.”

Uncle Wu sighed and said, “This child isn’t that close to me anymore. Can’t help it that she has gotten older.”

Qin Yu sized up Xiao Yu. After not seeing her for a long time, she had grown a lot taller and more mature.

“Xiao Yu, that mask... did you lose it?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

“Of course not!” Xiao Yu said.

She pulled Qin Yu and said, “Come with me.”

Qin Yu followed Xiao Yu and came to her room.

Then, she took out the mask from a small locked cabinet.

Sure enough, this mask was the one that the masked woman wore!

“I don’t know why, but as long as I wear this mask, I feel a little strange,” Xiao Yu said while stroking the mask.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Strange?”

“Yes, it’s like memories that don’t belong to me are flooding into my brain. It’s very uncomfortable.” Xiao Yu wrinkled her nose.

As she spoke, she put the mask on her face.

The moment she put it on, Qin Yu subconsciously took two steps back.

It was so similar, it was exactly the same!

There was definitely a special relationship between Xiao Yu and the masked woman!

“What’s wrong?” Seeing Qin Yu’s terrified look, Xiao Yu took off the mask.

Qin Yu quickly shook his head and said cautiously, “Xiao Yu, this mask is extraordinary. Remember, you must not tell anyone, or your life will be in danger, understand?”

Xiao Yu stammered, “I know...”

Seeing her expression, Qin Yu had a bad premonition.

“You... did you tell someone else?” Qin Yu said with some fear.

“No.” Xiao Yu quickly shook her head.

Qin Yu was still worried, but no matter how he asked, Xiao Yu denied it.

“Xiao Yu, I’m doing this for your own good. You must take good care of this mask, understand?” Qin Yu urged.

Xiao Yu nodded and said, “I understand. Don’t worry.”

Qin Yu grunted and didn’t say anything else.

“It’s getting late. I can’t stay here for too long, so I’ll leave first. I’ll come and see you again when I have time,” Qin Yu said as he patted Xiao Yu’s head.

Xiao Yu looked a little disappointed, but she still nodded and didn’t say anything else.

After walking out of the room, Uncle Wu pulled Qin Yu to the side.

He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Xiao Yu, that child, may have developed strange feelings for you. You...”

“Uncle Wu, don’t joke around. I’ve always treated Xiaoyu as my younger sister.” Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand.

Uncle Wu opened his mouth and then said with a wry smile, “Alright. Qin Yu, be careful.”

Qin Yu nodded and turned around to leave.

Qin Yu had planned to visit Jiang Gu and the others, but the situation had changed so he left Chuzhou directly afterward.

At the Saint Confucian sect in Cang City.

A huge statue stood in the center of the square. It was a statue of Deng Sheng.

The person himself was in Zhen Yue’s boudoir. Deng Sheng was putting his hand on Zhen Yue’s thigh. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Zhen Yue, you should know the current situation. The Green Moon Villa no longer exists. Only the Saint Confucianism sect exists now,” Deng Sheng said with a smile.

There was a bit of disgust on Zhen Yue’s face, but she didn’t do anything too extreme.

Obviously, this wasn’t the first time Deng Sheng came to talk to Zhen Yue.

“Deng Sheng, Mr. Qin isn’t dead. When he comes back, you’ll be dead for sure,” Zhen Yue said with a cold face.

Deng Sheng couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. “So what if Qin Yu isn’t dead? He’s too arrogant and has caused too many troubles!”

“Now that everyone from all walks of life is catching him, do you think he’ll have a chance to come back?”

Zhen Yue sneered when she heard this. “Mr. Qin has always escaped death, and this time is no exception.”

These words undoubtedly aroused fear in Deng Sheng’s heart. He said with a bit of anger from embarrassment, “B*tch, I was talking to you nicely. Do you really think you’re that important?”

“I’m telling you today. If you want to live, you have to listen to me! Be my canary and you will enjoy more happiness. Otherwise, I’ll make you a plaything for everyone in the Saint Confucian sect!”

“You should know that many people in the Saint Confucian sect want to play with you!” Deng Sheng said sinisterly.

Zhen Yue glared at Deng Sheng and then spat on his face.

Deng Sheng narrowed his eyes. He suddenly grabbed Zhen Yue’s hair and said fiercely, “Shameless woman! I’ll make you suffer today!”

Then, he pulled Zhen Yue by her hair and dragged her out of the door.

This pervert was planning to play with Zhen Yue in front of everyone from the Saint Confucian sect!

He dragged Zhen Yue’s hair and strode out of the hall.

However, just as he reached the door, he bumped into a steel-like body.

He looked up and saw Qin Yu looking at Deng Sheng coldly.

Deng Sheng was stunned at first, then he staggered backward and fell on his butt.

“Qin... Qin Yu!” Deng Sheng’s face was full of fear!

Qin Yu looked at Deng Sheng coldly and said, “Bastard, I shouldn’t have let you live in the first place!”

After saying that, Qin Yu suddenly kicked Deng Sheng’s lower abdomen.

This kick was extremely powerful and directly sent Deng Sheng flying.

His body shattered the hall, and the entire hall instantly buzzed.

Deng Sheng spat out a mouthful of blood from the corner of his mouth. He got up from the ground and turned around to run.

But in front of Qin Yu, how could he escape.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu grabbed him by the neck and dragged him to the square like a dead dog.

Such a big commotion naturally alarmed countless people.

All of a sudden, everyone from the Saint Confucian sect gathered here.

Countless people looked at the scene in front of them and exclaimed, “Qin... Qin Yu! He’s back!”

Zhen Yue exclaimed, “Mr. Qin, everyone is looking for you outside. You... You better run!”

Qin Yu glanced at Zhen Yue and didn’t explain.

He had to keep a high profile. Otherwise, how could he attract the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Qin Yu carried Deng Sheng and strode toward the center of the square.

Deng Sheng gritted his teeth. He wanted to escape quietly, but Qin Yu only raised his hand and broke Deng Sheng’s legs.

Qin Yu threw Deng Sheng to the ground and glanced at the crowd coldly. He said word by word, “I, Qin Yu, am not dead, and I will not die in the future.”

“This place is called Green Moon Villa, not Saint Confucian sect. Whoever dares to betray Zhen Yue will end up like Deng Sheng.”

Deng Sheng opened his mouth and wanted to beg for mercy, but Qin Yu didn’t give him a chance to speak.

Qin Yu raised his palm and smashed Deng Sheng’s head into pieces.

The bloody scene made everyone’s face change drastically, and they kept stepping back.
