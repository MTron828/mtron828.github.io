Pavilion Master’s words caused the Third Elder’s expression to turn extremely ugly.

He had never expected Pavilion Master to have such an attitude!

Not only did she not punish Qin Yu, but she even stripped him of his position as an Elder!

“Pavilion Master, with the Third Elder abdicating, I think Qin Yu is a good choice!” the Fifth Elder seized this opportunity and quickly said.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Not everyone can be the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“Pavilion Master, Qin Yu has Blue Spirit Fire! And I personally saw him refine a pill with his hands!” the Fifth Elder said excitedly.

The Pavilion Master frowned slightly. After a moment of silence, she said indifferently, “We can give him a chance.”

“Thank you, Pavilion Master!” The Fifth Elder was beyond excited!

And the Third Elder was enraged!

This was simply too infuriating!

The Pavilion Master didn’t stay any longer and turned around to leave the square.

After she left, everyone also surrounded her and congratulated Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, Congratulations!”

“What is your relationship with the Pavilion Master? Why is she so biased towards you?”

“That’s right, I’ve never seen the Pavilion Master so easygoing!”

In fact, not only were they suspicious, even Qin Yu himself felt puzzled.

The Pavilion Master’s attitude was indeed somewhat abnormal.

“Qin Yu, you won’t be complacent for too long!” Third Elder said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “As expected, a good-for-nothing is a good-for-nothing. You’ve already been demoted, so do you still have the nerve to stay here?”

“That’s right. If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to stand this.” Yao Qing also muttered.

The Third Elder gritted his teeth. He snorted coldly and turned around to leave.

After that, Qin Yu didn’t stay here any longer.

He went to the Elders’ residence with the Fifth Elder.

It could be seen that the Fifth Elder was quite fond of Qin Yu.

The Fifth Elder was even happier than Qin Yu himself over the fact that Qin Yu could become an Elder.

“Qin Yu, tell me, do you know the Pavilion Master?” The Fifth Elder asked carefully.

Qin Yu shook his head and said with a wry smile, “I’ve never seen her before.”

“That’s really strange,” The Fifth Elder muttered.

“She is willing to offend the Han family for you? It’s really unbelievable.”

Although Qin Yu had doubts inside, he didn’t think much about it.

Perhaps it was because the Pavilion Master had taken a fancy to his talent.

“Qin Yu, prepare yourself. If you want to become an Elder, you have to go through an assessment.” the Fifth Elder stood up and said.

He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Didn’t you say that you don’t want to stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion all the time? As long as you become an Elder, you can come and go as you please. Moreover, your salary will be much higher than before.”

“Really?” Qin Yu said with some pleasant surprise.

“Of course.” the Fifth Elder said with a nonchalant smile.

Originally, Qin Yu didn’t have much ambition towards the position of Elder. But after hearing the Fifth Elder’s words, Qin Yu immediately changed his mind.

After the Fifth Elder left, Qin Yu began to search for the pill formula.

In order to ensure that he could pass the test, Qin Yu planned to refine a Nine Transformation Golden Pill!

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion didn’t lack herbs. A Nine Transformation Golden Pill was enough to pass the test.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that it was an unfamiliar number from Jingdu.

Qin Yu looked at the phone number and thought for a moment before picking up the call.

“Qin Yu, you’re really audacious!” As soon as the call was picked up, he heard a hoarse roar!

Although the voice wasn’t familiar, Qin Yu quickly guessed the other party’s identity.

“Han Wei?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and pressed the recording button.

Han Wei said coldly, “You actually crippled the dantian of a Han family member in public! Qin Yu, you’re really too brazen!”

Qin Yu curled his lips and said, “Don’t be anxious and don’t be jealous. In another half a year, I will also cripple yours.”

“You!” Han Wei was so angry that he was fuming. He couldn’t suppress his anger! His phone was about to shatter from his tight grasp!

“Qin Yu, let me tell you. It’s no longer a grudge between us. It’s between you and the entire Han family!” Han Wei said coldly.

“Do you have anything else to say? If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first. I still have to cultivate properly and wait to kill you,” Qin Yu said impatiently.

Han Wei suppressed his anger and said sullenly, “Let’s see how long you can be arrogant. Don’t think that I really won’t dare to do anything to you!”

Qin Yu immediately said in surprise, “Mr. Han, are you threatening me? Are you afraid of me? Don’t we have a half-year agreement?”

Han Wei sneered and said, “This agreement is only valid if I accept it. If I don’t accept it, then it’s bullsh*t! Do you really think that I care about those lowlifes on the Martial Arts Forum?”

“Tsk, the young masters of aristocratic families really have a sense of superiority. If you want to, then bring it on.” Qin Yu snorted coldly.

Han Wei gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, let me tell you, as long as I...”

Before Han Wei could finish his harsh words, a beeping sound came from the phone.

“This b*stard actually dared to hang up on me! I want to kill him! I want to kill him!” Han Wei’s eyes were widened with rage as he raised his head and roared angrily!

On the other end, Qin Yu couldn’t help but touch his chin after he hung up the phone.

“It seems that this agreement has very little binding force on Han Wei. It’s time to add fuel to the flames,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu recorded the conversation with Han Wei and made a simple cut. Then, he called the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association’s reporter, Li Ruodan.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu quickly revealed his identity.

Li Ruodan said excitedly, “Mr. Qin? Why are you calling me?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I have a recording here. It’s breaking news. Do you want it?”

“Breaking news? Of course I want it!” Li Ruodan said excitedly.

“Okay, I’ll send it to you later.” Qin Yu hung up the phone.

Then, Qin Yu sent the edited recording to Li Ruodan.

After Li Ruodan listened to the recording, she immediately replied to Qin Yu excitedly, “Mr. Qin, this news will definitely be more sensational than the previous one. Thank you so much! If there’s a chance, I’ll definitely treat you to a meal!”

Qin Yu didn’t reply.

He believed that this recording would definitely put pressure on the Han family.

Even if they were one of the top ten most powerful families, they definitely wouldn’t be able to do whatever they wanted.

Although Qin Yu’s methods were somewhat despicable, in order to protect himself, there was no other way.

...

The next day, this news was released on the Martial Arts Forum.

As Qin Yu expected, this news quickly blew up the entire Martial Arts Forum!

When Han Wei said “A bunch of lowlifes on the Martial Arts Forum” , it ignited the anger of the people!

“The Han family is too arrogant. They actually said that we are lowlifes?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“What is he pretending for? Who is he scolding?!”

“Looks like this big family isn’t that powerful. They are actually afraid of Qin Yu? Otherwise, why would they threaten us?”

“The Han family is only so-so.”

Countless comments quickly spread.

And when Han Wei saw the news on the Martial Arts Forum, he was so angry that his entire body trembled!

“Despicable! Shameless!” Han Wei grabbed his phone and slammed it on the ground!

At this moment, the butler walked in from outside.

He said carefully, “Young Master, the Master wants to see you...”
