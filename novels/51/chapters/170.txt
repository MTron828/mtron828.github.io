Chapter 171: Do You Take Me for a Fool? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu looked over and saw that these words came from the mouth of an extremely well-dressed young man.

“Of course, you are Young Master Jiang.”

“No matter how capable Qin Yu is, he wouldn’t dare to go against the Jiang family.”

“Young Master Jiang, let me toast you with a cup of wine!”

Qin Yu shook his head and didn’t think too much about it.

After all, many young people liked to brag, not to mention that Qin Yu had never seen this “Young Master Jiang” before.

“Mr. Yang, let’s find a place to sit down.” Qin Yu looked at Mr. Yang and said with a smile.

Mr. Yang appeared somewhat ill at ease. He had never participated in such an occasion before, so he naturally couldn’t let loose.

The two of them found a relatively remote place to sit down. They drank the fine wine on the table while eating delicious food very happily.

At this moment, Wei Ming suddenly walked over from a short distance away.

When he saw Qin Yu, his expression was extremely awkward.

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin, why are you here?” Wei Ming said somewhat awkwardly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Wu brought me here. Perhaps he wants me to expand my network. What’s wrong?”

“No... nothing.” Wei Ming hurriedly shook his head.

Then, he simply sat next to Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take you to look for herbs now. Look at how boring this place is,” Wei Ming said with a sheepish smile.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “This place is indeed quite boring, but... it’s too impolite to leave just like that.”

Wei Ming wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Qin Yu with a wave of his hand. He said, “It’s okay. We’re not in a hurry anyway. We’ll go tomorrow.”

Seeing this, Wei Ming couldn’t say anything more and could only sit there uneasily.

Seeing Wei Ming’s attitude, Qin Yu was even more puzzled.

He said jokingly, “You seem to be anxious.”

“No... No, it’s just a little stuffy here,” Wei Ming said as he wiped the sweat off his forehead.

Qin Yu felt more and more suspicious, but he didn’t ask any more questions.

Soon, Mr. Wu came from a short distance away.

Seeing Mr. Wu, Wei Ming quickly got up and greeted, “Greetings, Mr. Wu.”

Mr. Wu nodded to Wei Ming and said, “Wei Ming, why don’t I see your dad?”

Wei Ming said, “My dad has something to do today, so he left first.”

Mr. Wu then looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, let’s go. I’ll bring you to meet someone.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu got up and was about to follow Mr. Wu.

At this time, Wei Ming suddenly shouted, “Mr. Wu! I have something to talk to you about.”

Mr. Wu frowned slightly and said, “Just say what you have to say.”

Wei Ming said awkwardly, “Mr. Wu, can we have some privacy?”

Although Mr. Wu was a little puzzled, he still followed Wei Ming to the side.

After walking far away, Wei Ming whispered, “Mr. Wu, you’d better hurry up and take Qin Yu away.”

“Huh?” Mr. Wu was stunned. “Take Qin Yu away? Why?”

Wei Ming forced a smile and said, “If we don’t leave now, Qin Yu and Jiang Yu might have a conflict.”

“Jiang Yu?” Even Mr. Wu frowned when he heard this name.

“What’s going on?” Mr. Wu asked hurriedly.

Wei Ming immediately told Mr. Wu what happened.

“You also know Qin Yu’s character. Will he let it go?” Wei Ming said with a wry smile.

A grave expression flashed across Mr. Wu’s face.

He couldn’t help but recall the time when he went to see Qin Yu for treatment.

“You’re right.” Mr. Wu took a deep breath.

“This kid from the Jiang family is really going overboard!” Mr. Wu said coldly.

Even though that was the case, Mr. Wu couldn’t do anything about it.

Hence, he turned around and walked back to Qin Yu’s side.

“Qin Yu, I just received a call. There’s something we need to do. Let’s leave quickly,” Mr. Wu said.

Qin Yu felt that something was wrong. He frowned and said, “Mr. Wu, why is it so sudden?”

“It’s an emergency. I can’t explain it to you right now.” Mr. Wu pulled Qin Yu and was about to leave.

Unfortunately, it was too late.

A short distance away, Jiang Yu noticed Qin Yu’s figure and walked over.

“Hey, isn’t this Qin Yu?” Jiang Yu walked in front of Qin Yu in a few steps.

Seeing this young man, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Wasn’t this the kid who badmouthed him behind his back just now? He actually took the initiative to run over and talk to him?

Shouldn’t he avoid him?

“Young Master Jiang.” Wei Ming greeted him with a sheepish smile.

Jiang Yu glanced at Wei Ming and sneered. “Wei Ming, I remember that you and Shen Tian were friends. Why did you ally yourself with Qin Yu?”

Wei Ming, not knowing what to do, smiled embarrassedly.

“Jiang Yu, let’s talk about it another day. Qin Yu and I have something to do,” Mr. Wu said in a sullen voice.

Jiang Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Wu, are you trying to protect Qin Yu? Isn’t Qin Yu supposedly fearless? Why is he so cowardly?”

“Cowardly?” Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I haven’t been cowardly for a long time.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Hahaha!” Jiang Yu couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

He pointed at Mr. Yang and said, “This old fart swallowed your herbs. Why are you still keeping him by your side?”

“Swallowed my herbs?” Qin Yu looked at Mr. Yang in confusion.

Mr. Yang’s face was flushed and he couldn’t say a word.

Jiang Yu sneered. “It seems that you still don’t know. I used a hundred-year-old ginseng to be exchanged for your nine dragon pill, but this old fart took the hundred-year-old ginseng for himself and sold it!”

“Shouldn’t you teach this kind of treacherous person a lesson?” Jiang Yu raised his eyebrows and said.

Mr. Yang’s face immediately flushed red. He shouted angrily, “You’re talking nonsense! It’s clearly...”

“Mr. Yang!” At this moment, Wei Ming suddenly interrupted Mr. Yang’s words.

Then, Wei Ming quickly walked to the middle of the two of them and said with a smile, “Young Master Jiang, don’t joke anymore.”

However, Qin Yu had already noticed that something was wrong. He frowned at Wei Ming and said, “What on earth is going on?”

Wei Ming braced himself and said, “Qin Yu, I’ll explain it to you when we get back.”

“What exactly is going on with that hundred-year-old ginseng?!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little angry.

This feeling of being kept in the dark was very uncomfortable. It reminded him of the three years he had been deceived by Su Yan.

Wei Ming didn’t know how to explain it. He looked extremely uneasy.

“Young Master Jiang is right. I took your ginseng. I sold it.” At this moment, Mr. Yang suddenly braced himself and said.

“Mr. Qin, please punish me.” Mr. Yang sighed.

“Hahaha!” When Jiang Yu saw this scene, he laughed even more happily.

“Qin Yu, what’s the point of keeping such a person? If it were me, I would definitely kill him as soon as possible!” Jiang Yu snorted.

Qin Yu looked at Mr. Yang, and a trace of anger appeared on his face.

A terrifying murderous aura lingered around his body.

“Hurry up and punish him. What are you dawdling for? Do you need my help?” Jiang Yu urged from the side.

“Noisy thing! Do you take me for a fool?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly turned around and slapped Jiang Yu!
