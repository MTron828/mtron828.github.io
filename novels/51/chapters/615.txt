Chapter 616: Bone Refining Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

These two rays of golden light were formed from the purest spiritual energy, and their power could be said to be invincible!

“Boom!”

However, the result was completely different from what Qin Yu had imagined!

The headless brawny man smashed the golden light!

“F * ck!” Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but swear!

Before he could recover, the headless brawny man had already come to his side.

His strong body crashed into Qin Yu’s body.

Even though Qin Yu had the blessing of the Saintly Body Technique, he was still knocked over. The golden light on his body exploded.

Qin Yu crawled up from the ground in pain. He rubbed his chest and felt as if his internal organs had been hit.

That feeling was as though he had been hit by a train!

“What the hell is this...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but exclaim in shock.

Compared to this headless brawny man, even Yan Guiyi’s black-gold stone wasn’t worth mentioning!

“Your chaotic body isn’t that impressive.” Not far away, the man with the mustache said with a beaming smile.

Qin Yu glared at him and said, “Don’t just stand there and talk. Come and try it yourself!”

At this moment, Qin Yu clearly understood the difference in strength between him and this Mighty Realm powerhouse.

Even if he only had a physical body, he was definitely not something a Martial Marquis could contend against.

“Bang!”

The headless brawny man charged toward Qin Yu again. Qin Yu immediately held the bronze sword in his hand and executed the third cut of the Nine Taiqing Slashes!

The huge sword light suddenly appeared out of thin air and passed by the headless brawny man!

“Clang!”

The loud sound was deafening. The sword light slashed across his body, but only left a white mark!

“F * ck...” This made Qin Yu completely flustered.

The third cut of the Nine Taiqing Slashes only left a white mark?

What kind of body was this? Even modern weapons probably couldn’t hurt him, right?

“Run quickly! He’s coming again!” The man with the mustache shouted from afar.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. After thinking for a while, he immediately took out the Venerable Fifth Mountain. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Rumble...”

The Venerable Fifth Mountain appeared out of thin air with a series of rumbling sounds.

With the support of Qin Yu’s spells, the Venerable Fifth Mountain grew larger and larger while hanging above the headless brawny man!

“Suppress!”

Following Qin Yu’s explosive roar, the mountain fiercely suppressed the headless brawny man!

“Boom!”

The mountain lived up to its reputation. It pressed the headless brawny man to the ground!

“Success!” Qin Yu shouted excitedly.

“Rumble...”

But... Before Qin Yu could rejoice, the mountain began to tremble!

In less than half a second, the mountain was sent flying, and the headless brawny man stood up again!

“Oh no!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He had already used all his trump cards, but he was still unable to do anything to the headless brawny man. If this continued, he might really be beaten to death by him!

“Think of a way quickly.” The man with the mustache shouted from afar.

Qin Yu cursed loudly, “I can’t think of a way! This is the body of a Mighty Realm powerhouse, and I’m just a Martial Marquis, so what can I think of?!”

“Then hurry up and run!” The man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any more words with the man with the mustache and immediately ran away.

However, the headless brawny man’s speed was extremely fast. Even if Qin Yu used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch, he couldn’t escape!

In the blink of an eye, the headless brawny man had caught up!

His huge fist was right behind him. That sharp wind was about to split Qin Yu’s body apart!

“It’s over!” Qin Yu’s face turned pale when he felt the terrifying force from this fist!

He didn’t doubt the power of this fist. His physical body wouldn’t be able to withstand it at all!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, runes suddenly flashed above the head of the headless brawny man.

The moment the runes appeared, the headless brawny man instantly became absent-minded. The movements of his hands also stopped abruptly.

That huge fist was only a step away from Qin Yu’s back.

This made Qin Yu break into a cold sweat. His face was even paler.

“I told you to run if you can’t beat him,” the man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu glared at the man with the mustache and scolded, “Since you have a way to deal with him, why didn’t you act earlier!”

“I thought you could beat him!” The man with the mustache said with a smile.

Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead and couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

He raised his head to look at the characters condensed above the brawny man and frowned. “What is this thing? Why is it able to freeze him?”

The man with the mustache spread his hands and said, “This headless brawny man has no soul. He is just a body that is driven by dark energy. This character of mine is a secret technique of Taoism. It can drive away evil spirits.”

Qin Yu was confused when he heard this. Fortunately, he was able to suppress this headless brawny man.

“Is this the body of a Mighty Realm powerhouse?” Qin Yu touched the headless brawny man’s body and said in a deep voice.

“Do you think you can dismember the body of this strong man and stick it to my body?” Qin Yu muttered.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “You’re dreaming. Let’s not talk about whether you can break his body. Even if you can, how can you stick it to your body?”

At this point, the man with the mustache paused for a moment and said with a smile, “But his bones can be used to refine artifacts. Those are the bones of a Mighty Realm powerhouse!”

“That’s right!” Qin Yu also came to a sudden realization.

“If we can take out his bones and refine artifacts, won’t we be invincible in the world?!”

The man with the mustache nodded seriously and said, “Yes, but who can break his body and take out his bones?”

“Anyone who can take out his bones probably won’t need to use his bones to refine weapons.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

That was true. Someone who could take out his bones must be at least at the Mighty Realm powerhouse. Why would he need such a weapon?

“Broken bones!”

This reminded Qin Yu of the skulls on the ground when he first stepped into the hall!

Couldn’t those skulls be used to refine weapons?

And... skulls were the hardest parts of the human body!

“Got it!” Qin Yu said excitedly.

“There are skulls in the hall. Maybe we can try to use them to refine weapons!” Qin Yu said excitedly.

The man with the mustache’s eyes lit up and he hurriedly said, “Really?”

“Absolutely!” Qin Yu nodded seriously.

“Take me there quickly!” The man with the mustache said excitedly.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and immediately ran into the main hall with the man with the mustache.
