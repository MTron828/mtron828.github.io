It was a handsome young man. He dressed up in a clean and simple green robe. At this moment, he was staring at Qin Yu with a smile.

He was the second living being with the normal divine sense that Qin Yu encountered after entering the ghost realm.

“Certainly. If you can take one of my sword strikes, you can quote any price.” Qin Yu sneered and did not wait for his reply.

He directly slashed out the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance. If he could block the attack, it would mean the strength of this ghost race living being was decent, and he could consider collaborating with him.

If he were exterminated directly by the golden sword, he would just absorb his soul memories. He did not have time to play tricks now, and time was a priceless treasure to Qin Yu.

Every once in a while, the Yellow Springs Mark would activate. He had to cherish every minute and second.

“Haha, then I will quote my price.”

The young man did not dodge and allowed the golden soul-shattering divine light to strike his soul. However, the method he used remained unknown. After the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance entered his body, it did not seem to cause any narm to ms soul.

He smiled slightly and arrived in front of Qin Yu in a flash. “The guide fee is 1,000 merit points, to be collected in two days.”

“Alright.”

Qin Yu did not waste time but felt a little pained.

After all, he had just killed the True Saint ghost race and only obtained two merit points.

“Let me remind you, if your merit point is below zero, the mental ability absorbed by the ghost moon will multiply exponentially. In other words, if I accept these 1,000 merit points now, I’m afraid the next time the ghost moon activates, your soul will completely dissipate. Of course, I won’t do that as it doesn’t do me any good.”

The young man smiled faintly.

“What specific purpose does ‘merit’ serve?”

Qin Yu pondered for a moment before asking.

“Merit points can help you avoid the attacks of the ghost moon and can be exchanged for your lost mental ability from the gate of six paths of reincarnation at the end of the netherworld. If you want to get back what you lose, you have to grow stronger, or your soul will be wiped out.”

“Who are you exactly? I feel like I’ve seen you before.”

Qin Yu stared at the young man, trying to find some clues.

“Hahaha, I can be anyone. You only need to remember that this is the ghost realm here, and you just need to follow the rules here.”

As the young man’s body changed, he turned into an ugly half-beast person. With a slight movement, he became a demonic dragon with soaring demonic qi.

Qin Yu frowned but did not continue to probe him.

He spread his divine sense and found the living beings of the ghost realm were hard to count.

Along the way, he could see countless battles. All the battles were fought with a do-or-die determination. There was no such thing as probing.

Was this the way of the ghost realm?

Every realm would filter out the way of the utmost powerful beings in times of Primordial Chaos.

The battle between the human race was even more intense than this situation.

However, no one wanted to experience that chaotic era again.

While he was walking in a hurry, a few hundred unremarkable ghost races came to provoke Qin Yu, and they were all killed by him with a slash.

“His strength is not bad. The living being he has just killed is a ghost general.” The young man smiled faintly. He seemed to know what Qin Yu wanted to ask next and continued to explain.

“The levels of the ghost realm are divided into ghost soldiers, ghost generals, and ghost kings. The ox-headed and horse-faced demons in Hades are all ghost kings. Above them are the Ten Great Yama Kings. The Yama Kings are also categorized into Ten Yama Kings, categorized with three superiors, three intermediates, and four inferior strengths. The Hall of Senluo we just passed by is one of the four inferiors. The ghost generals and above are living beings that already comprehended the ghost realm’s power of the Path of Heaven. It’s similar to the strength of the human world.”

The young man answered Qin Yu’s question with a few words.

“Oh yes, let me remind you. It’s best to use your ghostly power to condense a body and store your soul. Although your soul is tremendously powerful, as time passes in the ghost realm, I’m afraid you can’t resist the speed at which the power of your soul is flowing away.”

Qin Yu nodded. He could use the Northern Underworld Demonic Technique to make up for the power of his soul.

However, the fluctuation was too strong, and he was unwilling to use it in a place where there were many ghost realm living beings.

With a thought, he condensed a body.

At this moment, a massive commotion suddenly broke out in front of them. They were then surrounded by densely packed ghost race living beings. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hahaha, soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals. This is a battle between two formidable ghost generals that you can refer to. Remember, you must not interfere in the battle, or it will cause the backslash of the power of the Path of Heaven.”

The young man reminded Qin Yu and hurriedly squeezed forward. Qin Yu hesitated for a moment before following him. It was indeed as the young man had said.

If it were a battle between ghost generals, they would definitely use the power of the way.

He could observe the power of the ghost race’s sea of the Path of Heaven which was also a good thing for his future cultivation.

On the battlefield, the two ghost races had already collided.

One of the living beings was a demon race. Its condensed body was a dragon.

The demonic dragon’s internal qi was indescribably sharp as if it still carried a portion of its power when it was alive.

Between the attacks, there was also the shadow of the dragon race. It seemed that they had just arrived in the ghost realm not long ago, and their strength should have been tremendously powerful when they were alive.

The other was a human race living being. In terms of strength, he was much weaker than the demonic dragon.

Qin Yu could feel that this human race’s strength should not be considered powerful when he was alive. He had only survived until now by relying on his will and ability.

Eyes of the Netherworld! The demonic dragon’s body emitted intense fluctuations of the way.

After the power of the Path of Heaven was channeled, a ghost eye with endless blood vessels suddenly appeared in the air.

Under its gaze, the attacks of the human living beings had nowhere to hide. Soon, he was severely injured and several vital points were hit by the demonic dragon.

A stream of mental ability was sucked by the ghost moon.

“The Breath of the Yellow Springs!”

He roared angrily.

The power of the Yellow Springs rolled down from his head and covered the entire space.

Immediately, the surrounding living beings retreated frantically for fear of being affected by the Breath of the Yellow Springs.

Suddenly, the demonic dragon let out a shrill cry. The Breath of the Yellow Springs corroded a large part of his soul power like sulfuric acid.

“What a pity! He could actually comprehend the power of the Yellow Springs.

Given more time, his achievements in the ghost realm would be limitless. However, he’s no match for this demonic dragon now.”

The young man unknowingly arrived beside Qin Yu.

As if to confirm his words, a dragon breath was emitted from the demonic dragon’s mouth.

Under the gaze of the Eyes of the Netherworld, it accurately hit the body of the human living being.

In an instant, he let out a shrill scream, and his body instantly melted into pure ghostly qi that dissipated in the air.

In just an instant, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He saw a familiar face in the soul of this human being.

wen Da!

Spiritualization Technique!

In an instant, an enormous stamen wrapped around Wen Da’s soul, blocking the demonic dragon’s attack.

Qin Yu stared at the human race living being with surging emotions, and tears actually welled up in his eyes..
