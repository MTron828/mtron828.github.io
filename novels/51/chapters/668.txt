Chapter 669: Trash Is Trash Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This caused Han Wei’s expression to change drastically!

Qin Yu’s palm was like a pair of iron pincers, tightly grabbing onto Han Wei’s fist!

Even if Han Wei tried his best, he was unable to break free!

“Aren’t you already crippled?!” Han Wei said in terror.

Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

“I am indeed heavily injured and my internal qi is weak. But even so, I am not someone that trash like you can bully.” Qin Yu’s smile was extremely brilliant.

And this brilliant smile traumatized Han Wei!

“Trash is trash. Even if I am heavily injured, you are still not my match.” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

“Let go of me!” Han Wei shouted in horror!

Qin Yu ignored him and said coldly, “You want me to kneel? Are you even worthy!”

Following Qin Yu’s shout, he raised his leg and kicked Han Wei’s calf!

The huge force instantly made Han Wei kneel on the ground with a plop!

Han Wei struggled to get up, but Qin Yu raised his hand and pressed it on Han Wei’s shoulder!

A force instantly came crushing down!

Han Wei only felt that his shoulders were unable to move!

This humiliation made Han Wei’s face and ears turn red!

He originally wanted to humiliate Qin Yu, but not only did he fail, but he was also humiliated by Qin Yu instead!

“How could this be...” Han Wei’s expression was ferocious, and his heart was filled with incomparable pain!

Even if he was facing Qin Yu, who had a weak internal qi, was he unable to retaliate?

How did the ant that he stepped on back then grow to such a state?!

“Didn’t you want me to kneel?” Qin Yu sneered.

“Let go of me!” Han Wei struggled desperately.

“Okay.” Qin Yu let go.

Han Wei seized this opportunity and hurriedly got up. He wanted to escape, but Qin Yu kicked his butt from behind.

Before Han Wei could get up, Qin Yu had already reached out his hand and grabbed Han Wei’s neck, lifting him into the air.

“Didn’t you say that I’m trash? What about now?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Even if my internal qi dissipates, you are still no match for me. Is this your pride? Tsk tsk, which one of us is trash?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said.

The humiliation made Han Wei wish he was dead!

Today, Han Wei had lost all his pride!

Not far away, a trace of surprise flashed across Yan Ruoxue’s face.

She did not expect that Qin Yu had actually grown to such an extent!

“Say it, which one of us is trash?” Qin Yu questioned coldly.

Han Wei struggled with all his might and said, “Let go of me!”

Qin Yu ignored him and raised his hand to slap Han Wei’s face.

This slap was purely physical strength! Even so, the huge force still made Han Wei dizzy!

“Tell me, which one of us is trash?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

Han Wei clenched his teeth and didn’t say a word.

“You don’t want to say it, right? Fine, I’ll hit you until you open your mouth today!” Qin Yu said coldly.

Following that, Qin Yu raised his palm and swung it left and right.

Slapping sounds spread throughout the entire prison. In a short while, Han Wei’s face was swollen from the slap, and blood oozed from the corner of his mouth!

“Don’t... Don’t hit me anymore...”

Finally, Han Wei couldn’t take it anymore.

If this continued, he might really be beaten to death!

“Speak, who’s trash?” Qin Yu sneered.

Han Wei clenched his teeth and braced himself to say, “It’s... It’s me. I’m Trash...”

“Hahahaha!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

He released Han Wei and sneered. “You know your place.”

Han Wei got up from the ground and said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu, just you wait! I won’t let you off!”

After saying that, Han Wei ran away.

However, Qin Yu kicked his leg again, and Han Wei immediately knelt on the ground.

“Since you came to see me, don’t be in a hurry to leave,” Qin Yu sneered. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Han Wei’s expression was extremely ugly, but he didn’t dare to provoke Qin Yu again.

Outside the prison, Xie Qu glanced at his watch and frowned. “It’s been so long. Why isn’t he coming out? Did he get carried away with the torture?”

From Qu Xie’s point of view, he thought Han Wei was torturing Qin Yu.

Thinking of this, Qu Xie opened the prison’s door and walked in.

When he came to Qin Yu’s cell, Qu Xie was stunned.

Looking at Han Wei who was kneeling on the ground, Qu Xie was dumbfounded.

“President Qu, save me!” Han Wei shouted anxiously.

Qu Xie strode in and lifted his hand to drag Han Wei out.

Then, he looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You are not behaving even when you’re locked up here. Qin Yu, you have guts!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You should have thought of the consequences when you let him in.”

The veins on Qu Xie’s forehead twitched. He didn’t expect Han Wei to be so cowardly.

“I want to see how long you can be arrogant!” Qu Xie snorted.

After saying that, Qu Xie turned around and walked out with Han Wei.

Time flew by, and the sky gradually darkened.

In this prison, it was almost impossible to tell day from night. The whole day was a blur.

“Bro, what’s your relationship with Miss Yan?” Someone from another prison asked.

“By the way, why did you get in here?”

“You dare to talk to Qu Xie like that. I admire you!”

Qin Yu had nothing to do, so he began to chat with these people.

Almost all of them were in the Martial Marquis realm.

And they had a common characteristic, which was that they hated the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Qin Yu seized the opportunity. He rolled his eyes and said, “Buddies, if I have a chance to get out, I will definitely think of a way to save all of you!”

“Haha, bro, don’t joke around. We all heard it. I’m afraid you won’t be able to get out,” the person next to him joked.

Qin Yu pretended to sigh and said, “Yes, I’m afraid I’m in trouble this time. But as long as I’m not dead, I still have a chance.”

“If I really get out, I will definitely save all of you!”

No one took it seriously, but they all smiled and said, “Okay, then we will wait for you.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer inside.

The people locked up here were all top-notch people. If there was a chance to let them out, then perhaps he would have the capital to fight against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

At that time, the Green Moon Villa would definitely become the number one sect in the world, unafraid of any aristocratic families!

At this time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association also didn’t expect that Qin Yu would actually win over the hearts of the people in the prison.

In the next few days, Qin Yu got along with this group of people.

And when they heard Qin Yu’s achievements, they were filled with admiration.

While chatting, Qin Yu also secretly inquired about the structure of this prison.

Everyone spoke one after another, clearly explaining the general structure of this prison, including the materials used in this prison.
