Chapter 1126: Chapter 1,126, one finger of the heavens! 

According to Qin Yu’s calculations, a newly-born mighty figure would definitely not be able to display his full strength. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have kept so many strange flowers.

“Fortunately, Tian Zong hasn’t started a massacre yet. Otherwise... the consequences would really be unimaginable.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel some lingering fear.

When a mighty figure displayed his might, even a newly born mighty figure wouldn’t be able to stop him.

Qin Yu looked towards Tian Zong’s residence, his heart faintly filled with the desire to fight.

However, he wasn’t in a hurry to make a move. Instead, he planned to temporarily rest for a day.

During this period of seclusion, Qin Yu was indeed somewhat tired.

He returned to his room and lay on his bed, falling into a deep sleep.

The next morning.

Qin Yu stretched his body and rushed out of the room.

Then, his eyes shot out a sharp light and pointed straight at Tian Zong’s room!

“Hiss!”

The sharp light was like a laser imagination, directly penetrating Tian Zong’s room, brushing Tian Zong’s white hair and ruthlessly hitting the TV!

“Who!”

Yun Long’s face changed greatly and he shouted with vigilance.

Tian Zong’s eyes also narrowed slightly.

He looked in the direction of Qin Yu, and a cold smile could not help but appear on his face.

“Qin Yu, you have finally appeared,”Tian Zong said in a low voice.

“Qin Yu? He’s back? !”Yun Long was instantly overjoyed!

Before Tian Zong left the room, Yun Long had already shot out!

He smashed the wall, and his body emitted a white light. A terrifying killing intent swept through the entire Heaven Gate!

Almost everyone in the Heaven Gate could feel the icy coldness on his body!

“Qin Yu! ! !”Yun long raised his head and roared furiously. His terrifying internal Qi actually shattered the clouds in the sky!

Qin Yu pricked his ears and said with a frown, “What are you shouting for? I’m not deaf.”

Yun Long glared at Qin Yu and said, “I’ve been waiting for you for a long time, you despicable person!”

Qin Yu mocked, “If you’re stupid, don’t blame others for playing with you.”

“You’re courting death!”Yun Long was furious. He waved his hand and a beam of light shot towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s large hand flashed and dispersed the beam of light.

“Let your master come out,”Qin Yu said quietly.

“Qin Yu, I’ve been waiting for you for an entire week.”At this moment, Tian Zong’s figure floated over.

His figure was like a ghost, extremely fast.

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Thank you for being willing to wait for me. In order to repay you, I’ll leave you a complete corpse.”

“What big words,”Tian Zong said coldly.

“I was kind enough to leave you on Cloud Dragon Island, but you stole the strange flowers. Qin Yu, you’re really despicable.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer when he heard this. “Don’t make yourself sound so great. If you didn’t want to kill me, I wouldn’t have come up with this plan. I don’t need more than a hundred strange flowers at all.”

Tian Zong’s face turned cold.

He didn’t expect that his trick would be discovered by Qin Yu.

“No more nonsense. Let’s do it.”The Aura on Qin Yu’s body began to rise.

When Tian Zong sensed the internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body, a trace of surprise could not help but appear on his face.

“No wonder he hasn’t shown himself for so many days. He has gone into seclusion,”Tian Zong said coldly.

His turbid eyes swept across Qin Yu’s body. With one glance, he could see Qin Yu’s current realm. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Middle stage of the Martial Saint Stage? Do you think such a breakthrough would be useful in front of a mighty figure?”Tian Zong could not help but ridicule.

“Let’s give it a try. I don’t know either.”Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

At this moment, Yun long strode forward and berated, “Qin Yu, do you dare to fight with Me!”

“You’re a defeated opponent. Don’t come out and shout.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

“I’ll fight with you, you F * cking idiot!”

At this moment, Chang Mang suddenly stood out!

His body was emitting a scarlet radiance. This radiance seemed to be cast from blood and was extremely terrifying.

Yun Long’s gaze also landed on Chang Mang’s body.

“Kid, I’ve wanted to kill you for a long time...”yun long gnashed his teeth and said.

“Hahaha, then come!”Chang Mang did not waste any more words and clenched his fist and charged at Yun Long!

Qin Yu sized up Tian Zong before him and said, “Let’s not waste any more time.”

Tian Zong’s eyes were filled with a hint of regret.

He sighed slightly and said, “I can tell that you have quite a high prestige among the crowd. It is precisely this kind of prestige that has caused you to be unable to recognize yourself clearly...”

“Do you know that in front of a mighty figure, a martial saint is completely powerless to retaliate!”

Tian Zong suddenly let out an explosive shout. His skinny palm lightly pinched in Qin Yu’s direction.

“Boom!”

The space around Qin Yu seemed to have started to curl up at this moment!

The four walls of the space emitted an extremely great pressure, as if it wanted to crush Qin Yu into minced meat!

Just the following attack was able to compress the space in such a manner. This was sufficient to show how terrifying a mighty figure was!

Qin Yu did not show the slightest hint of panic as he watched the surrounding space collapse.

His pair of black gem-like eyes were emitting battle intent and determination!

“Ha!”

Right at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly let out an angry roar. He abruptly raised both his arms and forcefully pushed open the space that had already collapsed!

“Boom!”

Under the stalemate between both parties, the space seemed to be unable to withstand it anymore. It actually began to collapse and shatter like glass shards, making cracking sounds!

A large pitch-black void appeared in front of everyone!

It seemed to be a black hole that contained mysterious and unfathomable matter and energy!

Before everyone could take a closer look, the collapsed space had already returned to its original state!

Tian Zong wasn’t surprised. He only nodded slightly, a trace of admiration flashing in his eyes.

“You have some ability. Unfortunately, in front of a mighty figure, it’s still not worth mentioning,”Tian Zong said indifferently.

After saying this, Tian Zong raised his hand again. He lifted his hand into the air, then stretched out a finger and gently pressed it down.

Rumble..

A huge finger suddenly appeared from the clouds!

That huge finger pierced through the clouds and came crashing down with a destructive power!

It was like a missile. The power contained within it could wipe out the entire Heaven Gate!
