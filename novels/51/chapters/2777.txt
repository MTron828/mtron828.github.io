Moreover, this power could be stacked with his holy body. Even the power of a Heart of Saint Kingdom could be stimulated.

This was extremely terrifying. Qin Yu’s three Hearts of Saint Kingdom were practically useless.

Only the Boundless could play a certain role. However, the power the single Boundless could unleash was ordinary.

This was equivalent to the wooden barrel theory. All the boards in a circle were of the same height.

However, Chang Mang’s holy body was able to stack these boards together. This was a little inconceivable.

Chang Mang’s holy body seemed different from his Glazed Holy Body. Chang Mang belonged to the innate holy body.

Even if his divine soul entered the Saint Kingdom, his holy body would recover quickly.

Given this power, wasn’t he the future Lord of the Saint Kingdom?

Even Qin Yu felt that it was very exaggerated.

Qin Yu guessed.

He took out the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom without much hesitation and threw it in front of Chang Mang.

What the he*l!

Seeing Qin Yu’s behavior, Aiden could not help but be shocked.

These were nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom.

These were all rare treasures related to one of the 18 seats of the Holy Lord. However, Qin Yu threw the 9 in 1 Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom just like that.

“Alright!”

Chang Mang grinned. The purple lightning in his body erupted once more.

It wrapped around the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom. It seemed to be responding.

A sky-high energy burst out and a sky-high energy pillar swept up.

The Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom let out a huge explosion. An invincible force pushed Qin Yu hundreds of meters away.

Countless dazzling lights exploded in front of him.

A tornado seemed to have swept through the entire Nine Nether Cliff.

Under Qin Yu’s shocked gaze, the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom split into nine Sacred Kingdom Hearts again.

Then, it slowly entered Chang Mang’s body under the power of his holy body.

Twenty light bulbs lit up in his body.

Originally, Chang Mang’s body only had nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom. But now, he had Qin Yu’s Boundless, Vessel, and Divine Shield.

His body had already absorbed the power of nearly 20 Hearts of Saint Kingdom.

Once it fused into the Boundless, there was almost no precedent of it breaking down.

At this moment, the Boundless had disintegrated under Chang Mang’s power. Could Chang Mang and the Heart of Saint Kingdom be extremely compatible?

“Heaven Punishing Palm!”

Chang Mang roared. He could only feel an invincible power coursing through his body.

In an instant, hundreds of palms had already been blasted out from his hands.

A palm print directly blasted onto Qin Yu’s body. Qin Yu felt that invincible power and his eyes revealed extreme shock.

His arms were fractured under this attack. If he had not used the power of the Dao of Dreams, he would not have been able to withstand it.

“What an exaggerated strength! It has far exceeded Dao Consciousness level 9. Are you Dao Xuan’s fuc*king son?”

Qin Yu cursed.

“Hahaha, maybe I’m Dao Xuan’s illegitimate son. F*ck! I’ll challenge that stinky old man later. I must blast him into a meat patty!”

Chang Mang laughed loudly. At this moment, he could feel an indescribable power.

“Come! Come! Come! Fight another 300 rounds with me!”

Qin Yu’s face was stuck for words. Why was this brat the same as before? His mind was only filled with battle. “Get lost! I can’t beat you!”

Qin Yu said unhappily.

Aiden stared at the two in shock. His mouth opened for a long time.

It was because of Chang Mang’s power of the holy body and also because Qin Yu had given such a supreme treasure to Chang Mang.

What was the relationship between these two people? Could it be?

Aiden suddenly widened his eyes and stared at the two of them with a strange look.

“What are you looking at?”

Chang Mang felt a chill run down his spine when he saw Aiden’s ambiguous gaze. He slapped him to the ground.

They chose a place at the bottom of the cliff.

Then, they caught a few pheasants and started roasting them.

“Qin Yu, what do you plan to do next?”

Chang Mang fiddled with the firewood, making the bonfire burn brighter.

Qin Yu recounted what had happened. He naturally had to start searching for news of Heavenly Sin and rescue Yan Ruoxue.

Although his current strength was insignificant, he would never give up.

“I’ll follow you then! I don’t have anything to do anyway. I’ll teach that bullsh*t Heavenly Sin a lesson when I see it!”

Chang Mang grinned.

Chang Mang was still the same. Qin Yu recalled the time when he was facing Si Liuhe.

They were ignorant at that time. Chang Mang still attacked him without caring about the huge gap between them.

The brotherhood between him and Chang Mang did not require any mushy words.

Just like he had given him the Heart of Saint Kingdom without hesitation.

“But before that, I still have one more thing to do. Consider it as repaying the favor of the Guardian of Order.” Chang Mang laughed.

“Is what you want to do also here?”

Qin Yu asked.

There was too little information about Heavenly Sin right now. Moreover, he would definitely die with his current strength even if he found Heavenly Sin.

“Yes, Guardian of Order’s Yi Yun has delivered a message. There is a powerful Creepy at the bottom of Nine Nether Cliff. I have to collect the power and kill it.

I was originally unconfident, but I can probably wipe it out with your Heart of Saint Kingdom now!”

“The Creepy at the bottom of the cliff is not easy to deal with. Smoker Xie and Qin Ji are both Creepy. There are even more powerful existences at the bottom of the cliff. I’m afraid this kind of mission arrangement doesn’t have any good intentions for you.”

Aiden frowned when he heard that Chang Mang was going to the bottom of the cliff.

“Who cares? I’ll return the favor. I’ll flatten the Creepy with a slap!”

“Aiden, what exactly is Creepy?”

Qin Yu recalled Qin Ji’s previous battle. That power was indeed strong.

It was as if her body was a monster that would not rest until she died.

“That is a kind of power that extends from the bottom of the cliff. It can be considered a kind of peak power. Countless negative emotions form this kind of power and then a kind of will is produced after they eat each other. The power it emits is strange. Once it takes shape, it will form all kinds of restrictions. It is creepy, so it has been called ‘Creepy’ for many years.”

Aiden seemed to have some understanding of this power as he explained it to the two in detail.

“Qin Ji didn’t use this kind of restriction power when I was fighting with her..”
