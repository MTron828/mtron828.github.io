Chapter 490: A Half-step Martial Marquis Is Just So-so Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Fifth Elder’s eyes were also shining as he stared at the door.

The door slowly opened in front of their eyes.

Then, Qin Yu slowly walked out.

The Fifth Elder hurriedly stood up and grabbed Qin Yu’s arm.

His face was full of excitement and tears filled his eyes. He said in a trembling voice, “Qin Yu, you finally came out of closed-door cultivation...”

As he spoke, Fifth Elder’s face was covered in tears, and tears flowed down his face.

Qin Yu was dumbstruck. He asked in a daze, “Fifth Elder, what happened to you?”

Immediately after, Qin Yu saw the Second Elder, who was covered in injuries.

He hurriedly helped the Second Elder up and said anxiously, “Second Elder, what happened to you? Who did this?”

Second Elder grabbed Qin Yu’s hand and said coldly, “Qin Yu, no matter what, you have to take revenge!”

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu had a feeling that something was wrong.

The Second Elder and Fifth Elder immediately told Qin Yu what had happened.

While they were talking, Qin Yu became angrier and angrier. Traces of killing intent quickly swept over!

“You mean... the Pavilion Master was taken away by the Saint Confucian Sect?” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly!

The Pavilion Master was extremely kind to Qin Yu. Not only did she save him many times, but she was even willing to give Qin Yu generous resources!

Qin Yu would never forget such a kindness!

“If it wasn’t for the First Elder secretly drugging her, those half-step Martial Marquises wouldn’t be a match for the Pavilion Master at all!” The Second Elder said angrily.

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He suppressed the anger in his heart, bent down and said, “Second Elder, you should recuperate first. I’ll kill the First Elder now!”

“As for the Saint Confucian Sect... I, Qin Yu, will definitely go there!”

No matter what, Qin Yu wouldn’t let the Pavilion Master get hurt!

“Fifth Elder, I’ll leave the Second Elder to you.” Qin Yu looked at the Fifth Elder.

The Fifth Elder nodded and said, “Alright, be careful.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He turned around and walked towards the Pavilion Master’s building.

In the Pavilion Master’s building, the First Elder was lying comfortably on a rocking chair.

There was a pot of black tea that was once the Pavilion Master’s favorite.

And beside him, there were two attendants waiting on him.

The attendants’ expressions were extremely frightened. Facing the current First Elder, they were angry but didn’t dare to say anything.

“What? Are you very unwilling to attend to me?” The First Elder said coldly.

The attendant hurriedly stood up and said in a low voice, “No... I don’t dare to.”

“Remember, from today onwards, I am the new Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” The First Elder said coldly.

“If you guys want to live, you’d better forget about Ji Yuhong!”

The attendants didn’t say a word. They knelt in front of the First Elder and served him.

At this moment, the First Elder was a little worried.

According to the time, tomorrow was the day Qin Yu came out of seclusion.

If he really stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, he would definitely be unable to deal with him.

“I hope the people of the Hong Yi Sect won’t disappoint me,” the First Elder thought to himself.

At this moment, he suddenly felt an intense killing intent pressing toward him!

This killing intent was like a cold wave, causing the First Elder’s entire body to turn cold!

He hurriedly stood up and exclaimed, “Who is it?!”

“The person who will kill you!”

An ice-cold voice sounded from the darkness.

He saw a young man standing on the Pavilion Master’s building.

The young man’s expression was ice-cold, and his fists were tightly clenched. His terrifying aura made it hard for people to breathe!

“Qin... Qin Yu!”

When the First Elder saw who it was, his expression changed drastically!

Qin Yu walked forward step by step. He gritted his teeth and said, “The Pavilion Master has always regarded you as her confidant, but you actually colluded with the Saint Confucian Sect to commit such a betrayal.”

“First Elder, you committed a great sin!”

His loud shout immediately frightened the First Elder!

He suppressed the fear in his heart and tried his best to remain calm as he said, “Qin Yu, things aren’t as you imagined...”

“Slap!”

Before the First Elder could finish his words, a ray of golden light slapped his face!

“You d*mn beast!” Qin Yu gnashed his teeth and said.

The First Elder covered his face and said somewhat angrily, “You dare to hit me? Qin Yu, even if you succeed in breaking through, I’m not afraid of you! I’m also a half-step Martial Marquis!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Half my *ss!”

An inner strength filled with spiritual power instantly rolled over with a crushing force!

The First Elder tasted blood in his throat and spat out a mouthful of blood!

With just a shout, the First Elder’s body was injured. What kind of strength was this?!

One had to know that the First Elder was also a genuine half-step Martial Marquis!

“You...” After he felt his power, the First Elder’s expression became a bit ugly.

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. The way he looked at the First Elder was as if he was looking at an ant.

“A half-step Martial Marquis is just so-so,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The First Elder’s expression changed drastically, and his mind raced.

A moment later, the First Elder’s expression changed, and he said with an embarrassed smile, “Qin Yu, this is actually all a misunderstanding... listen to my explanation...”

“Explanation?” Qin Yu laughed coldly.

He stretched out his finger and two rays of golden light shot out!

“Crack!”

In the blink of an eye, the First Elder’s knees were instantly shattered. With a plop, he knelt on the ground!

“Kneel down first!” Qin Yu said coldly.

The First Elder’s expression was extremely ugly! As a half-step Martial Marquis, he had never suffered such humiliation!

What made him even more afraid was that he was unable to see through Qin Yu’s strength at all!

“Qin Yu, this matter has nothing to do with me. It was the Saint Confucian Sect that forced me to do it...” the First Elder hurriedly explained.

As long as he could survive today and wait for the ten half-step Martial Marquises of the Hong Yi Sect to arrive, then everything would take a turn for the better!

Therefore, First Elder desperately wanted to calm Qin Yu down!

But how could Qin Yu give him a chance? He slowly walked in front of the First Elder and said coldly, “Don’t worry, I won’t let you die so quickly. I will slowly torture you to death and make you kneel on the square of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion for the rest of your life...”

“Qin Yu, don’t be rash! Let’s talk!” The First Elder’s expression changed drastically!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Yeah right! For a beast like you, dying ten times is not enough.”

Sensing the killing intent from Qin Yu, the First Elder became even more worried.

He gritted his teeth and shouted angrily, “I am also a half-step Martial Marquis. Qin Yu, don’t go too far!”

“Half-step Martial Marquis? So what?” Qin Yu sneered.

“Currently, you’re just an ant in my eyes.”

The First Elder immediately flew into a rage. Energy burst out from his body, and wisps of bright light surrounded his palm.

“I don’t believe that you’re invincible!” The First Elder roared and pushed his palm towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu stood there without moving and allowed the First Elder’s palm to press down on him.
