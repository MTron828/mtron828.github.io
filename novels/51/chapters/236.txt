Dong Tianhai’s words had completely shed all pretense of cordiality.

Qin Yu wasn’t a fool. Although he didn’t know why Dong Tianhai would have such an attitude, Qin Yu couldn’t continue acting warmly to someone so openly hostile to him.

Fiddling with the Nine Transformation Golden Pill in his hand, Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Dong Tianhai.

“Mr. Dong, are you sure you don’t want this Nine Transformation Golden Pill?” Qin Yu asked with a smile.

Dong Tianhai shook his head and sneered. “Is it meaningful for you to persist even now?”

“Good, I happen to be a little reluctant to part with it.” Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

Qin Yu was currently at the bottleneck stage of his realm.

And this Nine Transformation Golden Pill might be able to bring an opportunity.

Qin Yu put away this Nine Transformation Golden Pill and turned around to leave.

“Humph, this kid has completely taken us for fools.”

“Exactly, he used a low-quality pill to deceive us time and time again. What a joke.”

“How can such a person be worthy of the title of King of Chuzhou?”

Dong Tianhai and the others sneered. They despised Qin Yu even more.

Qin Yu quickly returned to Bai City.

In the villa, the spiritual energy gathering formation was still operating. All the spiritual energy within a hundred miles was gathering here.

In the vegetable garden, Yao Qing was squatting in front of a stalk of herbs to observe.

On the surface of the herbs, there were layers of misty water droplets.

He tried to lick the water droplets with his tongue, and found that the water droplets actually contained spiritual energy!

Yao Qing was instantly overjoyed. He immediately laid down in the vegetable garden and began to lick them one by one.

“What are you doing?” At this moment, Qin Yu’s voice sounded from behind.

Yao Qing turned around and said with an embarrassed smile, “Mr. Qin, I am absorbing the spiritual energy in this water droplet.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Your posture is too indecent. Those who don’t know would think that there is a black dog in the vegetable garden.”

Yao Qing didn’t care. He said with a smile, “No one saw it anyway. What’s there to be afraid of?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He calculated the time. There was only one week left until the birth of the Divine Medicine.

“Mr. Qin, what exactly is the use of your Nine Transformation Golden Pill?” Yao Qing couldn’t help but ask.

“It’s said that the refinement of this Nine Transformation Golden Pill takes a very long time. The minimum is half a year, and it could even be as long as one’s entire life.” Qin Yu played with the Nine Transformation Golden Pill and muttered softly.

“Maybe I can try to complete the first three revolutions in one week.” Qin Yu said to himself.

Yao Qing couldn’t help but ask, “Mr. Qin, what does the first three revolutions mean?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said with a smile, “The first three revolutions are a process of body refining. In other words, it’s body remodeling.”

“Body remodeling?” Yao Qing didn’t seem to understand.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “In short, you just need to understand that every body remodeling will improve the quality of the body. That’s enough.”

“It’s said that the level of body remodeling is different for each person. According to the records of the inheritance, the current record is 130 body remodeling sessions.”

130 body remodeling sessions was the highest record in history.

And the effect of 130 body remodeling sessions was unimaginable!

50 body remodeling sessions could allow one’s body to reach another realm, and 130 body remodeling sessions could make one’s body comparable to steel!

“Remodeling the body more than a hundred times? How powerful would the body be?” After listening to the explanation, Yao Qing couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

“A hundred times is enough for me.” Qin Yu said with a smile.

After that, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He looked at Yao Qing and said, “Help me record and see how many times I can reshape it.”

After saying that, Qin Yu found a relatively quiet place and swallowed the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.

The moment the Nine Transformation Golden Pill entered his body, Qin Yu’s Dantian lit up with bright rays of light!

This ray of light almost made Qin Yu’s entire body transparent!

At a glance, one could even see through his internal organs!

Yao Qing, who was watching this scene from the side, couldn’t help but cover his mouth.

“This... what is this thing?” Yao Qing gulped.

Qin Yu didn’t make a sound. He closed his eyes and used the spiritual energy in his body to guide the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.

The first transformation of the Nine Transformation Golden Pill began!

The pill and Qin Yu’s Dantian began to combine. This was the first transformation of the Nine Transformation Golden Pill!

During the second transformation, the pill exploded in Qin Yu’s body before enveloping his body, blood, and bones!

And the third transformation was the most important. That was the official beginning of body remodeling!

“Crack!”

The moment the third transformation began, Qin Yu’s bones instantly shattered! Cracks began to appear on his body!

The so-called body remodeling was a process where the body was destroyed and then rebuilt!

“Crack! Crack!”

Qin Yu’s body continued to shatter and reassemble.

This process was extremely painful. Every body remodeling would cause huge mental duress!

At the same time, every time he reconstructed his body, his physical body would receive a huge improvement!

Looking at Qin Yu, who was covered in blood, Yao Qing was so scared that his face turned pale. He couldn’t help but take a few steps back!

He even wanted to wake Qin Yu up. After hesitating for a long time, he finally gave up on this idea.

“Kacha kacha!”

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu’s physical body was completely reconstructed for the first time!

After the reconstruction, Qin Yu’s body glittered with a golden light. It was like layers of gold dust covered Qin Yu’s bones.

Crack.

Soon, the second reconstruction began!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and endured the pain.

At the same time, he was somewhat nervous.

It was said that the chaotic body was invincible. No one knew how effective the Nine Transformation Golden Pill could be!

The body shattered and fused again. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

In just half an hour, Qin Yu had completed two body remodeling sessions!

The third, fourth, fifth...

Time flew, and the full moon appeared in the sky.

In five hours, Qin Yu’s body had completed ninety-three body remodeling sessions!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body had entered another realm!

His bones were emitting golden light, and his skin was crystal clear. One couldn’t even see his pores!

Meanwhile, Qin Yu’s body remodeling was still continuing! It didn’t seem to be stopping any time soon!

“He has already rebuilt his body 123 times. Mr. Qin might be able to break the record!” Yao Qing couldn’t help but feel a little excited!

The sky gradually lit up. It had already been 12 hours since Qin Yu swallowed the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body remodeling had already reached the 130th time!

“You’ve broken the record! Mr. Qin, you’ve broken the record!” Yao Qing couldn’t help but shout excitedly!

However, what surprised Yao Qing was that Qin Yu didn’t move at all!

His body was already continuously breaking and reassembling!

“Don’t tell me... Don’t tell me you’re going to continue?” Yao Qing, his eyes filled with shock, swallowed hard!

He didn’t dare to say anything more and hurriedly sat beside Qin Yu while nervously looking at Qin Yu’s body.

The 131st time, the 132nd time, the 133rd time...

At noon, Qin Yu’s body had already been reconstructed 260 times, which was twice the number of the highest record!

Yao Qing was already a little numb, but the end of the body remodeling process still hadn’t come.
