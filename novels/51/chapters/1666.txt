Chapter 1667: Chapter 1,667, is it good or evil Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Not many people knew about this matter. How could this mysterious person in front of him know it in such detail!

“What do you mean by that?”Qin Yu said with a cold face.

The other party did not answer this question. Instead, he said in a deep voice, “I’m here to tell you not to trust anyone easily. If you don’t want to die, don’t go to the East Wilderness. That place is not something you can touch!”

After saying this, he turned around and was about to leave.

“Who the hell are you? Stop right there!”Qin Yu shouted and immediately chased after him!

The other party’s speed was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, he shot out.

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He immediately activated the line word formula and quickly chased after him.

However, what shocked Qin Yu was that even with the line word formula, he was still far from catching up to the other party!

“How is this possible!”This made Qin Yu even more shocked. One had to know that there were only a few people in the entire South Province who were faster than Qin Yu!

This mysterious person in front of him was probably terrifyingly powerful!

Very soon, that mysterious person completely disappeared from sight.

Qin Yu stood there with an extremely cold expression.

“Someone... is following me?”Qin Yu took a deep breath as he had a bad feeling in his heart.

Soon, Zhuo Jing caught up with him.

“Where is he?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “He is too fast. I Can’t catch up with him.”

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “What does he mean by this? Why doesn’t he let us go to the East Wilderness? Is My Guess True?”

“It shouldn’t be.”Qin Yu still didn’t want to believe it.

He recalled the scene when Xiao Sheng discussed dao with him, and it didn’t seem like he was lying to him.

Moreover, what he did was meaningless.

If he really wanted to kill Qin Yu, Qin Yu would have died a hundred times.

But why did this mysterious person suddenly appear to warn him? Who was he? What was his intention?

Countless thoughts appeared in Qin Yu’s mind, and he felt like his brain was about to explode.

“Take a rest first. Think about it carefully before making a decision.”Zhuo Jing patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu nodded. The sudden change had indeed made Qin Yu a little dazed.

Therefore, the two of them stopped at a nearby city temporarily.

They sat in a quiet teahouse and looked at each other without saying a word.

“There are only a few people in the south province who are so powerful, unless he is not from the South Province,”Zhuo Jing said at this moment.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He thought of everyone but could not figure out who he was.

“Could it be... he is really from the Yan Family?”Qin Yu took a deep breath and felt a chill on his back.

If he was really from the Yan family, then he must have been sent by Yan Ruoxue because with Qin Yu’s current power, he was not worth the attention of the Yan family.

If they were really sent by Yan Ruoxue, then this matter would have to be considered from a long-term perspective.

Because anyone could harm Qin Yu, but Yan Ruoxue would not.

“Brother Qin, what do you think?”Zhuo Jing asked from the side.

Qin Yu opened his mouth. He originally planned to let Zhuo Jing help analyze it, but he felt that it was better to keep the matter regarding the Yan family a secret. In the end, he shook his head.

“Let me think about it carefully,”said Qin Yu in a deep voice.

Having said that, he looked at Zhuo Jing and asked, “Brother Zhuo, do you know anything about Xiao Sheng?”

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “I don’t really know much about him, but I do know a little about him. Back then, he had a friendship with my father.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly, indicating for him to continue.

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “Xiao Sheng is an extremely strange person. His cultivation is very strong, so strong that it makes people feel fearful. This is the evaluation my father had of him back then.”

“Rumor has it that at his peak, he almost unified the entire Li Province. If it weren’t for the Dead River blocking his way, the current situation wouldn’t be the same.”

Qin Yu agreed and said, “I’ve heard about this. What about him?”

“It’s hard to say.”Zhuo Jing frowned.

“He’s not that old. He’s a few years younger than my father. Rumor has it that he was born in a small mountain village and has no background. He climbed all the way up by stepping on the corpses of others.”

“But my father said that he relied on his hard strength. It’s definitely not a conspiracy because there’s no one who can stop him 100% in the South Province.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He had the same impression of Xiao Sheng.

“But there’s a problem,”Zhuo Jing suddenly said.

Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and waited for his follow-up.

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “Don’t forget about Xiao Hai. The two of them look exactly the same, so... There’s a lot of behavior that we can’t be sure whether it was done by Xiao Hai or Xiao Sheng.”

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed, and he said in surprise, “You mean... in many good aspects, it’s very likely that Xiao Hai did it for Xiao Sheng?”

“It’s possible. After all, it was Xiao Hai who did the nine holes incident. If the one who did it was Xiao Sheng, I’m afraid the nine of them would have died long ago,”said Zhuo Jing.

Qin Yu was silent. After Zhuo Jing’s reminder, Qin Yu felt that it was very likely.

Xiao Hai usually wore a mask, so no one knew that he and Xiao Sheng were blood brothers.

Therefore, Xiao Hai used Xiao Sheng’s name to do good deeds, and all of this would be on Xiao Sheng’s head.

“If that’s really the case... that would be too scary.”Qin Yu’s face was a bit unnatural.

“Who knows whether Xiao Sheng is good or evil?”Zhuo Jing shook his head helplessly.

“You said before that your father went to the East Wilderness and that this matter led to your father’s death. What does that mean?”Qin Yu asked.

Zhuo Jing was silent for a moment, then, he said coldly, “My father was in high spirits back then and stepped into the reversion void stage in one go. He could be said to be in a glorious position in the South Province. However, he was different from the nine caves. He had no interest in battles and was dedicated to pursuing the DAO.”

“After stepping into the reversion void stage, he went to the Eastern Wilderness. Ever since he came back from the Eastern Wilderness, he was unable to recover. Later on, he was killed in a big battle.”

“With my father’s ability, even if he couldn’t win, he could at least escape. However, he lost completely that time.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “May I ask, who killed your father? Does it have anything to do with Xiao Sheng?”

“It has nothing to do with him. As for the person who killed my father, he didn’t come from the South Province. He was from the Central Province,”said Zhuo Jing.

Qin Yu touched his chin, feeling more and more frightened.

According to Zhuo Jing’s analysis, his father might have been killed by Xiao Sheng. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Now that Xiao Sheng asked Qin Yu to go to the east continent, did he also want to kill by Xiao Sheng?

“Impossible, Xiao Sheng is definitely not that kind of person.”Qin Yu still found it hard to believe.

Now that Xiao Hai was dead, the person who discussed dao with Qin Yu must be Xiao Sheng.

That Xiao Sheng on the cultivation mountain was obviously a very intelligent person. How could he do such a thing?
