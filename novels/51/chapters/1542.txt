“The northern border? I’ll go too!”Di Zun volunteered.

Qin Yu shook his head. “With your current cultivation, it’ll be a waste if you go. Just stay here obediently.”

With that, Qin Yu nodded to the deputy sect master and planned to leave.

“Little friend Qin, please wait.”The deputy sect master suddenly opened his mouth and called out to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu turned to look at the deputy sect master and said, “Deputy Sect Master, you don’t have to stay any longer. The northern lands have done many evil deeds. I will definitely go.”

A trace of embarrassment flashed across the deputy sect master’s face. He coughed and said, “Young friend Qin, you have misunderstood. I just want to ask young friend Qin to return the Heavenly Essence Bell.”

“The heavenly essence bell is extremely important to the current heavenly cloud sect, so...”

Qin Yu immediately appeared extremely embarrassed. He hurriedly took out the heaven origin bell and handed it over to the deputy sect master.

After the deputy sect master received the Heaven Origin Bell, Qin Yu could not help but ask, “This thing is only a void-returning artifact. It doesn’t have much use. is it really that important to the Tianyun sect?”

After hearing these words, a trace of ridicule flashed across the deputy sect master’s face.

He sneered and said, “That’s because the first elder doesn’t know how to activate this thing. Since this thing is called the Qianyuan Bell, the sound is naturally the number one attack method. It’s a pity that the first elder has placed the cart before the horse and wasted this heavenly treasure.”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization. No wonder the Qianyuan Bell was so valued.

After returning the Qianyuan Bell, Qin Yu also planned to leave.

......

Before he left, he could not help but look at the cultivation mountain.

The cultivation mountain was as usual. It was shrouded in thick fog, like a sealed space.

No matter how big of a disturbance the Tianyun sect encountered, the cultivation mountain would not have any reaction.

Qin Yu was increasingly puzzled. What was the reason that a person who valued his sect so much would not leave the mountain when faced with danger.

Qin Yu did not continue thinking. He knew that he could not figure it out either.

Looking at the Cultivation Mountain, Qin Yu turned around and left.

...

After this battle, the entire structure of the South Province was quietly changing.

In the next few days, almost everyone was talking about this matter.

They could not help but feel shocked at Qin Yu’s terrifying battle strength. Some people even listed Qin Yu and the three madness and three absolutes together.

“With Qin Yu’s current ability, he is definitely not weaker than Yongji.”

“The three maniacs and three uniques are evenly matched. They have never fought before. If Qin Yu can defeat Yongji, it means that he is not afraid of any of them.”

“Ai, other than Xiao Hai and the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, I’m afraid that no one in the entire South Province can take down Qin Yu with 100% certainty.”

At this moment, in Yongji City.

Yong Ji lay on the sickbed, adjusting his internal Qi.

However, no matter how he adjusted his state of mind, Qin Yu’s “Arrogant”face could not help but pop up in his mind.

“This bastard...”Yong Ji suddenly sat up from the bed, his face somewhat pale.

At this moment, an adopted son walked forward and whispered, “Adoptive father, we... should leave the South Province.”

Yong Ji glanced at him and said coldly, “Leave? Why should we leave? Wouldn’t that be a bone-chilling curse?”

“But... The Tianyun sect is a hidden danger after all. No one can guarantee that they won’t attack us,”the adopted son said worriedly.

Yong ji snorted and said, “First elder has already made a poison vow that he will never attack our eternal city in the future.”

“Can a first elder represent the entire Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

At this moment, an old man in a black robe suddenly appeared in the Eternal City.

His aura was extremely strange. With every step he took, the surrounding space rippled like water ripples. The internal Qi of the old man was extremely strange.

Yong Ji frowned and asked coldly, “Who are you?”

“I’m the one who saved you,”the old man said coldly.

Yong Ji’s expression darkened and he said coldly, “When did I, Yong Ji, need anyone to save me? You, on the other hand, came uninvited. Do you have any respect for me, Yong Ji?”

After saying that, Yong Ji suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed at the old man!

However, when his palm touched the old man’s body, it actually went straight through!

When Yong Ji saw this, his expression could not help but change greatly!

What kind of spell was this? It was actually so strange?

Yong Ji didn’t believe it and attacked again, but the result was still the same!

All the spells passed through his body! His body didn’t seem to be corporeal!

‘this person’s comprehension of space is definitely not something I can compare to,’Yong Ji thought in his heart, and traces of sweat appeared on his face.

In his impression, other than the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect, he had never seen such a terrifying spatial spell!

“Who exactly are you?”Yong Ji said with some fear.

The black-robed man beside the old man immediately shouted, “This is our northern land’s Lord Sima Bei!”

“Sima Bei?”Yong Ji was stunned.

Wasn’t Sima Bei killed by Qin Yu? Why did he appear again?

Moreover, wasn’t Sima Bei a young man? Why did he become an old man now?

Sima bei seemed to have noticed Yong Ji’s confusion and said coldly, “Do you really think that Qin Yu can kill me? That’s just a clone of mine.”

Speaking up to this point, Sima bei paused for a moment before continuing, “This body is also just another clone of mine.”

Yong Ji’s expression became even more shocked! At this moment, he suddenly felt extremely tiny! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yong Ji had always thought of himself as a top-notch martial artist, but now he realized that there was always someone better than him!

In front of Sima bei, he seemed to be unable to be arrogant.

Yong Ji took a deep breath and said, “Why are you looking for me?”

Sima bei said coldly, “I’m here to tell you a piece of news. First Elder is dead.”

“What? !”Yong Ji’s expression changed drastically!

Sima bei continued, “He’s already dead, so his oath naturally won’t be effective. Do you think that the Heavenly Cloud sect will look for you to settle the score in the future?”

“According to what I know, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is going to come out of seclusion soon. Once he comes out, do you have the confidence to defeat him?”

Yong Ji’s expression was extremely unsightly, and his forehead was even covered in dense sweat.

He had always been extremely fearful of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect. That unfathomable method had once been Yong Ji’s nightmare.

“You... what exactly do you mean?”Yong Ji said with a frown.

Sima bei said indifferently, “I’m here to save you. Right now, your only way out is to follow me and submit to the Northern Lands!”

“Once you step into the northern lands, no one will be able to kill you. With your abilities, the northern lands will definitely nurture you heavily.”

Yong Ji could not help but have a gloomy expression as he clenched his fists tightly.

His goal was to become a ruler, and definitely not to submit to others!

This was also the reason why he had established Yongji City and widely accepted foster children!

He had been conserving his energy for so many years, waiting for an opportunity! An opportunity to replace the Tianyun sect!
