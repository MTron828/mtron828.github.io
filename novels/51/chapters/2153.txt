2154 The Number One Person in Ten Thousand Years!

At the center of these runes, four unforgettable words appeared.

“Heaven and Earth Shattering!”

It was the secret technique Si Liuhe was about to activate. It was a mysterious technique passed down from his family. Once activated, it could trigger the power of heaven and earth to form an incredibly terrifying attack.

The moment he activated the Heaven and Earth Shattering technique, the world seemed to tremble. Numerous sounds of thunder rumbling came from the sky as if the scene of heaven and earth collapsing was about to descend. The place where he stood was a void. It seemed to be torn apart by his power and wanted to devour everything.

The surrounding people were all shocked. They could feel the power of this Heaven and Earth Shattering technique. It was a true destructive power that could crush everything with it.

However, in the face of such terrifying power, Flower Granny remained silent as if nothing in front of her could shake her state of mind.

“Flower Granny, take this move of Heaven and Earth Shattering!” Si Liuhe’s voice sounded again. As soon as he finished speaking, the rumbling sound of thunder in the sky became even more intense as if the end of the world was coming.

Then he stared coldly at Flower Granny. The runes in his hand began to circulate rapidly. Numerous lights seemed to be drawn by an invisible force and started gathering in his palm.

Immediately after, that terrifying power of Heaven and Earth Shattering finally erupted. There was an enormous light.

A beam shot out from Si Liuhe’s palm like a shooting star in the sky, unstoppably.

The light beam flew straight toward Flower Granny, and the air it passed by turned cold as if it was about to be frozen by that terrifying power.

However, just as the light beam was about to touch Flower Granny, she slowly opened her eyes.

There was no trace of panic in her eyes. Instead, it appeared incredibly profound as if she could see through the vast expanse of everything.

Then she gently raised a hand and drew a trajectory in the air with her fingers as if she was playing a long-lost melody.

At that moment, the direction where she waved her finger seemed to have been pulled by an invisible force, and the elements in the air began to form a strange phenomenon.

Her fingers moved gracefully as if she was playing an ancient piece of music. Every note seemed to be filled with the vicissitudes and wisdom of the time.

At this moment, Si Liuhe’s Heaven-Shattering Earth-Shattering seemed to have encountered an irresistible obstacle. The light beam heading straight for Flower Granny stopped in the air and then disappeared quietly like a burst bubble.

Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief.

Si Liuhe’s earth-shattering power was like a toy in the hands of a playful child, but it was easily shattered in front of Flower Granny.

At this moment, the scene fell into a dead silence. Countless people were tremendously shocked.

Si Liuhe’s expression turned pale instantly, and disbelief filled his eyes. He could not believe Flower Granny had dispelled his Heaven and Earth Shattering so easily.

Looking at Si Liuhe’s shocked expression, Flower Granny’s face remained expressionless as if everything was how it should be.

Her face resembled that of an ancient being, having endured the vicissitudes of life. It was marked by deep crevices, brimming with profoundness. No one could associate her with the once glamorous and peerless woman she once was.

“Heaven and Earth are originally formless. Without form, there is no collapse, and without collapse, there is no fracture.” Flower Granny quietly spoke out a few words.

Si Liuhe was stunned when he heard those words. He stood in a daze, muttering those words to himself as if he had comprehended something.

A few moments later, Si Liuhe’s face revealed a deep admiration.

He bowed to Flower Granny and said, “Flower Granny, I was too ignorant and arrogant just now. I, Si Liuhe, can never catch up to you even if I cultivate for a thousand or a hundred years. You’re as expected of once the number one person in the world!”

The crowd was instantly shocked when they heard this!

What happened? Si Liuhe, who had always been arrogant, actually admitted that he was inferior to Flower Granny! It was simply unheard of!

The surrounding people instantly fell into a dead silence. Their eyes widened, and their faces revealed disbelief.

Some people opened their mouths as if wanting to say something, but nothing came out. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Some people’s bodies and fingers trembled as if they could not accept the reality before them!

Some people’s faces turned pale, and their eyes flickered with fear as if they had encountered the end of the world!

The people who had admired Si Liuhe looked at him in shock!

The invincible existence in their minds actually publicly admitted that he was inferior to Flower Granny. This had simply surpassed their limits of comprehension.

Those who had always been in awe of Flower Granny were even more convinced now.

They looked at the seemingly old lady with deep admiration in their eyes. The existence they once thought was merely a legend had now revealed its true form before them.

The people who had been suspicious of Flower Granny were now completely shocked by her.

“Thank you, Flower Granny, for showing mercy. I will never forget your kindness of not killing me.” Si Liuhe bowed again, expressing his admiration with the utmost reverence and respect.

With just a casual move, Flower Granny made this excessively arrogant person willingly bow in submission. Her power was unquestionable, living up to her renowned reputation!

Looking at Si Liuhe who had retreated to the side, Yan Tianshi could not help but slightly sigh.

He walked forward and said, “Flower Granny is indeed the number one person in ten thousand years.”

The number one person in ten thousand years!

This title shocked everyone!

The Yan family’s Holy Lord actually called her the number one person in ten thousand years! How powerful was this Flower Granny?

“Flower Granny, although you are formidable, there must be a solution to this matter. You also know what it means to kidnap the saintess. I believe you’re a reasonable person.” Yan Tianshi then changed the subject.

Flower Granny remained silent, waiting for him to continue.

Yan Tianshi thought for a moment and said, “How about this? Three days later, we’ll meet on Peach Blossom Island and discuss this matter together.”

Flower Granny turned around and looked at Dean Lei, who was standing behind her as if she was asking for his opinion.

“I reluctantly agree, but don’t play any tricks!” Dean Lei stood up and said.

“Don’t worry, I, Yan Tianshi, am a man of my word,” Yan Tianshi said calmly.

Dean Lei snorted lightly, pulled Qin Yu up, and said, “Let’s go!”

Everyone looked in Qin Yu’s direction and did not say a word. They knew that they could not take Qin Yu away now.

Qin Yu could not help but look at Yan Ruoxue, who was not far away. There was a hint of apology in his gaze.

Yan Ruoxue wiped away her tears and gave Qin Yu an encouraging look. Her big eyes were full of love.

Bringing Qin Yu along, Dean Lei left the place while Yan Tianshi and the rest had gloomy expressions.
