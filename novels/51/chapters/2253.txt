2254 The Final Decision

The voice of vicissitudes narrated gently.

“On the path of cultivation, all things are extinguished. The way of being a father lies in protection. Therefore, I can’t provide you with numerous resources like the nine great aristocratic families. Instead, I chose to bring you suffering.”

Qin Yu was silent.

“Father has watched you come all this way. If I were you, I definitely couldn’t reach where you are now… Your path of cultivation can only be described as full of innumerable hardships.”

The voice sounded somewhat choked up.

“Father, it’s not your fault. I chose this path myself. Moreover, what Yan Ruoxue brings me is forever happiness.”

Qin Yu murmured.

“My Dao in this life has come to an end. I entered the Dao as an ordinary person. Along the way, I fought with the strongest experts on the continent, with ancient divine beasts, with people who have reincarnated nine times, and also against the strongest people in the world… However, the most important thing was to live with the person I loved the most.”

The butterflies, one after another, danced in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. Scenes flashed through Qin Yu’s mind one after another. It was the first time he had seen his father so clearly. He read his father’s life and felt his father and mother’s love for him.

“Son, see carefully. This is the last battle of your father’s life.”

The butterfly turned into streams of pure energy and poured into Qin Yu’s divine sense. A Heaven Gate opened in the void, and a person who looked like a god of war walked out slowly.

That person exuded an aura that dominated the world, with a presence more majestic than mountains and rivers.

“The Guardian who violates the way shall be executed!”

The sky seemed to have been pulled apart, and two giant pupils in the pitch-black night sky stared at that person.

Time froze, space shattered, and the rules of that space thundered and flashed.

Hahahahaha!

“Son, see carefully!”

With one punch, the mountain and river were as if surging forward, and the golden radiance even overshadowed the sun.

A rage of thunder, akin to nine heavenly springs, surged into the entire expanse of heaven and earth like a tidal wave.

The massive thunder of heaven and earth fiercely struck him.

“Son, don’t doubt, don’t retreat. Persevere on your Dao. Just as you said, this is the most unregretful decision I’ve ever made in my life. This is the most satisfying battle I’ve ever had.”

Something seemed to shatter in his divine sense, and Qin Yu’s heart trembled.

He regained consciousness, and tears flowed from the corners of his eyes.

“Father violated the rules of heaven and earth for the sake of me.”

Suddenly, he burst into loud sobs, and his heart filled with pain as if all the air had been sucked out of it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Father, thank you.”

There was no more hesitation in Qin Yu’s gaze. The will his father left him, in the end, allowed him to see the path ahead clearly.

At this moment, he no longer hesitated.

His divine sense returned, and he regained control of Suo Lin’s boxing gloves.

The intense fire poison had been completely expelled from his mind within a divine thought. The energy in the lava was slowly injected into his body with the help of the fire unicorn’s inner core.

In this fire unicorn land, the fire unicorn was the absolute master.

It could still bring many surprises to Qin Yu, even if it was just an inner core.

He greedily absorbed this pure energy and slowly repaired his body.

With the help of his father, his soul had already recovered by more than half.

On top of the lava, Wang Feng and Old Guai had already suffered soul torture for a few days.

Wang Feng was barely holding on to his life. Old Guai’s soul was much stronger than Wang Feng’s, and his condition was slightly better. However, his internal qi was also weak and feeble.

“D*mn it! You actually teamed up with that brat to trick me!”

Ming Yue’s face contorted, and she ruthlessly chopped off one of Elder Guai’s feet.

Elder Guai let out a muffled groan and screamed in pain. Ming Yue’s venomous expression made the surrounding cultivators shudder.

Almost everyone believed that Qin Yu could not have survived because no one could hide in the lava for so long. Moreover, it was a cultivator whose soul and body were severely injured.

Ming Yue thus directly vented her anger on the two of them. She injected another green soul spell into their souls. Wang Feng and Elder Guai immediately rolled on the ground in pain.

“Old witch! You’re courting death!”

A voice suddenly sounded on the Fire Unicorn Continent.

Jue Wu and the man with the mustache appeared in the crowd. After the man with the mustache man left earlier on, he quickly contacted Jue Wu.

They had just arrived at the Fire Unicorn Continent when they saw a heartbreaking scene. Qin Yu was nowhere to be seen.

Wang Feng and Elder Guai were on the verge of death after being tortured.

“Where’s Qin Yu?”

Jue Wu asked with a trembling voice.

“That kid is underneath the lava. If you are interested, you can go and search for him.”

Ming Yue sneered and said.

Jue Wu took a deep breath, her face filled with despair.

“Well, well, well. Another one. Even if I have to turn into ashes, I will burn the bones of everyone related to him to ashes before him!” Ming Yue’s voice was mournful.

“Go to hell, old witch!”

Jue Wu leaped and punched out. The fist aura was as fierce as a fierce beast.

A person by the side sneered and blocked with his sword.

The sword and the fist clashed fiercely. The flexible sword bent and attacked Jue Wu’s head.

“Get lost!”

Jue Wu’s brute force erupted, and that punch was powered up.

The flexible sword and the person holding it smashed onto the ground. Jue Wu’s body fell and crushed the person’s head.

“You’re courting death!”

Ming Yue shouted in anger, and several venomous snakes, choosing their targets, moved slowly through the air and suddenly entered Jue Wu’s head.

“Ding!”

This attack caused a wave of dizziness in her soul, almost making her stagger a few steps back and fall.

“It’s actually a Nirvana Body, but what’s the use? The Nirvana Body is the peak of your realm. Don’t even think about reaching the fifth-grade realm in this lifetime!”

Ming Yue sneered. With a wave of her hand, she brought along a surge of abundant spiritual energy and directly slapped Jue Wu’s body, sending her flying a few hundred meters away straight away!

“Did you see this? This is the difference between us. Even if I don’t use my Divine Sense Attack, I can still slowly kill you with my cultivation realm’s suppression!”

“You’re so long-winded!”

Despair filled Jue Wu’s eyes. She charged out madly and arrived before Ming Yue again.

Once, twice, and ten times in a row.

Jue Wu was sent flying again and again. No one knew how many bones in her body had broken, but she was like a ferocious beast, and her aura did not decrease at all.

“Who is this cultivator? Although she’s only a fourth-grade True Saint, I’ve never seen such aura before.”

“What a pity! A fourth-grade against a ninth-grade Palace Master of Azure Firmament Sect is death no matter what.”

“Sigh, why don’t you just give away the divine artifact? An innocent man will be punished for holding a treasure.”

…

The surrounding cultivators discussed animatedly.

“Sigh, I shouldn’t have come back.”

The man with the mustache’s face was full of agony. He had wanted to return and bring Jue Wu to see if they could save Qin Yu and the others, but he did not expect Jue Wu to get involved.

“I’ve had enough fun, and it’s about time to take you down.”

As Ming Yue sneered, the tip of her finger flicked, and the air in front of her finger turned into a sharp blade, chopping off Jue Wu’s legs.
