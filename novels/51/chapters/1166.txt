Chapter 1167: Chapter 1,167: a quick battle 

However, this time, Gu Xinghe did not underestimate his opponent. He slapped his palm forward, and a mountain-like imprint appeared!

The imprint landed on Chang Mang’s body and smashed him into the ground in an instant. A large part of his chest had sunk in!

“Whoosh!”

Gu Xinghe’s figure suddenly disappeared and appeared in front of Chang Mang in the Blink of an eye.

He held Chang Mang’s body with one hand and said coldly, “If I let you live, you might become the next Qin Yu. Even if I can’t kill you, I’ll turn you into a cripple!”

“Stop!”

At this moment, a loud shout came from outside.

Turning around, he saw a man in his twenties walking in.

“Ye Qing?”

Jiang he frowned slightly when he saw the newcomer.

The others also whispered, “Ye Qing? Why is he here? Is he here to represent the authorities?”

“It’s normal. Gu Xinghe has killed too many ordinary people. It’s time for ye Qing to make his move.”

“But with ye Qing’s ability, he can’t kill Gu Xinghe.”

At this moment, ye Qing had already entered the martial saint realm. However, he was still no match for Gu Xinghe.

“Commander Ye? How have you been?”

Seeing ye Qing walking over, Gu Xinghe did not panic at all.

He threw Chang Mang to the side and said indifferently, “Commander Ye, what can I do for You?”

Ye Qing said with a sullen face, “Gu Xinghe, as the president of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu, you actually did so many despicable and evil things. Do you know your crimes?”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Commander Ye, are you kidding me? Know your crimes? What crimes do I Know?”Gu Xinghe said with a sneer.

Ye Qing said with a cold face, “You’ve killed so many people, are you still playing dumb with me? Gu Xinghe, I advise you to go back with me immediately.”

“Go Back? Go back to Where?”The ridicule on Gu Xinghe’s face became more and more intense.

He sneered, “Is there any place in this world that can hold me? Moreover, can you kill me?”

Ye Qing immediately flew into a rage, “Gu Xinghe, don’t be too arrogant. Don’t think that we really can’t do anything to You!”

Gu Xinghe gestured at ye Qing and said, “Then you can try.”

Ye Qing did not make a move but said coldly, “If you don’t go back with me today, I will not let you off.”

“Hahahaha!”Gu Xinghe laughed even more savagely. At this moment, he suddenly reached out and grabbed Chang Mang in his hand!

Then, Gu Xinghe looked at ye Qing coldly and said, “Alright, I will cripple him in front of you today. I want to see what you can do to me!”

With that, Gu Xinghe bent one hand and grabbed Chang Mang’s lower abdomen.

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, a golden light cut through the sky and arrived in front of Chang Mang in an instant!

Qin Yu stepped on the ‘xing’character and placed the bronze sword on Chang Mang’s chest.

“Clang!”

Gu Xinghe’s fingers grabbed onto the bronze sword and a violent roar was immediately heard.

The recoil made Gu Xinghe’s fingers hurt and his face contorted.

“Qin Yu!”

Everyone cried out in surprise when they saw who it was! Gu Xinghe’s eyes lit up and a hint of excitement flashed across his face.

Ye Qing was also delighted!

It was not that ye Qing did not have a chance to kill Gu Xinghe, it was just that the price was too high.

It would be best if Qin Yu could kill Gu Xinghe!

“Qin Yu, I’ve been looking for you so hard!”Gu Xinghe said with a gloomy face.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He pulled Chang Mang to the side and then frowned, “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine. I want to kill this bastard!”Chang Mang’s eyes widened like copper bells.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “What happened?”

“Zhai Xing is dead,”pavilion master said in a deep voice.

After hearing Pavilion Master’s words, Qin Yu’s face couldn’t help but change.

Soon, he found Zhai Xing’s corpse lying on the ground.

Qin Yu did not dare to say anything. He hurriedly walked to Zhai Xing and covered Zhai Xing’s forehead with his palm.

“It’s useless. I’ve already checked. His primordial spirit has been destroyed,”pavilion master said.

“Not only that, this Gu Xinghe has also killed many ordinary people, many innocent people!”Ye Qing said coldly.

Chang Mang, who was at the side, said with some annoyance, “It’s all my fault for being too weak. I couldn’t protect them...”

Qin Yu knew Chang Mang’s character. He was very similar to Qin Yu. Both of them were born in poverty, and they both had natural sympathy and compassion for those who lived at the bottom.

“It’s not your fault, it’s My Fault.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart, but that anger still made him almost lose his mind.

“Qin Yu, Gu Xinghe’s sins are monstrous. We can’t let him off no matter what,”ye Qing said from the side.

Qin Yu glanced at ye Qing and said, “Commander Ye, don’t worry. I Won’t let him off even if you don’t tell me.”

Not far away, Gu Xinghe said indifferently, “Qin Yu, what kind of bewitching potion did you give Zhai Xing? He would rather die in my hands than serve me. TSK TSK, I have to say, I really admire you.”

Qin Yu stood up from the ground. He gritted his teeth and said, “Gu Xinghe, you f * cking Beast!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Why are you saying the same thing as that Savage? There’s nothing else to say, right?”

“Swoosh!”

Gu Xinghe only felt a golden light flash in front of his eyes. In the next second, Qin Yu’s figure appeared in front of Gu Xinghe.

“Qin Yu, it seems that these few days... Ah!”

Before Gu Xinghe could finish his sentence, Qin Yu had already punched his lower abdomen!

This punch did not send Gu Xinghe flying like he had imagined, but the powerful force made Gu Xinghe suffer a lot of pain!

He held his stomach, and his upper body could not help but bend into a shrimp shape!

Qin Yu took the opportunity to reach out and grab Gu Xinghe’s head. Then, he suddenly raised his knee and slammed it into Gu Xinghe’s face!

With a bang, Gu Xinghe’s body flew up into the air and flipped 360 degrees in the air before he finally fell to the ground!

He covered his face that was covered in blood and crawled up from the ground.

“You F * cking...”Gu Xinghe spat out a mouthful of blood and one of his back teeth followed.
