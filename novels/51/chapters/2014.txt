2015 Killing Elder Si!

Xiao Hai shook his head and said carefreely, “If I were afraid of him, I wouldn’t have come into a conflict with him.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and wanted to persuade him, but Xiao Hai waved his hand and said, “Thank you for your concern, friend. I have my ways to protect myself.”

Following that, Xiao Hai left the money on the table and left.

After he left, Qin Yu could not help but secretly grit his teeth.

With the Si family’s style of doing things, they would definitely not let this matter rest.

If they bumped into Xiao Hai, they would definitely make a move. “No matter what, I can’t let anything happen to Xiao Hai,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After much thought, an incredibly bold idea suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s mind. That was to kill Elder Si! As long as he killed him, there would be no more risk!

“If I had a Saint Weapon, I might have a chance to kill Elder Si,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, he did not know if Elder Si had any Saint Weapon or other self-protection items with him.

“Once I make a move, there’s no turning back. Therefore, this operation can only succeed. I can’t fail!” Qin Yu’s face flashed with coldness.

Since he couldn’t solve the problem, he would eliminate the person who caused the problem.

After that, Qin Yu also stood up and left the tavern.

He was not in a hurry to return to his accommodation. Instead, he wandered around Divine Fortuity City.

“I remember in the map my father left behind, Divine Fortuity City used to have Big Graves. It was also because of this that Divine Fortuity City was so barren. Even with countless magical artifacts, it still could not develop,” Qin Yu thought to himself. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Such a place naturally had the remnants of an incredibly terrifying internal qi.

If he could use the formation to outline the dao technique of heaven and earth, there was a possibility of winning to a certain extent.

However, currently, Qin Yu did not have much understanding of formation. Thus he returned to his accommodation and began to search for formations.

Qin Yu’s father was a Guardian, so he was tremendously proficient in formation. There were countless of them left in Qin Yu’s mind.

There were countless formation blueprints in Qin Yu’s mind. The most suitable one was the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation.

The Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation was a kind of formation that complemented and countered the yin and yang of heaven and earth. It had tremendously powerful defensive and offensive capabilities.

The core of the formation was the nine palaces and eight trigrams. Specific magical artifacts and spells needed to be set up in each palace.

To successfully activate the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Formation, at least three formation masters were required to operate it together to unleash its greatest power.

However, it was clearly unrealistic to find three formation masters in Divine Fortuity City. If Qin Yu activated the formation by himself, the power he could unleash would not be enough to kill Elder Si.

After hesitating for a while, Qin Yu began to search for other formations.

Formations were not rare to Guardians. Therefore countless formations were left in Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu hesitated in his heart for a while. In the end, he decided to choose a more aggressive formation, the Endless Killing Formation.

The Endless Killing Formation was a tremendously cruel formation that could kill all the living beings within. It was very powerful.

Qin Yu knew that choosing this formation meant he would have to pay an enormous price. However, he also knew this was the only method he could use. If he could get rid of Elder Si, he could save Xiao Hai’s and his lives.

Thus Qin Yu began to search for information on the Endless Killing Formation.

After searching, he finally found some information about the Endless Killing Formation. It required 108 formation cores, each requiring a weapon that was at least a high-grade magical artifact.

These weapons had to pierce into the formation cores instantly to activate the formation successfully.

Moreover, these 108 weapons had to have similar attributes. Otherwise, the formation could not unleash its greatest power.

Qin Yu sighed in his heart. Such conditions were indeed very harsh.

Fortunately, he was in Divine Fortuity City. As long as he had money, he could find enough magical artifacts.

Qin Yu counted the spirit coins in his hand and could not help but sigh.

D*mn it! The money he had painstakingly saved up was probably going to be spent again.

“As long as I can kill Elder Si, everything will be worth it.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Just as he got up and was about to go out to look for the magical artifact, Qin Yu suddenly felt two strange internal qis approaching.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. Then he thought to himself, “These two internal qis… seem a little familiar.”

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu decided to remain silent.

He was lacking magical artifacts right now. If someone really came to cause trouble, he would save money.

Thus Qin Yu stood up and walked out of her accommodation. Then he deliberately walked toward a sparsely populated area.

Divine Fortuity City wasn’t big. After coming out of the city, it was no longer as lively as before. Instead, it was desolate.

At a glance, the surrounding desolation made one’s heart feel cold. No one seemed to be willing to stay in such a place.

However, Qin Yu walked to the place and stopped in his tracks. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Are you still not coming out?”

Soon after he finished speaking, two figures walked out from the darkness.

Qin Yu raised his head and saw two elderly men walking out. These two elderly men were tall and had deep eyes. They emitted a fierce aura that made people feel they could not be offended.

These two people were no strangers to Qin Yu because they were the attendants of the young man he had met in the magical artifact shop not long ago.

“Your divine sense is very sharp,” one of the elderly men said indifferently.

“Why did you two follow me to this desolate place?” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“Hehe! I am an elder of the Chu family. I have come under the orders of the young lord of the Chu family, Chu Sheng, to ask for something from you,” one of the elderly men said with a fake smile.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, sneered, and said, “Chu Sheng? Your young lord is indeed good at naming.”

Hearing this, the expressions of the two elderly men instantly turned cold.

“Sir, please mind your words. Our young lord doesn’t like people to make fun of his name,” one of the elderly men berated.

...

“What does his liking have to do with me?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Seeing Qin Yu’s unyielding attitude, the elders of the Chu family did not stand on ceremony and said directly, “You should know what we want.”

“Oh? Is that so?” Qin Yu smiled. “Then may I ask, why should I give that magical artifact to you?”

“It’s best if you don’t play with our patience,” the other elder of the Chu family said coldly. “We don’t want to fight. But if you don’t hand over the item, we don’t mind taking it by force.”

Qin Yu’s eye expression became sharp. He could feel the internal qis of these two elderly men tremendously extraordinary. Obviously, they were both top-notch martial artists with high cultivation.

However, Qin Yu was not afraid. As long as they were Semi-Saints, he could kill them all!
