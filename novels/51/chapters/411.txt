“He came to Yunchuan City?” When Cao Shan heard this, he immediately sat up from his chair.

He waved his hand, indicating for these women to leave.

Then, he slowly stood up and walked to the window.

“What is he doing in Yunchuan City?” Cao Shan’s brows were tightly furrowed.

“Could he have come for us? As far as I know, Qin Yu seems to have killed more than a dozen peak Inner Strength Grandmasters!” Cao Hu said in a deep voice.

Cao Shan didn’t speak for a while.

Although he was a bit worried, he still firmly believed that Qin Yu was all hype.

The so-called killing of more than a dozen Inner Strength Grandmasters was also nonsense. It was just to romanticize him.

“If he really came for us, I would have to welcome him,” Cao Shan said with a cold smile.

With the Cao family’s current strength, they could summon ten Inner Strength Grandmasters at most.

Among them, only five were at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, and they were still far from the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm in Jingdu.

But in Cao Shan’s eyes, this was enough.

Just as Cao Shan was thinking, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

“Master, there’s someone outside who wants to see you,” a man dressed like a butler bowed and said.

“Someone wants to see me? Who is it?” Cao Shan asked.

The butler said, “I don’t know him. He said he’s here to help you.”

“Help me?” Cao Shan raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but smile coldly.

“Interesting.” Cao Shan stroked his beard and smiled. Then he got up and walked into the living room.

There was a man sitting in the living room.

This man’s internal qi had been concealed, so he looked no different from an ordinary person.

Cao Shan looked at him and asked, “Who are you?”

The other party was the first to stand up. He cupped his hands to Cao Shan and then went straight to the point, “Qin Yu is here.”

Cao Shan sneered. “Is that what you want to tell me?”

The other party continued, “Qin Yu is here to kill you.”

When Cao Shan heard this, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Kill me? Does he have the ability?! This is simply nonsense! If he wants to use me as a springboard, he has to see if he has the ability or not!”

The other party looked coldly at Cao Shan and said, “Mr. Cao, it would be a piece of cake for Qin Yu to kill you.”

These words infuriated Cao Shan!

“Do you know what you’re saying?!” Cao Shan shouted angrily.

The other party was neither anxious nor impatient as he said coldly, “Let alone you, even I don’t have the confidence to defeat Qin Yu.”

“Oh really? You mean you’re above me?” Cao Shan’s internal qi suddenly exploded as a surging murderous aura burst!

“That’s right.” The other party wasn’t scared by Cao Shan at all. Instead, he was extremely calm.

Cao Shan sneered. “Then let me get a taste of your abilities!”

After saying that, Cao Shan clenched his fist and raised it. Waves of roars sounded!

“Whoosh!”

Cao Shan’s two fists were wrapped with qi energy and headed straight for the other party’s vital point!

It was this powerful punch that was easily caught by the other party!

The other party only raised his hand to block Cao Shan’s punch!

“Oh really?” Cao Shan’s expression changed. He was about to counterattack, but it was already too late!

The other party opened his mouth slightly, and a seal that looked like a landscape painting flew out with a rumble!

This divine seal condensed in midair, and an ancient internal qi spread out! It was the internal qi of ancient times!

In an instant, Cao Shan’s entire body was unable to move. His body seemed to be sealed, and he was pressed to the ground!

“Ah!!”

Cao Shan raised his head and roared furiously. He attempted to struggle, but the divine seal that was pressing down on his body didn’t move at all!

“It’s useless. You won’t be able to break free,” the other party said coldly.

Cao Shan realized how terrifying this divine seal was. Hence, he gave up resisting and asked coldly, “Who are you people?”

The other party said indifferently, “I’m Hong Yi Sect’s elder, Xiao Cheng.”

“Hong Yi Sect?” When he heard this, Cao Shan’s expression suddenly changed!

Although this organization had left Pyro for many years, it had still left behind quite a number of legends!

It was said that when they were evacuating Pyro, they had taken countless treasures, including all sorts of herbs, divine artifacts, martial arts techniques, and so on! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

And this organization has always been a headache for Pyro, because they were so elusive and mysterious.

“Hong Yi Sect... you’re not afraid that I’ll hand you over to the officials?” Cao Shan sneered.

Xiao Cheng said, “Mr. Cao is a smart man. I believe you won’t do so.”

“Oh really?” Cao Shan raised an eyebrow and continued to say, “I would like to hear where your confidence comes from.”

Xiao Cheng looked at Cao Shan and said in a cold voice, “This will be a mutually beneficial deal. I can not only save your life, but also help you get rid of Qin Yu, your enemy.”

“When you kill Qin Yu and go claim credit from the Yan family, I believe that the Yan family will give you a higher reward than the officials will.”

Cao Shan was silent for a moment before he laughed coldly and said, “Alright, you have convinced me, but I’m not sure why you won’t personally make a move?”

Xiao Cheng shook his head and said, “Our organization has recently been targeted by Pyro’s officials, so we don’t dare to be too high profile.”

“Alright.” Cao Shan no longer hesitated. “Then what do you need me to do?”

Xiao Cheng said coldly, “Before I kill Qin Yu, I want to take something from him.”

“The Meridian Circulation Technique?” Cao Shan guessed.

Xiao Cheng nodded and said, “This is only one of them. I have something more important.”

The “more important thing” that Xiao Cheng had mentioned was Qin Yu’s body!

The allure of the chaotic body was far greater than the Meridian Circulation Technique!

The two of them hit it off and immediately came to an agreement.

At this moment, Qin Yu had just gotten off the plane.

His first purpose for coming to Yunchuan City this time was to kill Cao Shan and avenge Yan Jiang.

The second purpose was that Qin Yu wanted to head south from the north!

Ever since the Yan family had made an announcement on the Martial Arts Forum, almost all the sects in the north had taken the initiative to attend the Yan family’s banquet.

It was probably unrealistic for Qin Yu to interfere.

Therefore, Qin Yu set his sights on the southern martial arts world.

There wasn’t much time left for Qin Yu, so he had to act as soon as possible.

“Let’s start with your Cao family.” Qin Yu’s gaze was cold and as piercing as the cold wind in December.
