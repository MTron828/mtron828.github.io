Chapter 1515: Chapter 1,515: black clouds bearing down on the city

The deputy sect master wasn’t surprised by everyone’s ridicule. He had already expected this scene.

In reality, the deputy sect master’s understanding of the heavenly cloud sect far surpassed that of the first elder.

Of course, he knew about the internal and external troubles of the Heavenly Cloud sect. He had long known about the ambitions of the eternal limit city.

But even so, the deputy sect leader still gave the order to resist the northern lands.

This kind of spirit was worthy of praise.

“Deputy sect leader, what do you think we should do now? If it really doesn’t work, we’ll run away,”someone mocked.

“In such a short time, it’s too late even if we pull them back.”

“TSK TSK, I didn’t expect that the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s many years of wealth would be destroyed by your hands.”

At this moment, the deputy sect master suddenly slammed the table and stood up.

He coldly glanced at the crowd and said four words, “Fight with all your might!”

“Fight with all your might? That’s easy for you to say.”Someone sneered.

“The foundation of the Heavenly Cloud sect has been taken away by you. How can the few of US resist Yongji?”

“The three madmen and three absolutes are not just for show. Even the sect master will give them some face, not to mention that Yongji still has so many people under him.”

......

The deputy sect master said in a deep voice, “This is the calamity of the Heavenly Cloud sect. We should work together to get through it. At the same time, I will pull people back. As long as everyone can resist it...”

“Resist it? hahaha! I want to see how you resist it!”An elder said with a sneer.

The deputy sect master knew that resisting was not an easy task, but there was no other way now.

He immediately formulated a strategy and activated the Tianyun sect’s mountain protection formation.

Then, the deputy sect master crushed the token and asked the eighteen gods and the elites of the Tianyun sect to return to the Tianyun sect as soon as possible.

All of this was within Yongji’s calculations.

Even if the Tianyun sect returned, it would definitely be too late.

The Tianyun sect was located in the center of the Southern Region. It was very far away from the northern lands. It would take at least ten days to half a month to return.

After ten days to half a month, the heavenly cloud sect would most likely become history!

As for the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect, he would most likely join forces with the northern lands and attack together.

...

The next morning, the world was silent.

But everyone knew that this was the calm before the storm.

Many people had already gathered near the heavenly cloud sect.

These people were not ordinary people. They had rushed here not just to watch the battle, but to stand on their side.

If there were any signs of defeat, they would take action and help the Heavenly Cloud sect suppress Yongji, and vice versa.

On the other side, Qin Yu was still absorbing the dark energy.

Boundless dark energy entered his body, and his body began to slowly become balanced.

With Qin Yu’s current state of mind, it was not a problem for him to step into the Almighty Realm. He just needed time.

The dark energy in the mausoleum was like a river flowing into the sea, endlessly flowing.

Looking from afar, one could see a strange scene:

Qin Yu’s body was wrapped in white qi. The hair on his body was already frozen, as if he had been frozen stiff.

Just as Qin Yu was cultivating in seclusion, someone suddenly rushed to the mausoleum.

And the person who came was none other than Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing stood on top of the mausoleum and shouted, “Brother Qin!”

Although his voice wasn’t loud, it was close to divine sense.

“Brother Qin!”

Zhuo Jing shouted again. Under this shout, Qin Yu, who was in seclusion, slowly opened his eyes.

He looked up into the sky and saw Zhuo Jing rushing over. He couldn’t help but frown.

“Why is he here?”Qin Yu’s expression didn’t look too good.

Zhuo Jing had probably seen the scene of his cultivation clearly just now. This wasn’t good news for Qin Yu.

“Brother Zhuo, why are you here?”Qin Yu stood up from the ground and slowly walked out.

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “I have something to tell you.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He looked at Zhuo Jing and said in a low voice, “Brother Zhuo, don’t you have anything you want to ask?”

Zhuo jing laughed and said, “To be honest, I really want to ask, but if you don’t want to tell me, it’s okay.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

As expected, he still found out.

“Brother Qin, you won’t choose to silence me, right?”Zhuo Jing said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

Qin Yu shook his head and explained, “I cultivate both yin and yang. Whether it’s spiritual Qi or dark energy, I can absorb them all.”

“Chaotic body?”

Zhuo Jing asked in surprise.

Qin Yu was even more surprised. “You know about chaotic body?”

Zhuo Jing said in a low voice, “I’ve heard of it. Rumor has it that it’s one of the most powerful physiques in the world, but I’ve never seen it before. I really didn’t expect brother Qin to have a chaotic body.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “You also know that cultivating dark energy can easily lead to misunderstandings, so i...”

“No worries.”Zhuo Jing waved his hand. “Brother Qin, if news of your chaotic body gets out, it will attract many sects.”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Forget it. Let’s get down to business. Brother Zhuo, why are you looking for me?”

Zhuo Jing grunted and then said seriously, “Yongji made a move against the Heavenly Cloud sect today.”

“Yongji?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be shocked.

He never expected that the first person to make a move would be Yongji!

“Yongji has gathered almost everyone and has set off for the Heavenly Cloud Sect,”Zhuo Jing said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Brother Qin, do you want to take the opportunity to make a move?”

Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered, “To be honest, I do have this idea, but... it’s still too early. No one can guarantee that the heavenly cloud sect doesn’t have any backup plans.”

“Many people have the same idea.”Zhuo Jing nodded slightly.

“I reckon that it won’t be long before the northern lands makes a move.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Looks like I have to speed up the progress...”

Zhuo Jing could not help but sigh, “Everyone seems to want to witness the end of a sect.”

The collapse of tall buildings was usually a scene of sighs.

Qin Yu said with a smile, “Brother Zhuo, thank you for telling me this news from afar.”

Zhuo Jing shook his head and said, “Brother Qin, you are too polite.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and then said, “I still have to cultivate, so I won’t talk much. I believe that it won’t be long before I step into the mighty realm.”

“At that time, I will personally go to the battlefield and send the Tianyun sect on its final journey.”

“With Brother Qin’s abilities, if you step into the mighty realm, no one in the entire southern prefecture would be able to defeat you.”Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but sigh.

Following that, Zhuo Jing bowed and said, “Then I Won’t disturb you any further. I’ll wait for Your Good News.”

Following that, Zhuo Jing didn’t stay any longer and immediately planned to leave.

“Oh right, Brother Zhuo, I wonder if I can borrow your treasured sword for a while?”Qin Yu suddenly called out to Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing was silent for a moment before he finally nodded and agreed, “Okay!”

“Thank you.”Qin Yu bowed again.

Zhuo Jing didn’t say anything else and immediately left the mausoleum.

At the same time, Yongji had already led a large group of people and rushed to the vicinity of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

At a glance, the sky was a dense mass of black clouds, like a huge cloud drifting over from the distance.

“The Black Cloud is trying to destroy the city.”Someone whispered.
