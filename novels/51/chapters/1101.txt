Chapter 1102: Chapter 1102, facing off against an acquaintance 

Chu hedao nodded and said, “I’ve investigated the Immortal Massacre sect before. There are many Daoist halls in this world.”

“Although these Daoist halls have already collapsed, there are still some traces of internal Qi.”

“These internal Qi are extremely similar to Xiao Yuan’s.”

Qin Yu’s expression didn’t look too good.

Although the Immortal Massacre Sect was the number one sect back then, they were definitely not good people.

They had absorbed a large number of warriors’divine sense and turned it into their own power. This kind of behavior was something that could be punished.

“If he really obtained the immortal slaying sect’s inheritance, then we really have to be careful of him,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Chu hedao nodded and said, “Although the Sky Blood Rainbow claims to be the immortal slaying sect’s successor, the number of inheritances he obtained is extremely small.”

“Regarding the secret techniques of the immortal slaying sect, he only has the one that absorbs the divine sense of warriors, as well as the bones of dozens of mighty figures.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Apart from that, have you seen him use any other secret techniques?”

Qin Yu shook his head.

Just as Chu Hedao said, he had indeed never used any secret techniques of the immortal slaying sect.

“Of course, all of this is just my guess,”Chu Hedao said.

“Xiao Yuan hasn’t done anything out of the ordinary. We can’t do anything to him. We just have to be careful of him.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand, brother Chu. Thank you.”

Chu Hedao said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, please keep it a secret and don’t let anyone else know.”

“Don’t worry.”Qin Yu nodded.

Chu Hedao extended his palm and the space secret technique followed.

He didn’t stay any longer and turned to leave.

Looking at Chu Hedao’s back, Qin Yu couldn’t help but stroke his chin.

This Chu Hedao wasn’t simple either.

Although he kept a low profile, he was extremely talented. Thinking back to the first time he met him, his strength wasn’t even worth mentioning. Now, he had already far surpassed his older brother, Chu Heng.

The next day.

Everyone gathered on the deck.

In the distance, the outline of an island was faintly discernible.

This island was wrapped in thick fog, making it look like a fairyland.

“That should be Cloud Dragon Island,”Qin Yu said.

“That’s right. It doesn’t look dangerous,”Chang Mang muttered.

“The real danger zones are often well hidden,”Yao Meng said.

The ship sailed toward Cloud Dragon Island, getting closer and closer.

When there were only a few hundred meters left, Qin Yu found the captain and said, “Your Ship will stop here. We will set off for home in three days.”

At this time, Gong Tianyu ran over.

He smiled embarrassedly and said, “Mr. Qin, Can I come with you?”

“No.”Qin Yu refused without thinking.

Gong Tianyu said hurriedly, “I promise I won’t give you any trouble. I...”

“I Said No.”Qin Yu interrupted Gong Tianyu.

Zhuang Teng walked over and said with a smile, “Young Master Gong, this Cloud Dragon Island is not a place for pleasure. Danger is everywhere. Even we can’t guarantee our own safety. Let’s go back quickly.”

Gong Tianyu could only give up when he saw this.

The boat turned around and left. Qin Yu and the others stepped on the water surface and rushed toward the Cloud Dragon Island.

More than ten people successfully landed on the Cloud Dragon Island.

This island was not as dangerous as they had imagined. On the contrary, the island was full of flowers and green grass. It looked like a paradise.

“Are those flowers the strange flowers?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Yao Meng smiled and said, “If the strange flowers could be found so easily, this cloud dragon island would have been emptied long ago.”

Qin Yu nodded and released his divine sense, covering almost the entire Cloud Dragon Island.

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that there seemed to be nothing strange about this Cloud Dragon Island. He could not even feel the slightest flow of internal Qi.

“That’s strange. Could it be that those rumors are false?”Qin Yu frowned and said.

“It’s better to be careful,”Yao Meng said.

The group of people carefully walked towards the Cloud Dragon Island. After a few steps, the sound of cracking could be heard from under Zhuang Teng’s feet.

When they looked down, they saw that a piece of skull had been crushed by him.

“It’s a skeleton.”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

There were many skeletons nearby, and each of them was almost weathered. This was enough to prove that these bones had been on the island for many years.

“These bones seem to be the remains of a martial saint,”Kong Yun said in a deep voice.

As he spoke, the surrounding fog seemed to have become much thicker.

This fog had almost blocked everyone’s line of sight. Their visibility was less than five meters.

The sudden appearance of the fog made everyone feel uneasy.

“Everyone, be careful. Don’t get separated,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Okay,”someone replied.

Qin Yu walked at the front, walking forward carefully.

His body was emitting golden light, and his mind was tense. He was afraid that something bad would happen to him.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, an arrow-like light shot toward Qin Yu. Its speed was extremely fast. Even though Qin Yu was tense, he was still scratched by this light!

What shocked Qin Yu was that this ray of light actually directly grazed Qin Yu’s body.

A trace of fresh blood flowed down his chest.

“Drip!”

The fresh blood fell to the ground and quickly disappeared. After that, a series of shaking sounds came from the surroundings. In a short moment, several figures appeared in front of Qin Yu!

“Be careful!”Qin Yu hurriedly shouted!

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that no one responded to him!

He turned around and found that there was no one behind him!

“What... What’s going on?”Qin Yu’s face couldn’t help but change.

They were clearly beside him just now. How did they suddenly disappear?

The fog was filled with a murderous aura and the smell of blood. Those figures slowly appeared and walked toward Qin Yu.

With a closer look, they realized that these figures were Chang Mang, Yao Meng, and the others!

“Why did you guys suddenly run over there?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

However, no one responded to him. Their faces were ice-cold as they walked towards Qin Yu Step by step!
