Chapter 534: Ruoxue, I’ve Finally Seen You Again Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

,

Their eyes met. Qin Yu, who had always been tenacious and unyielding, couldn’t hold it in any longer.

Every time he faced Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu was like a child.

He pulled Yan Ruoxue over and suppressed the emotions in his heart. He tried his best to remain calm and said, “I’m fine. It’s good to see you again.”

“Me too,” Yan Ruoxue said in a low voice.

The sudden change stunned everyone present.

Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu... seemed to have feelings for each other?

Above, Han Wei was livid with anger as he clenched his fists tightly!

Han Meng’s expression was even uglier!

In front of so many people, this was simply humiliating the Han family!

“Pull them apart,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Around them, someone immediately approached.

Yan Ruoxue glanced at them coldly, and they immediately froze on the spot.

“No matter what, you are the most important. You have to protect yourself.” Yan Ruoxue stood on her tiptoes and patted Qin Yu’s head lightly.

Qin Yu couldn’t hold himself back for a moment.

He took a deep breath, then clenched his fist and said, “Ruoxue, wait for me. I will take you out of Jingdu today.”

“Okay, I’ll wait for you,” Yan Ruoxue said seriously.

“Miss Yan.” The people of the Yan family walked to Yan Ruoxue’s side quickly.

Yan Ruoxue glanced at Qin Yu. Then, she followed the two people and slowly walked into the villa.

Qin Yu’s eyes kept staring at Yan Ruoxue’s back.

The longing in his heart completely exploded at this moment!

“Han Wei!”

Qin Yu roared! The terrifying inner strength rushed toward Han Wei! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Han Wei also said in a cold voice, “Qin Yu, You d*mn b*stard!”

“The one who should die is you.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said.

Yan Sihai, who was at the side, said coldly, “Qin Yu, how dare you challenge the Yan family’s power?”

“Yan Sihai, you deserve to die even more.” Qin Yu gnashed his teeth and said.

“For the sake of benefits, you well-dressed beasts in disguise can disregard anything.”

“Yan Ruoxue doesn’t like Han Wei at all. Don’t you know that!?”

“Why must you force Yan Ruoxue and Han Wei to be together?! You are already rich enough, so why are you greedy for more?!”

When Yan Sihai heard this, he immediately slammed the table and stood up!

He pointed at Qin Yu and said, “What nonsense are you spouting?!”

“You know d*mn well what I’m talking about! You scumbag!” Qin Yu cursed loudly.

In front of so many people, Yan Sihai was scolded by Qin Yu. Naturally, he felt humiliated.

“Qin Yu, that’s enough.” At this moment, Yan Yongxiu, who was sitting next to Yan Sihai, coughed.

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Yongxiu and sneered. “Yan Yongxiu, I originally thought that you were a gentleman, but in the end, you’re a coward!”

“When we first met, you kept saying that you were doing this for Ruoxue, but in the end?”

“The result was that you watched Yan Sihai push your daughter into living h*ll. Are you worthy of being her father?”

Yan Yongxiu’s expression changed. He berated, “Qin Yu, why are you like a mad dog? You bite anyone you see!”

“Am I wrong?” Qin Yu sneered.

“You let Yan Sihai turn Ruoxue into a tool. You aren’t worthy of being a father.”

“You knew that Old Mister Yan wasn’t dead, but you didn’t dare to say anything. You son’t deserve to be his son either.”

“If you weren’t Ruoxue’s father, I would have scolded you a long time ago! You b*stard, you don’t even know how much of a scumbag you are.”

The crowd was silent.

“Gulp.”

Someone silently swallowed hard.

“Is what Qin Yu said true?”

“He said that Old Mister Yan isn’t dead? What does that mean?”

“Qin Yu is a sharp-tongued kid. He doesn’t panic at all when facing an aristocratic family like the Yan family. I have to say, he has quite some guts.”

Above, Yan Sihai said coldly, “What nonsense are you spouting? Do you think you have the right to decide the affairs of our family?”

“I told you that Yan Ruoxue will definitely marry Han Wei! You can’t stop it, nor can you change our thoughts!”

Qin Yu sneered. “I have never thought of changing your minds. I only need to kill Han Wei.”

“How arrogant!” Han Wei couldn’t hold it in anymore!

He took a step forward, and his whole body was filled with energy!

“Qin Yu, this isn’t the place for you to talk nonsense!” Han Wei said coldly.

“Kill me? Do you think you are capable enough to do so? I will stomp you to death like an ant!”

“Okay, then try it!” Qin Yu’s internal qi also exploded at this moment!

The collision of the two internal qi immediately caused a hurricane!

The surrounding people, afraid of being affected, couldn’t help but move the dining table backward!

A large empty space was opened up at the scene.

A great battle was about to break out!

At this moment, a car drove in.

There were a few big words written on the car: Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

When the car stopped, they saw a group of reporters with cameras running out of the car.

“They’re finally here.” Han Wei took a deep breath.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, it’s time for you to die.”

Qin Yu clenched his fist and said, “I can’t wait to see you lower your arrogant head.”

“Is that so?” Han Wei narrowed his eyes and sneered. “If I can trample you once, I can trample you countless times!”

He was obviously mocking their first meeting.

Qin Yu sneered. “Han Wei, you will regret not killing me back then.”

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his head and looked at a window in the villa.

Yan Ruoxue was watching this scene.

Qin Yu faced the direction of the window and revealed a confident smile.

Han Wei naturally noticed this scene. He followed Qin Yu’s gaze and turned around to look at the window. After that, his expression couldn’t help but darken.

“Qin Yu, I will trample you in front of Yan Ruoxue!” Han Wei said coldly.

“I will let her know how bad her taste in men is!”

Accompanied by Han Wei’s angry roar, the energy in his body instantly exploded and he threw a punch at Qin Yu!

“Come on, let me see just how capable you are as a young master of an aristocratic family!” Qin Yu also roared angrily!

His body was covered with golden light and he threw a fierce punch!
