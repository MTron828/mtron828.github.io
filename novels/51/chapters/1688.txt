Chapter 1689: Chapter 1689, Xiao Sheng V s internal Qi! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This aura shocked everyone!

Could it be that Xiao Sheng had already stepped into the reversion void stage? ! Could it be that everyone had misjudged his strength? !

Even Qin Yu began to doubt it.

How could such a powerful internal Qi be emitted from a mighty figure? This simply didn’t make sense!

Xiao Sheng looked coldly at Zhao Jing and said, “If I step into the return to void stage, do you have the qualifications to talk to me?”

What? He hadn’t stepped into the return to void stage at all! He was really only at the level of a mighty figure!

But how could this internal Qi be so powerful?

Feeling the battle intent gushing out of Xiao Sheng’s body, Qin Yu seemed to see that Xiao Sheng who had fought everywhere in a daze, that self-confident, battle intent, and even arrogant Xiao Sheng!

This was completely different from Xiao Sheng who was discussing dao on the cultivation mountain. It was even impossible to associate him with the same person!

Zhao Jing’s expression was somewhat ugly, but he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

“As long as he hasn’t stepped into the return to void stage, he is definitely not my match. Definitely!”Zhao Jing said coldly.

After saying this, he looked at Xiao Sheng and said, “Today, no matter what stage you are at, you will only die!”

After saying this, Zhao Jing took the lead to attack!

His Skinny Fist held all the DAO technique in the world and headed straight for Xiao Sheng!

At this moment, everything was making way for this punch of his. Although it was just an ordinary punch, it was usually able to determine the victor in an instant for someone of this State!

This was a fist that had reached the great success stage of the DAO technique. It was definitely not as simple as it looked!

Xiao Sheng did not dodge. With a jolt of his feet, tens of thousands of rays of light rose up!

These rays of light seemed to have come with him. As they listened to his movements, they lingered on his arms and exploded with an extremely powerful strength.

“Bang!”

The second collision of the two fists destroyed everything. Even the formation master’s formation could not do it. The Heavenly Cloud sect was instantly reduced to ruins!

This collision was too terrifying. It seemed like it was going to sweep through everything in the world! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qin Yu and the others hurriedly pushed back. In such a big battle, the slightest carelessness could turn them into cannon fodder!

Zhao Jing didn’t gain any benefits. Even though he had an overwhelming advantage in cultivation, he was still unable to defeat Xiao Sheng!

“Why is this Xiao Sheng so terrifying?”Zhao Jing thought to himself.

Before he could figure it out, Xiao Sheng had already made his move.

He raised his jade-like hand and smacked it in Zhao Jing’s direction.

All of the DAO technique paved the way, and all of the rules were retreating!

This palm seemed to have come from ancient times, and the power it contained was simply unimaginable!

Zhao Jing roared and spat out a golden lotus from his mouth to protect himself. Then, he clasped his hands together and smacked it forward.

“Clang!”

The Golden Lotus was instantly shattered by Xiao Sheng’s jade-like hands. Zhao Jing was knocked back repeatedly.

However, the power that he used was formed by Xiao Sheng’s single hand. He activated the Rashomon and disappeared without a trace!

“Rashomon!”

Zhao Jing’s face turned cold. He couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

Of course, he knew how terrifying the Rashomon was. He just didn’t expect that Xiao Sheng had improved again.

“I really underestimated you.”Zhao Jing tidied up his clothes and said coldly.

“If that’s the case, then I…”

But before he could finish his words, Xiao Sheng struck out with his palm again.

Tens of thousands of rays of light moved along with him. They were like 100,000 heavenly soldiers. They covered the sky and covered the earth. There was nowhere to hide!

Zhao Jing’s pupils suddenly shrank. He shouted loudly. Rays of light burst out from his thin and small body and enveloped him like a barrier.

“Xiao Sheng, you don’t know martial virtue!”Zhao Jing could not help but curse!

However, Xiao Sheng could not be bothered to waste his breath on him. His moves were sharp and domineering, not giving him any chance to catch his breath.

Zhao Jing did not dare to be distracted, nor did he dare to preserve any of his energy. All of his spells were displayed in an instant, causing the battle to turn white-hot in an instant!

Qin Yu and the rest stood extremely far away, so far that it was almost impossible to see clearly.

If not for Qin Yu having the desolate God’s eye, he would only be able to see clusters of fog.

His eyes were fixed in that direction, and the shock on his face was becoming more and more obvious.

“Qin Yu, how is it? is the sect master doing anything?”The deputy sect master asked anxiously from the side.

Qin Yu did not have the mood to pay attention to him. He looked at Xiao Sheng, who was in the middle of the battlefield. He did not even dare to Blink, afraid that he would miss something!

Xiao Sheng’s fearsomeness far exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

Although many years had passed, Qin Yu seemed to have seen the scene of the Xiao family and his brothers conquering the world back then!

He was too powerful. Every move of his was an extremely powerful battle force that was as simple as the Great Dao. It was a display of extreme killing intent!

Even when facing a person at the reversion void stage, he was still not at a disadvantage. The battle intent and pride on his body did not diminish in the slightest!

There were people in the dark who were watching this scene coldly. Their hearts sank to the bottom of the valley at this moment.

They originally thought that they would crush him, but they did not expect that Zhao Jing would not be able to gain any benefits at all!

On the contrary, that Xiao Sheng appeared to be at ease. His methods were both elegant and overbearing, and his power was endless!

“How terrifying. Xiao Sheng is only in the mighty realm, yet he can actually be on par with a reversion void stage cultivator.”

“That’s right. If he were to step into the reversion void stage, God knows how terrifying he would be!”

“It’s hard to say who will win or lose this battle.”

The battle had attracted the attention of almost all the experts in the southern region!

It had been too long since they had seen Xiao Sheng make a move. They had already forgotten how terrifying he had been when he had ruled over them back then!

Such a method made people feel despair!

Qin Yu stared at the battlefield and could not help but clench his fists.

“Xiao Sheng can really do it…”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

“Is this the chosen of the Holy Region?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a trace of pressure.

Fighting across realms was nothing for the Chosen of the holy region, but fighting across such a large realm was too terrifying.

The battlefield had already been turned into ruins, and the heavenly cloud sect was probably going to rebuild after the battle.

Zhao Jing became more and more flustered as he fought. Xiao Sheng’s moves seemed simple, but they were as watertight as an iron bucket. He could not find any flaws at all!

Just like Xiao Hai, he did not have any complicated moves or spells. He relied entirely on his comprehension of the Great Dao.

It was clearly just a palm that was slapping over, but it was also ever-changing and impossible to catch up to!

“Bang!”

Finally, Zhao Jing was distracted for a moment, and Xiao Sheng’s palm was like an ocean that blotted out the sky and covered the earth, instantly sending him flying!

Zhao Jing took a few steps back before he stabilized his body. He suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood!

Seeing this scene, everyone could not help but be shocked!

Xiao Sheng actually gained an advantage! This was simply too terrifying!

Zhao Jing seemed to feel extremely humiliated. He could not help but explode in anger. He glared at Xiao Sheng and shouted, “Xiao Sheng, you’re going too far!”

Xiao Sheng looked at Zhao Jing coldly and said, “Are you angry because you are incompetent?”

Zhao Jing was stunned. Then, he roared angrily, “I am at the reversion void stage. How can I lose to you! Xiao Sheng, today I will let you know how terrifying the reversion void stage is!”
