Chapter 1341: Chapter 1,341, The Shocking Wen Wanyi 

“Wen da!”

Qin Yu’s face was pale. He anxiously pushed towards Wen Da, but it was already too late.

That palm directly pressed towards Wen da!

Qin Yu felt despair in her heart, and that almighty expert broke out in cold sweat!

If this palm landed on Wen Da’s body, it would probably instantly take his life!

At that time, Wen Wanji would definitely not let him off!

“Buzz!”

Just as this palm was about to land on Wen Da’s body, a ray of light lit up.

After that, an old figure materialized and blocked in front of Wen Da.

Although this figure was quite old, he was full of bandit aura. His face was full of fierce meat, and one look was enough to tell that he was not to be trifled with.

“Grandfather!”

Seeing this phantom, Big Wen instantly heaved a sigh of relief.

And the expression of the almighty in front of him changed. Without even thinking, he hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Greetings, senior wen...”

Wen Wanli glanced at him, then turned his head to look at Big Wen.

“F * ck, take a look and see if it’s already exceeded the time limit!”Wen Wanli’s mouth made people’s jaws drop.

The words he said did not match his identity as an expert at all.

Qin Yu could not help but be stunned.

Was this really an expert that even the Heavenly Cloud Sect was afraid of? Why... Why did it not seem to be in tune?

“Aiya, isn’t it delayed?”Wen Da muttered.

“That’s right, that’s right. It’s all their fault. They stopped us from leaving and even attacked Wen da just now!”Wen Er added fuel to the fire.

Hearing this, Wen Wanji’s old face darkened. He turned around and looked at the nearly one hundred people in front of him.

“Oh, this is Gu City,”Wen Wanji said to himself.

Hearing this, that Almighty immediately broke out in sweat.

He hurriedly knelt on the ground and said in a trembling voice, “Senior, you... you misunderstood. The one we want to catch is this Qin Yu. Just... just now was just an accidental injury...”

“Accident?”The veins on Wen Wanyun’s face bulged. He then scolded, “I accidentally injured your grandpa! You F * cking nearly killed my precious grandson? I’ll kill you!”

That Almighty was so scared that his entire body trembled. He didn’t dare to say a single word.

“Just you wait. Tomorrow, I’ll come to Gu City and have a chat with your city lord,”Wen Wanyun said with a cold expression.

“Don’t... Don’t. Senior, this... This is really a misunderstanding...”that mighty figure even wanted to die. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wen wanyun still wanted to say something, but Wen da waved his hand and said, “Forget it. Spare his life. Grandfather, we have to hurry back.”

“Qin Yu, let’s go.”Wen Da pulled Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent and turned around to leave.

But at this time, that almighty hurriedly said, “Senior, senior, please hand this Qin Yu over to us...”

Wen Wenzi’s old face darkened. He gritted his teeth and said, “You F * cking dare to bargain with me, right?”

“He... He and your grandson have only just gotten to know each other. You Don’t have to protect him...”that Almighty said with a trembling voice.

“F * cking bullshit!”Big Wen jumped up and gave him two slaps.

“How long have you known him? He’s a friend of mine! Don’t be so Shameless, do you understand?”Wen Da pointed at the Almighty’s nose and scolded him.

The Almighty didn’t dare to say a word. He just tried his best to hold on.

“Did you hear what my grandson said? Hurry up and make way!”Wen Wanli said impatiently.

The Almighty didn’t seem to give up. He braced himself and said, “Senior, this Qin Yu killed Ling Yun. He’s the most wanted criminal in the Tianyun sect...”

These words instantly infuriated Wen Wanli. His face instantly darkened.

“Are you using the Tianyun sect to suppress me?”Wen Wanli said coldly.

That icy cold killing intent instantly swept across the entire scene.

“No... of course not. I said something wrong. Please forgive me, Senior...”that Almighty was so frightened that his entire body was trembling.

Wen Wanli snorted coldly and said, “Just tell the Tianyun sect that I, Wen Wanli, took him away.”

After saying this, he looked at Wen Da.

Wen Da did not waste any time and pulled Qin Yu away.

This time, no one stopped them.

Qin Yu sat on the wind-chasing stallion and followed the Wen brothers into the distance.

Wen Wanji’s figure also slowly disappeared.

That almighty knelt on the ground, not daring to move.

“General, Wen Wanji has left...”only when someone reminded him did he get up from the ground.

“Damn it!”The general couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

He never thought that the cooked duck would fly away just like that.

“Should we continue chasing?”Someone asked at this time.

“Chase Your Grandpa!”The general was full of anger and had nowhere to vent it. He turned around and slapped him in the face.

“I can’t risk my life for the sake of the Tianyun sect.”

Wen Wanli was a madman. No one was willing to provoke him.

“Anyway, I’ve done what I had to do. The rest has nothing to do with me,”the general thought to himself.

How did more than a hundred people come out and return to the imperial palace.

In the main hall, the general knelt on the ground and told the city lord what had happened.

After the city lord heard it, his expression immediately became even more unsightly.

“It’s over now. Not only did I fail to curry favor with the heavenly cloud sect, but I’ve also offended Wen Wanji...”the city lord muttered in a low voice, as if he was mourning for his mother.
