Chapter 565: Not Giving In to Anyone Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s murderous internal qi wasn’t concealed, and it caused the temperature of the entire room to drop by a few degrees!

His eyes filled with pleading, Gu Canghai looked at Shen Bin, as if he was asking for help.

Shen Bin coughed and said, “Qin Yu, everything can be discussed. Perhaps Gu Canghai can give you conditions that you are satisfied with.”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Gu Canghai hurriedly nodded.

“Qin Yu, if you are willing, I can give the Saint Confucian Sect to you!”

“The Saint Confucian Sect has a Spiritual Spring in it. It will definitely be of great use to you!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If you were willing to take out the Spiritual Spring a few days ago, I would have definitely agreed to it. But now, it’s too late.”

“Because... if I kill you, the Spiritual Spring will still be mine!”

Gu Canghai gritted his teeth, stood up and said, “Qin Yu, does this mean that we really have to fight to the death?!”

“What do you think?” Qin Yu sneered.

“If I didn’t step into the Martial Marquis, would you have given me a chance?”

Gu Canghai was immediately speechless.

Now, all his hopes were placed on Shen Bin.

Thus, Gu Canghai immediately said coldly, “Don’t tell me you won’t show Mr. Shen any respect!”

Qin Yu glanced at Shen Bin and said, “Mr. Shen, are you really determined to protect him?”

Shen Bin was silent for a moment and said, “What if I say yes?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Then I’m sorry. I won’t even show respect to the Yan family, so I won’t show respect to your either!”

Hearing that, Shen Bin couldn’t help but say helplessly, “It seems that the rumors are true. You really don’t care about prestige.”

“I don’t know you to begin with. I only came today out of respect for your identity.” Qin Yu was neither servile nor overbearing.

At this point, Qin Yu paused for a moment. He looked at Shen Bin and said, “I can show you the greatest respect by not killing him in front of you.”

Shen Bin rubbed his chin and thought for a moment. Then, he looked at Gu Canghai and said, “Gu Canghai, you heard it too. I can’t do anything about this matter. He doesn’t show me any respect at all.”

Gu Canghai immediately became anxious. He said anxiously, “Mr. Shen, you must save me! Otherwise, I... I will definitely die in his hands!”

“I can’t help you even if I want to.” Shen Bin waved his hand.

Gu Canghai’s expression was extremely ugly! He sat there and didn’t say anything for a long time.

At this moment, Gu Canghai suddenly made an unexpected move!

Gu Canghai’s entire body was surging with energy. Then, he ran away!

Even Shen Bin was stunned.

The dignified Sect Master of the Saint Confucian Sect ran away just like that?!

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to chase after him. He looked at Shen Bin and said, “Speaking of which, I have to thank you.”

“Thank me? Thank me for what?” Shen Bin asked in puzzlement.

“If it wasn’t for you, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to find Gu Canghai in such a short time,” Qin Yu said.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

He stood in the small courtyard and suddenly released his divine sense!

Ever since he stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm, Qin Yu’s divine sense had become extremely powerful!

Even though Gu Canghai had already escaped for several miles, he still couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s capture!

“Gu Canghai, no one can save you today,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu turned into a golden light and quickly chased after him!

At this moment, Gu Canghai was trying his best to escape!

The surrounding people saw an old man with disheveled hair running away in a sorry state!

“Huh? What’s going on? Who’s that old man?”

“D*mn, isn’t that Gu Canghai? The Sect Master of the Saint Confucian Sect!”

“Why is he running away?”

“Look behind you! Isn’t that Qin Yu?!”

“Qin Yu? Hasn’t Gu Canghai been looking for him? What... What’s going on?”

This scene left everyone dumbstruck.

Gu Canghai, who had always been high and mighty, had suffered extreme humiliation today.

But at this moment, how could he care about his dignity?

“Gu Canghai, you can’t escape.” Qin Yu’s voice came from behind.

Gu Canghai gritted his teeth as he ran, “Qin Yu, what do you want?!”

“I said that I will definitely kill you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Gu Canghai roared angrily, “This is what the Yan family asked me to do. If you want to settle the score, you should go to the Yan family!”

“Don’t worry, I will go,” Qin Yu said coldly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

In the next second, Qin Yu instantly arrived in front of Gu Canghai.

Their eyes met, and Gu Canghai was terrified!

He braced himself and said, “What exactly do I have to do for you to let me go?”

“Impossible,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Gu Canghai was almost driven mad. He roared, “Qin Yu! Don’t go too far! Don’t think that I’m really afraid of you!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu sneered.

He walked toward Gu Canghai step by step and said coldly, “Come, let me see what you are capable of.”

Gu Canghai roared angrily, “Well then! I’ll fight with you!”

Gu Canghai’s internal qi surged. He bent his hands, and a terrifying internal qi burst forth!

In the next second, Gu Canghai’s figure flashed, and he ruthlessly grabbed at Qin Yu’s chest!

Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch while allowing Gu Canghai’s fingers to grab his chest.

“Crack!”

The instant the fingers collided, his clothes were instantly torn apart!

However, Qin Yu’s body wasn’t damaged at all. Not even a single white scar was left on his body!

“How... how is this possible?!” Gu Canghai’s expression was extremely unsightly!

His all-out attack wasn’t even able to leave a single white scar?

How terrifying was his physical body?!

“Do you have any other tricks?” Qin Yu sneered.

Gu Canghai gritted his teeth. With a furious roar, black energy immediately condensed on his hands. At a glance, these two hands looked extremely terrifying!

This was Gu Canghai’s ultimate technique, the Deadly Ghost Hand!

“Qin Yu, I’m going to kill you!” Gu Canghai roared and immediately grabbed at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu still didn’t move. Gu Canghai ‘s ultimate technique only left a few white marks on Qin Yu’s body.

“That’s it?” Qin Yu sneered.

“Gu Canghai, the Yan family raised a trash like you?”

Gu Canghai instantly fell into despair! He knew that there was a gap in strength between the two of them, but he didn’t expect the gap to be this big!

“Do you still have any other tricks?” Qin Yu said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Gu Canghai’s expression was gloomy. He knew that it would be difficult to escape today.

Therefore, Gu Canghai took two steps back and took a deep breath. Then, he slammed his palm on his chest.

The next second, Gu Canghai spat out a mouthful of blood!

Gu Canghai’s hands moved quickly in the air, as if he was performing some secret technique!

A terrifying internal qi gathered between Gu Canghai’s hands. The blood that spurted out from his mouth began to merge with the internal qi!

“Qin Yu... I’ll fight it out with you!” Gu Canghai’s eyes widened and his body trembled!

A huge black light seal condensed between his hands!

“I didn’t want things to end up like this, but you forced me to...” Blood flowed out of Gu Canghai’s mouth, and the black light seal in his hands became denser.

It was obvious that the pressure this technique exerted on Gu Canghai was extremely great!

The black light seal became even stronger, and Gu Canghai held it with both hands. It seemed like a huge mountain!

“This is Gu Canghai’s Mountain-Destroying Seal!” Someone recognized this technique and immediately shouted!

“Mountain-Destroying Seal? It’s said that this technique contains the power to destroy nature. Even a towering mountain would be destroyed in an instant! Hence, it’s called the Mountain-Destroying Seal!”

“But this technique affects one’s cultivation foundation and lifespan. It seems that Gu Canghai is really forced into a corner.”

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and quietly watched the light seal in Gu Canghai’s hand grow bigger and bigger.
