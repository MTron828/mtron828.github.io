Chapter 226: Are You Afraid of Pain? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A golden light flashed, making it difficult for people to open their eyes!

The terrifying internal qi even shattered the ground!

“Boom!”

A shocking scene appeared. Qin Yu’s punch had actually shattered the palm of the ancestor’s illusory figure!

The palm directly pierced through it. Under the golden light, it appeared to be unable to withstand a single blow!

However, Qin Yu didn’t stop there. His fierce fist pierced through the palm and headed straight for the gigantic head!

Hui Ming’s pupils suddenly dilated as he roared repeatedly!

“How is this possible?!” Hui Ming’s entire body was trembling!

“Bang!”

This punch directly shattered the so-called ultimate technique of the Earth Fiend Valley!

It was just one punch! It already had such outstanding power!

Most importantly, Qin Yu didn’t use the formation this time!

Everything returned to silence.

The black shadow gradually disappeared, and the room was a mess. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qin Yu’s body was burning with golden light and he looked like a God had descended to the mortal world.

“The ultimate technique of the Earth Fiend Valley can’t withstand a single blow,” Qin Yu said as he looked at Hui Ming coldly.

Hui Ming’s expression changed again and again, and finally, he snorted lightly.

“From the aura, Qin Yu is only at the sixth level of the Inner Strength Master Hands level. How could he have such strength...” Jiang Gu gulped and he was extremely shocked inside!

Even a legendary warrior from back then would never be able to attain such a level!

“No matter what the chaotic body does, I won’t be too surprised.” Hui Ming licked his lips.

He became increasingly infatuated. He was becoming more and more interested in Qin Yu’s body.

“What other moves do you have? Just use them,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hui Ming licked his lips and sneered. “Qin Yu, although you’re strong, it’s a pity that your realm is too low. It’s impossible for you to escape from here.”

“As long as you’re still here, I won’t die, and your inner strength will be exhausted sooner or later!”

Hui Ming wasn’t anxious. What he wanted was to slowly torture Qin Yu and exhaust his physical strength so that he could get his physical body.

Qin Yu wasn’t flustered at all. There was even a hint of a mocking smile.

This smile made Hui Ming feel very uncomfortable!

“Keep putting on an act. I want to see how long you can last!” Hui Ming said sinisterly.

After saying that, Hui Ming raised his hand and activated a spell. A huge hand descended from the sky!

The rumbling sound continued to be heard as a terrifying pressure surged!

Qin Yu didn’t panic. He raised his hand and threw a punch to meet it.

The punch seemed flimsy, but it had the power to destroy the world!

Hui Ming’s spell looked weak under this punch!

“Is there any point in wasting time like this? If you’re sensible, why don’t you obediently hand over this body? I might be able to teach you the possession technique and let you continue to live...” Hui Ming licked his lips and said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t answer him. Instead, he asked. “Are you afraid of pain?”

Hui Ming was stunned. He frowned and asked. “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu shook his head and smiled. “Your spell is indeed quite amazing. As long as someone’s realm is lower than yours, they won’t be able to break out of it.”

“That’s right.” Hui Ming placed his hands behind his back while appearing somewhat proud.

“However, this spell has a fatal flaw.” Qin Yu suddenly changed the topic, and the smile on his face became even more pronounced.

Hui Ming’s expression changed. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Quit putting on airs and spouting nonsense! Don’t even think about deceiving me!”

Qin Yu sneered. “You don’t believe me?”

Hui Ming snorted lightly. “Of course I... pfft!”

Before Hui Ming could finish his words, Qin Yu had already arrived in front of him and punched Hui Ming’s chest!

This punch penetrated Hui Ming’s chest!

The intense pain caused Hui Ming’s pupils to dilate abruptly! Even his body trembled a little!

He wiped the fresh blood that he spat out from his mouth, gritted his teeth, and said, “So what if you pierced through my chest?! My physical body can recover at any time!”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Your physical body can indeed recover, but... you will still feel the pain.”

Qin Yu’s words instantly made Hui Ming’s expression change!

“You... what do you mean?!” Hui Ming suddenly had a bad premonition inside!

Qin Yu sneered. “What do I mean? You aren’t my match. So what if your physical body can recover? I can torture you endlessly, but sooner or later, you won’t be able to endure it anymore.”

Hui Ming suddenly understood!

Yes, in terms of strength, Hui Ming was no match for Qin Yu, so he could only use this method!

But he had overlooked an important problem!

Qin Yu could also use his strength to crush him and torture him! He could make him suffer so much that he wished he could die!

Everyone had a limit. Once they crossed that limit, they would collapse!

“It seems that you understand.” Qin Yu opened his mouth and revealed a mouthful of white teeth.

However, this extremely brilliant smile looked evil in Hui Ming’s eyes!

“No, I absolutely can’t let him get close to me!” Hui Ming muttered to himself. He turned around and was about to run.

Unfortunately, it was already too late.

Qin Yu was one step ahead of him and approached him!

Following that, Qin Yu grabbed Hui Ming’s neck. After a low roar, a huge force was instantly released from his palm!

“Crack!”

Under this huge force, Qin Yu broke Hui Ming’s neck!

“Ah!!”

It was extremely painful!

It made him feel heart-wrenching pain!

But soon, Hui Ming’s body began to heal.

After he finished healing, Qin Yu once again came close to him and grabbed Hui Ming’s fingers!

“Crack!”

Ten fingers were broken by Qin Yu one by one!

As the saying went, the ten fingers were connected to the heart. At this moment, Hui Ming had firsthand experience of it!

The endless torture began from this point.

Qin Yu had an infinite number of methods. Every time Hui Ming’s body recovered fully, he would be subjected to inhuman torture again!

Even Jiang Gu, who wasn’t far away, couldn’t bear to see such cruel methods!

Hui Ming began to feel that he couldn’t bear it anymore.

After being tortured like this, his vision began to blur.

Qin Yu looked down at Hui Ming and sneered. “You might have made a mistake. I trapped you, instead of you trapping me.”
