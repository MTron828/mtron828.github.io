Yao Qing’s strength wasn’t enough for them to break out of this prison.

He stood up and looked at everyone. For a moment, everyone seemed to be sending Qin Yu off to his death.

“If I’m fine this time, let’s meet again when we get out,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

At this time, someone took the initiative to stand up. He cupped his hands and said, “If nothing happens this time, we are willing to follow Mr. Qin!”

Qin Yu was speechless.

He was silent for a moment, then nodded and said, “Okay! It’s a deal!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yuan Hong led his people to the door.

“Qin Yu, it’s time to leave,” Yuan Hong said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu turned around to look at the crowd, then strode toward the door.

The two people beside Yuan Hong immediately stepped forward and grabbed Qin Yu’s arm!

Qin Yu looked at them coldly and his entire body vibrated!

A force forced them back!

“I can walk on my own,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The two people subconsciously looked at Yuan Hong. Yuan Hong waved his hand and said indifferently, “Let him be arrogant one last time.”

“Yes.” The two people followed closely behind Qin Yu.

On the way to the execution ground, Yuan Hong said with a sarcastic tone, “Qin Yu, if you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place? If you treated Jiang Haoran, you could have at least kept your life, right?”

Qin Yu looked at Yuan Hong coldly and said, “Shut your mouth. I don’t want to listen to you.”

Yuan Hong sneered and said, “You still dare to be so arrogant when you’re about to die!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If I didn’t die, I would have eradicated your Martial Arts Association sooner or later.”

“Eradicate the Martial Arts Association?” Yuan Hong seemed to have heard the biggest joke in the world!

He laughed loudly and said, “Ignorant people are truly fearless. You know nothing about the Martial Arts Association!”

Qin Yu snorted coldly and no longer spoke.

On the other side, the Jiang family welcomed a few guests.

A huge helicopter landed in the manor.

The whooshing sound was incessant, and the entire Jiang family was shrouded in a heavy atmosphere.

In the living room, a young woman was sitting on the sofa while drinking tea.

Her gaze was contemptuous, and her expression was ice-cold.

Beside her, there were eight Inner Strength Grandmasters!

The invisible pressure made it difficult for everyone to relax!

In front of the young girl, there was an old man trembling while kneeling.

This old man was none other than the top dog who dominated Chuzhou, Jiang Gu!

No one would have thought that Jiang Gu, who always abused his powers, would actually have such a humble attitude one day!

“I. . . I didn’t know the relationship between Qin Yu and Miss Yan...” Jiang Gu said with difficulty.

He was extremely terrified. The scene of him being taught a lesson by the rich kids in Jingdu was still vivid in his mind!

Jiang Gu never expected that this time, something even worse would come!

Yan Ruoxue took a sip of tea. She looked down at Jiang Gu and raised her eyebrows. “You say you didn’t know?”

Jiang Gu’s body trembled and he hurriedly said, “I. . . I really didn’t know!”

After saying that, he hurriedly looked at Mr. Zhong.

Mr. Zhong forced a smile and said, “Our family head has been in seclusion for three years. He really doesn’t know anything about this...”

“Why didn’t you tell me?!” Jiang Gu said angrily.

Mr. Zhong quickly said, “I asked someone to inquire about it. The Yan family said that they wouldn’t interfere...”

“Indeed, we won’t interfere,” Yan Ruoxue said indifferently.

“But if you rely on your family’s connections to do something disgraceful, I don’t mind putting you in your place.”

Her tone suddenly became cold, and Jiang Gu’s face became even paler!

“No... I won’t dare to...” Jiang Gu said in fear.

How could the Jiang family have the ability to compete with the Yan family?

They were the most powerful family in the country! They were the top dogs in Jingdu!

The power of Jingdu was far beyond imagination!

“You want to eliminate others by suppressing them when you get defeated? Is this how the Jiang family does things? How overbearing,” Yan Ruoxue questioned in a cold voice.

Jiang Gu hurriedly kowtowed and argued, “Miss Yan, it was Qin Yu who injured my son first. I... I had no choice!”

“And I also promised that as long as Qin Yu is willing to treat my son’s illness, I can let him off the hook...”

At this moment, Jiang Gu still wanted to quibble.

But how could his malicious intentions escape Yan Ruoxue’s eyes?

Yan Ruoxue had followed Old Mister Yan since she was a child. She was already familiar with the ways of the world!

Jiang Gu’s thoughts were instantly seen through!

“You said that Qin Yu injured your son?” Yan Ruoxue asked indifferently.

Jiang Gu hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes...”

“As long as Qin Yu saves your son, you will let him go?” Yan Ruoxue continued to ask.

Jiang Gu hurriedly said, “You’re right...”

“So, everything started because of your son?” Yan Ruoxue said with a cold smile.

Jiang Gu thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “Yes... you’re right...”

“Oh.” Yan Ruoxue nodded.

She turned her head to look at the Inner Strength Grandmaster who was beside her.

The Inner Strength Grandmaster immediately understood what she meant. He waved his hand, and a force instantly smashed toward Jiang Haoran’s ward!

“Boom!”

The ward instantly collapsed! The huge force crushed Jiang Haoran into pieces!

“Alright, your son is already dead. There’s no need to save him,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

Jiang Gu’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

He stared at Jiang Haoran’s ward, and felt as if his heart was dripping blood!

“Son...” Anguish flashed across Jiang Gu’s face!

Yan Ruoxue said coldly, “Jiang Gu, there’s always someone more powerful than you. You can toy with other people’s lives as you wish. Naturally, someone will be able to do the same to you.”

“Do you have any objections?” Yan Ruoxue’s domineering attitude was suffocating him!

Although Jiang Gu felt anguish in his heart, he had no intention of resisting the Yan family at all.

“I... I have no objections...” Jiang Gu hurriedly kowtowed.

“Thank you, Miss Yan, for not killing me...”

This sentence seemed somewhat familiar.

Back then, Wei Tao had said the same thing to Jiang Gu.

But now, this was happening to him.

“Let him go,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

Jiang Gu hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, Miss Yan...”

Then, he hurriedly got up and rushed to the Martial Arts Association.

...

The Martial Arts Association.

Qin Yu was brought to an execution ground.

As soon as he entered the execution ground, Qin Yu discovered that this execution ground was very extraordinary.

The entire execution ground was actually a huge formation!

Using this formation, the person controlling the formation would probably display unimaginable strength!

“Good formation.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Yuan Hong raised his eyebrows and said, “You even know about formation? You’re quite discerning.”

Qin Yu glanced at Yuan Hong and said coldly, “This formation couldn’t have been set up by you, right?”

Yuan Hong laughed and said, “Of course not! This is a formation set up for us by a master from above!”

“This formation can easily kill a beginner Inner Strength Grandmaster!”

“Qin Yu, you will definitely die today!”
