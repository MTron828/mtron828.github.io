Chapter 1429: Chapter 1,429, seizing by force! 1

The Diamond Ant’s slap was so powerful that it instantly sent the fang flying.

Qin Yu knew something was wrong and quickly rushed towards the Fang.

However, at this moment, the Fang stood up again despite the injuries on its body and rushed towards the diamond ant.

The diamond ant seemed to have been angered by the Fang’s action. Its black feet pierced straight into the Fang’s chest!

Fang roared. He did not Dodge or Dodge. Instead, he charged straight at the Diamond Ant’s black feet!

Unsurprisingly, the black feet instantly pierced through Fang’s chest! However, Fang also took this opportunity to throw the hammer directly onto the Diamond Ant’s body!

“Ah! !”

Fang roared angrily. His muscles tensed up as he exerted his strength to the maximum.

In the next second, Fang swung his long hammer and threw the diamond ant to the ground! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Quick, stab his abdomen!”Fang shouted desperately, ignoring the blood that was flowing out of his body!

Second Brother and the others did not dare to be negligent after hearing this angry roar. They quickly pulled out their sharp blades and stabbed at the diamond ant!

Although the diamond ant was covered in steel-like armor, his abdomen was extremely soft!

At this moment, the diamond ant was struggling desperately while the others were already approaching with sharp blades in their hands!

Qin Yu could not help but sigh as he watched from the side. The cruelty of the cultivation world was beyond imagination. If ordinary people wanted to survive, which one of them would not risk their lives?

“Fortunately, they succeeded,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He took a step forward, intending to treat Fang’s injuries.

However, at this moment, a sharp blade cut through the sky and instantly cut the diamond ant’s body into two!

Blood gushed out and the Diamond Ant’s body was split into two. Its life force stopped abruptly.

Second Brother and the others stood there with their mouths Agape.

They held sharp blades in their hands and didn’t know what to do for a moment.

“Diamond Ant, this body is full of treasures.”

At this moment, a young man dressed in embroidered clothes and jade robes slowly walked out from the darkness.

He held a treasure sword in his hand and a faint smile hung on his face.

Qin Yu looked at the young man coldly and instantly frowned.

He walked directly in the direction of the Diamond Ant and then reached out his hand to take out the diamond ant’s inner core.

“That’s right, it’s this thing,”the young man said indifferently.

His attitude of ignoring others made Qin Yu very angry.

After taking away the inner core, the young man turned around and intended to leave.

At this time, Qin Yu took a step forward and blocked his way.

The young man glanced at Qin Yu and said, “What’s the matter?”

Qin Yu said in a cold voice, “You took someone else’s thing openly, and you are still so righteous?”

“Oh? Someone Else’s things?”The young man raised his eyebrows.

He glanced at the inner core in his hand and sneered, “Are you talking about this?”

“Stop pretending to be ignorant,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The young man laughed loudly and said, “When did this thing become yours? Didn’t I kill that Diamond Ant?”

“You killed it? They were clearly about to succeed, but you stole the fruit at this time. Do you still have any face?”Qin Yu said while holding back his anger.

The young man glanced at Fangya and the others, then, he said sarcastically, “How can you trash kill the Diamond Ant? If it weren’t for my appearance, you would have died. I saved your lives. You should be grateful.”

“Bullsh * T!”Qin Yu was instantly furious!

Fangya and the others had almost risked their lives to kill the diamond ant, but now, the fruit was stolen by someone else. How Could Qin Yu Bear This!

The young man laughed loudly and said, “You want it, right? Fine, kneel down and beg me, and I’ll give it to you. How about it?”

Qin Yu’s expression became colder and colder, and she couldn’t help but clench her fists.

“I’ll tell you. This thing is dispensable to me, but not to you guys,”the young man said sinisterly.

“Kid, do you know that I especially like to see your begging expressions? hahahaha!”

Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer. Just as he was about to make a move to look directly at them, Fang Fang, who was not far away, waved his hand and said, “Yu Qin, forget it...”

“Forget it?”Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Fang Fang supported his body and walked toward Qin Yu and Fang Fang.

He cupped his hands towards the young man and said, “I’m sorry, Young Master Mo. . The thing originally belonged to you. Thank you for saving our lives...”

The young man who was called Young Master Mo raised his eyebrows and said with interest, “So you know me?”

“Who wouldn’t know that you, Young Master Mo...”Fang smiled bitterly.

Young Master Mo Glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Kid, did you hear that? Today, this young master is in a good mood, so I’ll spare your lives. If you dare to talk nonsense with me again, I’ll send you to see that diamond ant immediately!”

“You...”

“Forget it!”

Qin Yu wanted to say something, but Fang Fang grabbed him tightly.

Young Master Mo snorted lightly. His body shook and he disappeared into the horizon in an instant.

Looking at his departing figure, Qin Yu felt an indescribable anger in his heart.

Fang Fang and the others almost lost their lives for this diamond ant. Now, not only did they not get anything, but they also had to lower their heads to others!

Qin Yu’s chest kept heaving up and down. He took a deep breath, then looked at fang fang and said, “I’m sorry. This is my fault. If I had acted earlier, such a thing would not have happened.”

Fang Fang waved his hand and said, “This is your first time entering Qingyan Forest. It’s already good enough that you’re not scared. What has it got to do with you? Just blame us for not having the ability and being bullied by these powerful people.”
