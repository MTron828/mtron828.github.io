Chapter 997: Chapter 997: When a wall falls, everyone pushes it down

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu was at a loss.

He didn’t even know how to explain it to Yu Qin.

He couldn’t possibly say that the person who said those words during the day wasn’t him, right?

Even if he said it out loud, Yu Qin probably wouldn’t believe it.

“Damn it, this iron egg!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

But the matter had already happened, and it had to be resolved.

Therefore, Qin Yu braced himself and walked towards Yu Qin.

As the distance between the two of them grew closer, the atmosphere became ambiguous.

Yu Qin didn’t dare to look directly at Qin Yu. She lowered her head, and her body was even slightly trembling.

Qin Yu walked to the bedside and sat down. He didn’t speak for a long time.

“That...”

After a long time, Qin Yu opened his mouth.

“I’m sorry about what happened during the day.”Qin Yu scratched his head.

Yu Qin said softly, “It’s... It’s fine. I don’t mind...”

Qin Yu’s old face darkened and he hurriedly explained, “What I said during the day... I was joking. Don’t take it seriously.”

Yu Qin’s expression instantly froze. A hint of disappointment flashed across her eyes.

“Am... am I not good-looking?”Yu Qin mustered up her courage and asked softly.

“No, no, no.”Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand.

Looking at Yu Qin in front of him, Qin Yu could only clench his teeth and say, “Yu Qin, you are very beautiful and very kind, but... there is someone in my heart that I like, and she is the only one.”

The expression on Yu Qin’s face instantly became somewhat sorrowful.

She bit her red lips with her pearly teeth and whispered, “Then is it Yan Ruoxue?”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “How did you know?”

“I heard it from those bad guys...”Yu Qin said softly.

Qin Yu knew that Yu Qin would be sad, but it was better to be short-lived.

Therefore, Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, it’s Yan Ruoxue.”

“Is She... Pretty?”Yu Qin asked softly.

At the mention of Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile.

“Beautiful, very beautiful. In My Heart, she is the most beautiful person in the world,”Qin Yu said with a silly smile.

“Not only is she very beautiful, but she is also very good to me and very sensible.”

The more Qin Yu said, the more excited he became. He even took out a photo from his phone and said proudly, “How is it? Beautiful, right?”

Yu Qin bit her lips and said somewhat sadly, “Beautiful, indeed very beautiful...”

Only then did Qin Yu react. He said somewhat embarrassedly, “I’m sorry... That, you have a good rest. I’m leaving.”

After glancing at these words, Qin Yu hurriedly ran out of the room.

After running for hundreds of meters, Qin Yu finally stopped.

“Damn it, this bastard iron egg!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

Unknowingly, he had hurt so many people!

“Forget it, I don’t care about this anymore.”Qin Yu shook his head hard.

What should be considered at the moment was not romantic feelings.

He clenched his fist and once again felt the trace of lightning power in his body.

“Ever since I obtained this lightning element, my physical body has improved again,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Unfortunately, my golden core has been damaged, so I can’t use my spiritual power anymore.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Heavenly vanilla... when can I get it?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

The next day.

Qin Yu planned to leave this mountain south village.

If he stayed any longer, he would definitely attract more people to hunt him down.

Therefore, Qin Yu found Yu Qin and planned to say goodbye to her.

When they arrived at Yu Qin’s house, their eyes met, and the atmosphere was a little awkward.

“I plan to leave,”Qin Yu said.

Yu Qin opened her mouth and then nodded.

“Okay, take care of yourself.”After Qin Yu said this, he turned around and planned to leave.

“Wait!”

At this moment, Yu Qin suddenly called out to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What’s wrong? Is there anything else?”

Yu Qin bit her lips, as if she was making a decision.

A moment later, she mustered up her courage and said, “Can you bring me along?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed tightly.

“Did I not make myself clear last night?”Qin Yu frowned and said.

Yu Qin hurriedly said, “No, no, that’s not what I meant. I... I just want to learn martial arts from you, okay?”

“Learn martial arts?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

The martial arts she mentioned referred to cultivation.

“Why?”Qin Yu asked.

At the mention of this, a trace of pain flashed across Yu Qin’s face.

She whispered, “I saw Granny Yuan die in front of me with my own eyes, but I was powerless. At that time, I thought how good it would be if I had the same ability as you.”

Then, Yu Qin raised her head and said with a pleading face, “Qin Yu, as long as I can stay by your side, I’m willing to be your servant. I’ll do whatever you want me to do!”

Qin Yu’s face immediately showed a trace of embarrassment.

“I’m here to escape. It’s dangerous to stay by my side,”said Qin Yu.

Yu Qin hurriedly said, “I’m not afraid!”

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then said, “Let me think about it. If there’s a chance, I can take you as my disciple, but not now.”

“Okay!”Yu Qin nodded in surprise.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He did not waste any more time and immediately left the mountain South Village.

In the next few days, Qin Yu covered his face and wandered around the major medicinal herbs markets, trying to find a heavenly herb.

Although Qin Yu tried his best to hide his identity, paper could not cover up the fire.

In addition, Qin Yu had been searching for the heavenly vanilla, so his identity was quickly guessed.

“Heavenly vanilla? I remember that it is a medicinal herb used when the golden core is damaged.”

“Why is Qin Yu looking for heavenly vanilla? Could it be that his golden core is damaged?”

“Latest news! A few days ago, the person who transcended the martial saint’s Heavenly Tribulation was none other than Qin Yu!”

“Now that Qin Yu needs the heavenly herb to transcend the martial saint’s Heavenly Tribulation, does this mean that he failed to transcend the tribulation? ! His Golden Core is crippled? !”

Once this news spread out, it immediately caused the entire martial arts world to be in an uproar!

“In other words, before Qin Yu found the heavenly herb, he had already become a cripple!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Take advantage of his illness to take his life! Now is the best time to get rid of him!”

For a moment, many martial artists were restless and wanted to take the opportunity to get rid of Qin Yu and make a name for themselves!

On this day, Qin Yu appeared at Ning Yang’s herbs market.

Both sides of the market were filled with herbs stalls. As Qin Yu walked on this street, the people around him unconsciously retreated to one side.

They looked at Qin Yu in front of them, one after another, they were ready to make a move, full of killing intent.

However, Qin Yu turned a blind eye, as if there was no one else around, and continued walking on his own path.

His eyes occasionally looked at the stalls around him, trying to find the heavenly vanilla.

“Cough Cough!”

At this time, Qin Yu’s Golden Core Dao injury took effect, and blood suddenly spurted out of his mouth.

Seeing this scene, the people around him immediately whispered, “It seems that the rumors are true! This Qin Yu really failed to transcend the Tribulation!”

“The current Qin Yu is just a cripple! Kill him!”

Everyone was restless and seemed to have the intention to make a move.
