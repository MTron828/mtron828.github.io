Chapter 600: We Have to Create Evildoers Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

With a wave of the figure’s hand, countless people were sent flying!

The people who had wanted to resist now wanted to retreat and flee in all directions!

Qin Yu stared at the figure with a strange expression!

She had a mask on her face, and this mask was exactly the same as the mask Xiao Yu had!

“Could it be... that this person is the owner of that mask?!” Qin Yu exclaimed in surprise!

More importantly, there seemed to be a connection between that mask and Xiao Yu!

Soon, the masked woman rushed into the hall.

The cultivators in the hall couldn’t even withstand a single blow, and they couldn’t fight back at all.

In a short time, blood flowed like a river in the Immortal Slaying Sect.

The sect leader, who was sitting on the chair, turned even paler.

He opened his mouth, as if he was saying something, but Qin Yu couldn’t hear anything.

From the movements of his mouth, it seemed as if he was begging for mercy.

However, the masked woman didn’t give him any chance. She only raised her hand and crushed the Immortal Slaying Sect’s sect leader’s divine sense!

Qin Yu stood there with his face still filled with shock.

What was the background of this masked woman?! All the mighty figures in the sect actually didn’t have the strength to fight back?!

The masked woman stood in the hall for a long time. After an unknown amount of time, she slowly left.

Qin Yu’s divine sense also broke free at this moment.

He looked at the scene in front of him and couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat.

“So many mighty figures... actually didn’t have the strength to fight back...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel horrified.

This also made Qin Yu start to wonder if any of these almighty powerhouses who had lifespans of thousands of years actually live to this day?!

Also, what was the relationship between the masked woman and Xiao Yu? Why was only Xiao Yu able to wear the mask?

Could it be...

Xiao Yu was the reincarnator of the masked woman?!

If that was really the case, then Xiao Yu’s future... was full of potential!

Qin Yu stretched out his hand to touch the corpse sitting on the chair.

But at this moment, the corpse suddenly collapsed and turned into ashes before disappearing without a trace.

“Strange.” Qin Yu frowned.

“Just now, it was indestructible. How come it suddenly turned into ashes?”

“Could it be... someone deliberately wanted me to see this scene?”

At this moment, the entire hall suddenly turned cold.

Waves of cold air emanated from the withered bones!

“This is dark energy... so many people died, but the dark energy only erupted at this moment.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel even more puzzled.

“When I find the time... I have to bring Xiao Yu here to give it a try.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Soon after, Qin Yu began to explore the Immortal Slaying Sect.

After all, these people were all at the Mighty Realm, or even existences that surpassed the Mighty Realm. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Any treasure they had on them was a precious item.

...

Above the island, the sky was bright.

Yan Guiyi stood on the surface of the sea with his brows tightly furrowed.

Soon, He Teng appeared on the surface of the sea.

He walked in front of Yan Guiyi, shook his head, and said, “Captain Yan, we still haven’t found him. I’m afraid he’s already dead at the bottom of the sea.”

Yan Guiyi didn’t say anything. He said in a low voice, “I hope so.”

Although he said so, Yan Guiyi still felt a bit uneasy.

Yan Guiyi didn’t know what was under this island.

“We can’t delay any longer. If we delay any longer, this bracelet will lose its effect,” Yan Guiyi said in a low voice.

Once the bracelet lost its effect, these bottom-class martial artiss would be hard to control.

Although they didn’t dare to resist for the time being, if there really was a treasure under the island, they wouldn’t continue to be timid.

As long as the benefits were great enough, any coward could become emboldened.

Therefore, Yan Guiyi gathered everyone and said coldly, “From now on, I will take you to see the real treasure.”

Hearing this, everyone looked at Yan Guiyi with some confusion.

“There seems to be some treasure hidden under the sea,” Yan Jinyao said nonchalantly.

“Huh? Mr. Yan seems to know something about it?” The few people looked at Yan Jinyao.

Yan Jinyao glanced at them and said, “I have been to the library of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. There are locations and brief introductions of all the secret realms in the world.”

Hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but feel surprised.

“What is the relationship between you and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? You can even read that?” Zhuang Teng said in surprise.

Yan Jinyao glanced at him and said indifferently, “Yes, because the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has sent me an invitation to become a candidate for the President’s position.”

Hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

They never thought that Yan Jinyao would be so highly valued!

“Miss Yao, it seems that Qin Yu is dead.” Kong Yun suddenly changed the topic.

Yao Meng glanced at Kong Yun and said with a smile, “Mr. Kong, you seem quite hostile to Qin Yu.”

Kong Yun snorted and said, “Not really. A nobody like him is not worthy of being targeted by me.”

Hearing that, Yao Meng said with a nonchalant smile, “I don’t think Qin Yu will die just like that.”

“Hehe, it’s been a day and a night. If he didn’t die, would he be resting at the bottom of the sea?” Kong Yun sneered.

“We can make a bet,” Yao Meng said with a smile.

“Sure. What’s the bet?” Kong Yun snorted coldly.

Yao Meng thought for a moment and said, “If he doesn’t die, you can give me the secret treasure of the Kong family. How about it?”

Kong Yun’s expression suddenly changed. He said with a cold expression, “Miss Yao, isn’t this bet a bit too overboard? I don’t have the final say on the secret treasure of the Kong family.”

Yao Meng said with a nonchalant smile, “It seems that Mr. Kong is not very confident.”

Being provoked by Yao Meng, Kong Yun immediately snorted and said, “I’ll accept the bet! What if you lose?”

“If I lose, I can give the Yao family’s zither to you,” Yao Meng said with a smile.

“Zither? The secret treasure passed down from the Yao family’s ancestors?” Kong Yun’s eyes lit up.

“Miss Yao, I hope you keep your word.”

Yao Meng slightly bowed and said, “Likewise.”

After that, everyone stopped talking and looked at Yan Guiyi in unison.

Yan Guiyi said in a cold voice, “The seabed is full of dangers. The slightest carelessness could lead to death. From now on, if anyone leaves me by half a step, you will bear the consequences.”

Everyone nodded slightly.

Yan Guiyi looked at He Teng and said in a cold voice, “When we go to the seabed, I want you to kill all those bottom-class martial artists without leaving a single one alive! At that time, I will activate the bracelet to cooperate with you.”

He Teng couldn’t help but frown. “Mr. Yan, isn’t this a bit inappropriate? If I kill all of them, won’t I bear a bad reputation?”

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes and said, “What do you think I want you to do? Let me tell you, the reason I let you join the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is that I want you to do things that are inconvenient for us to do!”

Speaking up to this point, Yan Guiyi paused for a moment and sneered. “After we leave this place, you have to kill more people. If there are no evildoers, we have to create evildoers. Only then can the importance of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association be demonstrated. Understand?”
