Qin Yu’s words naturally shocked countless people.

His words infuriated Han Yilong even more!

Han Yilong narrowed his eyes as he sized up Qin Yu and said, “You don’t seem to take me seriously.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Take you seriously? I don’t even take Han Wei seriously. Who do you think you are?”

Hiss!

Everyone gasped!

Qin Yu was too arrogant!

Take Han Wei seriously? He was the young master of a top-notch aristocratic family in Jingdu!

“Hahaha!”

Han Yilong couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Kid, you have successfully angered me!” Han Yilong took a step forward.

The two elders beside him burst out with intense internal qi!

The surging internal qi crushed towards Qin Yu. In an instant, Qin Yu felt a sense of pressure slowly approaching him.

Qin Yu didn’t move at all. He stood there like a towering mountain.

“Boom!”

Just as he was about to make his move, a terrifying wave of internal qi suddenly erupted from the deep mountain!

Then, a barrier slowly formed around the deep mountain.

With the mountain as the center, the barrier spread out in all directions.

“The Divine Medicine is about to be born!” Someone exclaimed!

“Quick, if we don’t go in, we won’t be able to get in!” Many people shouted.

Han Yilong couldn’t pay attention to Qin Yu anymore. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and warned, “Kid, just you wait.”

“Young Master Han, don’t worry. I’ll take care of him for you later!” Zhang Hua said eagerly.

Qin Yu sneered inside.

He would kill all of them later!

There were at least dozens of people who were willing to help Han Yilong. At that time, Qin Yu would probably have to face dozens of people.

This also reminded Qin Yu of a spell used by Hui Ming.

That spell could absorb the inner strength of others for its own use, thus increasing one’s strength.

“Although it’s an evil spell, it does have a wondrous effect. If only I knew it,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The benefits of having the inner strength of dozens of people were definitely beyond his imagination.

This thought flashed across Qin Yu’s mind.

However, in the next second, a memory called “Heaven Swallowing Technique” appeared!

Qin Yu was immediately shocked, and then he was ecstatic!

There was actually such a technique in his father’s inheritance?

Moreover, this “Heaven Swallowing Technique” was much more advanced than Hui Ming’s technique!

Not only could it absorb internal qi, but it could also absorb dark energy and spiritual energy!

“The inheritance left by my father is really comprehensive.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but lick his lips. For a moment, he was even looking forward to it.

“I will swallow all of you later!” Qin Yu sneered.

Then, he looked at Jiang Gu and said, “Let’s go.”

Jiang Gu looked very worried. However, he still followed Qin Yu into the deep mountains.

The moment the two of them entered, the barrier was formed.

The surrounding internal qi was blocked, and the deep mountains seemed to have become another world.

“Mr. Qin, you have quite some guts.” At this moment, Jing Lu walked over from not far away. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He smiled nonchalantly and said, “To dare to challenge the Han family, you’re indeed the King of Chuzhou.”

“You call this guts? He’s obviously reckless!” Duan Shi snorted.

“A mere Inner Strength Master Hands dares to cause a ruckus? Isn’t he a fool?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “One doesn’t have to forsake one’s dignity just because one is weaker.”

“Hehe, I have seen many people like you.” Duan Shi sneered.

“Just because you have some talent, you’re not afraid of anything!”

“There is only one ending for you, and that is to die a miserable death!”

Qin Yu was unfazed.

He glanced at Duan Shi and sneered. “It’s not certain who will die a miserable death.”

“Alright, let’s leave quickly.” Jing Lu waved his hand, as if he was afraid of getting implicated by Qin Yu.

After they left, Qin Yu glanced at Fang Yue and smiled, “Miss Fang, I’ve offended the Han family, and I’m afraid I’ve become everyone’s enemy. Why aren’t you leaving yet?”

“Me? Why should I leave?” Fang Yue said with a smile.

“Aren’t you afraid of getting yourself into trouble?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Fang Yue said with a nonchalant smile, “We’ve all climbed up from the bottom step by step. We’re supposed to look out for each other.”

“Moreover... the one who offended the Han family is you, not me.”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “As you wish.”

Everyone was following their internal qi toward the Divine Medicine.

It was obvious that the Divine Medicine was in the center of the mountain.

However, what was surprising was that although these people were rushing, they weren’t too far away from Han Yilong.

After traveling for half an hour, they were getting closer and closer to the Divine Medicine.

At this moment, Han Yilong stopped.

The others also stopped at the same time.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and was surprised to find that Zhang Hua and Chen Meng were actually following Han Yilong like lap dogs.

Then, Han Yilong’s gaze fell on Qin Yu.

He slowly walked to Qin Yu and said coldly, “I’ll give you a chance now. Kneel down and apologize to me and promise that you’ll never see Miss Yan again. Maybe I can spare your life.”

Han Yilong’s words immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

“Young Master Han, what’s there to talk about with this trash? Just let us kill him!” Zhang Hua rubbed his hands as waves of internal qi burst out from his body.

Han Yilong ignored him. He pointed to the ground and said, “Kneel down. It’s your last chance.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered. “You so-called aristocratic families and big figures seem to like to make others kneel down.”

“What? Do you feel a sense of accomplishment by making others kneel down?” Qin Yu questioned.

Han Yilong laughed out loud, “People like you who live at the bottom should look up to me! Shouldn’t you kneel down?”

Qin Yu shook his head and sneered. “Han Yilong, you think too highly of yourself.”

“Perhaps in the eyes of others, you’re some high and mighty young master.”

“But in my eyes, you’re just a piece of trash who uses the power of your family to oppress others.”

“You’re almost thirty years old, but you’re only an Inner Strength Master Hands. You have such good resources, but your strength is so low. What use do you have for this Divine Medicine?”

“With such a huge amount of resources yet such lackluster results, even if used on a dog, it will probably be better than being used on you.”

These few words made Han Yilong’s expression extremely ugly!

Just as Qin Yu had said, his lack of talent had always been criticized by others!

Even though his family had spent a lot of money on him, he was still stuck at the level of an Inner Strength Master Hands, and it was difficult for him to improve any further!

This was also the reason why he came to look for the Divine Medicine. He wanted to take a gamble and change the current situation!

Qin Yu’s words were clearly rubbing salt on his wound!

“You... you’re courting death!” Han Yilong said through gritted teeth.

“Young Master Han, don’t be angry. I will kill him for you!” Zhang Hua volunteered.

“Qin Yu is only an Inner Strength Master Hands. I will crush him like an ant!”
