Xia Hang couldn’t help but frown. “The method to open the Mystic Realm? This is a secret. I don’t know about it at the moment.”

“But if this academy can be established, I will definitely get the method to open the Mystic Realm.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He smiled and said, “Okay, quickly establish this academy.”

Xia Hang agreed and then asked, “Do you want to join this academy?”

“Me? Forget about me. My relationship with those Young Masters has never been good,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“That’s really a pity. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s Scripture Pavilion still has many good things,” Xia Hang said.

“Scripture Pavilion?” Qin Yu immediately changed his mind.

He quickly said, “I’ll participate! Help me sign up.”

Qin Yu was very interested in this Scripture Pavilion.

Not only did it have many spells, but it also recorded the history of the martial arts world!

This was a rare opportunity for Qin Yu.

...

In a mansion in Qing City.

Hu Feng limped back to the mansion. As soon as he entered the door, he roared angrily, “Damn it!”

In the mansion, a man who looked to be in his thirties slowly opened his eyes.

This man looked very young, but in fact, he was more than sixty years old!

He was the famous Sect Master Hu, Hu Feng’s father!

Sect Master Hu looked at Hu Feng and asked, “What happened to your legs?”

Hu Feng gnashed his teeth and said, “It’s Qin Yu! He broke my legs in front of so many people!”

“Qin Yu?” Sect Master Hu frowned immediately.

“Is it the Qin Yu who killed Qu Xie?”

Hu Feng nodded and said, “Yes, it’s him!”

“Why did he come to Qing City?” Sect Master Hu couldn’t stay calm anymore.

He stood up from the ground, and there seemed to be some worry in his eyes.

“Hu Feng, why did you provoke Qin Yu? Don’t you know that Qin Yu isn’t to be trifled with?” Sect Master Hu scolded loudly.

Hu Feng snorted lightly. “Why should I be afraid of him? Who knows if his reputation is deserved?”

“Father, you’re not afraid of Qin Yu, are you?”

Sect Master Hu said with a cold expression, “Even a big shot like Qu Xie died at his hands, let alone me!”

“Do you know those big aristocratic families in Jingdu? We aren’t on the same level as them!”

“If I really had great abilities, why would I hide in this small city?”

Hu Feng laughed coldly and said, “Father, he broke your son’s legs. Not only did you not take revenge, but you blamed me instead?”

“He only broke your legs. It’s already good enough that he didn’t take your life,” Sect Master Hu said with a cold snort.

“I’m warning you, don’t provoke Qin Yu again!”

Hu Feng didn’t say anything. A moment later, Hu Feng suddenly said, “Father, have you ever thought that this might be an opportunity for us?”

“Opportunity? What bullshit opportunity?” Sect Master Hu said with a cold expression.

Hu Feng said, “Who doesn’t know that the great families of Jingdu all want to kill Qin Yu? If he falls into our hands, does our family still need to stay here?”

“And I heard that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is going to recruit students! With our relationship, it’s impossible for me to enter that academy!”

“But if we kill Qin Yu, they will definitely give me a spot! That’s a huge matter that transcends classes!”

These words tempted Sect Master Hu somewhat.

“Dad, the opportunity is right in front of us! We absolutely cannot miss it!” Hu Feng struck while the iron was hot and said anxiously.

Sect Master Hu furrowed his brows and said, “But... I am not a match for Qin Yu at all.”

A strange smile flashed across Hu Feng’s face. He then said, “Father, you were able to seize the good fortune of Qing City back then. Now, why don’t you use the same trick to seize the good fortune of Qin Yu?”

“When Qin Yu is at the end of his luck, we won’t need to personally kill him.”

Sect Master Hu glanced at Hu Feng. A trace of hesitation flashed across his face.

A moment later, Sect Master Hu gritted his teeth, and a trace of viciousness flashed across his eyes!

“Good! The winner takes all. Then I’ll give it a try!” Sect Master Hu said coldly.

Seeing this, Hu Feng immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

He sneered. “Qin Yu, you’re dead meat!”

...

The sky gradually brightened, and Qin Yu had just woken up from his sleep.

At the entrance of the hotel room, there were already two people waiting.

One of them was Brother Song.

At this moment, he had a respectful and apologetic smile on his face.

Looking at Brother Song in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. “Why are you here again?”

Brother Song hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, I’m really sorry about yesterday. I hope you don’t mind.”

The man beside him took a step forward and introduced himself. “My name is Ning Kun. I can be considered the person in charge of Hong Yi Sect in the country. Today, I brought Song Shan to apologize to you.”

Qin Yu’s eyes rolled around before he smiled and said, “Mr. Ning, right? Come in and have a seat.”

Ning Kun hurriedly walked in and explained, “Mr. Qin, I’m really sorry. Among the people you killed, there was Song Shan’s brother, so he has a certain degree of hostility toward you.”

“I see.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Ning Kun said in a deep voice, “Mr. Qin, if it’s convenient for you, we don’t want to waste time.”

“Hong Yi Sect has always been very sincere to you. The gate of the Mystic Realm is even opened for Mr. Qin!”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Are we leaving now?”

“There’s no time to lose. The sooner the better,” said Ning Kun.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Alright then.”

The few of them walked out of the hotel. Su Qian was already waiting at the door.

After seeing Qin Yu, Su Qian also let out a sigh of relief.

She ran to Qin Yu and whispered, “Ning Kun is the biggest leader here. Don’t worry with him here.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and didn’t say anything.

Ning Kun looked quite humble, but Qin Yu always felt that Ning Kun was like a smiling tiger and hiding a knife in his smile.

The few of them came to the open space from yesterday again.

Ning Kun wasn’t in a hurry to open the Mystic Realm. Instead, he asked, “Mr. Qin, I heard from Song Shan that you found this place by yourself yesterday?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said with a smile, “No, I was just strolling around and happened to walk here.”

“I see.” Ning Kun seemed to be deep in thought.

Ning Kun raised his palm and mumbled something.

In a moment, a round light appeared in front of them.

“Mr. Qin, please go ahead.” Ning Kun politely cupped his hands and said. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He suppressed the excitement in his heart and strode into the Mystic Realm.
