2104 The Great Destruction Technique

The three golden lotuses appeared and emitted an immensely destructive power!

That power constantly surged, and a sense of danger instantly swept across everyone!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He could not help but step back, and his eyes emitted a hint of fear!

He could clearly feel the terrifying power contained within the three golden lotuses! Even with Wu Ji’s divine robe, Qin Yu still felt a chill down his spine!

“Is this Yao Xi crazy?” Not far away, Holy Son Jiang’s expression changed drastically!

He quickly looked at everyone and shouted, “Everyone, leave this place immediately!”

The crowd, who were already frightened, turned around and fled upon hearing this.

Even Saintess Gu’s face turned pale. She grabbed Jue Wu and dashed to the distance as fast as she could!

The three golden lotuses had a tremendously extraordinary background. They were the treasures passed down by the Yao family’s ancestors for saving lives.

And these three golden lotuses could only be possessed by the Holy Son.

Now that Yao Xi was using this item in a battle with his peer, it was evident that Yao Xi had gone completely crazy!

“Qin Yu, today, I will definitely kill you!” Yao Xi bellowed repeatedly, and the three golden lotuses in his hands were even more ever-changing and unpredictable.

One of the golden lotuses hovered above Yao Xi’s head, while the other two emitted a terrifying destructive power that constantly flickered.

At this moment, Qin Yu was also panicking. He hurriedly took out the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror and adjusted his internal qi to the extreme!

But even so, Qin Yu still felt immensely uneasy!

This kind of uneasiness came from the depths of his bones, and he could not resist at all!

“Worst scenario… I can only escape!” Qin Yu cursed in his heart.

However, once Qin Yu escaped, it would mean he had lost this battle!

It was so difficult for Qin Yu to accept. He was in such a sorry state in his first battle after becoming a Semi-Saint. He was afraid that his dao mind would be destroyed!

“Protecting my life is more important!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and planned to escape.

Qin Yu also knew very well that once he chose to escape, Yao Xi would probably put away the three golden lotuses! After all, these flowers were incomparably precious, and there were only three in the entire Yao family!

Just as Qin Yu was planning to escape, a light suddenly flashed in his mind!

This light… actually came from another divine sense? The divine sense left in the Traceless Immortal Scripture?

“It’s a secret technique of Wu Ji?” Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

At this critical moment, Qin Yu actually comprehended the secret technique in the Traceless Immortal Scripture!

“Great Destruction Technique!” A few big words flashed across Qin Yu’s mind. At this critical moment, Qin Yu actually comprehended Wu Ji’s supreme secret technique!

This secret technique was powerful and overbearing. In Wu Ji’s hands, it had once dominated everything! Who knew how many enemies he had killed in the path ahead of him?

He combined his physical body and spiritual power to the extreme and simplified his techniques to the utmost without any unnecessary complexity or hesitation. He had simplified all the dao techniques and fused them into one punch!

“Ah!”

Qin Yu shouted angrily. The Great Destruction Technique blossomed in his hands, radiating brilliance and engulfing mountains and rivers. Its radiance surged relentlessly, almost overwhelming and suppressing everything in its path!

After this punch, the word “destruction” could be seen faintly in the void. Its terrifying full power swept through the ages, deafening everyone. The entire universe trembled!

The Great Destruction Technique, its exceptional bravery, and fearlessness surpassed the world, and it was a secret technique of Wu Ji!

Wu Ji had always been known for being domineering. When facing his enemies, he would push them all. In his life, he would only sweep through everything!

At this moment, the secret technique had been passed down to Qin Yu. With his chaotic body, he threw out an incredibly domineering punch!

“Boom!”

The three golden lotuses collided violently with the word “destruction”!

What kind of terrifying collision was this? It had caused the spanning across all realms, reaching the farthest reaches of the heavens and the deepest depths of the earth, to tremble. That terrifying light covered everything!

The two terrifying forces collided in the air, causing a destructive explosion. An enormous light seemed to illuminate the entire world. The white light rushed into the sky, straight into the farthest reaches of the heavens as if it wanted to tear the sky apart. The light was so intense that it was impossible to look at it directly. It was a vast expanse of whiteness and even the most powerful divine sense could not penetrate.

Within the light, numerous rays of light and energy shockwaves spread out in all directions like a crazy storm wreaking havoc in the air. This shockwave was so strong that it could crush everything, causing endless fear to people.

Soon the few Yao family elders who were responsible for maintaining the battlefield could not take it anymore. Their faces turned pale as they spat out blood. Then they staggered back a few steps as their expression instantly turned tremendously pale!

“D*mn… Hurry up and retreat!”

Even if they were tremendously powerful, they could not withstand the collision between the two!

A few of them quickly fled far away as if they might be left behind here if they were a little slower!

The earth trembled under this power, and numerous cracks appeared on the ground, spreading like a massive spider web. The earth was instantly torn apart, forming a tremendous abyss that seemed to devour everything.

Those who were watching the battle retreated one after another under this destructive power, their faces revealing shock and fear. In front of this power, they felt infinitely weak, like a grain of sand in the sea, unable to resist.

In the sky, the collision between the three golden lotuses and the word “destruction” was like the final battle between heaven and earth. That destructive internal qi seemed to be about to devour the entire world, making people feel the fear of the end of the world.

In just a short while, the entire battlefield had changed beyond recognition. At this moment, everyone held their breaths in fear, waiting for the outcome of this terrifying conflict.

“Is this just a confrontation between two Semi-Saints…” The crowd watching from afar could not help but sigh. Many Semi-Saints came to watch, but their eyes were filled with a strong sense of helplessness.

Holy Son Jiang could not help but shake his head and say, “Even if it were me, I would probably die under their secret techniques.”

“How did Qin Yu do it? Could it be that he really can resist this golden lotus?” Saintess Gu sighed softly.

At this moment, Teng Zixu walked over.

“It’s Wu Ji’s Great Destruction Technique,” he said quietly. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Great Destruction Technique?” Holy Son Jiang and Saintess Gu looked up at Teng Zixu at the same time.

“Mmm. Wu Ji’s ‘Great Destruction Technique’ could sweep through everything. It’s domineering and peerless. In the past, Wu Ji could even rely on this technique to kill an immortal emperor whose vitality had been completely drained. It’s just that Qin Yu might not be able to unleash such terrifying might,” Teng Zixu continued.

Holy Son Jiang pursed his lips and muttered, “This kid actually obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture and even comprehended it!”

“I seem to have heard of the Great Destruction Technique,” Saintess Gu also said in a low voice.

Only Jue Wu said anxiously, “Will anything happen to Qin Yu?”
