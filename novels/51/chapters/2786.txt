Chapter 2787: The Old Paper

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi- Bo Studio

“The two powerful Creepy in the Nine Nether Cliff. They have died countless times, but it seems like they are unkillable. Could Chen Zhisha’s power just now made them feel danger and gathered here?”

Aiden frowned and analyzed.

“These people are already dead. They can’t be considered alive. If the energy didn’t hit them, they would never die.”

Qin Yu shook his head.

At this moment, Smoker Xie, Qin Ji, and countless people without Vitality Qi were like puppets in front of them.

They stared at a certain place and did not notice Qin Yu and the other two strangers.

Ping!

A crisp sound rang out as the jade bottle by Chang Mang’s waist that had

collected Creepy exploded.

It seemed to be triggered and emitted intense fluctuations.

The Creepy qi that was gathered earlier floated in the air, being torn away by countless bloody hands.

The Creepy qi let out a shrill sound and was torn into countless pieces instantly.

“Shh! Don’t move! Their target doesn’t seem to be us!” Qin Yu figured it out and quickly reminded the two of them.

This Creepy power was very strange.

The Creepy they had just killed seemed to be devouring each other in the jade bottle and a new Creepy was born.

It was like piecing together people. After devouring each other, they could form a new ‘person’.

Moreover, their power had not disappeared at all.

Instead, it became a new Creepy power after devouring each other.

This included the power they had gathered from the battle at the bottom of the cliff. Their consciousness was only stored in the jade bottle and had not been destroyed.

Qin Yu discovered that the power released from the jade bottle also carried an extremely evil consciousness.

Was the Creepy’s consciousness indestructible?

Qin Yu suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. They had used almost all their strength in the battle at the bottom of the cliff.

However, it did not even erase the consciousness. This was very shocking.

“There’s something wrong with this fu*king position. Look! Even Smoker Xie is only ranked third. The second is that ghost bride! I can’t even see the one ranked first clearly.”

Smoker Xie’s strength was already very terrifying in the Nine Nether Cliff.

Who knew how many people he had killed, but now he was only standing in third place.

“They seem to be waiting for something. Where their eyes are looking at seems to be half a page!”

Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze seeped out blood.

He saw half of the tattered piece of paper was in the storm. This half of the paper had been through countless years.

It was already covered in almost black creases. There seemed to be words written all over it.

When Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze came into contact with this piece of paper, his expression froze.

In the next moment, half of his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze exploded.

Only half a broken Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze left on his forehead.

“Don’t move!”

Qin Yu’s face was pale. He suddenly stretched out his hands to stop the two people who wanted to go forward.

Just what was this thing? It could completely cripple the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze with just a single glance.

His power of the night surged into the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, but he could not transfer the damage to the passageway.

In other words, this power was beyond their imagination.

The intense pain made Qin Yu’s breathing quicken.

The bloody colors that filled the sky when more and more Creepy descended made Qin Yu not dare to make the slightest move at all.

There would be Creepy staring at the three of them from time to time, but no one made a move for some reason.

With the presence of Qin Ji, who had survived the number one kulapati’s attack, Smoker Xie, and the Creepy ranked first that he couldn’t even see, Qin Yu had no intention of attacking.

‘Qin Yu, are you alright?”

Aiden’s voice sounded in his sea of consciousness.

“I’m fine. I suspect that a powerful force has awakened here. This force is directly related to the birth of these people, which is why so many powerful Creepy have gathered here! Moreover, they seem to be very afraid. They don’t move although there are so many people who can easily kill us.” Qin Yu carefully analyzed the situation for the two of them.

“It’s very possible! Perhaps we can try to sneak away. I can also sense a terrifying power that seems to be about to awaken. My body is very uneasy!” The elven race had a strong sense of danger.

Since it could make him feel this kind of danger, the thing in front of them was almost fatal. Moreover, it was tough for them to resist.

“Why don’t I understand what you’re talking about? Why don’t I give it a try?”

Chang Mang asked.

“Don’t!”

“Don’t!”

Two terrified voices simultaneously stopped Chang Mang. If this punch was made, they would probably be buried together with him.

“Wait a little longer. It seems that many people are approaching here. Don’t be anxious!”

Although Qin Yu also wanted to leave this place, he sensed that someone was heading towards where they were.

They probably sensed the internal qi at the bottom of the cliff. They could use these people to test it out.

However, they were also very cautious. They did not come here rashly. Instead, they slowly entrenched themselves in the vicinity.

These Creepy did not move at all for one week. They just waited silently.

At this moment, Qin Yu also felt that he could not hold it in any longer. He had suffered some injuries.

The most important thing was that Meng Jing’s injuries were unknown. If he dragged it on, he did not know what would happen.

In this suffocating flow of time, someone finally couldn’t take it anymore.

He descended directly and a powerful energy was born in his hand.

As he landed, the energy swept out completely.

Whoosh!

Countless bloody hands suddenly appeared almost at the instant of the explosion.

The cultivator who appeared was torn into countless pieces, not even letting go of his blood.

“What a strange method! The body dies but it is Indestructible, and the Dao dies but it doesn’t disappear.”

A sword light cut off countless tentacles, but more tentacles appeared in the next moment.

They wanted to take down the young man who had attacked. The young man slashed his foot with the sword in his hand.

Those tentacles that crossed the boundary turned into dust one after another, unable to get close to him in the slightest.

As the battle began, those who had been hiding in the dark finally made their move.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Suddenly, the silence at the bottom of the Nine Nether Cliff was broken.

Almost all of these people were from Nine Nether Cliff or nearby. They had sensed this weak internal qi and came over.

Those who could sense this power were almost all top-notch cultivators.

When these people appeared, Qin Yu felt many powers that surpassed level 9 Dao Consciousness.

Aiden and Chang Mang also recognized some of them. They were top-notch

martial artists who had trained in the Nine Nether Cliff.

Taking advantage of the Nine Nether Cliff riot this time, they enjoyed the benefits of a favorable position.

“It seems that my guess is correct. Something that can gather these Creepy is probably extraordinary.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes..
