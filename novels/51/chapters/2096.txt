The internal qi in Qin Yu’s body began to surge, and he was prepared to attack at any time.

As for Yao Xi, his internal qi was calm, and he did not have the slightest intention of attacking.

“Brother Yao, you’re not going to stop fighting, are you? Why? Does our presence affect your performance?” Holy Son Jiang said nastily.

Yao Xi ignored Holy Son Jiang. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You and I naturally have to fight, but not now, not at this moment.”

Qin Yu raised her eyebrows and said, “Do you need to choose a place for your burial?”

“Three days later, I’ll wait for you at Mount Phoenix!” Yao Xi shouted. “I hope you can come on time!”

Yao Xi turned around and left after speaking.

“Hey, don’t go. Are you leaving just like that? This is so boring! Why do we have to wait for three days?” Holy Son Jiang said impatiently.

However, Yao Xi ignored him and left.

After he left, Holy Son Jiang walked forward and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, do you need my help?”

Qin Yu shot a glance at him and said, “A mere Yao Xi is nothing in my eyes.”

“Oh?” Holy Son Jiang raised his eyebrows, smiled, and said, “What about me?”

“You too.” Qin Yu spread her hands and said.

“Tsk, you’re a little arrogant! When I have the chance, I’ll definitely teach you a lesson,” Holy Son Jiang sneered and said.

Qin Yu smiled but did not say anything, but he was looking forward to it deep down.

This would be the first time he fought with a powerful opponent since he became a Semi-Saint. How could he not look forward to it?

“Brother Qin, please be careful. Yao Xi is not simple. Don’t underestimate him,” Saintess Gu reminded.

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Thank you for your reminder, Saintess Gu. It’s fine. I’m not afraid of him.”

Holy Son Jiang waved his hand and said, “Stop talking about those things. While I’m free, why don’t you come with me to my mansion for three days?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment. It was only three days and did not seem worth returning to Thunder Courtyard. Thus he agreed.

Then Qin Yu and Saintess Gu followed behind Holy Son Jiang and rushed toward his mansion.

Holy Son Jiang’s mansion was located on a mountain peak. It occupied a vast area and had ancient buildings. The courtyard was full of rare flowers and trees, and the scenery was beautiful and delightful.

“What’s that sound?” Qin Yu frowned slightly and asked.

“Holy Son Jiang has a hobby. He likes to raise all kinds of exotic beasts.”

“Exotic beasts? Qin Yu was stunned and could not help but mutter, “What a peculiar hobby!”

After entering the mansion, everything was as Saintess Gu had said. There were hundreds of rare beasts here, and each was tremendously precious!

Qin Yu was secretly shocked. With a casual glance, he saw several tremendously precious exotic beasts.

“Flying Winged Dragon?” Qin Yu had only taken two steps forward when he saw an incredibly ferocious Demonic Beast. Its arms were tremendously sturdy, and its internal qi was extraordinary.

“Nine-Headed Lion? Azure Water Dragon?” The more Qin Yu saw, the more shocked he became! The mutated beasts raised by Holy Son Jiang were all incredibly rare and ferocious existences!

Holy Son Jiang waved his hand and said, “This is nothing. I had asked someone to get them out of Azure Rock Forest. I’ll kill one and roast it later!”

Qin Yu could not help but be secretly speechless.

This Holy Son Jiang actually raised these mutated beasts like pigs and even treated them as food to fill his stomach. It was truly extravagant.

“Now that the demon race is about to emerge. When they discover this, they will definitely not let you off.” Qin Yu could not help but shake his head.

“That’s why I must eat all these beasts before they emerge. That way, they won’t know.”

Qin Yu was speechless for a moment. Holy Son Jiang’s thoughts were indeed unconventional.

Although these Demonic Beasts were quite ferocious, their intelligence was not very high. They were completely different from the demon race born in the depths of the Azure Rock Forest that had divine senses. They looked like beasts.

That night, Holy Son Jiang roasted an Azure Water Dragon and invited Qin Yu and Holy Saintess Gu to enjoy it together.

The meat of this rare exotic beast was delicious and full of spiritual energy. It tasted indescribably wonderful.

Apart from that, Holy Son Jiang also took out a pot of extremely precious Drunken Dragon Wine and invited Qin Yu and Holy Saintess Gu Gu to drink together.

The Drunken Dragon Wine was crystal clear and emitted a rich fragrance. After entering the mouth, a dragon’s roar seemed to be echoing in the mouth. It was as if one was in a dragon’s pool and tiger’s den and completely immersed in the wonder of the experience. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Qin Yu drank a mouthful, sighed, and said, “This wine is indeed worthy of its reputation. I didn’t expect you to hide such a good thing.”

Holy Son Jiang smiled mischievously and said, “It’s just that when I feel bored, I like to collect some rare treasures. It wasn’t easy for me to get this jug of Drunken Dragon Wine.”

Saintess Gu took a sip and praised, “This wine tastes wonderful. I’m afraid only immortals would get to drink it.”

“Tsk tsk, I didn’t expect Holy Son Jiang to be so generous,” Qin Yu said half-jokingly.

Holy Son Jiang waved his hand and said, “It’s nothing. If you don’t drink it, it will turn bad. I’ll then have to feed it to the animals. Instead of feeding the animals, it’s better to let you guys drink it.”

“F*ck you!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse secretly. Saintess Gu could not help but laugh by the side.

After three rounds of wine, Saintess Gu suddenly said, “What do you think of the demon race from the depths of Azure Rock Forest?”

When this topic was brought up, the atmosphere suddenly became somewhat solemn.

Particularly, Qin Yu, his expression was a little unnatural.

“This person is not weak. He killed several heirs in one go and even escaped from the siege of many elders. His strength is not weaker than ours,” Holy Son Jiang said in a deep voice.

Saintess Gu had the same opinion. She added, “The depths of Azure Rock Forest are tremendously mysterious. According to legend, there are countless secret buries hidden inside. The resources there must be incomparably rich. Now that it has been so long, nobody knows what monsters are hiding in the depths.”

Holy Son Jiang shrugged and said, “Even True Saints will die if they enter. This is sufficient to explain that there are existences stronger than True Saints hiding in the depths. If they make a move, it will be troublesome.”

“Not necessarily so, “Saintess Gu said. “Being able to kill a True Saint in the depths of Azure Rock Forest doesn’t mean they have an existence that surpasses a True Saint. For example, they might have formations, powerful magical artifacts, or even the remnant souls of the ancestors of the demon race. But once they leave Azure Rock Forest, they can’t use them.”

“Saintess Gu is right. If they were really that powerful, they would have attacked long ago,” Qin Yu quickly said.

Holy Son Jiang waved his hand and said, “Why do we care so much? Live one day at a time, and deal with things as they come.”
