Chapter 1098: Chapter 1,098, a terrifying demonic beast! 

Everyone was stunned by Chang Mang’s ferocity.

“This kid...”Zhuang Teng opened his mouth, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.

Chang Mang threw the Fang into the sea and retreated.

The black dragon shark seemed to have been completely enraged by Chang Mang. Its huge body emitted a strange light, and its entire body trembled non-stop.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the blue dragon shark suddenly shook, and the entire surface of the sea was instantly moved.

The sea water turned into rays of light that covered the sky and earth as they spread towards Chang Mang!

Chang Mang was not afraid at all. He clenched his fist and smashed it over.

However, this was after all sea water. After touching it, the sea water immediately dispersed, and Chang Mang’s fist instantly penetrated through it.

“Splash!”

The sea water suddenly covered Chang Mang’s body, and it was like numerous chains, causing Chang Mang to be unable to move.

Chang Mang opened his mouth and roared angrily, and a bloody light erupted from his entire body, causing the sea water that was bound to his body to make a splash, but he was unable to break free!

“Pa!”

The black dragon shark’s tail shook, and it directly sent Chang Mang flying.

This attack was extremely heavy and powerful. Even Chang Mang’s body was sent flying, and cracks appeared on his body!

“Hua!”

The black dragon shark’s huge body charged towards Chang Mang, and its two huge palms slammed fiercely towards Chang Mang!

Under this palm strike, Chang Mang’s body was instantly covered in bloody scars!

“YOU MOTHERF * cker!”Chang Mang was instantly enraged. Although his body was sticky, the more he fought, the braver he became, and the more irritable he became!

“Swoosh!”

The black dragon shark’s two tusks expanded and its huge body approached Chang Mang. The two tusks were approaching Chang Mang’s body!

Chang Mang struggled with all his might. The seawater kept shaking as if it was going to break free at any moment. However, it was too late now!

At this critical moment, a holy light flashed and blocked the black dragon shark’s tusks!

The one who attacked was Yao Meng. Her soft body floated up and her hands shook slightly. The rays of light moved along with her.

“Pa!”

Yao Meng’s palm shook and the light slapped onto the shark’s body, sending it flying several meters!

Chang Mang also took this opportunity to completely break free from the restraints.

“Everyone, attack together and kill this beast.”Kong Yun’s body shook and a long spear appeared in his hand.

Zhuang Teng and the others also stood up. The martial saint’s internal Qi instantly erupted and filled the entire surface of the sea.

The old man who was not far away snorted coldly. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Don’t worry, everyone has one.”

After he finished speaking, the old man closed his eyes slightly and muttered in a low voice.

In just a moment.

The surface of the sea once again erupted!

One, two, three...

A total of more than ten demonic beasts had erupted from the bottom of the sea!

Each demonic beast had already stepped into the martial Saint Stage!

When they saw this scene, everyone’s expressions became somewhat unsightly.

It was already difficult to deal with just one azure dragon shark, and now, so many demonic beasts had appeared!

“I’m afraid everyone will have to do their best,”Yao Meng said.

Kong Yun held his long spear in his hand and snorted, “Then let’s have a great battle!”

“Miss Yao, you stay behind to protect the hull,”Zhuang Teng suddenly said.

Yao Meng was stunned. She frowned slightly, and a trace of worry flashed across her big eyes.

“Don’t worry, we are not to be trifled with. Moreover, if we want to protect the hull, we need strong spiritual power to support it. I’m afraid no one other than you can complete this mission,”Zhuang Teng said.

Although Yao Meng rarely made a move, everyone seemed to know in their hearts that her spiritual force was extremely dense and her strength was unfathomable.

When Yao Meng saw this, she no longer tried to shirk. She nodded and said, “Okay.”

A great battle was about to break out at any moment. When several martial saints joined hands, it was as if they were going to cause a tsunami. It was as if the entire world was shaking at this moment!

Even though Yao Meng had a strong spiritual force, she was still somewhat unable to endure a great battle of this level.

Initially, she was able to protect the ship with all her strength. However, as time passed, her internal Qi began to suffer as the ship began to shake more and more violently.

Layers of perspiration appeared on her pure white forehead as her delicate body trembled slightly.

The huge ship was shaking more and more violently as if it was about to capsize.

“I... I can’t hold on much longer...”Yao Meng gritted her teeth and said in a low voice.

However, this battle had sunk into a state of anxiety. After all, those were demonic beasts at the martial saint stage and there were many of them. It was almost impossible to end the battle in a short period of time.

The violent shaking caused Qin Yu, who was in closed-door cultivation, to wake up.

He frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “What happened? Did We encounter a Tsunami?”

Qin Yu stood up and looked out of the window.

The scene outside the window could not help but give Qin Yu a big shock.

“So many demonic beasts? !”Qin Yu was stunned for a moment before he said with wild joy, “Damn it, if a martial saint demonic beast could obtain its inner core, wouldn’t it be a Fortune?”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly put away the jar and rushed to the deck.

It was also at this moment that Yao Meng could not hold on any longer. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Even if she tried her best to protect the ship, her spiritual power was already depleted. She could only shake and almost fell to the ground.

The waves whistled and the ship immediately flipped backwards!

At this time, a golden light flashed and enveloped the entire ship, stabilizing the body of the ship that was about to flip over.
