Chapter 847: Chapter 847, returning with a full load!

Looking at the two naked martial saints, the surrounding people could not help but Snicker softly.

“Little Bastard, you will die a horrible death!”One of the martial saints scolded angrily.

Qin Yu glared at him and said, “If you dare to talk nonsense again, I will make you eat SH * T. Do you believe me?”

That martial saint immediately shut up and did not dare to say a word.

He did not doubt that Qin Yu would really do such a thing.

After he had finished dealing with these two martial saints, Qin Yu also dared to get down to business.

He walked quickly to Yao Meng and said, “How is it? Did you get the herbs?”

Yao Meng nodded slightly. She took out a ten-thousand-year-old herb and handed it to Qin Yu.

“Just this one,”Yao Meng said.

Qin Yu put away the herbs and nodded, “Miss Yao, thank you very much.”

Yao Meng smiled. “You’re welcome. By the way, how did you do it?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Because their strength was suppressed, including yours.”

Yao Meng’s beautiful eyes flashed with a trace of surprise. She tried to activate the internal Qi in her body, and sure enough, all the internal Qi was suppressed.

“No Wonder,”Yao Meng Snickered.

Qin Yu did not have time to waste with Yao Meng. He directly swept his gaze across the crowd and said, “I urgently need the ten-thousand-year-old herbs. If anyone has any, you can come and exchange with me.”

“I have all the heaven rank spells and the Heavenly Tribulation Pill formulas. I guarantee that no one will be at a disadvantage.”

Qin Yu was truly like a small peddler as he shouted repeatedly at the scene.

The scene of Qin Yu beating up the martial saint was still vivid in his mind. This undoubtedly added a layer of halo to Qin Yu.

“Do you all want to be as strong and powerful as me? Do you all want to beat up the Martial Saint Like Me? Then quickly come and exchange!”Qin Yu shouted loudly.

After shouting loudly, Qin Yu once again exchanged for a stalk of ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

Seeing that it was almost done, Qin Yu put away all these herbs.

“The exit will open tomorrow, right?”Qin Yu looked at Yao Meng and asked.

Yao Meng nodded and said, “Yes, not bad.”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “No, it’s too slow. I want to leave now.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked quickly to the front of Le Xian.

“Mr. LE, please open the exit of this mystic realm. I want to leave,”said Qin Yu.

Le Xian glared at him and said, “Qin Yu, you are so disrespectful! You insulted me when I helped you!”

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Be content. It’s already good that I didn’t Let You Be Naked. You are so old. Don’t you want to be as shameful as them?”

Le Xian was stunned. Although he was extremely unhappy, he didn’t dare to say anything.

Hence, Le Xian could only follow Qin Yu’s request and open the exit of the mystic realm.

An exit appeared in front of everyone, but no one seemed to want to leave.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He quickly returned to the position of the Yin Heart.

Raising his head to look at the Yin Heart, Qin Yu was ecstatic!

“What an unexpected gain,”Qin Yu said while stroking his chin.

Two stalks of ten-thousand-year-old herbs and one yin heart were enough for Qin Yu to enter seclusion to make a breakthrough!

He reached out his hand and grabbed the yin heart. Then, he put it away.

As the Yin Heart was put away, the yin qi that pervaded the entire mystic realm slowly disappeared.

The suppressive force also began to dissipate.

Of course, Qin Yu knew that he should not stay here for long. He walked quickly to the exit and waved his hand, “Everyone, we will meet again if fate permits!”

“Don’t let him go! We have already recovered our internal Qi. Kill him!”A martial saint shouted.

Qin Yu grinned and said, “F * ck your mother. If you have the ability, then come out. Let’s see if the Dao Guardian will be beaten to death!”

After throwing out these words, Qin Yu ran away.

The moment he stepped into the exit, Qin Yu finally escaped from this mystic realm!

“TSK tsk, I’ve finally escaped,”Qin Yu said excitedly.

He had gained a lot this time. To Qin Yu, it was simply an unexpected harvest.

“I’ve also seized two martial saint weapons,”Qin Yu said with some excitement.

Then, Qin Yu calculated the time.

There was only one week left before the martial saint power disappeared.

Qin Yu did not dare to waste time. He was not in a hurry to go to Qing city. Instead, he took the lead and rushed to the Slaughter Immortal sect.

At this moment, near the Church of the Massacre Immortal, there was a teleportation portal that was flashing with light.

This teleportation portal was not particularly eye-catching, but it was still clearly visible.

On this trip, Qin Yu’s actions were extremely exaggerated. Even at the airport, he had to deliberately reveal his identity.

The purpose was very simple. It was to throw a smoke bomb and make everyone think that he was in seclusion at the Church of the massacre immortal to stall for time.

After arriving at the Church of the Massacre Immortal, Qin Yu changed his clothes and rushed to Qing city.

He arrived near the entrance of the secret realm of Qing city.

Qin Yu looked around and made sure that there was no one around before he slowly raised his hand.

He opened the entrance of the secret realm according to the secret key given by Zheng Ke.

The secret realm was very spacious and quiet.

In the huge secret realm, there were only Su Qian and Zheng Ke.

After seeing Qin Yu, Zheng Ke walked over quickly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You’re back so soon?”Zheng Ke asked with some doubt.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, time is tight. I have to go into seclusion quickly.”

“Seclusion?”Zheng Ke raised his eyebrows.

“Do you want to try to break through to the Great Circle?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know. I Can’t be sure exactly which realm you will break through to.”

“Remember, no one is allowed to disturb me while I’m in closed-door cultivation. If I’m not careful, I’ll die, understand?”Qin Yu said with a serious expression.

Zheng Ke patted his chest and said, “Don’t worry. With me here, no one can disturb you.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He found a room, then closed the door and closed his eyes slightly.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, it was night time.

In the darkness, there was light from time to time.

Looking from the outside to the inside, one could see that Qin Yu’s acupuncture points were shining.

In the Silence, a figure appeared at the door.

This person was none other than Zheng Ke!

Zheng Ke stood at the door, his face full of gloom and viciousness.

He tried to raise his palm, knocked on the door, and whispered, “Mr. Qin?”

There was no movement in the room, only beams of light.

Zheng Ke narrowed his eyes, pushed the door open, and Strode in!

Seeing Qin Yu sitting on the bed, Zheng Ke sneered.

“You really went into seclusion,”Zheng Ke sneered.

“Qin Yu, you are really naive. Do you really think I will work for you? In your dreams!”

“As long as I kill you, the mark you left in my mind will disappear!”

“So... you’d better die!”
