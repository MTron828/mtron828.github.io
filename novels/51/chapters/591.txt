Chapter 592: In Cahoots Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The head of the supposedly indestructible Qingfu Tortoise exploded at this moment!

What appeared before everyone’s eyes was a tall golden giant with a cold gaze!

His golden fist looked awe-inspiring and invincible.

At this moment, even Yan Jinyao and the others couldn’t help but feel shocked!

“How is this possible...” Yan Guiyi’s expression was extremely unsightly, and the killing intent in his heart increased by a few degrees!

It had only been a few days, but Qin Yu’s cosmic form had improved so much. In time, what kind of level would he reach?

He didn’t dare to imagine!

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly looked coldly at Yan Guiyi.

Although it was only a glance, there was a strong sense of warning in it.

It was as if he was saying, “Can your Black Gold Stone withstand this punch?”

Yan Guiyi’s pupils dilated, and his expression was extremely gloomy.

He couldn’t help but clench his fists, and a strong killing intent emerged from the bottom of his heart.

At this moment, Qin Yu flipped the Qingfu Tortoise’s body, and then his huge hands grabbed the Qingfu Tortoise before tearing it into two halves!

An inner core fell into Qin Yu’s hands.

This inner core was colorful, like a rainbow, and it was completely different from an ordinary inner core.

Qin Yu’s body slowly returned to normal, and a layer of sweat appeared on his forehead.

Even though Qin Yu had already stepped into the Martial Marquis realm, it was still somewhat difficult for him to use the cosmic form.

Qin Yu took the inner core and walked in front of Yan Guiyi.

He handed the inner core to Yan Guiyi and said coldly, “It’s a pity that the Qingfu Tortoise couldn’t kill me.”

Yan Guiyi’s expression changed slightly again. He took the inner core and couldn’t help but snort coldly.

Not far away, He Teng and Han Wei’s expressions became even more unsightly.

“Didn’t you say that the Qingfu Tortoise could definitely tear Qin Yu apart?” Han Wei said coldly.

He Teng glanced at Han Wei and frowned. “I didn’t expect Qin Yu’s strength to be this powerful...” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Han Wei gritted his teeth.

As long as someone praised Qin Yu, he would be filled with anger!

Han Wei was unwilling to admit that the guy he had trampled on previously had already surpassed him!

“My mood back then was exactly the same as yours.” He Teng seemed to see through Han Wei’s thoughts.

Han Wei glanced at He Teng and snorted coldly. “You? You’re just a lowly ant. How could you understand my thoughts?”

When He Teng heard this, the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but curl up into a sneer.

“The stuck-up attitude of you noblemen is really disgusting at times,” He Teng said sinisterly.

Han Wei snorted. “You’d better pay attention to your attitude when talking to me. I can’t kill Qin Yu, but killing you isn’t a problem.”

He Teng didn’t pay attention to Han Wei, not because he was afraid of Han Wei, but because Han Wei was a member of Jingdu’s upper class. If he offended him here, Yan Guiyi wouldn’t let it slide.

Qin Yu found a place to sit cross-legged. He absorbed the internal spiritual energy from the bottom of the sea to recover the internal qi in his body.

Not far away, Demonic Beasts fell one after another, but none of them could be compared to the Qingfu Tortoise.

After an unknown period of time, it was finally Chang Mang’s turn to make a move.

Qin Yu’s eyes slowly opened at this moment.

Chang Mang was facing a huge Demonic Beast called the Bloody Rain Dolphin. Its body was huge and its strength was extraordinary.

Although it wasn’t as strong as the Qingfu Tortoise, it was much stronger than the other Demonic Beasts.

Obviously, Yan Guyi did this on purpose. After all, Chang Mang had contradicted him before.

Yan Guyi looked coldly in Chang Mang’s direction, and the corner of his mouth curled into a sneer.

“You low-level trash, you should also pay... Huh?!” Before Yan Guyi finished, his expression suddenly changed drastically!

Chang Mang roared angrily, and his entire body was covered in red! His towering rage made Chang Mang look like a ferocious beast that had lost its rationality!

“Boom!”

His crimson fist smashed onto the Bloody Rain Dolphin’s body fiercely!

With just one punch, his extremely powerful fist had shattered the Bloody Rain Dolphin’s body before turning it into a rain of blood that filled the sky!

“How... how could this be?!” Yan Gui flew into a rage!

He could accept Qin Yu surviving, but what was with Chang Mang?!

“What’s going on with these bottom-class people! These d*mn b*stards!” Yan Guiyi thought to himself angrily!

Chang Mang dug out the inner core and walked to Yan Guiyi.

He handed the inner core to Yan Guiyi, snorted lightly, and walked to the side.

The veins on Yan Guiyi’s forehead bulged. Because of his anger, his whole body was trembling!

“These bottom class people must die, they must die!” Yan Guiyi said angrily.

Not far away, Qin Yu was also a bit surprised.

“As expected of a Saintly Body,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“It seems that Jiang Gu’s Saintly Body hasn’t been developed yet.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think that it was a bit of a waste.

The summoning of the Demonic Beasts continued, and several more Demonic Beasts fell.

At this moment, it was finally He Teng’s turn.

Qin Yu looked coldly in He Teng’s direction. He also wanted to know what kind of ability He Teng had now.

He Teng’s entire body was wrapped in a black robe, so no one could see the expression on his face clearly.

When facing the Demonic Beasts, He Teng’s methods were completely different from Qin Yu’s.

He didn’t rely on his physical body. Instead, he held a huge amount of energy in his hand.

The strength of this energy was beyond imagination. It was like a pure energy ball.

Even Yan Guiyi was shocked by this energy. Such dense energy wasn’t something that a newly advanced Martial Marquis could summon.

“Boom!”

He Teng flicked his palm lightly, and this huge energy ball stirred up raging waves on the surface of the sea!

The enormous Demonic Beast seemed to be unable to withstand a single blow, and was instantly torn apart by the energy ball!

He Teng’s finger pointed forward gently, and the inner core fell into his hand.

Qin Yu’s brows furrowed, and his face carried a hint of coldness.

He Teng’s strength was clearly beyond imagination.

Moreover, this was definitely not his full ability. After all, when facing the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, he would definitely conceal his trump card.

“It seems that the guy hidden in his body is very remarkable,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He Teng took the inner core and walked to Yan Guiyi.

He handed the inner core to Yan Guiyi and turned to leave.

At this time, Yan Guiyi reached out and pulled He Teng.

“Are you He Teng, who is known as the number one in the Central Plains?” Yan Guiyi asked coldly.

He Teng bowed slightly and said with a smile, “That’s just an empty title. It has already become a joke.”

As he said this, He Teng glanced at Qin Yu, who wasn’t far away.

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes and said, “I remember that you have a grudge against Qin Yu, right? Do you want to take revenge?”

He Teng said with some surprise, “Captain Yan, what do you mean?”

Yan Guiyi put his hands behind his back and said, “I can give you a chance to take revenge and let you join the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”
