Chapter 1123: Chapter 1,123, the Reckless Chang Mang 

Chang Mang, who was standing at the side, was even more boorish. He was confused by what he heard.

“I’ll go find him now,”said pavilion master.

“I’ll go with you!”Chang Mang said hurriedly.

Pavilion master glanced at Chang Mang and said, “You have a rough personality and can easily ruin things. It’s better for you to stay.”

“No!”Chang Mang was extremely determined.

“Qin Yu said that you are his benefactor and that you are my benefactor. Since he is not here, I must protect your safety!”

Pavilion master opened her mouth and was speechless for a moment.

She could not persuade Chang Mang and could only nod her head and agree.

Hence, the two of them walked towards Tian Zong’s room.

Tian Zong seemed to have expected pavilion master to come. Hence, he had asked Yun Long to wait at the door in advance.

Yun Long’s face was dark and cold. He was different from Tian Zong. Tian Zong would be infatuated with the mortal world, but Yun Long would not. All he could think about was killing and revenge.

In Yun Long’s opinion, if it were not for the pavilion master’s interference, the Heaven Gate would have already become a river of blood by now.

This also caused Yun long to have no good face for the pavilion master.

“Is senior Tian Zong Here?”The pavilion master asked, somewhat knowing the answer.

Yun long replied coldly, “Of course. My master already expected you to come.”

Hearing this, pavilion master nodded slightly and was about to enter.

At this moment, Yun long stood in front of Pavilion Master.

He looked at pavilion master coldly and said, “Bitch, I’m warning you. You’d better not give my master any more bewitching soup, or else... I’ll definitely kill you!”

“Little B * stard, didn’t your mother teach you how to be an upright person? You’re a dignified seven feet tall man, yet you call others master? Your F * cking brain is filled with SH * t, right?”Chang Mang at the side immediately cursed.

Yun Long’s face turned black, and he said coldly, “Who are you to have the right to shout in front of me?”

“I’m your father! Why Don’t you try competing again?”Chang Mang took a step forward, and his fierce face also shook.

Yun Long’s body was emitting a faint anger.

“Kid, are you courting death? Do you really think I don’t dare to kill you?”Yun Long said coldly.

“Come, come, come. If you don’t F * cking come, you’re My Son!”Chang Mang rolled up his sleeves and walked toward Yun long.

“Chang Mang, don’t Be Rude!”Pavilion master hurriedly stretched out his hand to stop Chang Mang.

Although Chang Mang was a boorish person, he still respected pavilion master quite a lot, so he stopped at this point.

“Kid, I will remember you,”Yun Long said gloomily.

Chang mang sneered, “If you don’t remember your own father, will it work?”

“YOU MOTHERF * cker...”

“YOU MOTHERF * cker!”Yun long hadn’t finished scolding when he was rebuked by Chang Mang.

Seeing that the two of them were about to fight at any time, Tian Zong’s voice came from the room.

“Yun Long, let them in,”Tian Zong said.

Yun long suppressed his anger and moved aside.

Chang Mang snorted. He followed behind the pavilion master and Strode into Tian Zong’s room.

After entering the room, tea had been brewed on the table.

What was more surprising was that there was a television hanging on the wall. The television was broadcasting an indescribable scene.

“Old Pervert,”Chang Mang couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

Tian Zong stretched out his hand and poured a cup of tea for pavilion master.

“Tomorrow is the agreed date. What reason do you have to stop me?”Tian Zong said indifferently.

Pavilion master smiled lightly and said, “Senior Tian Zong, of course I have no reason to stop you. After all, this is an agreement between you and me.”

“Oh?”This made Tian Zong somewhat surprised.

At this moment, pavilion master changed the topic and smiled, “Since ancient times, the Almighty Realm has been like a divine dragon in the sky. No matter which generation, it is an existence that surpasses the people of the world. It is even worshipped as a god.”

“You should also know that in the hearts of martial artists, the Almighty Realm has always been filled with a mysterious radiance, mysterious, and sacred.”

Tian Zong said indifferently, “So?”

Pavilion master smiled and said, “In the current era, the Almighty has not appeared for many years. You are the only one, and also the only one who truly let the world see the Almighty. In their hearts, you have long been sacred and inviolable.”

Tian Zong laughed out loud. He was about to retort when pavilion master continued, “This is not just nonsense. You can see for yourself.”

As he spoke, the pavilion master handed the phone to Tian Zong.

Tian Zong took the phone and glanced at the contents of the martial arts forum, as well as the comments.

“Normally, you and Heaven Gate have irreconcilable conflicts, but even so, the disciples of Heaven Gate still regard you as a god and are full of admiration for you. I think you should have heard of it,”the pavilion master continued.

Tian Zong took a sip of tea and did not speak.

“Senior Tian Zong, do you really have the heart to kill them? A bunch of innocent people, a bunch of people who regard you as a god’s idol.”Pavilion master went straight to the point.

Tian Zong glanced at pavilion master and said indifferently, “Since you say that I am their god, then for the sake of God, isn’t it necessary to sacrifice? Aren’t they willing to sacrifice their lives for God?”

When Chang Mang heard this, anger instantly filled his brain. He opened his mouth and was about to speak when pavilion master hurriedly grabbed his rough hand.

However, how could this escape the eyes of a mighty figure?

The killing intent that Chang Mang was emitting had long been captured by Tian Zong’s eyes.

“You Want to kill me?”Tian Zong narrowed his eyes and said.

Pavilion master’s expression changed slightly. She hurriedly explained, “Senior Tian Zong, he...” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Shut up.”However, Tian Zong directly interrupted pavilion master’s words. After that, he continued to look at Chang Mang and said with a cold tone, “You want to kill me?”
