Chapter 1730: Chao Shou Took Action Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Chao Shou’s words were like a cardiac stimulant injected into Yong Ji’s heart.

Yong Ji was overjoyed. He quickly bowed and said, “Thank you, Sect Master Chao.”

Without staying any longer, he left Xihuang immediately.

After he left, Chao Cang looked at Chao Shou and said, “Sect Master, didn’t you go to find Qin Yu? Why don’t I see him?”

“He escaped.” Chao Shou replied indifferently, “But don’t worry. I’ll find him now. ”

!!

Finishing, he took out the pearl, quickly showing Qin Yu’s location.

“Let’s see where you can run to.” He laughed coldly.

In the North Plain.

Standing before Yuan Xiu, Yong Ji reported the matter to him.

Upon hearing it, Yuan Xiu could not help but sneer. “What pearl? It has such a magical effect?”

“I don’t know.” Yong Ji shook his head. “But I’ve personally experienced how terrifying that pearl is. It’s like a Saint Weapon…

Yuan Xiu could not help but frown and said coldly, “He wants the inheritance of the Immortal Slaying Sect?”

“Exactly. I’ve promised him for the time being. If he can kill Xiao Sheng, everything can be discussed. If he can’t, we can’t keep our promise either,” Yong Ji answered.

Although Yuan Xiu was a little reluctant, he had no other choice.

“Master, how long will it take for your body to be completely resurrected?” Sima Bei requested humbly.

“It will take at least half a month to a month,” Yuan Xiu replied coldly.

“That’s so long.” Sima Bei frowned.

“If it weren’t for a long time, I wouldn’t have gone to Xihuang,” Yuan Xiu said with a snort.

A month would be more than enough for Xiao Sheng to reach the Reversion Void stage.

It might take even less than a month. So, he had to get rid of him as soon as possible.

In Nanzhou.

It was a beautiful day, and the cultivators’ lives seemed to have returned to normal.

Yuan Xiu had lost to Xiao Sheng, and everyone was no longer worried about the arrival of the enemies from the North Plain.

But at this moment, a vast scene suddenly flashed in the sky!

It covered almost the entire heaven and earth, and more than half of Nanzhou could see it.

“Eh? What’s that?”

“It seems to be the deed of Xihuang!”

“They still haven’t given up? Even Yuan Xiu have lost, and they still dare to attack us?”

Just as everyone was in shock, a scene appeared in the sky.

It showed the conversation between Chao Shou and Yong Ji.

During the conversation, they witnessed the power of the pearl in Chao Shou’s hand with their own eyes.

Yong Ji was pressed to the ground, bleeding non-stop, unable to resist!

Seeing this, everyone turned extremely pale.

“That pearl… What was it? It actually has such great power!”

“Yong Ji is at the Reversion Void stage… and he can’t even resist at all?”

“Did you all hear that? Chao Shou said that he would arrive in Nanzhou in three days…”

“It’s over. We’ve just sent away Yuan Xiu, and now an even more terrifying Chao Shou has arrived! Who is this Chao Shou?”

The question left the people who had already calmed down panicking again.

Somewhere in Nanzhou.

Xiao Sheng also raised his head to look at the scene in the sky.

He furrowed his brows slightly, feeling a little worried.

“A Saint Weapon?” he muttered in a low voice.

If it were a Saint Weapon indeed, he definitely wouldn’t stand a chance at all.

A single wisp of Holy Power was enough to kill more than half of the cultivators of the Reversion Void Stage!

Suddenly, the scene in the sky changed again.

Chao Shou had found Qin Yu’s exact location with the pearl.

“How did this happen?” It stunned everyone into a panic.

“With this pearl, he could easily locate a person’s exact location. In that case, wouldn’t Xiao Sheng have nowhere to hide? I’m afraid he can’t even stall for time.”

“This Chao Shou… He’s terrifying!”

“With this pearl, he’s probably even more terrifying than Yuan Xiu!”

“It’s over. If Xiao Sheng dies, no one will be able to stop Yuan Xiu.”

For a moment, the entire Nanzhou fell into franticness.

Many sects had gathered together to discuss countermeasures.

They quickly made arrangements. Some chose to escape, while others decided to take out their secret treasure to welcome the arrival of Chao Shou.

The entire Nanzhou was in a state of panic.

In Xihuang. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chao Shou sneered.

“I will definitely make Nanzhou feel fear. I will also tell them that this is all because of Xiao Sheng!” he said coldly.

Chao Cang nodded in agreement. “Xiao Sheng has been arrogant in Nanzhou for so long. It’s time for him to pay the price! I’m afraid his name will be ruined this time.”

Chao Shou sneered several times, took out the pearl, and said indifferently, “All right. Now it’s time to find Qin Yu.”

“I’ll go with you.” Chao Cang quickly added.

“No need. You stay. I can manage.” Chao Shou said indifferently.

Finishing, he didn’t waste any time and quickly left the sect.

At the moment, Qin Yu was looking for the next city.

However, Xihuang was too big. If he were to search aimlessly, it would take him forever.

“I can’t even see a person’s shadow in such a big area.” Qin Yu sighed.

Then, he suddenly saw a group of people walking in the desert.

His eyes lit up. He rushed over and stopped the group of people.

Seeing Qin Yu’s sudden appearance, everyone became a little nervous.

They quickly took out their weapons and looked at Qin Yu vigilantly as if they were ready to attack at any moment.

Qin Yu glanced around and found that the strength of this group of people was extremely weak, and they were only at the Nascent Soul Realm.

“It seems the strength gap In Xihuang is even greater,” he thought.

In such an environment, all the cultivation resources were probably occupied by a minimal number of people.

At this moment, a man who looked like a leader walked out.

His body was strong, but only his body was huge. His strength was not.

“Sir. Why did you suddenly stop us?” the brawny man said with some vigilance.

“Please don’t misunderstand me. I just want to ask for directions,” Qin Yu said, cupping his hands.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

“Where do you want to go?” the leader asked with a frown.

“I heard there are three cities in Xihuang, but Xihuang is too big. I can’t find them. Please show me the way,” Qin Yu replied.

“Which city are you going to?” the leader asked after some thought.

“I heard a city in Xihuang specializes in cultivating dark energy.” Qin Yu laughed. “I wonder which one it is.”

“Ancient Tomb City?” the leader murmured, then laughed. “We’re also heading there. Why don’t you come with us?”

“That’s for the best, of course,” answered Qin Yu quickly.

“All right, but we’re going a little slow. I hope you don’t mind, Sir,” the leader said with a smile.

Just as Qin Yu was about to speak, he suddenly felt a powerful internal qi approaching at a breakneck speed!
