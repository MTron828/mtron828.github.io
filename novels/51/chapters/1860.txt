1861 A Primordial Spirit Strike?

Qin Yu didn’t say a word and just looked at Tong Haoyang coldly.

Tong Haoyang clasped his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I’ve seen the glory of the chaotic body. But that glory isn’t on you. It’s on Si Shiyue.”

At the mention of Si Shiyue, Qin Yu’s anger rose again.

Tong Haoyang’s words had touched Qin Yu’s sore spot, and his anger had reached its peak.

Tong Haoyang looked at Qin Yu and said, “I have a secret technique that can peer into the future. Unfortunately, you and I have fought dozens of times in our consciousness. The chances of you winning are extremely low. Thus I have the advantage.”

“You’re talking nonsense,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Seeing this, Tong Haoyang did not say anything further. He stared at Qin Yu, and the internal qi on his body was rising rapidly.

Facing a chaotic body, Tong Haoyang naturally didn’t dare to be negligent. He raised his internal qi to the extreme and stepped lightly on the ground. Rays of light gathered under his feet.

Qin Yu didn’t talk nonsense. He raised his hand and threw the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch. Following that, terrifying Golden Light shot toward Tong Haoyang!

Tong Haoyang knew how terrifying the chaotic body was. Thus he did not dare to take it head-on. Instead, he retreated quickly and countered with a secret technique in an attempt to defeat Qin Yu.

However, all the secret techniques seemed weak in front of Qin Yu’s powerful physical body. Tong Haoyang was slapped aside by his palm.

The battle began in an instant. Relying on his powerful physical body, each of Qin Yu’s punches could be said to be destructive, and it shattered the entire space continuously.

Looking at Qin Yu, who was on the verge of going crazy, Tong Haoyang’s face turned grave. He kept forming seals with his palms and released a terrifying divine brilliance to stop Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t use any fancy techniques. The golden lights intertwined, and his internal qi kept surging.

He raised his large palm and enveloped the entire space with a crushing force, leaving Tong Haoyang with nowhere to hide!

Tong Haoyang’s pupils suddenly constricted. He suddenly raised his palm and immediately emitted a light underneath his feet.

He raised his hands to receive Qin Yu’s terrifying attack.

At the moment of contact, the terrifying internal qi that Qin Yu had released began to disappear, and everything in the surroundings calmed down.

However, Tong Haoyang was not as relaxed as he had imagined. He panted slightly, and his expression became even more solemn.

It was the Tong family’s secret technique called the Hand of Divinization. Rumor had it that it could easily dissolve any technique in the world. It was created by one of the Tong family’s ancestors and was extremely powerful!

Without a doubt, Tong Haoyang had used the same method yesterday to resolve Qin Yu’s punch, including Cao Huang’s attack.

The surrounding people were all amazed by this mysterious technique, but Qin Yu didn’t care at all. He was incomparably powerful and only cared about killing. It seemed that nothing could stop him!

Tong Haoyang was forced back repeatedly. Even though he had the Hand of Divinization, he was still in a sorry state and seemed unable to take it.

Looking at the incomparably powerful Qin Yu, Tong Haoyang knew that he could not continue like this. Otherwise, it would no longer be a matter of victory or defeat but life and death!

Tong Haoyang opened his mouth slightly and spat out the essence qi. In an instant, the void trembled and emitted the divine might. His body turned into a huge stone tablet which was simple and mysterious as if it wanted to shatter the Galaxy.

A terrifying internal qi continued to emanate from the stone tablet. It was like a mysterious rain that kept hitting on Qin Yu’s body.

It was an extremely mysterious technique, and the internal qi emitted by the stone tablet was even more powerful. Qin Yu was covered in blood though he was merely hit a few times. Even his terrifying physical body could not withstand it.

Everyone held their breath, their expressions were solemn, but they were not overly surprised.

As the top disciple of the Tong family, everyone knew that his strength was not limited to this. Otherwise, he would not have dared to come to Thunder Courtyard alone.

The dense, mysterious light forced Qin Yu back continuously. At this moment, the stone tablet also showed its power. It fell from the sky like a meteorite, trying to suppress Qin Yu completely! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qin Yu’s body was stained with blood, but he did not seem to be afraid at all. With a thought, he summoned the Venerable Fifth Mountain to receive the stone tablet.

“Boom!”

The terrifying collision shook the entire space, exposing a large area of the void. It was as if the two were going to destroy the void.

The Venerable Fifth Mountain grew even larger in the air, but it could not stop the suppression of the stone tablet and kept falling.

Qin Yu did not panic. He raised his finger and struck out a ray of light. In an instant, it merged with the Venerable Fifth Mountain and covered it with rays of Golden Light.

The Venerable Fifth Mountains immediately began to suppress the stone tablet, blocking it outside.

Qin Yu’s expression was ice cold. He immediately used the line word formula and charged toward Tong Haoyang!

Tong Haoyang’s expression changed slightly. He knew Qin Yu’s speed very well, so it was impossible for him to dodge.

Tong Haoyang opened his mouth and spat out essence qi again. The essence qi transformed into a big hand in black and slapped toward Qin Yu!

This huge hand was terrifyingly powerful as if it was going to crush the sky. The Martial Arts Hall seemed to be unable to withstand it, and it had caused the sky to collapse and the earth to crack!

Nevertheless, Qin Yu did not have any intention to dodge. With a roar, his body seemed to have turned into a sharp blade as he charged straight at the big hand!

Tong Haoyang couldn’t help but sneer. He knew how terrifying this secret technique was. Wherever the hand passed, no matter what physique you had, you would be smacked into meat paste!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s body received the big hand, and blood splashed out in an instant!

Just as Tong Haoyang had expected, half of Qin Yu’s body was smashed into pieces. Even his skull had a crack, and half of his primordial spirit was exposed!

Seeing this scene, everyone’s faces changed drastically! Such an injury was indeed extremely serious!

A step further would shatter Qin Yu’s primordial spirit.

“D*mn it!”

Chang Mang couldn’t take it anymore. A blood-red light erupted from his body as he planned to kill Tong Haoyang!

But the peak master hurriedly stopped him and shook his head, “Qin Yu has her own plans.”

“Plan my a*s. I don’t want to gamble with my brother’s life!” Chang Mang pushed the peak master away roughly and walked toward Tong Haoyang with casual steps!

However, at this moment, the primordial spirit in Qin Yu’s mind suddenly emitted an extremely bright radiance!

The light emitted from his exposed skull turned into a small golden dagger. It charged towards Tong Haoyang at an extremely fast speed!

Tong Haoyang was stunned. He didn’t even have time to think and didn’t know what it was!

...

“Pfft!”

The golden dagger pierced through in-between Tong Haoyang’s eyebrows and entered his brain. It then shot out at an extremely fast speed!

Tong Haoyang was stunned. In the next second, he felt an incomparable headache. It was as if his brain was about to explode and everything in front of him became blurry!

The golden dagger returned to Qin Yu’s mind and his primordial spirit.
