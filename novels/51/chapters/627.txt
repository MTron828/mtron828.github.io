Chapter 628: One Sword Slash! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The sword light seemed to come from the sky. From the outside, it seemed to light up the entire sky.

The strong sense of oppression made people fearful!

And the two remaining brothers were also frightened!

That strong sense of danger made them extremely frightened!

The two knew that the black-robed man in front of them wasn’t simple. They immediately used their trump cards and prepared to defend against the attack!

“Swoosh!”

The first strike of the Nine Taiqing Slashes arrived in front of the two of them in an instant!

“Ah!!”

They shouted loudly, and the light in their hands turned into a solid barrier!

“Hiss!”

However, the strengthened bronze sword was too powerful!

Coupled with this Divine Rank spell, it was invincible and easily cut open the barrier formed by their inner strength!

The sword light passed through the two of them and landed a heavy blow.

“Boom!”

The entire bar was split into two halves!

The sword light passed through the two of them and broke through all their defenses!

Two deep sword scars landed on their bodies.

Their surroundings turned into ruins.

Guan Shui and Guan Hai collapsed on the ground and their eyes were filled with fear.

Their bodies were almost shattered, and huge bloody wounds were bleeding profusely!

“How... how is this possible?!”

They didn’t want to believe this scene!

It wasn’t easy for them to become the focus of the world, but they were about to face death in the blink of an eye!

Qin Yu dragged the long sword and walked toward the two of them step by step.

The surroundings were filled with broken walls and no one could be seen.

Qin Yu looked down at the two of them and said coldly, “There are some things that no one can touch. Otherwise... only death awaits.”

“Who... Who are you?!” Guan Hai shouted with all his strength.

Qin Yu looked at the two of them coldly. A moment later, he took off his black robe and revealed his real face.

“Qin Yu.” Qin Yu spat out two words.

Upon hearing this name, the two of them narrowed their eyes and spat out a mouthful of blood!

“You... you are Qin Yu...”

This made them even more desperate!

If the person who attacked was an old Martial Marquis, they would still be able to accept it.

But a member of the younger generation easily took their lives. How could they tolerate this?!

“Qin Yu, you...”

They opened their mouths, as if they wanted to say something, but Qin Yu didn’t give them a chance. He swung his sword.

“Buzz!”

The sword sliced through the necks of the two people and took their lives.

After drinking the blood, the bronze sword seemed to have become excited. It trembled endlessly in Qin Yu’s hand.

Looking at the two corpses in front of him, Qin Yu didn’t do anything.

He wanted to use this to warn the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Qin Yu put on his black robe, turned around, and disappeared into the night.

...

The next day.

The entire martial arts world exploded!

“The three super powerhouses created by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were actually killed!”

“It’s said that the murderer was a person wearing a black robe and holding a long sword! He only used one slash to kill Guan Shan!”

“When did such a powerhouse appear in Jingdu?”

“It must have been some reclusive powerhouse who didn’t like them, so he killed them in secret!”

“It could also have been revenge from the aristocratic families.”

Countless comments surged up, but no one thought that the person who attacked would be a young man.

After all, these three people had consecutively challenged more than ten young masters in Jingdu. Other than from Yan Jinyao and Kong Yun, they hadn’t suffered a single defeat!

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

The three corpses were placed in front of Qu Xie.

Qu Xie’s expression was extremely cold, and his face was filled with anger.

“Who did this?!” Qu Xie slapped the table and stood up. The table was instantly smashed into powder.

“President Qu, the person who attacked must be extraordinary. Judging from Guan Shan’s wounds, the murderer only used one sword strike to kill Guan Shan,” said the assistant at the side.

Qu Xie gritted his teeth and said coldly, “He killed Guan Shan with one slash. Who on earth has the ability to do that?”

“It must be a hidden powerhouse or a powerhouse hired by an aristocratic family.”

Everyone was discussing animatedly. Only Xia Hang remained silent.

At this moment, Xia Hang was filled with shock!

He knew that Qin Yu’s strength wasn’t ordinary, but he didn’t expect that he could kill Guan Shan with only one slash!

Not only that, but he had even fought against three so-called super powerhouses by himself!

“No matter what, you have to find this person for me!” Qu Xie gnashed his teeth and said.

“President Qu, we will do our best to investigate.”

At this moment, Yan Sihai walked in with Yan Jinyao.

As soon as they entered, they saw a few corpses on the ground.

Yan Jinyao frowned. Obviously, he didn’t know.

“Who did this?” Yan Jinyao asked.

Qu Xie said in a deep voice, “A man in a black robe with a long sword in his hand.”

“You mean... they died at the hands of the same person?” Yan Jinyao didn’t look pleased.

“Not only that, but the murderer only used one slash,” said the assistant next to him.

This shocked Yan Jinyao greatly!

He had fought with these three people before, and it had taken him a lot of effort to win!

This was enough to show that the black-robed man’s strength was far above his!

But soon, Yan Jinyao thought it through.

“The one who attacked must be a top-notch old Martial Marquis,” said Yan Jinyao.

Qu Xie nodded and said, “We think so too. No young man can do this.”

“Even Young Master Yan can’t do it, right?” The assistant asked.

Hearing this, Yan Sihai immediately cursed, “Bullsh*t! My son can kill them with just a raise of his hand!”

“I don’t think so,” the assistant snorted.

Yan Sihai was about to say something when Yan Jinyao shook his head and said, “I really can’t do it. If I fight these three people at the same time, I’m afraid I’ll die.”

“So, I can be sure that the one who attacked must be a veteran top-notch Martial Marquis.”

Hearing this, Xia Hang couldn’t help but feel greatly shocked!

Yan Jinyao was the number one person in the younger generation!

In this case, Qin Yu’s strength was probably far above Yan Jinyao’s!

“How terrifying!” Xia Hang was extremely terrified!

At this moment, he began to regret going against Qin Yu!

“I can either tell the Jingdu Martial Arts Association about this and have them send out their strongest forces to kill Qin Yu, or... I can never make an enemy out of Qin Yu!” Xia Hang roared to himself!

He struggled for a long time, but in the end, he let out a long breath.

“Forget it, I’d better not get involved in this mess.” Xia Hang finally shook his head. After all, his daughter’s life was in Qin Yu’s hands.

“President Qu, I just received news that someone suspects that the black-robed man is Qin Yu.”

At this moment, a person walked in with a document.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
