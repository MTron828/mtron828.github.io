Shen Yun’s expression instantly turned awkward.

He immediately remembered the disparity in their status and a drop of sweat rolled down his forehead.

”Miss Yan, sorry, I was just too impatient....” Shen Yun wiped the sweat on his forehead and awkwardly said, “I hope you won’t take offense. Shen Tian is in the hospital and I was too anxious...”

When she saw Shen Yun’s expression, Yan Ruoxue didn’t seem bothered by it.

She smiled and said, “Uncle Shen, what is it that you came to see me about?”

Shen Yun felt frustrated.

He had intended to hold her accountable, but in this situation, how could he hold her accountable?

”You can rest assured,” Yan Ruoxue spoke up first.

”I won’t interfere in what happens between you and Qin Yu,” Yan Ruoxue said indifferently.

When he heard this, Shen Yun’s eyes immediately lit up.

He said with excitement, “Miss Yan, you...Are you serious?”

”Of course I am,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

”I will neither help him nor help you, so you can settle things between yourselves,” Yan Ruoxue said.

Shen Yun was immediately over the moon!

He didn’t need anyone’s help at all to deal with Qin Yu.

If Yan Ruoxue doesn’t intervene, it would be extremely beneficial for Shen Yun!

”Alright, Miss Yan, I’ll excuse myself then.” After Shen Yun bowed, he quickly left the Yan Family Manor.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was at home searching through the memories of the inheritance in his mind.

This inheritance had contemporary mystical arts in addition to medical arts and cultivation methods, but Qin Yu had never used them.

Qin Yu thought to himself.

If he entered the Foundation Building Stage, or even the more advanced Monastic Period, curing a disease would be a piece of cake.

Afterward, Qin Yu spent the day refining ten Soul Nourishment Pills.

Later in the evening, Qin Yu called Lei Hu to his home.

”Here are ten Soul Nourishment Pills,” Qin Yu handed the Soul Nourishment Pills to Lei Hu.

”Mr. Qin, are there only ten pills this time?” Lei Hu asked tentatively.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “One pill costs $200,000 and you can have as many as you want. In addition to money, of course, you can also use herbs in exchange for them if they are more than twenty years old.”

”All right, no problem,” Lei Hu hurriedly nodded and said.

A short time after Lei Hu left, a surprise guest came to Qin Yu’s house.

This person was the white-haired young man from the day before.

The white-haired youth had scars on his face and even had a cane.

”What are you doing here?” Qin Yu asked after glancing at him.

The white-haired young man replied, “Mr. Shen sent me here. He will be hosting a banquet at Riverfish House this evening.”

”Oh really?” Qin Yu raised an eyebrow.

He pondered about it for a moment and said, “Alright, I will attend the banquet on time.”

The white-haired young man nodded his head but had no intention of leaving.

”What? Do you still need something?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

The white-haired youth stewed for a moment and then asked, “I want to ask you a question. Last night, at Mr. Shen’s banquet, I saw you breathing in and out, and today, I specifically re-watched the video. It seems very extraordinary.”

This was a surprise to Qin Yu.

”You could tell what was going on?” Qin Yu was puzzled.

The white-haired young man said in a hushed voice, “I once saw someone who had a form of exhalation that supposedly repaired the five internal organs, from the inside out, and I feel that it resembles your method.”

Qin Yu was all the more amazed and it seemed that he was by no means the only person in this world who cultivated.

”I’m simply curious and don’t mean anything else.” When the white-haired young man saw that Qin Yu did not say anything, he nodded and left.

Qin Yu stared at his back as he left, and secretly thought,

...

When evening approached, Qin Yu headed for Riverfish House.

Despite everything, Qin Yu had broken Shen Tian’s arm, so he had prepared a Marrow Pill as compensation and an apology.

Of course, Qin Yu was doing it more for the sake of Yan Ruoxue. After all, he wasn’t well informed about the conflicts between these families, not to mention whether the Yan family was afraid of the Shen family or not.

In no time, Qin Yu had arrived at Riverfish House.

Riverfish House was situated on the riverside and while its location was remote, it had a beautiful environment.

Today, the place was booked by Shen Yun.

Four bodyguards were standing at the entrance of the hotel and each of them seemed strong.

Qin Yu had just walked to the door when he was stopped by a few bodyguards.

”Who are you?” one of the bodyguards asked.

”Qin Yu,” Qin Yu said without subservience.

The bodyguard nodded and made way to let him pass.

”Go in. Mr. Shen is waiting for you,” the bodyguard said with a cold expression.

Qin Yu didn’t hesitate and immediately walked in with large strides. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

In the lobby of the hotel, there were more than ten bodyguards.

A man in a white suit was sitting at the front seat while feasting.

Qin Yu looked at him before walking forward and politely said, “Greetings, Mr. Shen.”

Shen Yun looked up at Qin Yu with fury in his eyes.

”You’re Qin Yu? You have some nerve to dare to lay a hand on my son and break his arm!” Shen Yun said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu explained, “It was Shen Tian who forced me to do so, otherwise I would have...”

”I don’t care what the reason is!” Shen Yun cut Qin Yu off.

He shook a stick in his hand and said in a cold voice, “I won’t spare anyone who dares to harm my son!”

As soon as the words left his mouth, Shen Yun picked the stick up and ruthlessly struck the white-haired youth’s knee!

With a crisp sound, the white-haired young man’s kneecap was instantly broken causing him to fall to the ground!

Shen Yun spat on the white-haired youth’s face and coldly said, “Useless trash. I asked you to protect my son, but you let him break his arm, so what use do I have for you?”

The white-haired young man was in agony but he didn’t say a word.

”Break his limbs and throw him out,” Shen Yun said in a cold voice.

”Yes!” The bodyguards by Shen Yun’s side immediately made their way toward the white-haired young man.

”Wait!” Anger surfaced on Qin Yu’s face.

”Your son was beaten by me, so what’s it got to do with him?” Qin Yu said in a cold voice.

Shen Yun let out a light snort and said, “He didn’t protect my son, so he failed to do his job! If he failed to do his job, he should be punished!”

Qin Yu laughed coldly as he glanced at Shen Yun and said, “He failed to do his job by not protecting Shen Tian. Then if you failed to raise your son properly, would that be considered a failure to do your job properly?”

”How dare you say that!” Shen Yun immediately rose to his feet!

”Who are you to lecture me?” Shen Yun berated.

Qin Yu eyed Shen Yun coldly and said, “No wonder Shen Tian is so cocky and bossy. With a father like you, it’s not that surprising. Today, I’ll let you know that by breaking your son’s arm, I was going easy on him. If he messes with me again, I’ll kill him!”
