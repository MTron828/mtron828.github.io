Qin Yu hesitated for a moment. When they were about to leave his line of sight, he decided to follow them.

After walking for a distance, Qin Yu finally determined that they did not come back to plot against him.

Qin Yu was a little stunned. He seemed to owe these two people a life.

After following them for nearly four hours, someone seemed to have pruned the vast shrubs and wild vines on the ground.

It became very neat and formed a slightly smoother path.

“Grandpa! There’s a wounded boar beast here. We can have roasted pork today!”

The little boy laughed heartily. There was a massive wound on the wild boar’s face in front of them.

At this moment, this wild boar seemed to be not completely dead yet. Its massive belly was still heaving up and down.

“Our luck is pretty good. Another demon race seemed to be hunting just now.

From this wound, it was likely those Night Demon Crows. Hong Yu, wait for Grandpa. Let’s see any danger nearby before we go forward.”

The old man was a little cautious. He climbed up a tree and looked around.

After confirming that the Night Demon Crow was not around, he slid down and climbed up the mountain with the little boy.

“Hong Yu, Grandpa will teach you how to skin a wild boar today. There are techniques involved in this. Only after cutting it can you make the most out of the skin.”

The old man chuckled. He held a dagger made of bone in his hand and was about to cut open the boar’s skin from the head.

A hand suddenly grabbed his wrist, and the old man’s body tensed up.

When he turned around and saw Qin Yu, his nervous expression relaxed.

Qin Yu shook his head and pulled the old man and child to the side.

The two looked puzzled, not knowing what Qin Yu wanted to do.

After a while, the wild boar’s belly suddenly swelled up as if holding up an umbrella.

After that, a sharp beak pierced through the wild boar’s skin. A Night Demon Crow covered in blood flapped several times and left the spot.

“So dangerous! I didn’t expect this Night Demon Crow to eat the flesh inside the wild boar. If we were to act rashly, it would surely howl. At that time, the two of us would die here.”

The old man had a look of lingering fear as he pulled the little boy over.

“Hong Yu, bow with me to thank the lord.”

The two bowed deeply and lowered their heads. It was a perfectly traditional Daoist gesture of gratitude.

“Old man, you don’t have to be so courteous. You saved my life just now, and I didn’t have any getsure to thank you.”

Seeing the two of them so courteous, Qin Yu hurriedly pulled them up.

“We must express our gratitude properly for saving our lives. You must come to the village with me, and I will host you properly.” The old man said with a determined expression.

“Alright!”

Qin Yu had completely confirmed that these two people had no hostility toward him.

It was a good opportunity to see this expert who could awaken the Confused Consciousness, although it was a little risky.

However, Qin Yu felt that an expert who could educate and even enlighten people would not pose a threat to him.

As the old man led the way, the road ahead slowly became wider.

In the depths of the primitive forest, a small village sat quietly. The village was surrounded by dense trees, and the tall ancient trees cast mottled shadows under the sun. A clear stream flowed past the village and brought peace and vitality.

The village houses were simple in construction, mainly built with wood and bamboo, incorporating natural elements. Winding pathways paved with stones weaved through every corner of the village.

There was a massive blaze inside, seemingly the communal dining area for the villagers.

Most living beings were afraid of the power of fire. The bigger the fire, the more it could disperse these demonic beasts.

“The place where the fire lit is where we villagers eat together every day. Everyone chats there and listens to the village chief tell stories! Grandpa, there’s a guest today. I’m going to sleep late tonight!”

Hong Yu grabbed his grandfather’s hand and jumped up high, spinning around like a swing.

“Alright! Aright!”

The old man laughed as he stroked his white beard.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu frowned. As they went deeper, they did not see anyone. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

On the contrary, he could faintly smell blood. His body became slightly tense, and he was wary of the old man beside him.

However, the old man’s expression was also grim as he stared at the depths and walked past Qin Yu, slowly moving ahead.

As they approached the bonfire, they could faintly hear strange laughter.

When they walked in, they saw three demonic cultivators who were half the size bigger than Qin Yu talking loudly.

“Demonic Flame, Faint Radiance, do you see that? It’s just as I expected. Although we can’t use the technique here, we can still use the methods of the bodies of demonic cultivators. The Saint Power contained in these meats is shocking. After eating more than thirty humans and animals, the strength of our monster bodies has almost doubled!”

A monster race whose body was covered in blood and scabs laughed out loud. He was gnawing on the flesh of a head, bit by bit.

“It’s all thanks to Lord Dark Heart’s decisiveness. At first, I was afraid that we couldn’t defeat them. I didn’t expect these living beings not to resist. Now, our strength is surely stronger than other living beings who entered this Saint

Kingdom.”

Demonic Flame’s face revealed a ferocious expression.

“Quickly boil this blood and temper this monster’s body. After that, continue to search for similar villages. If I’m not wrong, these living beings seem to have been restricted by some rules.”

Dark Heart looked at one of the spots, and a look of fear appeared on his face.

“Who is it? Get out here!”

“You guys! Grandpa, didn’t we save them? Why did they kill Aunt Magu, Sister Qin, and Brother Gu?”

“The little boy burst into loud sobs, clinging to the old man’s thighs and crying loudly.

“There are two more blood offerings here. Cut off their heads and boil the blood in the pot.”

Dark Heart’s eyes lit up when he saw the two of them. Every living being here represented a portion of Saint power.

“Boss, another outsider has delivered himself to our doorstep!”

At this moment, Demonic Flame noticed Qin Yu at the back. He was like a hungry wolf that had its eyes on a rabbit.

The two of them completely blocked the way, not giving Qin Yu any time to react.

They charged forward, and the enormous brute force clashed with Qin Yu’s fist, causing them to tremble.

Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s two fists charged in full power and bombarded the sides of these two people’s arms.

As the two demonic cultivators missed their targets, their bodies crashed into

Qin Yu’s.

“What terrifying power!”

A trace of blood flowed out from the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth.

Although he had killed many living beings, so had these two demonic cultivators.

Moreover, Qin Yu could feel the blood scabs covering their fists. It seemed to be a kind of body-tempering technique of the demonic cultivator..
