Hearing Fang Fang’s words, Qin Yu felt very uncomfortable.

If he had attacked just now, young master Mo would not have had the chance to snatch it, and Fang Fang and the others would not have been injured.

However, Qin Yu was even more clear in her heart that the root cause was still the existence of people like Young Master Mo. .

They were used to bullying the lower class and treated human lives like grass. They were the initiators.

“Fang Fang, don’t worry. I will definitely seek justice for you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Fang Fang naturally didn’t take Qin Yu’s words to heart. In his opinion, Qin Yu was just a newbie. He was just scared silly by the diamond ants just now.

“How are your injuries?”Qin Yu looked at Fang Fang and asked.

Fang Fang waved his hand. He took out the golden sore medicine and sprinkled it on his own wound.

“It’s fine now. Such a small injury isn’t worth mentioning,”Fang Fang said.

Qin Yu asked in a deep voice, “What’s Young Master Mo’s background?”

Fang Fang laughed bitterly and said, “The Mo family’s person is called Mo Rong. It’s said that his talent is outstanding. At the age of nineteen, he has already stepped into the nascent soul stage. At the age of twenty-four, he is already an almighty cultivator.”

“It’s said that in the South Province, he can be ranked in the top ten among the younger generation,”the person beside him also said.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer in his heart. So what if he was ranked in the top ten? Ling Yun, who was ranked first, wasn’t even worth mentioning, let alone this Bullsh * t young master Mo. ?

After that, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Then let’s go. I’ll lead the way this time.”

“You’ll lead the way?”Fang Fang couldn’t help but laugh. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Alright, Don’t blame yourself. This has nothing to do with you. This kind of thing often happens.”

Qin Yu did not say anything. He closed his eyes slightly and planned to deduce the Heaven’s secrets. Unfortunately, Qin Yu did not have any spiritual power at the moment, so he could not deduce the heaven’s secrets to find the treasure.

Helpless, Qin Yu could only open the desolate God’s eye and scan the surrounding demonic beasts.

As they walked, they looked at their surroundings.

Fangya and the rest were even more nervous because of their injuries.

It was noon, and there was only half a day left before night fell.

The only thing worth celebrating was that the nights in the holy region were very short, and the days were longer, so they had more time.

After walking for a long time, Qin Yu suddenly noticed a group of people gathered not far away.

They stood there, seemingly discussing something.

“It’s him again.”Fang Fang saw this person, but couldn’t help but frown.

That person was none other than young master Mo from before.

Fangya pulled Qin Yu and said, “Let’s go. Let’s go somewhere else.”

However, Qin Yu stopped in her tracks.

There was no other reason. It was because Qin Yu saw a huge demonic beast deep in the green rock forest through the desolate divine eyes.

And this demonic beast was the flying spider that Qin Yu had been searching for!

“Flying spider... It really doesn’t take much effort to come here.”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice.

Fangya kept tugging at Qin Yu and said, “Let’s leave quickly. It will be troublesome if he sees us later.”

Before he finished his sentence, Mo Rong had already noticed Qin Yu and the rest.

A strange smile appeared on his face as he walked towards Qin Yu and the rest.

“It’s you guys again,”Mo Rong said with a faint smile.

Fang Fang grabbed Qin Yu’s arm in a panic and smiled apologetically, “Young Master Mo, we’re leaving, we’re leaving...”

However, Mo Rong stretched out his hand to block Fang Fang’s path. He smiled faintly and said, “Why? Are you guys interested in this flying spider?”

“That’s right, we’re indeed very interested,”Qin Yu answered before Fang Fang could.

Mo Rong glanced at Qin Yu, and then said in a strange tone, “You’re not very capable, but you’re quite ambitious. Is this flying Spider Something You Can Covet?”

Fang ya frowned slightly, as if he had thought of something.

Flying Spider? Qin Yu seemed to have mentioned this name just now.

Thinking of this, Fang ya looked at Mo Rong and said, “Young Master Mo, can you give us a ride?”

When these words were said, not only was Mo Rong stunned, Qin Yu also subconsciously looked at Fang Fang.

“Fang Fang, you...”Qin Yu frowned, extremely shocked.

As for Mo Rong, he laughed loudly and said, “You guys really dare to covet this flying Spider, hahahaha! I’m dying of Laughter!”

“Do you guys know what this flying spider is? That’s a demonic beast at the Almighty Realm! Not only that, this flying spider is even rarer!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this point, Mo Rong narrowed his eyes and said, “The most important thing is that there is life Qi in his body. Do you know the concept? How many people outside are seeking life qi now?”

Fang ya cupped his hands and said, “Young Master Mo, please take US along. We will definitely remember your great kindness...”

The smile on Mo Rong’s face became more and more cheerful. He sized up Qin Yu and the others and said, “Do you really want to go?”

“Yes!”Fang Fang hurriedly said.

Mo Rong put away the folding fan in his hand and sneered, “You guys are so capable, why do you need us to bring you? If you want to go, then just go. What does it have to do with me?”

“You’re right,”Qin Yu agreed and then sneered, “Then let’s rely on our own abilities.”
