Chapter 1052: Chapter 1,052, a massacre 

Qin Yu’s eyes shone with a dazzling light!

Everyone was shocked wherever he went!

“You are Qin Yu?”Chi Hou Looked Qin Yu up and down and sneered.

Qin Yu ignored Chi Hou. He looked at Jiang he and cupped his hands, “Senior Jiang he, I came back late.”

Jiang he shook his head slightly and said in a low voice, “No one expected the second mystic realm to take the initiative to attack.”

Qin Yu grunted and then said, “Now is not the time to talk about this. You Go and rest first. Leave this place to me.”

“Be careful. This Chi Hou is a bit strange. His body is almost immortal,”Jiang he warned.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “In front of absolute strength, all the strange and tricky spells are not worth mentioning.”

“Hahahaha!”

Chi Hou could not help but burst into laughter.

“Qin Yu, open your dog eyes wide and take a good look at how many people I have here!”Chi Hou said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at Chi Hou coldly and said, “Just a bunch of mobs.”

“Mobs? They are all at the Martial Marquis Realm!”Chi Hou laughed coldly.

“Martial marquis? We have one too.”Qin Yu whistled. Not far away, immortal crane and the others walked over with big strides!

Three Hundred Martial Marquis Demonic Beasts and several martial saints!

Chi Hou and the others could not be compared to such strength!

“Who are these people?”Jiang he was a little surprised when he felt the powerful strength from their bodies.

Qin Yu said, “They are the helpers I invited.”

“So many humans. It really makes people angry.”A demonic beast said coldly.

Uncle Niu strode over and berated, “Come, let’s have a good fight!”

Chi Hou’s expression did not look too good.

He could feel that these people were extraordinary.

However, as one of the top martial saints in the second mystic realm, Chi Hou still maintained his composure.

He sneered and said, “It’s only a few hundred people. It’s not worth mentioning.”

Qin Yu did not pay attention to his words. He looked around coldly.

Looking at the Heaven Gate disciple who was lying on the ground, Qin Yu was furious.

In the next second, his body suddenly shot into the air, and golden light flashed on his body!

He put his hands together and murmured in a low voice, as if he was casting some powerful spell.

Streams of peaceful energy spread over, as if a Golden Buddha was alive!

“Eh?”Chi Hou frowned slightly.

Before he could react, Qin Yu’s palm had already gently slapped forward.

In an instant, thousands of palms appeared from high up in the sky!

The densely packed palms suddenly slapped down!

“Divine Buddha Thousand Hands!”Chi Hou finally recognized this technique!

That massive golden palm slapped towards everyone, and in a short moment, several people were blasted into a bloody mist!

Over half of the nearly thousand martial marquis were instantly killed or injured!

Such a technique caused even immortal crane and the others to be slightly stunned!

What a fierce spell!

It was supposed to be a peaceful spell, but it turned into a great killing weapon in Qin Yu’s hands!

“I didn’t Expect Qin Yu’s method to be so fierce.”Su Yi covered his mouth in astonishment. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yeah, I thought he was a particularly gentle young man. I didn’t expect him to be so terrifying when he fights.”Uncle Niu nodded and said.

“Let’s do it. I Can’t hold it anymore!”Wu Haicheng shouted loudly.

In the next second, he charged into the battlefield and started to fight!

The others didn’t move at all, as if they were waiting for something.

“Kill them all! Don’t spare any of them!”Qin Yu said coldly.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the immortal crane nodded slightly. With a slight wave of his hand, the demonic beasts received the order and charged into the battlefield!

The great battle instantly erupted, and killing intent filled the entire second mystic realm!

“Leave this kid to me!”Uncle Niu shouted loudly and walked towards Chi Hou.

At this time, immortal crane stopped him and shook his head, “Leave it to Qin Yu.”

“Yes, Lord Immortal Crane.”Although Uncle Niu was unwilling, he still retreated to the side.

In midair, Qin Yu’s gaze locked onto Chi Hou’s body.

Chi Hou wasn’t panicking. He sneered, “Qin Yu, tell me the truth. Did you betray Zhai Xing?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “I did have such intentions. It’s a pity that Zhai Xing did not agree.”

“Hahaha! I knew it!”Chi Hou laughed loudly.

“When I return, I will definitely tell this matter to the Realm Lord!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Do you think you still have a chance to return?”

“Arrogant! I killed you in less than three breaths!”Chi Hou shouted loudly and suddenly shot towards Qin Yu!

The combination of speed and strength caused the air to explode!

This seemed to be a simple test, but Qin Yu raised his fingers and threw two punches!

One punch was thrown towards Chi Hou’s fist, and the moment it touched, half of Chi Hou’s arm was directly shaken into a bloody mist!

Following that, Qin Yu quickly threw a second punch, and with a bang, it shattered Chi Hou’s chest bone!

All of this happened within a breath’s time! Chi Hou’s figure shot out explosively, and he smashed through countless mountain rocks!

“What a sharp move!”Uncle Niu, who was watching the battle from the side, could not help but feel a little stunned.

“That seems to be an intermediate stage martial saint, but he is actually so weak.”Su Yi, who was at the side, also said in a low voice.

Chi Hou crawled out from the ruins, and his physical body was rapidly recovering.

“Kid, you are indeed capable,”Chi Hou said coldly.

Qin Yu was filled with anger. He was not in the mood to waste time talking to him.

He clenched his fist and Rose. The golden light was like the falling sun and moon. With a surging internal QI, it arrived in an instant!

Chi Hou did not dare to be negligent. With a roar, he raised his hands and condensed a fluorescent light in front of him!

“Pa La Pa La!”

Dense black objects flew out from Chi Hou’s spatial artifact. This object was extremely similar to an iron plate, but it was countless times harder than an iron plate!

The black object was covered by the fluorescent light and instantly became indestructible!

However, Qin Yu’s fist was too powerful. It was as if even the Great Dao was making way for him. The killing intent that spread out was bone-chilling and almost swept through the entire battlefield!

“Crack!”

The black object was instantly pierced through. CHI Hou’s fluorescent light was even more fragile. It did not even last half a second before it exploded!

The lingering power that was spreading out rolled over and ruthlessly smashed onto Chi Hou’s chest!

His body could not withstand it and exploded!

At this moment, a martial marquis in the mystic realm seized the opportunity and stabbed towards Qin Yu’s back with a divine weapon in his hand!

This divine weapon was given by Gu Zizhen. It was extremely powerful and could split mountains and split seas!

“Be careful!”Su Yi, who was watching the battle from afar, immediately cried out in alarm.

“Clang!”

The divine weapon struck Qin Yu’s body and burst into flames!

However, Qin Yu’s body was not injured at all. On the contrary, his divine weapon was shattered into pieces by the shock!

Qin Yu turned around and looked at the Martial Marquis coldly.

The Martial Marquis felt his hair stand on end and froze on the spot.
