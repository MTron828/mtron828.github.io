Chapter 396: The Girl Next to the Giant Pit! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“What an unexpected gain,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think inside.

Yan Sihai’s ambition was much greater than he had imagined.

Unlike Old Master Yan, Yan Sihai was a martial arts expert, so he paid more attention to the power of the martial arts world.

However, once they succeeded, the Yan family would probably be indestructible. It would be even more difficult to topple Yan Sihai.

“You are the first batch of people to serve the Yan family. The Yan family will remember you all,” Yan Haoran said indifferently.

everyone said excitedly, “Of course. Thank you, Young Master Yan!”

At this moment, Yan Haoran noticed Qin Yu.

He frowned slightly and asked, “Inner Strength Past Master? Who is this person?”

“Oh, this kid came here by himself. He wants a share of the spoils,” Jing Shihong said.

“The dark energy on this battlefield has already erupted, and danger is everywhere, so we plan to use him to scout the way,” the person next to him also said.

Yan Haoran nodded. He sized up Qin Yu with a strange look in his eyes.

This made Qin Yu feel very uneasy.

Could it be that... his identity was seen through?

“Inner Strength Past Master... I remember that Qin Yu is also an Inner Strength Past Master,” Yan Haoran said.

Jing Shihong was the first to nod and said, “That’s right, Young Master Yan. Are you here for Qin Yu?”

Yan Haoran nodded slightly and said, “Qin Yu killed my grandfather and took away his body. I have to take revenge.”

Hearing that, everyone immediately said indignantly, “This is really despicable! The Yan family gave him an opportunity, yet he actually killed Old Mister Yan!”

“Young Master Yan, he’s just a mere Inner Strength Past Master, so why do you need to do it yourself? As long as you give the order, we will naturally get rid of him!”

Yan Haoran shook his head and said, “Qin Yu is different from ordinary Inner Strength Past Masters. My uncle once sent three peak Inner Strength Grandmasters to kill him, but now, he’s gone missing.”

“Peak Inner Strength Grandmaster?” Everyone’s expressions changed slightly.

“You mean... Qin Yu killed three Inner Strength Grandmasters?”

“That’s not it. No matter how strong an Inner Strength Past Master is, it’s impossible for him to defeat peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters.” Yan Haoran shook his head.

“I guess he has a backer, like the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“I see.” Everyone no longer volunteered.

After all, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s position was unshakable. No one was willing to offend them.

Yan Haoran put his hands behind his back and said, “In order to prevent any accidents from happening, after we leave the battlefield, I would like everyone to follow me to find Qin Yu.”

“Young Master Yan, please rest assured!” Jing Shihong took the lead to express his stance.

After that, the rest of the people also nodded and agreed.

Qin Yu sneered at the side. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

They wanted to join hands to kill him? It depended on whether they had the ability or not!

“Young Master Yan, why didn’t the Yan family use a Martial Marquis to get rid of Qin Yu?” At this time, someone asked in puzzlement.

“Yes, if a Martial Marquis makes a move, even if Qin Yu has great abilities, he definitely won’t be able to escape.”

Yan Haoran snickered. “The situation in Jingdu is complicated. After my grandfather died, many people became restless. For someone as insignificant as Qin Yu, it’s not worth using the trump card of the Yan family.”

“I see.” Everyone suddenly realized.

“Okay, don’t waste any more time. Hurry up and go in,” Yan Haoran pointed at the battlefield and said.

Jing Shihong immediately kicked Qin Yu’s butt.

“Hurry up and go in!” Jing Shihong said with a glare.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inside, but he still promised, “Okay, okay.”

He took the lead and walked to the entrance of the village.

According to Jing Shihong and the others, the dark energy on the battlefield had already exploded, and the density of the dark energy had increased exponentially.

Qin Yu looked up at the sky, and the ghost face in the sky had disappeared.

“Such strong dark energy is a bit strange,” Qin Yu murmured.

“What are you still standing there for?!”

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, Jing Shihong kicked Qin Yu’s butt and sent Qin Yu inside.

Qin Yu turned around and glared at Jing Shihong.

“Even if Fang Yue hadn’t let me kill you, I will kill you!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, he strode toward the battlefield.

“Stop.” At this moment, an old man suddenly called out to Qin Yu.

He pointed in another direction and said, “Go to the east.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Why?”

“If I tell you to go, then go. Don’t talk so much nonsense!” Jing Shihong kicked Qin Yu’s butt again.

Qin Yu was so angry that he gnashed his teeth. He wanted to kill Jing Shihong immediately.

“Everyone, our family specializes in internal qi. We can clearly sense the energy fluctuations within a hundred miles,” the old man said indifferently.

“According to my spiritual perception, the center of the battlefield is on the east side.”

“So Mr. Tang is an Internal Qi Master.” Jing Shihong couldn’t help but feel surprised.

Mr. Tang seemed to be deliberately trying to show off in front of Yan Haoran, so he said with a smile, “That’s right. I also know that this battlefield is extremely wide. Some top-tier treasure is probably buried underground on the east side.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inside.

Mr. Tang was talking about the place that Qin Yu had dug up previously.

“Then please ask Mr. Tang to instruct this kid,” Yan Haoran said indifferently.

Mr. Tang said with a smile, “Of course.”

After saying that, he stretched out his finger, and a trace of light rose from his fingertip.

Then, Mr. Tang flicked his finger, and this trace of light fell into the space between Qin Yu’s brows.

“I have already left a mark between your brows. No matter what you think, I will be the first to know,” Mr. Tang said indifferently.

“So, I warn you that it is best not to play tricks.”

Qin Yu didn’t show any panic.

The technique of this mark was many times inferior to the technique of the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor. It wasn’t worth mentioning at all.

Ever since he had successfully stepped on the stairway to heaven, Qin Yu’s divine sense had improved by leaps and bounds.

As long as Qin Yu was willing, he could erase this mark at any time, or even change the content of the transmission of the mark.

“Go to the east,” Mr. Tang ordered.

Qin Yu didn’t resist. He followed Mr. Tang’s request and headed to the east.

On the way, the group was ten meters away from Qin Yu because they were afraid that something bad would happen to Qin Yu.

The closer they were to the huge pit, the richer the dark energy became, and the pressure on their internal strength became stronger.

Even Qin Yu, who could cultivate with dark energy, felt a little uncomfortable.

“What a strong dark energy,” Yan Haoran said with a frown.

“Yeah,” Jing Shihong also frowned slightly.

“The internal qi in my body seems to have frozen, and it seems to be much more difficult to use my qi.”

“I have a bad feeling. Let’s hurry up.” Yan Haoran said.

The group continued to move forward and soon arrived at the place where Qin Yu had been.

The place where Qin Yu had once dug had now become a bottomless pit.

And beside this huge pit, there was actually a young girl sitting cross-legged.

When he saw this young girl, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

Because this young girl was none other than Xiao Yu!
