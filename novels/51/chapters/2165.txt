2166 The Desperate Qin Yu

The hope and determination he once had were drowned in despair. He began to doubt whether he was worthy of possessing formidable power.

Qin Yu’s once firm faith had now become dim and devoid of light. He began to question the significance of his existence.

In this desolate void, Qin Yu felt so small and helpless.

After going through so much, this was the first time Qin Yu was so desperate.

Qin Yu knew better than anyone else what entering the void meant.

When he tried it himself, the despair fully filled his heart.

“Perhaps… this is my fate. I’m trapped in this endless darkness, unable to escape forever,” Qin Yu muttered softly, his heart filled with dispiritedness and despair.

His lofty aspirations had long since disappeared, replaced by emptiness and confusion. He felt that he had lost his direction and goal, and he saw nothing but darkness ahead, both in the present and the future.

His desire and pursuit of freedom had been shattered by the cruel reality.

He began to give up, giving up the pursuit of his strength, giving up the hope of escaping the void.

Qin Yu felt he was destined to be trapped in this desolate void forever, becoming a part of the endless darkness.

“Perhaps those who were devoured by Rashomon had the same thoughts as me…” Qin Yu murmured, no more emotion in his tone.

Qin Yu closed his eyes weakly and fell into a despairing silence. He felt his existence gradually dissipating, and he no longer had the strength and courage to face this desolation.

All the hard work and persistence he had put in, all the dreams and hopes he had, had turned into bubbles at this moment, leaving behind only endless despair.

Despair became the foundation of his heart. Qin Yu felt that he had completely lost hope.

His soul was immersed in the dark ocean, unable to find a way out.

His breathing became weak and powerless. He felt that he had lost everything and there was nothing worth pursuing.

Time passed by quietly in the void. Qin Yu lay on the ground like an abandoned puppet, losing all vitality.

In this despair, Qin Yu gradually lost his soul. He felt he could no longer find the courage and hope he once had.

Despair heavily enveloped his heart, and endless darkness drowned him. He could no longer face the cruelty of reality. He could no longer face his powerlessness and insignificance.

Despair had become an insurmountable obstacle in his heart, imprisoning him in this endless void.

In this manner, after an unknown period of time, Qin Yu fell into a deep sleep.

However, at this moment, a faint light suddenly appeared in front of him.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the faint light with a blurred gaze. A trace of hope surged in his heart. Although the faint light was so weak that it could almost be ignored, it was enough to attract Qin Yu.

He stood up with difficulty, ignoring his fatigue and despair, and slowly walked toward the faint light. Every step he took was like he was bearing heavy weight, but he was unwilling to give up.

As he got closer, the light gradually grew brighter, turning into a tiny crack from which a bright light shone.

Qin Yu’s footsteps became steady. He used his last bit of strength to rush toward the crack. He stretched out his trembling fingers and gently touched the edge of the void.

However, as soon as he touched it, his vision returned to darkness, and nothing existed.

Qin Yu looked around in confusion. His surroundings were still bottomless darkness.

It turned out that the light was just a dream.

…

Meanwhile, the two elderly men had already returned to the Holy Region.

They were the elders of the Yao family.

At this moment, the two knelt before a long-robed man and recounted everything that had happened.

“That Qin Yu has already been sealed into the void. He absolutely can’t escape,” an elder said.

Another elder also sneered and said, “There are only two outcomes for entering the void. Either he disappears without a trace, or he’s devoured by the void, and is trapped perpetually with no hope of transcendence.”

The long-robed man quietly listened to the two elders, and his expression did not change at all.

This long-robed man was none other than the Holy Lord of the Yao family, Yao Qi.

Before Yao Qi could say anything, a young man walked in from outside.

He was handsome, like a young girl, but he had a trace of masculinity.

This person was none other than Yao Xi who had been defeated by Qin Yu!

Yao Xi quickly walked up to the two of them. He did not even bother to bow to the Holy Lord and said impatiently, “Qin Yu is dead? Is he really dead?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Holy Son, he has already been thrown into the void with no hope of transcendence,” the elder hurriedly replied.

Hearing this, Yao Xi could not help but laugh heartily.

“Hahaha! Hahaha! This damned Qin Yu deserves it!” Yao Xi’s eyes filled with madness!

“I will announce this news to the world and let everyone know that Qin Yu died in the hands of my Yao family. Hahaha!”

Yao Xi laughed maniacally before turning around and leaving.

Yao Qi looked at his back and could not help but frown, a hint of displeasure in his eyes.

“Holy Lord, that Qin Yu is already dead. Now, both the Yao family and the Yan family owe our Yao family a tremendous favor. Why are you frowning? Are you worried about Dean Lei?” the two elders asked in confusion.

Yao Qi shook his head. He looked in the direction Yao Xi had left and said in a low voice, “The current Yao Xi has completely lost his will to fight. I’m afraid he’s lost the chance to compete with the geniuses of the Holy Region and even the starry sky.”

Yao Xi’s performance did not deserve the competition. He even did not deserve the identity of a heaven’s favorite.

They were both opponents, but Si Shiyue’s battle intent was something Yao Xi could no longer compare with.

The two elders were silent, clearly agreeing with Yao Qi’s words.

…

Soon, the news of Qin Yu being sent into the void spread throughout the Holy Region.

This news first spread from the vicinity of the Yao family, then spread from one to ten, ten to a hundred, and soon spread throughout the entire Zhongzhou.

In just two days, almost everyone in the Holy Region knew about it.

For a moment, almost everyone on the street was discussing this matter.

“Have you heard? Qin Yu was thrown into the void outside the star field!”

“What? He was thrown into the void? Really?”

“The news has spread throughout the entire Holy Region. Rumor has it that the Yao family’s elder waited in the outer region, and even the Thunder Courtyard’s warship had fallen into the void together with him!”

“Sigh! It is unexpected that Qin Yu, the chosen one of his generation, actually ended up like this…”

“Once being thrown into the void, it is afraid that he’ll no longer have the chance to escape…”

“It serves him right! Why did he covet the Yan family’s saintess?”
