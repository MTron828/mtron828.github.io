Chapter 1346: Chapter 1,346, the Strange Swan Dance 1 

Qin Yu was stunned!

There was Wen Wenzi, who was full of swear words, and the famous Loli Swan Dance, which was simply unheard of!

“So it’s you two brats.”Swan dance looked at Wen Da and Wen Er.

“Where’s your grandfather?”

Wen da hurriedly said, “My grandfather will be back in a day or two.”

“Oh, I’ll visit your grandfather another day,”said Jue Wu. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Okay! We’ll prepare some delicious food later!”Big Wen patted his chest and said.

Jue Wu waved her hand and said impatiently, “Okay, okay. Don’t delay me from appreciating the flowers.”

Then, she sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder and started appreciating the flowers happily.

Qin Yu coughed dryly and said somewhat awkwardly, “Are you the famous Jue Wu? It’s not quite the same as I imagined.”

“Shut up!”Jue Wu berated, “If you delay me from admiring the flowers again, I’ll Tear Your Mouth Apart!”

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry for a moment.

Although Jue Wu was a top-notch expert, for some reason, Qin Yu couldn’t feel that kind of reverence in her heart.

Perhaps it was because of her unique image that Qin Yu found it difficult to associate her with an expert.

Wen Dawen, who was at the side, kept winking at Qin Yu, as if he was afraid that Qin Yu would offend Jue Wu.

Jue Wu sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder and followed Qin Yu and the others to admire the flowers.

After about two hours, Jue Wu yawned and said, “I’m tired. I should go back.”

“Aunt Jue Wu, stay at our place!”Wen Da volunteered.

“Okay.”Jue Wu didn’t refuse and directly agreed.

Therefore, Jue Wu sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder and rushed to the Wen family.

After returning to the Wen family, Jue Wu jumped off Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“You are too incompetent as a meat cushion. Hurry up and gain some weight.”Jue Wu was like a little adult.

Qin Yu rolled her eyes and said, “It’s already good enough to let you sit. You have a lot of problems.”

Hearing this, Master Wen and Master Wen’s faces turned green.

They kept winking at Qin Yu, asking him to say less.

However, Qin Yu ignored Wen Da and Wen Er. He squatted down, stared at jue Wu and said, “Hey, I’ve carried you for so long. Do you have any benefits?”

“Benefits? It’s your honor to be able to give me a meat cushion, but you still dare to ask for benefits?”Jue Wu glared and said.

Qin Yu snorted lightly and said, “Whoever wants to sit on your meat cushion, you can find another one.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

“You Dare!”

At this moment, Jue Wu suddenly stretched out her small hand, and a huge suction force instantly pulled Qin Yu back.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath. This force was too powerful, and he had no ability to resist at all!

“Kid, do you believe that I won’t break your legs?”Jue Wu bared her fangs and brandished her claws as she said.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “I, Qin Yuning, will not give in even if I die. Come On!”

“Okay, then don’t blame me for being impolite!”Jue Wu raised her small hand and slapped Qin Yu’s calf.

“Aunt Jue Wu, don’t!”Wen Da and Wen er instantly became anxious. On the other hand, Qin Yu clenched her teeth and didn’t say a word even though she was a little nervous.

That small hand stopped half a centimeter in front of Qin Yu’s calf.

“Little meat cushion, are you really not afraid of Death?”Jue Wu stared at her and said in surprise.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “Who hasn’t died since ancient times? I’m Not Afraid!”

“You little meat cushion, you’re quite interesting,”Jue Wu said with a smile.

Qin Yu got up from the ground and said, “You Little Loli are also quite interesting.”

“Who’s a Little Loli? At my age, it’s not too much for you to call me Grandma!”Jue Wu said angrily with her hands on her waist.

Qin Yu waved her hand and said, “I don’t want to talk nonsense with you. I’m going back to sleep.”

“I won’t Let You Go!”Jue Wu reached out her palm again and directly sealed the space in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu pretended to be angry and said, “What on earth do you want to do!”

“To be my meat cushion, do you understand?”Jue Wu waved her small hand and said.

“Beautiful! You Go find someone else, you go find someone with meat,”Qin Yu snorted.

Jue Wu scratched her hair and said impatiently, “Okay, okay, what do you want, say it.”

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up and said with a smile, “Really?”

“Hurry up, say it before I change my mind!”Jue Wu scolded.

Qin Yu grinned and said, “I want life qi. I want a large amount of life qi!”

“Life qi?”Jue Wu was stunned. She frowned and said, “What do you want that thing for?”

“It’s useful. Don’t ask,”Qin Yu muttered.

Jue Wu thought for a moment and said, “Alright, I’ll help you ask later.”

“Thank you very much!”Qin Yu quickly cupped her hands and said.

Jue Wu’s body flashed and sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder again.

She patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Your shoulder is really weird. It’s so hard that it’s like a rock.”

Qin Yu rolled her eyes and said, “Then why are you still sitting?”

Jue Wu said proudly, “I have a lot of meat on my butt. I’m Not Afraid!”

Qin Yu opened her mouth and was speechless for a moment.

She didn’t know what was going on, but ever since she went with Wen Dawen, the people she met didn’t seem to be normal.

The speed at which this unique dance changed her expression was extremely fast. One second, she was extremely unhappy, and the next second, she burst into laughter. She was really temperamental.

And for some unknown reason, she insisted on sitting on Qin Yu’s shoulder.
