1826 The Tong Family in a Panic

Jiu Xiao nodded slightly. He slowly got up and planned to summon people.

But it would take up too much time. Thus Qin Yu took out the loudspeaker and handed it to Jiu Xiao.

“Use this,” Qin Yu said.

Jiu Xiao took over the loudspeaker and was a little surprised. He did not say much and immediately grabbed the loudspeaker and began to call for people.

With an order, dozens of people from Demon-slaying Peak gathered at the entrance of the cave abode.

“Someone is attacking our Demon-slaying Peak’s people. Now, everyone, listen up! Follow me and kill him!” the peak master shouted.

“Go! Let’s see who’s so daring!”

“Kill them! Let them know the power of our Demon-slaying Peak!”

“I don’t care which aristocratic family he is from. I’ll make sure he can’t go back!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qin Yu was touched seeing everyone’s reaction.

He took a deep breath and calmed himself down. Then, he cupped his hands and said, “Thank you, everyone.”

After saying this, Qin Yu led the way, and the group left Demon-slaying Peak in a grandiose manner!

On the way, Qin Yu was a little anxious.

There was no other reason other than the fact that the two of them came from the aristocratic families of Zhongzhou. No one could guarantee that they did not have any powerful secret treasures on them.

In the blink of an eye, more than two hours had passed. Qin Yu couldn’t guarantee that Jue Wu was safe during these two hours.

Along the way, Qin Yu was extremely anxious, and a trace of viciousness flashed across his face.

At this moment, even the inner demons in his heart began to stir up. A killing intent filled with evil thoughts began to grow vaguely in his heart.

“Don’t worry too much. With Jue Wu’s strength, there won’t be a problem.” Xiaobai patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and comforted him.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. He quickly circulated the Pure Heart Sutra to restore his mind.

Time passed by. After a few hours, they finally arrived at their destination.

He saw that the land was riddled with holes, and no one could be seen.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically, and the peak master’s expression was not too good either.

“Quickly search!” the peak master ordered.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. He immediately activated his desolate divine eye to search for Jue Wu.

“Jue Wu is here!” someone shouted at this time.

A group of people hurriedly rushed over. They saw that Jue Wu was covered in blood and her internal qi was a little weak.

She held the Glided Rake with one hand to support her petite body, and her mouth was stuffed with a piece of meat.

Other than that, a corpse was lying beside her with shattered magical artifacts by the side.

It was clear that during these few hours, Jue Wu had experienced a great battle.

“Jue Wu!” Seeing Jue Wu covered in blood, Qin Yu was instantly anxious.

He quickly rushed over and pulled her petite body into his arms.

Jue Wu, who was already petite, was now covered in blood. It made people’s hearts ache even more.

“I’m fine…” Jue Wu weakly waved her hand.

“D*mn it, one of them managed to escape. What a waste…”

After saying that, Jue Wu grabbed a piece of meat and stuffed it into her mouth.

This meat was torn off from the body of the Tong family’s cultivator. For Jue Wu, this was a great supplement.

The people around her were amused. Someone joked and said, “Don’t eat anymore. You’re badly injured, and you’re still eating.”

“It’s fine. It’s the physical body of a Reversion Void Stage cultivator. It’s a great tonic,” the peak master shook his head and said.

Qin Yu had completely different thoughts. He was full of self-blame and anger.

“I will definitely not let the Tong family off…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

No matter what, he had to make a trip to the Tong family!

“I’m fine. Why do you look so sour…” Jue Wu muttered weakly.

Qin Yu didn’t say much. He knew that this was the most severe injury Jue Wu had ever suffered.

“Let’s go back first,” Qin Yu forced a smile and said.

After saying that, he picked Jue Wu up.

“I’m quite honored to have so many people here…” Jue Wu looked around and grinned.

Qin Yu looked at the peak master and the others, cupped his hands, and said, “Thank you all for being willing to accompany me on this trip.”

“What are you talking about? Jue Wu isn’t just your friend, she’s also a member of our Demon-slaying Peak,” someone beside him laughed and said.

“That’s right. We’ll find them and kill them when we have the chance!”

“Yes. When the time comes, we’ll go to the Tong family and take revenge!” Cao Huang patted hard on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu was moved beyond words. He nodded slightly, cupped his hands, and said, “Thank you, everyone.”

Qin Yu then carried Jue Wu, and the group rushed back.

On the other end, the Tong family member who was lucky enough to escape was also severely injured.

When he rushed back to the Tong family, he was already on the verge of death.

He ran to Young Master Tong’s room with all his might and fell to the ground with a “plop”.

Seeing this, Young Master Tong could not help but frown. “What’s going on? Where’s Qin Yu?”

“Young… Young Master! We didn’t manage to bring him back… He has a person called Jue Wu by his side, and we are not his match…” the servant said with difficulty.

Young Master Tong’s face darkened, and he said coldly, “Alright. You can go and treat your injury.”

“Qin Yu also asked me to bring you a message…” the servant said in a trembling voice.

“Oh?” Young Master Tong raised an eyebrow.

The servant said hurriedly, “He said… That token is related to Some Forbidden Zone…”

The moment he said that, Young Master Tong’s expression instantly changed drastically!

He suddenly stood up, and his expression was terribly cold!

“What else did he say?” Young Master Tong asked coldly.

“He also said… He also said that if you dare to harass him again, he will tell the world about this…” the servant said honestly.

After hearing this, Young Master Tong’s expression turned completely cold. Deep in his eyes, there was a trace of fear and worry.

“Alright. Does anyone else know about this?” Young Master Tong asked.

“There’s also Jue Wu. At that time, only a few of us were present,” the servant said.

Young Master Tong narrowed his eyes. He suddenly reached out and crushed the servant’s head!

The servant could not figure out why Young Master Tong attacked him.

At this moment, Young Master Tong’s face was extremely ugly. He stood there silently for a moment, then quickly got up and walked toward a cave abode.

In the cave abode, Young Master Tong explained everything to the elder in front of him.

The old man sat cross-legged in meditation. After hearing Young Master Tong’s words, he was also extremely uneasy.

“How many more people know about this?” the old man asked.

“Besides Qin Yu and Jue Wu, only you and Uncle Guan know about this. I’ve killed the servant who conveyed the message,” Young Master Tong bowed and said.

The old man was silent for a moment, then said coldly, “Immediately send people to get rid of this Qin Yu and Jue Wu. We can’t let this news spread!”

“Yes!” Young Master Tong quickly bowed and turned to leave.

After that, Young Master Tong gathered his people, brought along the Saint Weapon, and left the Tong family.
