Chapter 215: Leave No One Alive! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After hearing Little Wu’s words, everyone was relieved.

They weren’t martial artists, so they couldn’t discern differences in strength. They only knew that both of them were very powerful.

Therefore, they believed in Little Wu’s words without a doubt.

At this moment, the door suddenly opened.

Then, they saw Qin Yu and Lei Hu walking towards them quickly.

The moment they saw Qin Yu, everyone’s expression changed!

“Qin... Qin Yu isn’t dead!” Someone cried out in shock!

There were even people who quickly hid behind Little Wu!

Among them, the one scared the most was none other than Xiong Yi!

He stared fixedly at Qin Yu, and his body even began to tremble!

“He... he really isn’t dead!” Xiong Yi clenched his teeth.

He hurriedly looked at Little Wu and said coldly, “Little Wu, I’m depending on you.”

Little Wu nodded and said, “Don’t worry. Jiangcheng is just a small place. What kind of masters can there be?”

With Little Wu’s assurance, Xiong Yi was slightly relieved.

Very soon, Qin Yu brought Lei Hu and Yao Qing into the pavilion.

When they saw Qin Yu, the entire place was silent. No one dared to speak.

“Mr. Qin, I’m so happy to see that you’re fine!” Xiong Yi said shamelessly.

Qin Yu sneered. “Happy? Or afraid?”

Xiong Yi’s expression changed slightly and said, “What are you saying? Of course I’m happy!”

“Xiong Yi, you’re so shameless!” Lei Hu said angrily.

Xiong Yi said indifferently, “Lei Hu, it’s you who doesn’t have abilities. How can you blame others for it?”

“This Soul Nourishment Pill can be made better in my hands! Obviously, I’m more suitable!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter when he heard that.

“Who is suitable isn’t up to you. You only have what I give you,” Qin Yu said coldly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Xiong Yi smiled embarrassedly and said, “Yes, yes, you’re right. So, Mr. Qin, why don’t we work together and make this Soul Nourishment Pill business more lucrative?”

“Work together?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“Why don’t you take a look at yourself? Are you worthy of it?” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

When he heard that, Xiong Yi’s expression also darkened.

He said with a cold expression, “Qin Yu, don’t be too arrogant. Don’t think that everyone is afraid of you!”

“Let me tell you, I will definitely take this Soul Nourishment Pill! If you’re tactful, cooperate with me. I can even give you a share of the profit!”

“Otherwise... you will suffer what Lei Hu suffered!”

“Are you courting death?!” Before Qin Yu could speak, Yao Qing flew into a rage.

Xiong Yi hurriedly took a step back. He looked at Little Wu and said, “Do it. Kill them for me!”

Little Wu nodded slightly.

He took a step forward and said with a nonchalant smile, “You’re Qin Yu? Let me give you a word of advice. It’s still not too late to leave now. Otherwise...”

“Bang!”

Before Little Wu could finish his words, Qin Yu gave him a slap.

This slap directly shattered Little Wu’s facial bones!

The person who was still alive just now had turned into a corpse in the blink of an eye!

Everyone was stunned!

They had never thought that the difference in strength between Little Wu and Qin Yu would be so great!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “This is the master you invited? A piece of trash dares to challenge me?”

Xiong Yi immediately panicked. He said while retreating, “Qin Yu, you... don’t come over...”

Qin Yu shook his neck and said coldly, “What? Now you feel fear?”

Xiong Yi clenched his teeth and said, “Mr. Qin, I’ve realized my mistake. Can you... can you spare me?”

“No.” Qin Yu didn’t even think about it.

“You must die today.”

When he heard this, Xiong Yi’s expression suddenly became a bit ferocious!

He suddenly took out a pistol from his waist and pointed it at Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu, you forced me! None of us will end up well!” Xiong Yi said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Is this what you rely on? Do you think I will be afraid?”

As he spoke, Qin Yu walked towards Xiong Yi step by step.

Xiong Yi’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. As he stepped back, he shouted, “Don’t force me!”

“Shoot.” Qin Yu didn’t stop at all.

“Shoot!”

Xiong Yi immediately roared crazily!

In the next second, the trigger was pulled, and the sound of the gunshot was deafening!

However, Xiong Yi was horrified to discover that this bullet had only left a white scar on Qin Yu’s body.

His body was wrapped in golden light, and even the bullet was unable to harm him in the slightest!

At this moment, Xiong Yi was completely flustered.

His legs went soft, and with a plop, he knelt on the ground.

“I... I know I was wrong. Please spare me. Please spare me...” When facing death, Xiong Yi cried like a child.

However, Qin Yu didn’t have the slightest bit of pity in his heart.

Keeping Xiong Yi alive would definitely be a disaster.

“Before I kill you, I’ll ask you a question,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xiong Yi hurriedly raised his head and said, “Please speak. Please speak.”

“Where did you get the batch of herbs from the warehouse in the western suburbs?” Qin Yu asked.

Xiong Yi got an idea and said tentatively, “If I tell you, can you spare my life?”

“No.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“You’re not qualified to negotiate with me.”

Xiong Yi gritted his teeth and said, “Then I will never tell you!”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

His hand lit up. Just as he was about to make a move, Lei Hu suddenly shouted, “Mr. Qin, hand him over to me. I promise to ask him for you!”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Okay.”

Lei Hu glared at Xiong Yi and said through gritted teeth, “Xiong Yi, your good days are over!”

After saying that, Lei Hu made a phone call and called his old subordinates over.

A few people rushed over and stuffed Xiong Yi into the car.

When they got into the car, Xiong Yi was already so scared that he couldn’t stand up.

After Xiong Yi was taken away, Qin Yu looked at the merchants at the scene.

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin, we... we know we were wrong...” these people said with trembling voices.

“Yes, please spare us. If it weren’t for us, no one would work for you...”

“You can’t do everything yourself, right?”

When he heard this, Qin Yu sneered.

“You... really think highly of yourselves.” Qin Yu sighed.

“I wanted to spare your lives, but since you said so, let’s kill them all.”

When he heard this, everyone was stunned.

Qin Yu... actually wanted to kill them all?

“Mr. Qin, you...”

“Phew!”

Before they could say anything, a wisp of spiritual fire landed on their bodies.

The intense pain caused them to wail!

The blue spiritual fire could almost devour everything. In just a few minutes, they were all burned into ashes.

When the wind blew, nothing was left, as if nothing had happened.

Qin Yu stood there, but he didn’t waver at all.

It was unknown whether it was because of the increase in his strength or because he had absorbed dark energy, but Qin Yu had become more cold-hearted.
