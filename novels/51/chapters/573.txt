Xia Hang led Qin Yu and walked deeper into the corridor.

This corridor was very long. Xia Hang’s legs left a trail of blood on the road.

Very soon, the two of them arrived at a large door.

This door had to be opened using a secret technique. As the vice president, Xia Hang naturally had the authority.

He stood at the door, raised his palm, and slowly placed it on the door.

Then, his palm flashed with a ray of light, and in a moment, the door slowly opened.

Qin Yu raised his hand and grabbed Xia Hang’s palm while saying coldly, “How did you open this door? Tell me.”

Xia Hang said coldly, “Qin Yu, you better not have any ideas about this door.”

“Even if you take my palm, it’s useless. As long as I die, the secret technique in my hand will immediately disappear.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Xia Hang actually saw through his intentions.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He kicked Xia Hang, and Xia Hang instantly walked into the prison.

As soon as he walked into the prison, Qin Yu felt waves of intense internal qi surging!

At a glance, in this prison, there were Inner Strength Grandmasters, half-step Martial Marquises, and there was no lack of Martial Marquises!

“See that? Even if someone is a Martial Marquis, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is able to capture him,” Xia Hang said with a threatening tone.

Qin Yu immediately slapped Xia Hang’s mouth.

The sound instantly spread throughout the entire prison!

Xia Hang’s mouth was dripping with blood, and he couldn’t even speak.

“You talk too much nonsense,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xia Hang was extremely angry, but there was nothing he could do.

“Well done!” In the prison, there were waves of excited shouts!

“Xia Hang, I didn’t expect you to have such a day! Haha!”

“Kill him just like that!”

Xia Hang was extremely angry!

Then, Xia Hang flipped his palm and a token appeared in his palm!

Xia Hang picked up the token and the light in his palm rolled. In an instant, the prison shone with an extremely majestic light!

“Ah!!!”

Then, waves of wails came from the entire prison!

Everyone knelt on the ground and couldn’t get up. There was no lack of Martial Marquis among them!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

This Jingdu Martial Arts Association was indeed powerful. Just a token was enough to torture even Martial Marquises.

As for how deep its foundation was, it was hard to imagine!

Xia Hang snorted coldly. He brought Qin Yu along and continued to move forward.

Along the way, countless people were cursing at Xia Hang, but Xia Hang no longer had the mood to care about them.

In the bottom of Xia Hang’s heart, there was a hint of worry.

This prison was an important place for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but now, an outsider had barged in.

If the higher-ups knew about it, Xia Hang would definitely be severely punished!

“See that door in front?” At this time, Xia Hang pointed at a pitch-black door not far away and said.

“If you have something to say, say it,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xia Hang grinned and said, “What’s locked up in there is an existence that surpasses Martial Marquises.”

“An existence that surpasses Martial Marquises?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Could it be that behind that door, there was a Martial Saint?

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association could even lock up a Martial Saint?!

“Stop lying. Do you think I would believe it?” Very quickly, Qin Yu denied his own thoughts.

“Ignorant.” Xia Hang snorted coldly.

Qin Yu was somewhat anxious. He looked at Xia Hang coldly and said, “How much longer will it take?”

“Don’t be anxious. Yan Ruoxue is the eldest daughter of the Yan family. Naturally, we have to arrange a different prison for her,” Xia Hang said with a fake smile.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but his anger grew.

He couldn’t imagine what Yan Ruoxue, who was born in an aristocratic family, suffered and what kind of torture she endured.

Just thinking about it made it difficult for Qin Yu to bear.

“We’re here.”

Finally, the two of them stopped in front of a prison.

This prison was covered by iron gates. At a glance, one couldn’t see what was inside.

“Qin Yu, didn’t you want to see Yan Ruoxue? Hehe... I hope you won’t regret it,” Xia Hang said cruelly.

“Cut the crap!” Qin Yu said angrily.

Xia Hang didn’t say anything more. He raised his palm and placed it on the gate.

The gate slowly opened.

A huge iron cage appeared in front of Qin Yu’s eyes!

Yan Ruoxue was locked in this iron cage!

Everything was the same as what was shown in the video. Yan Ruoxue’s body was tied up by a chain-like pipe!

Her body was suspended in mid-air. Her face was pale and her lips had no color at all.

Her delicate body was trembling slightly. Anyone who saw it would find it hard to bear.

“Ruoxue!” Qin Yu immediately shouted!

Yan Ruoxue opened her eyes slightly.

The moment she saw Qin Yu, her eyes lit up and a smile appeared on her face.

“Qin Yu, you... Why are you here...” Yan Ruoxue said weakly.

“Ruoxue, I... You...” Qin Yu opened his mouth and felt extreme anguish.

Tears immediately flowed out of his eyes. It was unknown whether it was because of anger or anguish, but Qin Yu’s entire body trembled! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Don’t cry... a man shouldn’t shed tears...” Yan Ruoxue said weakly.

This sentence made Qin Yu lose it.

His tears were flowing out continuously.

Yan Ruoxue subconsciously wanted to pat Qin Yu’s head, but when she raised her hand, she realized that her arm had already been tied up.

“Ruoxue, I... I’ll save you right now!” Qin Yu said in a panic.

His hand was surrounded by light, and all of his energy was adjusted to the maximum at this moment!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu suddenly threw a punch at the iron cage!

“Clang!”

The deafening sound almost broke one’s eardrums, but the iron cage didn’t budge at all...

“How could this be...” Qin Yu became more and more flustered.

He turned around and roared, “Xia Hang, open the door quickly!”

However, Xia Hang’s figure was slowly disappearing.

“Qin Yu, enjoy your intimate time with her. You can’t save her. You can’t save anyone...” Xia Hang’s gloomy voice came from all directions.

Qin Yu reached out to grab Xia Hang, but found that his figure was like an illusion and was slowly disappearing.

“Xia Hang, f * ck you!” Qin Yu roared angrily. The veins on his neck bulged, and his eyes were filled with rage!

However, Xia Hang had already disappeared just like that.

“Ruoxue, I... I’ll save you right now!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth. Golden light flashed on his body, and Divine Dragon Power exploded at this moment.

“Ruoxue, don’t worry. I... I’ll definitely save you!”

Qin Yu roared angrily. He used all the strength in his body to smash the iron cage once again!
