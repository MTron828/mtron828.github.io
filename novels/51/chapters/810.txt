“Ju... he actually broke free!”Shen Yichun’s expression was somewhat unsightly!

This face-smacking came too quickly!

And Zheng Ke, who was close to Qin Yu, was directly shocked until he vomited blood!

Qin Yu looked coldly at Shen Yichun and said, “I don’t have time to deal with you now. Get lost immediately!”

Shen Yichun said with a cold face, “Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue is very important to us. I will never give up!”

“Then go to hell!”Qin Yu was furious and threw a punch!

Shen Yichun’s face changed drastically. This punch was too fast. He had no chance to dodge. He could only brace himself and raise his fist to receive it!

“Clang!”

Qin Yu’s peerless power exploded at this moment!

Shen Yichun’s fist was shattered instantly!

Qin Yu seemed to have gone mad and stepped forward again.

He held the absolute beginning holy fist in his hand, and his moves were simple and crude!

Shen Yichun’s hand-kneading technique was completely shattered!

Seeing that Shen Yichun was being beaten back one after another, everyone could not help but suck in a breath of cold air!

That was a half-step martial saint! ! How could he be beaten to such a state? !

“Boom!”

Very quickly, Qin Yu’s fist smashed onto Shen Yichun’s chest!

Shen Yichun was instantly beaten until he was bleeding profusely and was forced to retreat repeatedly!

“This won’t do... If this continues, I’m afraid I’ll die here!”Shen Yichun muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, he was starting to be afraid!

A half-step martial saint being afraid of a martial marquis was simply unheard of!

“Boom!”

Just as he was in deep thought, Qin Yu threw another punch at him!

Shen Yichun hurriedly dodged. When that fist smashed onto the ground, the entire ground instantly exploded!

“No, we must retreat!”Shen Yichun said in a low voice.

Then, Shen Yichun shouted, “Everyone, retreat immediately!”

After throwing out these words, Shen Yichun immediately ran away!

As a half-step martial saint, his speed naturally did not need to be said.

Qin Yu did not have the time to waste with him. The most important thing now was to take Yan Ruoxue and leave!

“Don’t even think about leaving!”

At this moment, Qin Yu saw Zheng Ke who was planning to escape.

Qin Yu’s figure flashed, and he kicked the politician’s legs to pieces!

Zheng Ke immediately cried out in pain. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, what do you want to Do? I was the one who helped you save Yan Ruoxue!”

“No matter what, without you, I really couldn’t have saved Yan Ruoxue. Considering this, I’ll spare your dog life for now,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu grabbed Zheng Ke and left with him in large strides!

The group of people sped away.

Qin Yu’s appearance looked extremely strange.

He was holding Yan Ruoxue in his arms, and there were two people in his hands.

One was the bloody Zheng Ke, and the other was a young girl with a terrified expression.

Qin Yu quickly rushed towards the house.

By the time he returned to the house, the handlebar mustache had already returned.

“Qin Yu, you... you succeeded? !”When he saw Yan Ruoxue in his arms, the handlebar mustache immediately turned pale with fright.

Qin Yu did not have the time to waste with the handlebar mustache. He threw Zheng Ke to the handlebar mustache and said, “Leave this place immediately, quickly!”

The handlebar mustache did not dare to say anything more. He hurriedly stood up and briefly tidied up before following Qin Yu and speeding away.

The first place that Qin Yu wanted to go was the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

He needed the pavilion master’s help to treat Yan Ruoxue’s injuries.

...

At this moment, Granny Qin was bringing Blackie back.

Along the way, Granny Qin’s face was filled with kindness, and her eyes were filled with love.

“Blackie, one failure is nothing. In Granny Qin’s heart, you will always be the best,”Granny Qin said with a smile.

Just as the two of them were talking about their mother-son relationship, Granny Qin’s phone rang.

She picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Xia hang.

Granny Qin frowned slightly. She picked up the phone and frowned. “What’s the matter?”

Xia hang said anxiously, “Granny Qin, it’s bad. Qin Yu... Qin Yu, he...”

“What’s wrong with him? Tell me quickly!”Granny Qin’s expression changed. She suddenly felt that something was wrong.

Xia hang said in a trembling voice, “Qin yu broke into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. I... I don’t know what he did...”

Granny Qin’s expression suddenly changed!

“Oh no, I fell into a trap!”Granny Qin slapped her thigh and suddenly understood!

Blacky said in surprise, “Granny Qin, What’s Wrong?”

Granny Qin gritted her teeth and said, “Blacky, you go back first. I have something to do.”

After saying this, Granny Qin ran away.

She rushed all the way to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Looking at the bloodstains on the ground, Granny Qin felt even more uneasy.

“What exactly happened!”Granny Qin found Xia Hang and said anxiously.

Xia hang shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. That Qin Yu knocked me out and walked towards the depths of the association.”

“I checked the surveillance cameras, but Qin Yu is too cunning. The surveillance cameras are all damaged...”

Granny Qin’s face was extremely pale!

Walking towards the depths? Could it be... the second secret realm? !

Thinking of this, Granny Qin quickly ran towards the second secret realm.

At the entrance of the second secret realm, there was a pool of blood.

This blood came from Yan Ruoxue. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“It’s over!”Granny Qin’s face was pale as if she had lost her parents!

At this moment, Granny Qin’s cell phone rang.

The call came from the higher-ups!

“A meeting.”There were still two short words on the other end of the phone.

Granny Qin wiped the sweat from her forehead. She didn’t dare to think too much and immediately walked towards the meeting room.

In the meeting room, several higher-ups were gathered here.

The atmosphere today seemed to be particularly heavy.

Granny Qin had just entered the meeting room when she felt that something was wrong.

“Yan Ruoxue has been taken away.”At this moment, a higher-up spoke.

“What? !”The thing Granny Qin was most worried about had still happened.

“Granny Qin, what did you do? Do you know what it means for Yan Ruoxue to be taken away? !”Another higher-up shouted loudly.

“He, Qin Yu, was able to break into the second mystic realm because of you!”

Granny Qin said in a trembling voice, “He... how could he open the second mystic realm...”

“There are many ways to open the mystic realm. Is this the time to talk about this?”

“If it wasn’t for you, How Could Qin Yu find the second mystic realm?”

“How should you be punished?”

Granny Qin plopped down on her knees and said in a trembling voice, “I... I will definitely bring Yan Ruoxue back!”

“No need,”a higher-up said coldly.

“We will find someone else.”

“Yan Ruoxue has been taken away, and you can’t get away with it!”

Granny Qin knelt on the ground, not daring to say a word.

At this time, a higher-up said, “According to the rules, you and your heaven-swallowing Python have to Die!”

“But since you have worked for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association for many years, we can spare your life. You can go and deal with the heaven-swallowing Python yourself. His existence will affect your decision.”
