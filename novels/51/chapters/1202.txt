Chapter 1203: Chapter 1203: Burning Blood Essence is useless! 

Such a terrifying body made everyone tremble in fear.

“Even if our blood essence is exhausted, our bodies are the real bodies of mighty figures,”a mighty figure said with a grave expression.

“If we knew this would happen, we wouldn’t have gotten involved in this mess! What’s wrong with waiting for the opening of the Holy Region?”

“That’s right. They said that they were the number one sect in the world, but in the end, they provoked this god of plagues twice!”

He Teng’s expression darkened as he said, “Plans can’t keep up with changes. No one expected that Qin Yu wouldn’t leave.”

“If that’s the case, we should kill Qin Yu instead. Otherwise, we’ll definitely repeat the same mistake. We still won’t be able to go to the Holy Region.”

These words reminded many of the major powers.

Last time, they didn’t even dare to show their faces. Now that they had offended Qin Yu once again, how could they have the chance to go to the saint-level the next time?

“I suggest that everyone burn their blood essence and kill him directly.”He Teng glanced at them and said.

“Haha, What You Say Is Easy. It doesn’t hurt to stand there and talk,”someone snorted coldly.

He Teng put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “If this continues, your internal Qi will be exhausted and you will die. You might still have a chance if you try.”

Everyone was discussing, but no one was willing to burn their blood essence first.

Moreover, the consequences of burning their blood essence would be more serious. No one was willing to bear it.

“Boom!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Just as they were discussing, Qin Yu had already walked over!

He stepped through the air and clenched his fist. In an instant, he appeared in front of everyone!

The great battle had begun once again. Now, it was already imminent and there was no room for discussion.

Those who were unable to dodge in time were heavily injured by this punch. Their bodies were on the verge of shattering.

Many almighty experts unleashed their arts one after another. Mountains and rivers shattered, and everything before their eyes turned into nothingness.

This was an unprecedented battle. Qin Yu was fighting against twenty almighty experts alone. It was simply unheard of!

After all, Qin Yu didn’t have any spirit energy, so it was very easy for him to pull away.

Therefore, the battle was in a state of anxiety. They couldn’t hurt Qin Yu, and Qin Yu could only rely on timing to catch them.

This battle was fought from day to night. Killing intent filled the sky, and the battle intent surged like a dragon.

The thick and heavy internal Qi was like a dark cloud that blotted out the sky, pressing down on people until they could not breathe.

“Ah! !”

Some mighty figures seemed to be unable to hold on any longer. Their internal Qi sank into a state of dispirit, and Qin Yu seized the opportunity to crush their heads.

The difference between these mighty figures was not big, and there was no exception. Soon, there were people who could not hold on any longer.

Once their internal Qi became dispirited, they would be unable to avoid Qin Yu’s frenzied pursuit.

The difference between their physical bodies was simply irreparable. No matter what technique they used, the final outcome would be the same.

“Rather than die a cowardly death, it’s better to fight to the death. Ah! !”

After a mighty figure roared, he was the first to burn his blood essence and forcibly restore his strength to its peak!

A true mighty figure revealed himself at this moment. Different auras surged like raging waves, infecting everyone present.

“You finally couldn’t hold it in any longer?”Qin Yu couldn’t stop laughing coldly.

“Do you think that stepping into the Almighty Realm will change the outcome? I’ll kill you just the same!”

Qin Yu took a step forward and crushed the ground. His body rose up from the ground and headed straight for the Almighty!

The Almighty, whose blood essence had been burned, was already filled with confidence.

In the face of Qin Yu’s explosive charge, he surprisingly didn’t Dodge. Instead, he planned to meet Qin Yu head-on.

He moved his palm, and a flower with a dazzling radiance condensed on his chest.

The flower was filled with an internal Qi of destruction. As he moved, the flower shot toward Qin Yu!

The strange dark purple radiance seemed to merge with the void. As it floated, the surrounding void trembled continuously.

Soon, the flower arrived in front of Qin Yu, as if it wanted to explode Qin Yu into pieces.

However, Qin Yu laughed coldly. His fists turned into palms, and his two crystal clear palms actually grabbed towards the flower that had a lot of destructive power!

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and blue veins popped up. An unimaginable power gathered in his palms!

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, the flower of a mighty figure was actually slowly crushed and exploded!

The explosion that was expected to destroy the world did not appear. Instead, it emitted a “Pu”sound in Qin Yu’s palm, and then disappeared into thin air.

Qin Yu could not stop laughing coldly. He looked at this almighty who had forcefully burned his blood essence and could not help but laugh coldly. “You condensed for half a day, and you condensed a Fart?”

That Almighty’s expression changed drastically!

This was a type of humiliation, but this kind of humiliation made him have no intention to refute. Instead, he had the intention to retreat!

“Is this the technique of a mighty figure like you? I think it’s just so-so.”Qin Yu laughed coldly. He immediately seized the opportunity when he was in a daze and took a step in front of this almighty!

By the time he turned around and took a step back, it was already too late.

“You... Let Go of me!”The mighty figure said in terror.

“Let Go of You? Do you think that’s possible?”Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

When this mighty figure saw that the situation wasn’t looking good, he gritted his teeth and directly cut off both of his arms, shooting backward explosively!

Looking at the two arms in his hands, Qin Yu raised his head and laughed loudly, dripping with sweat!

“Is this a mighty figure? Cutting off his own arms just to survive?”Qin Yu laughed wildly. His laughter was extremely ear-piercing, causing everyone’s heart to be shrouded in a shadow.

“Even if he burns his blood essence, he’s still not his match...”someone said in a low voice.

“Now that things have come to this, we can only fight it out with him.”

A mighty figure stretched out his hand, and a magic artifact that was like an incense burner appeared in his hand.

The moment the magic tool was taken out, a divine power that could shake one’s heart and soul spread out.

This was an extremely ancient magic tool that contained an unknown and terrifying power.
