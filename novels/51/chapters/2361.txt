2362 Divine Sense Restriction

At the last moment, Qin Yu seemed to have heard a furious roar.

Cold sweat dripped down Qin Yu’s forehead. He had just made a choice but was unsure if it was right.

In that sea of the Path of Heaven, if he were to leave a soul mark behind, he could activate the power of spatial rules within a specific range.

At the same time, he could also use spatial power to temper his body. This was the sign of a fourth-grade True Saint advancing to the fifth grade.

This mark would allow one to summon the power of heaven and earth with a thought.

Just like Teng Zixu, he did not have the Glazed Holy Body but could release the power of half-step heavenly might by making a move. The reason was that he could easily borrow the power of the Path of Heaven.

However, the mark left behind would become the chain left in that world forever. That statue had already conveyed to Qin Yu that if he were to bow and submit, he would possess great power.

At the last moment, a bad feeling suddenly appeared in his heart. He did not know if it was a reminder from his father or his sixth sense. In the end, he refused to submit.

Qin Yu collected his thoughts. Although he did not fuse with the Path of Heaven, his experience in the Sea of Spatial Rules this time deepened his understanding of the principles of space.

He placed his hand around the Sumeru ring, and the spatial rules that evolved on his hand merged slowly with the rules inside the Sumeru ring. Subsequently, the Sumeru Space expanded at an imperceptible speed.

This kind of expansion was permanent. It represented Qin Yu’s current terrifying comprehension of spatial rules. If Qin Yu had enough time, he could open up an independent mystic realm space as the spatial mighty realm cultivator did previously.

However, this brief moment had consumed almost one-thousandth of Qin Yu’s chaotic power.

This terrified him. Whether it was the muscles, cells, or bones of his Glazed Holy Body, they all contained enormous spiritual energy.

In just an instant, he had consumed such a vast amount of spiritual energy.

He began to understand why advancing from the fourth to the fifth grade, merging with the rules, and triggering the rules was the correct answer.

His path definitely would not work for an ordinary cultivator who wanted to borrow the power of the Path of Heaven.

“Qin Yu, are you alright?”

Jue Wu asked worriedly.

“What can happen to me?” Seeing Jue Wu’s worried expression, Qin Yu could not help but feel warmth in his heart.

He never expected he and Jue Wu to form a life-and-death friendship like this from mere acquaintances.

“How are Chang Mang and the others?” Qin Yu asked worriedly.

“They’re still unconscious. Their souls seem to have been suppressed by the power of the coffin. There’s no fluctuation at all.”

Elder Guai also looked worried. He had tried a few methods over the past few days.

He even gave them Heavenly Deity Pills, but after the pills that restored the power of the soul entered their bodies, most of them were snatched away by the divine sense restriction.

As they were talking, they saw looks of pain appear on the faces of Xi Menn’s sister and the others.

Something seemed to have happened in their bodies. With a sweep of divine sense over them, Qin Yu discovered the divine sense restriction set up by the Holy Region trembled slightly.

“D*mn it! Under the suppression of the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes, how is the divine sense restriction activated?”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

“Probably the Holy Son of the Ji family is here. The token of divine sense restriction was created by the Ji family’s ancestors. The Ji family’s bloodline can control the divine sense restriction more effectively. If the Ji family’s Holy Son comes, this coffin may no longer be able to suppress the divine sense restriction.”

Elder Guai knew quite a bit about the methods used by the Holy Zone to control criminals, so he could roughly guess what was going on.

“How did they know our location?” Qin Yu’s expression was ugly. With his power of the soul, others could not possibly follow him. How did the people from the Holy Region discover their location?

However, he did not hesitate further. The Sumeru ring flashed and disappeared.

After sailing in the Sea of Space, Qin Yu’s Way of Space had become even purer.

In just a few leaps, he had traversed more than ten planes.

He then advanced at full speed. At this moment, his body speed was even faster than some magical artifacts.

As he moved forward, he swept away countless chaotic qi of heaven and earth, and they entered his body.

The Traceless Immortal Scripture circulated continuously in his body.

His Glazed Holy Body itself was a bottomless pit. It would frantically absorb all the vital energy into its body, in addition to the overbearing Traceless Immortal Scripture.

Coupled with his chaotic body, he could absorb any vital energy directly without much consideration.

The entire path he took was like a black hole, and all the spiritual energy was instantly depleted.

Soon, he arrived at the eighth level of purgatory. He was looking for someone.

Uncle Ling, the person with exceptionally high soul cultivation by the side of the evil exterminator, was the only person who could directly enter the Ghost Mansion Mystic Realm.

His soul cultivation was far above Qin Yu’s. Qin Yu probably would not be his match if it weren’t for his tremendously powerful divine sense.

On the highest mountain peak of the eighth level, the evil exterminator was sitting cross-legged in retreat.

Meanwhile, Uncle Ling and Ling Yurou were guarding around him.

“Uncle Ling.”

Qin Yu’s body moved, and he had already arrived before the two of them.

“Your cultivation has become much stronger!”

Ling Yurou said in surprise.

She did not even catch Qin Yu’s speed just now.

“What’s the matter?”

Uncle Ling asked with a frown.

“Do you have a way to undo the divine sense restriction of the Holy Region? You specialize in the Way of Soul. I’d like to know if you have any solutions.”

Qin Yu handed over a bottle of Heavenly Deity Pills.

Uncle Ling did not take it and shook his head.

“It’s a method used by the Holy Region to control criminals. No one has ever resisted it for three or four Path of Heaven years in the past. What makes you think that I can solve it?”

“Is there a way?”

Qin Yu was a little lost. Was the person Xi Menn risked his life to save going to die in front of him?

“Forget it. That divine sense restriction was created by a wisp of the will of the Ji family’s One-life Immortal Emperor. Unless you have the will close to the Immortal Emperor, you won’t have any chance to remove the divine sense restriction.”

Uncle Ling shook his head.

“Right now, you should be relying on the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes to suppress the divine sense restriction. However, if someone with the ancestral bloodline of the Ji family appears, the coffin won’t be able to suppress that will.”

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly. He did not expect the Holy Region to go on such a big scale.

For the sake of these criminals, they even refined the Immortal Emperor’s will into a divine sense restriction.

“You may go. I can’t help you. This is the path of cultivation, and parting ways is common. ”

Uncle Ling sighed.

At this moment, everyone in the Sumeru ring let out painful moans again.

“They can find out our location!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. With a move of his body, he disappeared.

“What a terrifying spatial technique. However, it doesn’t seem to have fused with the Path of Heaven. How can he use the spatial spell so frequently?”

Ling Yurou asked with curiosity as she watched Qin Yu leave.
