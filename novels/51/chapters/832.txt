Chapter 833: Occupying the Mystic Realm

He had slapped the extraordinary Song Shan to death with a raise of his hand. This move had shocked everyone present.

Qin Yu’s words made Ning Kun’s expression darken.

Although he wanted to flare up, he recalled what the black-robed man had said and ultimately endured it.

“Qin Yu, I know that Song Shan and Ancestor Guan have offended you, but there’s no need for you to kill people,” said Ning Kun.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “The two of them are just small fry. I don’t care about them at all.”

“You should know clearly what Hong Yi Sect has done. Don’t play dumb.”

Ning Kun played dumb and said, “Qin Yu, what do you mean? Why don’t I understand?”

“You don’t need to understand. You only need to know that I will kill all of you today.” Qin Yu’s body emitted a strong murderous aura.

Ning Kun hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Qin Yu, I’m afraid that there’s some misunderstanding between us. Don’t be rash!”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. The only response he received was a palm strike!

A loud bang immediately erupted in the hall! Dust rose up and crushed stones flew everywhere!

Ning Kun hurriedly retreated to the side. He glared at Qin Yu and shouted, “Qin Yu, don’t go too far! Don’t think that I’m really afraid of tou!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Go too far? Have you ever thought of this when you schemed against me?”

Ning Kun gritted his teeth and immediately shouted, “Let’s attack together and kill Qin Yu!”

In an instant, everyone stepped out!

In the entire Mystic Realm, a total of eight Martial Marquises jumped out!

These Martial Marquises had extraordinary strength, and their coordination was seamless!

“Qin Yu, you’re right. Hong Yi Sect has never treated you as a partner! Our goal is to get Yan Ruoxue!” Ning Kun simply gave up on keeping up a pretense and sneered.

Ancestor Guan even shouted, “When you used my name to cause trouble everywhere, did you ever think whether I would agree or not?!”

Qin Yu ridiculed, “Use your name? You really think highly of yourself.”

“No need to say more. Let’s attack together and kill him!” Ning Kun said coldly.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s figure suddenly floated into the air.

He glanced at everyone present and grinned. “Eight more Golden Cores...”

“Arrogant!” These words infuriated everyone!

The group of people immediately controlled their spells and rushed towards Qin Yu!

Meanwhile, Qin Yu, who was in mid-air, put his palms together and muttered.

Seeing this scene, Ning Kun couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “What, now you know fear? It’s useless to beg Buddha. Why don’t you come and beg me instead?!”

Just as Ning Kun was laughing out loud, Qin Yu’s body suddenly emitted rays of peaceful golden light!

At a glance, he looked like an eminent monk!

“Huh? What kind of spell is this?” Ning Kun frowned slightly.

This peaceful aura didn’t have the slightest deterrent force. Instead, it made people feel a surge of excitement.

It was precisely because of this reason that they had overlooked the lethality of this spell!

“Buzz!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu raised his palm and lightly slapped it forward.

“God Buddha’s thousand hands!”

Accompanied by Qin Yu’s low moan, thousands of golden palms slapped over!

That palm carried a peaceful aura, but under this peaceful aura, there was an incomparably powerful killing intent!

“Oh no!” Ancestor Guan was the first to feel that something was wrong. He hurriedly pulled out his longsword and abruptly slashed towards the palm that was slapping towards him!

However, this palm directly pierced through Ancestor Guan’s longsword and slammed heavily onto Ancestor Guan’s chest!

Ancestor Guan’s chest instantly sank down, and the shape of a palm appeared on his chest!

“Pu!”

Ancestor Guan suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, he took a few steps back, and his chest actually exploded!

It wasn’t just Ancestor Guan. None of the Martial Marquises present could resist it!

This God Buddha’s thousand hands was an area-of-effect attack, and the densely packed palms made it impossible to dodge!

In just half a minute, these eight Martial Marquises’chests were all smashed into pieces, and they fell to the ground, unable to get up!

Qin Yu looked at his own palm and said in a low voice, “As expected of a Buddhist technique. Its power is so terrifying.”

Ning Kun, who wasn’t far away, was already panicking.

He originally thought that everyone could resist for a period of time, but unexpectedly, they were all killed by Qin Yu’s palm strike!

“Damn it!” Ning Kun gritted his teeth. He seized the opportunity and ran away!

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to chase after them. Instead, he walked in front of the bodies of the eight Martial Marquises and dug out the Golden Cores in their bodies.

Su Qian, who was standing at the side, looked pale. She covered her mouth gently, her face full of shock.

Qin Yu glanced at Su Qian and said, “Are you afraid?”

Su Qian opened her mouth but couldn’t say anything for a moment.

Qin Yu said coldly, “You’d better not get involved with this kind of organization. Understand?”

Su Qian nodded in a daze. How could she dare to say anything at this time?

On the other side.

Ning Kun was desperately rushing towards the black-robed man’s room.

“Sir, sir! We can’t hold on anymore!” Ning Kun ran frantically as he ran.

He violently rushed through the door of the room and shouted, “Sir, Qin Yu, he...”

But before he could finish, he was stunned.

In this room, where was the figure of the black-robed man?

Looking at the empty room, Ning Kun immediately turned pale, as if he had realized something!

“When you led people to fight desperately, your superior took advantage of this time to sneak away. How ridiculous.”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s voice came from behind.

Ning Kun was so scared that he sat down on the ground.

He gritted his teeth and immediately knelt in front of Qin Yu. He pleaded desperately, “Qin Yu! I know that you have great ambitions and are determined to get rid of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“Right now, you are in the midst of hiring people. I, Ning Kun, may not say that I have great abilities, but I have been in the Hong Yi Sect for many years and have powerful connections!”

“As long as you spare me, I, Ning Kun, am willing to be your slave and will do anything for you!”

Looking at Ning Kun, who was crazily expressing his loyalty, Qin Yu sneered and said, “Do you know what your greatest significance is to me?”

Ning Kun suddenly raised his head and said, “What?”

Qin Yu pointed at the location of Ning Kun’s dantian and grinned. “It’s the Golden Core in your body.”

Before he finished his sentence, Qin Yu clenched his fingers, and his golden fist was already approaching Ning Kun’s head.

Ning Kun only felt the golden color in front of him continuously magnify, and in the next second, he lost consciousness.

After killing Ning Kun, this Mystic Realm would officially belong to him.

“Finally, I’ve obtained a Mystic Realm.” Qin Yu let out a long sigh of relief.

Although this Mystic Realm didn’t have many resources, it was an excellent place to hide and break through in.
