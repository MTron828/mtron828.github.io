“Dragon Transformation Valley.”Qin Yu silently recited these three words.

Pavilion master explained, “I once called Myself Divine Phoenix, and he called himself Dragon Transformation.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and muttered, “So there is such a history...”

“Alright, follow me.”Pavilion master took a step forward and walked into Dragon Transformation Valley.

As soon as he stepped into the Dragon Transformation Valley, a ray of light shot towards him!

Pavilion master waved his hand lightly, and the ray of light dissipated into thin air.

“Are you going to welcome your old friend like this?”Pavilion master said indifferently.

“Ji Yuhong, what are you doing here!”A cold voice came from the valley.

Pavilion master said indifferently, “I’m here to catch up with you.”

“Catch up with you? What is there to catch up with you? Get lost!”The voice in the valley was somewhat angry.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but secretly feel that things weren’t looking good.

From the looks of it, it wouldn’t be so easy to get his help.

“Who is this kid by your side? Your Child?”At this moment, a voice came from the inside again.

“I am the pavilion master’s Disciple.”Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

“Disciple? HMPH, looking at your behavior, you don’t seem like an alchemist.”The person inside said coldly.

Pavilion master smiled and said, “Xiang Danqing, my disciple’s alchemy level is probably above yours.”

“Nonsense!”Xiang Danqing instantly flew into a rage!

Pavilion master said indifferently, “I came here today to tell you that not only can I beat you, but my disciple can also beat you today.”

“But I know that you have always been a person who can not afford to lose, and you only know how to show off with your words. Forget it, let’s go.”

After saying that, the pavilion master looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, let’s go.”

Qin Yu, on the other hand, had an anxious look on his face. It was not easy for him to come here. Why did he want to leave after just coming here?

The Pavilion Master gave Qin Yu a look, indicating that Qin Yu should not be anxious.

Therefore, Qin Yu could only follow behind the pavilion master, planning to leave.

At this moment, a ray of light burst out from the valley!

They saw a tall, bare-chested, naked man, who looked like a savage, blocking their way.

He stared coldly at Ji Yuhong and said, “You only won by a fluke in the past, but now you have brought a junior to humiliate me! Ji Yuhong, don’t you think you have gone too far!”

Pavilion master raised his eyebrows and said, “When have I humiliated you? I’m just stating a fact.”

“Back then, you ran to this uninhabited place to hide because you lost to me. Don’t you think you can’t afford to lose?”

When Xiang Danqing heard this, his eyes immediately looked at Qin Yu. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

His tall figure looked extremely oppressive.

“Kid, do you think you can beat me?”Xiang Danqing said coldly.

Qin Yu touched his nose and said, “It’s hard to say. I’m not sure if you can’t beat me.”

“Are all the juniors nowadays so arrogant?”Xiang Danqing said coldly.

“Even if you’re arrogant, you have to have the confidence to be arrogant,”pavilion master said indifferently.

“If you’re not convinced, just compete with him.”

Xiang Danqing shouted, “Do you think I don’t Dare? !”

“Okay, then let’s compete.”Pavilion master immediately made the decision.

“Qin Yu, are you okay?”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “I’m fine.”

Pavilion master grunted and said, “Xiang Danqing, if my disciple wins, you will agree to one request of his. How about it?”

Xiang Danqing snorted lightly and said, “Not to mention one request, even ten requests will do!”

“Alright!”Pavilion master immediately nodded.

“If I win, Ji Yuhong, you will give the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to me, and then this Dragon Transformation Valley will be renamed the Divine Phoenix Valley! You will stay here forever! Do You Dare?”Xiang Danqing narrowed his eyes and said.

“Okay.”Pavilion master agreed without thinking.

Xiang Danqing laughed loudly and said, “Ji Yuhong! You underestimate me too much! Do you think I have been wasting my time all these years? !”

“Do you see this mountain full of herbs? These are the ingredients that I use to refine medicine!”

“After so many years, my alchemy skills are no longer on the same level! Ji Yuhong, you will definitely lose!”

Pavilion master raised his eyebrows and said, “Back then, you seemed to have said something similar. What happened in the end?”

Veins popped up on Xiang Danqing’s forehead. He glared at Qin Yu and said, “Cut the crap, Kid. Let’s give it a try!”

After saying that, he turned around and walked into the valley.

Qin Yu and pavilion master exchanged a glance and followed closely behind.

“Pavilion master, this person’s alchemy skills should be very strong, right? What If I lose to him? When that time comes, do you really want to stay here for the rest of your life?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but whisper along the way.

Pavilion Master Bai Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Then don’t lose.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Okay, I’ll do my best!”

After stepping into the Dragon Transformation Valley, a strange smell assailed his nostrils.

This valley had a different world, as if it was a primitive residence.

Everything inside was made of stone. In the center of the hall, there was a cauldron made of stone.

There were still remnants of herbs inside the cauldron, and a strange smell assailed his nostrils.

“Tell me, how do you want to compete?”Xiang Danqing said coldly.

Pavilion master said indifferently, “Let’s compete with the one we competed with back then, the one who had more clear-heart pills in the end would win.”

“Hahahahaha!”Hearing this, Xiang Danqing couldn’t help but burst into laughter!

“Ji Yuhong, after I lost to you back then, I worked hard to develop clear-heart pills. Now, the clear-heart pills are easy for me!”Xiang Danqing said with a cold smile.

“I don’t want to bully you. I’ll give you a chance to regret.”

Pavilion master also seemed to be a little worried.

She looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, what pill do you want to compete with?”

As she spoke, pavilion master kept winking at Qin Yu, as if asking him to choose a pill that he was good at.

However, Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Let’s compete with the Clear Heart Pill.”
