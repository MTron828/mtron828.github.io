1795 The Resources of Thunder Academy

Subsequent to the battle, Qin Yu completely integrated into the team of Demon-slaying Peak.

After spending some time with them, Qin Yu found that most of the cultivators in Demon-slaying Peak were easy to get along with, and the atmosphere was good too.

It didn’t take long for Jue Wu to mingle with them. As long as she had time, she would drink and have fun. She was quite happy.

Compared to Jue Wu, Qin Yu appeared to be much lonelier.

He didn’t like to go out on normal days and spent almost all his time cultivating in the cave abode.

The entrance to the cave was sealed, and only Qin Yu and Jue Wu could enter and leave freely.

In front of Qin Yu, there was dragon blood. With the help of the dragon blood, Qin Yu tried to step into the half-step Reversion Void Stage.

Even though the half-step Reversion Void Stage was not the true Reversion Void, the two words alone would make a huge difference in strength.

For example, Xiao Sheng and Xiao Hai could kill the Reversion Void Stage cultivators at the half-step Reversion Void Stage. Such a level of strength was indeed shocking.

In the blink of an eye, another ten days had passed.

At this time, God Bless Sect had led many cultivators to attack Tianyun Sect.

However, to everyone’s surprise, the sect master of God Bless Sect, Yao Yingxuan, had yet to show up.

It was a prolonged battle which casualties on both sides were not severe. They were only stalling for time.

Another few days passed.

Demon-slaying Peak finally gave him a mission, and Qin Yu’s choice was still the East Continent.

He and Jue Wu walked together and again stepped into the East Continent.

With their current strength, almost no one in the entire East Continent could stop them.

Therefore, the following few missions were quite smooth, which Qin Yu and Jue Wu each also accumulated 20 points or so.

In the cave abode.

Qin Yu played with the token in his hand and said in a low voice, “I wonder if I can exchange 20 points for a Meridian Circulation Technique that can suppress inner demons.”

Jue Wu immediately threw her token to Qin Yu and said with a smile, “I’ll give you mine. Forty something points should have no problem, right?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “You give me all your points. What about you?”

Jue Wu waved her hand and said, “I can’t be bothered with the points. You can take it. We’ll talk about it after you’re done with your business.”

Qin Yu had wanted to reject it. However, after thinking about it, he realized that it would be a good opportunity for him if he could get a Meridian Circulation Technique to suppress his inner demons.

Thus, Qin Yu took the token from Jue Wu’s hand.

The moment the tokens were connected, under the guidance of the two, all the points in Jue Wu’s token were transferred to Qin Yu’s token.

Looking at the number “44” that was flashing slightly on the token, Qin Yu felt a little more confident.

“I remember Huangji Buddha Flame is still in your hands, right?” Jue Wu suddenly said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “Huangji Buddha Flame needs a lot of time to devour, so I’ve thrown it into Spatial Magic Artifact.”

Jue Wu rolled her eyes and said, “You’re wasting natural resources.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Without hesitation, Qin Yu instantly took out Huangji Buddha Flame.

The ball of fire glowed slightly in Qin Yu’s palm. It looked mysterious and unfathomable.

“Take it if you want it,” Qin Yu said.

Jue Wu glared at Qin Yu and said, “What kind of person do you think I am? I don’t give a d*mn about it! I just want to tell you to devour it as soon as possible. Haven’t you always wanted to enter the Reversion Void Stage as soon as possible? This Huangji Buddha Flame is an opportunity for you. You’re such a fool.”

Qin yu realized it after Jue Wu’s reminder.

“That makes sense.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

The effects of the Huangji Buddha Flame were beyond imagination. If one devoured it, there was a high possibility that one would directly step into the Reversion Void Stage.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu put away Huangji Buddha Flame.

“You can retreat as and when you like. If anything happens, I’m around,” Jue Wu patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said recklessly.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “Before I do that, I need to get that Meridian Circulation Technique first. I have to suppress my inner demons.”

If he could not suppress his inner demons, it would definitely interfere with his state of mind when he was in the retreat. It might even cause severe damage to him when he was breaking through.

“I’ll head toward the main peak tomorrow,” Qin Yu said to Jue Wu.

On the following day, Qin Yu took the token and went straight to the main peak after bidding goodbye to Jue Wu.

Thunder Courtyard was huge, with each of its main peaks could be called a big city.

With the help of Divine Eagle, Qin Yu took two days before he finally arrived at the main peak.

It was Qin Yu’s second time stepping into the first main peak. The moment he stepped in, two young men suddenly appeared in front of him.

They seemed to have used some formation to break through the air directly.

The two men blocked Qin Yu’s way and asked coldly, “Who are you, and why did you come to the first main peak?”

Qin Yu quickly took out his token and expressed his intention.

They took the tokens from Qin Yu’s hands. After confirming all was in order, they said coldly, “Come with us.”

The two men then raised their hands and placed them on Qin Yu’s shoulders.

In the next second, Qin Yu had a sudden blackout and could not see anything.

When Qin Yu opened his eyes again, an extremely huge palace-like academy appeared in front of him!

A few words were written on the plaque of the academy–Thunder Academy.

The entire academy exuded an extremely sacred internal qi, making people prostrating in worship.

At a glance, the academy seemed to be emitting a faint glow.

The light enveloped the academy and made it look even more sacred.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the top of Thunder Academy. He could not help but sigh in his heart.

There must be some top-tier treasures hidden in the academy.

Then, Qin Yu looked around and was surprised to realize that the surroundings was actually a void, and he could not see anything!

Qin Yu was shocked. He frowned and said in a low voice, “May I ask the two seniors if this is a Mystic Realm?”

The two glanced at Qin Yu and said, “This is a Mystic Realm personally created by Immortal Emperor, Lei Ming. Even a True Saint can’t enter by force.”

Qin Yu was shocked upon hearing this!

If even a True Saint could not force his way in, the inheritance of Thunder Courtyard must be extremely terrifying!

“Alright. Go in,” the two men said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. He then stepped into the Thunder Academy with the intention of making a pilgrimage.

The moment he stepped in, she felt a sense of oppression. Even the spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body could not be used.

It was obvious that no one was allowed to use techniques in the Thunder Academy.

The entire academy was divided into eight levels. The first level contained all kinds of techniques and the Meridian Circulation Technique.

These were ancient books after ancient books. The ancient books were shrouded in light and could only be read by redeeming points.

Qin Yu took a casual glance and saw several Divine Rank cultivation techniques! Any one of them would be enough to shock the entire Holy Region!
