Chapter 929: Chapter 929, Xu Huaigu VS Zhai Xing! 

Zhai Xing walked forward with a pair of ice-cold eyes that were emitting a terrifying aura.

The surrounding people all took a few steps back. They knew very well that the real battle had just begun.

“Oh no!”Seeing this, Qin Yu secretly felt that things were not good.

Zhai Xing was different from an ordinary martial saint. His strength was far above Xu Huaigu’s!

If they were to really fight, Xu Huaigu would not be able to retaliate at all!

“Make your move,”Zhai Xing said coldly as he looked at Xu Huaigu.

Xu Huaigu’s expression was still extremely calm. He moved his hands and quickly formed seals.

One could see that he had slapped out a seal with a single hand. The seal carried rolling thunder as it crushed towards Zhai Xing!

Zhai Xing’s expression turned cold. He waved his large hand and suddenly clenched his fist. Then, he ruthlessly smashed it over!

“Boom!”

With this punch, the seal that Xu Huaigu had formed was shattered!

When the crowd saw this, they could not help but gasp!

Zhai Xing’s strength seemed to have exceeded everyone’s imagination!

“Do you have any other moves?”Zhai Xing asked coldly.

Xu Huaigu did not say anything. He closed his eyes slightly and muttered in a low voice, as if he was about to cast some spell.

Meanwhile, Zhai Xing was not in a hurry. He just waited quietly.

This was the confidence of a top martial saint!

“Hualala!”

Thousands of threads of light that looked like black hair flew out from Xu Huaigu’s sleeve!

These threads of light blotted out the sky and covered the earth. In the end, they actually condensed into a horsetail whisk in Xu Huaigu’s hand!

Xu Huaigu grabbed the horsetail whisk and waved it gently. He looked like an immortal!

No expression could be seen on Zhai Xing’s face. He did not seem to care about Xu Huaigu’s move at all.

This was a true top-notch battle, so no one interfered.

Xu Huaigu waved the horsetail whisk in his hand slightly, and a vast power approached Zhai Xing!

Zhai Xing’s muscles bulged. He pushed his hands forward, and a shield immediately condensed on his hands!

“Clang Clang Clang Clang!”

The force of the horsetail whisk exploded with a deafening sound when it came into contact with the shield!

However, the shield that formed seemed to be indestructible and easily blocked the force of the horsetail whisk.

A trace of surprise finally flashed across Xu Huaigu’s calm face.

“What other moves do you have? Feel free to use them.”Zhai Xing placed his hands behind his back and his expression was extremely cold.

Xu Huaigu’s expression gradually became solemn.

He grabbed the horsetail whisk with one hand, and his arm trembled slightly.

Traces of a powerful internal Qi were emitted from his horsetail whisk.

The three thousand hair-like horsetail whisk shook uncontrollably.

Rays of light gathered on the horsetail whisk.

“Shua!”

Right at this moment, Xu Huaigu’s palm shook, and the horsetail whisk shot forward!

In an instant, the horsetail whisk emitted a resplendent light.

What was shocking was that the light seemed to contain an ancient divine beast!

There was a divine dragon, a qilin, a black tortoise, and a white tiger...

At a glance, it seemed like an ancient divine beast diagram!

If one listened carefully, one could even hear traces of roars and cries!

“Eh?”

At this moment, everyone was greatly shocked!

Even Zhai Xing’s face flashed with a trace of shock!

In the face of this, even Zhai Xing had to treat this seriously.

His palms emitted a radiance that was like the stars. This pair of hands seemed to be in control of the power of the stars, becoming mysterious and unfathomable!

Facing the divine beast that was rushing towards him, Zhai Xing roared loudly and pushed his hands forward! “...”

Two forces that shook the world collided at this moment!

“Boom!”

The entire scene turned into dust! Everyone’s line of sight was blocked!

Countless people retreated at this moment. Those who could not dodge in time were directly turned into meat paste!

“What terrifying power!”

“This is a true top-notch battle between Martial Saints!”

Qin Yu’s face was also filled with shock!

One had to know that Xu Huaigu had just entered the martial saint stage, and Zhai Xing was a true top martial saint!

Under everyone’s gaze, the light slowly dispersed.

The figures of the two appeared in everyone’s sight.

They saw that Zhai Xing’s hands had been shaken until they were bleeding profusely, and his thumb had split open!

Hiss...

For a moment, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air!

Xu Huaigu... had actually injured Zhai Xing?

Was this really just the beginning of the Martial Saint Stage?

“Senior Xu is invincible!”Someone took the lead and shouted.

“Senior Xu is unparalleled in the world! He is the pride of our generation!”

“Senior Xu is invincible. So what if he is a martial saint in the Mystic Realm!”

Everyone seemed to have been ignited!

They shouted in excitement. Their faces were filled with excitement.

Only Qin Yu’s expression did not look too good.

On the surface, it seemed that Xu Huaigu had indeed taken advantage of him.

However, Xu Huaigu had clearly used all his trump cards, while Zhai Xing had dealt with it with ease.

“If this continues, senior Xu will definitely lose...”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Zhai Xing’s face also carried some admiration.

“You have just become a martial saint, yet you are able to achieve this step. It is truly surprising. If it was not for our different positions, I would not have wanted to kill you,”Zhai Xing said in a low voice.

Xu Huaigu bowed slightly and said, “Senior, you’re too kind. We each have our own missions. Life and death are up to fate. Make Your Move.”

“Zhai Xing! What are you doing! Hurry up and kill him!”Gu Xinghe could not help but shout angrily.

Zhai Xing glanced at Gu Xinghe before turning to look at Xu Huaigu.

“Alright, after you die, I’ll personally erect a monument for you!”

Before he could finish his sentence, Zhai Xing walked over!

His speed was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, he had arrived in front of Xu Huaigu!

Xu Huaigu held the horsetail whisk in his hand and tangled with Zhai Xing.

Zhai Xing relied on his two invincible palms to continuously collide with Xu Huaigu’s horsetail whisk.

They fought from the ground to mid-air, and then fell back to the ground from mid-air.

The battle between the two could be said to have changed the color of the wind and clouds, and the momentum was unparalleled!

Everyone’s hearts were raised!

But soon, Xu Huaigu fell into a disadvantageous position.

Under star-picking’s torrential attacks, Xu Huaigu was hit several times in the chest!

“Ah!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Finally, accompanied by star-picking’s furious roar, his right fist was like a dragon. Qi force erupted and ruthlessly smashed toward Xu Huaigu’s horsetail whisk!

“Boom!”

Under this enormous force, the horsetail whisk finally couldn’t withstand it and shattered with a sound!

As for Xu Huaigu himself, he was also knocked back repeatedly and spat out blood!

His white clothes had already been dyed blood red, making him look extremely tragic!

“Senior Xu!”For a moment, everyone was sweating for Xu Huaigu!

“You’re not my match.”Zhai Xing stood in the distance and looked at Xu Huaigu coldly.

Xu Huaigu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said weakly, “Senior’s strength is indeed unparalleled in the world.”

Zhai xing frowned and said, “If you give up now, you might still have a chance to live.”

Xu Huaigu smiled and shook his head, saying, “For me, the best outcome is to die in battle here.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu felt extremely uncomfortable in his heart.

He grabbed the spatial artifact and planned to throw out these two corpses at any time!

In the dark, Wan Gu Qiong was looking at the two of them with a gloomy expression.

“Uncle Zhen, Zhai Xing is too soft-hearted. No matter what, we can’t let Xu Huai Gu leave alive today,”Wan Gu Qiong said coldly.

Uncle Zhen understood and immediately nodded. “I understand.”
