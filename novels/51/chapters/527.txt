Chapter 528: Xiao Yu’s Dual Cultivation Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Upon seeing how confident the father and son were, Yan Sihai nodded.

He said indifferently, “Not only must we win, but we must also win effortlessly.”

“If necessary, we will invite Martial Marquises to make a move.”

Han Wei hurriedly waved his hand and said, “There’s no need. I’ve defeated Martial Marquises before!”

“Then let us congratulate Han Wei in advance!” Yan Sihai raised his cup, and everyone immediately stood up.

...

Time flew by.

Qin Yu had entered the realm, and the absorption of dark energy had become an instinctive action.

The dark energy in his body had almost formed a balance with bright energy. With the current internal qi in his dantian, it was enough to help him enter the Martial Marquis Realm!

“Mr. Qin, it’s time.”

On this day, Taozi patted Qin Yu’s shoulder gently.

However, Qin Yu didn’t react at all. His legs were crossed and his eyes were still closed.

“You’re too gentle. This won’t work,” Yao Qing muttered.

After saying that, he raised his foot and kicked Qin Yu’s body fiercely.

When people were in seclusion, they were at their weakest.

Therefore, this kick kicked Qin Yu to the ground.

He slowly opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was the scorching sun.

“Is it time?” Qin Yu sat up from the ground. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

His brows were tightly furrowed, and his face was full of worry.

“Mr. Qin, how is it?” Yao Qing asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “The internal qi is enough, but I can’t step into the Martial Marquis realm.”

The next day was the ninth day of September. Qin Yu had no time at all.

“Mr. Qin, how about... we forget it,” Yao Qing said.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “No matter what, I won’t watch Ruoxue marry Han Wei.”

Even thinking about it enraged Qin Yu!

At this moment, Qin Yu sensed that someone was coming from outside.

Qin Yu looked in the direction of the door, then left the back mountain.

After going to the courtyard, he saw Gu Taichu and Jiang Gu gathered there.

Mr. Wu and Xiao Yu were also here!

“Qin Yu!”

Xiao Yu was the first to run over.

She grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and whispered, “You can’t let sister Ruoxue marry that b*stard Han Wei!”

Qin Yu stroked Xiao Yu’s hair and forced a smile. “Don’t worry. Even if I have to risk my life, I won’t let Han Wei get his way.”

“Xiao Yu, go away. Don’t delay Qin Yu’s business,” Mr. Wu berated from the side.

Qin Yu looked at everyone and said, “Everyone, please come in.”

When they came to the living room, Taozi made a pot of tea for everyone.

“Mr. Qin, what is your current realm?” Jiang Gu couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Half-step Martial Marquis.”

“Half-step Martial Marquis?” A hint of surprise flashed across Jiang Gu’s face, but at the same time, there was a hint of worry.

“Mr. Qin, Han Wei seems to have just killed a Martial Marquis,” Jiang Gu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I know. I’ve been trying to become a Martial Marquis for the past few days. All the conditions to become a Martial Marquis seem to be enough, but I just feel that I’m lacking something.”

Jiang Gu couldn’t help but feel shocked.

He used to be the number one person in Chuzhou, but now, the gap between him and Qin Yu was getting bigger and bigger.

“In just a short year, you’ve already entered the Martial Marquis Realm. It’s really terrifying,” Jiang Gu couldn’t help but sigh.

However, Qin Yu remained silent.

Right now, he wasn’t in the mood to marvel over his talent. Instead, he was worrying about how to step into the realm of the Martial Marquis.

“Stepping into the realm of the Martial Marquis requires a certain amount of luck. It isn’t possible to only rely on closed-door cultivation,” Gu Taichu, who had remained silent all this while, suddenly said.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Taichu and said, “Master Gu, what do you mean by that?”

Gu Taichu was silent for a moment, then said, “Everything is ready, and all that you need is a fortuitous opportunity.”

Fortuitous opportunity?

Qin Yu was a smart man, so he quickly understood the meaning of this sentence.

“In other words... it depends on fate.” Qin Yu frowned.

Gu Taichu nodded and said, “Yes, many people sense the arrival of a breakthrough randomly.”

“Of course, nothing is absolute. There are also people who forcefully try to break through to the Martial Marquis realm, but the success rate is extremely low.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of the Pavilion Master.

She had suppressed her cultivation realm for many years, but when she wanted to break through, she quickly stepped into the Martial Marquis realm.

How did she do that?

“Qin Yu, no matter which path it is, it’s too late for you.” Gu Taichu sighed.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. “Yes, I plan to go to Jingdu today.”

“So soon?” Mr. Wu frowned.

He held Qin Yu’s hand and said, “Are you really going to Jingdu?”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I must go.”

Mr. Wu frowned and sighed. “If you are going on a suicide mission, I don’t think Miss Yan will let you do it.”

Qin Yu slowly sat up.

He looked to the north and said, “It’s not that simple for them to kill me.”

Qin Yu had been looking forward to fighting with Han Wei for a long time.

Qin Yu had long wanted to smash the loathsome face of that high and mighty Young Master.

“Qin Yu, Han Wei is different from your other opponents. He might be the strongest opponent you will encounter,” Gu Taichu said slowly.

Qin Yu smiled. “I know. After all, he is the son of an aristocratic family and is known as the genius of Jingdu.”

Qin Yu paused for a moment and continued, “But which great master didn’t rely on defeating geniuses to reach the top?”

Everyone was silent.

They wanted to advise Qin Yu, but they understood that Qin Yu had already made up his mind.

“Yao Qing, go prepare some food,” Qin Yu said to Yao Qing.

“Okay,” Yao Qing agreed and turned around to leave the room.

The atmosphere of the meal was a little tense.

Everyone’s mood was quite heavy.

After the meal, everyone planned to leave. After all, Qin Yu was about to leave for Jingdu.

At this moment, Xiao Yu suddenly pulled Qin Yu’s arm and said, “Qin Yu, come here. I want to talk to you.”

“Xiao Yu, don’t mess around!” Mr. Wu scolded.

Xiao Yu ignored Mr. Wu. She pulled Qin Yu’s arm and walked to another room.

“What’s wrong?” Seeing Xiao Yu’s impatient look, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

Xiao Yu looked around and said, “I just heard from them that you need a fortuitous opportunity to become a Martial Marquis, right?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes.”

Xiao Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I have a pure dark energy body. I know that dual cultivation can bring about magical effects. Perhaps... Perhaps this will allow you to step into the rank of a Martial Marquis.”
