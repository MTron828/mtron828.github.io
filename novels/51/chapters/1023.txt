Chapter 1024: Chapter 1,024, on the eve of the great battle

“So Fast?”

This time, even Chang Mang couldn’t help but be surprised.

Qin Yu sneered, “I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time.”

The many guests who had come to celebrate in the great hall also stopped what they were doing. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Although Qin Yu’s strength was obvious to everyone, the Jingdu martial arts association had been there for too many years. In all these years, who had truly won against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?

It was not an exaggeration to say that even the authorities had never truly made a move against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“The second mystic realm is only the beginning. Not only do I want to flatten the second mystic realm, I also want to get rid of the eight higher-ups behind it.”Qin Yu’s tone was extremely cold.

The things they had done to Yan Ruoxue were still fresh in their minds. Qin Yu would never let them off.

The news spread like wings across the entire martial arts world.

“Qin Yu is back! He killed the new martial saint, Qiao Zun, with three punches!”

“He declared war on the second Mystic Realm!”

“What? The second mystic realm? Is it the second mystic realm of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu?”

“Damn, isn’t this a little too arrogant? He has just become a martial saint, and he declared war on the second mystic realm? Does he really think that the second mystic realm is made of mud?”

Regarding this news, not only the current martial artists, but the disciples of the various Great Mystic Realms also sneered endlessly.

“This Qin Yu really thinks highly of himself.”At a certain mountain and water club in Jingdu.

“Declared war on the second mystic realm? Then doesn’t that mean that his next step is to declare war on our various Great Mystic Realms?”

“He just entered the martial saint realm, so it’s normal for him to be a little arrogant. Moreover, he just killed Qiao Zun.”

“So what if he’s Qiao Zun? He has just become a martial saint. There’s a huge difference between him and an old martial saint. I remember that he only needed one palm strike to kill a new martial saint.”

“I really don’t know how this Qin Yu will end up.”

...

Jingdu, Yan family.

Yan Jinyao looked at the news on the martial arts forum with a gloomy expression.

“I’ve actually allowed him to be one step faster...”Yan Jinyao muttered in a low voice.

This was not what made Yan Jinyao the angriest. What made him the angriest was that Qin Yu seemed to have gained the upper hand in every aspect.

Unknowingly, not only had Qin Yu become a martial saint, he had even won over the hearts of the people.

“Damn it... he was clearly being suppressed everywhere. How could he be one step ahead of me in every aspect...”Yan Jinyao clenched his fists tightly.

Indeed, those who could not be beaten to death would only make people stronger.

“It seems that I have to break through as soon as possible,”Yan Jinyao said in his heart.

...

In the second secret area.

It could be said to be a small world.

Besides the disciples of the Gu family, there were many ordinary warriors here, but there weren’t many people.

In the middle of the second secret area, in a towering hall.

A strong man walked in steadily.

“Zhai Xing, What’s the matter?”Gu Zizhen opened his eyes lazily and asked casually.

Zhai Xing said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu declared war on the second Mystic Realm.”

Hearing this, Gu Zizhen was stunned for a moment, then couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Qin Yu? Declared War on the second Mystic Realm?”Gu Zizhen couldn’t close his mouth from laughing.

“I’ve lived for so long, this is the biggest joke I’ve Heard!”

Zhai Xing was not as optimistic as Gu Zizhen.

He said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu has a chaotic body, and the bloodline of a dao protector flows in his body. It’s better for us not to underestimate him.”

“Qiao Zun, the son of the Qiao family, has already died in his hands. It’s said that Qin Yu only used three punches.”

Gu Zizhen sneered, “Zhai Xing, are you afraid? Scared by a junior, right?”

Zhai xing shook his head, “I didn’t mean that.”

“Then there’s no need to talk nonsense,”gu Zizhen said coldly.

“The higher-ups have always wanted to get rid of Qin Yu, but they couldn’t find the opportunity. If he comes to me now, I’ll just kill him.”

Zhai xing frowned and said, “I think it’s necessary to make some preparations. I’m Afraid Qin Yu came prepared this time.”

“Enough!”Gu Zizhen shouted.

“Zhai Xing, you’ve been in the martial saint realm for so many years. Don’t you know how big the gap between Martial Saints is?”

“He, Qin Yu, is only a new martial saint. So what if he’s a Peerless Genius!”

Zhai Xing was silent.

After a while, he said in a deep voice, “You’ve saved my life once. You’ve treated me well these years. I will save you when necessary.”

“You? Save Me? hahahaha!”Gu Zizhen could not help but laugh.

“I am a peak martial saint. Do I Need You to save me?”

Zhai Xing did not say anything else. He turned around and walked out of the main hall.

Gu Zizhen did not take Qin Yu seriously at all.

If it were not for the fact that this second secret realm did not have the conditions to step into the almighty realm, he would have already become a almighty long ago.

Once he stepped into the mighty figure realm, he would be an omnipotent existence that could fly in the sky and burrow through the Earth. How could he be afraid of Qin Yu.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was gathering his men and preparing to head to the first target: the Wan family Mystic Realm.

Qin Yu had long detested the actions of Wan Gu Qiong.

He had killed countless disciples of the Jade Moon Villa, laid traps for Qin Yu many times, and harassed the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Any one of these crimes would be enough to kill him a hundred times over!

Moreover... Qin Yu indeed had to show off his strength.

Although Qin Yu had stepped into the martial saint realm, no one thought that Qin Yu could go against those secret realms that had existed for many years.

This Wan Jia Secret Realm was a qualified stepping stone.

“Wan Gu Qiong, it’s time for you to die.”Qin Yu’s face was cold and his eyes revealed a cold light.
