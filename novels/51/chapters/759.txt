The purple light shot up into the sky and shattered the ceiling!

Qin Yu pulled Xiao Yu and hurriedly took a step back, afraid that he would be accidentally injured!

The light lasted for more than ten minutes before it slowly disappeared and returned to calm.

After the purple light fell, the gourd finally revealed its true appearance.

The gourd flickered with a faint purple light from top to bottom. It no longer had its previous decadent appearance. Instead, it was replaced by an indescribable demonic and holy aura.

“This is... a purple-gold calabash?!” The man with the mustache grabbed the gourd and exclaimed in shock.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “What is a purple-gold calabash?”

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu and said, “A top-notch Magic Artifact. Its power is unimaginable.”

“Magic Artifact?” Qin Yu scratched his head.

“Comparable to the Divine Dragon Blade?”

The man with the mustache said in a deep voice, “Compared to the purple-gold calabash, the Divine Dragon Blade isn’t even worth mentioning.”

After saying that, the man with the mustache held the purple-gold calabash and injected a wisp of spiritual energy into it to activate the Magic Artifact.

In an instant, the purple-gold calabash erupted with a terrifying radiance!

This radiance shook the entire room!

The radiance shot into the distance, and then slowly disappeared.

Everything returned to calm once again. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The destructive power contained within this purple-gold calabash caused people to tremble endlessly!

“What a powerful force,” Qin Yu exclaimed.

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu and said, “This isn’t its most terrifying aspect. The most terrifying aspect is that this purple-gold calabash can display different powers according to the user’s strength. There’s no upper limit.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

No upper limit? This was too terrifying!

One had to know that no matter how good a Magic Artifact was, there was a limit.

As the user’s strength increased, all the Magic Artifacts would slowly become unworthy of mention.

Magic Artifacts without a limit were extremely rare!

It was rare to see one in the entire world!

“I’ve struck it rich! I’ve struck it rich!” The man with the mustache said excitedly.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly had an idea.

He looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Try attacking me with this purple-gold calabash.”

The man with the mustache was stunned. He couldn’t believe his ears.

“What did you say?” The man with the mustache scratched his ears.

Qin Yu repeated, “Use it to attack me.”

“Are you crazy? The power of this purple-gold calabash is unimaginable. You...”

“No worries.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“I just happened to want to test the strength of my body. Feel free to do it.”

The man with the mustache was silent for a moment, then muttered, “You’re really a madman. You have to be careful.”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded.

He released his internal qi, and golden light instantly rose.

The Saintly Body Technique was unleashed to the extreme at this moment!

This was a top-tier Magic Artifact, after all. Qin Yu didn’t dare to neglect it, and the Divine Dragon Power also appeared at this moment.

After making all the preparations, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache.

“Come.” Qin Yu’s eyes revealed his determination.

“Okay.” The man with the mustache didn’t say anything more.

He activated the purple-gold calabash and aimed it at Qin Yu.

With the injection of spiritual energy, the purple-gold calabash flickered with light again.

That destructive power spread throughout the entire mansion!

“It’s coming!” The man with the mustache roared, and the purple-gold calabash in his hand immediately shot out waves of terrifying light!

“Ah!!”

Qin Yu roared angrily. He clenched his fist and punched out!

“Boom!”

This was a terrifying collision! The entire ground collapsed in an instant!

Even the residence rumbled and collapsed in an instant!

Yan Jinyao’s residence next door also wasn’t spared from the disaster and instantly turned into ruins!

“What’s going on?” Yan Jinyao’s expression changed and he hurriedly rushed into the sky.

At a glance, he could only see that the golden power and the purple radiance were colliding!

The entire surroundings were covered by dust, and he could only see two dazzling rays of light!

Yan Jinyao frowned slightly, his eyes fixed on this scene.

“What exactly is Qin Yu doing?” Yan Jinyao muttered in a low voice.

“Boom!”

Another explosion sounded!

The two lights were canceled out at this moment!

Qin Yu’s body instantly shot out explosively.

He even spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Qin Yu!”

The man with the mustache and Xiao Yu hurriedly chased after him.

Qin Yu wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and said in a low voice, “What a terrifying power.”

“Are you... alright?” The man with the mustache asked with a frown.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I’m fine. It’s just a small injury. This purple-gold calabash is really terrifying.”

“Your physical body is even more terrifying,” the man with the mustache muttered.

“I’ve never heard of anyone who could resist the purple-gold calabash with their physical body without dying.”

Qin Yu rubbed his fist and smiled. “It’s alright.”

Qin Yu was quite satisfied with the strength of his body.

With his current body, no one below the Martial Saint level could compare to him.

“I’ll give this purple-gold calabash to you,” Qin Yu said.

The man with the mustache was stunned. He said in surprise, “Really?”

“Of course,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“You’ve helped me a lot. Moreover, you said that this purple-gold calabash is summoning you.”

The man with the mustache didn’t know what to say for a moment.

He knew what a Purple-gold Pill meant.

Moreover, to the man with the mustache, he had a purpose to get close to Qin Yu.

But he didn’t expect that Qin Yu would be so generous. He gave up a Purple-gold Pill for him and even offended the young master of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

He put away the purple-gold calabash and said with a smile, “I owe you a favor.”

Just as the two of them were thanking each other, Yan Jinyao walked over.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, what kind of spell are you researching? Are you planning to use this spell to deal with Blackie?”

“It’s none of your business.” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

“You shattered our mansion, and you still say it’s none of our business?” The disciple beside Yan Jinyao shouted.

“Qin Yu! You better think of how to compensate us. Otherwise, we won’t forgive you!” The disciple shouted.

Qin Yu glanced at him and slapped him.

The huge force directly made the disciple’s mouth full of blood, and his body flew out.

“Your master didn’t even say anything. Who do you think you are?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“You can’t spare me? How dare you try to threaten me?”

The disciple’s expression changed. He opened his mouth to say something, but found that his jaw had been broken, and he couldn’t say a word.

Yan Jinyao’s expression was extremely ugly.

In front of so many people, his own people had been beaten up. He definitely wouldn’t take this lying down.

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, it’s unreasonable for you to hit my disciple just like that.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Your disciple doesn’t know etiquette. I taught him a lesson for you. There’s no need to be polite.”

Yan Jinyao’s expression was extremely gloomy. He took a deep breath and suddenly slapped Xiao Yu!
