2020 Facing Elder Si

Elder Si’s tone was full of anger and resentment, causing the people around him to tremble in fear.

“Third Elder, what are your plans?” a trusted aide asked discreetly.

Elder Si narrowed her eyes and said, “Kill him. As long as I kill Qin Yu, I can make up for it!”

“Elder Si, what if Qin Yu is plotting something?” the trusted aide frowned.

Elder Si glanced at him, sneered, and said, “Plotting? In the face of absolute strength, everything was futile! I can crush him like crushing an ant!”

Hearing Elder Si’s words, the trusted aide couldn’t help but feel worried. However, he knew Elder Si had made up his mind, so it was useless to remind him again.

“Alright, I’ll get someone to prepare,” the trusted aide bowed and said.

Elder Si did not say anything else. He had already begun to plan how to deal with Qin Yu.

As far as he was concerned, Qin Yu was just an unremarkable nobody, and he could deal with him easily. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, Elder Si was so eager to achieve something that he couldn’t care less.

Not only did Elder Si hear about the news, but so did Xiao Hai.

In a tavern, Xiao Hai suddenly stood up after hearing the discussions of the people around him.

He looked outside Divine Fortuity City and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu is here?”

Xiao Hai, who suddenly stood up, naturally attracted the attention of the people around him.

“Isn’t he the person who had a conflict with Elder Si a few days ago?” they whispered.

“That’s right. It’s him. He offended Elder Si by standing up for someone. I didn’t expect him to be here still.”

“Could it be that he knows Qin Yu?”

Everyone was discussing animatedly. Some busybodies even came forward and asked, “Brother, could it be that you know Qin Yu?”

Xiao Hai did not deny it and immediately nodded. “That’s right. I’ve known Qin Yu for many years.”

“My friend, may I ask if you know where Qin Yu is?” Xiao Hai asked.

“It’s in a valley 30 stars away from Divine Fortuity City,” the person at the side immediately said.

Xiao Hai did not say anything else. He immediately stood up and planned to look for Qin Yu.

However, at this moment, the person beside him hurriedly stopped Xiao Hai.

“Brother, you have offended Elder Si. You must not go now. Otherwise, Elder Si will definitely deal with you as well.”

“That’s right. Brother, why don’t you temporarily stay out of it? Qin Yu probably has left.”

Everyone’s advice did not change Xiao Hai’s determination.

“Thank you for your kindness, everyone.” He cupped his hands and said, “But I, Xiao Hai, am not a coward. I will not abandon my friends!”

After saying this, Xiao Hai flashed and left Divine Fortuity City.

At this moment, Qin Yu was at the center of the killing formation in the valley.

In front of him was a jar of dragon blood. The dragon blood emitted a strange smell.

“The Endless Killing Formation requires fresh blood to activate. The higher the quality of the blood, the more powerful the formation will be,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“If I use dragon blood, I can unleash the full potential of this Endless Killing Formation. However, if I use too much power, I might suffer a backlash, causing me to be unable to control this formation.”

Qin Yu looked at the dragon blood in front of him and took a deep breath. In the end, he decided to use the dragon blood to activate the Endless Killing Formation.

He knew that doing so was risky. But to ensure he could kill Elder Si, he had to try.

“If that’s the case, I’m afraid my face will be exposed,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He sat cross-legged with his eyes closed slightly, quietly waiting for Elder Si’s arrival.

A moment later.

Qin Yu felt a powerful internal qi approaching. He suddenly opened his eyes and looked in the direction of the source of the internal qi.

“Are you here?” Qin Yu placed his palm on the dragon blood jar in front of him, ready to unleash the formation at any time.

But soon, Qin Yu saw who it was. It was not Elder Si, but Xiao Hai!

“Mr. Xiao, you…Why are you here?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

Xiao Hai looked at the face opposite him and instantly laughed out loud.

“Qin Yu, it’s really you! A few days ago, I felt your internal qi was somewhat familiar!” Xiao Hai laughed heartily.

But now was not the time to reminisce. Qin Yu frowned and said, “Mr. Xiao, leave this place quickly!”

“I came here to save you,” Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

“I don’t need it!” Qin Yu frowned even more because he had already sensed several internal qis approaching!

Knowing Xiao Hai would not retreat so easily, Qin Yu pointed at the ground under his feet and said, “I’ve set up a killing formation here. Once I activate the killing formation, everyone in the formation will die except for the one controlling it! Hurry up and leave!”

“The Endless Killing Formation?” Xiao Hai instantly guessed something.

“That’s right. Hurry up and leave, or it’ll be too late!” Qin Yu said anxiously.

“It’s too late.” A cold voice came from the dark.

Qin Yu looked up and saw Elder Si walking over with a few cultivators following him.

A powerful internal qi surged. The might of a Semi-Saint was fully displayed at this moment!

“You used a secret technique to change your appearance, did you?” Elder Si looked at Qin Yu’s blurry face and could not help but snort coldly.

Qin Yu looked at Elder Si coldly and said, “As expected of the elder of the Si family. You could see through my technique with a glance.”

...

Elder Si snorted and said, “You’re like an ant in my eyes. Your so-called technique is even more worthless.”

At this moment, Elder Si looked at Xiao Hai. He narrowed his eyes and said with a faint smile, “So you both know each other. Just nice. I’ll kill you today too!”

Although Elder Ji said that, he was actually a little uncertain.

After all, he could not see through Xiao Hai’s strength at all. If Xiao Hai joined, it would add unknown variables to this battle.

Before Xiao Hai could speak, Qin Yu said, “I don’t know him at all. I just happened to meet him here.”

Xiao Hai understood Qin Yu’s intentions. He looked at Elder Si and said, “We indeed don’t know each other. As for the grudge between the two of you, it has nothing to do with me.”

After saying this, Xiao Hai turned around and wanted to leave.

“What? You want to run away?” Elder Si shouted. “I thought you were very capable!”

Although he said that, he felt relieved in his heart.

To Elder Si, killing Qin Yu was more important than anything else. He did not want any unforeseen circumstances to occur.

After Xiao Hai left, Elder Si’s face turned cold.

...

“Qin Yu, I have been looking for you for a long time…” Elder Si narrowed his eyes and gritted his teeth.

“Looks like you missed me very much, old b*stard,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“You’re about to die, yet you still dare to be stubborn!” Elder Si gritted his teeth and said.
