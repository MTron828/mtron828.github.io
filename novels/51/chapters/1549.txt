Chapter 1550: Chapter 1,550, the Terrifying Elder! 1

The faces of these sect members instantly turned pale!

It wasn’t because of this oppressive feeling, but because of Qin Yu’s identity!

In the entire South Province, there weren’t many people who could make them feel such an oppressive feeling. Other than the three madness, three absolutes, and one legend, there were only people from the Heavenly Cloud sect!

“Senior... senior, we were blind. Please spare our lives...”someone said in a trembling voice.

“We have eyes but don’t recognize Mount Tai. We Beg senior to let us go...”

Seeing their attitude, Qin Yu retracted his internal Qi.

Everyone panted heavily, and their faces were still filled with terror.

“May I ask what is Senior’s identity...”someone mustered up his courage and asked.

“Senior, at your age, there are probably not many people in the entire south province who possess such strength...”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said indifferently, “My name is Qin Yu.”

As soon as he said this, everyone’s expressions changed drastically!

“Qin Yu? You are the Qin Yu who defeated Yongji not long ago?”

“Rumor has it that you stopped the war by yourself, and the first elder also died at your hands...”

......

“I didn’t expect you to be Qin Yu. Please forgive me, Senior!”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “All of you, Scram.”

These people didn’t dare to say anything more and fled.

While speaking, Qin Yu’s eyes were fixed on the elder who took the Beast Spirit Pill formula not far away.

After hesitating for a long time, Qin Yu finally decided to snatch the Beast Spirit Pill formula from his hands. At the very least, he had to read it.

Looking in his direction, Qin Yu quietly followed behind him.

The old man’s walking speed was not fast, so it was not difficult for Qin Yu to follow him.

He restrained his internal Qi and quietly followed behind him.

The old man did not seem to notice Qin Yu following him, and his pace was extremely slow.

However, Qin Yu felt that other than himself, there were other people secretly following him.

“It seems that there are quite a number of people who are interested in this beast spirit pill,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The group of people followed behind the old man and soon left the vicinity of the Qingyan Forest auction.

Along the way, they came to a desolate wilderness. This was the edge of the Qingyan Forest, and there were no people around.

The people hiding in the dark were restless, as if they were ready to make a move at any time.

At this moment, the old man suddenly stopped.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Everyone, there’s no need to hide. Show yourself.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Could it be that this old man had already discovered them? Then why did he come to this deserted wilderness?

Soon, a tall young man walked out from the dark.

Many people appeared one after another as he appeared.

There were more than ten people at a glance!

There were young and old, strong and weak. Each of them had a greedy look on their faces.

On the other hand, the old man didn’t show much panic on his face. He just crossed his hands behind his back and quietly swept his gaze across the crowd.

“Everyone, you have followed us all the way. I believe you have something important to say. Please speak,”the old man said indifferently.

“Old Thing, don’t pretend to be ignorant. Hand over the Beast Spirit Pill Formula on your body, and we may leave your corpse intact!”Someone shouted.

“That’s right. Hand over the thing, or don’t blame us for being impolite!”

Hearing this, the old man couldn’t help but stroke his beard and smile. “So, everyone is planning to kill people and steal their goods?”

“That’s exactly what I’m thinking!”Someone shouted.

The old man laughed and said, “If you want to kill and steal, you have to see if you have the ability.”

“You are courting death!”

Someone shouted and then rushed toward the old man!

But when he rushed to the front of the old man, he suddenly stopped!

His palm was still in the attacking position, but his body stood there without moving at all!

Layers of secret sweat appeared on his forehead as if he was under a huge pressure!

“What are you standing there for!”

Someone seemed to be impatient and immediately strode towards the old man.

At this moment, the old man slowly raised his hand and gently pinched forward. Everyone present was instantly frozen on the spot!

“Eh?”

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change drastically!

What kind of method was this? ! Just by raising his hand, he was able to restrict everyone? !

Although these people weren’t considered powerful, they were all mighty realm powerhouses. How could they be so easily subdued? !

“Old... Old Thing, what on Earth did you do... ?”

No one knew who it was, but it was difficult for them to say these words.

The old man glanced at him coldly. Then, with a thought, the speaker’s body directly exploded!

This scene scared everyone to the point of peeing their pants!

They didn’t even know what the old man had done! What kind of method did he use to kill people! !

“Reckless Thing.”The old man put his hands behind his back, and his tone was extremely cold.

In the next second, the bodies of everyone present exploded inexplicably!

Blood instantly splattered all over the ground, and the old man’s clothes were also dyed red!

Qin Yu, who was hiding in the dark, turned extremely pale! He couldn’t help but feel lucky that he wasn’t the one who attacked!

“This old man’s ability... is actually so terrifying!”Qin Yu sucked in a cold breath!

This old man’s strength was probably the most powerful person in Qin Yu’s life, other than the Dao Guardian!

“Phew... It’s better to leave this place as soon as possible,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although the Beast Spirit Pill recipe was indeed extremely tempting, it was not worth Qin Yu’s life.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, the old man not far away suddenly looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

This instantly made Qin Yu’s back break out in a cold sweat! That gaze was like being stared at by a ferocious tiger, causing people to Shudder!

“Could it be... that he has already discovered me!”Qin Yu instantly felt his entire body go soft!

“You should come out as well. Do you think you can hide?”The old man said coldly.

Qin Yu gasped. He knew that there was nowhere to run, so he could only brace himself and walk out.

The old man looked at Qin Yu coldly and sneered, “What? Are You Afraid of Death?”

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Senior, I just want to borrow the Beast Spirit Pill formula to read it. Please forgive me, Senior.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Borrow it? Borrow it, or snatch it?”The old man said coldly.

“If I were just a mortal, would I have become a dead soul under your command?”

The old man’s voice directly hit the divine sense, causing unbearable pain.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and answered truthfully, “If senior was just a mortal, I wouldn’t have any intention of killing you. I just wanted to borrow it.”

“You’re full of nonsense. Do you think I’ll believe your nonsense?”The old man said coldly.

He slowly raised his hand and said coldly, “Since you’re here, you should be prepared to die!”

After saying that, the old man pinched Qin Yu’s direction.
