Du Hengsheng suddenly thought of Qin Yu.

He hurried to Qin Yu’s side, cupped his hands, and said, “Mr. Qin, you must help me...”

Qin Yu looked at Lu Ning and smiled. “Perhaps Lu Sr. is more professional in this kind of thing.”

Lu Ning couldn’t help but force a smile and said, “Mr. Qin, please forgive me for my ignorance.”

“Lu Sr., you’re too polite. I just got lucky. In terms of professional knowledge, I can’t compare to Lu Sr.,” Qin Yu said politely.

This made Lu Sr. sigh.

To be so humble at such a young age was really admirable.

“This boy’s future is definitely full of potential,” Lu Ning thought to himself.

Then, Lu Ning walked to Qin Yu’s side, bowed and said, “I’ve said that if I can really dig up something, I, Lu Ning, am willing to take you as my master.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately said with some fear, “Lu Sr., I can’t afford that. Everyone learns from each other. There is no difference in rank.”

This immediately made Lu Ning feel grateful.

He was almost 70 years old. It was indeed inappropriate for him to call Qin Yu a teacher.

Therefore, Lu Ning bowed and said, “Mr. Qin, if there is anything you need help with, just let me know!”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

Lu Ning spent half an hour dispelling the sorcery.

He didn’t stay any longer and left the Du family in a hurry.

Qin Yu, Du Hengsheng, and Du Yuan returned to the living room. Du Hengsheng said with gratitude, “Mr. Qin, you saved my life. I, Du Hengsheng, will definitely remember this favor!”

After saying that, Du Hengsheng took out a bank card and handed it to Qin Yu.

“There is one million in here. Although it isn’t a lot, it is a token of my appreciation. Please accept it, Mr. Qin,” Du Hengsheng said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately put the bank card into his pocket.

“Mr. Du, why did you ask me to come here this time?” Qin Yu took the initiative to ask.

Du Hengsheng forced a smile and said, “To tell you the truth, I really have something to ask you for help.”

“Under the suppression of the Shen family, many of our company’s partners have announced the unilateral termination of their contracts. Many of the projects of the Du family have been terminated,” Du Hengsheng sighed.

“It has only been one day, but the Du family is already in a pinch and the Shen family has no intention of leaving. I’m afraid the Du family will be in even more trouble.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but lament the Shen family’s strength. Even the richest man in Jiangcheng was unable to retaliate, so let alone the others?

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “Although I sympathize with you, I don’t think I can be of much help in this matter.”

Du Yuan, who was at the side, smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, as long as you give us a share of the project in your hands, our family will be able to revive.”

Qin Yu was stunned. He said awkwardly, “Project? When did I have a project...” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Du Yuan said in surprise, “Mr. Qin, don’t you know? Miss Yan said that all the investment of the Yan family in Jiangcheng will be up to you.”

“Yes, as long as you agree, our family will be able to get the Yan family’s project,” Du Hengsheng also nodded and said.

“Although the Shen family is strong, they definitely won’t dare to get their hands on the Yan family’s project.”

After saying that, Du Hengsheng stood up and bowed to Qin Yu. He said with a slightly pleading tone, “Mr. Qin, you are the only one who can help us now. Otherwise, our family will definitely go bankrupt...”

Qin Yu was a little surprised. He had never thought that Yan Ruoxue would hand over the authority of the Yan family’s investment to him.

Moreover, it was obvious that not many people knew about this news. Otherwise, there would be tons of people knocking on Qin Yu’s door.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything for a moment. Instead, he sat there and pondered for a moment.

“I have a better business,” Qin Yu said at this moment.

Du Hengsheng was stunned. He said with some surprise, “A better business?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. The Shen family made their fortune with health products. I have a better product in my hands.”

At the moment, the Soul Nourishment Pill needed a strong company to act as an agent. Lei Hu definitely didn’t have those capabilities.

As the richest family in Jiangcheng, the Du family was the best candidate.

Qin Yu took out a Soul Nourishment Pill from his pocket and put it on the table.

“I can give this medicine to your family as an agent. I can also tell you that this medicine will definitely become popular. Using it to deal with the Shen family, or even surpassing the Shen family, won’t be a problem!” Qin Yu’s tone was filled with confidence.

As long as the price was kept down and sold on a large scale, the Shen family wouldn’t be a match against it at all.

However, Du Hengsheng didn’t think so. In his opinion, this medicine wasn’t reliable at all.

Therefore, Du Hengsheng said tactfully, “Mr. Qin, if it’s possible, you... you’d better give us a project... we really don’t have it in us to enjoy this medicine...”

Although Du Hengsheng didn’t say it explicitly, his meaning was very obvious.

Du Hengsheng didn’t care about the Soul Nourishment Pill at all.

Qin Yu sighed slightly. He put away the Soul Nourishment Pill and said, “If that’s the case, then fine. Come to me with the contract tomorrow.”

“Good, good. Thank you, Mr. Qin!” Du Hengsheng’s face was instantly filled with excitement.

He suddenly didn’t realize that he had inadvertently missed an excellent business opportunity.

This also made Qin Yu feel regretful for Du Hengsheng.

“In that case, I’ll leave the Soul Nourishment Pill to Lei Hu for the time being,” Qin Yu thought to himself.
