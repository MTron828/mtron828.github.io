Chapter 382: Han Wei’s Phone Call Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Such a lineup made people shudder!

The cold smile on Yan Sihai’s face deepened. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I don’t want to hurt you. I just want to exchange you for Qin Yu.”

“I believe that the Pavilion Master will make the right choice.”

The Pavilion Master still had a nonchalant smile on her face. There wasn’t the slightest hint of fear.

“Do you think I’ll agree?” The Pavilion Master asked indifferently.

Yan Sihai sneered. “If you don’t agree, then you won’t be able to leave the Yan family’s manor today!”

As soon as he finished speaking, all the gunners loaded their guns!

Those Inner Strength Grandmasters were prepared. As long as Yan Sihai gave the order, they would immediately take action!

The Pavilion Master sighed slightly, raised her smooth and fair hand, and lightly waved it.

In an instant, the gunmen surrounding the Pavilion Master all fell to the ground!

Even the Inner Strength Grandmasters behind Yan Sihai started to become drowsy.

“What... What’s going on?” Yan Sihai’s expression changed.

The Pavilion Master smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’m just letting them sleep.”

As they spoke, the Inner Strength Grandmasters couldn’t take it anymore and fell to the ground.

Yan Sihai’s expression changed and he asked coldly, “What method did you use?”

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “Medicine can not only save people, but it can also kill people.”

“Medicine?” Yan Sihai reacted.

He hurriedly covered his nose.

“President Yan, don’t worry. If I wanted to attack you, you would have already fallen,” the Pavilion Master said indifferently.

Yan Sihai’s expression became even colder, and the internal qi on his body also began to surge.

“President Yan, are you going to attack me?” The Pavilion Master raised her brows and asked.

Yan Sihai said coldly, “I’ve heard that the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has extraordinary strength. Today, I would like to experience it.”

The internal qi on his body rose rapidly, and the strength of a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster was fully displaided!

In the next second, Yan Sihai’s figure suddenly disappeared!

His powerful fist arrived in front of the Pavilion Master in the blink of an eye!

“Pa!”

The Pavilion Master raised her smooth and fair hand and caught Yan Sihai’s fist.

“Huh?” Yan Sihai couldn’t help but frown.

The feeling of this punch was rather strange, as if it had hit a ball of cotton.

Such a gentle force made Yan Sihai unable to use his strength.

“You aren’t my match,” the Pavilion Master said indifferently.

“Of course, if you are determined to attack me, I don’t mind teaching you a lesson on behalf of Old Mister Yan.” The Pavilion Master’s voice became somewhat cold.

The gentle force on her body also disappeared, and was replaced by an unspeakable fierce force!

The combination of hardness and softness made Yan Sihai instantly feel the difference.

He withdrew the internal qi on his body and said coldly, “The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is indeed worthy of your reputation. But I warn you, no one can go against the Yan family.”

“Oh really? Is that so?” The Pavilion Master raised her eyebrows.

“What? Do you really think that the Yan family is the number one family in the world?”

Yan Sihai snickered and said, “In the entire world, there are only a handful of people who can oppose the Yan family. However, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion isn’t one of them.”

The corner of the Pavilion Master’s mouth also curled into a cold smile.

“President Yan, you can try to start a war with the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” the Pavilion Master coldly said.

Yan Sihai snickered and said, “Perhaps there will really be such a day.”

“I’ll wait for you,” the Pavilion Master coldly said.

With that said, the Pavilion Master turned around and left.

As Yan Sihai looked at the back of the Pavilion Master, he couldn’t help but clench his fists and gnash his teeth!

“This b*tch... I’ll kill you sooner or later,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

...

It was already late at night.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion was completely silent.

Occasionally, one could hear the croaking of frogs in early spring and the rustling of leaves.

Qin Yu laid on the bed, tossing and turning, but was unable to fall asleep.

All he could think about was Yan Ruoxue.

The Pavilion Master had been gone for an entire day, but there was still no news from her. This made Qin Yu very uneasy.

He walked down from the bed and couldn’t help but walk to the entrance of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

As he stood at the entrance and looked out, the street was completely silent.

Qin Yu didn’t sleep for an entire night.

It wasn’t until the next morning that the Pavilion Master returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Many Elders were already waiting in the square, just like the first time Qin Yu came to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Upon seeing the Pavilion Master, Qin Yu hurriedly ran over.

“Lord Pavilion Master, how is Ruoxue?” Qin Yu said somewhat anxiously.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said, “She has recovered from her mental illness.”

“That’s good.” Qin Yu patted his chest and couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

“But I must tell you that Yan Ruoxue isn’t doing well now.” The Pavilion Master changed the topic.

Following that, the Pavilion Master told Qin Yu the truth about Yan Ruoxue’s current situation.

After he heard these words, Qin Yu’s heart ached.

Plummeting from the top to rock bottom was often the hardest thing to bear.

“Pavilion Master, don’t waste time. Didn’t you say that you would help me get the Meridian Circulation Technique?” Qin Yu looked at the Pavilion Master and said.

The Pavilion Master yawned and said, “Let’s talk about it after I wake up.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth to say something, but in the end, he didn’t say anything.

Because he knew that the Pavilion Master’s decision could never be changed.

“Oh right, she asked me to bring you something.” At this time, the Pavilion Master seemed to have thought of something.

She took out the bank card and handed it to Qin Yu.

“Bank card?” Qin Yu took the bank card and couldn’t help but frown.

“Yes, the password is the last six digits,” said the Pavilion Master.

“Oh right, she also said that she would wait for you.”

After saying these few words, the Pavilion Master turned around to leave.

Rubbing the bank card in his hand, Qin Yu felt an indescribable feeling inside.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to give this bank card to Old Mister Yan.

Coincidentally, Qin Yu also planned to discuss something with Old Mister Yan.

Therefore, Qin Yu took the bank card, turned around and walked towards Old Mister Yan’s room.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

Picking up the phone, he saw that the caller was actually Han Wei! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Even though Qin Yu didn’t save Han Wei’s phone number, Qin Yu still recognized this number at a glance.

As soon as the call was picked up, Han Wei said gloomily, “Qin Yu, does it feel good to be a cowardly turtle?”

Qin Yu didn’t want to argue with Han Wei, so he asked coldly, “What’s the matter?”

“Hahaha!” Han Wei laughed loudly.

“Speaking of which, I admire you. You hide behind a woman’s back, but flaunt your power every day. It really makes people envious,” Han Wei said with a strange tone.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Yeah, I’m so popular with women. What do you think I should do? Take Yan Ruoxue for example. She just happens to like me. I’m also very stressed about it.”

Han Wei’s expression immediately turned cold.
