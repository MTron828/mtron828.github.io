Chapter 1482: Chapter 1,482, battling the eighteen celestials! 1

The thing they were most worried about had indeed happened.

The eighteen celestials did not care about the life and death of the white-robed Daoist at all. What they wanted was to kill Qin Yu!

“The Heavenly Cloud sect is actually so merciless,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The white-robed Daoist broke out in cold sweat. At this moment, he had no other choice.

“Since that’s the case, you can only die,”Qin Yu said coldly as he leaned against the white-robed Daoist’s ear.

Qin Yu’s finger gently tapped on the radiance and headed straight for the white-robed Daoist’s glabella!

At this critical moment, the white-robed Daoist decisively abandoned his physical body and fled with his primordial spirit!

A shadow stood in mid-air. His expression was extremely unsightly, and his entire body was trembling non-stop.

“That was close. My soul was almost destroyed...”the white-robed Daoist said in a trembling voice.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the corpse in front of him and could not help but sneer, “White-robed Daoist, you ran quite fast.”

The white-robed Daoist looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Brat, I will definitely remember the grudge of destroying my body. We will meet again in the future!”

After saying this, the white-robed Daoist quickly left.

Qin Yu knew that he could not stop the white-robed Daoist, so he did not pursue him.

He raised his head to look at the eighteen gods and said, “This is the medicine saint’s capital. Aren’t you afraid of destroying the medicine saint?”

However, the eighteen gods’reply was still simple and neat.

“Our orders are to kill you. The rest has nothing to do with us.”The eighteen gods seemed to have said this at the same time.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold. He looked up at the eighteen men of God and knew that there was no retreat.

There was already an inescapable net here. There was no way he could escape.

“If that’s the case, then let’s fight,”Qin Yu said coldly.

With that, his internal Qi rose rapidly. In a short moment, it rose to the limit.

Qin Yu’s body emitted a terrifying heat wave.

This heat wave spread to the surroundings, causing the space to tremble like water ripples.

Such an internal Qi could not help but cause people to be shocked! However, the eighteen gods turned a blind eye and did not put Qin Yu in their eyes at all.

Facing the eighteen gods, Qin Yu did not dare to hide anything. He directly opened the fifth level of the fighting word formula, intending to fight to the death.

The eighteen gods looked at Qin Yu coldly. Their internal Qi was obviously extremely calm, but their powerful killing intent made people feel terrified.

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu roared and stepped on the line word formula, taking the initiative to attack!

The eighteen godly men’s figures quickly disappeared, as if they were hiding in space. In the next second, they reappeared in the distance.

When they reappeared, the thirty-six hands were already pointing at Qin Yu.

It was as if an extremely terrifying move was condensing in their palms. Rays of light surged out from their palms!

“Weng!”

Thirty-six rays of light exploded in an instant. They coiled up at an extremely fast speed and finally converged into a light pillar!

This light pillar transformed into tens of thousands of DAO technique. It was clearly just a light pillar, yet it was unpredictable.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He raised his hand and met it with a ten thousand spell breaking punch!

This technique was unparalleled in the world. Qin Yu’s fist was even more invincible!

All of the spiritual power gathered at one point, and the golden brilliance was like a sun and moon!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s furious fist met the attack and collided with the Dao technique of the eighteen gods! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

At the moment of collision, an overwhelming aura surged out!

Even though a formation was set up here, the surrounding crowd was still affected and died on the spot!

The brilliance that the eighteen gods had activated shattered in an instant, then drilled into the void and disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu’s condition was not much better. Even though he had used all his divine arts, he still took a few steps back. His wrist was shaken until it hurt.

“The eighteen gods really live up to their reputation.”Qin Yu could not help but sigh in his heart.

This punch was probably Qin Yu’s strongest punch, but it had only shattered one of their spells.

This made Qin Yu feel a trace of unease in his heart.

One had to know that the spells of the eighteen gods were strange and unpredictable. Rumor has it that since they appeared, they had already cast hundreds of spells.

Moreover, each spell was incomparably powerful!

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted. He looked at the eighteen gods as if he was planning something.

The eighteen gods also looked at Qin Yu coldly. They didn’t make a move for a long time, as if they were evaluating Qin Yu’s ability.

Within the medicine Saint Hall.

The Alchemy King’s expression was extremely cold.

He had personally witnessed this great battle, and he had also personally witnessed Qin Yu’s ability.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that any trace of residual power just now could have taken his life.

“If Qin Yu doesn’t die, I’m afraid I’ll have to run away as well.”The Alchemy King clenched his teeth.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. All of this was because of Qin Yu!

If it wasn’t for his arrival, his peaceful life wouldn’t have been disrupted!

“Could it be that the eighteen gods can’t even kill a single Qin Yu?”The Alchemy King stared fiercely at Qin Yu.

He wanted to help, but there was nothing he could do.

Just as the Alchemy King was in deep thought, the great battle below began once again.

Qin Yu extended his palm, and a treasured sword fell into his hand.

This sword was none other than Qin Yu’s bronze sword.

Qin Yu held this sword with both hands and looked coldly at the eighteen gods.

He speculated for a long time, but still couldn’t find any flaws in the eighteen gods.

These eighteen people were like a single entity, without any flaws to speak of.

“Buzz!”

The eighteen gods also made their move at this moment. They once again raised their palms and pointed at Qin Yu.

In an instant, streaks of dark radiance lit up.

Within that radiance, it was as if there were countless evil ghosts roaring, and even more so, it was as if there were skeletons wailing.

The surroundings instantly became incomparably cold. The originally hot weather became incomparably cold.

“Swish!”

The eighteen gods did not say any nonsense. They only raised their palms, and that aura that was like a river rushed over!

Qin Yu clenched his teeth. He grabbed the bronze sword with both hands and shouted!

“Nine absolute beginning slashes, fourth slash!”

After the shout, the terrifying sword light seemed to come from the sky. It destroyed everything and turned everything into nothingness!

The huge sword light slashed toward the eighteen gods!

The collision of the lights caused a strong internal Qi fluctuation.

The two rays of light seemed to have come to a standstill at this moment. The sounds of slurping were extremely ear-piercing.

However, in less than half a second after the collision, the sword Ray was swallowed and turned towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed drastically! He leaped into the air and wanted to escape. Unfortunately, the space was too small and there was no way to escape!

“Ah! !”

In such a dangerous situation, Qin Yu could only choose to take it head-on!

At this moment, all of his protective arts burst forth, and Qin Yu’s body seemed to be plated with a layer of golden radiance!

His arms were crossed in front of his chest, and he actually planned to use his physical body to take it head-on!

“Boom!”

The radiance exploded, incomparably resplendent, causing the entire sky to turn white-hot.

The extremely dazzling radiance even pierced through people’s eyes, and even the pill refining King’s eyes couldn’t help but bleed.
