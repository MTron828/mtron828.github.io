Chapter 1013: Chapter 1,013, stepping into the Martial Saint Realm!

Li Ziqi could not help but squint his eyes when he saw this move.

“You really dare to stop me? Do you think you can stop me with just you?”Li Ziqi said coldly.

“How would I know if I don’t try?”The pavilion master said calmly.

Li Ziqi’s expression turned cold as he said, “You don’t know whether you’re Dead or Alive!”

After he finished speaking, Li Ziqi waved his large hand and directly grabbed towards the pavilion master!

The pavilion master did not dare to be negligent. A purple aura erupted from her body. That Aura transformed into a large hand and headed towards Li Ziqi!

“Bang!”

Unfortunately, the gap between a martial marquis and a martial saint was too big. How could the pavilion master be a match for Li Ziqi.

At the moment of contact, the purple light was immediately dispersed! The body of the pavilion master could not help but take a few steps back!

The expression of the pavilion master could not help but change.

“You broke my formation with just one palm. You are indeed worthy of being a martial saint.”The pavilion master said in a low voice.

Li Ziqi said coldly, “I remember that the Wan family’s Secret Realm’s Wan Gu Qiong seems to be interested in you. It would be better to cripple you and give you to the Wan Gu Qiong as a favor.”

With that, Li Ziqi walked over. He lifted his palm and pushed away the pavilion master’s Purple Light!

Pavilion master did not dare to be negligent. She hurriedly condensed the purple light again and turned it into a palm, slamming it at Li Ziqi!

“Bang!”

But this purple light was not worth mentioning in front of Li Ziqi. It was immediately scattered upon contact!

Li Ziqi’s palm passed through the purple light and slammed fiercely on pavilion master’s chest!

“Pu!”

With this palm strike, the pavilion master’s body was instantly pushed back. She spat out a mouthful of blood and her face turned extremely pale!

She tried to stand up but she realized that the pain from her wound made it impossible for her to stand up!

“You don’t know life from death.”Li Ziqi snorted coldly.

After he had finished speaking, he no longer paid attention to the pavilion master. Instead, he looked at the heavenly tribulation.

“It’s really a troublesome matter to let you become a martial saint.”Li Ziqi said coldly.

“Fortunately, I met you. It’s your bad luck.”

Li Ziqi opened his mouth and strode towards this lightning tribulation.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that his body had been frozen in place and he could not move.

“Eh?”

Li Ziqi frowned slightly. He lowered his head and saw two large purple hands grabbing onto his legs.

Not far away, the pavilion master was using all his strength to grab onto Li Ziqi!

“You’re courting death!”

This immediately made Li Ziqi furious!

He slashed with his hand and directly cut off the large purple hand!

Following that, Li Ziqi’s palm shook and a ray of light instantly sent the pavilion master flying!

“If you dare to block me again, kill without mercy!”Li Ziqi said coldly.

Pavilion master stood up with difficulty. She wanted to activate the purple light again, but she found that she no longer had any strength left in her body.

“You... stop...”pavilion master said with difficulty.

But how could Li Ziqi care about that? He strode towards the Lightning Tribulation.

“Kid, You’re Dead!”Li Ziqi laughed crazily.

But just as his foot touched the lightning tribulation, it was directly turned into powder by the Heavenly Tribulation! Half of his leg was instantly turned into ashes!

Li Ziqi’s expression could not help but change!

“What a powerful heavenly tribulation,”Li Ziqi exclaimed.

He frowned and his body shook. Rays of light immediately burst out from his body.

These rays of light continuously twined around his body and finally turned into armor!

With the protection of this level of armor, Li Ziqi once again stepped towards the heavenly tribulation.

However, when the armor touched the heavenly tribulation, it was shattered again!

This could not help but cause Li Ziqi’s expression to change drastically! His body also shot backwards!

“The second son’s heavenly tribulation is actually this terrifying?”Li Ziqi exclaimed in shock.

One had to know that he was also someone who had experienced the martial saint’s Heavenly Tribulation. Moreover, he had successfully survived the heavenly tribulation!

However, at this moment, when facing Qin Yu’s heavenly tribulation, he actually did not have the ability to resist!

“If this kid successfully becomes a martial saint, I don’t know how terrifying he will be!”Li Ziqi said in a low voice.

When he thought of this, his body shot out and his hands slowly closed in the air.

Then, he saw a huge blade condensed between his hands!

This blade was mighty and majestic in the air. A terrifying aura spread out in all directions.

“Kid, I will never let you become a martial saint!”Li Ziqi said coldly.

In the next second, he shouted loudly. Both of his hands immediately moved and slashed fiercely towards this sea of lightning!

A majestic aura instantly entered this heavenly tribulation’s internal Qi! That Sea of lightning was actually forcefully cut into two halves!

When he saw this scene, the pavilion master’s expression immediately became extremely ugly!

Li Ziqi coldly looked at the center of the Heavenly Tribulation and said in a low voice, “It’s actually reuniting again.”

The Sea of lightning that was cut in half rippled in all directions like waves.

But very quickly, it was like a stream of water, reuniting together again.

“Let’s do it again. Even if we can’t break this lightning tribulation, we can still kill you.”Li Ziqi sneered.

With that said, he closed his hands once again, and that large saber condensed into form again!

“Go to Hell!”

Li Ziqi let out an angry roar and his palm once again fiercely chopped towards the sea of lightning!

“Swoosh!”

The Sea of lightning was once again split into two! This huge blade actually pierced through the sea of lightning and fiercely chopped down!

“Boom!”

The ground instantly shook and the mountains shook, and smoke and dust rose in all directions!

Although the Sea of lightning was once again formed, the ground beneath the sea of lightning had already been completely shattered!

“I have penetrated the lightning tribulation and taken your life.”Li Ziqi looked at the sea of lightning and said faintly.

He was certain that Qin Yu had already died under his large saber.

After that, Li Ziqi turned around and looked at the pavilion master.

He walked straight to the front of the pavilion master and said condescendingly, “Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, you are still as charming as ever. No wonder the Brat from the Wan family is so infatuated.”

He sized up the pavilion master’s curvy figure and could not help but narrow his eyes.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you.”Li Zi Qi said indifferently.

After that, he grabbed the pavilion master with one hand and held her in his embrace.

The pavilion master wanted to struggle, but found that she had no strength left.

“I believe that the Wan family will offer a pretty good bargaining chip.”Li Zi Qi grinned and said coldly.

Just as he was about to turn around and leave, he suddenly felt a chill on his back, as if it was stabbing his back!

A chill instantly covered his entire body! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This feeling was as if he was being targeted by a fierce tiger!

Li Ziqi’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly turned around!

He saw a young man in shabby clothes walking out of the Sea of lightning.

His expression was ice-cold, and his eyes were dark as he walked out of the Sea of lightning step by step.

“Qin Yu! You... You’re not dead!”Li Ziqi’s expression changed drastically!

Qin Yu, who was not far away, did not say anything. He only walked towards Li Ziqi step by step.

“You... you’ve become a martial saint?”Li Ziqi swallowed his saliva. He felt extremely uneasy!

“What do you think?”Qin Yu said coldly.
