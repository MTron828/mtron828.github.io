Chapter 1717: Chapter 1717, Elementalist Resurrection 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The western wilderness had coveted the southern region for a long time, and they had once made an agreement with the northern lands.

Now that they had disappeared, they would definitely make a move.

Thunder Academy had never participated in such matters, and no one was willing to provoke them.

It seemed that only the eastern region was left.

Sima bei tried to get up, but he realized that he did not have any strength at all.

“Looks like someone else will have to make a trip to the western wilderness,”Sima bei thought to himself.

…

Qin Yu rushed all the way back to the divine capital.

This was the best place for closed-door cultivation.

Ever since Qin Yu chased everyone away, this place had become much quieter.

After Qin Yu arrived at the divine capital, he was the first to arrive at the back of the mountain and find Zhuo Jing.

What surprised Qin Yu was that Zhuo Jing was still in closed-door cultivation and had no intention of coming out.

His internal QI had obviously been greatly improved, and he was only a step away from half-step to the return to void realm.

“This group of people’s cultivation speed is really fast,”Qin Yu said with emotion.

Zhuo Jing’s talent was very strong, but in Qin Yu’s eyes, there was still a certain gap between him and Chang Mang, Yao Meng, and the others.

“Maybe Chang Mang and the others have already stepped into the reversion void stage,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

This immediately made Qin Yu feel even more pressured. Every time he thought of the matter of the other chaotic body, Qin Yu became impatient.

He did not dare to waste any more time. He immediately took out the dragon blood and began the next round of cultivation.

…

The speed at which the river of death disappeared was beyond everyone’s imagination.

The first to disappear was the river of death in the South Province and the West Wilderness.

And the East Province and the South Province were only separated by a thin line.

“Sect leader, I’m afraid that the Li region will really merge into one. At that time, I’m afraid that my southern region will not be able to protect itself,”the deputy sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect said in a deep voice.

Xiao Sheng did not care. He said indifferently, “Then won’t I be able to get what I want?”

The deputy sect leader smiled bitterly and said, “The world has changed greatly. It is no longer the way it was back then. Although you are strong, how are you going to fight against so many people at the reversion void stage?”

Xiao Sheng was able to win against one person at the reversion void stage, but it was already somewhat strenuous.

If there were two or more people at the reversion void stage, Xiao Sheng was afraid that he would lose without a doubt.

Xiao Sheng did not refute this. This was indeed an undeniable fact.

“Sect leader, you should quickly break through and enter the reversion void stage as soon as possible.”The deputy sect leader advised.

Xiao Sheng was silent. It was obvious that he did not take the vice sect leader’s words to heart.

“If you face an elementalist in this state, you will definitely lose,”the vice sect leader said in a deep voice.

Xiao Sheng glanced at him and then slowly said, “If I enter the reversion void stage, what qualifications does he have to fight with me?”

The vice sect leader was startled and hurriedly said, “An elementalist obtained the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect, which was once the number one sect in the universe. You must not underestimate him!”

“I have my own plans,”Xiao Sheng said.

Another two days passed.

A huge face suddenly condensed in the sky above the southern region!

The size of this face was beyond imagination and almost covered the entire world!

Everyone in the southern region was instantly extremely alarmed. They stared at the face in the sky and exclaimed, “What is that thing? An Immortal? Or a celestial emperor?”

“It’s really an immortal that appeared from the sky!”

Some people were panicking, while others began to kneel down.

Soon, the face in the sky spoke.

He looked down at everyone and said coldly, “From today onwards, the western wilderness declares war on the South Province.”

His words caused everyone’s expression to change drastically!

This face actually came from the western wilderness!

The river of death had just disappeared, and the western wilderness was about to take action?

Facing a northern land, everyone was already struggling. Now that there was another western wilderness, what hope did the southern region have? ! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s over, the western wilderness is about to take action. Our Southern Region is in danger!”

“Why are they all attacking our southern region? !”

“A land of abundance, no need to say anything.”

On the same day, some people began to flee from the southern region, and the experts of the southern region also showed different attitudes.

In a secluded place in the southern region, a young man who looked to be in his thirties or forties raised his head and looked at this face.

“Southern Region… It’s time for me to leave. Now that I’ve stepped into the reversion void stage, the central region is my stage.”

On Mount Dayue, Wen Wanji looked at this face in the sky and jumped up and down, cursing.

“What a dog. When you come, I’ll tear your mouth apart!”Wen Wanji pointed at the face in the sky and cursed.

On Wind Bamboo Mountain, qu Zhu looked at the face and remained silent.

He drank a mouthful of wine and no one knew what he was thinking about.

…

Large groups of people began to gather at the northern border and the western border.

For a time, the southern region became the target of public criticism.

These past few days.

A terrifying sound suddenly came from the sky above the northern region. Then, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky!

This sound instantly startled the entire northern lands, and even countless people at the northern borders saw this terrifying phenomenon!

“Oh no, could it be that someone in the northern lands is about to step into the reversion void stage! ?”

“From this phenomenon, this person’s strength is probably extremely terrifying!”

“It doesn’t seem like a breakthrough to the reversion void stage. This is probably another phenomenon.”

In the center of the northern lands, the heavenly lightning struck the snow mountain.

The snow mountain was directly shattered by this explosion. It turned into spots and disappeared without a trace!

He Teng, who was guarding the Snow Mountain, hurriedly retreated.

He stared at the smoke in front of him as if he was anticipating something.

The smoke dispersed.

He saw a young man sitting cross-legged there.

His appearance was very similar to that of an elementalist in his younger days. However, he was much more mature compared to the other elementalists. He looked like a middle-aged man.

His long hair hung down his shoulders. His body was covered with a layer of light that was as white as ash.

This seemed to be the secret technique of the immortal slaying sect. It was also the symbol of the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect. It was extremely terrifying!

Rumor has it that the layer of light that was wrapped around it could allow a cultivator to possess a strength that was not weaker than the strength of all major physiques!

“So this is the complete version of an Elementalist.”He Teng looked at the elementalist in front of him and felt his heart palpitate. It was extremely terrifying!

Even he teng could not help but feel the urge to prostrate himself in worship at this moment. He had the urge to kneel down!

Compared to the younger elementalists, the middle-aged he teng was obviously wiser and more restrained. Whether it was his appearance or his internal QI, he had become more mature.

The elementalist sat cross-legged with his eyes slightly closed. He looked like a statue.

At this moment, three figures flew out from between his eyebrows!

These three figures were actually elementalists!

“Welcome back to life, Master!”

He Teng did not dare to think too much and quickly knelt down.

The three figures that separated from the elementalist’s body finally condensed into one and stood in front of He Teng.

He Teng could not help but be startled and immediately felt strange.

That elementalist was clearly still sitting in the snow mountain’s position. Then what was this elementalist in front of him?

“Reversion Void Stage!”He Teng was incomparably shocked in his heart!

Even this elementalist in front of him was terrifyingly powerful!
