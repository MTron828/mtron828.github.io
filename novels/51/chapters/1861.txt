1862 Who’s Stronger Now?

Everyone held their breath and looked at the scene in front of them sluggishly.

The dagger that flew out of Qin Yu’s mind cut off Tong Haoyang’s primordial spirit. What kind of technique was this?

“Qin Yu… You can actually use your primordial spirit to fight?” someone seemed to have reacted to the situation and exclaimed.

How terrifying was Qin Yu’s primordial spirit that it could form a dagger and directly cut the opponent’s primordial spirit?

He looked at Qin Yu again. He was circulating his Meridian Circulation Technique to restore his body.

Tong Haoyang finally let out a wail of pain after he reacted.

He held his head and looked like he was in extreme pain!

“Qin Yu, you…” Tong Haoyang was enraged and stared at Qin Yu.

Cutting off half of his primordial spirit meant his primordial spirit and foundation were damaged. His future cultivation would also be tremendously restricted.

Tong Haoyang, who had thought that he had the potential to enter tribulation, had his primordial spirit severed. Even if he survived, he would not have a bright future. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “It seems my control over my primordial spirit is still too poor. However, my experiment has succeeded.”

After hearing what Qin Yu said, the people around him were even more shocked.

Experiment? Did Qin Yu carry out an experiment just now? Did he use such a battle for an experiment?

“Isn’t this brat afraid of dying here?” someone exclaimed.

“Obviously, all of us have underestimated Qin Yu,” the peak master said in a deep voice.

The middle-aged man looked at the peak master, waiting for him to continue.

“All of us have thought that Qin Yu was lucky enough to survive and that his primordial spirit wasn’t injured,” the peak master said with a sigh. “But now it seems that everything is under his control.”

“That’s right. He could ensure he wouldn’t get hurt and calculated his opponent’s moves to the extreme,” Jiu Xiao also said.

The peak master then continued, “This is enough to prove that Qin Yu’s strength is far above Tong Haoyang’s. It’s like a cat toying with a mouse.”

Just as the peak Master and Jiu Xiao had said, Qin Yu did not take Tong Haoyang seriously at all.

His target was heaven’s favorite in Zhongzhou, the inheritor of the Immortal Emperor’s bloodline, and all kinds of abnormal physiques. Why would he care about Tong Haoyang?

Qin Yu’s body was slowly recovering under the circulation of the Meridian Circulation Technique.

With the help of the pill in Qin Yu’s hand, most of his damaged physical body soon recovered.

“Do you want to struggle on and suffer the cold shoulder for the rest of your life, or do you want me to kill you now?” Qin Yu said quietly.

To Tong Haoyang, these words were undoubtedly an unacceptable pain!

Every heaven’s favorite had the desire to be the best in the world, and Tong Haoyang was no exception.

Now that Qin Yu had destroyed his primordial spirit, this was undoubtedly worse than killing him!

“You, a vicious person…” Tong Haoyang’s face was ferocious. He didn’t even care about his pain and only glared at Qin Yu.

“You should have planned this before you came,” Qin Yu said coldly. “Although it does you good for you to die, I’m kind. I’ll send you off.”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s body once again glowed with golden light, like armor!

The light illuminated the entire sky and was extremely glaring!

Tong Haoyang, who had gone mad, naturally would not sit still and wait for death. After he roared, all of his spiritual power gathered toward his fist as if he wanted to give Qin Yu a fatal blow.

The glaring radiance seemed to indicate the terrifying power of his punch.

The entire space was collapsing continuously. Despite the protection of the secret treasure in the sky, the speed of the collapse was too fast. A large pitch-black void appeared.

The peak master knew that things were not looking good. This Tong Haoyang was clearly going to risk his life.

He quickly retreated with the others and bawled coldly, “The collision between these two will probably trigger a huge riot. Protect yourself!”

The group of people hurriedly retreated. They were afraid of being accidentally injured by the collision between the two.

“Qin Yu, go to hell!” Tong Haoyang was enraged to the extreme. Not only did he gather all of his spiritual power, but he also gathered all of his blood essences!

Tong Haoyang knew that he would most likely die here after this attack. But he couldn’t care less. Half of his primordial spirit had been severed, so he no longer had hope of living the rest of his life!

The punch was coming at Qin Yu’s face!

Void in large pieces fell off. The small Mystic Realm of the Martial Arts Hall seemed unable to withstand it!

Qin Yu looked at Tong Haoyang coldly. The golden light on his body intensified, and his fist became even more dazzling!

Just as the punch was about to land on Qin Yu, he made his move.

He raised his palm and grabbed Tong Haoyang’s fist right away.

The expected terrifying scene did not appear. Everything was calm and peaceful as if nothing had happened.

Tong Haoyang’s terrifying strength was grabbed by Qin Yu with one hand.

Everyone couldn’t help but be startled.

What was happening? Why was that punch that seemed to be able to topple mountains and overturn the seas so weak?

“You…” Tong Haoyang’s eyes were wide open as if he could not believe what he saw!

Qin Yu looked at Tong Haoyang coldly and said, “Do you still not understand? Even if we are all heaven’s favorites, there is still a huge difference between us. You are not even worth mentioning.”

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his left fist and punched Tong Haoyang’s mouth!

This was what Qin Yu had promised Chang Mang. He would definitely slap his mouth.

Under this punch, Tong Haoyang’s lower jaw was directly shattered, and blood stained his body.

Before he could react, Qin Yu threw another punch at him!

...

And the power of this punch was even more terrifying. It directly blasted half of Tong Haoyang’s body into dregs!

Looking at Tong Haoyang’s miserable state, everyone was silent.

They knew they had all underestimated Qin Yu’s ability.

Qin Yu didn’t stop there. He didn’t use any fancy moves, only his rough fists.

One punch after another, under Qin Yu’s Golden Fist, Tong Haoyang was on the verge of death in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu looked at Tong Haoyang coldly and grinned, “You and I have never been opponents of the same level. Do you understand?”

Tong Haoyang opened his mouth but couldn’t say a word.

“Now, between Si Shiyue and me, who do you think is stronger?” Qin Yu asked with his eyes narrowed.

Tong Haoyang glared at Qin Yu. He opened his mouth and said, “Qin Yu, you… d*mned b*stard! I…”

As he spoke, an extremely strange internal qi appeared on Tong Haoyang’s body. This internal qi contained an extremely terrifying power!

“You don’t have the right to self-destruct.” Qin Yu saw through his intention at a glance.

...

He reached out his hand and grabbed Tong Haoyang’s head!

In the next second, Qin Yu suddenly exerted his strength and directly crushed Tong Haoyang’s head and primordial spirit!
