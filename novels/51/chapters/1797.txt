1798 The Forbidden Zone

After returning to the cave abode, Qin Yu was not in a hurry to set off. Instead, he was planning meticulously.

If he couldn’t even safeguard his life, then it would be meaningless to Qin Yu.

“When are we setting off?” Jue Wu asked.

“Tomorrow,” Qin Yu said coldly.

It was not because of anything else but mainly because Qin Yu’s inner demons had begun to cause trouble.

If he didn’t quickly devour a primordial spirit the next day, he was afraid he would be completely controlled by the inner demons again.

At the same time, God Bless Sect and Tianyun Sect had started the battle for nearly 20 days.

For the past 20 days, both sides did not suffer heavy losses. God Bless Sect was retreating while fighting. They indeed did not go all out to fight Tianyun Sect.

On this day, an uninvited guest arrived at God Bless Sect.

This person was tall and imposing, and every step he took was full of extremely heavy sense of oppression.

Yao Yingxuan looked at the person in front of him and instantly had a bad feeling.

“You are…” Yao Yingxuan tried to remain calm as he asked.

“My name is Tong Yizhong,” the other party said coldly.

Upon hearing this surname, Yao Yingxuan understood everything.

It was obvious that the Tong family had really sent people over. And they had sent people from the family.

“Where’s Qin Yu?” Tong Yizhong asked coldly.

“No idea,” Yao Yingxuan was startled, shook his head, and said.

Tong Yizhong snorted and said, “Take me to Tianyun Sect.”

Yao Yingxuan’s face turned even uglier. He quickly said, “Xiao Sheng is not simple. He is extremely powerful. He once killed a Reversion Void Stage cultivator at the Mighty Realm. He had also killed Yuan Xiu from North Plain. Shouldn’t you plan ahead?”

Tong Yizhong glanced at Yao Yingxuan and said coldly, “It’s just Lizhou. What kind of experts and plans should there be? Do I need a plan to stomp an ant to death?”

Yao Yingxuan gritted his teeth and continued, “It’s best for you to be careful. You must not underestimate Xiao Sheng…”

Tong Yizhong snorted and flipped his palm. An eight-trigram mirror fell into his hand.

The moment he took out the eight trigram mirror, traces of Holy Power was spreading.

Under this Holy Power, even an expert like Yao Yingxuan couldn’t help but tremble!

A Saint Weapon!

This Tong Yizhong had directly brought a Saint Weapon over!

It seemed that the Tong family was really serious this time!

“Do I still need to wait?” Tong Yizhong said coldly.

Yao Yingxuan’s face turned ugly as he said, “Senior… Senior Tong, you’ve traveled a long way. Why are you in such a hurry? Why don’t you rest for a day, and we’ll set off tomorrow…”

“I’ll kill you first if you keep talking nonsense,” Tong Yizhong said with a gloomy face.

Yao Yingxuan’s face slightly changed. He didn’t dare to say anything else. So he could only bite the bullet and agree.

Before he left, Yao Yingxuan found a trustworthy person.

“Immediately go to Nanzhou to find Xiao Sheng. Tell him the Tong family has sent someone with a Saint Weapon. Tell him to quickly escape!” Yao Yingxuan coldly said.

The other party frowned and said, “Sect Master, with my ability, I’m afraid it’ll be very difficult for me to arrive before you…”

Yao Yingxuan took a deep breath and said, “I’ll do my best to stall him.”

After hearing this, the other party did not say anything else. He immediately hurried up and set off for Nanzhou.

Yao Yingxuan clasped his hands behind his back and looked at the sky.

He sighed and said in a low voice, “Xiao Hai, I’ve already returned the favor…”

…

The following day.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu got up and left the cave abode.

Guided by the peak master, they came to an array platform.

The array platform was huge and grand. Compared to the Ancient Array Platform and Tianyun Sect’s array platform, this array platform was considered luxurious.

At a glance, an extremely sacred internal qi was permeating the air. Dense runes were carved in every direction of the platform. Each rune had an extremely mysterious power.

Rumor had it that these runes were taken from the Path of Heaven. Relying on these runes, one could sense the Great Dao. And from there, it created a formation that could cross the void.

“Qin Yu, you’re here not for long but you dare to go to the Crimson Moon Continent. Not bad, not bad at all!” the peak master patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said excitedly.

But Qin Yu was smiling bitterly in his heart.

“D*mn it! If I knew it would be so dangerous, I wouldn’t have wanted to go to the Crimson Moon Continent!” thought Qin Yu.

“When you’re back, I’ll hold a celebration banquet for you!” the peak master said with a smile.

“Thank you, Peak Master,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

After saying this, Qin Yu and Jue Wu went to the array platform.

“Peak Master, can this array platform also bring us to Zhongzhou?” Qin Yu shouted before the platform was activated.

“Of course, it can,” the peak master said. “This platform can go to any place in the Holy Region.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu nodded and did not say anything else.

After that, a Formation Master started to activate the array formation.

Rays of light lit up in every corner of the array platform.

Every ray of light shot straight into the sky.

The light was getting brighter. Soon a vast expanse of whiteness was in front of Qin Yu’s eyes.

He could feel his body rapidly shuttling through the air, but he could not see anything clearly.

After about half an hour, the surroundings finally returned to normal.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu landed on the ground steadily.

When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was the dazzling sun. The whole world seemed to have turned yellow.

Not far away, there were many cities and each was guarded by people.

“This is the Crimson Moon continent.” Qin Yu said.

Jue Wu found the coordinates and said, “Hurry up. Let’s set off.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“No,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “If he has a Saint Weapon, I’m afraid we’ll die a horrible death.”

“Then what should we do?” Jue Wu frowned and said.

“Let’s investigate first. It won’t be too late to make a move after making sure he doesn’t have a Saint Weapon,” Qin Yu said coldly.

This place was not far from the coordinates given by the mission. It was about three cities away.

The target’s name was Yang Yu. He was a powerful Reversion Void Stage cultivator.

He wasn’t old, only about 300 years old. He could be considered a heaven’s favorite.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu didn’t know much about the Crimson Moon Continent. Thus they could only rush to their destination on foot.

On the way, Qin Yu released his divine sense to sense the people nearby.

Soon Qin Yu detected many Reversion Void Stage cultivators. There were even a few who Qin Yu could not see through their strength.

“It seems that the Crimson Moon Continent is extremely powerful,” thought Qin Yu.

Jue Wu also nodded slightly. She wrinkled her little nose and said, “I can feel a strong sense of oppression. This feeling makes me feel very uncomfortable.”

The two had been walking for a long time. Under the scorching sun, they also seemed a little tired.

After a long time, the two finally arrived at the foot of a city.

The city was called Heavenly Ocean City. It was extremely large and was surrounded by a dazzling mountain protection formation that prevented anyone from entering.
