Chapter 2680: The Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

An ancient internal qi of the endless abyss suddenly came from the black hole. Even the attacks from the black hole were filled with the smell of age.

The Tiger Wing in Qin Yu’s hand slashed at the black lotus like it had hit a quagmire.

The power of the endless abyss collided with the source of the Order of Destruction.

The power of the Order of Destruction didn’t have an advantage.

“Retreat! Other than the elders, all inner sect disciples, and commoners should retreat to the periphery of the Demon Sealing Valley!

The moment the energy spread, even Gu Tian felt as if his sea of consciousness was being torn apart.

At this moment, the storm covered a radius of 1,000 meters. The people inside were all at a loss when they faced this collision storm.

Even the chief inner disciple of the Demon Sealing Valley was so powerless, not to mention ordinary people.

At this moment, a beam of light swept up the area where Hua Tian and Qin Yu were fighting, separating the space where they were fighting.

“Saint Kingdom’s Book of the Earth! Valley Master Dan is here!”

Some of the disciples who were caught in the storm suddenly felt the power of the earth surging out.

The dense power of the earth blocked the storm of battle. After seeing that they were safe, they could not help but roar excitedly. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Before the battle, no one would have thought that the battle between two True Consciousness outsiders would cause the Demon Sealing Valley to fall into such a dangerous situation.

“Wu Tian’s twelfth-grade Black Lotus of Annihilation. I can’t believe Hua Tian is related to Wu Tian.”

Dan was holding an old Book of the Earth in his hand. His face was very ugly at the moment.

The person they had appointed had already joined the mortal enemy of the Demon Sealing Valley, the strongest devil suppressed by the Ancient Demon Land, Wu Tian.

“What a powerful force! How did Wu Tian’s power suddenly increase to this extent?”

Sensing the extremely terrifying internal qi of the black lotus, even Dan felt his heart shatter.

Wu Tian had been suppressed in the Ancient Demon Land just because he had lost an arm and the maximum power of Saint Kingdom.

Only in that way could the Demon Sealing Valley suppress him. What Dan didn’t know was that Wu Tian had gotten another arm from the Emerald Serpent Witch, which boosted his power.

If he was not careful with the power, he could destroy the Demon Sealing Valley.

“Valley Master, what are you waiting for? Let’s kill this demon’s subordinate together.”

Gu Yi’s face was filled with rage.

Over the years, countless people from the Demon Sealing Valley had died in the Ancient Demon Land.

This bloody feud had already seeped deep into their bones.

“Ring the Dao bell and order all the elders to come. I can sense Wu Tian’s power now.”

Dan’s expression was very ugly. The twelfth -grade black lotus in front of him was only a clone.

At this moment, the real enemy had already arrived outside the Demon Sealing Valley. He was also paying attention to this battle.

The Dao bell sound spread throughout the entire Demon Sealing Valley.

At this moment, all the elders in seclusion in the Demon Sealing Valley opened their eyes when they heard the sound of the bell and rushed towards it.

Even Xin Yue who was in seclusion due to Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly’s backlash, did not hesitate to come out.

The ringing of the Dao bell meant that the Demon Sealing Valley had entered a state of life and death.

Outside the Demon Sealing Valley, the dark forces seemed to have received some kind of order. Countless ancient demons surrounded the Demon Sealing Valley in all directions.

Terrifying demonic qi was brewing above the Demon Sealing Valley.

The air was filled with terrifying demonic sounds. Some strange laughter that made people go crazy even made their hair stand on end.

For the first time in thousands of years, the Demon Sealing Valley was facing such a phenomenon.

Wu Tian sat on the twelfth-grade black lotus with his eyes closed.

All of a sudden, the black lotus lit up. A surge of power surged into his body from the black lotus.

As he pointed out, the power of his finger touched the light of the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth. Violent fluctuations appeared, but they did not break through.

“The Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth, a book that can absorb the power of the entire Saint Kingdom’s land. It’s indeed not simple.”

Wu Tian opened his eyes and smiled strangely.

There were two types of magical artifacts in the Saint Kingdom. One was derived from the Saint Kingdom, whereas the other was brought from elsewhere.

For example, the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth was a supreme treasure of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. It was forged from the kingdom’s earth membrane and could unleash its greatest power in this Saint Kingdom.

“What terrifying power!”

After the attack, the faces of everyone in the Demon Sealing Valley changed.

One had to know that this was the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. The power of the Sacred Kingdom’s Book of the Earth could be said to be endless.

However, Wu Tian’s twelfth-grade Black Lotus of Annihilation had put them under immense pressure. One could imagine how powerful he was.

“It doesn’t matter. The Book of Earth will be able to absorb the power of the Saint Kingdom’s land from afar as long as we hold on unless Wu Tian wants to fight to the death.”

Dan’s face was cold and stern as he stared at Wu Tian outside the Demon Sealing Valley.

“Buddha Wu Tian, do you need me to lead the ancient demons to attack the Demon Sealing Valley and exhaust the power of the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth?”

Pang De asked.

“It’s fine. These ancient demons can’t break the power of the Saint Kingdom’s Book of Earth for now. Moreover, this isn’t an urgent matter. I have to settle the matter I owe Emerald Serpent Witch here.”

Wu Tian said calmly. He could sense that his Black Lotus of Annihilation clone had been used by Hua Tian. He narrowed his eyes.

The black lotus clone sent out an internal qi. The battle between Hua Tian and Qin Yu already appeared in Wu Tian’s sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu’s saber technique was like the wind. At this moment, every slash of his saber carried the terrifying power of the Order of Destruction.

Even when faced with the terrifying power of the twelfth-grade black lotus, the wind-like saber qi suppressed the endless abyss that the black lotus had created. It even gradually retreated.

“You should have consumed a pill that increases your potential, right? This is the first time I’ve seen such heaven-defying power.”

Hua Tian’s face turned pale. This power had far exceeded his strength.

If Wu Tian’s black lotus clone had not shown up, he would have been drowned by the endless saber energy in an instant.

“However, the more heaven-defying the effect, the more severe the consequences you will have to bear. You will die in today’s battle.”

Hua Tian saw that although Qin Yu’s saber energy was fierce, it could not break through Wu Tian’s twelfth-grade Black Lotus of Annihilation clone. He breathed a sigh of relief. If it were not for Wu Tian, he would have died here today.

“Meeting Wu Tian is also part of my cosmic luck.”

Hua Tian shouted and Prajna was unsheathed again like a dragon. In an instant, sword light burst out.

The black lotus did not need him to activate it. He only needed to do his best to activate his strength and cause trouble for Qin Yu.

Such a terrifying increase in strength could no longer be explained by an epiphany breakthrough.

Even the Explosive Blood Pill that he had come into contact with was simply

incomparable..
