Chapter 279: Yan Jiang’s True Strength Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When he saw this familiar figure, Qin Yu’s face couldn’t help but flash with surprise.

“Yan Jiang?” Qin Yu stared blankly at the man in front of him.

Yan Jiang glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Move to the side.”

Qin Yu said with some worry, “These three are all peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters. I’m afraid it’s difficult for you to fight them alone.”

After saying that, golden light lit up on Qin Yu’s body as he quickly stood at the side of Yan Jiang.

After sensing Qin Yu’s internal qi, Yan Jiang said with a nonchalant smile, “You’ve improved quite a bit.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “At this time, don’t say such useless things.”

Yan Jiang put his hands behind his back and said coldly, “Step aside. If anything happens, Miss Yan won’t forgive me.”

“As for these three people, they’re not a threat.”

As he spoke, the internal qi on Yan Jiang’s body suddenly burst out!

The powerful internal qi actually forced Qin Yu back a few steps!

This caused Qin Yu’s expression to change dramatically!

Yan Jiang’s strength... was actually this terrifying?

How easy did he go on him before...

The expressions of the three people couldn’t help but change.

They looked at Yan Jiang coldly and said with some vigilance, “Who are you?”

“You don’t need to know,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

“All in all, you have barged into Pyro today, and you will die here.” Yan Jiang stepped out, and the ground was immediately dented!

Qin Yu’s facial expression changed dramatically, and he was shocked to the extreme!

Obviously, Yan Jiang’s strength was far beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

The three people became more and more intimidated. They didn’t expect Qin Yu to have such a powerful martial artist on his side. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“We were presumptuous and we’ll leave now.” The three people actually had the intention to retreat.

After saying this, the three of them turned to leave.

However, Yan Jiang waved his hand!

A huge tree that was as thick as two people’s arms suddenly collapsed! It blocked their way!

“I said, since you guys are here, you guys can’t leave,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

The three of them seemed to be a little angry. They looked at Yan Jiang coldly and said, “We’re all peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters. If we really fight, you might not be our match. Why are you so aggressive?”

“Is that so? Then come and try!” Yan Jiang didn’t waste his breath. With a shake of his feet, his body disappeared into thin air!

The speed was so fast that Qin Yu was dumbstruck!

There was even an afterimage of Yan Jiang left on the spot!

“Bang!”

At such a fast speed, the three of them couldn’t react in time either. One of them was pierced through the chest by Yan Jiang! Blood was dripping down!

“Don’t think that we are afraid of you!” The three of them were instantly enraged, and all their spells were activated! The entire villa was buzzing!

Yan Jiang didn’t say anything. With a light step, a formation actually appeared in front of him!

Within this formation, Yan Jiang was like a deity. With a retreat of his palm, a formation of energy burst out.

One against three, Yan Jiang wasn’t at a disadvantage at all. He even had the upper hand!

Standing not far away, Qin Yu was even more shocked.

The strength of the Yan family’s personal bodyguard was indeed beyond his imagination!

“Boom!”

At this moment, Yan Jiang raised his palm, and streams of inner strength condensed in the air.

A moment later, it actually turned into a huge mountain!

The huge mountain crashed down, and the three people were immediately shaken until they vomited blood continuously!

The three assassins of the Hong Yi Sect had ugly expressions. They looked at each other, and then the three people formed a seal at the same time!

“Ten Thousand Buddha Claws!”

As the three of them roared, a huge hand appeared in front of them!

The huge hand turned into a claw and grabbed at Yan Jiang!

“This is just a small trick that’s not worth mentioning,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

Then, they saw Yan Jiang’s palm reach forward, and he muttered in a low voice, “Nine Heavens Divine Palm!”

He used his palm to receive the claw, and he didn’t take the three people from the Hong Yi Sect seriously at all!

“Boom!”

The collision of the two techniques caused a huge shock!

A terrifying internal qi spread out from both sides!

Under this collision, even Qin Yu was forced back a few meters! White marks appeared on his body one after another!

“Phew!”

The three of them were ultimately not Yan Jiang’s match. They were forced back dozens of steps before they spat out a mouthful of blood and collapsed onto the ground!

Yan Jiang didn’t stop there. He didn’t even give them a chance to speak!

Yan Jiang raised his hand and a huge sharp blade appeared out of thin air above the three of them!

“Slash!”

Yan Jiang roared and the sharp blade slashed towards the three of them at an extremely fast speed!

“Puchi!”

The three of them didn’t even have the time to resist before their bodies were sliced into two!

Fresh blood splattered all over the courtyard.

At a glance, it was like a living h*ll.

Yan Jiang raised his foot and shook it lightly. The formation under his feet slowly disappeared.

Everything returned to normal. There were only three more corpses.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel some lingering fear. He recalled the first time he fought with Yan Jiang.

If Yan Jiang had unleashed his full strength against him, Qin Yu would have died a long time ago.

“Are you okay?”

At this moment, Yan Jiang turned around and looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu quickly shook his head and said, “I’m fine. Thank you.”

Qin Yu knew inside that Yan Jiang had always looked down on him, so he didn’t deliberately approach him.

“What? I helped you kill three enemies. Shouldn’t you treat me to a drink?”

However, Yan Jiang’s words stunned Qin Yu.

Was this still the same Yan Jiang from before? Didn’t he always look down on him?

“Of course. Please come in.” Qin Yu came back to his senses and said politely.

“Wait for me to deal with these three corpses first.” Yan Jiang raised his hand and walked forward. Then, he stretched out his palm and the three corpses disappeared into thin air.

This spell surprised Qin Yu somewhat.

“How did you do this?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Yan Jiang shook his wristband and said, “Spatial Magic Artifact.”

“Spatial Magic Artifact?” Qin Yu’s eyes instantly lit up.

This was a treasure! Although Spatial Magic Artifacts weren’t worth mentioning in the divine cultivation world, in the human world, they were top-tier treasures!

“You like it?” Yan Jiang raised his eyebrows and asked.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m afraid that no one doesn’t like this kind of sacred thing.”

Yan Jiang immediately took off the bracelet and threw it to Qin Yu.

“If you like it, I’ll give it to you,” Yan Jiang said somewhat casually.

Qin Yu was stunned. He hurriedly returned the bracelet to Yan Jiang and shook his head repeatedly. “No, it’s too valuable. Moreover, you saved my life. I should thank you.”

“Take it. Miss Yan will reimburse me,” Yan Jiang said.

Miss Yan was naturally referring to Yan Ruoxue.

This also made Qin Yu realize the gap between him and the Yan family more clearly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but force a laugh.

His road of cultivation was long. It wasn’t easy to catch up with the Yan family. To be worthy of Yan Ruoxue was like ascending to the heavens.

In the room, Qin Yu took out a bottle of wine and poured it for Yan Jiang. He also poured himself another glass.

Yan Jiang took a sip of wine and then looked up at Qin Yu.

“If you have anything you want to ask, just ask now, only for today,” Yan Jiang said nonchalantly.

Qin Yu was stunned and hurriedly said, “Really?”

He desperately wanted to know everything about the Yan family. It was just that he didn’t have the chance.

And Yan Jiang, as Yan Yunheng’s bodyguard, knew the Yan family like the back of his hand!
