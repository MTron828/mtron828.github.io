1868 Battle Against Tong Lianyang

Tong Lingyang stood up slowly and said with a cold face, “Demon-slaying Peak doesn’t represent Thunder Courtyard. They can’t shake up my Tong family!”

In the next second, with a slight stomp of his feet, Tong Lianyang brought Uncle Guan and Tong Guangqing to the battlefield.

Tong Lianyang clasped his hands behind his back. Looking at the bloodshed in the Tong family, a trace of hostility flashed across his eyes.

He raised his hands, and a terrifying power instantly gathered in his hands.

Following that, Tong Lianyang fiercely pressed his palms downward.

“Boom!”

The entire land of the Tong family sank in further at this moment!

The powerful force made everyone freeze in place.

The battlefield fell into silence. Everyone looked in the direction of Tong Lianyang.

He was an extremely terrifying elderly man. Even though the internal qi on his body was incredibly calm, it carried a strong sense of oppression, and no one dared to ignore it.

Tong Lianyang had lived for thousands of years, and his strength had reached a terrifying level.

Given sufficient time, he could enter the Semi-Saint cultivation realm!

Tong Lianyang’s eyes swept across the crowd, and he said indifferently, “Who is attacking my Tong family?”

“Mr. Tong, I don’t think you need to play dumb,” Qin Yu took a step forward and shouted. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Tong Lianyang ignored Qin Yu and continued, “Who is Qin Yu?”

“I am,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Tong Lianyang looked at Qin Yu and said, “You dare to attack my Tong family at such a young age. The young generation is really respectable.”

“I didn’t mean to be your Tong family’s enemy,” Qin Yu said coldly. “It was your Tong family who bullied me first and took my friend away.”

“So?” Tong Lianyang said without raising his eyes.

“So you have to die. You have to pay the price for your actions.” Qin Yu’s answer was concise and comprehensive, but extraordinary.

“Just you?” Tong Lianyang laughed.

“Just me.” Qin Yu took a step forward in neither an overbearing nor self-effacing manner.

Tong Lianyang’s expression gradually turned cold.

“You killed dozens of my Tong family’s people. How should we settle this?” he said slowly.

“Settle your a*s! You settle yourself!” Chang Mang roared, hurting everyone’s ear.

Tong Lianyang’s gaze fell on Chang Mang.

He wasn’t angry, and only said indifferently, “Extremely primitive thoughts and vocabulary. You’re not qualified to talk to me.”

“F*ck you! Old b*stard! What are you pretending?” Chang Mang took a step forward, and his body glowed with red light.

Tong Lianyang stopped paying attention to Chang Mang. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “You killed Tong Haoyang?”

“That’s right. I smashed his head with one punch,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“It seems like you do have some skills,” Tong Lianyang said with a faint smile. “You do live up to your reputation as the chaotic body. How about this? You take over Tong Haoyang’s position, and I’ll teach you everything I’ve learned in my life. How about that? ”

“Sorry, I’m not interested,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Then what do you want?” Tong Lianyang squinted his eyes and asked.

“Sending you off,” Qin Yu said coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s body was already exuding a monstrous killing intent!

“From the moment you attacked Jue Wu, you were already dead.” Qin Yu’s voice became even colder.

“If that’s the case, I’ll have to kill you,” Tong Lianyang sighed.

After he finished speaking, Tong Lianyang arrived in front of Qin Yu. A great battle was about to start!

Tong Lianyang’s moves were extremely unique. Each of his movements seemed to be powerless, but it actually contained incredibly terrifying power. Even Qin Yu was forced to retreat for a moment.

This old fellow was a living fossil. The techniques he controlled were countless and even wondrous. Sometimes, he would hold a huge seal, and sometimes, he would engage in close combat. The changes in his moves were shocking!

Tong Lianyang was indeed the head of the Tong family. Each of his attacks seemed to be merging with the unique dao techniques of the Tong family. Every single punch of his contained a power that could destroy the world. They were all killing techniques!

The battle between the two almost resulted in the already dilapidated Tong family becoming ruins. The earth rumbled, and light continuously flashed in the sky. Their speed was also extremely fast.

Tong Lianyang was equally shocked. This was the Tong family, his home ground.

The ancestor of the Tong family had set up a secret technique here. Tong Lianyang could use the Tong family’s natural dao technique to fight Qin Yu.

But even so, Qin Yu was not at a disadvantage.

This was enough to show that Qin Yu’s strength was far above Tong Haoyang’s!

“As expected of the chaotic body. Given time, he might be able to compete with the one from the Si family!” Tong Lianyang was getting more shocked!

Without the support of the Tong family’s secret technique, he might not be Qin Yu’s match today!

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu shouted and threw a punch that contained anger and extreme battle intent!

Tong Lianyang knew how terrifying the chaotic body was. Thus he naturally wouldn’t receive it.

He placed his finger on his mouth and mumbled something. In an instant, a mysterious river suddenly rose and filled the sky, completely submerging Qin Yu!

Tong Lianyang looked in Qin Yu’s direction with a cold gaze and muttered in a low voice, “Heavenly River Seal!”

In an instant, the great river rolled into a seal and slammed toward Qin Yu fiercely!

...

Qin Yu looked at Tong Lianyang coldly and shouted angrily, “I’m not afraid of any spells!”

He reached out his palm, and Golden Light turned into a divine sword slashing forward!

It was a divine sword formed by Qin Yu’s dao techniques. It was a technique that he had comprehended when he fought with Yuan Xiu. It was also extremely terrifying!

Compared to the superficial understanding of Yuan Xiu, Qin Yu appeared to be more mature. The divine sword slashed and cut the Heavenly River Seal into two!

Tong Lianyang snorted coldly. Once again, he silently chanted the spell. Suddenly, a few huge hands rose from the ground and slapped Qin Yu!

Qin Yu was still fearless. His body suddenly shook, and he raised his terrifying vision!

It was also a large golden hand, and all of the visions had transformed into this large hand. Its power was terrifyingly powerful!

The collision between the palms split the Tong family land into two, causing a loud boom!

And Tong Lianyang was forced to take a few steps back. His qi and blood were already running low, and soon he was exhausted under this great battle.

Faced with the young, strong, and vigorous Qin Yu, Tong Lianyang began to feel powerless.

Qin Yu seized the opportunity and punched out thirty-eight times in the blink of an eye, each could destroy mountains and rivers!

...

Finally, Tong Lianyang was forced to retreat. A huge bloody hole was created on the left side of his body!

“Father!”

Seeing this, Tong Guangqing’s expression changed and he could not help but cry out in panic!

Tong Lianyang wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said slowly, “Are all chaotic bodies so outstanding?”

Qin Yu didn’t want to listen to his bullsh*t. He shouted with his body full of battle intent, “Tong Lianyang, today is the day you die!”
