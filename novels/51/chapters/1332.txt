Chapter 1333: Chapter 1333, shattered with a single punch 

That punch contained the power to destroy the heavens and earth. It smashed towards Ling Yun’s face in an instant!

“Bang!”

This punch landed squarely on Ling Yun’s face.

The protective magical artifact that appeared on Ling Yun’s face didn’t even last half a second. The moment it appeared, it was shattered!

His face was instantly split open, and his entire body shot back hundreds of meters!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. With a jolt of his feet, he quickly chased after him.

The surrounding people widened their eyes in shock!

What happened just now? Why was Ling Yun sent flying in just a second?

“You... did you guys see clearly? How did Ling Yun fly backwards in an instant?”

“Could it be some kind of spell? There’s actually such a strange spell?”

“That must be it! I saw a flash of red on Ling Yun’s face just now. That must be the color of the spell!”

“... that’s obviously blood!”Finally, someone couldn’t hold it in anymore and pulled out the emperor’s novelty.

The scene was completely silent. In reality, they were also suspicious, but they didn’t want to believe it.

After all, Ling Yun was known as the number one genius in the southern province. How could he be sent flying with a single punch!

Wan ‘er and Ah San were even more shocked. Wan ‘er covered her small mouth and her beautiful eyes were wide open. Even though she was born in a big family, she couldn’t remain calm.

As for Ah San, he shivered and couldn’t help but feel a lingering fear.

If Qin Yu had really used her full strength last night, he wouldn’t have been any better than Ling Yun.

Qin Yu quickly chased after Ling Yun. At this moment, Ling Yun was already lying on the ground in a near-death state.

His face bone had been shattered, and it was almost impossible to tell what he looked like.

However, he still managed to catch his breath. Even though his voice wasn’t loud, it was clear to the ears.

Qin Yu looked down at Ling Yun and said coldly, “Not bad, as expected of the treasure of the Tianyun sect. This punch actually didn’t die.”

Ling Yun panted heavily. He tried to get up, but his injuries were too severe.

“Alright, I’ll give you another punch,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Stop!”

At this moment, Ling Yun’s follower caught up quickly.

He stood in front of Qin Yu and said coldly, “Qin Yu, stop right now. Ling Yun is the first Elder’s disciple. If you kill him, the first elder will not let you off!”

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and said with a sneer, “Don’t worry. After I kill Ling Yun, you will be next.”

Since he had to do it, he might as well get rid of the root of the problem so as not to attract unnecessary trouble.

“Qin Yu, do you really have to be so ruthless? I don’t believe that you really dare to kill Young Master Ling,”the attendant said coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and said, “Then you can just watch from the side obediently.”

Just as Qin Yu was about to throw another punch, the attendant couldn’t hold it in any longer.

His aura surged explosively, and rays of extremely resplendent light condensed around his body.

Each ray of light gushed out like a fountain, actually merging with the space.

In the next second, this light pulled the surrounding space, intending to trap Qin Yu. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Petty tricks.”Qin Yu snorted coldly, and only responded with an iron fist!

Qin Yu did not have any gorgeous moves, but only powerful divine power and that indestructible body!

The golden light of his right fist shone, and endless divine power exploded out in an instant, shattering the follower’s spell!

Pieces of space fell out, revealing large patches of pitch-black color.

The attendant’s expression changed, and he quickly retreated.

“Heaven and Earth Emperor Force!”

Hearing his furious roar, there was actually power surging into his body from heaven and earth!

“As expected of someone from the Heavenly Cloud Sect,”Qin Yu said coldly.

However, he still did not panic. He only raised his right hand to block in front of him.

“Clang!”

With a clear and loud sound, the Heaven and Earth Emperor Force collided with Qin Yu’s right hand.

At the moment of contact, the force dissipated instantly.

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s right hand was actually undamaged!

What kind of physical body was this? It ignored the spells of a mighty figure!

Qin Yu looked at his right hand and could not help but feel a little smug in his heart.

“After I devour enough life Qi, my entire body will possess this kind of physical body,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

In addition to his various body cultivation techniques, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that his physical body was invincible!

The Almighty in midair was looking at Qin Yu nervously.

He was extremely conflicted. If he fought, he wasn’t Qin Yu’s match. If he ran, Ling Yun would definitely die. At that time, the first elder wouldn’t let him off either.

“Rather than go back and die, I might as well die in battle!”The attendant roared angrily and charged towards Qin Yu once again!

Qin Yu looked at him coldly before his right fist flashed with light. In the next second, Qin Yu’s gaze landed on Ling Yun!

He wanted to ignore the attendant’s attack and kill Ling Yun!

“Terrifying, too terrifying!”The surrounding people didn’t dare to believe this scene.

The two almighty experts were actually unable to do anything to Qin Yu!

Most importantly, Qin Yu didn’t rely on spiritual energy at all. Instead, he relied purely on his physical body!

“Such a physical body is probably not weaker than those ferocious beasts! !”

“From today onwards, the name Qin Yu will probably spread throughout the entire southern continent!”
