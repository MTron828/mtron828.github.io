“Trash? Who are you calling trash?” Han Yilong, his expression livid, glared at Zhang Hua.

Zhang Hua’s expression immediately changed!

Han Yilong was also an Inner Strength Master Hands! He had forgotten about this!

Thinking of this, Zhang Hua hurriedly changed his words and said, “Young Master Han, how can Qin Yu compare to you? You two are both Inner Strength Master Hands, but you are a member of the Han family! Your strength is definitely above Qin Yu’s!”

“As for Qin Yu, he is just a worm living in the gutter. Comparing him to you is tarnishing you!”

Zhang Hua was indeed good at flattery.

Han Yilong’s expression softened a lot.

“Young Master Han, don’t worry. Leave this kid to me!” Zhang Hua patted his chest and said.

Zhang Hua’s body was full of murderous intent. Obviously, he wanted to show off in front of Han Yilong and take advantage of this opportunity to establish good relations with him.

Qin Yu didn’t panic. He looked coldly at Zhang Hua with the intention to make a move.

“Wait.”

At this moment, Fang Yue suddenly walked out with a smile.

She first walked in front of Han Yilong and bowed slightly. “Greetings, Young Master Han.”

Han Yilong looked at Fang Yue and his eyes immediately widened!

Updates by

She was too beautiful!

Fang Yue was completely different from those flirtatious b * tches that he had messed around with before! She was simply irresistible!

Han Yilong swallowed hard and his eyes wandered around Fang Yue’s body.

If there weren’t so many people, Han Yilong would have pounced on her long ago!

“Miss Fang, what’s the matter?” Zhang Hua asked.

Fang Yue ignored Zhang Hua and said with a smile, “Young Master Han, Qin Yu is only an Inner Strength Master Hands, and you are also an Inner Strength Master Hands.”

“Moreover... the powerful background of the Han family isn’t something that Qin Yu can compare to.”

“As the young master of the Han family, your cultivation technique is naturally far superior to Qin Yu’s. Why should you let a servant do it?”

Zhang Hua’s expression darkened!

Fang Yue actually called him a servant?

Han Yilong touched his chin and said with a smile, “Miss Fang, your words make sense.”

“Young Master.” The two old men beside him hurriedly took a step forward, as if they were a little worried.

However, in order to show off in front of Fang Yue, Han Yilong waved his hand and said indifferently, “As a member of the Han family, I’m pretty much invincible among people of the same level!”

“I can kill Qin Yu with a flip of my wrist!” Han Yilong said proudly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but want to laugh.

Han Yilong actually wanted to do it himself?

An Inner Strength Master Hands probably didn’t even have the chance to fight back in front of Qin Yu!

The surrounding people also looked at the two with interest.

“Qin Yu’s strength isn’t worth mentioning. He might not be a match for Han Yilong.” Duan Shi snorted lightly.

Jing Lu didn’t say anything. He just looked at the two quietly.

“Kid, just do as Miss Fang said. I will deal with you personally,” Han Yilong said coldly.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Are you sure? Just you? An Inner Strength Master Hands?”

“Yes, just me!” Han Yilong roared angrily. He clenched his fist and swung it toward Qin Yu with a whoosh!

Two spikes of inner strength condensed on Han Yilong’s fists! It seemed like they were going to pierce through Qin Yu’s chest!

Qin Yu, a mocking smile on his face, stood there without moving at all.

This smile infuriated Han Yilong even more!

“You’re courting death!” Han Yilong roared again! His entire fist was instantly filled with dense needles!

“Bang!”

This needle pierced into Qin Yu’s chest fiercely!

Qin Yu didn’t dodge, and just stood there!

“Kacha!”

There was a crisp sound!

The needle on Han Yilong’s fist broke!

On the other hand, Qin Yu had his hands behind his back and was unharmed!

“It seems that the young master of the Han family isn’t that impressive.” Qin Yu sneered.

Han Yilong’s expression was a bit ugly.

He lowered his head to look at his fist and whispered, “How is this possible! We are both Inner Strength Master Hands. He definitely can’t beat me!”

“Young Master Han, this kid’s body is a bit strange. Don’t get too close to him!” Zhang Hua hurriedly said.

“Whoosh”

A gentle breeze blew past, and the expression on Han Yilong’s expression became a bit ferocious.

His hands slowly moved in the air, and the surrounding trees also began to move.

Endless spiritual energy from all directions actually gathered toward Han Yilong!

“As expected of the Han family, their techniques are indeed extraordinary!” Qin Yu sighed!

To be able to borrow the spiritual energy from nature was definitely not something an ordinary martial artist could do.

Spiritual energy gathered in Han Yilong’s palm, and along with his furious roar, Han Yilong’s hands gathered above his head!

Then, Han Yilong’s hands condensed into a circular plate!

The circular disk grew bigger and bigger until it was like a huge wheel!

“Kid, I’ll let you know what the legacy of an aristocratic family is!” Han Yilong roared angrily!

“Boom!”

Han Yilong’s hands pressed forward, and a surge of spiritual energy was pressing on Qin Yu’s head!

Qin Yu’s expression was calm, but he still didn’t have the intention to attack.

Han Yilong’s expression lit up with joy, and he sneered. “You’re dead meat!”

“Boom!”

The huge disc smashed onto Qin Yu’s body!

The scene was instantly filled with dust, and even trees were uprooted!

“As expected of someone from the Han family. Although it’s just a side branch, its resources are far beyond what we can imagine,” someone murmured.

The strength that Han Yilong displayed had far surpassed that of an Inner Strength Master Hands!

Even an Inner Strength Past Master might pale in comparison!

This also made many martial artists feel a sense of despair.

The gap between them was definitely not something that could be surpassed in a single generation!

The dust began to slowly dissipate, and everyone stared in Qin Yu’s direction.

“This is it?”

At this moment, a mocking voice came from the dust.

Everyone’s expression immediately changed!

They saw Qin Yu standing there motionlessly, and Han Yilong’s attack actually didn’t have the slightest effect!

“How is this possible?!” Han Yilong’s expression changed!

Qin Yu wasn’t affected at all? Was he really an Inner Strength Master Hands?

“This kid’s physical body is so abnormal?”

“Even I wouldn’t be able to emerge unscathed.”

“Could it be that Qin Yu is a body refiner?”

Everyone was discussing with shock on their faces.

“Huh? That shouldn’t be.” Duan Shi, who wasn’t far away, also frowned slightly.

“He couldn’t even take a punch from me just now. Why does he seem like a different person now?”

Jing Lu narrowed his eyes and said, “Could it be that he was deliberately hiding his strength?”

Han Yilong’s expression was a little awkward.

He had failed to hurt Qin Yu two moves in a row.

This was simply a disgrace to the Han family!

Just as Han Wei was about to give up, Fang Yue, who was at the side, suddenly smiled and said, “Young Master Han, don’t hide your strength. We all want to see the power of the Han family.”

As soon as she said that, Han Yilong found it hard to back down!

He braced himself and said, “In that case, I’ll let you see my real strength!”

After saying that, Han Yilong clenched his fist and rushed toward Qin Yu!

This punch had almost exhausted all the inner strength in his body, and he wanted to show Qin Yu his might!

However, just as his fist was about to touch Qin Yu, Qin Yu reached out and grabbed Han Yilong’s fists.

“It’s my turn.” Qin Yu grinned and revealed his white teeth.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
