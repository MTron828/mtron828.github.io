2065 The Exasperated Holy Lord Si

Jiang Wushuang still maintained his demeanor. He cupped his hands and said, “Holy Lord Si is right. I’m also worried that it’s fake, but we must try it out, right?”

Holy Lord Ji didn’t bother with Jiang Wushuang anymore. The Si family had to obtain the fortuity in the Chaos Grave.

Therefore, Holy Lord Si looked at the elderly man beside him.

This elderly man looked withered, but his internal qi was so powerful that no one dared to look at him directly!

When Jiang Wushuang saw this elderly man, his expression changed slightly. He then cupped his hands to greet him, “Senior Si.”

!!

The elderly man ignored Jiang Wushuang and looked at Holy Lord Si. “Holy Lord, don’t waste any more time. Let’s move.”

“Alright.” Holy Lord agreed and handed everything to the elderly man.

The elderly man had a tribulation magical artifact and path inscription. His body was stained with chaotic blood, and he also carried the supreme bone.

With the protection of the tribulation magical artifact, the death qi here could no longer invade their bodies, and their internal qi was not affected at all.

Following that, the elderly man jumped into the Chaos Grave and walked into the depths of the Chaos Grave.

During this process, the people of the Si family were quite nervous because they did not know if this attempt would go smoothly.

A few of them fixed their gazes on this True Saint closely, not daring to be careless.

On the other hand, Jiang Wushuang had a bright smile on his face. He did not intend to step into the Chaos Grave.

“What are you waiting for?” Holy Lord Si couldn’t help but ask.

Jiang Wushuang smiled and said, “Uncle Si, this is, after all, the Chaos Grave. We should take a look first. Moreover, we don’t have the chaotic blood.”

“Hehe! You might as well go back. There’s no point in staying here because the hidden treasures in the Chaos Grave will belong to the Si family!” Holy Lord Si said coldly.

Jiang Wushuang didn’t reply to him. He just smiled in response.

Qin Yu also hid in the dark and waited quietly.

He had a foreboding that this True Saint who had entered the Chaos Grave would die there. Most probably, the Si family would suffer heavy losses this time.

As time passed, terrifying internal qi and light gushed out from the Chaos Grave from time to time.

At this moment, the elderly man who had stepped into the Chaos Grave suddenly shouted and jumped out from the depths of the Chaos Grave!

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions instantly changed drastically! Holy Lord Si widened his eyes and said in shock, “How could it be?”

The enormous hand closed in on him, leaving the elderly man nowhere to hide!

“Ah!”

At this moment, the True Saint roared. He forcefully burned his blood essence and adjusted his internal qi to its peak state. Then he turned around and formed a seal, slapping at the enormous hand!

“Boom!”

The terrifying sound almost shattered everyone’s eardrums! For a moment, everyone stepped backward for several steps. A terrifying aftershock swept out in all directions, sending sand and stones flying wherever it passed!

In the next second, the elderly man was forced back a few steps, and blood spurted out of his mouth!

“So strong!” Qin Yu frowned.

It was self-evident how terrifying this huge hand was. Even Yan Guyun and the others had almost died inside. Now that the Chaos Grave had spread, the internal qi inside was even more terrifying!

Even so, this elderly man still relied on his terrifying strength to take it head-on!

“As expected of the True Saint. If it were anyone else, they would have turned into ashes instantly,” Jiang Wushuang also commented.

However, Holy Lord Si was not in the mood to listen to this. He stared at the scene in front of him and said in a panic, “What’s going on? Where’s your supreme bone?”

Looking carefully, the supreme bone in the elderly man’s hand had already shattered!

It was not a supreme bone but the bone of a tribulation great cultivator!

The bones of a tribulation great cultivator were incredibly terrifying, yet they shattered. How horrifying was the internal qi in the Chaos Grave? What kind of existence was hiding inside?

“Holy Lord Si, the supreme bone in your hands seems fake. That Xuan Jizi actually dared to lie to you?” Jiang Wushuang said in a heart-wrenching manner.

Holy Lord Si’s expression became tremendously ugly, and the anger in his heart was even more uncontrollable!

“Quickly run!” However, the most important thing right now was the life of this True Saint. He roared like a madman, no longer showing any demeanor!

However, it was the Chaos Grave, after all. It had formed its own dao technique rules. Even a True Saint could not escape!

“Tribulation magical artifact… Catch it!” The elderly man seemed to have predicted his ending. He threw out the tribulation magical artifact in his hand with all his might!

Then a terrifying flame surged out from the depths of the Chaos Grave. It was like a horrifying monster that had opened its bloody mouth and swallowed the elderly man completely.

The flames emitted rays of light one after another as if the elderly man resisted with all his might.

However, in just a minute, the flames dissipated, and everything calmed down.

As for the elderly man, there was no trace of him as if nothing had happened. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“How… How could this be…” Holy Lord Si stepped back, and the panic on his face was visible to the naked eye.

“Why did it turn out like this…” Holy Lord Si murmured in a low voice at was lost.

At this moment, Jiang Wushuang said heart-wrenchingly, “Sigh! Xuan Jizi is a liar. Liars hurt people!”

Holy Lord Si’s entire body was trembling. It was unknown whether it was due to anger or sadness.

“Xuan Jizi… My Si family will definitely tear you into pieces, no matter the price!” Holy Lord Si raised his head and roared as if losing his mind. It was tremendously horrifying!

“I swear in the name of the Holy Lord of the Si family that from today onward, the Si family will send three True Saints to kill all the enemies of the Si family!”

“Xuan Jizi, the mysterious person of the demon race, and Qin Yu. None of you should think about staying alive!”

The roar spread throughout the Chaos Grave, and everyone could hear it clearly.

Qin Yu cursed in his heart, “F*ck you! What does it have to do with me? Xuan Jizi, you’re a b*stard!”

How many years had it been since the Si family last sent out three True Saints?

The Si family’s actions would probably shock the world!

” Hey, Holy Lord Si, don’t be sad. Why don’t you lend me the chaotic blood and let our Jiang family try it?” Jiang Wushuang said.

Holy Lord Si looked at Jiang Wushuang coldly and said, “Do you really think the supreme bone in your hand is real?”

“It’s hard to say. I feel like it’s real.” Jiang Wushuang took out the supreme bone given by Qin Yu and played with it gently.

Compared to the bone of the Si family, the supreme bone in Jiang Wushuang’s hand looked much more fragile as if it would break if he did not handle it with care.
