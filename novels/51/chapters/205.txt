Chapter 206: The Furious Yan Ruoxue! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xiong Yi’s plan could be said to be flawless. He had coveted Lei Hu’s position for a long time, but he had never found an opportunity.

Now that Qin Yu was in trouble, he could use this opportunity to act.

At night, Lei Hu, his face full of worry, sat in his office.

“Brother Hu, don’t worry too much. Doesn’t Mr. Qin still have the Yan family backing him?” Lance consoled.

Lei Hu took a puff of his cigarette and said in a low voice, “Yes, but the matter has already reached this stage, and the Yan family still has no intention of making a move. I’m afraid...”

He didn’t continue, but the meaning was very clear.

Lance didn’t know what to do for a moment. The matter in the provincial capital wasn’t something they could interfere with.

At this moment, the office door was suddenly kicked open!

Following that, a large group of people swarmed over! They surrounded Lei Hu and Lance!

Lei Hu’s expression changed. He berated coldly, “Who are you? How dare you barge into my office?”

“Hehe, Lei Hu, it’s me.” Very quickly, Xiong Yi walked in from outside the door.

When he saw Xiong Yi, Lei Hu’s expression instantly froze.

“What do you want to do?” Lei Hu said coldly.

Xiong Yi sneered and said, “What do I want to do? Lei Hu, you’ve been in this position for too long. It’s time to change hands.”

“You’re courting death!” Lei Hu instantly flew into a rage!

He picked up the phone on the table and was about to call someone.

“Don’t waste your energy. Your people have already been killed by me,” Xiong Yi indifferently said.

Lei Hu’s expression instantly became somewhat ugly. He didn’t expect Xiong Yi to actually cause trouble at this time!

“Xiong Yi, you’re quite bold. Aren’t you afraid of getting retaliation for your greed?” Lei Hu narrowed his eyes and said.

Xiong Yi clenched his nails and said with a half-hearted smile, “Now that the commercial resources of Jiangcheng are in my hands, what do I have to fear? Your backer has already fallen. Lei Hu, your reign is over!”

“You’re courting death!” ” Lance was instantly enraged. He wanted to get up, but was pressed on the shoulder by Little Wu.

“Don’t move, or you won’t just be sitting in a wheelchair,” Little Wu said nonchalantly.

Lance’s expression changed, and he said in surprise, “An Inner Strength Master?”

When he heard this term, Lei Hu’s heart suddenly thumped.

Obviously, Xiong Yi had made full preparations for this day!

“Take him away!” Xiong Yi shouted.

“Yes!”

Lei Hu, who was a big shot in Jiangcheng, was taken out of his office quietly.

His many underlings had long disappeared.

The fall of big shots was discreet.

...

Mr. Wu was anxious.

It was already late at night, but Mr. Wu wasn’t sleepy at all.

He used all his connections, but they all rejected him.

For a moment, no one seemed to be able to save Qin Yu.

“Dad, think of something quickly!” Xiao Yu shook Mr. Wu’s arm and said anxiously.

Mr. Wu glanced at Xiao Yu and shook his head, “I have done my best, but... sigh.”

Xiao Yu immediately said anxiously, “Then what should we do? Should we just watch Qin Yu die?”

Mr. Wu was silent and kept smoking.

Xiao Yu said angrily, “The Jiang family is too outrageous. They are simply abusing their power! Someone has to teach them a lesson!”

“What do you want to do? Xiao Yu, let me tell you, don’t do anything reckless!” Mr. Wu hurriedly scolded.

Xiao Yu snorted and didn’t say anything. She turned around and went back to her room before closing the door.

She laid on the bed and thought for a while. Finally, she took out her phone and found a number.

“Ruoxue, Qin Yu was captured by the Jiang family. The Jiang family is too outrageous. They couldn’t defeat Qin Yu, so they used their connections to capture Qin Yu!”

“Tomorrow, they will execute Qin Yu. My dad tried all his connections, but it was useless.”

“Ruoxue, is the Jiang family really that powerful? Is there no one who can punish them?”

After sending a few messages, Xiao Yu threw her phone to the side.

After about ten minutes, Yan Ruoxue replied, “I’m going to Chuzhou tomorrow.”

Upon seeing the message on the screen, Xiao Yu immediately jumped up from her bed!

...

In Jingdu, the Yan family’s manor.

At this moment, a young girl’s face was ice-cold, and she was unable to contain her anger.

On her cold face, there was a murderous look, but it added a different kind of charm.

“The Jiang family actually dares to act so insolent and brazen!”

“What, there’s no one left in Chuzhou?!”

Facing the furious Yan Ruoxue, even Old Mister Yan, who was extremely powerful, didn’t dare to say anything.

“Ruoxue, don’t worry. I’ll send someone to Chuzhou in a while,” Old Mister Yan said with a bitter smile.

Yan Ruoxue glanced at Old Mister Yan and said coldly, “No, I’ll go there myself.”

“It’s just a small matter. There’s no need to make such a big fuss,” Old Mister Yan said helplessly.

“I said I’ll go there myself,” Yan Ruoxue said with a cold expression. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I want to see how powerful the Jiang family is!”

“Shameless people!”

...

The next day, the Yan family sent out eight Inner Strength Grandmasters to protect Yan Ruoxue.

These Inner Strength Grandmasters weren’t people like Jiang Gu, who had just stepped into the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm.

They had been Inner Strength Grandmasters for many years and their strength was unimaginable.

A helicopter was parked in the Yan family’s manor.

“Ruoxue, be careful,” Old Mister Yan reminded her worriedly.

Yan Ruoxue nodded and said, “Grandfather, don’t worry.”

Then, she walked into the helicopter with eight Inner Strength Grandmasters following her.

The helicopter flew across the sky towards Chuzhou.

After Yan Ruoxue left, Old Mister Yan’s kind expression instantly disappeared.

What replaced it was indescribable coldness.

“Inform all parties in Chuzhou to protect Miss Yan’s safety.”

“If my granddaughter loses even a hair, I will force a change in Chuzhou’s power dynamics!” Old Mister Yan said coldly.

“Yes, Master.” The butler beside him hurriedly nodded.

...

That morning, Jiang Gu got up early.

He deliberately changed into a suit that made him look high-spirited.

Jiang Gu stood in front of Jiang Haoran and whispered, “Son, don’t blame me. For the family, anyone can be sacrificed. You and I are no exception.”

“But don’t worry. I will kill Qin Yu and avenge you.” Viciousness flashed in Jiang Gu’s eyes.

In the prison, there was a tense atmosphere.

Everyone seemed to have realized something, so their expressions were somewhat sorrowful.

Only Qin Yu appeared to be quite calm.

“Mr. Qin...” Yao Qing opened his mouth, and his eyes suddenly became somewhat teary.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “A man doesn’t shed tears. Hold it back for me.”

Although it was a joke, it made Yao Qing unable to hold it in anymore.

“Mr. Qin, I’m willing to break out with you!” Yao Qing said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said with a smile, “No need.”
