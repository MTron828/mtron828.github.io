2070 Escape from Zhongzhou

Supreme bone?

“Oh no!” Qin Yu slapped his head and said, “Oh no! I actually threw the supreme bone inside!”

Hearing what Qin Yu said, Holy Son Jiang’s face immediately darkened.

“Brother Qin, are you joking? That supreme bone is such an important thing. How could you throw it inside?” Holy Son Jiang said unhappily.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m telling the truth. I really threw the supreme bone inside. The one in your hand is probably the only supreme bone left in this world.”

What joke was this? After meeting the two elderly men, the supreme bones in Qin Yu’s hand were gone. What else could he give to Holy Son Jiang?

There was a hint of anger on Holy Son Jiang’s face. He glared at Qin Yu and said, “You brat! If you don’t give me the supreme bone, quickly return my Si family’s Mysterious Heavenly Mirror!”

“Don’t worry, Holy Son Jiang. I promised the Jiang family that I would return it after using it,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

With that, Qin Yu took out the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror.

Playing with it in his hands, he said in a low voice, “Holy Son Jiang, I can return this thing, but I’m afraid I need to enter the Chaos Grave again. Can I return it to you when I’m done?”

Before Holy Son Jiang could speak, Qin Yu hurriedly added, “I have no choice. This is my agreement with the Jiang family.”

Holy Son Jiang opened his mouth and waved his hand. “Forget it, forget it! Since I’ve already promised you, my Jiang family will definitely not take it back.”

“Thank you very much!” Qin Yu was overjoyed. After cupping his hands at Holy Son Jiang, he turned around and left.

It would probably be very difficult to contain the matter of the supreme bone. It would probably not take long before it spread.

Therefore, Qin Yu had to keep the Mystic Heavenly Mirror to save his life.

With the clothes that were left behind, Qin Yu was not afraid. Even a True Saint would find it difficult to do anything to him if he encountered one.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to stay nearby the Chaos Grave and left.

After much thought, Qin Yu decided to leave Zhongzhou for the time being and return to Nanzhou directly.

After entering the Chaos Grave, Qin Yu’s state of mind had greatly improved, and he could now step into the Advanced-stage of the Reversion Void anytime.

Moreover, coupled with the Traceless Immortal Scripture in his hand, Qin Yu had to comprehend it as soon as possible.

By then, it would not be difficult to catch up to the current Holy Son.

As long as he stepped into the same cultivation realm, Qin Yu would not be afraid of any Holy Son.

On the other end, after Holy Lord Si returned, he immediately mobilized his people.

Besides Xuan Jizi, Qin Yu, and the others, this revenge was also on everyone the Si family had a grudge against!

However, after Holy Lord Si finished his deployment, news arrived.

A cultivator who had stayed nearby the Chaos Grave whispered into Holy Lord Si’s ear, “Holy Lord Si, Holy Son Jiang entered the Chaos Grave and came out unscathed.”

Holy Lord Si was startled and hurriedly said, “How is this possible?”

“Many people saw it,” the cultivator said bitterly.

“Holy Lord Si, the supreme bone in Holy Son Jiang’s hand… I’m afraid it’s real.”

Holy Lord Si, who had been furious, almost fainted when he heard this!

“It’s real… That supreme bone is indeed real!” Holy Lord Si held onto the wall with one hand, afraid that he would fall.

Holy Lord Si waved his hand weakly and said, “Forget it, forget it! I’ll think of a way to borrow that supreme bone later.”

“Also… There’s another piece of news…” the cultivator said carefully at this moment as if he was afraid of angering Holy Lord Si.

Holy Lord Si looked much calmer. He nodded and said, “Speak. I’m already used to so much bad news.”

“That’s… Qin Yu entered the Chaos Grave together with him…” The cultivator’s voice was like a mosquito’s squeak.

Holy Lord Si was stunned and spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Qin… Qin Yu…” Holy Lord Si felt his vision turn black and instantly fell to the ground!

“Holy Lord Si, are you alright?” The cultivators around him hurriedly surrounded him!

Holy Lord Si opened his mouth, looking tremendously haggard.

“Holy Lord Si, I’ve sent people to follow Qin Yu! We can find him immediately!” The cultivator hurriedly tried to salvage the situation.

Holy Lord Si waved his hand with the last bit of his strength and said, “Go, go, bring him back. No, kill him immediately. Kill him!”

After saying this, Holy Lord Si fainted.

Then the Si family quickly arranged for a True Saint to go after Qin Yu.

Before the True Saint made a move, Si Shifeng volunteered, “Can you let me go with you? I also want to personally kill this Qin Yu.”

The True Saint thought for a while before he nodded and said, “Alright, you follow me.”

Although the Si family was powerful, they didn’t have many True Saints. They had eight or ten at most, and almost all had withered.

Every time they attacked, their lifespans would be shortened. Therefore, they would not attack easily.

He brought Si Shifeng along because he thought he needed not attack but could assist Si Shifeng.

…

On the other end, as Qin Yu had the Traceless Immortal Scripture in his hand, he was tremendously nervous along the way. He was afraid that he would be discovered.

Once the Traceless Immortal Scripture was unearthed, it would definitely stir up the Holy Region!

At this moment, there were not many people that Qin Yu could trust. Other than Jue Wu and Xiao Hai, Qin Yu nearly did not dare to trust anyone else.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived nearby a formation and planned to take the formation to Nanzhou.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly sensed traces of tremendously dangerous internal qi!

“It’s… Holy Power.” Qin Yu took a deep breath, and his expression darkened.

“As expected, the moment a True Saint makes a move, I have nowhere to hide.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and could not help but laugh bitterly.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and closed his eyes to sense the source of the Holy Power.

To True Saint, all methods were useless, so he didn’t conceal his internal qi at all.

A moment later, a figure appeared from the dark.

“Qin Yu, long time no see.”

This voice was incomparably familiar. It came from Si Shifeng.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He ignored Si Shifeng and said to a certain place in the void, “Senior, there’s no need to hide.”

Si Shifeng was stunned. He was obviously unhappy that Qin Yu ignored him.

A moment later, a hunchbacked elderly man stepped out from the darkness.

His hands were behind his back, and his eyes were almost drowned by wrinkles. He looked incomparably old.

“You’re already so old, yet you still come out to move around?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Qin Yu, watch your words when you talk to the elder of the Si family,” Si Shifeng said coldly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Yo, there’s another person here!” Qin Yu said in surprise. “I’m sorry. Your internal qi is too weak. I didn’t see you.”
