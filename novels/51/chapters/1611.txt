Chapter 1612: Chapter 1612, see you in three days! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Even though that was the case, Yong Ji was still a little worried. He still did not dare to be too arrogant.

To be on the safe side, Yong Ji stood up and said, “Regarding the incident last time, I am filled with guilt. And our northern land also does not want to be enemies with the Tianyun sect.”

Speaking up to this point, Yong Ji took out a gift box and said, “In order to express our apology, the northern land specially prepared a gift to apologize to the sect leader.”

The deputy sect master secretly felt that things were not good. He was silent for a moment before saying, “I don’t think there’s a need for that. Our Heavenly Cloud sect doesn’t want to have an affair with you.”

Yong ji chuckled and said, “This is a token of our northern land’s goodwill. Moreover, it was personally given to me by our Northern Land’s master. No matter what, I have to give it to you.”

The deputy sect master frowned slightly and braced himself to say, “Then hand it over to me. I will hand it over to the sect master.”

Seeing the deputy sect master’s behavior, Yong Ji increasingly believed in his own thoughts.

The Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master had not returned at all! Otherwise, the deputy sect master would not have such an attitude!

Hence, Yong Ji said with a smile, “The Divine King has said that this thing has to be handed over to the sect master personally. It’s better for Lord sect master to come forward.”

The deputy sect master’s expression turned even uglier.

The sect master had not returned at all. How could he come forward to receive this gift?

“Hand the thing over to me. Our sect master doesn’t want to see you.”At this point, the deputy sect master could only brace himself and continue acting.

With that said, the deputy sect master stretched out his hand to receive the thing.

However, Yong Ji reached out his hand to the side and said with a faint smile, “I said that this thing can only be handed over to the sect master personally.”

The Deputy Sect Master was silent and did not know what to do for a moment.

When Yong Ji saw this, his face was gradually exposed.

He sneered and said, “What’s wrong? Why hasn’t your sect master appeared yet? It Can’t be that he hasn’t returned at all, right?”

The deputy sect master opened his mouth and braced himself to say, “Nonsense, our sect master just doesn’t want to see you.”

“Oh? Is That So?”Yong Ji no see sneered and his actions became more and more impudent.

Yong Ji sat down and crossed his legs intentionally, then he said indifferently, “Then please ask your sect master to come out. If he doesn’t come out, it only means that he didn’t come back at all. All of you are just using tiger skin as a banner!”

“Who says our sect master hasn’t come back?”

At this moment, Di Zun’s voice came from the dark.

Then, he looked over and saw him walking straight to Yongji from outside the door.

“Who says our sect master hasn’t come back?”Di Zun said with a faint smile.

Yongji glanced at Di zun and said sarcastically, “If he has come back, why doesn’t he dare to come out to see me?”

“He doesn’t dare to come out to see you? Yong Ji, do you dare to repeat it again?”Di Zun said coldly.

Yong Ji opened his mouth and felt as though a fishbone was stuck in his throat. He was actually a little worried.

He knew that Di Zun was very likely putting on an act, but he still did not dare to take this risk.

Yong Ji swallowed his saliva and then braced himself to say, “I... I just want to see your sect master. This is also what our godly monarch wants.”

Di Zun, however, did not spare him. He said with a black face, “I’ll let you repeat it again.”

Yong Ji’s expression changed. This extreme pressure made Yong Ji even more terrified.

“Forget it. I believe Mr. Yong Ji did not do it on purpose,”the deputy sect master stepped forward to mediate the situation.

Di Zun snorted coldly and said, “I thought Mr. Yong Ji was really so bold to dare to speak rudely in front of our sect master.”

Yong Ji’s expression immediately changed!

Could it be that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect really came back? Was Sima Bei lying to him?

As he was speaking, a tall figure walked in from outside.

His face was covered by the dense mist and it was impossible to see his face clearly. No one could tell whether he was the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect or not.

However, his figure was extremely similar to the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!

Therefore, when Yong Ji saw this figure, he couldn’t help but shiver.

He tried to use his divine sense to try to find out the identity of the person in front of him, but unfortunately, this “Sect master of the Tianyun sect”in front of him had no internal Qi at all.

“What... What’s going on...”Yong Ji was extremely terrified, and cold sweat kept flowing down his face.

“Greetings... Greetings to the sect master of the Tianyun sect,”Yong Ji cupped his hands and said.

However, the sect master of the Tianyun sect did not say a word.

This behavior immediately made Yong Ji suspicious.

He held the gift box with both hands and said, “This is a gift from our godly monarch. I hope you can accept it.”

The sect master of the Tianyun sect remained silent and did not reach out to receive the gift.

Di Zun quickly reached out his hand and put the gift into his bag.

“Our sect master is sick and doesn’t want to talk, so I took it for him,”said Di Zun.

Yong Ji couldn’t help but frown. He asked suspiciously, “What happened to the sect master? Is he injured?”

“It has nothing to do with you. Anyway, you have delivered the gift. You can leave now,”said Di Zun.

The suspicion in Yong Ji’s heart grew stronger. He tried to say, “Are you really the sect master of the Tianyun Sect?”

“How dare you!”Di Zun suddenly shouted from the side.

“Yong Ji, what do you mean? Are you doubting the identity of our sect master? !”Di Zun berated him angrily.

Yong Ji remained silent. He could basically determine that the person in front of him was a fake sect master. However, the fear in his heart still made him not dare to say anything.

“Sect master, you should go back and rest first. Leave this place to me.”Di Zun cupped his hands towards the sect master.

The sect master didn’t say anything else and turned around to leave.

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and remained silent.

He increasingly believed in his own judgment.

Because if the person in front of him was really the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, he would definitely die here and wouldn’t be able to leave the Heavenly Cloud sect at all!

However, the “Sect master”in front of him didn’t say a word. Instead, he asked him to leave. This was too illogical and didn’t conform to the character of the sect master of the Tianyun sect.

Even though that was the case, Yong Ji didn’t dare to gamble. He was afraid that if he lost the bet, he would lose his life.

Di Zun was also gambling. He was gambling that Yong Ji didn’t dare to gamble!

“Why aren’t you leaving yet? Do you still want to wait for us to treat you to a meal?”Di Zun said with a dark face. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Yong Ji sneered in his heart. After thinking for a while, he came up with a perfect plan.

“Vice sect master, the north and south regions are currently in a constant conflict. Countless people have died and many sects have been implicated,”Yong Ji said faintly.

“To tell you the truth, this is not what we want to see. Therefore, I plan to invite everyone to discuss this matter and find a way for both of us to survive.”

“Three days later, I will set up a banquet in the eternal limit city and invite all the major sects and sects in the world to participate. Of course, the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect must be present.”
