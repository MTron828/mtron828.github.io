Chapter 2550 The Judge’s Brush

At this moment, this enormous power of sacrifice was completely spent on Saint Zi Yang. Qin Yu unleashed his imagination to the extreme but found it hard to imagine what monster he had created.

In the Holy Region, at this point, Su Xinghe, Revered Qi, and Divine Night Sect stood up abruptly, looking at the Misty Forest with an unimaginable look of horror.

“How, how can this be?”

In purgatory, the sect masters of the four schools and four sects looked at the Misty Forest simultaneously.

“Not only did Saint Zi Yang not die, he has also fallen into the Path of Demon!”

“The masked woman and Zi Yang have already disrupted the balance of power. Which direction will the human race take from here?”

“Does heaven really want to exterminate our human race?”

This kind of impact was even more shocking than the masked woman breaking through to the fifth level and entering the Kingdom of Saint.

Since the beginning of the primordial era, there had never been an instance of a Saint among the human race being possessed.

Furthermore, Saint Zi Yang, empowered by the monster race’s power of sacrifice, possessed an overwhelming momentum that caused a strong disturbance even in the inner peace of the other few Saints.

“Bang!”

Everyone could not help but bend when Saint Zi Yang released his internal qi fully.

In the end, his body slammed onto the ground fiercely as if this was the only way to counteract the terrifying pressure slightly.

In the sky, Saint Zi Yang slowly stood up and looked in their direction.

The Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror let out a sound of being overwhelmed.

Along with the shield formed by Qin Yu’s Spiritualization Technique, there was also Zhang Xiang and Li Yang’s Seal of Guardian.

In an instant, they were covered with cracks.

Moreover, the massive pressure seemed to have squeezed from all directions. Qin Yu instantly burst out the power of his six acupoints, then only slowly stood up.

Xuan Xin’s body started to tremble violently. The Green Duckweed Sword in his hand seemed to have sensed his thoughts and let out a loud sword chant.

However, as the Saint appeared before them, all their struggles became particularly ridiculous.

Almost everyone was sent flying.

Qin Yu only had time to open up his arms before he felt her entire body tremble.

At the final moment of his thoughts, he only saw a pair of black-red eyes.

It was like a pair of divine eyes. Qin Yu could not sense any emotions within. There was only the thought of destroying this world.

Meditation! The Demonic Brilliance Divine Power!

A sense of fear of death enveloped him, and Qin Yu almost subconsciously poured out this power.

“Is this the might of the Saint?”

After the strike, his body seemed to have lost all the feelings.

He only felt the Heart of the Ocean in his body emit an irritating buzzing sound.

It felt like it lasted a minute, yet it seemed like a century had passed.

Qin Yu gradually came back to his senses, feeling slightly dazed as he looked around.

The mountain range was torn apart, and the rocks collapsed, forming enormous cracks and cliffs.

The originally meandering river turned into rolling lava, scorching the earth and making hissing sounds.

All living beings and lives were left in misery and desolation.

Apart from the rolling lava, this place had turned into a yellow dead desert.

At this moment, even lifting a finger felt like a heart-wrenching struggle for him. The black shadow had already left.

Qin Yu felt himself trembling uncontrollably. He could clearly sense that Zi Yang was aware that he was not dead, but he seemed not to care to attack again. He left just like that.

Beside him, Xuan Xin, Xuan Tian, Zhang Xiang, Li Yang, Shen Qian, and Shen Rou, the six of them had completely disappeared as if they had never appeared.

Qin Yu suddenly felt utmost sad. For the first time, he felt a sense of cherishing each other among different factions.

The talkative Zhang Xiang, the gentle Shen Qian, Shen Rou, and the aloof duo from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect…

Even Xuan Tian, who had previously wanted to kill him, did not disguise his intentions at all.

To them, it seemed that the things in the dark were something they disdained.

Moreover, it was rare for people from three different sects to be as close as fellow brothers and sisters.

The Green Duckweed Sword, stabbed into the ground and swaying, let out a soft sword chant as if it was lamenting the departure of its master.

The monster race surrounded him from all directions, Death Godly King, Titan King, the nine-winged monster race army, and even dark monster beasts with vigorous internal qi.

“Qin Yu used the Judge’s Brush!”

A voice suddenly sounded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. It was Immortal Emperor Yao’s voice.

At this moment, he was in a little daze. He subconsciously took out the Judge’s Brush he had never used before.

Since Jun Yixian resisted Ksitigarbha, he never dared to use this brush for fear of being detected.

This was the first time he looked at the brush carefully. The shaft was made of black iron, heavy and cold.

The tip of the brush was like a cold moon, delicate and sharp, emitting a chilling aura.

In an instant, the Judge’s Brush shook violently.

The tip of the brush emitted a faint chill, seemingly connecting the boundary between life and death.

The moment Qin Yu waved the brush with all his strength, an inexplicable power emitted.

It was like the ink from the tip of a brush that fell into the surroundings.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt the omnipresent information enter his sea of consciousness.

Every touch of the Judge’s Brush seemed to open a door to another unknown world.

The tip of the brush emitted a faint chill, seemingly connecting the boundary between life and death.

At this moment, the six internal qi suddenly connected with the Judge’s Brush. The past, present, and future of the six people including the trajectory of their fates and possible turning points, suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“I want you all to stay alive!”

Qin Yu held the Judge Brush with both hands and a bloody word “alive” was drawn in front of him.

With every stroke, the Judge’s Brush seemed to suck Qin Yu’s flesh and blood dry.

The terrifying suction force had even drained the energy of every cell of his Glazed Holy Body.

The source of life left behind by the Heart of the Ocean was now completely absorbed by the Judge’s Brush.

However, this shocking amount of energy was not enough to satisfy the needs of the Judge’s Brush.

When the last stroke landed, Qin Yu’s body instantly turned into an old man from an ordinary youth.

Countless images of reincarnation appeared at the tip of the brush.

In the next moment, the six people appeared on the spot again. Their eyes were blank as if they had yet to react.

“The Judge’s Brush! Isn’t it the supreme treasure of the ghost realm? Why did it appear in the hands of this human? Could it be that the ghost realm has betrayed the alliance?”

Titan let out a roar.

“The chances of this happening aren’t high. Perhaps something had happened to the ghost realm and thus allowed a human race to obtain the Judge’s Brush. However, this is a rare opportunity. If we can obtain this supreme treasure of the ghost realm, we can advance further!”

For the first time, a crazed look appeared in the Death Godly King’s eyes.
