Chapter 1633: Chapter 1,633, the terrified Barrow! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The purplish-red heaven flame was originally used to temper divine weapons. Now that Qin Yu was using it to temper his body, it was enough to prove that Qin Yu’s physical body was not inferior to a divine weapon!

If he used the same technique, it was very likely to succeed!

Once it succeeded, it would definitely greatly shorten the time needed to temper his body!

“Everyone, please leave for a moment. Our clothes,”Qin Yu said as he sat in the abandoned pool.

After sending everyone away, Xiao Cao quickly took out a piece of clothing.

It was obvious that Xiao Cao was an extremely attentive girl. She had remembered this matter since the last time.

After Xiao Cao placed the clothes in a safe place, she hurriedly ran out.

Qin Yu smiled without saying anything. He walked out of the abandoned pool and put on his clothes.

As he walked out of the abandoned pond, he saw Xiao Cao standing at the door with a red face.

He didn’t know what she was thinking about. She covered her face from time to time and stamped her feet from time to time.

“What are you doing?”Qin Yu walked up from behind and patted her shoulder gently.

Hearing Qin Yu’s voice, Xiao Cao was startled. She hurriedly shook her head and said, “Nothing... nothing.”

Qin Yu didn’t continue this topic. He looked at Xiao Cao and said, “Do you know where that Master Zhengyang’s home is?”

“Ah, I know.”Xiao Cao hurriedly nodded and said.

She pointed to the extremely huge palace not far away and said, “That’s where Master Zhengyang lives.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

They were both master refiners, but Xiao Cao’s residence could be said to be very simple. How could master Zhengyang’s residence be so luxurious?

Xiao Cao seemed to see Qin Yu’s doubt and explained in a low voice, “Many wealthy families would find master Zhengyang to refine weapons, and they are willing to spend money, so Master Zhengyang is the richest in the refining city.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu nodded slightly. It seemed that the gap between the rich and the poor was everywhere, even in the refining city.

“Let’s go, let’s visit this master Zhengyang,”said Qin Yu.

Xiao Cao opened her mouth, as if she wanted to say something.

“What’s Wrong?”Asked Qin Yu.

Xiao Cao shook her head and said, “Nothing, let’s go.”

Thus, under Xiao Cao’s lead, Qin Yu walked toward Master Zhengyang’s palace.

He arrived at the vicinity of the palace.

Looking Up, he saw that the palace was flickering with an extremely dark radiance.

This radiance was not a spell, but the dark radiance emitted by the materials themselves.

Obviously, the materials used in this palace were extraordinary.

Qin Yu tried to put his hand on it and then slowly exerted force, but the wall did not change at all.

“What a strong material,”Qin Yu said in surprise.

Xiao Cao whispered, “I heard that master zhengyang often deducts materials from divine weapons.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, “I see.”

Then, Qin Yu took Xiao Cao and walked into the palace.

There weren’t many people in the huge palace. After walking for a long time, they finally saw a person.

This person was tall and had a cold expression. His entire body was emitting a radiance that was like cold iron.

“Who are you looking for?”This person’s tone was emotionless.

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “I am here to look for Master Zhengyang.”

“Master is busy. Please wait in the guest room.”

After saying that, he directly led Qin Yu to the guest room.

Seeing this tall person, Qin Yu felt that he was somewhat familiar.

He tried to spread out his divine sense, but found that he could not detect his realm at all.

“How could this be!”Qin Yu was immediately shocked!

Could it be that this master Zhengyang was supporting a top-notch martial artist?

“This is a mannequin refined by master Zhengyang. It’s called a divine general,”Xiao Cao said.

“Mannequin?”Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

Xiao Cao hummed in gratitude and said, “Master Zhengyang used the most top-notch materials to create three divine generals. Rumor has it that the strength of these divine generals is not weaker than the reversion void stage.”

Qin Yu’s jaw dropped when he heard this.

Not weaker than the reversion void stage? Wasn’t this a little too exaggerated?

However, Qin Yu quickly came back to his senses.

Xiao Cao was probably talking about his toughness. His strength was definitely not on par with the reversion void stage.

Rumor has it that the reversion void stage could move mountains and overturn seas. It could destroy the world with a raise of its hand. Its strength was beyond imagination and could be called an immortal. It was definitely not something that a mannequin could compare to.

After arriving at the guest room, the divine general walked out.

Qin Yu and Xiao Cao sat here and chatted while waiting for master Zheng Yang.

At the same time.

The Northland’s expansion of the southern region continued without end.

He was led by Yong Ji, Baro, and Feng Hai. Because they were powerful enough and had sufficient understanding of the southern region, they were extremely suitable.

On this day, Baro brought people to a small city in the southern region.

A god King suddenly appeared beside him.

“God King, why are you here?”Seeing this god King, Baro was shocked, then he bowed slightly.

This god King glanced at Baro, then said, “I should be familiar with the southern region too.”

“The Godly king is right.”Baro did not dare to say anything and quickly cupped his hands.

Then, Baro led a group of people and walked towards the city.

The huge city had very few people, and the people living in this city were terrifyingly weak. The strongest person was only in the nascent soul realm!

“The southern region actually has such a city.”Baro could not help but frown.

Beside him, the god King also snorted coldly, saying, “They are actually farming? Using such resources to farm, it’s simply a waste of natural resources!”

“Farming?”Baro was somewhat surprised.

This god King pointed forward and said coldly, “In that direction, there seems to be a large piece of land.”

“No wonder there are no signs of human habitation. At this time, they are probably all farming.”Baro nodded slightly.

“Killing such trash is enough.”The god King said coldly.

Barrow quickly cupped his hands and said, “Yes!”

Thus, the group walked towards the farmland.

After walking for a long time, the farmland finally came into view.

As expected, more than half of the people in the city were busy in the farmland.

“HMPH, these trash.”The god King saw the situation and could not help but reveal a cold expression.

Hearing this, Paris immediately ordered, “Kill them all!”

With that said, Barrow took the lead and took a step forward, his terrifying aura instantly engulfing the entire city!

The originally peaceful farmland was now in a hurricane!

Barrow held the light in his hand and with a roar, his palm ruthlessly crushed downwards!

This palm was enough to kill everyone in the farmland!

But just as the light was about to fall, it quietly dispersed!

“HM? What’s going on?”Baro frowned.

He leaned over and saw a slender man in white clothes looking up at Baro.

When he saw his face clearly, Baro’s body suddenly tightened!
