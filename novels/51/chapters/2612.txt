Chapter 2613: Retreat

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The eye on his forehead slowly closed. However, at this moment, the power of his pupils still passed through his eyelids and distinctively imprinted the surrounding scene into his sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu was a little surprised.

Previously, when the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze condensed energy, he could not use this eye.

However, when the black dragon’s Saint power entered his soul, it seemed that he could control this innate eye more perfectly. Not only could he gather power, but he could also use the ability of this eye at the same time.

Moreover, after absorbing a portion of the black dragon’s holy energy, the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could now see within the range of about 35 meters.

“Retreat!”

After killing this black dragon, Qin Yu pulled Ju Wuwei and retreated.

It had been nearly a minute since he killed the black dragon.

Moreover, this was a battle with great momentum, and the fluctuations triggered were tremendously massive.

Therefore, the scene here should have been noticed long ago.

Qin Yu was worried that more necromancy armies would appear if they dragged on. At that time, they could not deal with it.

Not long after they left, they heard angry roars.

The voice seemed to be very far away a second ago, but in the next moment, it rapidly drew closer.

“It came so quickly, and from the sound, it’s not just a black dragon!”

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. They expended all their energy to deal with just one black dragon.

At this moment, Ju Wuwei no longer had the strength to fight. He definitely could not withstand it by relying on him alone.

“Shen Qian, you and Ju Wuwei retreat first. I’ll block them!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and closed his eyes to sense the situation in the air.

With Ju Wuwei’s current state and Shen Qian’s strength, they would not be of any help if they stayed here. It would be better that they retreat first and have a chance of survival.

Giant ogre’s esophagus!

The Order of Necromancy suddenly activated, and a pale power emitted from Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The black dragon was summoned again.

After absorbing that black dragon’s Saint Power, the pressure on Qin Yu reduced significantly. With this black dragon around, his ability to protect himself was greatly enhanced.

It was coming!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Although he could not see the black dragon at this moment, he could hear the muffled sound of its wings clearly.

In less than a second, the black dragon’s shadow appeared within the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze’s range.

One, two, three!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. It was not two black dragons that came, but three.

“Destruction! ”

Qin Yu did not hesitate to open his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze that had just absorbed the Saint Power. A surge of destructive energy blasted forward.

A massive dent appeared in the chest of the black dragon before him. The squirming flesh inside was visible, but it was not fatal.

Almost simultaneously, the other two black dragons grabbed at his head.

Blackie suddenly soared into the sky and headed toward one of the black dragons.

Qin Yu grabbed the diamond blade and placed the blade horizontally above his head.

With the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze Eye’s precise targeting, he blocked the claws of the second black dragon.

The diamond blade broke with a sound, and a terrifying force shattered the bones between his arm and his body.

Qin Yu’s body was sent flying backward.

A corrosive aura spewed from the nostrils of the black dragon that Qin Yu attacked using the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze earlier and directly gushed toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s body instantly turned into a skeleton. The strongest point of his physical strength was between his arms.

At this moment, his arms were broken. Moreover, he had just suffered such a violent impact.

Therefore, there was no time to defend against such a sudden attack. The Seal of Heaven Returning lit up. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

His soul was pulled into the soul space again for about 20 seconds.

Qin Yu looked at the energy in the passage. It would take about 20 seconds to recover.

Qin Yu did not feel like he had survived a disaster. The three black dragons circled his corpse.

Even if he came out again, he would probably be instantly killed again.

He was so nervous that even his soul was sweating. At this moment, he could not use his hat of void and the Seal of Heaven Returning.

If he died again, he would completely disappear from this Saint Kingdom.

One second, two seconds, three seconds…

Eighteen, nineteen…

Finally, the two black dragons spread their wings and left.

Twenty!

Qin Yu’s body was suddenly pulled out and returned to the position 20 seconds ago.

Explode!

Qin Yu’s condition returned to its peak twenty seconds ago.

The power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze previously returned. He opened the pupil on his forehead.

The terrifying power of the eye exploded on the black dragon’s head. Qin Yu rushed toward the passage without stopping.

“Giant ogre’s esophagus!”

Another necromancy prologue surged out. Blackie and the nine ogres suddenly appeared, blocking behind Qin Yu.

“Strengthening! ”

Qin Yu could not be bothered to conserve his Saint Power anymore. All of his strength was strengthened on his legs, and there was not a single trace left. His speed suddenly increased by a level, and the black dragon was confused for a few seconds.

It seemed not to understand why this living being could be resurrected.

It did not react until Blackie and the nine ogres entangled it.

The nine ogres were instantly flung away.

Blackie was also bitten hard.

The other two black dragons had received Seifer’s order and immediately turned back the moment Qin Yu was resurrected.

The instant Qin Yu entered the passage, a massive force exploded from the cave’s entrance.

The furious voices of the black dragons echoed into the passageway. However, these black dragons did not attack the passage for some reason.

“Brother Qin Yu!”

Shen Qian was a little excited. When she saw that Qin Yu had returned safely, her voice trembled.

“Don’t worry. I’m fine! Retreat quickly! Be careful of this black dragon attacking this passage.”

Qin Yu’s internal qi was a little hurried. The sprint just now had used up 20% of his strength.

The three of them retreated to the depths before Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

No wonder all the scout teams died. Their cloaks could not stop Seifer’s probe at all.

With Seifer’s terrifying power, he could easily kill them without them knowing, let alone the terrifying living being, the necromancy black dragon.

Even if Seifer could not attack, the black dragon had almost taken their lives.

Seifer’s withered body suddenly moved, and green flames appeared in its pupils.

“The Order of Reversal, one of the top ten Order of Rules in the Saint Kingdom, has appeared so soon?”

The ghost flame in its pupils trembled slightly as if there was a great fluctuation in its heart.

“Logically speaking, the top ten Heart of Saint Kingdom should only be hidden in the depths of the core. Outsiders can’t obtain them with their current strength. Unless he was a force arranged by Chen Shuang, there was no way he could obtain it. Are you sure you didn’t see wrongly?”

Ross said with a frown.

Seifer ignored Ross’s words. He closed his eyes again instead, thinking about

something..
