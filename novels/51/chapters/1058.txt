Chapter 1059: Chapter 1,059, countermeasures against the five-petaled lotus 

There were too many secrets hidden in the first secret realm. This secret involved the higher-ups, and even the method to step into a higher realm!

Therefore, the higher-ups would rather destroy the second secret realm than open this passage!

Gu Zizhen got up and walked quickly to Zhai Xing’s room.

Zhai Xing’s injuries were getting more and more serious. He lay on the bed and tried to get up many times, but failed.

This was Qin Yu’s two-pronged plan:

He would put Zhai Xing back. If he could betray him, that would be the best.

If he could not betray him, then Zhai Xing would not be able to participate in the battle.

“Realm Master...”seeing Gu Zizhen walk in, Zhai Xing wanted to get up.

However, Gu Zizhen waved his hand. He sat next to Zhai Xing and said indifferently, “Your injuries are very serious. Even the pharmacist I invited can’t do anything about it.”

Zhai Xing smiled bitterly and said, “It’s all my fault that I’m so weak that I ended up like this...”

Gu Zizhen sneered and said, “Is that so? Could it be that Qin Yu did this on Purpose?”

“On purpose? What do you mean?”Zhai Xing was somewhat puzzled.

Gu Zizhen did not say a word. He took out the pill that Qin Yu had sent over and handed it to Zhai Xing.

“Eat it,”gu Zizhen said.

Zhai Xing took the pill. He did not think much and stuffed it into his mouth.

It was strange to say that after swallowing the pill, Zhai Xing’s injuries instantly recovered a lot. He even sat up from the bed.

“What kind of miraculous pill is this?”Zhai Xing asked in great surprise.

Gu Zizhen said with a strange tone, “This was sent by Qin Yu. It’s really strange that he did not forget to bring you the pill when he fought with my second mystic realm.”

Zhai Xing’s expression immediately changed! He hurriedly said, “If you had told me earlier that this was sent by Qin Yu, I would rather not eat it!”

“It’s a pity that you still ate it now.”Gu Zizhen’s expression became colder and colder.

After saying that, Gu Zizhen stood up and looked at Zhai Xing. He said with his back facing Zhai Xing, “There has long been a rumor that the hearts of the people in the second mystic realm are far better than mine. If you rise up, you can replace me at any time.”

“This is all nonsense!”Zhai Xing said angrily.

“Master, I’m willing to hand over all the power in my hands!”

“Hand it over? From what you mean, only if you’re willing to hand it over, can I make them listen to me?”Gu Zizhen said coldly. “...”

“That’s not what I mean.”For a moment, Zhai Xing did not know how to explain.

Gu Zizhen snorted coldly and said, “Zhai Xing, take care of yourself.”

After saying this, Gu Zizhen turned around and left.

Zhai Xing’s expression was extremely unsightly. He knew in his heart that he had most likely fallen into Qin Yu’s trap.

“Qin Yu, I would rather die than betray Gu Zizhen,”Zhai Xing muttered in a low voice and said coldly.

...

In the Heaven Gate, Qin Yu’s injuries had already recovered by more than half.

However, there were still fragments of the five-petaled lotus on his body.

These fragments were embedded into his skin and flesh, piercing straight into his bones, causing cracks to appear on his bones.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and planned to head to the Heaven Secret Pavilion to find a countermeasure.

He rushed all the way to the Heaven Secret Pavilion.

The Heaven Secret Pavilion was as usual. Luo Jingyu’s mind was focused on forging weapons.

However, his son was a complete waste. Other than drinking and flirting with girls every day, he had nothing else to do.

In the hall of the villa behind the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets, Qin Yu was standing there coldly.

Luo Yang knelt in front of Qin Yu, his face full of fear.

“Qin... Qin Yu, please forgive him just this once. He... He is also obsessed...”Luo Jingyu begged bitterly.

Qin Yu looked at Luo Yang coldly and said, “He has plotted against me more than once.”

“I... . . I guarantee that he will never do it again!”Luo Jing Yu hurriedly said.

“I will have my men send him out of the fire country right now and I guarantee that he will never appear before you in Pyro’s lifetime!”

Qin Yu did not say a word, as if he had agreed to this request.

“Get the hell out of Here!”Luo Jing Yu glared angrily at Luo Yang as he shouted.

Luo Yang rolled and crawled as he turned to run.

After Luo Yang left, Luo Jingyu heaved a sigh of relief.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “You... aren’t here for Luo Yang, are you?”

“I’m not in the mood to care about him.”Qin Yu sat on the sofa.

Then, Qin Yu’s body shook, and fragments of the five-petaled lotus shot out from his body.

At this moment, the five-petaled lotus was still flickering with a strange light, and a mysterious internal Qi was slowly flowing.

“Do you know what this is?”Qin Yu picked up a piece of fragment and asked.

Luo Jingyu took the fragment and couldn’t help but show a trace of shock on his face.

“Where... where did this come from?”Luo Jingyu hurriedly asked Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and told Luo Jingyu what happened.

“How is it? Do you know what this thing is?”Qin Yu asked.

Luo Jingyu said in a deep voice, “According to my many years of experience, this item definitely did not come from the second secret realm. It can even be said that this kind of material can not be found in this world.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “This item most likely came from the first secret realm.”

Luo Jingyu slowly rubbed the fragment with his palm, as if he was feeling the internal Qi flowing on it.

After a while, Luo Jingyu opened his eyes and said in a deep voice, “Even if this item isn’t a supreme artifact, it’s almost done. It’s not surprising that you were injured by this item.”

“Supreme Artifact?”Qin Yu’s brows slightly contracted.

It was indeed as he had imagined.

“En, not only is it a supreme artifact, it’s also a holy artifact,”Luo Jingyu explained.

“Usually, magic artifacts are divided into four categories: Heaven, Earth, Black, and yellow. Among them, earth rank and above are called holy artifacts.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “In that case, only mighty artifacts can deal with it?”

“No.”Luo Jingyu shook his head.

“Magic artifacts are extremely mysterious, and their mysteries are far beyond imagination. Mighty artifacts can’t represent everything.”

“For example, the mountain of the five peaks in your hand. Although it doesn’t have any internal Qi of a warrior, it’s a top-tier item.”

“Mountain of the Five Peaks?”Qin Yu suddenly thought of this item.

He took out this item from the spatial divine artifact and said in a low voice, “This item is extremely hard, but it seems to be far inferior to the five-petal Lotus.”

“It is indeed far inferior now.”Luo Jingyu stared at the mountain of the five peaks.

“But this thing has the ability to grow. It is definitely not something that his five-petaled lotus can compare to.”

“The ability to grow?”Qin Yu looked at Luo Jingyu.

Luo jingyu nodded and said, “That is, this thing will grow with your strength.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

But this five-petaled mountain could not be compared to the five-petaled lotus.

“Is there any way to deal with the five-petal Lotus?”Qin Yu returned to the main topic.

“Yes, of course there is.”Luo Jingyu nodded.

Then, he looked at Qin Yu’s pocket and said, “You have it on you, and it’s not just one.”

“Not just one?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Besides the soul bell, what was the other thing?ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels
