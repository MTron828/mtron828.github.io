Chapter 570: Yan Ruoxue’s Current Situation! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu remained silent.

This Ma Hai had been deliberately keeping a distance from Qin Yu. Even Shrinking Ground Into An Inch wouldn’t be enough for Qin Yu to catch up to him.

“Heavenly Saint’s Hand!”

At this moment, Ma Hai attacked once again!

He waved his large palm, and a fiery red palm suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu!

His palm was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, it covered Qin Yu’s body!

Ma Hai seemed to be able to control this large fiery red palm. As he clenched his hands, Qin Yu was immediately tightly grabbed by this hand!

“Next, it will be my turn to torture you,” Ma Hai said with a grin.

His mouth opened slightly, and a strange sound came out from his mouth.

“Huh? It’s a divine sense attack,” the man with the mustache thought to himself, and hurriedly covered his ears.

On the other hand, Qin Yu didn’t feel so good.

His body was caught by this big hand and couldn’t move at all.

The strange sound from Ma Hai’s mouth kept entering Qin Yu’s ears.

For a moment, Qin Yu felt his head go numb and his divine sense buzzed.

Ma Hai struck while the iron was hot. His palm moved for a while and took the Black Iron Sword again.

Then, Ma Hai waved the Black Iron Sword again and slashed at Qin Yu in the air!

“God Slaying Slash!”

Accompanied by Ma Hai’s explosive shout, a sword ray that was several feet long instantly slashed towards Qin Yu!

“Crack!”

The sword ray landed on Qin Yu’s shoulder. Qin Yu’s shoulder instantly sank several centimeters and revealed his ghastly white bones!

“Hahahaha!” Ma Hai couldn’t help but laugh wildly.

“Qin Yu, I will slowly torture you to death!” Ma Hai grinned and said.

“Is that so?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. His entire body shook, and a terrifying internal qi burst out. The large hand that covered his body was shattered!

Ma Hai’s expression turned cold. He snorted coldly and said, “So what if you can escape? You can’t touch me at all!”

Qin Yu swept his gaze around. He pointed at the light in a radius of dozens of meters and said, “Your speed is so fast because of the light under your feet, right?”

Ma Hai’s eyes widened, and he had a bad feeling.

But he quickly calmed down and sneered, “So what if it is?”

“This is probably a space spell,” Qin Yu continued.

Ma Hai frowned slightly. Obviously, Qin Yu was right again.

“It seems that the same principle applies to my Heavy Falling Space technique.” Qin Yu sneered again and again, then burst into laughter.

“What are you laughing at?!” Ma Hai was furious!

This laughter made him feel extremely uneasy!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Ma Hai, you’re right. Fighting doesn’t depend entirely on one’s realm, it also depends on one’s brain.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s feet shook slightly. In an instant, rays of light began to gather under Qin Yu’s feet!

This was the light from the Heavy Falling Space! All along, the Heavy Falling Space technique that Qin Yu could cast only had a radius of one meter!

But after seeing Ma Hai’s spell today, Qin Yu suddenly reacted!

He might be able to expand the range of this Heavy Falling Space technique !

“Ah!!”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and the power of a Martial Marquis completely erupted!

And the light under his feet was also rapidly spreading in all directions!

In a short moment, the Heavy Falling Space covered the light under Ma Hai’s feet!

Not only that, but the Heavy Falling Space was also spreading in all directions!

Very quickly, the Heavy Falling Space covered an area of one kilometer!

“F * ck, why do I feel like I can’t move anymore?” The man with the mustache muttered.

And Ma Hai also discovered to his horror that his speed had decreased!

“How... how could this be?!” Ma Hai’s expression was somewhat ugly!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Ma Hai, if it wasn’t for you, I might never have thought that the area of the Heavy Falling Space technique could be so large...”

“In order to repay you, I can let you die a quick death.”

Before he finished his sentence, Qin Yu used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and charged towards Ma Hai!

Ma Hai tried the same trick again to increase the distance between them.

However, to his horror, he realized that his speed was far slower!

“Oh no!”

Ma Hai was filled with terror!

Before he could think of a countermeasure, Qin Yu had already arrived by his side.

The golden palm cut through the sky and slapped onto Ma Hai’s body!

The strength of this palm was so great that it shattered half of Ma Hai’s body!

“Ah...” An anguished wailed came from Ma Hai’s mouth!

However, Qin Yu didn’t give him the chance to do so and sent another palm strike at him!

“Boom!”

That piece of ground sank, and Ma Hai’s body was almost smashed into meat paste!

“Ah!!!” Ma Hai was extremely furious. He took out his teapot and offered it to Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t even bother to look at it. He smashed the teapot with one punch then kicked Ma Hai’s chest into the air!

“Pfft!”

This kick smashed Ma Hai’s chest!

Qin Yu picked up his body with one hand and bent it from left and right. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

With each slap, Ma Hai’s face would change shape once.

After more than ten slaps, Ma Hai’s head was smashed into pieces.

His internal qi was also rapidly weakening, and in the blink of an eye, he had become a corpse.

Qin Yu looked at Ma Hai coldly. He stretched out his palm and took out Ma Hai’s Golden Core. Without thinking, he swallowed it.

“How brutal,” the man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to him. He walked to Yao Qing and Taozi’s side and helped them up.

“How is it?” Qin Yu asked.

Yao Qing said with anguish, “Mr. Qin, my dantian is damaged. I... I’m afraid I’m going to be a cripple...”

Qin Yu’s expression immediately turned ugly!

“Ma Hai...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have killed Ma Hai so easily!

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely think of a way.”

Taozi’s situation wasn’t good either. Her beautiful face was disfigured. For a girl, this was undoubtedly painful.

“I will send you to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion tomorrow. No matter what, I will think of a way for you,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Why are you here?”

The man with the mustache muttered, “Didn’t you ask me how to save that girl? I finally figured out a way.”

“Fang Yue?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Then, he hurriedly asked, “What way?”

The man with the mustache opened his mouth. Just as he was about to speak, a text message alert came from Qin Yu’s phone.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and took out his phone.

In the text message, there was a video.

When he saw this video, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned pale! His body began to tremble slightly!

In the video, Yan Ruoxue was locked in a prison.

Her face was pale. Tubes that were like chains were placed on each of Yan Ruoxue’s acupuncture points!

And the fresh blood in her body was flowing out through the tubes!
