Chapter 1314: Chapter 1,314, the letter of challenge

The holy region was an extremely vast place. Even the southern region was enormous.

The location given on the note was called Yang City, which was three thousand stars away from Gu City.

This was an extremely long distance. If there were no flying demon beasts, it would take at least ten days to half a month.

Looking at this location, Qin Yu muttered to himself, “This place is already at the edge of the southern region. It’s almost connected to the western region...”

The western ridge, like the Southern Province, was a large part of the Li Province.

In the western ridge, there were also top sects holding down the fort. They were no weaker than the heavenly cloud sect.

“Isn’t this a little too far away?”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at Wen da at the side and said with a smile, “Brother Wen, do you have a Flying Demon Beast?”

Hearing this, Wen da said with some pride, “Of course I do. My Flying Demon Beast is the cloud chasing Scorpion. Its speed is extremely fast!”

“It’s not as fast as my wind chasing Colt,”Wen er said from the side.

Wen Da widened his eyes and said, “Bullsh * T! Did the dog lose last time?”

Wen er snorted and said, “Although my wind chasing colt is not as fast as your cloud chasing scorpion, it can last for a long time. My wind chasing Colt can run for a thousand stars in one breath! Can your cloud chasing Scorpion do it?”

“What’s the use of lasting for a long time? If I encounter an enemy, my cloud chasing Scorpion will take me far away. Your wind chasing Colt hasn’t started moving yet,”Wen da said unwillingly.

“My Wind Chasing Pony is awesome anyway.”

“My Cloud Chasing Scorpion is awesome!”

“Let’s compete!”

Qin Yu felt a headache coming on from the side. He coughed dryly and said with an embarrassed smile, “Gentlemen, can you lend me your flying Demon Beasts? I need to make a trip to Yang City...”

As soon as these words were said, the scene immediately fell silent.

“Wen Er, your wind chasing pony is still awesome! My cloud chasing Scorpion is willing to admit defeat!”Wen da said with a flattering look.

“Big Brother, you’re being too modest. Your Cloud Chasing Scorpion is still the best. It can run really fast, but my wind chasing stallion is trash,”Wen er said hurriedly.

“F * ck you, you were just saying how Amazing You Are!”

“Didn’t you F * cking change your words too!”

...

After a series of arguments, Wen er finally lent his wind chasing stallion to Qin Yu.

This was a group of fiery horses with fiery red light under their feet. Although they weren’t as domineering as Ling Yun’s mount, they were extremely capable.

“Damn it, you have to return it to me. Otherwise, I’ll Have My Grandfather Beat You Up!”Wen Er said reluctantly.

Qin Yu smiled. “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely return it to you!”

That day, Qin Yu planned to set off for Yang City.

At this moment, a piece of news came over:

The Tianyun sect had restarted their plan to capture Qin Yu. This time, they would send even more top-notch martial artist to kill Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu, what kind of deep hatred do you have with the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”Wen Da picked his nose and asked curiously.

“Damn it, you can’t die. Don’t Kill my wind chasing Colt!”Wen Er said hurriedly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He knew that the Heavenly Cloud sect had great influence in the entire South Province.

Although there were a few people who didn’t put the Heavenly Cloud sect in their eyes, such an existence was really too few.

Now that the Tianyun sect had released such news, it would definitely bring Qin Yu a lot of trouble. It might even make his journey extremely difficult.

“Tianyun sect...”Qin Yu muttered softly. At this moment, he suddenly thought of an idea.

Following that, Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Wen er and Wen er and said, “Brother Wen, do me a favor.”

“No!”Wen Da hurriedly shook his head.

Qin Yu ignored his rejection and said in a deep voice, “I want to challenge Ling Yun.”

“Challenge him?”Wen Da was taken aback.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and said, “Just say that I will wait for him in Yang City. If he doesn’t dare to come, the title of the number one disciple in South Province will change hands.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Although the Wen brothers didn’t know what Qin Yu wanted to do, they, who liked to join in the fun, agreed without a second thought.

The next day, Qin Yu rode on his wind-chasing stallion and rushed towards Yang City.

The news of Qin Yu issuing a letter of challenge to Ling Yun also spread quickly.

This news seemed to have grown ears, and it didn’t take long for it to reach Ling Yun’s ears.

In an extremely luxurious mansion in the Heavenly Cloud sect.

In this mansion, there were eight maids standing at the door. They were dressed extremely well, but their faces were filled with fear.

Beside them lay the corpse of a maidservant. Her death was extremely cruel. Her heart was pierced through and her face was shattered. It was almost impossible to tell what she looked like.

The reason for her death was because she coughed.

The owner of the mansion was none other than Ling Yun.

“Qin Yu has already issued a challenge to you. This matter has caused a huge commotion,”a tall, white-bearded elder said coldly.

This person was none other than the first elder of the Tianyun sect. He was also Ling Yun’s Master!

His status was extremely high, and he was one of the top existences in the entire Tianyun sect.

Ling Yun gritted his teeth and said, “I’ve wanted to kill him personally for a long time!”

The first elder looked at Ling Yun and said in a deep voice, “Ever since Di Zun arrived, the sect master has placed more attention on him. Even that trash, elder Bai, has risen with the tide.”

“Therefore, you have to kill Qin Yu. Otherwise, not only will you fall out of favor, I might not even be able to hold on to my position as the first Elder.”
