2486 The Worry about the Anomaly

However, Qin Yu had a feeling of being suppressed by the Path of Heaven which made him feel powerless for a moment.

It was like an adult holding a knife facing a youngster holding a gun.

Although he could threaten the youngster’s strength, he did not stand a chance against a youngster with high precision.

“Martial Uncle Gu has long deeply comprehended the Way of Water. Her attack just now seemed to be compatible with the Path of Heaven of water. Even my power of time could not withstand that brute and reckless force.”

Flower Granny was also shocked.

“The Tribulation Fifth Level realm is indeed elusive and endless. The gap is as vast as the heavens. However, it’s indeed the case. If she can advance further, it would be the legendary alignment with the Path of Heaven, oneness of man and heaven.”

Lei Xin sighed with emotion and said. Only cultivators in this cultivation realm could be called immortals.

“Dean Lei, is there still any room for discussion regarding the alliance?”

Ji Yue hesitated for a moment and asked.

“Since Revered Qi has spoken, I naturally have to obey. However, I can guarantee one thing about Revered Qi. At his level of strength, he’s scornful of deceitful schemes.”

“After all, he is a supreme higher-up. It would indeed be a headache if he were to use some tricks.”

Ji Yue sighed. How troublesome it was to deal with villains.

“I really don’t know who recorded the images in Nanzhou and submitted them to the eight great forces. Our Human Race Watch has just been established for a short period, and they’re now targeting us like this?”

This time, Qin Yu agreed with Revered Qi’s action because not everyone knew the inside story of this part.

No one would be rest assured about such a thing, so he did not resist it.

“I’ll send the news out then. A group of people may leave.”

Ji Yue smiled bitterly and hurriedly prepared for the matter.

“What if I leave the Human Race Watch? Will it eliminate these troubles?”

Qin Yu turned to look at Lei Xin and Flower Granny.

Lei Xin shook his head with a bitter smile.

From afar, a figure loomed above, exuding a sharp, indomitable, unmatched dominance that seemed suffocating for a moment.

Despite being a slender silhouette, it emanated an irresistible sense of immense power.

“Teng Zixu?”

As he appeared, Qin Yu felt his divine sense lock onto him.

“Qin Yu, you have plenty of treasures now. Although a person like Revered Qi might not be interested in the magical artifacts you have, they will definitely increase the strength of the alien race if they fall into their hands. I suspect it’s not just the incidents of Nanzhou, but more information might have already been given to Revered Qi.”

The moment Flower Granny saw Teng Zixu appear, she had already guessed something.

Xiao Yu.

The masked woman of the nine lifetimes had disappeared for a long time. Her relationship with Qin Yu might have spread to Revered Qi. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The records of Nanzhou showed that the masked woman of nine lifetimes had helped Qin Yu, as well as the relationship between the masked woman and Xiao Yu. It would not be difficult if one deliberately wanted to collect this information.

“Qin Yu, Revered Qi has reached the realm of at least the Tribulation Sixth level. At this cultivation realm, his power has fused with heaven and earth. The experts of the demon, monster, and ghost realm have long targeted him. Although he won’t easily make a move, his decision can’t be changed.”

Flower Granny reminded Qin Yu directly.

He still wanted to resist in the face of Revere Qi was not resistance, but courting death.

Qin Yu’s expression was tremendously ugly.

Although it was for the stability of the overall situation of the human race, nobody could endure the connection between a human cultivator and the higher-ups of the other three alien races.

However, practices like surveillance were truly unacceptable to him.

“After we parted in purgatory, your current progress is truly disappointing. In my opinion, the path of anomaly, only Xiao Sheng can be considered one of the few.”

Teng Zixu raised his saber and pointed in the air.

Qin Yu did not refute this.

After the Golden Path of Heaven was released, Teng Zixu’s strength increased at a tremendously terrifying speed.

Previously, when the demon race invaded, he had fought to a draw with Xiao Sheng, who had severely injured the Ni family’s Holy Lord.

Now, he had become the most dazzling young man of the current generation. He had also become the person Revered Qi valued the most in the alliance.

“If you make any move that betrays the human race, I will kill you directly.”

Teng Zixu said softly.

“Bullsh*t, what are you pretending for?”

Chang Mang could not take it anymore and started cursing.

“Chang Mang, forget it. My current strength is indeed inferior to his.”

Qin Yu stopped Chang Mang.

The group returned to Huaning Mountain.

After everyone left, Flower Granny stopped Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue. She frowned and asked Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, do you still remember the conversation I had with you before?”

Qin Yu nodded.

“Why are you so obsessed with the path of anomaly? Actually, what Teng Zixu said is true. If you return to the orthodox path of cultivation, with the power of the soul, whether you cultivate the Way of Thunder and Lightning or the Way of Space, you will soon reach the top level.”

Flower Granny asked with a frown.

“Flower Granny, at that time, when I was about to break through to the fifth level, I wanted to merge my soul mark to the sea of the Path of Heaven. However, my father’s remnant consciousness stopped me. Perhaps he discovered something and wanted me to walk on this path of anomaly.”

If there was one person in this world who could make him completely lose faith, it would definitely be his father.

Without him, Qin Yu would have died countless times by now.

“And I dislike the feeling of bowing to the Path of Heaven. Don’t worry, Flower Granny. Although I’m not talented, I still have Ruoxue to protect me if I fail in this path.”

Qin Yu had also been trying to figure out ways to break away from the sea of the Path of Heaven.

The power of his acupoints, his chaotic demon fusion, and the power of annihilation, although he had yet to break through their limits, he felt that this path of anomaly would definitely surprise him.

“Since you’ve made your choice, I won’t stop you. However, you must understand that if the war worsens, you won’t have much time left.”

Flower Granny sighed.

There was a drawback if the soul had not fused with the human race’s Path of Heaven.

Even if it was not tied to the cosmic luck of the human race, just like Xiao Sheng’s cultivation was not affected when he left the human race and joined the demon race.

It would naturally cause the higher-ups to be wary. It would naturally cause some alarm when it reached a certain level.

Especially in Qin Yu’s current situation, sending Teng Zixu to keep an eye on Qin Yu indicated the attitude of the higher-ups.

“I hope I’m the one worrying. One more thing. Don’t use the divine artifact you obtained from the ghost realm, the Judge’s Brush. If you do, this magical artifact will no longer be yours.”

Flower Granny reminded him again.
