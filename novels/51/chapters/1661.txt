Chapter 1662: Chapter 1,662, discussing Dao 1 with Xiao Sheng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This was a very serious problem. The strength of an elementalist was simply unknown.

As for the strength of the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, no one knew. Everything was just a legend.

The outcome of the two of them was related to the future of the southern region. Qin Yu could not help but worry.

Xiao Sheng was silent for a long time. Then, he stood up and said, “I’m confident, but I’m not 100% confident.”

Qin Yu sighed slightly. As expected, even someone as powerful as Xiao Sheng might not be able to defeat that elementalist.

“What are your plans next?”Xiao Sheng suddenly asked.

Qin Yu said, “Cultivate. No one knows when the elementalist will make a comeback. Before that, try to increase your strength.”

Xiao Sheng grunted in gratitude. Then, he sat down again and began to discuss with Qin Yu.

It had to be said that after interacting with him, Xiao Sheng’s state of mind was extremely profound. His understanding of life was not something that an ordinary person could compare to.

After interacting with him, he realized that Xiao Sheng was not as high and mighty as he imagined. On the contrary, he treated Qin Yu as an equal and discussed with him.

“If I can kill an elementalist, I might need your help in the future,”Xiao Sheng suddenly said.

“Help? What can I help you with?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Xiao Sheng stood up and said, “I want you to help me save a person and my son.”

“Save your son?”Qin Yu was stunned.

His son was killed by Qin Yu. How could he be saved?

“Do you have a way to bring a dead person back?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“I don’t have a way. Elementalists do,”Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

The methods of the immortal slaying sect were mysterious and unpredictable. If an elementalist obtained their inheritance, it was indeed possible.

“Is this the reason why you didn’t kill me back then? Because you knew that there was a chance to bring someone back to life?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“Sort of,”Xiao Sheng said slowly.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Okay. If I can do it, I will help you.”

It was a misunderstanding in itself, so it was understandable to save him.

“I have another question,”Qin Yu said.

“With your talent and ability, why don’t you go to the Central Plains?”

Xiao Sheng seemed to have expected it. He turned his back to Qin Yu and said indifferently, “This world is not as simple as you think. There are also high and low talents.”

“For example, your special constitution, and those who have powerful bloodlines in their bodies. These people are the top geniuses in this world. I’m not. I’m just a mortal, an extremely ordinary person.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Any bloodline has a source. Those who stand at the source are also the most powerful people. Most of these people don’t have any special constitutions.”

“Maybe,”Xiao Sheng said with a sigh.

“In order to prove the dao, talent, hard work, and opportunity are indispensable. In this great world, you and I might be alive today, but we might die tomorrow.”

Qin Yu looked at Xiao Sheng and said, “So, you are afraid of death, so you don’t go to the Central Plains?”

“Of course not.”Xiao Sheng shook his head.

“I admit that the resources in the southern plains are limited and not as good as the central plains, but I believe that the southern plains that you and I see is not the real southern plains.”

After saying this, Xiao Sheng sat down again.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “During this period of time, I have traveled through more than half of the southern region. I have also discovered many mysterious caves that have not been discovered. I have even discovered small worlds. Any one of them has benefited me greatly.”

“I don’t know how many great cultivators have appeared in the Holy Region. How many treasures have you and I discovered that they left behind?”

This was the truth. Many heavenly treasures were found when they were traveling.

“If you have time, I suggest you go to the Eastern Wilderness,”Xiao Sheng suddenly said.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said in surprise, “Where is the Eastern Wilderness?”

“Go find it yourself. Everything depends on luck,”Xiao Sheng stood up and said.

“By the way, if you have time, you can go to the Tianyun sect’s book collection pavilion. It records the past of the Southern Region.”

After saying that, Xiao Sheng turned around and left.

Qin Yu looked at Xiao Sheng and felt that he could not see through him.

This person seemed to be extremely mysterious and seemed to be hiding many secrets.

As for the East Wilderness that Xiao Sheng mentioned, Qin Yu was rather interested.

The small worlds that he mentioned were mostly not visible to the naked eye, but Qin Yu was able to discover the hidden mystic realm.

The next day.

Qin Yu said goodbye to Wen Wanyi and the rest, then headed straight for the Heavenly Cloud sect.

After this battle, Qin Yu had become a famous person in the South Province. No matter where he went, people would warmly greet him. Helpless, Qin Yu could only buy a cloak and put it on himself, to avoid unnecessary trouble. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After arriving at the Tianyun sect, Qin Yu found the deputy sect master and stated his purpose of coming.

“Book Collection Pavilion?”When the deputy sect master heard it, he couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

“As far as I know, most of the Tianyun sect’s book collection pavilions are for disciples to cultivate in. To you, they are not very useful.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “It was sect master who asked me to come. As for whether I can gain anything, that will depend on fate.”

The deputy sect master didn’t say anything more and immediately brought Qin Yu to the library of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

At the same time, the Dead River was still systematically shortening the distance.

The speed at which the Dead River disappeared seemed to have exceeded everyone’s imagination. The entire Li Prefecture seemed to be about to merge into one.

At this moment, on the side of the northern lands, Sima Bei and the others were standing there, quietly looking at the Dead River in front of them.

“At this speed, I’m afraid that it won’t be long before the river of death completely disappears.”Sima bei said in a deep voice.

Yong Ji said in a deep voice, “According to your calculations, how long will it take?”

“Less than a hundred days.”Sima bei said.

He Teng said in a gloomy voice, “Everyone says that this river of death can not be crossed, but I feel that this is only a legend... if I wear the bones of a saint on my body, don’t tell me I won’t be able to cross it?”

Sima bei glanced at he teng and said, “If you are a saint, you can naturally cross it, but if you wear the saint’s Bone, I’m afraid you can’t cross it.”

“This Dead River is extremely strange. No matter what kind of treasure you wear, it can not resist the erosion of the Dead River.”

He Teng sneered. Obviously, he did not believe it at all.

“Speaking of which, I really want to give it a try...”he teng muttered in a low voice, his face revealing madness.

Sima bei snorted coldly and said, “Don’t think too highly of yourself. If you didn’t have the hunter organization’s white bone staff on you, you wouldn’t have the qualifications to become the godly king of the northern lands.”

He Teng ignored Sima Bei’s ridicule. He raised his foot and strode into the Dead River.

“If that Xiao Hai can do it, I might be able to do it,”he teng said coldly.
