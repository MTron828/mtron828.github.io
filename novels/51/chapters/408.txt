Chapter 409: Wei Ming’s Request Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Zhang Yin’s words instantly made Yan Sihai spit out a mouthful of water.

“Qin Yu... actually dared to hit you?” Yan Sihai’s eyes widened.

Zhang Yin nodded. She pointed at her own face and said, “Not only did he hit me, but he also insulted me. Hubby, no matter what, we must get rid of Qin Yu!”

Yan Sihai’s eyes narrowed slightly.

It was obvious that Qin Yu’s arrogance had exceeded his imagination.

“We really can’t let Qin Yu live!” A killing intent flashed through Yan Sihai’s eyes.

...

The news of Qin Yu killing more than a dozen Inner Strength Grandmasters finally spread on the Martial Arts Forum.

For a moment, all kinds of rumors appeared on the forum.

Some people said that there was someone powerful backing Qin Yu, and some people said that it wasn’t Qin Yu who made a move that day, but someone backing him.

But in the end, all these theories were dispelled one by one and one theory prevailed.

That was, the reason why Qin Yu’s strength soared was because of the Meridian Circulation Technique he obtained on the stairway to heaven!

It was as if someone was adding fuel to the flames in the dark, and countless people were exaggerating the use of the Meridian Circulation Technique.

“This is clearly someone deliberately hyping things up,” Yao Qing said in a deep voice as he looked at the posts on the forum.

“That’s right. Someone wants to kill me with someone else’s hands.”

“After all, only Mr. Qin has obtained the Meridian Circulation Technique. No one knows how effective it will be.”

“If it’s really like what they said, then there will definitely be people who will be greedy and do something underhanded to obtain the Meridian Circulation Technique.”

At this point, Yao Qing looked at Qin Yu and said with some anxiety, “Mr. Qin, shouldn’t we respond? At least to clarify the truth.”

Qin Yu stretched and said, “Yes, we should respond. Um... Yao Qing, help me write a post and say... this cultivation technique has indeed brought me great benefits.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Yao Qing and Taozi immediately widened their eyes.

“Mr. Qin, aren’t you... aren’t you bringing trouble upon yourself?” Yao Qing said in puzzlement.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “That’s right, I want them to kill me.”

At the moment, Qin Yu just couldn’t find a good way to cultivate.

Someone trying to kill him was a good opportunity.

As long as he had the Heaven Swallowing Technique in hand, the more people came, the more excited Qin Yu would be.

Yao Qing didn’t quite understand Qin Yu’s intentions and stood there waiting for Qin Yu to answer him.

However, Qin Yu only waved his hand and said, “Do as I say.”

“Oh right, tell them my whereabouts. I will go to Yunchuan City in the near future.”

Yao Qing wanted to ask something, but was interrupted by Qin Yu with a wave of his hand.

With no other choice, Yao Qing could only do as Qin Yu said.

His response naturally caused a huge uproar.

For a moment, the Martial Arts Forum was discussing the Meridian Circulation Technique.

...

The next day, Qin Yu packed up and prepared to head to Yunchuan City.

Qin Yu had never forgotten Yan Jiang.

He had helped Qin Yu through many difficult times. This favor was something Qin Yu would never forget.

“Cao Shan, it’s time for you to pay the price.” A cold glint flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

Just as Qin Yu was about to set off for Yunchuan City, his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up his phone and saw that the caller was Wei Ming, whom he hadn’t contacted for a long time!

Back when Qin Yu was in trouble, Wei Ming had insisted on standing on Qin Yu’s side. In the end, he was severely injured by Jiang Gu.

From then on, there was no longer any contact between the two of them.

Now, when Wei Ming suddenly called, Qin Yu was somewhat surprised.

He picked up the phone and said with a smile, “Wei Ming, why did you suddenly call me?”

On the other end, Wei Ming stammered, “Mr. Qin, have you been busy recently?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “If you have anything, just say it. There’s no need to be so polite.”

Wei Ming was silent for a moment and said, “I do have something I want to ask you for help with. I don’t know if it’s convenient for you.”

“Alright, go ahead.” Qin Yu agreed without hesitation. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Wei Ming also heaved a sigh of relief.

He told Qin Yu everything that had happened.

Ever since they had offended Jiang Gu, the Wei family had suffered a huge blow. Their family was practically in decline.

Although Qin Yu and Jiang Gu had made peace after that, no one cared about the insignificant Wei family.

Now, the Wei family’s father and son were supporting the Wei family with all their might. Many businesses needed to be personally negotiated by Wei Ming.

“I’m meeting a business partner tonight, but the other party has a powerful background and a high status. I’d like to invite you to accompany me,” Wei Ming said.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Of course. Tell me the time and place.”

Wei Ming was instantly overjoyed and quickly told Qin Yu the time and place.

Then, Wei Ming said with gratitude, “Thank you, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu said apologetically, “Wei Ming, you don’t have to be so polite. If it weren’t for me, the Wei family wouldn’t have become like this.”

After he hung up the phone, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Who knew how many close friends had gradually become estranged because of the change in status?

Because he had promised Wei Ming, Qin Yu’s trip to Yunchuan City naturally had to be delayed by a day.

In the evening, Qin Yu drove to the hotel according to the address Wei Ming gave him.

By the time Qin Yu arrived at the hotel, Wei Ming had been waiting there early on.

When he saw Qin Yu, Wei Ming quickly got up and said respectfully, “Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

During this year, Wei Ming seemed to have experienced a lot.

Qin Yu tried to sense Wei Ming’s internal qi and found that he was stuck in the Inner Strength Past Master realm.

“You... encountered a bottleneck?” Qin Yu frowned.

Wei Ming waved his hand and said with a bitter smile, “After this ordeal, how can I have time to cultivate?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu felt even more guilty.

Wei Ming was once someone of influence in the provincial capital, but no one expected him to fall into such a state now.

“I’m sorry, I was insensitive, but... why didn’t you look for me?” Qin Yu frowned.

Wei Ming forced a smile and said, “My father and you had a falling out back then, so how could I have the face to look for you?”

Qin Yu didn’t know what to say for a moment.

“Alright, let’s not talk about the past. Mr. Qin, I’m already very grateful that you came to help me,” Wei Ming said with a smile.

“As long as we can seal this business deal, the Wei family has a chance to make a comeback,” Wei Ming said proudly.

Qin Yu nodded. He patted Wei Ming’s shoulder and said, “I’ll give Jiang Gu a heads up.”

As the two of them were talking, someone suddenly pushed the door open and entered the room.

Then, a young man swaggered in.

Seeing this young man, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Because he was none other than the young man who had flirted with Fang Yue that day!

“It’s you?!” After seeing Qin Yu, anger flashed across the young man’s face!
