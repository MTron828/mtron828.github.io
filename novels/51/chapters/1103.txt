Chapter 1104: Chapter 1104, the strange flower 

After Xiao Yuan disappeared, the world in front of him slowly returned to peace.

Qin Yu looked at the wounds on his body and frowned. “The wounds are real. This means that what happened just now was not an illusion.”

This made Qin Yu a little worried.

What If Chang Mang and the others could not hold on?

The strength of these people shouldn’t be as strong as the internal Qi, Qin Yu thought to himself.

He stood there quietly and waited for a moment.

Ten minutes later, Qin Yu finally felt an internal Qi.

This internal Qi was Chang Mang. The moment he saw Qin Yu, he clenched his fist and rushed forward without a word.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He quickly clenched his fist and shouted, “Chang Mang! I’m Qin Yu! Everything just now was fake!”

Chang Mang only regained his senses after hearing Qin Yu’s words.

He hurriedly walked forward and said, “I thought that fake you had not disappeared yet.”

Qin Yu glanced at Chang Mang and realized that his body was also covered in blood marks.

It was very obvious that he had also fallen into a battle of anxiety.

Not long after, Yao Meng and the others slowly appeared.

Their bodies were all stained with different wounds. Zhuang Teng’s internal Qi was even weaker.

“He almost died. How terrifying...”Zhuang Teng said, panting heavily.

Qin Yu deliberately glanced at Xiao Yuan. He found that although Xiao Yuan was injured, his internal Qi was not weakened at all.

“This Xiao Yuan is really not simple,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

“What about the old man?”Kong Yun asked at this moment.

Qin Yu hurriedly looked around and found that the old man had disappeared without a trace.

“Obviously, he’s already dead,”Chu Hedao said.

“With his strength, it’s impossible for him to withstand it.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh and said, “What a pity.”

Besides the old man, there were two other people who died in this battle.

“What secret technique is this? I’ve never heard of it,”Chang Mang said in a deep voice.

“I don’t know. There are many secret techniques in this world that we have never seen before,”Qin Yu said.

Then, Qin Yu looked at everyone and said, “Everyone, be careful. Don’t get separated.”

Everyone nodded. Their expressions were tense. Compared to just now, they were clearly much more nervous.

They continued to move forward for a few kilometers. The Fog in front of them began to slowly dissipate.

The world of the Cloud Dragon Island appeared in front of everyone.

There was a large field of flowers in front of them. Inside the field of flowers were incomparably bright flowers.

If one smelled carefully, they would be able to smell a faint fragrance. If one released their divine sense, they would be able to sense the mysterious aura emitted by the flowers. This was the internal Qi of the flower.

“This... is the strange flower?”Qin Yu exclaimed.

“It should be right.”Yao Meng nodded.

“I’ve seen pictures of the strange flower before. It’s no different from the flower in front of me.”

“It’s that simple? I thought it was that difficult,”Kong Yun couldn’t help but say.

Then, he moved closer to the flower field.

Qin Yu reached out to stop Kong Yun and shook his head. “I’m afraid it’s not that simple.”

Kong yun smiled and said, “Qin Yu, aren’t you being too cautious? What danger is there in front of you?”

Qin Yu pointed at the ground with his chin and said, “Look at what this is.”

He looked down and saw dried bones on the ground.

This was enough to prove that someone had come here and died here.

Kong Yun’s expression changed slightly. He took a step back and said with a frown, “Bones, looks like someone died here.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Don’t forget what that old man said. There are demonic beasts here. The most terrifying one is the cloud dragon,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Rumble...”

Before he finished his sentence, the entire Cloud Dragon Island suddenly shook violently!

A stream of light streaked across the horizon and took shape in front of Qin Yu and the others.

A man with a strange appearance appeared in front of everyone.

This man had dragon horns on his head and was dressed in white. He looked mysterious and unfathomable.

“No one is allowed to enter the Cloud Dragon Island. It’s not too late to leave now,”the man said coldly.

“Who are you?”Chang Mang asked with a puzzled look.

Before the man could speak, Qin Yu guessed, “You must be that Demonic Beast Cloud Dragon, right?”

The man glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “That’s right. Leave Now, and I won’t kill you.”

“What big words!”Kong Yun shook the long spear in his hand, looking like he was ready to fight.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Rumor has it that there is a sleeping ancient mighty figure on Cloud Dragon Island. If I’m not wrong, you should be the pet of that ancient mighty figure?”

Yun long frowned slightly and said coldly, “It has nothing to do with you. Leave now, or don’t blame me for being rude!”

Qin Yu ignored his words and continued, “This strange flower in front of him is also used to let him recover his strength, right?”

Yun Long’s expression became a little unnatural.

He narrowed his eyes and sized up Qin Yu. “You know too much.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Normally speaking, we shouldn’t have come to Cloud Dragon Island. After all, this is considered robbery and immoral.”

Yun long snorted and said, “Since you know, then leave quickly.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m really sorry. The world of cultivators is cruel. It’s even more common to kill people and steal goods.”

“We came all the way here. We can’t go back empty-handed. How about this? You give us each one of the strange flowers and we’ll leave. How about it?”
