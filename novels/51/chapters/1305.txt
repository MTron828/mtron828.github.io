Chapter 1306: Chapter 1306, Huangji Mountain! 

Wen Da had a loyal look on his face as he patted his chest non-stop.

Wen Er, on the other hand, said, “I think you’re looking for an excuse to flirt with him, right? Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking.”

Elder Wen’s face turned red. He coughed dryly and said, “Nonsense. I’m obviously trying to help brother Qin. Don’t even think about trying to sow discord between us!”

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he watched from the side.

Although these two people were prodigals and had simple personalities, they were more like two living treasures.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. At this time, the auction had already begun. One after another, treasures were brought onto the stage.

The first one was hundred refined armor. This armor was made of black iron. It was extremely hard, but it didn’t have much meaning to Qin Yu.

The hundred refined armor was finally sold for 300,000 spirit coins. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The second item was the moon-supporting mystic fruit. It was a true treasure fruit and a must-have item for many herbs. The price was 250,000 spirit coins.

The third and fourth items were all quite unusual treasures. The prices were mostly around 500,000 spirit coins.

As one treasure after another was carried onto the stage, more and more extraordinary items appeared in front of Qin Yu.

Many of the treasures made Qin Yu’s heart beat faster, but he ultimately held it in.

There was no other reason. Qin Yu had to prepare sufficient bullets to buy the aura of life that could appear at any time.

One treasure after another was brought onto the stage. Wen Da and Wen Er had already bid for a total of six treasures.

The prices of these six treasures were extremely expensive, and the Wen brothers did not even know what the purpose of the treasures they had bid for was. The only reason they had bought them was to show off their wealth, it was convenient for Big Wen to pick up girls later.

In just a short hour, these two clowns had already spent tens of millions.

Such wealth indeed shocked Qin Yu.

After he robbed the stone gambling shop, he only spent tens of millions.

“TSK tsk, comparing people really pisses me off,”Qin Yu sighed.

At this moment, the auctioneer took out a transparent glass box.

There was a ball of flame inside the box. The flame was dark and cold white in color. It didn’t have much momentum, but it was extremely strange.

“This is the Huangji Buddha Flame. I believe that many seniors have come for this item,”the auctioneer said with a smile.

The instant the Huangji Buddha Flame appeared, the treasures hanging in the corner also began to tremble slightly. It was as if they were prepared to act at any time. This was enough to prove how important this item was to the auction.

“The Huangji Buddha Flame was taken from the Huangji Mountain. This item does not appear once every thousand years. There are rumors that this item came from an important figure within the Huangji Mountain,”the auctioneer introduced.

The atmosphere at the scene became somewhat hot. Many people stared at the Huangji Buddha Flame with fiery eyes.

Qin Yu was the same. Although he did not know what the use of this Huangji Buddha Flame was, Qin Yu had a natural love for any flame.

Perhaps it was because of the spiritual fire in his body, or perhaps it was because he was a pharmacist himself, but in short, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with anticipation.

“I wonder how much this item is worth.”Qin Yu touched the black card in his hand and thought to himself.

Since this item was so valued, it must be very expensive.

“Why, Do You Like It?”Wen Da Poked Qin Yu’s arm.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I’m a little interested.”

“The price of this thing is not cheap,”Wen da muttered.

Qin Yu asked, “Brother Wen, do you know about this thing?”

“Of course! There is nothing in the world that I, Wen Da, don’t know!”Wen Da said smugly.

Qin Yu followed his words and asked, “What exactly is the use of this thing?”

Wen da said proudly, “The auctioneer is right. Huangji Buddha Flame indeed came from Huangji Mountain. You should know what Huangji Mountain means, right?”

Qin Yu shook his head, indicating that he didn’t know.

Wen da said in surprise, “You don’t know Huangji Mountain?”

“I really don’t know,”Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Wen Da replied with an ‘Oh’, he continued, “Huangji Mountain is one of the most famous places in Li Prefecture. Rumor has it that many important figures have fallen here. Their corpses are in Huangji Mountain. Among them, there are no lack of saints or even great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage.”

Qin Yu heard this and immediately exclaimed in surprise, “Is there no one who would go and explore such a place?”

“Of course there are, and there are many of them. But since ancient times, no one has been able to come out,”Wen da continued.

“Even saints have to die if they go in,”Wen er added.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

Even a saint would die if he entered? What exactly was hidden in the Huangji Mountain?

“That’s why, the things that come out of the Huangji Mountain are all extraordinary.”Wen Da said with a smile.

“As for the Huangji Buddhic Flame, some people say that it is formed from the corpse qi of important figures, while others say that it is a flame that comes out of the Huangji Mountain on its own. In short, this item is extremely rare. If one can devour this item, one’s strength would definitely increase greatly.”

Qin Yu, who was originally interested in the Huangji Buddha Flame, became even more restless after hearing these words.

He looked around and discovered that many people’s eyes were burning with passion.

“Looks like many people are here for the Huangji Buddha Flame.”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice.
