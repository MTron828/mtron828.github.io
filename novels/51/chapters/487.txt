Chapter 488: Qin Yu Came Out Of Seclusion! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Fifth Elder had been calculating the time.

He knew very clearly that if these alchemists really left, then the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would be completely disbanded.

This was the painstaking legacy of the Pavilion Master!

Therefore, the Fifth Elder would rather bear infamy than let these alchemists leave!

“You did well.” The First Elder patted the Fifth Elder on the shoulder.

The Fifth Elder didn’t speak.

Although they were both elders, First Elder was a Law Enforcement Elder. He was a representative of strength and wasn’t someone he could contend with.

Although the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had temporarily calmed down, they didn’t acknowledge First Elder at all in their hearts.

On the Pavilion Master’s building, First Elder leaped up.

He sat on the seat that the Pavilion Master had once sat on and gently stroked this rattan chair. Satisfaction appeared on his face.

“Is this how being the Pavilion Master feels?” The First Elder sat on the rocking chair and gazed into the distance as he said nonchalantly.

Sitting here, he could overlook the entire Qinghe Town!

This feeling of being high and mighty caused the First Elder to get carried away.

After sitting here for a long time, the First Elder turned around and walked out.

He came all the way to a side room of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

This was the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s confinement room, but now, it had become the prison that imprisoned the Second Elder.

“Haven’t you figured it out yet?” The First Elder looked at the Second Elder, who was covered in blood, and said indifferently.

The Second Elder gritted his teeth and said, “You traitor, you aren’t a human! You are a beast!”

“The Pavilion Master trusts you so much, but you actually committed such a betrayal. You will die a horrible death!”

The First Elder wasn’t angry. He smiled nonchalantly and said, “Ji Yuhong is already in the past. From today onwards, I am the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“Is it worth it for you to suffer such hardship for a person who is already in the past?”

The Second Elder grinned coldly and said, “Don’t be arrogant too early! Qin Yu will come out of seclusion soon!”

“After he comes out of seclusion, you will die without a doubt!”

The First Elder laughed. “Do you think I am afraid of him? He is just a low-level person, so how can he be my opponent?”

The Second Elder gritted his teeth and said, “As long as Qin Yu steps into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm, you will die for sure!”

“Really? I want to see it,” the First Elder said gloomily.

“I will give you one last night. If you still insist, then don’t blame me for being merciless!”

After saying this, the First Elder turned around and left.

In the past few days, the First Elder had also tried to break open the warehouse’s door, but unfortunately, he had failed.

Helpless, he thought of calling for reinforcements.

He had originally wanted to go to the Saint Confucian Sect, but on second thought, weren’t there ten half-step Martial Marquises near the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?

As long as they were around, then Qin Yu would die without a doubt!

Thus, the First Elder immediately found the half-step Martial Marquises from the Hong Yi Sect, and the two sides immediately reached an agreement!

As long as Qin Yu came out of seclusion, these ten half-step Martial Marquises would immediately step into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and get rid of Qin Yu!

Time passed by minute by minute, and the once glorious Divine Alchemist Pavilion seemed to be in decline at this moment.

And the Pavilion Master’s condition in the Saint Confucian Sect was even worse. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After a few days, she didn’t even drink a single mouthful of water. Her lips had already lost their color.

“Ji Yuhong, if you are willing to beg me, I might give you another chance.” Gu Canghai stood at the entrance of the prison and said indifferently.

Ji Yuhong glanced at Gu Canghai and said expressionlessly, “Gu Canghai, it seems that you have forgotten how you knelt in front of me and begged for mercy back then.”

At this point, Ji Yuhong paused for a moment and said with a nonchalant smile, “Why didn’t you personally go to crusade against the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? Is it because you still don’t dare to face the psychological trauma from back then even today?”

When this topic was brought up, Gu Canghai’s expression turned somewhat ugly.

Just as Ji Yuhong had said, even though he had stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, there was always a trace of unspeakable terror in his heart when facing Ji Yuhong.

“Ji Yuhong, don’t think that I don’t dare to kill you!” Gu Canghai said coldly.

“If you dared, you would have done it long ago,” the Pavilion Master said with a nonchalant smile.

“As long as you kill me, no one will know that the sect master of the Saint Confucian Sect once knelt in front of a woman and cried bitterly while begging for mercy.”

Gu Canghai’s face instantly turned ashen, and veins popped out on his forehead!

“Indeed, I don’t dare to kill you, but I can still torture you!” Gu Canghai gnashed his teeth and said.

Gu Canghai extended his finger, and a few rays of light entered the Pavilion Master’s body.

In an instant, the Pavilion Master’s body became limp and powerless, and she lay on the ground while unable to move.

“I will let you slowly suffer humiliation!” Gu Canghai sneered.

“Didn’t you keep yourself a virgin for that person? Today, I will let you experience the joy of the human world!”

A trace of fear finally flashed across the Pavilion Master’s face.

She wanted to say something, but couldn’t say a word.

Gu Canghai turned around and walked out of the prison.

He looked at Elder Qu outside the door and said coldly, “I’ll leave Ji Yuhong to you. As long as you keep her alive, you can do whatever you want.”

Elder Qu’s eyes immediately lit up and he said excitedly, “Sect master, is what you said true?”

“What do you think?” Gu Canghai said with a cold expression.

Elder Qu immediately rejoiced, “Thank you, Sect Master!”

Elder Qu ran in anxiously.

Outside the door, Gu Canghai’s expression was extremely ugly.

He and Ji Yuhong had a grudge for many years, but unfortunately, the position of the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was too high in society, so Gu Canghai had no chance to take revenge.

This time, he had finally grasped the opportunity.

In the prison, Elder Qu ran towards the Pavilion Master excitedly.

All men had the desire to conquer, and Elder Qu was no exception.

Facing an incomparably powerful woman like the Pavilion Master, his lust almost drove him crazy.

“Pavilion Master... I’m coming!” Elder Qu cried out in a creepy voice and pounced towards the Pavilion Master.

At this moment, the door suddenly opened.

Three men in suits walked in with large strides.

Elder Qu frowned and asked, “Who are you people?”

The other party said coldly, “People from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. We want to take Ji Yuhong away.”

Elder Qu was stunned and said somewhat unwillingly, “Then... then can you wait for a while? Let me finish my business first...”

“Do you want to die?” The three people immediately said coldly.

Elder Qu’s expression changed.

Although he was unwilling, he could only retreat to the side.

...

In the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s warehouse, Qin Yu’s crystal clear body began to slowly take shape.

Threads of light came from all directions and finally fell into his body.

At this moment, his dantian also began to change.

His spiritual power increased exponentially at this moment!

Level after level of golden light appeared on his body.

The golden light continued to cover Qin Yu’s body.

Level 1, Level 2, level 3... There was a total of 108 levels!

Under the cover of more than 100 levels of golden light, Qin Yu’s body seemed to be plated with gold as it shonein the darkness!

“Buzz!”

The light from Qin Yu’s body burst out from inside out. In a moment, his body slowly returned to its original state.

At the same time, Qin Yu’s eyes finally opened!

He slowly stood up and clenched his fist. An overwhelming power surged out!
