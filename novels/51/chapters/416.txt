Chapter 417: Bury the Hatchet? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

No one had expected that the aggressive “Qing Yao” wasn’t Jiang He’s disciple at all.

Instead, he was using Jiang He’s reputation as a ruse.

However, Yao Qing’s thick skin was admirable.

In the next few days, Qin Yu still didn’t leave Yunchuan City.

He waited here for those who would come to kill him.

Two days later, at night, Elder Zhuo and the others gathered once again.

They had already made a thorough plan and even made a comprehensive analysis of Qin Yu’s advantage.

“Qin Yu’s strength is only his physical body. Excluding his physical body, his other aspects are not worth mentioning,” Elder Zhuo said.

Huang Biao snorted. “In terms of physical strength, I don’t believe that he can surpass me.”

“Mr. Huang, we know that you are a great Cross-training Grandmaster and that your physical strength is unparalleled. However, this matter is of great importance. It’s best not to act rashly. It’s best to be cautious,” someone advised.

Huang Biao snorted coldly. Although he agreed on the surface, he felt defiant inside.

How could Huang Biao, who had always prided himself on having a strong physical body, miss such an opportunity?

If he used his physical body to defeat Qin Yu, Huang Biao’s reputation would definitely surpass Qin Yu’s!

“It’s not easy to restrict the strength of the physical body, but I can set up a killing formation. I can release the purest killing power towards it!” Formation Master Li Zinan said.

Everyone spoke one after another.

Soon, everyone’s gaze fell on Yao Qing.

“Mr. Qing, do you have a countermeasure?” Elder Zhuo asked.

Yao Qing glared at him and raised his hand to slap Elder Zhuo’s face!

“Do I have to report what countermeasures I have to you?!” Yao Qing scolded.

Elder Zhuo’s expression instantly turned ashen. His face was full of anger, and a trace of killing intent even rose from the bottom of his heart!

As a Inner Strength Grandmaster who had become famous several years ago, how could he tolerate being slapped by a junior in public?!

When he sensed the killing intent from Elder Zhuo’s body, Yao Qing’s expression instantly changed, and he secretly cursed inside.

“Elder Zhuo, forget it. After all, he’s Jiang He’s disciple,” someone advised.

Elder Zhuo slowly stood up and said coldly, “So what if he’s Jiang He’s disciple? I’m of the same generation as Jiang He. How could I allow him to humiliate me like this?!”

“I’ll kill him, then I’ll go and apologize to Jiang He!” Elder Zhuo said coldly.

Yao Qing’s expression instantly became extremely ugly!

This old thing actually had the intention to kill!

“Elder Zhuo, forget it. If you really want to kill him, wait until you get rid of Qin Yu first.” Someone at the side advised again.

Elder Zhuo gritted his teeth. He pointed at Yao Qing and said, “You’d better have real talent. Otherwise, I guarantee that you’ll die a miserable death!”

It was difficult for Qing Yao to get out of the situation, but he knew that if he gave in now, he would attract suspicion.

Therefore, Qing Yao braced himself and snorted coldly. “So what if you’re my master’s peer? You’re still inferior to my master.”

“Okay, everyone, stop talking.” Someone waved his hand.

“Let’s discuss the time and place.”

Li Zinan stood up and said indifferently, “Let’s go to the riverside. There are few people by the riverside, so it’s a good place to kill people. Moreover, I’ve observed the terrain of the riverside and have already set up a killing formation.”

Everyone nodded and said, “Okay, let’s go to the riverside as Mr. Li said.”

“But... how do we deceive Qin Yu?” Someone asked doubtfully.

“I’ll go!” Yao Qing immediately volunteered.

“I’ll go find Qin Yu and I promise to deceive him!”

Elder Zhuo glanced at Yao Qing and said, “You will go? Hehe, why should Qin Yu believe you?”

Yao Qing opened his mouth and said unwillingly, “I’m Jiang He’s disciple. I don’t believe that he won’t show me respect!”

“Hehe, that Qin Yu has never cared about prestige. He doesn’t recognize his own kin. Not to mention that you’re Jiang He’s disciple. Even if you’re the king, he might not show yourespect,” someone said.

“I’ll go.”

At this moment, a young man stood up.

Yao Qing’s expression changed slightly.

This person was none other than Jing Lu, the so-called genius of the Jiang Bei region!

What made Yao Qing feel the most uneasy was that Jing Lu and Fang Yue had a very good relationship. The hat on his head was very likely to be seen through!

“Who are you?” Asked Elder Zhuo.

A hint of coldness flashed across Jing Lu’s expression. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I am Jing Shihong’s son. Jing Lu, my father, died at Qin Yu’s hands!” Jing Lu gnashed his teeth and said.

“Now, I have no strength to deal with Qin Yu. I can only place my hopes on everyone else!”

“Qin Yu and I are old acquaintances. I believe we can trick him into coming here.”

Everyone looked at each other, then their eyes fell on Elder Zhuo.

Elder Zhuo pondered for a moment, then nodded and said, “This is a good opportunity to avenge your father. You are indeed the most suitable person to go.”

Jing Lu nodded and said coldly, “Don’t worry, I will definitely bring Qin Yu to the riverside tomorrow!”

After saying this, Jing Lu turned around and left.

Yao Qing’s expression suddenly became a bit ugly. He didn’t expect Jing Lu to come.

“No, I have to find a way to inform Mr. Qin as soon as possible,” Yao Qing thought to himself.

“In order to prevent accidents, no one is allowed to leave from now on.” However, Elder Zhuo’s words ruined Yao Qing’s plan.

“Everyone, hand over your phones,” Elder Zhuo stood up and continued.

Everyone took out their phones and handed them over.

Yao Qing couldn’t find an excuse to refuse. He could only obediently hand over his phone according to Elder Zhuo’s request.

“I have to think of a way.” Yao Qing was extremely anxious, but there was nothing he could do.

...

The next morning, the sun slowly rose, giving the river a golden color.

Under this seemingly peaceful scene, there was already a hidden killing intent.

At this moment, Qin Yu was standing by the window while quietly looking at the sky.

“Could it be that... no one dares to come?” Qin Yu frowned.

Currently, Qin Yu was indeed powerful enough in the martial world.

He killed more than ten peak Inner Strength Grandmasters by himself. This kind of battle record intimidated countless people.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and an idea suddenly came to his mind.

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

“Finally, someone is here.” Hearing the knock on the door, Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief.

When he opened the door, he saw Jing Lu standing outside.

At this moment, Jing Lu’s expression was no longer sad and sorrowful. Instead, it was filled with nervousness.

“Jing Lu?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

He never expected that the person who came to find him was Jing Lu.

Jing Lu nodded and said, “Mr. Qin, I’m flattered that you still remember me.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Why are you here?”

Jing Lu said with slight embarrassment, “After my father died, the Jing family collapsed. The enemies of the past also came to find me.”

“I couldn’t deal with them alone. I had no choice but to flee to Yunchuan City.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, and there was some doubt in his eyes.

Jing Lu sighed and said, “Mr. Qin, I came here this time... to bury the hatchet with you.”

“Bury the hatchet?” The sneer on Qin Yu’s expression became even more intense.

“I killed your father, but you came to bury the hatchet with me?” Qin Yu continued to sneer.
