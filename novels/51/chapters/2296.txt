2297 The Desperate Situ Haoyue

“Ptoo!”

Situ Haoyue’s power of star would have severely injured him if he hadn’t escaped with tremendously fast speed.

“The Path of Heaven I spent nearly 10,000 years to comprehend is the most powerful power of the star today. What do you have to fight against me?”

Situ Haoyue smiled faintly and said. Although he looked calm on the surface, he was actually shocked in his heart.

The Way of the Star is his strongest attack. He did not expect the two attacks triggered by consuming a vast amount of spiritual energy to fail to kill Qin Yu.

“Can you shut your sh*t mouth? Get lost if you’re scared!”

Qin Yu wiped away the blood from the corners of his mouth, sneered, and said.

“Reckless fellow! Your spiritual energy has depleted, and you’re severely injured. How do you fight against me?”

Even if Situ Haoyue was steady, he began to get angry when Qin Yu provoked him repeatedly.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and his divine sense penetrated the Spirit Storage Bead.

In an instant, terrifying spiritual energy surged into Qin Yu’s body like seawater, and his internal qi boosted again.

“You actually have treasures that store spiritual energy!”

Situ Haoyue’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

“I won’t drag with you anymore!”

The terrifying star power surged again on Situ Haoyue’s body, and Qin Yu almost retreated at the same time.

His speed was superior to that of Situ Haoyue.

“Roar!”

Qin Yu suddenly flicked his left fist with his right hand, and a unicorn phantom suddenly rushed out from within the sound of soul hunting. The enormous unicorn ran into the void and was enveloped in Qin Yu’s divine sense.

In an instant, the unicorn fiercely clashed with Situ Haoyue’s divine sense.

“You want to compete with my soul?”

A cultivator who had cultivated for less than a thousand years wanted to compete for the soul with a cultivator who had cultivated for nearly 20,000 years. It was something hard to acquire.

The golden sharp sword bloomed in Situ Haoyue’s sea of consciousness.

Qin Yu only felt a moment of dizziness and knelt on the ground with one leg, black blood seeping from his mouth and nose.

Situ Haoyue’s face was equally pale, and his seven orifices were bleeding.

“Did you see that? Situ Haoyue didn’t have the upper hand in the divine sense fight just now.”

“F*ck! Situ Haoyue, this old man’s divine sense has condensed to a very terrifying height!”

“Is this Qin Yu’s soul so powerful?”

The surrounding cultivators gasped.

They were unaware that after Qin Yu’s divine sense cultivated the masked woman’s Soul Torment Mind Technique, he had been advancing at a terrifying speed. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Most importantly, after going through the scholar’s Path of Reincarnation in the Azure Firmament Sect, his soul had already condensed to an incredible level.

Coupled with the ancient fierce beast unicorn and the Soul Shattering Golden Radiance, he finally ended in a draw with Situ Haoyue.

“Old dog, why did you stop barking?”

Qin Yu laughed wildly. Although he was also in a tremendously miserable state and consumed most of his soul power, seeing Situ Haoyue’s appearance instantly made him feel incredibly comfortable.

Situ Haoyue could not conceal his startled expression this time. The feeling was akin to an adult and a newborn baby competing in strength and ended in a draw at the end.

“It’s Suo Lin Divine Artifact again. How many more times can you use Suo Lin? It’s an external object. Don’t dream of reversing our strength gap!”

Situ Haoyue quickly calmed down and squinted his eyes to analyze.

Indeed, under this all-out blow, Suo Lin’s unicorn inner core had already consumed most of its strength.

Now, the unicorn’s inner core was dim and dull and almost unable to activate the fire element.

“It’s sufficient to kill you, an old dog.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

Situ Haoyue placed his two fingers on his forehead, and the robe on his body moved without wind.

The terrifying spiritual energy continued to soar on his body, and stars twinkled in the vast sky above the mighty ground.

The vast star power surged down again, and the people around them were shocked. Suddenly, countless lights flashed, and many cultivators retreated frantically, afraid of being swept in by the aftermath of the battle.

“Qin Yu’s speed was too fast. Even Situ Haoyue couldn’t guarantee he could hit him within a small range, which had attracted such a large scale of the power of the star.”

“This kid is really putting pressure on Situ Haoyue.”

The cultivators remained silent for a moment. Such a thing had never happened in this galaxy before.

Even the evil exterminator only became invincible in this world after the fifth grade.

The terrifying power of the star flushed down, and Qin Yu lifted the shield of Suo Lin in an instant.

The cosmic form!

His arm suddenly swelled up. Otherwise, he could not withstand the terrifying power.

At this moment, Situ Haoyue had already arrived in front of Qin Yu and locked on him.

The power of the star once again injected into his body, and a bright light bloomed from his body.

“Boom!”

In an instant, his punch hit Qin Yu’s shield.

Qin Yu’s body was violently struck, and he was directly repelled by tens of thousands of feet away.

Before Qin Yu could respond, Situ Haoyue jumped up again and directly kicked out the legs of the star.

“Crack!”

Suo Lin’s shield was directly kicked and shattered, turning into a boxing glove and wrapping Qin Yu’s hand dimly. It could no longer be used for a short period.

“Haha, I’ll see what else you can do without Suo Lin’s shield!”

Situ Haoyue laughed wildly.

“I can still tear your chicken beak mouth apart. It’s just a fight, but you’ve grumbled so much! And your star power seems to have weakened a lot, too.”

Qin Yu laughed heartily. The impact of his divine sense just now also impacted Situ Haoyue.

He circulated the Saintly Body Technique to its extreme, his hand forming the fighting word formula, and his Spiritual Technique transformed into a layer of clothing that enveloped him.

He was now locked on by Situ Haoyue and could only plan if he could withstand this wave of Situ Haoyue’s attacks.

A black fire was raging outside his body, forming a protective layer of clothing.

This was the ultimate protection of Qin Yu.

“Boom! Boom!”

In an instant, Situ Haoyue’s fists and feet landed before Qin Yu.

Each punch and kick landed on Qin Yu with the violent star power.

Even the incredibly sturdy space on the eighth level of purgatory continued to crack apart.

Countless holes in the void appeared in this space, and a massive suction force spread throughout.

A cultivator was inadvertently sucked into the void by the terrifying suction force, instantly turning into mud by the terrifying vacuum force.

Qin Yu was covered in bloodshed and injuries, looking incomparably miserable.

The sound of fists hitting the flesh echoed in the space constantly. Every moment Situ Haoyue’s fists intersected with Qin Yu’s, an incredibly bright light shone.

The space was full of violent star power, and many could not even open their eyes.

“What a terrifying attack! I’m afraid even an ancient demonic beast cannot withstand it!”
