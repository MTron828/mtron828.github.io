Chapter 603: Everyone, Kowtow! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He Teng’s cold voice entered everyone’s ears.

The expressions of these bottom-class martial artists immediately changed!

They couldn’t help but think of Chang Mang’s words. They never thought that what Chang Mang said was actually true!

Everyone hurriedly looked at Yan Guiyi with pleading eyes.

However, Yan Guiyi said coldly, “The Immortal Slaying Sect is full of danger. The bottom-class martial artists were weak and disobedient, so they died at the Immortal Slaying Sect!”

“You... You!” Yan Guiyi’s words sent chills down everyone’s spine!

Not far away, Jingdu’s upper class people were expressionless. It was as if they had long guessed this outcome.

Qin Yu, who was sitting on the chair, was even more anxious. If this continued, these people might really die here!

Qin Yu tried to sense Chang Mang’s internal qi and found that Chang Mang wasn’t dead, but his internal qi was extremely weak.

If he didn’t save him, he would definitely die.

“Captain Yan, isn’t this inappropriate?” Yao Meng suddenly asked.

Hearing Yao Meng’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel slightly relieved.

As expected of Yan Ruoxue’s friend, at least she was kind.

However, Yao Meng’s request alone couldn’t change anything.

Yan Guiyi said coldly, “Miss Yao, this is a decision that we all agreed on. You’d better not say anything more.”

Kong Yun also snorted coldly and said, “They’re just a bunch of ants. If they die, so be it. Miss Yao, why do you need to be so concerned?”

Yao Meng opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Yan Guiyi with a wave of his hand.

“He Teng, it’s your turn,” Yan Guiyi said coldly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He Teng licked his lips and said, “Don’t worry.”

With that said, He Teng held the black energy in his hand and walked toward the crowd.

On the stage, Qin Yu’s face was covered in sweat and he couldn’t wait any longer.

The bracelet still showed no signs of loosening. Even if Qin Yu made a move, he wouldn’t be able to stop them. Instead, he would risk his own life!

“I got it!” At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something!

He mustered all his strength and shouted, “How dare you?! How dare you intrude into the Immortal Slaying Sect?!”

The shout immediately gave everyone a fright.

Yan Guiyi, on the other hand, suddenly shivered, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead!

He hurriedly walked forward and came in front of Qin Yu. He cupped his hands and said, “Ancestor, we didn’t mean to offend you. Please forgive us...”

“How dare you!” Qin Yu shouted, “Kneel down!”

Yan Guiyi didn’t know that Qin Yu was the one. He thought that this was the sect master of the Immortal Slaying Sect.

Therefore, Yan Guiyi hurriedly waved his hands and said, “Kneel down, all of you. Kneel down!”

These young masters from Jingdu’s upper class all cherished their lives very much, so they also knelt down with Yan Guiyi.

“Ancestor, we have no intention of offending you. We hold the Immortal Slaying Sect in high esteem and hope that you will forgive us... . .” Yan Gui Yi knelt down on the ground and said in a trembling voice.

He was already panicking inside. After all, the people who had just come to participate were all the cream of the crop of the younger generation in Pyro!

More importantly, there were children from the various aristocratic families among them.

If any one of them died, he would be in big trouble!

Qin Yu, who was sitting on the chair, couldn’t help but feel happy. He really wanted to turn around and see Yan Guiyi kneeling on the ground while begging.

“Who are you people? Who asked you to come to the Immortal Slaying Sect?” Qin Yu continued.

Yan Guiyi hurriedly said, “Ancestor, we are from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. This time, we came to the Immortal Slaying Sect... to visit. We wanted to see the legendary number one sect in the world...”

Qin Yu snorted coldly and said, “Is that so? If you dare to lie to me, I will destroy your soul!”

“I don’t dare to. I definitely won’t dare to lie to you, ancestor,” Yan Guiyi hurriedly said.

Afraid that he would anger this “sect master” of the Immortal Slaying Sect, he pressed his head against the ground.

Qin Yu didn’t know what to say for a moment, and fell into silence for a while.

Yan Guiyi and the others held their breaths. They knelt on the ground and waited for orders.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association... What is that? How come I’ve never heard of it?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

Yan Guiyi hurriedly said, “Jingdu Martial Arts Association is one of our organizations. It just rose up in recent years...”

“Hmph, when there’s no tiger in the mountain, a monkey calls itself a King!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“You intruded into our sect rashly and woke me up from my sleep. This is a capital offense!” Qin Yu shouted.

Yan Guiyi’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly said, “Please show mercy, ancestor. We... we’ll leave now!”

“Do you think our sect is a place you can come and go as you please?!” Qin Yu said angrily.

“Everyone, kneel down and kowtow thirty times. I might consider sparing your lives then.”

When Yan Guiyi heard this, he hurriedly said, “Alright. We will listen to your arrangements.”

After saying this, Yan Guiyi took the lead and kowtowed to the ground.

The others didn’t seem to be willing to kowtow. They were all proud and cocky, so they were naturally unwilling to be humiliated like this.

“If you don’t want to die, then kowtow quickly! The sect master of the Immortal Slaying Sect is a great cultivator at the Reversion Void Stage. A single thought from him can destroy your souls and souls!” Yan Guiyi said angrily.

Although they were unwilling, they could only kowtow on the ground.

For a moment, banging sounds were incessant, and it spread throughout the entire hall.

Qin Yu laughed wildly inside. To make the young masters in Jingdu’s upper class kowtow, what sort of scene was that?

In the entire world, probably no one had ever seen such a scene!

Thirty kowtows were finally finished.

Yan Guiyi raised his head and said with a trembling voice, “Ancestor, can... can we leave now?”

Qin Yu forced down his laughter and said, “Get lost. Remember, the Immortal Slaying Sect isn’t a place for nobodies like you. If I see you again, I will definitely destroy the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“Yes, yes, I will obey your orders...” Yan Guiyi hurriedly got up and turned around to leave.

“Pfft!”

Just as they were about to leave, Qin Yu, who was sitting on the chair, couldn’t hold back his laughter and burst out laughing.

This laughter immediately made everyone freeze on the spot.

“Oh no!” Qin Yu knew he messed up!

“Just now... was someone laughing?” Yan Jinyao asked with a frown.

Yan Guiyi scratched his ears and looked at Qin Yu tentatively. “May I ask... were you laughing?”

“Yes, it’s me,” Qin Yu braced himself and said.

“If there’s nothing else, just get lost,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Wait.” At this moment, Yan Jinyao suddenly looked at Qin Yu.

He said coldly, “Ancestor, can you turn around and let us see your real face?”

“How impudent! How can you be qualified to see my true appearance?!” Qin Yu shouted loudly.

Yan Jinyao snickered and said, “Ancestor, why do I feel that you are a little strange? The way you dress doesn’t seem to be like something who came from ten thousand years ago.”

“Moreover... after all these years, shouldn’t your clothes be ragged?”

After Yan Jinyao’s reminder, everyone began to feel that something was wrong.

“Turn around and let us take a look,” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

“Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude.” Around Yan Jinyao’s hand, a light circled, indicating that he was about to attack.
