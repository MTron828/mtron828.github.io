Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Interesting! Are they going to die together?”

At this moment, in the world of the living, the Saint Kingdom permeated with an overwhelming demonic qi emitted a tremendous reverberation.

A giant beast seemed to have awakened. It was the kingdom of the monster race Saint Shimoji, who was also the master of the Eye of Destruction.

His enormous body stood in the Saint Kingdom. At this moment, the hearts of all the living beings in Shimoji’s kingdom trembled.

They were born in the kingdom, and these living beings could not see Shimoji.

They only felt a powerful existence had awakened in the dark which seemed to be a living being in this world.

Almost everyone could sense that with a thought of this awakened existence, they would be reduced to ashes.

At this moment, countless wounds were all over the enormous monster body in this Saint Kingdom. The wounds on his skin were criss-crossed and emitted a strange dark light. Some of these wounds were so deep that the bones were visible, while some were all over his body. The blood had solidified into black marks as if his body was made up of the wreckage and destruction from battles.

The most terrifying thing was on his grotesque face, the eyeball on his left seemed to have been gruesomely torn out.

The bones and veins beside the eye were noticeable. As he stepped forward, his body left the Saint Kingdom, and he slowly walked toward Chen Shuang’s Saint Kingdom.

As he left, the terrifying pressure in the hearts of the living beings in his Saint Kingdom finally disappeared.

Countless living beings appeared in Chen Shuang’s Saint Kingdom.

They were looking at the terrifying energy gathered in the kingdom. This energy even triggered immense thunders and continuously gathered in the sky above.

This destructive holy energy was enough to destroy a whole world beneath.

As for Zi Yang’s kingdom, which was extremely far away, was also fully prepared to receive Chen Shuang’s Saint Kingdom’s attack.

He stared at the destructive energy, and his face revealed a rare solemnness.

However, it was only a solemn expression, and his kingdom was far more potent than the one across.

There was not much skill in a clash between Saint Kingdom.

That was to use one’s soul to draw upon the power of the Saint Kingdom. It was equivalent to a clash between souls, and there was no return.

What he had to pay attention to were the poisonous snakes lurking around.

At this moment, countless light spots appeared on Saint Chen Shuang’s body above the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect. His mortal body had already sensed the energy condensed by his Saint Kingdom.

This enormous energy was not something that this mortal body could withstand. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Chen Shuang raised his head and looked at his kingdom with a confused expression.

He should have died long ago. The two youths who entered the path were young and full of vigor and were surrounded by the Misty Forest of the monster race.

They could not resist the dark energy at all. Even if their master was by their side, he could not save them.

At that time, the two youths were in despair, but when he woke up, he found himself being saved.

A man covered in golden light said to him with a warm smile.

“I shouldn’t have appeared here, but I’m giving you hope now. In the future, if you can remember what happened today and act according to your heart, you can also leave behind a seed of hope.”

He left behind an inexplicable sentence and disappeared.

I, Chen Shuang, was in the Dao for over 6,000 years. How could I be arranged by others?

I used the Saint power of my mortal body to condense the Seal of Heaven Returning to repay the karma and protect your descendant’s life.

However, I did not owe to him only but also to his friends.

And also an explanation to everyone in the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect. “Did you already see the changes today at that time? Who are you exactly?”

Chen Shuang revealed a bitter smile as his body disappeared in an instant completely.

At the same time, an energy light beam shot into the sky from his Saint Kingdom.

The gloomy Kingdom of Saint was completely lit up with the appearance of this strike.

Heaven and earth seemed to tremble. This power was like a blazing bolt of lightning that tore the sky, instantly dispelling all the darkness.

The terrifying power that erupted from the Saint Kingdom caused the air in the world of the Saint to distort violently, flames and lightning intertwined, forming a boundless catastrophe.

Even the ground, as hard as black iron, began to tremble. The mountains trembled, and the earth seemed to be shaking like an earthquake. Countless living beings curled up in the Saint’s world and trembled. They did not know why this most unyielding world in the universe would experience such terrifying upheavals.

Some living beings had been here for two eras, from the Supreme of Divine Land to the Era of Annihilation. It was the first time they had sensed such fear.

“Hmm?”

Zi Yang’s solemn face suddenly revealed a puzzled expression, including all the living beings nearby. The scene that everyone had expected did not happen. The battle of the Kingdom of Saint did not take place.

That energy did not fall toward Zi Yang’s kingdom.

Instead, it directly bombarded the crystal wall between the world of the Saint and the human world. As the energy descended, everything around the energy turned into nothingness.

The energy fluctuations released by this terrifying attack swept through everything, and nothing could withstand it. “Boom!”

A fist-sized hole appeared between the two worlds.

In an instant, the holy energy outside the eighteen Kingdom of Saint flowed backward like seawater and surged toward the human world.

At this moment, after the holy energy entered the human world, the whole world seemed to have changed strangely.

The entire Path of Heaven was slowly squirming and changing, and countless brilliant lights resembling fireworks sparkled continuously in the distant starlight.

The originally calm land, mountains, and lakes began to emit a mysterious internal qi. Plants grew vigorously, and flowers, plants, and trees began to show extraordinary colors.

Everyone who was cultivating suddenly noticed something different after absorbing the spiritual energy between heaven and earth.

There were some powerful existences in the human race, demon race, monster race, and ghost race. They were showing signs of awakening.

These powerful living beings were originally restricted by the vital energy of heaven and earth. They could not completely wake up in the human world or enter the Saint’s world. They could only rely on long periods of hibernation to maintain their state.

At this moment, in the face of this change, they seemed to have begun to wake up.

“Has Chen Shuang gone mad?”

At this moment, all the Saint looked furious.

Even the remaining six Saints of the human race looked dissatisfied.

Perhaps they could still understand if Chen Shuang and Zi Yang started the battle between the Saint Kingdoms. But Chen Shuang, at this moment, actually broke the passageway between the two worlds, causing the holy energy of the entire Saint’s world to instantly flow into the human world.

The source of power for the eighteen Kingdom of Saint came from the Saint’s world outside their kingdom..
