1922 The Day of the Path of Heaven

“What do you mean?” Uncle Yan was stunned, frowned, and said.

“I’ll only cause trouble if I stay with the Yan family,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “I might as well go out to try my luck.”

Uncle Yan frowned and said, “Qin Yu, you don’t have to overthink. Although Si Shiyue is a little troublesome, he wouldn’t dare to act recklessly. He wouldn’t even dare to do anything to Miss Yan. You…”

“I know,” Qin Yu cupped his hands once again. “I’ve indeed planned to leave for the time being. Please help say goodbye to Ruoxue for me. I will see her on the day of the Path of Heaven.”

!!

Uncle Yan was silent.

He could tell that Qin Yu was not lying.

In Uncle Yan’s eyes, Qin Yu seemed to be a villain who had wanted to get close to someone of higher social status. But now he had a completely different view of him.

“Are you really leaving?” Uncle Yan asked.

“Mmm.” Qin Yu responded and then said with a smile, “Yes, I’m really leaving. My name and identity are fake anyway. No one will notice even if I leave.”

“Alright.” Uncle Yan no longer insisted and said, “I’ll bring you down.”

Uncle Yan was the chief of the Yan family. His status was extraordinary, more so his strength.

He took Qin Yu and jumped down from the sky, returning to the ground.

“Where do you plan to go now?” Uncle Yan asked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I don’t know yet,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “I’ll find a place to do some simple planning.”

“Alright. I won’t be sending you off then,” Uncle Yan said.

After saying goodbye to Uncle Yan, Qin Yu didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he found a place to stay for the time being.

Since he received that blow from Si Shiyue, Qin Yu knew the gap in strength between them.

No wonder an existence like Si Shiyu had also gone to Thunder Courtyard. There was probably an enormous gap between him and Si Shiyue.

After that, Qin Yu recovered his face and planned to find the next hidden treasure from his memory.

After searching in his mind for a while, Qin Yu soon found the hidden treasure closest to him.

The location of hidden treasure was in a place called Serene South City. It was not far from here, but he had no idea what hidden treasure it was.

After confirming the location, Qin Yu decided to take a rest.

However, lying on the bed, he could not fall asleep no matter how.

“I wonder how long it’ll take before the day of the Path of Heaven,” Qin Yu said with emotion.

Si Shiyue claimed that he could step into the Semi-Saint realm at any time. Although it was somewhat exaggerated, it was not without basis.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu felt a headache.

After much thought, Qin Yu decided to go to the Cold Moon Palace and ask Saintess Gu.

This Saintess Gu looked ordinary, but she was definitely not simple. She had deep and meticulous thoughts that even Qin Yu could not see through her.

And he might need to ask her about Serene South City before he went there.

Qin Yu got up early and rushed to the Cold Moon Palace the following morning.

As always, the Cold Moon Palace was quite desolate, but it didn’t make people feel lonely at all. On the contrary, it was the feeling of calmness in dao mind.

If he went into seclusion in such a place, it would definitely be significantly beneficial to his state of mind.

As soon as he stepped into the palace, two boys walked up to him.

“Greetings, Mr. Qin. The saintess is waiting for you under the Osmanthus tree,” the two bowed and said.

“Alright,” Qin Yu raised her eyebrows and said with a smile.

After that, Qin Yu quickly walked to the Osmanthus tree.

At this moment, a stone table was placed under the Osmanthu tree, and tea had already been brewed on the stone table.

Saintess Gu was sitting on one side, playing the zither.

The melodious sound spread throughout the entire Cold Moon Palace. It was as if the whole world was immersed in the beautiful sound.

The trees nearby rustled and swayed their branches as if they were cheering for Saintess Gu.

Qin Yu stood there and was fascinated by the sound. He closed his eyes slightly as if he had entered another world.

But the next second, Qin Yu came to his senses. His forehead was covered in sweat, and he was a little scared.

Although this sound was sweet and melodious, it would invade one’s divine sense if one was not careful. If one was immersed in this gentleness for a long time, one would be unable to extricate himself, and one’s dao mind would be destroyed!

“It’s so scary,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The zither in Saintess Gu’s hand must have an extraordinary origin. It could even be a Saint Weapon.

At this moment, Saintess Gu looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, please have some tea.”

Qin Yu walked to the stone table and sat down. He picked up the tea in front of him and sniffed it. He then released a wisp of internal qi into the tea.

Seeing how cautious Qin Yu was, Saintess Gu couldn’t help but laugh. “Mr. Qin, are you afraid that I’ll poison you?”

“Not to the extent of poisoning.” Qin Yu shook his head.

It was just that the terrifying sound of the zither frightened Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin’s divine sense is indeed powerful. Not many people can walk out of the sound of my zither so quickly,” Saintess Gu said with a faint smile.

“The sound of your zither is indeed scary,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. “If you play it in a great battle, I’m afraid it will unleash an unimaginable effect.”

Saintess Gu smiled and didn’t continue to dwell on the topic.

“How did you feel going to the Yan family?” Saintess Gu asked.

...

Qin Yu sighed and told Saintess Gu what happened in general.

Of course, Qin Yu did not mention his relationship with Yan Ruoxue.

“So, you met the third princess. Not bad, you can still walk out of Xihunag Island,” Saintess Gu said with a hint of admiration.

“I almost died there.” Qin Yu sighed with emotion.

Without Satan’s secret technique that had improved his primordial spirit, he would have been corroded by the chain.

“Saintess Gu, I have something to ask you,” Qin Yu said.

Saintess Gu nodded slightly, signaling Qin Yu to continue.

“Have you ever heard of the day of the Path of Heaven?” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

“Who hasn’t heard of it?” Saintess Gu couldn’t help but laugh.

Qin Yu nodded and asked, “Saintess Gu, do you know how long it will be before the day of the Path of Heaven? When will it descend?”

“This… I’m afraid no one will know.” Saintess Gu shook her head. “Everyone can only predict roughly, and it’s not accurate.”

...

“What about the approximate timing?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

“According to our previous conjectures, it will probably descend within the next two years,” Saintess Gu said after some thought.

“But now, some people have overturned this prediction. Some have said it will descend in about ten years, while others have said it will not take more than five years.”

Saintess Gu paused for a while and then continued, “But I’m more inclined to the latter prediction, which is not more than five years.”

“Why?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Saintess Gu smiled. “That’s because the arrival of the day of the Path of Heaven is often inseparable from the Golden Age. The
