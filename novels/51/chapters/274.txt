Chapter 275: Holy Body, Jiang Gu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The power of the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist was able to destroy everything! Even a holy body couldn’t withstand it at all!

Hui Ming’s physical body shot down from the sky! It smashed a huge pit several meters deep into the ground!

Qin Yu didn’t stop there. He quickly caught up and dived down!

“Boom!”

The blazing light ruthlessly smashed onto the ground!

Smoke and dust rose up, and blocked everyone’s vision.

Qin Yu stood at the side while quietly looking at the deep pit. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Mr. Qin!” Jiang Gu ran over quickly.

“Is Hui Ming dead?” Jiang Gu asked with some confusion.

Qin Yu didn’t answer, but stared at the deep pit.

At this time, Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly dilated, and he hurriedly shouted, “Get out of the way!”

Unfortunately, it was too late! Hui Ming burst out from the deep pit, and with a bang, his fist smashed onto Jiang Gu’s body!

The holy body was fierce, and Jiang Gu didn’t have the slightest bit of defense.

With this punch, Jiang Gu’s body was almost smashed into pieces!

His body was severely damaged, and he fell into a pool of blood!

“Jiang Gu!” Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he hurriedly rushed toward Jiang Gu.

Jiang Gu kept spitting out blood, and he said with difficulty, “Mr. Qin, I. . .”

He wanted to say something, but he had no strength left.

Qin Yu didn’t have time to think. He quickly put his hand on Jiang Gu’s body, and spiritual energy surged into Jiang Gu’s body through his palm.

However, Jiang Gu’s injuries were too severe, and all his bones were broken! His internal qi was rapidly draining away!

Even Qin Yu couldn’t do anything about it!

“Hahahaha!” Hui Ming couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“If I can’t kill you, killing the lap dog beside you isn’t bad either.” Hui Ming grinned.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. Even his body was trembling.

“Hui Ming...” Qin Yu growled in a low voice. Suddenly, he turned around and punched Hui Ming’s face!

“Bang!”

Hui Ming was sent flying by this punch. Half of his face was almost distorted!

Qin Yu didn’t stop. His fist was like a cannonball that bombarded him wildly!

Although Hui Ming’s body was extremely tough, he was still beaten into a bloody mess!

After an amount of time, Qin Yu finally stopped what he was doing.

Qin Yu stared at Hui Ming, and anger almost overwhelmed him.

“Hehe... with this body, you can’t kill me...” Hui Ming grinned.

Qin Yu’s eyes gradually narrowed.

“You abandoned your body and escaped twice,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“You did it again and again. Do you really think I’m not prepared?”

Hui Ming’s expression changed slightly, and he said in shock, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He was mumbling, and the divine sense in his mind lit up.

“Divine sense judgment!”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s divine sense suddenly shot out a ray of light!

This light passed through Hui Ming’s head and hit Hui Ming’s divine sense.

“Buzz!”

Under this divine sense judgment technique, Hui Ming’s expression instantly became distorted!

“You... you actually cut off my divine sense...” Hui Ming cried out in pain.

His divine sense was slowly drained from his body until the holy body was taken away!

What was even more terrifying was that Hui Ming’s divine sense was being torn apart bit by bit!

“Don’t... Don’t kill me...” At this moment, Hui Ming was completely panicking!

He could look for a body again if it was gone, but without his divine sense, even God couldn’t save him!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Hui Ming, your retribution has come.”

“Phew”

Hui Ming’s divine sense was torn bit by bit until it completely disappeared.

The Valley Master of the Earth Fiend Valley had died just like that.

Cheng Cai, who wasn’t far away, had a stiff expression and was extremely shocked.

He had never expected that Qin Yu was so powerful!

Tang Ling, her face full of surprise, even covered her small mouth.

Qin Yu turned around and walked in front of Jiang Gu.

Jiang Gu’s internal qi was about to be extinguished.

He slowly picked Jiang Gu up with a sad look on his face.

“Don’t worry. I will bury everyone in the Earth Fiend Valley with you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying that, Qin Yu held Jiang Gu with one hand and turned around to walk toward the Earth Fiend Valley.

Countless people in the Earth Fiend Valley died. Only the strongest people in the valley were still alive.

“Don’t... Don’t kill us...” these people said in horror.

Qin Yu looked at them coldly and said, “All of you people from the Earth Fiend Valley deserve to die!”

After saying that, Qin Yu waved his hand and smashed a person’s head!

The expressions of the rest of them immediately changed drastically and they were extremely terrified!

“Don’t kill me! I can save your friend!” At this moment, someone suddenly shouted.

Qin Yu heard this and hurriedly looked at him.

“Is what you said true?” Qin Yu grabbed his collar and asked anxiously.

The old man hurriedly nodded and said, “It’s true!”

“Hurry up and say it. I’ll spare your life,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The old man pointed at the Resurrection Formation not far away and said, “As long as you use this formation and transfer your friend’s divine sense to the holy body, you’ll be able to save his life!”

When he heard this, Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization!

But... this Resurrection Formation had been damaged in the battle just now, so how could he use it?

“Don’t worry, we have prepared more than ten Resurrection Formations,” the old man suddenly said at this moment.

He cast a spell, and another formation quickly appeared in front of him!

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time.

He hurriedly turned around and ran to the holy body.

Then, he grabbed Jiang Gu and ran back.

“Quick, activate the Resurrection Formation!” Qin Yu said coldly.

The survivors quickly got up from the ground.

“The Resurrection Formation requires eight people to do it at the same time. We don’t have enough people...” the old man frowned.

Qin Yu glanced at them. Including Qin Yu, there were only seven people.

“You, come here.” Qin Yu pointed at Cheng Cai.

Cheng Cai was stunned. He pointed at his nose and said, “Me?”

“Who else?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“There are enough people now,” Qin Yu said.

The old man nodded and said, “Please return to your positions. I will guide the formation.”

Qin Yu followed the old man’s request and placed the holy body at the center of the formation.

The old man sat beside the holy body and began to activate the formation.

The moment the formation was activated, the eight people’s bodies began to rush towards the light.

The light gathered at one point and landed on the holy body’s body!

To Cheng Cai, the pressure of conjuring the Resurrection Formation was extremely great.

Cold sweat was dripping down his forehead, as if he couldn’t hold on any longer.

But when he thought of Qin Yu’s abilities, Cheng Cai gritted his teeth and forcefully held on.

Half an hour later, the light began to converge!

“Buzz!”

A demonic light lit up, and the Resurrection Formation shattered once again!

“It’s done.” The old man wiped his sweat and said tiredly.

Cheng Cai’s head tilted and he fell to the ground.

Qin Yu hurriedly ran in front of the holy body and looked at him nervously.

Not long after, the holy body moved his finger, and his eyes opened.

“Mr. Qin, I... I’m not dead?” Jiang Gu murmured in a low voice.

Seeing Jiang Gu’s words, Qin Yu was finally relieved.

“Mr. Qin, can we leave now?” The people of the Earth Fiend Valley asked tentatively.

Qin Yu glanced at them and killing intent suddenly flashed in his eyes.

“Sorry, you guys can’t!” Qin Yu said coldly.
