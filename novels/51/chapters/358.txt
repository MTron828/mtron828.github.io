Chapter 359: Old Mister Yan’s Choice Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Wei felt a mixture of emotions.

He was first stunned, then filled with anger!

His entire face was almost distorted from anger! Even his body was trembling slightly!

Seeing this scene, the surrounding people seemed to be quite surprised.

They subconsciously took a step back to watch the drama.

These people also wanted to know how Qin Yu, a nobody, would act when facing Han Wei.

“Thank you, Mr. Han, for opening the car door for me personally. Thank you for your hard work.” Qin Yu calmly got out of the car.

Not only that, but he even patted Han Wei on the shoulder.

“You!” Han Wei clenched his fist and almost punched him!

But in the end, Han Wei still held back.

Because he knew very well that if he lost his composure in front of so many people, he would be the one to lose.

Han Wei took a deep breath and said as calmly as he could, “It’s just opening the door. You’re welcome.”

As he spoke, Old Mister Yan got out of the car with Yan Ruoxue’s help.

Han Wei no longer paid attention to Qin Yu. He hurriedly called out enthusiastically, “Old Mister Yan!”

Old Mister Yan nodded with a smile and said, “Han Wei, you’re here too.”

“You’re celebrating your birthday. Even if there’s something important scheduled, I’ll still come,” Han Wei said with a smile.

After saying that, Han Wei went to support Old Mister Yan.

However, Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “Go and sit.”

Han Wei was slightly embarrassed, but he still braced himself and said, “I got it, Old Mister Yan.”

Old Mister Yan’s arrival naturally brought things to a climax.

Everyone stepped forward one after another to congratulate Old Mister Yan.

“I wish Old Mister Yan a long life!”

“Old Mister Yan, I wish you good health. You will definitely live for a hundred years!”

“Old Mister Yan, I wish you youth and prosperity!”

Looking at everyone’s attitude, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Old Mister Yan’s status in Jingdu was really high!

And this was only Jingdu.?There was no telling how much power the Yan family had in the entire country.

“Alright, everyone take your seats.” Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said.

As Old Mister Yan’s words fell, everyone returned to their seats one after another.

This banquet was arranged out in the open, and there were many dining tables in the entire manor.

On the dining table, there were delicacies of all kinds.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue followed behind Old Mister Yan and walked towards the dining table at the front.

Not far away, Han Wei was gnashing his teeth in anger.

“Trash, you can’t take it anymore?” Han Meng glanced at Han Wei coldly.

Han Wei couldn’t help but say, “Dad, can’t you see? Qin Yu has been following Old Mister Yan all this time! Even I don’t have this kind of treatment!”

Han Meng snorted coldly and said, “So? So you have to show all your emotions on your face? How have I taught you all these years?”

“Sometimes, you have to be thick-skinned, understand?” Han Meng’s words seemed to have a hidden meaning.

Fortunately, Han Wei was not stupid. He quickly understood what Han Meng meant.

Therefore, he immediately walked to Old Mister Yan’s side.

At this time, the dining table was already filled with dishes. Many people came forward to give gifts and toast.

Han Wei held the wine glass and quickly walked to old Mister Han’s side.

“Old Mister Yan, I wish you the best of luck. I’ll toast you,” Han Wei said respectfully.

Old Mister Yan laughed and said, “Han Wei, my health isn’t very good. I can’t drink anymore. Let Qin Yu drink with you.”

After saying that, Old Mister Yan looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t really care. He picked up the wine glass and said with a smile, “Young Master Han, please go ahead.”

Han Wei was about to flare up, but he remembered what his father had said and forcefully suppressed the anger inside.

After drinking a glass of wine, Han Wei simply sat beside Old Mister Yan.

Old Mister Yan didn’t say anything about this, which made Han Wei slightly relieved.

Not long after, Yan Sihai and the others walked over from not far away. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Yan Sihai’s arrival attracted countless gazes.

Everyone knew clearly inside that once Old Mister Yan was gone, Yan Sihai would become the new leader of the Yan family.

Therefore, everyone walked towards Yan Sihai one after another while holding their wine glass and toasted him.

After a round of drinking, Yan Sihai quickly walked to Old Mister Yan’s side.

He glanced at Qin Yu and snorted. “Who told you to sit here?”

“Old Mister Yan told me to sit here. What’s wrong?” Qin Yu said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

Yan Sihai snorted coldly. He leaned close to Qin Yu’s ear and said coldly, “Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you have my father’s support. You won’t be arrogant for long.”

After saying this, Yan Sihai turned his head and walked away.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly saw a young man with handsome features.

The young man looked to be in his twenties, but the aura he exuded was extremely noble.

Even though he was far away, it was hard to ignore him.

Qin Yu looked at the young man and whispered, “Who is that person?”

“Yan Jinyao, my uncle’s son,” said Yan Ruoxue.

“He is Yan Jinyao?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and immediately became interested.

One had to know that Yan Jinyao was the number one person on the younger generation’s ranking list! His strength was even above Han Wei’s!

“Yan Jinyao!” After seeing him, Han Wei quickly stood up and greeted Yan Jinyao.

Yan Jinyao replied with a smile, “Han Wei, you’re here too.”

Han Wei said, “Of course. It’s Old Mister Yan’s birthday, so of course I have to come.”

“Besides, we might be a family in the future,” Han Wei said with a smile.

Yan Jinyao nodded and didn’t say anything else.

“Happy birthday, Grandpa.” Yan Jinyao looked at Old Mister Yan and bowed.

Old Mister Yan nodded and said with a smile, “Yan Jinyao, come and sit down quickly.”

Yan Jinyao walked to Qin Yu’s side and sat down.

He did not say a word to Qin Yu. He did not even look at Qin Yu.

Unlike ordinary aristocratic family disciples, he did not have an arrogant attitude.

But those who understood him knew that Yan Jinyao was a ruthless and merciless person. He was not inferior to Yan Sihai at all in this aspect.

Han Meng’s expression was calm. His eyes were looking in Old Mister Yan’s direction.

Qin Yu and Han Meng were both sitting at Old Mister Yan’s table. It was inevitable that people would dwell on this scene.

“You want to have a foot in both camps? In your dreams!” Han Meng extinguished the cigarette butt in his hand.

Then, he sneered and said, “I will force you to make a choice today! I don’t believe that you will choose Qin Yu over my son in front of so many people!”

Then, Han Meng took out his phone and made a call.

“Come in, all of you,” Han Meng said coldly.

After he hung up the phone, a group of reporters walked in not long after.

The group of reporters walked to Old Mister Yan’s side quickly and said politely, “Old Mister Yan, I wish you the best of luck and longevity.”

Old Mister Yan was shrewd, so he could naturally tell that the arrival of these reporters was a deliberate arrangement.

However, he was not anxious and replied with a smile, “You’re too kind. I’m an old person. I don’t deserve to trouble your television station to come and celebrate my birthday.”

The reporter smiled and said, “You’re a famous entrepreneur in Jingdu. We also admire you.”

At this point, the reporter paused for a moment. The cameraman quickly took a shot of Qin Yu.

“Mr. Yan, the outside world has been saying that a young man named Qin Yu is the future son-in-law of the Yan family. What do you think of this?”

“According to our understanding, the Young Master of the Han family, Han Wei, seems to be pursuing your granddaughter. If you had to choose between these two young men, who would you choose?” The reporter quickly said.
