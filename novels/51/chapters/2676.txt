Chapter 2677: Hua Tian’s Move

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When the little girl heard Zi Yan’s words, her expression instantly darkened.

“We’ve already killed many people, including the last time when the Heart of Saint Kingdom was broken. I really don’t want to kill anymore.”

“It’s because once someone becomes the lord of a country, one’s ambitions will swell and they will do many bad things. What we need to do is to eliminate this danger before it starts.”

Zi Yan said with a smile. She held the little girl’s small hand and the two of them slowly left.

“Use all your methods, or you won’t have a chance. From the start of the Heavenly Cloud Continent, you and I were mortal enemies. It was just that our cosmic luck was the opposite back then. But now, I’m the chosen one for the Demon Sealing Valley, and you’re my stepping stone.” Hua Tian said with a smile.

Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique!

Before he could finish her sentence, Hua Tian had already put his palms together. A golden fist shot out from behind Qin Yu at a terrifying speed.

In an instant, it pierced through Qin Yu’s body. With one punch, Qin Yu’s body had completely exploded.

“What a terrifying power! The power of this spell has far exceeded his realm. However, he didn’t show any signs of suffering a backlash. He’s amazing! No wonder the sect master chose him.”

This was the first time Gu Yi had seen Hua Tian fight. He was shocked. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

When one reached the Dao Consciousness Realm, they had already grasped a certain way.

Moreover, one could use the power of the way to cleanse one’s divine soul and raise it to a new cultivation realm.

When one casted techniques or attacks, the power of one’s soul would carry the power of divine might.

However, one could only grasp some relatively shallow laws with the Dao Consciousness Realm. Once it involved too much power, the divine soul would not be able to withstand the power of the way and would suffer a backlash.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, and the blood from his mouth slowly dripped onto the ground.

“Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly.”

Countless butterflies danced on his body, and the huge wound slowly disappeared. In the next moment, he appeared beside Hua Tian.

“Wood Burning Blade!”

Tiger Wing instantly slashed out. In an instant, a violent flame exploded in front of Hua Tian.

Whoosh!

Following the explosion of the flame, Qin Yu blew a trace of holy light divine flame towards Hua Tian. An even more terrifying flame exploded on his body. “Did he take away a trace of the holy light divine flame I gave you?”

Gu Yi stared at Gu Tian and asked unhappily.

“Yes. I’m useless.”

Seeing that everyone was staring at him, Gu Tian felt a little awkward.

“Divination Sword!”

In the firelight that filled the sky, countless divinatory symbols appeared in front of Hua Tian.

These divinatory symbols turned into characters one after another, forming a Divination Sword.

As he slashed forward, countless trigrams exploded.

It tore a passage through the sea of fire, and the terrifying Spiritual Energy Sword directly cut Qin Yu’s body into two halves.

The Great Expansion Divine Technique that Hua Tian grasped could also be considered a top-notch power of rules.

More importantly, the origin of the rule was here. Thus, the Great Expansion Divine Technique unleashed its greatest power at this moment.

Even Gu Yi and Gu Ying were probably no match for him here, which was why he was so fearless.

The dreamy qi erupted from Qin Yu’s body again. He transferred the damage to the dream world again.

“How could Elder Xin Yue’s Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly appear on him? This is the power of her Meridian Circulation Technique. It’s impossible to master it.”

Gu Yi was shocked.

“It’s probably the skill of the other Heart of Saint Kingdom. One can allow him to reincarnate, and the other is probably a copy of Xin Yue’s Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly. However, this technique still has a strong side effect and is not invincible.”

Gu Ying said with a frown.

“The power of Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly is the divine soul shuttling back and forth between the dream and reality. Every time you use it, you will receive more backlash from the dream. Soon, you will be immersed in the dream, and you will no longer be able to distinguish between reality and illusion.” Hua Tian laughed and stepped forward.

The Divination Sword slashed fiercely at Qin Yu. A storm of Spiritual Energy Sword swept up.

Qin Yu’s body was torn into countless pieces of flesh, but it recovered once again.

Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze! Explode!

A massive amount of power of eye exploded on Hua Tian’s body.

The kasaya on Hanada’s body suddenly swept up, enveloping the power within.

After wriggling for a while, the kasaya absorbed this power, causing Qin Yu’s attack to disappear once again.

After Qin Yu used the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze again, the world in front of him was already spinning.

The consciousness of the Destruction Saber roared furiously in his sea of consciousness, in addition to the backlash from Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly made his sea of consciousness a little drunk.

“It seems that the vicious consciousness of the Saint Kingdom has caused you quite a bit of backlash. What other methods do you have now?”

Hua Tian had a crazy smile on his face. This was the first time he had crushed Qin Yu to the ground like this. At this moment, he felt an indescribable sense of joy.

Prajna! Go!

A lotus-like sword suddenly unsheathed from behind Hua Tian. This was what Hua Tian had obtained in the Treasure Repository Pavilion.

At this moment, Prajna seemed to have its consciousness. It quickly shuttled behind Qin Yu and slashed at him.

“Buddhism sword has its consciousness. As long as I use my Great Expansion Divine Technique to guide it, it can become a divine artifact to kill enemies.” As Hua Tian smiled, Prajna sped up again.

The slash with exquisite sword move once again piercing Qin Yu’s heart with a hundred swords.

Time and time again, Hua Tian killed Qin Yu, who was in an underestimated state. He was not in a hurry.

This kind of consumption was not big for him. Moreover, he still had a trump card.

“The power of your Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly is getting weaker and weaker. After reincarnation, it still has some residual wounds. Is it impossible to completely transfer the injuries to the dream?”

Hua Tian patted his round belly hard and looked at Qin Yu with a sinister smile.

He was already thinking about his plans after obtaining Qin Yu’s two Hearts of Saint Kingdom. The capability of the two Hearts of the Saint Kingdom on Qin Yu’s body had already made him drool three times.

After obtaining it, who else in this Saint Kingdom would be a match for him?

“Let’s try the Evil Buddha’s moves.”

Hua Tian suddenly took out a string of prayer beads. A Buddha statue slowly appeared behind him.

Pure land without filth, thunder-shaking hell.

Following the Buddha statue’s six punches, a huge thunder exploded after the lightning. Qin Yu’s surroundings became a lightning purgatory, and his body was torn apart again.

Hiss!

Qin Yu returned once again and let out a crazy howl.

In his divine soul, a destructive internal qi soared.

Zi Yan, who had already left, seemed to have sensed something. She looked in the direction of the Demon Sealing Valley in disbelief.

“This is the aura of Ten Directions Annihilation. Did he integrate this power into his divine soul?”

Her face was filled with disbelief..
