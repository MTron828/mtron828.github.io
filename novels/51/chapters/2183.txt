2184 The Terror of Wu Ji

When the two forces clashed, space seemed torn apart. Powerful airwaves swept up, stirring up monstrous energy fluctuations.

Qin Yu felt as if his fist had hit on an invisible mountain, the tremendous recoil causing his arms to tremble, and waves of intense pain reverberated through his bones.

Veins were faintly discernible on his palm, emitting a mysterious power. His gaze was deep and cold as if he could see through everything in Qin Yu’s heart!

The clashes between the two sides triggered a strong energy fluctuation, and the air on the battlefield seemed frozen for a moment.

Qin Yu’s body trembled violently, but he did not back down. On the contrary, his eyes flickered with unwavering determination, and a continuous surge of strength emanated from his body.

A slight crack appeared on the surface of Wu Ji’s palm as if it was under tremendous pressure. His eyes also moved slightly as if he was surprised by Qin Yu’s strength.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, and his body’s muscles tensed up. He released an even more formidable force without fear.

The cold gleam in Wu Ji’s eyes became even more prominent. He exerted force in his palm again, attempting to suppress Qin Yu.

The powers of both intertwined and created a tremendous confrontation. Space seemed torn apart, and an endless energy storm ravaged the surroundings.

Qin Yu’s body tilted slightly, but he steadied his steps and gritted his teeth to persevere. His eyes filled with determination, determined not to yield to any difficulties.

A hint of battle intent flashed across Wu Ji’s cold eyes. His palm continued to exert pressure, trying to break Qin Yu’s resistance.

“Boom!”

A dreadful boom reverberated at that moment like an explosion. Qin Yu staggered several steps back, falling back on the ground.

His clothes were torn to shreds, and his body was covered in blood, but the battle intent in his eyes grew even more intense.

“As expected of Senior Wu Ji, you live up to your reputation!” Qin Yu shouted.

This kind of pressure was something that Qin Yu had never come across.

No matter which heaven’s favorite he encountered, no one could compare to Wu Ji!

“Senior Wu Ji, let us engage in a fierce battle and enjoy it to the fullest!” Qin Yu shouted and rose again!

His fist contained numerous dao techniques as if everything transformed into his fist!

Wu Ji, too, did not have support from any technique. It only formed a palm with his left hand and a fist with his right hand, clashing with Qin Yu!

For a moment, the void reverberated incessantly, and the entire world seemed on the verge of collapse. Within a short period, the two sides had clashed hundreds of times. A terrifying internal qi swept out relentlessly, threatening to destroy everything!

The clouds in the sky churned and rolled incessantly under the surge of boundless energy fluctuation, forming peculiar vortexes and ripples. Lightning danced wildly within clouds, accompanied by deafening thunderclaps.

Deep cracks appeared on the ground, and rock fragments flew everywhere. Earthquake-like tremors spread throughout the battlefield, destroying the surrounding trees and buildings.

The air on the battlefield was stirred up by the violent airwaves, forming terrifying hurricanes. The wind howled, bringing along dust and gravel, creating a chaotic scene.

This world would have long been reduced to ruins if not formed by the dao technique. A battle of this level was something even a star field could not withstand!

The energy fluctuations rapidly spread, affecting the flow of time in the surroundings. Time seemed to have been distorted, sometimes accelerating and sometimes stagnating, making it difficult to grasp.

Amid this intense clash, the space distorted and collapsed intermittently. Countless explosions and shockwaves caused the surroundings to be unstable and on the verge of collapse at any moment.

The battlefield became a chaotic and broken world, filled with the internal qi of destruction and dense battle intent.

Qin Yu’s and Wu Ji’s figures intertwined in the storm. Every clash released limitless power. Their fists and legs intertwined, and their auras were like rainbows as if they wanted to tear the world apart.

The constant clashes and explosions caused the surrounding space to distort even more violently. A spatial rift appeared on the battlefield, releasing a dark and demonic internal qi.

The energy fluctuations on the battlefield gradually reached their limits as if they were about to destroy everything. However, Qin Yu’s and Wu Ji’s figures still stood tall. Their battle intent grew increasingly intense as if they were invincible gods.

This battle shook the entire world. All forces were paying close attention to this magnificent battle.

On the battlefield, Qin Yu’s and Wu Ji’s figures were constantly intertwined. Each time they clashed, it represented a life-and-death battle!

The more Qin Yu fought, the more shocked he became. Both parties were clearly in the same realm, but Qin Yu was completely at a disadvantage!

Qin Yu felt unprecedented pressure and confusion. He thrived for ways to break through, trying to find Wu Ji’s weakness.

In the repeated clashes, Qin Yu constantly adjusted his fist techniques and tactics, trying different attack methods and finding ways to defeat Wu Ji.

However, Wu Ji seemed to be invulnerable. His palm turned into a fist, and each clash carried limitless power and strength. His gaze was cold and deep as if he could see through all Qin Yu’s actions and intentions.

Qin Yu felt his strength be insignificant in front of Wu Ji. Each time his fists and feet touched Wu Ji’s body, he was as if hitting an indestructible mountain peak.

Wu Ji’s strength seemed limitless, but Qin Yu was gradually exhausted. His body had already suffered severe injuries, and blood was constantly gushing out of his wounds.

However, Qin Yu’s gaze showed no signs of retreat. His will was as strong as iron, and he was determined not to succumb to adversity.

“As expected of the number one chaotic body. Regardless of the physical body, internal qi, or even understanding of the dao technique, I can’t compare with him.” Qin Yu was incomparably shocked deep down. He almost could not believe there was such a powerful opponent in the world!

What shocked Qin Yu, even more, was that this was not even the true form of Wu Ji. It was merely an embodiment condensed from the heavenly tribulation and the dao technique.

Qin Yu kept retreating, planning to avoid the attack and find a flaw in Wu Ji.

However, Wu Ji had almost no flaws. He had the most perfect body and the deepest understanding of the dao technique. He had even created his own unique dao techniques. It was almost impossible to defeat him!

In just a while, Qin Yu’s injuries multiplied, and he began to gasp for breath.

However, Wu Ji’s palm was still turning the world upside down, wanting to obliterate everything!

At this moment, Qin Yu finally understood how aggrieved the people of the same generation as Wu Ji were!

Being in the same world with such a monster was simply a disaster. There was no chance for them to stand out!

“Buzz!”

At the same time, Wu Ji shattered the void again. A gigantic hand turned into a fist and headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu could not dodge and immediately clenched his fist to face the attack! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
