Chapter 1486: Chapter 1,486, Greedy First Elder 1

Wen Da and Wen er tiptoed and reached out their hands to Qin Yu’s crotch.

Qin Yu’s pupils contracted while he was cultivating. An internal Qi instantly shook the two of them away!

The two of them staggered back a few steps and finally sat down on the ground.

“You two bastards, what are you trying to do!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

Wen Da and Wen Er got up from the ground and said with an embarrassed smile, “Nothing much, nothing much. Seeing that you are so uncomfortable, I thought you...”

“I thought you were having menstrual cramps,”Wen da said with a smile.

“F * CK Your Grandpa.”Qin Yu rolled his eyes at the two of them. “Don’t come and disturb me. If anything happens, I can’t guarantee your safety.”

The two of them smiled sheepishly and said, “Alright, Hurry up and cultivate. I Won’t disturb you.”

The two of them muttered as they walked, “I told you that he might be a woman.”

“Impossible, absolutely impossible!”

“...”

Qin Yu looked at the two clowns and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry for a moment.

Then, he closed his eyes again and began to swallow the nascent soul pill.

Heavenly Cloud sect.

The first elder had been in seclusion in the cultivation room for several days. In front of him was a sacred heart technique.

And this sacred heart technique was only an incomplete copy.

But even so, the first elder still tasted the sweetness.

He opened his eyes and said with a shocked expression, “This sacred heart technique... really lives up to its reputation!”

The Sacred Heart technique was considered a mental cultivation technique. With this mental cultivation technique, the first elder’s cultivation speed was several times faster!

In other words, with the blessing of the Sacred Heart technique, even the weak spiritual Qi could bring about a great increase! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Not only that, with the blessing of the Sacred Heart technique, one’s mental state would also increase.

This cultivation technique was simply unparalleled in the world!

“Unfortunately, it’s only an incomplete copy...”first elder muttered in a low voice.

At this moment, first elder was even greedier towards the Sacred Heart Technique!

“If the entire Heavenly Cloud sect cultivates the Sacred Heart technique, why would our heavenly cloud sect have to live in a small southern region!”The first elder became even more excited!

“First Elder, how’s your cultivation these few days?”

At this moment, a voice sounded.

Following that, the black-robed man suddenly appeared at the door.

The first elder’s expression changed slightly. He withdrew the smile on his face and coldly said, “Who told you to come here? If the sect master finds out, he will definitely kill you!”

The black-robed man raised his head and looked at the Cultivation Mountain that was suspended in the sky. He smiled and said, “The sect master of the Tianyun sect should have already entered closed-door cultivation. He will probably not leave for a while.”

First Elder snorted coldly and said, “It seems that you all know the Tianyun sect very well.”

“Hahaha, First Elder, you must be joking. I only found out by chance.”The black-robed man said with a faint smile.

“First Elder, I wonder how you feel about the Sacred Heart technique of the northern lands?”

Although the first elder had a great longing for the Sacred Heart technique, he still said, “Hehe, it can only be considered pretty good. Compared to my Tianyun sect, it’s not worth mentioning.”

The black-robed man obviously knew what the first elder was thinking, but he did not expose it.

“First Elder, if you agree to my proposal, I will give you the rest of the Sacred Heart Technique,”the black-robed man said with a faint smile.

A hint of greed flashed across the first Elder’s face. Even though he was extremely patient, it was still difficult for him to hide the thoughts in his heart.

“Of course, I will keep my promise to you. The unique techniques of the northern lands are endless. A mere sacred heart technique is nothing,”the black-robed man continued.

The first elder fell silent. He was indeed tempted.

“I can promise you,”first elder said in a deep voice a moment later.

The black-robed man was instantly overjoyed. He was just about to speak when first elder continued, “But I have a condition.”

“Don’t even mention one condition. Ten conditions won’t be a problem!”The black-robed man said with a smile.

A trace of viciousness flashed in first Elder’s eyes. He said coldly, “I want you to kill that Qin Yu!”

“Qin Yu?”The black-robed man raised his eyebrows. “Is it that young man?”

“That’s right. You must know that Qin Yu is very close to Xiao Hai and the others. If one day you step into the South Province, this Qin Yu will definitely still be your enemy,”said the first elder indifferently.

The black-robed man smiled and said, “He is also your enemy, right?”

The first elder coldly snorted and didn’t say anything.

“Killing a Puny Qin Yu is not worth mentioning. However... according to our understanding, that Qin Yu is at Mount Hua Ning.”The black-robed man rubbed his chin.

“Mount Hua Ning is the territory of the absolute dance. This absolute dance... is not easy to deal with.”

First Elder snorted coldly and said, “Didn’t you say that there are many talented people in the northern lands? Why, you can’t even deal with a puny absolute dance? If that’s the case, why is there a need for us to cooperate?”

“Hahaha!”The black-robed man could not help but laugh loudly, “Alright, since that’s the case, I’ll agree to it. Treat it as my northern lands surrendering!”

This sentence of “Surrendering”was quite useful to first elder.

He nodded slightly and said, “Then it’s settled. You Bring Qin Yu’s corpse to see me. I’ll definitely do what I promised you.”

“It’s a deal.”The black-robed man nodded slightly, then turned around and left.

...

In a certain desert in the South Province.

The black-robed man rushed all the way here. In front of him stood an extremely tall man.

This man’s entire body was wrapped in a thick black fog. He looked quite similar to he teng back then.

“How is it? Did he agree?”The man wrapped in the Black Fog said coldly.

The black-robed person cupped his hands and said, “Sir, he agreed. However, he has a condition. He wants us to kill Qin Yu.”

“Kill Qin Yu?”The person in the black fog seemed to be somewhat puzzled.

“Yes. Qin Yu has a deep hatred with the heavenly cloud sect. He wants to use our hands to get rid of this Qin Yu,”said the black-robed person.

“I’ll leave this matter to you.”The black fog rolled and the voice sounded.

The black-robed man shook his head and said, “Sir, killing Qin Yu is nothing. However, this Qin Yu has a unique dance at Mount Hua Ning. I’m afraid that I’m not her match by myself. Sir, please help me increase the number of people.”

The Black Fog was silent for a moment before saying, “Go ahead. I’ll send someone to help you in three days.”

“Thank you, sir.”The black-robed man bowed and the black fog slowly disappeared.

...

On Mount Hua Ning, Qin Yu had been in closed-door cultivation for a full ten days.

During these ten days, Qin Yu had only swallowed sixty nascent soul pills after using all his strength.

Not only that, these sixty nascent soul pills had yet to be fully digested.

On the other hand, Wen Da and Wen Er had been drinking all day, leading a leisurely life.

“It’s a pity there aren’t any beauties. Sigh.”Wen Da sighed.

Wen er muttered softly, “Actually, Aunt Jue Wu is quite pretty.”

“F * ck you!”Wen Da kicked Wen Er’s butt.

As he was speaking, Jue Wu’s voice came from not far away.

“Aiya, I’ve been so tired these past few days. Quick, get me something to Eat!”Jue Wu said loudly.
