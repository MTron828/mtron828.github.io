Chapter 562: Stepping Into the Martial Marquis Realm! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Crack!

The heavenly tribulation that contained the power of nature smashed onto Qin Yu’s golden body!

Crack!s appeared on his body, as if it was about to be shattered!

Even so, Qin Yu was still unfazed. His face didn’t even show any emotion!

“Could... could it be that this kid wants to use the heavenly tribulation to temper his body?!” Gu Canghai seemed to have understood something!

He couldn’t help but gasp!

When others faced the heavenly tribulation, they did all they could to avoid it. They prepared all kinds of magical artifacts to deal with it so that they wouldn’t die under the heavenly tribulation.

However, not only did Qin Yu not avoid it, but he even treated the heavenly tribulation as an opportunity to temper himself!

Such crazy behavior was simply unheard of!

“It’s... It’s too terrifying!” Everyone gasped at this moment!

Gu Canghai broke out in cold sweat and felt his legs go weak!

At this moment, he suddenly began to regret provoking Qin Yu!

“I don’t believe you can withstand it with your physical body!” Gu Canghai said angrily!

Qin Yu’s actions seemed to have angered the heavens. A third bolt of lightning slowly brewed in the dark clouds, and a silver light lit up the entire sky.

“Boom!”

A deafening sound exploded! The silver lightning increased by a few more degrees! In an instant, it smashed the entire ground!

Qin Yu’s body was shattered by this heavenly tribulation!

“Good, good! Kill a crazy person like him!” Gu Canghai couldn’t help but shout excitedly when he saw this!

However, Qin Yu’s shattered body was slowly healing.

“How comfortable...” Qin Yu licked his lips, and a frenzied expression appeared on his face!

“Boom!”

The fourth bolt of heavenly tribulation descended! This time, it turned the scene into a sea of lightning!

Everything within a few meters turned silver!

Those who couldn’t dodge in time turned into ashes on the spot!

“Quickly retreat!” Everyone hurriedly shouted when they saw this!

Afraid that they would be affected by this heavenly tribulation, countless people retreated!

Even Gu Canghai didn’t dare to come any closer!

Qin Yu’s body was bathed in golden light, with golden and silver light interweaving together. The scene looked both terrifying and magnificent!

His body was constantly being shattered and sparkling white bones were revealed.

But every time it was shattered, his body would slowly heal!

The fifth heavenly tribulation descended! This time, Qin Yu’s body seemed to have become much tougher!

The sixth bolt of heavenly tribulation only broke Qin Yu’s skin!

The seventh bolt of heavenly tribulation only left white marks on Qin Yu’s body!

The eighth bolt, the ninth bolt...

Every time the heavenly tribulation descended, Qin Yu’s body became a few times stronger!

When the tenth bolt of heavenly tribulation descended, Qin Yu was completely unafraid of the heavenly tribulation!

And his body also became indestructible at this moment!

The golden light was restrained, and his physical body flickered!

“Oh no!” Gu Canghai’s expression was extremely unsightly!

At this rate, Qin Yu might really step into the Martial Marquis Realm!

“If he steps into the Martial Marquis Realm, I’m afraid I won’t be able to retaliate at all.” Gu Canghai took a deep breath.

His eyes narrowed slightly, then he snorted coldly, turned around, and left!

No one had expected Gu Canghai to take advantage of this opportunity to escape!

“Sect Master Gu has left. Let’s hurry and retreat.” The others also felt that something was amiss.

They exchanged a glance, and immediately left the Green Moon Villa!

Gu Canghai sped away while desperately rushing towards the Saint Confucian Sect.

“I must inform the Yan family of this news as soon as possible!” Gu Canghai said through gritted teeth.

At this moment, he could no longer care about Yan Sihai’s thoughts. The most important thing was to save his life!

...

In the Green Moon Villa, the sky was still buzzing with thunder and lightning.

Everyone looked at Qin Yu, who was bathing in the silver light, and there was some excitement in their eyes.

The eleventh, the twelfth... A total of eighteen heavenly tribulations fell on Qin Yu’s body!

At this time, the heavenly tribulation could no longer cause any damage to Qin Yu!

Finally, the heavenly tribulation began to slowly disappear.

The gray clouds also slowly retreated, revealing the sunlight once again.

At Qin Yu’s dantian, streaks of golden light flickered!

Looking inside, one could see that within this dantian, there was a marble-sized Golden Core that was resting in the lower abdomen.

This was the symbol of the Golden Core Stage! It also corresponded to the Martial Marquis Realm of the martial arts world! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was quiet all around. Qin Yu stood there without saying anything for a long time, as if he was feeling the uncontrollable power in his body.

“Finally... I’ve reached the Martial Marquis Realm!” Qin Yu’s eyes shone brightly!

At first glance, Qin Yu didn’t have much internal qi. Instead, he looked like an ordinary person.

However, his body, sparkling and translucent, had become like a piece of jade!

“Congratulations, Mr. Qin!” Zhen Yue was the first to react.

Then, everyone shouted in unison, “Congratulations, Sect Master Qin!”

The entire Green Moon Villa burst into cheers!

At this moment, Qin Yu was like their God!

Looking at the corpses on the ground, Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with killing intent.

“So many people died... Saint Confucian Sect, you will pay the price!” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, he took a step forward and arrived in front of Yan Jiang in an instant.

At this time, Yan Jiang’s body was already severely injured, and he looked terrible.

Qin Yu hurriedly picked up Yan Jiang, raised his palm, and placed it on Yan Jiang’s chest.

“Fortunately, I was in time,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He used spiritual energy to seal all of Yan Jiang’s vital points, and saved Yan Jiang’s life.

After that, Qin Yu checked every single one of them. As long as they could be saved, Qin Yu wouldn’t give up.

An hour passed.

Zhen Yue frowned and said, “Mr. Qin, more than 30 of our people died.”

“More than 30 people...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel upset.

These people died because of him. They were all innocent people.

“Gu Canghai... It’s time for you to pay the price,” Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, Gu Canghai was pacing back and forth in the Saint Confucian Sect. He was extremely uneasy.

He was terrified and worried.

Once Qin Yu barged into the Saint Confucian Sect, no one would be able to stop him!

Thinking of this, Gu Canghai took out his phone while trembling.

He braced himself and dialed Yan Sihai’s number.

Once the call was connected, Yan Sihai said coldly, “How is it? Is Qin Yu dead?”

Gu Canghai didn’t know how to explain for a moment.

Yan Sihai frowned and said, “I’m asking you a question! Is Qin Yu dead?”

Gu Canghai swallowed hard and braced himself as he said, “President... President Yan, I have bad news for you. Qin Yu... Qin Yu has stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm...”
