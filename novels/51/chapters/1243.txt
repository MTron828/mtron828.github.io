Chapter 1244: Chapter 1,244, use your technique to temper your body 

Countless amounts of spiritual qi surged into his internal QI, crazily replenishing the Qi that he had used up.

Everyone was shocked by this technique. Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

“Jiang Yi is able to create such a technique on his own. He is indeed a genius!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise!

The internal Qi lingered around his body and kept pouring into his body.

As a result, Jiang Yi’s internal Qi could never be exhausted! Even if he exhausted himself, he could still exhaust people to death!

Qin Yu stared at Jiang Yi and couldn’t help but exclaim, “Is this really a technique you created yourself?”

“What else?”Jiang Yi sneered.

“Qin Yu, even if I exhaust you, I can still exhaust you to death!”

After saying that, Jiang Yi made a comeback.

Not only did he create this kind of internal Qi recovery technique, but he also created his own extraordinary speed.

Although this speed was not as fast as the line formula, it was still worthy of praise. It was definitely not something that an ordinary person could catch up to.

Moreover, Qin Yu did not have the support of spiritual power, so he could only rely on his physical body. This made it even more impossible for Qin Yu to chase after Jiang Yi.

The great battle was about to start, and the sky was filled with spells.

Each of Jiang Yi’s spells was extremely powerful, smashing the entire ground into a pile of rubble.

The surrounding people were dumbstruck. The battle between the two of them was extremely enjoyable, and it seemed that it would be very difficult to determine the victor in a short period of time.

One relied on the endless divine power of his physical body, while the other relied on the internal Qi that came from heaven and earth. The two of them were both top-notch people.

This battle lasted from day to night. Even though Qin Yu’s body was indestructible, there were many wounds on his body.

However, these wounds didn’t damage his foundation, so they weren’t worth mentioning.

Seeing that the sky was getting darker, Jiang Yi’s frown became tighter and tighter.

He really didn’t expect Qin Yu’s body to be able to reach such a terrifying state. It seemed to be a difficult thing to defeat Qin Yu.

Not only that, if he was accidentally close to Qin Yu, he would probably be blasted into pieces in an instant.

“Such an attack can’t hurt him at all.”Jiang Yi felt an extreme headache.

Qin Yu could not help but frown.

He had no way to catch Jiang Yi.

If the other party did not fight him in close combat, then the godly power in his body would be useless.

No matter how strong his physical body was, he would only be reduced to a living target.

The next time we fight, I must catch him by surprise, Qin Yu thought to himself.

I must think of a way to trick the other party into coming over and then capture his body.

The spells in the sky were still unceasing, and for a time, no one could do anything to the other.

However, Qin Yu wasn’t as anxious as Jiang Yi. After all, Qin Yu didn’t use even a trace of his spiritual power, which gave Jiang Yi a headache.

More importantly, Jiang Yi’s realm was far higher than Qin Yu’s.

If they were at the same realm, they probably didn’t even have the qualifications to fight.

“What should I do...”Jiang Yi froze in the air and looked around.

He had used all his trump cards and entered a situation where he was at his wit’s end.

Jiang Yi couldn’t leave or stay.

“Sigh.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly let out a long sigh. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jiang Yi looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “What?”

Qin Yu said with a faint smile, “I didn’t use my spiritual power, but I can easily defeat you. Do you think there’s a need for us to fight?”

Jiang Yi sneered and said, “Qin Yu, don’t think that I don’t know that you can’t use your spiritual power at all.”

“Yes, that’s right.”Qin Yu didn’t deny it.

He smiled faintly and said, “What are you here for? You Want to kill me? I don’t think so.”

“The reason why you work so hard is to prove that you’re stronger than me.”

Jiang Yi snorted lightly and said, “That’s right.”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “So? Under the premise that I can’t use my spiritual power, you can’t hurt me. What’s the need for you to keep pestering me?”

Jiang Yi’s expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

That’s right. If Qin Yu wasn’t infected by the Twilight Qi and could use his spiritual power normally, he wouldn’t be his opponent.

In other words, even if Qin Yu didn’t have spiritual power, as long as he had a spell that approached him quickly, the battle would be without suspense.

Even though that was the case, Jiang Yi didn’t want to leave.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You are saying this because you want to negotiate with me, right? So, you admit defeat?”

“Admit defeat?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered, “I just don’t want to embarrass you too much.”

“Embarrass me too much? hahahaha! What a joke!”Jiang Yi raised his head and laughed.

“Qin Yu, don’t flatter yourself. If you can’t do it, then you can’t do it! As long as you admit it, I will leave right now!”

Looking at the stubborn Jiang Yi, Qin Yu let out a long sigh again.

He slowly sat cross-legged on the ground and raised his head to look at Jiang Yi.

“Since you’re so stubborn, don’t blame me for not caring about senior Jiang he’s feelings,”Qin Yu grinned and said.

Jiang Yi’s pupils suddenly constricted and he said coldly, “What do you want?”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Haven’t you always thought that it’s because of me that you hurt your fragile self-esteem? Fine, then I’ll hurt you completely and throw your poor self-esteem on the ground to trample on.”

With that, Qin Yu withdrew all the strength in his body.

He sat cross-legged and said in a low voice, “Even steel needs to be tempered a thousand times, let alone my body. Come, use your magic to temper my body.”

When he said this, everyone was shocked!

And Jiang Yi’s face changed greatly!

Veins bulged on his forehead, and his teeth clenched so hard that they made cracking sounds!

“Qin Yu, you... You’ve gone too far! !”Jiang Yi raised his head and roared angrily, as if he was extremely angry.

On the other hand, Qin Yu was a man of his word. He sat cross-legged on the ground and didn’t move at all. He planned to use his physical body to receive Jiang Yi’s spell, so as to achieve the goal of body tempering.
