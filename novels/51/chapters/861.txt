Chapter 862: Chapter 862, dispatch a martial saint!

After doing all this, Qin Yu turned around and left without even turning his head.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association was destroyed, and all the purple robes were killed!

This news quickly swept through the entire martial arts forum!

For a moment, everyone was discussing this matter.

The various martial arts aristocratic families were even more anxious.

Although they possessed martial power, they did not have as powerful a network as the Yan family.

Hence, these people could not help but start to worry.

And at this moment, Qin Yu had already returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

On the Pavilion Master’s Building, Qin Yu smiled and said, “I really did not expect that I would be able to rush back for the New Year.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yes.”The pavilion master nodded and said.

“I also did not expect that you would really kill purple robe.”

Qin Yu took a sip of tea and said with a sneer, “This is just the beginning.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s vision went black again, and he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and he couldn’t help but frown.

“If this happens during a fight, I’m afraid you’ll Lose Your Life,”the pavilion master said with a frown.

Qin Yu said with some melancholy, “Yes, we must think of a way to solve this matter.”

The pavilion master said in a low voice, “Besides using the pill, there is another method.”

“What method?”Qin Yu quickly asked.

The pavilion master said, “As long as you enter the Martial Saint Realm, you can abandon the Golden Pill.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but smile bitterly, “Then who knows when.”

“Isn’t there a prophecy that you will enter the Martial Saint Realm next year?”The pavilion master said with a smile.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “This matter has made me rather worried.”

“Oh?”The pavilion master raised his eyebrows.

Qin Yu continued, “The prophecy only states that someone will become a martial saint next year, but it doesn’t say who it will be.”

“If the first person to become a martial saint is not me but someone else, then I’m afraid it will be troublesome.”

The pavilion master nodded, indicating for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu guessed, “In the current era, martial saints are not allowed to appear. However, all martial saints are old martial saints from many years ago.”

“I’ve seen the history of martial arts. In the past one hundred years, no one has stepped into the martial saint realm.”

“Although I don’t know the reason, as long as a new person steps into the martial saint realm, I think the rules set by the DAO Protector will cease to exist.”

“At that time... the martial saint in the secret realm will be born.”

A trace of surprise flashed across the pavilion master’s face.

“What you said makes sense.”The pavilion master said.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I can’t guarantee that I will be the first person to enter the martial saint realm. This world is too big, and there are many experts.”

This time, even the pavilion master did not have full confidence.

She said in a deep voice, “Then what do you plan to do?”

Qin Yu said, “I’ve prepared two plans.”

“Either you step into the martial saint realm as soon as possible, or you find a place to hide.”

As for this place to hide, Qin Yu had already thought of a place.

That was the secret realm at the spiritual spring of the Green Moon Villa.

That secret realm was an ownerless secret realm, and no one knew about it. Even the JINGDU martial arts association could not find it.

“After the new year, I will look for Gu Xinghe and use him to threaten Gu Zizhen,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The pavilion master did not express any opinion on this.

Just as the two of them were talking, Qin Yu suddenly sensed someone walking in from the door.

“Someone is coming,”the two of them said almost at the same time.

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He closed his eyes slightly and sensed the other party’s internal Qi.

“Another half-step martial saint.”Qin Yu said with a frown.

The pavilion master nodded and said, “At this rate, it’s only a matter of time before someone becomes a martial saint.”

As he spoke, the pavilion master was about to go downstairs.

Qin Yu said with a smile, “Pavilion Master, why don’t you try this killing formation?”

The pavilion master hesitated for a moment before he said with a smile, “Good Idea.”

The two of them immediately jumped down from the pavilion master’s Building and arrived at the square. They waited quietly for each other.

Not long after, a burly man walked in.

This person had a strong build and an extraordinary aura. He looked extremely oppressive with his internal Qi.

“Who are you?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

The other party took a step forward and did not say a word.

“It’s me.”

At this moment, a voice was heard.

Looking sideways, he saw a familiar face walking in.

When he saw this person, Qin Yu was immediately shocked.

“Old Mister Yan? Why are you here?”Qin Yu hurriedly withdrew the murderous aura from his body and walked over quickly.

Old Mister Yan laughed and said, “It’s the New Year. If I don’t come here, where else can I go?”

Qin Yu pointed at the burly man at the side and said, “Who is he?”

That burly man cupped his hands and said, “I am old Mister Yan’s bodyguard.”

Qin Yu could not help but suck in a cold breath.

Old Mister Yan could actually find a half-step martial saint to be his bodyguard?

“Old Mister Yan, where have you been all this year?”The pavilion master greeted him.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “It’s a long story.”

“Let’s go upstairs first,”the pavilion master said politely.

The three of them immediately headed upstairs.

There were only three days left until the New Year.

At this moment, the news of what happened at the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had already spread to the second secret realm.

The Shadows of the various higher-ups descended on Gu Zizhen’s main hall.

Gu Zizhen, Gu Xinghe, and the others knelt on the ground, unable to get up.

“No matter what, I want you to kill Qin Yu,”the higher-ups ordered.

They didn’t say it explicitly, but their intentions were very clear.

Gu Zizhen and Gu Xinghe were both smart people, so they quickly understood what the higher-ups meant.

“Please rest assured, higher-ups,”the father and son said with cupped hands.

The higher-ups didn’t say anything, and their phantoms slowly disappeared.

After they left, Gu Xinghe flew into a rage and cursed, “This Qin Yu, I want to kill him, I want to kill him! !”

Gu Zizhen’s expression also did not look too good.

The person who had taken over the Jingdu martial arts association was his son, yet such a thing had happened.

This was definitely not good news for the GU family.

“Father, what does the higher-ups mean?”Gu Xinghe asked with a gloomy face.

Gu Zizhen stroked his beard and said in a low voice, “They want me to send out a martial saint to kill Qin Yu.”

Gu Xinghe also gritted his teeth and said, “It’s just killing Qin Yu. Is it worth it for us to send out a martial saint?”

Gu Zizhen said in a low voice, “They mean, even if we have to sacrifice a martial saint, we have to get rid of this Qin Yu!”

Gu Zizhen could not help but feel a little melancholic.

He was worried that this move would anger the dao protectors.

He was even more worried that the one who would be sacrificed would not be a martial saint, but the entire second secret realm.

“Dad, this move could very well bring disaster to us,”Gu Xinghe said with a frown.

“If it really can’t be done, I’ll bring people to kill that Qin Yu Right Now!”Gu Xinghe volunteered.

Gu Zizhen did not say anything for a long time.

He was also extremely conflicted.

If a martial saint was sent out, it might anger the guardian.

However, if he disobeyed the orders of the higher-ups, he would definitely die.

After hesitating for a while, Gu Zizhen said in a deep voice, “The Guardian has not appeared for over a hundred years. It’s a problem if he’s still alive!”

“And if he disobeys the orders of the higher-ups, he’ll definitely die! Take a gamble!”
