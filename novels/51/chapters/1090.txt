Chapter 1091: 1,091 th picture, Cloud Dragon Island 

Cultivation was like a huge wave washing away the sand. There were very few people left, and those who could truly stand firm in this era could be counted on one’s fingers.

Qin Yu originally wanted to enter the picture and engage in a theoretical battle with the eight high-ranking officials.

But after hearing Yao Meng’s words, Qin Yu dismissed this idea.

There was still a month’s time before the eight high-ranking officials could descend into this world. Qin Yu simply could not afford to delay.

Other than the incomparably heavy pressure on his shoulders, Qin Yu still had some faint expectations in his heart.

The first was that the holy region was about to open. At that time, he would have the opportunity to compete with the top geniuses of the world.

The second was that as long as he entered the holy region, he would be able to meet the person he had been longing for day and night.

“It’s time to hurry up.”Qin Yu stood up.

He looked at Yao Meng and said, “Miss Yao, do me a favor.”

“Mr. Qin, please speak,”Yao Meng said politely. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qin Yu said, “Gather all the martial saints in the world to the martial arts association in Jingdu. I want to open the resources of the martial arts association in Jingdu.”

Yao Meng was slightly surprised. She covered her mouth and said, “Are you really going to do this? You have to know that this is what you sacrificed your life for.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “I have already thought it through.”

Hearing this, Yao Meng couldn’t help but say with some admiration, “Mr. Qin is really selfless and admirable.”

Qin Yu said with a wry smile, “Actually, it’s not like that. We only have one month left. So what if I monopolize these resources? I Can’t finish them all by myself.”

“Moreover, if the Holy Region Opens, I’m afraid we’ll need more help.”

Yao Meng nodded slightly and said, “I didn’t expect Mr. Qin to be so meticulous. I’ll go inform them now.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you.”

After sending Yao Meng away, Qin Yu thought of the mustache.

This dog was full of lies. He had to ask him clearly.

When Qin Yu turned around and returned to the hall, he found that the mustache was no longer there.

He released his divine sense and searched for the figure of the handlebar mustache, but he found that there was no one there at all.

“Damn it, this bastard.”Qin Yu could not help but curse in his heart.

Could it be that this dog had realized something and ran away in advance?

Although Qin Yu was somewhat unhappy, he did not have much time to waste on him.

He found Zhai Xing and walked out of the second secret realm together, arriving at the office of the martial arts association in Jingdu.

In the office, Xia Hang was flipping through a huge pile of documents.

“Qin Yu, Master Zhai Xing.”After seeing Qin Yu and Zhai Xing, Xia hang hurriedly stood up and cupped his hands.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “How is it? Have you arranged everything?”

“Don’t worry, it’s all here,”Xia Hang said.

Zhai Xing, who was at the side, could not help but frown slightly.

“Xia Hang is one of your people?”Zhai Xing asked in a low voice.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “You can say that. Or rather, it’s a partnership.”

Xia hang said in a slightly terrified manner, “What kind of virtue and ability do I have to be worthy of the word ‘partnership’...”

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and did not dwell on this topic.

On the table, there was a large pile of documents.

These documents were the resources controlled by the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu.

Many of these resources had yet to be developed, such as Qingdi Park.

In the evening, Kong Yun, Chang Mang, and the others were invited to the martial arts association of Jingdu.

“Qin Yu!”

After seeing Qin Yu, Chang Mang ran over quickly and gave Qin Yu a hug.

“What a pity. I wanted to become a martial saint as soon as possible to help you. I didn’t expect you to take down the second mystic realm so quickly,”Chang Mang said with a sigh.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.”

After entering the martial saint realm, Chang Mang’s body became even stronger. At a glance, he looked like an iron tower.

It was not an exaggeration to say that his arms were thicker than Qin Yu’s thighs. He looked extremely intimidating.

After that, Qin Yu, Kong Yun, and the others chatted with each other.

This group of people were all top geniuses of the current era. Each of them possessed great strength and talent.

While they were chatting, Qin Yu noticed two people.

One was Chu he dao, and the other was Xiao Yuan.

These two people’s internal Qi was slightly different from the others, which made Qin Yu feel a little surprised.

On the body of the river, there were faint traces of sacred internal Qi. This internal Qi was extremely peaceful, and it was hard to ignore.

On the other hand, Xiao Yuan’s body had traces of feminine, feminine, and vicious, which made people extremely uncomfortable.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t say much. After all, everyone had their own way of cultivation.

“Now is not the time to chat. I think Miss Yao should have told you all,”Qin Yu said.

Everyone nodded slightly.

“It’s a pity that we didn’t kill the Gu family members with our own hands.”A hint of resentment flashed in Zhuang Teng’s eyes.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There’s still a chance. The one who controlled all of this is Gu Xinghe. He’s not dead yet.”

“He’s not dead yet? Are you serious?”Zhuang Teng immediately stood up, his eyes flashing with excitement.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. I didn’t see him in the second mystical realm. It’s said that he was sent to the first mystical realm by Gu Zizhen.”

Zhuang Teng immediately perked up when he heard that.

He clenched his fists and said through gritted teeth, “I must kill him with my own hands!”

“Alright, now is not the time to talk about this. We can’t afford to delay,”Qin Yu said.

He distributed the documents to everyone and began to choose the most valuable place among these resources.

For an entire night, everyone did not leave this office.

Under Zhai Xing’s lead, they continuously sifted through these resources and selected the best among them.

The next morning.

There were only six documents left in front of everyone.

These six documents were known as the six most dangerous places, and were resources that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had never developed.

“The six most dangerous places are the places that the Jingdu martial arts association places the most importance on, but there are many difficulties,”Zhai Xing said.

Qin Yu nodded. “Opportunities and risks often coexist. This is the truth that I have always pursued.”

After losing the protection of their families, they were no longer the high and Mighty Young Masters. They also needed to risk their lives.

“We will set off in three days,”Qin Yu said.

“Okay.”Everyone nodded slightly and agreed.

After everyone left, Qin Yu carefully studied these documents.

Among the six lands of Extremis, the most famous one was Cloud Dragon Island. It was said that there were strange flowers on this island. Each flower contained unimaginable spiritual qi.

“Let’s go to the Cloud Dragon Island in three days,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

In the next three days, Qin Yu planned to refine the divine sense of the more than ten thousand martial marquis.

If he could successfully devour them, it would not be difficult for him to enter the middle stage of the martial saint realm. At that time, Qin Yu would also have a trace of capital to fight against mighty figures.

At this moment, in the first secret realm, eight higher-ups were casting spells to break the seal on this stone.
