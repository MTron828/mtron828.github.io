Xue Yuzhi pushed open the door and walked straight to Qin Yu.

She smiled and said, “Qin Yu, it’s all thanks to you this time. Otherwise, it would have been a disaster.”

“This is what I should do.” Qin Yu nodded and said.

“How is Old Master Xue now?”

Xue Yuzhi said, “My father is very well now. He is inviting you to a dinner party.”

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately nodded in agreement.

The two of them left the room together and walked towards the villa in the deepest part of the Xue family’s manor.

In the hall of the villa, a sumptuous dinner party had long been arranged.

And on both sides of the table, there were even servants standing there.

Old Master Xue was sitting in the main seat, and the three siblings of the Xue family were accompanying him on one side.

“Father, Qin Yu is here.” Xue Yuzhi brought Qin Yu to Old Master Xue.

Old Master Xue waved at Qin Yu and said in surprise, “I didn’t expect you to be so young.”

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Greetings, Old Master Xue.”

Old Master Xue waved his hand with a smile and said, “Quickly take your seat.”

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony. He found a seat and sat down.

The servant at the side immediately poured Qin Yu a cup of fine wine.

“Qin Yu, it’s all thanks to you this time. If it weren’t for you, my father would have been in big trouble.” Xue Yujie raised his cup and said.

Although Qin Yu felt a little embarrassed, he still raised his cup and clinked it with Xue Yujie’s.

At the table, Xue Yuzhi kept praising Qin Yu. She repeated all the praise from the Pavilion Master.

After a few rounds of toasts...

Old Master Xue said, “Qin Yu, you saved my life. If there’s anything you want, just say it.”

“That’s right. Whether it’s money, women, or herbs, just say it!” Xue Yujie also said.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. He raised his head to look at Old Master Xue and said in a deep voice, “I don’t need any of these. I only want one thing.”

“Speak.” Old Master Xue nodded.

“I want the power of the Martial Saint.” Qin Yu said.

Upon hearing this, the crowd instantly fell into silence.

Everyone looked at each other and frowned.

“No.” Old Master Xue said coldly.

“The power of the Martial Saint is the foundation of the Xue family. Even my life isn’t as important as the power of the Martial Saint!” Old Master Xue’s face showed some displeasure.

Xue Yujie, who was beside him, also quickly said, “Qin Yu, change your condition. Other than the power of the Martial Saint, we can agree to anything.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “To tell you the truth, the reason I came to the Xue family this time is for the power of the Martial Saint. Other than the power of the Martial Saint, I don’t need anything else.”

Hearing these words, Old Master Xue immediately slammed the table and stood up!

He shouted angrily, “I will never give you the power of the Martial Saint! You’d better give up!”

After saying that, Old Master Xue waved his hand and said, “Give him a sum of money and let him go!”

Xue Yuzhi was also a little anxious. She pulled Qin Yu and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, quickly change your condition.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Auntie Xue, I don’t think I need anything else other than the power of the Martial Saint.”

Xue Yujie took out a bank card and said, “There’s one billion inside. You can take it.”

Qin Yu glanced at it and pushed the bank card back. He shook his head and said, “I don’t need money.”

“You didn’t want it yourself!” Old Master Xue said coldly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh when he saw this.

It was indeed not that easy to obtain the power of the Martial Saint.

After all, the Xue family wasn’t the wealthy Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

To the aristocratic families, the power of a Martial Saint was their most important foundation.

Unless there was a calamity that would wipe out the entire family, they would never use the power of a Martial Saint.

The warm atmosphere from just now had turned extremely cold in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu slowly stood up and was about to say goodbye.

At this moment, two people suddenly barged in from outside the door.

These two people had strong bodies, strong internal qi, and fierce muscles. They weren’t to be trifled with.

“Who are you people?!” Xue Yujie quickly stood up and berated loudly.

These two people sneered and said, “We are from the Purple Flame Sect.”

When they heard the three words ‘Purple Flame Sect’, the expressions of the people in the room instantly changed slightly.

The two of them walked straight to the dining table and sat down. Then, they asked indifferently, “Who’s in charge?”

Old Master Xue took a deep breath. Just as he was about to speak, Xue Yujie stood up and said, “I am. What’s the matter?”

“Hehe.” The Purple Flame Sect’s people casually grabbed a piece of meat and stuffed it into their mouths.

Then, as he chewed the meat, he said, “Something happened to the Purple Flame Sect’s people in the Xue family. You have to give us an explanation for this matter.”

“Your people?” Xue Yujie’s brows immediately furrowed.

Qin Yu’s expression also didn’t look too good.

The two people from the Purple Flame Sect had died at his hands.

“I killed those two people.” Qin Yu stood up and said.

“If you want revenge, look for me.”

Hearing this, the two people from the Purple Flame Sect couldn’t help but frown.

They looked at each other and then said, “Kid, what’s your relationship with the Xue family?”

Qin Yu said, “There’s no relationship at all. I’m here to treat Old Master Xue’s illness.”

The two people’s brows instantly furrowed even more tightly.

“Hehe, regardless of whether you have any relationship with the Xue family or not, the people had an accident in the Xue family. The Purple Flame Sect wants to settle the score with the Xue family.” The two people snorted coldly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“As for you, the Purple Flame Sect won’t let you off either.”

Qin Yu was just about to speak when Xue Yujie stopped Qin Yu and said, “Then what do you want?”

These two people stood up, stretched their bodies, and said with a nonchalant smile, “Our sect master said that as long as you are willing to submit to the Purple Flame Sect, this matter can be settled.”

“Otherwise... not even a chicken or a dog will be spared!”

Xue Yujie said with a cold look, “Aren’t you going a little overboard? As far as I know, it was the Purple Flame Sect people who caused trouble in the Xue family. That’s why...”

“Stop talking about those useless things.” The two of them waved their hands impatiently.

“I’ll give you three days to consider. If you don’t make a decision after three days, our sect master will not give you any more chances!”

After saying that, the two of them stood up and left.

Looking at their departing backs, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown and said, “I killed them. I will bear the responsibility for this matter.”

Xue Yujie shook his head and said, “It has nothing to do with you. The Purple Flame Sect is obviously here for the Xue family. They are just looking for an excuse to attack the Xue family.”
