Chapter 2565 All Arrived

He punched out with a sinister smile, and an exaggerated sound that hurt people’s eardrums sounded like an explosion.

His strength and timing had reached their peak and were not avoidable.

The space suddenly exploded, and the glass-like fragments shattered and turned into spatial qi that filled the sky.

He entered the space again, and the distorted and reversed world instantly returned to its original state.

Yan Ruoxue was in one of the spaces.

As this space turned into a bloody mist, Qin Yu’s face was ashen and almost fell to the ground.

He Teng’s expression suddenly changed, and his sinister smile suddenly froze.

At this moment, a powerful energy suddenly surged at the spot where Yan Ruoxue had died. The blood, flesh, and soul that filled the sky seemed to be mobilized by some spells, and the outline of a body began to construct on the spot.

The Destiny Reincarnation Technique, the most powerful technique of the Yan family’s immortal scripture, was an immortal technique that could be used nine times in a lifetime.

Yan Ruoxue opened her eyes and emanated an even more terrifying internal qi.

She seemed to be stronger after experiencing the baptism of life and death.

“Hmph, I want to see how many times you can reincarnate.”

He Teng revealed a cold expression.

“Ruoxue, be careful!”

Qin Yu was burning with anxiety at this moment, feeling going out to fight was a thousand times better than staying inside.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine…”

Although Yan Ruoxue did not know why Qin Yu was inside the barrier, she knew there must be a particular reason.

On the ground, countless green, blue, and red blood slowly squirmed, like a poisonous snake that was choosing to devour people.

The people who were swept into this blood river turned into white bones in an instant, and their life force sucked dry.

From the beginning, the lives of thousands of experts had been lost in this blood river.

Blood flowed on the ground, and the sky was full of blood mist.

The life force absorbed by the blood river had all entered his body, rapidly increasing his strength.

“How comfortable! War is indeed a good thing!”

It opened its bloody mouth, and tens of thousands of bloody claws suddenly stretched out from the bloody mist.

Some of the people who were caught off guard and had their bodies scratched by the bloody claws instantly shriveled up. Only a piece of human skin fell off in the blink of an eye.

Blood Shadow Entanglement!

Countless threads as fine as blood vessels appeared in the blood mist and wrapped around nearby people like vines.

Like just now, many people were sucked dry.

In this brutal battlefield, the blood monster’s uniquely advantageous cultivation techniques had become the most lethal against the human race.

“Boom!”

A figure suddenly descended from the sky. Its body was like a cannonball that landed before the blood monster.

“Stinky thing, I’m here!”

Unparalleled!

Chang Mang let out a roar, and dark energy swam through his skin as if it were a fish.

In an instant, his entire skeletal structure seemed to have expanded by 30%.

It made his muscles as strong as iron, his bones unbreakable, and his skin as resilient as armor.

Amid the palm shadows that filled the sky, the blood monster’s body was battered and left in a wretched state.

However, he recovered almost instantly. The attacks of several Godly Kings in the surroundings landed on Chang Mang’s body almost simultaneously.

However, after being smashed, he charged at the monster race living beings as if nothing had happened.

The simple violent punch and kick techniques forcibly chiseled out a gap.

“You’re courting death!”

A cold light flashed in the Asura Godly King’s eyes and his body had already transformed into a stream of light.

The sharp claws that were as sharp as divine weapons instantly imprinted on Chang Mang’s chest, wanting to rip his heart out.

Chang Mang grinned malevolently as he grabbed Asura Godly King’s arm, using him like a sandbag as he ruthlessly smashed him toward the monster race army.

Instantly, the monster race smashed by this huge force directly turned into a large piece of meat pie.

“Is it that fierce?”

Qin Yu was somewhat stunned, although this attack did not cause much damage to the Asura Godly King.

However, the Asura Godly King was also a powerful monster race Godly King among the fifth level. Chang Mang had been following Immortal Emperor Yao’s instructions to temper his holy body, and the rate of advancement was also tremendously terrifying.

Jue Wu, Flower Granny, Lei Xin, and many others from the Human Race Watch who had been keeping watch in the vicinity also gradually arrived.

However, in a battle as such, a single person’s strength could not cause a massive wave.

Even if Flower Granny and Lei Xin Rey had made some progress, the monster race was not weak either.

The ground was burning with demonic flames, and a large number of living beings died every second.

In this kind of battlefield, even a fifth level would die.

As time passed, the human race had gradually retreated to a small circle.

Three days had passed since the battle began.

Nearly half of the human race had fallen, and 300,000 to 400,000 human race had tragically perished within the boundaries of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

The blood on the ground flowed slowly, forming pools of blood in the countless deep pits as a result of the bombardment.

“Bang!”

The halberd pierced through Yan Ruoxue again. After a burst of energy gathered, she reappeared on the spot.

At this moment, her face was ashen. Although her internal qi remained strong, she was already at the end of her rope.

Even if fate turned around, there was a price to pay. At this moment, she had already reached her limit.

If she died again, she would completely disappear from this world.

Countless ugly-looking orcs dug trenches, channeling fresh blood into the rear areas.

There were also a vast number of giants transporting corpses, dragging an immense number of bodies toward the rear.

The obscure chanting suddenly echoed throughout the valley, and the low and dull voice unexpectedly suppressed the clamor of battle cries.

The endless number of monster race priests chanted loudly, and a huge altar in the middle of them emitted earth-shaking fluctuations.

As the monster race Path of Heaven’s internal qi descended, thousands of dark blades appeared in the air. These blades were burning with demonic flames.

As the chant stopped, the blades shot toward the humans like arrows.

The Blade of Destruction!

As the priest pushed out with both hands, the blade was like the scythe of the Grim Reaper, harvesting the lives of the human race.

“That’s holy energy! Don’t touch these blades!”

Qin Yu roared. He did not understand this power previously.

At this moment, he finally understood the monster race’s power of sacrifice. It was the internal qi of the Saint’s world.

The quality of the holy energy triggered by the blood and corpses of sheer quality was profoundly high, although this sacrifice was not conducted by a living being. It was even higher than the internal qi Qin Yu had absorbed in the Saint’s world.
