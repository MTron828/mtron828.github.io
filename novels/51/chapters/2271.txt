2272 Confrontation

Wu Feng’s expression changed. He looked somewhat unnatural.

“Little Brother, I understand you want to seize the opportunity, but don’t overestimate yourself, haha.”

The man with a sinister expression sneered and said.

“This place relies on one’s strength, not treasures, do you understand? A piece of trash who escaped from the Holy Region wanted to seize a great opportunity? You’re still far from it being a fourth-grade True Saint.”

Shui Yuan stared at him viciously.

“I’m standing right here. If anyone has any objections, chase me away from here.”

Qin Yu sneered and said.

“Are you courting death?”

The dark vulture cultivator clawed at Qin Yu and crushed his protective chaotic qi with five fingers.

It sank into Qin Yu’s body, and then a massive force surged into each finger.

However, no matter how hard he tried, he could only leave a fingerprint on Qin Yu’s body.

“You don’t have enough strength.”

A raging black fire burned in front of Qin Yu’s body. A terrifying fist wind blasted out from the black fire and landed on the man’s body.

The black fire burned fiercely on the dark vulture man when they came into contact. He stepped back embarrassedly and took a while to put out the black fire.

“Fourth-grade domain? It seemed to be the domain power of the previous era. However, it was very rare to be able to comprehend the power of rules before the fifth grade.”

Situ Haoyue asked curiously.

The evil exterminator looked into the depths of the ground expressionlessly as if he was trying to investigate the situation underground.

“Do you really think you’re invincible just because you have a few treasures? I want to see how much strength you can display in this space suppressed by the rules.”

Wu Feng sneered and said.

A heavy saber slashed out horizontally, and the massive saber qi seemed to have split the ghostly qi into two spaces.

The saber qi contained a massive chain of rules, and he stood fiercely on Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu held the saber qi in his hand, and the power of destruction transmitted from his palm.

In an instant, the saber qi broke apart straight away. Qin Yu kicked Wu Feng’s abdomen, sending him flying.

“You can also get lost now.”

Qin Yu stared at Shui Yuan and said coldly.

“How dare you!”

Shui Yuan’s expression suddenly changed. However, after seeing Qin Yu’s unfriendly gaze, he forcefully swallowed the second half of his sentence.

Here, once Qin Yu intended to kill him, no one would have the mood to save him.

“No, he can’t go to this Mystic Realm. I won’t allow it!”

Zong Yue’s face almost contorted.

The evil exterminator and Chang Ye were old monsters who had lived for many years, and Xi Menn was also ruthless.

He would never allow someone who appeared out of nowhere to stand before him and have conflicts with him more than once.

“He can’t go. I’ve already conceded that I only want two spots, but I won’t allow him to appear on the list. Otherwise, I’d rather destroy the token of the Ghost Mansion than compromise!”

Gu Ming said coldly. He dared not be negligent in front of the few geniuses of this galaxy. “I’ve already placed a restriction on the token of the Ghost Mansion. If anything happens to my soul, it will immediately self-destruct!”

“Take out the token. He won’t enter the Mystic Realm.”

The evil exterminator said indifferently as if he was unwilling to cause more trouble at this juncture.

An invisible force pushed Qin Yu back into the crowd. Despite using his greatest strength, he could not resist this terrifying force.

“What? Are you going to attack me?”

The evil exterminator stared at Qin Yu and said indifferently.

“You’re just living a little longer than me. No big deal! “Qin Yu said coldly.

He could understand the evil exterminator’s actions. After all, the opening of the Ghost Mansion Mystic Realm this time was indeed an earth-shattering event.

It was impossible to predict what would happen in the Mystic Realm.

However, Qin Yu was tremendously displeased with his indifferent behavior.

“Haha, young man, cultivators don’t care about fairness. The Path of Heaven is ruthless. There’s no use for so many ‘what ifs’.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Hahaha, trash, how is it? Attack if you have the ability. Why are you so cowardly now?”

Zong Yue laughed as he called out.

Gu Ming sneered and took out the Netherworld Token. The aura on the token enveloped the ten people who were going to enter the Mystic Realm.

The massive internal qi of the netherworld suddenly turned into an enormous cloud pillar that lifted a few of them. It then soared into the sky and entered a formation in the air.

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly, forcefully controlling the urge to attack.

“My friend, I’m making a deal with you, but you’re not interested.”

A soft voice suddenly sounded and stunned Qin Yu.

“The man with the mustache! As expected, you d*mned fellow is here!”

Qin Yu was ecstatic.

“You’re indeed the d*mned fellow, ill-mannered young man. I have a way to enter this Mystic Realm, but I need the ghostly energy that you previously cultivated the cultivation technique.”

The voice of the man with the mustache sounded.

“F*ck, where did you hide? How come I didn’t manage to find you for so long?” Qin Yu’s current divine sense was terrifying after experiencing the baptism of the path of reincarnation. However, he still could not find the man with the mustache.

“What do you think I left so early? Of course, I had to set up the formation in advance. Otherwise, I couldn’t survive if this evil spirit targeted me.”

The man with the mustache said somewhat smugly.

“Awesome, absolutely awesome! Truly impressive. Hurry up and take me into this Mystic Realm.”

Qin Yu quickly praised him.

“Qin Yu, are you sure you want to go? I’m still hesitating because my deductions show that this Mystic Realm differs from the others I’ve seen before. Just deducing the method to enter it alone has taken up a lot of effort. And when it comes to deducing fortune and misfortune, it almost burned a significant amount of my Life Aura in an instant.”

The man with the mustache sounded somewhat solemn.

“Entering the Ghost Mansion is most likely not a good thing. If I don’t enter, I’m confident I can use the formation to hide until this Mystic Realm disappears.”

Qin Yu fell silent instantly. The man with the mustache’s deduction should be more reliable. He only had one life. There would be no future if he lost his life.

“I’ve decided not to enter. If you want to enter, I can provide you with the method. However, you need to give me half the gains from inside.”

The man with the mustache said softly.

“Man with the mustache, I want to enter!”

Qin Yu raised his head and said coldly.

He had cultivated the Soul Torment Mind Technique. Although he had temporarily suppressed the other personality, it was ultimately a hidden danger that remained unsolved.

Moreover, the Soul Torment Mind Technique was a technique that the masked woman left behind, and the masked woman was a tremendously mysterious existence in the underworld.
