Chapter 2409 Mo Keyi

These three persons were merely Supreme Elders of Tribulation First Level in Rules of Heaven and Earth.

With Qin Yu’s current physical body and Sumeru ring’s world power, the power that erupted had already reached the Soul Statue.

When he threw out this punch, everyone present fell into a deathly silence.

Although they had heard of Qin Yu’s battle achievements, the feeling of seeing it for themselves was different.

However, Qin Yu did not relax in the slightest. With the man with the mustache’s ability to dodge easily, he would not have run so fast if only these three people were here.

“Qin Yu, I’ll give you one more chance. Hurry up and leave. If you don’t leave now, you’ll come with your friends to feed this evil eye.”

Ji Ao opened another bottle with his back facing Qin Yu.

A baby’s soul let out a shrill cry. It then entered the ghostly sword.

That was the last baby of the Prince of Great Xia, the prince’s descendant.

The cultivators of the Yao family on Peach Blossom Island said the prince’s descendant had been sent to the Ni family, but it seemed that the Ji family had seized him to feed the ghostly sword.

“Qin Yu, do as told.”

Saintess Gu, in the distance, shook her head gently.

“F*ck you!”

Chang Mang was furious. His body was like a cannonball as he charged toward Ji Ao.

Jue Wu’s body seemed to be burning with flames. Traces of red light that people could not look straight at them emitted from the pores on her skin.

A terrifyingly high temperature erupted from his body, and in an instant, it seemed to drive away most of the gloomy cold air.

“Watch out!”

Qin Yu suddenly shouted to stop Chang Mang and Jue Wu. Ji Yuyi moved, hopping and skipping.

His divine sense had been tense. Ji Ao was preparing to collect the ghostly sword evil eye, so he only found three persons.

They were the man with the mustache, Saintess Gu, and Ji Yuyi, Ji Ao’s sister.

Although this little girl was at the Peak of True Saint, Ji Ao must have his reasons for being so calm.

Hehe!

Both her legs hopped and skipped with her two pigtails on her face bobbing along.

However, her legs were very stiff and looked a little strange.

“Mo Keyi, come out and play with me.”

The little girl stared into the darkness, and a puppet girl dressed in red like her jumped out. The doll had long hair, but there was a crack in the middle. Blood kept flowing down as if it was a real person.

The puppet was holding a comb and mirror in both its hands. The mirror looked somewhat similar to the ones hanging on the roof.

Vaguely, Qin Yu seemed to have smelled a tremendously ancient wooden smell as the puppet appeared.

With the appearance of these few things, gusts of cold wind continuously swept through the entire space.

Qin Yu and the others could hear a terrifying howl in their ears. It seemed to be a cry from another space.

“Oh my god, I have goosebumps!”

Jue Wu’s body could not help but tremble. She was fearless and bold, but the scene in front of her was truly eerie.

“Be careful. The Ji family had the most ancient lineage among the ancient aristocratic families. They have always been low-key, rarely appearing in the eyes of cultivators. However, whenever they appear, their intentions are incredibly significant. Moreover, the Ji family’s immortal scriptures seem to have the methods of the ancient sorcerer lineage. The spiritual soul restrictions of the Holy Region are spread by the Ji family.”

Ji Yue, in the Sumeru ring, reminded everyone.

Suddenly, the puppet charged toward Qin Yu and the others.

“Mo Keyi, why aren’t you playing with me anymore? I’m angry!

“I’m angry!

“I’m angry!

“I’m angry!”

When she said the last sentence, it sounded like a lion’s roar smashing into their souls.

Jue Wu and Chang Mang’s faces instantly turned ashen. The roar seemed to have injured them.

Ji Yuyi’s face revealed a distorted expression. In an instant, the adorable girl’s appearance disappeared and was replaced by contorted features that looked like a demon.

A red light slightly bloomed in her eyes, and Qin Yu suddenly felt his body freeze.

His body seemed to have been shackled, and the circulation of his soul and chaotic power was blocked.

“Stinky brat, don’t be arrogant!”

Chang Mang roared in rage as he thrust his palm with boundless energy.

However, the palm energy disappeared in mid-air. The space seemed to be under the influence of the ghostly sword’s evil eye, and all the spiritual energy could not fluctuate.

Vermilion Bird Dance!

In Jue Wu’s sea of consciousness, a hundred or so Vermilion Birds rushed out.

They instantly covered Ji Yuyi and fell like a fairy scattering flowers.

“Hehe, I’m going to poke you.”

“Disgusting Charm!”

Ji Yuyi acted as if she did not see Jue Wu’s attack. She took out a silver needle and fiercely poked into the puppet.

In an instant, Jue Wu’s face instantly turned ashen, and he spat out a large mouthful of black blood.

“Disgusting Charm!”

Ji Yuyi’s pupils again turned to Chang Mang. Despite his holy body, Chang Mang could not stand up in an instant, and his soul was severely injured.

“Soul Shattering Golden Radiance!”

A scorching golden light suddenly slashed at Ji Yuyi. However, before the golden light reached Ji Yuyi, it was cut into countless tiny powers of divine sense. It was almost harmless when it landed on Ji Yuyi’s body.

The second level desolate divine eye.

Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye suddenly opened.

In the golden world, the densely packed red threads before the eyes emitted from the red puppet’s head. The other end of the red threads was connected to Qin Yu, Jue Wu, and Chang Mang.

All the attacks that landed on the puppet would be instantly transmitted to them. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Qin Yu’s divine sense slashed out a sword again, targeting the red threads above his head.

However, these threads were abnormally hard, and he could not break them even with the slash.

“Hehehe!

“Disgusting Charm!”

With another poke, Qin Yu felt her sea of consciousness explode with a boom.

A deep wound instantly appeared in his sea of consciousness. From the hole of the needle, a black thread-like shape-poisonous substance spread out and merged into his sea of consciousness.

Waves after waves of intense dizziness struck his sea of consciousness.

Severe Soul Poison!

Qin Yu bit his tongue hard, and a bright light shot out of his forehead.

The Sout Spirit Bead exploded with energy. The power of the soul compressed to the utmost and surged into the golden figurine.

The Soul Shattering Golden Radiance, tenfold more massive, slashed out again.

Even though it did not cut through those strange red threads, it finally reached in front of Ji Yuyi this time.

“Mo Keyi, Mo Keyi, come quickly. I won’t be angry as long as you come back.”

Mo Keyi, with the head swaying, instantly returned above Ji Yuyi.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He forcefully controlled the golden saber to change its direction, and it brushed past Mo Keyi’s head.

An immense burst of soul energy exploded, and Qin Yu broke out in cold sweat.

If this slash had landed on Mo Keyi, he might not have been able to stand up by now.
