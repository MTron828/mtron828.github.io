2480 Returning to Solitary Cloud City

After Qin Yu pulled everyone into the Sumeru ring, he instantly disappeared into the void.

Almost simultaneously, the place where they were was directly shattered by a destructive power.

At this moment, everyone in Sumeru World was silent.

Qin Yu, the evil exterminator, and Flower Granny had almost reached their limits. Flower Granny, in particular, had aged a lot, and her internal qi was tremendously dispirited.

The power of time that Flower Granny used just now, with the power of her Tribulation Third Level, had directly impacted He Teng, who was at the Tribulation Fifth Level. This terrifying power also suffered an immense backlash. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If it wasn’t for He Teng’s battle with the power of time, Qin Yu’s Soul Ferry might not even have been effective, let alone the success of Lei Xin’s final attack. However, the price of defeating He Teng was too high.

Moreover, from the power unleashed at the end, He Teng should remain intact.

“Let’s leave first.”

The evil exterminator was expressionless. He said softly and left the Sumeru ring with Uncle Ling and Ling Yurou. No one knew what they were planning to do.

“Sigh, there are still about 400 million humans left. I wonder what kind of fate they will suffer.”

Lei Xin sighed, and everyone fell silent.

Over there, there were three great Godly Kings and a large number of monster race armies. The fate of the remaining humans could be guessed without saying anything.

“Don’t dwell on it. Strive for the cause and let nature take its course. It’s all destined. Senior Brother Wan Li and Senior Brother Wan Kong have done their best and died. I have to return to the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect as soon as possible. We will meet again soon.”

Wan Ming put his palms together and bowed deeply to the three before leaving the Sumeru ring.

“The Ten Thousand Buddha Sect will probably trigger a huge commotion this time. Chen Zhisha made a deal with the monster race, and to a certain extent, he has converted to the monster race’s Path of Heaven. Wan Li and Wan Kong also died in this battle. I wonder what the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect plans to do next.”

Lei Xin shook his head. The Ten Thousand Buddha Sect of four sects, four schools, and two saints was one of the leading sects under the sacred sect. However, after this battle, its foundation would be greatly weakened.

He turned to look at Flower Granny worriedly.

“It’s fine. The Way of Time has already surpassed the limits of the human soul. It’s normal that there’s a price to pay for using it.”

Flower Granny forced a smile, telling the two not to worry.

“Flower Granny, if you absorb the spiritual essence of life, can you make up for the lost life force?”

Qin Yu took out a piece of the spiritual essence of life. It was an item he had obtained from the ancestor of Ji Yue.

“The power of rules of time is as powerful as the dark power but it comes with a price. This power requires one to sacrifice one’s lifespan or face death in advance in exchange for the power of rules of time, and this price is irreversible.”

Flower Granny smiled bitterly. She would not have used this power if it wasn’t for the fact that she was in tremendous danger.

She smiled and said when she saw the sad expression on Qin Yu’s face.

“Don’t overthink, brat. The life force of a tribulation cultivator is so ethereal. I’m afraid I’ll not be gone yet after this Path of Heaven year ends. Don’t look like you’re sending me off for burial.”

After chatting and laughing, Qin Yu’s depressed mood finally improved quite a bit.

“I wonder how Ruoxue is doing in Solitary Cloud City now. It has been quite some time since we entered the seal from the Solitary Shadow Continent, but we haven’t received any news about Ruoxue. I wonder if something has happened.”

Qin Yu frowned, feeling somewhat worried deep down.

“Don’t worry. With Ruoxue’s current strength, even a Tribulation Fifth Level would find it hard to stop her if she wanted to leave. As for us, we have to adjust our conditions to our best as soon as possible. I’m afraid the following days won’t be peaceful.” Flower Granny shook her head, telling Qin Yu not to worry.

How could someone who could trigger the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation be so easy to deal with?

Qin Yu nodded. Now that He Teng had become the Fallen Godly King of the monster race, and there was a Tribulation Fourth Level eight-winged monster race, they would probably be unstoppable if they attacked the human race.

“Dean, do you think He Teng’s strength has exceeded the Tribulation Fifth Level? Three of us couldn’t even kill him.”

Qin Yu asked curiously, especially the last strike. Lei Xin had shattered his head, but it still could not kill him in the end. Qin Yu felt it very strange. Could this be the remarkable ability of the Tribulation Sixth Level?

“No, the power of the origin of the Tribulation Fifth Level is divided distinctively into upper and lower levels. Even King Qin Guang, whom you mentioned before, is also in the fifth level. It’s just that the degree of the use and understanding of the power of the origin are different. For example, some special Path of Heaven like Flower Granny Flower’s Way of Time and Senior Wu Ji’s Way of Destruction, may sometimes be able to fight against those at a higher level. However, when one reaches the Tribulation Sixth Level, one has completely grasped the origin and fused with the Path of Heaven, which is the power of another cultivation realm. Even the monster race’s Path of Heaven can’t create such a power.”

Lei Xin had once seen the power of the integration of the Path of Heaven of the sixth level during the battle, so he had some understanding of this power.

Qin Yu was somewhat enlightened. So far, he had rarely seen anyone with such power.

The only people who could break through this barrier were Jun Yixian, the masked woman, and Immortal Crane, the three people. He could not think of anyone else besides them who could break through this barrier.

“Let’s go back to Lonely Cloud City and check Ruoxue’s situation. We need to utilize this time to adjust to our best condition.”

Flower Granny’s expression was solemn. Although she believed in Yan Ruoxue’s strength, she still had to consider various situations.

Qin Yu nodded. He sat cross-legged on the ground and slowly healed the injuries on his body.

Boundless and endless spiritual energy entered his body, gradually nourishing his dried-up body.

At his level, every cell in his body could absorb a vast amount of energy, and he did not need to eat these pills anymore.

After meditating, his soul power recovered at a tremendous speed.

He cast his gaze on Evil Eye. At this moment, the sword body of Evil Eye had lost much of its sharpness and looked like an ordinary magical artifact.

The second move just now, Soul Ferry, had already burned all the souls he had absorbed previously. If he wanted to unleash such an extreme sword attack again, he would probably have to spend a vast amount of time collecting souls.

Qin Yu sighed.

If he could unleash several such extreme sword attacks again, he would hope to have a chance to spy on the location of the Way of Destruction. Just now, he seemed to have vaguely located that place, but when the power of his soul was burned out, he finally lost its specific location.

He was having a headache now. He felt he was at a bottleneck, and it was very difficult to break through.

After going to the ghost realm and encountering the monster race continuously, he faced the true experts.

His utmost strength now could only allow him to unleash the power of the origin at the middle stage of the Tribulation Fifth Level.
