1966 The Legend of Xiao Yu

“Can I come in to talk?” the prince asked with a smile after that.

“Oh, of course.” Qin Yu came to his senses and quickly invited the prince in.

The two sat in the courtyard, and the prince couldn’t help but sigh and say, “Brother Qin’s battle really shocked me. I didn’t expect you to win.”

“So what if I had won?” Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said. “The Si family has found an excuse to attack me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have run back to Sky City.”

Then Qin Yu asked tentatively, “Your Highness, if I may ask, will the Si family really not make a move in the city?”

The Prince of Great Xia was silent for a long time. He then looked up at Qin Yu and said, “This is also one of the reasons I came to look for you.”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to say a thing. He could only wait quietly for the Prince of Great Xia to continue.

“Within Sky City, no one is allowed to make a move. What everyone is afraid of is not Great Xia, but the nine great aristocratic families,” the Prince of Great Xia said in a deep voice.

“It’s the rule set by the nine great aristocratic families. But if they want to overthrow it or ignore it directly, we can’t do anything about it.”

Qin Yu gasped and said, “It seems that Sky City is not completely safe.”

“That’s right.” The prince nodded his head. “Of course, other than the nine great aristocratic families, no one else would dare to make a move in Sky City as that would be equivalent to looking down on the nine great aristocratic families.”

“But what about the ones who made the rules?” the prince asked.

Qin Yu fell silent. He sighed and said, “In that case, I can only hand over the ores in my hands.”

“That’s right. That’s what I was thinking too,” the prince sighed and said.

Having said that, Qin Yu still had some doubts in his mind. After all, he had heard in the past that the nine great aristocratic families were also afraid of the Great Xia’s ability to fight to the death. As such, they would not push them too hard. They were more willing to give orders to the world in the emperor’s name.

The reason for the prince to say all these was perhaps he wanted to clear himself of all responsibility and avoid getting involved. This was understandable.

“I think the Si family will definitely come to Sky City. When that time comes, I’m willing to set up something and help you guys make peace,” the prince said.

“Thank you very much, Your Highness,” Qin Yu bowed and said. “Speaking of which, I really don’t dare to push the Si family too hard.”

Chang Mang was still in their hands, so he had to find a way to save him.

What Qin Yu bet on now was the Si family would not lower their status. However, if they really didn’t care about the reputation of the so-called great aristocratic families, there was nothing Qin Yu could do.

At this moment, Jue Wu, who had gone to buy pills, finally returned.

She stuffed the pills in her hand to Qin Yu and said, “I got it all back.”

“You didn’t fight with anyone on the way, did you?” Qin Yu asked with a smile.

“Very close! It was very close!” Jue Wu said angrily.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “Alright. There’s no need to bother with them.”

“Mr. Qin, What is this?” the prince asked.

“I was injured in the battle with Si Shifeng, so I need pills to recuperate,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“How about this? I’ll get you an alchemist tomorrow and ask him to treat you,” the prince muttered.

“Really? Then I’ll have to thank you, Your Highness.” Qin Yu bowed repeatedly.

“Mr. Qin, you’re welcome,” the prince said with a smile.

Then the prince changed the subject and continued, “There’s something I don’t know if I should say.”

“Your Highness, please speak up,” Qin Yu said.

“Compared to the Si family, I think the vision behind you during the battle is even more dangerous,” the prince said in a deep voice.

“The vision?” Qin Yu was stunned, and his expression changed slightly.

The prince was naturally referring to Xiao Yu.

“You know her background?” Qin Yu asked tentatively. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I’ve heard quite a lot of rumors, and they were also recorded in the history of Great Xia,” the Prince of Great Xia said.

He slowly got up and said with his hands behind his back, “This person is tremendously dangerous. There are rumors that she will only appear during the Golden Age. Whenever she appears, she will cause a catastrophe, especially among the young talents of the world. She has killed numerous people.

“There are rumors in the history books of Great Xia that she might have come from the other worlds,” the Prince turned around and said while staring at Qin Yu.

“The other worlds?” Qin Yu was stunned and asked hurriedly, “What do you mean by that?”

The prince did not say anything but just pointed to the ground.

“Hell?” Qin Yu was stunned.

The prince laughed and said, “No one knows whether hell exists or not. However, there is indeed a rumor that she had stolen the fruits of cultivation, and thus she killed many outstanding talents.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and did not quite understand what he meant.

“As you know, whenever Golden Age descends, it is bound to have the birth of a large number of geniuses. These people will eventually reach the peak of cultivation.

“However, the higher one goes, the lesser resources there are and the greater the demand. Therefore, these people will inevitably compete with each other. Only a few can survive to vindicate dao.

“The masked woman has become one of the geniuses in the Golden Age after repeated reincarnation. It means she has to participate in this competition.”

Qin Yu seemed to have understood something.

“You mean to say… She killed all the geniuses in the same generation in the name of competing with others?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“This is where she’s brilliant at,” the Prince of Great Xia nodded.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Could it be a misunderstanding? For example, she was just too powerful, and no one in her generation could defeat her, thus leading to the world’s illusion. Or is it because she was so powerful that she made people feel helpless and could only comfort themselves with this?”

The prince was stunned for a moment, then burst out laughing.

“This is the first time I’ve heard of this!” The prince couldn’t stop laughing, but his weak body soon made him cough violently.

Qin Yu didn’t dare say anything, so he just waited quietly.

There were many legends about Xiao Yu, but they all seemed to be negative.

Perhaps it was because of Qin Yu and Xiao Yu’s relationship that he was unwilling to believe it.

“Do you know about the Immortal Slaying Sect?” the prince suddenly asked.

“Yes, I do. It’s well-known,” Qin Yu got up immediately and said.

“Then, do you know about the glorious Great Xia in the past?” the Prince continued.

“I’m sorry. I really don’t know…” Qin Yu said with embarrassment.

“Back when Great Xia was still in its prime, this land was not called the Holy Region, but the single word ‘Xia’!” the Prince said with a hint of fascination. “The entire Holy Region was named after Xia! We had ruled for tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of years!”

As the prince spoke, he became incredibly heroic, and his voice was loud and resonant.
