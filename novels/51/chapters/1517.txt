“I’m afraid the strength of the sect master of the Tianyun sect is more powerful than I imagined,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Zhuo Jing nodded slightly and said, “We haven’t experienced the era of the expansion of the Tianyun sect, so we don’t have an accurate understanding of the strength of the sect master of the Tianyun sect.”

At this point, Zhuo Jing looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “That’s why we admire you for daring to offend the Tianyun sect.”

At this moment, Qin Yu recalled what the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect had said before.

He said that if he wanted to kill Qin Yu, Qin Yu would be long gone.

At that time, Qin Yu didn’t believe it, but now he believed it.

At that time, Qin Yu probably couldn’t even last a round in his hands.

“Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Brother Qin, what are your plans next?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu pulled Zhuo Jing to the side and said, “I came here this time because I have something to ask of you.”

“You want to borrow the Silver Spring?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu repeatedly waved his hand and said, “It’s not the time yet. I came here this time because I want you to protect me.”

“You’re going to break through?”Zhuo Jing said in surprise.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and said, “Although the Tianyun sect is currently unable to split themselves and can not make a move against me, there’s still the northern lands in the dark.”

......

“Therefore, I have to find a safe place and a reliable person.”

Zhuo Jing was silent for a moment before saying, “Brother Qin, why don’t you go to the divine capital? That should be the safest place.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “To tell you the truth, I have indeed considered the divine capital, but I am no longer the only person in the divine capital.”

“There are many people and many eyes there. Who can guarantee that they won’t inform the Northern Lands?”

Zhuo Jing nodded slightly and said, “That’s true.”

Although Qin Yu had given them a place to stay, in reality, there was not much affection between them.

“Brother Qin, I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for me for a few days. I’ll go and find a safe place for you,”said Zhuo Jing.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Thank you, Brother Zhuo. Also, I’ll have to trouble you to hurry up.”

“Of course.”Zhuo Jing nodded.

Not far away, Li Yingying was secretly listening to their conversation. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qin Yu didn’t notice that Li Yingying had used a secret technique to hear their conversation clearly.

Then, the two returned to the pavilion.

“Everyone, please excuse me for a moment. I’m going out to do something. Please make yourselves at home,”said Zhuo Jing.

It seemed that everyone often met in the Zhuo family, so even if Zhuo Jing wanted to go out, they had no intention of leaving.

They seemed to be able to use all the items in the entire Zhuo family at will.

This was simply a model of justice and wealth.

“Brother Qin, I won’t waste any more time. I’ll go do it now,”said Zhuo Jing.

Qin Yu slightly bowed to express his gratitude.

After he left, Qin Yu sat in the pavilion and chatted with everyone.

It was not until midnight that everyone slowly dispersed.

Just as Qin Yu was about to go back to his room to sleep, Li Yingying suddenly called out to Qin Yu.

She quickly walked up and said with a smile, “Young Master Qin, I suddenly had an urgent matter last time and left without saying goodbye. I’m really sorry.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Miss Li, you don’t have to apologize to me. No matter what reason you leave, I don’t care.”

Li Yingying couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed, but she still said shamelessly, “Young Master Qin, in fact, I’m full of admiration for you. If...”

“Miss Li, I also told you clearly that I’m not interested in you at all,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“I’ve already made myself clear last time. Don’t waste your time on me.”

Li Yingying hurriedly said, “Is it because I suddenly left without saying goodbye last time? I really...”

“You’re thinking too much.”Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No matter what you do, I’m not interested in you.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Li Yingying looked at Qin Yu’s back and couldn’t help but clench her teeth.

“Qin Yu, you’re so Shameless! If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being impolite!”Li Yingying’s eyes flashed with a trace of viciousness.

...

At this moment, the Battle of the Heavenly Cloud sect still didn’t stop.

The two sides had been fighting for several days, but Yongji still couldn’t improve even half a step.

Every time he felt like he was about to take down the heavenly cloud sect, other hidden forces would appear within the sect.

“They’ve been fighting for six days, but there’s still no result. If this drags on, it’ll be extremely disadvantageous for Yong Ji,”someone in the dark commented.

“Mm, the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s forces are rushing back, and the sect has countless guest elders. If they all rush back, Yong Ji will definitely lose!”

“Normally, Yongji should understand this logic, but why is he still not retreating?”

“There’s only one possibility. Yongji is also waiting for outside help. who could that person be? Qin Yu?”

“A mere Qin Yu probably won’t change anything. Just wait and see.”

The battle continued. Yongji relied on heaven-defying methods to kill countless enemies, but he was also injured, and more than half of his adopted sons died.

“Foster father, if this drags on, I’m afraid we’ll lose,”one of his adopted sons said anxiously.

Yong Ji remained silent, but deep down, he was extremely furious.

The northern lands had said that they would take the opportunity to attack, but the battle had already gone on for five days, and there was still no sign of them!

“Foster father, why don’t we retreat for the time being and regroup before we fight!”One of his adopted sons suggested.

Yong Ji remained silent. He looked at the ruins of the scene and also had the intention to retreat.

However, he was very clear about this principle.

Once the first attack failed, it would become even more difficult later on.

“Foster father, our people are already exhausted, and we don’t know what kind of mysterious spell the Heavenly Cloud sect has. Every one of them is extremely abundant. If this continues, we will really die here!”A foster son said anxiously.

At this point, Yong Ji had no other choice.

He took a deep breath and then shouted, “Heavenly Cloud sect, listen well. Today, I will temporarily spare your lives. One day, I will definitely make a comeback!”

After throwing these words, Yong Ji waved his hand and said coldly, “Retreat!”

The group of people left the Heavenly Cloud sect and temporarily set up camp in a city a hundred stars away.

Looking at the departing Yongji, everyone couldn’t help but sigh.

“As expected, the Heavenly Cloud sect is a tough nut to crack. It’s really difficult to deal with just Yongji alone.”

“Yeah, unless the three lunatics and three absolute arts attack together, it will be very difficult to bite down on this tough nut.”

“Yongji will never give up. This is the only chance for him. If he doesn’t take the opportunity to get rid of the Heavenly Cloud sect, once the Heavenly Cloud sect recovers, he will definitely destroy Yongji City!”

The crowd of onlookers in the dark did not leave. They knew that it would not be long before Yong Ji would make a comeback.

More importantly, they were also waiting. They also wanted to see if the northern lands would take advantage of this.
