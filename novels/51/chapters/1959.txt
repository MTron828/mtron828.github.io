Seeing He Teng, Gu Xinghe was stunned for a moment before he laughed heartily and said, “He Teng, you’re still alive?”

“With your blessings, I’m fortunate to be still alive…” He Teng said coldly.

Gu Xinghe smiled faintly and said, “Alright, we’ve captured Qin Yu today. Don’t you have a grudge against him? I’ll kill him for you today!”

“Mr. Gu, can you give Qin Yu to be?” He Teng said with his eyes narrowed.

!!

Gu Xinghe shook his head, smiled faintly, and said, “I’m afraid not. As you can see, I’m not the one leading this today.

“Moreover, what difference does it make who kills him?”

He Teng narrowed his eyes slightly and said with a smile, “Mr. Gu, Qin Yu can’t die yet…”

“Oh, why?” Gu Xinghe raised his eyebrows.

He Teng said slowly, ” He can only die in my hands… Moreover, in an open and aboveboard manner…”

Gu Xinghe was surprised to hear this. “That shouldn’t be, it doesn’t look like you! I remember a few years ago, you wanted to tear Qin Yu into pieces claiming he was your inner demon. Why is that so now…”

“Now that I’ve defeated my inner demon, I’ve turned it into a dao technique for cultivation… If he dies, my dao mid will be destroyed…” He Teng said in a low voice.

“Therefore, Mr. Gu, please give me some face and let me take him away…”

Gu Xinghe sneered and said, “That’s impossible. He’ll surely die today. No one can save him!”

He Teng revealed a weird smile and said, “Then I’m sorry. I must take him away today…”

“What? Are you going to go against me for Qin Yu?” Gu Xinghe’s expression turned cold.

He Teng shook his head and said, “No, I’m doing this for my dao mind… For the sake of my dao mind, I don’t hesitate to go against anyone…”

“Hahaha!” Hearing this, Gu Xinghe burst out laughing.

He looked at He Teng coldly and said, “Just you? A piece of trash who used to be my attendant? Are you entitled to negotiate with me?”

“That’s right, just me…” He Teng grinned and said.

“Don’t talk nonsense with him. Hurry up and kill them both!” Gu Xinghe was furious.

Without further delay, the Semi-Saints walked forward.

“Mr. Gu, we still have a long to go. I believe we will meet again soon…” He Teng grabbed Qin Yu’s shoulder, and the two disappeared into the void.

“D*mn it!”

The Semi-Saints’ expressions changed drastically. They instantly activated their techniques to seal off the surrounding space!

However, He Teng’s spatial spell seemed to have advanced again. He broke through the restraints directly and escaped with Qin Yu!

“Where’s he? Where’s he?” Seeing this, Gu Xinghe panicked.

“He’s escaped. This person’s attainment in the spatial spell is incredibly high,” a Semi-Saint frowned and said.

Gu Xinghe was flustered and exasperated, “Then hurry up and chase! Why are you still standing still there?”

The Semi-Saints turned around, looked at Gu Xinghe coldly, and directed their killing intent at him.

Gu Xinghe’s expression changed slightly. His tone mellowed down a little as he said, “Seniors, please capture him. We must not let him escape!”

“We don’t need you to talk nonsense.” A Semi-Saint snorted coldly and shot over, following Qin Yu’s internal qi.

Everyone on the city wall looked at each other in shock.

They were shocked by He Teng, an uninvited guest.

“Who is that person? He seems to be quite familiar with Gu Xinghe.”

“Yeah, what’s the background of Qin Yu?”

At the same time, He Teng, bringing Qin Yu along, had fled several hundred star miles away, but he did not show any signs of stopping.

Only then did Qin Yu realize He Teng’s attainments in spatial spells had already reached an incredibly high level. Although he couldn’t compare to the man with the mustache, it was extremely exaggerated.

He Teng didn’t know how long he had been running before he stopped.

He threw Qin Yu on the ground and laughed coldly.

“Qin Yu, you can’t die…” He Teng said gloomily.

Qin Yu got up from the ground, patted the dirt off his body, and said, “You’ve saved me again.”

“I didn’t save you,” He Teng said coldly. “If it weren’t for cultivation, I would have cut you into a thousand pieces!”

Even so, He Teng had indeed saved his life. Thus Qin Yu did not say much.

“Don’t worry. I will fight with you soon. I will let you die in my hands…” He Teng said coldly.

“Before that, you have to live well…”

“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you’re convinced of your loss,” Qin Yu sneered and said. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Hehe…” He Teng narrowed his eyes. His body began to dissipate slowly and then merge into the void.

In the blink of an eye, He Teng had disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu looked around, and a sense of fatigue suddenly hit him.

It was an extremely remote area, and Qin Yu had no idea where he was.

He used his divine sense to cover the surroundings and found no sign of life.

“This place is rather safe…” Qin Yu murmured.

Soon, a sense of fatigue hit him, and he felt dizzy. Immediately after, he collapsed.

On the other end.

...

The Semi-Saints searched around everywhere in the surroundings but couldn’t find Qin Yu.

In the palace of Sky City.

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth, stomping his feet in anger, and his eyes were full of ferocity.

“He Teng, this b*stard, he’s simply unreasonable!” GuXxinghe said through his gritted teeth.

“If I find you, I’ll definitely tear you to pieces!”

One of the Semi-Saints glanced at Gu Xinghe and snorted. “You two probably came from the same place, but the difference in cultivation is so great.”

“That’s right. I really don’t know what the higher-ups are thinking. They actually allowed trash like you to stay.”

Gu Xinghe opened his mouth. Although he was angry, he did not dare to flare up and could only suppress his anger.

“We’d better report this matter to Holy Son,” one of the Semi-Saints said.

“The Holy Son has already gone into seclusion. It’s better to tell the elder,” another Semi-Saint said.

The Semi-Saints didn’t stay any longer and quickly left.

...

They had also brought Si Shifeng back to the Si family.

After this battle, he probably would have to rest and recuperate for a long time.

After the battle, the news quickly spread.

Almost the entire Zhongzhou had heard of this matter. Qin Yu had defeated Si Shifeng with absolute battle prowess!

Not only that, the Si family even wanted to kill Qin Yu but he was saved by a mysterious person!

“Who is this Qin Yu? He actually managed to defeat Si Shifeng!”

“I heard he and Saintess Yan came from the same place. They’re childhood sweethearts!”

“That’s right. Qin Yu also has a chaotic body and can afford to challenge Si Shiyue!”

“Tsk! Tsk! I didn’t expect the Si family to have done such a shameless thing. It’s simply embarrassing!”
