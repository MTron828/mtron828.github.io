Chapter 2553 The Truth

2553 The Truth

Shen Qian said with a bitter smile. Even she, a member of the Divine Will Sect, was so respectful to Xuan Tian, let alone the other members of the sect.

“Qin Yu, the sect master invites you to go over.”

A person arrived riding a magic sword in the air, slightly bowing toward Qin Yu.

This person exuded a dense aura of the Way of the Sword, and the energy of a powerful sword intent circulated in his body. When he landed, even Qin Yu could feel the sharpness in his aura despite his current state.

One could imagine that the person’s cultivation realm was not low either.

Senior Brother Xuan Chen, didn’t Sect Master Chen Shuang ask us to go along?”

Shen Qian asked doubtfully.

After they recovered, they thought that the sect master of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect would at least ask about the details, but there was no news. The sect master seemed to have been waiting for Qin Yu to wake up.

“No, he didn’t.”

Xuan Chen shook his head.

“The sect master of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect? It seems that whether it’s a blessing or a curse depends on the sect master’s attitude.”

Qin Yu shook his head and stepped on the magic sword.

He grabbed Senior Brother Xuan Chen’s waist with one hand. Xuan Chen’s body shook, and a terrifying internal qi burst out from the palm in his sleeve.

“What are you doing?”

“I can’t fly now.”

Qin Yu said innocently. His condition was so bad now that he could not fly in the void.

“Alright, can you not put your arm around my waist? I’m a little scared.”

“I’ll grab your shoulders then.”

The current Qin Yu was no different from an ordinary person. He really feared that he would fall to his death.

Soon, Xuan Chen brought Qin Yu to a great hall.

The legends on Earth seemed to be the same as here. The three Daoist deities, the Primeval Lord of Heaven, the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure, and the Supreme Venerable Sovereign also corresponded.

“Xuan Chen, you may leave now.”

“Yes.”

The Daoist priest slowly turned around. It was a very ordinary- looking elderly man.

He wore a loose Daoist robe and a headscarf or Daoist crown on his head. His eyes were bright and full of vigor, revealing an extraordinary temperament.

“You resemble, closely resemble…

He stared at Qin Yu for a long time without moving as if he was looking at an old friend.

It was only until Qin Yu’s hair stood on end that he shifted his gaze away.

“Zi Yang seems to have left you something…”

Qin Yu shook his head, and Chen Shuang waved his hand to stop him.

“Actually, I can roughly guess what it is. He has a reason for leaving what he saw to a cultivator outside of the Three Purities Sect. Do you know what Dao is?”

Chen Shuang said with a smile as if he was telling a story to Qin Yu. Qin Yu shook his head slightly.

“The ultimate manifestation of Dao is governing by doing nothing, that is, following nature, not forcing, aligning with the Path of Heaven; that is Dao.

“If taken a step further, the ultimate manifestation of Dao manifests as natural harmony, the unity with the Dao of the universe. Practitioners transcend the limitations and self of the individual, merging with the Dao of the universe; the practitioners become the embodiment of the Dao themselves.”

“At this stage, you’re basically in the Saint Realm,” said Chen Shuang with a smile.

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat bitter. He knew Chen Shuang had already guessed something.

“Our Three Purities Sect was established in troubled times. Even though it eventually collapsed and split into three sects, we still took it upon ourselves to protect the human race. We hide in prosperity and emerge in troubled times. This has always been the purpose of our three sects. We pacify the alien races and protect the path of the human race.

Although there would be many selfish phenomena, it was the same for the great cause. In every war with the alien races, the sects that suffer the most casualties are almost always the three sects.”

Qin Yu nodded. He had heard of this history before.

“Zi Yang experienced two battles against the alien races. Zi Yang could be said to have made great contributions when the human race was at its peak. Countless alien races died in his hands. He once single-handedly stopped the three Saints of the demon race and protected a purgatory from being plunged into misery. He once fought against a demon god at the Tribulation Seventh Level who had condensed a divinity and almost died.

“He, Zi Yang, entered the Three Purities Sect as an ordinary person. He swore an oath to protect the human race and cultivated Dao. The toughness of his dao mind is comparable to that of the barrier of heaven and earth.”

Chen Shuang raised his head, tears slightly welling up in his eyes.

“I can understand him dying in battle, but I can’t understand why he fell into the monster race. What did he see? Tell me! I need you to tell me before I can completely believe it.”

A suffocating aura pressed down on Qin Yu, making him almost unable to breathe.

“Are you sure you want me to say it out?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Qin Yu threw his divine sense into the chaotic cloud. Perhaps Zi Yang left this cloud of divine sense to him because he was afraid of causing the collapse of the entire Daoism.

“Say it out… Actually, I can roughly guess it. I have no hope of condensing a divinity in this life, so I’m not afraid of encountering such an unforeseen event again.”

Chen Shuang turned to look at the three ancestors.

“The Dao you cultivate is the Path of Heaven, where things blend and the primal forces generate the universe. The Dao gives birth to unity, unity gives birth to duality, duality gives birth to trinity, and from the trinity arise all things. The Path of Heaven represents your dao mind, and the Three Purities Sect vows to protect the human race amidst chaos.

However, what if the Pah of Heaven demands to demise of the human race?

“Saint Zi Yang saw the will of the Path of Heaven and a series of natural disasters such as changes in heaven and earth, collapse of mountains, storms, floods, and so on. There were also man-made disasters, wars, and the rise of evil forces. The human race died, and the divinity stood. This is the ultimate manifestation of Dao that Saint Zi Yang saw.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly as he spoke. He saw that enormous figure struggling bitterly within the heavenly might.bender

That was the Path of Heaven he pursued, marking the first conflict via the eyes within his soul.

Chen Shuang felt like he was being devoured and stumbled onto the ground.

“Impossible! How was this possible? The Daoists also have seventh- level deities who have condensed divinity. Why didn’t they see this phenomenon?”

“Perhaps it’s a change in the Path of Heaven or something strange about the Misty Forest. Either way, this is what Saint Zi Yang saw.” Qin Yu said bitterly.

The Path of Heaven Daoists cultivated told them that they had to destroy the human race before they could progress to attain godhood.

This was what the human race’s Path of Heaven had told them. The human race’s Path of Heaven was going to destroy the world.

The Daoists’ doa mind was the foundation of their cultivation. The toughness of their dao minds represented the limits of their cultivation.
