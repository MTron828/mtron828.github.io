2122 Xuan Jizi in Despair

On the ground, Xuan Jizi swallowed a mouthful of blood in pain. Although his body had suffered a great impact, his internal qi was still vigorous.

Obviously, the attack just now did not cause any severe damage to him.

But even so, Xuan Jizi was terrified!

The simple collision between the two had already shown Si Liuhe’s terrifying strength!

Si Liuhe was so powerful now. Even though he burned his blood essence to recover to his peak, he was still no match for Si Liuhe!

“Si Liuhe, is there no room for discussion?” Xuan Jizi gritted his teeth and said.

Si Liuhe did not stop his actions. His elemental beads began to shine even brighter, and he seemed taller than before.

He slowly raised his right hand, and the elemental pearl in his palm flickering with a cold light floated in the air. The surrounding air seemed to begin to tremble under the pressure of this powerful elemental energy.

He glanced at Xuan Jizi deeply and said indifferently, “Why did you talk nonsense?”

“Alright, alright! I’ll fight you with all my might then!” Xuan Jizi raised his head and shouted.

Hearing Xuan Jizi’s provocation, Si Liuhe only sneered, not taking him seriously at all.

Xuan Jizi’s expression was solemn as he took out a jade pendant from his chest. It was his treasure, the Starry River Jade Pendant. The jade pendant spun slightly in his hand, and starlight flickered as if an endless galaxy was flowing within it.

The surrounding scenery seemed to have begun to change at this moment. An enormous whirlpool suddenly appeared in the originally calm sky. The whirlpool was full of stars as if it was another universe.

With determination in both eyes, Xuan Jizi threw the jade pendant at Si Liuhe with all his might. The jade pendant emitted a dazzling light in the air.

At the same time, he was chanting something. His voice was loud and clear, echoing in the air. It was an ancient and complicated language as if it had a mysterious power. Every word was waving the way and triggering the internal qi of the world.

“The starry river is my witness, with spirit stones as the medium! The universe changes, and the star deity descends!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Starry River Jade Pendant instantly exploded, turning into an enormous galaxy. Stars spun within it like a real starry sky.

The surrounding scenery was even more shocking at this moment. The galaxy spun and the starlight was dazzling. The entire world was as if pulled into this starry sky. The originally clear sky turned gray at this moment. Only the dazzling starlight illuminated the earth.

Si Liuhe’s expression changed slightly. The powerful elemental energy pressure seemed to be off-set instantly. He stared at Xua Jizi with a hint of seriousness.

Xuan Jizi’s technique exceeded his expectations.

The surrounding onlookers were deeply attracted by this shocking scene. Shock and reverence filled their eyes.

“Is… Is this the Star Divine Technique?” an elderly onlooker said in shock. His voice echoed in the surroundings, causing an uproar.

“Xuan Jizi, he… he had actually cultivated such a forbidden technique!” A young fighter’s face turned pale. He looked at the huge galaxy in the sky as if he could see the end of the world.

“Si Liuhe should be worried. This Xuan Jizi’s strength is not to be underestimated,” a middle-aged man said in a deep voice. Worry filled his eyes. It was obvious that he was uncertain about the outcome of this battle.

The people in the surroundings were discussing non-stop. They were all deeply shocked by the strength that Xuan Jizi had displayed. The power of this technique had already exceeded their understanding.

Even Si Liuhe had to reevaluate Xuan Jizi’s strength now.

However, there was no fear in his eyes. There was still a hint of playfulness.

He even dared to challenge the living beings in the Chaos Grave, not to mention Xuan Jizi.

“As expected of a True Saint who has lived so long,” Si Liuhe said indifferently.

“But… ” Si Liuhe continued, his internal qi gradually rising, causing invisible pressure to the surrounding onlookers. “No matter how powerful the technique is, it’s only a support. It’s the strength that decides everything!”

As soon as he finished speaking, an intense light suddenly erupted from the elemental pearl. The light was like a shining sun, shining so brightly that the earth trembled. The surrounding people could not help but close their eyes. Although they wanted to open their eyes to see what was happening, they could not resist the intensity of the light.

The elemental pearl in Si Liuhe’s hand was like a miniature world. Endless elemental energy surged in it, turning into dragon-like elemental energy streams that surrounded him, forming a powerful defensive barrier. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

At this moment, he suddenly stretched out his hand and waved toward the sky. The elemental pearl instantly flew into the sky and turned into a stream of light that shot into the clouds.

In an instant, the surrounding sky seemed to have been torn open, and endless elemental energy gushed out from that hole. The entire world seemed to be boiling at this moment.

At this moment, he slowly raised his hand and extended a finger, gently pointing at Xuan Jizi.

“The elemental energy creates the world, the Great Dao is extremely simple!” he said in a low voice. Although his voice was soft, it clearly entered everyone’s ears.

As soon as he finished speaking, the dragon-like stream of elemental energy in the sky suddenly turned into an immense pillar of elemental energy and rushed toward Xuan Jizi like divine punishment.

The entire world seemed to tremble at this moment. The immense pillar of elemental energy brought along unparalleled pressure as it pressed down on Xuan Jizi.

At this moment, countless people felt suffocated. When they saw this scene, horror and shock filled their eyes.

Although Xuan Jizi was shocked by Si Liuhe’s attack, he did not retreat. He gritted his teeth, and his entire body seemed to have become as hard as iron. The Starry River Jade Pendant spun in front of him, ready to receive the impact of the elemental energy pillar.

Xuan Jizi gripped the jade pendant tightly and suddenly waved it at the elemental energy pillar. In an instant, the Starry River Jade Pendant erupted with boundless starlight. The starry river surged, and the starlight was dazzling. It was like a real starry river that covered the sky and welcomed the elemental energy pillar that was like a divine punishment.

The moment the two powers collided in the air, the world seemed to freeze. An endless burst of light erupted, like a blazing sun bursting open, illuminating the entire sky.

The surrounding ground instantly crumbled under the powerful impact of the elemental energy, and huge cracks appeared. The ground was as if trembling at this moment.

The sound of the collision of elemental energy filled the air like a deafening thunder reverberating in this place. The power was so great that it was enough to cause people’s hearts to tremble.

The clouds in the sky were torn apart by the powerful elemental energy fluctuations, forming an enormous whirlpool that seemed to be about to devour the entire world.

An intense elemental energy storm erupted in this place. Wild winds raged, and dust flew into the air, enveloping the surrounding scenery. The trees swayed in the wind, and the birds and beasts flew away. It was like the end of the world.
