Chapter 1718: The Descent of Xihuang Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Was this the true body of Yuan Xiu? It was so powerful that it made one’s heart palpitate!

Even He Teng could not help trembling at this moment.

Such a terrifying internal qi made him fail to even think of resisting.

Yuan Xiu looked coldly at He Teng, who was kneeling on the ground, and said, “Where is Sima Bei?”

“Lord, he is seriously injured and is currently recuperating,” He Teng said respectfully.

Yuan Xiu did not say anything. Two more clones flew out from between his brows.

One of them guarded his true body while the other had left North Plain. The last one rushed to Sima Bei’s room.

Seeing the half-dead Sima Bei, a trace of mockery appeared on Yuan Xiu’s face.

“Trash,” Yuan Xiu coldly.

Seeing the resurrected Yuan Xiu, Sima Bei was extremely excited.

He tried his best to get up, but he couldn’t.

“Lord, you’re finally resurrected…” Sima Bei said as he suppressed the excitement in his heart.

Yuan Xiu walked up to Sima Bei and said coldly, “If it’s not for the fact that you still have some use, I will kill you right now.”

Sima Bei’s body tensed up and he didn’t dare to say anything.

At this moment, Yuan Xiu raised his palm, and rays of pitch-black light burst out of it.

Three Lives Reincarnation!

It was the secret technique of the Immortal Slaying Sect! He did not expect Yuan Xiu to have also comprehended such a secret technique!

Under the pitch-black light, Sima Bei’s physical body began to recover.

In a short span of ten or so minutes, Sima Bei had recovered to his original state!

“Thank you, Lord!” Sima Bei quickly got up and knelt on the ground.

Yuan Xiu ignored him and walked up to Yong Ji. He used the same method to recover Yong Ji’s physical body.

The two Godly Kings of North Plain could not help but feel terrified when they felt the surging internal qi in Yuan Xiu’s body.

This internal qi was too powerful!

“Lord, Xihuang has also declared war on Nanzhou,” Sima Bei said eagerly.

Yuan Xiu said coldly, “Alright. After I take down Nanzhou, I’ll go to Xihuang.”

Sima Bei was stunned for a moment before he quickly said, “Lord, we should now join forces with Xihuang. Moreover, they are not fertile land. There’s no need to offend them…”

Yuan Xiu sneered and said, “Join forces? Do I need to?”

At this moment, Yuan Xiu was extremely confident in himself.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Yuan Xiu was no longer afraid of anyone in Lizhou.

Without talking any nonsense, Yuan Xiu turned around and left. No one knew where he went, and no one dared to ask him.

After he left, Yong Ji’s expression darkened.

“What a terrifying internal qi,” Yong Ji said after taking a deep breath.

Sima Bei nodded slightly and said, “Compared to Xiao Sheng back then, Lord’s strength is even more terrifying.”

“That’s right. I have never felt such an internal qi even from Xiao Sheng’s body,” Yong Ji said in a deep voice.

At this moment, He Teng walked in from outside.

He Teng could not help feeling surprised when he saw in the room the two of them had fully recovered.

“Is this the Immortal Slaying Sect’s secret technique?” He Teng thought to himself.

“As expected of the Immortal Slaying Sect. How terrifying!”

At this moment, He Teng’s heart was filled with even more greed!

Even though Yuan Xiu was incomparably terrifying, it couldn’t stop He Teng’s thoughts.

“Lord’s internal qi is truly terrifying,” Sima Bei muttered.

Beside him, He Teng sneered and said, “This isn’t his true body. It’s just a clone of him. His true body is still in closed-door cultivation in the snowy mountain.”

“What?”

Hearing this, the two in the room were instantly even more shocked!

Such a terrifying internal qi, but it was not from his true body! How terrifying was this?

“How powerful is Lord…” Yong Ji could not help but swallow his saliva.

Sima Bei shook his head and said, “I have never seen this before.”

…

In Divine Capital City.

Qin Yu’s cultivation soon reached a bottleneck.

Using a few drops of dragon blood, his spiritual energy had reached its peak and no longer could advance further, even half a step.

“D*mn it! I have to go to North Plain again,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He then glanced at Zhuo Jing who was still sitting on the ground in closed-door cultivation. He could not help but feel a little envious.

“Sigh!” Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Compared to them, his cultivation method had a huge drawback. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu did not stay any longer. He immediately left Divine Capital City, planning to head to North Plain.

At this moment, a figure blocked Qin Yu’s way.

This person’s internal qi was not strong. His body emitted an extremely mild internal qi.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He released a wisp of divine sense to probe his strength.

But at this moment, Qin Yu discovered that this person actually did not have the divine sense in his body!

“A clone?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Are you Qin Yu?”

The mysterious person finally spoke.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Who are you?”

“My name is Chao Cang. I’m from Xihuang,” the other party said.

Upon hearing the word “Xihuang”, Qin Yu’s expression immediately turned cold. “Why? Are you looking for me?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Chao Cang said indifferently, “I am under the order of the sect to invite you to Xihuang.”

“I’m not going.” Qin Yu rejected it without even thinking.

Chao Cang said indifferently, “No one can reject my sect master’s order. If you don’t go, you are looking down on my Xihuang Sect.”

Qin Yu could not help but sneer, “You have declared war on Nanzhou. Do you think I’m afraid of offending you?”

Chao Cang’s face darkened and said, “We are targeting Xiao Sheng, not anyone else.

“As long as Xiao Sheng is dead, Xihuang will not take action.”

Qin Yu frowned.

They were here for Xiao Sheng again.

Rightfully speaking, Xihuang and Nanzhou were separated by the dead river. Thus the two sides should not have any interaction.

But now it seemed that was not the case. They seemed to want to get rid of Xiao Sheng.

“I hope you will seriously consider it. I will wait for your answer,” Chao Cang said.

After saying this, Chao Cang turned around and was about to leave.

“There’s no need to think about it. I will not go,” Qin Yu said without hesitation.

Chao Cang instantly stopped in his tracks.

He turned around and looked at Qin Yu coldly. “Then you are the enemy of Xihuang. Why do you want to be on the side of Xiao Sheng?”

“I think you’re insane. I don’t even know you. Why do I have to go when you want me to go?” Qin Yu laughed and said.

“Also, I don’t like your arrogant attitude and your commanding tone.”

Chao Cang nodded slightly and said, “In that case, I won’t say any more nonsense. In a few days, we will set foot in Nanzhou. By that time, I believe that we will meet.”

After saying this, Chao Cang turned around and left.

Qin Yu did not make a move against him because killing a clone was meaningless.

“Looks like I still have to go to Tianyun Sect,” Qin Yu sighed and said.

He did not delay further and rushed straight toTianyun Sect.

On the cultivation mountain of Tianyun Sect.

Qin Yu and Xiao Sheng were sitting on the ground.

“Why do the people of Xihuang want to kill you?” Qin Yu asked directly.
