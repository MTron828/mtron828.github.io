Chapter 1393: Chapter 1393, the legend of the handlebar mustache

Qin Yu approached the great elder step by step. He said coldly, “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill you?”

Boss Zheng was obviously a little frightened. He closed his eyes and said, “I. . . I don’t know.”

Qin Yu was getting closer and closer to boss Zheng. Beads of sweat couldn’t help dripping down his forehead.

“You’re so F * cking honest.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh bitterly.

He sat down beside boss Zheng and his killing intent dissipated.

Boss Zheng was gasping for air as if he had survived a disaster.

“You... aren’t going to kill me?”Boss Zheng asked tentatively.

Qin Yu waved her hand and said, “No, as long as you don’t involve sister Lin in this matter.”

Boss Zheng patted his chest and finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“Leave Gu City early tomorrow.”Qin Yu glanced at boss Zheng, then turned around and went back to her room.

The next morning. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Boss Zheng greeted Qin Yu, then left Gu City in a hurry.

In the next few days, Qin Yu quietly waited for the arrival of three days.

While waiting, he was also slowly comprehending the sixth level of the fighting word formula.

The fighting word formula had a total of ten levels. The first five levels were known as the “Ground level”, while the last five levels were known as the “Heaven Level”.

Therefore, comprehending the sixth level was extremely difficult. It was as if there was a gap between the sixth level and the fifth level.

Even a genius like Jiang he only managed to comprehend the fifth level.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

On the night of the third day, Qin Yu went to the Ghost Market’s Dan Ma building again, as promised.

Inside the Dan Ma building, Brother Dao was already prepared. When he saw Qin Yu, he didn’t waste any time and directly stood up, saying, “Let’s go.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He followed behind Brother Dao and hurried towards their destination.

Qin Yu didn’t know where the water of life was, so he was at a loss on the way.

Brother Dao didn’t borrow a flying exotic beast, so Qin Yu deduced that the destination shouldn’t be too far away.

But soon, Qin Yu realized that he was wrong, and ridiculously wrong!

The two of them walked for five whole days, but there was still no trace of them.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask, “Brother Dao, is it still very far?”

Brother Dao Thought for a moment and said, “According to this pace, we should be able to walk for another eight days.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Then why don’t we use Flying Beasts?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Brother Dao shook his head and said, “Flying Beasts can’t enter that place.”

Qin Yu wanted to say something else, but was interrupted by Brother Dao with a wave of his hand.

“In short, it’s best to be careful,”Brother Dao said coldly.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t say anything more and could only agree.

The two of them walked on the land of the South Province, passing through many strange scenes.

Qin Yu didn’t know these places at all. He just followed behind Brother Dao, walking with an invincible gaze.

“Brother Dao, what do you usually rely on to survive? Robbing tombs?”

One day, while the two of them were resting, Qin Yu asked casually.

Brother Dao glanced at Qin Yu and said, “How do you know?”

Qin Yu grinned and said, “I can roughly guess what your nickname is.”

Brother Dao snorted and threw a pot of wine to Qin Yu. He said, “Then you really guessed wrong. I don’t live by robbing tombs. The reason is very simple, because I don’t have that ability at all.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Is robbing tombs a very difficult thing?”

“Nonsense.”Brother Dao snorted coldly.

“The great tombs in the holy region are worth exploring. They are either mass graves or places where great cultivators are buried. In such a place, a wisp of murderous aura is enough to kill people.”Brother Dao said coldly.

“To survive in such a great tomb, you need a great ability.”

Qin Yu said jokingly, “It seems that Brother Dao has tried.”

Brother Dao pointed at the scar on his face and said, “This scar came because of tomb raiding. I almost died there.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood. No wonder this scar had not been repaired. It probably left a scar that could never be repaired.

At this time, Qin Yu suddenly thought of a person.

He smiled and said, “Brother Dao, since you have a history of tomb raiding, do you know a handlebar mustache?”

“Handlebar mustache? What’s That?”Brother Dao asked, puzzled.

Qin Yu spread his hands and muttered, “It seems that that kid was just bragging.”

“Wait, I do know that there is a big shot in this industry who does have a handlebar mustache.”At this time, Brother Dao suddenly changed the topic.

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up and hurriedly said, “Yes, he has a handlebar mustache, and his temperament is extremely wretched.”

Brother Dao nodded and said, “EN, it fits your image very well. He is a legend in this industry.”

“Legend? Why?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Brother Dao lightly snorted and said, “How many large family’s graves in this world has he not visited before? That sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect’s grave is one of the victims.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Is this kid so fierce?”

“This is nothing. Back then, he was prepared to go to the ancestral graves of the nine great clans. If he hadn’t been discovered, he would have succeeded.”Brother Dao couldn’t help but sigh. A trace of admiration appeared in his eyes.
