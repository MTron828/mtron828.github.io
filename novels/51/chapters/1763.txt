1764 He Teng’s Arrival

Hearing this, Jue Wu raised her hand and knocked Wen Wanchong on the head.

“Shut your doomsday mouth!” Jue Wu scolded.

Wen Wanchong didn’t dare to say anything and quickly moved out of her sight.

Even though Wen Wanchong’s words were not pleasant to the ear, he was telling the truth.

It was not realistic to go to Zhongzhou on foot.

But setting up a teleportation formation was not something they could do.

“Let’s go to the East Continent.” Qu Zhu suddenly said.

“The East Continent more advanced than Nanzhou.”

As Qu Zhu had said, although the East Continent was not as unified as Nanzhou, it was precisely for this reason that the former had more freedom for development, and the level of pharmacists was far above that of Nanzhou.

“Okay, I’ll go to the East Continent now.” Jue Wu quickly decided.

Qu Zhu stopped her and shook his head. “I’ll go. You’re too impulsive. If you get in trouble in the East Continent, it’s not worth it.”

Jue Wu thought about it and thought he was right.

“Qu Zhu is right. You should spend more time on cultivation.” Wen Wanchong said.

Jue Wu nodded. “Alright then. Don’t delay anymore. Go now.”

Qu Zhu smiled in resignation and nodded. “Alright, I’ll leave now.”

...

The entire Nanzhou was talking about the battle.

Although it seemed that Xiao Sheng ended the battle, everyone knew that he didn’t do it alone. It was the result of everyone’s hard work.

“I didn’t expect Senior Xiao Hai to still be alive.”

This is a great fortune for our Nanzhou.”

“That’s right, with Senior Xiao Hai alive, who would dare to invade us in the future?”

Everyone seemed to be focused on Xiao Hai and had even forgotten about the threat of Yuan Xiu.

In their opinion, as long as Xiao Hai was there, Nanzhou would be safe.

He was like the God of War in everyone’s eyes, protecting the cultivators in Nanzhou.

In Tianyun Sect.

Xiao Hai was slowly recovering.

He and Xiao Sheng sat on the Cultivation Mountain, and neither of them spoke.

“It’s been a long time since we’ve sat together like this,” Xiao Sheng said.

“Hmm, ” Xiao Hai said, “You and I have different aspirations.”

Xiao Sheng didn’t continue this topic. He sighed and said, “I didn’t expect you to still be alive.”

“Yeah, even I didn’t expect it.” Xiao Hai sighed.

“It’s all thanks to Qin Yu. If he didn’t risk his life to save me, I’m afraid I would have died.”

At the mention of Qin Yu, Xiao Sheng also nodded slightly.

“He’s a young man with great potential. His future achievements are limitless,” Xiao Sheng said.

“Yes, I’m very pleased that Nanzhou has such a young man.” Xiao Hai sighed.

Then, the two of them fell silent again.

They were blood brothers, but they didn’t seem to have much to say between them.

“When you reach the Reversion Void Stage, come and fight me.” Xiao Sheng spoke again.

“You know I won’t fight you,” Xiao Hai said, looking at him.

“I don’t understand.” Xiao Sheng shook his head slightly.

“No matter how I force you, you’ll never fight me. Why? Are you afraid of hurting me?” He sighed.

“Of course not. I just don’t want to fight you,” Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

A trace of bitterness appeared on Xiao Sheng’s face.

He didn’t know how to deal with this brother of his.

“Rest well.” In the end, Xiao Sheng turned around and walked down the Cultivation Mountain.

Nanzhou seemed to have entered a brief peaceful time, but behind this peace, people were worried.

Without a doubt, the reason for worry was Yuan Xiu.

As long as Yuan Xiu did not die, he would still pose a threat to Nanzhou.

In the North Plain.

In the entire North Plain, only He Teng and Yong Ji were left.

He Teng spent his days traveling around while Yong Ji was recuperating.

After a few days, his injuries were mostly healed.

Yong Ji looked at the heavy snow, his heart filled with emotions.

Who would have thought that the North Plain, which had been incomparably glorious not long ago, would actually fall into such a state?

“I feel a little lonely now.” Yong Ji sighed.

“Hahahahahaha!”

At this moment, an earth-shaking laughter came from not far away!

It came from He Teng!

Yong Ji turned around and looked in the direction of the laughter.

“So this is the Immortal Slaying Sect’s inheritance! This inheritance is mine!”

In a certain corner of North Plain, He Teng was holding a bundle of black light in his hands.

This light contained all the inheritance of the Immortal Slaying Sect, including its history and all kinds of cultivation techniques.

He Teng’s laughter echoed throughout the entire land. It was unknown how long had passed before the sound finally stopped.

A moment later, He Teng suddenly appeared beside Yong Ji.

This gave Yong Ji a bad feeling.

He looked at He Teng and said, “It seems like you’ve already gotten what you wanted.”

He Teng glanced at him and said indifferently, “Right.”

“What’s your plan? Continue to stay in the North Plain?” Yong Ji asked.

“No, I’m going to leave very soon,” He Teng said indifferently. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Yuan Xiu is dead. If we stay here, I’m afraid we’ll die a terrible death.”

Yong Ji was silent, feeling troubled.

He didn’t know what to do next.

“You can go back to Nanzhou. Haven’t you wanted to kill Qin Yu?” He Teng said with a half smile.

Yong Ji sighed and suddenly shook his head. “No. I’ve already given up.”

He suddenly looked at He Teng and said, “Take me with you.”

“What? You want to follow me?” He Teng said with his eyes narrowed.

“I guess so.” Yong Ji nodded.

A sinister smile appeared on He Teng’s face. He narrowed his eyes and said, “If you stay by my side, you might die at any time. You better think carefully.”

“It doesn’t matter.” Yong Ji shook his head.

During that battle, Yong Ji, who had always prided himself as a heaven’s favorite, suffered a huge blow.

If he couldn’t recover mentally, his cultivation level would probably stop at the Reversion Void Stage forever.

He Teng didn’t say anything. He seemed to have agreed.

...

In Nanzhou, people were everywhere.

Everyone seemed to be at ease, maybe because Yuan Xiu had been defeated or Xiao Hai was still alive.

At this moment, an extremely terrifying scene appeared in the void. Then, the void cracked!

Before everyone could recover from shock, they saw He Teng’s phantom walk out.

“This is...the Godly King of the North Plain!” Seeing He Teng’s figure, everyone was panicked!
