Gu Canghai was stunned when he heard Yan Sihai’s words.

He hurriedly explained, “Mr. Yan, I just received news that Qin Yu is in the Green Moon Villa. I...”

“What the f * ck!” Yan Sihai rudely interrupted Gu Canghai’s words.

“Trash, he has already broken into your place. You still don’t know? What’s the use of having a trash like you?!” Yan Sihai said angrily.

“Let me tell you, if you can’t even handle this, don’t work for the Yan family anymore!”

After saying this, Yan Sihai hung up the phone.

A dark look flashed across Gu Canghai’s face, and a murderous aura suddenly burst out.

“Qin Yu... I will definitely kill you!” Gu Canghai’s muscles kept twitching.

Ever since Qin Yu appeared, Gu Canghai had been scolded by Yan Sihai several times.

If this went on, he might really be kicked out.

Gu Canghai didn’t dare to think too much about it and immediately rushed to the Saint Confucian Sect.

...

Qin Yu sat under the waterfall and steadily absorbed the spiritual energy from the Spiritual Spring.

This spiritual energy was incomparably abundant and extremely pure.

The only pity was that Qin Yu had no way to take this Spiritual Spring away.

“If I step into the Martial Marquis realm, I will definitely occupy this Saint Confucian Sect!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Ever since he had talked to Jiang He, Qin Yu’s goal was no longer the Martial Marquis realm.

He wanted to step into the Martial Saint stage and step into the truly invincible stage!

He wanted to make the Han family and Yan family submit to him!

“As long as I step into the Martial Marquis stage, I can try to kill Martial Marquises,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The Martial Marquis stage was the Golden Core Stage in the cultivation world, and the Golden Core would be born in his body.

And inside the Golden Core would be his lifetime worth of cultivation.

As long as he swallowed the Golden Core, his cultivation would definitely improve at an astonishing speed.

Therefore, as long as he stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm, everything would be solved.

Qin Yu was like a spiritual energy filter, and the spiritual energy within all the water that passed through Qin Yu’s body would be completely absorbed.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, half a day had passed.

Qin Yu could clearly feel that the spiritual energy in his body was getting denser and denser.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes!

A trace of panic flashed across his face, and then he cried out in alarm, “Oh no!”

Qin Yu suddenly remembered that the Saint Confucian Sect belonged to the Yan family!

Since it belonged to the Yan family, the Yan family would definitely place their confidants in the Saint Confucian Sect to monitor Gu Canghai!

Therefore, his arrival was very likely to have been exposed!

“I actually forgot about Yan Sihai.” Qin Yu frowned tightly.

His mind raced, and a trace of viciousness flashed in his eyes.

Then, Qin Yu covered his face and quickly went to the main hall.

At this time, Deng Sheng was sitting on Gu Canghai’s seat and sipping tea.

After seeing Qin Yu, a trace of panic flashed in Deng Sheng’s eyes.

“Deng Sheng, immediately call over the people who were cultivating near the Spiritual Spring today,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Deng Sheng frowned and said, “What’s wrong?”

“Don’t ask. Go right away. Remember, everyone must come, not one less!” Qin Yu said anxiously.

Deng Sheng didn’t dare to say anything. He hurriedly followed Qin Yu’s request, and the ten or so people were all called over.

In the Great Hall, these ten plus people said with some puzzlement, “Elder Deng, you suddenly called us over. Is there something you want?”

Deng Sheng didn’t speak, because he didn’t know what exactly was the matter.

Thus, Deng Sheng subconsciously looked at Qin Yu, as if waiting for Qin Yu to speak.

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He swept his gaze over the crowd, and suddenly slapped out in mid-air!

“Kacha!”

This slap directly shattered a person’s head!

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically!

“What... What are you doing?!” Even Deng Sheng couldn’t help but shout loudly.

Qin Yu said coldly, “In order to prevent accidents, these people must die.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, these people instantly panicked.

But with their strength, how could they fight against Qin Yu?

In just a few minutes, these ten people all died tragically at Qin Yu’s hands!

As he looked at the bloodstains on the ground, Deng Sheng’s expression was extremely unsightly.

“Qin Yu, what do you want to do?!” Deng Sheng gritted his teeth and said.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I reckon that Gu Canghai has probably already received the news, and the news was spread from these few people.”

“How is that possible?!” Deng Sheng gnashed his teeth and said.

“I’ve already told you, the hierarchy of the Saint Confucian Sect is strict. They can’t get in touch with Gu Canghai!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Among them, I’m afraid there is someone who works for Yan Sihai.”

This feeling was extremely strong. Even though he killed all these people, Qin Yu was still worried.

“If Gu Canghai comes back later, it means that my guess is right.” Qin Yu looked at Deng Sheng.

“As for how to explain it, you have to think of a way.”

“I don’t have a way!” Deng Sheng was somewhat exasperated.

“These people are all elites of the Saint Confucian Sect. How can I explain how so many of them died in one go!?”

Qin Yu said, “You can tell him that I came, but remember, don’t mention the matter of me cultivating in the Spiritual Spring.”

Deng Sheng said coldly, “I really regret working with you.”

“It’s not too late for you to regret now. I can kill you, so you don’t have to explain.” Qin Yu looked at Deng Sheng with a pair of cold eyes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Deng Sheng froze when he sensed the murderous aura from Qin Yu.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Okay, I got it.”

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and immediately left the Saint Confucian Sect.

After he left the Saint Confucian Sect, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to return to the Green Moon Villa. Instead, he temporarily stayed in the Cangzao City and waited for an opportunity to make a move.

In the evening, Gu Canghai rushed back to the Saint Confucian Sect in a hurry as expected.

When he saw Gu Canghai’s face full of hatred, Deng Sheng’s heart immediately thumped.

“Has Qin Yu been here before?” Gu Canghai asked Deng Sheng coldly.

Deng Sheng suppressed the nervousness in his heart and pretended to be shocked. “Sect Master, how did you know?”

Gu Canghai’s expression immediately changed!

He clenched his fists and said through gritted teeth, “He actually came. Qin Yu...”

“Not only did he come, but he also killed more than ten of us,” Deng Sheng pretended to be in pain as he said.

“If it wasn’t for my quick escape, I’m afraid I would have died at his hands.”

“Qin Yu... Qin Yu, I must kill you!!!” Gu Canghai’s angry roar spread throughout the entire hall!

Deng Sheng couldn’t help but sigh in relief.

Luckily, Gu Canghai didn’t suspect him.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu found a place to stay for the time being.

At night, Deng Sheng sent a message to Qin Yu:

Everything went as you expected. Gu Canghai returned and knew that you had been here before.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He put down his phone and patted his chest lightly.

“If I hadn’t thought of this, I’m afraid I would have died at Gu Canghai’s hands.” Qin Yu patted his chest and couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief.

...

Jingdu, Han family.

Han Wei, who had been unconscious for many days, finally woke up.

“Son, you’re finally awake.” When he saw Han Wei wake up, Han Meng’s eyes couldn’t help but tear up.

Han Wei gnashed his teeth and said, “Dad, what about Qin Yu? I want to kill him!!”

At the mention of Qin Yu, Han Meng couldn’t help but sigh.

He gently patted Han Wei’s shoulder and said, “Have a good rest first.”

“I won’t! I want to kill Qin Yu! He must die!” As he said that, Han Wei struggled to get up.

When Han Meng saw the situation, he could only comfort him, “Don’t worry, Dad will definitely avenge you. I have already used my connections and asked Ma Hai to help.”

“Ma Hai?” Han Wei was stunned.

“The once powerful Ma Hai who became a recluse decades ago?”

Han Meng said coldly, “That’s right.”
