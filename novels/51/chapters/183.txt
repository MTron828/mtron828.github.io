Chapter 184: I Don’t Want to Be a Slave Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He never thought that there would be an unexpected harvest.

It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t excited.

And at this moment, Qin Yu was no longer ambivalent about the dark energy.

After this period of time, Qin Yu slowly understood that the resources of the various great clans were far from what an ordinary person like Qin Yu could compare to.

Therefore, if ordinary people wanted to be on par with the descendants of those great clans, they could only resort to unscrupulous means.

So what if it was dark energy? As long as it could increase his strength, he wouldn’t reject it.

After that, Qin Yu walked towards Qiu Feng.

He checked Qiu Feng’s breathing and found that he was still alive, but his internal qi was extremely weak.

Qin Yu shook his head helplessly. He could only inject a wisp of spiritual energy into him to temporarily save his life.

Qin Yu carried Qiu Feng and returned to the car.

At this time, when Wei Jiang saw Qiu Feng, he tremble all over. He even moved to the side.

“Qin Yu, Qiu Feng... What’s going on...” Wei Jiang asked with trembling lips.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “The Qiu Feng just now wasn’t the real him.”

“What about now?” Wei Jiang asked.

Updates by

Qin Yu smiled and said, “The current one is your good friend, Mr. Qiu. Remember to take him to the hospital.”

Wei Jiang had never heard of such a thing before, so he was confused.

“I’ll send you home.” Qin Yu didn’t explain to Wei Jiang anymore. He immediately drove to Wei Jiang’s home.

After sending Wei Jiang off, Qin Yu sent Wei Ming home.

“Mr. Qin, I can go back by myself,” Wei Ming said politely.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No need. I just have something to ask you.”

Wei Ming quickly asked, “Mr. Qin, if you have anything to say, just say it.”

After experiencing these few incidents, Wei Ming admired Qin Yu so much that he was practically Qin Yu’s fan.

Qin Yu said in a sullen voice, “Do you know what a chaotic body is?”

“Chaotic body?” Wei Ming froze, then he shook his head and said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Qin, I’ve never heard of this term.”

Qin Yu fell into silence.

It seemed that this so-called chaotic body wasn’t something that ordinary martial artists knew about.

“If there’s a chance, I have to go to the southwest and ask about it clearly,” Qin Yu whispered.

The car soon arrived at the door of Wei Ming’s home.

As soon as they reached the door, they saw a middle-aged man standing at the door.

This middle-aged man was none other than Wei Ming’s father, Wei Tao.

“Dad, why are you here?” Wei Ming asked in surprise after getting out of the car.

However, Wei Tao said with a dark expression, “Come here!”

His attitude stunned Wei Ming.

“Dad, what’s wrong?” Wei Ming asked in confusion.

Wei Tao didn’t say anything.

He walked directly to Qin Yu and said with a cold expression, “You are Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu said politely, “Greetings, Mr. Wei.”

Wei Tao hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Don’t greet me. The Wei family can’t afford to offend you!”

“Dad, what are you talking about?!” Wei Ming immediately became anxious.

“Shut up!” Wei Tao immediately shouted!

Qin Yu frowned slightly and had a vague hunch.

As expected, in the next second, Wei Tao walked in front of Qin Yu.

“Despite your young age, you recklessly and cockily cause trouble wherever you go. You’re too big for your britches!” Wei Tao scolded.

“How can an ordinary person like you offend the Jiang Family? Do you have any idea what a hierarchy is?” Wei Tao said with a cold expression.

When he heard this term, Qin Yu’s expression slowly turned cold.

“Mr. Wei, are you lecturing me?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Mr. Qin, my father didn’t mean that!” Wei Ming hurriedly tried to smooth things over.

Wei Tao was unmoved. He snorted coldly and said, “Let me tell you one thing. In this era, personal ability isn’t the most important thing. I have seen many geniuses. In the end, they only end up working for the big families.”

“Being too arrogant isn’t a good thing!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Mr. Wei, it is because of this sort of belief that those big families think they can do whatever they want.”

“I am different from you. In my eyes, anyone should have the right and courage to question and resist injustice.”

“I don’t want to be a slave for the rest of my life.”

After listening to Qin Yu’s words, Wei Tao sneered again and again.

“There is only one final result for a thought like yours.”

“That is to die young.”

Qin Yu still wanted to say something, but Wei Tao waved his hand to stop him. “Qin Yu, please don’t interact with Wei Ming in the future.”

“Dad, what are you talking about?!” Wei Ming’s expression was instantly filled with anxiety.

Qin Yu smiled and nodded. “Okay, I got it.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Not long after, Wei Ming called.

He repeatedly apologized over the phone. “Mr. Qin, I’m really sorry. My dad didn’t mean that. You...” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“No need to explain. I won’t hold it against you,” Qin Yu interrupted Wei Ming.

“Your dad is doing this for your own good. Just stay at home for the next few days.”

After saying that, Qin Yu hung up the phone.

Qin Yu wasn’t surprised by Wei Tao’s attitude.

With his age and status, every step he took was like treading on thin ice.

The slightest carelessness would lead to eternal damnation.

Therefore, Qin Yu could completely understand.

Only when a person had no ties of fetters could he be fearless.

Just like how Qin Yu currently was.

The car sped all the way back to the hotel.

Looking at the dent at the front of the car, Qin Yu muttered, “D*mn it, it needs major repairs. What a waste of my money. I must find a chance to get back at that b*stard.”

...

The next day, the news of Qin Yu betting on stones at the venue quickly spread.

For a time, rumors started circulating in the provincial capital nonstop.

“Qin Yu beat up the Eldest Young Master of the Jiang family so badly, but nothing happened?”

“Yeah, I heard that he went stone gambling yesterday!”

“Could it be that the Jiang family doesn’t have the guts to retaliate?”

“Tsk, the Jiang family hasn’t done anything in the past few years. I think that the Jiang family isn’t as impressive as the rumors say they are.”

Everyone was puzzled.

The Jiang family actually didn’t do anything?

At this moment, in the Jiang family’s living room.

Dozens of martial artists stood in front of Mr. Zhong.

Among these people, eight of them were Inner Strength Past Masters. Even in the entire Chuzhou, they were top-notch.

Ever since Jiang Haoran was beaten into a vegetable, the Jiang family was temporarily managed by the butler Mr. Zhong.

“Mr. Zhong, there’s a rumor going around saying that the Jiang family is cowardly!”

“Not only did Qin Yu not run away, but he is even keeping up a high profile in the city. If this continues, the Jiang family’s position will be jeopardized!”

“Mr. Zhong, let us avenge the Eldest Young Master!”

Everyone, extremely furious, shouted in unison.

However, Mr. Zhong was unmoved. He just sat there drinking tea.

“Mr. Zhong, say something!”

“Mr. Zhong, do you want to seize control of the Jiang family and appropriate all its assets?” At this moment, someone suddenly said.

When he heard this, Mr. Zhong’s expression instantly turned cold.

The teacup in his hand was instantly crushed!
