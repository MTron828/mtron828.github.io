2158 A Truly Terrifying Duel!

For a moment, there was a trace of panic in the eyes of everyone present.

Despite their incredible strength and the fact that they had already set up a formation at the place, their eyes were still full of fear as they faced the celestial artifact in Dean Lei‚Äôs hand.

That was the magical artifact of Immortal Emperor Lei. It was not difficult for him to wipe out the Holy Region, let alone kill them!

For countless years, no one had ever used a celestial artifact in the Holy Region. Such a battle was usually in the starry sky, which had destroyed countless stars.

But now that Dean Lei had taken out this item, it showed his determination.

Everyone turned to look at Yan Tianshi because he was the only one leading this negotiation.

However, no one had expected Yan Tianshi not to show any fear in the face of Dean Lei‚Äôs celestial artifact.

He looked coldly at Dean Lei and said, ‚ÄúDo you think only your Thunder Courtyard has celestial artifacts?‚Äù

As soon as he said that, the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Everyone turned to look at Yan Tianshi with surprise and doubt.

They never expected Yan Tianshi to use a celestial artifact!

Qin Yu‚Äôs expression was incomparably ugly. He had never thought Yan Tianshi would be so determined to get rid of him to the extent that he was willing to use the celestial artifact!

‚ÄúAre you scaring me? Do you think I‚Äôll be scared?‚Äù Dean Lei said coldly.

Yan Tianshi slightly narrowed his eyes. He did not say anything else. He reached out his hand and took out a pagoda flickering with a mysterious light.

The pagoda was suspended in Yan Tianshi‚Äôs palm, emitting a tremendously ancient and mysterious power that was unfathomable.

This pagoda looked simple and unadorned, but it seemed to have contained a destructive power. The moment it was taken out, everyone could not help but feel a powerful sense of oppression!

Qin Yu‚Äôs face was even paler, and even breathing was a little difficult in his chest!

‚ÄúDivine Destiny Pagoda, the magical artifact of Immortal Emperor Tianming!‚Äù someone exclaimed.

No one expected Yan Tianshi to bring the Divine Destiny Pagoda!

The moment the two celestial artifacts appeared, they seemed to have started to fight against each other!

Although the two magical artifacts did not seem to be glowing, invisible power was constantly resisting each other!

The expressions of Dean Lei and Yan Tianshi changed slightly. Before they could react, the two magical artifacts had risen into the air. The terrifying power was constantly resisting each other.

There was no shocking and grand collision of the internal qi at the scene, but the entire Peach Blossom Island trembled at this moment! UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

The few True Saints were shaken and vomited blood non-stop, and their bodies flew backward. They used all their strength to resist, but it was still futile!

They were existences at the pinnacle of their realm, the genuine and substantial True Saint Realm.

Such a cultivation realm in the face of celestial artifacts was not even qualified to resist. Only the heavens knew how terrifying the Immortal Emperor was!

Qin Yu‚Äôs expression was also tremendously ugly. If it weren‚Äôt for Wu Ji‚Äôs divine robe protecting his body, he would probably have long perished at this moment!

‚ÄúRumble‚Ä¶‚Äù

The sky was covered with dark clouds, and the ground was constantly collapsing. Densely packed cracks appeared on the ground and the entire Peach Blossom Island seemed to be about to collapse at any time!

The confrontation between the two magical artifacts caused the space to distort violently and the ground to collapse. Cracks spread on Peach Blossom Island as if the entire island was on the verge of collapse!

The energy fluctuations of the magical artifacts became increasingly intense. The air was filled with a scorching internal qi as if the entire world was enveloped by the confrontation between these two magical artifacts. Lightning interweave, and starlight flickered, forming a magnificent and mysterious scene!

As the confrontation intensified, all the ways collapsed, and everyone at the scene suffered from this collision. The scene on Peach Blossom Island became even more terrifying. The degree of cracking on the ground became even more severe, and the island trembled even more violently!

The world seemed to be filled with an internal qi of danger. An unprecedented fear rose in everyone‚Äôs hearts!

However, despite such circumstances, Dean Lei and Yan Tianshi still did not have any intention of stopping. It was as if they wanted to destroy the Holy Region!

‚ÄúThe two of you‚Ä¶ Please stop!‚Äù a True Saint cried out in alarm. They did not want these two lunatics to destroy everything!

However, the two were incomparably stubborn. Dean Lei sneered and said, ‚ÄúStop? Come on, at most we‚Äôll die together!‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs destroy this Holy Region together!‚Äù Yan Tianshi roared with madness!

The earth was non-stop collapsing. The terrifying internal qi was no longer limited to Peach Blossom Island but spread to the entire Zhongzhou! For a moment, everyone was affected by the collision!

Looking up, the sky had become tremendously ferocious. Some of the weaker ones had even died before they could react and turned into ashes!

Qin Yu looked down from Peach Blossom Island and saw countless people losing their lives in an instant!

Some were reuniting with their families, some were playing with their children in the fields, and some were meeting their loved ones. However, all of this no longer existed. They did not even have the time to say goodbye before they completely disappeared from this world!

Many families were torn apart by this disaster, with loved ones losing each other in an instant.

In the arms of their parents, the children‚Äôs laughter stopped abruptly. The cruel reality had taken away their hope in life.

Couples were ruthlessly separated in this catastrophe, unable to embrace each other again.

All living beings fled in all directions in horror. They wanted to escape from this place shrouded in the shadow of destruction. However, no matter where they fled, the terrifying power of the magical artifacts permeated the entire Zhongzhou as if there was nowhere to escape.

Sobbing, wailing, and shouting rose and fell, mixing with the atmosphere of destruction.

People lost their family members, friends, and loved ones. Their hope and happiness had been completely taken away at this moment, leaving only deep pain and endless sadness.

Countless people knelt on the ground and put their palms together, praying that a god would descend and a miracle would happen to save them from this catastrophe. However, they understood that such hope was just their wishful thinking. They had already fallen into a desperate situation, and what awaited them was only the fate of destruction.

Even those powerful cultivators seemed insignificant and powerless at this moment.

In front of their own strength, they felt incredibly insignificant and could not withstand the collision of the celestial artifacts.

They might have been full of confidence in the past, but in this disaster, they could not change anything at all.

The entire Zhongzhou was shrouded in sorrow and fear. The pitiful image of all living beings was heartbreaking.

They were innocent. They were just dragged into a fight and became innocent victims.

Qin Yu looked at the people wailing in pain and despair. He suddenly turned around and shouted at the top of his lungs, ‚ÄúStop‚Ä¶ All stop!‚Äù
