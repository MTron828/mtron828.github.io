2514 Unimaginable

Hua Zhikong and the others listened to their conversation. Even though they were unhappy, they dared not mock them.

After all, facing the monster race’s number one Godly King, not everyone could survive.

Not long after, Revered Qi appeared in the main hall after learning of Qin Yu’s arrival.

“Qin Yu, I believe you’ve learned about the aftermath of this war from Lei Xin. The human race has fallen into a serious disadvantage in this war, and this time, I have to inform you of a few things.”

Revered Qi sat on the throne, his face did not show much expression.

“Revered Qi, feel free to tell me if you have anything. We will do our best for the sake of the human race if it’s within our capabilities, just like this time.”

Qin Yu nodded. This time, Human Race Watch suffered heavy casualties, and many people saw it.

“Firstly, it’s about the supreme treasure of the ghost race that Ksitigarbha mentioned. Is the Judge’s Brush in your hands? This time, Ksitigarbha only took out the Book of Life and Death, not the Judge’s Brush. This brush is crucial for our human race to study the secrets of the ghost race. Moreover, you won’t be able to protect this treasure in your hands. If the ghost race takes it back, Ksitigarbha’s power will increase by at least 20%. This brush has to be handed over to the higher-ups for safekeeping.

“Secondly, we can see from this battle that the coordination among the alliances is still extremely weak. Although Human Race Watch has experienced this battle, its coordination with the other aristocratic families is extremely poor. Therefore, the alliance plans to send people to manage Human Race Watch.”

“Revered Qi, you might have misunderstood. In this battle, regardless of higher-ups or middle and low levels, Human Race Watch coordinated quite well and killed massive alien races. In terms of coordination among the various aristocratic families, which one can do better than Human Race Watch?”

Jiang Qingyuan frowned slightly and hesitated for a moment before raising his doubts.

“Are you questioning my orders?”

Revered Qi’s indifferent eyes stared at Jiang Qingyuan.

He instantly grunted, and his face turned pale.

“Revered Qi, is there a third matter?”

Qin Yu stared at the person on the throne and asked calmly.

“Of course, there is. The third matter concerns the future of the human race. Now that the ghost race has a fifth-level and above expert, the human race needs to make plans as soon as possible. There are a few people who can make it. Teng Zixu, you, Yan Ruoxue, Si Shiyue, and several people from the four sects and four schools. The human race has already given them all the resources they can.”

He paused and continued.

“Now, you, Si Shiyue, and Yan Ruoxue are special. The two of you who have a chaotic body will most likely have significant transformation when combined with the Heavenly Emperor bloodline. I should have chosen you based on your relationship with Yan Ruoxue. However, you are walking the path of the Way of Anomaly. Considering the future of the human race, I’ve thus chosen Yan Ruoxue and Si Shiyue to become the Dao companions.”

As Revered Qi Zun’s voice sounded, the main hall fell silent.

Many people thought Qin Yu had come here to be rewarded with all the resources. After all, Qin Yu had contributed this time.

Among everyone, he should be ranked among the top.

This was something that even the Ni family and Thunder Courtyard, who had great enmity with Qin Yu, had to admit. However, they did not expect Revered Qi to make such three requests this time.

It was more like a criminal interrogation scene. Even they did not expect it to be such a situation.

“Since Revered Qi has said that I’m also a human race with a chance of reaching the fifth level and above, why can’t you choose me?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, his body ice-cold.

Not only did many people not think of this, but even if they thought of the alliance doing something terrible, they did not think it would be such a situation.

He looked at Revered Qi’s body and suddenly had a terrifying thought.

“It’s my order and I initially didn’t want to explain it. Since you’ve contributed significantly this time, I’ll explain. Look at the higher-ups of the human race, Senior Brother Su of Kunlun, Junior Sister of the Divine Night Sect, and even the Immortal Emperor’s cultivation path. Who has chosen the Way of Anomaly? Xiao Sheng, the Overlord of the monster race, and the masked woman have chosen the same path as you.”

Revered Qi said coldly and continued.

“If you understand what I mean, you should state your position soon. Otherwise, it will lead to an irreparable disaster if we detect any unusual intent.”

“Then how does Revered Qi judge I have an unusual intent? Tell us your analysis, or do you mean that people who walk the Way of Anomaly should be listed as important people to monitor? Since Revered Qi has made such a humiliating request to me, I’m sure you don’t mind explaining further.”

Qin Yu said with a smile.

“With a major battle imminent, special orders must be taken. I wonder if you are satisfied with my explanation?”

“Qin Yu, don’t try to confuse the public. Let me ask you. What relationship does Xiaoyu have with the masked woman? Why does she look exactly the same as the masked woman? Also, the demonic egg that made the masked woman turn around came from you! Furthermore, what is your relationship with Xiao Sheng and Xiao Hai? If you want an explanation, can you explain all this? We didn’t kill you directly. The alliance has been polite to you!”

Hua Zhikong sneered and nodded at Ni Qian.

Ni Qian took out a crystal ball and said to everyone.

“These things are all images recorded from reality. If there are any doubts, you can go and investigate.”

“It’s ridiculous. This was something that had been mentioned before the invasion of the three races. Furthermore, the monster race has personally admitted that Qin Yu had destroyed the greatest sacrifice ritual in the history of the monster race. There was also the final full-powered attack of the Fallen Godly King. All of them wanted to kill Qin Yu. Wouldn’t saying these make people laugh their heads off?”

This time, the one who raised the doubt was Yan Minglong of the Yan family. No matter how good-tempered he was, he could not suppress the anger in his heart.

“Maybe he’s putting on a show for us. Who would have such a connection with an alien race?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Hua Zhikong sneered and continued. Seeing Revered Qi express his will, he naturally wanted to hit him while he was down.

“Show me how you can receive the Fallen Godly King’s attack and put on a show for me? B*stard!”

Yan Minglong was enraged when he heard a junior rebuke him.

Hua Zhikong’s face turned green and white, but he dared not say anything else.

At this moment, the Gu family, and even the Yan family were also against it.

Especially Yan Tianshi and it surprised Qin Yu even more.

Qin Yu felt a warmth in his heart. There were still people with clear minds among the human race.

Qin Yu helped the Gu family and then led Human Race Watch to fight against the alien race in between these two battles.

Especially in the face of He Teng’s final attack, those confident of surviving were probably only a handful.

Under that attack, almost no one thought Qin Yu could survive.

If it was truly an act, it was way too much risking his life…
