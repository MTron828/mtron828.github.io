2164 Into the Void!

Dazzling starlight gradually appeared on the bodies of the two elders. Their true essence surged continuously, resonating with the surrounding starry sky.

The starlight in the starry sky vortex became increasingly brighter, gathering on the bodies of the two elders like a tide.

“Ah!”

After a loud roar, the void began to distort violently! A large area before Qin Yu even collapsed!

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed drastically. One after another, huge holes appeared before him. Those were signs of the void collapsing!

The holes became bigger. Once it entered the void, no one knew what would happen!

“Ah!”

The voices of the two elders shook everywhere. Obviously, the use of this technique was also incredibly strenuous for them!

However, they were reluctant to miss such an opportunity. Once Qin Yu entered the void, it would mean he could never walk out and would definitely die within!

No one knew the mysteries of the void, but Xiao Sheng’s Rashomon could explain everything!

The void before him was still collapsing, and the entire area in front of him had turned into a pitch-black hole!

Qin Yu roared with all his might. He tried his best to control the warship to change its direction, but the collapse before him was simply too great. No matter which direction Qin Yu turned, he could not escape from this pitch-black hole!

“Go to hell!”

Accompanied by the two elders’ hoarse roars, the terrifying true essence in their bodies seemed to form two giant hands that actually forcibly tore apart the void before Qin Yu!

At this moment, Qin Yu had no way to escape. He could only stare with his eyes wide open as he watched the warship sink into the massive hole and the void!

Terrifying dizziness instantly rushed over. Qin Yu could only feel everything spinning!

It was desolate and lifeless. There was endless darkness all around. There were no stars flickering or light shining.

Qin Yu’s warship passed through the massive hole and entered this desolate void. As soon as he entered, he felt a deep loneliness and coldness.

The entire void seemed to be a bottomless abyss. Darkness swallowed all light, making it impossible for people to determine their direction.

A sense of powerlessness rose in Qin Yu’s heart. He felt that his existence had become insignificant. Compared to this desolate void, he was like a speck of dust, so insignificant that it made him feel despair.

There was no wind, no sound, no color. There was only endless darkness and deadly silence.

Qin Yu tried to mobilize his true essence to move the warship forward but realized there was no response in this desolate void. His efforts and struggles seemed to have become insignificant ripples, unable to change the surrounding environment.

Soon, due to the immense dizziness, Qin Yu’s vision started to become blurry, and he could no longer sense anything! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Is this the world that Rashomon swallowed…”

Before Qin Yu fainted, this sentence could not help but appear in his mind.

Soon, the massive hole began to heal slowly. In just a moment, everything returned to silence as if nothing had happened.

The starry sky was still the same starry sky, decorated with light and incomparably beautiful.

The two elders looked coldly in the direction where Qin Yu disappeared, and a cold, indifferent smile appeared on the corners of their mouths.

“We finally got rid of him,” an elder sneered and said.

“Once he enters the void, he will definitely die. Our effort this time is not wasted.”

“Unfortunately… We didn’t get the Traceless Immortal Scripture from him.”

There was only one copy of the Traceless Immortal Scripture. Qin Yu’s disappearance would mean the Traceless Immortal Scripture would no longer exist.

They stood there for a long while, afraid that something unexpected would happen.

It was only when everything quieted down that they finally let go of their worries.

“He’s finally dead.” The two heaved a long sigh of relief and then raised their heads to laugh heartily.

This laughter traveled tens of thousands of li, causing the entire starry sky to tremble!

They did not stay any longer. They turned around, returned to the warship, and disappeared into the starry sky.

…

Qin Yu and his warship fell into endless darkness.

It was the mysterious void zone. Once one entered it, there was no possibility of leaving.

In this void, everything was barren and endless darkness. There was no color.

There was an incredibly terrifying, dense, and mysterious internal qi here. That internal qi caused the entire warship to rumble, and countless wounds even appeared.

Qin Yu also slowly woke up under this tremendous pressure.

When he opened his eyes, he could not see anything clearly. There seemed to be no difference between opening and closing his eyes here.

The void was pitch-black, without a trace of light and any trace of material existence. There was no air current or sound transmission in the surroundings. It was like a quiet area isolated from the world.

Qin Yu felt that he was in an endless, boundless space. He had no sense of direction and could not differentiate the positions of up, down, left, and right. His existence seemed to have been swallowed by this void. The outline of his body gradually blurred and merged into the endless darkness.

In this desolate void, Qin Yu felt a deep sense of loneliness and powerlessness. His breathing became difficult as if the air was being swallowed by this void. He was isolated in a deadly stillness.

There was no scenery, no stars, and no signs of life in the surroundings. This void was like a forgotten corner, abandoned by time and forever immersed in darkness and silence.

Qin Yu tried to mobilize his true essence to release light, but his efforts seemed to be absorbed by this void, and there was no response. He felt that his power had become insignificant and could not change the state of desolation.

Time became blurry in the void. There was no alternating between day and night, no concept of time. Qin Yu felt he was being trapped in eternal darkness, and time had become irrelevant.

His thoughts gradually quieted down, leaving only helplessness and despair toward death. This void devoured his hope and will, and he gradually lost himself in this desolated world.

“Ah…”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s perception began to recover. He only felt that his body was being pressed down by a tremendously heavy internal qi, causing him unbearable pain. Cracks continuously appeared on his body!

“It’s so… terrifying… Pressure…” Qin Yu uttered a sound with difficulty, but after uttering the sound, it was directly swallowed and nothing was left!

No one knew the origin of this heavy internal qi, but its powerful oppressive feeling was something that even Qin Yu’s physical body could not resist!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, Wu Ji’s divine robe on Qin Yu’s body emitted rays of light, resisting this internal qi.

Wu Ji’s divine robe was incomparably powerful, but under this internal qi, it gradually became much dimmer. Qin Yu’s physical body was still continuously collapsing!

If not for Wu Ji’s divine robe on his body, Qin Yu would probably have long turned into a pile of meat paste!
