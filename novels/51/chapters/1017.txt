Chapter 1018: In chapter 1,018, Gu Xinghe and he teng fell out 

Qin Yu stared at this magnificent scene.

Although there was no joy or sadness on his face, he exuded a domineering aura. It was as if a deity had descended to the mortal world and no one dared to look directly at him.

The golden light on his body and the traces of bright red that were stained by it looked even more terrifying under the sunlight!

A martial saint was like a dog butcher. Everyone knew that from now on, no one would be able to stop this young man.

Looking at the two martial saints who were kneeling on the ground to express their goodwill, Qin Yu lifted them up with a wave of gentle air.

The two of them were terrified and did not dare to look at Qin Yu directly.

They did not know what their fate would be.

Whether they lived or died was no longer within their control.

“From now on, the Heaven Gate will be the number one sect in the Sheng Kingdom and even the entire world,”Qin Yu said quietly.

Although his voice was soft, it was like the sound of a loud bell, making people’s hearts tremble.

Everyone raised their heads in unison, their eyes shining with a hint of light.

They did not know whether that light was excited or nervous.

Qin Yu turned around and walked into the main hall.

He wanted to understand the situation of heaven gate as soon as possible.

Nie tianxiang was summoned into the hall again, and the two martial saints who followed Hua Zongxiong stood at the side, waiting for Qin Yu’s order.

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked down at the map.

The drawing on the map was Hua Zongxiong’s next target.

It had to be said that Hua Zongxiong’s thoughts were exactly the same as Qin Yu’s.

The plan written on the map had saved Qin Yu some trouble.

A group of people stood on both sides of the hall.

These people were the higher-ups of the Heaven Gate. They were also the quasi martial saints who had the highest chance of becoming a martial saint.

Among them was Zhu Jinglong, who was known as the number one genius of the Heaven Gate.

Looking at the group of people in front of him, Qin Yu did not say anything. No one knew what he was thinking.

However, the people below were not as natural as Qin Yu

They felt uneasy. After all, they had just betrayed Qin Yu and belonged to Hua Zongxiong.

“Tomorrow at eight o’clock in the morning, everyone will gather in the main hall. I want to preach the Dao,”Qin Yu said.

Everyone was stunned, but they quickly understood!

Preach the Dao? Stepping into the Martial Saint Stage?

“Thank you, sect leader Qin!”Everyone shouted in unison!

Qin Yu looked down at everyone from above. He only had the bearing of an emperor.

Perhaps it was because of the confidence brought by his strength. In the face of so many people, even if Qin Yu did not do anything, the powerful pressure was suffocating.

Other than preaching to these quasi martial saints, Qin Yu also had to refine a large number of pills.

These pills were distributed to the many disciples and distributed as rewards.

There was no difference in essence between managing a sect and managing a company.

Using both kindness and power was a method that would never go out of style.

After that, Qin Yu walked down from the sacred chair.

The many disciples quickly lowered their heads and did not dare to look at Qin Yu directly.

Qin Yu’s steps were extremely slow. Each step seemed to step on everyone’s heart.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s figure stopped at Zhu Jinglong’s side.

Zhu Jinglong’s heart thumped and a drop of bean-sized sweat condensed from his sweat glands.

Qin Yu stood there and did not speak for a long time.

However, Zhu Jinglong’s heart was extremely nervous.

Just as Qin Yu had guessed, he already had the intention to rebel in his heart. He was just waiting for the moment he stepped into the martial saint realm.

Initially, he thought that no one would know about it. However, Qin Yu’s actions seemed to have peeled away his outer appearance and looked straight into his heart.

A moment later, Qin Yu raised his palm and gave Zhu Jinglong’s shoulder a heavy slap.

Zhu Jinglong’s expression froze and his body could not help but tremble.

Qin Yu did not say a word, but it was like a heavy hammer that smashed into his heart.

...

At the same time, in the fire country’s Pyro Province.

Many of the younger generation were also trying to break through to the martial saint realm.

Under such a big environment, who knew how many people had chosen to seclude themselves in seclusion, unwilling to compete with others.

Among them, the most promising one was naturally Yan Jinyao.

And Gu Xinghe was still busy with his “Career”.

In his office, stood a young man.

The young man was hidden under the black robe, and the cold internal Qi on his body could not be concealed at all.

“From today onwards, you must stop all your actions.”Gu Xinghe said coldly as he looked at he teng.

“Now, all the blame is on Qin Yu. Now that Qin Yu has escaped from the fire country, if you continue to absorb the inner strength of others, you will be exposed sooner or later.”

He Teng pursed his lips and said: “Young master he, please rest assured... . .”

Although he said that, under the black robe, a trace of gloom flashed across He Teng’s face.

There was already a beginning. If he wanted to stop, how could Gu Xinghe stop him with just one sentence?

Moreover, he teng had a strong feeling in his heart at this moment.

He was only one step away from becoming a martial saint.

Once he became a martial saint, he would be able to break free from the restrictions of the martial arts association in Jingdu!

... . .

The entire fire country was in peace and harmony.

Ever since Qin Yu had left, everything seemed to have returned to peace.

Qin Yu had left for an entire half a month, and everyone seemed to have forgotten about Qin Yu.

But on this very day, the slaughter had quietly begun.

He Teng had made his move once again, killing over ten young disciples in one go!

These young disciples were all from a martial arts aristocratic family. With so many of them dead, they would naturally not let this matter rest.

Gu Xinghe quickly found out about this matter. He stood in his office and said furiously, “He Teng, do you take my words to heart! ?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He Teng said indifferently, “Why is young master Gu so nervous? Even if Qin Yu is not in the country, we can still continue to place the blame on Qin Yu’s head.”

“Whether he is in the Yan country or not, isn’t it still up to you to decide?”

Gu Xing he’s face darkened and he said coldly: “Do I still need you to teach me how to do it?”

“He Teng, I’m warning you, you better stop that Filthy Act of yours!”

He Teng’s eyes narrowed and he laughed coldly: “Filthy Act? Young Master Gu, isn’t the instigator of all this, you?”

“Are you courting death? !”Gu Xinghe was instantly enraged!

He Teng subconsciously took a step back, he narrowed his eyes and said, “Young Master Gu, you better not force me, or else... I will expose your dirty behavior to the public! Let everyone know that the one who killed was not Qin Yu, but you, the dignified leader of the martial arts world!”
