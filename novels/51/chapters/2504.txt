2505 The Fallen Killing Intent

Taking the opportunity of this gap, his body suddenly was pulled into the spatial passageway and teleported to that coordinate.

“Qin Yu, what else can you do other than hide?”

After He Teng’s palm landed, he did not stop.

Instead, he used that massive force to attack Qin Yu again.

“Boom!”

This time, Qin Yu could not dodge in time.

Just as his old strength was exhausted and before new strength emerged, He Teng forcibly used the power of his body to deliver a blow once again.

Qin Yu only had time to unleash Singularity Space at the end to offset a portion of He Teng’s physical strength.

Following that, his body was sent flying, and in an instant, he felt his soul and body had completely lost contact.

In a short time, he could not control the power of his body, and the internal organs in his body seemed to be dislocated.

The sensation of sweetness rushed to his throat, and he could not help but spit out a large mouthful of blood.

He Teng did not stop attacking. His soul carried a crazy sense of obsession, and he would not stop until he killed Qin Yu.

At this moment, many of the Human Race Watch wanted to assist.

However, they would definitely be targeted by the alien race once they made any movement. Therefore, even though they had been fighting for fifteen minutes, no one could assist Qin Yu.

“Whoosh!”

In his dantian, light blue energy surged toward his limbs and bones.

The energy of the Heart of the Ocean healed his injuries at a tremendous speed.

In Si Shiyue’s breakthrough just now, the five elements surrounded the Si family, and the rich water element restored a part of the power of the Heart of the Ocean.

However, in an instant, a giant hand suddenly stretched out from the space beside him and sent Qin Yu flying with another punch.

“You have quite a number of Dharma Treasures on you. I’d like to see how many of my attacks you can withstand.”

He Teng revealed a ferocious expression, and his attacks became increasingly intense.

Although Qin Yu had the Heart of the Ocean to heal his injuries and the spatial technique to dodge, he felt heavily pressured under the attack, which was hard to figure out.

Although He Teng merely used the strength of his physical body, his casual attack had the power of the Tribulation Fifth Level.

This power was comparable to the God-slaying Dusk, but it could launch an attack within a breath.

Even Si Liuhe and the others were shocked.

Only Qin Yu could last until now. If it were anyone else, they would probably be crushed into meat paste, not even a few rounds.

Moreover, Qin Yu could clearly feel a portion of the power was reserved whenever He Teng attacked.

That power gradually piled up and hid in the depths of his body.

If he revealed a flaw, the earth-shaking power would pour down on him without hesitation.

Black saber! Thunder burst!

He Teng was a foot away from Qin Yu when he was suddenly struck by a hidden sword energy that suddenly appeared.

It contained the surging power of thunder and lightning, which blasted his body to the side.

In an instant, He Teng let out an angry howl, and the demonic wings on his body spread out.

In the massive shadow, Qin Yu was sent flying by He Teng, whose speed increased by a level.

Even the space several thousand feet behind Qin Yu was instantly shattered by He Teng.

“D*mn it!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. Although he did not turn around, he could vaguely smell the terrifying demonic qi emitted from He Teng’s body.

The embers of fire sparked within his pupils, and Evil Eye lit up again.

God-slaying Dusk!

Terrifying power exploded on the ground again, and the affected living beings in the surroundings instantly turned into ashes.

A terrifying wound appeared on He Teng’s body. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, as he continued to attack, the terrifying hole began to wiggle and recover at a tremendously fast speed.

“Let’s see how many times you can launch such an attack!”

He Teng was exasperated.

“After being entangled by the Fallen Godly King for so long, he could still counterattack. This kid is not to be underestimated.”

Even Revered Qi, who held authority at the center, was somewhat surprised.

Originally, he thought Qin Yu would be defeated very quickly when facing this Fallen Godly King.

He did not expect their entanglement to last nearly 30 minutes. Although Qin Yu looked worse for wear, surprisingly, he still had enough strength to injure He Teng.

“This kid also has a chaotic body and has even acquired the Glazed Holy Body. In the fourth grade True Saint, he entered the ninth level of purgatory and survived against Nightmare. He is also a rare human race cultivator.”

Yan Minglong, by the side, shared some information about Qin Yu.

At this moment, even Lei Li, Lei Huan, and the others who had conflicts with Qin Yu were silent.

“He actually managed to cultivate the Glazed Holy Body. No wonder the spiritual energy in his body was incredibly dense.”

Jiang Qingyuan suddenly enlightened.

However, more people’s gazes toward Qin Yu seemed to change slightly.

There were records of the acquired Glazed Holy Body. One had to go through many physical hardships before one could forge that piece of holy bone.

Almost everyone knew how tough it was. Many people looked at Qin Yu with admiration.

Regardless of where they were, they ultimately respected the strong.

The fact that Qin Yu could hold back the strongest Fallen Godly King of the monster race in this race struggle was already sufficient to prove his value.

The two fought directly. It was the most intense struggle on this battlefield at this point, and it attracted the attention of many experts.

Desolate divine eye, second level!

Massive chaotic qi surged into the desolate divine eye.

The world before his eyes suddenly changed. He Teng’s terrifying demonic qi in the world of Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye opened up layer by layer.

He Teng’s recovery process slowly displayed before Qin Yu’s eyes.

He now had He Teng’s monster race arm in his hand. It was an arm transformed by the power of the monster race’s Path of Heaven.

In his previous exploration, he had failed to gain an insight into the mysteries within.

The battle with He Teng at this moment might be a rare opportunity.

“You’re courting death. You want to pry into my body!”

Under the gaze of that terrifying golden gaze, He Teng felt his entire body had been stripped bare from head to toe.

He was instantly furious. The terrifying power of his punch directly destroyed the world of the desolate divine eye.

With a buzz, Qin Yu felt his sea of consciousness explode.

The world of the desolate divine eye was smashed, and the power of the backlash instantly affected Qin Yu’s entire sea of consciousness, causing him a brief moment of delay.

“What a pity!”

Qin Yu almost slapped He Teng’s thigh. He did not expect He Teng to react so fast.

Almost as soon as he activated the desolate divine eye, He Teng shattered this vision power. However, he still managed to pry into some details of the demonic body’s recovery.

“You’re courting death! Qin Yu!”

He Teng’s immense strength descended again, taking the opportunity of the moment he defeated the desolate divine eye.

It directly stomped Qin Yu into the ground. This terrifying power made Qin Yu instantly spit out numerous fragments of internal organs.

His body dragged a massive ravine on the ground, and his terrifying power even shattered the Ji family’s formation.

The Heart of the Ocean let out a loud buzz as if sensing its host’s body in great danger.
