Use the Martial Saint weapon!

Hearing this, the black-gold robe powerhouses couldn’t help but look at each other.

One had to know that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association hadn’t used the Martial Saint weapon for many years.

Even during Qin Yu’s incident last time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association hadn’t used the Martial Saint weapon!

“Is there a need for that? We have made so many preparations, so why do we need to use the Martial Saint weapon?” Someone said coldly.

“The few of us are enough to kill that black-robed man. The key question now is whether he will appear.”

“Martial Saint weapon... that’s not a small matter.”

Xia Hang said coldly, “You guys don’t know how terrifying this black-robed man is!”

“How terrifying can he be? Do you think he can defeat the eight of us?” Someone sneered.

“Vice President Xia, don’t tell me you think the risk level of this black-robed man is the same as Qin Yu’s?”

“Although the strength of this black-robed man is far above Qin Yu’s, the risk level is far lower than Qin Yu’s.”

“After all, Qin Yu is too young. We are worried about his future growth, but this black-robed man has clearly reached a bottleneck. He can’t pose much of a threat to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Xia Hang slammed the table and stood up. He opened his mouth and was about to say that Qin Yu was the black-robed man.

But in the end, Xia Hang held back.

He took a deep breath and said, “In any case, I will apply. Please do your jobs well.”

The few of them snorted and didn’t say anything. They turned around and walked out.

Xia Hang took a deep breath, with his expression gloomy and uncertain.

To Xia Hang, this was a gamble. Qin Yu must die!

If he didn’t die, then his daughter would be in danger! Therefore, there must not be any accidents!

Thus, Xia Hang immediately got up and went to Qu Xie’s office, and stated his purpose for coming.

After Qu Xie heard it, he couldn’t help but sneer. “Xia Hang, are you crazy? Using the Martial Saint’s weapon? What are you thinking about? Do you know what using the Martial Saint’s weapon means?”

Xia Hang said anxiously, “President Qu, only by using a Martial Saint weapon can we guarantee to kill him! I...”

“Shut up!” Qu Xie shouted sternly and interrupted Xia Hang.

“Xia Hang, it’s already my limit that I can give you the authority to use the black-gold robe powerhouse! You still want the Martial Saint weapon?”

“If you run away with the Martial Saint weapon, who will be responsible? Do you know what a Martial Saint weapon means?”

Xia Hang gritted his teeth. He had an impulse to tell Qu Xie that Qin Yu was the black-robed man.

But in the end, Xia Hang gave up on this idea.

Xia Hang didn’t know Qin Yu’s methods at all. He was very afraid that after he exposed Qin Yu’s identity, the pill would automatically take effect.

“Xia Hang, you have to handle this well for me, understand?” Qu Xie said coldly.

Xia Hang nodded and said in a low voice, “President Qu, I understand...”

After leaving the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Xia Hang began to arrange the relevant work.

They had specially set up an academy, and this academy was used to activate the bloodline.

Originally, this academy was going to be put on the agenda very soon, but because Qin Yu had crashed the auction, this matter was put off again and again.

“As long as we release the news about this academy, Qin Yu will definitely come.” Xia Hang took a deep breath.

They had set up an inescapable net near the academy. As long as Qin Yu dared to appear, even if he had wings, he wouldn’t be able to escape!

At this moment, Qin Yu was putting away his bedding and preparing to change places.

He put on his hat and left Jingdu that day to head straight for Qinghe town.

At night, Qin Yu held his breath and carefully walked into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

The reason he came to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was to hand over the rainbow glass to the Pavilion Master.

Qin Yu’s body was as light as a swallow as he arrived at the Pavilion Master’s building.

It was completely silent upstairs. The two apprentice alchemists who were serving the Pavilion Master had already fallen asleep.

At a glance, a large antique bed came into view.

A white curtain was wrapped around the large bed. The gentle breeze caused the white curtain to sway slightly.

Qin Yu walked straight to the side of the bed. He opened his mouth and was about to speak when he saw a scene that he shouldn’t have seen.

He saw the Pavilion Master lying on the bed. She was naked and her fair body was clearly visible.

Even though she wasn’t young, her body was like that of a young girl. Her skin was smooth and her hands were soft.

Qin Yu’s face turned red. He quickly turned his face to the side and said softly, “Lord... Lord Pavilion Master...”

Although Qin Yu’s voice was very soft, it still woke the Pavilion Master up!

She opened her eyes and frowned slightly. Her expression wasn’t pleasant!

But even so, the Pavilion Master still didn’t say anything. After all, she knew that Qin Yu couldn’t be seen in public.

Hence, the Pavilion Master waved her hand, and a long robe draped over her body.

“What did you see?” The Pavilion Master said coldly.

Qin Yu hurriedly waved her hand and said, “I didn’t see anything...”

The Pavilion Master frowned. She glanced at the medicine boys outside and then waved her hand. A stream of internal qi landed on the faces of the two of them.

The two of them immediately fell into a deep sleep.

“Pavilion Master, I... I really didn’t see anything... The main thing is that I didn’t expect you to sleep naked...” Qin Yu said guiltily.

The Pavilion Master’s expression turned cold and said coldly, “Don’t mention this topic again!”

Qin Yu hurriedly covered his mouth and nodded.

“Follow me.” The Pavilion Master stood up and turned around to walk towards a secret room.

The Pavilion Master waved her hand and a secret room appeared in front of the two of them.

“Go in.” The Pavilion Master said.

Qin Yu was the first to step in. The first thing that entered his sight was a huge tea table. Other than that, there were also many paintings and calligraphy hanging on it.

“During this period of time, you can hide here. No one will think that you are here.” The Pavilion Master said.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Pavilion Master, you have misunderstood. I am not here for refuge.”

The Pavilion Master asked doubtfully, “Then why are you here?”

Qin Yu took out the rainbow-colored glazed tile.

He placed the rainbow-colored glazed tile on the table and said, “I am here to give you this.”

Looking at the rainbow-colored glazed tile in front of her, the Pavilion Master sighed slightly and said, “That black-robed man... is indeed you.”

Although she had long guessed it, she still had some doubts in her heart. Now, she had completely confirmed Qin Yu’s identity.

“Qin Yu, do you know that you have caused trouble?” The Pavilion Master said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I know, but I have no other choice.”

The Pavilion Master narrowed her eyes and said, “Then do you know that the people who want to capture you now isn’t only the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?! The authorities have also issued a warrant for your arrest!”
