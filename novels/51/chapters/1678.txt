Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately slapped his face.

“It’s not an illusion.”Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Zhuo Jing was stunned and hurriedly sat up from the ground.

“You... didn’t die? !”Zhuo Jing said in surprise.

“Of course not. I’m blessed and have a long life. I still have to prove my dao. How could I Die Here?”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Zhuo Jing had mixed feelings for a moment. He looked at the huge Dragon Eye that Qin Yu was holding up and frowned. “What is that thing?”

“The eye of the Dragon Corpse.”Qin Yu did not hide anything.

“You... you locked its eye? !”Zhuo Jing was instantly even more confused.

Qin Yu acknowledged and told Zhuo Jing the whole story.

Zhuo Jing was stunned and couldn’t help but give Qin Yu a thumbs up.

“Alright, now is not the time to talk about that. We have to leave this place as soon as possible,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“This dragon burial cave is definitely not as simple as what we saw. I even suspect that we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.”

If news of the true saints that had been born were to spread, the entire holy region would probably be shocked.

“There are those things blocking the road outside. How Do We Go?”Zhuo Jing asked with a frown.

Qin Yu pointed at his raised eyeball and said, “We’ll rely on it.”

“Rely on it? Will it work?”Zhuo Jing asked with a frown.

“It should. This thing can even suppress a true saint, let alone those beasts,”Qin Yu said.

Thus, Qin Yu helped Zhuo Jing up with one hand, and then the two of them walked out of the dragon burial cave.

Walking in the desert, the two of them walked with heavy footsteps.

They looked around, afraid that they might be ambushed by the bugs.

In a moment, a large group of bugs suddenly appeared.

At a glance, they almost covered the entire desert, and there was no border!

Qin Yu frowned and said coldly, “What on Earth is this thing...”

“I don’t know.”Zhuo Jing shook his head.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He raised his eyeballs and walked forward step by step.

Those insects looked at Qin Yu coldly. When Qin Yu walked to his side, they consciously made way for him.

Sure enough, these insects were very afraid of the dragon eyes in Qin Yu’s hands!

“It’s done.”Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and said with a smile.

Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but sigh in relief. He patted his chest and said, “Then let’s go quickly.”

The two of them didn’t dare to say anything and directly summoned the Divine Hawk.

Sitting on the back of the Divine Hawk, they leaned over and looked at the densely packed bugs below.

After Qin Yu left, those bugs also began to slowly disappear without any signs.

“Could it be that the eyes I sensed in the dark earlier were those bugs?”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Before he finished his sentence, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

“No! It’s not them!”Qin Yu shouted in shock.

After those insects disappeared, Qin Yu still sensed something strange!

A pair of cold eyes seemed to be looking at Qin Yu coldly from the dark.

But when Qin Yu turned around, he couldn’t see anything.

“Strange...”Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

Ever since he came to the east barren, that look had been following him.

Qin Yu did not know where that look came from, let alone who the person hiding in the Dark Was.

“Maybe he disappeared after he left the east barren,”Zhuo Jing said from the side.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I hope so.”

The two of them rode on the godly eagle and did not dare to stay for even a moment.

After Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing left, the dragon burial cave slowly disappeared again. Everything returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.

The two of them rode on the Divine Eagle and flew across the sky.

A few days later, they finally walked out of the east barren.

However, when they walked out of the east barren, their divine sense suddenly trembled. In that moment, it was as if they had been struck by lightning!

“What’s going on...”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Zhuo Jing also said in surprise, “Do you have the same feeling?”

Qin Yu’s expression immediately became even uglier!

The two of them had the same feeling, which meant that the reason for the tremble just now was from the East continent!

“What secret is East Continent Hiding?”Qin Yu frowned tightly.

“It’s a curse.”

At this moment, the mysterious man appeared again!

“A curse? !”Qin Yu was stunned. He jumped and arrived in front of the mysterious man.

“What’s going on? What do you mean?”Qin Yu said coldly.

The mysterious man sneered, “It’s the curse of East Barren. As for what it means, you can go yourself.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Who are you? Why do you keep appearing?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

“You don’t need to know. You’ve already entered the East Continent. It’s useless to tell you more,”the mysterious man said.

He put his hands behind his back and smiled faintly, “The east continent is not something you can touch. You will definitely pay the price for this.”

After saying this, he turned around and left.

Although Qin Yu had many doubts in his heart, he did not chase after him.

Because he knew that with his speed, he couldn’t catch up with him.

“Curse...”Zhuo Jing whispered behind him.

As if he suddenly remembered something, he asked in surprise, “Did my father die because of the curse?”

Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and said coldly, “Let’s go to the Tianyun sect.”

The two of them didn’t waste any time and immediately rushed to the Tianyun sect!

The eastern wilderness was quite far from the Tianyun sect. Even with the Divine Eagle, it would still take several days.

After eight days, the two of them finally arrived near the Tianyun sect.

Qin Yu withdrew his figure and then looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Are you waiting for me here or are you coming with me?”

“Let’s go together. This matter doesn’t only concern you and me, but also my father,”Zhuo Jing said coldly.

Qin Yu grunted and then quickly walked into the heavenly cloud sect.

They passed through the Heavenly Cloud sect and arrived at the foot of the Cultivation Mountain.

Standing at the foot of the Cultivation Mountain, qin yu shouted, “Qin Yu requests to see you!”

A loud shout shook the entire Heavenly Cloud sect!

But this time, they didn’t open up a small path like last time. On the contrary, the cultivation mountain didn’t have any reaction.

Qin Yu shouted again, “Qin Yu requests an audience!”

However, the result was the same. No one paid any attention to Qin Yu.

At this moment, the deputy sect master hurried over from not far away.

“Qin Yu? Why are you here?”The deputy sect master asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu did not answer this question. Instead, he asked, “Where is the sect master? I have something important to look for him.”

“The sect master went out a few days ago,”the deputy sect master said.

“Went out?”Qin Yu frowned, and his heart immediately became more uneasy.

“When will he come back?”Qin Yu asked.

The deputy sect master smiled and said, “How can I understand the sect master’s itinerary? Besides, the sect master has always liked to travel around the world. No one knows when he will come back.”
