Chapter 1371: Chapter 1,371: the enraged Ding Jie 1

Qin Yu took Wen Dawen er to many places in succession.

No matter which city they arrived at, Qin Yu would always go to the places where there were many treasures to search for life qi.

Unfortunately, he returned empty-handed every time.

The scarcity of life Qi was beyond imagination.

On this day, Qin Yu and the two of them arrived at a city.

This city was called Kingstown, and it was a rather ordinary city. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu brought Wen Da and Wen da into Kingstown and found a place to stay for the time being.

“Sigh, how long will I have to live like this?”Wen Da couldn’t help but sigh.

Qin Yu was also a bit depressed. The days of escaping were not easy.

If they couldn’t find the life qi, they would be caught sooner or later.

The scarcity of life force is beyond imagination. If I can’t find it, I have to go to Yang City again, Qin Yu thought.

As far as Qin Yu knew, only Yang City and Qingyan Forest had life force.

Although these two places were full of danger, Qin Yu had no other way.

“What?”

At this moment, Wen da suddenly frowned.

“What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Wen Da said in a low voice, “It seems that someone is coming.”

“I feel it too.”Wen Er nodded.

As he spoke, a figure appeared outside Qin Yu’s window.

This person had his hands behind his back and was looking at Qin Yu coldly.

“Qin Yu, I Found You.”The other party sneered.

The person who came was none other than Ding Jie, who had been tracking Qin Yu.

Qin Yu stood up from the floor. He looked coldly at Ding Jie outside the window and said, “Someone from the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

Ding jie sneered and said, “What do you think? Qin Yu, you have nowhere to hide. Surrender!”

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes slightly and said, “That depends on whether you have the ability or not.”

With that, Qin Yu looked at Wen Dawen er and said, “The two of you stay here and don’t move. I’ll be right back.”

After saying that, Qin Yu leaped and shot toward Ding Jie!

However, Ding Jie was extremely cunning. He did not fight head-on with Qin Yu. Instead, he relied on his extremely fast speed to quickly pull away.

He put his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, I know that I’m not your opponent, so I won’t fight with you. I only need to defend you.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

It had to be said that Ding Jie’s actions were indeed a headache for Qin Yu. It was also what he was most worried about.

Qin Yu tried to give chase, but Ding Jie once again pulled away and refused to let Qin Yu touch him.

Qin Yu lost her patience after running away repeatedly.

He looked at Ding Jie coldly and said, “Are you a man? If you have the ability, then fight me.”

“Hehe, Qin Yu, I’m not a reckless person like Ling Yun. Your provocation is useless against me,”Ding Jie said as he pointed at his own head.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and unleashed all of his divine power towards Ding Jie.

However, no matter how hard Qin Yu tried, she was unable to touch Ding Jie.

“F * ck!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

He pointed at Ding Jie and cursed, “I don’t care about you anymore. If you have the ability, just follow him!”

Ding Jie smiled faintly and said, “Don’t worry, I will.”

Qin Yu knew that she couldn’t catch up with Ding Jie, so she didn’t do anything useless. She turned around and returned to her residence, ignoring Ding Jie.

Ding Jie also kept his word. No matter where Qin Yu went, he would follow closely.

“No, if this goes on, the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely arrive soon,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice as she sat in the room.

“Damn it, this competition is so F * cking Shameless!”Wen Da couldn’t help but curse.

He pushed open the window and cursed at Ding Jie who was outside.

“Why are you still chasing after her? Your Wife is already cheating on you at home. Why Don’t you go back and take a look?”

“You are so loyal to the Heavenly Cloud sect. Did you let them play with your wife?”

Wen da exclaimed, “Really? His wife really gave it to the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“It’s true. I heard it with my own ears during the last myriad sect meeting!”Wen Er said with a serious face.

The two brothers echoed each other, making Ding Jie’s face turn ashen and extremely angry.

Qin Yu, who was observing from the side, seemed to have noticed something as well.

Ding Jie seemed to place great importance on the Heavenly Cloud sect and his wife. Once his wife and the Heavenly Cloud sect were involved, his expression would turn extremely ugly.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately joined the camp.

The three of them leaned against the window and scolded Ding Jie incessantly.

“No wonder your wife cuckolded you. Who would be able to stand such a cowardly man like you?”

“You only know how to peek outside every day. You also hid outside when your wife put a hat on you, didn’t you?”

The three of them almost brought out all the dirty words they had used in their lives. All kinds of unbearable words kept coming out.

After an hour, Ding Jie finally couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He glared at the three of them and said through gritted teeth, “Qin Yu, don’t think that I’m really afraid of You!”

“I don’t know if you’re afraid of me or not. Your Wife Likes Me a lot anyway,”Qin Yu grinned and said.

“You’re courting death!”Ding Jie couldn’t hold it in anymore.

After he shouted, his anger reached its peak.

“If I don’t kill all of you today, I, Ding Jie, will write the two words upside down!”
