“Impossible, Qin Yu would never harm my grandfather!” Yan Ruoxue’s tone was filled with determination.

“Hehe, if it wasn’t him, why is Father lying on the bed?” Yan Sihai sneered.

“Sihai, let’s send Father to the hospital first,” Yan Yongxiu suggested.

“Yes, send Father to the hospital quickly!” The others also said.

At this time, Yan Ruoxue suddenly thought of something.

She looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, don’t you have superb medical skills? You... Hurry up and save my grandfather.”

Qin Yu sighed and said with some guilt, “Ruoxue, I’m sorry. I... I’m afraid there’s nothing I can do.”

“Is there nothing you can do, or you don’t want to save him?” Yan Sihai said with a sneer.

“Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Hurry up and send Father to the hospital,” said Yan Yongxiu.

Yan Sihai glanced at Qin Yu and said, “I’ll settle the score with you when I come back!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He wanted to go to the hospital with him, but was rejected by Yan Sihai.

As he was sitting on the sofa, Qin Yu’s expression was a little heavy.

He had never encountered Old Mister Yan’s situation before.

Even if it was the end of his life, it was impossible for him to have no reaction at all.

He sat on the sofa with his mind racing as he tried to find a way to save Old Mister Yan.

At this moment, Old Mister Yan was being resuscitated in the hospital.

Only half an hour later, the doctor walked out of the emergency room.

“Doctor, how is he?” Yan Ruoxue asked hurriedly.

The doctor took off his mask and shook his head. “Miss Yan, I’m sorry. Old Mister Yan’s vital signs have already declined. There’s nothing we can do about it.”

“How can this be?! He was clearly fine yesterday!” Yan Ruoxue suddenly had a breakdown.

She had never thought that Old Mister Yan would leave her one day.

Standing in the corridor of the hospital, Yan Ruoxue seemed to be at a loss. Tears flowed down her fair cheeks.

“Doctor, how long can my father live?” Yan Yongxiu asked in a deep voice.

The doctor sighed and said, “I’m afraid he won’t be able to last through today. You guys... better prepare for the funeral.”

Yan Ruoxue completely lost it.

Her vision went black and she fainted.

...

At night, Old Mister Yan was brought home.

He was lying on the bed and there were no signs of life in him.

Yan Ruoxue squatted beside Old Mister Yan.

She grabbed Old Mister Yan’s old palm and murmured softly, as if she was reminiscing about the past.

At this moment, Qin Yu pushed the door open and walked in.

He walked to Yan Ruoxue’s side and gently hugged Yan Ruoxue from behind.

Yan Ruoxue’s face was already covered in tears.

When Qin Yu saw it, he felt his heart ache.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt something was amiss.

His pupils suddenly dilated and he stared at the spot between Old Mister Yan’s brows. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He saw a faint light between Old Mister Yan’s brows.

Although this light was weak, it was obvious.

“This... this is divine sense?” Qin Yu immediately understood.

He hurriedly raised his palm and placed it on Old Mister Yan’s forehead to feel Old Mister Yan’s divine sense.

Sure enough, Old Mister Yan’s divine sense hadn’t dissipated!

“No, there’s definitely something wrong!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“If he is at the end of his life, his divine sense will disappear with him.”

“And now, Old Mister Yan’s divine sense hasn’t disappeared at all. It’s just the signs of his life disappearing...”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu suddenly felt a little excited.

He grabbed Yan Ruoxue’s hand and said, “Ruoxue, I have a way to save Old Mister Yan.”

Yan Ruoxue’s dim eyes instantly lit up.

“You... is what you said true?” Yan Ruoxue asked anxiously.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Absolutely true! But... I have to take Old Mister Yan’s corpse and leave.”

As long as his divine sense wasn’t gone, Qin Yu could use the formation of the Earth Fiend Valley to resurrect Old Mister Yan!

Of course, this also required a body and the Resurrection Formation set up by the Earth Fiend Valley!

That formation was far in the southwest. Qin Yu had to take Old Mister Yan’s body and leave!

“Take my father’s corpse and leave? What exactly are you thinking?” At this moment, Yan Sihai walked in from outside the door.

He sneered. “You killed him, and you even want him to be unable to rest in peace?”

Qin Yu slowly stood up. He took a deep breath and said, “Old Mister Yan, I’m not joking with you. I really have a way to resurrect Old Mister Yan.”

“Nonsense! How can a dead person be resurrected?!” Yan Sihai snorted.

Qin Yu explained, “Normally, a person can’t be resurrected after death, but Old Mister Yan’s divine sense hasn’t been extinguished, so I have a way!”

“Oh? Tell me, what solution do you have?” Yan Sihai raised his eyebrows and said.

“I don’t know if you’ve heard of the Earth Fiend Valley’s Resurrection Formation,” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

“Resurrection Formation?” Yan Sihai found it somewhat familiar.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, a friend of mine was resurrected with this formation.”

“The only drawback of this formation is that his appearance will change and he will need to find a new body.”

Yan Sihai had indeed heard of the Earth Fiend Valley’s Resurrection Formation, but he had waited for Old Mister Yan to pass away for so long. How could he let Qin Yu resurrect him?

“Nonsense. I will never let you take my Father’s corpse away!” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Old Mister Yan, I think you don’t want Old Mister Yan to be resurrected, right? If he is resurrected, then your plan will fall through, right?”

Yan Sihai’s expression immediately changed. He angrily shouted, “Bullsh * t! Nonsense!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Then why don’t you agree for me to activate the Resurrection Array to extend Old Mister Yan’s life?”

Yan Sihai snorted and said, “Because I don’t believe in you. I also don’t believe in some bullsh*t Resurrection Array!”

“Sihai, I have indeed heard of the Resurrection Array.” Yan Yongxiu frowned and said.

“Father has already passed away. Why don’t we let Qin Yu give it a try?”

“Yeah, maybe Qin Yu really has a way,” the others also said.

Yan Sihai frowned.

If he continued to refuse, he might really arouse suspicion.

Just when Yan Sihai was at a loss, he suddenly thought of something.

Then, Yan Sihai’s expression slowly relaxed.

He said indifferently, “Alright, I’ll agree to it.”

Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief. He cupped his hands and said, “Thank you for your trust, Mr. Yan.”

Yan Sihai didn’t stay any longer. He turned and left the Yan family manor.

He returned to his own residence.

In the study, Yan Sihai was smoking a cigar. Beside him stood an old man.

This old man was Yan Sihai’s number one military advisor.

“Mr. Yan, why did you agree to Qin Yu resurrecting Old Mister Yan?” The military advisor asked in confusion.

Yan Sihai snorted, “If I continue to refuse, wouldn’t it be too obvious? By then, who would submit to me?”

The military advisor frowned, “But... if Old Mister Yan resurrects, who knows how many more years you will have to push the matter of you being the head of the family.”

Yan Sihai sneered and said, “Let’s not talk about whether he can resurrect my Father first. So what if he is resurrected?”

“He has changed his body, changed his appearance, and even changed his voice.”

“What right does a stranger have to say that he is my father?”
