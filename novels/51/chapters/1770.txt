1771 A Special Legacy Technique

After three days, the sky finally regained its peace.

Wen Wanchong took the lead and rushed to the top of Dayue Mountain, while Qin Yu and Qu Zhu stayed where they were.

A few minutes later, Jue Wu brought Wen Wanchong down the mountain.

Jue Wu ran to Qin Yu happily and said, “Well, you look a lot better now. You’re quite powerful.”

!!

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said, “I’m just holding on. How do you feel?”

Jue Wu said excitedly, “I am fine. I am totally fine!”

“In a few days, I’ll take you to Zhongzhou!” Jue Wu said with a serious face.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then shook his head and said, “There’s no need for that. You should stay in Nanzhou and cultivate. With your talent, you don’t need to take this risk.”

With the Nirvana Body, she could be cultivated by eating, drinking and having fun, so Jue Wu didn’t need to go to Zhongzhou.

But Jue Wu stubbornly said, “I have the final say! Don’t argue with me, or I’ll beat you up!”

Qin Yu couldn’t force her, so he could only nod with a smile.

In the next few days, Qin Yu was still trying his best to get used to the pain.

He couldn’t place all his bets on one person, not to mention that Xiaoqian might not be reliable.

After a few days, Qin Yu was able to try to mobilize the spiritual power in his body.

Although the power he could mobilize was less than one-tenth of his peak power, it was already incredible that he could co-exist with the pain of his primordial spirit to this extent.

A few more days passed, and there were only three days left before the appointment with Xiaoqian.

Qin Yu looked into the distance and began to feel a little uneasy.

This matter was too important to Qin Yu. The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Alas.”

Qin Yu heaved a long sigh. He gritted his teeth and tried to mobilize the internal qi in his body again.

Just then, Wen Da ran up from the foot of the mountain.

He said excitedly, “You’re good, Qin Yu. You’ve brought them home, right? You are such a casanova!”

Qin Yu asked hurriedly, “What do you mean?” Who did I bring here?”

Wen Da muttered, “Don’t play the fool. It’s the two girls from the brothel a few days ago.”

“How charming you are! It’s only been a few days, and they actually come here for you.”

Qin Yu did not want to listen to Wen Da’s nonsense. He ignored the pain and rushed down the mountain.

Xiaoqian and Wanru were waiting for Qin Yu in the guest room of the palace in Dayue Mountain.

However, Wen Wanchong had always looked down on this kind of woman, so the hospitality was extremely poor. Wen Wanchong almost completely ignored the two of them.

When Qin Yu arrived, there was no more water in the teacup. The two of them just sat there.

Qin Yu walked up to them awkwardly and said apologetically, “I’m really sorry to have made you wait for so long. Please forgive me.”

Xiaoqian glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Well, good for you. Even though you’re so anxious, you still don’t forget your manners. You’re not quite the same as them.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. Then, he asked Wen Da to bring a pot of water and filled the cups for the two of them.

Qin Yu asked, “How is it? Any news?”

Xiaoqian said, “Yeah. I’ve already asked my friend to go to Juxian Restaurant. But I have to warn you that once you deal with people like us, your hands will get dirty and you will never be able to clear your name.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He took a deep breath and said, “It doesn’t matter,”

Xiaoqian stood up and said, “Alright, let’s not waste any more time. Let’s go.”

Qin Yu nodded and followed Xiaoqian out.

As soon as they went out, Wen Wanchong stopped them.

He pulled Qin Yu aside and said in a deep voice, “These people are not good people. Qin Yu, you have to be careful.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I know it, master.”

After that, Qin Yu followed Xiaoqian to Juxian Restaurant.

When the three of them arrived at the room, a woman in black was already waiting for them.

Her body was covered with a faint fragrance.

The fragrance was so alluring that no one could ignore it.

However, in addition to this fragrance, her internal qi from her body made people feel a little uncomfortable.

Xiaoqian called out, “Sister Ning.”

The person called Sister Ning nodded, then she looked at Qin Yu.

“You’re Qin Yu?” Sister Ning looked at Qin Yu from head to toe.

Qin Yu then said. “Yeah, Sister Ning.”

Sister Ning didn’t try to hide anything. She said directly, “I can teach you the technique, but I have to tell you that once you learn it, you will have something to do with our sect.”

Qin Yu asked, “What sect?”

“The Satan,” Sister Ning replied indifferently.

As soon as she said that, Qin Yu’s expression became a little strange.

Qin Yu, who had come from the earth, was naturally familiar with Satan.

Now that he heard the name of such a sect, he naturally had an indescribable feeling.

Qin Yu muttered the name and asked “Well, Satan. What does your sect have to do with the real Satan?”

“What?” Sister Ning was kind of stunned. She didn’t seem to understand Qin Yu’s words.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Well, nothing.”

Sister Ning nodded and did not ask further. She continued, “Then you’d better consider it carefully.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. At this moment, he was still in a dilemma.

It was definitely not a good thing to have a relationship with Satan.

However, every time Qin Yu hesitated, he thought of the chaotic body in Zhongzhou.

“Alright.” Thinking of that, Qin Yu gritted his teeth and agreed.

“Then you can come with me,” Sister Ning said as she stood up.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time. He followed Sister Ning to a deserted place.

Xiaoqian and Wanru were waiting in the distance, while Sister Ning began to teach Qin Yu.

This technique was extremely simple. With Qin Yu’s ability, it was very easy for him to learn it.

At the last moment, Sister Ning raised her finger and placed it between Qin Yu’s eyebrows.

All of a sudden, Qin Yu only felt a light flash through his mind.

The light disappeared in a flash. When Qin Yu tried to look for it again, it disappeared without a trace. It was as if everything was just an illusion.

Sister Ning stood up and said, “It’s done.”

“In the future, you only need to devour the primordial spirits of others.”

Qin Yu had mixed feelings. For some reason, he had a bad feeling. He didn’t even know if today’s decision was right or wrong.

“Many thanks.” Qin Yu bowed slightly to Sister Ning.

Sister Ning said indifferently, “You don’t have to thank me. I only hope that you won’t hate me in the future.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and wanted to ask something, but he gave up in the end.

There was no turning back now.
