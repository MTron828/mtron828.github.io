Yan Jinyao’s face was filled with provocation and schadenfreude.

Seeing his expression, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “Yan Jinyao, I remember the first time I met you. You were a handsome young master with a gentlemanly demeanor.”

“At that time, I thought that you were worthy of being the crown prince of the Yan family.”

“But now, it seems that you are both sinister and wretched.”

Qin Yu shook his head helplessly, with disappointment written all over his face.

Yan Jinyao’s eyes narrowed slightly. He snorted coldly and said, “I don’t need you to determine how I am. But whether you can survive tomorrow is hard to say.”

After saying this, Yan Jinyao turned his head and left.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to lower himself to Yan Jinyao’s level.

His motive was impure. He said that he wanted his disciple to challenge Qin Yu, but he just wanted to take advantage of the situation.

If he fought with Blackie, regardless of the outcome, Qin Yu would definitely be injured.

At that time, Qin Yu might not be a match for Yan Jinyao’s disciple.

“Yan Jinyao is really cunning!” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “No worries.”

...

The next day.

Before Qin Yu woke up, there were two people waiting at the door.

After seeing Qin Yu, the two people strode over.

“Granny Qin told us to tell you that she will wait for you at Qinggang Mountain,” the two people said.

After saying that, they turned around and left without turning back.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said in a low voice, “Qinggang Mountain... is a good place to bury people.”

After going back and making some simple preparations, Qin Yu rushed to Qinggang Mountain with Xiao Yu and the man with the mustache.

At this moment, the vicinity of Qinggang Mountain was already filled with people.

These people came from all over the world. They had all heard the news and came to watch the battle.

As for the people from the martial arts academy, they had already gathered here early on, waiting for this long-drawn-out battle.

In the crowd.

A young man’s face was full of anger. Looking at the scene in front of him, he couldn’t help but clench his fists.

This young man was none other than Han Wei.

“How did he get to where he is today...” Han Wei clenched his teeth.

Unknowingly, he had completely distanced himself from Qin Yu.

“Young Master Han, there’s no need to be angry. People like Qin Yu will appear every once in a while, but most of them won’t have a good ending,” the attendant at the side comforted him.

Han Wei didn’t say anything, but he was extremely angry.

Ever since he lost to Qin Yu, Han Wei hadn’t been able to recover.

Even though he cultivated with all his might, his speed was extremely slow.

He, who was once in the top ten of the rankings, had long disappeared.

“Look, Blackie has appeared!” At this moment, someone in the crowd suddenly exclaimed.

Looking over, they saw Blackie standing on the peak of Mount Qinggang.

He was dressed in black, and his clothes fluttered in the breeze.

“What a powerful internal qi!”

Even though they were far away, there were still people who were boasting.

“You really know how to suck up. From so far away there’s no way you can feel it,” someone sneered. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“You don’t understand. The internal qi that he gives off goes straight to the bottom of my heart.”

“Go ahead and brag. If you brag well, maybe you’ll be rewarded with a bone.”

“Who are you scolding?”

“Whoever I’m scolding knows!”

Before Qin Yu and Blackie could fight, the spectators below started arguing.

“Qin Yu is here!”

At this moment, someone shouted and everyone immediately looked over.

They saw Qin Yu, the man with the mustache, and Xiao Yu getting out of a taxi.

Compared to Blackie, who was showing off at the top of the mountain, Qin Yu looked much more down-to-earth.

He was wearing an ordinary sportswear and didn’t look like a big shot.

“Look, compared to Blackie, isn’t Qin Yu’s internal qi far inferior?”

“Bullsh*t, you judge people through their clothes?”

“If you don’t know how to speak, then close your anus!”

“Blackie is much more handsome than that Qin Yu. Blackie will definitely win!”

“Looks determine the outcome?”

“Looks are everything!”

The crowd seemed to be divided into two factions.

Those who supported Blackie and those who supported Qin Yu were in a heated argument.

“There are so many people.” Looking at the sea of people in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Obviously, Granny Qin had spread the news on purpose.

Her purpose was to let more people come to watch.

“It seems that Granny Qin is quite confident.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

It seemed that Blackie really had some extraordinary trump card.

“You’re finally here.”

At this moment, Granny Qin walked over to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at her and sneered. “Old b*stard, if I didn’t come, how would I kill your babe?”

“Little b*stard, how dare you say such arrogant words when you’re about to die?!” Granny Qin’s old face was full of anger.

Qin Yu sneered. “Let it jump down from the mountain. Why is he still standing there and posing?”

Granny Qin glanced at Blackie, who was on the mountain top, and said with a faint smile, “Blackie is destined to stand on the mountain top, and you are his stepping stone!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

He clenched his hand and a golden light appeared!

Then, Qin Yu suddenly threw a punch in Blackie’s direction!

The terrifying golden light instantly covered the sky and the earth!

“He made a move!” Someone shouted excitedly!

“Boom!”

The golden light fiercely smashed onto the peak of the mountain!

“Rumble...”

The huge force directly shattered the peak of the mountain!

Blackie also jumped down.

“Old b*stard, it seems that the mountain peak you mentioned is extremely fragile,” Qin Yu mocked.

Granny Qin gritted her teeth. She knew that she wouldn’t be able to gain any advantage, so she didn’t say anything more.

“Qin Yu! I have been waiting for you for a long time!” At this moment, Blackie suddenly shouted!

This voice contained inner strength, and it rolled over, causing eardrums to hurt.

Qin Yu looked at Blackie coldly, then walked towards Blackie.

“Qin Yu, be careful.” Xiao Yu pulled Qin Yu and said softly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. Killing him is like squashing an ant.”

After saying this, Qin Yu’s feet shook, and his body rose into the air.

In almost an instant, Qin Yu arrived in front of Blackie.

Their eyes met, and there was only a distance of less than ten meters between the two of them.

Although neither of them made a move, their internal qi was colliding in the dark.

Crack!

The ground under their feet seemed to be unable to withstand it anymore, and at this moment, dense cracks appeared!

A gust of whirlwind suddenly rose between the two of them!

“I’ve finally waited for this day,” Blackie said with a cold look.

Qin Yu sneered. “I admire your spirit of facing death with ease.”

“You talk too much nonsense!” Blackie shouted. His body shook and his black robe was instantly shattered!

Then, Blackie’s dark fist smashed towards Qin Yu!
