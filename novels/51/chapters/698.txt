Chapter 699: Han Xiu’s Arrival! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

That crossbow was not simple.

The light that hit Qu Xie’s glabella seemed to have come from this crossbow.

“That seems to be a magical artifact,” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice.

“No matter what he is, as long as Burly and Robust are still around, he can’t do anything to me,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“It’s indeed lively.”

At this moment, someone else joined the battle.

Turning around, he saw a man wearing a black mink coat.

This man had a burly figure and a full beard on his mouth. He looked extremely strong.

“Han Xiu? The Eldest Young Master of the Han family had come personally!” someone exclaimed!

Hearing this name, Qin Yu frowned.

Han Xiu? Han Meng’s brother? He actually participated in this?

Two peak Martial Marquis. This was practically the most powerful force Qin Yu had ever encountered.

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

This was no longer a matter of one person.

Due to Qin Yu’s sudden appearance, everyone in the Taoism Theory Library was implicated.

Ao Zhan wanted to kill everyone so that he could achieve his goal of sealing the news!

Qin Yu looked around and found out that the surrounding had been sealed by Ao Zhan through a secret technique.

Some had wanted to escape but they had been blocked by a barrier.

Ao Zhan sneered, “Don’t waste your energy. This space has been sealed. No one can escape.

“Before I kill all of you, even I can’t get out,” Ao Zhan said indifferently while playing with his crossbow.

Hearing this, everyone at the scene instantly panicked!

They all looked toward Qin Yu for help. Qin Yu in front of them had surprisingly become their savior.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Without saying anything, he immediately controlled Burly to clench his fist and fly up!

The huge fist instantly smashed towards the barrier on one side!

A terrifying power instantly poured out!

Under this punch, dense cracks instantly appeared on the barrier. It then directly exploded! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The crashing sound could be heard continuously, and the spatial barrier disappeared in an instant!

“Hurry up and leave!” Qin Yu swept his gaze towards the crowd and said coldly.

These people naturally wouldn’t miss this opportunity, and they desperately ran to escape.

When Ao Zhan saw this, he couldn’t help but frown.

“What a powerful force,” a trace of solemnity flashed across Ao Zhan’s face.

Then, he held the crossbow in his hand and shot toward Burly!

In an instant, a ray of light shot out from the crossbow!

This ray of light was formed from pure inner strength. Its power was extremely terrifying. Not only could it instantly shatter the body, but it could even wipe out the divine sense!

Burly did not panic. He casually raised his hand and grabbed that light.

Then, he lightly exerted force with his hand and directly shattered this light!

“How is that possible!”Ao Zhan’s expression instantly changed!

Han Xiu, who was at the side, lightly snorted and said, “It seems that your master did not tell you that those were two corpses from several years ago. When they were alive, their cultivation was unfathomable.”

Ao Zhan frowned and said in a low voice, “Corpses? Could they be the corpses of the Martial Saint?”

Han Xiu stretched lazily and said, “More or less.”

After becoming a Martial Marquis, the gap between each stage would grow bigger and bigger! It was simply impossible to make up for!

From ancient times until now, no one in history could ever defeat a Martial Saint at the level of a Martial Marquis. In fact, no Martial Marquis had ever dared to provoke a Martial Saint!

“If it’s a Martial Saint’s body, it’s indeed not easy to deal with,” Ao Zhan frowned slightly.

In front of him, Qin Yu did not make a sound. His eyes narrowed slightly.

He sized up the two people in front of him and clenched his fists.

“Burly and Robust don’t have much time left. I must kill these two people before this,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu did not waste any more time.

He used his divine sense to urge Burly and Robust to walk towards Ao Zhan!

However, at this moment, an accident happened!

Qin Yu only felt that the connection between him and the two corpses was getting weaker and weaker! It seemed like it was going to disappear at any time!

“Oh no!” Qin Yu thought to himself! Time was actually up at this time!

The connection became weaker and weaker. Qin Yu almost couldn’t feel the connection.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He tried his best to use his divine sense to maintain the connection with Burly.

Under Qin Yu’s great efforts, Burly and Robust didn’t collapse directly.

“Phew,” Qin Yu let out a sigh of relief.

With Burly’s and Robust’s current condition, it was probably impossible to rely on them to fight.?He could only use other methods.

Qin Yu swept his gaze towards Ao Zhan and Han Xiu and then said coldly, “Your guess is right. They are indeed two corpses.”

“But the only difference is that they are not the Martial Saint, but the Mighty Realm! They are even existences that have surpassed the Mighty Realm!”

Ao Zhan was stunned. A trace of panic flashed across his face.

“The corpses of the Mighty Realm? How is this possible! The Mighty Realm has long ceased to exist!” Ao Zhan said coldly.

Qin Yu mocked, “You’re truly ignorant. If you don’t believe me, go ahead and try to attack them!”

Ao Zhan’s brows were tightly knitted together, and his eye expression seemed to be somewhat conflicted.

Even though Ao Zhan didn’t believe that they were the bodies of the Mighty Realm, he still didn’t dare to act rashly!

What if they were really the bodies of the Mighty Realm? That was definitely not something he could fight against!

“I don’t believe it. So what if they are the bodies of the Mighty Realm? The person controlling it is only a Martial Marquis!” Ao Zhan gritted his teeth and grabbed the crossbow in his hand!

The crossbow was brewing with a dazzling light, and the blazing temperature instantly exploded!

In the next second, the light on the crossbow shot towards Burly!

Countless rays of light shot out from the crossbow like bullets!

For a moment, the crackling sound was incessant, and Burly just stood there without moving an inch!

This light, which was enough to wipe out the divine sense of a Martial Marquis, didn’t even leave a white mark on Burly’s body!

Ao Zhan’s expression instantly changed drastically! He subconsciously took two steps back and his forehead was sweating profusely!

“What a tough body. Even if it was a Martial Saint, it was impossible not to even leave a white mark!” Ao Zhan said in terror.

“These two bodies... I’m afraid they are really of the Mighty Realm!”

Ao Zhan was extremely flustered. He even had the intention to retreat.

Seeing this, Qin Yu also let out a slight sigh of relief in his heart.

As long as he could deceive this idiot, he would be able to think of a way to escape.

“What’s there to be afraid of? So what if they have the bodies of the Mighty Realm?”

At this moment, Han Xiu, who was at the side, couldn’t help but laugh.

Ao Zhan frowned and said, “Han Xiu, you should know better than me what this body of Mighty Realm means!”

Han Xiu snorted lightly and said, “No wonder those merchants don’t like martial artists like you guys. They don’t seem to be very bright.

“So what if it’s a body of the Mighty Realm? This Qin Yu obviously has lost his ability to control it. Otherwise, why would he stand here and talk nonsense with us? Wouldn’t it be more convenient to directly control his body and slap us to death?”
