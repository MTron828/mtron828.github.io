Chapter 1733: Crushing Pilgrimage City Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

They were wearing cold black armor, and no aura could be detected from their bodies. They were like killing machines.

From the powerful aura on their bodies, everyone could sense that they were extraordinary!

Such a scene shocked everyone!

Especially the two Chao brothers. Their expressions could not help but change.

They were unable to investigate the identity of this group of people, but they could still feel that this group of people was definitely not someone they could afford to offend!

At this moment, a young girl with her face covered walked out of the teleportation array.

Her figure was slender and beautiful. Even with her face covered, one could still see her natural beauty.

Chao Shou had a bad premonition. He quickly stepped forward, cupped his hands, and said, “May I know what business you have with Xihuang?”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t say a word and only glanced at him.

Soon, her eyes fell on Qin Yu.

When she saw Qin Yu lying like a dead dog, she couldn’t help but tremble!

Even though her face was covered, one could still see her expression at that moment!

Anger made Yan Ruoxue’s body emit an extremely cold aura.

She suppressed the anger in her heart and lifted all the restrictions on his body with a light tap of her finger.

Qin Yu lost his support and fell to the ground with a loud thud.

This made the already angry Yan Ruoxue even more furious!

She took a deep breath, then said coldly, “Kill them all, leave no one alive.”

These words were extremely cold, causing the expressions of the two Chao brothers to change greatly!

Chao Shou was even more puzzled as he said, “I don’t know how I’ve offended you, but why did you attack Pilgrimage City?”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t even want to pay attention to him and only gave her orders coldly.

At this moment, Chao Shou also knew that this group of people would definitely not show mercy. He shouted, “I have no enmity with you, aren’t you being too rude? I’m telling you, I, Chao Shou, am not to be trifled with!”

At this moment, the hundreds of armored soldiers moved.

In an instant, an extremely powerful aura burst out from their bodies!

A terrifying sense of oppression hit them in the face. Just this aura alone made the entire Pilgrimage City tremble!

Chao Shou’s expression changed drastically!

This aura was too powerful. It was not what they could resist at all!

“I… There must be some misunderstanding between us!” Chao Shou hurriedly knelt down and begged for mercy.

However, how could Yan Ruoxue be soft-hearted? with a wave of her Jade-like hand, the hundreds of armors moved!

In the face of these hundreds of armors, the so-called Return To Void stage cultivators were not even worth mentioning, let alone the people from Pilgrimage City.

In the blink of an eye, the entire Pilgrimage City was covered in corpses and blood flowed like a river!

They didn’t even have any room to resist and were killed with a raise of their hands!

The entire Pilgrimage City was destroyed in an instant!

The two Chao brothers’ expressions turned extremely ugly in an instant!

The strength of this group of people far exceeded their imagination!

Chao Shou didn’t dare to think too much. He knelt on the ground, trembling, and said with a trembling voice, “No… I don’t know how I’ve offended you, but please show mercy, I… I’m willing to give you the most precious treasure, but I only ask that you spare our lives!”

Chao Shou dragged the pearl with both hands and didn’t even dare to raise his head.

“Purple cloud pearl?”

When she saw the pearl, Yan Ruoxue’s brows furrowed.

She reached out her hand and the purple cloud pearl fell into her hand.

“I obtained this pearl by chance. Now, I’m giving it to you as a gift. I only hope that you can spare our lives…” Chao Shou said in a trembling voice.

However, would Yan Ruoxue give him the chance? She looked coldly at Chao Shou in front of her and said, “You damn thing, die.”

Chao Shou’s expression changed. He opened his mouth and was about to shout, but before he could say anything, a sharp blade suddenly arrived and instantly beheaded him!

Seeing this, Chao Cang immediately ran!

His speed was extremely fast, and he escaped in the blink of an eye!

However, a huge hand covered the entire sky, stretching out and then suddenly slapping down.

“Boom!”

A loud sound rang out, and dust flew in an instant. The nest was directly smacked into a meat paste!

However, this did not reduce the anger in Yan Ruoxue’s heart.

She looked around and said coldly, “Leave no one in Pilgrimage City alive.”

“Yes!”

Hundreds of armored soldiers attacked instantly, launching a massacre on Pilgrimage City!

In less than half an hour, Pilgrimage City was filled with wails and cries. Not even chickens and dogs were left. Everyone had died a tragic death.

The extremely powerful Pilgrimage City was destroyed in an instant, becoming a dead city.

After that, they returned to Yan Ruoxue’s side and waited for her orders.

Yan Ruoxue’s gaze, however, was on Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground.

With a light leap, she arrived in front of Qin Yu.

When she looked at Qin Yu, her eyes suddenly became as tender as water. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She gently caressed Qin Yu’s face and could not help but smile.

Yan Ruoxue then took a pill and stuffed it into Qin Yu’s mouth.

After swallowing the pill, Qin Yu’s injuries began to heal slowly.

Just like that, Yan Ruoxue stayed by Qin Yu’s side and didn’t say a word. She only looked at Qin Yu quietly.

After an unknown period of time, the man in armor beside him walked forward and reminded, “Miss, we should go back now. Otherwise, the master will notice.

Yan Ruoxue grunted in agreement. She took the purple cloud pearl and placed it in Qin Yu’s hand.

“Miss, this purple cloud pearl is of great significance. Should we bring it back?” The man in armor frowned slightly.

“That’s right. Even to the Yan family, the purple cloud pearl is a rare treasure. Isn’t it inappropriate to leave it here…”

“We can leave him with other supreme treasures, even if it’s a Saint Weapon. But this purple cloud pearl…”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression turned cold as she said, “What purple cloud pearl?”

The crowd was stunned, clearly not understanding what Yan Ruoxue meant.

Yan Ruoxue coldly replied, “Why would you think that I haven’t seen the purple cloud pearl before? This is just an ordinary pearl, not the purple cloud pearl.”

“Miss, that is indeed the purple cloud pearl. Then… ”

Before he could finish his sentence, he could feel the intense killing intent from Yan Ruoxue. He immediately shut his mouth and did not dare to say anything more.

“I’ve already said that it’s just an ordinary pearl. If anyone dares to speak nonsense, don’t blame me for being impolite,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

“It’s… Yes.” The armored men didn’t dare to say anything and cupped their hands.

After that, Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu and gently caressed her face. After making sure that Qin Yu was fine, she stood up and said, “Let’s go.”

In front of them, a teleportation entrance appeared.

Just as they were about to leave, Qin Yu suddenly grabbed Yan Ruoxue’s hand.
