Chapter 787: The Peak of the Martial Marquis Realm Was Not Worth Mentioning! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Of course, he could see through the Purple Flame Sect’s intentions.

“By the way, is the Purple Flame Sect very strong?” Qin Yu asked.

Xue Yujie glanced at Qin Yu and nodded. “Yes, they have over twenty Martial Marquises, and among them, there are several at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm.”

“Other than that?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

Qin Yu didn’t care about these Martial Marquises at all.

As long as it didn’t involve a Martial Saint, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid.

“Other than that? What do you mean?” Xue Yujie clearly didn’t understand.

Qin Yu said, “For example, the Martial Saint’s weapon? Or the power of the Martial Saint or even an actual Martial Saint?”

Xue Yujie sneered. “Martial Saint? If the Purple Flame Sect had a Martial Saint, why would they hide in this country?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and agreed.

If they had a Martial Saint, no one in the world would be able to restrain the Purple Flame Sect.

“There are only six Martial Marquises in the Xue family. We are far from being a match for the Purple Flame Sect.” Xue Yujie took a deep breath.

“I’m afraid their goal is the same as yours. They are here for the power of a Martial Saint.” Old Master Xue said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “This means that if you want to deal with the Purple Flame Sect, you must use the power of the Martial Saint, right?”

“Yes.” Xue Yujie didn’t hide this.

Qin Yu continued to ask, “Then how many times can you use the power of the Martial Saint?”

Xue Yuzhi, who was at the side, explained, “Qin Yu, it seems that you don’t understand the power of the Martial Saint.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly, “Indeed, I don’t.”

Xue Yuzhi continued, “The power of the Martial Saint can only be used once. Once it is injected into someone’s body, the power will belong to someone.”

Qin Yu said in shock, “In other words, the power of the Martial Saint will remain in his body forever?”

“Of course not.” Xue Yujie continued.

“The power of the Martial Saint is one of the techniques of the Martial Saint. The effect of the power depends on the strength of the carrier.”

“If the power of the Martial Saint is injected into the body of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, not only will it not have any effect, but it will cause the Inner Strength Grandmaster to explode and die.”

“As for the duration of the power of the Martial Saint, it usually doesn’t last more than a month.”

Xue Yuzhi nodded and said, “Yes, that is to say, once the power of the Martial Saint is used, it will disappear. It is only a matter of time.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

In this way, this power of the Martial Saint was like a nuclear bomb in the current era. Once it was used, there was no turning back.

“At this moment, perhaps we can only use the power of the Martial Saint.” Xue Yujie said in a deep voice.

“But who should we inject this power of the Martial Saint into?”

At this moment, it became a difficult problem.

The Xue family indeed had many Martial Marquises, but their strength couldn’t be considered tyrannical.

As for these three siblings of the Xue family, they were only at the early-stage of the Martial Marquis realm.

If the Purple Flame Sect also possessed the power of a Martial Saint, then they wouldn’t be a match for the Purple Flame Sect.

However, if they were to inject it into someone else’s body, who could guarantee that the person who obtained the power of a Martial Saint wouldn’t betray the Xue family?

“Could it be that the Xue family doesn’t have powerful descendants?” Qin Yu asked with some doubt.

Xue Yujie shook his head and said, “The descendants of the Xue family have never participated in the martial arts.”

Qin Yu instantly fell silent.

He touched his chin and said tentatively, “If that’s the case, why don’t you inject this Martial Saint’s power into my body? I will help you destroy the Purple Flame Sect.”

“You?” Xue Yujie couldn’t help but snort coldly.

“Qin Yu, are you taking advantage of the situation?”

Qin Yu waved his hand repeatedly and said, “No, no, no, you have misunderstood. If this Martial Saint’s power were to be injected into my body, the effect would definitely be better than in anyone else. The Purple Flame Sect isn’t even worth mentioning.”

“Qin Yu, I know that you are in the late stage of the Martial Marquis realm, but the Xue family has people at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm! What makes you think that the effect would be better if it was injected into your body?” Xue Yujie sneered.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry. He said with a nonchalant smile, “The peak of the Martial Marquis realm is like grass in front of me.”

When he said this, everyone present couldn’t help but laugh.

“Qin Yu, do you know how big the gap is between the realms of the Martial Marquis Realm?” Xue Yujie said.

“The realms between the peak of the Martial Marquis realm are very difficult to cross,” Xue Yuzhi also said.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but scratch his head as he thought to himself, “It seems that I have no reputation in Sheng Kingdom.”

“That’s enough, Qin Yu. Now that such a thing has happened, don’t even think about the power of a Martial Saint. Go back.” Xue Yujie waved his hand and said.

“If the Xue family can avoid this disaster, we will still remember your kindness.”

After saying this, they gave the order to leave.

However, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave.

He smiled and said, “I know that everyone doesn’t believe me. How about this, I will fight with that peak Martial Marquis and prove it to you.”

Xue Yujie impatiently waved his hand and said, “Don’t make trouble at this time. You’re just an alchemist. Your martial arts abilities will naturally be affected. How can you be a match for other Martial Marquises?”

Qin Yu said, “Mr. Xue, why don’t you give me a chance? This is good for everyone.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu subconsciously looked at Xue Yuzhi.

Xue Yuzhi was silent for a moment and said, “Why don’t... we let him try?”

Xue Yujie frowned and said impatiently, “Okay, but let me tell you, if anything happens to you, the Xue family will not be responsible.”

“Don’t worry,” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

Therefore, Xue Yujie turned around and left the hall, while Qin Yu followed him out.

The few of them came to the grassland of the Xue family and waited for the arrival of the peak-stage Martial Marquis. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

About ten minutes later.

An old man followed Xue Yujie and walked over.

“This is the peak-stage Martial Marquis of the Xue family,” Xue Yujie said.

“Elder Zhao, don’t be too harsh on him,” Xue Yujie looked at the old man and said.

The old man called Elder Zhao smiled nonchalantly and said, “Don’t worry.”

After saying that, Elder Zhao walked in front of Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Young people nowadays really don’t know their places. Do you know that it’s very easy for serious injuries or even death to occur in a fight between Martial Marquises?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Elder Zhao, don’t worry. I can control my strength well.”

This undoubtedly infuriated Elder Zhao. His expression darkened as he berated, “I’ve never seen a junior as rude as you! If I don’t teach you a lesson, you won’t know how arrogant you are!”

After he finished speaking, the internal qi on Elder Zhao’s body began to rise rapidly, and powerful qi energy burst out from his fingers!

The qi energy materialized, and the vibrating air buzzed!

Seeing this scene, Xue Yuzhi’s expression couldn’t help but change!

“This is Elder Zhao’s trump card move, sky-dancing slash!” Xue Yuzhi exclaimed.

“Elder Zhao, please show mercy!”

However, Elder Zhao was already enraged, so he couldn’t care less about Xue Yuzhi.

He held a sharp blade in his hand and aimed it at Qin Yu’s chest!
