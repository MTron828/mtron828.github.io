1775 The Test of the Demon-Slaying Peak

Following behind Xiao Sheng, Qin Yu’s expression did not look so natural.

Thinking that Qin Yu was scared, Jue Wu patted his shoulder and said, “Don’t worry so much. Forget it if Thunder Courtyard doesn’t want us. I don’t even care! ”

Qin Yu knew Jue Wu’s good intentions. So he smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll listen to you.”

After taking a few more steps, soon they entered the Demon-slaying Peak.

!!

The entire Demon-slaying Peak could be said to be a huge sect. In addition to its huge area, it also had extremely substantial cultivation resources.

At a glance, one could not see the border. There were towering immortal trees everywhere, and also the grotto-heaven blessed lands built by the natural environment.

“What are you thinking?” Xiao Sheng suddenly asked at this moment.

“I’m just thinking if even Yuan Xiu is not considered evil, how many people in the entire Holy Region are considered evil,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“If there are only a few people, then what’s the point of me coming here?”

“You haven’t experienced enough. In this world, there are countless truly evil people,” Xiao Sheng shook his head and said.

“There are those who kill for pleasure and harm others without benefiting themselves. Some kill innocents through the killing method. At least, Yuan Xiu did it for the sake of cultivation.”

“Hmm.” Qin Yu responded and said, “So it’s up to the Devil Hunter to judge.”

“You can say so. However, Devil Hunter’s requirements are extremely high. They can’t be wrong,” Xiao Sheng said.

While they were talking, they had arrived at the entrance of a grotto-heaven blessed land.

This place was filled with dense air and smoke. It was like a fairyland.

This place was also at the peak of the mountain. It made one feel cold and lonely at the top.

“Xiao Sheng requests an audience,” Xiao Sheng stood at the door and said.

His voice went straight into the mansion.

After a while, a swishing sound came from inside.

In just a moment, a burly man with a slightly ferocious face rushed out from inside.

The man was not handsome. In fact, he looked a little scary. His face was slightly red, and Qin Yu could not help but think of Chang Mang.

“We are…”

“The dean has already told me,” the brawny man said.

“I’m the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak. Who wants to join Demon-slaying Peak? You? Or you?”

Jue Wu patted her chest and said, “He and I!”

When the peak master saw Jue Wu’s petite body, he couldn’t help but laugh.

“Where did this little brat come from? Don’t you know how terrifying Demon-slaying Peak is?” the brawny man laughed and said.

Jue Wu was instantly furious. Her small face turned red and she pounced toward the peak master!

Xiao Sheng wanted to stop her but it was too late.

That pair of small hands contained an extremely terrifying power. The peak master who had just walked out of the mansion flew back again.

“Boom!”

In just a moment, a terrible sound came from the depths of the mansion. It seemed to be the sound of a body hitting the wall.

The entire mansion was on the verge of collapse, with dust scattering down.

“Sign!” Xiao Sheng couldn’t help but sigh. He held his forehead with his hand and looked helpless.

Jue Wu also realized that she was in trouble. She coughed awkwardly and said, “Peak Master, are you alright? I didn’t do it on purpose. I didn’t use much strength just now…” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

While she was saying that, the peak master rushed out with a whoosh.

He patted the dirt off his body, and his ferocious face looked even more terrifying at this moment.

Xiao Sheng took a step forward, wittingly or unwittingly placing Qin Yu and Jue Wu behind him.

Although he did not release any terrifying internal qi, everyone knew that Xiao Sheng could make a move at any time.

“I’m really sorry,” Xiao Sheng said in a deep voice.

The peak master stared at Jue Wu and gasped.

Just as everyone was feeling nervous, the peak master suddenly burst out laughing.

“D*mn it! I didn’t expect your petite body to contain such a terrifying power! I’ve approved you to join Demon-slaying Peak!” the peak master said loudly.

Seeing what happened, Qin Yu could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

Thinking about it, being the master of Demon-slaying Peak should be the most difficult task.

For those who were willing to be the peak masters here, a sense of justice was more important than having powerful strength.

“And you, come over. If you can also push me away, I’ll let you join immediately!” The peak master looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu laughed bitterly. This peak master was at the Reversion Void stage. Moreover, he was an extremely powerful Reversion Void stage cultivator.

Not to mention Qin Yu’s current state, he couldn’t even do it at his peak.

“Let’s just follow the normal procedure,” Qin Yu said.

The peak master patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “No problem. Come with me. It’s been a long time since someone joined Demon-slaying Peak.

He counted with his fingers and muttered, ” The last person seemed to be more than a hundred years ago. ”

“More than a hundred years ago?” Qin Yu could not help but be shocked. No one had joined Demon-slaying Peak for more than a hundred years?”

The peak master sneered and said, “Those who come to Thunder Courtyard are all famous heaven’s favorite sons. Their purpose is naturally to get the resources and cultivation techniques of Thunder Courtyard. Who would be willing to do such a dangerous thing?” On Demon-slaying Peak, one could just die.”

The peak master paused for a moment and said proudly, “Of course, only a few can enter Thunder Courtyard.”

Qin Yu suddenly realized.

Thinking about it, it made sense. Even someone like Yong Ji was rejected, not to mention others.

The three of them followed behind the peak master and walked toward a particular place on Demon-slaying Peak.

There was a very bright light on the training ground of Demon-slaying Peak.

This light emitted wisps of extremely heavy internal qi. People did not dare to approach the light.

And this light was the test that Qin Yu had to go through.

On the way to the training ground, Xiao Sheng looked at Qin Yu and said, “If there’s a chance, I must go to the first main peak.”

“Why?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“Don’t forget, this is the place of Immortal Emperor Lei’s inheritance. It’ll naturally be a great opportunity if you can obtain his inheritance,” said Xiao Sheng coldly.

Hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

Any of Immortal Emperor Lei’s cultivation techniques would make the entire Holy Region go crazy, let alone his inheritance!

Soon, they arrived at the training ground.

The peak master pointed at the light not far away and said, “This is the formation left behind by our ancestors. It will adjust its power according to your cultivation level, so you don’t have to worry too much.”

Qin Yu could not help but look solemn.

With Qin Yu’s current state, he could only exert one-tenth of his strength at most. It would be extremely difficult for him to pass through the light.

Soon, a large group of people gathered on the training ground.

These people were all cultivators of Demon-slaying Peak. Since no one had joined Demon-slaying Peak for a very long time, they had all come to watch.

“Buzz!”

Soon, the light was lit up.

“Go.” The peak master patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.
