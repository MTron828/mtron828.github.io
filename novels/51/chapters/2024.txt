2025 At the End of the Rope

Sensing the power of the black Spiritual Energy Sword, Elder Si was even more terrified. He suppressed the fear in his heart and gathered the power of thunder in his body to the extreme. The Thunder Armor flashed with an even more dazzling purple light.

The crowd outside the killing formation looked nervously at Qin Yu and Elder Si. They could feel that this attack would probably decide the outcome of this battle!

The black Spiritual Energy Sword finally collided vigorously with the Thunder Armor as if the sky and earth collapsed. The Spiritual Energy Sword and the power of thunder consumed each other in the air, causing waves of soul-stirring booms.

However, as the Spiritual Energy Sword and the Thunder Armor continued to clash, Elder Si was surprised to discover the Spiritual Energy Sword was becoming increasingly powerful and could not be eliminated at all!

!!

Qin Yu fully focused on controlling the killing formation. He kept gathering killing intent into the Spiritual Energy Sword to strengthen it.

All of this was to force Elder Si to give up.

Just when everyone thought the battle was about to end, a ruthless light flashed in Elder Si’s eyes.

He roared, and the Thunder Armor instantly erupted with intense purple light, forming a massive thunder vortex that crazily absorbed the power of thunder in the surroundings.

The massive thunder vortex instantly engulfed the Spiritual Energy Sword and gradually suppressed it.

The surroundings instantly fell silent. Qin Yu, who was in the Endless Killing Formation, frowned even more.

Elder Si’s strength was indeed terrifying. He actually resolved the Spiritual Energy Sword condensed by this Endless Killing Formation!

“Do you think I will die?” Elder Si’s face was ferocious as he roared repeatedly!

His chest had been torn apart, and blood was gushing out. Coupled with his messy hair, he looked like a demon!

Qin Yu felt uneasy. His mental strength had started to be lacking, and the killing intent in the Endless Killing Formation was becoming agitated and frantic increasingly. It was as if it was going to rampage at any moment!

Qin Yu looked pale. He gritted his teeth and controlled the formation with all his might. Once the formation failed, he would surely die in this formation!

“Oh no! The formation is going to be out of control.” In the distance, Xiao Hai, watching the battle, suddenly stood up.

His eyes were sharp, and he could tell at a glance the formation was gradually getting out of control.

Xiao Hai was a chivalrous person. Moreover, he was Qin Yu’s friend. Therefore, he immediately decided to make a move.

However, at this moment, the formation stabilized again, and the manic power, once again, was gradually under control.

“Hmm?” Xiao Hai was a little surprised, and his eyes revealed a strong sense of praise.

He knew Qin Yu had regained control of the Endless Killing Formation with his powerful willpower!

“I must kill this Elder Si as soon as possible…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and began to use his powerful mental strength to control all the killing intent in the Endless Killing Formation with all his might!

A terrifying killing intent surged from all directions! It was as if it was preparing a tremendously terrifying attack!

This bone-chilling killing intent was tremendously terrifying! Intense fear and unease even flashed across Elder Si’s face.

“Qin Yu is at the end of his rope. If he can’t kill Elder Si with this attack, it means the Endless Killing Formation is going to be out of control.”

“That’s right. Let’s see if Elder Ji can hold on.”

Everyone discussed animatedly, but the power within the killing formation continued to condense and become stronger!

Just when everyone thought the power had reached its limit, the power in the killing formation continued to increase!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a figure slowly condensed in the killing formation!

This figure was tall and strong and full of killing intent, like a true Asura!

The killing intent surging from his body was incredibly pure!

“Is this Qin Yu!?” someone exclaimed.

“Qin Yu used the killing intent to condense himself. Did he comprehend the dao technique of the Endless Killing Formation?”

“This kid… How did he do it? In such a short period of time, he comprehended the dao technique of the Endless Killing Formation?”

That figure was incredibly tall and strong, and its power was limitless!

Just facing this figure formed by killing intent was already hard to endure for Elder Si!

The powerful pressure was beyond everyone’s imagination. Even with the protection seal, Elder Si’s body was still pressed down to the ground!

“Ah!”

Elder Si raised his head and roared. He resisted the pressure with all his might, but it was futile. His body was still pressed down!

“Crack!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, a crisp sound suddenly came from Elder Si’s body!

“Crack! Crack!”

Then the protection seal on Elder Si’s body began to shatter like pieces of glass!

“What? He crushed Elder Si’s protection seal with just the pressure?”

“This… What kind of power does this contain?”

“This figure… has probably gathered all the internal qi of the entire killing formation! In other words, this figure is the true body of the Endless Killing Formation!”

Elder Si was in despair. He resisted with all his might but could not withstand it at all!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s mental strength was already on the verge of collapse. His vision was blurry, and his body was on the verge of being shattered at any moment!

Once his mental strength collapsed, Qin Yu’s divine sense would dissipate!

As such, this move was tremendously risky. Qin Yu was betting his life on it!

“Go to hell!” Qin Yu’s furious roar came from the gigantic figure!

Then the figure raised his pitch-black palm and crushed Elder Si with endless killing intent!

Just as the gigantic figure with killing intent was about to finish off Elder Si, the entire battlefield was shrouded in an oppressive atmosphere. Everyone held their breaths and waited for the final outcome of this battle.

...

A trace of madness and despair flashed across Elder Si’s eyes.

He knew that if he could not resist this attack, he would surely die on the spot!

At the critical moment of life and death, he suddenly bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood to merge with the power of thunder.

“Heavenly Thunder Blaze!” Elder Si roared and condensed the blood of thunder into a thunder spear. He waved it and stabbed it at the gigantic killing intent figure.

The power of the heavenly thunder and the killing intent collided in the air, causing a violent explosion that shook everyone.

Elder Si’s thunder spear was constantly resisting the strike under unimaginable pressure!

However, although the spear in his hand was powerful, it could not resist Qin Yu’s strike formed from killing intent!

The spear lasted less than half a second before an extremely loud boom sounded. After that, it broke inch by inch and vanished without a trace!

Everyone’s expression changed seeing this scene. Some looked solemn, while others were tremendously excited.

Qin Yu seemed going to win!

“Ah!” Elder Si let out an indignant roar. However, he could no longer find any countermeasures!
