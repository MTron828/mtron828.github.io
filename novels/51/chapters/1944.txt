1945 Meeting Xiao Sheng Again

“This internal qi… ” Qin Yu muttered, and he suddenly looked in a specific direction.

Not far away stood a man with a very tall and thin figure.

Even though the temple was swarmed with people, he could still see him at a glance.

This person was none other than Xiao Sheng!

!!

“Xiao Sheng, he’s also here!” Qin Yu was shocked!

He couldn’t care about anything else and immediately ran toward Xiao Sheng.

Shortly, Qin Yu arrived in front of Xiao Sheng.

“Xiao Sheng, you’re here too.” Qin Yu was both surprised and delighted.

Xiao Sheng, on the contrary, was somewhat calm. He looked into the distance not far away and quietly said, “It’s been a long time.”

After so long, Xiao Sheng’s internal qi had become even more powerful.

Not only that, his temperament was even colder as if he was not from the mortal world.

“How have you been? Are you doing fine?” Qin Yu didn’t know what to say, so he asked casually.

“It’s quite fruitful,” Xiao Sheng nodded slightly and said.

Qin Yu wanted to ask more questions, but the phantom in the temple had stood up.

He looked straight up at the sky. His eyes were shining bright as if he had comprehended something.

The scene immediately quieted down, and everyone was waiting for him to speak.

The temple fair was swarmed with more people now. Experts from all over had arrived. Even the Prince of Great Xia was standing in the crowd, quietly looking at the phantom.

He put his hands together as if he was expressing his respect for the experts of his own. However, the loneliness in his eyes also seemed to be sighing with emotion about the glory of the past.

“I understand now.”

The phantom spoke at this moment.

As he spoke, the atmosphere became even tenser. Everyone stared at him, afraid of missing something.

“All this while, I was determined to cross the universe and travel the world. However, when I really did it, I always felt something was missing…” The phantom continued.

Hearing this, Qin Yu was tremendously shocked!

Travel the entire universe? What kind of feat was this? What was at the end of the universe?

“The universe has no end. No one can truly achieve it…” the phantom continued.

Suddenly, he looked at his body.

“Perhaps what I should cultivate is the self. The self is the universe… ” The phantom murmured.

He kept repeating saying this. Then his body began to disappear gradually.

This sentence immediately caused a commotion in the crowd.

“Self? I am the universe? What does he mean?”

“I don’t know. What is cultivating the self?”

Qin Yu also felt somewhat strange. To comprehend the self or to comprehend the dao technique of heaven and earth, he seemed to have given an extremely vague answer.

Qin Yu suddenly remembered a book on Earth. It was recorded in the book that the human body was the universe, and the mysteries of the universe were also hidden in the human body.

Was this also related to cultivation?

“I am the universe, and the universe is me… ” Xiao Sheng by the side mumured.

Qin Yu looked at Xiao Sheng and seemed to have comprehended something. It seemed like the secret was going to let out!

“I seem to have understood something now,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Cultivation was an extremely complicated matter. One had to comprehend the dao technique, spiritual energy, magical artifact, and so on. Each one of these was indispensable.

However, there was also a saying that the Great Dao was the simplest, and perhaps cultivation was also extremely simple.

Everyone’s dao technique was different, but if one looked back carefully, one would find all the paths eventually pointed in the same direction.

At the end of cultivation, it was almost the same, and it would never deviate from the principal.

“What was the phantom’s cultivation like when he was alive?” Qin Yu asked Xiao Sheng.

Xiao Sheng shook his head, indicating that he had no idea.

Qin Yu was silent. He had thousands of thoughts in his mind, but they all merged into one in the end.

This sentence seemed very simple, but it also seemed extremely complicated.

After the phantom disappeared, the scene started to become lively again.

Many taverns in the temple fair were occupied. People sat in groups of three to five to comprehend this sentence.

“Let’s also find a place to sit down for a while,” Qin Yu said to Xiao Sheng.

Xiao Sheng nodded, not rejecting.

Thus, the two found a tavern in the temple and sat down.

They did not speak the entire time. They seemed like trying to comprehend this sentence.

“Tsk! Tsk! The temple fair ended really fast this time.”

“Yeah. I remember the longest lasted for two years.

“That’s right. Even the shortest would take three or four days. But this time, he only said one sentence.”

...

“Sigh! Perhaps this sentence has exposed the secrets of heaven and the essence of cultivation.”

Everyone discussed animatedly, each throwing out their ideas.

“What do you understand from this sentence?” Qin Yu looked at Xiao Sheng and asked.

“Perhaps he’s saying that one should cultivate his own dao technique,” Xiao Sheng said in a deep voice.

But Qin Yu had a different view on this.

“In that case, it wouldn’t be worth his time to comprehend for so long. Cultivating one’s own dao technique has long become common knowledge.” Qin Yu shook his head.

No one could replicate another. No matter who they replicate, they would not succeed in the end, and they could never comprehend the true dao technique.

“I also felt my thinking is too simple,” Xiao Sheng said.

“But I think everyone is overthinking this,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Oh?” Xiao Sheng’s brows twitched as he waited for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu said, “There was a similar saying in my hometown. The book said that the human body is the real universe. The mystery of the whole world is in the depths of the universe, and is hidden in the human body at the same time.”

...

Being reminded of his, Qin Yu seemed to have also comprehended something.

“Think about it. No one knows what is at the end of the universe. Even the Immortal Emperor might not have been there,” Qin Yu said somewhat excitedly.

“But the human body is different. If I am the universe? Does my body have a boundary? If we follow his words, our bodies are limitless and endless.”

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly stood up due to his emotions.

“What is restricting our bodies? Is it our skin? The bone? The skeleton?

“When skin, flesh, and bones are gone, what are we left with?”

“Divine sense, thoughts,” said Xiao Sheng in a deep voice.

“That’s right. That’s the true self, the universe!” Qin Yu said excitedly.

At this moment, he could clearly feel the doa technique and the secrets that had been exposed.

As long as Qin Yu had enough spiritual energy, he could reach the middle stage of the Reversion Void at any time!

“I understand now.” Xiao Sheng nodded slightly and agreed with what Qin Yu said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“What a shameless brag! Do you think you’re qualified to comprehend the dao technique?” At this moment, someone walked over from not far away.

Looking over, it was the people from the Si family.
