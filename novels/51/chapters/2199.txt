2200 The Skeleton Gang Makes a Move

The two spiritual stones in his hand floated in mid-air, and his body emitted vibrant spiritual energy.

“This must be the spiritual essence the white-clad woman mentioned.”

Holding the spiritual essence in his hand, a stream of pure spiritual energy surged into his dantian.

That spiritual energy was even purer than the spiritual energy he absorbed while cultivating under the Green Spirit Tree. The speed was even faster by a thousand times.

The two energies stirred up a whirlwind, and the spiritual energy was instilled into Qin Yu’s body like a vortex.

“This is the spiritual essence, the violent energy that the teleportation formation can absorb!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Previously, a True Saint Realm cultivator from the Skeleton Gang forcefully absorbed the spiritual essence and died!”

A few underlings steering the ship were dumbfounded.

The abundant spiritual energy flowed into Qin Yu’s dantian like a river and then from the dantian to his limbs and bones.

“Crack!”

After four hours or so, two pieces of spiritual essence suddenly cracked.

Qin Yu looked and saw the spiritual essence in his hand had already cracked into something like gravel. The spiritual energy within had been completely absorbed.

“200 million spiritual stones have just gone like this.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

The amount of spiritual energy required to advance to the True Saint Realm was indeed terrifying. The spiritual energy contained within 200 million spiritual stones could not help him advance even a little.

The Skeleton Gang had occupied nearby Black Platform for a long time and had only collected two pieces of spiritual essence. It implied that the resources here were relatively poor.

Regardless of spiritual energy or resources, it was much richer in the Holy Region.

Especially the geniuses of the nine great aristocratic families, all kinds of resources were piled up like mountains.

If this continued, the gap would only grow wider.

Qin Yu slightly frowned.

The higher one’s cultivation level was the more resources one needed.

Regardless of whether on Earth or in the Holy Region, o wonder only the aristocratic families could survive for hundreds or thousands of years.

Because only they could monopolize these resources and nurture countless geniuses.

At this moment, a storm was brewing in the City Lord’s mansion in Black Platform City. All kinds of domineering internal qi shuttled within.

“City Lord Hei Yun, I’ve already investigated. This person came from the Holy Region, so he must have treasures of the Holy Region with him. He might even have the supreme scriptures of the Holy Region!”

Lin Tong, the head of the Lin family, narrowed his eyes.

“I heard that even the formation of Elder Lin and the seven cultivators of the Lin family was not his match!”

The head of the Fang family narrowed his eyes as he spoke, and no one knew what he was thinking in his heart.

“I think Elder Lin had underestimated his enemy. If he had asked for the Lin family’s tribulation magical artifacts and used them as the formation core, he would have killed this brat!”

Another elderly man waving his feather fan said. He was the head of the Yu family, Yu Qingzi.

If the outsiders saw this would be shocked. The family heads of three great families of the Black Platform Continent had gathered.

The last gathering occurred long ago, and no one could recall when it happened.

“This brat must be from the aristocratic family of the Holy Region. It’s a rare opportunity for us. The Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator has not emerged in Black Platform for thousands of years, and the dao technique here is fading. If we don’t seize this opportunity, we still won’t break through for thousands of years.”

Lin fixed his gaze on a special screen in front of him.

The screen showed Qin Yu’s battle with the Skeleton Gang and the Lin family.

“I’ll definitely kill this person. So what if he’s from the Holy Region? He must pay the price for killing the members of the Skeleton Gang. Otherwise, my Skeleton Gang’s many years of planning nearby Black Platform will be destroyed.”

A burly man, as solid as an iron tower, sneered and said. His taut muscles were tense, and there seemed to be electric currents flowing on them, containing limitless energy.

“Look at this move. Doesn’t it look like the person from the Holy Region ten thousand years ago?”

Hei Yun looked at Qin Yu’s Sainyly Body Technique and suddenly said.

A few of them could not help but tremble. This should not have anything to do with that Asura, right?

“What bullsh*t ten thousand years ago? Why don’t you talk about a million years ago? Let me go and take this brat’s head first.”

Lei Jue shouted impatiently.

He had initially wanted to go and kill Qin Yu directly as soon as he entered. However, he was stopped by the Lin family’s City Lord.

At this moment, he could no longer hold back his bad temper. He immediately kicked the door open and flew toward the Lin family.

“Why don’t we let him go and test it out?”

Lin Tong sneered and said.

“But we don’t know how much the rumors from 10,000 years have been exaggerated. I don’t think we need to care about that.”

Yu Qingzi looked at Qin Yu’s clothes with a greedy expression.

Even a piece of clothing was such a precious treasure. Just how many treasures did this kid have on him?

At this moment, Qin Yu was still in the Lin family.

A terrifying internal qi suddenly enveloped Qin Yu.

“Go to hell!”

The next moment, an enormous fist landed on Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu took a step back and nodded slightly.

“Body Refinement? It’s a little lacking.”

“F*ck!”

A terrifying aura burst out from Lei Jue’s muscles, and the True Saint’s aura enveloped Qin Yu.

The dozens of houses around Qin Yu suddenly exploded along with the ground, turning into countless pieces of gravel.

“You may die now!”

Several hundreds of fists containing the power of a peak True Saint landed on Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu’s gaze turned cold. He directly closed in, relying on his physical body to launch close-range attacks.

“Hahaha, you want to compete with me using physical body? Are you tickling Grandpa?”

Lei Jue laughed heartily.

In an instant, the wind and clouds surged. The violent aura between the fists was like an explosion, sending everyone around flying.

“He hasn’t fallen yet?”

After several hundreds of punches, Lei Jue looked at Qin Yu in surprise.

“Use it if you have a backup plan. Otherwise, you no longer have a chance.”

Qin Yu shook his head. Lei Jue was at most in the Middle-stage of the True Saint.

If he was facing Si Liuhe, he probably could not even last one round.

“Hahaha! You’re indeed courting death!”

Lei Jue punched with both fists, and a pair of blood-red gloves appeared on his fists.

“Gloves of Annihilation! Lei Jue even brought the Gloves of Annihilation! It’s a top-grade True Saint magical artifact obtained in purgatory previously. Rumor has it that it can even activate the power of tribulation if it’s fully activated!”

Lin Tong’s expression changed as if he was fearful of this glove.

For a moment, wherever the fist wind went, it seemed to have turned into a sea of blood.

Shrill cries filled Qin Yu’s ears as gigantic skeletons struggled out of the sea of blood one after another.

They opened their bloody mouths and bit at Qin Yu.

“It’s actually the Divine Sense Attack?”

Qin Yu watched indifferently as the skulls crashed and hacked toward his divine sense.

“Penetrating Punch!”

Lei Jue laughed ferociously. He put his right fist on his waist and his left palm under the fist.

The terrifying aura continued to rise. All the auras were like tsunamis, layer after layer, directly rising to the peak.

That punch fell like a mountain, and the surrounding ground sank thousands of feet directly.

“Whoosh!”

A golden light suddenly flashed past, and the little golden man in his divine sense suddenly opened his eyes. All the skeletons in the sea of blood were split open, and the scarlet scene of the sea of blood was completely destroyed.

Following that, an indifferent voice came from the dust.

“The cosmic form.”

Qin Yu’s body expanded by a few thousand feet and bit the mountain-like fist.

He then swallowed it in one gulp.

“You may die now!”

Qin Yu stared at Lei Jue indifferently and slapped him into a meat patty.
