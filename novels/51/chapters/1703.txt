Chapter 1704: Chapter 1704, imminent Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu felt extremely uneasy. He looked at the two people and said, “What do you mean by the day of Heavenly Dao?”

The two people looked at each other and frowned. “You don’t even know the day of Heavenly Dao?”

Qin Yu was afraid that the two people would be suspicious, so he didn’t ask any further. He waved his hand and said, “You can go.”

The two of them cupped their hands toward Qin Yu. Then, the void in front of them shook, and the two of them disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and his expression was somewhat ugly.

He didn’t know the origin of this day of the Heavenly Dao, but according to the two of them, this day of the Heavenly Dao would arrive in a short two to three years.

Two to three years might not be considered short for ordinary people.

But for a cultivator, it was too short.

Even if the world changed, Qin Yu didn’t dare to guarantee that he would step into the reversion void stage in two to three years.

For example, in the South Province, countless people had been stuck at the peak of the half-step realm for countless years. If the world didn’t change, they wouldn’t be able to step into the reversion void stage for the rest of their lives.

“Another chaotic body...”Qin Yu murmured.

It seemed that the Yan family had already known about the uniqueness of Yan Ruoxue’s constitution. And this uniqueness, when combined with the chaotic body, would be brought into full play.

This was something that Qin Yu absolutely could not tolerate!

He did not dare to waste time. He only wanted to step into the reversion void stage within two to three years and head to the Central Province.

If he could not step into the reversion void stage within two to three years, then Qin Yu would also resolutely head to the Central Province and plead with the Yan family.

However, Qin Yu knew very well in his heart that the probability of success like this was extremely low.

In any world, what they valued would always be benefits.

Qin Yu did not waste any time. He put away the speaker and rushed to the position left by man with the mustache.

Along the way to the big graves, wisps of dark energy floated over.

But soon, Qin Yu’s face darkened.

This bit of dark energy was far from what Qin Yu had imagined!

“Damn it, man with the mustache, that unreliable bastard!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

Just this bit of dark energy brought about a negligible improvement.

If it was in the past, Qin Yu would never have put this bit of dark energy in his eyes.

But now that the matter was urgent, Qin Yu had no choice but to sit cross-legged.

“No matter how small a fly is, it’s still meat. Forget it,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and slowly absorbed the dark energy from heaven and earth.

Wisps of dark energy entered his body, and the second round of cultivation began.

...

The northern lands.

The width of the Dead River became smaller and smaller. The thousands of feet wide dead river was quietly swallowed by the Earth and disappeared without a trace.

At this moment, the Dead River seemed to be only three or four meters long.

This speed had exceeded everyone’s expectations.

In these few days, regardless of whether it was the southern region or the northern lands, there were people who tried to jump across the river of death.

Unfortunately, when they jumped into the air, they were instantly swallowed by the river of death and turned into dry bones.

This also caused countless corpses to float up from the shore of the river of death. Those corpses were badly damaged, as if they had been bitten by ten thousand beasts.

Yong Ji, Sima Bei, and the others stood on the shore, looking at these corpses and couldn’t help but sigh.

“I tried to step into the river of death once again, but unfortunately, I still failed.”Sima bei sighed.

“I really don’t know how that madman Xiao Hai did it.”

One had to know that Xiao Hai was the same as Xiao Sheng, only half a step into the reversion void stage. The current Sima Bei and the others had surprisingly stepped into the reversion void stage, but they were still unable to safely cross the river of death.

“If we were at our peak condition, I’m afraid that we four godly monarchs would have died at his hands long ago,”Sima bei continued. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Yong Ji said with some curiosity, “Xiao Hai is so strong. Why didn’t he kill us back then? Instead, he let us escape?”

Sima bei glanced at Yong Ji coldly and said, “Before you guys arrived, we had never crossed the river of death. We Were Afraid of dying at Xiao Hai’s hands. Do you know why?”

Yong Ji shook his head, indicating that he did not know.

Sima bei took a deep breath, he said, “Back then, we also had godly monarchs crossing the river of death, wanting to break through the northern border in one fell swoop. Unfortunately, those godly monarchs died at the hands of Xiao Hai. They did not even have the chance to escape.”

After Yong Ji heard this, he could not help but be startled. Then, he hurriedly said, “In other words, the godly monarchs we saw when we came have already been changed?”

“Changed three times.”Sima bei said expressionlessly.

“And I’m not afraid that you all know that the godly kings who died were all stronger than me.”

As soon as these words were said, Yong Ji immediately broke out in cold sweat!

When he recalled the scene of the great battle with Xiao Hai at the northern border, he felt a chill on his back!

That was probably the closest he had to death!

“But why didn’t he kill us?”Yong Ji didn’t understand.

Sima bei sighed, “Xiao Hai is kind-hearted. I’m afraid he didn’t want to kill the cultivators of the South Province, so he only repelled you.”

Yong Ji instantly fell into silence and didn’t speak for a long time.

Although he was a vicious person, he was still somewhat moved at this moment.

“Why? Do you regret it?”He Teng said with a gloomy tone.

Yong Ji glanced at he teng and said coldly, “I’m not a bastard like you.”

He Teng didn’t refute this. Let alone a person who showed mercy to him, he could even kill his savior without hesitation.

“At this rate, I’m afraid that the Dead River will disappear completely within ten days.”Sima bei continued.

“At that time, Li Province will truly be unified.”

For the past few years, the four continents of Li Province had never interacted with each other. This might be the first time in history.

“The Lord still shows no signs of awakening. Sigh, I’m afraid that even if the dead river disappears, he might not wake up.”Sima bei sighed.

This was definitely not good news.

If someone from the southern region took the opportunity to kill the elementalists, then the revival plan of the Northern Region would completely fail.

“Let’s take it one step at a time,”he teng said indifferently.

...

Heavenly Cloud sect.

Xiao Sheng still had no intention of breaking through.

Just as Qu Zhu had said, with his ability, it was extremely easy for him to step into the reversion void stage. However, the conceited him wanted to fight the elementalists with a half-step into the reversion void stage.

“Sect leader, I’m afraid that the Death River will disappear within five days,”the deputy sect leader said with a frown.

“Yes.”Xiao Sheng nodded and did not show much of an expression.

The deputy sect leader tried to ask, “Sect leader, aren’t you worried?”

Xiao Sheng said indifferently, “Worried? What’s there to be worried about?”

“That Elementalist...”the deputy sect leader opened his mouth but did not continue speaking.

Xiao Sheng closed his eyes slightly. It seemed as if he had nothing to do with this.

The arrival of the great world had greatly changed the world. Everyone was desperately cultivating.

In such a great world, the slightest carelessness could cause others to fall behind.

However, Xiao Sheng seemed to be an exception. He was extremely carefree and did not care at all.
