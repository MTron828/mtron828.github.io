Chapter 1181: Chapter 1,181, twilight of the sacred mausoleum 

The desolate God’s eye swept across the entire sacred mausoleum!

Under the desolate God’s eye, the entire sacred mausoleum could not be hidden!

“Eh?”Lu Yun and Qin Yu’s expressions changed drastically when they saw this!

They could not understand what secrets this young man was hiding?

“Do you think I Need You?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Lu Guan and Lu Guan were speechless.

At this moment, Qin Yu retracted his desolate God’s eye.

He put his hands behind his back and said calmly, “Of course, I can consider splitting it equally with you. After all, you were the ones who found the sacred mausoleum.”

Hearing this, surprise flashed in their eyes.

“Is what you said true?”Lu Yun asked.

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and said calmly, “Of course. I’m not an unreasonable person.”

The two of them were from the holy region after all. Besides, they needed their help to go to the holy region. It was not a good choice to have a falling out with them now.

“Let’s go,”Qin Yu said.

Since things had come to this, Lu Guan and the others could only follow Qin Yu’s arrangements.

The two of them relied on their protective magical artifacts to forcefully carry the holy might as they walked into the Holy Mausoleum.

This was a huge palace, resplendent and magnificent.

After stepping into the palace, the first thing they saw were nine huge pits.

Although there were no bones in the huge pits, the dark energy emitted from them allowed Qin Yu to guess the origins of these nine huge pits.

“Could this be a burial?”Qin Yu frowned.

The construction of this sacred mausoleum was extremely extravagant. In addition to these few huge pits, Qin Yu speculated that the owner of this tomb might have been some high official back then.

“A burial pit. Generally speaking, there won’t be any babe in this pit. It’s better to stay away from him,”Lu Yun reminded.

Qin Yu glanced at him and nodded slightly.

This burial pit was an ominous thing to them and could not be contaminated. However, to Qin Yu, it was a place of cultivation.

After going around the burial pit, there was a huge stone door in front of them.

There was a dense mist on the stone door that fell down like a waterfall. It looked extremely mysterious.

Lu Yun and Lu Guan stood in front of the door and did not approach it for a long time.

“What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu asked.

Lu Yun said in a deep voice, “After all, this is the sacred mausoleum where the ancient sages are buried. We don’t dare to move forward rashly.”

“I originally wanted to use your disciples to explore the way, but you didn’t allow it,”Lu Guan said unhappily.

Qin Yu glanced at them and snorted, “You’re from the Holy Region. Don’t you have any treasures to explore?”

“No,”Lu Yun said straightforwardly.

“Let me do it,”Chang Mang said.

Qin Yu pulled Chang Mang back and said, “Let me do it.”

Although Chang Mang’s body was very strong, he was still far from Qin Yu’s current body.

A green glow emanated from his body, and the true body of Greenwood enveloped his physical body.

This was the tomb of ancient sages after all, and even Qin Yu did not dare to neglect it.

He carefully walked to the door and extended his palm, preparing to open it.

But at this moment, rays of light shot out from the door, heading straight for Qin Yu’s physical body.

At such a close distance, even if Qin Yu stepped on the ‘xing’character, he wouldn’t be able to dodge it!

“Bang!”

With this attack, Qin Yu was sent flying backward, and a bloody hole appeared in his chest.

“Hu”

In the sacred mausoleum, it was as if a gentle breeze blew past, and streams of dark energy spread out.

This dark energy was different from normal dark energy. This energy covered his body and was actually absorbing everyone’s spiritual energy!

“Not good! The thing I was most worried about happened!”Lu Yun’s face changed drastically.

Qin Yu could also feel the loss of spiritual power in his body, but he was not too anxious. Instead, he asked, “What’s going on?”

Lu Yun explained, “This is called internal Qi. It usually appears in the graves of the top people! This aura will absorb the spiritual power of cultivators. Once the spiritual power is completely absorbed, it will absorb the lifespan!”

“So Scary?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but turn pale with fright! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even the lifespan could be absorbed? Then wouldn’t it age very quickly here?

“Do you have any countermeasures?”Qin Yu looked at the two of them and asked.

Lu Yun said in a deep voice, “The corresponding thing with internal qi is called life qi. We can only use life qi to offset this internal Qi. Unfortunately, we don’t have this thing with us.”

“Let’s retreat first. Otherwise, we will all die of old age here.”Lu Guan had the intention to retreat and turned to leave.

However, Qin Yu was somewhat unwilling.

The Sacred Mausoleum was the tomb of an ancient sage. Who knew how many Babe would be hidden inside.

Now that the holy region was about to open, if they didn’t enter the sacred mausoleum today, they might not have another chance in the future.

“You guys go out first. I’ll go in and take a look,”Qin Yu said.

“According to the speed of the disappearance of spiritual power, I should be able to enter and exit safely.”

Lu Guan couldn’t help but sneer, “You think too simply. If it were so simple, we wouldn’t be so afraid.”

“What do you mean?”Qin Yu frowned.

Lu Guan said indifferently, “This is only the gate of the Holy Mausoleum. The Twilight Qi will naturally not be too strong, but as we go deeper into the holy mausoleum, the Twilight Qi will become thicker and thicker.”

“The loss of your spiritual power is not worth mentioning, but every step you take will increase your speed. After a few steps, your spiritual power and longevity will be completely absorbed.”

Qin Yu frowned. Lu Guan’s words really gave Qin Yu a headache.

However, the sacred mausoleum was right in front of him. It was a huge treasure. It was really unsatisfying to give it up just like that.

If he could get a holy weapon or something from it, he would be rich.

“I still want to give it a try.”After hesitating for a while, Qin Yu didn’t listen to him in the end.

He walked towards the door step by step and soon arrived at the door.

“Humph, you don’t know life from death.”Lu Guan couldn’t help but sneer.
