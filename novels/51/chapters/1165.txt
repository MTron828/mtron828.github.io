Chapter 1166: Chapter 1,166, dead 

Looking at the palm that was slapping at him, Gu Xinghe’s face instantly turned cold.

“You’re Shameless!”A strong killing intent radiated from Gu Xinghe’s eyes. Then, he suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Zhai Xing’s wrist!

Although Zhai Xing was at the advanced stage of the Martial Saint Realm, he was completely powerless in front of a mighty figure!

No matter how he struggled, he was unable to break free!

“Zhai Xing, you actually want to kill me?”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Zhai Xing looked at Gu Xinghe with a face full of anger and roared angrily, “Gu Xinghe, you killed so many innocent people. Don’t you deserve to die!”

“Innocent people?”Gu Xinghe was instantly even more furious.

“You actually want to kill me for these lowly people? I’ve called you uncle for so many years in vain!”

Before he could finish his sentence, Gu Xinghe suddenly exerted force with his palm. With a “Kacha”sound, Zhai Xing’s wrist was directly crushed into meat paste!

“Ah! !”

Zhai Xing held onto his bleeding arm and retreated backwards.

“Zhai Xing, I can give you another chance. As long as you’re willing to kill them, I can spare you,”Gu Xinghe said indifferently.

At this moment, Su Qi reminded him, “Young master Gu, a person like him can never be changed. Keeping him alive will only bring disaster. Otherwise, why would he be entangled with Qin Yu?”

Gu Xinghe rubbed his chin and nodded, “You’re right... then let him die.”

After saying that, Gu Xinghe extended his palm and slapped Zhai Xing’s chest!

With this palm strike, Zhai Xing’s body and primordial spirit were instantly shattered.

His body fell straight to the ground, instantly stirring up a hundred thousand feet of dust.

Zhai Xing fell just like that.

Gu Xinghe looked coldly at Zhai Xing’s corpse, his eyes faintly filled with anger.

“Why do you have to go against my will...”Gu Xinghe muttered in a low voice.

“Even the uncle who watched me grow up betrays me. It’s really... infuriating!”

A cold killing intent radiated from his body. This killing intent enveloped the earth and the temperature dropped.

“Let’s go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“Alright.”Su Qi picked up Zhai Xing’s corpse and rushed towards the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Within the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

The Pavilion Master who had gone to look for the Dao Protector had returned in failure.

She had searched everywhere that the Dao Protector had gone back then, but she still could not find any traces of the Dao Protector.

“Damn it, what Bullshit Dao Protector! He has seen so many people die, yet he is nowhere to be seen. What kind of Dao Protector can he be!”Chang Mang could not help but curse loudly as he threw his head back and roared angrily.

The expression of the pavilion master by the side was a little ugly, but she did not say anything this time.

“I can not stand by and watch so many innocent people die at Gu Xinghe’s hands...”Chang Mang clenched his teeth, the muscles all over his body tensing.

Yao Meng opened her mouth and was about to say something when Chang Mang said coldly, “Yao Meng, it’s best if you don’t say anything. Everyone has their own choices. I respect you, so please respect me.”

Hearing this, Yao Meng was instantly speechless.

“Since brother Chang has already made up his mind, then respect him,”Xiao Yuan said indifferently.

Yao Meng also knew that she could no longer stop Chang Mang, so she could only retreat to the side.

Chang Mang’s eyes were scarlet red. He carried a monstrous anger and planned to go and fight with Gu Xinghe.

However, at this moment, Gu Xinghe’s figure appeared above them.

With his hands behind his back, he quietly looked down at everyone and said with a faint smile, “Everyone, how have you been?”

“Gu Xinghe!”The moment he saw Gu Xinghe, Chang Mang’s entire body immediately trembled!

Gu Xinghe completely ignored Chang Mang. He extended his palm and Zhai Xing’s corpse was thrown down from the sky.

“Zhai... Zhai Xing?”When they saw the corpse on the ground, everyone’s expression immediately changed!

Chang Mang even ran over quickly. He shook Zha Xing’s corpse with all his might and raised his palm to send spiritual Qi to it.

Unfortunately, Zha Xing could not be any more dead. Even Spiritual Qi could not enter his body.

“Gu Xinghe! You Damn Bastard!”After Chang Mang shouted, his body shot toward Gu Xinghe from the ground like a cannonball!

His entire body seemed to have turned into a scarlet cannonball as he charged towards Gu Xinghe!

This punch contained the grievances and anger that Chang Mang had been feeling for many days! The more he fought, the braver his holy body became. Even Gu Xinghe did not dare to ignore this punch.

He snorted coldly and his palm turned into a hand knife as he slashed towards Chang Mang!

However, what shocked everyone was that the light formed by the hand knife disappeared the moment it touched Chang Mang. It did not cause even the slightest ripple!

“Eh?”Gu Xinghe frowned slightly. Before he could react, Chang Mang’s fist had already closed in on him!

“Bang!”

With a loud bang, power exploded on Gu Xinghe’s body!

His face was instantly fractured and his body shot backward!

When everyone saw this, they were all shocked!

Chang Mang actually had such terrifying power? After all, not to mention a martial saint, even an ordinary almighty could not hurt Gu Xinghe!

“You... are courting death!”Gu Xinghe was instantly enraged!

This was already the second time he had been defeated by Chang Mang! To Gu Xinghe, this was simply an insult!

Chang Mang’s face was interwoven with coldness and anger. The scarlet light around his body was still spreading.

“You Bastard!”Chang Mang said coldly.

Gu Xinghe suppressed the anger in his heart and said coldly, “I did swear that I wouldn’t kill you, but I didn’t say that I wouldn’t cripple you. Kid, you’ve completely angered me!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“F * ck you!”Chang Mang didn’t waste any more words and charged at Gu Xinghe again.
