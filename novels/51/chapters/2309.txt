2310 The Self-Formed Space

The eyes flashed past, and he found nothing else when he came back to his senses and looked again.

“Hurry up and finish collecting the Sumeru qi before going back.”

Qin Yu dared not stir up any trouble. This ninth level was filled with a strange atmosphere.

Qin Yu slowly approached the Sumeru qi, and a cracking sound came from underneath his feet.

He lowered his head and saw that he had stepped on a skeleton.

It was unknown how many years the skeleton had endured. Qin Yu stepped on it lightly, and it crumbled to dust directly.

Qin Yu suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.

He clearly did not find anything when his divine sense scanned the place just now, but why did he step on such a skeleton?

Suppressing the uneasiness in his heart, Qin Yu continued to move forward.

When he took another step forward, something unsettling happened again. Qin Yu actually stepped on another corpse.

It was unknown what cultivation this corpse had. Qin Yu’s stepping actually did not crush it, and after so many years, the corpse did not decay.

“What the f*ck is going on?”

Qin Yu was almost scared to tears by this strange scene. Nothing was in front of him, regardless of divine sense or his eyes.

However, when his feet landed, the original appearance would be revealed.

At this moment, weeds seven to eight meters tall were underneath his feet.

There was a bottomless ravine on the ground, and within a meter of this footstep, there were three to four corpses and skeletons.

He took another step in, and it was the same. Almost every step he took was full of corpses.

Qin Yu was scared out of his wits. It was very likely that these people had died because of this Sumeru qi.

In other words, there was bound to be a terrifying existence here.

There was no turning back here. Qin Yu pushed his defenses to the limit.

Then, he took another step forward relentlessly and arrived in front of the Sumeru qi.

He stretched out his right hand, and the Sumeru qi in the ring came out under his divine sense.

It frantically fused with the Sumeru qi in the air, and then the Sumeru qi that had expanded countless times entered the Sumeru ring.

The entire Sumeru ring vibrated gently, and countless spatial lines danced in the ring.

The sound akin to glass shattering rang out in the space. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The spatial wall continued to shatter, and the Sumeru Space expanded outward.

The Sumeru qi constantly replenished the sky, the grass, the forest, and the swamps.

Flying birds and animals even slowly appeared.

“This should be what the Sumeru ring looked like at the beginning!”

Feeling the earth-shattering change, Qin Yu was extremely shocked.

After an unknown duration, the spatial wall of the Sumeru ring finally reached its peak and could no longer expand.

However, compared to previously, the space had already increased by three times!

It had become an extremely exaggerated space.

Moreover, as the Sumeru qi continued to enter, Qin Yu felt the Way of Space was continuously perfecting.

This space began to solidify and become firm.

The spatial qi differed in different continents. For example, breaking the space in Nanzhou consumed less spiritual power than in Zhongzhou.

At this moment, as the Sumeru qi entered, the space in the Sumeru ring had already condensed to the utmost.

Perhaps even a Tribulation Transcending cultivator could not break through this world.

“Boom!”

With the Sumeru ring on Qin Yu’s right index finger as the center, a transparent space suddenly spread out.

In this space, all the dao techniques and rules seemed to have been pushed out in an instant.

In an instant, the space returned to the ring.

“This Sumeru qi is really terrifying. After absorbing this internal qi, the Sumeru ring has completely undergone earth-shattering changes. No wonder it’s so precious.”

Qin Yu was incomparably shocked. This ring seemed to have become a world.

That was a level that only the Immortal Emperor could achieve!

“Qin Yu, the Sumeru ring seems to have reached its limit.”

Elder Guai reminded Qin Yu.

“Alright!”

At this moment, two-thirds of the Sumeru qi had been absorbed, and Qin Yu also dared not be greedy.

He withdrew his right hand and slowly left.

“He actually collected so much Sumeru qi. This kid should have a spatial supreme treasure on him. I want this.”

The moment Gu Baiyi sensed the spatial qi, she stood up, somewhat losing her composure.

“If I’m not wrong, that spatial artifact has already become a world. I didn’t expect this kid to have such a treasure. I want it.” Yan Minglong also looked interested.

“I say, the two of you. He’s just got his opportunity, and you’re already distributing his magical artifact here. No matter what, he’s still a human cultivator. Is this appropriate?”

Jiang Qingyuan smiled and shook his head.

“Hehe, this kind of magical artifact will definitely play a greater role in the hands of the outside world. We’re not here for personal reasons. Otherwise, why have we been here for tens of thousands of years?”

Yan Minglong said somewhat gloomily.

“Sigh.” Jiang Qingyuan sighed slightly.

“We can take it after he dies, and it won’t be considered robbery anymore. A few living beings around him have prepared to attack,” Gu Baiyi stared at Qin Yu and said.

The moment Qin Yu turned around, a human corpse on the ground suddenly stood up.

A moment ago, he was still a lifeless corpse, but in the next moment, he became a great cultivator who looked down on the world.

A layer of strange white light flowed on the surface of his body, and the violent internal qi on his body directly pushed Qin Yu dozens of meters away.

“Star Seal!”

Qin Yu crossed the two fingers on his hands and used his divine sense to activate the power of the stars in the sky.

In the next moment, the giant star was pushed toward the corpse.

“Boom!”

The Star Seal hit the cultivator but merely pushed him back a certain distance.

Some cracks appeared on his body, but as the layer of light spun, his body was quickly repaired.

He grasped at the star, and a bright stream of spiritual energy blasted into the star from the corpse.

The star actually turned into countless crushed stones. With a light grasp, it broke Qin Yu’s Star Seal.

After that, the corpse stomped on the ground and raised his palm high.

Suddenly, lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled in the sky. The Great Dao qi constructed by countless dense white lights seemed to have been summoned.

It suddenly disappeared into his palm, and in an instant, the palm of the corpse emitted a rainbow-like light.

Traces of tribulation qi emitted from it!

A terrifying internal qi locked onto Qin Yu, almost suffocating him.

“F*ck! This corpse can even use the Great Dao of heaven and earth.”

Qin Yu was scared out of his wits. The strength of the wandering souls he encountered earlier was completely incomparable to this corpse.

This corpse still retained the fighting instincts of his previous life, and he was at least a Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator.

Being locked down by that tribulation qi, Qin Yu could not move at all.

In an instant, he used Suo Lin’s shield to block before him.
