Chapter 2761 - 2761: The Curse of the Alester Family

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Towards the end, he was relying on his own will to fight. What surprised him was that the woman was even suppressing him with her physical strength.

If it wasn’t for his ruthlessly blocking her, Qin Yu would have been hammered into a meat patty long ago.

By the time he opened his eyes, another ten days had passed.

He went back to his room. When he got up, he saw that Alester was still in the familiar corner.

“Thanks…”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he finally spoke slowly.

“I had a great time too.”

Lord Alester stood up.

“Can you tell me your relationship with that woman? Don’t skip anything.”

Lord Alester suddenly asked.

“Why do you want to know?”

“I want to understand the woman Heavenly Sin has his eyes on. If you have any

questions, I will answer you in return.”

Qin Yu wanted to refuse, but he suddenly wanted to confide at this moment.

He still had hope of finding Ruoxue before this. However, after witnessing Heavenly Sin’s power, he fell into despair.

“Tell me first. If I want to pursue her, do I have a chance…”

Qin Yu’s voice was very soft. “Defeat me first.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

He sorted out his chaotic thoughts and recounted everything since he met Yan Ruoxue.

He didn’t know when, but his face was covered in tears.

He just wanted to be with the girl he liked. Why did the heavens have to play a joke on him every time?

He had missed Yan Ruoxue time and time again because of her bloodline. In the end, he even encountered a heaven-defying power like Heavenly Sin.

“Is she still alive?”

Qin Yu raised his head and asked.

“Heavenly Sin was born from the resentment of the previous battle. The gathering of the powerful resentment of the divine artifact, the Divine Stele of Disorder formed it. His will was to kill all the sinners of the past. The stronger the sinner, the more the power of Heavenly Sin would descend. That girl’s bloodline is very strong, which is why she made the true form of Heavenly Sin to descend.”

Lord Alester didn’t answer Qin Yu’s question directly. Instead, she introduced the source of Heavenly Sin.

“For a sinner like her, she won’t die if she doesn’t suffer. As long as her will remains unyielding, she won’t die. However, it’s better than death.”

“Thank you for telling me the truth.”

Qin Yu said softly.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

His teeth bit into his tongue. A sweet stream of blood flowed down his throat.

He was filled with unwillingness, but there was nothing he could do.

It was like a young man who had lost helplessly to essential items for daily living.

“At least you guys are lucky. At least you have a goal. As for me, I don’t even have a goal.”

Lord Alester said calmly. She didn’t care if Qin Yu was listening or not and directly told him the story.

“The Alester family is the strongest in the world of Saint. Almost all the direct descendants of the family can reach the realm of Holy Consciousness, which is the peak of Saint Level. In the Alester family, some people have become the Holy Lord and the number one person in the world. However, no one has been able to advance further.”

Qin Yu listened in silence.

What a terrifying family! As long as one had a direct bloodline, one could grow to such a level.

Why was Lord Alester so unwilling to accept such a born power?

“The ancestors of the Alester family have tried countless methods. Some have reached the extreme of body refinement, some have cultivated their divine sense to the extreme, some have become Holy Lords, and some have entered the next generation of cultivation. They even tried to combine different bloodlines to break through this restriction. However, no matter how they tried, the limit of the Alester family is the Saint Level.”

Lord Alester looked down. Her long golden hair covered her entire face.

“Isn’t it ridiculous? The heavens have given us great power, but they have also added a set of shackles. I’ve been in this realm for a hundred years since I was born. It’s only a matter of time before I reach the peak of the Saint Realm. However, this is already my limit. I’ll slowly grow old in the boring secular world for a long time. I entered Heavenly Sin this time because I wanted to see so for myself the power above the Saint Realm. Or rather. I want to die in

Heavenly Sin. It’ll be more interesting this way.”

She smiled.

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

Perhaps there would not be so many regrets when one reached the peak after exhausting almost all of one’s lifespan.

However, Lord Alester was a top genius among her people. Her predecessors had also marked all the paths of cultivation with a red cross.

It was even difficult for her to choose a path.

Qin Yu asked after a long silence.

“Is this the restriction between the Saint World and the Divine Realm? Maybe this is why the Alester family is in such a state. When I logged into the Saint World in the mortal world, I once saw countless huge chains locking down. If it wasn’t for the Dao Mystical Saint using the power of Saint Kingdom to blast open a hole, I’m afraid we wouldn’t have been able to come up either. Is the power of the Divine Realm the same?”

“The restriction does exist, but there is no lack of people who can break through it. However, no one in the family has been able to break through the limit of the Divine Realm since the Supreme of Divine Land’s time. Therefore, it should have nothing to do with the power of the restriction. This is just a curse that cannot be undone.”

Lord Alester calmly talked about her matter as if it had nothing to do with her.

“I just hope to die under a powerful force. I don’t want to live a decadent life until I die under Five Declines of Celestial Beings.”

Qin Yu finally understood why Lord Alester had always had that indifferent expression. Perhaps for someone like her who was obsessed with cultivation, she was already dead.

She had a cultivation path which was obviously could not be broken through. She had also reached the peak of her cultivation.

This was undoubtedly a cruel blow to a genius.

“Hey, do you have that ‘Realm’ talisman? Give me one.”

Qin Yu said lightly.

Lord Alester was a little puzzled, but she still threw a Realm Talisman at Qin Yu.

“My current cultivation realm is much lower than yours, right?” “Yes, that’s right. You haven’t even cultivated the peak power yet.”

Lord Alester nodded calmly.

“Then let me tell you what the limit is. What kind of genius do you think you are? Do you think it’s the end after cultivating for a hundred years? Even the limits of the Holy Consciousness Realm are far from what you can see, Lord Alester!”

The ‘Realm’ talisman was ignited and they were pulled into the barrier space again.

The entire barrier space emitted a hurricane-like internal qi. A thousand-meter-long scythe appeared in Qin Yu’s hand.

Death Dance!

The scythe in front of him flashed. In an instant, the entire space was left with the trajectory of the scythe.

A tornado rushed up from the spot and tore the entire barrier apart.

A terrifying power descended. This was a power that could defeat Heavenly Sin. In an instant, countless layers of space were torn apart, directly separating them into two layers.

“Hey! Don’t be too narcissistic, Lord Alester. You should beat me before you

die..”
