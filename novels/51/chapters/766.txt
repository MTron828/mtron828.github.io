Chapter 767: The Guardians Automatically Resurrected! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This picture looked ordinary and didn’t have the slightest spiritual energy fluctuation. It didn’t look like an unworldly spiritual artifact at all.

“What is this thing?” When everyone saw this picture, they couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Has Qin Yu gone mad? He wants to use this piece of shabby paper to resist the power of a Martial Saint?”

“Haha, this must be a desperate attempt This is simply madness.”

The surrounding taunts flooded in like a tide. Everyone thought that Qin Yu was crazy.

Even Granny Qin’s face showed a rare smile.

“Just wait and see.” Only the man with the mustache sneered.

He stared at the picture and sneered. “These idiots, of course they don’t know what treasure this is. The power of a Martial Saint? That’s nothing!”

Just as everyone was laughing, the picture suddenly flashed with a strange light!

Then, waves of terrifying and gloomy internal qi surged out!

In an instant, the surrounding temperature suddenly dropped! It was extremely cold!

“Eh? What’s going on?” For a moment, everyone had a strange look on their faces!

At this moment, the black energy in Blackie’s hand had already smashed over and collided with the picture!

At the instant of the collision, a shocking thing happened!

The picture flashed with light and directly swallowed the black energy!

This extremely violent energy didn’t even stir up a single wave.

It was like a piece of shabby stone falling into the sea, unable to stir up even a single wave!

Waves of ancient and simple aura spread out from the picture.

A divine might roamed the entire Qinggang Mountain!

This internal qi was like the might of an emperor, making people involuntarily want to worship it!

“This... What’s going on?” Everyone gaasped!

What exactly was that picture? It was actually so strange?!

Blackie’s expression was extremely unsightly! As if he had gone mad, waves of resplendent power burst out from his hands, smashing fiercely towards the picture!

However, all the energy was easily absorbed by the picture and there wasn’t the slightest ripple!

“How... how could this be!” Blackie’s expression was extremely unsightly and his body couldn’t help but take two steps back!

“How could this kid have such a treasure?” Granny Qin’s eyes were also widened!

Such a strange treasure was simply unheard of!

Everyone was dumbstruck, and only the man with the mustache sneered repeatedly.

“A bunch of idiots. This is the item of the masked woman.” The man with the mustache sneered.

“If Qin Yu could activate this painting, not to mention a Martial Saint, even a Mighty Realm powerhouse would have to die!”

Qin Yu’s expression was also somewhat unnatural.

He had never thought that this painting would be so powerful.

The power of a Martial Saint was actually nothing in front of it.

“Little b*stard!” At this moment, Granny Qin suddenly shouted!

“You dared to use a spiritual artifact? This is a violation!” Granny Qin said angrily.

Qin Yu sneered. “Violation? Then, is it a violation if this Heaven Swallowing Python borrows the power of others?”

“Nonsense!” Granny Qin shouted.

“What evidence do you have to say that Blackie borrowed the power of others?”

Qin Yu sneered. “Evidence? He was beaten like a dog by me just now. Are you blind!?”

“If he didn’t borrow the strength of others, he would have been beaten into a pile of meat paste by me!”

Granny Qin said sinisterly, “Nonsense! Little b*stard, if I don’t teach you a lesson, you will never repent!”

After saying that, Granny Qin actually jumped up before rushing towards Qin Yu with big steps! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Shameless old b*stard!” Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse loudly!

“Boom!”

At this moment.

A strange loud sound suddenly emitted from Qin Yu’s body!

This loud sound instantly caused Qin Yu to frown.

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

“Boom!”

There was another loud sound!

This time, the sound seemed to be even louder!

Even Granny Qin heard this strange sound.

She stopped and frowned. “What sound was that?”

“Boom!”

There was another loud sound!

This time, the sound was even louder, almost reaching everyone’s ears!

“Crack!”

Following that, there was an explosive sound!

Then, they saw many treasures drop from Qin Yu’s body!

Among them were the bronze sword and the power of creation!

“What’s going on?!” Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

He hurriedly shouted, “Man with the mustache, put the things away!”

“Don’t worry, this is my specialty.” The man with the mustache rolled up its sleeves and flew out with a swoosh.

At this moment, Qin Yu realized that his Spatial Magic Artifact had shattered!

“How... how could this be?” Qin Yu frowned tightly!

At this moment, another strange sound came from the Spatial Magic Artifact.

Then, two figures shot out from the Spatial Magic Artifact!

And these two figures were none other than the two guardians, Burly and Robust!

“What... What’s going on?” Qin Yu’s eyes widened!

Looking at the two guardians standing in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but swallow hard.

He tried to release his divine sense to control these two guardians.

But soon, Qin Yu realized that something was wrong.

His divine sense couldn’t connect with these two guardians at all!

“Oh no!” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

He suddenly thought of something!

“These two guardians... were resurrected on their own!” Qin Yu was terrified!

He recalled the scene back at the Immortal Slaying Sect. Back then, these two guardians were resurrected on their own and almost took Qin Yu’s life!

If not for the masked woman’s clothes suppressing them, Qin Yu would have probably turned into a skeleton by now!

At this moment, the two guardians were emitting waves of pressure. The guardians who resurrected on their own were obviously more powerful!

Compared to Qin Yu, the current guardians were unimaginably strong!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly looked around and shouted, “Everyone, run! Run!”

But how could they know the urgency of the matter? They were even more unaware of how terrifying this guardian was!

“What, you want to admit defeat?” Yan Jinyao sneered.

“So be it. Don’t even think about sending us away.”

“That’s right! You want us to leave now? In your dreams!”

Qin Yu couldn’t wait any longer. He knew how terrifying these two guardians were!

They were resurrected on their own and weren’t under anyone’s control!

In other words, they would attack indiscriminately! Because in their eyes, everyone was an enemy!

“Hehe, little b*stard, you brought out these two corpses again?” Granny Qin said with a sinister tone.

At this moment, she didn’t know that these two corpses had automatically resurrected. She thought that Qin Yu was controlling them.

“Using the same move twice will be useless. Don’t you know?” Granny Qin shouted loudly.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and didn’t know how to explain for a moment.

“Forget it, it’s up to you.” Qin Yu took two steps back.

Granny Qin flipped her palm and a Martial Saint weapon appeared in her hand.

“This time, I came with a Martial Saint weapon. I’m afraid your two corpses will lose their effect!” Granny Qin shouted.
