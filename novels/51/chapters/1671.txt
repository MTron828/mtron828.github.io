Zhuo jing nodded and said, “Okay, I will act according to the situation.”

Then, Qin Yu took a deep breath. He withstood this strong pressure and took the lead to walk into the dragon burial cave. Zhuo Jing followed closely behind.

The scene in the dragon burial cave was exactly the same as what Qin Yu had seen with his divine sense. It was pitch-black and extremely fishy. It was as if he had stepped into hell, extremely terrifying.

Qin Yu was extremely careful, as if he was treading on thin ice. This scene had already appeared in his mind thousands of times. At this moment, it was still extremely difficult and careful to walk.

The surroundings were silent, so quiet that it made people feel afraid.

Qin Yu was extremely nervous because the scene that he had seen with his divine sense was too terrifying. It had been erased in just an instant. This was definitely a heaven-reaching method!

The journey was very smooth. Qin Yu tried to open his desolate God’s eye to find the location of the dragon corpse.

Under the probing of the desolate God’s eye, Qin Yu quickly discovered the dragon corpse!

The dragon corpse was extremely huge and lifelike. Every dragon scale had a dark glow!

Even though it was lying on the ground, the powerful pressure was suffocating!

“It’s... Real!”Qin Yu was both surprised and happy!

The dragon corpse lay in front of him, making it impossible for people to suppress the excitement in their hearts!

“Swoosh!”At this moment, a black figure flashed past Qin Yu. Its speed was shocking. Even Qin Yu did not have time to see anything before he was sent flying!

A bloody hole appeared on his chest, and blood was gushing out.

This bloody hole had actually pierced through Qin Yu’s body, from his chest to his back!

“Qin Yu!”

Zhuo Jing’s expression immediately changed, and he hurriedly walked up!

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at the wound on his chest, and his expression became increasingly grave.

“Did you see what it was just now?”Qin Yu asked.

Zhuo Jing shook his head and said, “There was only a flash of a black shadow. I didn’t even see clearly if it was a human or not.”

With that, he took out the Silver Spring and looked around vigilantly.

Qin Yu touched his chest and felt extremely terrified!

It was just a flash, but it directly pierced through his virtual entity body. How terrifying was that? He didn’t dare to imagine it!

Qin Yu circulated his meridian circulation technique and slowly restored his body.

He sat there, not moving for a long time. No one knew what he was thinking about.

“Qin Yu, why don’t we leave? Although the Dragon Corpse is tempting, it has to be alive,”Zhuo Jing said in a low voice.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “That’s strange...”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhuo Jing asked from the side.

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at the ground and said, “Yesterday, that strand of divine sense of mine walked for a long time before it was killed by that Black Shadow. And there is still a long distance between here and there.”

“Normally, the time when this black shadow appeared is still early...”

Qin Yu couldn’t figure it out. Could it be that this strand of divine sense appeared immediately?

If that was the case, it would be too terrifying!

“It’s better to leave quickly. I’ve heard rumors that no matter how strong a cultivator is, once they step into the Dragon Burial Cave and the immortal burial valley, they will only die,”Zhuo Jing said with a frown.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. No one knew what he was thinking.

At this moment, Zhuo Jing already had the intention to retreat. He held the Silver Spring tightly and looked around vigilantly. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

But even so, Zhuo Jing still felt extremely uneasy.

Because he knew that once that Black Shadow appeared again, there was no use for them to do anything.

“Qin Yu, think carefully. That Black Shadow just attacked your chest. What if it was your head? I’m afraid you’ve already become a corpse!”Zhuo Jing berated.

After Zhuo Jing’s reminder, Qin Yu also felt some lingering fear.

This body of his dominated the entire South Province, but in front of this black shadow, it couldn’t withstand a single blow and shattered with a single touch.

He only had one life, and Qin Yu definitely did not dare to take such a risk.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and carefully recalled the scene just now.

He wanted to pry into the true mask of that Black Shadow, but unfortunately, no matter how much Qin Yu thought about it, there was only a flash of the scene in his mind.

“Qin Yu, listen to my advice and quickly leave!”Zhuo Jing said somewhat anxiously.

Qin Yu glanced at Zhuo Jing, and a thought seemed to have appeared in his mind.

“Hurry up and leave!”Seeing this, Zhuo Jing immediately flew into a rage.

Without waiting for further explanation, he grabbed Qin Yu and turned around to leave.

Qin Yu was helpless. He could only drag his injured body and temporarily leave the dragon burial cave with Zhuo Jing.

After leaving the dragon burial cave, Zhuo Jing clearly heaved a sigh of relief.

He wiped the sweat from his forehead and collapsed on the ground, saying, “But I was scared out of My Wits. I don’t know why, but from the moment I stepped into the Dragon Burial Cave, my heart trembled, and my chest felt like it was being pressed by a huge rock.”

Qin Yu lay on the ground with his eyes slightly closed, slowly recovering his body.

For some reason, when he saw Qin Yu close his eyes, a bad premonition arose in table Jing’s heart.

He walked to Qin Yu and said, “I’m telling you, no matter what, you have to listen to me this time. Don’t even think about going into the dragon burial cave again!”

Qin Yu smiled embarrassedly and said, “Don’t worry, don’t worry. I promise I won’t go in!”

Table Jing snorted lightly. He sat beside Qin Yu and said, “When your injury recovers a little, we will leave this place.”

“Okay!”Qin Yu nodded hard. It was unknown whether he was telling the truth or not.

He lowered his head and looked at his chest. Blood was still oozing out from his chest.

There seemed to be some black marks on the edge of the wound.

Qin Yu stretched out his finger and gently pressed down a trace of black. Then, he put it on the tip of his nose and sniffed.

A foul smell assaulted his nose.

“What... Is this thing?”Qin Yu frowned.

The foul stench seemed to emanate from the corpse, and it was extremely pungent.

“Could it be... that it’s a corpse that attacked?”Qin Yu muttered softly.

The dragon corpse that had been silent for countless years, no one could guarantee that it would not breed any evil, much less know how powerful it was.

At least from the looks of it now, it was definitely not something Qin Yu could resist.

“I have a bad feeling. Let’s leave quickly.”Zhuo Jing suddenly frowned. He pulled Qin Yu along and planned to leave.

Not only Zhuo Jing, Qin Yu also felt a trace of unease in his heart.

He nodded, stood up, and planned to leave.

But at this moment, a strong killing intent assaulted his face!

This aura was extremely terrifying, and there was more than one internal Qi!

“Not good!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly stood up.

However, a sudden pain came from his wound, causing him to almost kneel on the ground!

“Weng!”

A Ray of light was emitted from all directions. ... pairs of eyes appeared one after another!

Their bodies were not big, but they looked extremely strange. Their eyes revealed an ice-cold gaze that made people shudder.

At a glance, the surroundings were so dense that one could not see the end!

“What... What is This!”Zhuo Jing grabbed the Silver Spring, a trace of fear on his face.
