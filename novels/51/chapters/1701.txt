“I don’t know,”Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

Man with the mustache didn’t say anything. He pointed to the distance and said, “Come, go further away.”

“Go further away?”Qin Yu was stunned.

“Aiya, just listen to me. Hurry up and go further away,”man with the mustache pushed Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Then how far do we have to walk?”

“En… a few hundred miles, or even a little further,”man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu only felt that it was baffling, but he didn’t think too much about it. He immediately followed man with the mustache’s request and stepped on the line word formula, shooting out a few hundred miles.

Standing at a position of a few hundred miles, Qin Yu’s frown became even more tightly.

He couldn’t figure out why the Mustache Man with the mustache wanted him to do this.

Just as Qin Yu was puzzled, the Mustache Man with the mustache’s voice suddenly came from his ear.

“Qin Yu, you are a big idiot!”

The voice was extremely clear, as if it was right beside his ear!

Qin Yu hurriedly looked around and shouted, “Where are you?”

“You must be guessing where I am, right? Haha, I didn’t move at all. This is the effect of my loudspeaker!”Man with the Mustache Man said proudly.

Sichuan voice speaker? It was the broken speaker that man with the mustache held in his hand?

That broken speaker actually had such an effect?

Qin Yu hurriedly returned to man with the mustache’s side. He took the speaker and muttered, “Is this speaker really that good?”

“Do you think I’m lying to you? I spent nine oxen and two Tigers to get this voice speaker. Today, I used it to exchange for Dragon Blood with you. Speaking of which, I still feel that it’s a bit of a loss,”man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu played with the loudspeaker and asked with some doubt, “How far can this thing travel? And what exactly is its use?”

“I don’t know how far it is, but it’s very useful!”Man with the mustache said.

“Think about it. Standing hundreds of miles away and cursing, and no one knows where you are, isn’t that cool?”Man with the mustache said with a smile.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but roll his eyes.

He didn’t think it was cool, but the loudspeaker did have its uses.

“How about it? Do you want to change?”Man with the mustache urged.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “I can change, but you have to find me a dark energy grave for my cultivation.”

“Aiya, no problem. Leave it to me!”Man with the mustache immediately drew a coordinate with his finger.

“It’s here. Go,”man with the mustache said with a somewhat unreliable tone.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “You wouldn’t lie to me, would you?”

“When have I ever lied to anyone?”Man with the Mustache Glared at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu thought for a moment. He had no other choice at the moment, so he might as well believe him.

Thus, Qin Yu took out a jar of dragon blood from the spatial magic artifact.

Looking at the jar of Dragon Blood, man with the mustache’s eyes widened.

“You F * cking have so much dragon blood?”Man with the mustache couldn’t help but be stunned.

Even though he had robbed countless tombs, he was still extremely shocked at this moment.

Then, man with the mustache reached out to take the jar.

Qin Yu slapped his hand away and rolled his eyes. “We agreed to only give you one drop.”

Qin Yu took out a drop of dragon blood from the jar and gave it to man with the mustache.

Man with the mustache sniffed it and said excitedly, “Is it really dragon blood? Where did you get it?”

“Didn’t I tell you about the Dragon Burial Cave?”Qin Yu said.

“I can tell you the location of the Dragon Burial Cave. It’s in the East Wilderness of the South Province. But I have to advise you that once you step into the East Wilderness, you will be cursed by the Upper East Wilderness and may die at any time,”Qin Yu reminded him.

Man with the mustache nodded repeatedly and said, “The place outside the dragon burial cave is definitely extremely dangerous. Don’t worry, I Won’t be going there for a while.”

Then, man with the mustache rubbed his arm against Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, look at how much dragon blood you have. Can you give me more?”

“No. We agreed on one drop, so it’s one drop. A gentleman can’t go back on his word.”Qin Yu put away the jar without any mercy.

Man with the mustache pursed his lips and muttered, “So stingy.”

“Don’t talk nonsense. You haven’t given me the Babe from the desolate grave before,”Qin Yu said with some displeasure.

Man with the mustache began to play dumb when this topic was brought up.

“Oh right, you should have heard about the South Province and the northern lands, right?”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly remembered.

Man with the mustache sneered and said, “What Bullsh * t South Province and northern lands? I’ve never had such a concept in my eyes.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth. Just as he was about to speak, the void in front of him suddenly trembled!

Waves spread out in all directions. In just a moment, two figures walked out from the void.

These two people were tall and imposing. Their strength was immeasurable!

“You are indeed here!”

The two men with the mustache looked at the man with the mustache in front of them and shouted angrily.

The man with the mustache’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “Damn, they caught up so quickly. Qin Yu, I’ll leave First!”

After saying that, his feet shook, and a formation actually appeared in front of him!

Man with the mustache’s body quickly entered the formation, and in the blink of an eye, he disappeared without a trace!

Seeing such a method, Qin Yu could not help but turn pale with fright!

What kind of method was this? Did he casually set up a teleportation formation? Or had he already set it up in advance?

Such a brilliant method could not be compared to even the northern lands!

“This man with the mustache,”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, feeling more and more amazed.

“We still let him escape.”The two people’s expressions were extremely displeased.

They looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “What’s your relationship with that tomb robber?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Qin Yu was startled and hurriedly shook his head, “I don’t know him.”

“Don’t know him?”The two people’s faces turned cold, “If you don’t know him, why are you two together?”

Qin Yu pointed at the desolate tomb in front of him and said, “I’m here to explore treasures. I only met him by chance. What’s wrong with him? Did he offend you?”

The two of them sized up Qin Yu and seemed to think that Qin Yu was not lying.

In addition, Qin Yu’s strength was not very strong, so they were not vigilant.

“He stole our family’s treasure. We are looking for him,”said one of them.

“You’d better stay away from him, or you’ll be cheated by him sooner or later,”reminded the other.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and muttered, “That bastard doesn’t look like a good person. He even wants to lie to me.”

They didn’t say anything more. After nodding, they planned to leave.

Qin Yu patted his chest and slightly sighed in relief.

Just as he was about to get up and go to the seat given by man with the mustache, the two people suddenly stopped. They turned to look at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Stop.”

Qin Yu secretly felt that something was wrong. He turned around and pretended to be calm, saying, “Is there anything else?”
