1927 Attack Using the Strength of Another

Qin Yu’s furrowed his brows tightly. He did not expect to be dragged down by the Yue family in the end.

“Let’s go quickly,” the elderly man who was called the general-in-chief urged.

Qin Yu was silent, looking at the ores in front of him, and felt reluctant.

After much thought, Qin Yu finally sighed.

!!

It was the Si family’s territory, and Qin Yu didn’t want to cause any trouble. He nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll go with you.”

Therefore, Qin Yu followed the general-in-chief, prepared to meet the city lord of Serene South City.

“The few of you guard this place carefully. Don’t let anyone get close,” the general-in-chief ordered and said.

“Yes!”

Several people moved forward and surrounded the mine.

Then the general-in-chief left with Qin Yu.

On the way, Qin Yu’s brain was working at full speed, thinking of countermeasures.

He gently touched the general-in-chief’s arm and said at this moment, “Senior, I have a suggestion, but I’m not sure if I should say it.”

The general-in-chief glanced at Qin Yu and said casually, “Go ahead.”

“I know Serene South City belongs to the Si family,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice. “Whatever treasures unearthed in the city should be handed over to the Si family to deal with.”

“That’s right, so?” the general-in-chief said indifferently.

“I have a suggestion. Why don’t we split this mine among us and hide it from the Si family?” Qin Yu said.

The general-in-chief was stunned, and a splendor flashed in his eyes. He was obviously tempted.

But he said, “What nonsense are you talking about? Are you trying to harm us?”

“Not many people knew about this,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “Only a few of us and a few people from the Yue family knew about it. As long as we kill Yue Lingdong, the Si family will never know about this. When the time comes, I’ll set up a great formation that is good be enough to deceive everyone.”

“Moreover, you can take away the ores you want in advance and report the rest to the city lord.”

The general-in-chief was silent as if he was considering.

Qin Yu continued, “If you hand me over, they’ll kill me at most. What good does it do for you? Why must you cause trouble for nothing?”

What Qin Yu said made sense. A hint of greed flashed across the general-in-chief’s face. He then looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “This matter is of great importance. I must report to the city lord first.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this.

Everyone was greedy, and this general-in-chief was no exception. Qin Yu believed that the city lord of Serene South City would make the right choice.

“Alright,” Qin Yu responded and did not say anything else.

Soon, Qin Yu and the general-in-chief arrived at the castle of the city lord.

When they reached the entrance of the palace, the general-in-chief glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You wait here. I’ll report to the city lord first.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

The general-in-chief was not worried that Qin Yu would escape. After all, there were many hidden talents n the palace. Even if Qin Yu wanted to escape, he couldn’t do so.

Qin Yu quietly emitted his divine sense, and it covered a big part of the palace.

Soon, he detected many cultivators in the palace that he could not see through their internal qi.

“It seems that the Si family has sent people to Serene South City,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Judging from the distribution of power, Serene South City was very important to the Si family. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have sent so many top-notch cultivators here.

About half an hour later, the general-in-chief walked out.

After looking around to ensure no one was around, he whispered, “City Lord thinks your suggestion is feasible, but you must keep it a secret. Do you understand?”

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He slightly bowed and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely keep this a secret.”

“Mmm. City Lord is busy now and can’t see you for the time being. You go back to the mine first and kill Yue Lingdong. After that, you come back to see City Lord,” the general-in-chief said.

Qin Yu acknowledged him and said, “If I go by myself, I’m afraid your men won’t believe me.”

The general-in-chief thought for a moment and then took off his token. Then he handed it to Qin Yu.

“Bring this with you. Seeing this token is like seeing me in person,” the general-in-chief said.

“Alright, I’ll go now.” Qin Yu’s face turned cold, and he couldn’t help but sneer in his heart.

“Yue Lingdong, you have wanted to take this opportunity to curry favor with the city lord, and you didn’t expect to invite a fatal disaster, did you?” Qin Qu thought.

Qin Yu didn’t waste time. He immediately turned around and rushed to the mine.

At this moment, Yue Lingdong was looking around arrogantly like a victor. It was as though the ores in front of him had already fallen into his pocket.

“Hehe! As long as we obtain this batch of ores, our Yue family will definitely rise to a higher level.” Yue Lingdong laughed coldly.

This move was indeed killing two birds with one stone. Not only would he take revenge, but he could also obtain the ores. It was indeed a brilliant plan.

Unfortunately, he did not expect Qin Yu to be more skillful and turn the situation around.

Just as Yue Lingdong was feeling pleased with himself, he suddenly felt a chill behind him as if he was being eyed by a ferocious beast.

Yue Lingdong’s expression changed slightly. He quickly turned around and saw Qin Yu looking at him coldly.

“You… What are you doing here?” Yue Lingdong said in a trembling voice.

“You didn’t expect me to come back, did you?” Qin Yu sneered and said.

Yue Lingdong’s face was very ugly. His brain was working at full speed. Then he pointed at Qin Yu and said, “You escaped! This kid has escaped, quickly catch him and bring him back!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After a loud shout, the city lord’s people quickly walked over and surrounded Qin Yu.

...

Their bodies exuded a terrifying killing intent as if they would attack at any moment.

Seeing this, Yue Lingdong heaved a sigh of relief.

He looked at Qin Yu proudly, sneered, and said, “Kid, don’t blame me. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for offending the wrong person!

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said sarcastically, “I’m afraid I have to return these words to you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took out the general-in-chief’s token and shouted, “It’s the general-in-chief who sent me here. He asked me to kill this Yue Lingdong!” Yue Lingdong’s face changed again. He pointed at Qin Yu and said in a trembling voice, “General… Why is the general-in-chief’s token with you? You… You’ve stolen it! You must have stolen it!

“Quickly arrest him! He has stolen the general-in-chief’s token!” Yue Lingdong shouted with all his might.

However, the people around did not seem to hear him. They lowered their bodies and were extremely respectful as if they had seen the general-in-chief in person.

“Stolen?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, sneered, and said, “Yue Lingdong, your plan is indeed not bad. Unfortunately, your wishful thinking is going to fail. You didn’t expect me to know the city lord, did you? You didn’t expect the aristocratic family behind me to be so great, did you? You’re right, you’ve offended the wrong person!”
