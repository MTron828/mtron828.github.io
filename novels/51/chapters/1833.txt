1834 The Furious Chang Mang

A scarlet internal qi emanated from Chang Mang’s body, and the terrifying killing intent forced the people backward!

“Which b*stard did this? I’m going to kill him now!” Chang Mang grabbed a person at random and said fiercely.

Seeing Chang Mang’s expression, everyone couldn’t help but panic.

“It was… It was Jiu Xiao! He was the one who did it!”

“Yes. Jiu Xiao is the overlord of Demon-slaying Peak!”

!!

Chang Mang’s expression was gloomy. He casually threw the person to the side and then stomped on the ground. A terrifying internal qi instantly crushed the ground into pieces.

In the next second, Chang Mang stood high in the sky and roared downward, “Which b*stard is Jiu Xiao? Come out now!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

A terrifying roar shook the earth and caused a booming sound. There were cave abodes that trembled and shattered into pieces!

Jiu Xiao, who was playing chess, could not help but frown.

“Is there something wrong with this kid?” Jiu Xiao said with a frown.

The peak master beside him also scratched his head. “It should not be. This kid is a little reckless, but he wouldn’t find trouble with you for no reason.”

Before Jiu Xiao could speak, a roar came from the sky again.

“B*stard Jiu Xiao, come out!” Chang Mang’s furious roar was so loud that it pierced everyone’s eardrums!

Jiu Xiao was the number one person of Demon-slaying Peak, and he had never been treated this way. His face turned cold, and he strode out.

Seeing Jiu Xiao walk out, many of the Devil Hunters secretly laughed.

However, it was clear that things had happened beyond their expectation.

Jiu Xiao looked at the extremely agitated Chang Mang and could not help but frown. “I’m Jiu Xiao, you…”

Before Jiu Xiao could finish his sentence, Chang Mang charged toward him with his fists clenched!

His terrifying power shattered the space, and the unprepared Jiu Xiao was directly sent flying!

This instantly infuriated Jiu Xiao. He suddenly stood up and said coldly, “Are you courting death?”

“F*ck you! I hate b*stards like you who bully others. And you’re bullying my brother!” Chang Mang, who had gone overboard, could not listen to anything. His violent fist shot up to Jiu Xiao!

At this moment, Chang Mang’s every move could be said to be fatal. It was extremely terrifying.

Chang Mang, who was originally extremely powerful, had a qualitative improvement in his strength after he entered Holy Region. He was actually on par with Jiu Xiao in the fight!

Each of his punches was aimed at Jiu Xiao’s vitality gate. Obviously, he was trying to take Jiu Xiao’s life.

In less than half a day, Jiu Xiao and Chang Mang were both drenched in blood. It was a terrible sight.

However, Chang Mang became more courageous as the battle progressed. It was as if he did not know what fatigue was, and he would not stop fighting until he died.

Looking at the scene, everyone realized that they had gotten into trouble.

“If this continues, one of them will surely die ..”

“Hurry… Hurry up and persuade them…”

“This Chang Mang is a madman. Who would dare to persuade him…”

The peak master also noticed that something was wrong. He said with a cold face, “What’s going on?”

The few of them did not dare to hide anything and immediately told the peak master what had happened.

Hearing their words, the peak master’s face could not help but turn dark.

He pointed at a few of them and said, “You guys… have caused trouble!”

Without any delay, the peak master quickly stood up and tried to stop the two.

However, the bloodthirsty Chang Mang failed to differentiate between friend and foe. The peak master who was trying to stop the fight was struck by a punch, and he fell to the ground.

“Oh no, let’s hurry to the first main peak.” Someone sensed that something was wrong and hurried to the first main peak.

The peak master didn’t know what to do. The strength of these two people was beyond his. It was impossible to stop the fight.

More than half of the entire Demon-slaying Peak was destroyed. Jiu Xiao was covered in blood, and half of his thin body was almost shattered.

Chang Mang’s condition was not any better. There was a large hole in his chest, and half of his head had been shattered. Even his primordial spirit was exposed.

After all, Jiu Xiao had been cultivating in Thunder Courtyard for many years. His techniques were not something Chang Mang could compare to. If this continued, it would be disastrous for Chang Mang.

“If that’s the case, then don’t blame me for being impolite.” Looking at the crazy Chang Mang, Jiu Xiao could not help but feel like killing him.

His palm glowed, and when he raised his hand, there was a ray of light.

The light looked extremely simple, but it was simplified. It was a top-tier technique from Thunder Courtyard that was extremely terrifying!

And a few days ago, Grand Master Feng also used this technique!

Once it slashed down, Chang Mang would definitely die!

At this crucial moment, Grand Master Feng finally arrived.

His body emitted specks of light as he stood between the two.

The two people’s techniques had all entered Grand Master Feng’s body. In the end, they had disappeared without a trace, not causing the slightest ripple.

After that, Grand Master Feng waved his hand, and an internal qi descended from the sky, pressing the two to the ground.

Chang Mang struggled with all his might, but he was unable to break free due to his severe injuries.

Jiu Xiao, who was lying on the ground, was ashen-faced. To him, this was indeed a disaster.

“It’s you again!” Looking at the bloody and heavily panting Chang Mang, Grand Master Feng’s face darkened.

The peak master at the side smiled bitterly. He walked forward, cupped his hands, and greeted him, “Grand Master Feng.”

“What is going on?” Grand Master Feng coldly said.

The peak master was helpless and could only tell him what had happened.

After hearing this, Grand Master Feng was even more displeased.

“From now on, Demon-slaying Peak will not listen to dao for one year!” he said coldly.

After saying this, Grand Master Feng turned around and left.

The entire Demon-slaying Peak was filled with wails. Fortunately, these people were all simple-minded, so they didn’t care too much.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, the people explained what had happened to Chang Mang, and quelled the dispute.

After this incident, the entire Demon-slaying Peak was even more amazed by Chang Mang’s strength.

In the future, Chang Mang would probably be even more terrifying than Jiu Xiao.

Chang Mang had just stepped into the Reversion Void stage, and his cultivation realm was far below that of Jiu Xiao.

After a few days, the peak master and Jiu Xiao played chess as usual.

The peak master said half-jokingly, “Jiu Xiao, everyone is saying that your position as the number one in Demon-slaying Peak is no longer guaranteed. How do you feel?”

Jiu Xiao looked up at the peak master and shook his head, “When have I ever cared about such a reputation? Besides, we still don’t unknown who will win.”

…

At this moment, Qin Yu knew nothing about this.

The Huangji Buddhist Flame that had gathered above his head was rapidly fusing with him.

Time flew by, and eight months passed in the blink of an eye.

In these eight months, everything seemed to have returned to normal.

As Nanzhou no longer had the backup mountain known as Xiao Sheng, the entire Lizhou was slowly moving toward unification.

Many sects took the opportunity to go to Zhongzhou, hoping to get the support of the families in Zhong zhou. They wanted to use their power to become the overlord of the entire Lizhou.

The Tong family, who had arrived in Nanzhou long ago, naturally became their first choice.

With the Tong family’s intervention, soon the situation in Lizhou stabilized. And the one who finally unified all the major sects in Lizhou was actually Li Yingying, who had not appeared for a long time!
