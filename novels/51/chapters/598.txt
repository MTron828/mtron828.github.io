Chapter 599: Immortal Slaying Sect! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu didn’t have the time to think too much and immediately began to pull out the inner cores.

One, two, three...

Countless inner cores were put into the Spatial Magic Artifact by Qin Yu.

But there were simply too many inner cores here. Even if Qin Yu used a spell, the speed of pulling them out was extremely slow.

After spending nearly an hour, Qin Yu pulled out at least thousands of inner cores from under the island!

The awkward thing was that the Spatial Magic Artifact was soon running out of space.

The entire Spatial Magic Artifact was already filled to the brim with inner cores.

“D*mn, what a pity.” As he looked at the countless inner cores in front of him, Qin Yu felt anxious.

If he could take all these inner cores away, then he would no longer need to worry about not having enough spiritual energy.

Qin Yu racked his brain, but he couldn’t think of any way.

“What a pity.” Qin Yu kept muttering.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. Since the Spatial Magic Artifact couldn’t contain them all, he would swallow as much as he could.

Thus, Qin Yu continued to pull out the inner cores. Every time he pulled out one, Qin Yu would stuff it into his mouth.

At the same time, Qin Yu silently circulated his Meridian Circulation Technique to prevent too much spiritual energy from putting too much pressure on his body.

After swallowing more than twenty inner cores, Qin Yu finally couldn’t take it anymore.

He gritted his teeth and continued stuffing them into his stomach.

Just as he pulled out the 8037th inner core, a huge door suddenly appeared in front of him!

This huge door was extremely huge and majestic.

The huge plaque carried a trace of majesty, making it seem extremely out of place under the sea.

A few words were written on the plaque: Immortal Slaying Sect.

The intimidating name made people feel a strong sense of fear!

“This name is too intimidating,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

He stared at the door and said in a low voice, “Could it be that... This entire island is actually a sect below the sea?”

If that was really the case, this sect had existed for an unknown number of years!

As he looked at the extremely majestic door in front of him, waves of ancient internal qi assaulted his face.

Qin Yu didn’t know the origin of the Immortal Slaying Sect, but such a huge sect must be extraordinary.

Qin Yu used the Saintly Body Technique to protect his body as he walked towards the door warily.

The door was slowly opened, and a shocking scene entered his eyes.

It was different from the scene he had imagined. There was a mess instead.

At a glance, there were bones and corpses everywhere! There was no sign of life!

It was as if this was a battlefield. The countless bones were terrifying!

“Could it be... that this sect has been massacred?” Qin Yu thought of a possibility.

The entire sect was filled with dried corpses. It was obvious that they had suffered a disaster.

Qin Yu walked into the sect cautiously. At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt something hard beneath his feet.

As he looked down, he saw a skull under his feet.

Qin Yu bent down and picked up the skull.

This skull looked like it had been there for at least thousands of years, but surprisingly, there was no sign of weathering.

Qin Yu slowly exerted strength in his hands to crush this skull.

But what surprised Qin Yu was that even if he exerted all his strength, he was still unable to crush this skull!

“What a hard bone!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

With Qin Yu’s current strength, even the head of a Martial Marquis could be crushed in an instant! But he was unable to crush this skull!

One had to know that this skull had been around for at least several thousand years! A normal bone would probably shatter upon contact!

“I wonder what realm the owner of this skull was at when he was alive,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu continued to walk forward as he picked up many more bones.

What surprised him was that each bone was extremely tough and couldn’t be crushed!

“The Immortal Slaying Sect is really terrifying!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

For randomly picked up bones to be so hard was enough to show that the members of the Immortal Slaying Sect were all powerful beyond imagination!

“What exactly did such a powerful sect go through to be killed... and what kind of person is the one who attacked them...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a chill on his back!

Compared to them, Qin Yu’s strength wasn’t worth mentioning!

“The so-called invincible Martial Marquis at the moment was probably not worth mentioning a few thousand years ago,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He threw down the bones and continued to walk forward.

Very soon, Qin Yu arrived at the main hall.

The main hall was also covered in dry bones. There were also broken Magic Artifacts and broken swords on the ground.

The bones in this Great Hall seemed to be even harder. Even if Qin Yu used the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist, he wouldn’t be able to break them.

“It seems that the people in this Great Hall are stronger,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

What level were they at when they were alive? Martial Saints? Or they surpassed the Martial Saint Realm?

Martial Saints had become a legend in the current era, but in the entire history of cultivation, they weren’t even worth mentioning.

The Martial Saint was only at the Nascent Soul Stage in the cultivation world, and above the Nascent Soul Stage, there were Soul Formation Stage, Reversion Void Stage, Dao Fusing Stage, and Tribulation Transcending Stage!

According to Qin Yu’s speculation, these withered bones had at least reached the Soul Formation Stage when they were alive!

“Soul Formation Stage... how impressive.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

The Soul Formation Stage was also known as the Mighty Realm, and even in the entire cultivation world, they were top-notch existences.

It was said that those who stepped into the Mighty Realm had a lifespan of several thousand years. With a casual strike, they could destroy a small country. They weren’t any weaker than the top-notch weapons at the moment!

A sect with so many Mighty Realm cultivators was actually massacred. God knew how many Mighty Realm cultivators there were thousands of years ago.

They continued to walk forward. At the end of the hall, there was a chair.

On the chair, there sat a skeleton with his back facing the door!

Qin Yu tiptoed and walked in front of the skeleton.

The skeleton’s hair was disheveled, and the flesh and blood on his body hadn’t completely decayed. One could even see the expression on his face.

His expression looked extremely horrified, as if he was afraid of something!

“I think this person was the cult master of the Immortal Slaying Sect.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

To be the cult master, what level did he have to be at?

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and placed it on the withered bone.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s mind felt as if it had been struck by lightning! Images immediately appeared in Qin Yu’s mind! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Ah!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to retreat, but it was already too late!

His entire divine sense seemed to have fused with the withered bone. Images appeared in Qin Yu’s mind one after another!

In the images, hundreds of cultivators were fighting each other. Their spells were powerful, and a casual strike could shatter the void!

“What... What level is this?!” Seeing their spells, Qin Yu couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

Qin Yu saw a figure standing at the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect.

She raised her hand and waved it, then dozens of people’s bodies were shattered!

“Could it be that... this person is the murderer of the entire Immortal Slaying Sect?!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

In this case, the powerful Immortal Slaying Sect was exterminated by one person?!

Qin Yu looked at the figure at the gate.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly realized that this figure seemed familiar!
