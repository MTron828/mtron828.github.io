Chapter 803: Chapter 803, exchanging people! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu had long guessed that Granny Qin had never married and had no children. This was enough to prove that she was 100% loyal to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

A person like this would never betray the JINGDU martial arts association even if he had to die.

Granny Qin valued Blacky very much, so Qin Yu could only come up with this plan.

Qin Yu picked up Blacky, who had been beaten into a dead dog, and turned to leave.

At this time, Granny Qin took a step forward and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

She glared at Qin Yu and said in a hoarse voice, “Let him go!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Don’t you understand what I’m saying?”

Granny Qin’s body suddenly burst out with a strong killing intent. She glared at Qin Yu and almost roared, “Let him go! ! !”

Qin Yu was unmoved by Granny Qin’s shrieking.

He pinched little black and said coldly, “As long as you bring me to the secret realm, I will not kill him. Otherwise, just wait to collect his corpse!”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

At this moment, Granny Qin suddenly took out the martial saint weapon!

She held the martial saint weapon and roared crazily, “I’ll say it again, let him go! ! !”

The moment the martial saint weapon was taken out, everyone’s expression changed drastically and they took a step back subconsciously.

Even ye Qing’s face was a little unnatural.

He knew very well how much power this martial saint weapon could unleash!

Only Qin Yu was unmoved. He looked at Granny Qin coldly and said with narrowed eyes, “Are you threatening me?”

How could Granny Qin still listen to these words? She gritted her teeth and said, “I’ll say it one last time, let him go! !”

“Impossible!”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Then you can go to hell! !”

Following Granny Qin’s furious roar, the martial saint weapon in her hand immediately flickered and shone!

In the next second, traces of martial saint’s internal Qi spread out and rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu held little black with one hand and clenched his other hand into a fist.

Endless Energy instantly gathered on Qin Yu’s fist!

“So what if it’s a martial saint’s weapon!”Qin Yu roared angrily and threw out his golden fist!

“Boom!”

A loud sound exploded between the two of them!

Rays of light burst out in all directions. Qin Yu’s dazzling golden light was able to destroy the internal Qi of a martial saint!

“Deng Deng Deng Deng!”

Under this tremendous force, Granny Qin retreated several steps in succession. She even spat out a mouthful of fresh blood!

The martial saint weapon in her hand was instantly damaged!

“Do you think that I’m afraid of you with the Martial Saint Weapon?”Qin Yu said coldly.

His voice was not loud, but it entered everyone’s ears!

The scene was silent, everyone was stunned.

Even ye Qing could not help but widen his eyes!

“Qin Yu... he actually destroyed the martial saint’s Weapon?”

“Has Qin Yu become so powerful now? Even the martial saint’s weapon can’t Stop Him?”

“I can’t imagine it. Could it be that Qin Yu has already become a martial saint? Didn’t they say that no one below the martial saint realm can resist the martial saint’s Weapon?”

The crowd discussed animatedly, and all the young masters of the aristocratic families could not help but be secretly speechless.

Yan Jinyao’s expression was even more gloomy as he clenched his fists tightly!

“Granny Qin, you’d better go back and discuss it with those higher-ups,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Let him go!”The stubborn Granny Qin was still unwilling to give up.

However, Qin Yu sneered and said, “I’ll take little black with me. You Can’t Stop Me.”

After saying this, Qin Yu grabbed little black and turned around to leave.

Everyone watched as Qin Yu left, not daring to say a word.

However, they all knew in their hearts that after today’s battle, Qin Yu had completely become famous.

And if the various aristocratic families wanted to stop Qin Yu’s growth, it wouldn’t be that simple.

...

Qin Yu didn’t return to the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy. Instead, he returned to the house he had rented previously.

He threw little black to the side and used qi/spiritual energy to seal little Black’s vital gate, temporarily saving his life.

The mustached man followed behind him and whispered, “The power of a martial saint is truly terrifying!”

Qin Yu could not help but sigh, “That’s right. He only borrowed the power of a martial saint to possess such power. I wonder how terrifying it would be if he stepped into the Martial Saint Realm!”

Right at this moment, a wail suddenly sounded from the space divine weapon of the handlebar mustache.

“Dark prison jar!”The handlebar mustache slapped his head and hurriedly took out the dark prison jar from the space divine weapon.

This voice was emitted by Hou Xin.

“Kill me... kill me...”Hou Xin almost begged.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered, “As long as you hand over the spiritual fire, I will naturally satisfy you.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“As long as you let me leave this jar, I will promise you anything...”Hou Xin begged bitterly.

Qin Yu glanced at the handlebar mustache and gestured for the handlebar mustache to let him out.

The handlebar mustache immediately understood and without a word, he pulled Hou Xin out of the jar of internal Qi.

At this time, Hou Xin was no longer human. He fell to the ground and was covered in blood. His aura was extremely dispirited.

“Where is the spiritual fire?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

Hou Xin said weakly, “Qin Yu, you are ruthless...”

After saying that, Hou Xin raised his palm with great difficulty. Wisps of flame gathered in his palm.

This flame was purple in color and was only the size of a lotus flower.

Compared to Qin Yu’s spiritual fire, Hou Xin’s flame seemed a little small.

Qin Yu’s palm immediately shook and flames rose in all directions.

Then, he used his spiritual fire to wrap around Hou Xin’s palm.

In a short moment, the flame was completely swallowed.

Hou Xin raised his head and said with difficulty, “Qin Yu, can you spare my life? I know that you have great ambitions. I can help you refine pills...”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “No need. Your character is too bad. Moreover, I have a better candidate.”

After saying that, Qin Yu directly smashed Hou Xin’s body into pieces.

After killing Hou Xin, Qin Yu spread out his palm, and the spiritual fire fell into his palm.

This flame was obviously a few times bigger, and its power also became more powerful.

“If I use that ultimate punch now, the power will probably be even more terrifying,”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

The growth of the spiritual fire was extremely difficult, and it had nothing to do with spiritual power. It could only grow by devouring the flames of others.

Qin Yu put away the flames. He raised his head to look at the sky and said in a low voice, “Now it’s up to Granny Qin’s decision.”

The handlebar mustache said in a deep voice, “Do you think Granny Qin will betray the Jingdu Martial Arts Association for Little Black?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “I think so. Granny Qin has long regarded little black as her own son.”

“Moreover, at her age, I’m afraid she has already begun to yearn for the warmth of future generations.”
