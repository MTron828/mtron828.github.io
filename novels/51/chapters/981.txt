Chapter 982: Chapter 982, Iron Egg cowered 

There were many people from the Elfy society who came to attend.

Regardless of whether they were strong or weak, they would all come to join in the fun.

This kind of gathering would usually gather people from the same circle.

Gu Xinghe looked coldly in the direction of Qin Yu, the corners of his mouth curling up into an imperceptible sneer.

“My Plan can continue to be carried out,”Gu Xinghe said with a sneer.

...

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was night time. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu and the moustache man found a hotel to stay in for the time being. Before they could pay the bill, a passionate person paid for Qin Yu.

“So Passionate,”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

“Yeah, you’ve been in the limelight at the Martial Arts Symposium Hall. I don’t know how many people now regard you as their idol,”the moustache man muttered.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. He had never thought of this before.

Qin Yu’s harvest for the entire day was almost zero because the Hundred Spirits Society was simply too big.

The two of them walked around once, but they had also walked less than one-tenth of it.

After returning to the hotel, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly. He planned to once again try to find that tiny opportunity of a martial saint.

However, for some unknown reason, Qin Yu could clearly feel that he was only a hair’s breadth away from becoming a martial saint, yet he still felt that there was something missing.

“Hu...”

After a while, Qin Yu opened his eyes and could not help but frown.

“This is strange.”Qin Yu touched his chin.

“Could it be that I still have a problem with my choice of path?”

It was as if he was separated from becoming a martial saint by a layer of window paper. However, this layer of window paper was always unable to pierce through.

“It seems that my dao heart is still not enough to become a martial saint.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He looked at the handlebar mustache at the side. The handlebar mustache was snoring loudly.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “What would the path of a person like the handlebar mustache be?”

At this moment, Qin Yu could not help but think of Xiao Yu.

Perhaps, she had already stepped into the martial saint realm? After all, she had several reincarnated memories. She was already very familiar with the path of a martial saint.

As he thought about this, Qin Yu fell into a deep sleep.

However, he did not know that someone was already taking action in the dark.

In a dark room.

He Teng stood in front of Gu Xinghe with a cruel smile on his face.

He licked his lips and said, “I can do what Tian Xuehong failed to do, and someone is taking the blame for it. I really don’t dare to think...”

Gu Xinghe said with a sullen face, “Don’t talk nonsense. Hurry up and go. Remember, don’t let anyone find out.”

He teng nodded and said, “Don’t worry. I’m good at this kind of thing.”

Then, he teng turned around and walked out.

The next morning, a few dried corpses appeared in many rooms.

However, no one thought much about it. They thought it was revenge, so they didn’t cause too much trouble.

...

Qin Yu and the moustache man left their residence early and went to the hundred spirits gathering to continue searching for the heavenly vanilla.

But for the entire morning, Qin Yu and the moustache man didn’t find anything.

“Looks like the quality of this year’s hundred spirits gathering isn’t too good.”The moustache man stroked his beard and muttered.

“In the past, the hundred spirits gathering would always produce some earth-shattering treasures.”

“I remember that the last hundred spirit gathering seemed to have unearthed an incomplete supreme artifact.”

Qin Yu frowned and exclaimed, “What? Supreme Artifact?”

“Yes, but it’s incomplete. As for whether it can be used or not, no one knows,”the mustached man said.

“In short, until now, I haven’t seen anyone use it.”

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “If I obtain a supreme artifact, won’t I be able to run rampant in this world?”

“You can say that,”the moustache man said.

“But the premise is that it can be used. If it can’t be used, then it’s useless.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “As long as it can be obtained, there will always be a way to repair it.”

With that said, the two continued to walk forward.

A long street was filled with people.

On both sides of the road, there were many houses along the street. These houses were rented out and used to sell treasures.

Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache shopped one by one. Finally, they stopped in front of a door that didn’t look very big.

The handlebar mustache picked up a scroll and said, “What is this?”

The shop owner said, “Treasure map.”

Hearing this, the handlebar mustache was immediately interested.

“Treasure map? Isn’t that my old profession?”The handlebar mustache said with a smile.

After a round of bargaining, the treasure map was bought for 300,000 yuan.

“Boss, do you know where there is heavenly vanilla?”Qin Yu asked.

The shop owner shook his head and said, “I’ve never heard of it.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

“Let’s go.”Qin Yu and the mustached man waved their hands and continued to walk forward.

After walking through a few more shops, both of them looked a little tired, so they stopped next to one of the shops.

This shop looked quite ordinary, and there were not many things in it.

The handlebar mustache took the lead and walked in. He picked up the things on the table and carefully observed them.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, released his divine sense and checked every single one of them.

“Put that leaf in the corner of the east wall into your bag. That’s a treasure!”

At this moment, tie Dan’s voice sounded in Qin Yu’s mind.

Hearing this, Qin Yu said in surprise, “You’re still alive? I thought you were dead.”

Iron egg said anxiously, “Don’t talk nonsense. Go and get that leaf!”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. He quickly went over and took the leaf.

“Boss, how much is this leaf?”Qin Yu asked.

The boss said, “Take it for 500,000 yuan.”

“500,000 yuan? That’s too expensive. This thing looks ordinary,”Qin Yu muttered.

“Don’t bargain. Buy it before anyone finds out!”Tie Dan said anxiously.

Seeing this, Qin Yu quickly changed his words, “Boss, I want this thing.”

Then, Qin Yu swiped his card and bought the leaf.

After keeping the leaf in his bag, qin yu asked, “What exactly is this leaf?”

Tie Dan snorted lightly, “Kid, consider yourself lucky. This thing is called the scarlet flame leaf. Its function is also very simple. It can increase the power of your divine sense.”

“The more powerful your divine sense is, the more powerful you will become after you become a martial saint.”

Qin Yu exclaimed, “It can directly increase the power of your divine sense? There’s such a treasure?”

“If you don’t believe me, you can give it to me,”tie Dan said impatiently.

Qin Yu touched his nose and changed the topic. “Speaking of which, why did you disappear suddenly last time? I was just about to let you take over my body.”

Iron Egg couldn’t help but shiver at the mention of this. He muttered, “Pull my cock down. I don’t dare to come out with that masked woman around.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask in surprise, “You know her?”

“No, but I’ve heard a lot of rumors about her.”Iron Egg’s voice was a little shaky.

“Also, I saw a portrait in a big tomb back then. Through that portrait, I saw the true body of this masked woman. That scene... I couldn’t help but Shiver.”Iron Egg shivered.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and said, “Aren’t you known as the number one killer God? Why? Are you cowardly now?”

“What do you know!”Iron Egg said with some dissatisfaction.

“You haven’t experienced her era. Let me tell you, you are unlucky.”

“With your talent, you will be invincible in the world in time. Unfortunately, the masked woman was resurrected in this life.”
