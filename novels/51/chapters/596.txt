Chapter 597: Find Qin Yu’s Corpse Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The characters on the bracelet flickered with light. A force that could strike at one’s divine sense made it extremely difficult for Qin Yu to even get up.

He Teng sneered repeatedly. He seized this opportunity and took another step towards Qin Yu.

Under the support of this black energy, He Teng grabbed Qin Yu’s neck and continuously smashed it towards his body.

One punch, two punches, three punches! Qin Yu had practically no ability to fight back!

Seeing this scene, everyone couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Just now, He Teng was still being crushed. How did the situation reverse in the blink of an eye?

“Captain Yan activated Qin Yu’s bracelet,” Yao Meng whispered.

Hearing this, everyone immediately understood.

Zhuang Teng said with slight surprise. “Isn’t this too despicable?”

“I don’t think it’s despicable. Qin Yu is just a bottom-class nobody. All his fame is just hype,” Kong Yun said coldly.

“That’s right. Qin Yu might have some ability, but there’s no need to praise him too much.” Chu Heng nodded slightly.

At this moment, Yao Meng smiled and said. “I have a different opinion.”

“Huh?” Everyone looked at Yao Meng.

Yao Meng smiled and said. “I think Qin Yu’s ability might not be inferior to ours.”

“Humph, Miss Yao, aren’t you overestimating Qin Yu a little too much?” Kong Yun said with some displeasure.

“So what if he has some strength? Under such adversity, he can only fail. There is no future to speak of.”

Yao Meng smiled and said. “The more people grow in adversity, the more limitless their future will be.”

Her words immediately caused everyone to be dissatisfied, but they couldn’t find any words to refute her.

Not far away, He Teng lifted Qin Yu’s neck with one hand. A black light condensed in his hand.

That light turned into a sharp blade. This sharp blade was pointed at Qin Yu’s vital point!

“Qin Yu, I admit that you’re more capable than me,” He Teng said sinisterly.

“But it’s a pity that strength has never been respected in this world! Defiant people often die the fastest!”

As he spoke, the sharp blade in He Teng’s hand suddenly stabbed forward!

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, Qin Yu endured the pain and his body suddenly shook, sending He Teng flying!

“Huh?” Yan Guiyi frowned and snorted. “He can still resist?”

Then, a trace of coldness flashed across Yan Guiyi’s face.

He said gloomily, “It seems that I have to increase the strength...”

After saying that, Yan Guiyi murmured, and the strength on the bracelet increased sharply again!

“Ah!!!”

This time, Qin Yu immediately raised his head and roared in pain!

Every inch of his skin seemed to have been pierced by a sharp blade, and his chest felt stuffy!

Even his divine sense felt waves of sharp pain, like needles were stabbing it!

This intense pain caused Qin Yu to collapse onto the ground with a plop.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He wanted to force himself to stand up, but all the strength in his body seemed to have been sucked out, and he couldn’t stand up at all!

Not far away, He Teng wiped off the blood at the corner of his mouth. He slowly stood up and said coldly. “If you don’t die, I, He Teng, will never be able to rise again!”

Before he could finish his words, He Teng’s figure suddenly disappeared. In the next second, he appeared in front of Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu, go to h*ll!”

Accompanied by He Teng’s angry roar, he held a sharp blade in his hand and ruthlessly stabbed at Qin Yu’s chest!

“Phew!”

This sharp blade pierced through Qin Yu’s body, and a mouthful of fresh blood instantly spewed out from his mouth!

He Teng sneered. “Qin Yu, I won’t give you another chance. This time... I’ll kill you!”

He Teng’s entire body glowed brightly, as if he was preapring for some sort of powerful move.

After that, the rays of black light turned into small balls one after another.

These small balls were like bombs, containing extremely terrifying power.

“Qin Yu, I know that your physical body is extremely strong. This move is specially prepared for you,” He Teng said with a cold smile.

“Under this technique, no matter how tough your physical body is, it will be blasted through!”

“Come, let me see just how strong your body is!”

He Teng spread out his palm, and those small black balls immediately shot towards Qin Yu from all directions!

“Boom!”

Countless small black balls exploded on Qin Yu’s body!

A terrifying airwave instantly swept through the surroundings!

In an instant, even the surrounding seawater was evaporated!

Afraid of being affected by the airwave, He Teng retreated rapidly!

The people not far away also scattered and fled dozens of meters away!

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly. “Even the Black Gold Stone might not be able to withstand this force, let alone Qin Yu.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Everyone stared at the center of the explosion.

They also wanted to know if Qin Yu could survive this big explosion!

Finally, the smoke and dust slowly dispersed, and a figure appeared in front of everyone.

His body was covered in blood, and his flesh was practically shattered. Crystal white bones were exposed!

His body was already filled with wounds. Fresh blood covered his face, and it was practically impossible to see his appearance clearly.

“He actually didn’t die?” He Teng raised his brows and sneered. “As expected of a chaotic body. He didn’t die.”

Qin Yu panted heavily. His expression was ferocious, and he was heavily injured. His internal qi was extremely weak.

He Teng walked towards Qin Yu step by step. He looked down at Qin Yu from above and sneered. “Qin Yu, it’s time to die.”

A black light burst out from He Teng’s palm. The black light pointed at Qin Yu’s chest.

“Go to h*ll!” He Teng roared, and the black light immediately smashed toward Qin Yu!

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body was sent flying hundreds of meters! Then, he fell into the sea while stirring up huge waves!

“It’s over,” He Teng said with a smile.

He turned around and walked in front of Yan Guiyi. He said with a smile. “Captain Yan, I was a bit too heavy-handed. I’m sorry.”

Yan Guiyi glanced at He Teng and then said in a cold voice. “There are risks in sparring. It’s okay.”

He Teng bowed and said with a smile. “Thank you, Captain Yan.”

Yan Guiyi said nothing more and turned around to leave.

Everything returned to calmness. Many martial artists from the bottom level stood on the seaside and quietly watched.

They were waiting for a miracle.

But in the blink of an eye, the sky darkened, but the sea surface was calm.

“Qin Yu... died just like that?” Chang Mang clenched his fists with anger written all over his face.

The others kept silent, but their faces were full of sorrow.

Without Qin Yu, the martial artists from the bottom were naturally bullied even more.

Not far away, Yan Guiyi was also looking at the surface of the water.

“Captain Yan, can I join the Jingdu Martial Arts Association now?” He Teng said with a smile.

Yan Guiyi glanced at him and snorted coldly. “Who told you to throw him into the sea?”

He Teng was stunned and said with a smile, “Captain Yan, what do you mean?”

Yan Guiyi said coldly. “I want to see his corpse! He Teng, you have to find Qin Yu’s corpse for me!”

He Teng smiled and said. “Mr. Yan, aren’t you being a little too cautious? I have a lot of confidence in myself. I believe that no one will be able to survive under this sort of bombardment.”

“Shut up! I told you to go find him. Why do you have to talk so much nonsense?!” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

Yan Guiyi’s expression was extremely ugly because the real treasure of this experiential learning was under this island!
