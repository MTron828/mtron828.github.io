Chapter 700: A Weapon Is Also a Part of Strength Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Xiu was not a pure martial artist. He also controlled a large part of the Han family’s business.

This had resulted in his more deliberative thinking than ordinary martial artists. He would not be so easily deceived.

“Qin Yu, there’s no need to put on airs.” Han Xiu rubbed his fists.

He sneered and said, “These two Mighty Realm bodies, I won’t be polite to them. I believe that in my hands, they can display greater power.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed!

These two corpses must not be lost. Otherwise, it would definitely bring trouble!

Thus without thinking, Qin Yu directly put these two bodies back into the spatial magic artifact.

“Hahaha! Did you see that?” Han Xiu said with a face full of ridicule.

Ao Zhan came to a realization now. He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “B*stard, I almost fell for your tricks!”

Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly.

Han Xiu, this b*stard, was indeed setting him up!

Without the aid of Burly and Robust, Qin Yu could only fight Ao Zhan and Han Xiu alone.

They were both at the peak of the Martial Marquis, and their strength was far above Qin Yu. They were on par with the couple from the Han Palace back then!

“Qin Yu, you killed the president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. You have to take responsibility for this,” Ao Zhan waved the crossbow in his hand.

This crossbow was extremely strange. It could turn a large amount of inner strength into an extremely fierce attack power!?It could also magnify its strength to the extreme!

At this moment, Ao Zhan was operating the crossbow in his hand, and it was emitting rays of light.

It seemed there were countless rays of qi energy brewing on the crossbow.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

As Ao Zhan clenched his hand, the rays of light on the crossbow immediately burst out and rushed towards Qin Yu at an extremely high speed!

Qin Yu did not hide or dodge. After a shout, he clenched his fist and faced it head-on!

The reason was none other than Qin Yu wanted to know how big the gap was between him and the peak of the Martial Marquis!

“Crack!”

The three rays of light went towards the golden light from Qin Yu’s body!

The terrifying power of the crossbow pierced through Qin Yu’s golden light and shattered Qin Yu’s fist!

Blood and broken bones flowed down his wrist.

Qin Yu looked down at his fist and sneered, “This crossbow is indeed not simple...”

Ao Zhan, who was not far away, frowned.

These three rays of light could only shatter Qin Yu’s palm?

Under normal circumstances, no one could rely on their physical body to withstand this crossbow!

“This fellow’s physical body indeed lives up to its reputation,” Han Xiu’s eyes were filled with a strong fighting spirit, and the internal qi on his body was bursting out!

They were both Martial Marquis but their attacking methods were vastly different.

Han Xiu’s huge fist flickered with a strange light, and extremely strong pressure was rushing out!!

This pressure was far above that of Ao Zhan!

Qin Yu looked solemn but more of it was the boundless battle intent, and even a trace of excitement!

“Brat, let me test this body of yours!” Following Han Xiu’s furious roar, the ground beneath his feet instantly exploded!

And Han Xiu’s body shot towards Qin Yu like a cannonball!

The terrifying strong wind tore apart the Taoism Theory Library! Before the fist arrived, the wind of the fist cut the air in half like a knife! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. He clenched his fists, and the golden light appeared. A destructive power gathered in his fists!

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!”

With Qin Yu’s furious roar, the two fists finally collided!

The airwaves spread out in all directions with the two of them as the center!

In just a short moment, Han Xiu indeed took two steps back!

On the other end, although Qin Yu’s fist was in pain from the shock, his body stood erect like a thousand-year-old pine!

Han Xiu looked at Qin Yu in surprise, and a trace of keen interest appeared in his eyes.

“What a tough body. I’m afraid no one below the Martial Saint can compare to this body,” Han Xiu praised from the bottom of his heart.

“No wonder my nephew lost to you. Your ability is indeed far above his.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Thank you for your compliment, Mr. Han. I know very well in my heart that this is not your true strength.”

“Hahaha!” Han Xiu could not help but burst into laughter.

“That’s right! The physical body is only a part of your strength. It can’t represent everything.”

At this point, Han Xiu paused for a moment, narrowed his eyes, and said, “But if I let you take another step forward, I might not be able to defeat you...”

In a fight between experts, one move was enough to test each other’s strength!

“Let me do it,” Ao Zhan took the initiative to take a step forward.

Holding the crossbow in his hand, there was a hint of contempt on his face.

Han Xiu’s comments on Qin Yu clearly made Ao Zhan feel a hint of displeasure.

He was only at the early stage of the Martial Marquis, did he deserve such high praise?

Ao Zhan held the crossbow in his hand. It was emitting a terrifying radiance.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Ao Zhan, although you are at the peak of the Martial Marquis, all of your strength depends on this crossbow, right?”

Ao Zhan did not hide it. He smiled faintly and said, “Yes, weapons are also a part of strength.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Do you dare to put down this crossbow and fight with me?”

“Hahaha! You’re dreaming! I’ve said that weapons are also a part of strength!” Ao Zhan laughed coldly.

Seeing this, Qin Yu did not say anything else.

He nodded slightly and said, “Ao Zhan, although the crossbow in your hand is made of natural treasures and your technique is extremely high-end, but... it isn’t a Martial Saint’s weapon, right?”

Ao Zhan sneered and said, “It’s obvious that you don’t know about weapons.

“The true level of a weapon is the dark blue sky and the yellow earth. The weapon in my hand is an Earth Rank weapon!

“As for the Martial Saint’s weapon that you mentioned, it’s just a magical artifact refined by the Martial Saint and can activate a wisp of the Martial Saint’s internal qi.

“If it doesn’t have the Martial Saint’s internal qi, then the Martial Saint’s weapon isn’t worth mentioning. It’s not qualified to be compared to my crossbow!”

Looking at Ao Zhan’s proud look, Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand the logic. So... your crossbow did not pass through the hands of a Martial Saint, did it?”

Ao Zhan said with a cold face, “When I become the Martial Saint, it will naturally become a Martial Saint weapon. Moreover, it will be a top-notch Martial Saint weapon!”

“So, what you have is not the Martial saint weapon,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Ao Zhan said with some anger, “So what if it is? And so what if it is not? As long as I can kill you!”

Qin Yu nodded silently and said, “I agree with what you said. A weapon is also a part of strength.”

Before he finished speaking, Qin Yu took out the Prajna ruler.

A wisp of Martial Saint’s internal qi spread out.

Rays of light were even brewing on the Prajna ruler’s body!

“Prajna ruler? How could it be in your hands!” Ao Zhan’s expression changed drastically!
