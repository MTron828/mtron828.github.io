Chapter 1031: Chapter 1,031, the destruction of the Wan family

Qin Yu guessed something.

This kind of “God”seemed to rely on a domain, similar to Qin Yu’s heavy falling space.

As long as one was in this domain, one’s body and mind would be greatly affected.

However, Qin Yu had no fear at all, so he naturally wouldn’t be affected by this domain.

He Strode Forward, striding towards the ghost statue.

“I’ll let you, this god, have a taste of my fist,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

As he got closer and closer to the god, the light on Qin Yu’s fist grew brighter and brighter.

The light, which was the size of a millstone, lit up this originally dim domain!

Qin Yu’s right hand slid, and blue veins bulged out.

Through the blue veins, it was as if one could see the blood flowing in the blood vessels turning golden!

Qin Yu clenched his fist and shot out a beam of light towards the ghost statue!

This was a killing technique that could destroy anything in its path. It was extremely overbearing, like a storm or a bolt from the blue! It was sudden and hard to block!

“Break!”

Qin Yu smashed his fist towards the large pile of ghost statues in an unparalleled manner!

“Crack!”

Under Qin Yu’s incomparably tyrannical power, all kinds of demons and ghosts were not worth mentioning!

Power could overpower everything in time!

The huge ghost image began to shatter.

Cracks spread out rapidly in all directions like a spider web!

In a short moment, the ghost image shattered into pieces and finally turned into dust, disappearing into the void!

“I’ll remember you!”

Just when Qin Yu thought everything was over, the voice of the ghost statue came from the darkness!

The voice seemed to come from all directions, but also seemed to come from the bottom of one’s heart. It could not help but make one’s heart jump!

Even Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly!

The surrounding darkness began to dissipate bit by bit. The armored skeleton also turned into dust and disappeared into the void.

The Darkness disappeared bit by bit, revealing the true appearance of the Wan family’s secret realm.

The moment they saw the light, all the Heaven Gate’s disciples were overjoyed. The feeling of having survived the disaster made them gasp for breath.

“How is this possible...”

Not far away, Wan Zhengye’s pupils constricted, and his expression was extremely ugly.

This was a secret treasure passed down from the Wan family, and it had protected the Wan family for generations!

But now, this secret treasure was actually broken by Qin Yu!

“Is the Wan family... going to fall into my hands...”a trace of despair appeared on Wan Zhengye’s face.

Qin Yu walked in front of Wan Zhengye. He stretched out his hand and took the green oil lamp from Wan Zhengye’s hand.

The moment he took it, the oil lamp began to shatter.

In a moment, it turned into powder.

“The divine lamp... is shattered!”Wan Zhengye, who was already in despair, suddenly turned pale.

Qin Yu looked at Wan Zhengye coldly and said, “Do you still want to resist stubbornly?”

Wan Zhengye suddenly raised his head and said with a pleading tone, “Can you spare my son’s life? As long as you are willing, I can give you everything!”

“No, Wan Guqiong Must Die,”Qin Yu said straightforwardly.

Wan Zhengye gritted his teeth and said, “If you are willing to spare my son, I can tell you a secret. You will definitely be interested in this secret!”

“Secret?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “What secret?”

“You have to Promise Me First!”Wan Zhengye turned back and looked at Wan guqiong, who was shaking like a leaf.

“Not only do you have to promise me, but you also have to swear on your primordial spirit!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s face immediately turned cold.

It was useless for ordinary people to swear, but once they entered the nascent soul realm and broke the oath, it was very likely that it would affect their future cultivation path.

Although this possibility was not 100% , no cultivator was willing to try it.

“You’d better keep this secret in your stomach,”Qin Yu said coldly.

With that, Qin Yu smashed Wan Zhengye’s head with one palm!

This palm could not help but shatter his body, as well as his primordial spirit.

Not far away, Wan guqiong immediately collapsed to the ground, his face as pale as death.

He looked at Qin Yu with trembling eyes, his whole body trembling as if he could not even stand up.

Qin Yu walked in front of Wan guqiong and sneered, “You think I can’t kill you just because you escaped to the mystic realm, don’t you?”

Wan guqiong said in a trembling voice, “Qin Yu, don’t...”

“Kneel!”

Just as Wan Guqiong opened his mouth, Qin Yu shouted!

This voice contained the power of the Great Dao and scared Wan Guqiong so much that he almost fainted!

He tried to stand up many times, but he found that he couldn’t stand up at all.

“Do you still remember your arrogant attitude back then?”Qin Yu said coldly.

“When you slaughtered the disciples of the Green Moon Villa, did you ever think of today?”

The once elegant young master of the Wan family knelt down and begged like a stray dog.

Qin Yu turned to look at the pavilion master and said, “Pavilion Master, please finish him with your own hands.”

However, the pavilion master shook his head and said, “It’s better for you to do it.”

Qin Yu didn’t refuse anymore. He waved his hand and a golden light penetrated the body of the Wan Gu Qiong.

This palm actually directly penetrated his body and shattered wan gu Qiong’s divine sense!

“Leave no one in the Wan family alive,”Qin Yu coldly ordered.

This was a massacre. The Wan family had already lost the ability to resist. They were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered, like fish on a chopping board.

The Wan family’s secret realm was instantly destroyed.

The corpses of the Wan family father and son were taken out of the secret realm and hung at the entrance of the secret realm.

This news quickly spread.

The news that Qin Yu had broken through the Wan family’s secret realm made all the secret realms tremble in fear!

“Wan Gu Qiong is dead! No one expected that a secret realm that had been so glorious for so many years would end up like this.”

“Everything seems to have changed overnight.”

Many disciples of the secret realm started to feel uneasy. They were afraid that they would be the next to be liquidated.

After this battle, not only did the various secret realms start to panic, but the martial arts association of Jingdu also began to worry. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In the second secret realm, Zhai Xing told Gu Zizhen about this matter.

However, the arrogant Gu Zizhen still didn’t take it seriously.

“Who does he think he is? Does he even deserve to be compared to me?”Gu Zizhen said coldly.

Zhai Xing didn’t say anything, but he couldn’t help but think to himself, this father and son of the Gu family are really the same

Gu Zi really didn’t take it seriously, but the eight higher-ups of the martial arts association in Jingdu couldn’t sit still.

In the meeting room.

The eight higher-ups descended once again.

This time, only the eight of them were talking.

“Qin Yu has already grown to an unbelievable level. It’s still too late for us to act.”

“If we want to kill him now, the cost is too high. It’s so high that we can’t accept it.”

“Maybe... It’s time to talk to him.”
