Chapter 582: Everyone Was Shocked! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu silently nodded his head.

From everyone’s attitude toward Mr. Zhou, one could tell how high his status was.

After Mr. Zhou took the stage, the meeting officially began.

He took out a document. This document seemed to be aimed at the requirements of various organizations.

For example, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, which represented martial arts.

Qin Yu wasn’t too interested in these things, so he couldn’t say anything. He just sat there quietly and waited.

The entire meeting was solemn. Everyone was taking notes seriously.

It wasn’t because of anything else, but because Mr. Zhou was representing the authorities.

The meeting lasted for a long time. Qin Yu listened attentively.

After about two hours, the meeting finally came to an end.

Mr. Zhou put away the documents and said with a smile, “This meeting is basically over. Do you guys have any suggestions or opinions?”

“No, no, of course not. We will follow the arrangements.”

“That’s right. Mr. Zhou, thank you for your trouble. We will carry out everything strictly according to the standards.”

Mr. Zhou nodded. He stood up and said with a smile, “In that case...”

“Hold on.” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly stood up. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Everyone looked at Qin Yu in unison. Their eyes were filled with confusion and shock!

What was Qin Yu trying to do? Could it be that he really wanted to raise some objections?

“Qin Yu, don’t talk nonsense.” The Pavilion Master said forcefully.

Mr. Zhou, who was in front, looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “This is?”

“Hello, Mr. Zhou. My name is Qin Yu. I’m an ordinary person,” said Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu...” Mr. Zhou seemed to be thinking about this name.

A moment later, he said with a smile, “I’ve heard of your name. Not long ago, because of the daughter of the Yan family, you caused quite a commotion with Han Wei of the Han family, right?”

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Yes, Mr. Zhou.”

Mr. Zhou sat down again and said with a smile, “If you have something to say, just say it.”

Qin Yu glanced at the crowd, then took a deep breath and said slowly, “Mr. Zhou, although I’m alone, I can represent a part of the people in the martial arts world. I believe that what I say today is what they want to express.”

At this point, Qin Yu pointed at Qu Xie and said coldly, “I want to ask a question. The cultivation resources in the world are shared by everyone, right?”

Mr. Zhou thought for a moment and nodded. “Yes. Although cultivation resources belong to the country, anyone can participate in cultivation.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Then I don’t understand why all the martial arts resources are occupied by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“They have taken all the resources. No one is allowed to use them except for their own people!”

“Mr. Zhou, do you think this is fair? Or did you acquiesce to it?”

Almost immediately, everyone broke out in cold sweat!

“Qin Yu is crazy!” Someone thought to himself.

“I knew this kid was a hothead. I didn’t expect that he was dumb as well.”

“Ji Yuhong brought him here. Isn’t she bringing trouble upon herself?”

Qu Xie sneered to himself.

Was Qin Yu questioning Mr. Zhou? He was simply courting death!

“Perhaps we don’t need to do anything since he’ll screw himself over.” Qu Xie sneered.

“Qin Yu, shut up! Don’t talk nonsense!” Ye Qing coughed and berated.

“How can you talk to Mr. Zhou?! Sit down!”

Qin Yu completely ignored him. His eyes were fixed on Mr. Zhou, as if waiting for his answer.

Mr. Zhou smiled and waved his hand while saying, “Everyone, don’t be so nervous. Since we’ve asked you to come, then you should put forward your suggestions and opinions.”

“I feel that Qin Yu’s arrival has indeed added some vitality to this meeting.”

Hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but be surprised!

Could it be that Mr. Zhou really wanted to answer Qin Yu’s question?

Mr. Zhou seemed to see through everyone’s thoughts. He said with a smile, “Today, I will not only answer Qin Yu’s question directly but also solve this problem.”

Then, he looked at Qu Xie and asked, “Is what Qin Yu said the truth?”

Qu Xie looked a little embarrassed. He hurriedly stood up and said, “Mr. Zhou, it’s like this. We...”

“Just say yes or no. Don’t say too many useless words,” Mr. Zhou said with a smile.

Qu Xie braced himself and said, “Yes.”

Mr. Zhou nodded and said, “Although the management of the Martial Arts Association is relatively lenient, it isn’t completely ignored.”

“Qin Yu is right. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has to carry out certain responsibilities.”

Qin Yu struck while the iron was hot and continued, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has appropriated all the resources, and these resources are all given to the descendants of the big families!”

“Not only that, but if ordinary people like us try to use them, we might even be imprisoned by them!”

Mr. Zhou glanced at Qu Xie and asked with a smile, “Is it true?”

“Yes... yes...” Qu Xie braced himself and said.

Mr. Zhou nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll settle this matter today.”

He looked at Qu Xie and said, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has organized all the resources, right?”

Qu Xie nodded and said, “We have indeed integrated a part of the resources.”

“This part of the resources has to be open for everyone to use. As for the method, I hope you can come up with a reasonable solution yourself,” said Mr. Zhou.

“Qu Xie, can you do it?” Asked Mr. Zhou.

Qu Xie hurriedly stood up and said, “Yes, I can definitely...”

Mr. Zhou nodded slightly. Then, he said, “Qu Xie, don’t treat the Jingdu Martial Arts Association as the official authority. Do you understand?”

As soon as he said that, cold sweat immediately broke out on Qu Xie’s forehead!

His words sounded casual, but there was a hint of warning in them!

“I. . . I understand. Don’t worry,” Qu Xie hurriedly nodded and said.

“Also...” Mr. Zhou took a sip of tea.

Then, he continued, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has to pay attention to evidence and propriety when doing things. Don’t think that you can do whatever you want.”

“Yes, don’t worry...” Qu Xie kept nodding.

Mr. Zhou nodded. Then, he looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, do you have anything else to say?”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He was just about to ask Mr. Zhou to rescue Yan Ruoxue.

At this time, the Pavilion Master reached out and tugged at Qin Yu while shaking her head slightly.

Qin Yu could only take a deep breath, then nodded and said, “Thank you, Mr. Zhou. I have no other questions.”

“If there are no other questions, then the meeting is over.” Mr. Zhou put away the documents and stood up.

After Mr. Zhou left, everyone looked at Qin Yu with a strange expression.

Qin Yu ignored everyone. He looked at the Pavilion Master and said, “Pavilion Master, why didn’t you let me continue?”

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Do you want Mr. Zhou to interfere in your private affairs? That’s asking for too much. You have to know your place.”

Qin Yu could only lower his head in annoyance.

“Well, you’ve already fought for plenty of rights and benefits today,” said the Pavilion Master.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has occupied resources for many years. This time, I’m afraid they’re going to have to pay up.”

“You must seize this opportunity and cultivate as soon as possible.”
