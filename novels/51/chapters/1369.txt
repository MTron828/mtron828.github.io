Chapter 1370: Chapter 1,370, I’ve Found You! 1

Sun Zhong’s expression suddenly changed. At this moment, his face was full of coldness and ridicule.

Wen Da didn’t seem to believe Sun Zhong’s words. He struggled to get up and grabbed Sun Zhong’s collar.

“YOU MOTHERF * cker...”Wen da wanted to say something, but Sun Zhong flung him away.

He looked coldly at Wen Da and said, “You two trash. Without Wen wanye, you’re nothing. No one will look up to you.”

After saying that, sun zhong tidied his clothes and turned around, saying, “You two stay here obediently. The people from the Heavenly Cloud sect will come soon.”

“Stop.”

Just as Sun Zhong was about to leave, Qin Yu’s voice suddenly came from behind him.

Qin Yu, who was almost “Unconscious”, stood up unscathed at this moment.

He opened his mouth and spat out all the poisonous wine in his mouth.

Sun Zhong’s expression changed slightly, and he said coldly, “You actually didn’t drink it?”

Qin Yu said as he walked, “I’m different from Wen Dawen Er. Their life was something I once yearned for but couldn’t reach. But later, I understood a principle.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu had already walked in front of Sun Zhong.

“Do you know what it is?”Qin Yu stood in front of Sun Zhong and asked.

Sun Zhong’s forehead was drenched in sweat, but he couldn’t say a word.

“That means that everything has two sides.”Qin Yu patted Sun Zhong’s shoulder, and a huge force suddenly pressed down!

“Crack!”

Sun Zhong’s arm was crushed, and his body suddenly knelt down.

“Spare... spare me...”Sun Zhong said in pain.

Qin Yu looked down at sun zhong and said, “If you had begged me a few years ago, I would have been soft-hearted and given you a chance. But now, I won’t.”

With that, Qin Yu slapped Sun Zhong to death.

He carried Wen Dawen er on his back and left in a hurry without looking back.

Qin Yu brought Wen Dawen er to a mountain forest to recuperate.

Not long after Qin Yu escaped, Sun Zhong’s murder was discovered.

The people from the Heavenly Cloud sect quickly rushed to the scene and asked about the situation.

They quickly came to a conclusion.

“Those two people are Wen Dawen Er. The third person must be Qin Yu,”the leader said coldly.

He stood in front of Sun Zhong’s body and threw him out.

Then, he sniffed hard, as if he was looking for Wen Dawen Er’s breath.

“He didn’t go far,”the leader said quietly.

This person was none other than the person-in-charge of the Tianyun sect who was stationed in Dayue City.

His name was Ding Jie. He was born in the Tianyun sect and was loyal to the Tianyun sect. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

With their cultivation level, it wasn’t difficult for them to capture a person’s scent.

Moreover, although Wen Dawen er wasn’t very strong, his body still had the fluctuations of spiritual power. It wasn’t difficult to find them.

Ding Jie walked out of the Sun clan. He slightly closed his eyes, and his spiritual sense rapidly expanded.

“In the southeast direction,”Ding Jie said coldly.

He took out a token from his hand and handed it to the person next to him.

“Give this to the great elder,”Ding Jie said.

“Once I find them, I’m afraid I Won’t be able to return. But as long as I die, the great elder will be able to find Qin Yu’s location through this token.”

“Yes!”

The people next to him didn’t say any nonsense. They had grown up in the Tianyun sect since childhood and received the education of the Tianyun sect. They had long become machines loyal to the Tianyun sect.

Then, Ding Jie got up and ran along with Wen Da and Wen Er’s aura.

...

Wen Da and Wen Da lay on a patch of grass. After an unknown amount of time, they slowly woke up.

The moment they woke up, they saw Qin Yu roasting lamb legs at the side.

The fragrance that assaulted their nostrils made Wen Da and Wen Er sit up abruptly.

“You’re Awake?”Qin Yu glanced at them.

Wen Da touched his nose and said with an embarrassed smile, “Qin Yu, you’re right. These B * stards are indeed fence-sitters. If it weren’t for you, we might have been caught by the Tianyun sect.”

Qin Yu handed a leg of mutton to Wen da and said, “Remember, don’t trust anyone easily in the future, especially during difficult times.”

Wen da grunted in gratitude. He took the leg of mutton and began to chew it.

“Qin Yu, where are we going next?”Wen Er asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu looked up at the sky and sighed. “I don’t know either, but it’s best to leave the South Province.”

At this moment, Qin Yu thought of the Thunder Courtyard. That might be a good place to stay.

“I’m afraid it won’t be that easy to leave the South Province.”Wen Da shook his head and said.

“That’s right. There are three dead rivers around the South Province, which can not be crossed. Other than the dead rivers, there is the green rock forest. If we enter the Green Rock Forest, I’m afraid we will die even faster,”Wen er said.

“I think the Heavenly Cloud sect has already taken control of all the teleportation array platforms in the South Province. Once we show ourselves, they will be the first to know.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. This was the first time he knew that leaving the South Province would be so troublesome.

“Then let’s take it one step at a time,”Qin Yu said.

“I will try my best to find enough life force before they catch me.”

Qin Yu touched the number nine on her forehead and said in a low voice.

After Wen Da and Wen Er were almost done with their cultivation, the three of them set off on the road of escape again.

Not long after they left, Ding Jie arrived at this place.

Looking at the traces of the barbecue on the ground, Ding Jie couldn’t help but sneer, “You’re quite carefree. I’ve Found You!”
