2133 Heading to Where the Path of Heaven Arrives

This warship was no ordinary warship. Its overall shape was like an enormous Kun bird. Its body size was so huge that it seemed to be able to cover the sky and block the sun, giving off a tremendous intense sense of oppression.

The entire ship was forged from a rare ore called black divine gold. It was tremendously tough and reflected a cold metallic luster.

The shape of the ship’s bow was like a dragon’s head, majestic and imposing. And its eyes were sharp as if it had a life of its own.

Under the dragon’s head was an enormous ship shield engraved with mysterious runes. It emitted a faint light and seemed to have a powerful defensive ability.

A faint light curtain wrapped the hull of the ship. It was activated by the formation inside the ship. It could resist various attacks to ensure the hull was undamaged.

Around the ship, four large-sized formations were rotating in the air, emitting intense light. That was the driving force that allowed the ship to fly freely in the air.

A spacious cabin was at the stern of the ship, and an enormous altar was in its middle. All kinds of rare treasures were on the altar, and a massive magic stone was in the middle. It was the power source of the warship and could provide endless energy for the entire ship.

The entire warship was full of ancient and powerful internal qi like a divine weapon from ancient times.

The ship was filled with a strong battle intent as if a mere touch would unleash earth-shattering power.

“What? You’ve never seen such a warship before?” A linen-robed elderly man noticed Qin Yu’s gaze and could not help but mock.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu snorted and said, “Is a broken ship worthy of bragging?”

“Broken ship? Do you know the origin of this ship?” an elderly man said coldly.

“I don’t know, and I don’t want to know,” Qin Yu grinned and said.

“You!” The elderly man was infuriated by Qin Yu but could do nothing.

Then they brought Qin Yu to an elderly man.

This person had a robust physique and a weathered countenance, but his eyes flickered with wisdom. His hair and beard had turned completely white like snow. He was wearing a long robe embroidered with various strange patterns, which seemed to be some magical runes.

He sat on a very ancient wooden chair and looked at Qin Yu without saying a word. His gaze was deep and he seemed to be able to see through people’s minds.

“First Elder, we’ve brought him back,” a linen-robed elderly man cupped his hands and said.

The elderly man, who was addressed as First Elder, nodded slightly. After that, he looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “You are Qin Yu?”

“First Elder.” Qin Yu’s tone was rather polite and somewhat surprised First Elder.

“Why do you want to follow our warship?” he asked in a deep voice.

“It’s certainly for the day of the Path of Heaven,” Qin Yu smiled and said.

Qin Yu smiled faintly and said, “So what if I’m afraid? The day of the Path of Heaven arrives once in ten thousand years. I will never miss such an opportunity.”

“Oh? Now that you’ve become a prisoner and your life is in danger. Yet you still dare to speak arrogantly?” First Elder frowned.

When Qin Yu heard this, he immediately laughed out loud and said, “I don’t think so. This ship can give me a ride, so I don’t have to travel myself.”

Qin Yu’s words undoubtedly shocked First Elder tremendously.

Under such a dangerous situation, Qin Yu could still maintain such composure. This kind of temperament was indeed extraordinary.

“First Elder, you don’t have to waste your breath on him. Ask him to hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture. If he doesn’t, kill him straightaway!” a linen-robed elderly man said coldly.

First Elder was silent as if he was thinking about something.

A moment later, First Elder shook his head and said, “Lock him up first and bring him to the place where the Path of Heaven arrives.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The linen-robed elderly man frowned slightly and said in confusion, “First Elder, why is it so?”

“Tsk tsk! No wonder First Elder can be in his position. The three of you are really stupid.” Without waiting for First Elder to speak, Qin Yu mocked from the side.

The three looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Shut your filthy mouth.”

First Elder was rather amused. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Then tell me why I don’t kill you.”

Qin Yu did not stand on ceremony and immediately said, “It’s very simple. You don’t want to fall out with Dean Lei, and you also know that I will never give the Traceless Immortal Scripture to you.

“Now that I’m a prisoner, at most you will take me to the day of the Path of Heaven and hand me over to the Si family. This way, Dean Lei won’t hold a grudge against your Ni family but against the Si family. Not only that, but you can also get a favor from the Si family.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s explanation, First Elder could not help but stroke his beard and laugh.

He stood up and said, “As expected of the chosen one of the current era. You’re indeed quite capable.”

Qin Yu smiled without saying a word, while the three linen-robed elderly men were somewhat angry out of humiliation.

“Cut the crap! You won’t be able to be arrogant after a few more days!” they shouted angrily.

After saying that, they grabbed Qin Yu and brought him into the interior of the warship.

The interior of the warship was just like its exterior, filled with an ancient and mysterious internal qi. Stone statues made of black divine gold were on both sides of the corridor. Each stone statue was tall and held all kinds of weapons as if they were warning intruders.

They brought Qin Yu to a cabin door and opened it. Inside was a simple prison cell.

Although this prison cell seemed to be simple, it was very sturdy. It was completely forged from black divine gold and had incredible defensive capabilities.

Not only that but the entire cell was also set up with a formation to prevent anyone from escaping.

“Just wait here obediently for your death,” a linen-robed elderly man said coldly.

With that, the door was slowly closed.

Qin Yu’s mind was extremely calm. He seemed not worried about his current situation.

A cunning look flashed in his eyes. He then slightly closed his eyes and felt the increasingly abundant dao technique around him.

The warship was heading toward where the Path of Heaven would arrive. This long journey seemed to take several days.

On the deck, First Elder placed his hands behind his back and looked into the distance. Then he sighed, “Qin Yu’s talent is definitely not inferior to my Ni family’s Holy Son.”

The linen-robed elderly man by his side nodded and said, “This kid’s strength is truly extraordinary. The Soul Chasing Chain that the three of us used was forcefully broken by him.”

The other linen-robed elderly man snorted coldly and said, “He’s just relying on the secret technique of the Traceless Immortal Scripture.”

At this point, the three looked at First Elder and said in a low voice, “First Elder, are we really giving up on the Traceless Immortal Scripture just like that?”

“Do you think he will hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture?” First Elder shook his head.

“If he doesn’t hand it over, we naturally have a way to force him to do so,” an elderly man said coldly.

“At most, we’ll just use the Soul Searching Technique,” another person added.
