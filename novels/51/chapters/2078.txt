2079 The Traceless Immortal Scripture

Xiao Sheng glanced at them coldly and sat down cross-legged without saying anything.

The target of Si Qianjing and the others was Qin Yu. Thus they ignored Xiao Sheng.

The three soon arrived at the entrance of Dragon Burial Cave.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt a little nervous. After all, the strength of the three True Saints in front of him was far beyond his.

Even with the help of the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror, Qin Yu could not shake them. No one knew how many treasures they had on them.

!!

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “I can only rely on Wu Ji’s divine robe and the suppression of the Dragon Burial Cave.”

At this moment, Si Qianjing led the three True Saints into Dragon Burial Cave.

Si Qianjing frowned the moment he stepped in.

He could clearly feel a mysterious internal qi pressing into his body now as if it would freeze all the spiritual power in his body!

Si Qianjing snorted coldly. His body shook as he activated the Meridian Circulation Technique, trying to resist the suppression!

The other two were also in the True Saint realm, so they naturally had the same abilities.

Their bodies emitted traces of light, and soon, traces of heat appeared all over.

Qin Yuhiding in Dragon Burial Cave, could not help but frown slightly. He muttered, “As expected of a True Saint. Even with the suppression of the Dragon Burial Cave, they could resist for so long…” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

However, after all, this was Dragon Burial Cave, a place where the legendary Divine Dragon was buried. Its suppression was unimaginable.

Soon, a portion of the spiritual power of the three was suppressed.

Although they could still use a portion of their spiritual power under the effect of the Meridian Circulation Technique, it had been tremendously reduced compared to the peak.

“If we don’t forcefully burn our blood essence, the three of us can’t resist this suppression,” Si Qianjing said coldly.

“That’s right. But with our current state, killing a Reversion Void Stage cultivator shouldn’t be a problem,” the other True Saint said.

With that, the three walked into the depths of Dragon Burial Cave.

However, they soon noticed something unusual because the suppression grew stronger as they got closer to Dragon Burial Cave.

What was even more terrifying was that their divine senses were like being roasted by a raging fire, and the pain was unbearable.

“Something is wrong. How did Qin Yu resist this…” Si Qianjing gritted his teeth, and his forehead was covered in a cold sweat.

Qin Yu, hiding in the dark, could not help but sneer when he saw this scene.

“It seems that even a True Saint finds it difficult to withstand this power. In that case, I have nothing to fear,” Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly recalled the scene when he first stepped into Dragon Burial Cave.

At that time, there were many skeletons of True Saints beside the dragons’ corpses. Many True Saints died when they approached the dragons’ corpses.

Although Qin Yu did not know how the dragon corpses suppressed the True Saints, it at least proved that the suppression grew stronger when getting closer to the dragon corpse.

“I don’t have to have a direct conflict with them,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he immediately walked into the depths of Dragon Burial Cave.

On the other end, the endurance of Si Qianjing and the others had clearly reached their limits. Not to mention fighting here, even moving forward had become tremendously difficult.

“This Dragon Burial Cave is indeed mysterious,” Si Qianjing endured the pain in his body and said in a low voice.

The other two True Saints seemed unable to take it anymore. Their bodies kept trembling, and they said in a low voice, “No… We have to think of another way. We can’t rashly move forward…”

Si Qianjing’s expression was cold. As a True Saint, he had never been afraid of anyone.

However, given the current situation, he could only give up for the time being or burn his blood essence to forcefully recover his strength to its peak.

“Qin Yu, you’d better hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture. Otherwise, don’t blame us for being harsh,” Si Qianjing pretended to be calm and shouted.

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but sneer and say, “Stop bluffing. So what if you’re a True Saint? Traceless Immortal Scripture is with me. Come and get it if you have the ability!”

Si Qianjing’s face darkened. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Traceless Immortal Scripture is a hot potato. It’s not something you can keep. Even if our Si family doesn’t get it, others will attack Dragon Burial Cave with all their might! At that time, you will definitely die!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

What Si Qianjing said made sense. Traceless Immortal Scripture was indeed extraordinary. Now that the news had leaked out, it would probably attract more True Saints to fight for it.

At that time, his situation would become even more dangerous.

However, Qin Yu did not intend to give up Traceless Immortal Scripture because it was too important to him.

He took a deep breath and said firmly, “In that case, I’ll wait for that day. Anyway, you can’t have Traceless Immortal Scripture now.”

Hearing this, Si Qianjing’s face darkened, and he could not help but emit a murderous aura.

However, it was too difficult to enter Dragon Burial Cave with his spiritual power frozen.

Si Qianjing looked at the other two True Saints and said, “Let’s retreat for now and think of another way. We will break through this Dragon Burial Cave sooner or later.”

The two True Saints nodded and followed Si Qianjing out.

Looking at their departing figures, Qin Yu secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

However, he knew that this was only a temporary peace. He must increase his strength within a short time to deal with the more powerful enemies he might be facing eventually.

“If I comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture as soon as possible, I’ll at least have some strength to protect myself,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Since he had already obtained the inheritance of the Traceless Immortal Scripture and even the dao name given to him by the two tribulation attendants, Qin Yu definitely would not give the Traceless Immortal Scripture to anyone.

“Since you want the Traceless Immortal Scripture so badly, I’ll destroy it!” Qin Yu sneered.

He took out the Traceless Immortal Scripture, thinking of destroying it after comprehending it.

Qin Yu held the Traceless Immortal Scripture and slowly opened it.

The moment he flipped open it, a few enormous words that flickered with golden light entered Qin Yu’s mind. “Dao follows nature, and it is innate and inherent. It contends against the heavens, and is boundless.”

At this moment, rays of light were emitted from the scripture. The light slowly condensed in front of Qin Yu and finally became a huge picture!

The picture looked empty, but it emitted an incredibly mysterious glow.

Qin Yu looked at the wordless painting and unconsciously reached out his hand to touch it.

At this moment, a mysterious force dragged Qin Yu’s divine sense into this picture. His vision instantly darkened. When he opened his eyes again, it was like he had entered another world.
