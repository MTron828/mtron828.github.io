Chapter 2412 Evil Eye, the Way of Yin and Yang

He would probably kill him without mercy if someone were beside him at this moment.

Just the internal qi alone was enough to change his soul cognition.

“Did you see that, Qin Yu? This negative emotion is in you, too. All these people have evil thoughts in their hearts. Killing them is to eliminate any remaining harmful influences of the human race.”

Ji Ao slashed his sword, and the Way of Yin and Yang turned into a vast road to hell.

Slashing at Qin Yu, this sword even cut the entire sky into two halves.

The moment Ji Ao attacked, the jade bottle in Qin Yu’s Sumeru ring floated out by itself.

The moment the jade bottle appeared, it turned into ashes scattering in the sky.

The ashes of the prince scattered and were floating in the air.

A golden true dragon qi surged up from the Yin Yang Road. In an instant, the Ghostly Sword Evil Eye trembled slightly.

The sacred power of golden light emanated from the hollow pupils of the scarecrow, and the qi of nearly 600,000 princes gathered to become the sky-soaring qi of the emperor and then fiercely exploded in front of Ji Ao.

That was the unyielding will of the royal family. The Great Xia Royal Family, which had once ruled over the entire Holy Region, had perished under this ghostly sword.

At this moment, the royal bloodline that had accumulated for a long time erupted with one final attack under the prince’s control.

“You couldn’t do anything to me even when you were alive, let alone a bunch of dead trash.”

As Ji Ao roared, the qi of Yin Yang Road exploded.

Over 600,000 souls were enveloped by the qi of Yin Yang, and in an instant, all of them ignited with chilly ghost flames.

The souls emitted intense smoke like ice cream melting, and the three souls and seven spirits were slowly crushed into powder.

These 600,000 imperial families had all the traces of existence in the world.

As the last trace of the royal soul was destroyed, a tremendously sorrowful cry came from the scarecrow’s mouth.

Those were the souls devoured by the ghostly sword in Sky City, and the souls let out angry and sorrowful sounds.

Sky City, below the Imperial City, led by the Great Xia Royal Family thousands of years ago, almost all the common people lived carefree lives. However, at some point, the members of the royal family, who treated their people like their own children, began to die one by one.

At this moment, they finally understood that the former emperor also suffered immense pain here, just like them.

Another strand of soul power rushed out from the ghostly sword. This strand of soul power was pure and reverent. They rushed into the Yin Yang Road without fear, consuming the energy within.

“A mantis’s arm blocks a chariot!”

Ji Ao casually waved his hand, and the evil spirits of the black Hell Road rushed into these souls and started to eat them crazily.

“Whoosh!”

He formed a hand seal with both hands, and a stream of ominous qi emerged from a jade bottle. This internal qi was filled with cold and obscure ominous qi, and it transformed into a qi sword in his hand that fiercely slashed toward the Five Emperor Coins.

“How dare you!”

A black scar appeared on the Five Emperor Coins on top of Ji Ao’s head and spread rapidly.

Ji Ao’s face revealed a look of fear, and in an instant, his pupils changed swiftly. His expressions alternated between smiling and gloomy and suddenly full of killing intent! He seemed to have instantly fallen into a state of confusion.

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu shouted and suddenly appeared in front of Ji Ao.

The coffin in the Sumeru ring was suddenly pulled out and opened, facing Ji Ao.

“Bang!”

Amid the terrifying energy of dead bodies, a massive tremor struck Ji Ao.

The qi of Yin Yang and the soaring energy of dead bodies mixed together, and created an earth-shaking explosion.

The entire Sky City suddenly disappeared and only reappeared after dozens of seconds in the form of a massive cloud of dust soaring several thousand feet high.

A massive cloud of dust almost enveloped the entire Holy Region. Countless cultivators instantly soared into the sky, staring at Sky City which had already turned into ashes.

“What’s going on? Has someone discovered the setup by the Ji family?”

In the Ji family, Holy Lord Ji and numerous Supreme Elders suddenly opened their eyes.

Shock flashed across their faces. Almost all the aristocratic families had informants for different opponents.

Therefore, all their most powerful combat forces had always been in the Ji family. They did not want to attract their attention to the Sky City.

“Don’t panic. Even if someone has discovered it, with Yuyi, Ao, and the ghostly sword at Great Success, no one will be able to take the ghostly sword away!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Holy Lord Ji said coldly, “All the Supreme Elders, please follow me to Sky City to bring the ghostly sword back!”

The Yao family’s Holy Lord also suddenly sensed the internal qi of the Immortal Emperor’s corpse. Countless Yao family cultivators rushed toward Sky City at the fastest speed.

“Has a rift appeared in the space of the Holy Region?”

Some cultivators were guessing.

Regardless of being curious or planning to seek opportunities, countless internal qi instantly swept toward Sky City.

In less than ten breaths, the Sky City had been heavily surrounded.

At this moment, far away from Sky City, two miserable figures suddenly appeared.

“Man with the mustache, you’re truly my biological brother!”

Qin Yu’s snot dripped on the man with the mustache’s clothes.

“Aren’t you f*cking disgusting?”

The man with the mustache was instantly furious.

However, above their heads, the internal qi of a tremendously powerful Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator flew past. Immediately, he hastily swallowed his words.

The man with the mustache’s expression was grim. His hands formed a hand seal as he and Qin Yu swiftly shuttled through space. His speed was even faster than Qin Yu’s.

“F*ck, man with the mustache, didn’t you say that you’re not interested in the path of cultivation? Even a cultivator with Tribulation First Level Way of Heaven and Earth would not be as fast as you in spatial comprehension.”

“Nonsense! Don’t you run fast instead of waiting for others to chase and kill you?”

The man with the mustache sneered and said.

After rushing for a day and a night, the two finally dared to stop and enter the Sumeru ring.

“Go to hell!”

As soon as they entered the Sumeru ring, a massive whip made a loud sound and struck Qin Yu’s chest.

“Vermillion Bird Dance!”

A cold smile appeared on Jue Wu’s face. The flames that filled the sky attacked Qin Yu.

“D*mn it! Quickly bring that ghostly sword to the edge and suppress it with formation. It’s affecting their minds!”

The man with the mustache’s expression changed drastically.

Qin Yu’s face turned ashen.

With a divine thought, spiritual energy and flowing light fluctuated on the ground in the Sumeru ring, and numerous formations soared into the sky, suppressing the Ghost Sword Evil Eye.

The others were also suppressed by Qin Yu using formations.

Although the internal qi of the ghostly sword was no longer leaking out for the time being, the killing intent on the faces of the people in the Sumeru ring did not dissipate.

After doing all this, Qin Yu’s body smashed onto the ground.

A massive sense of exhaustion surged up, and he almost fainted.

“Don’t you f*cking faint! If you fall now and this ghostly sword causes trouble again, we’ll be wiped out!”

The man with the mustache was shocked and quickly came over to slap Qin Yu.
