Chapter 1457: Chapter 1,457, Huangji Buddha Flame! 1

Under the desolate God’s eyes, Qin Yu finally saw the white-robed Daoist clearly.

He was rapidly shuttling through space and closing in on him.

Just as he closed in, Qin Yu clenched his fist, and the Golden Fist arrived with a Bang!

“Boom!”

With a loud bang, the Void was directly shattered! And the white-robed elder also staggered out from within!

Qin Yu looked coldly at the white-robed Daoist and said, “Why? Does the first elder not dare to come out and send a little trash out to die?”

The white-robed Daoist looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “You are Qin Yu? Just now, it was just an appetizer. Don’t be anxious.”

“You can scram back. I’m Looking for the first elder,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The white-robed Daoist sneered, “If you want to see the great elder, it depends on whether you have the ability or not.”

With that, the white-robed Daoist suddenly raised his palm and slid toward the void in front of him.

In a moment, the space around Qin Yu suddenly exploded!

Without waiting for Qin Yu to react, his body directly fell into the void!

It was pitch-black around him, and there seemed to be countless sharp blades in the void that kept slashing toward Qin Yu’s body!

The white-clothed Daoist was not a person who liked to play. He wanted to end the battle as soon as possible so that the heavenly cloud sect could regain their face!

Therefore, the white-clothed Daoist directly took out the chime bell.

The instant the chime bell appeared, space immediately rippled.

Wisps of aura that only belonged to the return to void stage were reverberating.

“It’s a return to void stage weapon! The Heavenly Cloud sect actually directly used a return to void stage weapon!”

“This is one of the Tianyun sect’s hidden forces. It seems like they are really serious this time.”

“Not necessarily. Before sect master makes a move, no one knows what the result will be.”

As he spoke, the white-robed Daoist’s hand had already stretched out his aura and entered the chime.

Rays of light trembled on the chime and spread out!

The white-robed Daoist planned to directly shatter Qin Yu and that space! He did not give Qin Yu the slightest chance to escape!

“Qin Yu, remember in your next life. Do not offend the Heavenly Cloud Sect,”the white-robed Daoist said coldly.

With that, the radiance instantly arrived!

This was the aura of the return to void stage. Its power was boundless. Ten thousand strands of resplendent radiance shattered the void! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

All the radiance exploded in the void where Qin Yu was!

Everything disappeared in an instant. It was as if the entire world was on the verge of destruction!

The terrifying return to void stage aura continued to surge in all directions. Cracks appeared in the void, and in the end, it directly exploded!

The entire void instantly lost its color. It was as if it had separated from this world. It was incomparably terrifying!

“This... This is a return to void stage artifact...”someone was in extreme pain. Blood continuously gushed out from his mouth.

There were even people whose pores were bleeding. This was the power of a void-returning artifact, and it was incomparably terrifying!

Even the surrounding spectators had suffered such an impact. Qin Yu, who was at the center of the storm, could be imagined!

“It’s over,”the white-robed Daoist said indifferently.

Everyone stared at the space that had been blasted through, as if waiting for the light to dim to see Qin Yu’s current condition.

“Don’t think about it. I’m afraid he didn’t even leave behind a corpse,”someone said.

“That might not be the case. Although the Heavenly Cloud sect is strong, who knows if Qin Yu has any supreme treasures on him? Don’t forget that Qin Yu is very close to Jue Wu and Wen Wanli.”

Everyone discussed animatedly, and finally, the light gradually dissipated.

Qin Yu’s clothes were tattered, and his body was enveloped by a ray of light.

Under this light, Qin Yu was gasping for air. It was obvious that he was also in an extremely sorry state.

With a closer look, one could clearly see that Qin Yu’s body was emitting traces of flames.

And it was this kind of flame that saved Qin Yu’s life.

“Fortunately, there’s the Huangji Buddha Flame...”Qin Yu held the flame in his hand and said in a low voice.

This was the Huangji Buddha flame that came from Huangji Mountain! It was said that this item was transformed from the corpse qi of a grand cultivator, and it was extremely powerful!

Qin Yu had relied on the Huangji Buddha flame to withstand this void transformation attack!

“Eh? He didn’t die?”

“Look, what is he holding in his hand!”

“It seems to be... The Huangji Buddha Flame! How could this guy have the Huangji Buddha Flame in his hand? !”

“The Huangji Buddha Flame seemed to have appeared in the GU city auction not long ago, but it disappeared in the chaotic battle. Could it have been taken away by Qin Yu? !”

Even the white-robed Daoist widened his eyes. He looked at the Huangji Buddha Flame in Qin Yu’s hand with excitement!

“Brat, why is the Huangji Buddha Flame in your hands? !”The white-robed Daoist shouted loudly.

Qin Yu sneered, “What does this have to do with you?”

The white-robed Daoist said with a solemn face, “If you are willing to hand over the Huangji Buddha Flame to me, I can spare your life and let you leave.”

“F * ck you. Today, I came to find trouble with the Heavenly Cloud Sect, not you,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

The white-robed Daoist took a deep breath and suppressed the excitement in his heart. He said with a cold smile, “Alright. After I kill you, this Huangji Buddhic Flame will naturally be mine.”

“Hahaha, that will depend on whether you have the ability or not!”

Qin Yu put away the Huangji Buddha Flame. All the spells were activated at this moment!
