Chapter 1202: Chapter 1,202, shattered with a single slap! 

They had already seen through Qin Yu’s flaws!

From the moment he appeared to the moment he killed the Almighty, he hadn’t used any spirit energy.

This was enough to prove that the current Qin Yu could only rely on his physical body to fight!

He Teng also saw through this peculiarity.

He, who had originally been in despair, now had a glimmer of hope in his heart.

Since he couldn’t use his spiritual power, then no matter how strong his physical body was, he still had a chance to kill them!

“I’ve really underestimated you.”Qin Yu looked up at the people shooting backward in the sky and couldn’t help but sneer.

“But so what? Even if I can’t use my spiritual power, I can still kill you!”

After saying that, Qin Yu stomped his feet and his body rose up from the ground.

A deep crack was left on the ground. Relying on the enormous strength under his feet, he shot toward the twenty-some mighty figures!

“Buzz!”

A mighty figure stretched out his palm and threw out a large golden net, blocking Qin Yu’s path.

This large net instinctively bound people, but in front of Qin Yu, it held on tightly for half a second before it was forcefully torn apart.

In half a second, they had already retreated several hundred meters.

And there was even a mighty figure who took advantage of this opportunity to rely on his ability to travel through space to form seals!

Several large seals suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu and stuck onto Qin Yu’s body at an extremely fast speed.

This large seal was extremely strange. It was like a poisonous insect that wanted to follow Qin Yu’s pores and drill into his body, disintegrating Qin Yu’s body from the inside!

“This seal can enter his bones through his pores and shatter his body,”a mighty figure said coldly.

“Wait for me to use a little bit of my strength. I’ll definitely be able to kill him!”

After saying this, this mighty figure slowly closed his eyes. He raised his finger and muttered something, as though he was silently chanting an incantation as he controlled that strange seal out of thin air.

But in a short moment, a hint of confusion flashed across his face.

“What’s Wrong?”A mighty expert asked.

“Where... where are the pores on his body? This great seal is simply unable to invade his body!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s body trembled, and the Great Seal had already been shaken off his body.

All the great seals exploded to the side, leaving pitch-black marks in the air.

Qin Yu’s face was cold as he continued to shoot towards them.

“Before I go to the Holy Region, I must kill all of you,”Qin Yu said coldly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Qin Yu, don’t be arrogant. So what if you have an unparalleled physical body? We can still slowly exhaust you to death!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Exhaust me to death? Do you think the spiritual power is being consumed faster or the physical body is being consumed faster?”The corner of Qin Yu’s mouth curled into a sneer.

Just as Qin Yu had said, all spells relied on spirit energy as the foundation.

However, the consumption of spirit energy was often extremely fast. Even mighty figures would not be able to last long in a battle.

However, the physical body was different. All the power of the physical body came from the main body and did not rely on spirit energy at all.

At Qin Yu’s level, even if they fought for a month, he would still be able to maintain his peak!

After Qin Yu’s reminder, the expressions of these mighty figures changed slightly.

“Our blood and Qi have dried up. I’m afraid we won’t be able to hold on for too long.”A mighty figure secretly said that things weren’t looking good.

In truth, some of the mighty figures had already begun to sense the decline of their internal Qi.

The spells they had unleashed were all shattered by Qin Yu with a single punch. If this continued, they would probably be exhausted to death by Qin Yu.

“We can’t keep fighting like this. Either we negotiate, or we fight to the death and kill him!”Someone suggested.

“Negotiate? Do you think a person like Qin Yu would negotiate with you?”He Teng took a deep breath.

A trace of coldness flashed across his eyes as he said in a low voice, “Everyone, join hands. No matter what price we have to pay, we must kill him. Otherwise, we will definitely die!”

After hearing he Teng’s words, the many mighty figures also found their target.

They controlled the distance between them and Qin Yu while attacking at the edges.

Although Qin Yu’s physical body was strong, the rain-like spells that filled the sky also gave him a headache. There was nowhere to hide.

The rays of light slapped on Qin Yu’s steel-like body, emitting a deafening explosion.

These people were all almighty experts after all, and the spells they controlled weren’t simple. Even if they couldn’t kill Qin Yu, they still brought a trace of pain.

Bang

Under the Torchlight, Qin Yu was repeatedly beaten back.

The experienced almighty experts immediately seized this opportunity and unleashed their spells.

A large hand that flickered with a terrifying light suddenly stretched out from Qin Yu’s back.

This large hand was grayish-white in color, and every inch of it was as sharp as a blade. Even the hairs on the palm could cut through steel!

The large hand stretched out from the void, and there was practically nowhere to hide. The hand even circled around Qin Yu’s back and suddenly stabbed towards Qin Yu’s eyes!

“Die!”A mighty figure roared angrily.

At such a critical moment, not only did Qin Yu not panic in the slightest, he even revealed a trace of an ice-cold smile.

“Now!”

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. He raised his arms and smashed them towards his back!

The power of this elbow strike was unparalleled. In an instant, it shattered the void behind him and smashed ruthlessly at the Almighty expert hiding in the Void!

Under this elbow strike, that almighty expert instantly fell out of the void, and fresh blood flowed out of his mouth.

Qin Yu did not give him any chance to speak. He raised his hand and sent a huge palm towards his head.

“Pa!”

The crisp sound was extremely ear-piercing. At this moment, fresh blood bloomed like a bewitching flower. His head and primordial spirit were instantly shattered!

The many mighty figures in the distance were extremely terrified. Their faces revealed a look of fear.

That was a mighty figure! The body of a mighty figure was incomparably powerful. Every inch of flesh and blood was a treasure. But now, it was shattered by a single slap!

What was even more frightening was that the mighty figure, whose survival ability was extremely strong, had not even been able to escape his primordial spirit and had died under this slap.
