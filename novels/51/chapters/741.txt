Chapter 742: The Trick of a Ten-thousand-year-old Herb Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Granny Qin played with the herb and couldn’t help but frown. “Five-thousand-year-old herb? Didn’t they say that a ten-thousand-year-old herb was born?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Granny Qin, this seems to be a five-thousand-year-old herb.” Someone walked up and said.

“Yes, according to my experience, this doesn’t seem to be a ten-thousand-year-old herb.”

Granny Qin frowned even more when she heard everyone’s words.

According to her own experience, this was indeed not a 10,000-year-old herb.

However, according to the information she received, it was indeed a 10,000-year-old herb that would be born today.

“Could it be that the information I received was wrong?” Granny Qin frowned and asked.

Chou Heguang said in a deep voice, “Granny Qin, many of the information isn’t so accurate. Perhaps someone has mixed up the 5,000-year-old herb with the 10,000-year-old herb.”

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes slightly.

She thought for a moment and said, “Wait here.”

Granny Qin waited here with the eight purple-robed men. She didn’t leave for a long time.

For more than half an hour, the place was still calm and there was no disturbance.

“It seems that the information is indeed wrong.” Granny Qin stood up from the ground.

She put away the 5,000-year-old herb and said in a low voice, “It’s really not worth wasting so much manpower for a 5,000-year-old herb!”

“Yeah, so many of us came all the way here and didn’t even get a single thing,” someone at the side pointed at the mulberry tree and cursed.

Granny Qin glanced at him and snorted. “No one can snatch what the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wants.”

Although everyone was unhappy, Granny Qin’s words made some sense.

In this world, not many people could go against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. After all, not everyone was Qin Yu.

“Since we have the item, we should go back,” Granny Qin said.

“Granny Qin, then... should I go with you?” Chou heguang walked forward and asked.

Granny Qin nodded slightly and said, “Yes, follow me back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Thank you, Granny Qin!” Chou Heguang was immediately overjoyed and nodded excitedly.

Granny Qin left the scene, so the others naturally had no reason to stay.

The group of people left one after another, while Qin Yu and the others were still waiting in the southeast direction.

“Just now, there was an explosion of light in the east, and there was a strong medicinal fragrance. Could it be that there was a problem with our deduction?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

It was already afternoon, but the so-called ten-thousand-year-old herb still showed no signs of being born. This made people have no choice but to suspect it.

“Let’s wait a little longer.” The man with the mustache said with a frown.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He could only continue waiting here.

At this moment, Granny Qin walked over from not far away with her people.

Seeing Granny Qin, Qin Yu frowned slightly and stood up subconsciously.

Granny Qin glanced at Qin Yu and couldn’t help but ridicule, “The herb had already been obtained. What are you waiting for?”

“The herb has been obtained?” Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

Granny Qin hadn’t said anything when Chou Heguang said proudly, “That’s right! Didn’t you guys not believe in my deduction? In the end? The herb indeed appeared in the east!”

“On the other hand, you guys haven’t seen a single thing, right?”

Hearing Chou Heguang’s ridicule, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache couldn’t help but look at each other.

Could it be... that the deduction was really wrong?

“Hehe, this place doesn’t look like it can produce treasures no matter how you look at it.” Chou Heguang said with a cold smile.

Qin Yu was somewhat unwilling. He looked at Granny Qin coldly and said with a nonchalant smile, “Are you bragging? If the thing was really born in the east, how could things be so peaceful? How could so many people would be willing to let you take away the herb?”

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and said, “Little b*stard, you don’t know your place, but it doesn’t mean that everyone else doesn’t know their place!”

“Who would dare to snatch something that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wants?” Granny Qin snorted coldly.

“Stop bragging. If you didn’t get the herb, you didn’t get it. What are you bragging about?” Tang Mo also ridiculed.

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes slightly and sneered. “Little b*stard, are you trying to goad me?”

Qin Yu remained silent.

Just as Granny Qin said, Qin Yu wanted to goad her into taking out the herb.

“If you really have the herb, take them out and let us take a look,” said Qin Yu.

“Old b*stard, you’re afraid we’ll take it away if you take it out, right?” Said Qin Yu with a nonchalant smile.

Granny Qin said with a cold look, “Okay, then I’ll make you give up!”

After saying that, Granny Qin stretched out her palm and a crystal clear herb fell into her palm.

The moment the herb appeared, a medicinal fragrance assailed his nostrils.

Qin Yu stared at the herb and his brows immediately furrowed.

“No... this is clearly a five-thousand-year-old herb,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

As an apothecary, Qin Yu was naturally very sensitive to the age of the herb.

With one glance, he could tell that there was something wrong with this ‘ten-thousand-year-old herb’.

Just as Qin Yu was about to speak, the man with the mustache on the side quietly tugged at Qin Yu’s arm.

Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and immediately understood and didn’t say anything more.

“Little b*stard, did you see that?” Chou Heguang imitated Granny Qin’s tone and said.

Qin Yu glanced at Chou Heguang and snorted lightly. “Lackey.”

Chou Heguang wasn’t angry. Instead, he said somewhat proudly, “Little b*stard, you still dare to doubt my deductive ability? What a joke!”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Chou Heguang anymore, so he moved to the side.

“Qin Yu, don’t forget the agreement between you and me in half a month,” Granny Qin said darkly.

After saying this, she left with her people.

After Granny Qin left, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache.

“What’s going on? Whats he’s holding is clearly a 5,000-year-old herb. It’s not a 10,000-year-old herb at all,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

The man with the mustache said with a sneer, “To be honest, I was also wondering if there was a problem with our deduction just now. But after seeing the herb in her hand, I gave up the idea.”

Qin Yu was a little puzzled and asked, “What do you mean?”

The man with the mustache said, “For herbs, 10,000 years is a watershed. Once the medicinal effect of 10,000 years is reached, it can be regarded as a top-grade herb, and it will develop intelligence.”

“Many 10,000-year-old herbs will come up with a series of measures to prevent being caught when they are born.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu seemed to have understood something.

He said in a deep voice, “In other words... that 5,000-year-old herb is a trick to deliberately lure away attention?”

“That’s right.” The man with the mustache nodded.

“It used a 5,000-year-old herb to attract everyone’s attention to hide itself!”

Qin Yu immediately felt a little surprised.

“These herbs can actually be so scheming?” Qin Yu exclaimed.

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “This isn’t scheming. To put it bluntly, this is a natural law of the birth of ten-thousand-year-old herb.”

“Just wait and see. A ten-thousand-year-old herb will definitely be born here!”
