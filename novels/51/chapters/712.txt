After coming out of seclusion, Kong Yun wanted to establish his might. Seeing the black-haired young man in front of him, Kong Yun naturally wouldn’t miss the chance.

He took a step forward and coldly looked at the black-haired young man while saying, “You’re quite cocky.”

The black-haired young man quietly said, “You’re not bad, but in my eyes, you’re not strong enough.”

“Madman!” Kong Yun immediately flew into a rage!

He held the destructive power in his hand and fiercely punched at the black-haired youth!

The black-haired youth didn’t dodge. He raised his fist and met it head-on.

“Clang!”

A sound that sounded like steel clashing was immediately heard!

Under this tremendous force, Kong Yun was forced back three steps in succession. His fist was even shaken until it was in pain!

On the other hand, the black-haired young man wasn’t affected at all!

All of a sudden, everyone was shocked!

“What a tough body!” Zhuang Teng exclaimed.

“His skin is like a layer of armor...” Chu Heng murmured in a low voice.

Kong Yun’s expression was extremely ugly, but he had always been a person who refused to admit defeat, so how could he just let it go?

“This punch is nothing,” Kong Yun said coldly.

The internal qi on his body was rapidly increasing, and the power of the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm instantly erupted.

After sensing the internal qi on his body, a powerful pressure immediately pressed down on him!

“Late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

These geniuses of the aristocratic families indeed lived up to their reputation! It had only been a short while, but Kong Yun had actually stepped into the advanced stage of the Martial Marquis Realm!

The black-haired young man’s expression was still calm. They couldn’t even feel the slightest fluctuation of internal qi from him.

“Alright, let’s stop here.” At this moment, Granny Qin suddenly stood up.

She looked at Kong Yun and said, “If you want to fight in the future, there will be plenty of opportunities.”

Although Kong Yun was unwilling, he still agreed to Granny Qin.

Not far away, Blackie quietly looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

“My target is you.” Blackie stretched out his finger and pointed at Qin Yu.

The moment he raised his arm, Qin Yu realized that there was a palm print on Blackie’s abdomen.

Blackie’s face seemed to have been injured.

These wounds seemed familiar.

“What do you mean?” Blackie’s words infuriated Kong Yun once again!

“Do you think that I’m inferior to him, Qin Yu?” Kong Yun flew into a rage.

Blackie completely ignored Kong Yun. He only shot a cold glance at Qin Yu before leaving with Granny Qin.

Kong Yun’s face was livid with anger. He gritted his teeth and looked at Qin Yu while saying, “Qin Yu, does he think that I’m inferior to you?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “You’re the best. You’re the best in the world.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left.

He walked toward the martial arts academy.

On the way, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of the palm print on Blackie’s chest.

“I must have seen that palm print before...” Qin Yu touched his chin and thought to himself.

“Huh?”

Soon, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something!

Wasn’t this fist print on the body of the Heaven Swallowing Python?

And the injury on Blackie’s face was also caused by a punch from Burly!

“Could it be... that Blackie is the Heaven Swallowing Python?” Qin Yu immediately turned pale with fright!

If that was the case, it was quite reasonable.

As an apothecary, Qin Yu knew of a kind of pill that could transform demonic beasts into human forms.

That pill was called the shape-changing pill, but the refining conditions were extremely harsh. Even Qin Yu might not be able to have 100% success.

“Looks like Granny Qin is very interested in the Heaven Swallowing Python.” Qin Yu touched his chin and said in a low voice.

“No wonder his body is so tough. I remember that this Heaven Swallowing Python... is at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm, right?” Qin Yu’s expression immediately became somewhat ugly!

Even if it was an ordinary human at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm, Qin Yu couldn’t do anything to him, let alone a demon beast at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!

“Qin Yu! Go and tell that black-haired young man for me that I, Kong Yun, will invite him to battle at Daming Mountain three days later!” At this moment, Kong Yun suddenly caught up.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at him and said, “If you don’t want to die, don’t touch him.”

“That black-haired young man didn’t use his full strength just now. Otherwise, you would have died a long time ago.”

“What nonsense!” Kong Yun was instantly furious!

“I am at the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm. How could I fear him? Among my peers, even Yan Jinyao is nothing to me!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If you want to go, then go by yourself. But I have to remind you that this black-haired young man is in the peak stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.”

After saying this, Qin Yu shook off Kong Yun.

That day, Yan Jinyao didn’t show up.

However, Han Wei and the others came to the scene one after another.

As disciples of an aristocratic family, they had high talent. Naturally, they joined this academy easily.

As for ordinary people, they had to go through layers of selection, even Qin Yu.

Just as Qin Yu was queuing, a sinister voice suddenly came from the side.

“Qin Yu, we meet again...” that voice gave people goosebumps!

Turning around, Qin Yu realized that the person who came was actually He Teng!

“He Teng, you’re actually still alive!” Qin Yu’s body immediately erupted with terrifying killing intent.

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “You’re not dead, so of course I won’t die...”

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste time with He Teng. He said coldly, “Let me ask you, what’s going on with Fang Yue? Tell me and I’ll spare your life.”

“Hehe, Fang Yue... is just an ant at the bottom. Why are you so persistent...” He Teng said darkly.

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

Fang Yue was very talented. If it weren’t for He Teng, she would definitely occupy a place among the younger generation!

But now, Fang Yue was still staying in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion while on the brink of death. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Are you going to tell me or not?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, do you think I’m afraid of you?”

The two people’s internal qi immediately collided with each other.

In the middle of the two people, waves of air currents even formed.

“If you want to fight, I’ll fight with you!”

At this moment, a rough voice suddenly came from not far away!

They saw a strong man descending from the sky!

Seeing this person, Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

Because the person who came was none other than Chang Mang!

“Chang Mang? Weren’t you captured?” Qin Yu asked in a daze.

Chang Mang strode in front of Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, let’s catch up later. Let me kill this b*stard first!”

He Teng smiled sinisterly and said, “Saintly Body Chang Mang... Tsk Tsk, interesting.”

“Don’t worry, we still have a long time. We have plenty of opportunities to fight.” He Teng snorted lightly.

He turned around to leave.

“Don’t go!” Chang Mang’s anger flared up again. He was just about to chase after him when he was stopped by Qin Yu.

“This isn’t the right time to fight. We have plenty of time to deal with him.” Qin Yu shook his head and said.
