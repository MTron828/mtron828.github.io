Chapter 758: Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After coming out of the bathroom, Qin Yu found Xiao Yu and the man with the mustache waiting for him at the door.

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “Why don’t you go out and look around the mall?”

“What’s there to look around in the mall?” Xiao Yu shook her head.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said with a smile, “Don’t little girls like to go shopping?”

Xiao Yu didn’t say much about this.

The man with the mustache pointed upstairs and said, “The top floor of this mall is an antique market. Hurry up and take a look. Maybe you can pick up some treasures.”

“Antique market?” A trace of interest appeared in Qin Yu’s eyes.

Qin Yu was naturally uninterested in ordinary antiques.

But among these antiques, it was very likely that some unknown treasure was hidden.

After all, the martial arts world of many years ago was completely different from the present.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu nodded.

The three of them headed upstairs.

They arrived at the top floor.

As soon as they entered the door, Qin Yu felt a trace of a sinister internal qi.

Although the internal qi wasn’t dense, it was a real dark energy.

“It seems that there are really treasures in this antiques market.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Xiao Yu also frowned and said, “There is dark energy. Perhaps it is an antique excavated from the tomb.”

Qin Yu released his divine sense and covered the entire antique market.

Soon, Qin Yu found that there were many martial artists hiding in this antique market.

There were Inner Strength Grandmasters, Martial Marquises, and even a Martial Marquis at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm.

“Hiss...”

At this time, the man with the mustache suddenly inhaled a breath of cold air.

He sniffed his nose and said with some surprise, “I keep feeling like there’s some treasure here that’s summoning me.”

“Summoning you?” Qin Yu frowned, his face showing some confusion.

The man with the mustache explained, “Although I’m an expert in archaeology, many times, it’s the treasure that’s summoning me.”

“In other words, I was forced to become an expert in archaeology.”

“Shameless.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache didn’t say anything. He felt the call and strode forward.

Qin Yu and Xiao Yu followed behind him.

The man with the mustache closed his eyes and relied on the call to walk forward.

After going around in circles, he passed by many antique stalls.

Finally, the man with the mustache stopped at an extremely large stall.

He suddenly opened his eyes and said in a deep voice, “It’s here.”

Looking down, he saw several treasures on the stall.

There were weapons, spiritual artifacts, paintings, and antiques.

Qin Yu released his divine sense and covered the stall.

Soon, Qin Yu felt a trace of internal qi from the antiques.

“It really is a treasure,” Qin Yu said in surprise.

The man with the mustache sniffed his nose and kept touching the antiques with his palm.

Qin Yu didn’t stay idle either. He used his powerful divine sense to search for treasures.

Soon, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache put their hands on a calabash at the same time.

The calabash looked ordinary, and its surface was almost cracking.

Qin Yu and the man with the mustache exchanged a look. They seemed to have the same idea.

“This calabash looks ordinary, and there isn’t much internal qi fluctuation, but I can feel an extremely old aura hidden in it,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The man with the mustache said, “I can feel it. This calabash is the one that summoned me.”

Qin Yu reached out and took the gourd in his hand.

He looked at the stall owner and asked, “How much is this gourd?”

The stall owner glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Five billion, or an equivalent treasure to exchange for it.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu and the man with the man with the mustache couldn’t help but gasp.

“Five billion? Why don’t you go rob money?!” The man with the man with the mustache said with his eyes widened.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “What he meant was that he didn’t want to exchange it with money, so he said an exaggerated amount.”

“Wise man.” The stall owner nodded and said.

The man with the mustache scratched his head and immediately took out a treasure from his Spatial Magic Artifact.

For a time, all kinds of spiritual artifacts appeared one after another. What was surprising was that these spiritual artifacts were all high-quality items.

Even the stall owner in front of him was stunned. He gulped and said, “Where did you get so many spiritual artifacts?”

The man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry about it. Just pick one yourself.”

The stall owner didn’t stand on ceremony. He immediately began to pick from the pile of spiritual artifacts.

A few minutes later, the stall owner picked up a bead and said, “This one.”

The man with the mustache glanced at the bead and muttered, “You’re quite picky. This is a Buddhist bead from the western regions. It contains a trace of the power of Buddhism.”

“What? You don’t agree? If you don’t agree, then forget it.” The stall owner pretended to take the gourd back.

“Who said I don’t agree?” The man with the mustache anxiously stopped the stall owner.

The stall owner said with a smile, “Okay, then it’s settled. I...”

“What a pile of worthless scrap metal. You have the nerve to take them out?”

Just as the two sides were about to reach an agreement, a voice suddenly came from the side.

A graceful young man was standing by Qin Yu’s side.

Qin Yu frowned.

That peak-stage Martial Marquis’ internal qi just now came from this young man’s body.

It was even more difficult to see through the strength of the two old men who followed him.

“Who are you talking about?” The man with the mustache said unhappily. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The young man said indifferently, “Put away your pile of scrap metal. You’re embarrassing yourself.”

“You dare to say that this is scrap metal?” The man with the mustache immediately became anxious. He rolled up his sleeves with a face full of anger.

“How dare you speak to our young master like that? You’re courting death!”

At this moment, the two old men beside the young man took a step forward and shouted loudly.

Their bodies emitted waves of powerful pressure, making it difficult for people to breathe.

The man with the mustache’s expression changed, and he hurriedly hid behind Qin Yu.

The young man glanced at the man with the mustache and said indifferently, “Let me introduce myself. My name is Luo Yang. You can call me Young Master Luo.”

“Luo Yang?” Hearing this title, the stall owner immediately stood up.

“So you are the son of the Pavilion Master of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets. Sorry for my disrespect!” The stall owner said respectfully.

Qin Yu frowned.

Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets? What was that?

Luo Yang sized up the man with the mustache and said, “You should have heard of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets, right?”

The man with the mustache was obviously afraid and hid behind Qin Yu without saying a word.

The two old men beside Luo Yang looked at the man with the mustache coldly and said, “How dare you insult our Young Master? You deserve a slap!”

After saying that, the two men strode forward and reached out to grab the man with the mustache.

At this moment, Qin Yu reached out his hand and grabbed the arms of the two men.

“Young Master Luo, right?” Qin Yu glanced at him.

Luo Yang looked Qin Yu up and down and said, “What?”

Qin Yu said, “Everyone is here for the treasure. Since it’s for the treasure, the one with the highest price will get it. There’s no need to fight.”
