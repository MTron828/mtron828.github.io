Chapter 1110: Chapter 1,110 lied to You! 

Qin Yu sat at the side and waited quietly.

At the same time, his divine sense covered the entire cloud dragon island, ready to find an opportunity to escape.

“According to the geographical situation here, I’m afraid I can only escape to the sea,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

With the cloud dragon’s ability, it was definitely not an easy task to stop Qin Yu, but it was also very difficult for him to leave this place.

“I don’t care,”Qin Yu said in his heart.

“Let’s escape from this Cloud Dragon Island first.”

At worst, he could just float on the sea and find a boat sooner or later.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and waited quietly for Yun Long.

About ten minutes later, this flower field was swept clean by Yun Long.

He held a large bouquet of strange flowers and walked in front of Qin Yu.

“Here you go.”Yun long threw the strange flowers on the ground.

“Hurry up. You only have half a month,”yun long exhorted.

Qin Yu picked up a strange flower from the ground and put it on the tip of his nose to sniff it.

“Yes, that’s the smell.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“Of course. Hurry up and refine the heavenly essence pill. Don’t waste time,”yun long urged.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered, “Don’t worry. The Heaven origin pill is extremely important to me. I naturally won’t waste time.”

Then, Qin Yu’s mind moved and directly put these strange flowers into the spatial divine tool.

Then, Qin Yu slowly stood up.

He stretched and said, “Okay, mission completed.”

Yun long frowned and said coldly, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “What do you mean? It seems that your brain is not very good.”

Yun Long’s expression became even uglier. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Where is the strange flower? Why did you keep it?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Because it’s mine! Idiot, do you really think that I will refine the Heavenly Essence Pill for you?”

Yun long immediately flew into a rage. He glared at Qin Yu and shouted, “You are courting death!”

After saying that, he raised his hand and grabbed at Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu had no intention of fighting with him. His figure immediately rose up and soared into the air.

“Tell your master that the strange flower is mine!”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yun Long’s face was livid with anger. He gritted his teeth and said, “You dare to trick us, Kid? I’ll tear you into pieces!”

With that, he charged at Qin Yu again.

However, Qin Yu was already prepared. He immediately executed the ‘xing’character and fled at an extremely fast speed.

Yun long naturally would not sit idly by and quickly chased after him.

However, with the ‘xing’character, Qin Yu’s speed was far above Yun Long’s. In almost an instant, Qin Yu’s figure disappeared without a trace, leaving Yun long standing alone in the same spot, helpless and furious.

“You dare lie to us? I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you! !”

Yun long roared angrily, causing the entire Cloud Dragon Island to buzz!

Soon, the mighty figure was jolted awake by the voice.

A strand of his divine sense floated out as he asked in a deep voice, “What’s going on?”

Yun Long’s expression froze as he said in a trembling voice, “That kid... that kid, he...”

“What’s wrong with him? Quickly tell me!”The almighty seemed to have realized that something was wrong.

Yun long gritted his teeth and said, “He ran away with the strange flower...”

“What! ?”The Almighty’s expression instantly turned into one of utter defeat! Anger filled his chest and rushed straight to his mind!

“Didn’t I tell you to keep an eye on him! You Trash!”The Almighty said through gritted teeth.

Yun long hurriedly said, “Master, I... I’ll go look for him right now. I Promise I’ll bring him back!”

“There’s a sea all around us. He won’t be able to escape far!”

“Then hurry up and Go!”The mighty figure roared.

Yun Long didn’t dare to waste any more time. He hurriedly followed the direction Qin Yu had fled in and quickly chased after him.

At this moment, Qin Yu was running on the surface of the sea.

He released his divine sense and covered the surrounding surface of the sea.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu did not discover any ships.

Other than an idiot like Gong Tianyu, no one else would set foot in such a place.

“Looks like I can only rely on myself to escape,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The surface of the sea was extremely vast. Who knew how long it would take to return to the mainland.

Moreover, there was a cloud dragon chasing after him.

However, Qin Yu had no other choice at the moment. He could only try his best to escape.

After escaping for dozens of nautical miles in one breath, Qin Yu finally stopped.

His divine sense covered his surroundings. As long as the cloud dragon arrived, he would be able to detect it immediately.

‘I’ll rest for a while. If the cloud dragon catches up in front of me, I might be able to kill him,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

At the thought of this, his entire body sank into the surface of the sea. At the same time, he executed the water avoidance art.

With the water avoidance art, Qin Yu was able to move freely under the sea.

His entire body continued to sink, and the water pressure became stronger and stronger.

Even Qin Yu’s body was beginning to be unable to withstand it.

His body emitted a golden glow as he resisted the water pressure.

As his body continued to sink, the water pressure continued to increase.

Crack

The golden glow surrounding Qin Yu’s body directly exploded, causing cracks to appear. Following that, it directly exploded!

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted together. The enormous water pressure almost made him unable to breathe.

Buzz

Helpless, Qin Yu could only use the true body of azure wood. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

However, the true body of azure wood consumed a lot of spiritual qi, so Qin Yu probably couldn’t last long.

“HMM?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly realized that there seemed to be something unusual under the sea.

As his body sank, the surrounding sea water became much warmer.
