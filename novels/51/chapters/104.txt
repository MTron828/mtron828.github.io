Chapter 105: Experience Love In Its Purest Form Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Miss... Miss Yan, it’s really you...” Looking at Yan Ruoxue, who was in front of him, Liu Shihui was filled with regret!

He thought that he had escaped a disaster yesterday, and today, he met her again!

To Liu Shihui, the humiliation he experienced these two days was more than what he had experienced in his entire life!

Without thinking, he knelt on the ground with a plop!

To Liu Shihui, doing such a thing in front of so many people was worse than death!

A short distance away, Cheng Lei and the others were dumbstruck.

What was going on? Liu Shihui actually knelt down?

“Miss... Miss Yan, I’m sorry. It’s my fault for not disciplining her properly...” Liu Shihui lowered his head and said.

Yan Ruoxue looked at Liu Shihui and said indifferently, “The Liu family is really imposing. How can you guys commandeer public places as you guys please?”

“No, no, this is definitely not the Liu family’s intention!” Liu Shihui hurriedly waved his hand and said.

Yan Ruoxue snorted lightly. She glanced at Cheng Lei and said, “I don’t like that person.”

“Miss Yan, don’t worry. I definitely won’t let her off lightly!” Liu Shihui hurriedly said.

Yan Ruoxue waved her hand and said, “You can leave now. Don’t disturb us.”

“Yes, yes.” Liu Shihui immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

He stood up from the ground and walked in front of Cheng Lei. He raised his hand and slapped her face!

“D*mn you!” Liu Shihui said through gritted teeth.

Cheng Lei was so scared that she couldn’t speak. Liu Shihui’s attitude was obvious. The other party was definitely not someone the Liu family could afford to offend!

“I was wrong, Young Master Liu...” Cheng Lei sobbed softly.

Liu Shihui didn’t say anything. He just waved his hand and the people around him dragged Cheng Lei to the car.

The scene finally quieted down.

After these big shots from South City greeted Yan Ruoxue, they left in a hurry.

“Let’s go. We’re going to ride the Ferris wheel,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

“Okay... Okay,” Qin Yu agreed with a bitter smile.

However, he had mixed feelings inside.

Every time he was with Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu could feel a strong sense of powerlessness.

This kind of gap in status and power put a lot of pressure on Qin Yu, but he couldn’t help but feel motivated as well.

The two of them took the tickets for the Ferris wheel and walked into the Ferris wheel venue.

The rest of the tourists stood outside and didn’t dare to go forward.

Facing a figure like Yan Ruoxue, they were afraid that they might accidentally get themselves into trouble.

Yan Ruoxue looked at the tourists who were looking at her from outside and said with a smile, “You guys can come along. No one is allowed to commandeer public places, not even me.”

When everyone heard this, they walked into the Ferris wheel with caution.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue sat on the Ferris wheel while quietly waiting for it to turn.

“Shall we take a group photo?” Yan Ruoxue suddenly said.

Qin Yu obviously had no objections and agreed without thinking.

Yan Ruoxue took the phone and leaned her face against Qin Yu.

Then, she gestured with her hand and pressed the shutter button.

“Not enough, not enough, I need to take more pictures!” Yan Ruoxue looked excited.

She held her phone and pressed the shutter button repeatedly. She even asked Qin Yu to make all sorts of embarrassing poses.

Before the Ferris wheel even turned, Yan Ruoxue had already saved more than a dozen group photos on her phone.

When the Ferris wheel started to turn, Yan Ruoxue’s speed became even faster.

Yan Ruoxue didn’t miss any angle. She struck all kinds of weird poses, and they seemed no different from an ordinary couple.

This was also the first time Qin Yu truly experienced dating.

The Ferris wheel slowly spun, and soon, the Ferris wheel reached the highest point.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly came over and kissed Qin Yu’s face gently.

Qin Yu was stunned, and his entire face instantly flushed to the base of his neck.

However, the sense of ecstasy inside made Qin Yu’s heart beat rapidly.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue with emotion. Just as he was about to speak, Yan Ruoxue reached out a finger and blocked Qin Yu’s mouth.

“Legend has it that when the Ferris wheel turns to the highest position, kissing the person you love the most means you two can be together forever,” Yan Ruoxue said with some longing.

“There aren’t many opportunities to come to the amusement park. I don’t want to miss them,” Yan Ruoxue’s words seemed to have a hidden meaning.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue with his heart racing and whispered, “Miss... Miss Yan, I...”

“Do you still want to continue calling me Miss Yan?” Yan Ruoxue blinked her eyes and asked.

Yes, this address was too formal

Qin Yu took a deep breath, mustered up his courage, and pecked Yan Ruoxue on the face.

Then, he looked at Yan Ruoxue gently and said word by word, “Ruoxue, meeting you is the happiest thing in my life. I don’t want to leave you, and I will never leave you.”

At this moment, it was as if the world had stopped.

Their eyes met, and everything became a foil to the two of them.

Fortunately, this scene wasn’t seen by Yan Jiang and the others, or else they would have gone crazy.

This day was the most unforgettable day for Qin Yu, and also the happiest day.

The Ferris wheel finally stopped.

Both of their faces were a little flushed.

Qin Yu never thought that at the end of his youth, he could still experience love in its purest form.

Then, the two of them went to sit on the merry-go-round, the pirate ship, and so on. It wasn’t until the sky turned dark that the two of them left the amusement park.

“I had a really good time today,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Yan Ruoxue blinked and said, “Me too.”

Although she said this, there seemed to be a hint of sadness on Yan Ruoxue’s face.

This didn’t escape Qin Yu’s eyes. He asked somewhat suspiciously, “What’s wrong?”

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and smiled. “Nothing.”

She didn’t want to destroy the romantic vibe, so she didn’t tell Qin Yu that she would be returning to Jingdu tomorrow.

At night, their surroundings were terrifyingly quiet.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were in their own rooms, but they weren’t sleeping.

Yan Ruoxue was wearing a nightgown. She leaned against the window and looked into the distant sky.

A gentle breeze blew past her fair and smooth cheeks, and tousled her waterfall-like black hair.

Her large clear eyes were filled with a mixture of sadness and joy.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu was sitting in his room and continuing to refine the amulet.

He hadn’t slept for two whole days, but Qin Yu didn’t feel tired at all.

It wasn’t until early in the morning that the amulet was finally successfully refined.

There were traces of bright red in that jade pendant.

This was Qin Yu’s blood essence. It could save lives at critical moments.

“Phew, it’s finally over.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little tired.

He glanced at the time. It was only seven o’clock in the morning. Qin Yu thought for a moment and decided to sleep for an hour.

He set the alarm for eight o’clock and quickly fell asleep on his bed.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
