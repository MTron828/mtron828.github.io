Chapter 327: Yao Qing’s Classmate Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The manager shook his head and said, “I’m sorry. It was indeed our mistake.”

Qin Yu frowned and was about to pull Yao Qing away when the waiter behind him whispered, “We’re just leaving you with some dignity. Do you want us to say that a big shot has stolen your position?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Although the voice was very soft, it still reached Qin Yu’s ears.

His expression turned cold and he said icily, “What kind of big shot? Call him out for me to see.”

The manager’s expression changed slightly.

He hurriedly explained, “There’s no big shot. There’s no such thing. Don’t take it to heart.”

“Then take out the booking form and let me see it,” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

The manager was a little impatient.

He said with an unfriendly tone, “I’m giving you a way out. Why are you so ungrateful? Fine, someone stole your position. So what?”

“F * ck you!” Yao Qing was suddenly furious and reached out to grab the manager’s collar.

The manager sneered and said, “He is a big shot who came back from the provincial capital. He had his eyes on your seat. If you feel resentful, go find him yourself. Is it useful to bicker with me?”

“A big shot who came back from the provincial capital? How big of a big shot?” Qin Yu asked with a cold expression.

The manager pointed at the window with his chin and said, “He is the boss of Yiming Real Estate, which is a big company in the provincial capital. It’s just a seat. It’s the New Year. Don’t give yourself trouble.”

Qin Yu glanced at the table and saw that there was no one there.

“I really want to see this overbearing boss.” Qin Yu snorted.

Then, he brought Yao Qing to the third table and sat down.

“Manager, what... What should we do?” The waiter frowned.

The manager waved his hand and said, “We’ve delivered the message. The rest is up to them.”

The waiter whispered, “They really overestimate themselves. When he comes, let’s see what they will do.”

...

Qin Yu and Yao Qing sat in front of the table and waited quietly.

About ten minutes later, seven to eight people walked towards table three.

The leader was a middle-aged man in a suit and tie.

He was dressed in designer clothes from head-to-toe and a Vacheron Constantin watch on his wrist. This showed his extraordinary status.

This man walked to Qin Yu’s side quickly. Just as he was about to speak, his eyes fell on Yao Qing.

“Yao Qing?” The man sized up Yao Qing with a hint of surprise in his eyes.

When Yao Qing saw this man, he looked embarrassed.

“Qian Yiming? Why are you here?” Yao Qing asked with an embarrassed smile.

The man called Qian Yiming sneered. “Don’t you know? My wife is from Jiangcheng. But why are you here instead of obediently following your boss?”

Yao Qing looked a bit embarrassed, as if he didn’t know what to say.

“Do you know each other?” Qin Yu asked.

Before Yao Qing answered, Qian Yiming sneered and said, “Of course we know each other. We were classmates.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. From their conversation, Qin Yu could tell that Qian Yiming seemed to be hostile to Yao Qing.

“Mr. Qin, why don’t we go somewhere else?” Yao Qing pulled Qin Yu’s arm and said.

“Why? Since we are classmates, let’s sit together,” Qian Yiming said with a nonchalant smile.

Yao Qing didn’t say a word. He turned around to leave.

However, Qin Yu stretched out his hand to stop him and said indifferently, “This seat was originally ours. Why do we have to leave?”

Qian Yiming glanced at Qin Yu and sneered. “What’s your relationship with Yao Qing?”

“A friend,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Hehe, trash’s friend is indeed trash,” Qian Yiming sneered.

Yao Qing hurriedly stood up and said, “Qian Yiming, this is Mr. Qin. You’d better be polite.”

“Mr. Qin? Who is Mr. Qin? What business do you do? Are you a big shot?” Qian Yiming said with a sarcastic tone.

Yao Qing, not knowing how to introduce Qin Yu, opened his mouth.

“I’m not a big shot. I’m just an ordinary person.” At this moment, Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

Qian Yiming snorted coldly, as if he couldn’t be bothered with Qin Yu.

He waved his hand, then his family and friends came to the table and sat down.

Qin Yu pulled Yao Qing’s arm and said, “Why do you look so afraid of him?”

Yao Qing forced a smile and said, “I’m not afraid of him. I’m just too lazy to bicker with him.”

“Tsk tsk, you’re afraid of bickering?” Qin Yu said jokingly.

Yao Qing sighed and didn’t speak.

At this time, a woman stared at Yao Qing and asked, “Yiming, who is this person?”

Qian Yiming glanced at Yao Qing and said casually, “A classmate of mine.”

“Is he also in business?” The woman continued to ask.

Qian Yiming sneered. “Him? He’s just a security guard.”

The people at the table said one after another, “A security guard is qualified to sit here? What a jinx. Let him go quickly.”

Qian Yiming pretended to be magnanimous and said, “Gee, he’s my classmate after all. Let him sit here.”

The conversation between the two parties made Qin Yu a little unhappy.

He looked at Qian Yiming coldly and said, “I wonder what business Mr. Qian does?”

Qian Yiming said with some pride, “Just real estate. I can only earn tens of millions a year. It’s not worth mentioning.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and nodded, “Well, tens of millions is indeed not worth mentioning.”

Qian Yiming’s expression changed slightly, and he couldn’t help but feel a little angry.

He was just being modest, yet Qin Yu actually took it seriously?

“Yeah, I can’t compete with the security guards. How awesome is being a security guard?” Qian Yiming said with a sarcastic tone.

“By the way, how do you know Yao Qing? Are you a colleague? Are you also a security guard?” Qian Yiming turned his head to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “I told you, I’m just an ordinary person, a freelancer.”

“Oh, so you’re an unemployed vagrant?” Qian Yiming sneered.

“Why don’t you come to our company after the New Year? Our company just happens to be in need of security. I’ll give you three thousand a month. How about that?” Qian Yiming laughed evilly.

At this time, Yao Qing berated, “Qian Yiming, that’s enough! Mr. Qin isn’t someone you and I can compare to!”

“Bah! You really know how to brag.” Qian Yiming snorted coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t lower himself to Qian Yiming’s level. Qin Yu had seen a lot of nouveau riche like him.

Time passed minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, it was already ten o’clock in the evening.

At this time, the New Year’s Eve dinner had already been eaten. Everyone seemed to be somewhat quiet.

At this moment, someone suddenly came in with a generous gift.

He went straight to Qin Yu’s table and looked at Qian Yiming.

“Mr. Qian, happy New Year. This is a gift I prepared for you. You must accept it,” the man stood in front of Qian Yiming and said respectfully.

Qian Yiming glanced at Qin Yu with some pride, then waved his hand and said, “Gift? You are too polite.”

“It’s my duty, Mr. Qian. I still need you to take care of me after the New Year,” the man said with an embarrassed smile.

Qian Yiming waved his hand and said, “Alright, I got it. You can go now.”

After the man left, Qian Yiming looked at Qin Yu with some pride and said with a sarcastic tone, “Yao Qing, aren’t you a big shot? It’s the New Year, so why is there no one to greet you?”

“Maybe it’s not the time yet,” Qin Yu said casually.

He glanced at the watch on the wall and thought to himself, “Jiang Gu, Lei Hu, and the others will come to pay New Year greetings to me.”
