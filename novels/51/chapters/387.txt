Chapter 388: There Are Talented People Every Generation Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Han family had ties with the Martial Arts Association, so it wasn’t particularly difficult to squeeze Han Wei in.

But this was enough to show one thing.

That was, the Qin Yu that they had always looked down on was now beginning to make them worry and even feel fear.

...

In a deep mountain, there was no one here, but there was a bungalow.

“Master, here’s the tea you asked for.” A 14 to 15-year-old youth held a teacup and walked to an old man with white hair.

The old man took the tea and said, “How long... have we been here?”

“Master, it’s been 14 years,” the youth said.

“Fourteen years... time flies by,” the old man sighed.

The young man was silent for a long time, as if he had something to say.

“Say what you want to say.” The old man saw through the young man’s thoughts.

The young man hesitated for a while and said, “Master, recently, someone... has successfully stepped on the stairway to heaven.”

“Successfully stepped on the stairway to heaven?” The old man raised his eyebrows and said with a nonchalant smile, “The chosen one?”

“No... he was the same as you. He forced his way onto the stairway to heaven, but... he succeeded.” The young man’s voice became softer and softer, as if he was afraid of hurting the old man’s feelings.

“Clang!”

The teacup in the old man’s hand fell to the ground.

This old man was none other than the famous genius Jiang He.

He wasn’t really an old man. He was only forty-eight years old.

His hair was white all because he had forced his way up the stairway to heaven.

“There are talented people in every generation...” Jiang He said in a low voice after a while.

...

Qin Yu didn’t leave the Elders’ Residence for three whole days.

Almost every day, people would come to visit Qin Yu. In their eyes, Qin Yu was a miracle. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the blink of an eye, another month passed.

At this time, it was already early May. There were only four months left until September 9th.

On this day, Qin Yu, who was in closed-door cultivation, suddenly opened his eyes!

His internal qi was violently surging, as if it was going to expand at any moment!

“The peak of the Monastic Stage,” Qin Yu murmured softly.

Stepping into the Enlightenment Stage from the Monastic Stage was the most difficult step.

And now, Qin Yu could clearly feel that he had already reached the bottleneck stage.

Just by relying on closed-door cultivation, he probably wouldn’t be able to advance any further.

“The peak of the Monastic Stage should correspond to the peak of the Inner Strength Past Master realm,” Qin Yu thought inside.

But to Qin Yu, the peak of the Inner Strength Past Master realm was enough to deal with most of the Inner Strength Grandmasters! Even the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm!

“There are still four months left. I don’t know if I have the chance to step into the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm,” Qin Yu muttered softly.

As a chaotic body, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of anyone in the same realm!

Even if that someone was a son of an aristocratic family, and even if he was a genius of the era!

“Mr. Qin, you’ve come out of seclusion.” After seeing Qin Yu, Yao Qing ran up eagerly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s time for me to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“Leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” Yao Qing couldn’t help but feel stunned.

He hurriedly said, “If you leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion Now, won’t it be too dangerous? Many people want to kill you...”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion has protected me too well. If this continues, I’m afraid that I will become a good-for-nothing.”

Cultivation wasn’t something that could be accomplished just by going into seclusion. To be born in the secular world, one had to integrate into the secular world.

Moreover, Qin Yu still had important things to do.

Seeing that he couldn’t dissuade Qin Yu, Yao Qing asked, “Mr. Qin, when do you plan to leave?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “In three days.”

“Then I’ll go with you,” Yao Qing said hurriedly.

Qin Yu sized up Yao Qing and realized that Yao Qing had already stepped into the Inner Strength Past Master realm.

Although he was at the early stage of the Inner Strength Past Master realm, his cultivation method was the same as Qin Yu’s. Both of them used spiritual energy.

Therefore, he might be stronger than an ordinary Inner Strength Past Master.

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

Qin Yu had a plan in mind. Yao Qing might be able to help.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already stayed in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion for three months.

In these three months, everything seemed to have changed.

Qin Yu had gone from the early-stage of the Monastic Stage to the peak state in the blink of an eye!

His speed was beyond imagination!

His physical body had reached an indestructible state! Even if he didn’t use the Saintly Body Technique, Qin Yu’s physical body was enough to withstand a bullet!

In the evening, Qin Yu arrived at the Pavilion Master’s building.

The Pavilion Master personally brewed a cup of tea for Qin Yu.

“Peak Inner Strength Past Master realm? Not bad,” the Pavilion Master said.

Qin Yu lamented, “Yeah, now, if I meet a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster, even if I can’t kill him, I will have the ability to protect myself.”

Regarding this, the Pavilion Master didn’t say much.

She suddenly changed the topic, “Let me tell you some bad news. Han Wei has become Xia Hang’s disciple.”

“Xia Hang?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

This name seemed a little unfamiliar.

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly. “Yes, the vice president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qin Yu recalled the “Mr. Xia” that Yan Ruoxue had talked to at the banquet. It was probably Xia Hang.

“No worries.” Qin Yu smiled.

“No matter who he takes as his master, I will kill him with my own hands.”

Qin Yu’s tone was confident and calm, as if he didn’t care about Han Wei at all.

The Pavilion Master nodded and didn’t say anything else.

She had a lot of faith in Qin Yu to begin with, and Qin Yu’s performance made her even more convinced.

“Are you leaving in three days?” The Pavilion Master asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I plan to prepare some more in the next few days, just in case.”

“Okay.” The Pavilion Master stood up.

She turned around and returned to her room. A moment later, she walked out with a pill furnace in her hand.

This pill furnace was the pill furnace that the Pavilion Master had personally used back then! The divine dragon carved on it was very lifelike!

“I’ll give this pill furnace to you,” the Pavilion Master said nonchalantly.

This time, Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony.

He accepted the pill furnace, cupped his hands and said, “I will never forget the great kindness, Pavilion Master.”

The gratitude Qin Yu had for the Divine Alchemist Pavilion could no longer be described with words.

Qin Yu didn’t know how to repay it.

In the next few days, Qin Yu bid farewell to the many alchemists of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion one by one.

Other than that, he spent all his time in his room. No one knew what he was doing.

On the last night before he left, Qin Yu, Old Mister Yan, the Fifth Elder, and the others gathered together.

The Pavilion Master didn’t appear. The Pavilion Master, who had always been a loner, didn’t like to participate in such dinners.

“After I leave this time, I don’t know when we will be able to meet again.” At the dining table, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

The Fifth Elder also nodded and said, “That’s right. I hope you can succeed.”

“I’ll definitely succeed.” Qin Yu’s tone was extremely firm.

“Even if you can’t do anything to the two aristocratic families, you can at least take Ruoxue away.”

The atmosphere was rather sad that night, and everyone drank until they got drunk.

The next morning, Qin Yu made some simple preparations and prepared to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

All the apothecaries stood at the door and watched Qin Yu.

Other than the Pavilion Master, this was the first time someone in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had received such treatment.

In just three months, Qin Yu had become their idol.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, Taozi suddenly ran over while panting.

“Can... Can I go with you?” Taozi asked softly.

“Go with me?” Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile.

“I’m not going out to play. If you go with me, you might die at any time,” Qin Yu said.

Taozi hurriedly said, “I’m not afraid! Maybe I can help you!”

Qin Yu frowned. After thinking for a moment, he said, “Do you really want to go with me?”

“Yes!” Taozi nodded hard.

“Okay,” Qin Yu agreed.

Taozi was an extremely excellent pharmacist. She might really be able to help.

“Qin Yu, the people from the Yan family are still nearby,” The Fifth Elder reminded.

Qin Yu’s gaze turned cold. He sneered and said, “That would be the best. I can use them to test my current strength...”
