Chapter 1658: Chapter 1,658, my own phenomenon! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

That laughter rippled through the shattered Ying Ning Mountain. It was extremely ear-piercing and pierced into everyone’s ears!

Qin Yu’s sudden laughter caused everyone to feel astonished.

It was obvious that he had already lost, so why was he laughing at this moment?

“Could it be... that Qin Yu has gone mad?”Someone muttered in a low voice.

“Don’t spout nonsense! You Jinx It!”

“Sigh, although I’m unwilling to admit it, this matter may really have dealt a great blow to Qin Yu...”

Someone even shouted at Qin Yu, “Qin Yu, there’s no need to blame yourself. You’ve already done well!”

In the face of everyone’s discussion, Qin Yu still laughed maniacally!

His long hair fluttered in the wind and he looked unrestrained!

The elementalist frowned slightly before a mocking smile appeared on his face.

He looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Laughing? You’re about to die, yet you’re still laughing?”

Qin Yu completely ignored him. His laughter made people feel a little annoyed.

Finally, the elementalist could not hold it in any longer and shouted, “What are you laughing at!”

Qin Yu laughed maniacally and said, “I’m laughing at the fact that you’re the leader of the northern lands for nothing! So it turns out that you didn’t rely on your own abilities, but on summoning the remnants of the immortal slaying sect. hahahahaha!”

Upon hearing the words ‘immortal slaying sect’, the Elementalist’s expression became a little unnatural.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “You know quite a lot, but so what? This is my spell. As long as you can win, it’s enough. Do you think it’s useful to use this method to provoke me?”

“No.”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s laughter came to an abrupt end.

He looked coldly at the elementalist and said, “I only overestimated you, but I never said that I lost.”

Everyone held their breaths when they heard this!

Even the elementalist was slightly stunned!

Could it be that Qin Yu still had some sort of trump card or spell? !

However, the elementalist quickly sneered.

“Do you think it’s useful to put on an Act? If you want to live, you might as well go and pray to Saint Xiao. You might still be able to save him if he makes a move,”the elementalist said indifferently.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I’ve already said that I will definitely kill you today!”

After he finished speaking, the internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body began to boil!

The internal Qi that was clearly dispirited earlier erupted once again!

This internal Qi rapidly spread out in all directions with Qin Yu as the center. In just a short while, a strange phenomenon also appeared on his back!

“What you have, I have too!”Qin Yu roared angrily. Golden Light surged all over his body as a huge figure appeared behind him!

The elementalist stared at Qin Yu in astonishment. He was very curious about what kind of character Qin Yu was going to summon.

Could it be that he was also a top-tier expert left behind by Gu?

Everyone stared at the radiance behind Qin Yu. Their hearts were filled with curiosity.

The radiance behind Qin Yu slowly condensed into form, from his body to his face!

And that figure was none other than Qin Yu himself!

The figure he conjured was himself, and this vision was also him!

Everyone was stunned when they saw the huge vision that was emitting a golden light!

The elementalist was stunned for half a second before he laughed maniacally, “Hahahahahaha! Qin Yu, are you an idiot? The figure he conjured is yourself? What a joke, hahahaha!”

Just as the elementalist had said, anyone’s vision was a legend. There were divine beasts and wondrous scenes. These were all transformed from the Great Dao and possessed boundless power!

However, it was simply unheard of for someone like Qin Yu to conjure his own vision! What kind of power was there to speak of!

“Boom!”

At this moment, an explosion sounded from Qin Yu’s body!

One could see that his physical body seemed to have fused with the gigantic vision! It looked extremely mysterious!

“Eh?”

Xiao Sheng, who was watching the battle from afar, couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

“The ultimate combination of the physical body and Dao Technique?”Xiao Sheng murmured in a low voice, and a strange light flashed in his eyes.

Someone beside him asked, “Lord sect master, what does this mean?”

Xiao Sheng glanced at him and said indifferently, “This vision is formed by Qin Yu’s invincible belief. However, all his advantages are concentrated on the physical body, so the effect of the vision is not obvious.”

“However, if the physical body and this vision can be perfectly integrated, the improvement that will be brought is immeasurable.”

After hearing Xiao Sheng’s words, the deputy sect master said excitedly, “Sect master, is what you said true?”

Xiao Sheng said slowly, “I’ve only heard about it, but I’ve never seen it. As for its effect, I can’t guarantee it.”

Looking at the huge anomaly, the elementalist still burst into laughter.

He did not put Qin Yu in his eyes at all!

In the Elementalist’s eyes, this was just an enlarged Qin Yu. What was the use of it?

As for the existence of his four symbols technique, he was an important figure in the immortal slaying sect. How Could Qin Yu be compared to him?

“Putting up a stubborn resistance, you don’t know whether you’re Dead or alive.”The elementalist sneered.

“Just based on this...”

However, before he could finish his sentence, the smile on his face froze.

Qin Yu’s huge vision appeared in front of him almost instantly. His golden fist that was like a small mountain suddenly smashed towards the mysterious person in the four symbols technique!

This punch sent the elementalist and the huge scene behind him flying!

Silence!

The scene was silent. No one dared to breathe!

No one seemed to believe that the scene in front of them was real!

In the dark, a pair of eyes was staring at Qin Yu.

When he saw this scene, a smile finally appeared on his face.

A cloud of dust rose, obscuring his vision.

Qin Yu stood there like a god of war, coldly looking in the direction of the elementalists.

“Who said you can’t rely on yourself?”Qin Yu’s tone was filled with arrogance and arrogance, but at this moment, it reignited the confidence of the southern region!

Even Xiao Sheng’s face revealed a trace of a smile!

“Ah! ! !”

Soon, the elementalist exploded from the dust!

Just this punch had almost shattered his physical body, and the mysterious person hanging above his head had become a little dimmer!

“F * ck... F * ck!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Inside the spatial magic artifact, Heavenly Blood Rainbow blurted out!

As a member of the immortal slaying sect, he naturally knew what the character in the Elementalist’s scene meant!

“Qin Yu, you’re courting death!”

The elementalist was thoroughly enraged. His mouth let out a furious roar, and an endless amount of internal QI surged towards the mysterious figure!

The mysterious figure’s body once again materialized, and that huge palm covered Qin Yu!

However, Qin Yu showed no fear. His fighting spirit was overflowing, and his golden fist swept through everything, regardless of any spells or characters!

The elementalist was sent flying for the second time, and that palm that came crashing down was shattered by Qin Yu’s punch!

“How is this possible!”The elementalist seemed to be in disbelief at the scene before him!

“You are just a junior, yet you can actually fight against an important figure of the immortal slaying sect...”
