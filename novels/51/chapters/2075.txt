2076 Indiscriminate Revenge

In the depths of Dragon Burial Cave, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground, his body emitting a strange internal qi.

His eyes were tightly closed, and there was no sign of pain on his face.

Around him, the coldness of his body and the fiery internal qi of his divine sense intertwined, forming a strange cyclone.

It was even more shocking that the spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body did not seem to be frozen. Instead, under the internal qi of ice and fire, it gradually condensed into an even more powerful force.

Xiao Sheng was stunned when seeing the scene before his eyes.

!!

He did not expect Qin Yu to be able to maintain such a constant state of cultivation in such an environment.

But soon, Xiao Sheng’s expression resumed the calmness and was as cold as a glacier.

Xiao Sheng turned around and walked out of Dragon Burial Cave. He knew that Qin Yu was trying his best to adapt to the environment of the Dragon Burial Cave.

In the blink of an eye, several days went by.

Fewer people were around the Chaos Grave now, and the Si family was getting even more worried.

After so many days, Si Shiyue still did not make any moves, which inevitably made people feel suspicious.

“Did Si Shiyue really die inside?” Holy Son Jiang rubbed his chin.

The Si family attached great importance to Si Shiyue’s chaotic body. If anything happened to him, it would cause severe damage to the Si family.

“You guys wait here. I’ll be right back,” Si Qianjing said coldly.

The surrounding cultivators walked over and advised, “Elder, too many people of the Si family have died. You can’t let anything happen to you!”

“Cut the crap,” Si Qianjing snapped coldly. “I have my own way of escaping.”

Si Qianjing would probably die, too, if Si Shiyue died.

Therefore, Si Qianjing adjusted the internal qi in his body and planned to burn his blood essence, adjusting his internal qi to its peak.

Just then, a figure appeared at the entrance.

“Someone is coming out!” somebody with sharp eyes shouted.

Everyone instantly looked in the direction of the entrance to the Chaos Grave.

“Still alive?” Holy Son Jiang was a little surprised. He rubbed his chin and muttered, “Judging from Si Shiyue’s expression, he doesn’t look like he has obtained any treasure…”

The Si family members moved forward and surrounded the Chaos Grave.

Soon, Si Shiyue left the Chaos Grave. He threw the supreme bone to Holy Son Jiang and fell into silence.

“How is it? Did you encounter any fortuitous opportunity in the Chaos Grave?” Si Qianjing asked anxiously.

Si Shiyue gritted his teeth and said coldly, “No, nothing at all.”

“What? How could it be?” Everyone was instantly shocked upon hearing this.

Si Shiyue was in the Chaos Grave for so long, but he did not obtain anything!

“What exactly has happened?” Si Qianjing asked impatiently.

Si Shiyue gritted his teeth and said, “The coffin in the Chaos Grave has been opened, and there’s nothing inside. Nothing! Someone must have gotten there first!”

Si Shiyue then looked at Holy Son Jiang.

Holy Son Jiang waved his hand repeatedly and said, “Why are you looking at me? I don’t have that ability. If I had taken the treasures, I would have left this place long ago. Why would I wait here?”

Si Shiyue suppressed his anger and said, “It must be Qin Yu who has taken away the hidden treasure of Wu Ji.”

“Qin Yu?” Si Qianjing’s face turned cold at the mention of this name.

“Only a few of us entered the Chaos Grave. Who else could it be other than Qin Yu?” Si Shiyue said coldly.

Si Qianjing walked over then said in a low voice, “There’s no need to worry if it were him. I’ll look for him now and force him to hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture.”

Si Qianjing then left the place and headed straight for Donghuang.

Si Shiyue glanced at Holy Son Jiang coldly, then turned around and left without saying anything.

In the following few days, the Si family announced the matter of the Chaos Grave to the world and told everyone that Qin Yu had taken away the treasures in the Chaos Grave.

As soon as this news spread, countless people naturally began looking for Qin Yu, hoping to obtain the hidden treasure from him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just as the news of the Chaos Grave spread, Qin Yu was unaware that he had become the target of public criticism.

He was still cultivating in the depths of Dragon Burial Cave, dancing with the ice and fire to strengthen his strength gradually.

Soon, countless people began to rush to Donghuang to look for Qin Yu. Soon, Donghuang became incredibly lively, and the internal qi became even more abundant.

In addition, the Si family’s revenge had also been in full swing. Three True Saints were searching for Xiao Hai’s location.

Although Xiao Hai was powerful, he was powerless against a True Saint. He could only try to escape with all his might.

On the other end, Jue Wu’s situation was not any better. Although she was the direct disciple of Dean Lei, the Si family had long lost killed to the point of becoming bloodthirsty. Countless sects had been implicated because of this. In just a short month, the Si family had pulled out 18 sects in one go!

These 18 sects had strong foundations but could not escape the Si family’s forceful suppression even though they had used all their trump cards.

At the Si family, Si Shiyu sat in front of Si Shiyue, his expression cold and displeased.

“Are you really going to attack Jue Wu?” Si Shiyu asked coldly.

“Otherwise?” Si Shiyue was not hesitant at all.

Si Shiyu took a deep breath and said, “Do you really want to push Dean Lei to his limits? He was the only successor of the Immortal Emperor Lei! The blood of the Immortal Emperor Lei was flowing in his body!”

“So what?” Si Shiyue smashed the table in front of him.

“Don’t tell me the Si family doesn’t have the Immortal Emperor’s bloodline!” he shouted. “Why would my Si family’s True Saint be afraid of Dean Lei?

“Thunder Courtyard has stayed outside the nine great aristocratic families for many years. Who has seen him fight? I want to see what kind of ability this Dean Lei has!

“If one True Saint can’t kill him, then five. If five can’t kill him, then ten! Who has my Si family ever been afraid of?

“Besides, Dean Lei might not even be a True Saint! He probably might not fall out with our Si family for Jue Wu!

“The Si family is definitely going to kill them. No one can stop me.”

Si Shiyu was speechless hearing Si Shiyue’s words.

He took a deep breath and stood up. “In that case, you’re on your own. I’m going on retreat.”

Si Shiyu left after saying that.

After Si Shiyu left, Si Shiyue sat there and stared coldly at the door.

He showed no mercy to Jue Wu and hated Qin Yu with intense hatred. He had made up his mind to get rid of both of them to avenge the people the Si family had lost.

A few days later, there was news about Xiao Hai being pursued by three True Saints. His life and death remained unknown. Jue Wu was severely injured by a True Saint and fell off a cliff. There was no news at all.
