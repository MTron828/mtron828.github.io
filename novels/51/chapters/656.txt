Chapter 657: Why Are You Helping Me? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The way Ye Qing presented himself was extremely imposing. Under the explosion of such internal qi, Qin Yu couldn’t bear it anymore. He spat out a mouthful of blood and half-knelt on the ground.

Looking at Qin Yu’s expression, Ye Qing couldn’t help but frown.

He said coldly, “Qin Yu, do you know that we are all trying to capture you right now?!”

“You caused a scene at the auction and injured so many people. How dare you show yourself now?!”

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said, “I came to find you because of something important.”

“Something important?” Ye Qing narrowed his eyes and asked coldly, “What is it?”

“I want to cooperate with you.” Qin Yu leaned against the wall and slowly stood up.

Hearing this, Ye Qing couldn’t help but laugh out loud, “Qin Yu, who do you think you are to cooperate with me? Do I need to cooperate with you?!”

“You’ve hurt so many people and have already broken the law. I’ll take you back now!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and continued, “Commander Ye, even if you want to arrest me, it’s not at this moment. Why don’t you listen to what I can bring to you...”

Ye Qing’s eyes narrowed, as though he felt that what Qin Yu said made sense.

He said coldly, “Alright, I’ll give you three minutes.”

Qin Yu looked at Ye Qing and said: “You should know that I am a pharmacist and I possess many Divine Rank pill formulas.”

“So?” Ye Qing cast a glance at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu continued, “I can provide pills for the military district of Jingdu, or even the entire Pyro.”

“This kind of pill can greatly increase the strength of a warrior!”

“Other than that, I also possess a breathing exercise technique. This technique can allow everyone to feel the spiritual energy and allow all common warriors to become martial warriors!”

This breathing exercise technique was left behind by Qin Yu’s father. Qin Yu had only taught it to Yao Qing.

But now, Qin Yu had no other way. If he wanted to negotiate with Ye Qing, he had to spend a lot of resources.

Ye Qing narrowed his eyes. He sized up Qin Yu and said coldly, “What do you want?”

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said, “I want you to save someone.”

“Save Yan Ruoxue?” Ye Qing asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, save me.”

This immediately made Ye Qing very confused.

“Save you? Aren’t you standing right here?” Ye Qing frowned and said.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I will soon be captured by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. If I am captured, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely kill me.”

“I hope that at that time, Commander Ye can represent the military district of Jingdu and go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to request for me.”

Ye Qing couldn’t help but coldly say, “If you have the time, why don’t you run away?”

“I don’t want to run, what I want is to be safe!” Qin Yu replied coldly.

“I can escape for a day, but can I escape for a lifetime? Do you want me to run abroad and never come back?”

“Moreover, Yan Ruoxue is in their hands. They will definitely use Yan Ruoxue to force me to show myself.”

Ye Qing seemed to understand what Qin Yu meant. He narrowed his eyes slightly and said, “Qin Yu, you dare to come and negotiate with me? Aren’t you too confident?”

“Why do I have to go through so much trouble? I can directly capture you and force you to hand over the pill formula and the breathing exercise technique!”

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and sneered, “Commander Ye, you can try and see if I will open my mouth...”

“Are you provoking me?” Ye Qing’s face turned cold, and the aura on his body suddenly exploded.

Despite facing intense pressure from Ye Qing, Qin Yu was not afraid at all.

He looked straight at Ye Qing, his gaze was neither servile nor overbearing.

“Commander Ye, he has suffered such serious injuries. Don’t tease him anymore.”

At this moment, a head suddenly popped in from the second floor.

With a glance, he saw the Pavilion Master standing in front of the window.

Qin Yu was stunned and said in surprise, “Lord Pavilion Master? Why are you here?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Pavilion Master shook her head and didn’t explain.

Ye Qing, who was downstairs, also withdrew his imposing aura. He waved his hand and said with a smile, “Naturally, she came here to look for me because of you.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to speak when Ye Qing waved his hand and said, “Let’s go. Let’s go upstairs first.”

Qin Yu followed Ye Qing upstairs in a daze.

In the tea room.

Qin Yu sat in front of the two of them, his face filled with doubt.

“I didn’t expect that you could survive under the Martial Saint Weapon.” The pavilion master drank a mouthful of tea and said indifferently.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I was just lucky.”

“Lord Pavilion Master, why are you here?” Qin Yu asked.

Ye Qing, who was at the side, explained, “The two of you really have the same idea. Ji Yuhong also wants me to go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to request for her.”

“But little did I expect you to be able to escape.” The Pavilion Master smiled and said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel warm in his heart.

“Lord Pavilion Master, thank you.” Qin Yu wanted to stand up and bow to her, but his injuries were too serious, and it was difficult for him to even stand up.

“Sit there obediently.” The Pavilion Master waved her hand, and a gentle force pressed on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu’s eyes expressed his gratitude, and then he looked at Ye Qing and said, “Commander Ye, no matter what, please promise me.”

Ye Qing said in a deep voice, “To be honest if it weren’t for Ji Yuhong, I wouldn’t have made any deal with you.”

The Pavilion Master said with a smile, “Qin Yu can be considered to have done meritorious service for the Military District.”

Ye Qing nodded and said, “That’s right, Qin Yu. Even if you don’t come to find me, I will go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to ask for you.”

Qin Yu was stunned, and the confusion in his eyes intensified.

Ye Qing said faintly, “After all, you are a member of the Chuzhou region’s military district. You belong to the Military District. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has no authority to deal with you.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

He nodded slightly and said, “Thank you, Commander Ye.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He asked tentatively, “Commander Ye, can you help to save Ruoxue as well?”

“Qin Yu.” Hearing this, the Pavilion Master couldn’t help but lightly called his name.

Ye Qing took a sip of tea and said calmly, “Qin Yu, as I said before, don’t think too highly of yourself.”

“The first reason why I helped you is that you can indeed bring benefits to the military district.”

“The second reason is that you are a member of the military district. All of this is under the premise of complying with the rules.”

“As for the matter of the Yan family, I have no right to interfere, and I won’t interfere.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I’m sorry. I was being rather rude.”

The Pavilion Master smiled and tried to smooth things over, “Qin Yu is still young. Don’t argue with him.”

Ye Qing nodded and said, “It’s getting late. It’s time for me to rest.”

After saying this, Ye Qing turned around and walked out.

“You can recuperate here for the next few days,” said the Pavilion Master.

Then, the Pavilion Master flipped her palm and took out the medicinal cauldron with the Phoenix carved on it, as well as many herbs.

“I will try my best to help you recuperate these few days,” said the Pavilion Master.

Qin Yu nodded. Then, he raised his head to look at the pavilion master and said in a low voice, “Lord Pavilion Master, I have always had a doubt in my heart. That is... Why are you helping me?”
