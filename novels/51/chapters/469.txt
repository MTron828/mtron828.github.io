Chapter 470: Hong Yi Sect Entering the Border! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The sudden change gave the group of Inner Strength Grandmasters who were in charge of guarding the gate a fright.

“What... What are you doing?!” Someone exclaimed.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I’m not doing anything. I’m just going to kill all of you.”

Before he finished his words, Qin Yu approached them.

He raised his hand and used the Heaven Swallowing Technique. Several Inner Strength Grandmasters turned into dried corpses in just a moment.

Unfortunately, the Inner Strength Grandmasters’ improvement to Qin Yu was no longer obvious. Its effect was almost zero.

“Perhaps peak Inner Strength Grandmasters could still have some effect.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

“If only I could kill Martial Marquises.” Qin Yu thought inside.

The Martial Marquis realm was the equivalent of the Golden Core Stage in the cultivation world.

Once he stepped into the Golden Core Stage, the Golden Core would be born in his body.

At that time, as long as he swallowed Martial Marquis’s Golden Core, the effects would be unimaginable.

Of course, those were still too far away for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu pushed open the door of the Water Rhyme Tower and walked upstairs in large strides.

On the fifth floor, Wu Qian was sitting cross-legged while absorbing the spiritual energy from the Water Rhyme Tower.

His realm was slowly rising. Although the Water Rhyme Tower had the effect of the Enlightenment Tea, it also had a corresponding connection with the talent of a martial artist.

Therefore, Wu Qian’s speed wasn’t as fast as he had imagined.

Just as he was immersed in it, a big hand reached over, grabbed his collar, and threw him out.

Wu Qian suddenly opened his eyes. He stared at Qin Yu and said in a cold voice, “Who are you? Are you courting death?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Get lost quickly. Don’t come here again in the future.”

Wu Qian’s expression turned cold, then he snorted and said, “Are you talking to me? Do you know who I am? I am a member of the Saint Confucian Sect!”

“Oh, right, you are a member of the Saint Confucian Sect.” Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

Wu Qian thought Qin Yu was scared by the name of the Saint Confucian Sect, so he snorted lightly and said, “Now you feel afraid? Get lost quickly, or don’t blame me for being rude!”

“No, no, no, you misunderstood.” Qin Yu grinned.

“I originally wanted to let you live, but since you are a member of the Saint Confucian Sect, I can’t let you leave here alive.” Qin Yu sneered.

Wu Qian’s expression changed, and he exclaimed, “What do you mean?!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If you report the news to the Saint Confucian Sect, I’m afraid I’ll have even less time.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu walked toward Wu Qian step by step, and the murderous internal qi on his body also surged.

Sensing Qin Yu’s powerful internal qi, Wu Qian said with some fear, “Who... who exactly are you?!”

Qin Yu didn’t reply, but used his golden fist to punch him!

Wu Qian’s expression changed greatly. He had nowhere to hide, so he could only confront it.

The two fists collided, and Wu Qian’s body was sent flying. His fists were broken!

“Golden light... you... you are Qin Yu!” Wu Qian said in terror.

“You guessed right, but unfortunately, there is no reward.” Qin Yu grinned and said.

Wu Qian knew that the situation wasn’t good. He turned around and wanted to run, but how could Qin Yu give him the chance?

A golden light flashed by, and a powerful golden palm landed on Wu Qian’s body.

This palm shattered half of Wu Qian’s body.

His bones were broken, and he couldn’t even stand up.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me!” Wu Qian shouted in terror.

Qin Yu had already been tired of hearing such begging.

He didn’t pay any attention to Wu Qian, and raised his hand to use the Heaven Swallowing Technique.

After dealing with Wu Qian, Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time.

He took out Wu Qian’s phone and flipped through the call records.

The first one was Elder Qu of the Saint Confucian Sect.

“It seems that he has already informed the Elders of the Saint Confucian Sect.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

It would take six hours at most to rush from the Saint Confucian Sect to Dongchuan.

“I must find out the secret of the Water Rhyme Tower within these six hours.” Qin Yu threw his phone to the side.

He released his divine sense and began to search the Water Rhyme Tower.

Time passed by minute by minute. Qin Yu walked up and down the five levels, but found nothing.

For two whole hours, Qin Yu found nothing.

The entire Water Rhyme Tower was empty, but no matter which level he walked on, he could feel his realm slowly rising.

The effect wasn’t much different. The only difference was that the spiritual energy on the fifth floor was denser.

“Strange.” Qin Yu frowned.

“Could it really be the effect of this tower?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“I can’t just take this entire tower away, right?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu leaped and flew out of the Water Rhyme Tower.

Looking at this huge tower that reached into the clouds, Qin Yu was troubled for a moment.

Time passed by minute by second, and in the blink of an eye, four hours had passed.

“I’m afraid I don’t have much time left.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little anxious.

For four hours, he didn’t discover anything at all.

“There’s no other way.” Qin Yu wanted to give up at one point.

Sitting in the Water Rhyme Tower, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly, as if he was thinking about something.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly opened!

“Since I can’t take away the Water Rhyme Tower, I should think of a way to keep the Water Rhyme Tower!” Qin Yu said coldly.

He had no other way, so he could only settle for the second best.

And if he wanted to keep the Water Rhyme Tower, there was only one way, and that was to use the formation!

Qin Yu’s inheritance had countless formations, and among them, there were countless mountain protection formations!

If he could set up a Divine Rank killing formation, then there would be no worries!

Even if he established a sect in Dongchuan in the future, he could even protect the sect’s safety!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu quickly found a large formation.

The name of the formation was the Nine Netherworld Killing Formation. This formation could draw upon the energy of the earth to defend against external enemies.

It was rumored that during the war years, there was once a person with profound spells who set up this formation and relied on this formation to defend against hundreds of thousands of soldiers!

“This is it.” Qin Yu thought inside.

However, the arrangement of the Nine Netherworld Killing Formation wasn’t simple. Even if Qin Yu knew the method, it would take at least three days.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt an internal qi approaching from not far away.

One, two, three... a total of six people!

“Huh? There’s only one half-step Martial Marquis?” Qin Yu keenly sensed the internal qi of the other party!

“If there’s only one half-step Martial Marquis, I have nothing to be afraid of.” Qin Yu grinned coldly.

After that, Qin Yu leaped out of the Water Rhyme Tower.

He stood at the entrance of the Water Rhyme Tower and quietly waited for the arrival of the Saint Confucian Sect.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was actually Uncle Wu.

“Why did Uncle Wu suddenly call me?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He picked up the phone and picked up the call.

Then, he heard Uncle Wu say from the other end, “Qin Yu, I just received confirmation that the people from Hong Yi Sect have entered the country.”
