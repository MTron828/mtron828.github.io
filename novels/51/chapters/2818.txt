Chapter 2819: Three-Phase Power

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Thunder Emperor!”

Fatty Situ’s hair instantly turned silver-white.

A huge emperor’s shadow suddenly formed in front of Yi Xing, and lightning erupted in the sky.

This power was not weaker than the power of a true peak power level 12.

The entire ground was flowing with lightning liquid. The entire area covered by the peak power had almost become a silver-white world.

The thunder emperor’s shadow struck Yi Xing’s body.

Pa!

Amidst the buzzing of thunder that filled the sky, only the crisp sound of two palms colliding could be heard.

“All living beings! Sanskrit form!”

In the sea of lightning, countless whispers came from all over the world.

It was the angry language of Buddhism, the roar of extreme anger.

Jealousy whispers, annoyance trifles.

These sound waves turned into streams of energy that seemed to be corporeal. In the end, they gathered into an indistinct Sanskrit statue.

As it opened its mouth, the Thunder Emperor condensed by Fatty Situ instantly turned into lightning that filled the sky.

His entire body was thrown backward. If it wasn’t for the fact that the energy of the talisman hadn’t been completely dispersed, he would have been smashed into a pulp.

“Ha!”

Yi Xing turned around and stared at Qin Yu quietly.

“You guys are unlucky. I just happened to want to kill someone today.”

Before he finished speaking, the air suddenly froze.

The arm of the Sanskrit statue had already shrunk slightly as if it had pulled open a heavy bow. Even the air could feel the terrifying power condensed by the Sanskrit form.

Qin Yu raised his head slightly, and the power of reincarnation began to surge.

At this moment, Yi Xing suddenly retreated.

As his hands retreated again, his palms struck again.

“The Thousand-Spoke Wheel Form under the feet!”

In the Thousand-Spoke Wheel Form under the feet, there were a thousand stripes on the soles of the feet, some like the sun and moon, some like mountains, some like water, and some like lotus flowers.

“The Deer King’s Auspicious Form!”

With a rumble, another form was created.

In an instant, the three great forms had already finished accumulating their strength.

The three great forms formed a seal with one hand and raised their other hand.

The entire space was instantly filled with violent winds.

The surrounding people immediately pushed away. The appearance of the three great forms posed a great threat to them.

Boom! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Just as the two of them were about to attack with all their might, a pure white power, as white as the moon, suddenly bombarded down.

This power was as vast as a river, instantly suppressing the two of them.

It was an ocean of righteous qi. Qin Yu had never seen such a mighty righteous qi before.

The aura of this peak power was not strong, which meant that its level was not high.

However, it relied on its magnitude to completely disintegrate the two of them in an instant.

A young man suddenly closed the book in his hand. The attack just now was launched by him.

“Humph!”

Yi Xing’s expression was ugly as he turned around and left.

Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief.

If they had faced off against that guy just now, he would have risked being discovered by the Investiture of God’s version of the commandments.

In a real life-or-death battle with that bald monk, considering the strength he displayed, he would be discovered.

“This young man’s intervention has done us a big favor.”

“So, what’s the situation now? Can we still go together?”

Fatty Situ looked puzzled as he saw everyone suddenly scattering.

“Since Jiang Shengling has agreed, what else is there to discuss? Let’s just go together. But your strength here is above average. By the way, I’m Leng Yuanxun, the deputy captain of this team.”

The buzzcut young man from earlier said with a bitter smile.

He glanced at Qin Yu subconsciously. Yi Xing was definitely among the top in their group.

His one-phase power was almost unstoppable by anyone. Just now, Qin Yu indeed continuously unleashed the three-phase power, which could have already killed half of the people here.

“Thank you, Brother Xun. It’s our first meeting. Here are a few talismans as a greeting gift. We’ll rely on your guidance along the way.”

Fatty Situ handed over a few talismans through his sleeve.

Even a bankrupt landlord, his wealth was not something ordinary people could compare to.

“Let it go, two young brothers. Accepting your things is considered acknowledging your kindness. If there’s any crisis, I’ll lend a hand, but rashly making a move in this journey could lead to self-destruction, so I dare not take on this favor.”

Leng Yuanxun shook his head and swiftly avoided Fatty Situ’s hand.

“Your serial numbers are 79 and 80. Let me make this clear. Once you join our team, you must follow the captain’s orders. Even if you face a cliff, you must jump down when you hear your number. Disobeying orders in battle will result in immediate execution. This is the rule of our team. Also, all treasures obtained during the voyage will be distributed by the captain. If you have any objections, you can leave now.”

Leng Yuanxun paused for a moment.

“However, once we set off, your lives will no longer be your own. Please think carefully before making your decision.”

After saying this, Leng Yuanxun left.

“Boss Qin Yu, something seems off.”

Fatty Situ leaned closer, scratching his head.

“I agree. It’s strange that everyone here finds such tyrannical conditions reasonable. It’s likely because this person’s strength has intimidated everyone. At least, that bald monk didn’t dare to make a move. And secondly, we can’t continue without them on this route.”

Qin Yu pondered silently.

“Fatty Situ, do you know anything about this team beforehand? A team this powerful should have some relevant information available, right?”

Qin Yu asked with a frown.

Though he had been to Lingxu City before, he hadn’t come across such a group of people in the trading market.

Or perhaps he just missed them when he was there.

“I vaguely remember something about them, but it’s not my area of responsibility. I hardly paid any attention.”

Fatty Situ looked a bit embarrassed.

“Well, it doesn’t matter. We’re just using their Dharma Treasures for travel anyway. And with so many people along the way, it’ll be much easier. We’ll just split up when we get there.”

Qin Yu wasn’t sure if joining this team was a good or bad thing.

After making the necessary preparations, the group of nearly eighty people finally prepared to depart.

An extremely dilapidated ancient ship suddenly appeared before them.

The flags on the ship were already corroded, and the wooden planks were rotten in many places.

From several huge holes, one could even catch a glimpse of the dilapidated scene inside the cabin.

“I vaguely remember this ship. It seems to be a warship used in the Divine Realm. It drifted down from a wormhole. The Situ family spent a lot of effort trying to seize it but failed in the end. I didn’t expect it to appear here.”
