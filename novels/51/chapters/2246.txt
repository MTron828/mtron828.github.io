2247 The Land of Karma

Previously, the demonic egg had been in a state of concealment after obtaining it. It was in vain, even though she tried to inject spiritual power into it.

“Is this demonic egg going to hatch?”

She said in shock.

Several people stared at the demonic egg without blinking, wondering what kind of creature it would hatch.

Qin Yu was completely oblivious to what was happening in the outside world. Under the circulation of the Soul Torment Mind Technique, half of his divine sense had broken.

This time round, Qin Yu was in a coma for half a month before slowly waking up.

He saw Jue Wu staring at his head when he opened his eyes. Her eyes were red, and she seemed to have cried.

“You’re finally awake. I was so worried!”

Jue Wu fiercely punched Qin Yu’s shoulder, causing him to grimace in pain.

“It hurts!”

“It’ll be good if you die of pain!”

Jue Wu shouted fiercely.

“Why did you come here?”

Qin Yu thought for a while, looking bewildered, before asking her.

“Thunder Courtyard has a teleportation formation that can teleport me to the Black Platform Continent. I begged the old man for a long time before he agreed to send me here!”

Jue Wu said smugly.

“Jue Wu, you should know that you might not be able to go back for the rest of your life.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“Who cares! Let me be here first, and I don’t have to worry about you. Is there any meat here? I’m starving.”

Jue Wu said in a carefree manner as if she was not worried about this matter at all.

“Of course. There are many demonic beasts here that are extremely delicious. I’ll cook for you.”

Very soon, an alluring fragrance spread out.

Jue Wu quickly snatched one. The man with the mustache and Wang Feng also started eating at the side. A few of them almost fought over the food.

“Qin Yu, you used the netherworld cultivation method again. Does it affect you?”

Elder Guai saw the battle in the Sumeru Realm just now and asked worriedly.

“I’m not sure about the current situation. Xi Menn has comprehended the rules of the sword intent. That sword intent was too powerful. I couldn’t resist the slash If I didn’t use the Soul Torment Mind Technique.”

Qin Yu shook his head.

For the first time, his Soul Torment Mind Technique activated on its own, which meant the other black Qin Yu had its own consciousness.

Was the disappearance of his personality at the end the aftereffect of the Soul Torment Mind Technique? That was why so few people in this world cultivated the netherworld cultivation method.

Qin Yu sighed and did not continue to dwell on it. He would probably have died by now if it were not for the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

He glanced at the black Qin Yu in his sea of consciousness. At this moment, the black figurine’s eyes were closed, and its internal qi was extremely languid.

“My friend Qin Yu, I would like to stay here for some time if possible.”

Wang Feng said, feeling somewhat embarrassed.

When he woke up, he found the man with the mustache with a very creepy appearance holding onto him. Later, he discovered that this person had astonishing skills in formations. Because of this, he wanted to communicate and exchange ideas with him for a while in this place.

“No problem. Whatever belongs to him also belongs to me. You can stay as long as you want.”

The man with the mustache shamelessly agreed on behalf of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was speechless. He frowned and asked Wang Feng, “Wang Feng, why did they bring you to the seventh level of purgatory?”

“Hmm?”

Speaking of the seventh level of purgatory, the man with the mustache’s expression was somewhat unnatural.

“There’s a very strange space on the seventh level, but many ancient formations are intersecting within it. They have wanted me to open the entrance.”

Wang Feng said with a bitter smile.

“Could it be that there’s another Mystic Realm?”

Qin Yu frowned.

Wang Feng thought about it for a while before he spoke of that feeling.

“Moreover, the karmic repercussions were extremely severe. The people from the Blood Sect tortured me to the extent I couldn’t bear it any longer. I initially wanted to use the nine trigrams of destiny to deduce it, but unexpectedly, as soon as I touched that karmic aspect, I suffered a serious injury.”

Wang Feng still had a lingering fear.

“A Mystic Realm contaminate with karma and the internal qi of the netherworld. Could it be that this Mystic Realm is related to the netherworld?”

Qin Yu was a little puzzled. Logically speaking, many mighty realm cultivators would have comprehended it in advance if a Mystic Realm opened.

However, he did not sense the presence of any powerful cultivators on the seventh level.

“So, did you manage to deduce the entrance?”

Qin Yu asked again.

“It’s very difficult. However, this ancient formation is incomplete. As time passes, more and more flaws will reveal. At that time, we might be able to deduce the entrance,” Wang Feng said with a bitter smile.

“Qin Yu, if you believe me, you’d better not go to this place.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The man with the mustache wanted to say something but hesitated a few times. In the end, he could not help but speak out.

“Quickly tell me. Do you know anything about this?”

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up. The man with the mustache seemed to have some information about it.

“I really can’t tell you anything about this. What I can tell you is that it might reduce my lifespan by decades if I were to tell you. Therefore, I can’t bring this topic up with you anymore.”

The man with the mustache shook his head, his expression very solemn.

Qin Yu nodded and then shook his head.

If it involved karma, it was indeed a very dangerous Mystic Realm.

However, when his soul was injured for the first time, and he obtained the netherworld cultivation method, he had already been tainted by this karma.

He vaguely felt that it would be very difficult for his cultivation to advance further if he did not resolve the problem with the black Qin Yu.

“We’ll talk about it when the time comes,” Qin Yu said.

The man with the mustache sighed slightly.

“I want to ask Wang Feng some questions, and then I have to do some things.”

The man with the mustache’s expression was a little ugly as if he could roughly guess Qin Yu’s thoughts.

He left the Sumeru ring and arrived at the central square.

Jue Wu seemed to have rarely seen such a lively scene, so she started to wander around by herself.

She had the voice transmission jade talisman anyway, so she was not afraid of getting lost.

“Master, may I ask if my magical artifact has been refined?”

Qin Yu came to the dwarf master’s stall.

“I haven’t started yet.”

The dwarf master did not even raise his head.

“What do you mean? You made a vow by the Path of Heaven.”

Qin Yu was instantly displeased. Did this dwarf try to delay it?

“Definitely not. Who doesn’t know my Master Suo Lin’s reputation? It’s just that your robe has lost its artifact soul, but its material is extremely hard. Even though my refining fire is circulated to the maximum, it still can’t dissolve this robe.”

Suo Lin quickly explained.

“What should we do now?” Qin Yu suddenly had a headache. It was rare to come across a master refiner. Could it be that he also failed to repair Wu Ji’s robe?
