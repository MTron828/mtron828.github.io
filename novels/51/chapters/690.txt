Chapter 691: Exchange For Yan Ruoxue! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie coldly, and Qu Xie couldn’t help but tense up.

As the President of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, he had seen countless storms.

Facing Qin Yu, Qu Xie couldn’t help but shout, “Qin Yu, don’t go too far! I’m the President of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! Do you know the consequences of threatening us?!”

After Qu Xie’s reminder, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something.

He sneered, “I’ve changed my mind. I’ll only give you two days. Remember, two days at most.”

“If I don’t see Yan Ruoxue in two days, I’ll publicly punish the President of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“If the higher-ups are not afraid of losing their reputation, then go ahead!”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Burly and Robust followed behind Qin Yu. The entire journey was unimpeded, and no one dared to stop Qin Yu.

After leaving the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Qin Yu returned to the Green Moon Villa directly.

Burly and Robust didn’t have much time left, so Qin Yu could at most give the Jingdu Martial Arts Association two days.

If the Jingdu Martial Arts Association still didn’t let her go after two days, then Qin Yu would kill the President of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in front of everyone.

Very soon, this matter was spread out.

The President of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was captured. This was the first time in history.

“Even the President was captured alive. This is too f*cking ridiculous...”

“Yeah, to capture a thief, one must first capture the leader. TSK TSK, as expected of Qin Yu.”

“For Yan Ruoxue, this Qin Yu is really going all out...”

For a moment, there was a flurry of discussion. Almost everyone was discussing this matter.

The President was captured alive, and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was undoubtedly humiliated.

In the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Xia Hang could not help but silently smoke.

After thinking about it, Xia Hang stood up and walked into the office.

Upon arriving at the office, Xia Hang closed the door. Then, he took out his phone and called Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged in his room.

His face was cold and his eyes were slightly closed. Even so, he could still feel the murderous aura lingering around him.

Seeing Xia Hang’s phone call, Qin Yu frowned and then picked up the phone.

“Hello.” Qin Yu picked up the phone and his tone was extremely calm.

Xia Hang didn’t say any nonsense on the other end. He went straight to the point and said, “Qin Yu, to the higher-ups, Qu Xie is just a chess piece. They will most likely not agree to your request.”

As soon as he said that, Qin Yu’s expression turned extremely vicious.

He took a deep breath and asked, “Who are those higher-ups?”

Xia Hang smiled bitterly. “No one knows their identities. Even Qu Xie doesn’t know anything.”

Qin Yu fell into silence.

He didn’t have a deep understanding of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, nor did he know anything about the higher-ups.

“After all, Qu Xie is the president. Everyone in the world knows that. Even if they don’t care about Qu Xie’s life, they will care about Qu Xie’s position as the President,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Just as Qin Yu said, even the aristocratic families cared about their own reputation, let alone the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?

Now that Qu Xie had been captured alive, it could be said that the matter had become a hot topic.

If the Jingdu Martial Arts Association couldn’t even save the President, it would not only lose its reputation but also its prestige and dignity.

“I hope so,” Xia Hang said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu sneered, “Even if they really gave up on Qu Xie, it would still be beneficial to me.”

“If I kill Qu Xie, you will be the next president.”

Xia Hang was stunned, then he couldn’t help but smile bitterly, “That’s true.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “If you have any news, remember to inform me.”

After saying that, Qin Yu directly hung up the phone.

Then, Qin Yu got up and walked out of his room, all the way to a dark basement.

The basement was extremely damp and there was no light. Qin Yu even threw the coffin of the masked woman here.

The entire basement was extremely cold. Even Qu Xie was badly frozen.

In this basement, there was an extremely small dog cage.

At this moment, Qu Xie was locked in this dog cage. Burly and Robust were in charge of guarding it.

Qu Xie was trembling non-stop in the cage. His face was extremely pale and he looked like he was in extreme pain.

When he saw Qin Yu, Qu Xie immediately grabbed the metal bars of the cage.

“Qin Yu, let me out!” Qu Xie shouted furiously.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie coldly and said, “Why? Are you in pain?”

Qu Xie gritted his teeth and said, “I am the President of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! How could you lock me in such a small dog cage? I... I want to kill you!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “Why? Do you know what it feels like to have your dignity humiliated? Isn’t Yan Ruoxue uncomfortable being locked in a prison by you?”

“Don’t tell me those warriors who were charged with crimes because they disagreed with your association have no dignity!”

With a roar, the whole cage buzzed.

Dust fell in the entire basement.

“Qu Xie, I told you that I will make you suffer a thousand times more pain,” Qin Yu sneered.

Qu Xie glared at Qin Yu and said, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will not let you go. You are a dead meat!”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Qu Xie at all. He kicked the cage, turned around, and walked out.

At this moment, the Jingdu martial arts association was holding a meeting.

In the meeting room, the few higher-ups were still hiding in the darkness.

And the person presiding over the meeting this time was no longer Qu Xie, but Xia Hang.

“Qin Yu brought two extremely powerful people and forcefully broke into the prison,” Xia Hang reported truthfully.

“President Qu was holding the Martial Saint Weapon. Not only was he unable to harm Qin Yu, but even the Prajna ruler was also snatched away by Qin Yu.”

The meeting room was silent.

After an unknown amount of time, someone finally spoke, “Qu Xie is the president after all. He can not die. Even if he dies, he can not die at the hands of Qin Yu.”

“I agree, no matter what, we have to bring him back.”

Hearing this, Xia Hang hurriedly said, “But... Qin Yu said that he wants us to exchange him for Yan Ruoxue. Should we... agree to his request?”
