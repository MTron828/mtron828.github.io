The scale of this phenomenon showed that the person who had broken through was extraordinary!

For a moment, everyone was shocked by this scene. Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but look up.

“Someone has broken through again?”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice, his eyes filled with astonishment.

There were too many people who had broken through during this period of time. It was as if bamboo shoots had sprouted after a rain. One after another, they appeared, causing people to involuntarily appear one after another.

“Looking in this direction, the person who broke through… seems to be di zun!”The deputy sect master exclaimed.

“Di Zun?”Qin Yu was immediately shocked.

During this period of time, Di Zun had been in seclusion, causing Qin Yu to almost forget about this disciple of his.

“Speaking of which, I feel a little guilty for treating Di Zun,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He immediately activated his desolate God’s eye and looked in the direction of Di Zun.

Di Zun was currently facing the Heavenly Tribulation. The scale of his heavenly tribulation was extremely terrifying, and it was not inferior to Qin Yu’s Heavenly Tribulation!

Large areas of the Heavenly Cloud sect had turned into wasteland. If it was not for the protection of the sect’s formation, they would have already turned into ruins.

Di Zun, who was inoculated by the heavens, was exactly the same as Qin Yu’s tenacity. Facing such a terrifying heavenly tribulation, there was not a trace of panic on his face. Instead, his face was filled with fighting spirit!

Even though his body had been smashed into pieces by the heavenly tribulation, his face was still brimming with confidence.

This made Qin Yu feel rather gratified. He could not help but smile.

“With Di Zun’s ability, I’m afraid his future achievements will not be below mine,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

His eyes stared in the direction of Di Zun. He could not help but feel some anticipation in his heart.

At this moment, the cultivation mountain suddenly lit up with rays of light, and then a passage suddenly appeared on the Cultivation Mountain.

“This is the sect master’s invitation to go to the Cultivation Mountain,”said the deputy sect master.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude, and before he left, he glanced at Di Zun again.

After confirming that he could easily overcome the heavenly tribulation, Qin Yu rushed in the direction of the Cultivation Mountain.

He rushed all the way to the Cultivation Mountain.

The mountain was as usual, and Xiao Sheng was still as leisurely as before.

He sat in front of the table and slowly sipped his tea.

Xiao Sheng was not surprised to see Qin Yu rushing over. He did not even raise his head.

But at this moment, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with mixed feelings.

He slowly walked to the opposite side of Xiao Sheng and sat down. He was full of worries, but at this moment, he did not say a word.

“Very curious, is it?”At this moment, Xiao Sheng took the initiative to speak.

Qin Yu nodded.

From Xiao Sheng’s attitude, it was obvious that he had long known about the danger of the Eastern Wilderness.

“What kind of place is the Eastern Wilderness? Why do you want me to go to the Eastern Wilderness? What you told me before, is it true or false?”Qin Yu questioned coldly.

Xiao Sheng stood up. With his back facing Qin Yu, he said indifferently, “If you think it’s true, then it’s true. If you think it’s false, then it’s naturally false.”

Qin Yu immediately became furious. “I want you to tell me personally whether you want to kill someone else with a borrowed knife!”

Hearing this, Xiao Sheng laughed.

He said indifferently, “Kill someone with a borrowed knife? Do I need to use the East Wilderness to kill you?”

Qin Yu clenched his teeth and said, “I don’t want to believe it either, but I almost died in the east barren. How can I believe you!”

Xiao Sheng suddenly turned his head around.

His face was full of frost as he said coldly, “If you die in the east barren, it means that you are a waste. So what if you die? What can you do!”

Qin Yu was stunned. He said with great confusion, “What is your purpose for doing this? You should know that those things in the east barren are very difficult to deal with. They are not things that I can fight against!”

“Then aren’t you standing here well?”Xiao Sheng asked back.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “That is my luck.”

“Luck? Do you know what is Luck?”Xiao Sheng sneered.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

Xiao sheng snorted and said, “Luck is luck. It is a dao technique, a rule, and a part of the Heavenly Dao!”

“You were destined to come out of the East continent alive. Your so-called luck is only a part of the arrangement.”

“If your luck is good enough, it means that you are favored by the Heavenly Dao. At least, you are not the abandoned child.”

Qin Yu’s face became more and more confused. Xiao Sheng’s words made it difficult for him to understand.

Heavenly Dao? Dao technique? Rule?

What exactly did this mean?

Could it be that everything was arranged? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“I’ve told you long ago that luck is indispensable for cultivation,”Xiao Sheng continued.

“Your talent, your strength, and even your personality are all part of luck.”

“Some people are born dull and have a defect in their personality, causing them to be unable to achieve great things in their lives. whose problem do you think it is?”Xiao Sheng asked.

After hearing Xiao Sheng’s words, Qin Yu seemed to have understood something.

He said in a low voice, “Is it… Luck? Is it too bad?”

“Since you were born… No, since you were not born, everything has been fixed,”Xiao Sheng said slowly.

Qin Yu was silent. He sat there for a long time before he suddenly raised his head and asked, “So you want me to go to the East Wilderness to see my luck?”

“You can say that.”Xiao Sheng did not deny it.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then let me ask you, is what you told me earlier about the return of the fate of the land of dragons true or false?”

“I did not lie to you,”Xiao Sheng said faintly.

“To tell you the truth, over the years, I have sent many people to the East Wilderness. These people are people that I think highly of, but unfortunately, they all died in the east wilderness without any benefits.”

“You are the only one who walked out alive.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “That’s not right, right? Zhuo Jing’s father seems to have walked out of the East continent alive.”

“He did walk out alive, but unfortunately, he was bitten by the curse,”said Xiao Sheng.

“You knew about the curse a long time ago?”Qin Yu frowned.

Xiao sheng sneered and said, “When did I say I didn’t Know?”

“Don’t you think that you are too overbearing? You should at least tell me the truth. As for whether to go or not, it should be up to me to make the decision,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Xiao Sheng put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Let me ask you, if I told you everything in advance, would you choose to seek opportunities or give up because of fear?”

Qin Yu was stunned and suddenly had nothing to say.

Even if he knew in advance, Qin Yu would definitely go to the East Wilderness.

Xiao Sheng seemed to have planned everything. Qin Yu was at a loss for words.

“What is this curse of the East Wilderness?”Qin Yu frowned.

Xiao Sheng said slowly, “What Wen Wanyun said is true.”

“How do you know I asked Wen Wanyun?”Qin Yu was even more surprised.

Xiao Sheng said indifferently, “Besides Wen wanyun, who else can you ask?”
