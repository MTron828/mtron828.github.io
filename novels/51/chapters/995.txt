Chapter 996: Chapter 996, the Bashful Yu Qin

With a wicked smile on his face, Tie Dan walked towards Yu Qin step by step.

Seeing “Qin Yu”approaching her, a trace of doubt flashed across Yu Qin’s eyes.

The Qin Yu in front of her seemed to be somewhat different from the Qin Yu she knew.

“Stop the F * CK Right Now!”Seeing this, Qin Yu hurriedly shouted.

Iron Egg ignored Qin Yu. He walked to Yu Qin with a smile and reached out to touch her face.

Yu Qin’s face instantly turned red like a ripe tomato.

Iron Egg lifted Yu Qin’s face with one hand and said with a smile, “Little sister, do you have feelings for me?”

Yu Qin’s face was so red that it reached her neck. She stammered and couldn’t say a word.

“Tie Dan! Stop the F * CK Right Now!”Qin Yu immediately became impatient.

Tie Dan completely ignored Qin Yu. He gently caressed Yu Qin’s face and said with a smile, “Wait for me obediently in the room tonight.”

Yu Qin opened her mouth, her face as red as water.

Facing such a “Qin Yu”, she seemed to be at a loss.

Tie Dan seemed to be quite satisfied. He laughed out loud and then reminded, “Remember, leave the door open for me tonight.”

With that, tie Dan laughed out loud and walked away.

In his mind, Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse, “Tie Dan, are you F * cking crazy? Give me back my body quickly!”

Tie Dan rolled his eyes and said, “What? I’m helping you. After i sleep with her, she promises that she won’t like you anymore.”

“F * ck you! I don’t need it! Don’t ruin my reputation!”Qin Yu cursed.

Tie Dan snorted. “I have an appointment anyway. I have to go tonight no matter what.”

“Besides, I haven’t touched a woman in hundreds of years. Please satisfy me.”

“Satisfy you!”Qin Yu gnashed his teeth.

Tie Dan completely ignored Qin Yu. He hummed a little song with a happy face.

Even though Qin Yu begged him, tie Dan didn’t respond at all.

“How about this? I’ll find you a body and give you a batch of spirit stones. Can you give me back the body?”Qin Yu said with some pleading.

“When the time comes, if you like to find women, you can go by yourself. You can find as many women as you like, Okay?”

Tie Dan stretched his body and said, “That won’t do. Do you know how many times I’ve been looked down on because of my looks?”

“I’ve never known what it feels like to be liked by others. I have to give it a try no matter what I say today.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I’ll find you a handsome face. I guarantee that everyone will love you!”

Tie Dan touched his chin and said, “Are you serious?”

“Absolutely! I’ll do it!”Qin Yu said hurriedly.

Tie Dan Thought for a moment and continued, “Apart from a handsome face, I also need a strong body. I don’t want a normal body.”

“Okay, okay, okay. Tell me what body you want, and I’ll find you a body.”Qin Yu said with a headache.

“Okay.”Tie Dan stretched.

“But I have an appointment. How are you going to go tonight?”

Qin Yu said impatiently, “It’s none of your business. I’ll figure it out myself.”

Tie Dan sighed slightly and said unwillingly, “It’s a pity that such a good-looking girl was in my hands...”

“Alright, stop talking nonsense and give me back my body!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

Tie Dan agreed and then said, “I’m afraid I’ll have to sleep for a while. During this time, you have to think of a way yourself. If something happens, no one will save you.”

“I know,”Qin Yu said perfunctorily.

“By the way, how long will you sleep for?”Qin Yu added quickly.

“It’s hard to say. At least half a month, at most several years,”iron egg said.

“Okay, I got it. Hurry up and give me back my body,”Qin Yu urged.

Iron Egg didn’t waste any more time. He borrowed Qin Yu’s body and took a deep look at the world.

Then, he returned this body to Qin Yu’s divine sense.

A light flashed in his mind, and Qin Yu successfully took back the initiative.

He lowered his head to look at his own body. After confirming that he had taken back his body, he heaved a sigh of relief.

“F * ck, it’s really risky to lend your body to someone else,”Qin Yu muttered.

Then, he tried to call out to tie Dan in his mind, but tie Dan didn’t respond.

“He’s really asleep...”Qin Yu muttered.

Although tie Dan was powerful, his divine sense didn’t seem to be as powerful as he had imagined.

...

At night.

Qin Yu could not help but feel a headache.

He stood near Yu Qin’s house, not knowing whether he should go and see Yu Qin or not.

“Damn it, Yu Qin won’t take it seriously, right?”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

If Yu Qin was really ready in the room, how would he come down from the stage.

Qin Yu stood at the door and thought for a long time. In the end, he gritted his teeth and decided to explain it to Yu Qin.

Therefore, Qin Yu took a step forward and tiptoed to Yu Qin’s door.

He knocked lightly on the door, and soon, Yu Qin’s voice came from inside, “Come in... come in, I left the door open for you...”

Hearing this, Qin Yu felt a headache coming on.

What he was afraid of came true.

Qin Yu braced himself and pushed the door open.

As soon as the door opened, he saw Yu Qin sitting on the bed, looking at Qin Yu shyly.

Her clothes were thin, and her hair fell over her shoulders, revealing her fair skin.

On one side of the bed was a wooden barrel, in which water had already been placed.

A dense fragrance assailed her nostrils. Obviously, not only did Yu Qin take it seriously, she even specially prepared for it.

“You... You’re here.”Yu Qin’s voice was like a Mosquito’s humming, and her face was red to her neck. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She lowered her head slightly, as if she didn’t dare to look Qin Yu in the eye.
