Chapter 678: Invincible Physical Body! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s body sped towards the entrance of the fire pit!

The flames below were boiling as usual. It was like a huge hand that wanted to keep Qin Yu here!

But unfortunately, the True Fire could no longer do anything to Qin Yu, let alone stop him!

Above, the three purple-robed men looked at each other and said in a deep voice, “Let’s go. He won’t come out anymore.”

“Okay.”

The three of them reached an agreement and turned around to leave.

However, at this moment, they suddenly felt waves of powerful internal qi coming from behind them!

“You guys are actually still waiting for me.”

Before they could turn around, they heard Qin Yu’s voice!

They saw that not only was Qin Yu unharmed, but his body had even become more tough!

“You aren’t dead!” The purple-robed man took a step forward and berated loudly.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “I also didn’t expect that you guys would have such strong willpower. You’ve waited for me for at least a month, right?”

“As long as we can await you, it’s worth it no matter how long we wait.” The three people said with a cold smile.

Their bodies emitted a surging and terrifying aura. A wave of killing intent rushed straight towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu knew that the purple-robed men’s strength was unparalleled, but at this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to test his new body!

He placed his hands behind his back and looked at these three people quietly, as if he didn’t care about them at all.

And this completely infuriated the purple-robed men!

One of the purple-robed men shouted loudly, and his figure suddenly disappeared before appearing in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye!

“Clang!”

Qin Yu didn’t move and allowed his fist to land on his body!

The sound of metal colliding was heard, but Qin Yu was calm. His attack didn’t even leave a white mark!

“How... How is this possible?”

When they saw this scene, the three people’s expressions changed drastically!

How could Qin Yu’s body be so strong?!

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at his lower abdomen. He grinned and said, “This month has not been wasted...”

“What exactly did you get in this pit of fire?!” The purple-robed man asked coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You want to know? Jump in and you’ll know everything.”

“You’re courting death!”

The purple-robed men were unwilling to give up and once again stepped towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu still didn’t move at all. He used his body to take the punch head-on!

Under this punch, Qin Yu was forced back three steps, but he still couldn’t hurt Qin Yu!

“Tsk, just his body alone has such strength. If I add the Saintly Body Technique and the Venerable Fifth Mountain... What kind of state would I reach?” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s body suddenly erupted with a burst of golden internal qi! It was the Saintly Body Technique!

With the support of the Saintly Body Technique, Qin Yu’s physical body had already reached a freakish state!

“Let’s try again.” Qin Yu beckoned at them.

The three of them were unwilling to give up. They pinched the light in their hands and charged at Qin Yu once again!

“Boom!”

Countless rays of bright light lit up, and the ground beneath Qin Yu’s feet instantly exploded!

In an instant, sand and stones flew everywhere, as if a sandstorm had been blown up!

However, when the sand and dust fell, Qin Yu still stood there, not moving at all!

“It seems that this physical body is even stronger than I imagined,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

At this moment, the expressions of the three people instantly became extremely unsightly!

“I’m afraid that no one below the Martial Saint level can compare to this guy’s physical body!” One of the purple-robed men said in a deep voice.

“Our spells... actually can’t hurt him!”

Qin Yu sized up the three of them and said with a sneer, “If you don’t make a move, I will.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s feet shook, and rays of light rippled out from under his feet!

This spell was precisely Heavy Falling Space! The three of them instantly slowed down a lot!

Qin Yu took large strides forward. He clenched his golden fist, and with the strength of his physical body, he ruthlessly threw a punch!

“Puff!”

This punch actually pierced through the purple-robed man’s chest!

The fist smashed into the chest and stretched out from the chest!

“As expected, the stronger the body, the stronger the strength,” Qin Yu said to himself.

“You... you...” the purple-robed man’s eyes widened, as if he couldn’t believe the scene in front of him.

Qin Yu grinned and said, “I will take the Golden Core on your body.”

After saying that, Qin Yu violently stretched out his palm and inserted it into his dantian, pulling out the Golden Core!

“Ah!!!”

This kind of pain was like the separation of the soul. The pain was unbearable!

After taking away the Golden Core, Qin Yu threw his body into the fire pit.

“Don’t you want to know what’s inside? Go and explore it yourself.” Qin Yu grinned and said.

In the blink of an eye, he had killed a purple-robed man. The remaining two were already panicking!

“It seems that it’s true that he killed Geng Si...” The two said in surprise.

Qin Yu looked at the two coldly and said with a sneer, “Don’t worry, I’ll send you two in right away.”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s feet shook and he stepped toward the two!

Qin Yu’s fist contained immortal power, and every punch had the power to destroy mountains and rivers!

Under the influence of the Heavy Falling Space, these two people had no way to dodge!

Qin Yu’s fist smashed into their bodies, shattering their bodies and breaking their bones!

In just a few minutes, these two people were already dripping with blood. It was a tragic sight!

Qin Yu sneered. “It seems that the purple-robed men of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association are only so-so. I really wonder who you guys should send to kill me in the future.”

“Qin Yu, don’t be so arrogant. Let me tell you...”

“Pa!”

Before he could finish his words, his golden palm had already smashed his head into pieces.

In just a moment, these three people had all been reduced to corpses.

The fresh blood on the ground was quickly evaporated by the flames. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After the wind blew, not a trace of blood could be seen at the scene.

“This month has really not been wasted,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“With this body, anyone below the Martial Saint level won’t be a threat.” Qin Yu sneered.

Of course, Qin Yu also knew very clearly that the reason he could kill these three people so easily was not only because of his own strength, but also because of another reason.

It was because these three people were in an extremely dispirited state. After staying in this desert for an entire month, it was already good enough for them to display thirty percent of their full strength.

Qin Yu bent down and took out the Golden Cores from these two people’s bodies. Then, he threw their bodies into the fire pit.

After playing with the three Golden Cores, Qin Yu immediately swallowed them into his stomach.

In an instant, an extremely pure spiritual energy spread out in Qin Yu’s body!

The effect of this Golden Core far surpassed that of a panacea! It was almost equivalent to forcibly seizing the cultivation of others!

It was also because of this reason that in ancient times, people would specifically come to plunder other people’s Golden Cores and rely on this to cultivate!

“If only I could have more Golden Cores...” Qin Yu thought to himself.

As long as he had enough Golden Cores, Qin Yu would be able to step into the Martial Saint realm as soon as possible!

“I really hope that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the major aristocratic families can send more people...” Qin Yu grinned.
