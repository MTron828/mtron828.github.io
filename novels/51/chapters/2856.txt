“Almost all the people involved in this matter have died. No one can know the truth.”

Wu Tian smiled.

“One thing is clear. The Burial Heaven Cave and the Path of Heaven are not compatible. However, my Seven Tribulations Sin was blocked by the power of the Path of Heaven. It could not enter the Burial Heaven Cave. In other words, the two seem to have some common interests.”

Wu Tian suddenly burst into laughter. Golden blood oozed out of his mouth again.

“How interesting! This person made both of them have the same goal. Could this be the end of the era?”

“Anyway, all of this has nothing to do with me. Hahaha!”

“Buddha Wu Tian.”

Pang De looked at Wu Tian with an ugly expression. He did not know what Wu Tian had seen.

However, this was the first time he had seen Wu Tian in such a state.

For the first time, he felt a deep sense of urgency. He wanted to know what had happened in the Burial Heaven Cave.

At this moment, after the Power of the Ancients exploded.

There were also countless gazes focused on it. The huge change in the Burial Heaven Cave this time was not sudden. Many pieces of information could be deduced in advance.

A few people were standing very far away from the Burial Heaven Cave.

“You’re getting stronger and stronger. How I wish to see your limit. This is really interesting.”

A white-robed Immortal Crane chuckled.

Beside it was Xiao Sheng, whom it hadn’t seen for a long time.

His expression was calm. As he walked, the faint sound of thunder could be heard.

The people beside Immortal Crane were all shocked.

They were all demon races who had awakened their peak power. They could feel Xiao Sheng’s presence.

Every strand of his internal qi erupted with a strong aura of resistance. It seemed to be squeezing out the power of the Path of Heaven.

“What an overbearing peak power! I’ve never seen such an overbearing power.”

The Vermilion Bird’s expression in its human form changed drastically. The human in front of it was someone that the king valued.

Compared to them, his strength from the beginning could even be said to be weak.

However, no one dared to underestimate this human because they would realize the difference between them every time they saw Xiao Sheng.

Their distance was shrinking at an unimaginable speed. His newly awakened peak power could even make him cross the realm and kill them.

The awakening of such a peak power had already proved one thing.

As long as this human did not have any accidents, he was destined to catch up to them and trample them under his feet.

One of the demon races could not help but reveal killing intent on its face.

No matter how much the king valued him, he was still a human.

“I want to go in.”

Xiao Sheng’s voice was calm.

He had never thought much. As long as he wanted to go, he would go.

“I don’t think I’ve ever made any requests of you. I hope you don’t go in. I don’t quite understand what happened this time.”

Immortal Crane took out an exquisite wine cup from its sleeve and took a sip.

“Of course, I will not stop you if you still wish to enter.”

Immortal Crane laughed and moved aside.

“Can I ask you a question?”

“Does the Path of Heaven do anything as it pleases and there’s no way to stop it?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Sheng’s eyes were burning.

“It’s indeed the case from the Primordial Chaos stage to the present. Therefore, no matter if it is the human race, the demon race, the monster race, or the ghost race, they all have a glorious aura. Some other small races will also experience some kind of adjustment that will lead to their extreme prosperity, decline, and then return. This is an irreversible order in the universe. This is my understanding.”

Immortal Crane took another sip of wine and smiled.

It seemed to know the reason why Xiao Sheng asked.

“We can’t resist the Path of Heaven?”

“The human race’s supreme power, the Heaven-defying Power, has already revealed the answer.”

“Wouldn’t it be even more interesting if I can accomplish what the predecessors failed to do?”

Xiao Sheng’s power was gathering. He looked relaxed like a retired old man cutting flowers.

He was doing what he liked. At this moment, he looked very happy.

It was the kind of joy that came from the divine soul. There was no sense of nervousness at all.

“Sometimes I really envy you. You represent yourself, but the burden behind me is far from that simple. Countless drops of blood have poured down this path in front of me. Going against the heavens is impossible for me.”

Immortal Crane looked at Xiao Sheng, who was shining brightly. It was in a daze.

It was as if it saw its past self in this young man.

“Moreover, this path isn’t feasible. Many humans are already trying to preserve their descendants amid such changes. This is what those who have seen through should do. What you said is very dangerous. When a seed like you germinates in your mind, you will be sensed by the unseen.”

“What if the odds of winning start to change?”

Xiao Sheng opened his mouth, revealing two rows of teeth.

Under the illumination of the eternal night light, they appeared extremely awe-inspiring.

“Shut up! Stop spouting nonsense in front of the king. There are billions of geniuses in the entire universe. The number of top-notch talents is overwhelming. Why don’t you have a look at yourself?”

Black Tortoise let out a muffled sound. Its turbid eyes stared fixedly at Qin Yu.

If this person dared to disobey the king’s orders, then it would immediately attack with all its might and nip him in the bud.

According to what Immortal Crane said, even a thought would bring trouble to the demon race.

Xiao Sheng didn’t care about Black Tortoise at all. At this moment, he finally released all his power.

The expression on his face was a little ferocious. A layer of dark light appeared on his body.

Everyone including Immortal Crane found that the world had fallen into dead silence when this power appeared.

The sound of air flowing and the sound of holy energy being released from everyone’s pores could not be heard.

Even the sound of the void behind the space and the sound of time passing had disappeared.

“I shall call this style the Eternal Darkness Kingdom.”

Other than Immortal Crane, the last thing the demon race saw was a simple punch.

It was like the flag of a general.

Countless dark powers that were thousands of times darker than eternal nights rushed out of the world created by the punch.

No one could sense where these dark forces came from and where they were about to attack.

No one could predict its trajectory. The divine sense that covered everyone and even peak power was devoured.

It was as if no power could interfere with this domineering power.

An extremely dense dark power shot out from Xiao Sheng’s hand.

Eternal Kingdom.

Above the Burial Heaven Cave, a Darkness Kingdom exploded above the Power of the Ancients.

It was a kingdom built by the power of dark matter.
