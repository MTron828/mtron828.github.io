Chapter 1106: Chapter 1,106, cooperation with a higher-being

That voice was extremely majestic, and its ancient internal Qi was even more astonishing.

Everyone stopped at this moment and quietly looked in that direction.

“Senior, we didn’t mean to offend you.”Yao Meng took the lead and cupped her hands.

She wanted to say something else, but was interrupted by that higher-being.

“Alright, there’s no need to say anything else. The holy region is about to open. I don’t want any accidents to happen at this time,”the higher-being said.

Everyone remained silent, waiting for him to continue.

The almighty expert continued, “Each of you will pick three strange flowers. You can leave now.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately felt secretly delighted.

Although Yun Long would definitely lose if they really fought, offending an almighty expert at this juncture wasn’t a wise move.

Thus, Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Many thanks for Senior’s help.”

“Master, how can we give this strange flower to them!”Yun long immediately felt somewhat anxious.

“Alright, there’s no need to say anymore. Just do as I say,”said the mighty figure.

Yun long gritted his teeth. He looked at Qin Yu and the others with an indignant expression and said, “Consider yourselves Lucky!”

“Perhaps you are the lucky one,”Qin Yu replied with a smile.

Yun long snorted coldly and didn’t say anything more. He immediately retreated to the side.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He quickly walked forward and prepared to pick the exotic flowers.

The exotic flowers all looked the same, and the internal Qi flowing on them was extremely mysterious.

According to legends, the exotic flowers were a type of herb that could provide a large amount of spiritual qi. Moreover, they were the main ingredients of many divine rank herbs.

‘three strange flowers can allow me to refine at least three sky origin pills,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

With these three sky origin pills, there was hope for the rest to step into the intermediate stage of the Martial Saint Realm.

Looking at the strange flowers that filled the mountains and plains, Qin Yu could not help but feel a little greedy in his heart.

If he could keep all these strange flowers in his bag, the improvement that would be brought would be beyond imagination.

“Young man, don’t be too greedy.”That almighty seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s intentions, and his voice couldn’t help but carry a hint of warning.

Qin Yu’s eyes rolled, and he cupped his hands and said, “Senior has misunderstood. I am a pharmacist, so I am quite sensitive to strange flowers.”

“You are actually a pharmacist?”That Almighty’s voice carried a hint of surprise.

Qin Yu’s heart rejoiced.

Looks like there’s a chance!

Thereupon, Qin Yu stood up. With a slight shake of his palm, a ball of purple-colored spiritual fire landed in his palm.

“That’s right. I plan to use a strange flower to refine a sky yuan pill,”Qin Yu continued.

“Sky Yuan Pill? You can refine a sky yuan pill?”There was a hint of excitement in the Almighty’s voice. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. I can use a strange flower to refine at least a heavenly essence pill.”

“Is that true?”That Almighty’s voice became even more excited.

“It’s absolutely true, senior. Why would I lie to You!”Qin Yu said.

At this moment, Yun long could not help but coldly say, “Master, don’t be deceived by this kid. He just wants to take a few more strange flowers.”

That Almighty was silent for a moment, and then said coldly, “If you really can refine the heavenly essence pill, I might consider giving you a few more strange flowers. But, you also have to refine the heavenly essence pill for me.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Of course there’s no problem! I Can’t wait for it, Senior!”

“Master! This kid is lying to you!”Yun long immediately became anxious.

The mighty figure in the valley said in a deep voice, “Yun Long is right. No one knows whether what you said is true or not.”

“What I said is absolutely true!”Qin Yu patted his chest and said.

“How about this? I will refine the heavenly essence pill for you on the spot. If I can successfully refine it, you and I will cooperate. If the refinement fails, you will immediately kill me. How about it?”Qin Yu said.

That Almighty was silent for a moment before he said in a deep voice, “Alright, but the others have to leave immediately.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at Chang Mang and the others and said unwillingly, “Senior, they are all my friends. I guarantee that they will not cause any trouble. I am willing to vouch for them!”

“No need to say more. Tell them to leave immediately. I don’t want to say it again,”that Almighty said coldly.

Qin Yu opened his mouth, wanting to say something else, but the almighty shouted, “If you dare to say any more nonsense, all of you will scram!”

“Qin Yu, we are already very satisfied that we can obtain these three strange flowers,”Yao Meng said with a smile.

“Since senior isn’t willing to let us stay here, then we will leave.”

“That’s right, Qin Yu. You have to be more careful.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only sigh slightly and nod, “Alright. If there’s a chance, I’ll leave this place as soon as possible and give you the Heavenly Yuan Pill.”

“Oh right, you can go to the Divine Alchemist pavilion to look for the pavilion master and let her refine the heavenly yuan pill.”

“En.”Everyone nodded.

They each picked three strange flowers and then turned around to leave.

After they all left, Yun long stood in front of Qin Yu.

“Kid, don’t waste time. I want to see how you refine the Heavenly Essence Pill,”Yun Long said with a cold tone.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took out the cauldron with a thought.

There were a lot of herbs stored in Qin Yu’s spatial divine artifact. These herbs were enough to support Qin Yu in refining the heavenly essence pill.

“I can’t guarantee that a strange flower will be able to refine a few heaven essence pills,”said Qin Yu.

“It’s enough that a strange flower can refine one,”said the mighty figure.

“I’ll give you three chances. If you fail three times, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and didn’t say anything else. He immediately plucked a strange flower and threw it into the cauldron.

Following that, Qin Yu began to refine the strange flower with a purple spiritual fire burning in his palm.

According to Qin Yu’s self-deduction, a strange flower should be able to refine a heavenly yuan pill. Who knew how many Heavenly Yuan pills this strange flower could refine.
