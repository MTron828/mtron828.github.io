1773 Thunder Courtyard

Qin Yu originally wanted to refuse, but after thinking carefully, if Jue Wu accompanied him, the journey would indeed be much smoother.

The more powerful the primordial spirit was, the faster Qin Yu’s recovery.

If Qin Yu encountered a powerful cultivator, perhaps Jue Wu could help Qin Yu.

Therefore, Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

In the next few days, Qin Yu continued to bear the pain.

Qin Yu’s ability to adapt was extremely good. After this period of time, he was able to live with the pain, and he even could also mobilize the spiritual power in his body.

Although the strength he had now was far from his peak, it was still much stronger than before.

Three days passed by.

On this day, Qin Yu bid farewell to everyone and brought Jue Wu to Tianyun Sect.

Seeing Jue Wu beside Qin Yu, Xiao Sheng seemed to be a little surprised.

“Jue Wu, why are you here?” Xiao Sheng asked.

“I also want to go to Thunder Courtyard!” Jue Wu said proudly.

Xiao Sheng did not ask any further. “Alright then, let’s set off now.”

“Right now?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

Xiao Sheng nodded and walked out of Tianyun Sect.

The three of them set out on the road to Thunder Courtyard.

Thunder Courtyard was not far from Nanzhou. It was just opposite the organization, Hunter.

However, the Azure Rock Forest was in between, so they couldn’t go right toward Thunder Courtyard.

There was only one way to Thunder Courtyard, and it was a small path that had been discovered after so many people died on their way.

While walking on the road, Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I won’t stay in Thunder Courtyard for too long. Once my primordial spirit recovers, I’ll leave. That place won’t give me much improvement.”

Qin Yu, who had dragon blood, did not need Thunder Courtyard at all.

Xiao Sheng shot a glance at Qin Yu and said, “Haven’t you always wanted to go to dragon blood? Thunder Courtyard is your only way.”

Qin Yu immediately asked, “What do you mean?”

Xiao Sheng said, “Thunder Courtyard has teleportation formations, and one of them is on Demon-slaying Peak.”

“Their actions are not limited to Nanzhou. It includes the entire Holy Region.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp and said in surprise, “Is Thunder Courtyard that powerful? Is Zhongzhou also within their territory?”

“Are there no weaklings in Zhongzhou?” Xiao Sheng asked.

Qin Yu thought about it and agreed with him.

Perhaps Thunder Courtyard could not afford to offend some aristocratic families, but most cultivators were not that powerful.

“In other words, it’s very likely that I’ll be able to go to Zhongzhou with the help of Thunder Courtyard.” Qin Yu slightly squinted his eyes.

“That’s right.” Xiao Sheng slightly nodded.

This instantly reignited the spirit of Qin Yu, who had been a little upset.

As long as he could see Yan Ruoxue as soon as possible, everything he had experienced was worth it!

After a few days, the three of them finally arrived at Thunder Courtyard.

Thunder Courtyard was different from what Qin Yu had imagined.

He had thought that this place would be similar to an academy on earth, but after arriving, they realized that it was extremely huge! It was almost as large as Xihuang!

There were nine stone pillars that were extremely tall, and on each stone pillar, there were a few large words!

Xiao Sheng said, “There are nine main peaks in Thunder Courtyard, and Demon-slaying Peak is one of them. Because the nine main peaks are very far apart, they don’t usually have much interaction with each other.”

After saying that, Xiao Sheng raised his finger and pointed to the front.

There was a huge stone gate here, and the scenery inside could be seen through the stone gate.

Xiao Sheng continued, “This was the center of Thunder Courtyard. You won’t come here unless there’s something important.”

Qin Yu nodded.

It was completely unreasonable to call this place a courtyard. It would be better to call it a state.

“Why is this place called Thunder Courtyard?” Qin Yu asked in confusion.

Xiao Sheng glanced at Qin Yu and said, “This is a place of emperors.”

Qin Yu gasped when he heard that!

A place of emperor meant that there had been emperors born or raised in this place.

Emperors were even more powerful than great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage.

In the entire history of the Holy Region, there had only been a few emperors.

Xiao Sheng continued, “Lei Ming is the person who became an emperor. People call him Immortal Emperor Lei.”

Qin Yu swallowed and said, “No wonder Thunder Courtyard has such a high status in Lizhou.”

Xiao Sheng said, “The current dean is a descendant of Immortal Emperor Lei. He has the emperor’s blood in his body and is also a powerful figure that no one can see through.”

Qin Yu quickly looked at Xiao Sheng and said, “How strong is he? Is he stronger than you?”

Xiao Sheng rarely smiled but now he actually smiled at Qin Yu.

Xiao Sheng shook his head and said, “You’re overestimating me.”

“You still don’t understand what it means to have the emperor’s blood flowing in one’s body. They are one of the most powerful people in the entire cultivation world.” Xiao Sheng sighed.

Qin Yu did not say anything after he heard that. But actually, he was shocked and kind of envious.

He had never thought that there would be such a strong person in Lizhou!

The dean was actually a descendant of an Immortal Emperor. He must be terrifyingly powerful.

If he had an Emperor Weapon, no one in the entire Holy Region or even the entire universe would dare to provoke him!

“Remember, you can offend anyone here, but not the Dean,” Xiao Sheng said as he walked.

Qin Yu said, “I see.”

They walked to the stone gate of Thunder Courtyard.

There were no guards, but the divine power from the stone gate was extremely terrifying. No one could force their way in.

Xiao Sheng took a step forward and said in a tone that was neither humble nor pushy, “I am Xiao Sheng. I am here to see Dean Lei.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

His voice was not loud. If Dean Lei wasn’t around, he would not be able to hear Xiao Sheng clearly.

However, after a short while, the divine power on the stone gate disappeared.

Xiao Sheng said, “Let’s go.”

Qin Yu nodded. He and Jue Wu followed behind Xiao Sheng and walked into Thunder Courtyard.

In a courtyard, a white-haired old man seemed to be meditating.

This man looked extremely old. He had a hunched figure and a calm internal qi. If he was placed in a crowd, no one would look at him twice.

This person was Dean Lei, Lei Xin, who had the blood of an emperor flowing in his veins.

“How’s it going, Dean Lei?” Xiao Sheng bowed slightly.

The old man opened his eyes. He looked at Xiao Sheng and smiled, “Xiao Sheng, long time no see.”

Xiao Sheng bowed again and said, “Yeah. I haven’t come to see you for a long time.”

This was the first time Qin Yu had seen Xiao Sheng being so respectful. Qin Yu was really surprised.

“What do you want? Have you thought it through? As I said, Thunder Courtyard will always be open to you.” Dean Lei laughed.

Xiao Sheng shook his head. “It wasn’t me. It was this young man.”

After saying that, Xiao Sheng turned to look at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu quickly came forward, bowed and said, “It’s my honor to meet you, Dean Lei.”
