Chapter 875: Chapter 875, the war in the martial arts world 

These words made ye Qing want to laugh.

However, he had to admit that Qin Yu’s words were indeed reasonable.

Even the higher-ups had the intention to use Qin Yu to restrict the Jingdu martial arts association and even weaken their strength.

“Officer Ye, I will try to find out information about the remaining three organizations, but it is impossible to do so in half a month’s time,”Qin Yu stood up and said.

Ye Qing was silent for a moment before he said, “I will take you to see the Mystic Realm Master in three days.”

“Three days is too long.”Qin Yu shook his head and said.

Ever since he saw that palace master Han was about to become a martial saint, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with a sense of crisis.

“If possible, it would be best if we set off now,”Qin Yu said.

Ye Qing frowned and said, “It’s the New Year now. Do you think it’s appropriate to disturb others?”

“Not everyone is like you and me. They have no parents and no family.”

Qin Yu was helpless and could only nod and say, “I’ll listen to you. I’ll come and look for you in three days.”

After saying goodbye to Ye Qing, Qin Yu turned around and left.

He rushed back to the Divine Alchemist pavilion that night.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion was also deserted.

Many pharmacists had already rushed back for the New Year. Not even peaches were left behind.

Other than Qin Yu who had brought Little Qing back from the mystic realm, Old Mister Yan, and the new Zhang Yi Jiu, only the pavilion master was left.

At this moment, a few people were sitting at a round table, celebrating the new year.

Seeing Qin Yu rush back, the pavilion master waved his hand and smiled, “You came back at the right time.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly, “Pavilion Master, I’m afraid I don’t have the leisure to be elegant.”

The pavilion master raised his brows and said, “I’ve been busy for a year. It’s the end of the year. It’s time to rest.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Every minute and second is time.”

Immediately, Qin Yu told the pavilion master about the fact that the palace master of Han Palace had almost become a martial saint.

“The world is so big. No one can guarantee that no one will be able to quickly become a martial saint.”Qin Yu sighed and said.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the pavilion master did not insist anymore.

“You, come with me.”Qin Yu pulled Zhang Yi Jiu up and turned around to go downstairs.

After coming downstairs, Zhang Yi Jiu broke free from Qin Yu’s hand and said with some anger, “If you’re crazy, no one will go crazy with you! I don’t want to cause trouble during the New Year!”

Qin Yu glanced at Zhang Yi Jiu and said, “You should know that I could have killed you a long time ago, especially when you betrayed me.”

Zhang Yi Jiu’s face slightly changed.

She thought that Qin Yu didn’t know, but she didn’t expect that Qin Yu had seen through it long ago.

Qin Yu dragged Zhang Yi Jiu all the way to his elder’s residence.

Then, Qin Yu took out the glazed ice heart from the spatial artifact.

The glazed ice heart flickered with a strange dark blue light in the darkness, looking extremely mysterious.

“How should I use this thing?”Qin Yu asked.

Zhang Yi Jiu took a look and said, “How would I know? No one is allowed to get close to this thing except for the palace master.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He tried to hang the glazed ice heart above his head, but it still had no effect.

“Could it be that the glazed ice heart is no longer effective?”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

“I heard brother song say that the palace master wants to devour this thing.”At this moment, Zhang Yi Jiu suddenly said.

“Devour?”Qin Yu was stunned.

“Swallow this thing into your stomach?”

Zhang Yi Jiu spread his hands and said, “Then I don’t know. In any case, the palace master has been relying on this thing to cultivate.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

The devouring in Zhang Yi Jiu’s mouth shouldn’t be directly swallowed into the stomach, but a method of absorption.

For example, Qin Yu’s heaven swallowing technique.

Therefore, Qin Yu tried to use the heaven swallowing technique to feel the ice and snow glazed heart.

Sure enough, the moment he used the heaven swallowing technique, the ice and snow glazed heart began to flash with traces of blue internal Qi.

This internal Qi flowed into Qin Yu’s body.

This internal Qi was extremely strange. It was neither Qi/spiritual energy nor yin qi, but it could quickly rush into the golden core.

“This is really a treasure.”Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes and could not help but be a little surprised.

The speed of this aura merging was far above the speed of internal Qi/spiritual energy and internal Qi!

If he could completely devour this thing, not to mention stepping into the martial saint realm, he could at least step into the half-step martial saint realm!

However, Qin Yu was not in a hurry. It was not safe to break through here.

Qin Yu put away the ice and snow glazed heart. He swallowed all the golden core that he had obtained over the past few days and slowly absorbed it.

It took Qin Yu an entire night to completely absorb all the jindan that he had obtained in the past few days.

The next day, the first day of the New Year.

This was a day that people gathered in the streets and alleys.

And at this time, the Jingdu martial arts association was still in the midst of rebuilding.

With their financial resources and connections, rebuilding was not a problem at all.

Moreover, what Qin Yu destroyed was only a part of the facade. The true depths were intact. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

On this day, a number of luxury cars were parked at the entrance of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

And in an office in the depths of the Jingdu martial arts association, it was filled with people.

The person who was presiding over the meeting was none other than the person in charge of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Gu Xinghe.

He sat at the front with his eyes slightly closed, as if he was waiting for someone.

The number of people in the office increased, and soon, the entire conference room was filled.

At a glance, there were at least a dozen people in the entire conference room.

These people were all dressed in noble clothes, and their internal Qi was not ordinary.

At this moment, Gu Xinghe finally opened his eyes.

He swept his gaze over the crowd and said faintly, “I’m truly sorry for inviting everyone to participate in the conference during the New Year. I hope everyone can understand.”

“Mr. Gu, you must be joking. It’s our honor to be able to serve the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,”everyone said.

Gu Xinghe cleared his throat and stood up. “Just yesterday, a sect came to me and requested to be protected by our Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“There was no other reason. It was because of Qin Yu, who was about to be exterminated if they didn’t agree with each other.”

At this point, Gu Xinghe’s expression instantly turned extremely cold.

Everyone present seemed to have already guessed Gu Xinghe’s intentions, so they weren’t too surprised.

“From today onwards, I hope that everyone can work together to kill Qin Yu!”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

As soon as he said this, everyone immediately started discussing in low voices.

“Mr. GU, it’s not that we are unwilling to help, but that Qin Yu’s strength is extraordinary. How can we contend against him?”Someone stood up and said.

“Yes, even a half-step martial saint is not worth mentioning in the hands of Qin Yu, unless a martial saint is mobilized.”

Gu Xinghe glanced at everyone and said coldly, “You’ve Underestimated Qin Yu. His intention is not to fight alone, but to start a war in the Martial World!”

“A war is not something that can be accomplished by two people alone! It is a large-scale battle between martial artists!”

Just as Gu Xinghe said, Qin Yu was indeed preparing to start a war in the martial arts world.

This was also the reason why he created the Heaven’s Gate!

Once he completely fell out with the Jingdu martial arts association, it would be a long-term war!

Even so, everyone still had some concerns.

“Don’t worry, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will pour in resources for you,”Gu Xinghe said faintly.

“Mr. Gu, our family head also wants to participate.”

At this moment, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

This person’s entire body was wrapped in a black robe, but no internal Qi could be seen.

Gu Xinghe frowned slightly and asked, “Who is your family head?”

The Man in the black robe said faintly, “Our master is called Tian Xuehong.”
