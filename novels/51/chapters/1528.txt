Chapter 1529: Chapter 1,529, it’s Too Late! 1

Just as Sima Bei was in shock, the shattered lightning had already shot out in all directions.

“Not good!”

Looking at the lightning that was approaching him, Sima Bei’s expression changed greatly. He hurriedly wanted to dodge, but it was already too late.

“Hong!”

The lightning exploded on his chest, forcing him back an unknown distance. The ground was even left with a long scar!

“Pu!”

Sima bei, who was lying on the ground, spat out a mouthful of blood.

His chest had been pierced through and was dripping with blood.

“This heavenly tribulation... is actually so terrifying,”Sima bei muttered softly.

If it was just his physical body, Sima bei would not be able to compete with Qin Yu. Now that he had suffered this blow, he finally understood how terrifying this heavenly tribulation was.

The heavenly tribulation was like raindrops, shooting out in all directions.

For a moment, Sima bei did not have the mood to chase after Zhuo Jing. Instead, he started to dodge in a flurry.

It was not only Sima Bei, Zhuo Jing and Qin Yu who were frantically dodging the heavenly tribulation.

......

That jade-like hand had already disappeared without a trace. The divine picture fell to the ground without any internal Qi.

Qin Yu pulled out his iron rod. As he retreated, he welcomed the heavenly tribulation.

After an unknown amount of time, the heavenly tribulation completely dissipated.

Everyone was panting, feeling extremely scared.

“Damn, this heavenly tribulation is terrifying.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inwardly.

He picked up the divine picture from the ground and studied it carefully.

Fortunately, the divine picture was intact and didn’t suffer any damage from the heavenly tribulation.

“That Palm... why did it come out of this divine picture?”Qin Yu murmured.

He only felt that it was a little terrifying. How terrifying was this divine picture that shattered the heavenly tribulation with just one palm!

“I’m afraid I underestimated this divine picture.”Qin Yu sighed inwardly.

Not only Qin Yu, even the man with the mustache could not see the true power of this divine picture.

But now wasn’t the time to think about this. The most important thing was the ninth heavenly tribulation.

“As long as I survive this heavenly tribulation, I’ll be able to successfully step into the mighty realm,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The Sky was completely silent. After a long time, no heavenly tribulation descended.

If it weren’t for the dense dark clouds hovering above his head, people would probably think that the heavenly tribulation was over.

Sima bei, who was not far away, finally got some breathing space.

He looked at the injuries on his body and couldn’t help but feel a little angry.

“I really didn’t expect that you would be in such a sorry state,”Sima Bei said coldly.

He didn’t want to wait any longer. After these few blows, Sima bei was already heavily injured, and even his internal Qi wasn’t that stable anymore.

As for the ninth heavenly tribulation, no one knew what would happen.

Thus, Sima bei looked in Zhuo Jing’s direction. The coldness was like a blade, and Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but Shiver.

“Kid, it’s time for you to pay the price,”Sima Bei said coldly.

With that, his feet shook, and he headed straight for Zhuo Jing!

His speed was so fast that it made people speechless!

Zhuo Jing naturally didn’t dare to be negligent. He relied on his nimble movement technique to turn around and run!

“You won’t be able to escape.”Sima bei sneered.

His body flashed with boundless radiance once again, and his domain power once again expanded!

“Kid, it’s all over.”Sima bei raised his palm and lightly pinched in Zhuo Jing’s direction.

Zhuo Jing, who was running away, froze in mid-air!

The domain surrounding Sima Bei’s body was actually transferred to Zhuo Jing’s body!

His body was enveloped by this radiance, and the powerful pressure made Zhuo Jing unable to move at all!

“It’s over...”Zhuo Jing’s face was filled with horror and incomparable terror!

In a short moment, Sima Bei had already arrived in front of Zhuo Jing.

Even though Zhuo Jing tried his best to resist, his body was unable to move.

“Run, why aren’t you running?”Sima bei said coldly.

Countless thoughts flashed through Zhuo Jing’s mind. He subconsciously looked in the direction of Qin Yu. At this moment, the ninth heavenly tribulation had yet to descend.

“As long as I stall for time, the mission will be completed,”Zhuo Jing thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Zhuo Jing looked at Sima bei and smiled, “Lord Sima Bei’s strength is indeed not something we can compare to.”

Sima bei raised his eyebrows and then sneered, “So?”

Zhuo Jing sighed and said somewhat sorrowfully, “Rather than using an egg to strike a stone, why not... join you and join the Northern Lands?”

“Join me?”Sima bei could not help but laugh out loud.

“Kid, just now you were still evading it in every possible way and were full of determination. Why have you changed your Mind Now?”Sima bei said with a cold smile.

Zhuo Jing sighed slightly and said, “I originally thought that with my own strength, I would at least be able to contend with you, not to mention defeating you. But now I’ve realized that the gap between us is too big. It’s simply not something I can resist.”

Hearing Zhuo Jing’s words, the corners of Sima Bei’s mouth could not help but curl into a cold smile.

He raised his hand and took Zhuo Jing’s Silver Spring.

“This sword is not bad.”Sima bei said indifferently.

Zhuo Jing’s heart thumped, but he still maintained a smile on his face, “If you like it, feel free to take it.”

“Oh? Really?”Sima bei was slightly amused.

“Of course, take it as me expressing my loyalty.”Zhuo Jing laughed.

Sima bei laughed loudly, “Interesting, interesting! It’s a pity that it’s too late for you to join the Northern Lands Now!”

After saying this, the silver spring in Sima Bei’s hand pierced straight into Zhuo Jing’s lower abdomen!

Fresh blood suddenly spurted out, and Zhuo Jing’s face became extremely pale!

“Lord Sima Bei, you... Why are you...”Zhuo Jing said in extreme pain.

Sima bei sneered, “You have already angered me. If I don’t kill you, it will be difficult to dispel the hatred in my heart.”

After that, Sima bei glanced at Qin Yu who was undergoing the tribulation and said indifferently, “You want to stall for time. Do you think I can’t See It?”

“Lord Sima Bei, you’ve misunderstood...”at this moment, Zhuo Jing still had a trace of hope. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, Sima Bei didn’t give him a chance. He put away the Silver Spring and slapped Zhuo Jing’s face.

Zhuo Jing was instantly sent flying. His originally handsome face was now shattered and almost collapsed.

Looking at Zhuo Jing, who was lying on the ground like a dead dog, Sima bei said coldly, “This is the price for making a move on me.”

After saying this, Sima bei looked in the direction of Qin Yu, his body emitting a murderous aura.

“It’s your turn.”Sima bei said coldly.

After saying this, Sima Bei walked towards Qin Yu’s direction.

But at this moment, a force pulled Sima bei!

Looking down, he saw that his body was bound by a chain.

And the other end of the chain was Zhuo Jing!

Sima bei’s expression immediately turned cold. He turned around to look at Zhuo Jing and coldly said, “You don’t know life from Death!”
