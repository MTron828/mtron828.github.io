Chapter 650: The Furious Qin Yu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In the depths of the prison, it was impossible for Qin Yu to save Yan Ruoxue.

In addition, the prison was made entirely of Black Gold Stone and couldn’t be broken.

Therefore, this was perhaps the best opportunity for Qin Yu.

In the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.

Yan Ruxue was hung on the round altar. A tube was inserted into her body, and light surged around her.

Qu Xie stood in the center of the square while quietly waiting for the black-robed man to arrive.

He had arranged for several black-gold robe powerhouses to arrive, including Yan Guiyi.

In order to capture the black-robed man, Qu Xie had spent a lot of money.

“President Qu, they are here,” At this moment, a black-gold-robed man walked to Qu Xie’s side and whispered.

Qu Xie nodded and said, “Let them in.”

Soon, the young masters of the big families walked into the venue one after another.

The leader was Yan Jinyao!

After walking into the square, everyone saw Yan Ruoxue hanging on the round altar.

“Is... is that Miss Yan?” Zhuang Teng couldn’t help but exclaim.

“How did Miss Yan get hung up here?”

Yao Meng’s expression was even more unsightly. She had always been on good terms with Yan Ruoxue. Now that she saw Yan Ruoxue’s miserable state, it was impossible for her not to be upset.

“What does this mean? Why is Miss Yan being hung up here?” Chu Hedao’s tone was somewhat cold as he asked.

Yan Jinyao didn’t feel the slightest bit of embarrassment. He smiled nonchalantly and said, “Everyone, don’t be surprised. All the blood originates from Yan Ruoxue. In other words, they originate from the Yan family.”

When these words were said, everyone turned pale with fright!

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association relied on Yan Ruoxue alone to actually create so many powerhouses?

Just what kind of bloodline did Yan Ruoxue have to be so powerful?

“Young Master Yan, Miss Yan is, after all, a member of the Yan family. By doing this... isn’t the Yan family afraid of embarrassing themselves?” Yao Meng’s tone was unfriendly.

However, Yan Jinyao didn’t care at all. He smiled nonchalantly and said, “Yan Ruoxue has a top-grade bloodline and has never cultivated. If we just leave her like this, wouldn’t it be a waste?”

“But...”

Yao Meng wanted to say something, but was rudely interrupted by Yan Jinyao.

He glanced at Yao Meng and said indifferently, “Why? Doesn’t Miss Yao want this bloodline? Or is there anyone among you who is willing to give up this bloodline?”

For a moment, everyone fell silent.

The strength of this bloodline could be seen with the naked eye.

No one was willing to give up such a temptation.

“Since no one is willing to give up, then there’s no need to say anything more,” Yan Jinyao said nonchalantly.

“Oh, right. Remember, this is the bloodline of the Yan family. The control is in the hands of the Yan family,” Yan Jinyao said deliberately.

His purpose was naturally to make everyone owe the Yan family a favor.

“Okay, please take a seat.” Yan Jinyao strode to the center of the square and sat down.

Looking up at the pale-faced Yan Ruoxue, everyone sighed.

“I really didn’t expect Miss Yan to suffer such hardship after Old Mister Yan’s death,” Zhuang Teng sighed.

“Yes, when Old Mister Yan was still alive, who in Jingdu dared to lay hands on Miss Yan?”

“Back then, the Sun family coveted Miss Yan, and the entire Sun family disappeared from Jingdu.”

Chu Heng, who was at the side, said somewhat awkwardly, “To be honest, back then, Miss Yan and I had a conflict, and later...”

Speaking up to this point, Chu Heng seemed to find it difficult to speak.

He was silent for a moment, then he smiled bitterly. “Later, my father brought a generous gift and went to the Yan family to apologize. Only then did he finally obtain Old Mister Yan’s forgiveness.”

Everyone was discussing animatedly. They couldn’t believe Yan Ruoxue’s current situation.

Yao Meng was the only one who remained silent. Her eyes were looking in Yan Ruoxue’s direction, and there was a conflicted look in her eyes.

After hesitating for a long time, Yao Meng arrived in front of Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue...” Yao Meng looked somewhat sad.

Yan Ruoxue opened her eyes. When she saw Yao Meng, she hurriedly said, “Yao Meng, how is Qin Yu? Qu Xie said that he...”

This question made it difficult for Yao Meng to answer for a moment.

Now that Qin Yu’s death had become an established fact, even if Yao Meng wasn’t willing to admit it, it couldn’t change anything.

“Hurry up and tell me!” Yan Ruoxue urged anxiously.

The kind-hearted Yao Meng was conflicted. In the end, she smiled and said, “Qin Yu is fine. Qu Xie lied to you. Don’t worry.”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue finally heaved a sigh of relief

A rare smile appeared on her pale face.

“Ruoxue, how do you feel now?” Yao Meng looked up at Yan Ruoxue and sighed.

Yan Ruoxue was about to say something when Qu Xie walked over from the side.

“Miss Yao, please return to your seat,” Qu Xie said with a smile.

Yao Meng frowned. She looked up at Yan Ruoxue and couldn’t help but feel sad.

“Please go back,” Qu Xie urged again.

Yao Meng had no choice but to retreat to the side.

Soon, Han Wei arrived at the scene.

With his current strength, he was no longer strong enough to sit with the young masters of the various aristocratic families.

However, Han Meng had found Qu Xie and found a way for him.

Han Wei looked at Yan Ruoxue, who was hanging on the round altar, and a trace of viciousness flashed in his eyes.

He gnashed his teeth and said, “You deserve it! B * tch! If you had married me back then, you wouldn’t have encountered this! You deserve it!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Qu Xie suddenly walked to the round altar and to Yan Ruoxue’s side.

He said indifferently, “Since everyone is here, let’s begin.”

“All the blood comes from Yan Ruoxue, and her blood will be used for the benefit of everyone!”

Qu Xie held the light in his palm, as if he was going to activate some spell.

“Today, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will show everyone how to absorb this blood,” Qu Xie said with a smile.

In the next second, Qu Xie gently waved his palm, and the light immediately landed on Yan Ruoxue’s body.

In an instant, the tube attached to Yan Ruoxue’s body began to activate.

Traces of blood flowed out of Yan Ruoxue’s body.

Yan Ruoxue’s face instantly became extremely pale, and her expression carried a trace of anguish!

“Ruoxue!” Seeing this, Yao Meng unconsciously stood up.

The other aristocratic family members also had ugly expressions. They hadn’t thought that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would actually be so cruel!

As the traces of blood flowed out from the tube, Yan Ruoxue’s face also became increasingly pale.

“Qu Xie, f * ck you!”

At that moment, a loud shout came from outside!

Then, a black figure rushed over!
