1947 Meeting the Prince of Great Xia

Great Xia Palace of great Xia was tremendously grand. It stood out in Sky City and thus was easy to find. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Qin Yu headed straight to the palace.

The tight security that he had imagined did not exist. There were only two guards at the entrance.

The two guards looked rather idle as they were non-stop chatting while standing there.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and sighed in his heart.

It seemed that Great Xia Palace had indeed fallen. There were no signs of royalness at all.

Feeling uneasy, Qin Yu walked to the entrance.

The two guards looked somewhat idle and were chatting non-stop while standing there.

“Don’t tell me you’re looking for protection from Great Xia Palace, are you? I advise you to leave quickly,” one of the guards shook his head and said.

“Of course not!” Qin Yu waved his hand and said. “I just have some doubts, and I would like the Prince of Great Xia to help clarify. I wonder if I…”

“Oh, to see the prince? No problem.” The two guards heaved a sigh of relief.

“Come with me,” one of the guards said.

“It’s that simple?” Qin Yu asked in surprise. “You don’t need to go in to report, do you?”

One of the guards laughed and said, “There’s something you don’t know about the prince. He treats people and things gently. There is no need to report.”

After acknowledging it, Qin Yu did not say anything else.

Following the guard, he entered the Great Xia Palace.

The palace was indeed very grand and luxurious. As soon as he stepped in, he could see several sanctums which seemed to have been left behind by those who had deceased.

Several names were marked in the sanctums. They seemed to be recording the glory of Great Xia.

However, other than these, there was no other demeanor of the royal family. It could not even be compared to a city lord.

The guard brought Qin Yu to a side room. As explained by the guard, this room was the prince’s study room. He would usually read some books here.

“Wait for a while. I’ll go and inform the prince,” the guard said.

Qin Yu bowed slightly and didn’t say anything.

The guard walked in and came out very quickly.

“Alright, you may go in,” the guard said.

“Thank you very much,” Qin Yu bowed.

Following that, Qin Yu walked into the side room.

The side room was smaller than he had imagined. It was like a stable. At this moment, the prince was sitting there reading a book. There were a few bowls of medicine beside him.

“Cough! Cough…” The prince’s familiar coughing sound entered Qin Yu’s ears.

He put down the book in his hand and waved with a smile, “Brother Qin, please take a seat.”

The prince was indeed not putting on airs and was completely different from what he had imagined.

Qin Yu bowed slightly to him and then sat opposite him.

“Your HIghness, Prince of the Grand Xia,” Qin Yu greeted courteously.

The prince waved his hand and smiled. “Prince of Great Xia is just an undeserved reputation now. Brother Qin, you don’t have to be so polite.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He quietly sent out a wisp of his divine sense to scrutinize the prince. He was surprised to discover the prince’s cultivation was not strong. Like Qin Yu, he was only at the Early-stage of the Reversion Return Void.

“Brother Qin, are you here regarding the temple fair yesterday?” The prince initiated to ask.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “It’s just that I don’t know if it’s convenient for you.”

“Go ahead. I’ll definitely tell you everything I know. Cough, cough…” the prince said somewhat weakly.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I want to know about the obsession that conducted the dao lecture yesterday. What was his cultivation when he was alive? Did he enter the Immortal Emperor stage?”

Hearing this, the prince couldn’t help but laugh.

He shook his head and said, “Of course not. The Great Xia Royal Family never had an Immortal Emperor. The obsession you saw yesterday was the last Tribulation Stage cultivator of the Xia family.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this.

As long as he did not step into the Immortal Emperor stage, it would mean his speculation was correct.

When one stepped into the Immortal Emperor stage, it was equivalent to jumping out of the rule, and there was no longer a need to comprehend the universe.

“He once tried to break through to the Immortal Emperor, but he failed in the end,” the prince sighed and said.

“If he had stepped into the Immortal Emperor cultivation realm, the Great Xia Royal Family wouldn’t have fallen to such a state.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. That was true.

If an Immortal Emperor appeared in a family, it could guarantee the family would not decline for many years. Even if it could not maintain the royal family status, it could at least be on par with the nine great aristocratic families instead of being a canary in a cage.

In the entire Holy Region, and even the entire history of cultivation, all sects would decline, but it would take a long time. It was because the resources and bloodline left behind by their ancestors were enough for them to continue to prosper for a long time.

Of course, the Immortal Slaying Sect was an exception. A sect that had once dominated the entire cultivation world had disappeared without a trace in a short time. This was one of the strange tales of the Holy Region.

“Did Your Highness comprehend anything from yesterday’s temple fair?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

The prince shook his head, sighed, and said, “It’s as though our Xia family has been cursed. Our talent in cultivation is extremely low. What can I possibly comprehend?”

He then said in a self-deprecating manner, “I have no other choice but to read books every day. I can only rely on medicine to stay alive. I’m just waiting for death.”

Qin Yu felt somewhat emotional but did not know what to say, so he could only sigh.

“Brother Qin, you have a chaotic body and dare to challenge the Si family. You must have comprehended something,” the prince said.

...

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and told the prince what he thought without reservation.

A trace of surprise appeared on the prince’s face, and then he sighed ad said, “As expected of Brother Qin. Such talent really makes people envious.”

“You’re overpraising me,” Qin Yu said, shaking his head.

Qin Yu suddenly changed the subject and said, “Has Your HIghness ever thought of restoring the Xia family’s previous glory? Are you really willing to let this family decline generation after generation?”

The prince laughed bitterly and said, “I don’t want to either. But I don’t have the talent for cultivation and can’t do anything. If it weren’t for the goodwill of the nine great aristocratic families, the Xia family would have disappeared long ago.

Qin Yu was silent. He scrutinized the palace with his divine sense. It was just as the prince had said, there was not a single expert in the entire palace.

The prince seemed to really be in bad shape.

“If I may ask, what illness are you having?” Qin Yu said.

The prince shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. In any case, all the nine great aristocratic families have sent people to check on my health but no one could do anything.”

Qin Yu was silent for a while, then continued, “Are you born with it?”

“No, that’s not the case.” The prince shook his head and said, “When I was fifteen, my father passed away. I suddenly fell ill and contracted this strange disease since then.”

...

“When you were fifteen?” Qin Yu was a little surprised and couldn’t help pondering.
