Ding Yi continued, “On the contrary, if this thing were in your hands, it would definitely be able to play a greater role, and it would definitely be able to do something for the South Province!”

Hearing Ding Yi’s words, Qin Yu was instantly filled with emotions.

Ding Yi was just an ordinary cultivator who couldn’t be any more ordinary, but her heart was attached to the world. In the cultivation world, this was indeed too rare.

“Okay.”Qin Yu put away the scroll.

“Don’t worry. I Won’t Let You Down,”Qin Yu said firmly.

Ding Yi smiled and said, “Of course I believe you. I have always believed in you.”

Qin Yu nodded and continued, “Don’t act on your own during this period of time. Protect yourself well.”

“Okay, I understand,”Ding Yi agreed.

Then, the two of them planned to leave the ancient well.

But at this moment, Qin Yu sensed something.

He stopped in his tracks and could not help but look at the ancient well behind him.

“Something’s wrong,”Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered softly.

Ding Yi asked in puzzlement, “What’s Wrong?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “This painting is extremely important to the northern lands. It’s impossible that they can’t find this painting... could it be that this ancient well can seal off the internal Qi?”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at Ding Yi and said, “Ding Yi, jump into this well.”

“Ah?”Ding Yi was startled.

Qin Yu said, “I’ll do an experiment.”

Ding Yi didn’t think too much about it. He immediately followed Qin Yu’s request and jumped into the water with a plop.

Qin Yu released his divine sense and tried to find traces of Ding Yi.

As expected, Qin Yu’s divine sense was completely unable to capture the traces of Ding Yi who was hidden in this ancient well.

“As expected...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

“Why is this ancient well able to seal off the internal Qi? Could it be because of the well water?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, he didn’t think too much about it. Now was not the time to think about it.

Ding Yi came out from the ancient well. She wiped the water on her face and said, “Is it done?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Let’s go.”

The two of them left the ancient well. Qin Yu asked Ding Yi to seek refuge in the Tianyun sect for the time being. Then, the two of them parted ways in the city.

That day, Qin Yu arrived at a place where no one was around.

This place was desolate and uninhabited. The surroundings were barren.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground. He took out the scroll and slowly opened it.

There were some extremely complicated characters engraved on the scroll. Other than that, there was also a portrait.

This person’s appearance was extremely fierce and majestic. Although it was just a scroll, it made people feel an urge to worship him.

Qin Yu stared at the person on the scroll and said in a low voice, “Could this person be the lord of the Northern Lands?”

However, Qin Yu quickly recovered.

The power of this scroll was unimaginable. It even surpassed the secret technique that heavenly blood rainbow had used back then.

Clearly, the master of the northern lands didn’t have that ability.

“It’s the first sect master of the immortal slaying sect, and the most powerful sect master in the history of the immortal slaying sect...”at this moment, Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s voice came from the spatial magic artifact.

“The sect master of the immortal slaying sect? No wonder...”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

At this point, Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Do you know how to activate this scroll?”

“I don’t know,”Heavenly Blood Rainbow answered without hesitation. “With my status and status, I’m not qualified to come into contact with this.”

Qin Yu did not say anything more. He tried to probe out a wisp of internal Qi to absorb the painting, but he found that there was no movement from the painting.

Subsequently, Qin Yu tried many other methods, but in the end, he failed.

“It seems that this painting is not of much use in my hands for the time being,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Hence, Qin Yu kept the painting and planned to head to Ying Ning Mountain.

He had issued a challenge to the elementalists and it was time for him to set off.

Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle and immediately headed towards Ying Ning Mountain.

Near Ying Ning Mountain, there was a small city called Ying Ning City.

This place was about a hundred stars away from Ying Ning Mountain. It was not far, but it was definitely not close.

“I’ll rest here for the night,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

There were only two days left before the fight with the elementalists. Qin Yu planned to stay in yingning city for the next two days. He was waiting for the elementalists.

Hence, Qin Yu put away the Divine Hawk and landed in yingning city.

He found a restaurant and ordered a table full of good dishes and a pot of good wine. He planned to enjoy it before the battle.

However, Qin Yu was too famous now. He was recognized not long after he sat down.

“Qin Yu? You are Qin Yu?”

“Ah, it’s me,”Qin Yu said with some embarrassment.

“You Are Really Qin Yu!”After receiving Qin Yu’s affirmative answer, the people around quickly surrounded him.

They surrounded Qin Yu’s table and asked impatiently, “Where have you been all this time? Why haven’t I heard from You?”

“That’s right, the northern lands have massacred quite a few cities! If you are well prepared, you can stay in our yingning city. If It’s our turn, you can help us.”

“Qin Yu, don’t leave. With you around, we have confidence...”

Hearing the surrounding people’s comments, Qin Yu was filled with emotions.

He opened his mouth, but just as he was about to speak, he felt a trace of killing intent approaching.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He opened his desolate divine eyes and looked out for a few stars!

He saw a man in a black robe shooting towards Qin Yu!

“The Godly monarch of the northern lands?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered.

“It seems that they can sense the internal Qi of this painting...”

Qin Yu was not surprised. He poured a glass of wine and waited quietly for the arrival of the godly monarch of the northern lands.

Not long after, the godly monarch walked in through the door.

Upon seeing his attire, everyone in the restaurant turned pale with fright! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s... It’s the people of the northern lands!”

“Finally... It’s finally our yingning city’s turn...”

“Everyone, don’t panic. Qin Yu is here. We will definitely stop him!”

Everyone discussed animatedly, but the godly monarch ignored them.

He walked straight to Qin Yu and sat down. Then, he sneered and said, “What? Are you planning to have a good meal before we set off?”

Qin Yu took a sip of his wine and said indifferently, “Why is it a scumbag like you who is coming? Where are the elementalists?”

The godly monarch was stunned. His expression turned cold as he said coldly, “Do you think you are qualified to issue a challenge to our Lord? Do you have the qualifications to do so?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Why? Are elementalists afraid? Did they send you here to be a scapegoat?”

“Scapegoat? hahahahaha!”The godly monarch could not help but laugh out loud.

“Qin Yu! Have you forgotten how pathetic you were last time? If not for our Lord’s order to summon us back, you would already be a corpse by now!”

“What? After a few days, are you crazy? You actually dare to issue a challenge to our Lord? !”
