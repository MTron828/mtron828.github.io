2170 Heading to the Yao Family

Dean Lei’s expression changed drastically upon hearing this!

What one feared was likely to come true.

He subconsciously looked at Jue Wu beside him. The expression of that cultivator also slightly changed. Looking at Jue Wu in front of him, he appeared extremely awkward.

“What did you say? For whom?” Jue Wu’s brows furrowed tightly.

The cultivator opened his mouth and was about to speak when Dean Lei beat him to it and said, “It’s a newly advanced True Saint. He’s been quite famous recently, but now that an accident has happened, someone has set up a cenotaph for him.”

Realizing thing was wrong, the cultivator hurriedly said, “Yes, yes, yes. He’s a newly advanced True Saint. We’ve wanted to invite him to join Thunder Courtyard.”

Although Jue Wu was simple-minded, she was not stupid. Looking at their expressions, she sensed thing was not right.

“I heard it. You’re talking about Qin Yu.” Jue Wu’s expression was ice-cold.

“You… You heard it wrong. How could anything happen to Qin Yu? He… He’s fine,” the cultivator said unnaturally.

Jue Wu’s expression turned cold. With a shake of her body, she instantly appeared before the cultivator. Then she stretched out her hand and grabbed his neck!

“Do you think I’m a fool?” Jue Wu’s voice became incomparably cold.

“Speak, what’s going on? If you dare to lie, I will break your neck!”

The cultivator’s face was pale, and he almost could not breathe. He hesitated for a moment and finally could not bear the pressure of Jue Wu. He said, “Yes, Qin Yu was attacked on the journey in the starry sky and unfortunately died.”

When Jue Wu heard this, she seemed to have been hit by a heavy blow. She let go of the cultivator and stepped back. A trace of despair and pain flashed in her eyes.

But very quickly, Jue Wu laughed out loud and said, “How is that possible? Are you guys talking nonsense to me? Why would Qin Yu go to the starry sky? How could anything happen to him? Hahaha!”

Dean Lei knew he could no longer hide the matter, so he said in a deep voice, “Something untoward did happen to Qin Yu, and he was sent into the void. But… but he might not be dead.”

Jue Wu stood in a daze, not saying a word for a long time.

The next second, she suddenly said with a sobbing tone, “Being knocked into the void, there’s no way out… boohoo…”

After saying that, Jue Wu squatted on the ground like a little girl and burst into tears.

Tears flowed from her eyes, and despair and endless grief filled her cries.

Dean Lei did not expect Jue Wu to have such a reaction. He opened his mouth and was about to speak when Jue Wu’s expression changed again.

She looked coldly at Dean Lei and said, “Who did it?”

“Jue Wu, this matter is of great importance. You…”

“I’m asking you who did it!” Jue Wu was furious. The internal qi on his body suddenly erupted. For a moment, the entire Thunder Courtyard was trembling!

Dean Lei had no choice but to tell Jue Wu what had happened.

After hearing this, Jue Wu did not say anything. She laughed and said, “Qin Yu is lucky. He won’t die. He definitely can walk out of the void. He will definitely be fine!”

“That’s right.” Dean Lei hurriedly nodded.

At this point, Dean Lei gestured for the cultivator to leave. Then, he whispered, “To tell you the truth, there’s a master behind Qin Yu. Even if he can’t walk out, that master will help him.”

“Really?” Jue Wu widened her eyes and wiped away her tears as she asked innocently.

“Of course!” Dean Lei nodded and said. “However, for various reasons, I can’t tell you the identity of that master for the time being.”

“Oh, as long as he’s fine.” Jue Wu nodded. Then, she sighed and said, “D*mn it, it’s a pity I can’t drink with him. You drink with me then. I want good wine. I heard that Immortal Emperor Lei once left two jars of fine wine.”

Dean Lei heaved a sigh of relief. A jug of wine was nothing as long as he could stabilize Jue Wu

Therefore, Dean Lei waved his hand and said, “Alright, I’ll drink together as much as you wish!”

When Jue Wu heard Dean Lei’s words, her eyes lit up, and her face was full of smiles. She patted Dean Lei’s shoulder and said excitedly, “Old man, don’t regret it. I’m going to make you drunk!”

That night, Jue Wu got herself drunk. The next day, Jue Wu chose to go into retreat.

It was unsure if it was due to the wine or Jue Wu’s talent, but in just eight days, Jue Wu had stepped into the True Saint Realm.

After entering the True Saint Realm, Jue Wu did not leave Thunder Courtyard. Instead, she drank and enjoyed herself with Dean Lei, getting drunk every day.

It went on like this until the night of the fifth day.

Jue Wu stole Thunder Courtyard’s magical artifact and left Thunderous Courtyard, taking advantage of nighttime.

Her expression turned incomparably cold, and killing intent filled her.

Jue Wu was not in a hurry to go to the Yao family. Instead, she first arrived near Qin Yu’s cenotaph.

Just as she was about to pay her respects, she saw a young man standing near the cenotaph.

This young man was handsome and had an extraordinary temperament. There was determination and indifference between his brows, and his eyes were deep and sharp as if he could see through everything.

This person was none other than Si Shiyue!

Si Shiyue stood before Qin Yu’s cenotaph without saying a word.

After a long time, Si Shiyue said slowly, “Speaking of which, I’ve always wanted to fight you. I can’t prove that I, Si Shiyue, am the number one chaotic body if you die.”

A hint of reluctance and regret was in his tone. In the end, Si Shiyue sat beside the cenotaph and left slowly after a long time.

“He actually came.” Jue Wu’s expression was ice-cold, and she had a slight intention to attack.

But after a while, Jue Wu finally gave up.

She came forth to the cenotaph and looked at the two words “Qin Yu” carved on the tombstone. Her eyes could not help but become misty.

“Didn’t they say a rascal would last a thousand years? How could you die just like that?”Jue Wu murmured. She sat in front of the grave and whispered about the past. From time to time, she would laugh loudly and cry continuously.

Her heart seemed to have torn apart, and endless pain surged. A wave of grief kept attacking deep down. Memories surged in her mind. She remembered the moment she met Qin Yu. That sunny, enthusiastic, cheerful, and determined young man.

“I believe nothing will happen to you,” Jue Wu said softly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She stood up slowly, looked into the distance, and said coldly, “Don’t worry. I’ll avenge you now. I’ll kill them all and make them die with you!

“And that Si Shiyue, I’ll help you get rid of him too!

“I’ll help you look after the saintess of the Yan family and wait for your return.”

With that, Jue Wu turned into a stream of light and disappeared without a trace in an instant.

Her destination was the Yao family.
