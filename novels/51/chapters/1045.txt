Chapter 1046: Chapter 1,046, Immortal Crane’s selfishness 

Immortal Crane’s gaze made Qin Yu feel rather strange.

He clutched his chest and put on a terrified expression.

Immortal Crane smiled and stood up. “I’ve also heard of the second secret realm, one of the rulers of the martial arts association of Jingdu.”

Qin Yu said with a shocked expression, “You’ve actually heard of the martial arts association of Jingdu While You’re here?”

“Is it very strange?”Immortal Crane raised its eyebrows.

“I know more things than you can imagine.”

Qin Yu hurriedly sat up from the jade bed and said, “What else do you know? I just happen to have a lot of questions.”

Immortal Crane opened its mouth and was about to speak when Uncle Niu walked in from outside.

“Lord Immortal Crane, the food is ready,”said Niu.

The immortal crane nodded slightly and said with a smile, “Let’s go eat first. I’ll Welcome You.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to ask more questions when he was interrupted by the immortal crane with a wave of its hand.

Helpless, he had no choice but to follow the immortal crane out of the grotto-heaven.

The party arrived at the restaurant of the demon city. At that moment, the table was already filled with delicacies.

Besides Uncle Niu, there were two men and a woman sitting there.

The men were all thick and strong, and they were about the same size as Uncle Niu.

As for the woman, she was rather charming. She had a slim and fat body, and she was quite beautiful.

Qin Yu followed beside the immortal crane and sat down. Then,. Uncle Niu stood up and introduced them one by one.

After the introduction, he learned that these people were all the immortal crane’s confidants, and each of them had already stepped into the martial saint realm.

Their names were Su Yi, Gong Zhuang, and Wu Haichen.

Qin Yu stood up and greeted them one by one before he sat down.

“Eat, see if the food suits your taste,”immortal crane said faintly.

How Could Qin Yu have the mood to eat? He had a lot of things on his mind that he wanted to talk about, but every time, he was interrupted by immortal crane with a wave of its hand.

Qin Yu, who was burning with anxiety, could only obediently drink and have fun with them.

After three rounds of drinking.., wu Haicheng said, “Qin Yu, since you’re here, you can stay here. Although our place isn’t considered a paradise, it’s still a place where no one dares to mess with. If you stay here, you’ll have nothing to worry about for the rest of your life.”

Gong Zhuang nodded slightly and said, “Mm, it’s a strange thing that you can enter our demon city as a human.”

Su Yi Winked at Qin Yu and said, “Lord Immortal Crane has a high opinion of you. You will definitely have a place in the demon city in the future.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “If there’s an opportunity in the future, I will definitely come and settle down here.”

Su Yi rolled her eyes and said, “Aren’t you being too polite?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. He wanted to live such a leisurely life, but reality forced him to move forward and did not dare to stay a single step.

“Alright.”At that moment, immortal crane raised its finger and tapped the table. Everyone immediately fell silent.

Immortal Crane glanced at Qin Yu and then swept its gaze at everyone. It said calmly, “Qin Yu wants us to leave the demon city and accompany him to attack the second mystic realm. Do any of you have any objections?”

Upon hearing that, the faces of Su Yi and the rest, who were still full of enthusiasm just a moment ago, instantly turned cold.

Uncle Niu’s chopsticks, which he had stretched out, quickly retracted back.

The atmosphere fell into an awkward state. The attitude of Su Yi and the others also turned cold.

“We don’t want to get involved in your matters,”Su Yi said first.

“That’s right. Once we enter the human realm, we won’t be able to return to this kind of stable life,”Gong Zhuang said.

Although Uncle Niu didn’t say anything, his meaning was also obvious.

Immortal Crane glanced at Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, as you can see, no one agrees.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only sigh slightly.

He raised his wine cup, cupped his hands, and said, “Let’s just drink and have fun, and pretend that I didn’t say anything else.”

With that, Qin Yu emptied the wine in his hand.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the atmosphere eased up slightly.

The fine wine here was different from ordinary wine. Normally, with their cultivation, they would not get drunk no matter how much they drank.

However, after drinking to their heart’s content, everyone’s eyes became a little blurry, and they started drinking and talking.

The few of them drank from day to night until the Moon was bright and the stars were sparse.

Qin Yu was so drunk that he lay unconscious on the dining table.

Immortal Crane glanced at Qin Yu and then looked at Gong Zhuang and the others.

“Sir Immortal Crane, come, let me toast you!”Wu Haichen said excitedly.

However, immortal crane changed the topic and said, “Perhaps we should discuss this matter.”

Upon hearing this, most of the people immediately sobered up.

Wu Haicheng quickly withdrew his hand and sat up straight.

Immortal Crane glanced at the crowd and said indifferently, “What do you all think about attacking the second mystic realm?”

“Lord Immortal Crane, didn’t we say just now? Once we leave the demon city, it won’t be so easy to come back.”Uncle Niu said with a frown.

“That’s right. We have been in the demon city for many years. How could we bear to leave?”

“Moreover, we demon beasts and humans are not on good terms. If we get involved, it will be difficult to find a pure land. At that time, a great war might break out.”

Everyone’s words were naturally very reasonable, and immortal crane was very clear about it.

But at that moment, he shook his head slightly.

Seeing this, everyone’s faces changed immediately.

“Lord Immortal Crane, are you really going to help this kid? Although he has some friendship with you, it hasn’t reached this level yet, has it?”

“Are you going to give up the demon city for him? In all these years, we have never stepped out of the Demon City!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Immortal Crane glanced at them and shook its head. “It’s not just for him. I have my own selfish motives.”

“Selfish motives?”

The few of them looked at each other with doubt in their eyes.

Then, they looked at immortal crane and waited for its next words.
