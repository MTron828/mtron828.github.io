1814 The Yan Family Gathering

Qin Yu had just arrived at Zhongzhou and knew nothing about this. He asked immediately, “Then may I ask how I can get to the Yan family?”

“It’s impossible to go to the Yan family by foot. You can go to the nearby relay station. It will be much faster that way,” the stall owner said with a smile.

Then, he looked Qin Yu up and down and said, “You just arrived in Zhongzhou, right?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded. “Bro, may I ask where the relay station is?”

“Well, it’s not easy to find one, and the price is very high,” the stall owner continued.

“How high?” Qin Yu frowned.

“It’ll cost at least one billion spirit coins to get to the Yan family!” The stall owner said after some thought.

Qin Yu’s expression changed.

One billion!

Damn, Qin Yu didn’t have time to make money lately. He could afford it if it was five hundred million but not one billion.

“What about the Si family?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

“Oh, the Si family is closer. I think it’ll be around 500 million,” the stall owner answered.

He asked, “Do you know people from the two families?”

“Yes, I know some of them,” Qin Yu lied.

“Then why don’t you attend the grand event held by the two families? In three days, they will be holding a grand event on Mont Taihua. It’s much cheaper to go to Mount Taihua, and 500 million spirit coins is enough!” The stall owner said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed.

A grand event? Could it be the engagement between the despicable Si Shiyue and Yan Ruoxue?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Bro, please tell me where the nearest relay station is!”

The stall owner smiled. “I told you, you won’t be able to find it without a guide. How about this? I’ll go with you, but you’ll have to pay me.”

“That’s great! Many thanks, bro!” Qin Yu hurriedly nodded.

So, the stall owner put away the goods and took Qin Yu to the nearby relay station.

On the way, Qin Yu felt extremely uneasy. He took the opportunity to ask, “Bro, do you know why they are holding this grand event?”

“Don’t you know them? if you don’t know, how would I know?” The stall owner muttered. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, feeling even more uneasy.

After walking for a long time, turning left and right, they finally arrived at the so-called relay station.

To put it bluntly, this relay station was just a huge array platform. Through this array platform, one could go to many places.

“This is it. Give me the money and I’ll help you pay the fee,” the stall owner said.

“I’d better go with you,” Qin Yu said with vigilance.

“No, this relay station is only open to the local people. You can wait for me outside,” the stall owner said.

Qin Yu was wary. He squinted his eyes slightly, but in the end, he still gave the money to him.

The stall owner took the card and walked into the station.

The moment he entered, Qin Yu immediately activated the desolate divine eye and watched the stall owner.

The stall owner entered the station and walked deeper with the card in his hand.

However, this b*stard didn’t go to the counter to do the so-called procedures at all. He just walked around inside and then walked out from the back door.

“Damn it, he’s a fraud!” Qin Yu cursed.

He immediately used the line word formula and quickly chased after the stall owner!

The stall owner began to run as soon as he stepped out of the door of the station. However, Qin Yu grabbed his neck from behind.

“You dare to lie to me?” Qin Yu lifted him into the air, and the stall owner couldn’t move at all!

The stall owner turned pale with fright! Even though he was not very powerful, he was a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator!

However, facing Qin Yu, he felt like he was facing a huge mountain. He could not even think of resisting!

“Friend… My friend, I’ll return the money to you…” The stall owner was scared. He began to think maybe Qin Yu indeed had some relationship with the two aristocratic families!

Qin Yu took back the card from his hand and said coldly, “Do you think you’ll be fine after returning the money to me?”

The stall owner regretted what he had done. He had thought that Qin Yu was a silly country bumpkin boy, but the boy turned out to be a tough guy.

“Then what do you want?” The stall owner said helplessly.

“What you said to me just now, was it true?” Qin Yu asked in a cold voice.

The stall owner hurriedly said, “It’s all true! There’s not a single lie!”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, ” “Take me to the relay station and help me to Mont Taihua.”

“Sure, sure, no problem,” the stall owner said.

Then, the stall owner led Qin Yu into the relay station again.

The stall owner’s words that it’s only open to local people were indeed false. After paying, Qin Yu walked into the platform.

To activate this platform, a large amount of materials were needed. These materials were called teleportation stones. It was said that teleportation stones were extremely rare and could not be regenerated, so they were particularly precious.

Most of the teleportation stone mines in the world were in the hands of the great aristocratic families, which was in fact monopoly.

This situation was rather similar to Earth’s.

Qin Yu waited quietly in the teleportation formation.

The platform wouldn’t be activated if there were less than eight customers.

As time passed by, people arrived one after another.

These people were all dressed in extraordinary clothes, and their auras were quite terrifying. They were obviously not ordinary people.

Qin Yu looked at a man nearby and asked, “Bro, are you also going to Mount Taihua?”

“Right.” The man seemed to be a little proud.

Qin Yu said immediately, “Me too. I’ve put in a lot of effort to attend the Yan and Ying families’ grand event.”

The man’s attitude changed drastically when he heard that.

He said with some respect, “Sir, are you also going to this event? May I know where you are from?”

“I can’t say. But I have some friendship with Si Shiyue. He used to call me big brother,” Qin Yu lied.

“Oh, even the young master called you big brother? May I know your name?” The man’s attitude became more respectful.

“You don’t need to know my name, ” Qin Yu said after some thought. “People call me Shi Yuedie.”

“Shi Yuedie?” The man frowned at the unfamiliar name.

“That’s right, it’s Shi Yuedie. You must remember that my relationship with Si Shiyue is not ordinary,” Qin Yu continued.

“It’s an honor to meet such an important guest like you, ” the man said respectfully. “It took me great efforts to gain an invitation to this event.”

Qin Yu was silent.

As expected, an invitation was needed to participate in this event.

“Looks like I’ll have to trick you into giving me the invitation,” Qin Yu muttered to himself.
