2253 Ming Yue’s Method

Even some surrounding cultivators could not bear to look at that tragic sight.

“How did this kid offend the Palace Master of Azure Firmament Sect? This method is simply cruel!”

“That’s right. The Palace Master is a soul cultivator, so this method is countless times more terrifying than physical torture.”

“Kneel and kowtow to my disciple who died. Perhaps my heart will soften and let you die a quick death.”

Ming Yue threw a plaque to Qin Yu. The name on it was Ouyang Tina.

“Is that all you have?”

Qin Yu spat on the plaque.

The elderly woman’s expression changed drastically. “Today, if I don’t let you taste the Azure Firmament Sect’s Eighteen Punishments of Soul Cultivation, you won’t feel regret!”

“He actually killed Ming Yue’s favorite disciple. No wonder this old lady was furious.”

“Young people are impulsive. So what if you show off for a moment? You lost a divine artifact and your life.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The surrounding cultivators discussed animatedly.

“Old hag, do you think you have everything under your control today?”

Qin Yu sneered and said.

“What do you mean?”

Ming Yue suddenly felt a hidden message in Qin Yu’s words.

“Old hag, even if I die, you can forget about getting Suo Lin’s divine artifact!”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and fell backward. Before anyone could react, he had already jumped into the boiling lava. And the glove had returned to his left hand with a thought.

Master Suo Lin refined Qin Yu’s soul together when refining the divine artifact.

He thus could take it back with a thought. He only threw it to Ming Yue, hoping it would stir up a dispute and give him a chance.

Qin Yu’s figure disappeared into the lava, leaving behind a group of people who were stunned.

Ming Yue realized the divine artifact had returned to Qin Yu’s hand and let out a shrill cry. With a wave of her hand, a sharp force slapped the lava, but it only caused some fireballs. There was no more movement.

“Seal this place! Don’t even allow a fly to fly out!”

Ming Yue roared wildly.

Her sect’s Soul-hunting Bell had also been refined into the divine artifact, and she had even paid two Mystic Realms and a supreme treasure, the Immortal Binding Rope. Unexpectedly, it was all in vain.

“Palace Master Ming Yue, this lava is at the center of the Fire Unicorn Continent, and its temperature is tremendously high. Even a peak True Saint can’t escape if he falls into it, let alone a heavily injured third-grade True Saint.”

Shui Yuan pretended to comfort her but did not leave.

Earlier, many people saw that Qin Yu had used the lava in the center, but many still harbored a lucky mindset.

Perhaps after Qin Yu died, the divine artifact would fly out automatically.

“Shut up!”

Ming Yue said coldly, and the light in her eyes was like a poisonous snake that wanted to devour someone.

Shui Yuan was a little unhappy but did not say anything else. He understood how the old lady felt when she was about to go crazy.

Qin Yu’s mind went blank, and a feeling of powerlessness filled his body.

He had already given it his all, but this was the outcome.

That feeling was similar to the fear of being unable to master himself when he left the Holy Region.

He kept sinking, not only his body but also his soul.

Yan Ruoxue’s heart started beating rapidly, and her face suddenly turned pale.

At this moment, she suddenly felt an inexplicable panic as if she had lost something important.

“Qin Yu, if you’re no longer around, I’ll definitely accompany you.”

Yan Ruoxue gently closed her trembling eyes, and bean-sized tears fell from the corners of her eyes. She had never felt this way before.

A terrifying thought appeared in her mind, and she dared not think further.

A middle-aged man beside her shook his head. Yan Ruoxue might go berserk if she continued to cultivate in this state.

“Miss Yan, the descent of the Great Dao this time has given the cultivators of this era a chance to break through to the True Saint Realm. Moreover, the Great Dao has not been completed yet, and the Dao of Tribulation Transcending may descend in the upcoming time.”

“What does this have to do with me? If Qin Yu isn’t here, what’s the use of me achieving Tribulation Transcending?”

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes reddened.

“The descent of the Great Dao also means the beginning of a chaotic world. A cultivator passing the Tribulation Transcending means endless resources. Therefore, you have to understand that you no longer belong to you. The nine great aristocratic families are the nine great aristocratic families because of their ruthless rules.”

Yan Ruoxue frowned and said, “I can’t make the decision even if I want to follow Qin Yu?”

“All the aristocratic families are now looking for a way to break through the last step. The bloodline union between you and the Si family is most likely the way to break through. Si Shiyue has already comprehended the Way of Five Elements and has been acknowledged by the family head and the patriarch behind him.”

Uncle Yan sighed.

“Even if you die, your bloodline will still be fused with the Si family. Will you allow this to happen?”

Yan Ruoxue’s face was ashen. She thought of a terrifying truth from Uncle Yan’s words.

Even if she wanted to commit suicide, she might not be able to do so. The Holy Region had always been the biggest beneficiary of the Path of Heaven in this galaxy. The nine great aristocratic families had existed for tens of thousands of years because of these cold and realistic rules.

Yan Ruoxue’s expression changed slightly. Seeing that it was about time, Uncle Yan continued.

“Miss Yan, I don’t think Qin Yu will die so easily. If you give up, then you won’t have another chance. Your strength is the key to determining how long you can delay.”

“Uncle Yan, I understand! I won’t give up, and I believe Qin Yu won’t give up too!”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression was no longer shaken.

At this moment, in the Fire Unicorn Continent.

Nangong Qi had captured Wang Feng and Old Huai.

When they were retreating, Nangong Qi noticed them, and the man with the mustache reacted and fled.

Wang Feng and Elder Guai were too weak and could not escape the pursuit of Nangong Qi and the others.

“Well, if you don’t come out for a day, I’ll let these two taste my Azure Firmament Sect’s soul torture!”

Ming Yue’s vicious voice enveloped the entire lava.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s skeleton began to melt. His gloves propped up a small space. The inner core of the fire unicorn slapped most of the fire poison out of space. Otherwise, Qin Yu might have turned into ashes when he jumped into the lava.

However, the intense heat began to corrode his body at this moment.

At this moment, countless golden butterflies caressed his soul in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. He felt he had returned to the embrace of his parents when he was young.

“Qin Yu, my son…”

A familiar voice called out to Qin Yu.

“Father, is that you?”

“Yes, it’s me…”

“Father, I’m so tired…”

“I’m sorry, son. I originally wanted you to be an ordinary person for the rest of your life. I didn’t want you to step onto the path of cultivation.”
