Chapter 328: Why Don’t I Know You? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When Qian Yiming heard this, he laughed and said, “It’s not time yet? It’s already 10 o’clock at night. Why? Are they coming after midnight?”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to lower himself to Qian Yiming’s level, so he didn’t say anything.

Then, more people came to the hotel one after another.

These people were all dressed luxuriously and had high statuses.

And almost all of them came for Qian Yiming.

“Mr. Qian, I’m from Sanhe Real Estate. I brought you a little gift. You must accept it.”

“Mr. Qian, I’m from the Jiaoyun Construction Team. I’ll have to rely on you to take care of me after the New Year.”

“Mr. Qian...”

So many people came to pay New Year’s greetings, which made Qian Yiming even more proud.

“Yiming, you’re really capable. So many bosses came to pay New Year’s greetings to you!” Qian Yiming’s relatives couldn’t help but praise him.

“Yeah, Yiming is the most capable person in our family!”

“Xiao Shuang, you really found a good husband!”

When he heard everyone’s praise, Qian Yiming smiled nonchalantly and said, “They are just small bosses not worth mentioning. We plan to work with Jiang Gu after the New Year.”

“Jiang Gu? Who is he?” Someone asked.

Updates by

Qian Yiming smiled and said, “Jiang Gu is a big shot in the provincial capital. It isn’t an exaggeration to say that he is the richest man in Chuzhou.”

Qian Yiming wasn’t a martial artist, so he didn’t know anything about Jiang Gu’s strength. He only knew that he was very rich.

“Yiming, you’re too amazing. You can actually cooperate with the richest man in Chuzhou?”

“I believe that it won’t be long before Yiming surpasses Jiang Gu!”

Qian Yiming chuckled and said, “I won’t dare to say that, but Jiang Gu and I can be considered old acquaintances. He even planned to come and pay a New Year visit to me, but I rejected him.”

When he heard Qian Yiming’s bragging, Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Qin Yu had never heard of Yiming Real Estate. In the provincial capital, it couldn’t even be considered second-rate.

Cooperating with Jiang Gu? Qin Yu suspected that Qian Yiming had never seen Jiang Gu before.

Qian Yiming glared at Qin Yu and scolded, “What are you laughing at? Is it funny?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I’m sorry, I really couldn’t hold it in.”

Qian Yiming snorted and said, “Where are the people who will wish you a happy New Year? Why aren’t they here yet?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “They are all in the provincial capital. It will probably take some time for them to come over.”

Qian Yiming couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “You mean that someone from the provincial capital will come to wish you a happy New Year? It can’t be your security guard colleagues, can it?”

The people at the table couldn’t help but snicker.

Qin Yu didn’t mind. In his eyes, Qian Yiming wasn’t worth mentioning.

At this moment, Lei Hu suddenly appeared at the entrance of the hotel.

He stood at the door and glanced around. Soon, he found Qin Yu.

Then, Lei Hu carried the gift and ran over.

“Mr. Qin, why didn’t you tell me you were back? It wasn’t easy for me to find you.” Lei Hu wiped the sweat on his forehead and said.

“This is a small gift for you. It’s a hundred-year-old herb!”

Qin Yu sniffed it. It really was a hundred-year-old herb.

“Lei Hu, how thoughtful of you.” Qin Yu took the gift box and said.

Qian Yiming, who was standing at the side, sized up Lei Hu and asked casually, “Who is this person? Is he also a security guard?”

Qian Yiming’s wife quickly tugged at the corner of his shirt and whispered, “This is a big shot from the underworld of Jiangcheng. You can’t mess with him!”

However, Qian Yiming didn’t care at all.

He sneered and said, “So he’s a low-level hooligan.”

Lei Hu’s expression immediately changed.

He said with some displeasure, “Mr. Qin, who is this person? Your friend?”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “He is the boss of a big company in the provincial capital. We can’t afford to offend him.”

Lei Hu didn’t understand the situation for a moment, so he didn’t dare to get angry.

Qian Yiming sneered and said, “Mr. Qin? After waiting for a long time, only a hooligan came to greet you? That’s all you’ve got?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to say something when a few people with gifts suddenly appeared at the door.

They hurried to Qin Yu and said respectfully, “Mr. Qin, we have finally found you!”

Qin Yu looked at these people and found them unfamiliar.

“Mr. Qin, I’m Xiao Hu from the provincial capital’s Deli Group. I’ve been wanting to visit you, but I was afraid you wouldn’t have the time.”

“I’m Wang Kai, from the provincial capital’s Jinfu Technology. You can call me Xiao Wang.”

“Mr. Qin, I’m Xiao Sun from the Runjie Group. I’m here to pay you a New Year’s greeting.”

When he heard these people’s self-introductions, Qian Yiming’s expression changed slightly.

He had heard of these companies. They were all top-tier companies in the provincial capital!

“Mr. Qin, I’m Qi Sheng’s secretary. He really can’t get away, so he asked me to come and greet you on his behalf,” At this time, a young man in a Chinese tunic suit said respectfully.

Qian Yiming’s expression instantly became even uglier!

Qi Sheng’s secretary? He actually came to pay New Year greetings to Qin Yu? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Impossible! Absolutely impossible! It must be an actor that this kid found, Qian Yiming thought to himself.

Before Qian Yiming could speak, Jiang Gu also appeared at the door.

He walked in front of Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, why don’t you stay in the provincial capital for the New Year? A lot of people miss you.”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “Jiangcheng is my hometown after all.”

At this point, Qin Yu pointed at Qian Yiming and asked casually, “This kid said he wants to cooperate with you. Do you know him?”

Jiang Gu looked at Qian Yiming and frowned. “Who are you?”

Qian Yiming said impatiently, “I want to ask who you are!”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “Don’t you want to cooperate with Jiang Gu? He is here, but you don’t know him?”
