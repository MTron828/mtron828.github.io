Chapter 842: Betrayal! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Two Martial Saints blocked Qin Yu’s path.

The oppressive aura emanating from their bodies caused one’s entire body to tremble.

Qin Yu furrowed his brows tightly. He stood up from the ground and looked coldly at Wan Guqiong as he said, “You can’t wait anymore?”

Wan Guqiong laughed loudly and said, “I’ve already let you live for an entire day. You should be thanking me.”

“Qin Yu, I can still give you a chance now. Hand over Yan Ruoxue and I’ll let you go.” Wan Guqiong said.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Do you think it’s possible?”

Wan Guqiong’s expression darkened and he said coldly, “Then don’t blame me for being rude. I’ll slowly search for her after I’ve killed you!”

Then, Wan Guqiong took a step back and waved his hand, indicating for the two Martial Saints to make a move.

“Stop!”

At this moment, Yao Meng ran over in a hurry.

She pulled Wan Guqiong and said with a frown, “Wan Guqiong, even if Qin Yu doesn’t agree with you, you wouldn’t kill him, right?”

Wan Guqiong glanced at Yao Meng and said, “Yao Meng, there’s nothing for you to do here. Get out of the way.”

Yao Meng said with a cold look, “I won’t allow you to make a move against Qin Yu.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Wan Guqiong’s expression instantly turned extremely cold.

“You’ve only known Qin Yu for a few days. Why? Are you going to fall out with me because of him now?” Wan Guqiong berated.

Yao Meng shook her head and said, “I’m not doing it for him. I’m doing it for Yan Ruoxue.”

“I realized it now. The reason why you approached me back then was because of Yan Ruoxue, right?”

Wan Guqiong was stunned for a moment, then he laughed out loud. “That’s right! To tell you the truth, I’ve known about Yan Ruoxue’s special bloodline many years ago!”

“Since you’ve discovered it, I might as well tell you everything!”

“The first person I targeted was Yan Ruoxue!”

“I once tried to woo Yan Ruoxue and wanted to use this method to bring her to the Wan family, but I didn’t expect that she, Yan Ruoxue, didn’t fall for it at all! Instead, she gave me a hard time!”

Speaking up to this point, Wan Guqiong’s face was full of anger.

He gnashed his teeth and said, “I, Wan Guqiong, have status and looks, but I was belittled by her, Yan Ruoxue, to the point of being worthless. She made me feel embarrassed! I will always remember this!”

As soon as these words came out, Yao Meng was instantly dumbfounded.

She never thought that Wan Guqiong actually tried to woo Yan Ruoxue!

“I didn’t expect that Yan Ruoxue, who is known as an ice beauty, would fall in love with an unknown village boy. Hahaha!”

Wan Guqiong was so angry that he laughed and his voice was deafening.

Wan Guqiong took a deep breath and sneered. “Of course, I don’t really love her. It’s just for her bloodline.”

“If I wasn’t afraid of Emperor Yan, I would have taken her back to the Mystic Realm!”

“It’s also because of this that I slowly approached you and tried to win your trust so that I could take Yan Ruoxue away...”

Yao Meng’s expression was extremely unsightly. She glared at Wan Guqiong angrily and berated, “You’re really a despicable person!”

Wan Guqiong snorted coldly and said, “Women are foolish. You guys only think about romance.”

“Those who achieve great things don’t care about that sort of thing!”

Saying this, Wan Guqiong looked coldly at Yao Meng and said, “Yao Meng, get out of the way immediately. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Yao Meng’s internal qi was also rapidly rising.

She looked coldly at Wan Guqiong and said, “You can try!”

“You’re courting death!” Wan Guqiong was instantly furious. He immediately stretched out his hand and grabbed towards Yao Meng!

Yao Meng wasn’t afraid at all. She raised her hand.

“Boom!”

A loud sound immediately spread out!

That terrifying force spread out in all directions like water ripples with the two of them as the center!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!!”

In the next second, Wan Guqiong took a few steps back and spat out a mouthful of blood!

Yao Meng, on the other hand, didn’t move at all. Her pretty face was filled with coldness.

Wan Guqiong’s expression changed. He gritted his teeth and said, “Yao Meng, you actually dared to hurt me! Do you really think I don’t dare to kill you?!”

“Do you think you’re my match?” Yao Meng wasn’t afraid at all.

Wan Guqiong’s face flushed red and he was actually speechless for a moment.

Qin Yu, who was at the side, couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.

Although the two of them had only exchanged a single move, the difference in strength between them was extremely obvious.

Yao Meng’s strength was most likely not weaker than Yan Jinyao!

“Both of you, attack immediately and kill Qin Yu!” Wan Guqiong looked at the two Martial Saints.

The two of them immediately nodded and walked towards Qin Yu with large strides.

In front of the Martial Saints, not to mention Yao Meng, even Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to retaliate at all!

The Martial Saint raised his hand and a wave of terrifying internal qi immediately rushed towards Yao Meng!

Yao Meng attempted to attack, but she realized that her body seemed to have been frozen and she couldn’t move!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and roared furiously. He raised his golden fist in an instant!

Green veins popped up on Qin Yu’s forehead as he roared furiously. His fierce fist carried an undefeatable stance as it smashed forward in a mighty manner!

However, the expected collision didn’t happen! That Martial Saint only raised his hand and Qin Yu’s strength was immediately dissipated!

“You don’t know your place.” One of the Martial Saints snorted coldly. He waved his large hand and the enormous force sent Qin Yu flying!

With just a casual palm strike, Qin Yu’s many hands and bones were shattered! His internal organs were also impacted!

Qin Yu crawled up from the ground. He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said in a low voice, “As expected of a Martial Saint. We aren’t on the same level at all...”

Even with the power of a Martial Saint, Qin Yu was completely no match for him!

No wonder the Guardian didn’t allow the Martial Saint to appear! With their strength, they were probably able to withstand weapons!

“Kid, it’s time for you to die.” Wan Guqiong said viciously.

That Martial Saint walked towards Qin Yu and raised his palm lightly.

Just as his palm was about to strike Qin Yu’s body, a voice suddenly sounded!

“Stop!”

After a stern shout, Le Xian walked over quickly.

There were also two Martial Saints beside him!

When Wan Guqiong saw Le Xian, he immediately frowned.

“Uncle Le? What do you mean?” Wan Guqiong frowned and asked.

Le Xian smiled faintly and said, “Guqiong, let’s call it a day.”

“Call it a day? Uncle Le, are you mistaken?” Wan Guqiong said with a cold look.

Le Xian smiled and said, “I invited Qin Yu here. Of course, I have to take responsibility for his safety. Guqiong, you understand.”

Wan Guqiong’s pupils shrunk and he said with a cold look, “Uncle Le, have you forgotten our agreement? I asked you to lure him here to kill him!”
