2138 The Clash Between Two Races

Arrogant! He was too arrogant! In this world, no one dared to say such things to Si Liuhe, and no one dared to treat the Si family like this!

Xiao Sheng actually dared to threaten the Si family? He even claimed he wanted the entire Si family to be buried with his brother! This was indeed disrespecting the Si family!

“Is this Xiao Sheng crazy? That’s the Si family, one of the nine great aristocratic families!”

“The Si family has a terrifying foundation. Who in the world has the confidence to challenge the Si family?”

“Xiao Sheng is courting death!”

Although Xiao Sheng’s words were shocking, everyone knew the Si family’s foundation was not so easily challenged.

Si Liuhe narrowed his eyes and looked at Xiao Sheng with a cold smile.

“Buried with him? Ha, I’m looking forward to seeing you have that ability!” Si Liuhe said coldly, his tone full of provocation.

Xiao Sheng was indifferent to Si Liuhe’s mockery. There was only coldness and killing intent in his eyes.

Qin Yu, standing not far away, felt a myriad of emotions in his heart. Xiao Sheng and Xiao Hai walked completely different paths and hardly crossed paths. But Xiao Sheng’s attitude now was enough to show how much he valued this younger brother.

“As a human, you joined the demon race. It’s really shameful.” At this moment, another person stood up.

An elderly man stood with his hands behind his back. He had an incredible internal qi and was obviously a True Saint from an aristocratic family.

Xiao Sheng glanced at him coldly and said, “If I can avenge my brother, so what if I join the demon race?”

“Well, this is betrayal!” Someone else stood up!

“Demon race dare to step into the land where the Path of Heaven descends. Are you provoking the entire human race?”

“So what if you’re in the depths of the Azure Rock Forest? Why would the human race be afraid of you?”

One expert after another stood out. For a moment, the atmosphere was tense. They would have already started fighting if not for the day of the Path of Heaven.

Immortal Crane swept its gaze across everyone and said coldly, “Is the day of the Path of Heaven exclusive to humans? Since you can be here, we naturally can be here too.”

“Well, well. Since you’re already here, there’s no need to leave when the day of the Path of Heaven ends!” Someone sneered.

“You’re so confident!” At this moment, an elderly man behind Immortal Crane walked out.

Following that, two more elderly men walked out. They both looked tremendously strange. Some had horns on their heads, while others had long feathers. They looked just like the demon race.

However, they all had similar characteristics. That was their internal qi was terribly powerful!

Even though they tried their best to restrain themselves, the power of the dao technique they casually emitted still showed their unfathomable strength.

“There’s no need to talk nonsense. After the day of the Path of Heaven ends, certainly there will be a time for your demon race to die!” a True Saint said coldly.

Instantly, the atmosphere became tense. Even though the day of the Path of Heaven matter had not settled, obviously there was already an opposition. The grudge between the Si family and Xiao Sheng had already escalated into a conflict between the demon race and the human race. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The conflict between the two races had reached an irreconcilable point, and they could attack at any time.

At this moment, Qin Yu took advantage of this opportunity to secretly look for Yan Ruoxue’s location.

He walked discreetly in the crowd. Due to the appearance of Xiao Sheng and the others, everyone was focused on them. This allowed Qin Yu to take advantage of the situation.

Naturally, the Yan family could not stay out of such a big matter. They also had True Saints standing out.

Qin Yu thus could find the location of the Yan family.

The Yan family occupied a mountain, and their disciples were all over the mountain. There were countless of them, and it should be ten thousand or so.

At the top of the mountain, there was a huge dragon throne, and a middle-aged man was sitting on the dragon throne.

This entire dragon throne was made of crimson gold, with intricate patterns that resembled a living, breathing dragon. The dragon’s claws seemed to strike at space, while the dragon’s mouth was wide open, as if ready to spew forth real fire at any moment. What was even more astonishing was the long dragon spine stretching ten meters behind the dragon throne. Each section resembled the skeletal structure of a true dragon, intricately detailed and exuding a powerful dragon aura.

The middle-aged man on the dragon throne seemed to be in his forties. He had refined features and was dressed in a brocade robe. He had an ethereal demeanor and possessed an otherworldly elegance. He held the armrests of the throne with both hands. The shadow of dragon scales could be vaguely seen on his broad chest as if he had become one with the throne. The demeanor of an emperor made people not dare to look at him directly.

His eyes were as deep as the ocean as he stared at Xiao Sheng. There was no emotion in his eyes as if everything was under his control. His eyes were filled with wisdom and depth as if nothing in the world could escape his eyes.

This middle-aged man was the head of the Yan family, Yan Tianshi. His reputation is renowned, known to all, and everyone knew him.

Yan Tianshi was different from the Holy Lord of the Si family. He had terrifying strength and had become the Holy Lord purely relying on his strength. Even Yan Guyun admired him.

It was also due to this that Yan Tianshi had high prestige and respect in the Yan family. No one dared to disobey his orders.

Sitting beside Yan Tianshi was Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue, sitting beside Yan Tianshi, was like a snow lotus in the clouds. She was cold and refined, mysterious and elegant.

With a high and straight nose bridge, a sharply chiseled chin like jade, and fair, translucent skin as clear as crystal, she appeared exceptionally ethereal and extraordinary.

Long hair cascaded down her shoulders like a waterfall, the black strands shining under the sunlight. She was dressed in a white gown, the hem fluttering in the breeze as she moved gracefully, resembling a celestial being descended to earth.

However, at this moment, there seemed to be some anxiety in her eyes. She seemed to have wanted to leave Yan Tianshi as soon as possible, but there was no way.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue saw Qin Yu in the crowd. She quickly gave Qin Yu a look, signaling him not to simply move.

Qin Yu had no choice but to hide in the dark and wait for an opportunity.

Not far away, various aristocratic families seemed to have gathered. Some were murmuring in low voices, while a few True Saints were confronting Immortal Crane and the others.

At this moment, Yan Tianshi, who had been silent all this while, suddenly stood up. He slowly said, “Today is the day of the Path of Heaven. No matter what grudges, put them aside. We will decide after the day of the Path of Heaven. How about it?”

Although Yan Tianshi’s voice was not loud, it instantly silenced the crowd.

The True Saints of the human race snorted coldly and retreated to the side.

Qin Yu could not help but be secretly shocked when he saw this.

Yan Tianshi’s status was indeed extraordinary. With just one sentence, he had calmed the turmoil.

The scene fell into a brief silence. Outside the barrier, another True Saint walked in.

“The dean of Thunder Courtyard is here too,” someone whispered at this moment.
