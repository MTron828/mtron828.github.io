Chapter 981: Chapter 981, the treasure of the Society of the Hundred Spirits

The more Gu Xinghe read, the more shocked he became. In the end, he slammed the document in his hand onto the table!

What was recorded on it was completely beyond Gu Xinghe’s comprehension! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“He killed more than ten great cultivators undergoing tribulation?”Gu Xinghe’s face was pale as he muttered softly.

One had to know that the tribulation stage was the end of a cultivator, and it was also the highest stage.

It was said that at that stage, there was nothing that could not be done!

“According to the records, but there might be some exaggeration,”Long Mei said.

“But... according to the records, there were indeed many great cultivators at the tribulation stage in the Church of the Massacre Immortal.”

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth and said, “How could this Qin Yu know such a character? !”

“Don’t worry, that’s just a former masked woman. She has long been submerged in the long river of history,”someone beside him said.

When Long Mei heard this, he nodded and said, “It’s said that she appeared three times after she died, but most of them didn’t cause any waves.”

Even though that was the case, Gu Xinghe was still a little worried.

“No, we have to think of a way to kill her!”Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth and said.

At this time, Zhai Xing walked out.

He shook his head and said, “I advise you not to raise that brow. This person is temperamental and can go on a killing spree at any time.”

“If you attack her, the consequences will be unimaginable.”

“Moreover, she easily wiped out those dozens of mighty figures today. Do you think we can get rid of her with just us?”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe immediately calmed down.

After a moment of silence, he said in a low voice, “This matter... There’s still a chance for us to consult the higher-ups.”

After such a thing happened, they temporarily calmed down.

The dispute from before had been put aside unknowingly.

Everyone was watching, afraid that something big would happen again.

On the other side, Qin Yu stayed on the nine pinnacles mountain for nine days.

After nine days, his injuries finally recovered.

“Tie Dan?”On this day, Qin Yu tried to call out in his mind.

However, tie Dan still did not respond.

Qin Yu could not help but sigh slightly.

The sudden disappearance of tie Dan made Qin Yu feel that he was already dead.

“Forget it, I can’t be bothered with him.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

He sat up from the bed and said in a low voice, “After experiencing so much, I already have the capital to step into the martial saint stage.”

With Qin Yu’s current condition, he could indeed try to break into the martial saint stage.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu did not have the heavenly vanilla.

If he wanted to obtain the heavenly vanilla, he would need to rely on tie Dan.

After bidding farewell to everyone, Qin Yu left nine Pinnacles Mountain.

Several days passed in a row, and the matter of the Heavenly Blood Rainbow began to gradually fade away.

Ever since the last time, the Heavenly Blood Rainbow had never appeared again. Some people even went to the immortal slaying sect, but they didn’t find any trace of him.

On this day, Qin Yu returned to Jingdu.

There was a grand meeting to be held in Jingdu.

This meeting was called the Hundred Spirits Meeting. The Hundred Spirits meeting was held once every five years. It was said that rare treasures often appeared at the hundred spirits meeting.

Many treasures were extremely rare, and the identity of their owners was even more mysterious.

Tie Dan did not respond, so Qin Yu could only try to come to the hundred spirits meeting to try his luck and see if he could obtain a stalk of heavenly vanilla.

He came all the way to the hundred spirits meeting. As soon as he arrived, Qin Yu saw a sneaky figure.

This figure was none other than the handlebar mustache.

Qin Yu walked forward quickly and patted his shoulder from behind.

“F * ck!”The handlebar mustache was so scared that he staggered. He looked at Qin Yu warily and muttered, “F * ck, you scared me to death!”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “You’ve done too many bad things. You’re so jumpy.”

“Fart!”The handlebar mustache waved his hand.

Qin Yu followed beside the mustached man and said, “Coincidentally, I have a few questions to ask you.”

The mustached man looked at Qin Yu warily and said, “What Questions?”

“During the incident at the martial arts hall last time, the woman who appeared wearing a mask... was it Xiao Yu?”Qin Yu asked.

“What do you think?”The mustached man said somewhat speechlessly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then she...”

“Then why did she ignore you, right?”The mustached man’s tone carried a hint of ridicule.

Qin Yu nodded.

The mustached man sneered and said, “I told you long ago that she was not a kind person. To her, there is no emotion to speak of.”

“Think about it. She appeared ten thousand years ago. After living for so long, what emotion is there to speak of?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “That’s true, but... if that’s the case, why did she stop the Sky Blood Rainbow Last Time?”

These words stunned the mustached man.

He rubbed his chin and thought for a long time. In the end, he said impatiently, “How the F * CK Would I know? I have nothing to do!”

Qin Yu still wanted to ask something, but the mustached man turned his face away. He couldn’t be bothered with Qin Yu.

“Forget it.”Seeing this, Qin Yu stopped asking. It was useless to ask too many questions.

Then, Qin Yu and the moustache man began to walk around the society.

“This society is not simple. It is said that many people come from the mystic realm, or from the west,”the moustache man muttered.

“There are many Babe that even I have never seen.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly, “I only want to get a heavenly vanilla.”

“That thing is not good.”The moustache man said.

“Why?”Qin Yu asked.

The moustache man said, “The heavenly vanilla is extremely embarrassing. To those who need it, it is a rare item. But to those who do not need it, it is no different from the weeds on the roadside.”

Qin Yu could not help but sigh slightly when he heard this.

Without the heavenly vanilla, Qin Yu would not be able to become a martial saint.

“It seems that it is not that easy to obtain a stalk of heavenly vanilla,”Qin Yu muttered.

The mustached man waved his hand and said, “There are plenty of Babe at the hundred spirits gathering. There must be something you want. Don’t keep your eyes on the heavenly vanilla.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude and didn’t say anything else.

The society was extremely large, almost the size of a county.

Not only were there rare treasures, but there were also clothes, food, and accommodation.

The society lasted for up to a month. It was said that this month would bring great economic benefits to the local area.

Along the way, people kept greeting Qin Yu. Ever since the incident last time, Qin Yu’s voice in the crowd was extremely loud.

“Do you see that? If this Qin Yu raises his arms and waves, who knows how many people are willing to follow him.”In the dark, a pair of eyes was coldly looking at Qin Yu.

“These people are just fence-sitters,”Gu Xinghe said with a sneer.

“Today, they see Qin Yu as a hero. Tomorrow, they may hate him to the bone.”

“And this hundred spirits society is an opportunity for us.”
