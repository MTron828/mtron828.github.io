Chapter 834: Dark Energy Resources

There were many houses in this Mystic Realm. Not to mention living in them, it was enough to support a sect.

However, the most important thing for Qin Yu right now was to hide himself. Therefore, he was only satisfied after he cleaned up this place.

‘With this Mystic Realm, I don’t have to worry too much even if my Martial Saint’s power disappears,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

Even though he said so, Qin Yu understood that he had to increase his strength as soon as possible.

The power that came from others wasn’t practical.

On the surface, everything seemed to be peaceful.

However, Qin Yu knew clearly that there were countless enemies hidden in the dark.

For example, Gu Xinghe, the Hong Yi Sect, and the Luo family’s father and son from the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

The reason why they didn’t make a move was because they were afraid of the Martial Saint’s power in his body.

After settling down, Qin Yu looked at Zheng Ke.

“How should I enter this Mystic Realm in the future?” Qin Yu asked.

Zheng Ke said in a low voice, “If I want to enter this Mystic Realm, I can only rely on the secret key.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Only the secret key? Is there no other way? Like making a token?”

“No, we can only rely on the secret key.” Zheng Ke shook his head.

Qin Yu said worriedly, “Then isn’t there a risk of this secret key being leaked?”

“That’s right. Therefore, this secret key cannot be easily told to others.” Zheng Ke nodded.

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

No wonder there were so few people who could enter the various Mystic Realms.

Then, Zheng Ke passed the secret key to Qin Yu.

With this secret key, Qin Yu could freely enter and exit the Mystic Realm.

The three of them walked out of the Mystic Realm. Qin Yu glanced at Su Qian and said, “What are your plans?”

Su Qian shook his head and said, “I don’t know either.”

Qin Yu replied with an “oh” and ignored Su Qian.

“By the way, Zheng Ke, can you modify the secret key of this Mystic Realm?” Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Zheng Ke couldn’t help but smile bitterly. “If I can modify the secret key, then I can create your own Mystic Realm.”

“That’s true.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Stay here for now. I’m going out for a while.”

Qin Yu planned to look for the man with the mustache.

The first reason was to see what had happened to the Immortal Slaying Sect.

The second reason was that the man with the mustache had traveled extensively and had seen a lot.

Qin Yu planned to rely on the man with the mustache to accumulate the herbs and resources needed to break through.

He could feel the Martial Saint’s power disappear from his body.

At this rate, the Martial Saint’s power could only last for a week at most.

Qin Yu had to accumulate enough resources to break through before the Martial Saint’s power disappeared.

After leaving Qing City, Qin Yu gave the man with the mustache a call.

Through their conversation, they learned that the man with the mustache was still in the Immortal Slaying Sect. At this moment, he was setting up a formation.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and immediately rushed to the Immortal Slaying Sect.

At night, Qin Yu finally arrived near the Immortal Slaying Sect.

At this time, the man with the mustache was already waiting for Qin Yu on the shore.

The man with the mustache pointed at the dense and irregular footprints on the ground and said in a deep voice, “Did you see it?”

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He squatted down and carefully observed the dense footprints on the ground.

Many of these footprints were in a broken state.

This was enough to prove that the footprints didn’t come from a normal person, but from a broken corpse.

“From these footprints, we can infer that at least dozens of corpses have been resurrected,” the man with the mustache said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but turn somewhat ugly.

He took a deep breath and said, “These corpses are all at the Mighty Realm. If someone intentionally uses them, it will definitely be a disaster.”

“Mm.” The man with the mustache nodded.

“Although these corpses can’t be compared to the two in your hands, they are definitely not something an ordinary martial artist can compare to.”

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “Who is controlling these corpses?”

“I don’t know.” The man with the mustache shook his head.

“But what can be confirmed is that the person who can control these corpses is definitely not simple, because this kind of spell has long disappeared.”

“Even for me, I can only resurrect two at most, and it will also take a lot of time and energy.”

This made him feel shocked.

Even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association couldn’t resist this power, right?

Then, the man with the mustache brought Qin Yu to the bottom of the sea.

On one side of the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect, a formation was flashing.

The two didn’t waste time and immediately entered the Immortal Slaying Sect.

After arriving at the Immortal Slaying Sect, the man with the mustache couldn’t help but say, “Qin Yu, the teleportation formation I set up can be seen at a glance. If you hide here, you will be discovered sooner or later.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Of course I know.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Then why do you want me to set up a formation?” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but mutter.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I want them to find me.”

The man with the mustache narrowed his eyes and said, “You don’t plan to hide here at all?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Before I came here, I had already robbed a Mystic Realm from the Hong Yi Sect.”

The man with the mustache suddenly came to a realization.

Qin Yu didn’t continue this topic.

He looked around and saw one pit after another in the entire Immortal Slaying Sect.

The entire Immortal Slaying Sect was like a plowed land, with all the soil turning outward.

“Did you find anything here?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “I wanted to find some treasure, but unfortunately, I didn’t find any.”

Qin Yu nodded. He didn’t continue the topic. Instead, he asked, “By the way, do you know where to get the Divine Medicine? Or dark energy.”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “Divine Medicine? If there was such a place, I would have gone there long ago.”

“Let me tell you, Divine Medicine is a part of the laws of nature. As long as it is a part of the laws, there must be a law.”

“For those top-grade Divine Medicine that lasts for tens of thousands of years, how many times will it appear in a cycle? It’s already good enough to get one.”

This made Qin Yu sigh.

As his strength increased, Qin Yu’s requirements for herbs also became higher and higher.

Ordinary herbs had long lost their effectiveness.

“However... I do know a few places about the dark energy you mentioned.” At this moment, the man with the mustache changed the topic.

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at the man with the mustache and signaled him to continue.

The man with the mustache continued, “There are very few people in the world who can cultivate dark energy. This also leads to the fact that not many dark energy resources have been exploited. Therefore, dark energy might be easier to obtain.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Where is it? Bring me there quickly.”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes at Qin Yu and said, “Although dark energy resources are easier to obtain than spiritual energy resources, it doesn’t mean that they can be found everywhere.”
