2175 Jue Wu versus Yan Ruoxue

The faces of several elders of the Yao family were ashen, and their bodies trembled slightly!

“Nine Heavens Flying Feather…” an elder muttered. Looking at the body of the Supreme Elder, the anger on his face instantly increased.

A Supreme Elder of the nine great aristocratic families was killed. It was something that had not happened for many years!

Most importantly, this incident happened in the Yao family!

“Chase after him!” After a loud shout, several elders immediately shot in the direction where Jue Wu was fleeing!

Relying on the Nine Heavens Flying Feather, Jue Wu flew at high speed in the sky. It was tremendously fast.

According to rumors, the Nine Heavens Flying Feather was refined by an ancient ancestor of the Thunder Courtyard. He was an expert in cultivating thunder-based cultivation techniques and was proficient in spatial techniques. This ancestor had obtained a rare purple phoenix feather by chance and refined it into nine magical artifacts, forming the Nine Heavens Flying Feather.

The Nine Heavens Flying Feather relied on the mysterious power of the purple phoenix to have astonishing speed and the ability to shuttle through space. It could instantly teleport the holder to extremely distant places, making it elusive.”

The direction Jue Wu was heading toward was the Yan family, Mount Donghuang.

…

At Mount Donghuang, Yan Ruoxue slightly closed her eyes. A gentle breeze blew through her long hair, softly brushing against her fair forehead.

At this moment, she was sitting cross-legged with her hands on her knees, palms facing up, and her breathing was steady and deep.

She entered the cultivation state and began to activate the cultivation power in her body, mobilizing the energy of heaven and earth into her body. She took a deep breath and gathered the surrounding spiritual energy into her body, integrating it with her cultivation power.

Gradually, her body emitted a faint light like a blooming lotus, beautiful and sacred.

Her state of mind gradually sank into the depths. She began to sense her cultivation and the power flowing in her body. She suddenly opened her eyes, and they sparkled with bright light.

Her thoughts surged, and the power of her cultivation flowed like a rushing river, swiftly flowing. She began to circulate the Donghuang Meridian Circulation Technique, connecting her body to the mountain range and feeling the boundless power contained within.

A vague layer of frost gradually emerged from the surface of her body, and the power of ice and snow gathered on her body. She lightly raised her palm, and an icicle condensed on her fingertip, emitting a cold internal qi.

It was the Yan family’s most profound technique, but it was so handy in Yan Ruoxue’s hands at his moment.

However, there was no pride in her eyes. Instead, there was a hint of pain deep down.

In her mind, Qin Yu’s figure could not help but appear.

Yan Ruoxue took a deep breath and slowly stood up. Her eyes stared at the void as if they could see through everything.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly sensed a trace of internal qi rapidly approaching.

This internal qi was extremely powerful, but it also carried a hint of weakness. The destination was also tremendously precise. It was Mount Donghuang.

“Someone is coming.”

Soon, Uncle Yan also sensed a wisp of internal qi approaching.

“To be able to ignore the Yan family’s formation and head straight for Mount Donghuang, it must be a True Saint.” Uncle Yan’s expression turned cold, and vigilance filled his eyes.

The two stared at the origin of the internal qi and waited quietly.

In just a moment, Jue Wu’s figure appeared within the sights of the two.

“It’s her?” When Yan Ruoxue saw who it was, she could not help but frown.

Uncle Yan stepped forward, his body emitting a trace of battle intent.

“Uncle Yan, you may go back first.” Yan Ruoxue shook her head.

Uncle Yan said in a deep voice, “I know you know this person, but I have to protect you. I can’t let anyone get close to you easily.”

“She won’t do anything to me,” Yan Ruoxue said quietly.

Uncle Yan frowned and nodded. “Alright, I’ll be nearby.”

Jue Wu’s figure gradually approached. She was like an angel in the night sky, wearing a white robe.

The light emitted by the Nine Heavens Flying Feather was like a meteor streaking across at high speed, making Jue Wu look ghostly.

Her eyes revealed a kind of indifference and determination, making people sense an unfathomable power.

When Jue Wu approached Yan Ruoxue, their eyes met, and the air seemed to freeze for a moment.

“Thunk!”

Jue Wu slowly landed before Yan Ruoxue.

At this moment, she was covered in blood with serious injuries. However, the pressure emanating from her gaze was terrifying.

Yan Ruoxue frowned slightly and said, “You came here late at night, and you’re covered in wounds. What are you…”

Jue Wu interrupted Yan Ruoxue and said coldly, “Qin Yu was sent into the depths of the void. Do you know this?”

“Yes, I do.” Yan Ruoxue had already guessed the purpose of Jue Wu’s visit.

Jue Wu’s face turned cold. “Then why didn’t you avenge him? Aren’t you his most beloved woman?”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression gradually turned cold as Jue Wu questioned her.

“What makes you think that I didn’t go to the Yao family, and I don’t want to avenge him?” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

“Your Yan family is grand. Why are you afraid of the Yao family?” Jue Wu said with some disdain. “If I were you, I would have mobilized the Yan family to attack the Yao family!”

“If I had the final say in the Yan family, the Yan family and the Yao family would have started a war long ago without your reminder,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

The atmosphere between the two became a little strange. It turned tense and solemn.

“Let me tell you. Qin Yu will not die so easily. He will definitely come back.” Jue Wu was the first to speak, her voice incomparably cold.

“If you dare to do anything to harm him, regardless of your status as the saintess of the Yan family, I will kill you!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jue Wu’s threat did not anger Yan Ruoxue.

She looked at Jue Wu and said calmly, “I believe more than anyone else that Qin Yu is not dead. You don’t have to remind me of some of the things.”

“That’s good. I…” Jue Wu opened her mouth, but before she could finish, her body fell heavily onto the ground, and she fainted.

Yan Ruoxue frowned slightly. She walked to Jue Wu and helped her up. Then a wisp of internal qi entered Jue Wu’s body.

“She’s so heavily injured,” Yan Ruoxue frowned and whispered.

Then she looked in a specific direction and shouted, “Uncle Yan, go and get the alchemist to treat her injuries.”

Uncle Yan appeared in front of Yan Ruoxue like a ghost.

He looked at Jue Wu in Yan Ruoxue’s arms and said coldly, “This person lacks manners and fails to show respect. Why bother saving her?”

“Don’t say anything else. I won’t let anything happen to her,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

As soon as she finished speaking, several more internal qi rushed toward Mount Donghuang.

Yan Ruoxue frowned. After thinking for a moment, she hurriedly said, “Take her to the room to rest. Don’t let anyone know about this.”
