2018 Two Big Money Grubbers

Two Big Money Grubbers

Qin Yu knew well that the requirements of the Endless Killing Formation were very harsh. It required 108 high-grade magical artifacts made of the same materials and had the same attributes.

In Divine Fortuity City, it was not difficult to find the high-grade magical artifact. However, Qin Yu was not familiar with Divine Fortuity City. Finding 108 high-grade magic artifacts in a short time was not that simple. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After much thought, Qin Yu decided to look for Mr. Gen the following day and ask him to help. At the same time, he would take the opportunity to see if the forging of the Saint Weapon was successful.

!!

The following day, Qin Yu hurriedly got up and rushed to Mr. Gen’s shop.

“I wonder when Elder Si will leave Divine Fortuity City,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He released his powerful divine sense, covering more than half of Divine Fortuity City.

People like Elder Si would never deliberately hide his internal qi. Therefore, Qin Yu soon located Elder Si’s location.

Elder Si was currently in a courtyard in the depths of Divine Fortuity City. To everyone’s surprise, this courtyard was privately owned. It seemed to be Elder Si’s residence.

As for why Elder Si would set up a residence in Divine Fortuity City, no one knew.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at Mr. Gen’s residence.

After entering, he found Mr. Gen still lying on the rocking chair, looking extremely sloppy.

Qin Yu could not help but frown. He walked forward and asked straight to the point, “My Saint Weapon…”

“Oh, you came at the right time. I’ve seen your bones. I need to use a formation to revive your Holy Power,” Mr. Gen said.

“Then let’s revive it,” Qin Yu said subconsciously.

“You have to pay more,” Mr.Gen sneered and said.

“You’re indeed a money-grubber,” Qin Yu muttered. “How much do you need?”

Mr. Gen extended a finger and said, “10 billion.”

“Why don’t you go and rob?” Qin Yu’s eyes widened as if he could not believe what he had heard.

“I don’t rob because I’m too lazy,” Mr. Gen said lazily.

Qin Yu was speechless. He knew that people like Mr. Gen were unreasonable. He didn’t want to waste time arguing with him about these meaningless questions.

Therefore, Qin Yu took out a black card and said, “I’ll give you five billion first. I’ll give you the remaining five billion when I get the thing.”

“No, I won’t do anything if I don’t pay,” Mr. Gen shook his head and said.

Qin Yu was speechless. “Alright, I’ll give it to you. But let me tell you, if you dare to lie to me, I won’t let you off easily.”

“Pay, and it’ll be done,” Mr. Gen replied cleanly.

Qin Yu had no choice but to give 10 billion to Mr. Gen.

“When will you start?” Qin Yu asked.

“I’ll start after you leave,” Mr. Gen said gently.

Qin Yu had gotten used to Mr. Gen’s tremendously irritating way of talking.

“Can I trouble you with something?” he asked immediately. “I need 108 high-grade magical artifacts now. I wonder if you have any here?”

“I don’t have any trash here,” Mr. Gen said.

Qin Yu was speechless. “Can you help me buy them? I can give you money.”

“I’m not a junk collector,” Mr. Gen sneered and said.

“D*mn it!” Qin Yu couldn’t take it anymore. He cursed in his heart and turned around to leave.

Since Mr. Gen couldn’t do it, he could only think of other ways.

At this moment, Qin Yu thought of the beautiful and flirtatious lady boss.

“I think she shouldn’t have any problem,” Qin Yu rubbed his chin and muttered.

Therefore, Qin Yu immediately rushed to the lady boss’s shop.

He rushed to the lady boss’s shop. As soon as he entered, he was attracted by the exotic decorations.

All kinds of jewelry were hanging in the shop, sparkling and dazzling.

The lady boss was an attractive beautiful woman with a pair of enchanting eyes and a curvy figure that made people’s hearts flutter.

Coincidentally, Chu Sheng was also there.

His expression did not look too good, and a hint of anxiety was even in his eyes.

When Chu Sheng saw Qin Yu, his expression became even uglier. He subconsciously said, “Why are you here?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said with a faint smile, “Why? Are you surprised that I’m still alive?”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Chu Sheng immediately understood something. His face darkened as he said coldly, “You killed them both, did you?”

“What are you talking about? I don’t understand,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“But I must advise you to find two decent attendants next time.”

After saying this, Qin Yu ignored Chu Sheng.

“Just you wait!” Chu Sheng gritted his teeth and said.

“Alright, I’ll wait for you, little b*stard,” Qin Yu said sarcastically.

Chu Sheng trembled in anger when he heard this.

However, with his ability, he did not dare to challenge Qin Yu at all. He could only suppress his anger and leave the place.

After he left, the lady boss said in surprise, “Little Brother, did you really kill his two attendants?”

...

Qin Yu spread his hands and did not comment.

“You’d better watch out. The Chu family isn’t far from here,” the lady boss said in a low voice.

“Thank you for your reminder,” Qin Yu bowed slightly and said.

“But, Little Brother, what are you here for this time?” Seeing Qin Yu not be bothered, the lady boss changed the topic.

Qin Yu straightaway stated his purpose for coming.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the lady boss said in surprise, “108 pieces? And high-grade magical artifacts? What’re you going to do?”

“I need to use them,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Seeing Qin Yu unwilling to answer, the lady boss did not ask further.

She thought for a while and then said, “Of course, I can’t gather 108 magical artifacts here. However, I can help you ask. It’s just that the price…”

“Money is not a problem,” Qin Yu immediately said. “Lady Boss, just tell me the amount.”

The lady boss was obviously an old fox. She smiled and said, “I don’t want much either. I’ll only charge you 20 billion. How about it?”

...

Qin Yu could not help but secretly grit his teeth!

D*mn it! The people of Divine Fortuity City were all wily money-grubbers!

However, Qin Yu had no choice at the moment. He could only agree and said, “Alright, I’m fine with 20 billion. How long will it take?”

“Give me three days,” the lady boss said after some thought.

“No, it’s too long.” Qin Yu immediately shook his head.

No one could guarantee when Elder Si would leave. Once he left, it would be troublesome.

“I can only give you one day,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Why are you in such a hurry?” the lady boss asked in surprise.

“Can’t you do it?” Qin Yu asked.

“Hmm… How about you give me another billion and come back at the same time tomorrow?” the lady boss said.

“Alright.” Qin Yu was too lazy to argue. As long as he could kill Elder Si, everything would be worthwhile.
