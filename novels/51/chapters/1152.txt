Chapter 1153: Chapter 1,153, level five of the battle character manual 

Qin Yu did not say anything. He knew that it was useless to say anything now.

Since he was caught by someone who was not as skilled as him, there was no point in trying to show off.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly, as if he was at his disposal.

This made Gu Xinghe quite satisfied. He controlled the spell and slowly opened the tunnel.

Then, Gu Xinghe grabbed Qin Yu with one hand and entered the passage.

A burst of light shone brightly, and his head was dizzy.

When Qin Yu opened his eyes again, he had already arrived at the first mystical realm.

This first mystical realm was filled with spiritual qi everywhere, and the short buildings were not what Qin Yu had imagined.

It was also true that this place was vast and sparsely populated. If there was enough land, who would be willing to live in a high-rise building.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. Traces of spiritual qi flowed through his pores and entered his body.

This spiritual Qi quickly restored a trace of Qin Yu’s physical strength. However, because his divine sense was restrained, Qin Yu had no way to escape.

Gu Xinghe dragged Qin Yu like he was dragging a dead dog.

The two of them came to the entrance of a large hall. When they passed through the door, they saw a huge formation stage.

At this moment, there were eight people in the corner of the formation stage.

Golden light that looked like chains extended out from between their brows. The end of the chains seemed to have disappeared into the void.

“Higher-ups?”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly when he saw these eight people.

Those eight higher-ups were actually captured here?

Similarly, the way those eight higher-ups looked at Qin Yu was also extremely strange.

They seemed to not want Qin Yu to see this embarrassing state, so they all turned their faces to the side.

“Kid, just stay here peacefully. Don’t worry, I Won’t let you die so quickly,”Gu Xinghe said with a cold smile.

He used the same trick again, and a strand of light like a chain entered the space between Qin Yu’s brows.

Then, Qin Yu felt as if his divine sense was about to be extracted, and the pain was unbearable!

The strands of divine sense were bound by the chains, and this spell seemed to have trapped Qin Yu’s primordial spirit!

A total of nine people were bound here, unable to move.

Looking at the scene in front of him, Gu Xinghe was extremely satisfied, and he couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Finally, finally, this day has arrived!”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“From today onwards, I am the ruler of this world!”

Qin Yu could not help but sneer, “Gu Xinghe, the holy region will open soon. When the people of the Holy Region arrive, I’m afraid your title as the ruler will be in vain.”

Gu Xinghe suddenly looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Then I will destroy that ancient array platform!”

“Destroy? There are eighteen array platforms in the world. These eighteen array platforms are scattered in every corner of the world. How did you destroy them?”Qin Yu sneered.

He was not worried that Gu Xinghe would destroy all the array platforms, because Tian Jizi had predicted that the people of the Holy Region would arrive soon and come to extradite them.

“You’ve reminded me,”Gu Xinghe snorted.

“I’ll send someone to destroy these eighteen array platforms immediately!”

“Okay, then you go.”Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and ignored Gu Xinghe.

However, how could Gu Xinghe let go of Qin Yu just like that? His fingers were stained with a ray of light.

This ray of light was extremely strange, like a small black hole.

Gu Xinghe pointed the light in his hand forward. With a “Weng”sound, the nine chains immediately started to tremble!

“Ah! ! !”

Intense pain! It went straight for the divine sense!

Qin Yu only felt a splitting headache, and his body was even spasming!

In the Great Hall, the wails of eight people could be heard! Their faces were distorted, and their bodies were trembling non-stop!

Some people even began to beg Gu Xinghe for mercy! They begged him to stop!

This pain was even more painful than the blood-sucking array platform from before!

However, Qin Yu clenched his teeth tightly and did not say a word.

This undoubtedly infuriated Gu Xinghe. He narrowed his eyes and said, “You can endure it quite well. TSK TSK, good, I’d like to see how long you can endure it!”

Gu Xinghe’s hands once again shone with light as he pointed towards the convergence point of the chains!

“Hualala!”

The nine chains suddenly trembled violently!

The pain was twice as intense as before!

The eight higher-ups were instantly in excruciating pain!

Qin Yu’s forehead was also drenched in sweat. It was obvious that this pain was also unbearable for him.

Gu Xinghe snorted and said, “Enjoy it slowly. This is just the beginning.”

With that, Gu Xinghe turned around and walked out.

The entire room was filled with wails and every one of the higher-ups was trembling.

“Qin Yu... are you f * cking crazy... Why did you provoke him!”Yan Yongfu squeezed out these words from between his teeth.

“Provoking him... isn’t he the one who suffers!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Qin Yu endured the pain and sneered, “Yes, but with you guys accompanying me, it’s worth it.”

“You guys should also try the taste of Yan Ruoxue back then.”

After saying that, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and even sat up cross-legged.

Ever since Qin Yu debuted, he had experienced countless pain.

Although the pain this time was even more intense, his unyielding character allowed him to forcefully resist it.

The eight higher-ups were different. Such pain was even worse than killing them!

Qin Yu would rather let himself suffer the same pain than let these eight higher-ups suffer!

“You lunatic...”Yan Yongfu was in so much pain that he almost fainted. On the other hand, Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged, as if nothing had happened.

Surviving in adversity had become Qin Yu’s personal motto.

He didn’t care about suffering. As long as he didn’t die, he still had a chance.

At this moment, Qin Yu only had two options.

First, he had to wait for tie Dan to wake up.

He was at the peak of the Almighty Realm. As long as he woke up, Gu Xinghe wasn’t worth mentioning.

Second, he had to comprehend the fifth level of the Dou character technique!

Once he comprehended the fifth level, he would have a chance to defeat Gu Xinghe!
