Chapter 630: The Agonized Yan Ruoxue Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the corpses at the door, Qu Xie’s face turned ashYeah, and blue veins bulged on his forehead.

“Move the corpses in!” Qu Xie shouted angrily.

The few of them hurried to bring the corpses back.

In the monitoring room, Qu Xie looked at the black-robed man on the screYeah, and his expression turned even uglier.

“Not many people can do this, but... who is this person?!” Qu Xie was furious.

Xia Hang opened his mouth, as if he had something to say.

“President Qu, this person’s goal is obviously to get the bloodline power,” Xia Hang said in a deep voice.

“So... this person might be related to Yan Ruoxue.”

Xia Hang racked his brain to hint at Qu Xie.

After Qu Xie heard this, he couldn’t help but say coldly, “Could it be... the person that Yan Yongxiu found?”

Hearing this, Xia Hang immediately felt a headache.

“Impossible, Yan Yongxiu has no real power now. As long as he had any real power, he would never have let us do anything to his daughter,” Xia Hang said in a deep voice.

“President Qu, I suggest throwing out bait and ambushing him secretly,” the assistant next to him said at this time.

Qu Xie was silent for a moment, then nodded and said, “That makes sense, but... it’s not that easy to create another bloodline inheritor.”

After all, Yan Ruoxue’s blood was limited, and the accumulation of this period of time had to be handed over to Yan Jinyao.

“We can find anyone and say that he has the bloodline. As long as we don’t say it, who knows if it’s true or false,” the assistant said with a smile.

However, this suggestion was quickly denied by Xia Hang.

“I suggest that we wait for a while more. That black-robed person isn’t a fool,” Xia Hang said.

“How can that black-robed person believe that we have introduced a new successor in such a short time?”

Qu Xie agreed with Xia Hang’s words.

He nodded slightly and said, “Alright, we’ll do as you say.”

Xia Hang heaved a sigh of relief.

As long as Qin Yu died, his daughter would be saved, and he would be free.

...

The black-robed man’s actions immediately caused a huge uproar.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association had carefully selected geniuses, but they were all killed by the same person one after another. How could this news not be shocking?!

For a moment, almost everyone was guessing the black-robed man’s identity.

“Even Qin Yu back then couldn’t have achieved the strength of this black-robed man.”

“Qin Yu is far inferior to him. This black-robed man is definitely a veteran Martial Marquis!”

“Yeah, there aren’t many people in the world who can kill someone at the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis realm so easily.”

“He might be at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm.”

With the rise of the black-robed man, the reputation of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was ruined.

If the Jingdu Martial Arts Association still couldn’t catch him, their reputation would probably be completely ruined.

In a certain room of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

This room was on the 60th floor.

And in the room, there was a huge bathtub!

What was shocking was that what was in the bathroom wasn’t water, but a bathtub full of blood!

And this blood all came from Yan Ruoxue!

God knew how much suffering Yan Ruoxue had suffered!

“Young Master Yan, this is Yan Ruoxue’s blood,” Qu Xie pointed at the bathtub and said.

Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but frown. He stared at the bathtub full of blood and said in a deep voice, “Is this blood really so useful?”

“Yes,” Qu Xie said with a nonchalant smile.

Seeing this, Yan Jinyao didn’t say anything more.

He slowly took off his clothes and walked to the side of the Bath. Then, he slowly immersed his entire body into it.

“Sizzle!!”

The moment his body touched the blood, white steam emerged from Yan Jinyao’s body!

The blood seemed to be boiling, and steam was coming out of it!

“Ah!!”

Yan Jinyao felt as if his body was about to be boiled. Waves of intense pain made him break out in cold sweat!

Qu Xie said excitedly, “As a member of the Yan family, you’re much more compatible with the blood!”

The blood became hotter and hotter while almost merging with Yan Jinyao!

In an instant, Yan Jinyao felt that his body was quietly changing!

A formation plate under the bathtub turned purple!

Sizzle!

At this moment, the bright red in the blood began to disappear, as if it had been absorbed by Yan Jinyao!

His body became incomparably translucent, and his physical body became countless times stronger!

Not only that, Yan Jinyao felt that his state of mind instantly became clear, and even his divine sense skyrocketed!

“Clatter!”

Another loud sound rang out!

The formation plate under the bathtub began to tremble, as if it was about to shatter!

The bright red color of the blood completely disappeared. At a glance, it was almost dried up!

“This feeling... is beyond imagination!” A rare trace of excitement appeared on Yan Jinyao’s face!

He slowly walked out of the bathtub and clenched his fist lightly. He felt that the power of his physical body had become countless times stronger!

“This is the power of the Yan family’s bloodline?” Yan Jinyao murmured in a low voice.

Qu Xie said with admiration, “Young Master Yan, your bloodline inheritance is as high as 60%! As expected of a member of the Yan family!”

“60%?” Yan Jinyao frowned.

He looked at Qu Xie coldly and said, “President Qu, only 60%?”

“60% isn’t bad.” Qu Xie seemed to understand Yan Jinyao’s meaning.

“I’m afraid no one can surpass this number except for Yan Ruoxue herself.”

Yan Jinyao’s expression became even more unsightly when he heard this!

“In other words... Yan Ruoxue herself is 100%?” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

“Of course her own bloodline is 100%,” Qu Xie said somewhat speechlessly.

This immediately made Yan Jinyao feel defeated!

He had only inherited 60%of the power, but his strength had already undergone a qualitative change.

Then, wouldn’t Yan Ruoxue herself be beyond imagination?!

“President Qu, I’m a little curious. Instead of spending so much effort to nurture others, why don’t you just let Yan Ruoxue cultivate on her own?” Yan Jinyao asked tentatively.

“She has a complete bloodline power. If she cultivates, her future will be limitless, right?”

President Qu nodded slightly. “We did plan to do so, but... she and Qin Yu are inseparable. How can she be used by us?”

“Now, we have killed the person she loved. If we let her cultivate, she will definitely become the archenemy of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in the future.”

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and said, “In other words... you have no intention of letting Yan Ruoxue leave?”

“We absolutely can’t let her leave!” Qu Xie said affirmatively.

Yan Jinyao didn’t say anything for a long time. After a while, he slightly let out a sigh of relief. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As long as Yan Ruoxue couldn’t leave the prison, he would be the successor with the highest inheritance!

“With my current strength, there shouldn’t be many people in this world who can beat me,” Yan Jinyao clenched his fist and said in a low voice.

Qu Xie smiled nonchalantly. “That’s right, but... you have to be careful of that black-robed man. If he finds out about this, he will definitely kill you.”

“Black-robed man?” Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and a hint of interest appeared on his face.

“I feel great now. I really want to see that black-robed man...” Yan Jinyao sneered.
