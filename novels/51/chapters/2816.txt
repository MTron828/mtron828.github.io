Chapter 2817: The Wormhole

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“I don’t know the specifics, but one thing is certain. Even if the Holy Lord used all the power of Saint Kingdom, he couldn’t open a wormhole. This is a spatial passageway that can cross planes regardless of race. This power should have been created when the World Energy exploded.”

Fatty Situ explained this to Qin Yu in detail.

Qin Yu nodded. He could roughly understand what Fatty Situ said.

Even a powerful force could only break space in an instant.

Soon, the space would return to its previous state. However, the wormhole was a spatial transmission channel formed after a long time due to the powerful energy impact.

The power had to be at least the power to split the heavens and earth before it could form such a permanent passageway.

“The entire Saint World has a total of three wormholes. The one under the Divine Silkworm Ridge is one of them. Furthermore, a person suspected to be from the Divine Realm once appeared here. He directly slaughtered nearly 50% of the entire Saint Kingdom’s people. This also led to the death of the fourth Holy Lord, Dao Xuan.”

Fatty Situ revealed some secrets.

“What? Even the Holy Lord can’t defeat the person who came out of the wormhole?”

Qin Yu gasped.

“That’s right. There’s no news of him at all. After the fourth Holy Lord, Qing Feng entered the Divine Silkworm Ridge, there was no news of him. According to the guesses, it’s very likely that he was killed in one hit! Hence, the subsequent Holy Lords, including Dao Xuan, were not willing to enter this strange place. After so many years, I wonder what the situation is now.”

Fatty Situ stared at Qin Yu with goosebumps.

“Boss Qin Yu, are we going to such a terrifying place?”

“Let’s go in the direction first. We’ll decide later.”

Qin Yu hesitated for a long time before slowly saying.

He finally understood what this black color meant.

There were only a few places marked by the black color. He did not expect one of them to be so terrifying that even a Holy Lord had died there.

Anything could happen when they entered.

“But if I can’t solve the problem of the Investiture of Gods, I’m afraid I’ll have to enter the place to find a solution. At that time, you can wait for me at the periphery. If I’m lucky enough to come out, it’ll be best. If I can’t come out, you don’t have to die with me.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Now that he could not solve the problem of the Investiture of Gods, he could not even unleash his full strength, let alone cultivation.

With the terrifying power of the current holder of the Investiture of Gods, Qin Yu couldn’t defeat the other party in terms of calculation and strength.

Thus, the only way now was to fight with his strength.

He had thought about this path for a long time before deciding on it. It was also because of Xiao Hai’s words that he was inspired.

To be put to death and then to be revived!

The power of the Investiture of Gods was a power that made people despair.

It locked everyone’s divine souls in the Investiture of Gods.

Even Qin Yu, who was extremely lucky to have obtained the remnant page of the Investiture of Gods, could only escape a wisp of his divine soul. Most of his memories were still sealed inside.

Moreover, the only divine soul that escaped was the current holder of the Investiture of Gods. This was a despairing fact.

“Alright, Boss. Since you’ve decided, I’ll accompany you wherever you go!”

Fatty Situ said through gritted teeth.

“However, we need to find a team to go there urgently. It doesn’t matter if it’s a hunter group or a merchant group. This is an extremely long distance. We can’t make it there by just rushing.”

Fatty Situ said after studying the map.

“Alright, let’s go directly to the trading market to take a look. There are many such teams in Lingxu City. It’s just that the distance is so long, so it’ll probably be quite difficult to find suitable candidates.”

Qin Yu said after thinking for a moment.

Going there by themselves would also waste a lot of time and Saint Power, which was not worth it.

“Alright. If it doesn’t work, we’ll travel while searching in different cities. The probability will be higher this way.”

Fatty Situ didn’t have much hope of finding a team here.

Lingxu City and the Divine Silkworm Ridge were almost at the extremes of two locations. One was in the northwest, and the other was in the southeast.

Almost no one would take such a route.

Just the time to travel would probably take nearly two months.

Moreover, some of these places required magical artifacts for void navigation or they would have to go in a huge circle.

This kind of magical artifact was usually available in large families.

…

In the Endless Mine, an old man dressed in ancient clothes sat quietly.

Deep breaths were exhaled from every cell in his body, perfectly blending with the surrounding environment.

One would have the illusion that no one was sitting there by just looking.

At this moment, Lord Tang was standing below with a group of people from the Path of Heaven Academy.

“Has Truth Gu sensed something?”

The old man sitting cross-legged let out an inaudible voice.

“That’s right! That Qin Yu didn’t die and has already returned to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lord Tang’s body trembled as he quickly explained the situation.

“This Truth Gu was planted on this person when he was captured in the Endless Mine. At that time, it was only used to guard against the Guardian of Order and the Upper Dome, but I didn’t expect it to be useful today.”

When they were fighting for the Soul Suppression Ring previously, everyone used their methods. However, they did not expect this Truth Gu to still be useful after such a long time.

This Gu would only show its effect during the ‘Dao Competition’.

When it resided in one’s body, it would be like one’s energy. Therefore, this Gu was still in Qin Yu’s body even after experiencing the power of the Heavenly Sin and the Investiture of Gods.

“Good!”

Lord Sui snorted lightly.

He would not consider the matter of the Investiture of Gods. His body trembled slightly when he thought of the few people who had visited him.

However, he needed to seize the Soul Suppression Ring. The ring was enough for him to earn back all his capital.

Moreover, it was enough to make those big shots owe him a favor. This was already enough.

“Where is he now?”

“Lingxu City.”

Lord Tang said respectfully.

“Set off immediately. This time, you will bring a group of people and move out openly. After leaving Lingxu City, look for an opportunity to make a move. I will watch in the dark. If other factions want to get involved, I will make a move at that time.”

Lord Sui immediately made arrangements.

Now that he had the orders of those big shots, no one would be blind enough to start a war with him now.

His goal was to seize the opportunity to get the Soul Suppression Ring in Qin Yu’s hands.
