When he heard this, Commander Long couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Mr. Wu, do you know what you’re talking about?” Commander Long shook his head helplessly.

“The Jingdu War Zone has always been unsurpassable. The goal of the other war zones is only to get second place.”

“Now, you’re saying that Qin Yu promised to get first place? What, is he even more powerful than Ye Qing?”

Mr. Wu also felt a little embarrassed. He said helplessly, “Qin Yu made a promise. If he goes back on his word, he’s willing to be punished.”

“Humph, he’s just a fearless person out of ignorance,” Commander Long snorted lightly.

Then, he waved his hand, and Xue Hu walked over.

“Greetings, Mr. Wu!” Xue Hujing saluted and shouted.

“Alright, Xue Hu. From now on, I’ll appoint you as the captain of the Longhu team. Do you have confidence in doing a good job?” Commander Long asked.

Xue Hu shouted, “I promise to complete the mission!”

Commander Long smiled nonchalantly and said, “You also have to make a promise.”

Xue Hu didn’t even think before he shouted, “I will let the Chuzhou region get into the top three!”

“Good! If you can’t do it, I will hold you responsible!” Commander Long shouted.

“Yes!”

Then, Xue Hu walked towards the Longhu team.

Mr. Wu wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Commander Long with a wave of his hand.

“Sigh.” Mr. Wu couldn’t help but let out a long sigh.

...

On the plane, Qin Yu suddenly woke up from his sleep!

He patted his head and suddenly came to a realization. “I just remembered that I forgot one thing! Today is the day of the special training in the Chuzhou region!”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Yao Qing and asked, “How long will it be until the plane lands?”

Yao Qing calculated the time and said, “About one more hour.”

Qin Yu nodded. One hour was enough.

He immediately closed his eyes and searched for a suitable cultivation method in his mind.

In a short period of time, the fastest way to improve was naturally to train the body.

Therefore, Qin Yu quickly found a body training plan in his mind.

This plan could improve one’s physique in an extremely short period of time, but it was quite painful.

Fortunately, Qin Yu could refine a pill to make up for this.

“The body refining technique should be enough,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The plane soon landed in the provincial capital of Chuzhou.

As soon as he got off the plane, Qin Yu took a taxi and planned to go to the Chuzhou region.

However, at this time, Mr. Wu called Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, where have you been? I couldn’t get through to you!” Mr. Wu couldn’t help but ask as soon as the call went through.

Qin Yu said apologetically, “I’m sorry, Mr. Wu. I had something to do and went out for a while. I’m planning to head to the Chuzhou region now.”

Mr. Wu was silent for a moment and said, “Alright, come to my house first.”

After saying this, Mr. Wu hung up the phone.

Qin Yu looked at the time. It was twelve o’clock in the afternoon.

“It seems that I’m still late,” Qin Yu stuck out his tongue and said in a low voice.

A moment later, Qin Yu and Yao Qing arrived at Mr. Wu’s house.

At this time, Mr. Wu was sitting in the study while carefully reading a document in his hand. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Qin Yu pushed the door open and entered. He asked with a smile, “Mr. Wu, what are you looking at? Why do you look so serious?”

Seeing Qin Yu, Mr. Wu immediately stood up.

He said with some reproach, “How could you forget such an important thing? Let me tell you, the higher-ups are very dissatisfied with you now! And they have changed the coach of the Longhu team!”

At this point, Mr. Wu threw the document in his hand to Qin Yu.

“Take a look for yourself,” Mr. Wu said with a cold expression.

Qin Yu took the document and looked at it carefully. He found that it was an incomplete cultivation technique.

Although this cultivation technique looked quite mysterious, it lacked the most important part.

“Mr. Wu, what is this?” Qin Yu asked.

Mr. Wu snorted and said, “This is Ye Qing’s special training technique. It’s just a weakened version.”

“A weakened version?” Qin Yu shook his head.

“This isn’t a weakened version, but an incomplete version. If we train according to this technique, not only will it not have any positive effect, but it will also bring negative side effects,” said Qin Yu.

Mr. Wu was stunned. He hurriedly asked, “Is what you said true?”

“It’s absolutely true,” said Qin Yu.

Mr. Wu frowned. He took the document and thought for a moment, then said in a low voice, “If it’s true, then we’ll be in trouble.”

Thinking of this, Mr. Wu quickly pulled Qin Yu and said, “Let’s go. We’re going to the Chuzhou region now!”

Qin Yu and Mr. Wu walked out of the house and prepared to go to the Chuzhou region.

At this moment, Xiao Yu came back from outside with her school bag.

As soon as she saw Qin Yu, she threw her school bag and pounced over.

“Qin Yu, why are you here? What have you been doing all this time? You didn’t come to my house to play!” Xiao Yu said with displeasure.

“Xiao Yu! Qin Yu is very busy. How could he have time to play with you?” Mr. Wu said unhappily.

Xiao Yu muttered, “Then you have time today, right? Qin Yu, why don’t you teach me? I also want to learn martial arts skills!”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I don’t have time now. I’ll come to you when I’m done, okay?”

“No way! I don’t know when you’ll be done. You’re always lying.” Xiao Yu shook Qin Yu’s arm and said.

“Ahem, how about I teach you?” Yao Qing volunteered.

Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at Yao Qing and said, “You? With your weak martial arts skills, forget it.”

“And you look so perverted!”

Yao Qing’s face immediately blushed and he muttered, “I’m so handsome. How am I perverted...”

“Okay, okay, we have to go now. Yao Qing, stay with Xiao Yu.” Mr. Wu pulled Qin Yu and walked to the car.

Soon, the two of them arrived in the Chuzhou region.

They went straight to Commander Long’s office.

In the office, Commander Long was standing in front of the window while looking at the training field outside.

“Commander Long!” Mr. Wu quickly walked in with Qin Yu.

“Mr. Wu? Why are you here?” Commander Long took a sip of tea.

Then, he pointed at the training field outside and said, “Look, all the members of the Longhu team are full of vitality! Xue Hu’s special training plan is surprisingly good!”

Mr. Wu, not knowing how to respond, was silent for a moment.

“This special training plan is indeed surprising. Not only will it not bring any positive effect, but it will also increase the burden on the body,” Qin Yu said at this time.

“If this goes on for a long time, the bodily functions of the members of the Longhu team will seriously decline.”

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, Commander Long immediately frowned and looked at Qin Yu with displeasure.

“Who are you?” Commander Long asked with a cold expression.

Qin Yu bowed and said, “I’m Qin Yu. Greetings, Commander Long.”

“Are you Qin Yu? The so-called King of Chuzhou?” Commander Long didn’t have a good impression of Qin Yu.

Before Qin Yu could answer, Commander Long continued, “You said that this training plan will increase the burden on the body? What, are you saying that Ye Qing’s training plan isn’t good?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Ye Qing’s training plan is naturally extraordinary. Unfortunately, what you are holding in your hands is an incomplete version.”

“Moreover, even if it was a complete version, I don’t think it’s better than mine.”
