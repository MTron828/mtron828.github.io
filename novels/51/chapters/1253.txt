Chapter 1254: Chapter 1,254, treacherous elder Bai 

This punch caused everyone to turn pale with fright!

Just by relying on the strength of his physical body, he was able to pierce through the void? Just how powerful was this power?

One had to know that Qin Yu was able to pierce through the void without any spirit energy! This was simply unheard of!

While everyone was shocked, that Zi he had already been grabbed out from the void by Qin Yu.

He held zi he with one hand and coldly said, “I’ve already spared you twice, and you still dare to Sneak Attack Me?”

At this time, Zi he had already been shaken by this punch until his entire body was covered in blood. It was a miserable sight, and he looked dispirited.

Qin Yu slowly clenched his fist, as if he was brewing divine power.

Not far away, elder Bai was already anxious. He hurriedly shouted, “Qin Yu, quickly let him go! I promise to bring you to the Holy Region, how about it?”

Qin Yu coldly glanced at elder Bai and sneered, “You old bastard who goes back on his words, do you think I will believe your nonsense?”

After saying that, Qin Yu raised his hand and threw a punch straight at Zi He!

This punch could even Pierce through the void, let alone a mortal body!

Zi He’s head directly exploded. Even his primordial spirit could not escape before he died.

Qin Yu tossed zi he’s corpse aside, then stared coldly at the crowd.

“I’m telling you, I’m going to the saint-level.”Qin Yu’s tone was extremely cold.

He swept his gaze across the crowd, then said, “Hand over the teleportation array flag, or I’ll kill all of you.”

These words were incomparably arrogant, but no one doubted the authenticity of these words!

The ability that Qin Yu had displayed was simply too powerful. It was already so powerful that it made people feel that it was ridiculous.

Although there were many mighty figures present, no one was willing to fight with Qin Yu.

Elder Bai’s face was ashen, and his face was filled with gloom.

Even in the Holy Region, he was also an elder of a sect. When had he ever suffered such humiliation! !

But now, he was being threatened by a person without spiritual energy. How could he tolerate this! !

At this moment, Zi Ru walked over.

She leaned against elder Bai’s ear and whispered, “Elder Bai, why do we have to fight with him now? Just promise him to go to the holy region. As long as he reaches the Holy Region, wouldn’t it be easy for us to kill him?”

Elder Bai narrowed his eyes slightly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This was indeed a good method.

Although elder Bai was powerful, he didn’t want to take this risk.

As long as he brought Qin Yu back to the holy region, there would be countless ways to kill him.

In other words, any random treasure could suppress Qin Yu!

Thinking of this, elder Bai looked at Qin Yu.

He took a deep breath, then changed his expression and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, it was all a misunderstanding just now. We were blind. We didn’t know that you had such ability. It seems that the result of the test is not accurate.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word, quietly watching elder Bai’s performance.

Elder bai continued, “Your strength has indeed shocked us. Our sect is willing to accept you, and has promised to give you a guest elder.”

When he said this, everyone was shocked!

A guest elder position just after going to the Holy Region? This was probably an unprecedented treatment, right?

However, Qin Yu sneered in his heart.

There must be something fishy going on. Qin Yu was not a fool. He could see through elder Bai’s thoughts.

However, he was not in a hurry to expose elder Bai. After all, he still needed them to go to the holy region.

Therefore, Qin Yu smiled and said, “In that case, I won’t stand on ceremony.”

“Hahaha, it’s just a misunderstanding. Qin Yu, when we go to Our Heavenly Cloud sect, we will naturally treat you well!”Elder Bai said with a smile, looking like an old fox.

Qin Yu didn’t move. He said with a faint smile, “Then when do we set off?”

Elder Bai Thought for a moment and said, “At the current speed, I’m afraid it will take a few more days.”

“Mr. Qin, What About Us?”The various almighty experts asked anxiously.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and shook his head, “You guys... Don’t go this time. Wait for the next time.”

The reason why he said this was because Qin Yu knew that once he went to the holy region, he would become a fish at the mercy of others.

These mighty figures were following him to the holy region. When Qin Yu escaped, the Heavenly Cloud sect would definitely blame them.

It was hard to say whether Qin Yu could escape or not. It was impossible for him to bring so many people with him.

He had no choice but to say these words.

However, how could the mighty figures understand Qin Yu’s good intentions? To them, going to the holy region was their lifelong pursuit.

“Qin Yu, you promised us!”

“Yes, you... You Can’t go back on your words. We’ve been waiting for so many years to go to the Holy Region.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only sigh slightly.

He looked at elder Bai and said, “They want to go with me.”

Elder Bai said with a smile, “No problem!”

The mighty figures hurriedly cupped their hands and said, “Thank you!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

After going to the holy region, whether they lived or died would be their good fortune. Qin Yu couldn’t change anything.

“Let’s go.”Qin Yu turned around and glanced at Zhen Yue and Di Zun.

Di Zun didn’t see through elder Bai’s scheme and said cheerfully, “Elder Bai has finally returned to life. You killed that Zi he and he actually agreed to take you to the Holy Region and return it to your guest elder!”

“Yeah, it seems that the holy region is a place where the strong are respected!”Zhen Yue added.

There were many people here, so Qin Yu didn’t explain too much.

No one knew when elder Bai and the others would set off, so Qin Yu and the other two didn’t go too far away. Instead, they chose to find a cave in the forest near the east continent.

The cave was quite big, so it could easily accommodate three people.

“Master, you are so powerful! That punch actually shattered the space!”Di Zun said excitedly.

Qin Yu’s face was solemn. He stared at di zun and said, “Di Zun, you’d better go to elder Bai now and agree to take him as your master.”
