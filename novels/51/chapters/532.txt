Chapter 533: I Told You to Let Him Go! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s voice carried an unspeakable sense of coldness.

However, his words didn’t cause fear in the crowd. Instead, it caused them to burst into laughter.

“How arrogant! What, are you threatening us?”

“Kill us without mercy? Do you know who we are? Do you know what will happen if any of us die?”

“How arrogant! After killing Old Mister Yan, he still dares to come to the Yan family to make a ruckus. He really doesn’t know his place!”

His words aroused the anger of the crowd. It seemed that everyone regarded Qin Yu as an enemy.

Qin Yu didn’t care. He wasn’t from this circle to begin with, so how could he be accepted?

After experiencing so much, Qin Yu had already understood.

Right or wrong wasn’t important at all. What was important was the division of interests.

Qin Yu turned around and was about to find a seat to sit down.

At this moment, he suddenly noticed the Pavilion Master sitting there.

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment before he hurriedly walked over.

“Lord Pavilion Master, why are you here?” Qin Yu said with some surprise.

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “You are an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Naturally, I have to come.”

Although these words sounded matter-of-fact, the meaning was profound.

The Pavilion Master was clearly here to cover for Qin Yu.

This also made Qin Yu extremely touched.

“Lord Pavilion Master, I...”

“There’s no need to say words of gratitude.” The Pavilion Master interrupted Qin Yu’s words.

Qin Yu nodded his head vigorously. After she had helped him time and time again, Qin Yu had already treated the Pavilion Master as his family.

Sitting here, Qin Yu could clearly feel that there were countless murderous internal qis coming towards him from the dark.

“There are quite a few people who want to kill me today,” Qin Yu said coldly as he took a sip of tea.

The Pavilion Master said, “It’s best to be careful. After all, you are facing two aristocratic families.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand, Pavilion Master.”

Time flew by. After Qin Yu arrived, the atmosphere at the scene had become somewhat tense. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The seats that Qin Yu and the Pavilion Master were sitting near were empty. No one was willing to get close to them.

“That ungrateful beast has the nerve to sit there,” someone cursed in the dark.

“Old Mister Yan has done him a favor, but he did such a disgraceful thing. He deserves to be killed.”

Qin Yu completely ignored the curses of the crowd.

He drank his tea silently and said in a low voice, “The truth will come out sooner or later.”

Time passed minute by second. Very soon, it was 11:30 am.

Qin Yu sat there with his eyes slightly narrowed. There wasn’t the slightest hint of panic on his face.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt an extremely familiar internal qi!

He suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the Bentley that was slowly approaching from the distance!

The front of the car was covered with red flowers. When the car door opened, he saw Yan Ruoxue in a wedding dress!

“Ruoxue!”

Qin Yu suddenly stood up!

Yan Ruoxue also looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

“Qin Yu...” she whispered Qin Yu’s name, and a smile couldn’t help but appear on her face.

Qin Yu couldn’t care about anything else anymore. He strode in Yan Ruoxue’s direction.

“Qin Yu, don’t be rash,” the Pavilion Master said with a frown.

However, how could Qin Yu listen to her? He strode towards Yan Ruoxue.

“What are you trying to do?”

Two half-step Martial Marquises immediately blocked Qin Yu’s path.

“What? Are you trying to kidnap the bride in broad daylight?” The two people said coldly.

“Get lost!”

Qin Yu roared and his internal qi exploded!

The two half-step Martial Marquises were immediately forced back!

“Stop him!”

Han Meng shouted from above!

Instantly, countless martial artists stood up and blocked Qin Yu’s path!

Over ten martial artists blocked Qin Yu’s path!

Among them were Inner Strength Grandmasters, half-step Martial Marquises, and there was no lack of Martial Marquises!

Qin Yu coldly glanced at everyone and said word by word, “I told you all to scram.”

“Qin Yu, this originally had nothing to do with us, but you’re too arrogant. We really can’t stand it anymore.”

“That’s right. Miss Yan and Young Master Han are a match made in heaven. Don’t you find it shameful to interfere?”

“If you dare to take another step forward, don’t blame us for being impolite!”

Qin Yu glared at everyone and said word by word, “I told you to get lost!”

As Qin Yu spoke, golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body! A terrifying force instantly rolled over!

After they sensed Qin Yu’s internal qi, their expressions couldn’t help but change!

This internal qi was too powerful!

Was this really the internal qi of a half-step Martial Marquis?!

“Qin Yu, do you really think you are invincible?” The Martial Marquis took a step forward and said indifferently.

This person’s surname was Bai, and the people gave him the title: Martial Marquis Bai Wu.

Martial Marquis Bai Wu was extremely strong, so he wasn’t afraid of Qin Yu at all.

However, Qin Yu was also unafraid of him, even though he knew he wasn’t a match for him.

“Get lost!” Qin Yu roared angrily, and a golden light instantly appeared before heading straight for Martial Marquis Bai Wu!

Martial Marquis Bai Wu snorted coldly. “You’re too brazen!”

He waved his large palm and met Qin Yu’s fist!

After all, Martial Marquis Bai Wu was a veteran marquis, so how could Qin Yu be his opponent?

From this attack, Qin Yu took a few steps back, and his fists felt pain!

Martial Marquis Bai Wu didn’t stop at this point. He grabbed Qin Yu, and with a terrifying force, he pressed Qin Yu to the ground!

“You don’t know your place. How dare you attack a Martial Marquis?” Martial Marquis Bai Wu said coldly.

The people around him shouted, “Martial Marquis Bai Wu, teach him a lesson!”

“Martial Marquis Bai Wu, we can’t let this kid off the hook.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He summoned the spiritual power in his body, and a huge force burst out!

Even Martial Marquis Bai Wu’s expression changed for a moment. He only felt waves of numbness in his palm, as if he could not hold him down anymore!

“Pa!”

At this moment, a loud slap sounded!

He saw that Yan Ruoxue was already standing in front of Qin Yu.

Her force wasn’t strong, but it landed firmly on Martial Marquis Bai Wu’s face.

“Let him go,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

Martial Marquis Bai Wu opened his mouth and explained, “Miss Yan, I...”

“I told you to let him go!” Yan Ruoxue didn’t say another word and gave Martial Marquis Bai Wu another clear slap on the face!

Martial Marquis Bai Wu gritted his teeth and could only unwillingly let him go.

After all, Yan Ruoxue was the eldest daughter of the Yan family. Even if he was a Martial Marquis, he could only endure it.

“Qin Yu, how are you?” Yan Ruoxue helped Qin Yu up gently.

His expression, which was as cold as ice a moment ago, now had a beautiful smile.
