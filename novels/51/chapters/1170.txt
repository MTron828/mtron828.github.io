Chapter 1171: Chapter 1,171, Stray Dog 

The picture was emitting a strong radiance, as if it was fighting against the iron rod on its own!

The Iron Rod was still dark. Ever since it left Gu Xinghe’s hands, it had become even dimmer, no longer capable of fighting.

Even though it was still emitting internal QI, it did not have any intention of attacking.

The picture was in a stalemate in the air for a long time, and the radiance was getting brighter and brighter. Streams of internal Qi filled the entire battlefield.

Qin Yu got up from the ground. He did not care about the pain on his body. He raised his head to look at the strange scene.

“Now is the perfect opportunity!”

Qin Yu suddenly realized something!

This iron rod could sweep through everything in the world. However, it was not an item from Gu Xinghe. Instead, it was an ownerless item.

After it was taken out of his hands, there was no longer any will to fight. In other words, whoever got it would get it!

Qin Yu did not dare to think too much. He stepped on the ‘walking’spell and instantly appeared in front of the Iron Rod!

While everyone was still in shock, Qin Yu had already stretched out his golden palm and grabbed the iron rod!

“This thing is mine!”Qin Yu grabbed the iron rod and shouted!

The iron rod did not feel out of place in Qin Yu’s hand, nor did he have any intention of resisting. It looked just like an ordinary iron rod.

However, the picture seemed different. At this moment, it seemed like it had come back to life on its own, flickering with an astonishing radiance.

Qin Yu grabbed the iron rod and raised his head to look at the picture. He could not help but frown slightly.

He tried to put the picture back into the spatial artifact, but he failed.

The power that emanated from the picture was not something Qin Yu could resist at all!

The painting stopped in the air for a long time. After a moment, it turned into a streak of light and disappeared into the horizon.

Qin Yu was unwilling to give up and wanted to chase it back. Unfortunately, even though Qin Yu was using the ‘walking’character, he could not catch up at all. In a short moment, it disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu just stood in the air and looked at the direction where the painting had left for a long time.

“Strange, why did it suddenly run away?”Qin Yu frowned.

Could it be that he had gone to find his real master?

However, the painting had been silent in Qin Yu’s spatial artifact for a long time. Why would it suddenly resurrect itself?

Could it be because of this iron rod?

What was the origin of this iron rod?

For a moment, Qin Yu couldn’t figure it out. He only felt that his head was swelling.

“I don’t care.”Qin Yu grabbed the iron rod. The most important thing now was to get rid of this villain, Gu Xinghe.

Gu Xinghe was already heavily injured, and under the collision of the two divine weapons, he was on the verge of death.

He struggled to get up from the ground. Just as he was about to speak, Qin Yu struck him in the head with the rod.

The power of the iron rod in Qin Yu’s hand was even more terrifying. With one strike of the rod, Gu Xinghe’s bones were shattered.

He fell heavily to the ground, and his mouth kept making weird sounds, as if he was expressing his unwillingness.

Qin Yu pointed the iron rod at Gu Xinghe and sneered, “Gu Xinghe, it’s time for you to pay the price for what you’ve done.”

Then, Qin Yu hit Gu Xinghe’s Dantian with the rod.

His dantian shattered, and Gu Xinghe’s internal Qi quickly disappeared.

This action was equivalent to crippling Gu Xinghe, but it was not as complete as crippling him.

As long as his primordial spirit was not dead, he could still recover with a certain amount of time.

Su Qi saw that things were not going well and turned around to run.

However, a figure blocked Su Qi’s path.

That person was none other than Yan Yongfu.

He stood in front of Su Qi and said indifferently, “Su Qi, where are you going?”

Su Qi’s face darkened and she said coldly, “Yan Yongfu, get out of my way!”

“Get Out of my way? Do you think you can leave today?”Yan Yongfu said indifferently.

“You and Gu Xinghe are in cahoots. Today, you will die as well!”

Yan Yongfu was filled with righteous indignation and awe-inspiring righteousness. Of course, he did not do this for the sake of justice in his heart. He wanted to use this opportunity to curry favor with Qin Yu so that he would not get himself killed.

“Whoosh!”

Qin Yu took a step forward and struck Su Qi’s waist. With a crisp sound, Su Qi’s waist was directly smashed into pieces, and even his spine was split open at this moment. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The pain caused Su Qi’s originally pretty face to become a little twisted.

However, at this moment, she couldn’t care less about the pain. Instead, she begged bitterly, “Qin Yu, spare me. I’m willing to do anything for you, as long as you let me live...”

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered, “Stop Dreaming. Save your strength.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned to look at ye Qing.

He quickly walked in front of ye Qing. Without waiting for Qin Yu to speak, ye Qing said, “I want to take these two away. They have done many evil deeds. I have to give everyone an explanation.”

Qin Yu said, “I know. Otherwise, I would have killed them long ago.”

Ye Qing was stunned. Then, he cupped his hands and said, “Thank you.”

Qin Yu pointed at the two people on the ground and said, “Although their cultivation has been temporarily crippled, I’m afraid you won’t be able to kill them.”

After all, these were two mighty figures. Ordinary Bullets wouldn’t be able to hurt them.

Following that, Qin Yu walked in front of the two people. He raised his finger and a thread of light entered their minds.

This was a mark of self-destruction. The Mark had entered the primordial spirit. As long as one’s mind moved, the primordial spirit would explode.

After doing all this, Qin Yu looked at ye Qing and said, “Take these two people with you.”

“Thank you.”Ye Qing cupped his hands.

He picked up the two people and planned to leave.

“In three days, I will publicly execute the two people in the discussion martial arts hall. You can go with me.”At this moment, ye Qing suddenly said.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Okay, I’ll go.”

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, Gu Xinghe, who was almost half dead, suddenly roared angrily.

He glared at Qin Yu and said, “You killed me! I will never allow myself to die in the hands of these ants!”

Qin Yu could not help but sneer, “You killed so many innocent ordinary people, so you should be judged by ordinary people.”
