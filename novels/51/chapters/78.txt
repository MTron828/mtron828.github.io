Chapter 79: Are You Sure You Want to Fight Me? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Gao Tingting quickly ran in front of Li Yan, pointed at him and cursed, “You want to leave after beating him? In your dreams!”

Li Yan’s expression was livid. He suppressed his anger and said, “I don’t want to tangle with you. You’d better stay away from me.”

“Who wants to tangle with you?” Gao Tingting crossed her arms and sneered.

“Let me tell you, you guys beat up Brother Boar, so no one can leave here today!” Gao Tingting’s tone sounded smug.

Just as Gao Tingting said, seven to eight burly men walked over from not far away.

And these seven to eight burly men were all fighters of this underground boxing ring. Each of them had extraordinary combat strength.

Li Yan gritted his teeth. He pointed at Gao Tingting and cursed, “Why are you so shameless?! You clearly did something wrong, yet now you’re actually troubling me?”

“Cut the crap!” Gao Tingting snorted. “You have to bear the consequences!”

Li Yan looked at the cold woman in front of him. For a moment, he was in a daze.

The scene mirrored that of when Qin Yu was kicked out of his house.

“Gao Tingting.” Li Yan took a deep breath.

He said with some pleading, “For the sake of our past relationship, can you let my friends go first?”

“Let your friends go first?” Gao Tingting sneered.

“Okay, then kneel down and beg me. Maybe I can be merciful and let your friends go,” Gao Tingting said with amusement while fiddling with her short skirt.

Li Yan was stunned. He glared at Gao Tingting while wishing he could give her two big slaps.

But in the end, Li Yan still forced a smile.

He said slowly, “Okay, I’ll agree to it.”

After saying that, Li Yan bent his knees and was about to kneel on the ground.

At this moment, a hand grabbed his arm.

Looking up, he saw Qin Yu staring at him. He shook his head and said, “Not long ago, I was the same as you. I thought I could get forgiveness from others that way, but I found out later that it wasn’t the case.”

“The weaker you are, the more you will be bullied. In the eyes of others, your pleas will only make you a laughing stock,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

Li Yan looked up at Qin Yu and was instantly persuaded.

“Who the f * ck are you? It’s none of your business! I...” Gao Tingting ran forward aggressively.

“Slap!”

Before Gao Tingting could finish her words, Qin Yu slapped her in the face.

This slap made Gao Tingting turn 360 degrees on the spot, and she plopped down on the ground.

This was the first time Qin Yu had hit a woman. Although he didn’t kill her, he still made half of Gao Tingting’s face swollen.

“Noisy thing,” Qin Yu said to Gao Tingting coldly.

The surrounding boxers immediately walked toward Qin Yu. They surrounded Qin Yu in the middle and said coldly, “Kid, it seems that you really don’t want to walk out of here.”

Yao Qing hurriedly took a step forward and asked in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, I’ll take care of them for you right now.”

“Yo, there’s actually someone who dares to cause trouble here?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the crowd.

Turning around, they saw a man wearing a black shirt slowly walking over.

This man was about 1.8 meters tall. Although he looked quite skinny, his footsteps were extremely steady. One could tell that he was obviously a martial artist.

His appearance immediately caused a commotion.

“Brother Mang, you’re here.” The fighters opened a path for him and looked at him respectfully.

The man called Brother Mang walked straight to Yao Qing and said indifferently, “You’re quite the fighter, aren’t you?”

Yao Qing narrowed his eyes and said, “Finally, there is an inner strength master. Unfortunately, you’re only a fifth stage inner strength master. That’s not worth mentioning.”

“Huh? You know about inner strength?” Brother Mang asked in shock.

Yao Qing ignored Brother Mang. He leaned towards Qin Yu’s ear and said, “This person is only a fifth stage inner strength master. I can easily deal with him.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Then do it as soon as possible. Don’t waste time.”

“Yes, Mr. Qin.” Yao Qing nodded.

At this moment, Gao Tingting suddenly rushed over.

She ran to Brother Mang’s side and said angrily, “Brother Mang, they beat up Brother Boar. You must teach them a good lesson!”

Brother Mang glanced at Gao Tingting and said with some displeasure, “You only know how to cause trouble! You’ll pay for Brother Boar’s medical expenses.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although Gao Tingting was unwilling, she didn’t dare to refuse, so she hurriedly nodded and said, “I understand, Brother Mang.”

After saying that, Gao Tingting retreated to the side.

Then, Yao Qing quickly walked to Brother Mang’s side. He rubbed his fist and said, “Let’s do it. Mr. Qin said that he doesn’t want to delay for too long.”

Brother Mang glanced at Yao Qing and sneered as he said, “You’re a bodyguard. I don’t want to fight with you.”

After saying that, Brother Mang walked directly to Qin Yu.

He looked down at Qin Yu and said, “This was caused by you, right? Did you order your man to injure Brother Boar?”

Qin Yu looked at Brother Mang and couldn’t help but frown. “What are you bulshi*tting about? Can you be more direct?”

Brother Mang narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Since you ordered it, you should bear the responsibility! Of course, I’m not an unreasonable person. Let’s meet in the arena.”

Qin Yu froze. He scratched his head and said, “You want to fight with me?”

Brother Mang sneered. “Why? You don’t have the guts?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at Brother Mang with some amusement and said, “Are you sure you want to fight with me?”
