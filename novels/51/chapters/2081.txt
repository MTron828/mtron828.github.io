2082 Jue Wu and Xiao Hai

The moment the True Saint raised his hand, the surrounding space began to distort. Jue Wu’s body also felt tremendous pressure!

She resisted with all her might, but it was in vain. Even with the power of the purple cloud pearl, she could not resist this terrifying pressure!

Jue Wu’s petite body was being compressed continuously, and cracking sounds could be heard from all over her body. Blood kept coming out from her skin pores, and her consciousness began to fall into a trance!

“This old b*stard…” Jue Wu was cursing non-stop but had no way to resist. She could only watch as her body was about to be crushed!

At this moment, Jue Wu suddenly remembered what Qin Yu had told her.

“Take out the demonic egg to resist if you encounter a powerful enemy!”

Thinking of this, Jue Wu could not care less to think further. With a thought, she took out the demonic egg and held it in her palm!

The demonic egg was shining with a tremendous demonic light, and all kinds of mysterious colors were flowing on it.

“I’m sorry, Eggy, I can only take you out first…” Jue Wu said guiltily.

Although the demonic egg was incomparably mysterious, it could not withstand the pressure of the True Saint and began to tremble.

Jue Wu felt that something was wrong!

Could it be that this old b*stard wanted to crush the demonic egg as well?

Jue Wu gritted her teeth and immediately planned to put away the demonic egg.

However, at this moment, a sharp light flashed past. Immediately after, the pressure on Jue Wu’s body disappeared!

“Hmm?” Jue Wu was startled. She touched her body and muttered, “It really disappeared?”

Jue Wu had no idea what was going on. However, the True Saint frowned.

He looked coldly at the back of Jue Wu and said, “Who are you? Are you interfering in the Si family’s affairs?”

Jue Wu was startled. She hurriedly turned her head and saw a woman in white wearing a mask behind her.

Jue Wu was shocked. She said in a daze, “Who are you?”

Naturally, Xiao Yu ignored Jue Wu. She did not say a word and just looked at the True Saint coldly.

“Do you really intend to interfere in the matters of my Si family? Do you know what it means when the Si family is enraged?” the True Saint continued to shout.

Xiao Yu remained silent and stood there quietly.

Xiao Yu did not say anything. She also slowly raised her delicate hand to receive the True Saint’s palm!

“Boom!”

A loud bang instantly rang out at this moment. The void shattered, and the terrifying rumble swept and leveled everything in the surroundings!

The True Saint staggered back a few steps and felt a slight pain in his palm.

He looked at Xiao Yu in shock and whispered, “Is this person also a True Saint?”

Although the two had only exchanged one palm strike, he knew very well that if he were not a True Saint, this palm strike would have turned him into meat paste!

“If I don’t burn my blood essence, I’m afraid I’m no match for this person,” the True Saint thought to himself.

Thinking of this, the True Saint immediately shouted, “You’re indeed very capable, and I have experienced it myself. I hope I can learn from you if there is a chance in the future!”

After saying this, the True Saint turned around and left without looking back.

Jue Wu looked at Xiao Yu and said excitedly, “You’re so powerful! You actually forced him back with one palm! Speaking of which, who are you? Why are you helping me?”

Xiao Yu looked at Jue Wu and said coldly, “Take good care of the demonic egg.”

Jue Wu wanted to say something, but Xiao Yu had already disappeared.

At the Crimson Moon Continent, the most unique and backward place in the Holy Region. It neither had the prosperity of Zhongzhou nor the spiritual energy of Nanzhou. The indigenous people here were relatively weak.

Even under the Golden Age, the spiritual energy in the Crimson Moon Continent was still pathetically thin.

This place was full of deserts and incomparably hot. Ever-burning volcanos were everywhere on the continent, and the scenery was incredibly unique.

At this moment, a tall and disheveled hair man was walking on this continent.

However, not long after he walked, he suddenly stopped and took a deep breath.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the void in front of him suddenly trembled, and three people suddenly walked out.

Among the three, the person leading was a True Saint, while the other two were at the peak of the Semi-Saint and were about to touch the realm of True Saint.

“Xiao Hai, where do you want to escape?” the True Saint leading the group said calmly.

There was no fear on Xiao Hai’s face. He smiled and said, “You guys are indeed persistent.”

“Do you think you can escape from us?” the True Saint smiled faintly and said.

Xiao Hai’s internal qi began to surge. It was as if streams of dao techniques flowed around his body like swimming dragons.

Seeing the scene, the few people’s eyes emitted a trace of admiration

Even the True Saint could not help but sigh. “You’re only at the Reversion Void Stage, but you’ve already comprehended the dao to such an extent. How terrifying! Given time, you’ll have a place in the Holy Region or even the entire cultivation world.”

“Stop talking nonsense,” Xiao Hai shouted coldly.

“You are not my match,” the True Saint shook his head and said.

Xiao Hai said, “Although you are a True Saint, I, Xiao Hai, will never sit still and wait for death!”

“If I attack, you will die here today,” the True Saint said coldly.

Xiao Hai said frankly and straightforwardly, “A true man is born between heaven and earth. How can he fear life and death?”

This True Saint was still reluctant to give up. He looked at Xiao Hai and said, “This matter originally has nothing to do with you. Everything originated from Qin Yu. If you are willing to cut ties with Qin Yu, my Si family might let you go and even invite you to join my Si family.”

“I, Xiao Hai, am not someone who seeks glory! Do it!” Xiao Hai shouted.

The True Saint lost his patience. He looked at Xiao Hai coldly and said in a low voice, “What a stubborn thing! In that case, I can’t spare you. Otherwise, you’ll become a big problem for my Si family in the future!”

After saying that, he suddenly struck out, his palm fiercely slapping toward Xiao Hai!

At this moment, Xiao Hai’s body erupted with a terrifying internal qi like a tidal wave! Countless internal qi and dao techniques condensed, and the internal qi that was like a true dragon around his body actually condensed!

After that, Xiao Hai pushed out his hands, and 18 true dragons appeared on his body, each emitting a terrifying internal qi!

At this moment, Xiao Hai’s strength shocked everyone!
