Chapter 548: Spiritual Energy Gap Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Before Qin Yu could say anything, Zhen Yue yelled coldly, “Get out of here!”

Qin Yu didn’t care.

He came here for the lake.

Since they didn’t believe him, he might as well go and explore it himself.

Qin Yu stood up and walked out of the office.

A voice came from behind, “So that guy is an imposter. I really thought he was Qin Yu.”

“He looks shady. He doesn’t seem like a good person.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. He never thought that his current fame would be so great. There were even imposters.

Of course, this was also a good thing.

This was enough to show that Qin Yu’s appeal was absolutely beyond imagination.

He once again came to the front of the lake and felt the faint spiritual energy coming from the lake.

For Qin Yu, the most important thing was to improve his cultivation as soon as possible and step into the Martial Marquis Realm.

“Once I step into the Martial Marquis Realm, I will definitely go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association personally to ask for her.” Qin Yu secretly made up his mind.

Then, Qin Yu walked around the lake water and went all the way to the gap.

All the lake water flowed in through the gap.

Looking through the gap, he saw a small stream.

Qin Yu stood beside the stream. He bent down and took a sip of the stream water.

Sure enough, the spiritual energy was a little thicker than before.

Qin Yu followed the stream all the way. Soon, Qin Yu realized that something was wrong.

The stream was circular, and its water flowed into the lake.

In other words, this was a pool of stagnant water!

“Strange.” Qin Yu’s frown deepened.

He stood on the edge of the lake and said in a low voice, “Could the secret be under the water?”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately jumped into the lake.

After diving into the lake, Qin Yu was surprised to find that the pressure below had suddenly become much stronger, and the spiritual energy had also become denser!

The lake water was much deeper than he had imagined. After diving for dozens of meters, Qin Yu finally came to the bottom of the water!

It was dark under the water. Qin Yu used the secret art of water avoidance, then used the spiritual fire to explore.

Soon, he found something strange!

There was a huge gap in the ground under the water!

All the spiritual energy was emitted from this gap!

Qin Yu hurried over. He tried to pry open the gap, but he found that the gap was extremely hard!

Qin Yu immediately activated his inner strength and threw a punch!

Unfortunately, the hardness of this gap was far beyond Qin Yu’s imagination. He couldn’t even shake it!

“What a hard stone!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be shocked!

He sat cross-legged under the water and felt the surging spiritual energy.

The gap was sometimes big and sometimes small, and the surging spiritual energy was sometimes thick and sometimes thin.

Qin Yu’s eyes sparkled, and he was a little excited for a moment!

“This is the spiritual energy formed naturally by nature!” Qin Yu was extremely excited!

In other words, this spiritual energy was the purest and it was natural!

It was unlike herbs. Even ten-thousand-year-old herbs could only be used to store spiritual energy.

And this spiritual energy hadn’t been contaminated in the slightest, and there were no impurities in it. It was no different from natural spiritual energy!

“In this environment, there is actually such a bountiful spiritual energy gap!” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with excitement.

Then, what exactly was under this gap? Could it be a world where the spiritual energy hadn’t yet dissipated? It was unimaginable!

“With such a gap, the spiritual energy is probably endless!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He didn’t waste any time and immediately sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the spiritual energy underwater.

Because Qin Yu was near the gap, the spiritual energy that was spewed out was absorbed by Qin Yu at the first moment!

Above, no one in Beaufort Tower knew that Qin Yu was underwater.

In the evening, many ordinary civilians appeared beside the lake.

They were holding buckets and drawing water from the lake.

At this moment, Zhen Yue accompanied the imposter to the lakeside.

“What’s going on?” The imposter asked with a frown. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Zhen Yue smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, you don’t know that the water here has a miraculous effect. More than half of the people of Jade City will come here to draw water.”

The impostor asked in puzzlement, “Miraculous effect? What kind of miraculous effect?”

“It can cure diseases,” Zhen Yue said with a smile.

“Miss Zhen.” As they spoke, the people who came to fetch water greeted Zhen Yue one after another.

Zhen Yue also responded with a smile.

The impostor didn’t ask any more questions. He looked at Zhen Yue and said with a smile, “Sect Master Zhen, the conditions you mentioned before are all true, right?”

Zhen Yue couldn’t help but blush at the mention of this topic.

She bit her lips and said, “Of course it’s true. As long as I can keep the Beaufort Tower, I’ll agree to it.”

The imposter was delighted and said impatiently, “Sect Master Zhen, it’s getting late. Why don’t we go to bed early?”

“So early?” Zhen Yue couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed.

The impostor chuckled and said, “I’m sleepy now. Let’s go.”

With that, the impostor stretched out his hand to pull Zhen Yue.

Zhen Yue resisted a little, but for the sake of the Beaufort Tower, she could only grit her teeth and follow the impostor.

“Sect Master Zhen, something bad has happened!”

At this moment, a few people ran over.

Zhen Yue frowned and said, “What’s the matter? Why are you so flustered?”

“Wang... Wang Xiong and the others are here!”

When she heard the name Wang Xiong, Zhen Yue’s expression immediately turned ugly.

Over the past few days, Wang Xiong had taken a liking to the Beaufort Tower and had forced Zhen Yue to hand it over many times.

Wang Xiong was a tyrant in this area and possessed immense power. Most importantly, he had the Saint Confucian Sect backing him!

Zhen Yue was a woman, so she was no match for Wang Xiong.

She tried to ask many people for help, but when they heard Wang Xiong’s name, they all refused.

In desperation, Zhen Yue thought of Qin Yu!

In her opinion, perhaps only Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of the Saint Confucian Sect behind Wang Xiong!

“Don’t worry, we have Mr. Qin here. If Wang Xiong comes, he will definitely die!” Someone said from the side.

Zhen Yue also looked at the imposter and said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, please.”

The imposter’s expression darkened and he couldn’t help but curse inside, “D*mn it, didn’t they say that he would come tomorrow? Why is he here so early?”

Although he thought so, he couldn’t back down now. The imposter could only try to ask, “What’s Wang Xiong’s cultivation base?”

Zhen Yue bit her lips and said in a low voice, “He’s a half-step Martial Marquis who used to belong to the Saint Confucian Sect.”

When he heard the words ‘half-step Martial Marquis’, the impostor’s expression darkened!

“A half-step Martial Marquis is nothing but bullsh*t! He’s nothing in front of Mr. Qin!” The person next to him shouted.

After saying that, he looked at the impostor and said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, don’t you agree?”

The impostor cursed inside while thinking of how to escape.

“A half-step Martial Marquis is nothing but bullsh*t? Who’s talking nonsense?” However, at this time, Wang Xiong’s voice came from not far away.
