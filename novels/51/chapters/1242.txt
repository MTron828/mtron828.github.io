Chapter 1243: Chapter 1,243 was truly a genius! 

Jiang Yi glared at Qin Yu. The anger that he had accumulated over the years had completely exploded at this moment!

However, Qin Yu still didn’t seem to be sad or happy. He was unmoved.

This was undoubtedly a humiliation to Jiang Yi!

With a loud shout, the veins on his body were instantly exposed!

Numerous blood vessels were like dragons that coiled around his arms. His body was emitting a faint radiance that reflected his strong body.

“I know that your body is strong, but I’m not weak either!”Jiang Yi shouted.

“A few days ago, I strengthened my body. My realm is higher than yours. My body has already stepped into the realm of a mighty figure. My body is stronger than yours!”

After saying that, Jiang Yi did not use any spells. Instead, his fist was aimed at Qin Yu’s face!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He could not help but let out a long sigh in his heart as he faced the fist that was approaching him.

“Bang!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly made a move and grabbed Jiang Yi’s fist. The extremely fast speed shocked everyone!

At the same time, Qin Yu’s other hand also clenched into a fist. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of Jiang Yi’s face!

All of this happened in an instant. No one could react in time!

Even Jiang Yi, who was already half a step into the mighty realm, was the same!

He felt as if his face was being crazily torn apart by some kind of force, as if it was about to be torn apart!

And this inexplicable force was actually Qin Yu’s fist wind!

Qin Yu’s fist stopped one centimeter in front of Jiang Yi.

On the other hand, Jiang Yi’s fist was caught by Qin Yu’s hand, and all the force was dissolved.

The scene was silent, and one could hear the sound of gasps from time to time.

The gap between the two was too big!

“Could it be that... Qin Yu has long surpassed a mighty figure?”Someone exclaimed in his heart.

A half-step mighty figure was actually so weak in front of Qin Yu. This made everyone doubt Qin Yu’s strength.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Jiang Yi in front of him and said, “I could have killed you just now.”

That’s right. If this punch landed on Jiang Yi’s face, his entire head and even his primordial spirit would probably be smashed into pieces!

Jiang Yi’s heart was filled with endless fear. Although he was unwilling to admit it, Qin Yu was telling the truth!

“I don’t want to kill you. It’s still not too late for you to leave now.”Qin Yu let go of Jiang Yi’s fist.

Jiang Yi took the opportunity to shoot backward.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly, his face gloomy and uncertain.

Obviously, his judgment was wrong.

Qin Yu’s physical body was much stronger than he had imagined.

“Phew.”Jiang Yi let out a long breath.

“Why do I need to use my weakness to clash with his strength?”Jiang Yi quickly convinced himself.

Since his physical body couldn’t compete with Qin Yu, he should grasp the distance.

“Qin Yu, I will definitely kill you today.”Jiang Yi took a deep breath.

He no longer wanted to compete with Qin Yu’s physical body. Instead, he planned to use a spell to kill Qin Yu.

“Buzz!”

Rays of light gathered in his palm.

The precious light shone brightly.

It was as if he was brewing an extraordinary spell.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry either. He was just about to test the strength of his physical body.

“Great Flame Ghost Blade!”

Jiang Yi roared and a huge blade appeared in the sky. It came at an extremely fast speed!

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the spell. There was still no expression on his face.

He placed his hands behind his back and waited quietly for the blade to come.

“Boom!”

A loud sound exploded at this moment.

In an instant, gravel flew everywhere, turning everything around into a hornet’s nest.

However, such a spell couldn’t hurt Qin Yu at all.

His body looked like an ordinary body, but it was so tough that it made people gulp.

“Not even a white scar was left...”

Jiang Yi, who was not far away, also frowned.

The toughness of such a body was beyond his knowledge.

It didn’t make sense.

“How can this be?”Jiang Yi frowned and thought to himself.

Qin Yu’s newly-grown hair was blown into a frenzy.

He looked at Jiang Yi, who was standing on the high ground, and said, “Do you still want to continue?”

Jiang Yi sneered, “Do you think this is the end? This is just the beginning!”

“I’ll show you the spell I created now!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Okay, I’m looking forward to it.”

“Great Blast Spell!”

Jiang Yi roared and pointed his arms at Qin Yu. Then, countless spells burst out from his palms!

In the blink of an eye, Jiang Yi had cast 38 spells!

One had to know that even a mighty realm cultivator would never do this.

This was because the consumption of spiritual power was too great. Even if he could kill the other party, he would be exhausted.

To be able to cast so many spells in an instant shocked everyone.

The scene was filled with smoke, as if a great battle had taken place.

Under the bombardment of these thirty-eight spells, spots of scars finally appeared on Qin Yu’s body.

However, these scars were not serious and did not hurt his foundation.

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at the wounds on his body and said with admiration, “Not bad. In the current era, there are very few who can hurt my body. You can even be said to be the only one.”

Jiang Yi could not help but secretly clench his teeth.

Under such indiscriminate bombardment, even a mighty figure would be blasted into pieces!

However, Qin Yu had only left behind some innocuous wounds.

“Why is his physical body... so powerful?”Jiang Yi couldn’t help but frown.

“I’m afraid that Jiang Yi is already exhausted,”someone said from the shadows.

“He’s too anxious. There’s a problem with his strategy.”

“That’s right. Although such indiscriminate bombardment is powerful, it consumes too much spirit energy.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu had the same judgment in his heart.

He had experienced countless battles, big and small, and no one had ever fought in such a way.

Even mighty figures couldn’t do it.

“Let’s go. You are a genius, but... you are not my match.”Qin Yu shook his head and said.

A trace of coldness appeared on Jiang Yi’s face.

He sneered and said, “If I didn’t have the confidence, I wouldn’t have abused spells like this.”

“Qin Yu, I’ll let you see so for myself! See so for myself!”

After saying that, Jiang Yi took a deep breath. The pores all over his body opened and his eyes closed slightly.

A moment later, wisps of light attacked Jiang Yi from all directions.

It seemed to be spiritual Qi that was crazily rushing into Jiang Yi’s body.
