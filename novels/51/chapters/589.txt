Chapter 590: Inner Core! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As Yan Guiyi recited the spell, rays of light suddenly lit up on everyone’s wrists!

Then, the runes on the bracelet began to emit a dense power that covered everyone’s bodies!

In an instant, an extremely terrifying power pressed down on their bodies! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Not only that, but that power seemed to be able to corrode people’s divine sense and cause their heads to rumble!

“Ah!!!!”

In an instant, everyone in the bottom class felt as if they had received a tremendous force and were wailing incessantly.

They fell to the ground and rolled around non-stop to alleviate the pain.

Even Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly, but he didn’t say a word while enduring the pain with all his might.

“Hmph, you don’t know your place.” Yan Guiyi placed his hands behind his back while sneering.

“This is the consequence of resisting! What a bunch of ants. Do you really think you’re some kind of genius?”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. As he looked at the pained expressions on everyone’s faces, a wave of anger rose from the bottom of his heart.

Qin Yu forcefully endured the pain as he held a golden light in his hand and walked toward Yan Guiyi step by step!

“Huh?” Yan Guiyi raised his eyebrows, then sneered. “As expected of someone who forced his way up the stairway to heaven. You can even withstand this?”

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu roared. He endured the pain and clenched his fist as he charged at Yan Guiyi!

However, Qin Yu’s body was in pain and his internal qi was less than that of one-tenth of his full strength. How could he hurt Yan Guiyi?

Yan Guiyi waved his hand and sent Qin Yu flying!

“You dare to fight with me?” Yan Guiyi walked toward Qin Yu.

Internal qi burst out from his hand, and a sharp blade condensed in his palm.

“Since you are so disobedient, I will kill all of you,” Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes and said.

“Captain Yan.”

At this moment, Yao Meng suddenly walked out.

She smiled and said, “Mr. Yan, even if they are at fault, they don’t deserve to die. Your casual and indiscriminate killing will arouse everyone’s dissatisfaction.”

Yan Guiyi frowned slightly. Just as he was about to speak, Xiao Yuan also walked over from the side.

“Miss Yao is right, Mr. Yan. It’ll make people think that you are abusing your power to seek revenge for personal matters,” Xiao Yuan said with a smile.

Yan Guiyi’s frown deepened. He took a deep breath, then snorted softly and withdrew his power.

Everyone was able to breathe again, but their faces were extremely pale.

Yan Guiyi, on the other hand, was a little unhappy.

He had thought that he could do whatever he wanted on this island, but he had never expected that these people weren’t as simple as he had imagined.

“On account of Miss Yao and Young Master Xiao, I will forgive you guys this time,” Yan Guiyi snorted coldly.

“I’m telling you, on this island, you must listen to my orders. If there’s a next time, I won’t show mercy!”

With that, Yan Guiyi flicked his sleeves and left.

Yao Meng and Xiao Yuan walked to Qin Yu. They helped Qin Yu up and said with a smile, “Are you alright?”

Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead and shook his head. “I’m fine. Thank you both.”

Yao Meng chuckled. “Mr. Qin, you must be joking. Although we aren’t the same kind of people, I believe that no one will agree if Yan Guiyi wants to kill the innocent.”

“That’s right. Even ancient emperors had to find an excuse to kill people.” Xiao Yuan also laughed.

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything more.

He lowered his head and looked at the bracelet in his hand. His expression couldn’t help but turn ugly.

The power of this bracelet was completely beyond his imagination. It was almost impossible to resist it.

“If this continues, I’m afraid I’ll really be at the mercy of others.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Their expressions didn’t look too good.

Although they came from the bottom class, they were all geniuses in their hometowns.

Now that they were being treated like this, how could their pride tolerate it?

“Qin Yu, thank you very much.” Chang Mang also walked forward and said.

Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang and said with a smile, “To be honest, you surprised me.”

Chang Mang snorted, “What’s there to be surprised about? If I was stronger than Yan Guiyi, I definitely would have killed him!”

As he spoke, Chang Mang clenched his fists, and a crimson internal qi ignited once again.

“Speaking of which, your physical body is really surprising,” Qin Yu said after the distance between them decreased.

Chang Mang nodded and said, “Yes, I have been extremely strong since I was young. I also found it strange, until someone said that I had a Saintly Body, then brought me to cultivate.”

“Saintly Body?” A trace of shock flashed across Qin Yu’s face!

Chang Mang was actually a Saintly Body? One had to know that this kind of physique was one of the top physiques in the world!

“In other words... you have that scarlet color is because of your physique?” Qin Yu asked.

“Yes.” Chang Mang nodded.

“In that case, it’s the same as my golden color,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

This also made Qin Yu think of Jiang Gu’s body.

His body was also a Saintly Body, but it didn’t have this scarlet color.

Perhaps it was because that Saintly Body didn’t belong to Jiang Gu.

After this incident, the groups were officially divided.

There was the Jingdu upper-class group led by Yan Jinyao, and the group of commoners led by Qin Yu.

Perhaps it was because of Qin Yu’s strength, but that night, the people of the Jingdu upper-class group didn’t come looking for trouble.

The next day, everyone stood on the beach while waiting for Yan Guiyi’s order.

Yan Guiyi swept his gaze over everyone and coldly said, “Since it’s training, there’s naturally no lack of danger, and on this island, the most important resource is the Demonic Beasts.”

“As long as you kill the Demonic Beasts, you will be able to obtain an inner core. All the inner cores you obtain must be handed over, and they will be distributed by me.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh coldly.

Let Yan Guiyi distribute them? Then wouldn’t the lower class group be reduced to laborers?

The bottom class had always been exploited. Now, they had come to this island, but they were still going to be exploited?

“How interesting.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but snicker to himself.

Yan Guiyi swept his gaze across the crowd. He had his hands behind his back, as if he was silently reciting some kind of spell.

“Soul Guiding Spell. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association actually knows Soul Guiding Spell.” In the dark, He Teng muttered softly.

Back then, He Teng had also used Soul Guiding Spell to summon a dragon spirit, but Yan Guiyi’s Soul Guiding Spell was clearly of a higher level.

As he recited the spell silently, the surface of the sea suddenly churned with huge waves!

Then, a huge Demonic Beast roared and rose!

This Demonic Beast was at least ten meters tall and looked extremely horrifying!

Not only that, but its internal qi was also extremely violent. With just a roar, it shook the ground and caused it to buzz!

For a moment, everyone was frightened by this Demonic Beast!

Yan Guiyi said coldly, “This is a Demonic Beast. Kill it and you will get the inner core.”

“And the inner core of a Demonic Beast is equivalent to the Golden Core in Martial Marquis’s body!”

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed, and a trace of surprise flashed across his face.

It was equivalent to the Golden Core in Martial Marquis’s body? In other words, as long as he killed enough Demonic Beasts, he would have the chance to become a Martial Saint?
