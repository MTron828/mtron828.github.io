Chapter 20: Who’s Trash? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After hearing Su Yan’s words, Zhao Gang could feel exhaustion wearing him down.

He wondered how such an idiot could exist in this world.

Yan Ruoxue stood up suddenly.

She looked at Su Yan with a smile and said in a friendly manner, “What did you just say?”

Su Yan was still without any sense of shame, and she proceeded to say, “I said that Qin Yu is just a...”

”Slap!”

Before Su Yan could finish her sentence, Yan Ruoxue slapped her across the face.

Su Yan’s face instantly flushed and a clear slap mark was visible on her cheek.

”Who gave you the right to judge him?” Yan Ruoxue said in a cold tone of voice.

Su Yan covered her face — she could not believe what was happening.

”You... You slapped me?” Su Yan felt aggrieved and indignant at the same time.

She immediately glanced at Zhao Gang and said furiously, “Honey, she hit me. You have to get revenge for me!”

”Like h*ll I’ll get revenge for you!” Zhao Gang lifted his hand and slapped Su Yan in the face too.

This slap was so vigorous that it shocked Su Yan, who stood there with a dumbfounded expression on her face.

”You stupid b*tch, shut up! Or I’ll rip your mouth off!” Zhao Gang gritted his teeth, feeling a strong urge to tear Su Yan apart.

Then, Zhao Gang kneeled directly in front of Yan Ruoxue and said in a quivering voice, “Yan... Miss Yan, please forgive me. Please forgive me...”

Yan Ruoxue smiled as she tousled her hair and said indifferently, “Is it me you should be apologizing to?”

The implication of this statement was clear — the person they should apologize to is Qin Yu.

Zhao Gang gritted his teeth as he held his glass of wine and said with embarrassment, “Qin Yu, I’m sorry... I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have acted in such a violent manner. I can return Su Yan to you immediately if you want me to!”

Qin Yu felt a little sick in his stomach when he saw Su Yan’s despicable appearance.

He said with a grim expression, “It’s not necessary. You can keep trash like her for yourself.”

”And there’s no need for you to apologize to me. I don’t give a hoot about trivial people like you,” Qin Yu said icily.

When she heard these words, a hint of indignation surfaced on Su Yan’s face. She flushed in embarrassment.

She simply could not believe that Qin Yu, who was sucking up to her a few days ago, despised her so much now,

Qin Yu was obviously a sucker for her. He would come back as soon as she summoned him. What had happened?

Su Yan was baffled.

”Thank you, thank you, I swear I won’t disturb you in the future!” Zhao Gang was bowing profusely and was ecstatic.

After that, he dragged Su Yan with him and left.

After they left, Yan Ruoxue expressed her surprise and said, “Are you going to let them off the hook just like that?”

Qin Yu stared in Su Yan’s direction with a cold expression on his face and said, “No, I will take revenge with my own means.”

Qin Yu was well aware that Yan Ruoxue would make Zhao Gang and Su Yan vanish into thin air if he gave the word.

But Qin Yu did not want that. He wanted to make Su Yan regret it herself!

The banquet ended at 4:00 pm.

The crowd dispersed, and the only person left in the large Yan family manor was Uncle Wu.

Uncle Wu, Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu were sitting at a table sipping tea.

Uncle Wu asked with a smile, “Ruoxue, how is Old Mister Yan doing?”

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “Thanks to you, he’s in good health.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Uncle Wu sighed and said, “I’ve been meaning to visit him, but I simply don’t have any time to do so.”

While the two were chatting, Qin Yu grew worried.

He saw that the black gas in Uncle Wu’s heart had spread.

”Uncle Wu, do you really not feel any discomfort?” Qin Yu could not help but ask.

When he heard this, Uncle Wu’s bright expression instantly darkened.

”Aren’t you tired of saying the same thing?” Uncle Wu scolded furiously.

Qin Yu opened his mouth but could only smile bitterly.

He was aware that regardless of what he said, Uncle Wu would never be convinced.

Therefore, Qin Yu sighed and said, “Uncle Wu, it would be better for you to stay in Jiangcheng for the next few days. If anything happens, you can come to me.”

Uncle Wu snickered coldly as he said, “I don’t think I need anything from someone like you.”

When Qin Yu heard this, he kept silent.

He said goodbye to Yan Ruoxue and left the Yan family manor.

As she stared at Qin Yu’s departing figure, Yan Ruoxue pondered for a moment. Eventually, a rather meaningful smile appeared on her lips.

”Uncle Wu, I suggest that you listen to Qin Yu’s advice,” Yan Ruoxue said as she poured Uncle Wu a cup of tea.

Even though Uncle Wu disliked Qin Yu, he show respect to the face of the Yan family.

Uncle Wu grimaced and said, “Okay, okay, I’ll listen to you this time.”

...

After he left the Yan family manor, Qin Yu headed for the Su family home.

He was going back because he had been preparing medicine for Old Mister Su for the past few days.

The medicine was called Soul Nourishment Pill. Even though it could not resuscitate the dead, it could extend one’s life.

Qin Yu was a person who distinguished between gratitude and grievances. He would never forget anyone who has been kind to him.

”This will be my repayment for Old Mister Su’s care over the years. From now on, I will no longer have any ties with the Su family.” Qin Yu secretly thought.

At that moment, the Su family was in the middle of celebrating. Sun Yumei was standing at the door while waiting for Zhao Gang to come back.

”Why isn’t he back yet?” It was getting late, and Sun Yumei could not help but worry as she stood at the entrance.

”What’s the rush? He is working with the Yan family. Zhao Gang has to go to the company to settle things.” Su Wen, Su Yan’s father, chuckled.

”That’s true.” Sun Yumei nodded.

Qin Yu walked in from a short distance away.

As soon as they saw Qin Yu, Sun Yumei and Su Wen’s eyes widened.

”What are you doing here?!” Sun Yumei took a step forward and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

”Get lost. I’m telling you, the Su family is out of your league now!” Su Wen also shouted.

”That’s right, Su Yan is now a member of the Yan family. Get out of here!” Sun Yumei snorted.
