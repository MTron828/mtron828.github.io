After Lei Hu consumed a pill himself, he separated the remaining pills into two.

He sold the first half to those who were asking favors from him. As for the second half, he gave them to the big shots in Jiangcheng as gifts.

Although the pills were inferior, the name of the Yan family was significant.

As someone who has been living on the streets for a long time, Lei Hu had countless ways to get rid of the pills.

That night, Lei Hu got it on with his arm candy as usual, and his physical condition was exceptional.

After Lei Hu was done, he rubbed his chin in thought while lying in bed. Could it be the work of that pill?

The following day, many people were already gathering in Lei Hu’s house when he got out of bed.

The crowd was made up of Jiangcheng’s entrepreneurs and some elites.

They all had one thing in common — they had all consumed the Soul Nourishment Pill.

They jumped to their feet the moment Lei Hu came into sight.

”Brother Hu, do you still have the pill from yesterday? I’m willing to pay one million for it!”

”Brother Hu, a friend of mine from Chuzhou wants that pill as well. Acquire a few for me, and the project in Chengxi will be yours.”

”Brother Hu, you must keep at least one of those pills for me...”

Lei Hu was stupefied by the scene before his eyes. He was over the moon.

”Alright, sure! Don’t worry, everyone! The supply of pills is sufficient!” Lei Hu was exhilarated as he did not expect the pills Qin Yu gave him to have such magical effects.

That day, Lei Hu scuttled towards Qin Yu’s house.

”Mr. Qin, do you still have the Soul Nourishment Pill from yesterday? I want as many as possible!” Lei Hu requested in jubilation.

Looking at Lei Hu’s reaction, Qin Yu nodded.

Clearly, the Soul Nourishment Pill was more popular than he expected.

”Come and get them a few days later. However, there will be an increase in price this time. I will be selling it at one million each,” Qin Yu answered in a deep voice.

Lei Hu’s lips twitched upon hearing that.

Even though it was a little costly, it was still within an acceptable range. Lei Hu agreed to the deal without hesitation.

”Speaking of which, is there any way that I can procure high-quality medicinal herbs?” Qin Yu queried.

”High-quality medicinal herbs?” Lei Hu squeezed his brows together.

After some thought, he continued, “Mr. Qin, you can try your luck at the auction in Nancheng. I heard that one of the rarest items in previous months was a 100-year-old Chinese Knotweed.”

”An auction?” Qin Yu raised his brows.

After mulling over it, he nodded. “Okay. Got it.”

Qin Yu had a stack of ten million at hand. The auction was definitely worth a visit.

The technique and medicinal herbs required to refine the Soul Nourishment Pill were straightforward and ordinary. Or else, it would have been arduous for Qin Yu to mass-produce them.

With that, the funding issues were solved temporarily.

At dusk, Yan Ruoxue made a phone call to Qin Yu.

Noticing her call, Qin Yu hurriedly picked up.

”Miss Yan, why are you calling me all of a sudden?” Qin Yu asked in bliss.

Yan Ruoxue replied, “Shen Tian is holding a business party. He invited me over, but I don’t feel like going. Do you want to go in my stead?”

”You want me to go?” Qin Yu was stunned and confused.

Qin Yu hated Shen Tian’s guts. He was quite reluctant to attend the party nor did he want to see the younger man.

”Why? Are you afraid?” Yan Ruoxue bantered, seeing that Qin Yu remained taciturn. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu forced a smile. “Of course not. It’s just that...”

”Giving up on your first test?” Yan Ruoxue teased.

”Test?” Qin Yu immediately agreed when he heard that word, “Okay! I’ll go! Tell me the time and venue!”

Yan Ruoxue’s mouth curved into a smile. “Seven in the evening at Riverside Villa.”

”Okay! I’ll be there on time!” Qin Yu said.

Since it was a test for him, Qin Yu would not let Yan Ruoxue down.

Besides, Qin Yu was relatively curious to know the ways of distinguished individuals.

At nightfall, Qin Yu took a taxi and headed towards Riverside Villa.

Riverside Villa was situated in the suburbs. Naturally, the landscape around that area was breathtaking. There was also a long, flowing river before the villa’s main entrance.

By the time Qin Yu arrived at the destination, the place was already packed to the brim.

Although it was titled a business party, it was, in fact, a cocktail party.

There was an array of luxury cars parked outside the main entrance. Among them were the likes of Lamborghini, Ferrari, and other high-end vehicles like Bentley, Rolls-Royce, and so on.

The taxi that Qin Yu came with looked out of place.

”Hmm?” Qin Yu raised his brows the moment he got out of the car. Excitement flashed in his eyes — he had picked up on a wealth of spiritual energy in this area.

He did not expect the concentration of spiritual energy in nature to be so high here. It was even higher than that of the mountain base.

”This is a great location.” Euphoria was written all over his face.

The cocktail party at the villa was already in full swing. Many young girls in revealing clothing were tipsy and were dancing sloppily.
