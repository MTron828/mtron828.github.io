Chapter 1361: Chapter 1,361, the Righteous Wen Wanji

As one of the top experts in the southern region, Wen Wanji’s words carried a lot of weight, so his seat was quite eye-catching.

Just as they were discussing, Wen da rushed over.

He tried his best to appear calm and said with a smile, “Grandpa, let’s Hurry Home.”

“Go Home? The myriad sect meeting isn’t over yet. Why should we go home?”Wen Wanfu frowned and said.

“I have something to tell you,”Wen da said with great effort, “It’s very important.”

Wen Wanfu rolled his eyes and said, “What can you have? Besides eating, drinking, and having fun, you’re just going out to pick up girls.”

Everyone at the table suddenly laughed.

“Aiya, if there’s really something, hurry up and follow me,”Wen da urged.

The sect master of the Tianyun sect laughed and said, “Wan Chong, since your grandson is looking for you for something, you should leave first.”

“What could he possibly have to do?”Wen wanyun stood up and muttered.

“Maybe he really has something to do this time.”The sect master of the Tianyun sect laughed and said.

Wen wanyun stood up and cupped his hands to everyone. He said, “Everyone, I’m sorry. I’ll go back first.”

After saying this, the two of them walked out of the great Yue mountain.

“What’s the matter? Why are you in such a hurry?”Wen Wanji asked.

Wen Da didn’t say anything, but a grave expression appeared on his face.

Only after the two of them left the mountain did Wen da say with a horrified expression, “Grandfather, something bad has happened. Qin Yu beat the son of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master to death.”

Wen Wanli was stunned for a moment before his expression changed drastically.

“Where’s Qin Yu? where is he now?”Wen Wanli asked hurriedly.

“I asked Wen Er to hide him. He’s now in the Wen family’s secret realm,”Wen da said.

Wen Wanli did not dare to think too much. He brought Wen Da and hurried home.

On the way, Wen da told Wen Wanli everything that had happened.

After Wen Wanyi heard it, he couldn’t help but look solemn.

On the way back, he didn’t say a word, showing a rare nervousness.

After rushing back to the Wen family, Wen Wanyi quickly entered the Wen family’s mystic realm.

In the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged. When he saw Wen wanyi rushing over, Qin Yu quickly stood up and said, “Master.”

Wen wanyi nodded and said coldly, “You killed the son of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect. He will never let you go.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. “I didn’t expect it to be his son either.”

“There must be something wrong with this matter.”Wen Wanli frowned.

“His son hasn’t left the Tianyun sect for many years. This time, he suddenly came to the myriad sect gathering and provoked you. There must be someone who is trying to cause trouble.”Wen Wanli took a deep breath.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “Regardless of whether there is someone who is trying to cause trouble, I was the one who killed him. The Tianyun sect will definitely not let me off.”

“That’s right. That’s his son. Ling Yun isn’t on the same level as him,”Wen Wanli said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu stood up and cupped his hands. “Master, this matter started because of me. I will bear the responsibility myself. I will not implicate the Wen family. I will leave now.”

Wen Wanli looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? Since I have accepted you as my disciple, I will naturally be responsible for you.”

“Moreover, I’ve just publicly announced that you’re my disciple at the myriad sect meeting. Even if you leave, will the heavenly cloud sect let this matter rest?”

This was the truth. If Qin Yu couldn’t be found, Wen Wanji would most likely be found to take responsibility.

“What should we do now?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Wen Wanji took a deep breath and said, “From now on, you’re not allowed to leave this place even half a step. Do you understand?”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay.”

Then, Wen Wanye looked at Wen Da and Wen er and said, “From today on, the two of you are not allowed to leave the Wen family. I will go and inform your grandfathers to come as guests.”

Wen wanye naturally had his friends, and all of them were experts.

The reason why he invited them as guests was to prevent the heavenly cloud sect from suddenly making trouble.

Seeing how busy they were, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little ashamed.

“I’m really sorry...”Qin Yu sighed.

Wen wanyi shook his head and said, “The matter has already happened. There’s no point in saying anything. Just stay here and I’ll try my best to handle this matter.”

“It’s a pity that Jue Wu is in closed-door cultivation.”At this moment, Wen Wanyi couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

If Jue Wu was here, this matter would be easier to handle.

Wen Wanyi didn’t stay any longer and quickly left.

Qin Yu stayed in this mystic realm by himself, and he had an unspeakable shame in his heart. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

More importantly, he was unable to cultivate now, and staying here was purely a waste of time.

...

The news of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s young master being killed quickly spread.

At the scene of the myriad sect meeting.

A disciple of the heavenly cloud sect ran over with a panicked expression.

“Sect... sect master, something bad has happened...”this disciple knelt on the ground with a terrified expression.

The first elder berated, “What’s the matter? Why are you making such a fuss? Can’t you see that we’re having a meeting!”

That disciple said with a trembling voice, “Something... something big has happened. I... I have to report this matter as soon as possible...”

The sect master glanced at him and waved his hand. “What is it? Speak.”

The disciple swallowed his saliva and said, “Young master... Young Master is dead...”
