Chapter 211: No One Would Dare to Do Anything to You Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Dead?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

Jiang Haoran actually died?

“It’s Miss Yan. She...”

“Mr. Zhong!” Jiang Gu berated and interrupted Mr. Zhong.

Mr. Zhong didn’t say anything more.

Qin Yu vaguely understood, but he didn’t say anything.

It was unknown when it started, but Qin Yu became more and more cold-hearted.

“You guys go first. I’ll go to the Jiang family’s home when I have time,” Qin Yu said.

Jiang Gu quickly cupped his hands and said, “Okay, Mr. Qin. I’ll wait for you at home.”

After they left, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the bed.

Ever since he woke up, a golden light flashed in his mind.

The golden light was the size of a grain of rice, but it made Qin Yu feel an extraordinary power.

“What exactly is this?” Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and felt the golden light in his mind.

Soon, Qin Yu realized that this golden light would move according to his mind.

“Spiritual power?” Qin Yu guessed.

Could it be that the serious injury caused by the Spirit Whip caused Qin Yu to have spiritual power?

Normally, only those at the Nascent Soul Stage could have spiritual power alone, but Qin Yu was only at the Foundation Establishment Stage.

“It’s really a blessing in disguise,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter.

Ever since he woke up, Qin Yu felt that his spiritual power had become a lot stronger.

After thinking about it, he realized there was only one possibility. It was because of the effect of the Spirit Whip on his spiritual power.

After lying on the hospital bed for the whole morning, Qin Yu came to the Jiang family’s home in the afternoon.

As the number one family in Chuzhou, the Jiang family’s strength was naturally not to be underestimated.

Not only did they have several Inner Strength Past Masters, but their assets were also spread throughout the entire province.

Rumor had it that the funds on their books were as high as ten billion.

Qin Yu’s arrival undoubtedly caused everyone to be nervous.

Everyone looked at Qin Yu with covetous eyes.

Qin Yu ignored them and walked straight into the Jiang family’s villa.

“Mr. Qin.” Upon seeing Qin Yu, Jiang Gu immediately stood up.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He looked at Jiang Gu and said, “The Jiang family is a blue-blood family. You guys should have a lot of herbs in stock, right?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Hearing this, Jiang Gu couldn’t help but shake his head and said, “Mr. Qin, I’ve been in seclusion for three years. The herbs have been completely consumed.”

“That’s a pity.” Qin Yu’an sighed slightly.

“Mr. Qin, this is the property of the Jiang family. Please take a look.” Mr. Zhong handed the prepared materials to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took it and read it carefully.

“The assets are really beyond imagination.” Looking at this document, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

The Jiang family’s assets extended to almost all walks of life. The Jiang family was even involved in schools and hospitals.

The Jiang family even had a 80% stake in one of the aristocratic schools!

Just this school alone would bring a huge amount of income to the Jiang family every year!

And Qin Yu would become the new owner of these assets.

“I will only take 50% of the Jiang family’s profits,” Qin Yu said as he caressed the document.

Jiang Gu quickly nodded and said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin!”

Jiang Gu was already lucky to have 50% left.

“By the way, release Yao Qing. He’s locked up in the Martial Arts Association. Also, release all the people who are locked up because of personal grudges,” Qin Yu said as he looked at Jiang Gu.

“Yes, I’ll call the Martial Arts Association right away,” Jiang Gu quickly nodded and said.

Then, Qin Yu got up and left the Jiang family’s home.

After leaving the Jiang family, Qin Yu drove to the prison of the Martial Arts Association.

This time, no one in the Martial Arts Association dared to stop Qin Yu. Everyone was flattering Qin Yu.

Qin Yu waited for a moment at the door, and Yao Qing walked out of the Martial Arts Association.

As soon as he saw Qin Yu, he rushed over excitedly.

“Mr. Qin, I knew you would be fine!” Yao Qing said excitedly.

Qin Yu patted him on the shoulder and said, “Alright, let’s go. I don’t want to stay here for another minute.”

“Okay!” Yao Qing nodded his head vigorously.

After leaving the Martial Arts Association, the two of them found a place to have a meal.

Yao Qing wolfed down his meal.

During this period of time in the Martial Arts Association, Yao Qing had barely eaten a full meal.

After the meal, Qin Yu casually asked, “Didn’t you come to look for your sister? Where is she?”

Yao Qing sighed and said, “I haven’t even seen my sister before I was locked up.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Let your sister stay in the provincial capital. The educational resources here are better.”

After embarking on the path of cultivation, Qin Yu increasingly understood the importance of resources.

With the same amount of talent but different environments, the result was completely different.

Yao Qing nodded and said, “Okay.”

“I’ll accompany you to pick up your sister tomorrow,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Yao Qing quickly agreed, “Okay!”

Then, Yao Qing took out his phone and sent a text message to his sister in advance.

The next evening, Qin Yu and Yao Qing got into the car and rushed to the school.

The school where Yao Qing’s sister was at was called Ruisi Primary School. It was an aristocratic school in Chuzhou.

Most of the people who went to school here were either rich or noble. Even Xiao Yu used to be a student of this school.

The car drove all the way to the door. School just ended.

There were many luxury cars parked at the door. Bentleys and Rolls-royces were almost everywhere.

As soon as the car stopped, Yao Qing’s expression changed slightly.

He pointed at the door and said, “That’s my sister!”

After turning his head, he saw a little girl who was only 11 or 12 years old. She was standing at the door with her head lowered.

In front of her stood a woman with a big belly. She was pointing at the little girl and scolding her non-stop.

Seeing this scene, Yao Qing immediately became anxious.

Before the car even stopped, he jumped out of the car and ran over.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. After he parked the car properly, he also walked over.

“Little b*tch, apologize to my son quickly!” The fat woman pointed at Yao Qing’s sister, Yao Man, and cursed.

Yao Man lowered her head and didn’t dare to say a word.

“What... What’s going on?” Yao Qing hurried over and shielded his sister behind him.

The chubby woman glared at Yao Qing and cursed, “None of your business! What’s your relationship with this little b*tch?”

“She’s my sister,” Yao Qing tried his best to explain politely.

The chubby woman sized up Yao Qing and said sarcastically, “Oh, she’s your sister? Do you know that this little b*tch bullied my son?”

“That’s impossible. My sister would never bully anyone! Besides, she’s just a little girl. How could she be a match for your son...” Yao Qing looked at the chubby kid beside the chubby woman and couldn’t help but frown.

“How is that impossible? Cut the crap and let this little b*tch apologize to my son!”

The little boy beside the chubby woman even walked over and kicked Yao Man, then made a face.

Yao Qing’s expression changed slightly. He bent down and whispered, “Yao Man, what’s going on?”

Yao Man shook her head and didn’t say a word, but her eyes were full of fear.

“Say what you want to say. Don’t be afraid. No one will dare to do anything to you.” At this moment, Qin Yu walked over.

He petted Yao man’s head and said with a smile.
