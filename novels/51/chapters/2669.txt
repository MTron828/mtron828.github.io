Chapter 2670: The God Slayer

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The power of his soul drained all of his potential. Qin Yu instantly used all of his Saint Power.

Although he was wrapped in the Saint Power, his divine soul was still unable to withstand the terrifying power of Ten Directions Annihilation.

However, the period Qin Yu resisted this time was a little longer. His divine soul seemed to have been crushed into layers of powder before it recovered again.

However, his divine soul seemed to have experienced thousands of tempering and became even more solid in this kind of impact.

A faintly discernible divine might power quietly emitted from his divine soul.

This was the internal qi of divine might that only a True Consciousness could have!

This method was somewhat similar to when Qin Yu was facing Nightmare on the eighth level of purgatory. At that time, it was her father’s power of the soul that protected his origin.

Now, it was Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly cultivation technique that allowed him to transfer this damage into his dream.

However, the damage in the dream world would still affect his soul even though he was transferred to the dream world.

Moreover, traces of Ten Directions Annihilation’s internal qi flowed in Qin Yu’s divine soul.

In the middle of the terrifying destructive air current, a white-robed woman blocked in front of her with one hand.

The terrifying shockvvave split apart as if it was afraid of this woman.

She slowly walked to the front of the tombstone. In this destructive airflow, her clothes did not even crease. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Her palm slowly pressed onto the stone tablet. In an instant, the stone tablet seemed to be angered.

Wind and clouds surged in the entire world. Inhumane roars resounded through the world one after another. Qin Yu’s divine soul was once again torn into countless powder.

However, the fair hand did not leave the stone tablet despite the impact of the power.

The ninth soul skill- Divine Demon Slash.

Above the stone tablet, the rolling black clouds in the sky suddenly split into two.

The entire world suddenly lit up. In the next moment, a huge saber light slashed down on Ten Directions Annihilation’s tomb body.

All the energy that Ten Directions Annihilation was releasing came to an abrupt halt. At this moment, the stone tablet was just like an ordinary stone, allowing the woman to pick it up and carry it on her back.

Qin Yu’s eyes were spinning as he returned to the Treasure Repository Pavilion.

At this moment, the place was deathly silent. Even the table that was used to protect the treasured weapon had not collapsed.

In other words, what they had just arrived at should have been the domain space of Ten Directions Annihilation. Their divine souls had been pulled in.

Qin Yu stared at Zi Yan with a face full of shock. One had to know that it was not the real space.

However, she was able to strike in world of Ten Directions Annihilation and slash out that terrifying saber.

Moreover, the explosive power of Ten Directions Annihilation did not cause any harm to her at all. This woman’s divine soul power was far above that of this stone tablet.

“Who is this person?”

Qin Yu’s face was filled with shock. This was already a strength that was completely on a different level from his.

Was this person a True Consciousness or a Holy Consciousness?

The moment Zi Yan saw Qin Yu, she seemed to be a little surprised.

She nodded slightly at Qin Yu and ignored the confused Qin Yu. She carried the stone tablet and left.

“What a terrifying woman! How could there be such a powerful living being in this Saint Kingdom?”

Qin Yu’s entire body turned cold. If this woman attacked him now, he would have died for sure.

Even Elder Xinyue’s battle clone did not have 1% of the saber attack’s saber intent just now.

“Oh ya, you’re already on our list. I suggest that you stop collecting Heart of Saint Kingdom…”

The woman suddenly turned around and said.

“Who are you?”

Qin Yu asked.

“Holy Lord Chen Shuang is not bad. I don’t wish the person he appointed to die in our hands.”

The woman turned around and walked down the stairs, leaving behind the sentence.

“It’s probably the God Slayer of Chen Shuang in the Saint Kingdom. Her strength should have reached the Dao Consciousness or even the Holy

Consciousness level. She’s already a peak existence in this Saint Kingdom. Moreover, she mentioned the Heart of the Saint Kingdom. That should be the case.”

Immortal Emperor Yao spoke softly.

“God Slayer? What is that? I haven’t heard of it before.”

Qin Yu was puzzled.

“The God Slayer is the most powerful existence in the Saint Kingdom. Their only purpose of existence is to stop the birth of a Holy Lord because a chaotic Saint Kingdom is what they yearn for. Once a Holy Lord is born, they will hide and not let the Holy Lord discover them. They will only appear when the Holy Lord dies.”

“Can’t even the Holy Lord discover the existence of these God Slayers?” Qin Yu felt that it was not simple.

“If they hide their cultivation purposely, it will be very difficult for the Holy Lord to find them all. The Saint Kingdom is so big that it is impossible to find them all. Some of them can even threaten the Holy Lord. There were a few times when the rulers of Saint Kingdom died due to external powers and the God Slayers joined forces to assassinate the Holy Lord.”

Immortal Emperor Yao laughed strangely.

“Originally, the God Slayers couldn’t have come to the outer regions. They’re likely here because they know that there’s turmoil in the Ancient Demon Land.

They’re here to get the Saint Weapon, Ten Directions Annihilation, back. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been able to make them appear with your strength. ”

“Did the God Slayers put this Ten Directions Annihilation here? I saw it absorbing the power of all the artifact spirits. Even the power of everyone in the Ancient Demon Land was quietly attracted to it, including the Demon Sealing Valley.”

“This Ten Directions Annihilation should be one of the top five Saint Weapons in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. It’s an extremely ancient magical artifact. I’ve seen it before in the world of the Saint Kingdom. The current Ten Directions Annihilation should have been severely damaged, or else it would last for a much longer time. Even Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly might not be able to avoid it. Placing it here to absorb energy to restore the power of the gravestone isn’t a bad idea.”

After the conversation, Qin Yu also had some understanding.

His expression was somewhat solemn. If he wanted to become the ruler of this Saint Kingdom, he would have to collect the Hearts of the Saint Kingdom.Search newn0vel. on google

However, if he collected too many Hearts of the Saint Kingdom, he would attract the attention of the God Slavers.

He had only obtained two of the eighty-one Hearts of the Saint Kingdom. Why would he attract attention?

However, Zi Yan mentioned Chen Shuang’s name. Did the Seal of Heaven Returning on his body attract their attention?

Qin Yu’s thoughts were a little chaotic. He originally thought that he was only here to choose a magical artifact, but he did not expect so many things to appear out of thin air.

The most troublesome thing was that there was a God Slayer who targeted outsiders.

Forget it. Let’s not bother about it for now.

Right now, the God Slayers were still far away from him. His current priority was to pass through this Ancient Demon Land before continuing to think about what to do next. Qin Yu shook his head.

Qin Yu’s gaze stopped in front of the two weapons just now. Those were the weapons that Zi Yan had introduced to him previously. One could tell how extraordinary these two magical artifacts were. The Nine Heavens Startling Rainbow Sword.

The Heavenly Wave Sword.

These two magical artifacts should not be weaker than the Prajna that Hua

Tian had taken..
