Chapter 1206: Chapter 1206, the true face 

“And I can be your spy and help you find that inheritor!”Sky Blood Rainbow shouted desperately.

At the critical moment of life and death, he began to be afraid.

Especially when he had waited for many years to be resurrected. In order to survive, he would do anything.

Qin Yu Sized Up Sky Blood Rainbow. It had to be said that Qin Yu was quite interested in the secret techniques of the immortal slaying sect.

“How is it? I can still do a lot of things!”The Sky Blood Rainbow broke out in cold sweat and kept throwing out his chips.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Okay, then I’ll let you live for the time being. But in the meantime, you can’t go anywhere.”

“Okay, okay!”The Sky Blood Rainbow hurriedly nodded.

As long as he could keep his life, everything had a chance.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He dragged the Sky Blood Rainbow and rushed into the Heaven Gate.

According to Chu Hedao, the immortal slaying sect’s inheritance was extremely terrifying and could very well threaten all cultivators.

Now, the Sky Blood Rainbow’s words once again confirmed this statement.

After returning to the Heaven Gate, Qin Yu broke the four limbs of the sky blood rainbow and rummaged through the cabinets to find a magic artifact that bound the body of the Sky Blood Rainbow. Only then did he feel slightly at ease.

At this moment, in the Hall of the Heaven Gate, twenty mighty figures were waiting for Qin Yu.

They felt a faint sense of unease in their hearts. Even though Qin Yu had made a promise, they knew in their hearts that such a promise was worthless and could be overturned at any time.

Other than these almighty experts, Ye Qing was also sitting in the Great Hall.

He looked coldly at everyone, his eyes emitting killing intent.

After experiencing this battle, ye Qing couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

The arrival of the golden age had made modern weapons unable to surpass martial artists.

And having abandoned his cultivation, he was no longer able to protect the fire country anymore.

“Perhaps, it’s time for me to start cultivating again.”Ye Qing sighed in his heart.

At that moment, Qin Yu walked in from outside the door.

The moment they saw Qin Yu, everyone’s expressions turned cold.

Although no one said a word, the strange atmosphere lingered in the room.

Qin Yu walked straight to the sect master’s seat and sat down.

He drank a mouthful of water and then said indifferently, “Everyone, there’s no need to be nervous. You all just want to head to the holy region, and so do I, so there’s no enmity between us.”

“That’s right. We weren’t willing to be enemies with little friend Qin.”A mighty figure immediately took advantage of the situation.

Qin Yu swept his gaze over everyone and said, “The next time the Holy Region Opens, the time hasn’t been set yet. Everyone has paid an extremely great price in order to head to the Holy Region.”

At this point, Qin Yu paused for a moment before taking out a map and handing it over to one of the higher-beings beside him.

“These are the positions of the eighteen array platforms. In order to prevent any accidents, I would like to trouble everyone to stand guard near the eighteen array platforms. If there are any unusual movements, you must warn each other,”Qin Yu said.

Hearing this, the many higher-beings were instantly delighted. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Previously, according to Gu Xinghe’s request, they had already found most of the ancient array platforms. However, they were still far from the eighteen array platforms.

With this map, they could also ensure that they would be the first to receive news of the Holy Region. Why not.

“Young friend Qin, please rest assured. We will do our best!”A mighty figure expressed his stance.

“That’s right. Once we go to the Holy Region, we can be considered a family. When that time comes, we will have to look out for each other. With young friend Qin accompanying us, we will also have confidence.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Alright, I also hope that everyone can be honest with each other.”

“Definitely, definitely!”Everyone cupped their hands and said.

“Little friend Qin’s strength has shocked us greatly, and his state of mind has even caused us to admire him!”

After a round of bragging, the atmosphere fell into an awkward state.

They did not stay any longer. After a round of discussion, they rushed towards the various array platforms.

Soon, only Qin Yu and ye Qing were left in the hall.

Qin Yu originally wanted to concoct a pill for ye Qing to treat his injuries, but at this moment, Qin Yu realized that without the support of spirit energy, he could not concoct a pill at all. He could only let him go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“Commander Ye, what are your plans next?”Qin Yu poured a cup of tea for ye Qing and asked casually.

Ye Qing sighed and said, “It’s time for me to resume my cultivation. What Happened Today definitely won’t be the only time.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Commander Ye isn’t interested in going to the Holy Region?”

“Not for the time being.”Ye Qing shook his head.

Everyone had their own aspirations, so Qin Yu didn’t say anything more.

After sending ye Qing off, Qin Yu lowered his head to look at his own body.

This body was covered in spots, and occasionally, a few scars could be seen.

After such a great battle, only a few scars were left, which made Qin Yu extremely satisfied.

“If I were to use the battle word incantation and the true body of azure wood, I wonder how monstrous this body would be.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Qin Yu’s body could not even be compared to that of a supreme expert.

If he were to recover his spiritual energy, he did not know how powerful he would be.

‘If I have enough vitality, then I can absorb the Twilight Qi in the sacred mausoleum to raise my body,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

Using the Twilight Qi to raise his body and using vitality to offset the decline brought about by the Twilight Qi.

However, Qin Yu had no idea what vitality was. He had never seen it before, so he could only wait until he reached the saint-level before making any plans.

Qin Yu didn’t stay at the Heaven Gate that day. Instead, he planned to make use of the night to head to Rainbow Village once more.

During the previous conversation with Old Meng, Qin Yu had always felt that there was something wrong. What she described was very different from what Qin Yu had seen in the inkstone.

Just as Qin Yu left the Heaven Gate and was about to head to rainbow village, several strange auras quietly approached him. Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with internal Qi.

“Eh?”Qin Yu frowned slightly. His eyes narrowed slightly and he did not move.

Soon, three figures appeared in Qin Yu’s field of vision and blocked Qin Yu’s path.

When he saw who it was, Qin Yu’s face revealed a trace of a cold smile that was difficult to detect.

There was indeed something wrong with this old Meng!

“Aunt, why are you here?”Qin Yu pretended to be surprised and asked.

Old Meng put his hands behind his back and walked with her hunched body. He said with a smile, “Didn’t you want to know the news about your mother? I brought you to see her.”
