Chapter 96: Yan Ruoxue Disses Him Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu was stuffing food into his mouth as he looked at the bodyguards.

“Our lady needs to take a photo. Get out of the way quickly. Don’t be so shameless!” The bodyguard berated.

Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but sneer. “Who does this lady think she is to be so stuck up? Others need to make way for her to take a photo? Who gave her the right?”

Just as the bodyguard was about to lose his temper, a man in a white suit walked over.

He waved his hand and said with a nonchalant smile, “We have to be a little more polite. Don’t create repercussions.”

“Yes, Mr. Bai.” The bodyguard hurriedly nodded.

The man called Mr. Bai walked in front of Yan Ruoxue. He took out a stack of money from his bag and said indifferently, “Don’t you just want money? This is ten thousand. Is it enough?”

After saying that, Mr. Bai threw the money on the ground and waved his hand.

Seeing Mr. Bai’s attitude, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but laugh.

“I’ll give you twenty thousand. Can you go to the toilet and eat sh * t?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but say.

“Gee, I’m eating. Don’t talk about such disgusting topics.” Yan Ruoxue rolled her eyes at Qin Yu.

Then, before Qin Yu could say anything, Yan Ruoxue muttered, “But it’s true. These people are already disgusting enough. They really can’t eat anymore...”

When he heard the conversation between the two, Mr. Bai’s expression immediately became extremely displeased.

He said with a cold expression, “Since you didn’t take me up on the offer when I offered it, even if you want to, you don’t have the chance now!”

After saying that, Mr. Bai waved his hand and said coldly, “Clear the area!”

A few bodyguards immediately walked towards Yan Ruoxue’s direction.

He rubbed his fist and said coldly, “Don’t blame us for being impolite!”

As soon as he said that, the bodyguard reached out his hand to grab Yan Ruoxue!

However, his hand froze in mid-air!

He saw Qin Yu using a pair of chopsticks to firmly grasp the bodyguard’s wrist!

“Don’t touch Miss Yan with your dirty hands,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The bodyguard’s expression couldn’t help but turn ugly. He struggled with all his might, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“What are you doing? Don’t waste time!” Mr. Bai said with a frown.

“Mr. Bai, I can’t move my hands anymore...” the bodyguard said in pain.

Mr. Bai frowned slightly and snickered, “How useless. All of you, attack together!”

“Yes!”

Four to five bodyguards immediately swarmed towards Qin Yu!

They were tall and strong, and their punches carried immense force!

But they simply weren’t a match for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu took a step forward, as if he was strolling leisurely, and traveled between the few of them.

Every time he extended his hand, a person would fall!

In just two minutes, these seven to eight bodyguards all fell to the ground and were unable to get up! They let out moans of anguish!

Mr. Bai’s expression became somewhat unsightly. He had never expected Qin Yuto to be so skilled at combat!

“Hurry up and get lost. Don’t disturb our meal.” Qin Yu looked at Mr. Bai coldly and said.

Mr. Bai gritted his teeth and said, “Just you wait!”

After saying this, Mr. Bai turned his head and walked to the girl’s side.

He whispered a few words beside the girl, and then the few of them left the place.

“Seriously, what kind of people are they? How overbearing.” Yan Ruoxue muttered in a low voice.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said helplessly, “People like them are everywhere. They have money, so they think everyone in the world has to listen to them.”

“Forget it. Forget about them. The auction is about to begin. Let’s hurry up and pack up. Don’t waste time.” Yan Ruoxue wiped her mouth and said. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Okay!”

Then, the two of them got into the car and sped in the direction of the auction.

The South City auction was well-known locally and had even affected many surrounding cities.

Even Yan Ruoxue, who lived in Jingdu, had heard of it. That was enough to show the scale and impact of this auction.

When Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue arrived, the entrance was already filled with countless luxury cars.

The entire parking lot was filled with people.

“There are so many people. Things will probably be a little difficult today,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “It’s okay. Don’t worry too much about it.”

Qin Yu nodded, and then the two of them walked towards the auction.

There were two security guards at the entrance of the auction. Qin Yu took a closer look and realized that these two security guards were both Inner Strength Masters!

Although they weren’t very strong, it was still somewhat extravagant for an Inner Strength Master to be in charge of security.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue had just reached the door when they were stopped by two people.

“Our auction requires capital verification. Only those with assets of more than one billion are eligible to enter,” the two security guards said expressionlessly.

“One billion? That’s a lot...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Fortunately, Qin Yu had the black card given by Wei Jiang. It shouldn’t be difficult to enter this venue.

“If you don’t have money, don’t block the road. You’d better go back and eat your roadside stalls.” At this moment, a voice suddenly came from behind Qin Yu.

Turning his head to look, he actually found that it was Mr. Bai, whom he had met on the beach just now.

Mr. Bai sneered and said, “Do you know what this place is? Those who can come here have wealth and status. Do you people who eat roadside stalls deserve to come to this kind of place?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Are you not right in the head?”

Mr. Bai wasn’t angry. He ignored Qin Yu and looked at Yan Ruoxue instead. He said with a nonchalant smile, “Lady, you are so beautiful. Why did you find a boyfriend who can only afford to eat at roadside stalls?”

Yan Ruoxue played with her hair and said with a smile, “So what if I eat at roadside stalls? Don’t tell me they go to the toilet to eat sh*t like you.”
