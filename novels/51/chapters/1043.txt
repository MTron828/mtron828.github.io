Chapter 1044: Chapter 1,044, re-entering the demon city! 

“What! ?”

Gu Zizhen, who was already furious, suddenly became furious!

He glared at Zhai Xing and said through gritted teeth, “You were captured by Qin Yu and even lost the Soul Bell? Do you know what that Soul Bell means to the second mystic realm! ?”

Zhai Xing said apologetically, “I’m sorry, but... The Soul Bell was stolen by someone from the Hong Yi sect.”

With that, Zhai Xing told Gu Zizhen what had happened.

After Gu Zizhen heard it, he did not say anything for a long time.

“I’m willing to be punished.”Zhai Xing stood up and slapped his own chest!

However, a flash of light struck Zhai Xing’s palm.

He said coldly, “That’s enough. If you lost it, so be it. It’s not your fault. You’re already injured. Don’t destroy yourself anymore. Go and rest.”

This instantly made Zhai Xing feel even more guilty. He cupped his hands and said, “I will compensate for the loss.”

After he finished speaking, Zhai Xing turned around and left.

On the other side, Qin Yu was cultivating slowly while waiting for news of the second mystic realm.

After he had become a martial saint, every step he took required a large amount of resources.

Although Qin Yu had the power of creation, herbs, and other items, they were like a drop in the bucket.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

The inventory in Qin Yu’s hands had also been completely depleted.

He stood up and walked out of the secret chamber, all the way to the main hall.

“How is it? Any News?”Qin Yu looked at Jiang Gu.

Jiang gu shook his head and said, “No.”

Qin Yu could not help but rub his chin and muttered, “Star Harvester even lost his soul bell, yet gu zi really doesn’t suspect anything?”

Jiang Gu stood silently at the side. He could no longer interfere in these matters.

If it wasn’t for Qin Yu giving him a position out of consideration for their old friendship, he probably wouldn’t even have the qualifications to join the Heaven Gate.

“If you want to drive a wedge between them, I’m afraid it won’t be that simple.”At this moment, Jiang he walked in from outside the door.

Qin Yu sighed slightly, “That’s right. Since Star Harvester is so loyal to Gu Zizhen, I’m sure Gu Zizhen also thinks highly of Star Harvester.”

“Give up.”Jiang he waved his hand and said.

“If you have the time, it’s better to strengthen your team and attack.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “These two things don’t conflict. There is a limit to any trust, especially when Zhai Xing was captured by me.”

A cold smile appeared on the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth.

“Zhai Xing, I must get it!”Qin Yu sneered.

Seeing this, Jiang he didn’t say anything more.

Then, Qin Yu stood up and looked at Jiang he, saying, “Senior Jiang he, I plan to hand over all the power of the Heaven Gate to you. You will be the chief of the disciples.”

Hearing this, Jiang he couldn’t help but frown, asking, “Why?”

Qin Yu said with a wry smile, “You also know that my mind is not here. Moreover... I will leave this land sooner or later.”

If he wanted to find Yan Ruoxue, he would definitely leave this place.

“You have high prestige and are the person I trust the most. Therefore, it is most suitable for you to be the chief,”Qin Yu said.

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Jiang he could not help but fall into silence.

“Please, senior Jiang He!”Qin Yu stood up and bowed hard.

Seeing this, Jiang he could only nod and say, “Alright, I will agree to it.”

“Thank you!”Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

It was impossible for Qin Yu to spend too much time managing the sect.

To him, the most important thing was to increase his strength and step into the Almighty Realm. He wanted to see the wider world and see the person he missed in his dreams as soon as possible.

“Senior Jiang he, make your preparations. We’ll attack the second mystic realm in a week.”Qin Yu stood up and said.

“So Fast?”Jiang he looked even more surprised.

“You should know that it’s impossible to attack the second secret realm with your current strength, and...”

“I know,”Qin Yu interrupted Jiang He.

“But my goal is not to attack the second secret realm, but to see Zhai Xing.”

“What do you mean?”Jiang he asked.

Qin Yu said with a faint smile, “Zhai Xing’s injuries were treated by me. In other words, the injuries on his body can only be treated by me.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“When we attack the second mystic realm this time, Zhai Xing will definitely appear. At that time, I will bring him a pill.”

“Regardless of whether he accepts it or not, it will definitely arouse Gu Zi’s suspicion.”

Having said that, Qin Yu paused for a moment before standing up and saying, “In this one week’s time, I will invite two helpers.”

“One is the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, and the other is the city lord of the demon city, Immortal Crane.”

The pharmacist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion could provide subsidies to the rear.

And the immortal crane of the demon city controlled an extremely powerful force.

With their help, it was only a matter of time before they took down the second mystic realm.

“I’ll set off now. I’ll leave this place to you. If there’s anything, you can discuss it with Jiang Gu and the others,”said Qin Yu.

After giving his instructions, Qin Yu set off on the same day.

There was no need for the Divine Alchemist pavilion to think too much. The Pavilion Master would definitely help Qin Yu. Therefore, the first place he went to was the demon city.

The demon city was extremely far from the Yan country, in an uninhabited land.

Qin Yu changed his ride many times and it took him three days to arrive at this desert.

This desert stretched as far as the eye could see. Its vastness was beyond imagination.

Fortunately, after Qin Yu had become a martial saint, his divine sense had become many times stronger. In an instant, it had covered more than half of the desert.

Very quickly, he had captured the location of the demon city.

“HMM? The demon city has set up a formation?”Qin Yu was surprised to discover that even with his divine sense, he could only faintly sense traces of life.

If an ordinary martial saint had come, he was afraid that they would not be able to find the demon city at all.

Qin Yu did not think too much about it. After all, the immortal crane did not like to be disturbed.

He immediately followed this trace of divine sense and rushed towards the demon city.
