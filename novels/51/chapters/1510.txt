Chapter 1511: Chapter 1,511, Legends of Earth 1

A hint of displeasure flashed across everyone’s faces when they heard this.

“Young friend Qin, are you threatening us?”Someone asked coldly.

“Although you have some ability, I’m afraid you’re overestimating yourself if you want to threaten everyone here.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Of course I don’t mean that. How can I threaten all of you seniors? When I say harm, I mean the northern lands.”

“Northern land? Why do you say that?”Someone asked doubtfully.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I wonder if everyone here has heard of the immortal slaying sect.”

“Immortal slaying sect?”A trace of doubt flashed across their faces.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

It seemed that the immortal slaying sect didn’t spread in the holy region. Otherwise, it was impossible for them not to have heard of it.

Not only that, Qin Yu found that many great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage on earth didn’t seem to be very famous in the holy region.

“How could these ants have heard of the immortal slaying sect’s great name...”Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s extremely displeased voice came from the spatial magic artifact.

Qin Yu sighed slightly and was about to give up when someone suddenly said, “I’ve heard of it. I’ve heard of the legend of the immortal slaying sect.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately looked at that cultivator.

......

The cultivator said, “Rumor has it that the immortal slaying sect was an extremely prosperous sect in the past. In their sect alone, there were many great cultivators at the tribulation stage, and each of them was extremely powerful.”

“Many great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage? Nonsense, right? How come I’ve never heard of them?”For a moment, everyone couldn’t help but be surprised.

The cultivator continued, “The origin of this sect is extremely mysterious. Rumor has it that it originated from an ancient star. In the past, there was once a great cultivator of the immortal slaying sect who crossed the void and arrived at the Holy Region.”

“That was a golden era. The holy region has many great cultivators at the tribulation stage. Among them, the nine great clans of the Central Plains now each have their own tribulation stage.”

Everyone was silent, waiting for him to continue.

He said in a deep voice, “That great cultivator from the immortal slaying sect had a conflict with the holy region, and many great cultivators attacked him.”

“But in the end... those great cultivators at the tribulation stage died at the hands of the immortal slaying sect.”

Hearing this, everyone was shocked!

A tribulation transcending cultivator from another ancient star actually killed many local grand cultivators? This was a bit too exaggerated!

“You heard it... you know how glorious our immortal slaying sect was back then...”heavenly blood rainbow couldn’t help but feel somewhat proud.

“Shut up,”Qin Yu berated.

That cultivator continued, “What’s even more shocking is that rumor has it that this sect wanted the entire sect to step into the tribulation stage back then! What a terrifying thing!”

“The entire sect stepped into the tribulation transcending stage? This is simply unheard of.”

“It must be fake. This is pure nonsense. Such a prosperous sect, in the entire starry sky, I’m afraid no one can compare to it.”

“That’s right. How can such a sect be unknown? How can it be destroyed?”

The cultivator smiled bitterly and said, “It is indeed something that needs to be verified. Rumor has it that the immortal slaying sect was destroyed because of a masked woman.”

“The masked woman once left a trace in the holy region.”

At this moment, qu Zhu, who had been silent all this time, said.

“Yes, I have also heard of the masked woman. Rumor has it that someone else has obtained her treasure.”

“The immortal slaying sect was destroyed by the masked woman? That is somewhat possible.”

“Yes, rumor has it that none of the cultivators at the tribulation stage at the same time can be compared to her.”

Obviously, the masked woman was much more famous than the immortal slaying sect.

“But all of this is just a rumor. As for whether it’s true or not, no one knows,”said the cultivator with a smile.

“A rumor is still a rumor. What’s more, so what if it’s true? What does it have to do with us? What does it have to do with the northern lands?”

At this moment, Qin Yu stood up and said, “These rumors are all true because I came from that ancient star. I once went to the immortal slaying sect and saw a scene there.”

“As for that scene, it was left behind when the immortal slaying sect was destroyed.”

Everyone looked at Qin Yu in unison. There was curiosity and excitement in their eyes.

“You said you came from that ancient star? is that the ancient star known as the Crouching Dragon Land?”

“That place should have countless treasures. Why did you come to the Holy Region?”

“Little Friend Qin, I wonder if you can bring us to explore it?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Everyone, don’t think about it. That’s all in the past. Now, my hometown is no longer suitable for cultivation. It has long become a wasteland with desolate spiritual qi.”

“The reason why I mentioned the immortal slaying sect is because, according to my experience, the northern lands have indeed obtained the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect. And this kind of inheritance is extremely terrifying. They can absorb everyone’s divine sense and spiritual qi, and even their physical bodies, and turn it into their own use. Moreover, the higher the cultivation level, the better the effect it will bring.”

At this point, Qin Yu paused for a moment and swept his gaze across everyone, he said indifferently, “Ordinary cultivators are simply unable to satisfy their needs. All of you are top-notch people in the South Province. Sooner or later, they will shift the blame onto you.”

“When that time comes, do you still think that you will be able to survive?”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, these people instantly fell into silence, as if they had been persuaded by Qin Yu.

Qin Yu struck while the iron was hot, “Once the northern lands enter the southern region on a large scale, everyone will be affected.”

“The powerful Tianyun sect has already put aside their personal grudges with me and turned to resist the northern lands, let alone everyone here. You All don’t want the sect that you have painstakingly built to be destroyed in an instant, right?”

The scene was silent. No one spoke.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry either. He just waited quietly.

“Of course, everyone can consider it. I didn’t ask everyone to resist the northern lands. I only hope that the various large sects can shoulder their responsibilities. At the very least, they can protect the city that they are in,”Qin Yu said quietly.

“I’ll think about this matter carefully later. Young Friend Qin, you’re too kind.”Finally, someone stood up and agreed to this matter.

Following that, the others also expressed their stance one after another, saying that they would protect the surrounding area.

Of course, it was naturally not that easy to get them to resist the northern lands. As for whether they would change their minds in the future, that was unknown.

After everyone dispersed, Wen Daqi came forward and said, “TSK TSK, I didn’t expect you to be so good at deceiving people.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I didn’t deceive them. I’m telling the truth.”

Qu Zhu, who was at the side, said in surprise, “The news about the immortal slaying sect and the masked woman is also true?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “That’s right. I indeed came from that ancient star and witnessed the destruction of the immortal slaying sect with my own eyes.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
