Chapter 721: Do You Dare to Bet with Me? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Even though they couldn’t see her face, Qin Yu and all the young masters present knew who she was.

At this moment, Granny Qin was looking at Qin Yu with a smile. There was a hint of schadenfreude in her eyes.

It was obvious that she did it on purpose to make Qin Yu feel bad.

“Old b*stard...” Qin Yu wanted to flare up, but he knew very well that anger was useless.

He suppressed the anger in his heart. His throat suddenly tasted a fishy taste, and a mouthful of blood immediately gushed out!

The people around looked at Qin Yu in surprise, and someone even asked.

“Mr. Qin, what’s wrong with you? Are you sick?” Someone surrounded him and asked.

Qin Yu wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth. He waved his hand and said, “It’s nothing...”

Granny Qin smiled nonchalantly and said, “If you’re not feeling well, go back and rest early. Don’t force yourself. It’s useless to force yourself.”

Qin Yu glanced coldly at Granny Qin, then turned around and left.

“Humph, you’re still too young to fight with me.” Granny Qin’s voice entered Qin Yu’s ears.

Qin Yu stopped after taking a few steps.

He took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “No matter how hard I try, I can’t suppress the anger in my heart...”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly as waves of intense golden light burst out from his body!

A terrifying internal qi instantly swept through the entire arena!

A wave of impact sent the people around him flying!

Qin Yu’s side had become a small empty circle!

On the stage, Granny Qin narrowed her eyes slightly.

She quietly sized up Qin Yu, the corners of her mouth curling into a playful smile.

Qin Yu turned around, took a deep breath, and then suddenly threw a punch forward!

A golden light instantly condensed.

Qin Yu’s fist was as dazzling as the round sun.

That light seemed to contain destructive power.

“Boom!”

As Qin Yu punched out, this power poured out like a torrent!

The extremely fast speed tore through the air, almost igniting the air in the void!

Granny Qin’s expression changed slightly as she shouted, “Blackie!”

Blackie immediately took a step forward. His fingers bent into the shape of a claw as he grabbed out.

However, Qin Yu’s fist light bypassed Blackie and smashed towards the screen-like scene.

“Boom!”

A loud sound was heard and an explosion-like air wave spread out in all directions!

Blackie snorted coldly. He suddenly opened his mouth and a cold light gushed out!

The air wave was immediately extinguished and was replaced by an earth-shaking coldness!

Granny Qin looked very satisfied when she saw this.

“Blackie, you did well,” Granny Qin said with a nonchalant smile.

Blackie bowed slightly, and then looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. With a shake of his feet, he arrived in front of Blackie!

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere was extremely tense!

Granny Qin said with a smile, “Qin Yu, do you want to fight with Blackie? I permit it.”

Qin Yu ignored Granny Qin. He looked at Blackie coldly and the mark of the Divine Dragon’s power lit up between his brows!

The mark flickered with a weak light, but the light was extremely dazzling in Blackie’s eyes!

He subconsciously took two steps back, and a trace of fear flashed in his eyes.

Granny Qin saw this and hurriedly stood in front of Blackie.

She said with a cold expression, “Qin Yu, how can you call yourself a hero when you play such tricks?”

“I never thought I was a hero,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Moreover, this beast you raised was born to fear the Divine Dragon. Who can you blame?”

Being insulted by Qin Yu in front of so many people, Blackie and Granny Qin naturally couldn’t stand it!

Granny Qin didn’t hide her anger. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Qin Yu, do you dare to give Blackie a few days?” Granny Qin squinted her eyes and said.

Qin Yu sneered. “Fine, I’ll give him a month.”

“A month to overcome his fear of the power of the Divine Dragon is enough?”

Blackie frowned slightly, then snorted. “One month is enough.”

“Okay, then see you in a month!” Granny Qin was the first to agree.

“Wait.” At this time, Qin Yu suddenly called out to Granny Qin.

Granny Qin turned around and said with a nonchalant smile, “Are you afraid?”

Qin Yu ignored Granny Qin’s ridicule and said, “Since it’s a challenge, we naturally have to bet on it. Otherwise, what’s the point?”

Granny Qin raised her eyebrows and then laughed out loud. “Interesting!”

“Alright, I’ll satisfy you. Tell me, what do you want?” Granny Qin put her hands behind her back and said indifferently.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “If I win, give me the chance to bathe in blood! Take me to the Mystic Realm and let me awaken my bloodline!”

Granny Qin’s expression changed drastically when she heard this!

Of course, she knew Qin Yu’s purpose! It was nothing more than for Yan Ruoxue!

But this matter was of great importance, and it was a secret of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

The price of bringing Qin Yu in would be too great!

Most importantly, Granny Qin couldn’t make the decision alone!

“What, are you afraid?” Qin Yu sneered.

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and said coldly, “Change the condition.”

“Hehe, it seems that you don’t have confidence in your pet,” Qin Yu said sarcastically.

Granny Qin’s expression turned cold, and she was obviously extremely angry.

At this time, Blackie said behind her, “Granny Qin, one month is enough. I can kill him with a lift of my hand.”

Hearing Blackie’s words, Granny Qin seemed to have some confidence.

That’s right. Blackie wouldn’t lose anyway. So what if she agreed to it?

Granny Qin nodded slightly and said, “Alright, I’ll agree to it. What if you lose?”

“If I lose, you can do whatever you want with me,” Qin Yu said.

“Alright! Then it’s a deal!” Granny Qin snorted coldly.

After saying this, Granny Qin turned around and was about to leave.

“Wait, wait, wait!”

At this moment, someone suddenly shouted from below the stage.

The man with the mustache was running up excitedly.

He said with a grin, “Qin Yu, Granny Qin, a verbal promise is meaningless. Why don’t we make a contract?”

“Contract?” Granny Qin frowned slightly, as if she didn’t understand.

The man with the mustache hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, yes, yes, a contract!”

After saying that, the man with the mustache extended his palm and a withered yellow paper fell into his hand.

The man with the mustache slapped the large piece of paper on the ground and then said with a grin, “This item is called the heavenly guardian book. It’s said to have been passed down from Satan. As long as you sign on it, it’s equivalent to signing a contract with your soul.”

“If anyone goes against it, their soul will be taken away by Satan,” the man with the mustache said with a grin.
