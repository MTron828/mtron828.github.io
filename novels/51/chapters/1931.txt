1932 A Man without Money Is No Man at All

Gu Xinghe furrowed his brows and stepped forward, saying, “It’s my fault for not keeping an eye on him and not gaining his trust. I’ll send someone to find him now!”

“No need,” the Semi-Saint waved his hand, sighed, and said. “He should have escaped by now.”

Everyone was silent, shocked by this outcome.

On the other end, Qin Yu’s true body had arrived at the ore storage room in Serene South City.

Qin Yu had never trusted Gu Xinghe from the very beginning. With his personality, he would never let go of his hatred.

Looking at the ores in front of him, Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

“If these ores were to be auctioned, they should be able to sell for quite a bit of money,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, Qin Yu could not take away so many ores in one go.

Helplessly, Qin Yu could only try to take as many as he could.

In a short while, Qin Yu’s Spatial Magic Artifact was full of ores.

After getting the ores, he didn’t dare to stay in Serene South City and quickly left.

After he escaped from Serene South City, Qin Yu started to worry.

He probably couldn’t hide the matter between Yan Ruoxue and him anymore. He just didn’t know what the Si family would do.

Qin Yu came to an Inn and planned to stay for the time being.

However, when he took out his card, he realized not a single cent was in it.

Qin Yu could not help but be stunned. He smiled bitterly and said, “It’s really a case of a man without money is no man at all. D*mn it.”

Although barter was possible in the Holy Region, spirit coins were still the common currency. As long as the amount was enough, one could buy any treasures.

But Qin Yu didn’t understand. He didn’t know who issued the currency and and the purpose of it.

“Looks like I have to go make some money,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu had no choice but to stay in the wilderness for the time being.

That night, he looked at the sky full of stars and couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

Since the Si family was already aware of the matter, they would send people to get rid of him quietly even if Si Shiyue didn’t make a move on him.

The scariest thing was the Si family could completely conceal the news, and no one would know about it. And the Si family’s reputation would not be tarnished.

“With the Si family’s ability, they’ll find me sooner or later,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After much thought, Qin Yu made up his mind. He stood up and said, “D*mn it! Instead of sitting here and waiting to die, it’s better to take the initiative to attack!”

Qin Yu made a tremendously risky plan at this moment!

That was to tell the world that he wanted to pursue Yan Ruoxue!

With that, the Si family could no longer conceal the news!

“I’ll go back to the Yan family tomorrow. D*mn it!” Qin Yu cursed.

Of course, there was a downside to doing so. Not only would he offend the Si family, but he would also likely offend the Yan family.

But Qin Yu didn’t care so much anymore. It was only a matter of time, and he had no other way to save his life.

The following day.

Qin Yu set off for the Yan family.

However, he was blocked by two people halfway.

The two were not strangers. They were the two elders of the Yao family who had extended their invitation to him since the beginning.

Seeing them, Qin Yu quickly bowed and said, “Greetings to the two seniors.”

“Young friend Qin, since you’ve come to Zhongzhou, why didn’t you come to the Yao family?” the two asked with a smile.

“I’m really sorry,” Qin Yu said awkwardly. “I ran into some trouble on the way.”

“Hahaha!” the two couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “Young friend Qin, our Yao family is still very interested in you. If you don’t mind, why don’t you follow me to the Yao family now?”

Qin Yu was silent for a while and did not answer.

Going to the Yao family seemed a good choice because the Si family couldn’t possibly go to the Yao family to kill people.

However, on second thought, he felt this matter was extremely risky!

It was because Qin Yu had no idea if he was important or how important he was to the Yao family!

If he weren’t important enough, the Yao family would never bear the risk of offending the Si family for Qin Yu. On the contrary, they might do the Si family a favor and surrender Qin Yu directly to them. If that happened, no one could help him.

“Seniors, if I may ask, who actually invited me? Is it the two of you, or…” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

“There’s no need to worry about that. Young friend Qin,” the two men said with a faint smile. “In short, our Yao family is very sincere to you.”

Seeing them not revealing anything, Qin Yu naturally didn’t dare to go rashly. He said with a smile, “How about this? I’ll pay a visit to the Yao family in a few days.”

“Alright, it’s a deal,” the two elderly men said.

Before they left, they told Qin Yu who they were. They were the executives of the Yao family, who had high status.

As for whether they were outer or inner executives, Qin Yu was too shy to ask.

Although both were in executive positions, there was a big difference in their status.

After they left, Qin Yu did not waste time and rushed back to the Yan family.

At the same time, the Semi-Saint had returned to the Si family.

He went straight to Si Shiyue’s residence. At this moment, Si Shiyue was not cultivating. He encountered a bottleneck during this period and failed to advance further in his cultivation. Thus he stopped to cultivate.

...

The Semi-Saint walked up to Si Shiyue, bowed, and said, “Greetings, Holy Son.”

Si Shiyue glanced at him and said, “Is there anything?”

The Semi-Saint quickly bowed and told Si Shiyue what had happened.

After hearing what he said, Si Shifeng, next to Si Shiyue instantly said in surprise, “As expected, this Qin Yu really came from that so-called Earth! Your guess was right!”

Si Shiyue’s expression was gloomy. He said coldly, “Is the information true?”

“It’s true! I saw it with my own eyes!” the Semi-Saint quickly said.

Si Shiyue took a deep breath and said slowly, “Where is he?”

“He has run away. Should we send someone to locate him?” the Semi-Saint said.

Si Shiyue was silent for a moment as if he was concerned about his reputation.

Si Shifeng, by the side, seemed to have noticed his concern. He immediately laughed and said, “Brother Yue, don’t worry. No one will notice it if we kill Qin Yu.”

Si Shiyue, who was at a bottleneck in his cultivation, seemed to get even more irritated.

...

“Do as you see fit,” he said, waving his hand.

“Yes!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

…

At this moment, Qin Yu was rushing to the Yan family.

However, this place was too far away from the Yan family. With Qin Yu’s speed, he would probably die of exhaustion on the way.

“It seems like I’ll have to rely on the formation.” Qin Yu sighed.

However, he had no money in hand and could not even afford to go to the station.

After much thought, Qin Yu decided to sell two ores for money.
