Chapter 1690: Chapter 1,690, Rashomon! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Zhao Jing had already been driven mad. He had never expected that after stepping into the reversion void stage, he would be in such a sorry state in this battle!

His internal Qi surged, and in an instant, his aged face actually became younger!

The wrinkles on his face disappeared bit by bit, and his originally stooped body also straightened up at this moment!

In just a few short seconds, Zhao Jing had already changed from a white-haired stooped old man to a high-spirited young man!

His internal Qi also increased at this moment, and his entire person seemed to have unlimited battle strength, extremely terrifying!

The surrounding people all cried out in surprise, because this was the power that transcended time!

“The reputation of the reversion void stage is well-deserved!”Someone cried out in surprise.

“Transcended time? How can a reversion void stage do it?”

“I’m afraid that he is burning his blood essence and fighting to the death!”

“To be able to force a reversion void stage to such a state, I’m afraid that only Xiao Sheng in this world can do it!”

Everyone was shocked, but only Xiao Sheng still had that indifferent expression.

That narrow and long eyes carried an icy cold killing intent. He raised his hand and formed a seal, slamming it toward Zhao Jing!

However, after burning his blood essence, Zhao Jing’s strength had once again increased. Xiao Sheng’s mark was easily dissolved by him. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived in front of Xiao Sheng!

Xiao Sheng did not choose to face him head-on. His body sank into the darkness and reappeared a short distance away!

This method was likely due to his control over the power of space to the extreme. Otherwise, he would definitely not be able to do this!

“Internal Qi!”Zhao Jing raised his head and roared furiously. His aura surged as if everything in this world was about to be used by him. Countless rays of light headed straight for Xiao Sheng!

Xiao Sheng raised his hand and used the Rashomon sect. Relying on the Rashomon sect, he had almost completely neutralized all of the spells!

“Xiao Sheng, do you only know how to escape! ?”Zhao Jing roared loudly.

With that said, Zhao Jing charged over once again. He used his life-or-death fighting style to force Xiao Sheng back repeatedly!

No matter how strong Xiao Sheng was, he was still unable to deal with a frenzied return to void stage cultivator.

Everything around him was destroyed. Nothing could be seen clearly. There were ruins everywhere.

The ground was in ruins, and the sky was covered by smoke and dust. This was an unprecedented battle.

“Bang!”

Finally, Zhao Jing succeeded. His thin and small palm slapped Xiao Sheng’s chest, forcing Xiao Sheng back a few steps!

Immediately after, a trace of fresh blood dripped out from the corner of Xiao Sheng’s snow-white mouth. His long hair swayed in the breeze, looking somewhat beautiful.

“Could it be that Xiao Sheng is going to lose?”

“Facing a person at the reversion void stage who is burning his blood essence, Xiao Sheng has already done it perfectly.”

“Yeah, no matter how strong he is, the gap in cultivation is still too big. It is a horizontal ditch that can not be crossed.”

Zhao Jing raised his head and laughed loudly. His face revealed a trace of madness as he roared, “Xiao Sheng, you will definitely die in my hands today!”

Xiao Sheng raised his hand and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.

After that, he looked coldly at Zhao Jing. Countless rays of light appeared behind him!

It was a phenomenon! It was Xiao Sheng’s phenomenon!

A tall figure appeared behind him and slowly took shape!

Everyone stared intently at Xiao Sheng, their eyes filled with shock and anticipation!

After a long while, a tall figure appeared behind him!

What was shocking was that the strange phenomenon that Xiao Sheng had formed was actually himself!

Qin Yu could not help but be shocked! He thought that he was the only one in the world who was like this. He did not expect Xiao Sheng to be the same!

His Dao technique was also self-respecting! This was an incomparable conceit!

Zhao jing sneered and said, “Anomaly, is it useful? The gap between our realms can not be smoothed out through spells!”

Xiao Sheng did not say a word. He urged the anomaly and raised his palm to slap at Zhao Jing!

In an instant, it was as if the sky had collapsed. The Sky and earth were dark and incomparably terrifying!

This was the condensation of all the DAO technique and was extremely terrifying. It was also the convergence of Xiao Sheng’s battle intent!

This seemingly simple palm had actually fused with almost all of his dao technique!

Zhao Jing could also see that this palm was not simple. He did not dare to be negligent. He immediately spat out a ray of light and prepared to chop this palm.

“Bang!”

At the instant of the collision, everything was shattered. The powerful airflow caused an extremely powerful whirlwind to blow up on the battlefield!

“Clang Clang Clang!”

Under this palm strike, Zhao Jing was actually forced back a few steps and was almost slammed into the ground!

If it wasn’t for his powerful strength, this palm strike would have already taken his life!

“How could this be!”Zhao Jing’s expression was somewhat ugly.

He had already exhausted all of his trump cards and spells, but he still wasn’t able to gain any advantage!

Xiao Sheng’s strength had far exceeded his imagination!

At this moment, the phenomenon behind Xiao Sheng moved again.

He raised his huge palm and pressed it against Zhao Jing.

The next second, a pitch-black radiance condensed!

This radiance was extremely huge, like a disc, incomparably terrifying!

When everyone saw this radiance, they could not help but be shocked!

“It’s the ravenous sect, the ravenous sect that was formed from the phenomenon!”

“Such a terrifying ravenous sect, doesn’t it mean that it’s going to swallow this entire world? !”

“The Ravenous sect that was activated by the phenomenon can probably swallow everything!”

Zhao Jing’s pupils couldn’t help but shrink. Since he dared to come, he naturally had a way to deal with the ravenous sect!

But even so, when he saw the ravenous sect that was activated by the phenomenon, he was still greatly shocked and incomparably terrified!

“Rashomon…”Zhao Jing gritted his teeth. He immediately took out a ball of blood from his glabella and shouted, “So what if it’s Rashomon? I, Zhao Jing, am not afraid of You!”

After saying that, Zhao Jing threw a ball of blood essence into the air. Then, the blood essence actually emitted a radiance. It was like a sun, incomparably hot, forming a sharp contrast with the Rashomon!

“I’m afraid this Zhao Jing has gone mad. He has unleashed so much blood essence. If he were to lose, I’m afraid he would no longer have the ability to fight.”

“Looks like he doesn’t care about anything else in order to defeat Xiao Sheng.”

“If he were to lose to a mighty figure at the reversion void stage, I’m afraid that history would be changed.”

For a moment, everyone was filled with emotions, but most of them were still looking forward to it.

One bright and one dark, the two rays of light collided at this moment!

The Rashomon sect was incomparably overbearing, as if it wanted to absorb everything within, and the disc formed from blood essence was no exception. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The blazing rays of light moved towards the Rashomon sect, and in a short moment, it collided with the Rashomon sect!

At this moment, the blazing rays of light began to expand, emitting an extremely intense energy, as if it wanted to transform the Rashomon sect into Dao!

The two rays of light began to come to a deadlock. Zhao Jing gritted his teeth and poured almost all of his internal Qi into the radiance!

Everyone broke out in cold sweat at that moment, because no one knew what the final outcome of this battle would be!

“Ah! !”

At that moment, Zhao Jing let out another explosive shout. He once again took out a drop of blood essence and shot towards the radiance!
