Chapter 2697: The Starry Sandworm

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was strange. What was with that violent holy energy? It was different from the other holy energy.

The violent holy energy just now seemed to have a life of its own. It gave Qin Yu an extremely dangerous feeling.

“Go and explore!”

Although his current holy body was in the Great Success stage, he had to consume lots of energy every time he used it.

Although the holy energy here was much denser than the outside, it was still far from the one contained in this kind of ore.

This was especially true for the crystal ore. The difference was even greater.

Qin Yu had to think of a way to collect more ore considering the master in his sea of consciousness.

Just as Qin Yu was about to enter the mine, a figure suddenly landed beside him.

“Brother, don’t misunderstand. I have no ill intentions.”

Seeing Qin Yu staring at him, the man quickly waved his hand.

“My name is Xi Ming, Ruoyao’s senior brother. She has told me about you.”

Xi Ming said in a deep voice. Seeing that Qin Yu was still vigilant, he took out a ring.

“Junior sister Ruoyao gave this to me. She said that you’ll know when you see this.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. This was indeed the ring that Ruoyao had worn.

“I don’t have any other intentions. I just want to remind you that this mine doesn’t only represent the people you see on the surface. Therefore, you must know your limits when you enter.”

“What do you mean?”

Qin Yu frowned.

“For example, the Guardian of Order, the God Slayer, and other well-known factions. The Path of Heaven Academy and the Upper Dome are also among them. These represent the greatest factions in the core region. These factions naturally disdain doing these dirty things on the surface. However, you have to Imow one thing. Most of the blood and sweat ore obtained here are handed over to these sects, and this location belongs to the Path of Heaven Academy.”

Xi Ming said with a smile. After he finished speaking, he made an inviting gesture.

He had already reminded Qin Yu and returned the favor he owed Ruoyao. As for the rest, it was none of his business.

“Thank you.”

Qin Yu directly entered.

“What happened to Ruoyao?” Qin Yu suddenly turned and asked.

“She offended Yi Han’s brother, Yi Yun.”

Xi Ming didn’t say much. He left after saying that.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. This lady who always called herself elder sister gave him a good feeling.

However, he had just arrived here and had no idea where to go. He couldn’t even find a place to help.

After hesitating for a moment, Qin Yu turned around and entered the mine.

This was an extremely wide mine cave.

There were still remnants of ore crystals left after digging on the rock walls on both sides. The moment Qin Yu entered, he felt a heart-wrenching holy energy. After entering the ground, Qin Yu discovered a tunnel nearly ten meters high had been dug out.

The tall mine looked like an underground maze.

“As expected of the core domain, this is an exaggerated amount of Saint Crystals.”

Qin Yu suddenly sped up. After nearly two hours, he heard the sound of digging coming from the depths of the mine.

One could imagine that this place had already been mined to an extremely deep position. Painful moans could be heard from time to time.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu sneered. He saw a bat stop not far from him.

The bat had been following him for a long time. It seemed that someone had their eyes on him.

At this moment, an old man was smiling as he drank tea in a room outside the mine.

He was half-lying on the recliner, with two girls kneeling behind him and fanning him.

There was also an ugly-looking woman kneeling in front of him. It was Zui Rao, who had suffered a loss earlier.

At this moment, she was no longer as arrogant as before. She only knelt on the ground and waited for the old man to speak.

“Trash! ”

The old man smashed the teacup in his hand on her head.

“I’m useless. This person probably has a supreme treasure with him. Even the snake demon Xiao Qing was almost killed in one move. I beg master to help me.”

Hearing the old man’s words, Zui Rao finally let out a sigh of relief.

This person was an expert at the Path of Heaven Academy. All this time, the majority of the ore she obtained had been given to this old man.

His strength was amazing. There was once a Dao Realm level 6 who wanted to cause trouble in her mine and he killed him in one move.

“Go. He’s in our No. 1 mine right now.”

A clone token was stuck into the ground. When Zui Rao saw this token, she was overjoyed.

With this token, she could directly summon the old man if she was no match for Qin Yu.

She thought that she should be able to defeat Qin Yu, but she especially came here to ask for another guarantee out of the uneasiness in her heart.

This was her cautious attitude for so many years, which was why she could live for so long.

“Yes, sir! I’ll go and kill this brat!”

Zui Rao’s knees slowly moved as she retreated.

“Grandpa, what’s the point of keeping this trash? She’s disgusting.”

A man behind the old man said.

He grabbed the girl beside him and bit her neck. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The young girl’s trachea was directly bitten off. Her face was ashen, but she still controlled herself and did not dare to struggle. It was as if she was afraid of angering the young man and she would end up worse than death.

She didn’t dare to struggle at all until she died.

The young man directly threw her body, which was still warm, onto the ground as if he were throwing a piece of trash.

The dozen or so people serving him seemed to be used to it. They just lay on the ground slightly since they were afraid to provoke him.

“My good grandson, although this person is ugly, she still has some ability. We have worked with many people in the Endless Mine for so many years. This woman is the one who pays the most crystals every month, which has also earned me a high reputation in the sect. If you don’t want to see her next time, I’ll let her stay outside. However, you have to listen to me. Don’t cause trouble everywhere. There are a few people in the Endless Mine that even I can’t afford to offend.”

Tang Yi coaxed the young man lovingly.

‘What? I don’t believe it!”

The young man said with a frown. He knew his grandfather’s strength very well. Who would there be that his grandfather couldn’t offend?

“I didn’t lie to you, Zishang! Something big might happen in the Endless Mine. There might be Starry Sandworms here. The ore reserves here had decreased by nearly 50% in a short time! This matter has attracted the attention of the higher-ups. Even the God Eater has sent someone. Moreover, the Guardian of Order Guild has sent someone with an eight-star medal. If you provoke them, I really can’t protect you.”

Tang Yi said seriously.

Upon hearing the eight-star medal and the appearance of the God Eater, Zishang’s arrogant face immediately withered.

It seemed that his grandfather had not lied to him. These two factions were not the Path of Heaven..
