Chapter 1050: Chapter 1,050, return to the Heaven Gate 

Compared to Qin Yu’s immature fighting formula, Jiang he was obviously more familiar with it.

The increase in his internal Qi also shocked Chi Hou!

“Eh? You Bunch of ants are really surprising,”Chi Hou said in a low voice.

Before he could finish his words, Jiang he had already arrived!

His extremely fast speed shocked Chi Hou! Beads of sweat appeared on his forehead!

Jiang he’s palm slammed onto Chi Hou’s chest, and a ray of light burst out!

“Boom!”

Chi Hou’s body was instantly pierced through and smashed into the ground!

“What speed!”Chi Hou’s expression changed drastically!

He couldn’t care less about his injuries as he hurriedly stood up and retreated!

Jiang he naturally wouldn’t give him a chance to escape. He immediately chased after him using the ‘xing’Formula!

The situation was reversed in an instant. Chi Hou fled in a sorry state!

However, his speed was not worth mentioning in front of the ‘xing’formula. Soon, he was beaten by Jiang he until he bled non-stop and was covered in wounds!

“Impossible! Impossible!”Chi Hou roared crazily. He was extremely unwilling to accept this!

However, Jiang he would not listen to his nonsense. After all, the ‘Dou’formula had a time limit. He had to get rid of Chi Hou before he disappeared!

Chi Hou’s explosive secret technique was fully displayed as he fled frantically.

It had to be said that his vitality was indeed tenacious enough. Even though his body had been shattered, he still continued to flee. Even his internal Qi did not show signs of weakening!

This was the reason why Gu Zizhen had sent him on an expedition! Chi Hou’s secret technique was to reassemble his body. His vitality was extremely tenacious!

In the second secret realm.

Gu Zizhen’s expression became increasingly gloomy.

Zhai Xing’s words lingered in his ears for a long time.

“Realm master, I’ve always had something to say.”At this moment, a young man walked over from the side.

This young man’s name was Xuan Qi, and he was Gu Xinghe’s good friend. He was also the youngest martial saint in the second secret realm.

“I’ve never doubted Master Zhai Xing’s loyalty to you. However, if a person’s power is too great, it’s very easy to lose oneself,”xuan qi said.

Gu Zizhen narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly, “You want me to reduce Zhai Xing’s power?”

“That’s right. As far as I know, almost all the martial artists in the second mystic realm listen to Zhai Xing. If one day he wants to rebel, it’s not a good thing for you,”Xuan Qi continued.

“Moreover, Zhai Xing is too soft-hearted. People who are too soft-hearted are not suitable to lead troops.”

Gu Zizhen remained silent, but these words had taken root in his heart.

...

The surroundings of the second mystic realm were barren.

It seemed that any place near the boundary would be easily abandoned, and the second mystic realm was no exception.

The people living at the boundary were almost all at the bottom of the second mystic realm.

At this moment, there was a young man sitting here, putting something under the ground.

Not only that, he even bit his finger and dripped his blood into it.

“Big Brother, what are you doing?”At this moment, a teenager walked forward and asked with some doubt.

The teenager raised his head to look at the teenager and said coldly, “What do you think?”

The teenager scratched his head and said, “I don’t know.”

The teenager did not say anything. He slowly stood up and looked down at the teenager. Then, he sneered and said, “Little Bastard, don’t blame me for being ruthless. If you want to blame someone, blame your bad luck!”

After saying that, the young man waved his hand and directly shook the young man into a bloody mist!

After doing all this, the young man couldn’t help but spill a trace of blood from the corner of his mouth, as if he had suffered some kind of injury.

“Damn it... that masked woman was actually resurrected in this life...”the young man wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth.

He was none other than the sky blood rainbow that had disappeared for a long time!

The previous failure and the fear in his heart had caused his body to suffer injuries that could not be healed for a long time.

And because of the masked woman’s existence, Heavenly Blood Rainbow did not dare to continue moving in this world.

Therefore, he turned his gaze to the second mystic realm!

There were more martial artists here, and their cultivations were even stronger! Once the mystic technique was set up, he would definitely be able to recover his strength!

“Qin Yu, speaking of which, I have to thank you. If it wasn’t for you attacking the second secret realm, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have had the chance...”Tian Xuehong sneered repeatedly.

He wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and walked towards the next direction.

...

The Heaven Gate was in a state of decline. Chi Hou’s body was shattered and reassembled. His primordial spirit was extremely unique. No matter how many times his body was damaged, it would not be damaged.

Most importantly, his body recovered extremely quickly. He could reassemble within a minute of being shattered.

This also made it very difficult for Jiang he to take him down.

And the longer it dragged on, the more disadvantageous it would be for Jiang he.

Once the battle word formula disappeared, it would be almost impossible to take down Chi Hou.

“Damn it, I must get my hands on this spell! This is simply a divine skill!”Chi Hou could not help but curse in his heart!

This Jiang he was clearly only at the early-stage of the martial saint realm, yet he was able to beat Chi Hou to the point where he was unable to retaliate at all!

“Boom!”

At this moment, Jiang he’s large palm had already covered Chi Hou’s body and shattered it once again!

However, Jiang he knew very well in his heart that the fighting formula could not be maintained for too long.

If this continued, Chi Hou would sooner or later be able to wait for an opportunity to counterattack.

“It’s a good thing that the disciples of the Heaven Gate have already been moved to a safe place.”Jiang he looked around.

Chi Hou who was not too far away laughed maniacally and said: “So what if you have great capabilities? You can not kill me at all! The Heaven Gate will definitely fall!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Before he could finish his words, Jiang he struck out with a huge palm and sent Chi Hou flying once again.

In the Fey City.

Immortal Crane led a total of three hundred men and set off towards the fire country.

Other than these three hundred people, Immortal Crane’s four valiant generals also followed behind.

A total of five martial saints. Even the second mystery dimension would have to consider this power!

“Once I have incited the rebellion of star Seizer, the second mystery dimension will be within my grasp.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He could not wait to take down the second mystery dimension and meet that so-called ancient array platform.
