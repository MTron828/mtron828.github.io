Sending My Friend Off, Chen Shuang

The bodies of the three human race Saints and most of the Saint Levels completely vanished in the explosion.

Even the divine flames they had obtained completely vanished from this world.

The other Saint Levels, except two unlucky ones who happened to be caught in the middle and killed, almost all used their trump cards to save their lives.

Moreover, when the Netherworld Ghost King had just sent a voice transmission, they had already prepared to evacuate from this area.

This void did not recover after a long time.

The enormous energy seemed to have completely shattered the rules of this expanse of heaven and earth, turning this place into a land of nothingness.

“Three idiots. They still wanted to stop them at such a dead end. They have wasted the divine flames on them!”

Shadowless Divine Hand, Jue Chen sneered and said. The other two human race Saints beside him slowly appeared.

After exchanging a glance, they separated vigilantly.

Even though they were all Saints of the human race, at this point, each carried supreme treasures related to the Saint Kingdom. Consequently, there was a lack of trust among them.

Even though they were all Saints of the human race, at this point, each carried supreme treasures related to the Saint Kingdom. Consequently, there was a lack of trust among them.

In the Azure Rock Forest.

“I was almost sucked into the explosion. If I were sucked into it, I probably couldn’t leave.”

Immortal Crane opened his palm, and the divine flame surged left and right in its palm but could not break through the area in his palm.

“Hmm? Do you still think of self-destruct? Do you really think I don’t have any methods

Immortal Crane stared at the chaotic divine flame, and a tremendously powerful soul pressure pressed it down.

“Keep this good fortune well. There will be a time in the future when you will be useful to me.”

Immortal Crane said softly, and the divine flame rune in his hand floated up.

As the people behind him saw the floating and moving divine flames, a look of longing appeared on their faces. Even Xiao Sheng, calm all along, could not help but have a slightly hurried breath.

But without this divine flame, no matter how heaven-defying one’s talent was, one could not become a Saint. “Lord Immortal Crane, please bestow me with divine flame!”

Many demonic beasts knelt.

Xiao Sheng hesitated for a moment before he finally got down on one knee and lowered his head.

Immortal Crane smiled and released the divine flames in his hand.

Twenty divine flames or so floated in the air and entered the souls of the people Immortal Crane had chosen.

They were the three divine beasts, Xiao Sheng, and the various ranked kings of the demon race.

During the battle with Qin Yu and the Saintess Gu, the Azure Dragon’s body was contaminated with the source of poison. Now, its strength had already degraded to the Tribulation Third Level. It was not even qualified to come before Immortal Crane.

“Why? My strength is clearly superior to this kid’s. Why does this human race b*stard get the divine flame while I don’t?”

At this moment, a demonic ape among those from the demon race that were not chosen roared angrily.

It clenched its huge fist tightly. At this moment, a black halo gathered around its fist, and terrifying power caused a gust of wind to stir up in the cave abode. “How dare you! Don’t be impudent in front of the great Lord Immortal Crane!”

The Vermilion Bird angrily rebuked. Her body suddenly blocked in front of the demonic ape.

“It’s based on my will, Immortal Crane. Do you have any objections?”

Immortal Crane passed through the Vermilion Bird with a step and stood before the demonic ape.

Looking at Immortal Crane’s indifferent eyes, the demonic ape shuddered, and a sense of fear of death enveloped him.

At this moment, he instantly woke up from that impulse. He suddenly prostrated on the ground, and his enormous demon body trembled.

“Bang!”

However, its body stopped shaking in an instant. The enormous demonic ape’s body fell to the ground like a pile of soft rotten meat. Its soul was easily wiped out in such a manner.

Almost all from the demon race trembled imperceptibly. Although Immortal Crane had always appeared approachable, the might of the Saint Level could not be offended.

But the demonic ape had just done it.

A fifth-level demonic ape cultivated for nearly 3,000 years had fallen silently in the holy land of the demon race.

“There must be a reason for my choice. After arriving at the Dao Mystical Saint

Kingdom, let’s work together to gather the Dao Mystical Heart of Saint

Kingdom with all our strength. With every Heart of Saint Kingdom you obtain, your strength will increase. If we can gather all 81 Heart of Saint Kingdom, the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom will become the Saint Kingdom of our demon race.”

Immortal Crane said softly.

“Lord, if the demon race gathers all the 81 Heart of Saint Kingdom, who will become the Lord of this Saint Kingdom?”

The divine beast, the black tortoise, hesitated for a moment before asking. “It relies on each individual’s abilities. Go, don’t resist.”

Immortal Crane revealed a meaningful smile and snapped its fingers.

The 20 people from the demon race before him, including Xiao Sheng, had a wisp of internal qi that entered their bodies.

The bodies of all from the demon race suddenly exploded, and the divine flame mark in their souls shone with brilliant light.

All the souls felt a pulling force from afar that brought them through the crystal wall of the two worlds, drifting toward the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

It was the summoning power of the Saint Kingdom, and even the crystal walls of the two worlds could not stop it.

The reason why Saints did not die was that after their bodies exploded, their souls would also be summoned by the divine kingdom.

This happened in the ghost realm, the human world, and the monster territory. The Saint-Level living beings who had obtained the divine flames would choose their spokespersons and fly to the distant kingdom.

Various arrangements were completed within a short period.

One soul after another entered the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

At this moment, in this kingdom, the sky was vast and boundless. The air in the sky was clear and translucent, without a trace of dust.

However, the sky slowly dimmed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The divine flames that brought souls to the kingdom had exhausted its power completely.

After entering the kingdom, they turned into a breeze and dissipated. As more and more divine flames were extinguished, the sky became increasingly darker.

The sun gradually leaned toward the horizon, and the sky was dyed orange, giving people a warm and peaceful feeling.

When the last divine flame was extinguished, a crisp sound rang out in the sky as if something had broken.

Dao Enlightened Master Chen Shuang’s soul completely dissipated in this Saint Kingdom. This Kingdom of Saint, which had stood for an unknown time, had now become a kingdom without a master.

The meteor-like light suddenly shot out and disappeared in all directions before returning to silence.

The first eternal night began to arrive in this Kingdom of Saint without the night.

A deep wail echoed in every corner of heaven and earth. Blood rained down from the sky, and red raindrops fell on the ground, dyeing the world red. “Sending off my friend, Chen Shuang.”

Zi Yang looked at the blood rain falling from the sky and revealed a complicated expression for the first time..
