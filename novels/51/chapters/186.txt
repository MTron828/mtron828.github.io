Upon hearing their words, Yang Jing was stunned.

Just now, they were still calling her name with adoration, but in the blink of an eye, she was about to be sent to her doom!

“You guys...” Yang Jing’s expression was extremely ugly, and she was speechless for a moment.

“Did you hear that? If you don’t cooperate, they will all die,” the robber sneered.

Yang Jing gritted her teeth and said, “Don’t you dare touch me. Kill me if you can!”

The two robbers immediately burst into laughter when they heard that.

The passengers outside were even more furious!

“Yang Jing, why are you so selfish?”

“Exactly. Do you want us to die with you?”

“To think that we are your fans. We will no longer be your fans in the future!”

“Hurry up and cooperate. Otherwise, we won’t let you off the hook!”

The crowd’s shouts made the two robbers’ smiles even brighter.

Yang Jing’s expression was ashen.

She gritted her teeth and said, “Didn’t you say that you only want money? You’re not keeping your word!”

“Hahaha, are you trying to reason with robbers? Are you out of your mind?” The two of them couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Don’t worry, we will let you guys watch as well.” Then, the robbers looked at the tourists outside.

The eyes of the tourists instantly lit up!

They had always seen Yang Jing on TV, but they didn’t expect to be able to enjoy such a scene today!

It was really a blessing in disguise!

“You guys...” Yang Jing was so angry that her whole body was trembling. She looked at Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu was still unmoved, as if he couldn’t hear anything.

At this moment, Yang Jing suddenly felt despair.

“Don’t waste your efforts. Don’t worry, Superstar, we will make you comfortable.” After saying that, the two robbers walked towards Yang Jing with lecherous looks in their eyes.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who was beside Yang Jing, suddenly emitted rays of golden light!

Although this ray of light wasn’t very strong, it still attracted the attention of the robbers!

“Huh? What is this thing?” The two people said in surprise.

“As expected of a celebrity. This kid is probably Yang Jing’s special effects expert.” At this time, one of them reacted.

“Tsk tsk, I have to say, the special effects nowadays are really awesome. It’s so realistic.”

The two of them looked at Qin Yu and couldn’t help but click their tongues in wonder.

Soon, the golden light on Qin Yu’s body began to slowly condense and finally attached to Qin Yu’s body.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body seemed to be covered in a layer of golden armor that looked extremely dazzling!

“D*mn, this special effects expert isn’t done yet.” The two robbers were getting impatient!

After saying that, the two of them stretched out their hands and grabbed Qin Yu.

They wanted to pull Qin Yu to the side, but they found that Qin Yu was like a rock and he didn’t move at all!

“Hmm? This kid is quite strong.” The two of them immediately exerted all their strength and pulled Qin Yu with all their might.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes opened!

He lowered his head to look at the golden light that was lingering around his body, and muttered in a low voice, “My body... seems to have become a bit harder.”

Every breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Stage would unleash his strength to the maximum.

Along with the increase in his strength, Qin Yu’s physical body had undergone a qualitative change!

“Brat, get lost quickly. Do you hear me?!” The robber beside him roared angrily.

Only then did Qin Yu clearly see the situation in front of him.

He frowned and said, “Who are you guys?”

“Who are we? We’re robbers! Get lost quickly!” The two robbers said impatiently.

Qin Yu said, “Oh, you guys are robbers.”

Yang Jing hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, they robbed everyone’s money, and... and they also want to do something bad to me...”

The two robbers said impatiently, “So what if we are robbers? What can you do about it? Take out your money!”

“I have no money.” Qin Yu shook his head. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“No money? You f * cking sit in the first-class cabin and you say you don’t have money? ?” The two robbers said angrily.

Qin Yu sneered. “Even if I have money, I won’t give it to you. If you return all the money you robbed to them now, I can spare you.”

“Are you f * cking courting death!?” The two robbers were clearly completely enraged by Qin Yu!

The anger of the two men were instantly directed toward Qin Yu!

They clenched their fists and ruthlessly thrust it towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t dodge, and allowed their fists to land on his body.

“Clang!” A crisp sound rang out! The two men instantly felt their fists go numb, as if they had smashed into steel!

“Use more strength. Haven’t you eaten or something?” Qin Yu said with a half-hearted smile.

The two men’s expressions changed. They were about to speak when Qin Yu slapped their faces!

The two men were instantly sent flying, and they spat out two back teeth from their mouths!

“With this little bit of ability, you actually dared to be robbers?” Qin Yu sneered.

“I’m warning you. Return the money you robbed now, and I can spare your lives,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The two robbers got up from the ground. They glared at Qin Yu and shouted angrily, “Return it? I’m going to kill all of you!”

As soon as these words were said, the expressions of the passengers changed drastically!

“This kid is really a b * stard. Do you want to kill us?!”

“It’s all his fault. It has nothing to do with us!”

“You b * stard, I’m going to cripple you!” The passengers outside were filled with indignation and roared angrily!

Qin Yu looked at these people in shock and shook his head helplessly. “The two of them are the ones who stole your money, not me. Why are you scolding me?”

“F * ck you! If it weren’t for you, we would at most lose some money!”

“It’s because of you b * stard that we are about to lose our lives!”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

“Alright, from now on, your life or death has nothing to do with me,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“F * ck you, who needs you to care?!” Everyone started to curse.

“That’s right, you don’t want to pay, yet you dragged us into it! What the h*ll!”

The two robbers got up from the ground.

They grinned and sneered. “Even if we don’t make a move, they will tear you apart alive!”

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “Before that, I will kill you guys first!”

“Really?” The two robbers sneered. Then, they took out a gun from their waists and pointed it at Qin Yu!

“What’s the use of having good combat skills? I can blast your head open with one shot!”

Qin Yu frowned.

“I wonder if my body can withstand bullets.” Qin Yu was eager to give it a try.

However, after thinking for a moment, Qin Yu still shook his head.

“Saintly Body Technique!” To be safe, Qin Yu still activated the Saintly Body Technique!

For a moment, Qin Yu’s body was wrapped in golden light, and his body flickered with a faint golden hue.

“With the blessing of the Saintly Body Technique, it is probably very difficult for ordinary bullets to hurt me,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Hehe, when are you still playing with special effects?” The two robbers sneered.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Special effects? Try firing to see if it’s a special effect.”
