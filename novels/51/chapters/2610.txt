Chapter 2611: Seizing Opportunities

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Let’s retreat. That black dragon is too powerful. Even if Seifer can’t do anything, there are still many unknown forces in the depths of this place. Moreover, we have just caused such a huge commotion. I’m afraid problems will arise if we stay any longer.”

Liu Da’s expression was grim. He did not care what Fang Xiang was thinking and directly retreated after saying that.

Fang Xiang hesitated for a while before following him.

“By coming here, we have at least accumulated some merit points. When we return, we can exchange for some things to survive the war. As for the final solution, it’s not something we should consider. What we need to do is to survive first. ”

Fang Xiang followed closely behind.

Just as they retreated to the entrance of the cave, there seemed to be a heavy flapping sound in the air.

“Be careful!”

Fang Xiang’s expression changed drastically. His Saint Power mainly enhanced his vision, significantly stressing strengthening visual capabilities.

Therefore, when the black dragon appeared, he immediately alerted.

However, the black dragon was much faster than he had imagined. It was still far away a second ago, but a few seconds later, the violent aura appeared nearby.

The enormous black dragon swooped down toward them. Its body was sufficient to be the most fatal weapon facing these two weak living beings of the human race before him.

“Let’s go all out!”

Liu Da’s face revealed a ferocious expression. At this speed, they had no chance to dodge at all.

In the blink of an eye, he swung his axe toward the dragon’s claw.

The moment the axe came into contact with the black dragon’s half-rotten claw, a massive force erupted from his arm.

A cicada-like sound rang out in the void near Liu Da, and an invisible void power suddenly drilled into his skin. In an instant, his internal qi changed drastically.

“Order of Rules! Magical force!”

Upon contact, the two emitted a metallic clink as if metal striking against each other.

“Slash!”

Liu Da roared, his expression distorted due to overexertion.

Amid a tremendous roar, the axe in his hand forcefully slashed down.

A wound of nearly 20 centimeters opened up on the black dragon’s claw. However, compared to its massive body, the wound appeared insignificant.

“Sizzle!”

The black dragon’s other front claw pierced through Liu Dad’s heart. It then slowly turned its body.

Fang Xiang looked in despair. Facing such a colossal creature, he felt a deep sense of powerlessness.

A rotten breath gushed from the enormous nostrils, corroding Fang Xiang’s body completely.

After that, the black dragon flapped its half-rotten bone wings and flew toward Qin Yu and the others.

On the other end, Qin Yu and the others had arrived at the place where the black dragon was previously.

At this moment, the black dragon was writhing in agony on the ground. A human figure was before the black dragon, but his internal qi had long gone.

“This black dragon seems to be heavily injured! It should have been caused by the massive explosion earlier.”

Ju Wuwei instantly pulled out his Tiger Wing. They would not dare to even think about it if the black dragon were in full battle mode. However, this black dragon was in a tremendously poor state at this point. Therefore, this was the best time to kill it.

Qin Yu and the others had guessed that formidable outsiders had caused the massive explosion earlier. Now, it seemed that they had a conflict with the black dragon and had caused it such severe injury.

“Good opportunity!”

Qin Yu took out the bowstring from his back almost without hesitation.

In an instant, he pulled the bowstring to the limit.

He pulled back nearly 80% of the bowstring.

As he pulled the bowstring, a light arrow condensed from the surrounding energy and instantly appeared in his hand.

“No, it’s still not enough!”

Qin Yu’s fists, arms, palms, and the other parts of his body that had exerted the most strength, as well as the related meridians and bones, emitted immense pain. They seemed no longer able to withstand the backlash of the bowstring.

“Strengthening! ”

Qin Yu used nearly half of his soul’s Saint Power to strengthen the three parts of his body once again.

This was something he had learned from his conversation with Ju Wuwei. With their current Saint Power, the most effective precise allocation was the key to maximizing their abilities.

Under the observation of his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, the parts where he needed to exert force to use the bowstring and even the meridians were distinctively imprinted in his vision.

After these body parts were strengthened by one-third, his bowstring was completely stabilized.

If he were to strengthen his entire body, all the Saint Power he had now would probably be insufficient.

Eighty percent of the bowstring’s power shot out, and the light arrow stabbed the black dragon’s head, resulting in a massive explosion.

The black dragon’s body instantly ignited with massive explosive flames, burning with crackling sounds.

A tremendously foul odor wafted in all directions. However, under Qin Yu’s ultimate arrow, the black dragon actually did not die.

“Quickly kill it! Ju Wuwei! Another black dragon is coming.”

Qin Yu roared. At this moment, after using all the strength in his body, he trembled uncontrollably.

Right now, he could not clench his fist even with all his might. What terrified him the most was that another black dragon appeared in his line of sight.

Without hesitation, Ju Wuwei faced this black dragon on the verge of death.

He directly stabbed his blade through its eyes and pierced through its head, utterly annihilating the dragon.

A violent surge of Saint Power surged into his soul nearly non-stop. Ju Wuwei’s body underwent a massive change instantly. In an instant, he was strengthened to the extreme.

“Ding! ”

“Defend!”

He held his blade horizontally with both hands.

Almost instantly, Tiger Wing bent into a semicircle. Ju Wuwei’s body was pushed back by the force of Tiger Wing’s blade.

However, even so, his face flushed a little.

Blood spurted out from the corners of his mouth. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Despite obtaining the complete Saint Power of a black dragon and strengthening his body, and he had focused all his strength on his defense-related parts, the bones in his arms were slightly deformed from the impact.

However, Ju Wuwei was no match for this black dragon that had won all the battles.

“Crack!”

Ju Wuwei twisted the bones in his arms back and swallowed three Energy Recovery Pills.

He did not stop and advanced instead.

As he advanced, a blade light slashed across the black dragon’s body.

The black dragon lowered its head slightly.

It dodged the knife that slid towards his neck, and two of the scales on his head fell off.

“A rotten creature actually has such battle consciousness!”

Ju Wuwei’s face revealed a solemn expression.

A black dragon with such a terrifying body and a high IQwas destined not to be defeated. He now could only hope that Qin Yu had some solution..
