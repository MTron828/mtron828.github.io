Chapter 347: A Change In Style Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Old Mister Yan paused for a moment.

He said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu, as long as you are willing, I can build a Qin family for you at any time and let this family become a great aristocratic family.”

“Although I don’t have much time left, this bit of time is enough.”

Old Mister Yan’s words were slightly cocky. Just as he said, with Old Mister Yan’s power, even if he was a beggar, he could become a well-known wealthy man.

However, none of these could move Qin Yu’s heart.

He shook his head and said, “Old Mister Yan, perhaps you have misunderstood.”

“If it was for the sake of getting rich, or if it was to climb up the social ladder, the conditions you offered would indeed be difficult to refuse, but to me, those aren’t important at all.”

“What’s important is what kind of life Ruoxue wants, and who she lives with.”

“I’ve said it before. Ruoxue changed my fate. Without her, I would still be a timid son-in-law in Jiangcheng.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. When he mentioned the past, he couldn’t help but feel sad inside.

“Just because you give up now doesn’t mean you can’t have it in the future,” Old Mister Yan played with the chess pieces and said indifferently.

Qin Yu still shook his head and said, “I can give up on other things temporarily, but I can’t do that for Ruoxue.”

“Even if it’s a minute or a second, I don’t want her to become someone else’s bride.”

Old Mister Yan raised his eyebrows and said, “Then Ruoxue might suffer along with you.”

“Even if I have to risk my life, I won’t let her suffer even a little bit,” said Qin Yu.

After saying that, Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at the scattered chessboard.

“Old Mister Yan, let’s play another game,” said Qin Yu as he played with the chess pieces.

“Alright.” Old Mister Yan didn’t ask any further.

Qin Yu’s M.O. suddenly changed drastically in this game.

From his previously steady defensive style, he instantly changed into a decisive and aggressive attack style.

After a few moves, even Old Mister Yan felt a trace of pressure.

This kind of chess technique that completely traded pieces for stones made Old Mister Yan’s heart jump in shock!

Even though Qin Yu lost in the end, it still made Old Mister Yan, who was well-versed in worldly affairs, feel an incomparable sense of pressure!

“Old Mister Yan, not only can I be aloof, but I can also be ruthless.”

Qin Yu put down the last chess piece and said slowly.

Old Mister Yan was a little absent-minded for a moment.

Because the current Qin Yu seemed to have changed into a different person.

In contrast to the gentle and refined Qin Yu from before, what replaced it was indescribable viciousness.

He looked at Qin Yu who had become a little fierce, and was momentarily stunned.

Because... Qin Yu was extremely similar to how Qin Yu’s father was back then!

“Ha, hahaha! Good! Good!” Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but feel overjoyed.

He stood up and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder while saying, “Good, I didn’t misjudge you. Qin Yu, from today onwards, I will acknowledge you!”

Qin Yu also heaved a sigh of relief.

He stood up and said, “Thank you, Old Mister Yan.”

Just as the two of them were chatting idly, Yan Ruoxue came back from outside.

When she saw Qin Yu, who was accompanying Old Mister Yan, surprise flashed across her face.

Before she even tidied herself up, Yan Ruoxue ran upstairs.

“Qin Yu? Why are you here?” Yan Ruoxue asked in surprise.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m here to see Old Mister Yan.”

“Oh really?” Yan Ruoxue raised her eyebrows.

She said jokingly, “You’ve become more daring. Last time, I remember you didn’t have such courage.”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded and said.

“Some qualities are forced out of people.” Qin Yu smiled and said.

Just as Yan Ruoxue said, the last time when Qin Yu came to the Yan family, he was extremely nervous and cautious.

But this time, Qin Yu became much more composed.

“Okay, Ruoxue, since you’re back, let’s eat.” Old Mister Yan stretched and said.

“Okay! You guys talk for a while. I’ll go to the kitchen.” Yan Ruoxue seemed to have the intention to personally cook for him.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “I’ll accompany you.”

Yan Ruoxue froze, then she nodded and said, “Okay, then come with me.”

The two of them walked down from upstairs and came to the Yan family’s kitchen.

The kitchen of the Yan family was extremely big, to the point of absurdity.

Just a kitchen alone occupied more than 100 square meters.

The entire kitchen had all kinds of ingredients. Whether it was domestic or foreign, the Yan family didn’t lack any.

“I just learned how to cook fish recently. Today, I’ll cook it for you to taste.” Yan Ruoxue went to the pond to choose a fat and delicious fresh fish and placed it on the chopping board.

After the fish was processed, Yan Ruoxue used a knife to cut marks on the fish’s body and stuffed onions, ginger, and other big ingredients into the cracks.

Then, Yan Ruoxue dipped her hand in the ingredients and smeared them on the fish’s body. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“This fish needs to be marinated for a while before the flavor can get in.” After finishing all this, Yan Ruoxue wiped her sweat and said.

Qin Yu praised, “This technique of yours doesn’t seem to be beginner level.”

“That’s right. In order to learn how to cook, she cut her fingers several times.” The chef at the side laughed.

Yan Ruoxue glared at him and rolled her eyes. “Shut up!”

When the chef heard this, he immediately smiled.

At this moment, Old Mister Yan walked alone to the rooftop.

The butler had been waiting on the rooftop for a long time. When he saw Old Mister Yan, he quickly walked over.

“Old Mister.” The butler bowed slightly.

Old Mister Yan looked into the distance and said coldly, “How is it?”

The butler quickly said, “Old Mister, I have checked. There are rumors saying that your days are coming to an end and that you are at the end of your life.”

“There are even rumors that you are having difficulty eating and drinking. I am afraid that these people can’t wait any longer.”

Old Mister Yan put his hands behind his back and snorted coldly. “Someone is adding fuel to the fire in the dark. They just want to test everyone.”

After Old Mister Yan’s reminder, the butler quickly understood.

Since the Yan family was able to climb to their current position, they naturally had many enemies in the dark.

It was unknown how many people wanted to see them fall.

“Just as you said, many families are stirring up trouble. There are even people who are starting to take sides,” the butler said as he turned sideways.

Old Mister Yan’s expression was cold.

Even though he wasn’t a martial artist, his powerful aura still made people tremble.

“Go prepare a banquet and tell them that my birthday is coming,” Old Mister Yan said coldly.

“Birthday?” The butler was a little surprised.

Old Mister Yan said coldly, “I want to tell those people that I, Yan Yunheng, am still alive. It’s best that they all behave themselves!”

Old Mister Yan paused for a moment when he said this.

His expression softened a little as he said indifferently, “It’s also a good opportunity to put Qin Yu in the spotlight.”
