1954 Distraught Si Shifeng

There was nothing that they could do, so a few of them could only follow him.

If Qin Yu took the opportunity to escape, it would do more harm than good to them.

Along the way, Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and hummed a little tune as if he was taking a stroll in the courtyard. He did not take them seriously in the slightest.

Being so relaxed and at ease made a few of them extremely unhappy.

“You’re going to die soon, but you’re still so relaxed. I’d like to see how long you can last,” a few of them sneered and said.

Qin Yu laughed and said, “There’s no need for you to worry about that. You’d better think about how Si Shifeng is going to restore his reputation after he loses.”

“Young Master Feng will lose? Young Master Feng is…”

“Alright, stop bragging,” Qin Yu quickly interrupted them.

Although these people were angry, they couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu.

Soon, the group arrived at the foot of Sky City.

Qin Yu stopped at the foot of the city tower.

“Let’s go! Why are you standing here?” The burly man berated.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Is there anything wrong with your brain? It wasn’t easy for you to find me outside Sky City, and now you want me to go back? If I go back and don’t come out, won’t you guys be at a loss?”

The burly man was stunned for a moment and seemed to think what Qin Yu said made sense.

“Then I’m warning you. You’d better not leave. I’m going to look for Young Master Feng now,” the burly man pointed at Qin Yu and said.

“I’ll take care of it,” Qin Yu waved his hand and said. “You don’t have to trouble yourself. Let me do it.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took out the man with the mustache’s loudspeaker.

He held the loudspeaker in his hand, cleared his throat, and shouted toward Sky City, “Si Shifeng! I’ve been waiting for you outside Sky City for a long time. Why didn’t you dare to show up? Are you afraid of me, Qin Yu?”

This shout instantly startled the entire Sky City!

Everyone’s expression changed as they stood up and looked into the distance.

“Did you guys hear that? Did you hear something just now?”

“Yes, I heard it. It seems to be Qin Yu! He seems to be making a scene outside Sky City!”

“What? He’s outside Sky City? Didn’t they say Qin Yu had been hiding in Sky City and didn’t dare to leave?”

At this moment, Qin Yu, under the city wall, continued to shout, “Si Shifeng! How long are you going to hide? What’s the point of hiding in Sky City every day? If you’re afraid, say it directly!”

Upon hearing this, there was an uproar in Sky City instantly!

“What? It was actually Si Shifeng who didn’t dare to leave Sky City? Didn’t Si Shifeng claim that Qin Yu didn’t dare to show up? Are we all tricked by him?”

“Whether it’s true or not, we’ll know once we take a look outside the city!”

The group of people hurried out of the city. Even the Prince of Great Xia was startled by Qin Yu’s voice.

“Your highness, should we go and take a look?” a servant beside him said.

“Cough! Cough…” The Prince coughed weakly and then said, “Help me over to take a look.”

When Si Shifeng, sitting in the teahouse and comprehending dao, heard Qin Yu’s clamor, his expression turned extremely ugly.

He looked around and saw everyone seem to be pointing at him. This instantly made Si Shifeng burn with anger.

He had announced in Sky City that Qin Yu did not dare to show up! In the end, it turned out he was the one who was afraid!

“This bunch of trash!” Si Shifeng gritted his teeth. “With so many people guarding him, he could still escape!”

Fortunately, Qin Yu hadn’t left yet, or at least he hadn’t escaped.

Si Shifeng coldly swept his eyes at the surroundings before getting up and quickly rushing out of the city.

Outside the city wall, Qin Yu kept shouting through the loudspeaker.

His voice not only spread throughout Sky City but even in the nearby cities.

Instantly, numerous people rushed to the vicinity. They stayed very far away, secretly watching.

“Shut the f*ck up!” the burly man scolded.

However, Qin Yu did not listen to him. Not only did he not intend to stop, but she also shouted even louder.

Just as the burly man was about to snatch the loudspeaker away by force, Si Shifeng finally appeared at the city gate.

He walked toward Qin Yu step by step, and the coldness and anger on his face were clearly seen.

Seeing Si Shifeng’s figure, Qin Yu grinned.

He put away the loudspeaker and said with a smile, “Si Shifeng, you finally f*cking dare to come out now! Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for you? It had been more than a month! I thought you didn’t dare to come out!”

Si Shifeng gritted his teeth and said, “Don’t talk nonsense! You’re the one who’s hiding!”

“I hide your a*s! Didn’t we agree on three days? Why are you still in Sky City after three days, and I’m outside the city?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Si Shifeng knew he couldn’t win against Qin Yu in an argument, so he stop arguing with him. He only said coldly, “Enough with the nonsense. I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”

“Yes, I’ve indeed been waiting for you for a long time.” Qin Yu sighed.

After putting away the loudspeaker, he put his hands behind his back and said, “Although this battle has been delayed for a long time because of you, Young Master Feng, it is a good thing that we did not disappoint everyone. You have finally come out. It is not too embarrassing, isn’t it?”

“You shut up!” Si Shifeng was enraged, and an extremely strong killing intent burst out from his body.

Seeing Si Shifeng enraged, Qin Yu grinned and said, “Tsk! Tsk! I was right. You’re angry from embarrassment, aren’t you?”

“Don’t f*cking talk nonsense. Just make your move! Si Shifeng knew that the more he spoke, the more he couldn’t clear his name. Thus he immediately stepped forward.

“Hold on!” At this moment, Qin Yu hurriedly reached out to stop him.

...

“What? Are you afraid?” Si Shifeng asked coldly. “If you’re afraid, kneel on the ground and worship me three times. I might consider sparing you.”

“No! No! No!” Qin Yu waved her hands. “It’s boring to fight like this. We should at least put some stakes on the table, right?”

“Stakes? What stakes?” Si Shifeng’s eyebrows furrowed slightly.

“Chang Mang…” Qin Yu sneered and said. “He’s in your hands, isn’t he?”

Si Shifeng didn’t hide anything. He sneered and said, “That’s right. He is in the Skywater Prison now. How is it?”

“Alright.” Qin Yu’s voice was cold.

He took a deep breath and continued, “If I win, ask your Holy Lord to release Chang Mang.”

“Hahaha!” Si Shifeng instantly started laughing heartily.

“That Chang Mang has probably already died. Let him go? Are you dreaming? Besides, do you think you have a chance to beat me?” Si Shifeng shouted.

“You don’t have to worry about that,” Qin Yu said with a cold face. “I just want to know if you agree or not.”

Si Shifeng placed his hands behind his back and said with a smile, “I can promise you, but you can’t win at all.”

...

“Let’s try it out then.” Qin Yu’s voice became even colder, and his expression grew more serious.

“What if you lose?” At this moment, Si Shifeng suddenly asked.

“If I ever lose, I’m afraid I won’t be able to escape death,” Qin Yu said coldly. “Why are you talking nonsense?”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
