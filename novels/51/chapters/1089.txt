Yao Meng said with a faint smile, “I’ve entered the Scripture depository many times.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

Yao Meng was a careful girl. Since she had been to the Scripture depository, it was very likely that she had flipped through that book.

“What do you know?”Qin Yu looked at Yao Meng and asked.

Yao Meng said, “Before this, I didn’t know much. However, after I broke through to the Martial Saint Realm, I went to visit someone and asked him for relevant information.”

“Who?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

“Tian Jizi,”Yao Meng said with a smile.

“Tian Jizi...”

Qin Yu whispered this name.

This was not the first time he had heard of this person. Previously, the news of him stepping into the martial saint realm was also predicted by this Tian Jizi.

Although Qin Yu was filled with curiosity towards him, he had never visited him before.

The world was vast, and there were countless types of mystical arts. Among them, there were many that Qin Yu could not comprehend.

For example, Tian Jizi’s every prediction.

“What did he say?”Qin Yu stared at Yao Meng and continued to ask.

Yao Meng blinked her big eyes and smiled, “He told me about Ruoxue and the Saint Realm.”

Qin Yu did not say anything, waiting for her to continue.

Yao Meng continued, “According to Tian Jizi’s prediction, the first mystic realm will be destroyed in about a month. At that time, the first mystic realm will no longer exist, and it will become an ancient array formation.”

“Array Formation?”Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with surprise.

Yao Meng grunted and said, “Normally, we have long lost the method to enter the saint realm. But for some reason, Tian Jizi predicted that in this life, the ancient array formation will be completely opened and the passage will be made public.”

“When that time comes, not only will we be able to enter the saint realm, but the people of the saint realm will also be able to come to Earth.”

The more Qin Yu heard, the more alarmed he became.

In a month’s time, the first secret realm would disappear, and the ancient array platform would reappear in the world?

This was too inconceivable, and the speed was beyond Qin Yu’s imagination.

“According to what he said, we haven’t been able to reach the saint-level for many years,”Yao Meng continued.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “Did he say why this life can be opened?”

“No, the secrets of Heaven can not be revealed,”Yao Meng said with a smile.

Qin Yu frowned tightly.

After listening to Yao Meng’s words, everything seemed to make sense.

The holy region could lead to Earth, but Earth could not lead to the holy region.

This was perhaps the reason why there was the existence of the Dao protector profession.

“Did he say a month?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Yao Meng nodded and said, “That’s right. This is also the reason why I rushed to tell you.”

“Once Tian Jizi’s prediction comes true, it means that in a short month’s time, the higher-ups will be able to descend into this world. At that time, I’m afraid you will be in danger.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly, then quickly cupped his hands and said, “Thank you for telling me, Miss Yao.”

Yao Meng smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, you don’t have to be so polite. Ruoxue and I are good friends, so I naturally don’t want to see anything happen to you.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. At this moment, he only felt a huge pressure on his shoulders.

Yao Meng seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s worry. She smiled and said, “Actually, it’s not just you who feels the pressure. It’s the same for us.”

“If the Holy Region Passage is completely opened, then we so-called geniuses might not be worth mentioning anymore.”

“And... according to experience, whenever a new area is opened up, the local weak will become slaves.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Not to that extent. Isn’t there still a Dao Protector?”

“The essence of a dao protector is to protect ordinary people, not us.”Yao Meng shook her head and said.

“We are part of the natural law of cultivation. The survival of the fittest is inevitable.”

After Yao Meng’s Reminder, Qin Yu also realized this problem.

“It seems that we have to hurry.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Yeah.”Yao Meng also sighed slightly.

At this time, she seemed to have thought of something and continued, “There’s one more thing.”

“Miss Yao, please say it.”Qin Yu hurriedly nodded.

Yao Meng said, “This isn’t Tianjizi’s first prediction. It’s said that many years ago, he already predicted this matter.”

“HM?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He predicted what would happen today many years ago?

It seemed that this Tianjizi was quite capable.

“Because the passage between Earth and the Holy Region was broken, many top cultivators used secret techniques to seal their lifespans, waiting for this day to come,”Yao Meng said.

“If the ancient array platform really opens in a month’s time, these sealed cultivators will probably break out of the ground.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m not surprised about this. They didn’t step into the environment of a mighty figure in this world. It’s not a bad choice for them to choose to wait.”

“Mr. Qin, I have to correct you,”Yao Meng said indifferently.

“Currently, we are indeed unable to step into the Almighty Realm. However, this kind of decline has come step by step. It is not achieved overnight.”

A trace of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s eyes.

“You mean... when they sealed their lifespan, they still stepped into the Almighty Realm?”Qin Yu guessed.

“That’s right.”Yao Meng nodded slightly.

“Perhaps at that time, their highest cultivation could only reach the almighty realm.”

“But in our current life, their highest cultivation could only reach the martial saint realm.”

When Qin Yu heard this, a trace of surprise flashed across his face. At the same time, he also felt a trace of relief.

This was more like it. In the billions of years of history on Earth, how could there not be a few powerhouses.

“Mr. Qin, our generation is lucky and unfortunate.”Yao Meng faintly felt somewhat helpless.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, just like what they said, this is a great world.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“We will have a wider world. At the same time, we will welcome an even crueler competition.”Qin Yu sighed in a low voice.
