Chapter 1573: Chapter 1573, the anxious Qin Yu 1 

Looking at absolute dance’s small body, the two godly monarchs could not help but look at each other.

“She seems to have been injured long ago,”said one of the godly monarchs.

“That’s right. It should be an outbreak of old injuries,”said the other godly monarch with a nod.

Following that, the two could not help but sigh, “I really did not expect that this small body actually contained such a terrifying power. The South Province is truly a land of outstanding people.”

“Alright, now it’s time to send her on her way.”

The two people’s expressions became extremely cold. Then, they followed the internal Qi of Jue Wu and shot toward the mountain peak.

On the mountain peak.

Jue Wu used the last of her strength and rushed into the cultivation room.

She stood at the door of the cultivation room. Blood poured out like a fountain, and her body staggered as if she was going to fall at any moment.

Seeing this scene, Wen Da and Wen Er’s expressions changed drastically!

“Aunt Jue Wu, what... What happened to you?”The two people exclaimed.

However, Jue Wu pushed them away. She looked at the people in the room and said in a trembling voice, “There is a dark hole behind the cultivation room. There is a small formation there. Hurry... Hurry up and leave...”

“Aunt Jue Wu, you...”

......

“Cut the crap and leave!”Jue Wu shouted and interrupted them!

Then, Jue Wu used her last bit of strength and reached out her palm toward them.

A gentle force sent Wen Dawen er and her two followers into the dark tunnel.

The dark tunnel was blocked, and Jue Wu also lost her strength.

She supported herself against the wall with difficulty, as if she was waiting for death to come.

...

On the other side, Wen Da and Wen Er were teleported into the distance.

Their faces were ashen, as if they had lost their parents.

As for the two attendants, they were in extreme pain and tears.

“Lord Jue Wu will be fine, she will definitely be fine...”the two attendants knelt on the ground and wept bitterly.

Wen Da and Wen er also had a rarely seen serious expression on their faces.

This formation sent the four of them to a small town dozens of stars away. The small town was quiet and isolated.

“No, I want to go back!”

As soon as they arrived at the small town, the two attendants quickly got up.

They wiped their tears and turned to leave.

Wen Da hurriedly stopped them and shook his head. “Aunt Jue Wu sent us out with great difficulty. If we go back now, won’t we be letting her down?”

“I don’t Care!”The attendant roared. “Even if I die, I will die by Lord Jue Wu’s side!”

After saying that, the two of them didn’t turn around and headed straight for Mount Hua Ning.

Big Wen and Big Wen looked at each other. The two of them gritted their teeth and followed.

Half an hour later, the four of them returned to Mount Hua Ning.

The originally beautiful and beautiful Mount Hua Ning was now a ruin.

They rushed all the way to the cultivation room and were surprised to find that there was actually Jue Wu’s corpse here.

“Lord Jue Wu!”The two attendants shouted with all their might.

They searched the entire Hua Ning mountain, but could not find Jue Wu.

“Where is Aunt Jue Wu...”Wen da could not help but frown.

“Could it be that she was taken away by those two black-robed men...”Wen er said in a low voice.

“Impossible, shut up! Master Jue Wu is invincible in the world. She will definitely be fine!”The two attendants shouted angrily.

Wen Er and Wen er sighed slightly. They obviously didn’t want Jue Wu to be in trouble, but Jue Wu’s condition... ... was probably doomed.

...

At the northern border.

Qin Yu, who was devouring the great Yue fruit, suddenly opened his eyes.

His heart suddenly trembled, and his right eyelid twitched violently.

“What’s going on...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He slowly stood up, and he had a bad feeling in his heart.

“Could it be that something happened to someone...”Qin Yu whispered.

The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more worried he became. He had a feeling that something had happened.

Then, Qin Yu quickly walked out of the room, ready to find Xiao Hai.

And at this moment, Xiao Hai happened to be walking towards Qin Yu’s room.

“Qin Yu, I just happen to have something to look for you.”Xiao Hai quickly walked forward and said.

Qin Yu agreed and waited for his follow-up.

Xiao Hai said in a deep voice, “I just received news that the three great godly monarchs of the northern lands have gone to the Southern Prefecture.”

“What? !”Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed drastically!

This made him, who was already feeling uneasy, immediately become even more worried!

“A few days ago, they went to the Heavenly Cloud sect and had a battle with the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect. In the end, one of them was killed by the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, and the Heavenly Cloud sect also lost an avatar,”Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

At this moment, Qin Yu could not listen to him at all. He hurriedly looked at Xiao Hai and said, “Senior Xiao Hai, I’m afraid I’ll have to temporarily leave the northern border.”

“Oh? Why?”Xiao Hai asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I have a bad feeling. I’m afraid that the two godly monarchs who are still alive will cause trouble.”

Xiao Hai raised his hand and placed it on Qin Yu’s shoulder. He shook his head and said, “Qin Yu, the reason I came to find you this time is to tell you not to leave my side for the time being. It’s to prevent them from taking the opportunity to attack you.”

“Don’t worry, I will be fine,”Qin Yu said. “No matter what, I have to leave the northern border. Otherwise, I will feel uneasy.”

Xiao Hai saw that Qin Yu was so insistent, so he couldn’t say anything more.

“Are you really going to leave the northern border?”Xiao Hai asked.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “I have to leave.”

“Where do you plan to go?”Xiao Hai continued to ask.

“Mount Hua Ning,”Qin Yu blurted out.

The Thing Qin Yu was most worried about right now was absolute dance.

If it was absolute dance in her peak condition, Qin Yu would naturally not be worried.

However, absolute dance’s physical condition really made Qin Yu worried.

“Alright,”Xiao Hai agreed.

At this moment, he took out a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to Qin Yu.

“It just so happens that this is the material needed for the formation. Think of a way to gather it.”Xiao Hai was huge.

Qin Yu took the note and said, “Okay.”

“Also, this formation needs at least six people to activate. I have already thought about it. You, me, Jue Wu, Qu Zhu, and an old friend of mine. In this way, we still need one more.”Xiao Hai continued. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After saying that, Xiao Hai handed Qin Yu a note.

On the note was a name and his address.

“This person is very strong, but he is a mean person. It is very difficult to get his help, but you have to think of a way to convince him to come to the northern border,”Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s mind was filled with absolute dance. Without thinking, he immediately agreed, “Okay, I will try my best.”

After saying that, Qin Yu immediately summoned the Divine Eagle and headed straight for Mount Hua Ning.

It would take a very long time to get to Mount Hua Ning from here. Qin Yu was anxious, so he simply withdrew his figure and used the line word formula to shoot towards Mount Hua Ning.

With the speed of the line word formula, it would only take two days to get to Mount Hua Ning from the northern border. With the time to rest, it would not take more than three days.
