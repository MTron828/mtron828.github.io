Chapter 1138: Chapter 1,138, The Guardian of the Dao 

This aura shook all the internal qi and caused everyone to kneel down in an instant!

Even Yao Qing, who was half a step into the martial saint realm, could not withstand this pressure. His body made cracking sounds!

“Mr. Qin, you... You’ve become a martial saint? !”Yao Qing exclaimed in shock.

Qin Yu did not speak. He slowly raised his hand and grabbed the war machine’s wrist. Then, a huge force came from Qin Yu’s palm.

Under this huge force, the war machine’s wrist twisted at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Crack!”

With a clear sound, the war machine was directly crushed!

Ding Yuan on the second floor immediately opened his eyes wide!

“My Babe!”Ding Yuan shouted with a pained expression!

“You can live freely in the hidden dragon country just by relying on this scrap metal?”Qin Yu said coldly.

In the next second, Qin Yu’s fist was dyed with golden light.

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, his fist instantly smashed towards the war machine!

With just one punch.

This war machine was directly smashed into pieces, turning into pieces and pieces!

Ding Yuan’s face was extremely terrified. He didn’t expect that this young man in front of him actually had such terrifying strength!

“Sir, let’s discuss this! I’m willing to lend you the plane!”Ding Yuan saw that things were not going well and hurriedly changed his words!

Qin Yu sneered, “There’s no need. I’ve said it, the Ding family will disappear from today onwards.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s body floated into the air.

His palm emitted a blazing radiance.

This radiance was like a small sun, condensing in his palm.

In the next second, Qin Yu gently pulled his palm forward.

The radiance fell from the sky, becoming larger and larger.

“Boom!”

The moment it landed, the entire Ding family manor was instantly moved to the ground!

Under this pure spiritual energy, everyone was wiped out in an instant. They didn’t even feel any pain!

Looking at the nearly abandoned Ding family manor, Yao Qing couldn’t help but swallow his saliva. His throat felt dry.

“As expected of Mr. Qin, I thought I had already caught up to you... . .”Yao Qing could not help but laugh bitterly.

Qin Yu looked at Yao Qing and said: “There is already a mighty figure that has been born in this world, your information is too limited.”

Yao Qing turned pale with fright, he still wanted to ask something but was interrupted by Qin Yu with a wave of his hand.

“Hurry up and find a plane to return to the fire country,”Qin Yu said Pyro.

With the private jet of the Ding family, it would not be difficult for the two of them to return to the fire country. It would be a pyro trip to the fire country.

The plane flew across the sky and rushed towards the fire country at an extremely fast speed.

Yao Qing had never expected that the entire world had changed after he had disappeared for more than a year.

“I thought that I was unable to become a martial saint because of the restrictions of heaven and earth. Now, it seems that it is purely a problem with my brain.”On the plane, Yao Qing could not help but mutter.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said: “You are able to step into the half-step martial saint realm in a little over a year’s time. You should be satisfied. Moreover, if you want to step into the martial saint realm, you must rely on comprehending your own dao techniques.”

On the way, Qin Yu told Yao Qing about his experience of stepping into the martial saint realm and asked Yao Qing to find his own dao techniques.

After about four to five hours, the plane finally arrived at the fire country’s pyro.

As soon as he got off the plane, Qin Yu could not wait to rush towards the second mystery dimension.

At this moment, the second mystery dimension had already made its preparations.

Besides the pavilion master and Zhai Xing, the rest of the people had all been evacuated.

They stood at the crack and said quietly, “According to this speed, they will be able to descend into the second mystery dimension the day after tomorrow.”

“That’s right.”There was a hint of worry in the Pavilion Master’s voice.

“This time... I’m afraid we won’t be able to escape this calamity.”

Zhai Xing was quite open-minded. He smiled and said, “Speaking of which, my life can be considered to have been picked up. I’m already satisfied to be able to live for so many more days.”

“You’re satisfied just by living for a few more days? In order to enter the saint realm, those mighty figures would rather seal themselves away for hundreds of years or nearly a thousand years. You’ve only lived for a mere hundred years or so. Are you planning to give up?”

At this moment, a voice came from behind them.

Hearing this voice, the expressions of pavilion master and Zhai Xing changed drastically!

They turned around and looked in shock at Qin Yu, who was walking towards them.

“Qin Yu, you... Why Are You Back?”Zhai Xing’s face was filled with disbelief.

Qin Yu snorted lightly. “Lord Zhai Xing, you guys really went through a lot of trouble.”

“You... You Already Know?”Zhai Xing’s brows were tightly knitted together, as though he was somewhat unwilling.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “This matter was caused by me to begin with. It should be me who solves it.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Qin Yu, Don’t blame senior Zhai Xing. He’s doing this for your own good,”pavilion master said in a low voice.

“Zhai Xing and I have discussed for many days while you were in seclusion. Letting you leave is probably the best method.”

“Qin Yu, you are absolutely no match for those eight mighty figures.”Zhai Xing took a deep breath.

He grabbed Qin Yu’s shoulder and said in a deep voice, “With your talent, you should go and compete with those geniuses of the Holy Region! You Shouldn’t Die Here!”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. No one knew what he was thinking.

“If you really don’t want to leave, go find your father and think of a way to get your father to take action!”Zhai Xing said in a deep voice.

“As long as your father is willing to take action, a mere eight mighty figures aren’t worth mentioning at all!”

However, as soon as these words were said, they were denied by the pavilion master.

She shook her head and said, “I’ve said it before. The Dao Protector can’t possibly take part in this matter. Once he takes action, he will definitely be punished by the Great Dao.”

“Moreover, do you think we can find the Dao Protector with just us?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth. Just as he was about to speak, Yao Qing came forward and said, “Isn’t it easy? Can’t we just find someone to pretend to be the Guardian?”

The scene fell into half a second of silence.

“It seems... reasonable.”Half a second later, Zhai Xing whispered.

“Why didn’t we think of this method?”

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at Yao Qing in surprise.

“You Brat... Your Brain is quite smart...”Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry for a moment.

Yao Qing said proudly, “Over the past year, I haven’t been doing this for nothing. I’ve heard some things about the Dao Guardian.”

“It’s said that no one has seen him. Since no one has seen him, then anyone can be a dao guardian. You can be one, and I can be one too!”

After saying that, Yao Qing’s palm shook as he took out a black robe.

He put on the black robe to cover his face and said mysteriously, “How dare you! If you see a dao protector, hurry up and kneel down!”
