Du Yuan gaped at Qin Yu’s words. Then he commented, “Well, yeah. You have Miss Yan’s backing. Indeed, you don’t have to be afraid of Shen Tian.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh upon hearing Du Yuan’s remark.

To everyone, Qin Yu was just an incompetent bum flaunting his strong connection with the Yan family.

He knew it would be difficult to change people’s perception of him within a short time.

After a few conversations, Qin Yu realized that Du Yuan was not a shady character. In fact, the latter seemed to be a knowledgeable man with good ideals, unlike the other rich kids.

”Mr. Qin!”

Qin Yu turned towards the voice’s direction and caught sight of Lei Hu, who was dashing towards him.

Lei Hu said in delight, “I didn’t expect to see you here!”

His presence came as a surprise to Qin Yu.

Considering Qin Yu’s identity, he shouldn’t have shown up to this cocktail party.

The three of them were sitting silently in an inconspicuous corner in the raucous environment.

As the party carried on, everyone fully indulged themselves in the moment, giving in to their hedonistic desires.

The whole cocktail party was in a tumult. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Soon, Shen Tian strolled in the direction of Qin Yu, the white-haired young man in tow.

”Mr. Qin, Shen Tian is coming,” Lei Hu hurriedly informed Qin Yu.

Nevertheless, Qin Yu remained taciturn with a deadpan face, as if he could not see Shen Tian.

In a blink of an eye, Shen Tian stopped before Qin Yu.

Glaring at Qin Yu, Shen Tian jibed, “Aren’t you a shameless prick to have come here uninvited, Qin Yu?”

Shooting him a gaze, Qin Yu riposted with a smug, “You seem to have misunderstood something here, Mr. Shen. I came here in Miss Yan’s stead.”

Shen Tian glowered at Qin Yu upon hearing that, nearly losing his cool. The white-haired young man next to him emanated a powerful killing intent.

Knitting his brows together, Qin Yu turned his glare to the white-haired young man.

As their gazes met, the murderous aura around them intensified.

”Hmmm. We have a familiar face here.” Shen Tian noticed Du Yuan, who sat next to Qin Yu.

After scrutinizing Du Yuan, Shen Tian patted his head and noted, “Oh, yes! I remember you! You are Du Yuan, right?”

Although feeling irked, Du Yuan bit the bullet and greeted the host, “Pleased to meet you, Mr. Shen.”

With a contemptuous look on his face, Shen Tian snorted, “As I recall, your family wanted to sign a deal with us, right?”

At Shen Tian’s words, awkwardness crept up on Du Yuan but he remained silent.

Shen Tian carried on, “Here’s the thing. I’m giving you a chance to close a deal with us today. But the condition is that you have to slap Qin Yu on his cheeks twice. How does that sound?”

Du Yuan’s face immediately turned sullen because he knew that Shen Tian was poking fun at him.

”You have been pleading with us to sign deals with our company, right? Why don’t you seize the opportunity presented before you?” Shen Tian taunted with a smirk.

Holding back his indignation, Du Yuan replied, trying to maintain his composure, “I’m sorry, but we are not lacking business partners as of now.”

Hearing that, Shen Tian’s expression turned glum.

”There goes your chance! You think you’re somebody now, eh?” Shen Tian snapped.

”I see. Not lacking business partners now, are we? I can make your family go bankrupt tomorrow! Mark my words!” Shen Tian threatened.

It was uncalled for to Du Yuan.

But he was not given any option. He had anticipated this would happen when he first sat next to Qin Yu.

”You can’t put the blame on me. If anything, Qin Yu is the one responsible for this,” Shen Tian accused.

”What an idiot!” Qin Yu mocked.

”Who are you calling an idiot? Are you tired of living?” the white-haired young man beside Shen Tian took a step forward menacingly.

”Who let the dogs out? The owner should put a leash on it,” Qin Yu ridiculed after taking a sip from his glass.

”Why, you little!” The white-haired young man became furious and was about to land a blow on Qin Yu.

Shen Tian stopped him and turned to Qin Yu. A while later, he said with a sly smirk, “Qin Yu, rumor has it that your ex-wife had been cuckolding you for three years and you were kept in the dark the whole time. Is it true?”

The music playing in the background suddenly stopped as he spoke, resulting in everyone hearing the words coming out of his mouth.

Needless to say, he had meant for this to happen.

Qin Yu peered at Shen Tian without saying a word.

”So we’re playing the silent game now, huh?” Shen Tian scoffed.

With a wave of his hand, his men immediately brought Su Yan and Zhao Gang over.

”Since you are being tight-lipped, someone else will help you to answer,” Shen Tian sneered.

He then turned to Su Yan and asked, “To be frank, I’m intrigued to know if you really did cuckold Qin Yu for three years. How did you do it?”

Su Yan had rehearsed the whole thing with Shen Tian earlier. Hence, she uttered shamelessly, “Yes, he had been cuckolded by me since the first day of our marriage.”

Everyone at the scene burst into laughter instantly. They were looking at Qin Yu mockingly.

Nevertheless, Qin Yu remained silently expressionless.

”Hey, I wonder if he even realizes it at all?” Shen Tian questioned.

Su Yan responded with a devious smile, “Well, Qin Yu had no dignity in my household back then. He would not dare to stand if I were to make him squat.

”As a result, he would not dare to question me even if I were to be home late.

”Furthermore, what could he possibly do even if he knew it? He might as well pretend to be ignorant.”
