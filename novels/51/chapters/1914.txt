1915 The Rebellious Yan Ruoxue

Uncle Yan sighed lightly, and a helpless expression showed on his face.

Subsequently, as usual, Yan Ruoxue did not take Uncle Yan’s words seriously.

She was like a rebellious child who had finally found relief and impudence.

That night, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were lying on the grass and looking at the bright stars in the sky.

!!

“It’s so close. It’s like I can grab the stars,” Yan Ruoxue said as she stretched out her hand.

“Which one do you like? I’ll pick for you in the future!” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“I like every single one of them.” Yan Ruoxue turned around and looked at Qin Yu.

Facing each other face to face, they were so close that they could hear each other’s breathing.

Qin Yu’s heart began to beat faster as he looked at the stunningly beautiful face.

The two looked at each other in this manner, and the distance between them grew closer.

Qin Yu reached out and wrapped her arms around Yan ruoxue’s waist, his lips gently pressing against hers.

Yan Ruoxue’s lips were very soft, and he was like kissing a marshmallow. Her moist lips made Qin Yu unwilling to leave for a long time.

“The two have really gone more and more overboard.” Uncle Yan’s face was ashen, and he tightly clenched his fists.

Fortunately, they did not do anything further. They let go of each other and looked up at the starry sky.

“Qin Yu, let’s go out to play,” Yan Ruoxue suddenly said.

“Go out to play?” Qin Yu was stunned. “Where do we go?”

“Leave the Yan family and simply go anywhere! Let’s go to eat something good. How about that?” Yan Ruoxue said excitedly.

As she said this, her eyes seemed to be glowing. The light in her eyes was even brighter than the stars in the sky. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu knew very well that Yan Ruoxue’s life was tremendously depressing. Too much hope had been put on her.

Back then, on Earth, she had been the young lady of the Yan family. Now that she had come to the Holy Region, the Yan family of Holy Region had unnecessarily burdened her with too many responsibilities. Freedom seemed to have nothing to do with her.

“Alright, but can we leave?” Qin Yu asked.

“We can’t, but we can sneak out and come back before they discover it!” Yan Ruoxue said softly.

“Mmm… Would there be any problems? If they discover it, will they do anything to you?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

“Then it will be more fun and exciting!” Yan Ruoxue hurriedly said.

“Alright!” Qin Yu stopped thinking about it and immediately agreed!

To leave Mount Donghuang, they would have to pass through the hurdle by Uncle Yan.

However, Uncle Yan seemed to be tireless. He had been hiding in the dark and observing the two of them. They thus could not find any opportunities.

“It seems not realistic to sneak out. Should I bring Uncle Yan along?” Qin Yu said jokingly.

Yan Ruoxue quickly shook her head. “No! No! No! Not to mention if he’ll agree. Even if he does, I don’t want to bring him along. I want a date with just the two of us.”

The more Yan Ruxue talked about it, the more excited she became. It was just an ordinary thing in the eyes of people. However, to Yan Ruoxue, it was like a big adventure!

“I have an idea!” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue’s eyes lit up. She said excitedly, “I’m going to the bloodline baptism tomorrow. I’ll bluff Uncle Yan that someone is looking for him and make him stay in Central Saint Hall!”

Undoubtedly, Central Saint Hall was the core of the Yan family, and it was the place where the Holy Lord rested.

“It’s settled! You wait for my good news tomorrow!” Yan Ruoxue said excitedly.

“Alright, it’s settled then!” Qin Yu nodded and said.

The following day, led by Uncle Yan, Yan Ruoxue left Mount Donghuang and rushed toward Central Saint Hall.

Qin Yu stayed at Mount Donghuang alone, waiting for good news from Yan Ruoxue.

At noon, an extremely bright light shot out in the middle of the Yan family.

The light shot up into the sky and dispersed all the clouds!

And then, a beam of light spread out from the Central Saint Hall. In just a while, it covered the entire Yan family!

This light was like a blessing from the heavens, showering everyone and bringing about an incomparably comfortable feeling.

Qin Yu opened his arms, and all the pores on his body opened up. All the internal qi entered his body, and even his divine sense was enhanced at this moment.

It was an extraordinary feeling that he was as if comprehending the Great Dao, and his heart and soul were exceptionally pure and calm.

However, the glow did not last long. In just a few minutes, it vanished without a trace.

It must be the bloodline baptism of the Yan family.

If the light emitted by the bloodline baptism had such a terrifying effect, the advancement brought by the baptism to Yan Ruoxue must be self-evident.

“Bloodline baptism, this is the first time I’ve heard of it,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Sitting cross-legged, he swallowed the holy medicine Yan Ruoxue had given him, slowly absorbing the medicinal effects.

After all, Yan Ruoxue was the saintess of the Yan family. The holy medicine she had obtained were all supreme treasures. The advancement that it gave Qin Yu was simply beyond imagination.

In just a day, Qin Yu felt the internal qi in his body had become as dense as the sea.

Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

The resources of the nine great aristocratic families were simply too terrifying. Under the irrigation of such resources, even a useless person could cultivate to an unimaginable level.

The sky gradually darkened, but Yan Roxue still did not return.

Qin Yu got up and looked into the distance. He activated his desolate divine eye and looked in the direction of the Central Saint Hall, hoping to see something.

Unfortunately, this place was extremely far away from Central Saint Hall, and even the desolate divine eye could not see anything.

...

The sky had gone completely dark. The stars were like bright lights decorating a black curtain, extremely dazzling.

Qin Yu was sitting cross-legged, absorbing the internal qi from the Yan family.

He tried to sense the Yan family’s dao technique. It was a blessed land, and the speed of cultivation was much faster than anywhere else.

After some time, Qin Yu felt a wisp of internal qi approaching him.

Qin Yu quickly got up and looked into the distance.

After a while, Yan Ruoxue returned to Mount Donghuang.

She quickly came to Qin Yu and said excitedly, “Quick! Let’s go. This is a rare opportunity.”

Without waiting for Qin Yu’s reply, Yan Ruoxue pulled Qin Yu’s hand and ran toward a specific direction on Mount Donghuang.

When they arrived at the teleportation formation of Mount Donghuang, Yan Ruoxue pulled Qin Yu along and stepped into it without a second thought.

In the next second, the two had already traveled through the void, left Mount Donghuang, and appeared in a busy area.

Although it was already nighttime, the place was incredibly bustling. With the people coming and going, it was full of hustle and bustle.

...

Not far away, people were peddling, drinking, and playing finger-guessing games. There were even people competing in poetry and chess.

Of course, other than these, there were people selling herbs. However, the medicinal herbs here were just ordinary and not worth a look.

“Phew! I’ve finally escaped.” Yan Ruoxue’s eyes were splendid as if glowing with tremendous excitement.
