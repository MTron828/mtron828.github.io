Chapter 251: Massacre! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Facing Gu Jinhong’s attack, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid at all!

He roared again and again, and the golden light on his body was as hot as the sun!

His fists were completely wrapped in internal qi, and the overwhelming internal qi made everyone’s expression change!

“Is... is this really the internal qi from Qin Yu’s body?” Duan Shi’s expression turned ashen!

Even Jing Lu’s expression was as dark.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that the so-called Jiang Bei region’s four great geniuses weren’t worth mentioning at all!

Qin Yu already had the ability to compete with a veteran Inner Strength Grandmaster!

“Rumble...”

Gu Jinhong’s palm shot forward, and the Tai Chi Seal immediately brought an aura of death with it as it pressed down on him from all directions!

Within a radius of dozens of meters, everyone was hit by the fight, and some of the weaker ones even died on the spot!

Han Yilong’s two followers hurriedly set up a protective formation. However, under this intense pressure, it suddenly exploded!

“Go to h*ll!” Gu Jinhong raised his head and roared!

Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with madness!

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!” Qin Yu raised his hand and used Qin Yu’s trump card!

Updates by

The golden fist enveloped the world and collided with the Tai Chi Seal!

At this moment, waves of murderous aura spread out in all directions like waves of water!

Countless trees were cut in half, and even the small hills in the distance exploded!

“How terrifying!”

This was what almost everyone thought inside!

“Break!” Qin Yu roared, and the golden light on his body intensified!

His muscles bulged in an instant, and his veins looked like small snakes!

Both sides used their trump cards!

On one side was Qin Yu, who had a chaotic body, and on the other side was the Inner Strength Grandmaster Mr. Gu, who had absorbed the inner strength of ten Inner Strength Grandmasters!

Boom.

Qin Yu’s expression was filled with madness as he punched out again!

Cracks appeared on the powerful Tai Chi Seal!

Crack.

In less than half a second, the Tai Chi Seal was completely shattered!

The inner strength turned into substance and shot out in all directions like daggers!

“Pfft!”

Countless people were pierced through by the inner strength!

Qin Yu was right in the center and allowed the inner strength to hit his body like raindrops!

The sounds of it hitting his body rang out continuously, and white spots appeared on his steel-like body!

“Boom!”

Finally, the Tai Chi Seal disappeared in a heavy rain of internal force!

The scene was completely silent. Their pupils dilated as they stared at Qin Yu.

The trump card of the Gu family was actually crushed by Qin Yu with one punch!

What kind of astonishingly powerful body did he have?!

“Impossible!” Gu Jinhong’s face was pale as he roared crazily!

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He quickly rushed over and punched Gu Jinhong’s lower abdomen.

“Bang!”

Gu Jinhong was sent flying by this punch! God knows how many trees were smashed!

After bumping around for dozens of meters, Gu Jinhong’s body finally stopped moving.

However, his body no longer had a human form. Many parts of his body were shattered and his sparkling white bones were revealed!

At this moment, Gu Jinhong panicked.

He didn’t even care about his dignity anymore, and with a plop, he knelt on the ground!

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin, don’t kill me. Please spare me...” Gu Jinhong frantically kowtowed on the ground!

The sounds of banging echoed incessantly, and the onlookers felt even more terrified.

The genius of the Jiang Bei region actually kowtowed to a young man and begged for mercy?

This was simply beyond their understanding!

“As long as you spare me, I’m willing to give you anything! I still have many herbs at home. My mentor will definitely remember this favor!” Gu Jinhong said anxiously.

However, a cruel smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

“Do you think I’ll spare you?” The murderous aura on Qin Yu’s body almost swallowed him whole!

Gu Jinhong roared crazily, “You can’t kill me! My mentor is Gu... Ah!!!”

“Bang!”

Before he could finish, Qin Yu’s hand smacked Gu Jinhong’s head.

Under the Heaven Swallowing Technique, Gu Jinhong turned into a dried corpse.

At this moment, Qin Yu could clearly feel that he was at the critical point of breaking through.

This confused Qin Yu somewhat. He had tried many methods before, but he was unable to break through.

But after today’s massacre, he had quickly reached the critical point.

Could it be... that his path was a path of killing?

The path of killing the righteous was completely inconsistent with Qin Yu’s morals.

Now was not the time to think about these things. Qin Yu turned around and prepared to deal with the remaining people.

However, at this moment, a figure floated out of Gu Jinhong’s body! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When they saw this figure, everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

This was Gu Jinhong’s master, Gu Taichu!

Gu Taichu glanced around and soon, his gaze fell on Gu Jinhong’s body.

When he saw Gu Jinhong’s corpse, Gu Taichu’s expression instantly darkened!

“Who killed my disciple!” Gu Taichu’s voice was like thunder!

Qin Yu was neither servile nor overbearing. He said indifferently, “I killed your disciple.”

Gu Taichu narrowed his eyes and said, “You have quite some guts! You even have the guts to kill my disciple!”

“He sent himself to his death. Why wouldn’t I have the guts?” Qin Yu sneered.

Gu Taichu said coldly, “Kid, you’d better come to the Gu family and kneel down to accept your death right now. Otherwise... you won’t be able to bear the consequences!”

“F * ck!” Qin Yu cursed. Then, he raised his hand and crushed the figure.

Qin Yu’s actions made everyone feel powerless and shocked.

They also understood that this Qin Yu didn’t respect the hierarchy at all!

Qin Yu didn’t take Gu Taichu’s matter to heart at all.

He took a step forward and arrived in front of everyone.

An intense pressure immediately came from all directions!

The ten Inner Strength Grandmasters instantly felt as if their shoulders were as heavy as a mountain!

Their inner strength was almost depleted. Facing the pressure from Qin Yu, they lost the ability to fight back.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me... we are willing to submit to you!” Someone shouted anxiously.

“Yes, as long as you spare us, we are willing to be your slaves for generations!”

Qin Yu sneered. “I’m sorry, I don’t need so many people by my side.”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s feet shook again, and the pressure instantly increased by a few times!

These ten plus people were crushed into pieces by Qin Yu!

With more than ten people killed in one breath, this deep mountain seemed to have become a living h*ll.

Everyone’s expressions were filled with fear, and they didn’t even have the guts to breathe loudly!

Qin Yu didn’t let go of the remaining Inner Strength Grandmaster either, and he absorbed all of them!

In the blink of an eye, everyone standing beside Han Yilong died.

Everyone was guessing whether Qin Yu would let go of Han Yilong.

Han Yilong’s followers were even more nervous. With Qin Yu’s current strength, they couldn’t stop him at all!

“Swoosh!”

Very quickly, Qin Yu arrived in front of Han Yilong.

The two followers immediately became even more nervous.

“Qin Yu, our young master is a member of the Han family after all. If you kill him, the consequences will be unimaginable, so...”

“Slap!”

Before the follower could finish his words, his head was smashed into pieces by Qin Yu.

“You talk too much,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The other follower saw that things weren’t going well and hurriedly moved aside. He cupped his hands and said, “Please help yourself, Mr. Qin. I’m just trying to make a living.”

“What the f * ck are you talking about?!” Han Yilong immediately became anxious!

However, Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Han Yilong, you keep talking about wealth, pedigree, and background. You think that everyone will work for you.”

“But when one’s life is at stake, what can the wealth you speak of do for you?”
