2537 The Land of the Fallen Saint

“This area is the closest to the monster race’s Path of Heaven. Various ferocious monster beasts live in there. These monster beasts are ferocious and bloodthirsty, and some can even use some monster race’s dark techniques. The bodies of monster beasts are tremendously terrifying, to begin with, and these monster beasts that have awakened the power of the Path of Heaven are even more terrifying.”

“Dark and evil internal qi of sorcery pervades the Misty Forest. These sorceries will distort reality, confuse people’s minds, and impose powerful spiritual temptations and illusion techniques on those who enter the forest. In this forest, the strongest mind can even erode. If one isn’t from the monster race, one at least requires a vast amount of the soul power to resist this power.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Elder Guai had been to this place before, so he had some understanding of this monster territory.

“Moreover, this place is very eerie. In the last battle, the human race Saint Mysterious Heavenly Revered Supreme, Zi Yang, got lost here. Even now, we haven’t found any traces of him. We have to discuss this matter.”

The peak master did not want Qin Yu to enter the forest.

“What? Even the Saint had died there? Could it be the human race’s Saint has never probed it before?”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. The death of a Saint was an incredibly terrifying matter. It could even affect the entire race’s cosmic luck of the Path of Heaven.

When a saint died, heaven and earth would grieve.

“This matter is so strange. I once heard Flower Granny mention that everything was normal when Saint Zi Yang entered the forest. However, his cosmic luck suddenly completely cut off. Even the joint efforts of the human race Saints failed to deduce any trace of him. He was as though disappearing from the Misty Forest. In other words, there are some areas in this Misty Forest that even the Saint can’t reach.”

The peak master smiled bitterly and continued.

“However, Saint Zi Yang has never appeared among the alien race after the incident. Therefore, he must have died. There is also speculation that he is trapped in a place even the Saint can’t reach. However, after that incident, the most formidable experts of the human race rarely step into it.”

“Anyway, these are all the records of this Misty Forest. It may not be as dangerous as stated in the records, and it’s up to you to judge yourself. However, the three of us think it’s best not to get involved easily.”

The peak master still felt that this area was not suitable for him to go to.

Late at night, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground and carefully considered this matter.

Cultivators had to move forward courageously, but they only had one life.

The danger must have been tremendous with the generous benefits promised by the three sects, and even the Saint got lost in it.

After a long while, his expression gradually became determined.

Now, he had already reached a bottleneck. After the three powers erupted, he had already touched the Cage of the Path of Heaven.

Right now, he needed to increase his strength in many ways. Just as Immortal Emperor Yao had said, perhaps he would have an opportunity to cross this level of Cage of the Path of Heaven.

If he were to head to the Saint’s World and keep searching for a safe place to cultivate, perhaps there would not be any danger, but his advancement would be tremendously limited.

He tried to contact Yan Ruoxue, but Yan Ruoxue seemed to be unable to receive any messages. He did not receive her reply for a long time.

Moreover, it was easily affected by vital energy. Once there was a massive vital energy fluctuation, it would be affected and fail to receive information in time.

…

“Although I’ve decided to proceed, I still have to minimize the danger.”

Qin Yu took the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes from out of his spatial ring and kicked the lid away.

Now that Immortal Emperor Yao had a favor to ask of him, he naturally had to be more imposing.

“Who is it?”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s face was full of rage but after seeing that it was Qin Yu, he gritted his teeth and suppressed his anger.

“Old man, you’ve tricked me quite a bit. The Misty Forest is so dangerous, but you’re silent about it. Even the Saint has died there, but you still try to harm me by instigating me to go there.”

Qin Yu laughed coldly.

“This small Misty Forest was but a place I walked my divine beasts back then. Where does the danger come from?”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s expression was a little awkward. He seemed embarrassed after being exposed.

As expected, there was something fishy going on. This d*mned old man definitely knew about the danger, but he was silent about it.

Qin Yu was furious. When he saw Immortal Emperor Yao’s awkward expression, he instantly could guess something. That shriveled face could not help but twitch.

He would smash his head into the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes if it was not a trick.

“Old man, you tricked me into going to this place of death for the Heavenly Soul Jade. However, I, Qin Yu, admit my mistake and not talk about this with you. Now, you must fulfill something and let me increase my strength slightly. Otherwise, if I can’t get out, you won’t be able to save yourself.”

Qin Yu quickly took advantage of the situation.

Although Immortal Emperor Yao only had a wisp of soul left, as an existence above the Saint, QinYu’s probability of success would definitely increase if he could give some guidance.

“What do you want then? There’s only a little time left before tomorrow. Even if I tell you some cultivation matters, you can’t learn anything in such a short time.”

Immortal Emperor Yao frowned.

“I don’t care. In that case, I’ll cancel the agreement and continue cultivating here tomorrow.”

“No, you can’t do that. Let me think about it.”

Immortal Emperor Yao revealed an anxious expression. The Heavenly Soul Jade was related to the duration of the wisp of his soul. He had to obtain it.

The man and the corpse stared at each other for four hours. Qin Yu thought that the old man was asleep.

Myriad Manifestations Gaze?

Qin Yu took a while to understand that Immortal Emperor Yao was referring to his desolate divine eye. He did not expect his desolate divine eye to have such a name.

“No, I’m a little tired now. I need a rest.”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s voice sounded a little tired. Qin Yu was unsure if he put up an act or if searching for the lost memory had consumed a large amount of his power of divine sense.

“Could it be that the desolate divine eye can continue to evolve?”

Back then, when he fought Si Shiyue, his desolate divine eye seemed to have broken through.

Moreover, after the last attack with Si Shiyue’s Elemental Black Hole, he saw the Cage of the Path of Heaven.

He was unsure if he had comprehended the Path of Heaven or if the desolate divine eye had sensed it.

He had obtained the desolate divine eye from Earth. As his strength increased, many of his previous cultivation methods and magical artifacts were gradually abandoned.

However, this desolate divine eye seemed to be able to advance along with his strength. Even now, it was still an extremely crucial item for him.

“Could it be that this thing has some special origin?”

Qin Yu thought to himself. He wanted to ask Immortal Emperor Yao about the origin of this pupil.
