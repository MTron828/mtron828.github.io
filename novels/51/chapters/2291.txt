2292 Returning to Purgatory

Qin Yu walked all the way to a secluded place before he finally stopped.

After a while, the wretched man quietly followed him, and he even changed his appearance.

“Big Brother, I have the Sumeru qi you mentioned, but not much.”

He said softly.

“Where is it? Let me see first.” Qin Yu shook his head.

His expression showed some struggle as if he was trying to determine if it was safe.

“With all my supreme treasures, do I really need this thing of yours? As long as you genuinely want to exchange something, just name it.”

Qin Yu frowned.

“Alright, I’ll show you.”

He gritted his teeth and took out a silver bottle. There were densely packed runes on the bottle.

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up. Even the bottle was of high-quality material. He hurriedly took over the silver bottle.

His divine sense entered the bottle, and he immediately felt like he was in the starry sky. His divine sense entered the endless space.

The ring of Sumeru in his hand emitted a joyous internal qi. It should be the Sumeru qi.

“This is Sumeru’s qi, but it’s too little. What do you want to exchange it for?”

Qin Yu asked with a smile. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I want that spear!”

The wretched cultivator demanded an exorbitant price.

“Brother, do you see any word on top of my head?” Qin Yu stared at him and said.

“What word?”

“Is there a word “stupid”?”

Qin Yu was annoyed.

This silver spear was a peak Saint Weapon. If the Sumeru qi was sufficient, Qin Yu could still consider exchanging it. However, it was just a bottle of Sumeru qi. It would be ridiculous to exchange it for this silver spear.

“Hehe, it’s a transaction. The main thing is I offer a price, and you bargain.”

The wretched cultivator scratched his head in embarrassment.

The wretched cultivator picked four to five Saint Weapons and a bottle of pills and wanted to take some more.

“Too many!”

Qin Yu reminded him. Although these were all obtained from the battle with the Azure Firmament Sect and the Yun family’s battles, and his heart would not ache if they were taken away, Qin Yu did not need to be a fool.

“I’ll take another one, Big Brother. These things are not of much use to you.”

The wretched cultivator said in a fawning manner. His hands trembled as he tried to take away another soft armor. This was the armor that Ming Yue had worn previously, and its quality was tremendously high among the Saint Weapons.

“You can take it, but you have to tell me the origin of this Sumeru qi.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“Alright! It was obtained 300 years ago in the third level of purgatory. Its owner was a powerful cultivator who had died. This guy was quite famous here. At that time, he was surrounded by several enemies because of this Sumeru qi.”

“It’s equivalent to not telling me anything. It can’t tell where this Sumeru qi is from.”

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and was about to take back the soft armor.

“Don’t, Big Brother. Let me analyze it for you. He previously teamed up with Wu Feng and a few other powerful cultivators. Moreover, they also recruited people in Solitary Cloud City and wanted to go to the ninth level of purgatory.”

To obtain the soft armor, the wretched cultivator almost squeezed all his lifelong analytical power into his mind.

“Not long after, his team returned with severe injuries. He died in the third level of purgatory, so the Sumeru qi was most likely obtained in the ninth level!”

“Alright, this analysis is quite reliable.”

Qin Yu threw the soft armor at him.

The wretched cultivator put away the things and hurriedly ran away, afraid that Qin Yu would go back on his word.

Qin Yu smiled. These things were useless to him now, and he also had no plans to establish a sect. It was a profit to him to exchange for the Sumeru qi.

After returning to his room in the Moon Listening Pavilion, Qin Yu arrived at the Sumeru ring with a thought.

He slowly opened the bottle cap, and the internal qi instantly rushed into the space.

A surge of spatial qi expanded rapidly in the Sumeru ring, and the Sumeru qi kept changing shape.

It formed its own small world, and from the looks of it, it was two skies and two grounds.

Suddenly, the Sumeru ring trembled violently.

The rules of the Sumeru qi slowly assimilated and became similar to the Sumeru qi. Then the two worlds began to fuse.

“What an illusionary scene! It’s the first time I witness such a fusion of heaven and earth.”

Yun Qingyun said in a daze.

“It’s so beautiful!”

Xiaoru and Little Fatty also applauded vigorously.

The moment the two worlds completely melted, the entire space shook violently and expanded by several thousand feet. Qin Yu instantly felt the Sumeru Space become much more stable.

“F*ck!”

Such a small bottle of Sumeru’s Qi had expanded to such a big space.

“This should be the original space of the Sumeru ring. After absorbing Sumeru qi, it began to recover slowly.”

Elder Guai nodded.

“Previously, I thought it was just an illusion. This place was gradually shrinking. It turns out that the Sumeru qi is gradually dissipating.”

“I really don’t know how big this world is if there is sufficient Sumeru qi. I wonder which mighty realm cultivator has created this space!”

Qin Yu exclaimed.

“Qin Yu, what are your plans now? If the Sumeru qi was really in the ninth level of purgatory, you must not enter. The ninth level of purgatory was rumored to be an ancient battlefield with countless murderous intents lurking. If one rashly enters, one would most likely die.”

Elder Guai said with a frown.

“I plan to go to the eighth level of purgatory first to see if I can comprehend the Way of Rules. Whether or not to break through to fourth grade is too important to me.”

Qin Yu said with a frown. Time was very tight for him now. He would have to find another way if he could not find a breakthrough in this galaxy.

“Qin Yu, can you let me be at the third level of purgatory? I want to fight demonic beasts on the third level to train myself.”

Yun Qingyun suddenly said.

In her recent cultivation, her strength had increased to second-grade True Saint, but her actual combat ability was tremendously poor.

“Alright, if there’s anything, just crush the jade slip, and I’ll know immediately.”

Qin Yu was a little worried.

“This is the Seal-Power Talisman. It stores my full power attack. Take this as well.”

“No need. I can’t hide behind all my life. Don’t worry. I’ll be fine! I also have quite a few treasures with me.”

Yun Qingyun said determinedly.

“Alright, you must be very careful.”

Seeing Yun Qingyun’s determined expression, he could only nod.

“Um, I’ll go to the third level with you.”

Wang Feng said bashfully, and Yun Qingyun blushed.

“Alright. You guys can team up and take care of each other.”

Qin Yu nodded and secretly handed the Seal-Power Talisman to Wang Feng.

…

In the Blue Horizon Continent, Hua Tian suddenly opened his eyes, revealing a trace of brilliance.

“Go to the eighth level of purgatory. I’ve deduced it using my Primordial Heavenly Divination. My luck is there.”

“Alright.”

Nangong Qi dared not ask much and quickly nodded.

“There is an opportunity in the crisis, and there is also some killing intent in this opportunity.”

Hua Tian patted his bald head impatiently.

“Master, if there’s danger, why don’t we stay away? After all, with the Primordial Heavenly Divination, Master’s strength will only be stronger.”

Nangong Qi asked with a frown.
