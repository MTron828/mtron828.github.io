Yan Guiyi frowned. “Is that necessary?”

Xie Qu snorted. “Didn’t Mr. Zhou ask us to distribute the resources to them? Then I’ll give them the resources!”

“As long as enough people die this time, they won’t dare to participate again even if we invite them next time!”

Yan Guiyi immediately understood and continued, “But... if only the people at the bottom level die, and none of the young masters of the aristocratic families die, will it be convincing?”

“What’s unconvincing about that?” Qu Xie sneered.

“The people at the bottom are weak to begin with. If the weak don’t die, as if the strong will die?”

Yan Guiyi suddenly understood. He couldn’t help but sigh inside. The older, the wiser.

Thus, Yan Guiyi turned around and walked out.

He stood in front of everyone again and said slowly, “This trip will be fraught with danger. The association will try its best to ensure everyone’s safety.”

“Of course, if anyone is afraid, you can withdraw now.”

The bottom-class people didn’t say a word. They had fought so hard for this opportunity, so how could they let it go?

Yan Guiyi seemed to have guessed it already, so he wasn’t surprised. Instead, he took out a total of 18 bracelets. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The bracelets were engraved with dense runes, which seemed to contain a special power.

“Each of you will get a copy of this bracelet. As long as you bring it, I will know everyone’s location,” Yan Guiyi said.

Then, Yan Guiyi asked someone to distribute the bracelets.

After taking the bracelet, Qin Yu couldn’t help but carefully examine it.

He injected a trace of spiritual power into the bracelet and found that it contained an extremely powerful force.

This force didn’t seem to be random. It was obviously created by a special secret technique.

“I’m afraid there’s something off about this bracelet.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

He raised his head to look at Yan Guiyi and shouted, “I don’t want to wear the bracelet. I also suggest that no one else wear it.”

Everyone immediately turned to look at Qin Yu while seeming to be somewhat puzzled.

Yan Guiyi said coldly, “Qin Yu, you’d better not cause trouble!”

Qin Yu ignored Yan Guiyi and shouted, “I suspect that this bracelet is used to control us. Once we wear this bracelet, we might be at their mercy.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the ordinary cultivators from the bottom level were all shocked.

In their hearts, Qin Yu was a role model. Therefore, Qin Yu’s words held an extremely high weight in their hearts.

Above them, Yan Guiyi’s expression couldn’t help but turn cold, and his fists were clenched.

He snorted coldly and said, “If you don’t wear this bracelet, you’re not qualified to participate in this experiential learning! This is the rule. It’s up to you!”

Qin Yu caressed the bracelet, and he couldn’t help but frown.

“Mr. Qin, it’s better to wear it. Aren’t those noblemen also wearing a bracelet?” Someone at the side advised.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Although he felt that this bracelet was fishy, this experiential learning was an important opportunity, and Qin Yu couldn’t miss it.

Therefore, he took a deep breath, and finally put the bracelet on his hand.

Yan Guiyi’s lips curled into an imperceptible sneer.

He put his hands behind his back and said slowly, “After you put the bracelet on, let’s get ready to set off.”

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association was the benchmark of the martial arts world, so their financial resources were naturally very impressive

They had even booked a plane for this trip.

The plane soared through the high sky and flew toward the training island.

Sitting on the plane, Qin Yu could clearly feel several murderous internal qis coming towards him from the dark.

Two of them were the most powerful.

He turned around and looked at the two murderous internal qis. He found that the two murderous internal qis came from Han Wei and He Teng!

He Teng was wearing a black robe. His face was covered by the black robe and only his piercing eyes were revealed.

On the other hand, Han Wei’s face was full of anger. His eyes were full of malice and vindictiveness.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and couldn’t help but snort coldly.

He slowly stood up and walked in He Teng’s direction. Then, he sat down beside him.

“I really didn’t expect that a beast like you would still be alive,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He Teng said in a somewhat hoarse voice, “Before I kill you... how could I die...”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but mock, “With your current creepy appearance?”

A trace of anger flashed across He Teng’s face!

“If it wasn’t for you... how could I have become like this?!” He Teng’s body was full of murderous intent!

“Qin Yu, don’t worry. If the Jingdu Martial Arts Association doesn’t kill you this time, I will personally kill you!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “I also want to see the guy hidden in your body.”

He Teng’s expression changed again. He snorted coldly and didn’t say anything else.

The plane flew in the air for more than four hours before finally landing on a huge island.

As soon as he got off the plane, Qin Yu felt a thread of dense spiritual energy.

This spiritual energy filled the entire island, and made the island lush and vibrant.

The entire island was extremely huge. Qin Yu tried to release his divine sense, but he realized that his huge divine sense was unable to cover the entire island.

“The resources controlled by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association are really bountiful,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just the resources they casually handed out had such strong spiritual energy. Who knew how much more they had?

“From now on, everyone must listen to my orders,” Yan Guiyi said coldly with his hands behind his back.

It was getting late. Yan Guiyi said coldly, “Tomorrow morning, we will officially take action. Now, everyone should take a break.”

Hearing this, everyone immediately dispersed.

Some gathered to chat, some found a place to sleep, and some, like Qin Yu, wanted to get ahead.

The eighteen people had formed three forces.

One was Jingdu’s upper-class circle represented by Yan Jinyao, one was full of ordinary martial artists without any powerful background, and the third was full of lone wolves, like Qin Yu.

Qin Yu stood on the seaside. He bent down and picked up a handful of seawater to sniff.

“This seawater actually contains spiritual energy.” Qin Yu was immediately surprised.

Humans weren’t able to explore the underwater world yet. No one knew what secrets were hidden under the sea.

“The spiritual energy on land has long been exhausted. Is there a possibility that all the spiritual energy has been deposited under the sea?” A bold idea popped up in Qin Yu’s mind!

He put down the seawater in his hand and planned to dive into the sea to investigate.

“Boom!”

At this moment, a loud sound suddenly came from not far away!

A bright ray of light directly illuminated a large area of the sky!

This sound instantly attracted everyone’s attention. Qin Yu also looked over.

Seeing the scene in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown and his expression turned cold.
