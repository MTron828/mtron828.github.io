Han Wei’s expression couldn’t help but change.

He had a bad feeling inside.

“I got it.” Han Wei waved his hand.

However, the butler still didn’t go out. He stood there with a sheepish smile.

Han Wei frowned and said, “I said I got it. Don’t you understand?”

The butler said awkwardly, “the Master... wants you to go over immediately.”

“I got it!” Han Wei grabbed the item on the table and threw it over!

After all, Han Wei was at the pinnacle of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm. Even though he threw it casually, it contained an extremely powerful force!

The butler’s expression changed drastically. With his ability, he couldn’t avoid it even if he wanted to!

At this moment, a ray of light lit up and shattered the display.

“What, I don’t have authority over you anymore?” Then, a man in his forties appeared at the door.

Seeing this man, Han Wei hurriedly stood up and said nervously, “Dad...”

This man was Han Wei’s father, Han Meng, one of the true power holders of the Han family.

Han Meng slowly walked towards Han Wei. He waved his hand and said to the butler, “You can go out first.”

“Yes, Master.” The butler bowed and quickly walked out.

The door was closed. In the huge room, there were only Han Meng and Han Wei.

Although Han Wei was arrogant and domineering to the outside world, in front of Han Meng, he was like a shivering cat.

“Dad...” Han Wei opened his mouth and was about to speak when Han Meng slapped him!

This slap sent Han Wei flying!

“Trash! You’ve disgraced the Han family!” Han Meng said coldly.

He pointed at the content on the phone screen and said, “What is this? You’ve disgraced the Han family!”

Han Wei got up from the ground. He covered his face and explained in a low voice, “Dad, I will take care of it as soon as possible...”

“Take care of it? Take care of it my *ss!” Han Meng said angrily. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“The Han family is being led by the nose by a lowlife. Is your brain filled with dog sh*t?”

Han Wei said with some grievance, “Dad, I didn’t expect him to be so shameless. I... I will go kill him now!”

“Kill him my *ss! Why did you do it earlier?!” Han Meng kicked Han Wei in the stomach again.

“As a son of the Han family, you actually went to bet with some lowlife in Jiangcheng. Don’t you think it’s embarrassing?”

Han Wei, not daring to say anything, got up from the ground again.

They fell into a short silence.

At this time, Han Meng looked at Han Wei and said coldly, “Qin Yu has a good relationship with Yan Ruoxue, right?”

“Yes! And not long ago, he went to the Yan family! I heard that Old Mister Yan thinks highly of him...” Han Meng hurriedly said.

When Han Meng heard this, he slapped Han Wei’s face again.

“Why didn’t you get rid of him earlier? You actually kept such a potential threat until now!” Han Meng said coldly.

“Now that everyone has their eyes on the Han family, it’s too late to make a move, you trash!”

Han Meng vented his anger wantonly.

However, Han Wei didn’t dare to talk back and could only silently endure it.

“Dad, now... What should I do now...” after hesitating over and over again, Han Wei still asked in a low voice.

Han Meng said in a deep voice, “Just wait. Wait for Old Mister Yan to pass away. It’s said that he has been in a very bad condition recently and has already been hospitalized.”

“Really?” Han Wei immediately said excitedly.

Han Meng nodded and said, “Remember, the marital alliance between the Han family and the Yan family can only succeed.”

“As for Qin Yu, you have to get rid of him.”

Han Wei hurriedly nodded and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll send people right now...”

“Send people my *ss!” Before Han Wei could finish speaking, Han Meng threw the cigarette butt at Han Wei’s face.

“If you send your men to kill him now, won’t the Han family be humiliated?”

Han Wei’s expression was a little ugly. He said in a low voice, “Father, I understand what you mean. Don’t worry, Qin Yu is only an Inner Strength Past Master. Killing him would be effortless for me...”

Han Meng’s expression eased up slightly.

“During this period of time, you have to do your best in closed-door cultivation,” Han Meng said coldly.

“Old Mister Yan has a few loyal subordinates by his side. I hope you can personally get rid of them when the time comes.”

“Yes, father,” Han Wei replied in a low voice.

...

While the outside world was in an uproar, Qin Yu acted as if nothing had happened.

He borrowed the dense spiritual energy of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to cultivate all day long.

It had to be said that under such circumstances, the speed of his cultivation was indeed much faster.

In just three days, Qin Yu had successfully stepped into the second level of the Monastic Stage.

“With the backing of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the gap in resources between me and the Han family wouldn’t be so big,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, the Fifth Elder walked in from outside.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, are you ready?”

Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and said, “Fifth Elder, I have long been ready.”

Fifth Elder nodded and said in a deep voice, “I have bad news for you. There is one more person participating in this competition.”

“There is one more person?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

Fifth Elder nodded and said, “As long as the position of Elder is vacant, there will definitely be someone competing. It isn’t limited to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. The upper class will also use this opportunity to step into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

At this point, the Fifth Elder paused for a moment and continued, “And this person comes from the Han family.”

“The Han Family?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

He said in a deep voice, “The Pavilion Master... could it be that she wants me to lose to him on purpose?”

After all, Qin Yu had injured a member of the Han family, and the Pavilion Master had promised to give the Han family an explanation.

Giving the Han family a position of Elder might be the best method.

However, the Fifth Elder shook his head and said, “No, the Pavilion Master wants you to win.”

This immediately shocked Qin Yu.

He never expected that the Pavilion Master’s temper was actually so similar to his!

“Qin Yu, so your burden is very heavy.” The Fifth Elder exhorted.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Fifth Elder, don’t worry. I definitely won’t let the Pavilion Master down.”

“Okay, then get ready. See you in the hall at two o’clock in the afternoon.” Fifth Elder stood up and then turned to leave.

“The Han family...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but secretly laugh inside.

The Han family probably thought that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would give in to the Han family, right?

“Unfortunately, the Han family miscalculated.” Qin Yu sneered.

...

That afternoon, Qin Yu arrived at the hall at the agreed time.

Many pharmacists had been waiting here long ago, and Taozi and Yao Qing were no exception.

“Qin Yu, you can’t lose,” Taozi said.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t lose.”

As soon as he said that, a young man walked in from outside the door.

The young man was wearing a robe and looked a bit strange.

His face, however, shocked Qin Yu greatly.

“It’s actually you? !” Looking at the young man’s face, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.
