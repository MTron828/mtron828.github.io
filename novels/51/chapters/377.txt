Chapter 378: All the Strength of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu immediately felt a little awkward. He said tentatively, “What I need right now is the Vitality Enhancing Pill. This pill is enough.”

“Haha, it’s just a mere Vitality Enhancing Pill. It’s not worth mentioning.”

“I thought it was some top-grade pill. Elder Qin, you’re underestimating us too much.”

“Elder Qin, you can rest assured and wait. The Pavilion Master said that we will go to the herb warehouse to collect the herbs ourselves.”

“That’s right. The Pavilion Master is really using the entire Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s strength to help you.”

Qin Yu’s gratitude towards the Pavilion Master was immense.

He muttered in a low voice, “Lord Pavilion Master, thank you for your help...”

The Elders left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. As the most elite alchemists in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, almost every one of them possessed spiritual fire.

A mere Vitality Enhancing Pill was indeed not worth mentioning.

After they left, Taozi whispered, “Elder Qin, perhaps I can help too.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and smiled. “Alright, thank you, Taozi.”

Taozi shook her head and didn’t say anything. She turned around and walked out.

Currently, Qin Yu not only carried the expectations of Yan Ruoxue and Old Mister Yan, but also the entire Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Therefore, he couldn’t lose.

Qin Yu found a place to sit down, swallowed the remaining Vitality Enhancing Pills, and began his closed-door cultivation.

On the other side, many Elders were personally refining the Vitality Enhancing Pills for Qin Yu in full swing

.

Such a grand scene was unprecedented.

In the pavilion’s main building, Old Mister Yan and the Pavilion Master were slowly sipping tea.

“The entire Divine Alchemist Pavilion is acting as Qin Yu’s backing. This way, the disparity in resources will be completely eliminated,” Old Mister Yan sighed.

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “How can the aristocratic families compare to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

Old Mister Yan laughed. “Haha, That’s true. No aristocratic family in the world can dispatch so many top-notch alchemists to refine pills.”

“Pavilion Master, I, Old Mister Yan, owe you a favor.” Old Mister Yan cupped his hands and said.

The Pavilion Master shook her head and said indifferently, “I’m doing this for Qin Yu, not for your family.”

Old Mister Yan was slightly embarrassed. He coughed and nodded. “Then I’ll thank you on behalf of Qin Yu.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

...

In the following time, Qin Yu began to enter a state of closed-door cultivation.

Almost every day, dozens of Vitality Enhancing Pills would be sent by the Elders. Qin Yu didn’t need to worry about the supply of pills at all.

Pill after pill was stuffed into his mouth. Qin Yu’s entire body was filled with spiritual energy.

In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.

Qin Yu’s cultivation level had gone up to the fifth level from the second level of the Monastic Stage!

The spiritual energy in his body had doubled!

His entire body flickered with light. At a glance, one could even see the sparkling white bones in his body!

However, this was far from enough!

Qin Yu devoured the pills ravenously and raised his cultivation level like crazy!

This scene had practically become a unique scenery of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Almost every day, there would be alchemists coming to watch.

No one knew where the end point of this seclusion was, and no one knew what level Qin Yu would reach after this seclusion.

...

In the outside world, Qiao Wu and the others didn’t leave Qinghe town.

They stayed near the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to wait for Qin Yu to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“How much longer do we have to stay here?” Qiao Wu couldn’t help but sigh.

“What’s the rush? If he can afford to waste his time, we can certainly afford to waste our time.” Someone beside him snorted coldly.

“That’s right. In any case, the environment here is so excellent. We can use this opportunity to cultivate.”

Even though that was the case, Qiao Wu still felt a trace of unease inside.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion refused all orders from the outside world.

Many aristocratic families came to ask for pills, but they were all refused entry.

The truth would come to light sooner or later. This matter naturally spread very quickly.

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s abnormal actions attracted countless speculations. It even became a hot topic on the Martial Arts Forum.

Jingdu, Yan family’s home.

Yan Sihai sat in the huge living room. Han Meng of the Han family was opposite him.

“It’s been almost twenty days, but there’s still no movement from Qin Yu,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Han Meng smiled and said, “President Yan, there’s no need to be anxious. I don’t believe that he can stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion for a lifetime.”

Yan Sihai glanced at Han Meng and said with a frown, “I’ve recently heard some very bad news.”

“Oh really?” Han Meng was slightly shocked.

Yan Sihai said coldly, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion has recently canceled all the pill refining orders. No matter how big the aristocratic families are, they are unable to obtain a pill from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

Han Meng frowned and said, “That shouldn’t be. The Divine Alchemist Pavilion has never encountered such a situation.”

Yan Sihai blew out a smoke ring and slowly said, “I suspect that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has put all their energy into Qin Yu.”

When he heard this, Han Meng’s expression changed slightly.

“If that’s the case, then it’s really troublesome,” Han Meng muttered softly.

At this moment, Han Wei at the side volunteered, “Mr. Yan, dad, don’t worry. As long as he dares to appear in Jingdu, I will definitely kill Qin Yu with my own hands!”

Yan Sihai glanced at Han Wei and nodded slightly, “That’s the only way. Han Wei, don’t underestimate the enemy. Qin Yu isn’t as simple as he seems.”

Han Wei hurriedly nodded and said, “Mr. Yan, don’t worry. I’ll go into seclusion right away!”

“Someone as insignificant as Qin Yu isn’t worth worrying about. It’s just that I don’t feel at ease if I don’t kill him,” Yan Sihai said with a cold snort.

This wasn’t only Yan Sihai’s idea, but also Han Meng’s.

They didn’t believe that half a year’s time could change anything.

...

During this period of time, Yan Ruoxue was under house arrest in the Yan family manor.

Although there were people serving her every day, and her means of communication with the outside world were all cut off.

Yan Ruoxue, who was bored to death, could only use painting and gardening to comfort herself.

On this day, Yan Ruoxue was sitting under a big tree. In front of her, there was a drawing board.

The person in the drawing was none other than Qin Yu.

At this moment, Yan Sihai’s car slowly drove in.

After he parked the car, he walked towards Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue, haven’t you thought it through yet?” Yan Sihai walked behind Yan Ruoxue and asked.

Yan Ruoxue smiled as she drew. “Thought what through? Uncle, don’t waste your time.”

“I can’t figure out what attracted you to Qin Yu,” Yan Sihai said with a cold expression.

Yan Ruoxue stared at the painting in front of her and said with a smile, “At least Qin Yu lived a purer life, unlike you, who killed your biological father for money and status.”

These words immediately infuriated Yan Sihai!

He grabbed the painting in front of him and tore it into pieces!

“Yan Ruoxue, let me tell you, your grandfather is dead! I’m the one in charge of the Yan family now!” Yan Sihai said angrily.

“Whether you agree or not, you have to marry Han Wei! You don’t have the right to choose!”

“Let me tell you, I’ve already released the date of your wedding. Do you think he will stop the wedding?”

“You like him, right? Fine, then I’ll kill him with my own hands in front of you!”
