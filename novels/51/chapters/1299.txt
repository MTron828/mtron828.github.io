Chapter 1300: Chapter 1,300, Ling Yun’s strange phenomenon 

The surrounding crowd was shocked. Their eyes shone with an unbelievable radiance!

One had to know that Ling Yun’s heaven flipping seal was a heaven-grade spell. It was well-known throughout the entire South Province! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The caster of the spell was Ling Yun, who was known as the number one genius of the South Province!

However, Ling Yun, who was blessed with all sorts of glory, was repelled by Qin Yu and spat out blood. How could this not be shocking!

Qin Yu looked at Ling Yun coldly and didn’t say a word.

He knew that Ling Yun’s injuries had relapsed. Otherwise, this punch wouldn’t have been able to make him spit out blood.

That punch from the heavenly demon ape had already injured his internal Qi. His strength was definitely not at its peak, and even his breathing was somewhat chaotic.

In such a state, how could he be a match for Qin Yu!

However, Qin Yu didn’t have the slightest bit of compassion at this moment.

Even if Ling Yun wasn’t at his peak, Qin Yu would definitely kill him!

“Cough cough...”

Ling Yun covered his mouth and coughed twice. There were two more pools of blood.

“Young Master!”That Almighty quickly walked in front of Ling Yun as if he wanted to stop Ling Yun.

However, Ling Yun pushed him away. He glared at Qin Yu and said, “Kid, you’re courting death...”

Boom

Qin Yu didn’t waste any words. He clenched his fist and threw it at Ling Yun.

Ling Yun hurriedly activated his protective magic artifact. This protective magic artifact seemed to have its own consciousness and automatically protected its owner when he was threatened.

However, the protective magic artifact, which had already taken a punch from the Heavenly Devil Ape, was already on the verge of shattering.

Under Qin Yu’s explosive attack, the radiance was instantly destroyed! Meanwhile, the protective magic artifact on Ling Yun’s body shattered with a “Kacha”sound!

“Boom!”

Before Ling Yun could react, Qin Yu took a step forward and threw another punch!

Ling Yun was extremely furious. The disc-like phenomenon quickly appeared behind him!

A heavy feeling assaulted his face. Under this abnormal phenomenon, Qin Yu was actually pressed onto the ground!

“You’re courting death!”Ling Yun roared angrily. The strange phenomenon behind him was even shimmering!

In the next second, the strange phenomenon that was like a disc came crashing down on Qin Yu with a terrifying might.

Countless precious radiances intersected, forming an extremely holy outline of the strange phenomenon.

However, no one dared to doubt the destructive power of this strange phenomenon. Even space seemed to have collapsed under the pressure!

Qin Yu felt this extremely terrifying power. He did not dare to be the slightest bit negligent. He immediately unleashed the venerable Fifth Mountain and chose to meet it head-on!

“Boom!”

The intense collision between the phenomenon and the Dharma artifact unfolded at this moment!

However, in a short moment, the venerable fifth mountain was pushed back by the pressure. It seemed that it could not hold on any longer!

“Boom!”

The venerable fifth mountain was pressed to the ground, smashing the ground into pieces.

Following that, the terrifying phenomenon smashed into Qin Yu’s body!

“PFFT!”

However, at this moment, Ling Yun, who had used the phenomenon, spat out a mouthful of blood!

This phenomenon seemed to have consumed a lot of his energy. His internal injuries had relapsed, and the radiance of the phenomenon had dimmed by a few degrees! His strength had also decreased by a lot.

“Boom!”

The phenomenon smashed onto Qin Yu’s shoulders. Even though it had dimmed a little, it was still extremely terrifying.

The moment it came into contact with Qin Yu’s shoulder blade, a crisp cracking sound was heard!

This couldn’t help but cause Qin Yu to turn pale with fright!

Qin Yu’s physical body was already considered invincible. Now, he had even used the fifth level of the battle word technique.

However, even so, the phenomenon still crushed Qin Yu’s bones!

What kind of power was this!

The abnormal phenomenon slowly disappeared and reappeared behind Ling Yun’s back.

Ling Yun wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and gritted his teeth in anger. “Damn it... I didn’t kill him...”

He knew the state of his body in his heart. He also knew how much damage the abnormal phenomenon would cause in such a state.

He had wanted to kill him in one strike, but he didn’t expect his old illness to recur at this time!

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted, and he was extremely shocked.

This Ling Yun’s strength was far beyond his imagination!

As expected of a famous disciple of the Holy Region, Qin Yu thought to himself in a low voice.

This kid was only seventeen years old, but he already had such formidable combat strength. His future was truly limitless!

“Phew.”Qin Yu took a deep breath. He shook his arm, feeling the pain from his shoulder blade.

Without spiritual energy, it would be difficult for me to deal with that anomaly, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Even though his fists contained godly power, Qin Yu was still unable to deal with Ling Yun’s trump card.

Ling Yun gritted his teeth as he endured the pain in his body. He planned to activate the anomaly again.

“This time... I will definitely kill you!”Ling Yun roared angrily. The radiance of the anomaly appeared once again!

The surrounding crowd couldn’t help but feel a sense of shock. They had long heard of the name of the phenomenon. Rumor has it that Ling Yun had relied on this technique to kill countless powerhouses in the intermediate stage!

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that none of the opponents who had encountered this technique had survived until now.

“Interesting. Let’s see who dies today.”

“Let’s make a bet. I’ll bet on the death of that Qin Yu.”

“Alright, then I’ll bet on Ling Yun’s death.”

The two young men on the tall building were leisurely making a bet.

However, the rest of the people had nervous expressions on their faces.

They all used their trump cards to protect themselves, afraid that they would be affected.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent in the face of the phenomenon that Ling Yun had forcefully activated.

He extended his palm and a rusty iron rod appeared in his hand.

This rod was the one he had snatched from Gu Xinghe!
