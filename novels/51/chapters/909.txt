Chapter 910: Chapter 910 had been discovered? ! 

The conflict between the two parties began to escalate within a few days.

From this day onwards, the current martial artists and the disciples who had walked out of the secret realm had been in constant conflict.

Not only that, the seven martial saints had also started to become more rampant.

They had occupied almost all the resources and suppressed the current martial artists many times.

Zhuang Teng, who was the first to bear the brunt of the attack, was severely injured by the genius disciples who walked out of the mystic realm.

The Zhuang family.

Zhuang Teng lay on the bed, looking Haggard.

He spat out a mouthful of blood from time to time, and his face was extremely pale.

Chu Heng and the others who were guarding in front of him all had extremely ugly expressions.

“Damn it!”Kong Yun, who had the most fiery temper, could not help but curse angrily.

He stood up with a ‘bang’and said coldly, “We must not let them be so arrogant! When have we ever suffered such humiliation!”

After saying that, Kong Yun stood up and was about to leave.

“Where are you going?”Chu Hedao pulled Kong Yun back.

Kong Yun said coldly, “I’m going to teach them a lesson!”

“Forget it. They have more people and are more powerful. Don’t provoke this bad luck,”someone at the side advised.

Kong yun sneered, “If I let them ride on my head and shit, I won’t Be Kong Yun Anymore!”

After saying this, Kong Yun turned around and left.

Within the Jingdu Martial Academy, a great battle quickly erupted!

The great battle between Kong Yun and the disciples in the secret realm spread throughout more than half of Jingdu!

This great battle lasted for a full three hours. Kong Yun’s body was covered in blood, and his blood splattered across the sky. In the end, he was even carried back by someone!

Ever since then, the disciples of the aristocratic families became even more desperate.

“Even Kong Yun lost to them. I don’t know who else can stand out.”

“I don’t know if Yan Jinyao and Qin Yu can win against them.”

“Forget about the two of them. With Yan Jinyao’s temper, he wouldn’t meddle in other people’s business. Besides, no one would bully them.”

“As for Qin Yu? He can’t even protect himself now.”

“...”

The martial arts world of the current era had been greatly impacted, and the conflicts between the two sides were still accumulating.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu and Jiang he were rushing to the mystic realm.

The two of them moved separately, and Qin Yu was extremely careful along the way.

He restrained his internal Qi and tightened his hat, afraid that he would be discovered.

Even though Qin Yu had used the shrinking earth technique, it still took him eight hours to reach the secret realm.

On the other side, Qin Yu and Jiang he had just left when Gu Xinghe and Zhai Xing arrived.

They checked around, but did not find the two of them.

Gu Xinghe stood in Jiang he’s courtyard for a long time. After a moment, he sniffed and said coldly, “We haven’t gone far yet. We can still catch their internal Qi.”

After saying that, Gu Xinghe looked at Zhai Xing and the others and said coldly, “Chase after them!”

Zhai Xing did not dare to say anything. He quickly followed Qin Yu and Jiang he’s internal Qi and sped away.

...

In front of the secret realm.

Jiang he had arrived at this place early in the morning.

Looking at this scene, which was like a purgatory on Earth, a trace of sadness flashed across Jiang he’s face.

Although he had heard about this long ago, when he saw it with his own eyes, he was still greatly shocked.

“All of this was done by the Wan Gu Qiong.”Qin Yu glanced around, a trace of pain flashed across his face.

“Sooner or later, one day, I will personally destroy the Wan family’s Secret Realm!”

Jiang he patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “When you have enough strength, everything will be different.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He walked to the front of the secret realm and slowly opened it with the secret key.

“Senior Jiang he, please.”Qin Yu bowed and said.

Jiang he grunted and followed Qin Yu into the secret realm.

Li Yu had not left the secret realm.

Looking at the two people who suddenly came, Li Yu quickly walked over.

“Jiang he?”Looking at Jiang he who was beside Qin Yu, Li Yu hurriedly bowed and greeted him.

“Why Are You Back?”Then, Li Yu looked at Qin Yu with some surprise.

Qin Yu waved his hand and did not explain.

He looked at Jiang he and said, “Senior Jiang he, this is the secret realm that I Found.”

Jiang he took a deep breath and felt the Qi/spiritual energy from the secret realm.

“Such dense qi/spiritual energy, I have never seen it in the world.”Jiang he could not help but mutter in a low voice.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “Senior Jiang He, why don’t you cultivate here? With your talent, it shouldn’t be difficult for you to enter the Martial Saint Realm.”

“That’s right. In this current era, the people who have the most hope to enter the martial saint realm should be senior Jiang he and Officer Ye.”Li Yu also said.

Jiang he shook his head in response to this.

He said in a low voice, “Ye Qing’s talent is above mine, but his ambition is not here.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He could also feel it.

Compared to ye Qing, Jiang he seemed to have a purer understanding of martial arts.

Then, the two of them did not waste any more time.

Jiang he also began to teach Qin Yu the last secret of the nine secrets. It was also the most important secret to Qin Yu right now.

...

Gu Xinghe, Zhai Xing, and the others followed Qin Yu and Jiang he’s internal Qi and rushed all the way to the Jade Moon Villa.

As an advanced stage martial saint, Zhai Xing’s spiritual sense was extremely sharp.

Even though Qin Yu and Jiang he had restrained their internal Qi, they still could not escape his sharp spiritual sense.

The few of them followed behind Zhai Xing and walked all the way to the vicinity of the secret realm.

Standing near this secret realm, Zhai Xing could not help but sniff.

“Where are they?”Gu Xinghe asked coldly.

Zhai Xing glanced at Gu Xinghe and frowned. “That’s strange. Their internal Qi has disappeared here.”

“Disappeared?”Gu Xinghe could not help but snort.

“Internal Qi can disappear into thin air?”

Gu Xinghe looked at Zhai Xing with suspicion.

Zhai Xing said in a low voice, “Their internal Qi has indeed disappeared here. I don’t know why.”

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and said, “Uncle Zhai Xing, my father trusts you very much, and I have always treated you as my own uncle.”

“Then, you and I both know what kind of impact Jiang he and Qin Yu will bring to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. You should also know which side is more important.”

Zhai Xing knew what Gu Xinghe meant. He took a deep breath, bowed, and said, “Young master Gu, what I said is true.”

Gu Xinghe stared at Zhai Xing as if he wanted to see through him.

“Do you think... They have escaped into the secret realm?”At this moment, a martial saint beside Zhai Xing asked.

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe’s pupils suddenly constricted!

Secret Realm!

Yes, only by stepping into the secret realm would their internal Qi disappear for no reason! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Thinking of this, Gu Xinghe hurriedly said, “Quick, call du Xuanyu over and have a good look!”
