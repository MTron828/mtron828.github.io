2493 The Source of Poison

The terrifying force sent him and Saintess Gu flying a thousand meters away.

The surrounding ground began to tremble wherever the roar reached. The visible sound waves enveloped Qin Yu and Saintess Gu.

The ground began to shake violently, and the air filled with a dreadful roaring sound. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Azure Dragon, the leader of the four divine beasts, indeed lived up to its reputation.

Singularity Space!

Qin Yu’s divine thought moved slightly, and nearly ten thousand spaces suddenly distorted and extended, isolating the sound wave from the outside.

Sharp soundwave blades condensed from the sword, seemingly invisible yet carrying dreadful power.

As they cut through the air, they emitted piercing sonic booms.

Upon contact with the enemy, it immediately resulted in a fierce explosion.

With the sound of space cracking, it finally blocked this attack.

Qin Yu’s expression was hideous at this moment. He finally understood why Saintess Gu apologized.

At this moment, Gu Ning had disappeared. It was her clone that was beside them.

“What does Gu Ning have in mind?”

Qin Yu roared angrily. Was she betraying Saintess Gu and him just like that?

It was not difficult to guess that this place was just a means to attract the demon race.

What Gu Ning’s true form was doing at this moment remained unknown.

Azure Dragon attacked twice, and Qin Yu felt countless powerful divine senses completely locking onto him.

Almost all the powerful demon kings who attacked the Gu family previously were here. It seemed to be the Crown of the Demon King’s day to refine and sacrifice the blood essence.

Otherwise, such powerful demon kings would not have appeared. Under the pressure of these divine senses, Qin Yu and Saintess Gu’s expressions were somewhat unnatural.

“Let’s attack together, kill the two, and imprison their souls. Another human seems to be entering the Azure Rock Forest from another direction.”

Just as it finished speaking, the place where Qin Yu and Saintess Gu were was completely engulfed in a terrifying sea of fire.

“Hmm?”

Azure Dragon’s huge eyes revealed a hint of surprise.

Amid that boundless destructive power, they suddenly realized their bodies were being sucked in.

In the vast kingdom of the soul, different scenes appeared in the divine senses of these demon kings.

Some sights they saw included the vast starry sky, the integrated mountains and rivers, and the misty lakes.

A tremendously powerful force attracted their souls instantly. In an instant, the power of the technique was reduced by 30%.

After burning the soul power absorbed by Evil Eye, two balls of ghostly flames appeared in Qin Yu’s pupils.

He looked at the sea of destruction in the distance. The second move, the sea of Soul Ferry, had temporarily strengthened his soul to an unbelievable extent.

At this moment, the power of the Yellow Springs surged in his hand, and a destructive power gathered in Evil Eye.

Following that, a sword suddenly shot out from his hand, and the sword energy pierced through the power of the Yellow Springs.

The sky dyed with crimson, purple-black, or dark gold colors and filled with a mysterious internal qi.

The sword energy seemed to have affected the power of heaven and earth. At this moment, the sky formed a scene of intertwined thunder and lightning with howling winds.

Numerous spatial cracks shot out, with Qin Yu as the center. These cracks were passages to other worlds or mysterious domains, releasing unknown powers and creatures.

Even Azure Dragon and the others could not sense where this powerful internal qi led to.

“Boom!”

God-slaying Dusk swept out, killing two demon kings, a thunderbird, and a green phoenix on the spot.

The four divine beasts’ bodies shook violently, and they suffered considerable injuries.

The other ten demon kings also suffered varying degrees of injuries, depending on the distance.

The four looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

Was this guy that terrifying?

Especially Vermillion Bird, it could not conceal its shock deep down.

Back then, for the sake of a drop of her blood, Qin Yu had used all his strength under the premise of the suppression of the Path of Heaven and barely injured her.

And now, he could injure them under the combined attack of the four divine beasts?

The power of the third move, the God-slaying Dusk, had been very close to Xiao Sheng’s Fist of Heaven and Earth. It was a sword strike that could affect the changes in the world.

This attack was also the most formidable attack that Qin Yu could unleash.

This time, all that Evil Eye had absorbed were the souls of the supreme experts of the Gu family that the demon race had ambushed.

After burning the soul power, Qin Yu’s soul clone drew upon the fourth-level power of the Path of Heaven of destruction. This time, the God-slaying Dusk had been close to the sword strike unleashed in the ghost realm.

However, that sword strike in the ghost realm was due to the distance of the ghost realm which was tremendously close to the sea of destruction.

“Pfft!”

A large amount of blood gushed out of Qin Yu’s body. His muscles were torn apart, and his bones were broken.

He fell to the ground weakly, unable to support his body, and every movement was accompanied by intense pain.

The joint attack of the four divine beasts had also caused severe injury to him.

“You’re courting death!”

At this moment, Azure Dragon let out another furious roar.

It suddenly opened its mouth, and a ball of scorching dragon breath shot out.

In an instant, intense flames and smoke filled the entire space.

As the dragon’s breath burned, Saintess Gu’s figure appeared.

“Saintess Gu!”

Qin Yu roared.

He had a good relationship with Saintess Gu, and she was one of the few people in the nine great aristocratic families he felt he could befriend.

As the dragon breath burned, a ripple appeared.

A fair hand suddenly stretched out and pointed at Azure Dragon’s body.

That finger could not move in further on Azure Dragon’s scales.

The arm turned into charcoal, and Saintess Gu’s body fell to the ground, stirring up a massive cloud of dust.

Qin Yu’s body appeared beside Saintess Gu, who was on the verge of death.

She was directly hit by Azure Dragon’s dragon breath, resulting in nearly 70% to 80% of her body being burned.

“I’m sorry, Qin Yu…”

“Don’t say it anymore.”

Qin Yu’s hand moved slightly, and a thick medicinal qi gushed out of the Sumeru ring and injected Saintess Gu’s body.

Suddenly, Azure Dragon, hovering in the air, let out a furious roar.

Qin Yu was suddenly stunned.

A black shade slowly expanded.

When the black shade expanded, its hardest scales fell off piece by piece.

When the scales fell onto the ground, they smashed into wood dust like rotten wood, and its chest lit up with a bright light.

It wanted to heal the terrifying wound, but Azure Dragon’s power, which could regenerate bones and heal injuries, seemed unable to resist the spread of the black power.

“Hiss!”

Azure Dragon tore off a large chunk of flesh from its chest.

The black thing had already penetrated its blood vessels, flowing with its blood.
