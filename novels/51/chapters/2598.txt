Chapter 2599: Hat of the Void

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Ju Wuwei, what do you think of the cultivation in this Saint Kingdom? Everything we have cultivated in the past seems to be useless. Everything here even seems unreal.”

Ju Wuwei should be a top-notch martial artist using sabers. If Qin Yu had not obtained that divine bow, it would have been difficult for Qin Yu to fight with him.

“From the perspective of Blade Cultivation, I don’t feel it’s completely different, but putting a huge shackle on myself instead. Saint power and spiritual energy of the mortal realm are two completely different levels. I guess our souls are temporarily unable to adapt to this energy, so we can’t feel this saber intent.” Ju Wuwei pondered for a moment before voicing out his thoughts.

“What do you think?”

“As long as we can continuously baptized by Saint power, our souls will surely become stronger. You can see this from the living beings we encountered in the first stage. Even the Confused Consciousness at the lowest level is not inferior to us in strength. The soldiers here should be Human Consciousness. Whether they are the soldiers of the commando team or the generals, their strength is far beyond ours. Moreover…”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“They harbor great hostility towards us as if the arrival of outsiders like us has led to a tremendous upheaval here. The necromancer has likely appeared because of us. If I hadn’t happened to acquire that bow this time, we might have already perished.”

“Indeed. If that necromancer attacks again and Lu Liefeng can’t withstand it, we will all die.”

Ju Wuwei said with a bitter smile.

The necromancer, Seifer, was no longer someone they could deal with. The two of them chatted for a while more.

Ju Wuwei began cultivating his saber technique, and Qin Yu glanced at his condition.

His Seal of Heaven Returning had completely cooled down. However, he had used the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze twice in a row today. At this moment, he seemed very tired and could no longer gather energy.

At this moment, the power of the eye of true vision had completely disappeared. If the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze was condensing energy, he could no longer spy on the surrounding situation.

That was the general situation. Qin Yu walked down the city wall. Now that Seifer’s ogre army had completely retreated, they should not continue to attack the city for the time being.

He had to take this opportunity to understand Nine Tune City, including the instructions the old man had given earlier.

He had relied on the old man’s bow to survive. Perhaps this time, breaking through the situation was vaguely related to what he had instructed. However, how could he get to the dungeon?

However, before he could leave, a soldier stopped him.

“Qin Yu, the outsider, follow me to the warehouse to claim your reward.” Qin Yu’s heart skipped a beat as he followed closely behind the soldier.

The first time he came to the tribe, he received a doa lecture from the village chief because he had saved the little boy and the old man. What would he get this time?

Qin Yu came to the warehouse and was instantly attracted by the dazzling array of things.

Ten bodybuilding pills that could greatly strengthen one’s physical fitness.

Ten recovery pills that could heal all injuries in a short time.

Ten spirit-strengthening pills that could strengthen the power of the spirit.

A set of armor.

The open-edged weapon, a large knife the commando team used.

“Can I choose any of these?”

Qin Yu turned around and asked. These things were essential. The weapon he used in the battle earlier was just an ordinary saber that he had casually picked up.

Moreover, they had confiscated it when they went down the city tower. The soldiers of the commando team had killed the ogre with a single slash. Their weapons were probably top-grade.

“As the first battle of an outsider, your battle merits are calculated by double. Therefore, you can exchange for three items in total. Originally, you can’t exchange for a mysterious item with your battle achievements. However, considering the battle mission of the next stage, you can use your battle achievements to exchange for a mysterious item.”

The soldier behind him said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at the items behind him and walked straight to the back.

Nearly ten black light clusters were floating there. Even if Qin Yu opened the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, she could not see what was inside these light clusters.

“These are items brought in by outsiders. We can’t inspect these items. They might be ordinary items or powerful magical artifacts. However, I want to remind you that you can’t cancel it once you choose the mysterious item, and your future wartime assignments will also be of a higher level.”

Although the soldiers at his back were impatient, they still explained everything clearly to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned for a long time and decided to choose one of the mysterious items.

Although the things in front of him were not bad, it was difficult for them to bring about a qualitative improvement for him.

With the divine bow Elder Tianji left behind and the presence of Ju Wuwei, it should not be a problem for them to ensure their safety.

However, if he ultimately had to face Seifer, these things could not save his life.

Moreover, there was a crucial point.

After he arrived in this Saint Kingdom, regardless of Five Emperor Coins or Evil

Eye, all of them stayed in the lower realm and could not follow him into the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. Therefore, the magical artifacts that could come here were even more formidable than artifacts like the Five Emperor Coins, or one could say they are more suitable for this Saint Kingdom.

Qin Yu hesitated for a long time before he finally made up his mind. He gritted his teeth and chose the first black light cluster, raising his hand to crush it directly.

When he saw the object under the black light luster, he was overwhelmed.

There quietly laid a green high hat.

The blood in Qin Yu’s blood vessels was surging, and he almost could not catch his breath. He had spent so much effort to kill the ogre, and he chose this hat in the end.

“We can’t touch these mysterious things. We didn’t put it there.”

The soldier seemed to have seen the killing intent in Qin Yu’s eyes and hurriedly explained.

After ten minutes or so, Qin Yu gradually calmed down.

After hesitating for a long time, he finally raised his trembling hand and grabbed the hat. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As soon as he touched it, Qin Yu felt a chilling sensation forcefully surging into his blood vessels.

The hat melted like ice and snow touching hot water, turning into countless lines that climbed up along Qin Yu’s arm.

It then surged over his shoulder and quickly crawled toward the higher ground.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. All this happened too quickly, and he was completely powerless to stop it.

The next moment, the hat was already on his head.

A large amount of information also surged into his sea of consciousness.

When the Hat of the Void was attacked by an attack that the body could not withstand, the body turned into nothingness for three seconds.

After three seconds, it would return to its original state. After one minute, all attacks received would increase by ten times.

At this moment, Qin Yu was not in the mood to look at this information. Under his control, the hat slowly turned black. Only then did he heave a sigh of relief.

Which perverted master had refined this hat? This was simply insane.

When the hat changed color, Qin Yu’s eyes lit up when he saw the words.

This hat was indeed a divine artifact. When the body failed to withstand the attack, it would turn into nothingness..
