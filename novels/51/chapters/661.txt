Chapter 662: Fighting Geng Si! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Upon hearing this voice, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

He hurriedly took a few steps back and deleted the message to Xia Hang at the same time.

Geng Si was not in a hurry. He placed his hands behind his back and looked at Qin Yu quietly with a pair of vulture-like eyes.

Even though he had restrained his internal Qi, the powerful aura on his body still gave off a powerful pressure.

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly. He had never expected that he would be discovered by Geng Si.

“Purple Robe...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

“To be able to appear silently by my side, a Purple Robe is indeed not simple,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Geng Si ignored Qin Yu’s words and only quietly said, “Have you thought about how you are going to die?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “To be honest, in my plan, I will escape from your hands.”

“Oh?” Geng Si raised his eyebrows with a playful look on his face.

“Do you think you can escape from my hands?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I have changed my mind now.”

“You saw something that you shouldn’t see, so... you must die here today,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Geng Si said faintly, “I’m afraid you can’t kill me by yourself.”

Qin Yu was also somewhat uncertain. Although he said so, he was starting to panic in his heart.

If he wanted to escape, Qin Yu naturally had a way. However, all his previous efforts would be wasted.

At that time, Xia hang would definitely be executed by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Whether it works or not, I can only give it my all.” Qin Yu’s body burst with golden light, and a terrifying internal Qi spread out.

On the other hand, Geng Si was still extremely calm, as if he didn’t care about Qin Yu at all.

“Everyone says that the Purple Robes of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association are all extremely powerful. I would like to witness this power myself too!”

Qin Yu shouted, and immediately stepped onto the ground and activated Shrinking Ground Into An Inch. He held the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist in his hand, and charged straight at Geng Si!

“You are seeking death!” Geng Si said coldly.

He raised his hand and faced Qin Yu head-on.

“Clang!”

The collision of pure physical bodies actually forced Qin Yu back a few steps.

This made Qin Yu even more uneasy. One had to know that in terms of fighting using physical body alone, Qin Yu had never met a worthy opponent!

And at this moment, Geng Si’s physical body was actually not weaker than his own!

“No, he must have used some kind of spell,” Qin Yu thought in his heart.

Geng Si looked at Qin Yu coldly and said word by word, “I don’t want to waste too much time, so you’d better hurry up and die.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Geng Si’s figure disappeared.

His extremely fast speed made Qin Yu unable to react in time.

“Bang!”

In almost an instant, Geng Si’s palm landed a hit on Qin Yu’s chest!

“Deng Deng Deng Deng!”

Qin Yu immediately took a few steps back, and his chest felt stuffy.

His expression became even uglier. Geng Si’s speed was too fast!

“To be able to withstand my palm, you aren’t bad,” Geng si said indifferently.

Qin Yu looked at Geng Si with a serious expression and said, “As expected of a Purple Robe of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association... I think you are one of the outstanding ones, right?”

Geng Si shook his head and said, “No, I am the weakest among the Purple Robes.”

Qin Yu did not know whether Geng Si was telling the truth or not, but at least he could confirm that the Jingdu martial arts association still had many Purple Robes!

“I have to give it my all.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He was definitely not willing to give up. He did not know when the next opportunity would come.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately activated the Divine Dragon Power and rushed towards Geng Si in big steps.

With the support of the Divine Dragon Power, Qin Yu’s strength instantly skyrocketed.

His fierce fist, which was brewing the power that could split Heaven and Earth, fiercely swung towards Geng Si!

Geng Si snorted coldly. He casually raised his palm to meet Qin Yu.

“Clang!”

Another violent collision!

This time, Geng Si was forced back three steps!

Qin Yu was no better. He felt as if his punch just hit solid rock. The impact shook his wrist so hard that it hurt.

“You have some ability.” Geng Si’s face gradually turned cold.

“No wonder they sent me to catch you. If I have time, I would like to play with you more.” Geng Si sneered.

As he spoke, his internal Qi began to climb and a strong sense of oppression rushed toward Qin Yu.

“Late-stage of the Martial Marquis Realm?!” Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change.

The early, middle and late stages of the Martial Marquis Realm were vastly different in strength. There was also a huge difference between them.

After the late stage of the Martial Marquis realm, there was the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm, which was only one step away from becoming a Martial Saint!

Obviously, Geng Si had already stepped into the late stage for a long time and was only one step away from the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm.

Qin Yu’s face was slightly solemn. He gritted his teeth and said coldly, “No matter what realm you are in, you will die here today!”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu shouted loudly and golden light instantly exploded on his fist!

“Go to hell!”

The golden light on Qin Yu’s fist poured out, almost shattering the entire street.

Geng Si did not dare to be negligent. He slowly raised his hands, and a force gathered in front of his chest.

In the next second, Geng Si roared angrily, and his hands pushed forward with force.

“Boom!”

Two streams of internal Qi collided at this moment! A terrifying aftershock immediately spread out in all directions!

Before Qin Yu could be shocked, Geng Si raised his palm once again.

A huge palm instantly appeared out of thin air!

This palm struck Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s entire body was instantly smacked to the ground!

Geng Si did not stop at this point. His hands quickly slid, and sword-like sharp blades rapidly slashed towards Qin Yu’s body.

“Slash Slash!”

This spell was extremely strange. It actually directly entered Qin Yu’s body!

In a short while, Qin Yu’s body emitted bursts of explosive sounds.

That force seemed to explode in Qin Yu’s body. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“What... What kind of spell is this!” Qin Yu’s expression changed.

The Qi energy that came out from his inside penetrated all of Qin Yu’s defenses.

Geng Si said coldly, “There are many ways to deal with you.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He stood up from the ground and then forcefully pushed his body to shoot backward.

“Spiritual Fire Seal!”

In the next second, Qin Yu gathered the internal Qi in his body and shot out the Spiritual Fire Seal.

The lotus-like spiritual fire quickly pressed toward Geng Si!

Geng Si narrowed his eyes and said, “Spiritual fire? Interesting.”

Geng Si’s hands shook, and then he murmured in the air.?The word “Exterminate” condensed in front of his chest.

This big word seemed to be cast by black flames, and a strange internal Qi jumped on it!

“Exterminate!”

Geng Si shouted and then pushed the big word out with force.

“Whoosh!”

The moment it came into contact with Qin Yu’s spiritual fire, the Spiritual Fire Seal instantly dimmed a few times.

However, this did not stop the spiritual fire seal’s footsteps. It landed on Geng Si’s body almost instantly.

“Whoosh!”

Geng Si’s body was instantly wrapped up by the Spiritual Fire Seal!
