Chapter 1737: On the Verge of Resurrecting Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu did not know how to use the purple cloud pearl, but judging from the Yan family’s tone, the use of the purple cloud pearl was probably beyond his imagination.

So, Qin Yu flicked a wisp of his breath into the purple cloud pearl.

The moment it entered, Qin Yu’s divine sense felt an extremely powerful force coming at him!

Qin Yu was overjoyed by this. He hurriedly activated the purple cloud pearl and exuded a wisp of aura, just like Chao Shou.

At some point, the sky turned dark and a terrifying aura swept through the entire Divine Capital City!

!!

At this moment, the Divine Inscription Formation flickered and glowed, forming one thin line after another in the air. They were so dense that it was as if they were about to shatter!

After feeling the power, Qin Yu quickly put away the purple cloud pearl.

He was overjoyed. The power of the purple cloud pearl was more terrifying than he had imagined!

With this pearl, he would have enough confidence in dealing with Yuan Xiu!

“So the two brothers of the Chao family rely on this.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After much consideration, Qin Yu finally decided to make a trip to Fengzhu Mountain and Dayue Mountain. He would be more confident with two Reversion Void Stage mighty figures around.

So, Qin Yu left the Divine Capital City.

Fengzhu Mountain was relatively close to this place, so Qin Yu rushed to Fengzhu Mountain first.

At the same time, many cultivators from the North Plain were surrounding the foot of the snowy mountain.

Yuan Xiu was sitting cross-legged on the snowy mountain. A powerful aura was brewing between his brows.

His terrifying divine sense seemed to be completely taking form at this moment!

“It won’t be long before I can be completely resurrected.” Yuan Xiu took a deep breath. The excitement in his eyes could not be concealed.

Sima Bei, Yong Ji, and the others lowered their heads and followed behind Yuan Xiu.

“Without the two brothers of the Chao family, it will be convenient for me to unify Lizhou.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

When this topic was brought up, Yuan Xiu could not help but think of Xiao Sheng.

Thus, Yuan Xiu looked at the person beside him and coldly said, “Have you found Xiao Sheng?”

Yong Ji and Sima Bei shook their heads and said, “We still… haven’t.”

Yuan Xiu’s face turned cold as he rebuked, “You two pieces of trash! What do I need you for?”

This matter was the responsibility of Sima Bei, so he naturally did not dare to say much.

Yuan Xiu’s face darkened and he said in a low voice, “Xiao Sheng is an unstable factor. If he steps into the Reversion Void Stage, he will definitely become my obstacle. I have to find a way to get rid of him.”

Although he said this tactfully, Yuan Xiu was actually not confident at all.

if Xiao Sheng had reached the Reversion Void Stage, he didn’t think he would have any chance of winning.

“Master, why are you so worried about Xiao Sheng? With the inheritance of the Immortal Slaying Sect, I don’t think Xiao Sheng is worth mentioning.” He Teng said from the side.

Yuan Xiu cast a cold glance at He Teng and snorted. “What I’ve comprehended is just the tip of the iceberg. If I can completely comprehend the Immortal Slaying Sect’s inheritance, I won’t be afraid of even Zhongzhou, let alone Xiao Sheng! ”

He Teng remained silent, but he was mocking in his heart.

It’s a f*cking waste for such a sacred inheritance to fall into your hands.

“Lord, our men are still searching for traces of Xiao Sheng in Nanzhou. Don’t worry, as long as he dares to show himself, I guarantee that he will die without a doubt!” Sima Bei said as he bowed.

Yuan Xiu snorted coldly. Just as he was about to speak, someone ran over in a hurry.

“Lord, there’s news of Xiao Sheng!”

A man in black quickly ran to Yuan Xiu and knelt on the ground. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Yuan Xiu’s eyes lit up.

“Tell me, where is Xiao Sheng?” he said hurriedly.

The man in black didn’t dare to waste time and quickly said, “Our men found Xiao Sheng in Nanzhou today. He and Qin Yu are heading towards the Divine Capital City.”

“With Qin Yu?” hearing this, Yong Ji’s eyes lit up.

Sima Bei narrowed his eyes and sneered, “That’s just right, I’ll kill him too!”

“Lord, let me do this!” Yuan Xiu volunteered. “I have a deep grudge against Qin Yu. I must kill him!”

Sima Bei glanced at Yong Ji, then said, “All of you, go together. No matter what, we must ensure that Xiao Sheng is dead.”

“Yes!” Yong Ji agreed without even thinking.

However, at this moment, Sima Bei said, “I remember that the Divine Capital City is very difficult to enter, even for those in the Reversion Void Stage.”

After Sima Bei’s reminder, Yong Ji’s alarm also rang.

He had been too excited just now and had forgotten about this.

“Indeed, the Divine Capital City has a Divine Inscription Formation. I’m afraid it won’t be easy to break in,” he said in a low voice with a frown.

“No matter how difficult it is, I still have to try.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

“The three of you, go together. No matter what, we have to break the Divine Inscription Formation and kill Xiao Sheng!”

The three of them received the order and immediately left the North Plain, heading straight for the Divine Capital City.

As for Yuan Xiu, he stayed behind to ensure that his body could resurrect completely.

…

Fengzhu Mountain.

Qin Yu sat across from Qu Zhu and expressed her intention.

“All we need to do is wait until Xiao Sheng reaches the Reversion Void Stage,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“That’s a completely revived Yuan Xiu,” Qu Zhu lamented. “His strength is definitely not something an ordinary Reversion Void Stage cultivator can compare to. I’m afraid he’s already reached the middle stage of Reversion Void. I’m afraid we’re not his match.”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded and said, “We might not be his match, but I have a way.”

“You have a way?” Qu Zhu smiled but didn’t say anything. Apparently, he didn’t believe Qin Yu.

“Mmm.” Qin Yu nodded and continued, “We’re just stalling for time anyway. I think we should be able to do it.”

“Alright,” he said. This time, Qu Zhu agreed without hesitation, which surprised Qin Yu.

Seeing Qin Yu’s shocked expression, Qu Zhu said jokingly, “What, you don’t think I’ll do anything?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded with a bitter smile.

Qu Zhu sighed. “I didn’t want to do it. I don’t know why, but I’ve changed my mind.”

“After defeating Yuan Xiu that day, people came to visit Fengzhu Mountain every day. I’ve never received such treatment before.

“I think I can understand Xiao Hai a little.”

At the mention of Xiao Hai, Qin Yu could not help but sigh.”If Senior Xiao Hai was still alive, perhaps we wouldn’t be in such a sorry state.”

Qu Zhu rolled his eyes at Qin Yu and said, “The dead can’t be brought back to life, don’t think about that anymore.”

Qin Yu nodded, then stood up and said, “Then I won’t disturb you any longer.”

After leaving Fengzhu Mountain, Qin Yu went straight to Dayue Mountain.

Just as Qin Yu was heading to Dayue Mountain, Yong Ji and the others had already arrived at the Divine Capital City through the teleportation formation.

They looked down at Divine Capital City from above with extremely cold expressions.

“This is the Divine Capital City?” Sima Bei’s eyes narrowed.

“Yes,” Yong Ji said. “It used to be a dead city. I don’t know what kind of luck Qin Yu had, but he actually revived the formation here.
