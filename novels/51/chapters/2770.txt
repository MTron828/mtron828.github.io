Chapter 2771: The Number One Kulapati, Bai Zizai

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu guessed this was in line with his character.

Furthermore, he now had the Boundless Heart of Saint Kingdom. He had also become one of the four great leaders.

He was probably not weak, so this guess was more likely.

However, Qin Yu did not notice a hazy energy.

It was unknown when it had enveloped the sky and where this power was.

The heavenly secrets were reversed. It seemed to have interfered with the operation of some kind of order.

This power suddenly disappeared after a few breaths as if it had never appeared.

At this moment, in the open space at the top of the Nine Nether Cliff.

A white-haired old man threw a gourd and poured all the wine into his mouth.

“Why is it finished again?”

He threw the gourd high and kicked it up with his right foot.

He seemed to be an old child with a row of neatly stacked heads behind him.

These heads were arranged in a huge square matrix. The cut and size were almost the same.

He threw the gourd high and kicked it up with his right foot.

He seemed to be an old child with a row of neatly stacked heads behind him.

These heads were arranged in a huge square matrix. The cut and size were almost the same.

They looked like neatly arranged toys. Nearly a thousand meters of skeletons were piled up on top, blocking a large part of the sky. “So annoying! Why hasn’t anyone come here for so long?”

The old man suddenly roared in frustration.

His voice was like a drunkard’s.

However, an Eight-armed Blood Bear that was a hundred meters tall suddenly lost all color in its pupils when it heard the voice.

Its huge body smashed into a space in the Nine Nether Cliff.

“Oh my god, run! The number one kulapati is going crazy again!

Hearing the roar from the top of the mountain, a group of people suddenly rushed out from where they were.

They frantically ran down for a long distance.

“The old fellow hasn’t gone crazy for a long time. What’s going on today?” Chang Mang wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.

Chang Mang wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.

The people around did not have a good expression either. Even the mortal enemies were looking at the peak with nervous expressions.

They were afraid that they would speak too loudly and affect the old man.

“Who knows what this old man is up to today? I feel that this position is still too conservative. I’ll walk a little further first.”

One of them straightened his hands and his entire body flew down like a bird.

“Tsk! You’re as timid as a mouse. I still have something to do and have to go down the mountain to pick some herbs. I’ll take my leave first.”

A middle-aged man sneered and tapped his foot lightly.

It was as if he was taking a stroll, but his speed was not slower than the flying fellow.

“I’d better walk down too.”

Chang Mang’s eyelids twitched.

He was not convinced by anyone here.

He even dared to challenge the one behind the Guardian of Order with his holy body.

However, he saw the old man directly remove the head of a demon expert who had almost killed him when he came to the Nine Nether Cliff.

Then, he even asked him to stack it up and whispered at the side.

This experience caused Chang Mang to feel a deep fear for this old man.

This was a completely different cultivation realm from theirs.

Moreover, almost everyone in the high ground of the Nine Nether Cliff had encountered such a thing.

If they were lucky, they would be fine. If they were unlucky, their heads would be removed and he would choose another person.

The most terrifying thing was that he had never seen anyone last a round against this old man in all these years.

Thump, thump, thump…

Bai Zizai, the number one kulapati, felt a little irritated.

He kicked the gourd hard. It slowly rolled down the stairs this time.

“Forget it. I haven’t left the mountain for a long time. I’ll go for a walk.”

The old man let out a burp. The overwhelming smell of alcohol formed a mist in his space.

“Run! The old man is going down the mountain.”

A person saw the grayish-white robe and immediately shouted in fear.

“So noisy!”

Bai Zizai moved his hand. The man’s head was then caught in his hand.

A few seconds later, blood spurted out.

The entire space was deathly silent. No one dared to make any movement, afraid that it would cause the old fellow unsatisfied.

“You! Lead the way. Follow me down the mountain to buy wine.”

The old man pointed at Chang Mang. Without waiting for Chang Mang to walk forward, he began to stagger down slowly.

Chang Mang’s heart skipped a beat. How would he know any wine seller here?

He complained endlessly in his heart but he did not dare to have any other thoughts. He could only slowly follow behind the old man.

Bai Zizai seemed to be drunk and dizzying. His whole body was swaying and he did not know which way to go.

Chang Mang’s heart palpitated when he saw his current state.

Who knew how many people he had killed in this state? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Who knew how many of the tens of thousands of heads on the mountain peak were killed in this way?

At this moment, Chang Mang wished he could give himself a few tight slaps. Why didn’t he follow those people and run away earlier?

“Brat, I have a question for you!”

The old man suddenly turned his head. His eyes were burning as he stared at

Chang Mang.

“I’m over!”

Chang Mang felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave. His face had lost all color.

Once this old man asked someone a question, no one had survived until now!

Seeing Chang Mang’s face as if he had seen a ghost, the old man suddenly felt bored.

“Forget it. Let’s get some wine. Xiao An doesn’t like me killing people, so I won’t kill anyone today.”

Chang Mang let out a deep breath. His had been saved.

He wondered what was going on with this old man. It was the first time he left the mountain in so many years.

Demonic qi was surging in the Demon Sealing Valley.

A person sat cross-legged on the black lotus and slowly opened his eyes.

A terrifying power spread out from the black lotus.

But for some reason, Pang De felt as if he was facing the most ancient power of heaven and earth.

He couldn’t raise any thoughts of resistance against this power.

“The second tribulation of the Seven Tribulations Sin.” Wu Tian looked up at the sky and smiled strangely.

After the power disappeared, his face turned slightly pale.

It seemed that using this energy had cost him a lot.

“Pang De, you seem to be curious about this power.”

Wu Tian said softly.

He looked at his subordinate beside him and a hint of tenderness flashed across his face.

This person had been following him since before he fell into the Path of Demon.

Even when his strength was not strong, he had never had second thoughts.

This man was more important than his children to Wu Tian.

Therefore, he was not stingy with giving Pang De hints at times.

“This power gives me a strong feeling. I wonder who it is that needs Buddha Wu Tian’s help.”

Pang De wanted to do it himself so that Wu Tian wouldn’t waste his precious strength.

“This is the evil power of all living beings discharged from the Faramita of the

Buddhist Kingdom, which extends to the Seven Tribulations Sin..”
