Qin Yu’s body carried a faintly discernible sense of oppression.

This oppressive feeling caused this woman’s expression to become even more panicked.

However, at this moment, her entire body didn’t have the slightest bit of strength. She had become a fish that was waiting to be slaughtered.

“What do you want to do?” The woman said with some fear.

Qin Yu said with a faint smile, “Don’t worry. As long as you obediently cooperate, I guarantee that I won’t kill you.”

“Cooperate?” The woman raised her eyebrows and said with a smirk, “Men are such scum. You reject me when I offer myself, but you want to force it?”

Qin Yu sneered. “You’re overthinking it. I just have something to ask you. You can just lie here obediently.”

The woman frowned and said, “Something to ask? What do you want to ask?”

Qin Yu ignored her and slightly clenched his fist, feeling the abundant power in his body.

“I’ve finally stepped into the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.” Qin Yu sighed.

The gap between the two stages was indescribable.

There was a world of difference between the early stage of the Martial Marquis Realm and the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm!

The current Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of the peak of the Martial Marquis realm at all!

To the chaotic body, it was just an instinct to fight against those at a higher level.

“Not only did I step into the late stage of the Martial Marquis realm, but I also comprehended a spell...” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Spell? What spell?” The woman asked with a frown.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “A spell that can absorb the nature’s spiritual energy.”

The woman’s expression changed slightly, and she exclaimed, “The disappearance of my internal qi just now was because of this spell?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded.

The woman said with some pain, “I’ve cultivated for dozens of years, but you actually destroyed my foundation?”

“Don’t worry.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“I just figured out this spell, so it’s not that exaggerated.”

“The internal qi in your body can be recovered after a period of rest.”

Although that was the case, the woman was still full of worry.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with her. He touched his chin and said in a low voice, “What should the name of this spell be?”

He stood there and pondered for a long time. Then, he patted his head and said, “I’ll just call it the divine devouring technique!”

The woman couldn’t help but snicker. “After thinking for a long time, you came up with such a name? The divine devouring technique... can it be any uglier?”

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “You are now in my hands. It’s very easy for me to make you die. If I want you to live a life worse than death, it’s even easier.”

The woman’s expression changed. She gritted her teeth and said, “You’d better not act recklessly. Otherwise... otherwise, Han Palace won’t let you go!”

Qin Yu squatted down and sneered. “I hate people who threaten me the most in my life. Do you understand?”

The woman opened her mouth and didn’t dare to say anything for a moment.

“From now on, you will answer whatever I ask you. If I find out that you are lying, I will kill you without hesitation,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The woman bit her lips and said, “Tell me.”

“What’s your name?” Qin Yu asked.

The woman said coldly, “Zhang Yijiu.”

“What organization is the Han Palace that you mentioned?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

Speaking of Han Palace, Zhang Yijiu said proudly, “Our Han Palace is a sect that has been passed down for thousands of years! It is not something that trifling people like you can provoke!”

“A sect that has been passed down for a thousand years?” Qin Yu touched his chin.

As expected, there were still many top sects that had been passed down in this world.

“What’s the strength of your Sect Master? A Martial Saint?” Qin Yu asked with some doubt.

Zhang Yijiu snorted lightly. “Although our Sect Master hasn’t become a Martial Saint, he’s still very close. He’s just one step away!”

“Oh.” Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

As long as he wasn’t a Martial Saint, then it would be easy to deal with him.

“A sect that has been passed down for a thousand years, yet the Sect Master is only at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm?” Qin Yu said with a hint of ridicule.

Zhang Yijiu sneered. “Do you only know about the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm? Let me tell you, there’s still the Consummate realm above the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm! And above the Consummate realm, there’s even the half-step Martial Saint Realm!”

“The difference between each realm is like the difference between the clouds and the mud! It is definitely not something you can imagine!”

Qin Yu slapped his head.

He had actually forgotten about the half-step Martial Saint realm.

“In other words... your Sect Master is a half-step Martial Saint?” Qin Yu asked.

Zhang Yijiu opened her mouth and snorted coldly. “No, our Sect Master is at the Consummate stage.”

“That’s not very impressive either.” Qin Yu sneered.

“You’d better not insult our Sect Master! Or else...”

“Or else what?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Zhang Yijiu gritted her teeth and snorted. “What else do you have to ask?”

“Last question.” Qin Yu stood up.

“What’s the purpose of you snatching that mask?” Qin Yu’s voice became a bit cold.

Zhang Yijiu frowned slightly and she shook her head. “I don’t know. In short, our Sect Master said that this mask is very important. We must get this mask no matter what.”

Qin Yu continued to ask, “Then did your Sect Master say what the function of this mask is? Or how should this mask be used?”

Zhang Yijiu shook his head and said, “I don’t know. Sect Master didn’t say.”

Qin Yu sighed and said in a low voice, “There’s no useful information. You’re really a waste.”

Zhang Yijiu secretly gritted his teeth and said with some anger, “I’m at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm! How dare you call me trash?!”

Qin Yu didn’t respond. He reached out his hand and grabbed Zhang Yijiu’s collar, lifting her up.

Zhang Yijiu panicked. She said anxiously, “What... What are you doing? Let me go!”

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “If I let you go now, can you go back?”

Zhang Yijiu frowned slightly.

That was the truth. She didn’t have any strength in her body now, and it was difficult for her to walk.

“Don’t worry. I still have use for you. I won’t kill you yet,” Qin Yu said as he walked.

Zhang Yijiu gritted her teeth. She braced herself and said, “Can you change your position? Do you have to carry me like this?”

“No,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

...

Qin Yu carried Zhang Yijiu all the way back to the Tang family.

As soon as they entered, Tang Mo ran over.

“Qin Yu, why did you bring a girl back? This girl seems pretty pretty,” Tang Mo licked his lips and said with a lecherous look.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “She cultivates by absorbing men’s essence. Anyone who has had sex with her will turn into a skeleton.”

Upon hearing this, Tang Mo immediately staggered in fright.

“Qin Yu, who exactly is this woman?” Tang Sheng couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu explained, “She came from Han Palace and tried to sneak attack me, but I caught her.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Han Palace?” When he heard this name, Tang Sheng’s expression couldn’t help but slightly change.

“It seems you’ve heard of Han Palace.” Zhang Yijiu sneered.

“Since you’ve heard of Han Palace’s great name, I advise you to release me as soon as possible. Otherwise, our Sect Master will certainly bring an army to destroy the Tang family!”
