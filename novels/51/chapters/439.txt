Qin Yu felt that his strange gaze was a little strange.

But he didn’t care.

After all, in the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of anyone.

If He Teng really had any bad thoughts, Qin Yu didn’t mind killing him.

“Mr. He, how much did you spend to buy this inner core?” Qin Yu pointed at the inner core in He Teng’s hand and asked.

He Teng said, “Those rich people aren’t discerning at all. They think this is a night pearl, so I spent 300,000 yuan to buy it.”

“Let’s not talk about it anymore. It will be close to three days before we arrive. I’m going into seclusion for three days,” He Teng said while playing with the inner core.

Qin Yu nodded.

After He Teng left, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Can you sense what He Teng is thinking?” Qin Yu asked Fang Yue.

Fang Yue shook her head and said, “Unfortunately, I can’t do it. Every time I try to read his mind, I will be cut off by a strange force.”

To read his mind, she relied on her divine sense.

Obviously, He Teng’s divine sense was above Fang Yue’s.

It was also above Qin Yu’s.

Fang Yue could read Qin Yu’s mind, but she couldn’t read He Teng’s mind.

“It seems that our thoughts coincide,” Fang Yue said calmly.

Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue and signaled for her to continue.

Fang Yue continued, “Before this, He Teng and I had no connection. We didn’t even know each other.”

“He suddenly asked me to come to Brightheart Island. How could I not be suspicious?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Maybe he has taken a fancy to you.”

Fang Yue shook her head and said with some solemnity, “This person’s divine sense is extremely powerful. It is far from what one can possess at his age.”

“So... I think...”

“Possession!”

The two of them said it almost at the same time!

Sure enough, Fang Yue had already expected it!

“Aren’t you afraid that he will kill you if you follow him to Brightheart Island?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Fang Yue smiled jokingly and said, “With Mr. Qin here, I believe that Mr. Qin will protect me.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and didn’t say anything.

Before this, Fang Yue didn’t know that Qin Yu would come, so how could she have extected his protection?

There were only two reasons why Fang Yue dared to come.

Either she thought that He Teng wouldn’t do anything to her.

Or, she wasn’t afraid of He Teng at all!

...

On the huge ship, there were only four martial artists:

Qin Yu, Dongchuan King Meng Wuxiong, Fang Yue, and He Teng. who had gone into seclusion.

Other than that, they were all ordinary people.

“Don’t these rich people have bodyguards?” Qin Yu muttered as he walked towards the auction.

As he spoke, Qin Yu arrived at the auction house.

He had wanted to try his luck, but unfortunately, the auction only happened once a day, and today’s one and only event had already ended.

Helpless, Qin Yu could only come back tomorrow.

Following that, Qin Yu felt bored to death.

He turned his gaze towards the Dongchuan King Meng Wuxiong.

This person’s experience was somewhat similar to He Teng’s, but the difference was that Meng Wuxiong most likely didn’t get his prowess through possession.

This was because it was impossible to create several Inner Strength Grandmasters in a short period of time through possession.

Meng Wuxiong’s lifestyle was no different from that of an ordinary person. That night, he ate and drank with a group of rich people and even got drunk.

The next day, Meng Wuxiong didn’t even get out of bed. It was enough to see how much alcohol he had drunk.

In the afternoon, the second auction started.

Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t miss this auction.

He and Old Mister Yan arrived at the entrance of the auction venue early in the morning and waited to enter.

“There are so many people.” Looking at the huge crowd at the entrance, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Old Mister Yan said indifferently, “It’s human nature to like gambling and getting a bargain. It’s the same for rich people.”

“Yeah, people like gambling and are greedy.” Qin Yu sighed.

As they spoke, the door of the auction finally opened. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Let’s go in,” Old Mister Yan said.

Qin Yu nodded and the two of them walked into the auction together.

After finding a place to sit down, Qin Yu’s eyes scanned the surroundings.

Sure enough, there wasn’t a single martial artist.

“These people all have high net worths. Don’t be too spendthrift when bidding,” Old Mister Yan reminded.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry. Since I’m here to pick up scraps, I naturally won’t bid too high.”

Old Mister Yan nodded slightly and didn’t say anything else.

Then, the two of them sat there and quietly waited for the auction to begin.

After about half an hour, the auction finally began.

Although this was an auction on a cruise ship, the scale was beyond imagination.

It was because this cruise ship was full of rich people!

It was said that this auction had spent a huge amount of money in order to be held on the cruise ship!

Their spending power far exceeded that of ordinary people, and the auction happened to be their match.

The first auction item was a cultural relic from the previous dynasty, and it was finally bought at a price of three million.

The second was an antique from a hundred years ago, and the price was more than ten million.

The third item, the fourth item, the fifth item...

There were dozens of them in a row, and almost every one of them was an artifact from the secular world.

As for the inner core that Qin Yu wanted, he hadn’t seen a single one.

“It seems that inner cores aren’t as common as I thought,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. He Teng was really lucky.

“The next item to be auctioned is a rockery. This rockery is said to be taken from the land of the dragon’s vein. Not only can it attract wealth, but it can also change luck.”

At this moment, the host on the stage took out a rockery the size of a wheel.

The rockery looked rather exquisite, but it didn’t look like a modern artifact. Instead, it looked like it was from nature.

“According to an expert’s investigation, the previous owner of this rockery was the richest man in the area, and the previous owner was even a high-ranking official in the current dynasty! In the past few years, each and every one of them is a big shot!” The host shouted.

The crowd immediately went into an uproar.

For a moment, everyone was interested in this rockery.

“Aren’t they afraid that this is a scam?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask when he saw the situation.

Old Mister Yan said indifferently, “Many people think that only the poor are deceived. In fact, it’s not the case. The rich are also deceived. It’s just that the method of deception is different.”

“For the poor, a piece of sh*t can be sold as long as it is wrapped in a bright and beautiful shell.”

“What about the rich?” Qin Yu asked.

Old Mister Yan said indifferently, “For the rich, they just need to find a few experts and famous people to brag about this piece of sh*t, and then make up its history.”

“For example... saying that this piece of sh*t was from a certain saint is enough,” Old Mister Yan said indifferently.

Qin Yu almost laughed out loud when he heard that.

“Old Mister Yan, you’ve reminded me.” The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth couldn’t help but curl up into a strange smile.

Perhaps... he could deceive this group of rich people once!
