Chapter 1089: Chapter 1,089, rumors of the Holy Region 

Upon hearing these words, Gu Zizhen sat down on the ground.

He said with a trembling voice, “How is this possible... my father is at the peak of the Martial Saint Realm. How could he die at the hands of Qin Yu... how is this possible!”

Yan Yongfu said indifferently, “Although Qin Yu is only at the early stage of the martial saint realm, once the chaotic body enters the martial saint realm, it will possess the ability to fight against those at a higher level. Your father is indeed dead.”

Gu Zizhen still wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Yan Yongfu with a wave of his hand.

Gu Zizhen was already dead, so this Gu Xinghe naturally lost his value.

These eight high-level officials no longer paid attention to Gu Zizhen, but looked at the seal in front of them.

“If we work together, within a month, we should be able to break the seal,”Yan Yongfu said.

“Once the seal is broken, the eight of us will attack together. We must kill Qin Yu as quickly as possible, not giving him any chance to escape!”

...

During this period of time, more and more people in Jingdu had stepped into the martial saint realm.

First, Yao Meng was the first to come out of seclusion. Then, Kong Yun, Chu Hedao, and the others had also stepped into the martial saint realm.

At this moment, Qin Yu was standing at the entrance of the Scripture Depository.

This was his second time entering the Scripture Depository. The difference was that this time, no one could restrict Qin Yu’s entry time.

This way, Qin Yu would have a lot of time to search for the information he wanted to know.

He stepped into the Scripture depository and extended his finger to seal the door. No one could enter.

Then, Qin Yu suddenly released his divine sense and covered the entire scripture depository.

Qin Yu’s divine sense was far more powerful than an ordinary martial saint’s. The relevant documents on the fourth level had been roughly scanned by Qin Yu in an instant.

He took large strides to the fourth level and found a book according to the information given by his divine sense.

This book did not seem to stand out at all. In fact, it was covered in dust.

Clearly, it had been many years since anyone had flipped through this book.

Qin Yu picked up this book and slowly opened it.

Rows and rows of densely packed words appeared before his eyes. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It would probably take a very long time to finish reading this entire book.

Qin Yu didn’t have much time to waste, so he didn’t think too much about it. He held the book and started reading it carefully.

For three whole days, Qin Yu didn’t leave the Scripture Pavilion.

Many people came to Qin Yu to reminisce, but they were all rejected.

In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.

More than half of the book had been read, and Qin Yu already had a general understanding of that star field.

He slowly closed the book and said in a low voice, “The records in this book are really detailed. It’s not a waste of my time.”

According to the records in this book, the star field mentioned by the handlebar mustache was called the Holy Region.

It was an incomparably huge world, and it was also the final arena for cultivators.

It was said that every top cultivator in this world had once stepped into the holy region.

The Yan family was located in the Saint Realm.

Not only did it have an endless amount of spiritual qi, but it also had countless geniuses.

“According to the records in that book, the geniuses in the Saint Realm could step into the martial saint realm at the age of thirteen or fourteen...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice and could not help but feel a trace of pressure.

In order to step into the Martial Saint Realm, Qin Yu had spent an unknown amount of effort. And in the saint realm, there were people who had already stepped into the martial saint realm at the age of thirteen or fourteen. It was really terrifying.

At Qin Yu’s age, the Almighty realm was already everywhere.

Although that was the case, it did not mean that Qin Yu was inferior to them.

After all, compared to the saint realm, the resources in this world were too scarce.

Qin Yu could not help but touch the token. His head drooped slightly, and no one knew what he was thinking.

“The saint realm... I really want to go and take a look.”Qin Yu played with the token and said in a low voice.

After learning that there were many geniuses in the Holy Region, Qin Yu didn’t feel the slightest bit of fear. On the contrary, he was somewhat expectant.

He couldn’t wait to step into the Holy Region and compete with the geniuses in the world!

According to the records in the book, there seemed to be only one way to step into the Holy Region, and that was to rely on the ancient array platforms.

But this book clearly recorded that Earth had several ancient array platforms. Many of the top experts of the Holy Region had also walked out from Earth.

But now, Qin Yu only knew of one ancient array platform, and that was the one in the first secret realm.

“That’s not right.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Previously, the mighty figures of the Yan family had descended here twice. They probably didn’t rely on the ancient array platform in the first secret realm.

Because if they passed through the ancient array platform in the first secret realm, it would mean that the eight higher-ups could also descend. But in reality, they had no way of descending.

“Could it be that they crossed the Void to come here?”Qin Yu exclaimed.

However, this idea was quickly rejected by Qin Yu.

The Almighty Realm did not have the ability to cross the void.

If that was the case, there was definitely more than one way to reach the holy region!

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly as he said in a low voice, “Earth is incomparably ancient. It has a history of billions of years. No one knows how many things are unknown.”

The ancient array platform was definitely not the only way to enter the Saint Realm!

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something!

“That’s not right!”Qin Yu suddenly stood up.

The moustache man said that he was a strand of divine sense from the Saint Realm and was once a mighty figure.

Then how did he come here?

There was only one possibility, and that was that the moustache man was lying!

He hurriedly stood up and immediately rushed towards the second mystic realm.

As soon as he returned to the second secret realm, he saw Yao Meng sitting in the main hall, chatting with the handlebar mustache.

“Miss Yao Meng, I heard that your group once had a great cultivator in the way synthesis stage. Is that true?”The handlebar mustache said with a smile.

Yao Meng said with a smile, “Those are all rumors. The way synthesis stage has not appeared for thousands of years.”

The moustache touched his chin and muttered, “The third level of the way, even in the holy region there are not many, really do not know how many Babe to leave behind:”

Here, the handlebar mustache said with a smile: “Miss Yao, another day you invite me to your home as a guest?”

Yao Meng Small Mouth slightly open, don’t know whether to laugh or cry.

“Good, good.”Yao Meng helpless nod way.

“Good my ass.”At this moment, Qin Yu walked in from outside the door.

“Miss Yao, if you let her go to your house, you have to be careful of your ancestral grave,”Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

The Mustache Man’s old face turned red and he muttered, “Look at what you’re saying. Is this lord that kind of person? I just want to be a guest.”

Qin Yu did not continue this topic. Instead, he looked at the Mustache Man.

He wanted to ask directly, but Yao Meng was still there. Qin Yu had no choice but to give up this thought temporarily.

Thus, Qin Yu walked to the opposite side of Yao Meng and slowly sat down.

“You’ve entered the Martial Saint Realm?”Qin Yu glanced at Yao Meng and asked casually.

Yao Meng nodded and said, “Yes, I just broke through not long ago.”

Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

Among his peers, who knew how many people had broken through to the martial saint realm. In the past, they were considered to be at the peak of the martial path. Now, it seemed that this was only the beginning.

“Miss Yao, you must have come here for some reason.”Qin Yu went straight to the point.

Yao Meng put down the Teacup in her hand and smiled, “That’s right. I’ve come here for the Holy Region.”

“Sanctum? You know about sanctum too?”Qin Yu’s brows suddenly furrowed.
