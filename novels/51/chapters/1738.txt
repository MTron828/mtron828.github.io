Chapter 1739: Jue Wu Awakens Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing this, Qin Yu was stunned, and Wen Wanchong quickly stood up.

At this moment, the purple cloud pearl floated above Jue Wu. It emitted rays of light that fell on Jue Wu’s body.

Jue Wu’s body seemed to have formed a connection with the purple cloud pearl, making her look extremely mysterious.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but guess!

“Could it be… Can the purple cloud pearl remove the curse on Jue Wu’s body?” Qin Yu said in surprise!

Wen Wanchong had the same guess, but he suppressed his excitement and said, “If that’s the case, that’s good news!”

The two of them didn’t make a sound and just stood there, quietly watching the purple cloud pearl and Jue Wu’s body slowly reacting.

Just as the two of them were getting excited, the purple cloud pearl suddenly burst out with an extremely devastating light!

Then, the purple cloud pearl exploded into the void and turned into thousands of colorful lights that entered Jue Wu’s body!

At the sight of this, Qin Yu’s expression changed greatly!

He couldn’t help but reach out his hand and shout, “F*ck, my purple cloud pearl!”

However, no matter how much Qin Yu shouted, the purple cloud pearl didn’t respond at all. One by one, the rays of light entered Jue Wu’s body and then disappeared without a trace!

Everything returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.

The purple cloud pearl in Qin Yu’s hand had completely disappeared.

“I’m finished…” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly.

This purple cloud pearl was Qin Yu’s last trump card, but now it was inexplicably broken!

“Without the purple cloud pearl, how am I supposed to deal with Yuan Xiu…” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice, feeling a little numb.

“Is it possible that this purple cloud pearl can awaken Jue Wu?” Wen Wanchong said.

“Even if that’s the case, I shouldn’t have chosen this time,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

He should at least wait until Yuan Xiu was defeated!

“It’s better to have nothing.” Wen Wanchong muttered.

Qin Yu sighed. Just as he was about to speak, Jue Wu, who was lying unconscious on the ground, suddenly moved her fingers.

“She moved, she moved!” Wen Wanchong shouted excitedly!

Qin Yu also noticed the abnormality in Jue Wu’s fingers. He couldn’t help but look at Jue Wu nervously.

At this time, Jue Wu’s body lightly trembled again! Wisps of aura were emitted from her body!

All this time, Jue Wu’s body had been devoid of life. The aura that was being emitted now was from Jue Wu!

“She’s really moving!”The two of them shouted at the same time!

Just as he said this, Jue Wu, who had been lying on the ground, suddenly sat up!

She rubbed her eyes and looked around in a daze, muttering, “Where the hell is this?”

Qin Yu couldn’t hold back the excitement in his heart. He rushed forward and hugged Jue Wu!

“You’re really awake. You’re finally awake!” Qin Yu hugged Jue Wu tightly and shouted in excitement!

Wen Wanchong was also very excited. He kept rubbing his hands like an old child.

Jue Wu scratched her head and frowned, “Qin Yu? Wen Wanchong? What are you two doing?”

Qin Yu understood that Jue Wu had been lying there for too long and didn’t know anything about what happened later. He could only tell her slowly.

Without waiting for Qin Yu to speak, Jue Wu’s eyes widened.

She stared at Wen Wanchong and said in shock, “You’ve actually reached the Reversion Void Stage? F*ck, when did this happen?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Wen Wanchong looked a little embarrassed. He scratched his head and said, “I was lucky, I was lucky, hehe…”

“F*ck, I couldn’t have been lying there for hundreds of years, right? ” Jue Wu’s eyes widened, and her beautiful little face was filled with fear.

“Of course not,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

After that, Qin Yu and Wen Wanchong told Jue Wu what had happened recently.

This took a very long time, and by the time they finished, the sky had already darkened.

Jue Wu, on the other hand, was confused. From time to time, she would scratch her head, her eyes revealing a look of confusion.

“Anyway, you’ve finally been resurrected. Qin Yu’s purple cloud pearl’s sacrifice was not in vain.” Wen Wanchong muttered.

“What purple cloud pearl?” Jue Wu scratched her head.

“Don’t ask so much. Anyway, the curse on your body has disappeared.” Qin Yu said.

“We’ve already told you the current situation. In a few days, Yuan Xiu will arrive. I’m afraid we don’t have much time to accompany you.” Qin Yu continued.

At the mention of Yuan Xiu, Jue Wu’s face turned solemn.

“When we were at the northern border, Xiao Hai once said that a fully resurrected Yuan Xiu is extremely terrifying. Even he would not be able to fight against him. I didn’t expect him to be resurrected in the end,” she said in a deep voice.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu said. “The world has changed greatly. Many people have taken the opportunity to step into the Reversion Void Stage, including the three lunatics and three extremes you were.”

“It seems like I’ve fallen behind. Sigh.” Jue Wu sighed slightly, a trace of sadness appearing on her little face.

“Forget it, I don’t want to think too much. I’m hungry. Quickly bring me to get something to eat.” Jue Wu jumped up and sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Seeing this, Qin Yu and Wen Wanchong both smiled bitterly.

“What are you doing? Hurry up!” Jue Wu glared at Wen Wanchong.

Wen Wanchong sneered, then ran down the mountain.

At night.

The few of them sat around a table of delicious food.

Everything was the same as before. Jue Wu brought the two Wen brothers to eat and drink, and they drank until they were drunk.

Qin Yu, however, was not in the mood to do so. He stood by the railing and looked into the distance with a solemn expression.

“Didn’t you say you still have a trump card?” at this time, Wen Wanchong walked over.

“No,” Qin Yu shook her head.

“Then what do we do?” Wen Wanchong frowned.

“I don’t know,” Qin Yu sighed. “We can only take one step at a time.”

Qin Yu could only pin his hopes on the iron rod and the bracelet that Xiao Yu had given him.

“Now that I’ve entered the Advanced-stage Mighty Realm, my combat power has also improved greatly. Although I can’t deal with Yuan Xiu, I think I can try to fight against Yong Ji or Sima Bei.” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Stop dreaming,” Wen Wanchong sneered. “An Advanced-stage Mighty Realm being is nothing but an ant in front of a Reversion Void Stage cultivator. I’m afraid you can’t even withstand a trace of his aura.”

“Maybe.” Qin Yu nodded.

He flipped his palm and took out a pill.

This pill was the Reversion Void Pill he’d gotten from Jing Bai.

‘If it really doesn’t work, I can only rely on Reversion Void Pills.’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

At the same time, the strange movements in the North Plain were becoming more and more obvious.

Countless auras were emitted from the entire North Plain, floating in the air and finally gathering in Yuan Xiu’s body.

According to Xiao Sheng’s calculations, Yuan Xiu would be resurrected tomorrow.
