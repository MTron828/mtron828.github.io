2255 Desperate Jue Wu

Jue Wu sprawled on the ground, fresh blood flowing all over.

Ming Yue felt a little uncomfortable from that gaze, and she sent another soul punishment into Jue Wu’s sea of consciousness.

Although the Nirvana Body was powerful, there were still loopholes after being severely injured.

“Truly despicable! Cultivators should know how to comply with the Path of Heaven and respect the rules of this world, which is the strong are respected.”

“Yes, Master.”

The cultivators around her bowed and said in unison. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Ming Yue said indifferently. After so many days, she had slowly calmed down.

“My Azure Firmament Sect is one of the four great forces. Even if my disciples provoke you, you should know that the forces behind them are invincible. You then used my sect’s supreme treasure to refine a divine artifact and destroy it in the sea of fire. I will let all the people related to you die before your soul.”

Ming Yue stood before the volcano and spoke word by word with her soul power.

She wanted Qin Yu’s soul to be restless even if he died so that he could live in this world miserably and could not reincarnate.

“Ah!”

Jue Wu’s fingers of both her hands dug into the sand and rocks and suddenly pulled forward.

Like a wild beast, she rushed to Ming Yue and slapped down fiercely with her palm.

“Slap!”

A clear palm print appeared on Ming Yue’s face.

Ming Yue was stunned. She did not expect the heavily injured Jue Wu to do this with her broken legs.

This palm attack basically could not cause any harm to Ming Yue but was tremendously insulting.

“I’ll kill you!”

Ming Yue’s resentful and malicious expression contorted.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body had already absorbed enormous fire elements and transformed them into chaotic qi. The chaotic qi circulated in his body and reconstructed his body.

Moreover, the purest fire element tempered every new cell.

At this moment, his expression was even more determined.

With his father’s help, his soul no longer felt lost.

His soul had been injured too many times before. From the Holy Region to this galaxy, the damage to his divine sense had been repaired through the netherworld cultivation method, and this part of his divine sense had already imperceptibly influenced Qin Yu.

This included hesitation and self-doubt during the cultivation.

Perhaps at that time, when Qin Yu’s divine sense had not fallen into the abyss, he could still control the Suo Lin divine artifact to prevent himself from being injured by the lava.

However, at that time, all the aftereffects erupted simultaneously. The black divine sense was waiting to take over his body.

“One day, I will finish you off!”

Qin Yu stared at the black Qin Yu in his divine sense and said.

“Father, thank you!”

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly and charged out of the lava.

“Old witch, did you have fun?”

Qin Yu blocked Ming Yue’s attack. He poured the chaotic qi into Jue Wu’s body to ease her injuries.

“Stinky fellow, you’re fine! You made me so worried!”

Jue Wu’s eyes lit up.

“I’m sorry for making you worry.”

Qin Yu said with a smile. With a raise of his hand, he pulled Wang Feng and Elder Guai to his side.

“Elder Guai, bring them into the Sumeru ring first. I’ll handle this.”

Qin Yu said softly.

“Hahaha, you’re actually fine. As expected of a tribulation magical artifact. To be able to survive in this lava, you’re indeed a divine artifact at the peak of the tribulation. Brat, hand over the divine artifact, and I can consider sparing your lives!”

Ming Yue’s eyes were full of surprise. She had thought this divine artifact would be buried in the lava forever and did not expect Qin Yu to be alright.

“Master, this madman killed Senior Sister Tina and the others. We can’t let him off.”

A female cultivator who was on good terms with Ouyang Tina shouted.

“Alright, it doesn’t matter anyway. The two of you take him down. He just came out of the lava, so I think he doesn’t have much strength left.”

Qin Yu’s divine sense was in the Sumeru ring just now. Wang Feng’s divine sense was severely damaged, and Elder Guai was heavily injured.

The man with the mustache and Jue Wu were slightly better but needed some time to recover.

Seeing the miserable state of the few of them and thinking of his father violating the Path of Heaven for him, a wave of anger filled Qin Yu’s mind.

“Why don’t I give you a suggestion? I’ll send you all to see Ouyang Tina.”

Qin Yu’s left hand pressed on the ground gently.

In an instant, he seemed to be able to feel the power of flames surging underground.

“Boom!”

Two fire beams shot out from the ground, and the two people attacking Qin Yu instantly turned into nothingness.

“You’re courting death!”

Ming Yue was furious as she pressed down on the air.

A tremendous force pressed down on Qin Yu. The ground beneath his feet cracked, and the cracks spread in all directions.

Almost at the same time, Ming Yue’s subordinates attacked him.

Several magical artifacts with strong spiritual energy fluctuations attacked Qin Yu, and a few people sneaked behind him and quietly attacked.

They took advantage of his sickness to kill him!

“You all deserve to die!”

The gloves in Qin Yu’s hands turned into a shield, and the massive shield smashed onto the ground.

The attack from the magical artifact did not even leave a mark on the shield. Qin Yu’s right fist struck the shield fiercely.

A vortex appeared right in the middle of Suo Lin’s shield.

The temperature in the sky suddenly fluctuated. The surrounding cultivators, who were at the center of the Fire Unicorn Continent, suddenly discovered something strange. They felt that the temperature had suddenly dropped significantly.

The space rippled like an ocean, and the fire spiritual energy in the air surged into the shield like a tide.

“Thump!”

A fire unicorn rushed out from the center of the vortex and turned into an orange hurricane.

A deep voice spread out. That voice was the roar of a fierce beast, and it contained the power of hunting souls.

A hurricane suddenly appeared, and the sound drifted out along with the wind.

The surrounding people were stunned on the spot. Qin Yu stood up, and the giant shield turned into a glove.

Qin Yu waved her hand, and a huge stream of lava rushed into the air.

Rain of fire suddenly fell from the sky, and almost everyone from Azure Firmament Sect was hit by the rain.

Everyone let out heart-rending screams. When the lava fell on their bodies, they would not die instantly but their flesh would slowly be burned by the searing heat.

A few cultivators who did not dodge in time were enveloped by it, and the surroundings were deathly silent.

“Isn’t this too fierce?”

“These dozen people are all elites of Azure Firmament Sect, and they all disappeared just like this?”

“The sound of the divine artifact just now seemed to be the sound of a fierce beast, and it has the power of the Soul-hunting Bell of Azure Firmament Sect. Otherwise, these people wouldn’t have suddenly lost their resistance.”
