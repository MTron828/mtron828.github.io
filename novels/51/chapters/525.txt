Chapter 526: Evil Sect Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing these people, the half-step Martial Marquis immediately became anxious.

“You still say you’re not a lackey of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?!” He roared angrily!

Then, he turned to look at the other people and said coldly, “You guys leave immediately. Leave this place to me!”

“Elder Lu, then... then what about you?” The expressions of the Inner Strength Grandmasters were somewhat unsightly.

The half-step Martial Marquis known as Elder Lu coldly said, “I naturally have a way. Take the dark energy formula and quickly leave!”

“Want to leave? Do you think you guys can leave?” The person from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association stretched out his hand, and the four Martial Marquis Weapons immediately buzzed and hung in all directions!

The space of the entire building was instantly confined here, and no one could escape!

Elder Lu gritted his teeth and said coldly, “We have never provoked anyone. We have even helped countless people solve the feng shui problem. What right do you have to arrest us!?”

The few members of the Martial Arts Association sneered and said, “Cultivating dark energy is evil. We are here to arrest you!”

Qin Yu remained silent at the side.

He really didn’t expect the Martial Arts Association to be so nosy. It seemed that they really regarded themselves as the law enforcers of the martial arts world.

“Are you guys coming with us, or do you guys want to be killed on the spot?” The leader asked indifferently.

Elder Lu gritted his teeth and said, “Let them go. They are still young...”

“Dream on,” the Martial Arts Association’s man interrupted Elder Lu.

“Maggots like you shouldn’t even think about escaping. We will kill every single one of you.”

“That’s right. Instead of cultivating inner strength, you guys want to cultivate dark energy. You guys deserve to die.”

Hearing this, Elder Lu seemed to be on the verge of breaking down.

He glared at the few of them and gritted his teeth. “Cultivate inner strength? All the resources in the world have been taken by you people. How can we cultivate inner strength?”

“We can’t afford the herbs. The spirit vein belongs to you nobles. You took all the benefits, yet you call us maggots!”

“I think the biggest maggots are you guys!”

“Well said!” Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but clap his hands.

Only then did the people of the Martial Arts Association notice Qin Yu.

They looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “It seems that you also belong to this evil sect.”

“What? I belong to this evil sect because I think they are right?” Qin Yu sneered.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is really good at making accusations.”

“How dare you!” Hearing this, they were instantly furious!

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association isn’t something you can slander!”

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to them. Instead, he looked at Elder Lu and said, “Elder Lu, I will help you kill them. How about you lend me that dark energy formula in return?”

At this point, Qin Yu hurriedly added, “Don’t worry, I will definitely return it to you in the future.”

Before Elder Lu could say anything, the Martial Arts Association’s people’s expression turned cold.

“Kill us? You’re quite brazen,” one of them said coldly.

“Even if you are not a heretic, you will die here today!”

With that said, the Martial Marquis Weapons in four different directions started to flash!

A wave of killing internal qi instantly spread throughout the office!

“Buzz!”

With the activation of the Martial Marquis Weapons, a terrifying wave of killing internal qi headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He immediately clenched his fist and met it head-on.

“Clang”

A deafening collision sounded in everyone’s ears!

And that wave of killing internal qi was shattered by a single punch!

Even the Martial Marquis Weapons hanging in the corner began to tremble slightly!

“You want to kill me with just a Martial Marquis Weapon?” Qin Yu sneered.

The expressions of the four Martial Arts Association members changed immediately!

One of them asked tentatively, “Who exactly are you?”

“Qin Yu,” Qin Yu said quietly with his hands behind his back.

The expressions of the four people changed drastically!

“You... You are Qin Yu?!” They subconsciously took two steps back!

Now, Qin Yu’s name had already spread throughout the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

His deeds were known by everyone!

He was known for forcing the Saint Confucian Sect, injuring vice president Xia Hang, forcefully snatching the Martial Arts Association’s Dragon Vein, and killing the descendants of aristocratic families...

Any one of these things was enough to make people tremble in fear!

Xia Hang even identified Qin Yu as “one of the most dangerous people”!

Never did they expect to meet Qin Yu here today!

“You are Qin Yu?” Elder Lu was also stunned.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Am I that famous now?”

Qin Yu’s humor didn’t ease the atmosphere, but instead made people even more nervous.

The four members of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association looked at each other.

Then, one of them took a step forward and said, “Qin Yu, our duty is to eliminate these unorthodox sects. I hope you won’t make things difficult for us.”

“Eliminate the unorthodox sects?” Qin Yu couldn’t stop laughing coldly.

“Don’t make yourself sound so noble. Who knows what the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is doing?”

“You might even catch these people and turn them into resources for your own cultivation.”

Their expressions instantly changed!

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“What, did I hit the nail on the head?” Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

“You... You’re spouting nonsense!” The few people said coldly.

“Qin Yu, you’d better get out of the way quickly. This matter has nothing to do with you!”

Qin Yu sneered. “If I see it, it has something to do with me.”

“Besides, I also hate the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s internal qi surged, and a powerful force spread out.

“Mr. Qin, please be careful!” Elder Lu, who wasn’t far away, shouted.

Qin Yu ignored him. He glanced at these people and said coldly, “Bring it on, I also cultivate dark energy. Let’s fight.”

The few of them couldn’t back down. They gritted their teeth and could only activate their Martial Marquis Weapons to force their way towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t panic at all when faced with these four Martial Marquis Weapons.

When he was at the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster stage, Qin Yu had already shattered four Martial Marquis Weapons, not to mention now!

Qin Yu clenched his hands, and a golden light immediately shone brightly!

The four Martial Marquis Weapons buzzed. Rays of light gathered into a huge ray and shot towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression didn’t change as he met the attack head-on!

His punch looked simple and unadorned, but it contained a destructive power!

The moment they collided, a huge explosion sounded!

A terrifying power spread out and sent everyone flying!

“Break!”

Qin Yu roared as the light on his fist surged!

The four Martial Marquis Weapons began to tremble violently!

In less than half a minute, the Martial Marquis Weapons could no longer hold on! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Crack!”

A few crisp sounds rang out, and the four Martial Marquis Weapons shattered with a sound!

All the light instantly disappeared, and the Martial Marquis Weapons turned into a pile of scrap metal!
