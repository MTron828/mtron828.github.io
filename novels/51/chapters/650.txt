Chapter 651: I Am Qin Yu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He held a blood-red longsword and rushed toward the round altar!

A sharp blade slashed toward Qu Xie from above!

Qu Xie snorted and said, “You’re finally here!”

Qu Xie waved his hand, and several rays of light rushed out of his white robe.

At the moment of the collision, a terrifying airwave spread out!

Qin Yu hurriedly blocked in front of Yan Ruoxue and used his physical body to forcibly withstand this airwave!

Everyone stood up and looked at the black-robed man standing on the round altar.

“The black-robed man... I’ve finally met him.” Yan Jinyao said with narrowed eyes.

“He actually dares to come!” The others couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He turned around and looked at Yan Ruoxue.

The moment he saw Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu’s heart seemed to be pulled by something, and the pain was unbearable!

Qin Yu’s body began to tremble involuntarily, and the bronze sword in his hand was buzzing.

“Black-robed man, you actually dared to come here!” Qu Xie sneered.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie coldly and said through gritted teeth, “I came here today to kill you, you beast!”

“Hahaha!” Qu Xie couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“What a shameless boast!”

Qu Xie waved his hand, and several black-gold robe powerhouses stepped forward!

Qu Xie looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Kill him for me!”

With a loud roar, one of the black-gold robe powerhouses made the first move!

His palm turned into a claw and he clawed at Qin Yu! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this moment, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with anger!

Facing the black-gold-robed man who was charging toward him, Qin Yu stabbed the long sword in his hand. Then, he summoned the golden light in his hand and smashed it fiercely!

This punch contained Qin Yu’s grief and indignation, as well as his battle intent!

The terrifying fist force smashed fiercely onto the black-gold-robed man’s palm!

“Clang!”

A loud sound rang out! Waves of air currents rippled out in all directions with the two of them as the center!

“Crack!”

Under this punch, the black-gold robe powerhouse’s palm was shattered! Blood splattered everywhere! His entire body was sent flying backward!

When everyone saw this, they couldn’t help but gasp!

Even Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes.

“He defeated a black-gold-robed man with one punch. It seems that he lives up to his reputation,” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

“As expected of Qin Yu’s mentor. I’m afraid not many people can compare with him,” said the others.

On the round altar, Qin Yu stared at Qu Xie. His body was trembling. He wanted to tear Qu Xie into pieces immediately!

Qu Xie looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Even if you are strong, you can’t change anything. Today, you will die for sure!”

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu roared. His palm shook, and the bronze sword instantly appeared in his hand!

“Qu Xie, I want you dead!”

Qin Yu’s internal qi soared. He held the sword with both hands and raised his hand to make the first cut of the Nine Taiqing Slashes!

The terrifying sword light slashed toward Qu Xie!

As the president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Qu Xie was very powerful.

Facing Qin Yu’s Nine Taiqing Slashes, Qu Xie didn’t panic at all.

He raised both hands and condensed light on his palms. Then, he faced the sword light!

“Boom!”

There was a fierce collision! Gusts of strong wind swept over, and even the people below were affected!

When the light dissipated, Qu Xie actually took a few steps back and fell to the ground!

Seeing this, everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

Qu Xie was actually not a match for this black-robed man?! How was this possible?!

“Your strength is indeed impressive.” Qu Xie stood up from the ground.

He patted the dust on his butt and said coldly, “That was just a small test. Do you really think you can fight against the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

Qu Xie controlled countless top-tier spells, so he was naturally unafraid of Qin Yu.

But as the president, he didn’t have the need to make a move himself.

Qu Xie took a step back, and the few black-gold robe powerhouses walked up.

They used the same trick again. They took out the round plate magic artifact to deal with Qin Yu’s bronze sword.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He stabbed the bronze sword into the round altar, and a bright golden light burst out from his body!

Upon seeing these rays of golden light, everyone’s pupils dilated!

This... This was simply too similar to Qin Yu’s technique!

“Looks like he really is Qin Yu’s mentor,” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

“Even their spells are exactly the same.”

“I have to say, the relationship between mentor and disciple is really impressive.”

Those few black-gold robe powerhouses walked over. They silently chanted spells in the air, and streams of divine sense shot straight towards Qin Yu’s mind!

It was obvious that these men had made a corresponding plan to target Qin Yu’s body!

“Go to hell!” Qu Xie shouted!

Qin Yu roared, and a golden light burst out from his glabella!

The golden light was in the shape of a dagger, and then it slashed over!

In an instant, all the divine sense was cut off by Qin Yu in the air!

“Huh? This person’s divine sense is actually so powerful?” Everyone couldn’t help but be shocked when they saw this!

Qin Yu retracted his divine sense. Seizing the chance, he roared and threw a fierce punch!

This punch was the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist. Its power was unimaginable. The dazzling golden light illuminated the surroundings as it smashed toward everyone!

Its terrifying power was far beyond everyone’s imagination. The black-gold robe powerhouse was sent flying!

The Black Gold Stone on their bodies suffered a great impact and began to collapse!

“This... This is a little too terrifying,” Zhuang Teng said in a deep voice.

“Even the black-gold robe powerhouses aren’t his match. What is the background of Qin Yu’s mentor?”

Yan Jinyao’s expression was also somewhat gloomy. He originally thought that he could fight this black-robed person, but now, he had the intention to retreat.

“Do you think this black-robed man is Qin Yu?” Chu Hedao guessed.

“Impossible.” Yan Jinyao glanced at him.

“Qin Yu has only cultivated for more than a year, so how could he have such strength?”

“This person has cultivated for at least fifty years!”

Everyone nodded and said, “Yes, no matter how talented Qin Yu is, it’s impossible for him to improve so fast.”

On the round altar, Qin Yu’s pupils shone with bone-piercing coldness.

He swept his gaze across the crowd. His imposing posture intimidated people.

Qu Xie sneered. “Qin Yu is already dead. Why do you have to get involved in this mess for him?”

As soon as he said this, Yan Ruoxue’s face instantly turned pale!

She grabbed Qin Yu and said in fear, “Qin... Qin Yu is dead?”

Seeing the anguish in Yan Ruoxue’s eyes, Qin Yu’s heart felt like it was being pricked by needles!

“Qin Yu is dead. This person is here to avenge Qin Yu.” Qu Xie added fuel to the flames.

He sneered. “Otherwise, why didn’t Qin Yu come to save you personally?”

“No... impossible, Qin Yu can’t be dead! Tell me, Qin Yu isn’t dead!” Yan Ruoxue almost screamed out these words.

This made Qin Yu’s heart ache. He reached out his hand and caressed Yan Ruoxue’s face.

“Don’t you dare to tell her the truth?” Qu Xie sneered.

“Impossible, Qin Yu can’t be dead...” Yan Ruoxue had a mental breakdown. In the next second, she spat out a mouthful of blood! She instantly became dispirited!

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He hknelt in front of Yan Ruoxue and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu isn’t dead. I am Qin Yu!”

Seeing Yan Ruoxue’s pained look, Qin Yu couldn’t bear to hide it anymore.

He pulled out his long sword and coldly swept his gaze across everyone present.

“I am Qin Yu,” Qin Yu said coldly.
