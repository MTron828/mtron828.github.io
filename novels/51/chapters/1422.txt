Chapter 1423: Chapter 1423: Danger and opportunity coexist

There was a hint of regret in Li Yingying’s tone, but the sarcasm on her face was not hidden.

“Yingying, it’s not easy to find someone who is sincere to you like this,”Zhuo Jing said with a smile.

Li Yingying said sarcastically, “Sincere? What do you mean by ‘sincere’? I, Li Yingying, am considered top-notch in the south province regardless of my talent or family background, right? Don’t tell me you want me to find a Lowlife?”

Zhuo Jing didn’t seem to want to argue with her on this issue, so he changed the topic and said, “Well, it has nothing to do with US anyway.”

Li Yingying hummed in acknowledgment and continued, “By the way, I’m planning to go into closed-door cultivation recently. I happen to be short of a few medicinal herbs, so I’ll borrow a few from you for the time being.”

“Your medicinal herbs are still in the cellar, right?”After saying that, Li Yingying got up and walked toward the cellar.

Zhuo Jing hurriedly pulled Li Yingying and said with a smile, “I’ll send them to you another day.”

Li Yingying said suspiciously, “I can go and get them myself. Why Bother?”

Zhuo Jing shook his head repeatedly and said, “I’ll send them to you another day.”

Li Yingying looked zhuo jing up and down and said jokingly, “What? Are you hiding a woman in your cellar?”

Zhuo Jing gave a wry smile and said, “Alright, I just ordered food. Let’s eat something first.”

Li Yingying spread her hands and said, “Alright then. Remember to send it to me. I’ll list the names for you later.”

“Okay.”Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but feel relieved.

...

In the cellar.

Qin Yu’s eyes swept around.

He was surprised to find that there were a lot of treasures hidden in this huge cellar.

Not only were there countless spirit coins, money cards, medicinal herbs, but there were also many top-notch magic treasures.

For a moment, even Qin Yu was dazzled by the dazzling array of treasures. He was dumbstruck.

“So many treasures... just what is the background of this Zhuo Family?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but swallow his saliva.

The treasures that Zhuo Jing possessed far exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination.

Most importantly, heaven knew if this was the tip of the iceberg.

Zhuo Jing’s father was at the return to void stage when he was alive. Presumably, he was once an extremely glorious family.

Such a family naturally left behind an uncountable amount of power.

Perhaps it was because of this reason that Zhuo Jing was able to keep so many treasures.

“It’s a pity that there’s no life qi.”Qin Yu sighed.

If he had obtained life qi, he wouldn’t have to hide like this.

Speaking of which, Zhuo Jing was quite ambitious. He actually allowed Qin Yu to hide in such a place. Wasn’t he afraid that Qin Yu would take the opportunity to steal all the treasures?

Qin Yu shook his head helplessly. He took a deep breath and could feel the abundant spiritual energy coming from the surroundings.

This couldn’t help but make Qin Yu feel a trace of yearning.

Time flew by and the sky gradually darkened.

Li Yingying, who had eaten and drunk her fill, finally left this place.

Zhuo Jing came to the cellar. He raised his hand and murmured in a low voice, and a mark immediately condensed in front of him.

As the mark fell, the entrance of the cellar slowly opened.

“Brother Qin, come out,”Zhuo Jing said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. His feet shook, and he jumped out of the cellar.

“Brother Zhuo, thank you for taking me in during this period of time. I plan to leave for the time being,”Qin Yu said to Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing frowned slightly and said, “Brother Qin, why are you doing this? Although my place isn’t a long-term place, I shouldn’t be able to find this place for a while. Brother Qin, you can stay for a few more days so that I can think of a way for you.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “There’s no need, brother Zhuo. I’ve troubled you during this period of time. I Can’t continue to drag you down.”

“I heard your conversation with Li Yingying just now, so... I’d better leave.”

Zhuo Jing smiled bitterly and said, “Brother Qin, you’re thinking too much. Give me a few days, I can think of a way.”

Although Zhuo Jing urged him to stay, Qin Yu still insisted on leaving.

Seeing this, Zhuo Jing could only nod and agree.

“Brother Qin, where do you plan to go when you leave the Zhuo Family?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Go to the Green Rock Forest. It’s safer for me there.”

Zhuo jing nodded and said, “The Green Rock Forest is a place where danger and opportunity coexist. If you’re lucky, you might be able to find the life force you want.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I used to work for the hunter organization. I have some experience.”

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “Besides the hunter organization, many unspecialized people also go to the green rock forest together. I’ve been there once.”

At this point, Zhuo Jing waved his hand and said, “Forget it, let’s not talk about this. Brother Qin, just be careful. If I have any good news, I will definitely tell you.”

“Many thanks.”Qin Yu bowed and said. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, Zhuo Jing suddenly called out to Qin Yu.

He quickly caught up, and then took out a token from the spatial god tool.

“Brother Qin, as long as you crush this token, I will sense your location. Similarly, if I crush the token in my hand, you will also know my location,”Zhuo Jing said.

“If I have any news, I will crush the token immediately. At that time, you will also crush the token in your hand, and I will find you according to your location.”
