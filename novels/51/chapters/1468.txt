Chapter 1469: Chapter 1,469, the overbearing Xiao Hai 1

Everyone’s gaze was immediately attracted by this voice.

“Xiao Hai!”

Upon seeing this person, long Qiao’s expression clearly didn’t look too good.

The others also looked towards Xiao Hai, their faces revealing a trace of solemnity.

Everyone knew that more than half of the northern land’s invading cultivators had died at Xiao Hai’s hands, and Xiao Hai deeply detested these people.

No one knew what consequences his arrival would bring.

Xiao Hai strode over and coldly said, “This rule seems to be in the interests of most people. To put it bluntly, it’s only in the interests of a few people.”

“Xiao Hai, why are you only here now?”Yong Ji said with a smile.

Xiao Hai ignored him and raised his hand, saying, “I don’t agree with your proposal either.”

Long Qiao said with a gloomy face, “Xiao Hai, you’re too late. You Don’t even have the qualifications to participate!”

“Oh? Since when did you get the chance to interfere in the matters of the Southern Region?”Xiao Hai’s tone was extremely cold, causing people to shiver involuntarily.

At this time, someone came out to smooth things over. “Mr. Xiao Hai, this matter is beneficial to everyone. Why should we reject it? Do you want the people at the border to continue suffering?”

“That’s right. Why would we reject such a win-win situation?”

Xiao Hai glanced at them, he said, “You want to negotiate, right? “Sure, I’ve done the calculations. All these years, the north has killed a total of 3,280,012,31 people at the southern border. If you want to negotiate, there’s no problem. Just let me kill the same number of people in the north first.”

When everyone heard this, they were all shocked!

This Xiao Hai actually remembered the number of people in such detail?

More than three million people? This number probably exceeded the total number of people in the northern land!

“Xiao Hai, you’re deliberately making things difficult for us!”Long Qiao said angrily.

Xiao Hai sneered and said, “If you can’t do it, then scram back to the northern land.”

“Xiao Hai, don’t go too far. Do you think that you alone can decide all of our proposals?”At this moment, the first elder suddenly said.

Xiao Hai immediately looked in the direction of the first elder and said with a dark face, “Can you represent the Tianyun Sect?”

“That’s right. Since the sect master is not here, I will be in charge of the Tianyun sect!”The first elder said with a slightly smug expression.

When Xiao Hai heard this, he could not help but say coldly, “Then your sect master really made a stupid decision to find a fool like you.”

“You!”First Elder was instantly furious. However, he was no match for Xiao Hai, so he could only endure his anger.

Yong ji smiled and said, “Everyone, don’t be anxious. Everything can be discussed.”

“There’s nothing to discuss. I will kill every single person from the northern lands.”Xiao Hai said.

“Of course, if you people are willing to get close to the people from the northern lands, I don’t mind killing all of you together.”

When these words were said, everyone was shocked!

How arrogant was this?

One had to know that these people also included the three maniacs, Baro, and Feng Hai! As well as the top-notch martial artist of the Southern Region! Among them, there was also the Heavenly Cloud sect!

Xiao Hai’s words were too arrogant!

“Xiao Hai, don’t go too far!”Someone said angrily.

Xiao Hai looked at him coldly and said, “If you are not satisfied, you can come out and fight. I Don’t mind sending you off in advance.”

The other party immediately shut up and did not dare to say another word.

“Xiao Hai, do you really want to go against the northern lands?”Long Qiao said coldly.

Xiao Hai laughed loudly and said, “Are you stupid? Isn’t what I did obvious enough?”

“You!”Long Qiao clenched his teeth. This Xiao Hai was clearly impervious to oil and salt!

“Xiao Hai, let me tell you. It’s useless for you to obstruct me alone. The southern region and the northern lands are getting closer and closer. At that time, no one will be able to stop the northern lands!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“At the same time, let me tell you! If you accept my proposal now, you will still be able to obtain the Sacred Heart Technique. When the southern region and the northern lands are completely merged, you will not be able to obtain anything!”

Xiao Hai laughed out loud and said, “I’m not interested in your Bullsh * t absolute arts!”

Long Qiao said with a gloomy face, “Xiao Hai, just you wait. You will definitely pay the price for this.”

Not only long Qiao, but the expression of the first elder was also extremely gloomy.

Long Qiao looked at Yong Ji and said, “Since you don’t agree, then I will take my leave.”

After saying that, Long Qiao turned around and was about to leave.

“Stop.”At this time, Xiao Hai suddenly shouted at Long Qiao.

Long Qiao stopped and said coldly, “Why? Do you still have something to do?”

Xiao Hai said coldly, “It seems that you didn’t hear clearly what I said just now. I said, if I see anyone from the northern lands, I will kill them!”

Long Qiao’s expression immediately changed! He said with some panic, “Xiao Hai, don’t go too far! Don’t you understand that two countries don’t kill their envoys when they are fighting? !”

“That’s right, Mr. Xiao Hai. Mr. Long Qiao is here to negotiate. It doesn’t make sense to kill him,”the people around also said.

“Even if you don’t agree, you should let long Qiao leave. If we attack like this, won’t we let others poke at our spine?”

For a moment, everyone pointed their spears at Xiao Hai.

Xiao Hai waved his hand and berated, “A bunch of noisy things, Shut Up!”

A loud shout immediately shook everyone’s ears. Some of them even had their eardrums shattered and they were bleeding non-stop.
