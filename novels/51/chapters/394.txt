“Kill people?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

This surprised him a little.

All along, Fang Yue seemed to have a good temper.

She had never seen such a cold attitude like today.

“Tell me, who should I kill?” Qin Yu nodded and said.

Fang Yue said in a deep voice, “The first one is Jing Shihong. The second one is Bi Guocang. These two will go to the battlefield today.”

“Jing Shihong... Jing Lu’s father?” Qin Yu guessed.

Fang Yue asked in surprise, “How did you know?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I guessed. By the way... Why do you want to kill the two of them?”

Fang Yue didn’t answer.

However, her expression was a bit ugly.

Qin Yu guessed that it would be difficult to talk about this matter, so he changed the topic and asked, “What are their cultivation levels?”

Fang Yue glanced at Qin Yu and said, “They have been at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm for many years. They are very strong and are quite famous in the Central Plains.”

“Peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm...” Qin Yu touched his chin.

Updates by

With Qin Yu’s current cultivation, it would be quite difficult for him to deal with two peak Inner Strength Grandmaster realms in a short period of time.

Once a big fight broke out, his target would probably be exposed.

“I promise you.” After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally nodded and agreed.

Fang Yue took a deep breath, cupped her hands and said, “Then thank you, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I should be thanking you.”

Although Qin Yu didn’t know what had happened, from Fang Yue’s expression, it was likely that there was some deep hatred.

“By the way, this hat... can’t you change the color?” Qin Yu scratched his head.

A green hat on his head was really quite eye-catching.

Fang Yue snickered and said, “No.”

“Mr. Qin, why do you care so much? Many young people nowadays don’t care about this at all.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “The main thing is that it’s too eye-catching...”

Fang Yue spread her hands and said, “I have no choice. If it really doesn’t work, you don’t have to wear it.”

“I’ll just wear it,” Qin Yu muttered.

He put the hat on the ground. He looked quite handsome with it on.

“By the way, why don’t you participate?” Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue and asked.

Fang Yue sighed and said, “I’m only an Inner Strength Past Master. I don’t have your boldness. If I really go, I’m afraid not only will I not get anything, but I’ll also be in danger.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Miss Fang, don’t be modest. You’re definitely not as simple as you seem.”

Fang Yue pretended to be terrified and said, “Mr. Qin, you can’t say that. I’m just a weak woman...”

Qin Yu didn’t continue to joke with Fang Yue. Time was tight. After saying goodbye, he hailed a cab and rushed to the provincial capital.

The few of them arrived at the provincial capital.

“Qin Yu, I’ll go with you,” said Taozi.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “If you go, I’ll be exposed. Wait for me at the hotel obediently.”

Then, Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue and said, “Miss Fang, I’ll leave the two of them to you.”

Fang Yue bowed and said, “Don’t worry, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and didn’t say anything more. He drove to the battlefield.

At this moment, the village’s separation line had already been withdrawn. The aristocratic families from all over the world had been waiting for them for a long time.

Other than the aristocratic families, there were also some top-notch artists who had arrived at the scene.

This was enough to prove the importance of this battle.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown as he felt the internal qi around him.

He originally thought that there would be countless people who would come here today. However, he never expected that there would only be a dozen people at a glance.

These people were all at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm! There wasn’t even an ordinary Inner Strength Grandmaster!

Qin Yu was the only one who was in the Inner Strength Past Master realm!

“No wonder Fang Yue didn’t come.” Qin Yu stuck out his tongue and thought to himself that things weren’t looking good.

The hat on his head was already particularly eye-catching, so with such a low realm level, he looked even more out of place.

As expected, the moment Qin Yu appeared, everyone looked over.

“Oh really? A Inner Strength Grandmaster dares to come?” Someone frowned.

“He even wore a green hat. Is there something wrong with his head?”

“A mere ant dares to covet the treasure?”

For a moment, more than ten people looked in Qin Yu’s direction!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

What he was afraid of came true!

Very quickly, this group of people walked towards Qin Yu.

“Who told you to come?” An old man with white hair asked coldly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “This place doesn’t seem to belong to anyone. Why can’t I come?”

“Hmph, you think you can get a share of the treasure? You’re overestimating yourself!” Someone berated coldly.

“One must know one’s limits. If you’re too greedy, it will get you killed!”

“In order to prevent this kid from taking advantage of other people, we might as well kill him first.”

As they spoke, a strong murderous aura burst out from the bodies of these ten plus Inner Strength Grandmasters.

“Oh no.” Qin Yu’s expression changed.

Qin Yu didn’t have the slightest chance to resist against these ten plus peak Inner Strength Grandmasters!

“Looks like we have to retreat now.” Qin Yu thought to himself. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just as he was about to use the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, a sound suddenly came from the side.

“Ants have their purposes too. This battlefield is full of danger. It’s better to leave him behind and use him to explore the way,” a middle-aged man said.

Everyone turned to look at the middle-aged man.

The crowd fell into a short silence. Everyone seemed to be weighing the pros and cons.

“Mr. Jing is right.” Finally, someone agreed with him.

Mr. Jing?

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Could this person be Jing Shihong?

“Yes, the dark energy here is rampant and full of danger. You might die from a moment of carelessness. Using it to explore the way is the best choice.”

“I agree with Mr. Jing’s suggestion.”

Jing Shihong immediately looked at Qin Yu and said, “Kid, if you don’t want to die, then listen to us obediently and work for us. If you’re lucky enough to survive, you might be able to obtain an opportunity.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “I’ll definitely listen to everyone’s arrangements...”

Although he said that, inside, he cursed them all.

After that, these people no longer paid any attention to Qin Yu. Instead, they stood there and started chatting.

Based on their conversation, Qin Yu learned the identities of these people.

Other than Jing Shihong and Bi Haicang, who Fang Yue wanted to get rid of, the rest of them were all family heads from the top aristocratic families in the Central Plains!

In the Central Plains, they were almost all big shots who reigned over a region. In terms of martial arts, business, and other aspects, they all had extremely strong power!

“This group of people... might be of use to me.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and thought to himself.

At this moment, a car slowly drove over from not far away.

After the car stopped, a young man dressed elegantly got down from the car.

When they saw this young man, everyone immediately went forward to welcome him.

“Young Master Yan, you are here. We have been waiting for you for a long time.”

This person was none other than the son of Yan Tianhong, Yan Haoran! He was also Yan Ruoxue’s cousin!

There was a gallant air to Yan Haoran. He nodded to everyone one by one and said, “My uncle said that since everyone is willing to work for the Yan family, the Yan family won’t mistreat you guys.”

When everyone heard this, they hurriedly said, “Gee, it’s our honor to be able to work for the Yan family!”

Yan Haoran nodded slightly and said, “The Yan family will unify all the big and small families in the northern martial arts world as soon as possible. At that time, all of you will be the first ministers.”

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed!

The Yan family actually planned to unify all the big and small martial arts families in the northern martial arts world?
