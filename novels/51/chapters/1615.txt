Chapter 1616: Chapter 1616 was indeed fake! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Now that he was exposed in front of Wen Wanji, his anger reached its peak.

He was emitting a strong killing intent. He glared at Wen Wanji and said, “Old man, don’t worry. I’ll kill you soon!”

“I think you’d better think about how to escape,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Both sides were at daggers drawn, as if they were ready to attack at any time.

At this moment, Kong you stepped out to smooth things over, “Don’t worry, everyone. It’s just a misunderstanding!”

After saying that, Kong you looked at Qin Yu and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, come with me.”

Qin Yu didn’t know this guy, but he still followed him to the side.

Because of Qin Yu’s arrival, the situation at the scene changed again, and the crisis of the “Fake sect master”was temporarily alleviated.

Kong you pulled Qin Yu to the side and said, “Qin Yu, Yongji has just agreed to negotiate peace. What do you mean by suddenly standing out? Isn’t this destroying our hard-won peace?”

Qin Yu glanced at Kong you and sneered, “What nonsense are you talking about? Yongji will negotiate peace with you? Are you still asleep?”

Upon hearing that, Kong you also said with extreme displeasure, “Qin Yu, how do you know that Yongji won’t negotiate peace? When Yongji declared war on you, you found a place to hide and didn’t even dare to show your face. Now, what kind of hero are you pretending to be?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said with a cold face, “Where did you come from, you bastard? What nonsense are you talking about?”

Kong you didn’t want to be outdone. He stared at him and said, “I’m the famous lobbyist of the South Province, Kong you!”

“You’d better shut your dog mouth. Otherwise, I don’t mind giving you a head start,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Kong you sneered and said, “What? You Don’t dare to attack Yongji and vent your anger on me?”

“For the sake of peace in the South Province, I put down my face and begged Yongji. At the very least, I have contributed to the South Province. What about you? Now, other than ruining good things, what else can you do?”Kong you pointed at Qin Yu and shouted.

Qin Yu knew that he couldn’t make sense of Kong you no matter what, so he simply retreated to the side and sneered, “Well, I want to see what use you, the so-called lobbyist, have.”

After saying that, Qin Yu found a place to sit down.

“Just wait and see.”Kong you snorted lightly.

Then, he quickly walked in the direction of Yongji.

A few minutes later, Kong you walked over proudly again.

He pretended to sigh and said, “Sigh, fortunately, I went to Yongji in time to explain the situation. Otherwise, this war would be inevitable!”

Looking at his behavior, Qin Yu sneered.

The saddest thing about people was that they were stupid and didn’t know it. The saddest thing was that such people were everywhere.

“Master.”

At this time, Di Zun walked over quickly.

He was beside Qin Yu and whispered, “Master, you came back at the right time.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but glance at the eighteen gods not far away, and then whispered, “That’s not the sect master of the Tianyun sect, right?”

Di Zun smiled bitterly and nodded, “Sigh, I have no choice.”

Qin Yu continued, “He is... The eighteen gods in disguise?”

Di Zun immediately gave Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “It still has to be Master! He saw through it with one look!”

Qin Yu said helplessly, “Seeing this scene, I can’t help but think of someone.”

“Yao Qing, right?”Di Zun said with a smile. “To be honest, I’m imitating him.”

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he heard that.

“Speaking of which, I really miss him...”Qin Yu sighed.

Yao Qing was Qin Yu’s first true follower, and he had accompanied Qin Yu through countless battles, big and small.

The two of them had not seen each other for a long time, and they wondered how their old friends were doing.

“Forget it, let’s not talk about this anymore.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Master, are you confident in dealing with Yongji?”Di Zun asked in a deep voice.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “It’s hard to say, but it’s probably not a problem.”

Di Zun said in a deep voice, “I think Yongji would not dare to act rashly. He is very afraid of the sect master.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. In the entire southern province, there seemed to be no one who wasn’t afraid of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Of course, there were exceptions, such as Wen Wanyi and Jue Wu.

“Alright, leave the rest to me.”Qin Yu patted Di Zun’s shoulder.

Then, he looked at Yong Ji who was not far away.

And coincidentally, Yong Ji also looked at Qin Yu.

Their eyes met, and a killing intent came quietly.

Yongji glared at Qin Yu, and his teeth clenched.

If he was not afraid of the “Sect master of the Tianyun sect,”he would have attacked long ago.

“You all saw it, right? Yongji’s original intention was to negotiate.”Not far away, Kong you was still bragging about his contributions.

And in front of him, Yongji had already set his eyes on the eighteen gods.

He was extremely conflicted, but he didn’t dare to casually make a move.

At this moment, a voice entered Yong Ji’s mind.

“That sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is fake. He’s one of the eighteen gods of the Heavenly Cloud sect. There’s no need to be afraid.”

Yong Ji was stunned. This voice was actually Sima Bei’s!

“Lord Sima Bei, where are you?”Yong Ji hurriedly asked.

Sima bei said coldly, “I’m nearby. The moment things change, I’ll immediately act.”

“Other than me, there are many cultivators waiting nearby in the north. You can go as boldly as you want.”

With Sima Bei’s words, Yong Ji’s heart was instantly filled with courage.

He looked in the direction of the eighteen gods and shouted once again, “Invite the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect to come and have a chat!”

The eighteen celestials remained silent as usual.

Yong ji sneered, “I think you are a fake sect master.”

As soon as he said this, Di ZUN’s expression changed drastically!

He hurriedly shouted, “Yong Ji, what do you mean! You Dare to insult our sect master!”

Yong ji said coldly, “If he really is the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, then remove the mist on his face for me. What, he doesn’t dare to see anyone!”

Di Zun’s expression turned extremely ugly. He knew very well that this scene could not be continued.

“You are not the sect master of the Tianyun sect at all. You are deceiving us!”Yong Ji continued to shout loudly.

His feet shook, and in an instant, he arrived in front of the eighteen gods.

“You are just a pile of dog shit,”Yong Ji said coldly.

However, the “Sect master”in front of him still did not react.

Seeing this scene, Yong Ji laughed loudly and said, “It is indeed fake! You are indeed the eighteen gods in disguise! Why? You are a fool if you can’t get the Order!”

Di ZUN’s expression changed greatly, and he hurriedly pulled the eighteen gods to the side.

At this time, Kong you hurriedly stood out. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He ran in front of Yong Ji and said with a smile, “Mr. Yong Ji, although he is not the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect, Di Zun can represent the sect master to negotiate with you. Moreover, there are so many people present, everyone can make the decision!”
