Chapter 1369: Chapter 1369, Simple Wen da Wen 21

“What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask.

The two of them shook their heads and then smiled. “Nothing. As long as Grandpa is fine, we can rest assured.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “We can’t stay in Dayue City anymore. The Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely send a large number of people to find us.”

However, Wen da didn’t think so. He patted his chest and said, “We two brothers have been in Dayue city for so many years. How can we stay here for nothing? Don’t worry. I, Wen Da, have a lot of friends here. I have even more good brothers!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and shook her head. “I think it’s better not to. They may have been your friends back then, but it’s hard to say now.”

Li Yingying’s attitude explained everything.

But Wen da didn’t care. He hammered Qin Yu’s chest and said, “Don’t believe in Brother’s personal charm? Don’t worry, he will definitely not betray me.”

“That’s right, that’s right. His relationship with us back then was just like yours now,”Wen er also said.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only sigh.

Wen Da Wen er was simple-minded and had never experienced any setbacks.

Therefore, no matter what Qin Yu said, they would not believe it.

“I hope they won’t sell their owners for Glory,”Qin Yu thought.

Then, Wen Da and Wen Er brought Qin Yu to a wealthy family in dayue city.

About half an hour later, the three of them stopped at the gate of a courtyard.

The first thing that came into their sight was the magnificent gate, on which two words were carved: Sun family.

“This is the place,”Wen da said.

He pulled his hat and then patted the gate of the Zhao family.

Soon, the servant came out.

The servant looked at the three of them and said, “Who are you looking for?”

“I’m Looking for Sun Zhong. You tell him that his best friend is looking for him,”Wen da said casually.

“Is it convenient for you to tell me your name?”The servant asked.

Wen da glared and said, “Tell me your name. Do what I tell you to do. Don’t talk nonsense!”

The servant didn’t know Wen Da’s identity, so he didn’t dare to say anything. He quickly agreed, “Then please wait a moment. I’ll go and inform him.”

A few minutes later, a young man in beautiful clothes walked out of the courtyard.

This person was the sun zhong that Wen da had mentioned.

Sun Zhong walked in front of Wen Da. He sized him up and asked, “You are?”

Wen da hurriedly whispered into sun zhong’s ear, “I am Wen Da.”

Hearing this, Sun Zhong’s expression changed drastically!

He hurriedly covered Wen Da’s mouth and then looked at the servant beside him.

“You can go down first,”Sun Zhong said indifferently.

“Yes, Young Master.”The servant bowed and then retreated.

It was not until he walked far away that Sun Zhong said in a panic, “Wen Da, why are you here? Don’t you know that the Tianyun sect is looking for you now?”

Wen Da rolled his eyes and said, “That’s why I came to find you. I asked you to find a hiding place for us. How is it? Is It Okay?”

Sun zhong nodded and said, “That’s not a problem. Come with me.”

After saying that, Sun Zhong took the lead and walked into the courtyard.

Wen Da proudly waved at Qin Yu and said, “How is it? Am I right?”

Qin Yu grunted and did not say anything. However, deep down, he was still worried about Sun Zhong.

Sun Zhong brought the three of them to a room in the depths of the courtyard.

“You guys can stay here for now,”Sun Zhong said. “I’ll try to make some connections in the next few days. I’ll send you out in a few days.”

“Okay, you can go.”Wen Da waved his hand.

Sun Zhong hummed in gratitude and then walked out.

Qin Yu glanced at the room and couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Something’s wrong,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“What’s Wrong?”Wen Da lay on the bed and said with a relaxed expression.

Qin Yu pointed at the room and said, “This room is too clean. Obviously, someone has lived in it before.”

“What’s wrong with that?”Wen Da asked, puzzled.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Think about it. If he was a Tibetan, he would definitely find us an abandoned room. Why would he find a room with people living in it?”

Wen Da waved his hand impatiently and said, “Aren’t you a little too vigilant? Why? Can’t I, Wen Da, make a decent friend?”

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t say anything more and could only stay for the time being.

In the evening, Sun Zhong brought food and two pots of wine.

After he entered, he quickly closed the door.

“Brother, how’s the situation outside?”Wen Da jumped up from the bed and asked.

Sun Zhong said with a solemn face, “Very bad. It’s said that old man Wen has already run away. The tianyun sect will most likely exterminate him.”

At this point, Sun Zhong’s gaze fell on Qin Yu.

“If I’m not wrong, this should be brother Qin Yu, Brother Qin,”Sun Zhong said.

Qin Yu cupped her hands toward him and said, “Greetings, Brother Sun.”

Sun Zhong gave Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “Brother Qin is really young and promising. Such achievements make us ashamed.”

“Don’t say such polite words. We are all brothers. Come, quickly sit down,”Wen da pulled Sun Zhong and said.

Sun Zhong grunted in gratitude. He opened the dishes and poured four glasses of wine.

“Since the three of you have come to my sun family, it means that you think highly of me. You can stay here peacefully. When the limelight passes, I will think of a way,”Sun Zhong said as he raised his glass.

Qin Yu also raised his cup and said, “Then thank you very much.”

With that, the four of them raised their cups and drank together.

After drinking the fine wine, the four of them ate and chatted happily.

But at this moment, Wen da suddenly frowned.

“What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Wen Da waved his hand and said, “Maybe this wine is too strong, and it’s a little intoxicating.”

“I’m also a little intoxicated. Maybe I haven’t drunk for too long, and I’m a Little Dizzy,”Wen er said.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he subconsciously looked at Sun Zhong.

He saw that Sun Zhong was indifferent, and no expression could be seen on his face.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and immediately rubbed his head, pretending to say, “Oh no, I’m also a little dizzy...”

Hearing this, Sun Zhong finally raised his head.

He put down the chopsticks in his hand and said with a faint smile, “It’s good that you feel dizzy. This wine has been drugged. It can make you sleep for an entire day.”

“What do you mean?”Wen Da’s expression was a little ugly.

Sun zhong sneered and said, “Wen Wanyi has already run away. Who would take a fancy to you two good-for-nothings? Do you really think that I, Sun Zhong, will offend the Tianyun sect for the sake of you two good-for-nothings?”
