Mo Rong was even more surprised when he heard Qin Yu’s words.

He sized up Qin Yu and said in a strange tone, “Do you really take it seriously?”

Qin Yu snorted coldly and couldn’t be bothered with Mo Rong at all.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Fang Fang and the others and said, “Follow me closely later.”

Fang Fang said in a deep voice, “It’s better for you to follow me closely.”

Qin Yu didn’t explain much, and he didn’t say anything unnecessary. He just stood at the side, waiting for Mo Rong and the others to set off.

“What? Aren’t you going to hunt the flying spiders? What are you waiting for?”Mo Rong sneered when he saw Qin Yu and the others not leaving.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “It’s none of your business whether we leave or not.”

Mo Rong narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Kid, you have repeatedly disrespected me. I’m afraid you are courting death.”

The person beside him also said with a dark face, “Young master Mo, who is this kid? How dare he be so rude to you?”

Mo Rong sneered, “He’s an idiot.”

A girl stood beside Mo Rong. He looked at that girl and said with a faint smile, “Of course, I won’t lower myself to the level of an ant like him.”

That girl didn’t say anything. She just frowned slightly.

“Well, it’s about time. Let’s go.”Mo Rong stretched.

“After we kill the flying spider, we can sell it for a good price,”someone said.

Mo Rong sneered, “Sell it for money? Is My Young Master Mo Short of money? Your Horizons are too low.”

“If I can get the life qi, I can use it to exchange for the heavenly materials and earthly treasures the guild wants.”

Hearing their words, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

Exchange Guild? What kind of place was that? Why had he never heard of it before?

“I’ll have to investigate it when I have time,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The Southern Prefecture was so big. There were many places that Qin Yu did not know about. What he saw was only the tip of the iceberg.

“Brat, you better follow behind us properly,”Mo Rong mocked Qin Yu and the others. Then, he led everyone deeper into the city.

“Let’s go.”Qin Yu looked at Fangya.

Fangya frowned and said, “Are we really going to follow them?”

“That’s right. Not only do we have to follow them, but we also don’t have to make a move. We just have to watch from the side.”Qin Yu said coldly.

Fangya asked in puzzlement, “Why do we have to do this?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “You’ll know in a while. Follow me.”

With that said, Qin Yu took the lead and walked forward.

Although Fang and the others were puzzled, they still followed Qin Yu’s request and walked forward.

Qin Yu activated his desolate god eye and clearly saw the huge flying spider.

Qin Yu had experienced the strength of this flying spider. Although it was not extremely powerful, its strength was definitely not to be underestimated. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

With Mo Rong and the others’strength, it would not be easy to easily take down this flying spider.

As the group approached the flying spider, The flying spider seemed to have sensed Mo Rong and the others’arrival.

A strong killing intent was emitted from its body. This killing intent seemed to be warning everyone to leave.

Mo Rong felt this killing intent. With a shake of his palm, the sword fell into his hand.

He used this sword to snatch the spoils of war that belonged to Fang.

“Everyone, don’t be nervous. A mere flying spider isn’t even worth mentioning,”Mo Rong said in a deep voice.

Since he was ranked in the top ten of the younger generation, he naturally had some ability.

There was a hint of nervousness on the group’s faces.

Seeing that they were getting closer and closer to the flying spider, the vigilance on the flying spider grew stronger.

“Hiss!”

At this moment, the flying spider moved. It shot out spider silk at an extremely fast speed!

Mo Rong snorted. He held the sword in his hand and swung it forward, instantly cutting the spider silk in half!

“Swoosh!”

The flying spider aimed at Mo Rong and instantly arrived in front of Mo Rong.

The battle was about to start. Mo Rong’s strength was not to be underestimated. He slashed forward with the sword in his hand. The bright light shook the sky and Earth, as if it wanted to split the entire green rock forest into two.

The flying spider naturally would not sit still and wait for death. Although its body was huge, it was extremely agile. It had dodged Mo Rong’s attacks many times and could even counterattack many times.

“Bang!”

At this moment, the flying spider spat out an extremely fine spider web, instantly forcing Mo Rong back.

Mo Rong’s body was continuously pushed back hundreds of meters, smashing countless rocks and trees.

“Young Master Mo!”Everyone cried out in surprise.

At this moment, Mo Rong dashed out again.

He grabbed his sword with both hands and slashed at the flying spider!

“Swoosh!”

The flying spider spat out spider silk from its mouth and wrapped around Mo Rong’s wrist!

Mo Rong’s expression changed. He tried to struggle, but found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“What are you all waiting for? Let’s attack together!”Mo Rong shouted hurriedly.

The people around him finally came back to their senses. They all cast their spells and rushed toward the flying spider.

Qin Yu sneered at the side.

Everything was as he had expected. Mo Rong wanted to kill the flying spider, but it was not that simple.

“Yu Qin, should we attack?”Fang Fang asked from the side.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No need. We Can Wait.”
