Chapter 1264: Chapter 1,264, Qingyan Forest 

Master Meng seemed to like this kind of vanity that was the focus of attention. Seeing that Qin Yu did not have any reaction, he walked to the next table and continued to brag.

“You all know about my Meng family, right? That is a great aristocratic family that is known to have tens of millions of spiritual power!”Master Meng kept on bragging.

“There are eight demonic beasts like this in my family! Just my family’s manor, in our entire city... Oh No, in the entire South Province, it can be counted with one’s fingers!”

Qin Yu secretly glanced at this Lord Meng. As he stood up, he muttered, “Doesn’t this person know what it means to not leak money?”

Following that, Qin Yu placed the money on the table and walked out of the door.

When that Lord Meng saw that Qin Yu was planning to leave, he shouted, “Are you leaving already? I’ll let you touch my seven-colored divine Phoenix later.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “No need, I’ll get one later too.”

“You Get One? Your Ass. Where did you get the money from?”Lord Meng muttered.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to him. He turned around and walked out of the restaurant, coming all the way to the seven-colored divine Phoenix’s side.

He saw the glazed lock on the seven-colored divine Phoenix’s neck shining.

Under the binding of the glazed lock, the seven-colored divine Phoenix became extremely obedient.

“It’s really a pretty good exotic beast.”Qin Yu touched the smooth fur on its body and muttered softly.

Then, Qin Yu stretched out his hand and placed it on the glazed lock.

The moment he touched it, the glazed lock immediately produced a counterforce.

However, this force was nothing in front of Qin Yu.

“I’m afraid this lock can only be opened by a special spell or a secret key,”Qin Yu thought in a low voice.

“Unfortunately, I don’t have a secret key, so I can only open the lock by force.”

With that, the divine power in Qin Yu’s hand surged, and he grabbed the glazed lock fiercely.

Meanwhile, in the restaurant, Lord Meng was still bragging.

“Lord Meng, that seven-colored divine phoenix is so valuable. Aren’t you afraid of losing it if you throw it outside the door?”Someone beside him asked.

Lord Meng patted his chest and said proudly, “A good horse with a good saddle. Even my father can’t open the glazed lock on my seven-colored divine Phoenix’s neck! It cost a whole ten thousand spirit energy to buy! Who can take it away?”

“Master Meng Is Awesome!”The person next to him immediately boasted.

“Master Meng, there is a seven-colored divine phoenix outside that is exactly the same as your mount! Look, it’s flying!”

“Right, damn, it’s too similar, master Meng!”

“Oh? Let me take a look.”Master Meng raised his eyebrows and turned around.

He saw a seven-colored divine phoenix spreading its arms and flapping its wings to fly away.

“Grandpa Meng, Don’t you think it’s similar to yours?”

Grandpa Meng’s face turned black as he cursed, “That’s my F * cking seven-colored divine Phoenix! Kid, Hurry up and come down!”

Qin Yu waved at Grandpa Meng and said, “How is it? Did I get one too?”

“You F * CKING Fool Your Grandpa! Come Down for me!”

However, how could Qin Yu Pay attention to him? He sat on the back of the seven-colored divine Phoenix and flew up to the nine heavens.

However, this seven-colored divine Phoenix was snatched by Qin Yu after all, so how could it listen to Qin Yu’s orders.

Its huge body kept spinning in the sky.

Qin Yu patted his head and said, “Little Guy, I was the one who opened the glass lock on your neck. Shouldn’t you beat me up? Hurry up and send me to Qingyan Forest.”

However, this seven-colored divine Phoenix didn’t seem to understand him. It continued to spin in the sky.

“As long as you send me to the Green Rock Forest, I will give you your freedom. How about it?”Qin Yu continued to guide it patiently.

However, the seven-colored divine Phoenix still ignored Qin Yu.

“F * ck.”Qin Yu immediately lost his patience. He raised his palm and a huge force instantly pressed on the seven-colored divine Phoenix’s head.

“Hurry up and send me to the Green Rock Forest. Otherwise, I will smash your head right now.”Qin Yu’s body emitted a cold killing intent.

After feeling the power in Qin Yu’s hand, the seven-colored divine Phoenix immediately rushed towards the green rock forest.

“Damn, he’s really a beast.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

Although that Lord Meng loved to show off, he was right. This seven-colored divine Phoenix was indeed fast.

With the support of the seven-colored Divine Phoenix, Qin Yu’s speed increased by a lot.

Not only that, Qin Yu could also use the time on the road to comprehend the fighting word formula.

After flying for two days and two nights, the seven-colored divine Phoenix finally arrived near the Green Rock Forest.

The seven-colored divine Phoenix seemed to know about the hunter organization, and actually stopped at the side of the Hunter organization.

This organization was not as big as imagined, only seven or eight houses of various sizes.

Resources could be seen everywhere at the entrance of the houses, as well as demon beasts that had been killed.

Other than that, there were also many strong men walking around the entrance. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

They seemed to be hunters that had returned from the expedition. Every one of them was stained with fresh blood.

The seven-colored divine Phoenix landed nearby. Its huge body immediately attracted the attention of countless people.

Qin Yu walked down from the seven-colored divine Phoenix. He patted the seven-colored divine Phoenix’s neck and said, “Alright, you are free now.”

The seven-colored divine Phoenix did not hesitate at all. It waved its arm and disappeared without a trace.

Then, Qin Yu walked toward the hunter organization.

At the entrance of a house, there was a small table.

This was the registration office of the Hunter organization. The person in charge of registration was a young man. The Young Man’s face was full of unruly arrogance. On his face, there was an eye-catching scar.

Qin Yu walked over quickly and said, “I’m here to register.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the young man glanced at Qin Yu and snorted coldly, “Another young master who came to throw his life away.”

“Kid, let me tell you, every Hunter is born bathed in fresh blood. They are not here for you to play House.”A strong man walked over and said.

Qin Yu was stunned and quickly reacted.

It must be that seven-colored divine phoenix that made them misunderstand their identity.

Therefore, Qin Yu explained, “I snatched that seven-colored divine Phoenix. It’s just convenient for me to travel. I have long looked forward to the hunter organization.”

“Oh?”The young man slowly stood up. He took out a stone that was shining with light and said, “Put your hand on it.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Another testing divine stone? Can you not test this thing?”

“It’s fine even if you don’t test it.”The youth sneered. “You can also choose to kill a Demon Beast at the mighty realm to prove yourself.”

Qin Yu didn’t even think before agreeing.

“A Demon Beast at the Mighty Realm, right? Alright, wait for me here for a few minutes.”Qin Yu said.

After saying this, Qin Yu walked towards the pitch-black green rock forest.

“Another rich young master who wants to come here for training. I hate people like him the most in my life,”said the youth with a cold snort.

“That’s right. Those pampered young masters don’t know the dangers of green rock forest at all. They really treat this place as a training ground,”said a brawny man with his arms crossed.

“Speaking of which, that Kid entered the green rock forest by himself. He won’t die inside, right?”

“He deserves to die. People like him deserve to die as well,”the young man said with a cold snort.

At this moment, the cries of birds and beasts rang out in the mountain forest. The mountain rocks crumbled and large trees collapsed one after another.

Not long after, Qin Yu dragged a huge demonic beast out of the green rock forest slowly.
