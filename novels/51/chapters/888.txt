Chapter 889: Chapter 889, stepping into the mystic realm 

Besides the Wan Gu Qiong and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, several other Mystic Realms had also sent out martial saints.

Although their strength could not compare to the JINGDU martial arts association, but Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline was too alluring, so they also planned to give it their all.

The entire world was gloomy, as if a great battle was brewing.

At this moment, Qin Yu was desperately driving towards the medicine God Pavilion.

After a long time, Qin Yu finally arrived at the Medicine God Pavilion.

He held the pavilion master’s hand and turned around to leave.

However, the pavilion master stopped and said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, what are you doing?”

Qin Yu said anxiously, “Leave quickly. A martial saint has appeared. You must follow me to the secret realm to hide!”

“Hide?”The Pavilion Master could not help but laugh.

“Why should I hide?”

Qin Yu said anxiously, “If they can’t find me, they will definitely come looking for you! I Can’t watch you get into trouble!”

When the pavilion master heard this, the smile on her face became even wider.

She broke free from Qin Yu’s hand and then swept her gaze across the huge medicine God Pavilion. She said, “If I leave, what will happen to the Medicine God Pavilion? What will happen to the many pharmacists who trust me?”

Qin Yu was instantly stunned on the spot.

That’s right. If the pavilion master wasn’t around, the Divine Medicine Pavilion would be disbanded.

“People have responsibilities to live,”the pavilion master said quietly.

Qin Yu immediately calmed down.

He looked at the pavilion master and frowned. “Then what will happen to You?”

The pavilion master said indifferently, “Don’t worry. I will be fine. They are looking for you, not me.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and wanted to say something. However, the pavilion master waved his hand and said, “Don’t waste any more time. Otherwise, it’ll be too late.”

Time was of the essence, so Qin Yu naturally knew.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Pavilion Master, then you have to be careful.”

After he had finished speaking, Qin Yu returned to the car and turned around to rush back.

On the way back, Qin Yu felt extremely uncomfortable.

The time the Martial Saint had appeared had far exceeded Qin Yu’s expectations.

This also caused Qin Yu to be unable to settle the people around him in time.

Besides the pavilion master, there were also many people from the Jade Moon Villa.

Li Yu, who was at the side, seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s pain. He said indifferently, “Those who achieve great things don’t care about trifles. Moreover, it’s impossible for you to bring everyone to the mystic realm. That would arouse suspicion.”

When he heard these words, Qin Yu could not help but mutter in a low voice, “I’m sorry...”

At this moment, he indeed had no way to care about others.

Against a martial saint, Qin Yu had no chance of winning at all.

Along the way, Qin Yu restrained his internal Qi and rushed towards the secret territory.

Li Yu, on the other hand, sensed the internal Qi around him with his crystal body.

The internal Qi of a martial saint was extremely powerful. It would be very easy for him to be discovered.

There were no dangers along the way. When Qin Yu and Li Yu rushed to the secret realm, they did not encounter any martial saints.

Standing at the entrance of the secret realm, Li Yu said, “I will open the secret realm now.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He looked around and waited for Li Yu’s secret realm to open.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt three powerful internal Qi approaching him!

This feeling was very familiar to Qin Yu. It was the sense of danger emitted from the martial saint’s body!

“Oh no! A martial saint is coming!”Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Li Yu.

“Hurry up, Hurry Up!”Qin Yu urged.

Li Yu remained silent. He slowly opened the secret realm with his eyes closed.

At this moment, three martial saints had already appeared at the entrance of the Jade Moon Villa.

These three people were none other than Zhai Xing and the others sent by the second mystic realm!

Zhai Xing looked at this place coldly and said, “This is Qin Yu’s sect.”

After he finished speaking, Zhai Xing closed his eyes slightly.

He released his powerful spiritual sense and searched for Qin Yu’s figure.

The martial saint’s spiritual sense was incomparably powerful. It was simply too easy to find a person.

“It’s Open! You Go in First!”

Just at this critical moment, Li Yu opened the secret realm!

Qin Yu did not dare to delay any longer and quickly entered the secret realm.

The Moment Qin Yu stepped into the secret realm, his internal Qi also disappeared from this world.

Then, Li Yu followed closely behind and stepped into the secret realm.

The secret realm slowly closed, and everything returned to normal.

Qin Yu panted heavily, and a layer of sweat could not help but form on his forehead.

This feeling of approaching death made Qin Yu’s back feel cold.

“The martial saint’s pressure is too strong.”Qin Yu took a deep breath, and a trace of worry appeared on his face.

“I think they should not have discovered your figure.”Li Yu said from the side.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I hope so.”

Then, Qin Yu looked at the world in front of him.

This mystic realm was much bigger than Qin Yu had imagined. It was not even weaker than the second mystic realm!

The surrounding environment was like a paradise. The Qi/spiritual energy that came from the ground made people feel warm.

Qin Yu had never seen such a rich qi/spiritual energy before!

Looking at the surrounding environment, Qin Yu even suspected that Tao Yuanming’s Paradise was real.

“Phew, what a dense qi/spiritual energy.”Qin Yu opened his arms, feeling extremely comfortable all over his body.

In an environment with dense qi/spiritual energy, People’s functions would improve, and their lifespan would also be extended.

“The Qi/spiritual energy here is indeed extremely dense, but there is a fatal flaw,”Li Yu suddenly said.

“Flaw?”Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Li Yu.

Li Yu grunted and said, “There is a gap in this mystic realm. Although it is very small, it is very likely to invite disaster.”

Speaking up to this point, Li Yu pointed in the direction of the entrance and continued, “The spirit spring nearby was born because of the existence of this gap.”

Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed.

“In other words... this gap might attract the attention of others?”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Li Yu nodded and said, “In theory, that is indeed the case.”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly became extremely ugly.

If that was the case, this mystery land would not be safe either.

“However, don’t worry too much. This gap is very small and it would be very difficult for ordinary people to discover it.”At this moment, Li Yu suddenly changed the topic.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he said in a low voice, “Forget it, let’s take it one step at a time. I will try my best to step into the martial saint realm before I am discovered.”

Then, Qin Yu Strode forward. He released his spiritual sense and searched for Yan Ruoxue’s figure.

...

At this moment, in the outside world.

Zhai Xing and the others did not sense Qin Yu’s internal Qi.

The moment he released his spiritual sense, Qin Yu had entered the secret realm.

“He’s not here.”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“Go and ask the people here.”Zhai Xing ordered.

The martial saint beside him immediately floated up and looked down at the Jade Moon Villa from above. Then, he said indifferently, “Who is the sect master here? Come out and see me.”

His voice was not loud, but it was like a thunderclap that exploded beside his ear!

Everyone was stunned by this voice!

Zhen Yue hurriedly walked out of the hall.

She looked at the martial saint in the air and said in a low voice, “I am the sect master here. May I ask who you are?”

The martial saint didn’t say anything. He only raised his palm slightly, and a terrifying force brought Zhen Yue directly to him! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhen Yue’s body was caught in the air, and a trace of panic flashed across his face.

“Where’s Qin Yu?”The martial saint asked coldly.

Zhen Yue said hurriedly, “I. . . I don’t know. Mr. Qin hasn’t come back for a long time...”

“You don’t Know?”The martial saint narrowed his eyes, and a terrifying sense of oppression immediately rushed over!

His gaze directly pierced through Zhen Yue’s spiritual sense!

This was the strength of a martial saint! In front of a martial saint, one didn’t even have the right to lie!

Zhen Yue only felt his mind go blank, and the world seemed to spin in front of him.

“Where’s Qin Yu?”The martial saint asked again.

Zhen Yue only felt that she was in a trance as if she had been hypnotized. She could not hide what she was thinking.
