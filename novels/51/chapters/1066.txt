Chapter 1067: Chapter 1,067, the descent of the higher-ups? ! 

It was like a divine Phoenix that had descended from the heavens. With a deafening cry, it charged straight at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu was no longer able to dodge. He could only use a punch to break the ten thousand arts to meet it head-on!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s fist struck the Divine Phoenix, but it was of no use. His body was ruthlessly shattered, and pieces of flesh and blood splattered everywhere!

Seeing this scene, everyone was terrified!

As expected of Gu Zizhen! His combat strength was actually so terrifying!

“Looks like Qin Yu is going to lose,”everyone sighed.

“He’s too anxious. If he stepped into another minor realm, he definitely wouldn’t fight Gu Zizhen like this.”

Immortal Crane’s expression was extremely unsightly. He transformed into his true form and shot toward Qin Yu.

The blood rain that filled the sky came from Qin Yu’s body.

This was Gu Zi’s sure-kill technique. It was incomparably terrifying!

But at this moment, Qin Yu’s body was rapidly reassembling!

Threads of blue light emitted from his body, quickly connecting his flesh and blood into one!

This was the power of the Heavenly Tribulation! It was also a technique that Qin Yu had comprehended during the heavenly tribulation. At this moment, it was thoroughly understood!

During the Heavenly Tribulation, Qin Yu’s body was destroyed time and time again, but it was reassembled in the Lightning.

Now, Qin Yu was also relying on the remaining heavenly tribulation to reassemble his physical body!

Looking at Qin Yu who was standing in front of everyone again, Gu Zizhen’s expression instantly became extremely ugly!

“How is this possible...”a trace of anger flashed across his aged face!

At this moment, there was a blue power lingering around Qin Yu’s body, and from time to time, crackling sounds could be heard.

This was the power of the Lightning element, and at this critical moment, it finally came into play!

“The power of lightning...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He tried to clench his fist, and found that the power of lightning was already at his fingertips, just like the spiritual fire!

Qin Yu looked at Gu Zizhen coldly and said, “Gu Zizhen, you have no chance of winning.”

“F * ck you!”Gu Zizhen cursed angrily.

He grabbed his long spear and stood out from the deep pit!

Qin Yu said coldly, “Gu Zizhen! You will definitely die today!”

As he spoke, spiritual fire burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

The Blue Heavenly Tribulation also merged with it.

An extremely destructive and evil power was crazily accumulating!

This power swept through all directions, making everyone feel a little uneasy, as if the end of the world was coming!

“How could I, Gu Zizhen, be afraid of You!”Gu Zizhen roared angrily, as if he was going to fight to the death!

But at this moment, a trace of confusion flashed through his eyes! Then, he grabbed his forehead crazily and howled in pain!

The sudden change made Qin Yu frown.

“Gu Zizhen, what are you doing this time!”Qin Yu said coldly.

However, Gu Zizhen ignored Qin Yu. His eyes were bloodshot as he grabbed his head tightly, looking extremely painful!

“What happened?”No one knew what was happening, and Qin Yu was the same!

“Crash!”

At this moment, rays of light flew out from Gu Zizhen’s mind!

After the Rays of light flew out, they actually exploded in the air!

Following that, Gu Zizhen’s body slightly trembled, and he stood there without moving at all.

“Gu Zizhen!”Qin Yu shouted out explosively. This shout directly pierced through the divine sense, but Gu Zizhen still did not move.

“Take the opportunity to kill him now!”Someone shouted out loudly.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He clenched his fist and quickly rushed towards Gu Zizhen, intending to shatter his primordial spirit at this moment!

But right at this moment, Gu Zizhen moved!

He raised his palm and grabbed Qin Yu’s fist!

Then, he exerted force with his arm and threw Qin Yu Out!

Qin Yu’s body shot out for dozens of meters before he finally stabilized his body!

“HMM? What’s going on?”Qin Yu frowned.

That force just now seemed to be somewhat different from Gu Zizhen’s!

“Swoosh!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Gu Zizhen opened his eyes!

The expression on his face was extremely strange!

“Qin Yu, you’re so capable!”Gu Zizhen said coldly.

He put his hands behind his back, as if he was looking down on an ant.

This kind of natural arrogance was definitely not a forced Act!

“You’re not Gu Zizhen!”Qin Yu realized something.

He looked at Gu Zizhen coldly and said, “Who exactly are you? where is Gu Zizhen?”

“Gu Zizhen”, who was not far away, put his hands behind his back and sneered, “Gu Zizhen is already dead.”

“Dead?”

Everyone was dumbfounded!

What was going on? When did Gu Zizhen die?

If he was dead, who was the person in front of him?

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly. He looked at the person in front of him and seemed to have guessed something.

“You are... the higher-ups of the martial arts association of Jingdu!”Qin Yu suddenly shouted!

This shout entered everyone’s ears!

“Higher-ups? Those eight higher-ups? The True Controller of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu?”

“What on Earth is going on? How did the higher-ups appear in Gu Zizhen’s body?”

Gu Zizhen, who was not far away, also laughed out loud. “That’s right. You’re very smart. It’s a pity that you can’t serve me.”

“F * ck your comparison!”Qin Yu could not help but curse.

These eight higher-ups were the most disgusting people in Qin Yu’s life. They were the real instigators!

“Where did Gu Zizhen go?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

The higher-ups put their hands behind their backs and smiled faintly. “Him? A piece of trash who can’t even defend the second mystic realm. Why should I keep him?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth and said, “Gu Zizhen would rather give his life to defend the second secret realm, but you just gave him up. Are you still human?”

Who would have thought that Gu Zizhen would actually die in the hands of his own people!

“Compared to you, Gu Zizhen seems to be a good man,”Qin Yu said coldly.

That higher-up wasn’t angry either. He said with a faint smile, “So what? Who told you that there is a black and white division in this world?”

“Cut the crap!”Qin Yu shouted. His internal Qi surged, and a great battle was about to break out.

The expression of that high-ranking official gradually turned cold.

“Today, I will use this body to let you feel what despair is!”He held the light in his hand with a proud expression!
