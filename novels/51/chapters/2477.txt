2478 He Teng Appears

“Boom!”

A bolt of greyish-dark lightning struck down almost as soon as Wan Li spoke.

He could not even resist before his body dissipated completely. That power had already far exceeded the realm of the fifth level.

This unforeseen event made Qin Yu shudder. He restrained his internal qi to the extreme, afraid of attracting the attention of the monster race’s eyes.

“Path of Demon, take my life too if you’re capable…”

Wan Ming’s face was filled with grief as he rushed out.

Qin Yu appeared beside him in an instant and pulled him back.

“Master, there will be a great war in the future. At that time, the human race will still need you. Don’t lose your life here.”

Qin Yu quickly sealed his internal qi. Seeing the monster race’s eye not attracted by the turmoil here, he took a deep breath.

“It’s the Soul Suppressing Stone. I didn’t expect this guy to know the Way of Cosmic Luck. Moreover, he had killed so many human geniuses. Is he going to surrender to the Path of Heaven of the monster race?”

Lei Xin stared at the multicolored power of cosmic luck, and immense anger filled his face.

For people who cultivated the Way of Cosmic Luck, Qin Yu had come across the two-faced Buddha, Hua Tian. This power was extremely mysterious, and the fact that He Teng also cultivated this surprised Qin Yu.

A violent fluctuation seemed to have come from the back of the Heaven Gate.

The eye of the monster race seemed to have spoken the language of the monster race. After that sound rang out in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, Qin Yu’s soul seemed to have been scraped by an iron rake, and a deep wound appeared.

The same happened to others. The power of a sound was so terrifying!

In the blink of an eye, a vigorous force descended behind the Hevan Gate and precisely struck He Teng’s body.

His body underwent a tremendous dramatic change, seizing the opportunity.

Just like the advancement of the eight-winged monster race, his body underwent a more delicate reconstruction.

An absolute vacuum formed around him. At this moment, the spatial power could no longer bear the power of his physical body.

“I shall appoint you as the new Fallen Godly King.”

An obscure monster race language was in the air. Qin Yu could roughly understand the meaning.

“Boom!”

He Teng’s head suddenly exploded, and the power of the soul was floating on his body.

A crack appeared in his soul and slowly pulled down like a zipper.

His soul power was split into two halves out of thin air in such a manner.

“Hahaha, He Teng, you can get lost now. Your soul still dares to share this body with me. This body is mine now.”

Half of the soul let out a shrill and wild laugh. The monster race’s Path of Heaven would choose a suitable soul itself.

He Teng’s previous human race soul was directly segregated by the power of the monster race’s Path of Heaven.

“Don’t even think about it. It’s my body. No one can take it away from me!”

The other half of He Teng segregated let out a mournful roar.

Before his soul segregated, it exploded with destructive power.

In that instant, he actually self-destructed.

After the self-destruction, his soul origin carried a terrifying impact and rushed into the other half of his soul.

The moment the “zipper” closed, he rushed into the other half of the soul.

“Hahaha, now it’s me possessing you.”

The soul let out an angry and ferocious smile.

“Boom!”

A moment later, his soul re-entered his body and spread to every part of his body with the power of the soul. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A destructive force shot out from his body quietly.

“Qin Yu, come and settle our score.”

An extremely sinister smile appeared as his gaze suddenly turned toward Qin Yu.

As He Teng’s line of sight reached him, Qin Yu felt a mountain-toppling pressure pressing down on him. His entire body sank a thousand meters underground, caught off guard.

“Boom!”

He Teng stomped his feet, and the entire ground structure instantly changed.

The deep ditch destroyed by the violent force was like gravel under his terrifying strength.

The ground was compressed to the extreme and was kicked into a metal plate.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu burst out with the power of his six acupoints, causing the ground to explode directly.

He rushed out of the ground and arrived in front of He Teng with a solemn expression.

“Boom!”

Without any fancy moves, the two parties punched each other.

The loud noise of bones shattering could be heard distinctly, even outside the seal.

Qin Yu’s body was sent flying in an instant. The power of the six major acupoints clashed with He Teng’s monster race body. Their strength was not on the same level at all.

If he hadn’t seen that the situation wasn’t right and used the momentum to retreat, half of his body would have exploded.

“Ninth Heavens Divine Thunder! Explode!”

“Boom!”

When the divine thunder descended, He Teng grabbed it in his hand and stuffed it into his mouth.

The power of the light of thunder and lightning was faintly flickering in the pores of his exaggerated dark green muscles. He had actually eaten the most formidable divine thunder and lightning as a tonic.

Sword of the Origin!

Qin Yu’s internal qi exploded, and the spatial power of the origin flowed into his hand.

A clear primordial rune appeared in his hand and instantly transformed into a green sword.

The sword, emitting a suffocating sharpness, stabbed toward He Teng.

“Boom!”

He Teng let out a strange laugh and punched out again.

The fist qi seemed to contain the undigested power of divine thunder. The qi of thunder and lightning surrounded the arm in one punch.

Qin Yu’s Sword of the Origin curled up right at the instant of contact.

It started to shatter from the tip of the sword and disappeared into the air in the blink of an eye.

The remaining force slammed into Qin Yu’s chest, causing the upper half of his chest to cave in by four centimeters.

All the bones in his body made exaggerated sounds as his body was sent flying.

Along the way, he crashed into countless rocks and only stopped after fifteen minutes.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt his body seemed did not belong to him.

He had never encountered such a terrifying power before. It could directly block his primordial rune with just the physical strength.

Countless of his blood vessels ruptured. The blood flow, including his bone fragments, surged into his chest. He could not help but spit out a large mouthful of blood.

“So weak? It’s a bit boring. I thought that as my old enemy, you should be able to satisfy me. Isn’t this cause me to lose my appetite?”

He Teng let out a mournful roar and jumped up and down like a madman.

“Are you done playing? Kill them if you’re.”

All of a sudden, his expression turned tremendously gloomy, and his gaze landed on Qin Yu like a venomous snake.

“None of your business. I want to torture him to death and let him experience my fear.”

The expression on He Teng’s face turned crazy again.

The two seemed to be arguing as they fought crazily for control of the body.

However, his true body, He Teng, was in a weaker position. Soon, he was suppressed by the other half.

“You guys can die now. The cosmic luck of a few of you is not bad. It’s just right to be offered it to Lord Path of Heaven.”
