Chapter 552: Seizing the Spiritual Spring! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The news of Qin Yu establishing the sect soon spread!

Even though the Sect Master wasn’t Qin Yu, everyone still tacitly agreed that Qin Yu was the true Sect Master of the Green Moon Villa.

In the Green Moon Villa, Qin Yu, Zhen Yue, and the others were gathered together, and the members of the Green Moon Villa were waiting.

At a glance, there were less than ten people in the huge Green Moon Villa.

“Is this all the members?” Qin Yu asked.

Zhen Yue smiled bitterly. “It’s already good enough to have these people.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. At this moment, he thought of the Iceheart Lake again.

“Sect Master Zhen, let me ask you a question,” Qin Yu said.

“Can the gap under the Iceheart Lake be opened by force?”

Although Zhen Yue was alarmed, she still shook her head and said, “It can’t be opened.”

“Even an Martial Marquis can’t open it?” Qin Yu asked. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Zhen Yue nodded and said, “Yes, even Martial Marquises can’t open it.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but take a sip of water.

In this case, Qin Yu was relieved.

In the afternoon, Zhen Yue came to Qin Yu’s room.

She said with some suspicion, “Mr. Qin, after you posted on the Martial Arts Forum, why didn’t anyone come?”

Qin Yu took a sip of tea and said with an aloof smile, “Because I didn’t leave an address. Of course, no one came.”

Zhen Yue was stunned.

She frowned and asked, “No address? Then why did you post it?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I posted it to show the Saint Confucian Sect.”

“The Saint Confucian Sect?” Zhen Yue was even more confused.

Wasn’t he asking for trouble?

Qin Yu didn’t explain. He glanced at his watch and said in a low voice, “It’s about time.”

“What time?” Zhen Yue asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu looked at Zhen Yue and said, “Sect Master Zhen, gather everyone and leave this place.”

“Leave?” Zhen Yue was completely confused.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “If I’m not mistaken, Gu Canghai should be on his way here.”

“Gu Canghai? The Master of Saint Confucian Sect?” Zhen Yue exclaimed.

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“Take your men and leave the Green Moon Villa immediately. I’ll inform you when I’ll be back,” Qin Yu said.

Zhen Yue frowned and said in a low voice, “But... I don’t want to leave this place at all. My father told me that...”

“Don’t worry. Nothing will happen to the Green Moon Villa,” said Qin Yu.

“Their goal is the Iceheart Lake. Since they can’t open it with brute force, what do you have to worry about?”

“On the contrary, if you stay here, you will lose the Iceheart Lake. Gu Canghai will definitely use inhuman methods to force you to tell him how to open the gap.”

Zhen Yue suddenly understood.

She nodded immediately, “Mr. Qin, you are right. Then... where should we go?”

“Anywhere is fine. Just don’t stay in Jade City,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Time is tight. I won’t explain to you. Let’s move quickly.”

Zhen Yue didn’t dare to say anything else and hurriedly agreed.

After arranging everything, Qin Yu left Jade City.

“Gu Canghai, it’s time for you to pay the price,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The place Qin Yu was going to was the Saint Confucian Sect!

In the entire Saint Confucian Sect, there was only one person Qin Yu was afraid of, and that person was Gu Canghai.

As long as Gu Canghai left, the Saint Confucian Sect wouldn’t be worth mentioning!

Qin Yu had only one purpose for going to the Saint Confucian Sect this time, and that was the Saint Confucian Sect’s Spiritual Spring!

Rumor had it that the Saint Confucian Sect relied on the Spiritual Spring to establish the sect, and that Spiritual Spring had been passed down for many years. It was the lifeline of the Saint Confucian Sect.

Qin Yu planned to absorb that Spiritual Spring before Gu Canghai realized it!

“If everything goes smoothly, I should be able to step into the Martial Marquis Realm successfully.” On the way to the Saint Confucian Sect, Qin Yu thought inside.

After spending nearly five hours, Qin Yu finally arrived at the Saint Confucian Sect’s entrance.

“Spiritual Spring... I’m here,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

He strode into the Saint Confucian Sect and headed straight for the main hall!

Qin Yu used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique at an extremely fast speed.

In the entire Saint Confucian Sect, no one doubted Qin Yu’s identity at all.

Because no one would have thought that Qin Yu would actually do the unthinkable and take the initiative to come to the Saint Confucian Sect!

In the main hall, Deng Sheng was sitting on Gu Canghai’s seat while silently sipping tea.

This feeling of being the Sect Master made him extremely satisfied.

“Go, refill my tea.” Deng Sheng handed the yeacup in his hand to the maidservant beside him.

The maidservant didn’t dare say anything. She hurriedly took the teacup and refilled Deng Sheng’s water.

At this moment, someone suddenly walked into the main hall.

The moment he entered, he immediately closed the main hall’s iron door.

Deng Sheng couldn’t help but frown and say, “Who are you? Why are you closing the door?!”

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Deng Sheng.

“It went smoother than I thought.” Qin Yu grinned.

Deng Sheng’s expression changed when he saw Qin Yu’s face!

“Qin... Qin Yu!” Deng Sheng stood up and was about to shout.

However, Qin Yu was one step faster than him and arrived in front of Deng Sheng in the blink of an eye.

He reached out and grabbed Deng Sheng’s neck before lifting him up into the air.

Although Deng Sheng was also a half-step Martial Marquis, he was completely powerless in front of Qin Yu.

His eyes were filled with fear, and he was struggling non-stop.

“If you don’t want to die, shut up obediently,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Deng Sheng hurriedly blinked to express his agreement.

Qin Yu released Deng Sheng, then sat on Gu Canghai’s seat.

“Qin... Qin Yu, what... what do you want to do?” Deng Sheng asked in panic.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Deng Sheng, it seems that you really enjoy the feeling of being the Sect Master.”

Deng Sheng’s expression changed, and he hurriedly shook his head and said, “Don’t talk nonsense! I’m loyal to Sect Master Gu!”

“No need to worry.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“If I can let you take over Gu Canghai’s position and become the next Sect Master, would you be willing to?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

A hint of greed flashed across Deng Sheng’s face.

Although it was fleeting, it still couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s eyes.

“I don’t want to be the Sect Master. Sect Master Gu is our leader!” Deng Sheng said.

Qin Yu sneered. “What if Gu Canghai dies?”

Deng Sheng was stunned and hurriedly said, “Sect Master Gu is dead?”

“Not yet, but soon,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“As long as you cooperate with me, I promise to make you the next Sect Master. How about it?” Qin Yu said.

Upon hearing this, Deng Sheng’s eyes immediately flashed with greed!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer inside.

Back then, Gu Canghai had used this method to defeat the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

And now, Qin Yu was going to use the same method to defeat the Saint Confucian Sect!

“What do you need me to do?” Deng Sheng asked tentatively.

Qin Yu said aloofly, “As long as you take me to the Saint Confucian Sect’s Spiritual Spring and conceal my identity, it will be enough.”
