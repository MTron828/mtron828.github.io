Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “As expected.”

That force was so powerful that even Qin Yu, who possessed the power of a martial saint, was no match for him.

If it was a half-step martial saint, Qin Yu might still be able to fight.

“It seems like they really can’t leave the secret realm,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

As he spoke up to this point, Qin Yu suddenly thought of the martial saint who was imprisoned in the depths.

“It’s said that the martial arts association of Jingdu is imprisoning the martial saint. Then, how do they survive in this world?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Jiang he glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Have you ever thought that the prison is also a secret realm?”

Qin Yu was stunned and immediately understood.

That’s right, the depths of the prison might be a secret realm!

That martial saint was also locked in the secret realm!

“I understand,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

At this moment, he thought of something and immediately looked at the pavilion master and said, “Where are the two people I brought back?”

The pavilion master said, “They are locked in the dungeon.”

“Bring me there immediately. I want to see them,”Qin Yu said hurriedly.

Then, the few of them walked towards the dungeon.

As the dungeon’s door opened, Qin Yu saw Zheng Ke, who was locked below, and the young girl that Qin Yu had brought out from the second secret realm.

Qin Yu frowned. He pulled the young girl’s hand and pulled her out of the dungeon.

“I won’t hurt you. I just want to ask you a few questions,”Qin Yu said as he looked at the young girl whose face was covered in tears.

The girl hurriedly nodded, her big eyes filled with tears.

“Lord Pavilion Master, please arrange a place for her,”Qin Yu said.

The pavilion master nodded slightly. She looked at the girl and said, “Follow me.”

Then, Qin Yu’s gaze fell on Zheng Ke.

“You should know why I’m Looking For You,”Qin Yu asked coldly.

Zheng Ke looked up at Qin Yu and snorted, “How would I know?”

“If you don’t know, then I’ll tell you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Tell me the method to open the mystic realm, and I’ll spare your life.”

Zheng Ke couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that, “Qin Yu, don’t think that I don’t know. Even if I tell you, you’ll still kill me!”

Qin Yu frowned.

Just as Zheng Ke said, with Qin Yu’s current state of mind, he would not let Zheng Ke off at all.

But for Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu still took a deep breath and said, “I promise, as long as you tell me, I will spare you.”

“In your dreams! There are very few people in this world who can open the mystic realm! As long as I don’t tell you, at least I can keep my life!”Zheng Ke sneered.

“Do you think I’m a Fool? If I tell you, it means that I have lost my value! At that time, I will only die!”

Qin Yu sneered, “You know a lot, but I tell you, I, Qin Yu, will keep my word. As long as you tell me, I promise to spare you.”

“Hehe, I’m not a three-year-old child.”Zheng Ke turned his face away.

Qin Yu said coldly, “If that’s the case, then I can only kill you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s palm flashed with light as he walked towards Zheng Ke step by step.

At this moment, although Zheng Ke was panicking, he still closed his eyes, gritted his teeth, and didn’t say a word.

The Ray of light came close to his face, but in the end, it slowly disappeared.

“You have a tough mouth,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“But I have plenty of time. Sooner or later, you will open your mouth.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the dungeon.

He didn’t have time to waste on Zheng Ke for the time being. Instead, he had to find Granny Qin as soon as possible and find a way to undo the divine binding spell.

Qin Yu didn’t sleep the whole night.

The sky turned white.

The mustached man yawned and walked out of the room.

“TSK TSK, I didn’t sleep the whole night,”the mustached man muttered.

Seeing the mustached man, Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and said, “Use these few days to help me build a teleportation formation.”

“Teleportation formation?”The mustached man frowned. “Where to?”

“The Church of the Immortals,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“The Jingdu martial arts association hasn’t made a move against me yet. It doesn’t mean they want to let me go. They’re waiting for my martial saint’s power to disappear.”

“So, I have to find a place to hide.”

The mustached man scratched his head and said, “Okay.”

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Thanks. When I’m invincible in the world, I’ll definitely make you the crown prince.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

...

Jingdu.

Granny Qin’s face was full of sorrow and pain.

She stood in front of Blackie’s door, and she couldn’t help but shed a trace of tears.

At this time, the door was pushed open, and Blackie walked out.

“Granny Qin, Why Are You Here?”Blackie rubbed his eyes and asked.

Granny Qin wiped her tears and said with a smile, “I’m fine. I just came to see you.”

“Granny Qin, What’s Wrong?”Blacky was a little puzzled.

Granny Qin smiled and said, “I’m fine.”

Blacky welcomed Granny Qin into the room and poured her a glass of water.

“Granny Qin, if there’s anything you need, you must tell me.”Blacky’s brows were tightly knitted and his face was filled with worry.

Granny Qin waved her hand.

At this moment, she suddenly raised her head and said in a trembling voice, “Blacky, can you call me Mother?”

Little Black was stunned. When he heard those words, he immediately knelt in front of Granny Qin and called out: “Mother.”

Granny Qin’s eyes were instantly filled with tears.

She shakily stroked little Black’s head and said with a smile: “Good Son... . . Good son... . . No matter what, I will not let you die.”

With that said, she fished out a bank card from her bosom and handed it to little black. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Little Black, take this bank card and leave the JINGDU, leave the fire country, and go as far away as possible!”Granny Qin patted little black on the head and said rather reluctantly.

Little Black’s brows creased up even more tightly.

He looked at Granny Qin in puzzlement and asked: “Mother, what exactly happened, can you tell me?”

Granny Qin waved her hand helplessly and said with a sigh: “It’s all my fault, I should not have let you get involved in this muddy waters, and I should not have let you make any bet with that Qin Yu... . .”

“No, I volunteered,”Blackie hurriedly said.

“Mother, if there’s anything, you can tell me, okay? I’ll bear it with you.”

“It must be the higher-ups of the Jingdu martial arts association who want to settle the score with you.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from outside.

Turning around, he saw Qin Yu walking over.

Seeing Qin Yu, Blackie suddenly stood up and said coldly, “Qin Yu, what do you want to do!”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “You are not my match. Save your strength.”

After saying that, Qin Yu swaggered to the table and sat down. He even poured himself a cup of tea.

“Granny Qin, I came here today not to quarrel with you.”Qin Yu took a sip of tea.

Granny Qin said coldly, “What do you want to Do?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I want to know how to undo the divine binding spell.”
