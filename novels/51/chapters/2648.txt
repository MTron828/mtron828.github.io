Chapter 2649: Entering the Demon Sealing Valley

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

They hurried to Demon Sealing Valley, but neither Jing Xin nor Ling’er seemed to have any flying magical artifact on them. Magical artifacts seemed to be rare in the Saint Kingdom.

Fortunately, they did not encounter any powerful ancient demons on their way back.

Apart from a few weaker ancient demons, they did not encounter any other accidents.

“Qin Yu, the bow you used previously, was it the Sun Chasing Bow?”

Along the way, Aiden from the elven race hesitated a few times, but he finally couldn’t hold back his desire to speak.

“Yes.”

Qin Yu replied expressionlessly.

“Can you show me this bow?”

Aiden asked again with an indescribable desire in his eyes.

The elven race was a natural archer. As the top genius of the race, he had also come for the legendarv divine artifact this time- He did not exnect this bow to appear in Qin Yu’s hands just like that.

Qin Yu directly took down the Sun Chasing Bow from his back and placed it in Aiden’s hand.

The moment the bow landed in Aiden’s hand, Qin Yu felt a strange change in its aura.

It felt as if the power of the bow had perfectly combined with the power of the demon. It was a natural feeling.

It gently raised the bowstring in his hand, and three soft bowstring sounds rang out.

The three energy arrows had already collided.

Three stars!

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked. He relied on his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze to cultivate for a long time before cultivating the Two Stars Alignment.

After the three stars collided, the first arrow directly exploded on a mountain peak, accurately blowing up a towering ancient tree in the distance.

Judging from the direction Aiden was meowing, the angle was also specially controlled.

One had to know that even if the angle between the arrows was slightly different, the final direction would be much different.

Even though Aiden didn’t use much strength, it was still a huge blow to Qin Yu’s mind when he used the bow for the first time.

“The eyes of us fairies are natural aiming devices. Our body structure, including our talent, makes us natural archers.”

Aiden seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s shock. He pulled his bow to the maximum again.

He had close to 90% of his strength. Even Qin Yu was unable to achieve such a degree of separation. Moreover, he was able to do it to such an extent that his strength was far inferior to Qin Yu’s. This was extremely exaggerated.

Indeed, as he said, the fairies were born archers.

Their body structure, their race’s talent, everything was born for this.

Aiden slowly released the bowstring, and the energy arrows dissipated from his hand.

“Can I have this bow? I can serve you faithfully from now on!” Aiden tentatively asked.

“Don’t even think about it. Don’t forget, you still owe me a life!” Qin Yu took the bow from his hand, saying impatiently.

“If you can swear to be loyal to me for the rest of your life in this Saint Kingdom, perhaps I can consider it,” Qin Yu said with a smile. Being able to chat with Aiden like this was due to Immortal Emperor Yao confiding in him.

Among the demon race, the elven fairies valued promises the most. Aiden owed him a life, so he wasn’t afraid of ingratitude. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Aiden looked conflicted. Who wouldn’t want to seize the opportunity in this Saint Kingdom?

In the long years, only this batch of individuals fortunate enough to obtain the divine flame runes could enter this Saint Kingdom. Who wouldn’t want to compete for the 18 positions?

However, agreeing to Qin Yu’s request would mean giving up this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

“I understand that this divine artifact bow is important to you, but it also greatly benefits me. In this Saint Kingdom, there is no such thing as having the best of both worlds. You must pay a sufficient price to obtain what you want,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Aiden continued his journey in silence, acknowledging Qin Yu’s words.

His strength would undoubtedly soar after obtaining this Sun Chasing Bow. Wasn’t that also disadvantageous for Qin Yu?

Moreover, in this Saint Kingdom, everyone could experience a bit of its allure.

Those who entered this place were all absolute geniuses. Even if they had a temporary advantage in strength, it might fade over time.

After nearly half a day of travel, the group finally arrived at the Demon Sealing Valley.

When they saw the vast sect territory in front of them, even these geniuses from various races couldn’t help but exclaim in amazement.

Before them lay a flat land stretching as far as the eye could see, devoid of mountains or greenery.

There were only endless formations and various vajra gates.

This was a sect deep underground, hundreds of meters below the surface. Just the stairs alone took a full ten minutes to traverse.

The Land of Eternal Night, coupled with such deep terrain, made Qin Yu unable to help but feel a suffocating illusion.

Fortunately, the further they descended, the more numerous luminous crystals were embedded in the ground and walls, slightly alleviating the oppressive atmosphere.

“When the Demon Sealing Valley was first established, the sect master made an oath. As long as the ancient demons are not eradicated, we are only worthy of gazing from the bottom of the valley,” Ling’er explained to the astonished group.

“What a domineering oath!” Qin Yu remarked, still reeling from the implications.

“Is your sect master currently in the Demon Sealing Valley?” Qin Yu inquired, curiosity piqued.

“The sect master disappeared long ago. Recently, decisions have mostly made by Elder Gu Yi and Elder Xin Yue. While Elder Xin Yue is steadfast in following the sect master’s path, Elder Gu Yi’s faction boasts greater strength, higher combat prowess, and loftier ambitions,” Ling’er elaborated.

As they conversed, they navigated through numerous checkpoints.

Despite the expansive flat terrain, intricate formations posed obstacles. Without the guidance of Jing Xin and Ling’er, outsiders like them would struggle to locate the entrance.

“Jing Xin, Linger, where are you leading these outsiders?” a voice interjected as they entered the Demon Sealing Valley.

Five individuals, sporting mocking smiles, observed Qin Yu and his companions, exuding a predatory air.

“Naturally, we’ll take them to Elder Xin Yue,” Jing Xin replied calmly.

“Elder Xin Yue is preoccupied. How about we take charge of these outsiders? What do you think?” Roger proposed, approaching Qin Yu’s group with a predatory gaze.

“Roger, remember, this is the Demon Sealing Valley. Adhere to its rules and avoid stirring trouble. These individuals were brought here by me, so I’ll guide them,” Jing Xin asserted, locking eyes with Roger without a hint of emotion..
