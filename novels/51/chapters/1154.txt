Chapter 1155: Chapter 1,155, the power of the bloodline 

This was undoubtedly a tremendous power!

If all the mighty figures were gathered at the martial arts association in Jingdu, then perhaps no one would be able to go against Gu Xinghe!

...

In the main hall of the first secret realm, the wailing continued.

Qin Yu was a little annoyed when he heard this. He cursed, “Stop F * cking humming non-stop, like a woman.”

“F * ck you...”Yan Yongfu scolded back.

“If it weren’t for you... We would never have fallen into such a situation...”

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered, “Oh, you’re Awake? Tell me, what do you mean by that?”

Yan Yongfu snorted coldly. Of course, he didn’t want to pay attention to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sneered, “You don’t want to say it, right? Fine, when Gu Xinghe comes, I’ll continue to anger him and make you all suffer even more.”

As soon as these words were said, the faces of the eight higher-ups instantly turned pale with fright!

Yan Yongfu’s attitude changed as he gritted his teeth and said, “You’re Ruthless!”

With that, Yan Yongfu told Qin Yu the whole story.

After Qin Yu heard it, he couldn’t help but sneer, “All of you are really stupid. It’s good to believe who you want to believe. Do you believe in Gu Xinghe?”

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t care who they believed in.

What he cared about was the spell Yan Yongfu mentioned.

This kind of spell could gather everyone’s strength into one person. It was simply a godly skill.

“When you guys pass this spell to me later, I might consider letting you guys die a quick death,”Qin Yu muttered.

Yan Yongfu snorted coldly, “You should think about how to leave this place...”

Qin Yu didn’t answer him. He thought for a moment and said, “By the way, you seem to be quite afraid of my father.”

“Aren’t you afraid?”Yan Yongfu said with a cold face.

Qin Yu ignored him and continued to ask, “By the way, what exactly is the strength of a Dao Guardian?”

“I don’t know,”Yan Yongfu said with a bad face.

Qin Yu didn’t continue to ask this question. He thought for a moment and said, “By the way, why do you have to get Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline? You have to tell me this question.”

Yan Yongfu endured the pain and said, “Because her bloodline is very strong. It’s that simple.”

“That’s not right,”qin yu muttered, “As far as I know, my bloodline and Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline seem to be able to fuse and display even more powerful power. Not Bad, right?”

Upon mentioning this topic, Yan Yongfu’s expression suddenly changed!

He seemed to have thought of something, and his face actually had some excitement.

“What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu asked.

Yan Yongfu couldn’t care less about the pain and said, “Qin Yu, I’ll make a deal with you. How about it?”

“Deal?”Qin Yu looked at Yan Yongfu in surprise.

Yan Yongfu hummed in gratitude and said, “To tell you the truth, I Still Have Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline in my hands.”

“Just as you said, you can indeed fuse with Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline and display unparalleled strength!”

Qin Yu frowned. Although he felt a little uncomfortable, he still motioned for Yan Yongfu to continue.

At this moment, Yan Yongfu even forgot about the pain.

He said, “I can give you Yan Ruoxue’s blood and use this blood pressure to exchange for our lives. How about it?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qin Yu remained silent.

In fact, Qin Yu wanted to tear these people into pieces immediately.

It was impossible for him to let them live.

“Qin Yu, let me tell you that the benefits of your bloodline fusion will definitely exceed your imagination,”Yan Yongfu reminded him.

“I’m not afraid to tell you that the reason I took Yan Ruoxue away in the first place was to prevent the blood fusion between the two of you.”

“It was only later that I discovered that this bloodline was actually useful to others.”

Qin Yu felt waves of anger in his heart when he brought up the issue of Yan Ruoxue’s blood. This also increased Qin Yu’s hatred towards Yan Yongfu and the others by a few levels.

“No.”Qin Yu shook his head after thinking over and over again.

He looked coldly at Yan Yongfu and said, “I can still obtain this bloodline after you die.”

“Do you think that if we can’t live, I will leave the blood behind for you?”Yan Yongfu sneered.

“Since you don’t want to, then forget it.”Yan Yongfu no longer paid attention to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned.

Qin Yu was indeed quite curious about the power of this blood fusion.

Moreover... If he could obtain this power, the chances of surviving would be higher.

“I can only promise to spare you,”Qin Yu said coldly after hesitating for a while.

Yan Yongfu immediately frowned when he heard this.

“No, we absolutely can not agree to him!”The other higher-ups immediately became anxious!

Qin Yu snorted, “It’s fine if you don’t agree. Anyway, the holy region is about to open. I will be able to see Ruoxue sooner or later.”

At this moment, Yan Yongfu was also a little conflicted.

These higher-ups were all his beloved relatives and friends. Yan Yongfu really couldn’t bear to give them up just like that.

A moment later, Yan Yongfu took a deep breath and said, “Okay, deal.”

In the face of life and death, everyone was selfish, and Yan Yongfu was naturally the same.

“Yan Yongfu! You...”those higher-ups were immediately filled with anger.

However, Yan Yongfu couldn’t care about them. As long as they were alive, there was still hope.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Where is the blood?”

“I can’t tell you for the time being.”Yan Yongfu shook his head.

He pointed at the few chains and said, “You have to think of a way to escape from here first.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took a deep breath and said in his heart, “It seems that I have to understand the fifth level of the Dou character manual as soon as possible.”

“That’s right.”At this moment, Yan Yongfu spoke again.

“Not only can you not kill me, but you can also not cripple my cultivation and hurt me.”

It had to be said that this old man Yan Yongfu was extremely cunning. He had long thought of the thoughts in Qin Yu’s heart.

Although Qin Yu was unhappy, after thinking for a moment, he finally nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll agree to it.”
