2049 The Earth Rank Saint Weapon

Xiao Hai’s words caused Qin Yu’s body to tense up. Following that, he hurriedly looked at the man with the mustache.

“That’s impossible,” the man with the mustache shook his head and said. “I can’t even deduce the exact time, let alone a person.

“No one can predict who will be chosen on the day of the Path of Heaven..”

Qin Yu and Xiao Hai nodded and did not continue asking.

After that, the man with the mustache did not stay long. They decided to meet in Divine Fortuity City.

!!

Once the nine great aristocratic families made a move again, they would enter the Chaos Grave through the teleportation formation in Divine Fortuity City.

After parting ways, Qin Yu concealed his internal qi and planned to look for Mr. Gen.

He would feel much more at ease if he had a Saint Weapon.

He went all the way to Mr. Gen’s shop. Mr. Gen was still lying lifeless as usual, holding half a pot of wine in his hand.

When he saw Qin Yu come in, he did not have any reaction. He squinted his eyes as if he was asleep.

“Mr. Gen, is the thing ready?” Qin Yu walked up to Mr. Gen and went straight to the point.

Mr. Gen glanced at Qin Yu and said, “What thing? Who are you?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I asked you to forge a Saint Weapon but never had the time to come and collect it,” Qin Yu said softly.

Mr. Gen stretched and sat up from the recliner.

“You’re Qin Yu, are you?” he asked, sizing him up.

Qin Yu was stunned. Then he said nervously, “That’s right, I am.”

Mr. Gen laughed and said, “I’ve kept your Saint Weapon with me for a long time. It’s not a problem for you to take it away, but you have to pay me for the storage fee.”

Qin Yu could not help but curse in his heart.

This guy was indeed a money-grubber. He would never let go of any opportunity to make money.

“How much?” Qin Yu did not want to argue with him and hurriedly asked.

“Just give me 100 million Spirit Coins,” Mr. Gen said.

Qin Yu resisted the urge to curse and gritted his teeth. “Alright, I’ll give it to you!”

Thus Qin Yu paid Mr. Gen another 100 million Spirit Coins.

The two came to Mr. Gen’s backyard. All kinds of furnaces were in the backyard and the entire backyard was tremendously messy. There was almost no place to set their feet in.

They passed through the backyard and came to a room in the depth of the backyard.

After pushing open the door, wisps of mysterious internal qi assailed their senses.

When he looked over, the room was full of magical artifacts! They casually piled up on the ground like trash!

Qin Yu took a casual glance and was tremendously shocked!

They were incredibly precious magical artifacts and no lack of Saint Weapons with extraordinary internal qi!

People would fight badly for any one of them.

“These magical artifacts…You just dumped them here?” Qin Yu frowned.

“Otherwise?” Mr. Gen laughed and said. “Do I bow to them?”

Qin Yu coughed dryly and did not say anything.

Then Mr. Gen rummaged through the pile of magical artifacts and soon found the Saint Weapon.

It was like a treasure sword that seemed to have been forged from holy bones.

The Holy Power it emitted was quite terrifying. Even Qin Yu was stunned by this Saint Weapon!

Although Mr. Gen looked tremendously sloppy, the Saint Weapon he forged was incomparably exquisite, and its internal qi could be said to be perfect!

“This Saint Weapon is probably at the Mystical Rank,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Mr. Gen glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Are you looking down on me? None of the magical artifacts I forge is lower than Earth Rank.”

“It’s an Earth Rank Saint Weapon?” Qin Yu exclaimed.

“Why? Is it very strange?” Mr. Gen laughed.

Qin Yu quickly waved his hand and said, “No, I just didn’t expect your technique to be so… exquisite.”

“Cut the crap. Take your things and get lost. I don’t like others in my room,” Mr. Gen waved his hand impatiently and said.

Qin Yu resentfully put away the magical artifact and could not help but think to himself, “This Mr. Gen is a rare talent.”

If he could rope him in in the future, he would definitely play an unimaginable role.

After taking the Saint Weapon, Qin Yu bad goodbye to Mr. Gen and left.

Then he returned to Xiao Hai’s Mystic Realm of the magical artifact and found Jue Wu.

As usual, Jue Wu ate, drank, and had fun every day. Other than that, she was hugging her demonic egg like a little hen.

Seeing Qin Yu return, Jue Wu did not have much reaction. Obviously, Xiao Hai had already returned.

“How was it? Did you get anything?” Jue Wu asked as she held her demonic egg.

“No, not yet,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “But the Chaos Grave is Wu Ji’s grave.”

“Wu Ji? The chaotic body Wu Ji?” Jue Wu said in surprise.

“That’s right,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

“Oh my god! Wu Ji is my idol!” Jue Wu suddenly stood up.

“I’ll go next time!” she said excitedly.

“He’s already dead. Why do you still want to go?” Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said.

...

“You know nothing!” Jue Wu glared at Qin Yu and said. “Anyway, I will definitely follow next time.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment. Since there was a teleportation formation anyway, it did not matter with an additional person. Thus he nodded and agreed.

The following few days, Qin Yu stayed in this Mystic Realm and did not leave, waiting for the next move of the nine great aristocratic families.

Meanwhile, the nine great aristocratic families had already formulated a strategy. The various Holy Lords planned to bring their tribulation magical artifacts to break through the Chaos Grave no matter how!

Soon, the news spread.

“Ten days later, the nine great aristocratic families will attack the Chaos Grave!”

As soon as this news spread, many people flocked to the vicinity of Chaos Grave.

Wu Ji was indeed too legendary. He was almost one of the most legendary figures in history and also the only existence who killed an Immortal Emperor at the Tribulation Stage!

Therefore, despite facing the threat of death, people still wanted to see his Big Grave.

Time flew, and ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

At this moment, the vicinity of the Chaos Grave was already overcrowded. There were people all over the mountain.

Qin Yu brought Jue Wu to Divine Fortuity City once again.

They disguised themselves and came to the tavern as agreed earlier, waiting for the man with the mustache to arrive.

“Remember, you must be careful. The nine great aristocratic families will never allow anyone to enter the Chaos Grave,” Qin Yu pressed his straw hat down and said in a low voice.

“Don’t worry. I know what to do!” Jue Wu said casually.

At this moment, a woman with a voluptuous figure walked over from not far away.

She straightaway sat opposite Qin Yu and winked at him.

“Little brother, shall we have a drink together?” This woman made eyes at him, and her voice was full of temptation.

Jue Wu glanced at her and couldn’t help but curse, “You slut!”
