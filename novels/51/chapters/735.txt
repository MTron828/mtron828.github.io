Upon hearing Tang Mo’s words, Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Alright!”

With that, the two of them left the place in a huff.

Never did Qin Yu expect that Granny Qin would actually unintentionally assist him!

Originally, Qin Yu had already given up hope, but Granny Qin jumped out to help him!

After getting into Tang Mo’s car, the two of them rushed toward the Tang family.

It was already night time, but Tang Sheng didn’t sleep.

He was fishing by his own pond.

Tang Mo hurriedly ran in front of Tang Sheng and angrily said, “Dad, something happened!”

Tang Sheng glanced at Tang Mo and said, “What happened? Why are you making such a fuss?”

“Dad, I was insulted at the feast on the island just now,” Tang Mo angrily said.

“She said that Tang City is nothing but a trifling place, and she also said that we’re a small aristocratic family that has never seen the world!”

Tang Sheng’s expression turned ugly.

Tang Mo continued, “She also said that we’re a remote mountain village, and she also said that we’re mice!”

“It’s monkeys,” Qin Yu reminded from the side.

“Yes, she said that we’re monkeys!” Tang Mo gnashed his teeth and said.

After the insult, Tang Sheng’s expression turned extremely ugly.

The father and son were the same. They both liked to be flattered, and as long as they were flattered, they would become their friends.

“Qin Yu, go out first,” Tang Sheng tried his best to maintain his elegance and anger.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”

“Ah!!! Damn it! How dare you humiliate my family?! You’re courting death!!!”

Just as Qin Yu walked out, Tang Sheng’s angry roar came from behind him!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be speechless.

It was really rare to see someone like the Tang family’s father and son, who cared so much about face.

Ten minutes later.

Tang Mo came out of the room.

With a gloomy expression, he said, “Qin Yu, my dad said that you’re going to be our family’s guest for 20 years.”

“No problem!” Qin Yu agreed without thinking.

Tang Mo continued, “In four days, I will personally bring people to help you.”

Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed and quickly cupped his hands. “Then thank you very much, Young Master Tang!”

Tang Mo waved his hand and snorted lightly. “I want to let that Granny Qin see if our family are monkeys or not!”

“Yes! Teach them a good lesson!” Qin Yu clenched his fists and said.

...

After returning home, Qin Yu lay on the sofa and let out a long sigh of relief.

“It’s finally settled,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

At this moment, the man with the mustache came forward and said, “Qin Yu, I observed the celestial phenomenon at night and discovered an important event!”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What important event?”

The man with the mustache said with a gloomy look, “There will be a major event in the near future.”

“Major event? What major event?” Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “I can’t say for sure, but it’s definitely a major event, and it’s not a good thing.”

“Not a good thing?” This made Qin Yu a little confused.

From the man with the mustache’s serious expression, it didn’t seem like he was joking.

But what kind of bad thing was it? The man with the mustache couldn’t say for sure.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. To him, the most important thing now was to get the herbs.

...

At this moment, in the Immortal Slaying Sect.

The entire Immortal Slaying Sect was surrounded by a cold atmosphere.

In the midst of the ruins, a man suddenly appeared.

The man’s expression was cold and his figure was tall and straight. His eyes were extremely deep.

“The seal... has actually been lifted.” The man took a deep breath, and his eyes were instantly filled with black pupils!

Then, the man raised both his hands and finally muttered something.

In an instant, Immortal Slaying Sect shook, and the rumbling continued!

One coffin after another appeared under the ground!

These coffins pierced through the ground and appeared in front of the man!

“It’s a pity that the cult master’s corpse couldn’t be preserved,” the man said in a low voice, his eyes filled with regret.

“However... with these seven people, it’s enough to dominate the world.” Following that, the corners of the man’s mouth curled up into a cold smile.

...

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

There was only one day left until the appearance of the ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

And on this day, the surrounding internal qi had become a little strange.

Although it appeared to be calm and peaceful on the surface, but in reality, it was surging with tension.

Many top tier martial artists had come to the vicinity to wait for the appearance of the ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

They did not only come from Pyro, but also from outside the Pyro Empire.

Qin Yu released his divine sense, covering a radius of several tens of miles.

Soon, he felt many powerful internal qi.

“There are at least twenty to thirty Martial Marquises here,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

“I also felt it,” Xiao Yu suddenly interrupted.

Qin Yu glanced at Xiao Yu and said in surprise, “Your divine sense is so sharp? Did you deliberately cultivate it?”

“No, I don’t know the reason. In short... my divine sense seems to be changing every day.” Xiao Yu shook his head.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he was a little worried.

He wasn’t afraid of the masked woman, but he was worried that the masked woman and Xiao Yu weren’t the same person, so she was just using Xiao Yu’s body to be reborn.

If that was the case, it would be troublesome.

“I have to go to the Scripture Pavilion as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At night.

Qin Yu tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep.

He stood in front of the window, staring at the scenery outside.

“Tomorrow is the day of the birth of the divine herbs, yet it is so peaceful here,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Normally, the birth of ten-thousand-year-old herbs would definitely cause a natural phenomenon.

“Perhaps this is the tranquility before the storm.” Qin Yu shook his head.

He turned around and returned to his room before taking out his phone.

At this moment, the Martial Arts Forum was extremely heated. No one was discussing the matter of the ten-thousand-year-old herbs. Almost everyone was discussing Jiang He’s battle with the Heaven Swallowing Python.

“The battle lasted for three days. Jiang He won successfully!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

An eye-catching piece of news came into view!

“As expected of senior Jiang He.” Qin Yu was still somewhat surprised.

One had to know that the Heaven Swallowing Python and Jiang He were both at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm! It was very difficult to defeat Demon Beasts when at the same realm! It was almost impossible to defeat an Earth Rank Demon Beasts!

Qin Yu browsed through the Martial Arts Forum, and almost everyone was discussing this matter.

This also made Qin Yu wonder if Granny Qin had used this method to attract everyone’s attention so that the ten-thousand-year-old herbs wouldn’t be snatched away.

The sky gradually brightened.

The atmosphere in the vicinity became even more strange.

Even though everyone had restrained their internal qi, an extremely strong sense of oppression still gathered around them.

“Today is the day the ten-thousand-year-old herbs are born.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and immediately released his divine sense to cover the surroundings.
