Chapter 1710: The Great Battle Begins Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu, who had just set his mind at ease, tensed up again when he heard this.

With his back facing He Teng, he didn’t dare to turn around. He didn’t even dare to say a word, afraid that He Teng would notice something.

He Teng slowly walked up to Qin Yu. He raised his hand and placed it on Qin Yu’s shoulder. Following that, a wave of internal qi covered Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

With He Teng’s ability, it was definitely not difficult for him to detect Qin Yu’s abnormality!

At this moment, Qin Yu had no other choice. He could only try his best to restrain his internal qi and pray in his heart.

A few minutes later, the internal qi on He Teng’s body dissipated.

He sized up Qin Yu from head to toe, and a weird smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

“You may go now,” He Teng said indifferently.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. However, he was very puzzled.

He Teng knew him very well. With his ability, he could at least discover something strange about Qin Yu’s body.

But he allowed him to leave. Why? Could it be that he deliberately spared him?

Impossible!

He Teng was purely a wicked person. He had no feelings!

Qin Yu couldn’t care less at this moment. He wrapped himself tightly with the clothes and walked toward the depth of North Plain.

He Teng put his hands behind his back and quietly watched Qin Yu leave. The weird smile on his face grew wider.

…

At the northern border.

The battle was still ongoing. It was a great battle between the two parties, led by Yong Ji and Li Cheng.

Li Cheng’s strength didn’t seem to be weaker than Yong Ji’s. Yong Ji was even more frightened as they fought longer.

He couldn’t figure out if it was because he had become weaker or Li Cheng in front of him had become stronger.

It was almost impossible to take him down within a short time!

In contrast, in the surroundings, a large number of cultivators had fallen. Nanzhou and North Plain were actually neck and neck.

North Plain didn’t benefit from this battle!

After hesitating for a long time, Yjong Ji finally ordered, “Retreat!”

With that order, the North Plain cultivators began to retreat toward North Plain.

Yong Ji stood there, coldly looking at Li Cheng.

“You’re stronger than I’ve imagined,” Yong Ji said coldly.

Li Cheng said indifferently, “You’re not as terrifying as I’ve imagined.”

Yong Ji snorted and said, “Don’t be too complacent. This is just the beginning. You’ll die in my hands sooner or later.”

After saying this, Yong Ji turned around and left the northern border, rushing back to North Plain.

A large number of people were deployed around the northern lands. The objective was very simple. It was to prevent anyone from taking the opportunity to sneak into North Plain and attack Yuan Xiu.

Although the outcome of this battle was not clear, once stepping into North Plain, the difference in strength between the two parties would be obvious.

Therefore, most of the Nanzhou cultivators did not dare to step into North Plain and could only stay at the northern borders.

It was nightfall.

Yong Ji’s expression was incomparably cold.

There were many wounds on his body, and fresh blood was gushing out. It was a shocking sight.

However, this was not the reason that he was angry. What angered him the most was that he had not been able to kill Li Cheng, or even gain any benefits.

At this moment, Sima Bei walked in from outside.

Seeing Yong Ji’s appearance, his expression didn’t change much. He wasn’t even surprised.

“This battle was a big failure,” Yong Ji said coldly.

Sima Bei said indifferently, “I know, but don’t forget that our goal has never been the so-called victory or defeat.”

Yong Ji frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

Sima Bei flipped his palm and took out a few painting scrolls.

“What we want is this,” Sima Bei pointed at the painting scrolls and said.

Yong Ji was startled. He then frowned and said, “Why didn’t you say so earlier?”

Sima Bei said indifferently, “Didn’t you always want to prove your strength in front of the people of Nanzhou? Of course, I wanted to give you this opportunity. But unfortunately, you didn’t grasp it.”

The moment Sima Bei said this, Yong Ji was instantly furious.

He was about to stand up when Sima Bei pressed him down using his hand.

“It’s useless for you to get angry with me. This won’t change anything,” Sima Bei said indifferently.

Yong Ji gritted his teeth and said, “That Li Cheng isn’t worth mentioning. I’ll kill him sooner or later.”

“Hehe!” Sima Bei sneered. He didn’t continue this topic but said, “We must quickly let the Lord be completely resurrected. By then only North Plain will be truly complete.”

Yong Ji did not say a word but his heart was filled with displeasure.

“Your battle with Qin Yu should be about time, right?” Sima Bei suddenly asked.

“Mmm.” Yong Ji responded and said, “There are still three more days.”

“Three days, alright.” Sima Bei nodded slightly.

“You should stay in North Plain for the next few days to recuperate. Tomorrow, let He Teng take action,” Sima Bei said.

Yong Ji said with some displeasure, “I can deal with Qin Yu with one finger!”

“Don’t try to comfort yourself,” Sima Bei said without mercy.

He didn’t want to listen to Yong Ji’s bullsh*t and turned around to leave, leaving Yong Ji in anger alone.

At this moment, at the northern border, many people were surrounding Li Cheng.

Li Cheng was naturally injured too. It wasn’t much better off when compared to Yong Ji.

“D*mn it! That b*stard Yong Ji! He really deserves to die!” Hu Xing cursed.

“If it weren’t for him, we wouldn’t have lost so badly.

“Sigh! Speaking of which, there are so many people in Nanzhou who have reached the Reversion Void Stage. Why did only Senior Li Cheng show up?” someone asked in puzzlement.

“Hmph! They are all a bunch of selfish people,” Hu Xing snorted.

Li Cheng waved his hand and said, “Everyone has their own choice. There is no right or wrong.”

“Senior Li Cheng, what if Yong Ji returns tomorrow? And that Sima Bei, if he makes a move, I’m afraid…”

He didn’t finish his sentence, but what he meant was very obvious.

Li Cheng said in a deep voice, “I don’t know.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

If he went against Sima Bei in this state, he would definitely lose.

“I hope that there are others who can rush to the northern border,” someone said in a low voice.

…

In the depth of North Plain.

Qin Yu walked in the heavy snow for a long time before he finally found a place where no one was around.

This place was a vast expanse of whiteness. Near this place, there was a pond that was neither big nor small.

The pond had long been sealed by ice. Stepping on it, it was incomparably hard.

“Let’s do it here,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He sat down cross-legged and planned to start cultivating.

Qin Yu first took out the huge container and filled it up. Only then did he begin to absorb the dark energy from North Plain.

The dark energy of North Plain was even more terrifying than he had imagined!

Even Qin Yu was slightly suppressed.

“Such a dense dark energy is enough for me to cultivate,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Without further ado, he began to absorb the dark energy from North Plain.

Wisps of dark energy swept into his body at a speed far faster than before.

Perhaps it was due to the great change in the world, everyone’s cultivation speed had increased tremendously. And Qin Yu was no exception.
