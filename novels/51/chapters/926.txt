Chapter 927: Chapter 927, Gu Xinghe’s decision

Qin Yu frowned slightly. In the end, he was still targeted by this B * Stard.

He turned his face to the side without saying a word, trying to get away with it.

“What, are you scared now?”

However, Qiao Zun had no intention of letting Qin Yu go.

He sneered, “Aren’t you strong? Why Don’t you dare to Speak Now?”

Qin Yu frowned.

If this continued, Qin Yu might not be able to hold back.

“Brother Qiao, this kid really needs to be taught a lesson.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

At this moment, Wan Gu Qiong also walked over from the side.

The moment he saw Wan Gu Qiong, Qin Yu’s heart was even more furious.

Qin Yu could be said to Hate Wan Gu Qiong to the extreme. He wanted to kill him immediately.

“Eh?”At this moment, Wan Gu Qiong sized up Qin Yu.

“This kid looks familiar.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

Could it be... that he was seen through?

“Kid, Take Off Your Hat.”Wan Gu Qiong walked forward and said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at Wan Gu Qiong coldly. The anger in his heart rushed to his brain.

“What? You Don’t understand what I said, do you?”

Wan guqiong snorted coldly and raised his hand to take off Qin Yu’s hat.

Qin Yu subconsciously slapped Wan Guqiong’s wrist.

This undoubtedly infuriated Wan guqiong. He glared at Qin Yu and said, “You still dare to make a move, right? Fine, I’ll use you as an appetizer today!”

Qin Yu was instantly unable to restrain his anger, and his body stood up with a “Bang”!

Both sides were at daggers drawn, ready to fight at any time.

“If you want to fight, I’ll fight with you!”At this moment, Kong Yun stepped forward.

He looked at Wan Gu Qiong coldly and said, “A dog who bullies the weak and fears the strong. If you want to fight, I’ll fight with you!”

Wan Gu Qiong narrowed his eyes and said sarcastically, “Kong Yun, don’t be too smug. If your father was here, he might still have the right to speak, but you can’t.”

“F * ck you!”Kong Yun shouted loudly and immediately clenched his fist and charged at Wan Guqiong.

“Forget it.”At this time, Qiao Zun pulled Wan guqiong away.

He looked coldly at Kong Yun and snorted lightly, “Kid, you can’t be arrogant for too long. After today, you so-called young masters of the Jingdu aristocratic families will no longer exist!”

After throwing these words, Qiao Zun turned around and left with Wan guqiong.

“Damn you, if you have the ability, don’t go!”Kong Yun clenched his fist and cursed angrily.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly in his heart.

Kong Yun seemed to be more impulsive than Chang Mang.

“Many thanks.”Qin Yu cupped his hands to Kong Yun.

Kong Yun glanced at Qin Yu and snorted, “I didn’t do it to help you. I just simply didn’t like him.”

After he had said this, Kong Yun turned around and left.

Qin Yu immediately burst into laughter.

This kid was truly unpredictable.

However, no matter what, he had managed to avoid the disaster this time.

The atmosphere at the scene was somewhat strange.

Ever since the arrival of the martial saints, the air was filled with angry sparks that could ignite at any time.

Qin Yu’s eyes scanned his surroundings vigilantly as he observed the scene.

As long as he saw that things were not going well, he could only think of a way to dig out the two corpses.

As more and more people gathered at the scene, the entire venue was almost filled to the brim.

“I really don’t know what a bunch of trash like you can do here.”A martial artist from the secret realm ridiculed them with a strange tone.

“Yeah, a bunch of ants also want to covet the Spirit Stone Mine. How Ridiculous.”

“Do you really think that you can stand on equal footing with us by relying on an old fellow who has only stepped into the martial saint realm for eight lifetimes?”

“F * ck you! If anyone is unconvinced, just come out and fight!”Chang Mang shouted loudly. His entire body was filled with flames as he took the lead to stand out.

“I’m not afraid of You!”The other party did not hesitate at all as he stood up and counted the number of people.

“Then there’s no need to talk nonsense. I’ll Kill You First!”

“Boom!”

In an instant, the scene erupted into another battle!

Gu Xinghe glanced at Zhai Xing, who immediately walked out with a question.

He stretched out his palm, and a terrifying force directly split the scene into two!

Everyone was actually unable to move under this enormous force!

Such a method could not help but cause people to be greatly shocked!

Just by raising his hand, he was able to separate the two groups of people. What kind of power was this?

Even Qin Yu was amazed in his heart!

As a martial saint, this Zhai Xing’s strength was shockingly above the other martial saints!

“If Zhai Xing makes a move, senior Xu will be in trouble,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Everyone, be quiet.”Gu Xinghe swept his gaze around and said coldly.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is hosting this meeting. Naturally, we should be the ones to divide the resources.”

Everyone was silent as they waited for Gu Xinghe to continue.

Gu Xinghe cleared his throat and scanned his surroundings. However, he did not speak for a long time, as if he was deliberately keeping them in suspense.

This also made everyone present extremely nervous. They stared intently at Gu Xinghe.

Even though the martial artists of the current era were extremely disappointed with the Jingdu martial arts association, they still held a glimmer of hope in their hearts.

Gu Xinghe coughed and said faintly, “The large spirit stone mine is an ownerless thing in the world. Normally, it should indeed be divided among the various great clans and martial artists.”

Speaking up to this point, Gu Xinghe paused for a moment and changed the topic. “However... in any era, the strong preys on the weak, especially in the martial arts world.”

“Therefore, the division of resources should be based on hard power

“Now, I will split the Spirit Stone mine into two parts according to the ratio of one to nine, of which the secret realm accounts for nine.”

Hearing this, the crowd burst into an uproar!

One to nine? Such a ratio was really unacceptable!

“Damn it, I thought that Gu Xinghe would say something!”

“Trusting him is the stupidest decision I’ve ever made in My Life!”

“That’s not fair! We’ll never agree to it!”

“Gu Xinghe, you’re a F * cking Beast!”

The scene was chaotic and the argument was endless.

Gu Xinghe seemed to have expected it, so he was not surprised.

“You think I’m siding with the mystical realm, don’t you?”Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes.

“What else? If one to nine isn’t favoritism, then what is! ?”

“You call yourselves leaders of the Martial World, is this your leader! ?”

Gu Xinghe sneered, “You’re wrong, I’m favoring you!”

“If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even get ten percent! With your strength, what right do you have to get a big spiritual stone mine! ?”

The martial artists in the secret realm also shouted, “That’s right! If it weren’t for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, we could completely occupy a large spirit stone mine!”

“Don’t be ungrateful. To be able to reward you ten percent, you should be grateful!”
