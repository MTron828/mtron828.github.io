Chapter 448: Qin Yu Must Die! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This piece of news quickly spread throughout the entire Martial Arts Forum, and even overshadowed Han Wei’s news!

“Ten half-step Martial Marquises chasing after Qin Yu? Have they gone mad?”

“How could Qin Yu be worth sending out ten half-step Martial Marquises?”

“Not to mention that Qin Yu is now crippled, even when Qin Yu was at his peak back then, he wasn’t worth such a great deal of effort!”

“Heh heh, it’s just a rumor. Hong Yi Sect has already been blacklisted by Pyro. Even if they really wanted to pursue and kill him, how could they be so high profile?”

Everyone was talking about it and expressing doubt about the news.

And soon, the person who sent the message replied.

“This is the decision made by the Hong Yi Sect after evaluating Qin Yu’s strength.”

These words shocked everyone! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

What did that mean?

The Hong Yi Sect’s evaluation of Qin Yu was actually so high? Was it worth using ten half-step Martial Marquises to get rid of Qin Yu?

Wasn’t this a little too farfetched?

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown when he saw this news.

Ten half-step Martial Marquises?

Was the Hong Yi Sect crazy?

“The Hong Yi Sect really thinks highly of me.” Qin Yu frowned and muttered in a low voice.

This also made people fear the Hong Yi Sect’s strength.

To casually send out ten half-step Martial Marquises, how resourceful were they?

If it was just in terms of martial arts, even the current aristocratic families might not be able to compete with them.

“Ten half-step Martial Marquises... This really makes me worry.” Qin Yu rubbed his chin and muttered in a low voice.

Even if he had the power of the Venerable Fifth Mountain and the Divine Dragon, Qin Yu didn’t think that he could defeat ten half-step Martial Marquises.

Whether or not he could defeat even one was another matter.

‘Looks like I have to go to Dongchuan as soon as possible,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

Meng Wuxiong’s talent was mediocre, but he was able to step into the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm and even create several others.

This was enough to prove that Dongchuan was harboring a secret.

‘I’ll set off to Dongchuan tomorrow and also ask Fang Yue what’s going on,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

...

The news of Hong Yi Sect issuing a death warrant quickly spread.

Normally, this kind of matter would be handled by the Martial Arts Association.

The orders of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would be carried out by the other associations.

As the owner of the Martial Arts Forum, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association naturally found out the news at the first moment.

Ten high-level members of the Association sat at a big round table.

These people all possessed extremely high levels of authority and power.

“Everyone, have you all seen it? The Hong Yi Sect has publicly issued a death warrant.”

“Is this a challenge to Pyro’s prestige, or is this a challenge to our Martial Arts Association?”

“The Hong Yi Sect’s rampage has already reached an outrageous level.”

“Let the Guardians handle it. As long as the Hong Yi Sect dares to enter the territory, they will be killed.”

Everyone expressed their opinions, and at this moment, an extremely discordant voice came out.

“I think we should ignore it.”

The person who spoke was none other than Han Wei’s mentor, Xia Hang.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Xia Hang.

“Mr. Xia, what do you mean?” Someone asked.

Xia Hang said, “The Hong Yi Sect’s target is Qin Yu. Everyone should know who Qin Yu is.”

The crowd fell into a short silence, and no one said anything for a while.

Xia Hang continued, “According to my understanding, Qin Yu disregards the authorities, and he doesn’t have any respect. Not only did he challenge the Han and Yan families, but he also crticized the Martial Arts Association many times.”

After saying that, Xia Hang took out some documents and threw them on the table.

“These are all complaints from the Martial Arts Associations of various places.”

“The Yunchuan Martial Arts Association was ravaged up by Qin Yu, and countless people died.”

“The president of the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association was even crippled by Qin Yu.”

Many higher-ups took over the documents and started to read them carefully.

“Mr. Xia, even so, we shouldn’t just sit and do nothing.”

“Yes, even if someone is to deal with Qin Yu, it should be handled by our Martial Arts Forum, and not the Hong Yi Sect.”

Xia Hang smiled aloofly and said, “Everyone, you have to see the root of the problem.”

“In my opinion, Qin Yu’s threat far surpasses that of the Hong Yi Sect.”

“Mr. Xia, don’t joke around. Qin Yu is just an Inner Strength Grandmaster. What right does he have to be compared to the Hong Yi Sect?”

Xia Hang sneered and said, “He is an Inner Strength Grandmaster now. What about in the future?”

“Once a rebellious person like Qin Yu develops, he definitely won’t take the Martial Arts Association seriously!”

“In the future, he will even stir up trouble in the entire martial arts world for so-called fairness and justice!”

“Mr. Xia, aren’t you exaggerating?” Someone frowned.

Xia Hang snorted and said, “It seems that everyone has forgotten about that person from back then.”

At the mention of “that person”, everyone’s expression changed in unison, as if he was a person that couldn’t be mentioned.

“When he appeared at that time, we also mistakenly thought that he wouldn’t be able to make a name for himself.”

“What happened after that? He almost destroyed our Martial Arts Forum!”

Everyone fell into silence, as if they were persuaded by Xia Hang.

Xia Hang said calmly, “Qin Yu must die. The sooner he dies, the better.”

“Moreover, I have already consulted the few members of the Council Bureau, and they also agree with my actions.”

Many of the higher-ups looked at each other, then nodded and said, “Since things have already come to this, then we can only do this.”

“However, we hope that the matter can be within our control.”

Xia Hang nodded and said, “Don’t worry, the Hong Yi Sect’s target is only Qin Yu.”

After the meeting ended, Xia Hang walked out of the meeting room.

He took out his phone and called Han Meng.

“Mr. Han, don’t worry. Qin Yu won’t live for long,” Xia Hang said.

Han Meng grunted in gratitude and said, “Mr. Xia, my son said that he wants to kill Qin Yu personally in front of Yan Ruoxue. You understand what I mean.”

Xia Hang froze. He was silent for a moment before saying, “I understand. I will make a move at the critical moment and save Qin Yu’s life.”

“Not only do you have to save him, but you also have to cripple him!” Han Meng said coldly.

“Han Wei cannot lose. Otherwise, the entire Han family, and even the entire Jingdu upper class, will be humiliated!”

Xia Hang said in a deep voice, “I understand.”

After saying this, Xia Hang dialed another number.

“Immediately send someone to keep an eye on Qin Yu,” Xia Hang said coldly.
