Chapter 684: Resurrection of the Male Corpses! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu was not a fool. Of course, he could see the peculiarity of the mustache man.

“Come, tell me, what do you know and what do you want to do?” Qin Yu pulled the man with the mustache to the side, his tone filled with hostility.

The mustache man immediately fell silent. This was a rare occasion where he was so serious.

“That girl... What’s your relationship with her?” A moment later, the mustache man pointed in Xiao Yu’s direction.

Qin Yu said, “She’s my sister. What’s wrong?”

The mustache man sighed and said, “To tell you the truth, I’ve traveled north and south for so many years, up to Emperor Qin...”

“Get to the point!” Qin Yu interrupted the mustache man’s rambling.

The mustache man coughed and continued, “I once saw a portrait of the masked woman. The woman in the portrait... looks very similar to your sister.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but mutter, “It seems that there is a relationship between her and the masked woman.”

Then, Qin Yu looked at the mustache man and said, “What exactly do you know?”

The mustache man said in a deep voice, “You should know that this masked woman is not from this era. Even if she has a high cultivation level, she should have turned into a pile of yellow soil by now.”

“But... I suspect that the masked woman has been reincarnating in some way.”

“And your sister is most likely from a generation of her reincarnation!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Just as the mustache man said, even a great cultivator at the Tribulation Stage could die.

This was the law of nature, and no one could escape it. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

If it was really as the mustache man said, that the masked woman kept reincarnating, then it would really be terrifying.

“Qin Yu, the mask that you mentioned is in her hands, right?” The mustache man asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes.”

Upon hearing this, the mustache man hurriedly said, “You’d better think of a way to prevent her from awakening any memories! Otherwise, it will definitely be a disaster!”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Aren’t you being too alarmist? I know Xiao Yu very well. Although she’s a little mischievous, she has a kind heart. How could she have anything to do with a disaster...”

The mustache man said anxiously, “That’s because you don’t understand! Let me tell you, according to the information I have, this masked woman is a devil who kills without batting an eye!”

“As far as I know, she wouldn’t care even if it was her relatives and friends! Her kindness now is just a lie!”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Is it really as scary as you say?”

The mustache man muttered, “It’s absolutely true! If it’s possible, we’d better kill her in advance!”

“That’s impossible!” Qin Yu rejected the Mustache Man’s suggestion without even thinking.

“And I’m warning you, you’d better not have any ideas about her,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The mustache man sighed slightly and said, “Qin Yu, perhaps you think that she has a good relationship with you now, but in the future... Once she takes shape in the future, she will be another person!”

“When that time comes, no one will be able to suppress her. Who knows how many people will suffer!”

Qin Yu looked at the mustache man with a serious expression and then at Xiao Yu who was not far away.

“Are you willing to watch so many innocent people die at her hands?” The mustache man said in an agitated manner.

Qin Yu still did not speak.

The mustache man’s words were reasonable, but it was impossible for him to get rid of Xiao Yu.

“I’ll make sure she’s fine.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Even if it’s as you say, that one day she becomes a devil, I’ll personally suppress her.”

The mustache man sighed. “I’m just afraid that you won’t have the ability to do so by then.”

“Alright, from now on, don’t talk about this topic!” Qin Yu pointed at the mustache man and said.

“Also, don’t let Xiao Yu know about this, understand?”

The mustache couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu. He could only wave his hand and say, “Fine, fine, fine. Do as you wish. I’m too lazy to care about it.”

Qin Yu didn’t continue the topic. He took out the mask from the spatial artifact and handed it to the mustache man.

“This is the mask you wanted. Don’t waste time,” Qin Yu said.

Holding the mask, the mustache man had a complicated expression.

He was a little excited, but also a little horrified.

His horrified expression made Qin Yu very confused. Even if the mustache man knew many stories about the masked woman, they were only legends.

He had never experienced it personally, so how could he be terrified from the bottom of his heart?

“It really is her mask...” The mustache man couldn’t help but lick his lips.

“You’d better not have any ideas about this mask...” Warned Qin Yu.

The mustached man waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry. I’ve already given up on this idea just now.”

Ever since he saw Xiao Yu, the thoughts in his heart had vanished into thin air.

Even the mustache man didn’t know why.

“Then let’s begin,” Said Qin Yu.

“There is no need to hurry. We still need to repair that formation platform first. If it’s too powerful, it’ll easily destroy the formation platform,” Said the mustache man with a smile.

Qin Yu glared at the mustached man and said, “What the f*ck have you been doing?!”

The mustached man touched his nose and smiled sheepishly.

This formation platform was not complete at all because the mustache man had never really wanted to help Qin Yu before this.

Everything he had done was to confuse Qin Yu and take away the mask.

The mustache man removed the pressure on Qin Yu from the formation platform and then took out a few formation flags.

“How long will it take?” Qin Yu asked.

The mustache man stretched out a finger and said, “Three hours.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Then hurry up.”

The mustache man took the mask and returned to the formation platform.

When he passed by Xiao Yu, the mustache man subconsciously turned his head to the side.

This made Xiao Yu feel baffled.

She pointed at her nose and whispered, “Am I ugly?”

“Of course not,” Qin Yu said helplessly.

“He’s a fool. You don’t have to pay attention to him.”

Xiao Yu responded with an “oh”. She seemed to be a little sleepy. She laid on Qin Yu’s shoulder and fell asleep very quickly.

Looking at the delicate girl in front of him, Qin Yu could not connect her to the masked woman that the mustache man was talking about.

Time flew by, and three hours passed quickly.

The mustache man mended the formation platform. It looked much more complete and sturdier now.

He placed special magical artifacts around the formation platform to stabilize it so that it wouldn’t be destroyed by the powerful force.

“Alright, take out the two corpses,” Said the mustache man.

Qin Yu grunted. After he had settled Xiao Yu, he took out the corpses and placed them in the center of the formation platform.

The mustache man held a golden bowl the size of a palm in his hand and said, “I still need a trace of your blood essence to control the two corpses.”

Qin Yu did not waste any time. He immediately forced out a drop of his blood essence and dripped it into the small bowl.

The mustache man walked to the center of the formation platform. He slowly raised his hand and chanted a spell.

In a short while, a few words appeared out of thin air on the formation platform.

Streams of strange power surged from all directions and fell toward the two corpses.

Qin Yu stood silently at the side and waited quietly.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

He suddenly felt two extremely terrifying internal Qi approaching them from nearby.

“Peak of Martial Marquis!”

After feeling the two internal Qi, Qin Yu’s facial expression can not help but slightly changed.
