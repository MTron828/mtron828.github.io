Chapter 658: Xiao Yu and the Masked Woman Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

All along, the Pavilion Master had been taking care of Qin Yu, but Qin Yu knew in his heart that there was absolutely no kindness for no reason.

This question had been hidden in Qin Yu’s heart for a long time.

The Pavilion Master looked at Qin Yu and shook her head after a while.

“There’s no reason,” The Pavilion Master said in a somewhat cold tone.

Qin Yu furrowed his brows. He wanted to continue asking more questions, but the Pavilion Head did not give him the chance. She just waved her hand and said, “You should go and rest. If you are injured, you should rest well.”

Before he could finish his words, Qin Yu felt a gentle and gentle force coming toward him.

Qin Yu immediately felt a strong sense of sleepiness and within a short moment, he fell into a deep sleep.

...

At that moment, the entire Jingdu, and even the entire Pyro’s martial world, had exploded into chaos.

The news that Qin Yu was the black-robed man had spread like wildfire, and his glorious battle record had shocked everyone.

The Yan family and the Han family were the first to bear the brunt of the news. Their relationship with Qin Yu was sour. Now that they knew about Qin Yu’s high level of cultivation, they were naturally a little worried.

“That black-robed man... is actually Qin Yu.” Yan Sihai’s eyes narrowed slightly, his eyes were bursting with strong killing intent.

He looked at Yan Jinyao and said, “With your current strength, are you a match for him?”

Yan Jinyao’s expression didn’t look too good. He said in a deep voice, “Although I don’t want to admit it, it’s very difficult for me to defeat him now.”

Hearing this, Yan Sihai took a deep breath.

“This Qin Yu has already escaped death many times. We can’t allow him to continue growing his strength,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“No matter what connections we use, we must get rid of him!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was very clear that Yan Sihai was serious this time.

The contempt he had for Qin Yu all this while had allowed Qin Yu to grow to this level. Now, he could no longer sit idly by.

“Father, tomorrow I will go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and cultivate in seclusion,” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

It was very clear that this matter had dealt a great blow to Yan Jinyao.

He had already held the title of number one in the younger generation for too long. Now that he had been surpassed, Yan Jinyao couldn’t accept it at all.

It wasn’t just Yan Jinyao. All the young masters in Jingdu had the same thought.

In just one night, several young masters had chosen to cultivate in seclusion.

Some were happy, while others were sad. People like Deng Sheng and Yan Guiyi were already panicking.

They knew very well that with Qin Yu’s vengeful personality, he would never let them off.

...

In the next few days, Qin Yu stayed at Ye Qing’s residence.

The outside world was already in an uproar. Elites from all walks of life had been sent out to capture Qin Yu.

This included the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and even the official forces.

With the Yan and Han families taking action, it was almost impossible for Qin Yu to escape.

But in the blink of an eye, three days had passed and there was still no sign of Qin Yu.

They had almost turned the entire Pyro upside down and they were still unable to find Qin Yu.

“That’s really strange. Where exactly did this kid run off to?” At that moment, everyone asked.

Another three days passed.

Under the meticulous care of the Pavilion Master, Qin Yu’s injuries had almost fully recovered.

He tidied up his clothes, changed into a set of clothes, and prepared to leave.

“Lord Pavilion Master, please ensure that Commander Ye will come and get me.” Before leaving, Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly and said, “Don’t worry. Since Ye Qing has promised you, he will definitely do it.”

“Qin Yu, everyone is looking for you outside. You’d better be careful with your actions.” The Pavilion Master exhorted.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “If I’m too careful, how can they catch me?”

After saying this, Qin Yu shook his head, turned around, and left.

Since he was going to be caught, he had to make a scene. Only in this way could the Jingdu Martial Arts Association trust Xia Hang.

Therefore, Qin Yu set his sights on the Saint Confucian Sect.

This was probably the best and most reasonable way.

Before heading to the Saint Confucian Sect, Qin Yu decided to return to Chuzhou first. He planned to go and see Xiao Yu.

That mask was of great importance. There must not be any accidents.

At Chuzhou, outside Uncle Wu’s house.

Unlike the usual hustle and bustle, this place was extremely deserted today.

It was already late autumn. The fallen leaves in the courtyard added to the desolate atmosphere.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He released his divine sense and quickly caught a figure at home.

Qin Yu looked around and then strode into the room.

As soon as he entered, Qin Yu saw Uncle Wu sitting on the sofa drinking wine. He looked much older.

“Uncle Wu, what happened?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask.

Hearing Qin Yu’s voice, Uncle Wu was stunned.

He quickly got up. A hint of surprise flashed across his face, but then he panicked.

He hurriedly pulled Qin Yu and whispered, “Qin Yu, are you crazy? Everyone outside is looking for you now!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I know, Uncle Wu. I’ll leave in a while.”

Uncle Wu frowned. He closed the door tightly and then pulled Qin Yu to sit down.

“Uncle Wu, during this period... did something happen?” Qin Yu seemed to have noticed uncle Wu’s abnormality.

Uncle Wu sighed slightly and said slowly, “The Yan family interfered. I was stripped of my position. It’s already good enough that I can still live here.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He didn’t expect the Yan family to mess with these ordinary people.

“Uncle Wu, I’m sorry.” Qin Yu stood up with a somewhat apologetic look on his face.

He took out his bank card and handed it to Uncle Wu, saying, “There’s some money in here. You can use it first.”

Uncle Wu hurriedly pushed the bank card back and said, “You’re just making this difficult for me. Those people are watching me every day now.”

Hearing this, the guilt on Qin Yu’s face increased.

“You’d better take care of yourself. At least I don’t have to worry about food and drink now. I can be considered to be living a happy life.” Uncle Wu waved his hand cheerfully.

Qin Yu whispered, “Don’t worry. This kind of life won’t last long. Yan Sihai will abdicate sooner or later.”

At this point, Qin Yu looked at Uncle Wu and asked, “Where’s Xiao Yu?”

At the mention of Xiao Yu, Uncle Wu’s face became more worried.

“Ever since this child started cultivating, she seemed to have changed into a different person. Her personality became more and more strange, and her personality became much more gloomy,” Uncle Wu sighed.

When he said this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Could it be... Xiao Yu had already developed in the direction of the masked woman?

Qin Yu didn’t know much about the masked woman, but judging from the mustache man’s attitude toward her, this masked woman was probably not a good person.

“When will she come back?” Qin Yu asked.

Uncle Wu looked at his watch and said, “Soon. Is there anything you need from her?”

“No, I’m just looking for her,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Then you can wait,” Uncle Wu nodded and said.

Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

At six o’clock in the afternoon, Xiao Yu finally appeared at the door.

The moment Xiao Yu appeared, Qin Yu felt an extremely strange internal Qi.

Although this internal Qi was not very strong, it was very similar to the masked woman!
