Chapter 121: Liu Yi’s Probing Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s arrival had undoubtedly ruined the tranquil atmosphere.

Liu Shihui couldn’t help but clench his fists with an aggressive look in his eyes.

Qin Yu swept his gaze over and quickly fixed it on Liu Yi.

Then, Qin Yu walked to the opposite side of Liu Yi leisurely and sat down.

Liu Yi frowned slightly, but it was fleeting.

“You’re Qin Yu?” Liu Yi asked with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Mr. Liu, have you prepared the herbs and the contract?”

Liu Yi burst into laughter and said, “Young man, you don’t need to be in such a hurry. Have some tea first.”

After saying that, Liu Yi waved his hand and motioned for the person beside him to pour a cup of tea for Qin Yu.

“Please go ahead.” Liu Yi said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu lowered his head to take a look, then picked up the teacup and emptied it in one go.

After drinking it, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Pour another cup for Mr. Qin.” Liu Yi said with a nonchalant smile.

The person beside him hurriedly picked up the teacup again and poured a cup of water for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He put down the teacup and said, “Let’s talk about business.”

“Hehe, Mr. Qin, there’s no need to be anxious. The Liu Family never reneges on a debt. Moreover, you and Shihui are friends. The Liu Family is willing to befriend you.” Liu Yi waved his hand dismissively again.

Hearing this, Qin Yu sneered inside.

Qin Yu wouldn’t believe an old fox like him no matter what!

Liu Yi poured a cup of water for Qin Yu again and said in a casual manner, “Mr. Qin, you came from a small town like Jiangcheng, yet you have such outstanding achievements. It’s really admirable.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Mr. Liu, you’re too courteous. I’m just lucky.”

Liu Yi continued with an impassive expression, “I heard that you’re an orphan?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He was a little displeased, but he still nodded and said, “Yes.”

Liu Yi touched his chin and lamented, “Sigh, nowadays, many rich kids like to leave their families and go out into the real world to gain experience while hiding their identity. I understand.”

Hearing Liu Yi’s words, Qin Yu had a rough idea of what Liu Yi wanted to ask.

He didn’t say anything and waited for Liu Yi to continue.

Seeing that Qin Yu seemed unfazed, Liu Yi continued to ask, “Not long ago, the eldest daughter of the Yan family suddenly went to Jiangcheng to invest. This matter has caused a storm in the city.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “That’s right. Jiangcheng is just a small place. Not to mention the Yan family, but even the Liu family isn’t willing to invest.”

“Hehe, Jiangcheng indeed doesn’t have much investment value.” Liu Yi smiled and nodded.

Qin Yu fell into silence again, which made Liu Yi a little unhappy.

He probed, “Rumor has it that you are the illegitimate child of the Yan family, and this time, the Yan family came to invest for your sake.”

Qin Yu smiled.

He picked up the teacup in his hand and took a sip of tea, then said, “Mr. Liu, I have no relationship with the Yan family, and the Yan family won’t help me in any way.”

Liu Yi’s eyes lit up, but cautious by nature, he was still a little worried.

Therefore, Liu Yi pretended to be surprised and said, “That’s not possible. Miss Yan destroyed the Shen family in a rage because of you. This matter has spread throughout the entire Chuzhou.”

“That’s because the Shen family kidnapped Miss Yan. It has nothing to do with me,” said Qin Yu.

“As for the relationship between me and Miss Yan, the Yan family doesn’t approve of it.” Qin Yu didn’t hide anything.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Liu Yi finally felt relieved.

Since the Yan family didn’t approve of this relationship, then Liu Yi had nothing to worry about.

The smile on his face instantly disappeared. What replaced it was derision.

“Qin Yu, you’re still too young. You don’t have a sense of measure when doing things, and you don’t know the ways of the world. You revealed the truth too easily.” Liu Yi shook his head with some regret.

“If I were you, I would deliberately obscure my relationship with the Yan family so that others wouldn’t be able to guess it. That way, no one would take the risk to deal with you.”

“It’s a pity that you’re too stupid. You were deceived by my kind appearance and revealed the truth easily.” Liu Yi sneered.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Do you really think that I don’t know what trick you have up your sleeve? You seem polite on the surface, but in fact, every word you say is an attempt to probe my relationship with the Yan family.”

“That’s right.” Liu Yi nodded with a nonchalant smile.

“As long as you’re sure that the Yan family won’t help me, you won’t have any scruples anymore.” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

“Hahaha!” Liu Yi couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“You’re right. Unfortunately, you realized it too late.” Liu Yi shook his head with some regret.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “No, Liu Yi, I’ve long seen through your thoughts.”

“Oh? Then why did you still dare to say these things to me?” Liu Yi suddenly felt a bit worried.

He said that the Yan family wouldn’t help... but could it be a lie?

Qin Yu said indifferently, “It’s because I don’t take the Liu Family seriously at all. Even without the Yan family as support, the Liu family still isn’t worth mentioning in my eyes.”

Hearing this, Liu Yi immediately showed anger.

“You’re really stubborn. No one dares to look down on the Liu Family!” Liu Yi said coldly.

“Dad, don’t talk nonsense with him. I must kill him!” Liu Shihui stood up angrily at the side and glared at Qin Yu.

Liu Yi ignored him. He took out a box of herbs and a contract from the cabinet and placed them in front of Qin Yu.

“Everything is ready. If you have the guts, just take it,” Liu Yi said indifferently. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qin Yu looked at Liu Yi with slight amusement, and couldn’t help but laugh.

Without thinking, he took the contract and the herbs.

“Thank you for the gift from the Liu family. I will remember it,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

However, Qin Yu was stopped by three men after he took two steps.

“Hahaha, you are indeed hotheaded. Do you think it’s that easy to take something from the Liu Family?” Liu Yi couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

Qin Yu looked at the three men in front of him and sneered. “You want to stop me with just these three losers?”

“Qin Yu! You’re too arrogant!” Liu Shihui roared crazily.

“These three are all hangers-on of the Liu Family. Their strength far surpasses mine! Killing you is like slaughtering a chicken or dog for them!” Liu Shihui said coldly.

“Really? I don’t think so.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Liu Yi, who wasn’t far away, said with a nonchalant smile, “If you didn’t take the contract and medicine just now, I might have considered letting you leave the Liu family. Unfortunately, you missed this opportunity.”

After saying that, Liu Yi leaned on the sofa and casually waved his hand.

The three people immediately stretched out their hands to grab Qin Yu!

Just as Liu Shihui had said, the strength of these three people was above Liu Shihui’s. It seemed to be just a grab, but it was filled with ferocity!

Qin Yu looked at these three people coldly, and the spiritual power in his body instantly reached its peak!

He suddenly waved his large hand, and a huge force instantly surged out!
