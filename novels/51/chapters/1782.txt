1783 Make a Move on Xiao Sheng

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had devoured his primordial spirit!

His face revealed a trace of greed and satisfaction as if he was a wine lover who had just drunk some good wine.

“Qin Yu, you… What’s wrong with you?” Jue Wu noticed that something was wrong.

Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and the greed in his eyes did not reduce.

But soon Qin Yu quickly suppressed this thought.

He shook his head hard and said with a frown, “I don’t know what’s going on either. Devouring a primordial spirit… seems to be addictive.”

“Addictive?” Jue Wu’s face changed slightly as if she felt something was wrong.

“Let’s get out of here as soon as possible,” she pulled Qin Yu and said.

“Mmm.” Qin Yu responded and planned to leave the place with Jue Wu.

But at this moment, a large group of people rushed out and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

The leader was a Reversion Void Stage cultivator. He looked at Jue Wu and Qin Yu coldly and shouted, “Who are you? You dared to attack Lord Ji Si!”

The greed in Qin Yu’s heart reappeared.

His body trembled slightly. It was unknown if it was because of excitement or the primordial spirit that he was going to get

“I’ll leave that Reversion Void Stage cultivator to you.” Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu.

“No problem,” Jue Wu said.

After she finished speaking, Jue Wu whooshed away.

As for the remaining Mighty Realm cultivators, they were like delicious food in Qin Yu’s eyes!

He could no longer hold back the impulse in his heart and instantly pounced forward!

An intense battle instantly broke out in the courtyard.

Although Qin Yu’s strength was not at its peak, these mighty realm cultivators were nothing to him.

In a short two hours, the entire room was filled with corpses and blood!

Twenty-odd Mighty Realm cultivators were lying on the ground, and Qin Yu was greedily devouring their primordial spirits.

One, two, three…

In just a while, the primordial spirits of the twenty-odd Mighty Realm cultivators were all absorbed by Qin Yu!

Jue Wu stood by the side and frowned slightly. For a moment, she didn’t know what to do.

Of course, she could see Qin Yu’s abnormality. However, for some reason, Jue Wu didn’t want to stop him.

After an unknown amount of time, everyone’s primordial spirit was completely devoured by Qin Yu.

Following that, Qin Yu looked at the Reversion Void Stage cultivator.

His eyes were a little red as if he had lost his mind.

In the next second, Qin Yu immediately pounced toward this Reversion Void Stage cultivator.

He used the same technique to directly devour the primordial spirit of this Reversion Void Stage cultivator!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit had almost completely restored!

The cultivation technique of Satan was indeed terrifically powerful!

“Qin Yu, are you alright?” Jue Wu frowned.

Qin Yu shook his head, trying his best to keep his rationality.

He looked at Jue Wu, frowned, and said, “I don’t know why. I just can’t control it.”

“It’s okay, don’t think too much,” Jue Wu said in a deep voice.

At this moment, a person was standing at the entrance of the courtyard, staring at everything with a dumbfounded expression.

He swallowed his saliva, and his face was full of fear. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When he realized that he had been discovered, he turned around and wanted to run away!

Jue Wu’s brows furrowed. She reached out her small hand and instantly turned him into a pile of minced meat.

“No one should know about this,” Jue Wu said to Qin Yu.

“Once this matter is spread, you… you’ll likely get into trouble.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, ” Alright.”

Having said that, Qin Yu had an indescribable feeling in his heart.

it was as if there was a voice that kept urging Qin Yu to devour more primordial spirits.

This made Qin Yu extremely uneasy. After he had devoured so many primordial spirits, his impulse seemed to have become even stronger.

“No, if this continues, sooner or later, I won’t be able to suppress the impulse in my heart.” Qin Yu gritted her teeth.

If this continued, Qin Yu might even become a devil who would kill countless people. He would be spurned and hunted down by the entire Holy Region!

“I have to think of a way to suppress it.” Qin Yu thought as he was walking.

Jue Wu seemed to see Qin Yu’s worry. She jumped up and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder. She then said, “Alright, don’t think too much. There’s a way to solve everything!”

“Let’s go. I’ll take you around the East Continent. It’s not easy to come out, so we must relax,” Jue Wu said with a smile.

Qin Yu knew that Jue Wu was comforting him. So he gave her a grateful smile and nodded, “Alright, I’ll listen to you.”

The East Continent was a place with extremely high inclusiveness. Thus the scale of development of various industries was extremely large.

Compared to Nanzhou, the East Continent seemed to be full of vitality.

Regardless of eating, drinking, and entertainment, everything was available here.

Qin Yu followed Jue Wu to eat, drink, and sightseeing everywhere, the impulse was indeed much better.

“F*ck! There’s such a big restaurant in the East Continent!” Jue Wu pointed to a huge restaurant in front of them and said excitedly.

“Let’s go and try it. There must be delicious food here!” Jue Wu said excitedly.

The two walked to the entrance of the restaurant but were stopped by people.

“This place is not open to the public,” two men said coldly.

Jue Wu frowned. She took out ten spirit coins and handed them to the two people.

“Can you make an exception?” Jue Wu said with a smile.

The two men frowned as if they had been humiliated.

They casually threw the ten spirit coins to the side and berated, ” Get lost!”

Jue Wu said softly “It’s okay if you don’t let me in. Why must you get angry…”

She then pulled Qin Yu and ran to the back door.

“What’re you doing?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Jue Wu said mysteriously, “They don’t let us in. Let’s sneak in. There must be a lot of delicious food inside!”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and before he could stop her, Jue Wu had already jumped up and sneaked in.

Qin Yu had no choice but to sneak in with her.

At this moment, in one of the rooms of the restaurant, three people were sitting opposite each other.

Two of them were the people sent by the Tong family of Zhongzhou!

Sitting opposite them was the famous sect master of God Bless Sect in the East Continent!

“You want me to attack Xiao Sheng? Are you crazy?” The sect master of God Bless Sect frowned.

The two people said indifferently, “I heard that Xiao Sheng had planned to annex the entire Lizhou back then. However, he was stopped by the dead river and thus gave up. Now that the dead river has disappeared, I think he will make a move on you sooner or later.

“Don’t you have a plan? How glorious would it be to unify Lizhou?”

The sect master of God Bless Sect furrowed his brows tightly when he heard this.

He said in a deep voice, “Of course, I want to. But unfortunately… I’m probably not his match. I can’t even unify the East Continent, let alone Lizhou.”

“Our Tong family will naturally lend a hand,” the two men said indifferently.

The sect master of God Bless Sect glanced at them and laughed. “If that’s the case, why don’t you do it yourself? Wouldn’t that be more direct and simple? Isn’t it doing an utterly unnecessary thing?”
