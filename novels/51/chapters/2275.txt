2276 The Duel Between Two Powers of Path of Heaven

“There is another rumor, though it’s probably unlikely. The evil exterminator might be a chosen person, possibly a candidate to be the Guardian of this galaxy. Once the Guardian is fallen, the evil exterminator will become the new Guardian. However, this is not very likely, considering a Guardian might arise only once in billions of people, which makes such a possibility quite unlikely.”

Elder Guai shared another rumor.

Qin Yu’s heart ached. The fallen Guardian, wasn’t that referring to his father?

In this space at this moment, the masked woman closed her eyes and allowed the evil exterminator to come near her within ten feet of her slowly.

At this moment, the space around them had shattered.

One was the evil exterminator’s Path of Heaven, and the other was the masked woman’s Path of Nine Lifetimes.

The confrontation between the two ways had caused them to become a black hole. Even Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye failed to see through that black hole.

“Transforming body into a sword! The Sword of Path of Heaven!”

The evil exterminator’s indifferent voice resounded throughout heaven and earth. It was like the tolling of an ancient giant bell, each word carrying a profound weight.

A massive power of Path of Heaven merged into the sword, two, three, four…

Four close to the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster Path of Heaven powers merged into the Sword of Path of Heaven. Four ways merged into his body. At this moment, the continent could no longer withstand this Sword of Path of Heaven.

“How terrifying! Many exhausted their entire lives but were unable to comprehend the way of the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster. However, this person actually comprehended the four ways of the Path of Heaven! No wonder he dared to say he would kill the woman of nine lifetimes!”

Chang Ye said silently.

“The heaven’s chosen son.”

Situ Haoyue was silent for a long time before he spoke.

“Comprehending four ways of Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster in one lifetime is truly rare!”

Elder Guai could not help but sigh and say.

The masked woman’s expression was indifferent as she gently slapped her hand.

The chain of similarly massive rules of the Path of Heaven suddenly merged into her body. However, unlike the evil exterminator, the masked woman’s chain of the way carried an ancient aura, and it was unknown how long she had comprehended these ways. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

One, two, three…

Four, five…

Under a total of eight colossal light beams, this terrifying fluctuation gradually subsided.

The terrifying eight ways of ancient times suddenly merged into one. In an instant, it was as if a beast of ancient times had awakened.

The greenish-black light of the way and the evil exterminator’s white light of the Sword of the Path of Heaven intertwined. The entire space fluctuated violently, and fine cracks appeared in the incomparably solid Mystic Realm.

This terrifying fluctuation was so intense that even this secret realm, which had survived countless eras, began to falter.

“Hurry up and work together to stabilize this space. Otherwise, none can survive if this space turns into nothingness!”

Mei Li frowned as she spoke. This was the first time she spoke.

The people present were not stupid. Everyone joined hands to hold up this space.

At this moment, everyone was working together with great difficulty to form a protective barrier.

Even if they were at the utmost edge of the battle, they were like lone boats that could be destroyed at any time.

It was hard to imagine what level the two people fighting were at.

The chain of the way and the Sword of Path of Heaven shattered into countless pieces simultaneously.

The two flew backward at the same time and crashed onto the wall.

The terrifying force caused the space to tremble violently.

The masked woman stood up silently. The mask on her face fell to the ground. She slowly walked over and picked it up to put it on.

“It’s indeed Xiao Yu!”

Qin Yu’s heart raged. It was Xiao Yu’s face under the mask, but Xiaoyu did not look at Qin Yu. It was unsure if Xiao Yu had completely awakened the memories of her previous eight lifetimes.

The evil exterminator also stood up silently. His face was ashen, but his internal qi was like a tsunami. It did not weaken at all but became even more vast instead.

“The fusion of eight ancient Great Dao is indeed formidable, but under the current Path of Heaven, the ancient Great Dao rules are bound to be suppressed. What methods do you have next? I’m invincible below the tribulation. Perhaps you can use the power of the tribulation to kill me before the Path of Heaven descends.”

The evil exterminator said indifferently,

He waved his two fingers gently, and the evil exterminator’s sword fell into his hand.

Like fishing by the lakeside, he casually cast the sword with a gentle flick of his hand, and the evil exterminator’s treasured sword transformed into a presence between heaven and earth, instantly piercing through the sky.

The masked woman placed her hands on her hips and suddenly slapped the coffin with her delicate hands.

The entire space shook violently. In Qin Yu’s desolate divine eyes, a vast amount of the way surged into the coffin like a tide. Every dao technique represented the life of a cultivator. The opening of the Ghost Mansion this time had reduced the number of cultivators in this galaxy by half. It was a bloody massacre!

Even if this was the Path of Heaven, Qin Yu felt it was cruel. Human lives were like dogs.

At this moment, the evil exterminator’s sword arrived before the masked woman, and her mask suddenly shattered.

However, a strange smile appeared on her face almost at the same time.

Chang Ye’s expression suddenly froze. His palms opened, and a green sky net that shook the world descended from the sky. Countless runes on it moved like dragons, and each had the power to shake the world.

That attack was actually heading toward the evil exterminator. This unforeseen event shocked everyone.

Uncle Ling was the first to react, and his Soul Vortex gushed out.

However, at this moment, Situ Haoyue also suddenly made a move. A near-perfect power of the way of the Path of Heaven suddenly bombarded and landed on the evil exterminator.

After that, Gu Ming also instantly made his move. A skeletal magical artifact floated out of his body.

When approaching the evil exterminator, it suddenly exploded.

It was a supreme treasure of the skeletal space. The experts’ corpse qi Gu Ming had collected over the years had been condensed into it. When it exploded, it was almost similar to an attack of a peak True Saint.

At this moment, Mei Li also suddenly attacked. The sea of blood blocked the terrifying skeleton explosion.

Almost in an instant, everyone attacked with their sixth sense. No one understood why they suddenly attacked.

“Are you guys crazy?”

Uncle Ling roared.

“They seem to be controlled!”

Mei Li’s beautiful face revealed a solemn expression. She hoped the evil exterminator would win because the masked woman did not belong to their era and had no regard for human lives in the slightest.

If the evil exterminator died, no one could leave this place alive.

“Hmph.”

The evil exterminator snorted coldly. He did not seem to see the attack that was about to land on him.

The evil exterminator’s sword emitted a dazzling sword light. Its speed was even faster, and it entered her sea of consciousness.

“Hehehe!”

Suddenly, the masked woman burst into laughter. It sounded so crisp, so pure, as if a young girl catching butterflies in a field, emitting a burst of genuinely joyful and carefree laughter from the heart.”

A swirling mass of black mist suddenly began spinning violently in her hand. Qin Yu’s body was shaking violently at this moment. He could not suppress the black Qin Yu in an instant. His divine sense suddenly fell into the abyss of the Sea of Soul.
