Chapter 2734: Different Marks

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The waiter sighed seeing the mark. His eyes were instantly filled with pity as he looked at Qin Yu.

“What’s wrong with this mark?”

Qin Yu saw his expression and immediately asked.

“The 2,000 plus people who died all had this mark on their bodies. They were all people who saw the Tomb of Heavenly Sins seven days ago. According to the information I have, some people even fled to cities thousands of miles away but they still died invisibly. The entire Lingxu City is in a mess now.”

“Moreover, there’s a pattern to the deaths of these people. The more days go by, the more people die! Almost 1,000 people with the mark died on the last day, which is almost double the total number of the previous six days. People are exploring the place where the Tomb of Heavenly Sins appeared now.

Brother, you should go and take a look!”

After chatting with the waiter, Qin Yu changed rooms.

He touched the blood-red mark on his body. Could it be that this mark had exploded and claimed lives?

However, Qin Yu could not detect any energy fluctuations from this mark no matter how he probed.

Even when he checked his body, he did not find anything unusual.

The mastermind could kill Dao Realm level 9 without anyone noticing. He could even kill so many people without being discovered. If it was a person, his strength was terrifying to the extreme.

Qin Yu felt that he could not figure out anything.

It was better to go to the trading center to take a look. If the Tomb of Heavenly Sins wanted to kill everyone with the mark, then everyone would resist it.

It would be difficult for him to understand this place by himself.

Moreover, if what the waiter said was true, it might be useless no matter where he went if he did not deal with this mark.

The streets were packed with people. Most of them had solemn expressions.

Some people stared at them mockingly and laughed.

“Hey, dog! I told you not to touch those unlucky things but you didn’t listen.

See? Now you’re in trouble.”

“F*ck you. When that thing starts killing indiscriminately, I’ll see whether you still can laugh.”

“Only trash will be afraid. This is the mark that allows one to enter the Mystic

Realm. When I obtain the inheritance of this tomb, I’ll tear your mouths apart.”

Along the way, there were all kinds of topics. Almost all of them revolved around the Tomb of Heavenly Sins that had appeared seven days ago.

Moreover, Qin Yu roughly observed and found that there were quite many people who had the mark

There were people with solemn expressions along the way. However, it made sense.

Those who came to Lingxu City were virtually all here for the inheritance.

Many people spent their entire lives obtaining a complete inheritance. Many people also soared to the sky because of it.

“Form a team to explore the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. Requirement: Dao Realm level 5 and above.”

“Information regarding the origin of the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. The cost is 100 ore.”

“Recruiting Formation Masters to break the array at the Tomb of Heavenly

Sins. ”

At the moment, almost all the information in the trading center was related to the Tomb of Heavenly Sins.

All kinds of true and false information were mixed in, making people dazzled.

This time, the Tomb of Heavenly Sins had caused too much trouble. Nearly 2,000 people had died in a week because of the tomb.

Hence, the most popular topic in Lingxu City now was practically inseparable from this tomb. Of course, many people took advantage of the situation. They wanted to take advantage of this popularity to make a fortune. For a moment, the dense flow of people gave Qin Yu a headache.

“Little brother, you seem to have encountered some problems. Do you need help?”

A man with a slightly sloppy appearance had a wretched smile on his face. His teeth which were stuck with chives emitted a disgusting smell. “Big Brother, don’t get so close. I don’t need your help.”

Qin Yu quickly poked the oily head with his finger.

“Brother, don’t stand on ceremony. I’m a local who grew up here. I’m not bragging, but I can help you filter any information you want. Although there seems to be a lot of information here, 80% are useless. I only need a third-grade Saint Crystal.”

“I don’t need your help.”

Qin Yu waved his hands repeatedly as if he were chasing away flies. He had encountered many such people along the way. There were all kinds of braggarts.

Moreover, the price of a piece of third-grade Saint Crystal was a bit ridiculous. According to the ratio of 1:100, this price was already a bit heaven-defying.

“Little brother, how about this? I, Wang Da, have the best reputation here. I’ll lead the way for you first. If you’re satisfied with the information then only you pay me. If you’re not satisfied, you can leave. I won’t lie.”

Wang Da hugged Qin Yu’s arm with a pitiful look. It seemed that he did not make a successful deal today.

“Alright then. If you’re trying to fool me, I’ll leave.”

Qin Yu said unhappily.

“I want the most accurate information about the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. Remember not to give me any random information.”

Qin Yu said with an attitude of giving it a try.

“No problem, but you have to know that the cost won’t be low if you want the most accurate information. Are you sure you can afford it?”

Wang Da stroked his beard.

“Lead the way.”

Wang Da led the way. After a few twists and turns, they arrived in front of an inconspicuous stall.

An old man crossed his legs, placed one hand on the table, and almost fell asleep.

Qin Yu stared at Wang Da suspiciously. “Is this the reliable information you mentioned?”

‘You can’t judge a book by its cover.”

Wang Da patted the old man’s face mysteriously. “Old man, business is here. Get up quickly! Don’t sleep!”

“Oh! Okay!”

The old man suddenly woke up and his eyes were bright.

He looked surprised. Then he muttered, “Counting the past and future, observing the heavenly secrets, and predicting the future!”

“Eh? Little brother, I see that you have the talent of a celestial being. I have a thousand-year-old ancient book here. We are fated to meet today.”

Qin Yu turned around and left with a dark face. Wang Da quickly pulled him back.

“Old man, cut the crap. He wants information about the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. If you have any useful information, hurry up and tell him. This is a

business that we have worked so hard to get. Don’t ruin it.”

“Oh! That’s what you want. This thing can’t be touched. Of course, I have the information. Twenty third-grade Saint Crystals and I’ll give you some basic information about the Tomb of Heavenly Sins.”

The old man didn’t seem to have any expectations for this business. He crossed his legs and drank his tea again.

“Da*n old man, you’re crazy!”

Wang Da’s face was full of exasperation. He had better just rob than offer twenty pieces of third-grade Saint Crystal. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

ft?venty pieces of Saint Crystals fell onto the old man’s table. A powerful aura erupted from them.

“This is your reward. You can leave now.”

Qin Yu threw another piece at Wang Da, who had a dumbfounded look on his face.

“Interesting.. Why did you spend so much money to buy this information?”
