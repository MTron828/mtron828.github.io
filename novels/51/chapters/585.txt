If Qin Yu didn’t die, Han Wei’s cultivation would probably stop here!

This would be an unbearable loss for the Han family!

Qu Xie had obviously guessed Han Meng’s intentions. He smiled and said, “Since you have come to me, I will naturally satisfy you.”

Han Meng was instantly overjoyed and hurriedly nodded. “Thank you very much, President Qu.”

Qu Xie snickered inside. They had planned to get rid of Qin Yu anyway, but they hadn’t expected to earn a favor from the Han family for nothing.

...

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was Monday.

On this morning, many people had gathered at the entrance of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“I didn’t expect that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would open their training to the public.” Zhuang Teng, who was standing in the crowd, couldn’t help but sigh.

“Yeah.” Chu Heng was also slightly surprised.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has always monopolized resources. Other than their members, no one else could get their hands on them. What they did this time was really surprising.”

“Young Master Yan is here.” At this moment, someone saw Yan Jinyao not far away.

As the top dog of the younger generation in Jingdu, his appearance naturally attracted countless gazes.

Zhuang Teng and Chu Heng also walked over.

“Young Master Yan.” Zhuang Teng greeted Yan Jinyao.

Yan Jinyao nodded and didn’t say anything.

“Young Master Yan, I heard that Qin Yu will also participate this time,” Chu Heng said, intentionally or unintentionally.

Zhuang Teng chuckled and said, “Qin Yu is really quite something. He outdid us on the rankings. He really surprised us.”

Yan Jinyao glanced at them and said indifferently, “There’s nothing to be surprised about. Every generation will have a wunderkind that suppresses other geniuses.”

Zhuang Teng said with some surprise, “Young Master Yan, are you saying that Qin Yu is the wunderkind of our generation?”

Yan Jinyao sneered and said, “That’s only to you guys. To me, he’s not.”

Yan Jinyao’s words were extremely arrogant, and he also belittled Zhuang Teng and the others.

A hint of awkwardness flashed across Zhuang Teng and Chu Heng’s faces, but they didn’t say anything.

Just as the few of them were conversing, a girl walked over from not far away.

This girl had a sexy figure and a drop-dead gorgeous appearance.

And that unique temperament of hers made people unable to help but take a few more glances.

“Miss Yao.” Zhuang Teng bowed slightly.

The girl who was called Miss Yao also greeted politely, “Mr. Zhuang.”

This person was one of the top martial artists in Jingdu, Yao Meng! She was also the only young woman who had stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm!

“Miss Yao’s talent really makes others envious.” Chu Heng sighed slightly.

“Yeah, we put our lives on the line to cultivate, but we were suppressed by Miss Yao.”

“If it wasn’t for this ranking update, I’m afraid we wouldn’t have known that Miss Yao had already stepped into the second level of the Martial Marquis Realm.”

In the face of everyone’s praise, Yao Meng smiled politely and said, “Everyone is overpraising me. I was just lucky and relied on my privileged resources.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“If we’re talking about talent, I think that Qin Yu is even more surprising. He only took a year to step into the Martial Marquis Realm, right?”

Chu Heng said with some surprise, “Miss Yao also knows Qin Yu?”

Yao Meng smiled and said, “Qin Yu’s name has long spread throughout Jingdu. It’s hard not to know. Speaking of which, I really want to see what kind of person he is.”

Speaking of the devil, Qin Yu arrived.

At this moment, Qin Yu appeared at the entrance of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Qin Yu’s appearance attracted countless gazes!

Everyone looked at Qin Yu in unison. Their gazes were filled with unspeakable hostility and killing intent!

Faced with everyone’s hostility, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid at all. He walked slowly, as if he was strolling in a leisurely courtyard.

“Qin Yu, this isn’t a place you can come to!” At this moment, someone suddenly shouted!

Following that, a young man strode out, and his entire body was filled with killing intent!

“I knew someone would be restless,” Zhuang Teng said with a smile.

“His name is Hou Sheng, and he’s ranked ninth on the list. At the same time, he is Yan Guiyi’s disciple. His provocation isn’t surprising.”

Yao Meng, her beautiful eyes staring at Qin Yu with interest, remained silent.

Hou Sheng strode toward Qin Yu. He looked down at Qin Yu and said coldly, “How dare a lowly commoner like you come and get your hands on top-grade resources! Are you worthy?”

Qin Yu glanced at Hou Sheng and sneered. “Lowly commoner? Top-grade resources? Where do you get your sense of superiority from? By relying on your foul mouth?”

Hou Sheng said furiously, “I rely on my iron fists!”

Hou Sheng’s fists shone with light!

Then, he clenched his fists tightly and smashed them towards Qin Yu with violent inner strength!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. A golden light instantly rose up and he met Hou Sheng head-on!

“Boom!”

A deafening sound instantly spread across the entire square!

Then, Hou Sheng retreated more than ten steps in succession!

On the other hand, Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch.

“With your little ability, you dare to cause a ruckus?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hou Sheng was somewhat embarrassed. He snorted coldly and said, “Humph, it seems that a lowly commoner like you has some strength, but you’re only so-so.”

After saying these words, Hou Sheng turned his head and was about to leave.

“Stop.” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hou Sheng stopped and said coldly, “What?”

“You rashly attacked me, and now you want to leave just like that?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hou Sheng narrowed his eyes and said, “What, do you also have the temper of a lowly commoner? I can leave just like that. What can you do to me?”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu laughed coldly.

A golden light appeared on his body and he appeared in front of Hou Sheng in the blink of an eye!

His speed was so fast that Hou Sheng didn’t even have time to react before Qin Yu’s palm had already slapped down!

“Boom!”

The huge golden palm ruthlessly slapped onto Hou Sheng’s body!

This palm was extremely powerful and it smashed Hou Sheng’s body into pieces, causing fresh blood to drip out.

Even the ground of the square had cracks appearing one after another!

The sudden change of events caused everyone to turn their heads to watch, and they couldn’t help but mutter softly.

“They’re fighting! They’re fighting!”

“The one who attacked seems to be Qin Yu! The one who was beaten seems to be Yan Guiyi’s disciple!”

Qin Yu looked at Hou Sheng coldly, and said with a sneer, “The lowlife that you speak of has now trampled you under his feet. Do you feel that you’re full of superiority now?”

After he was slapped to the ground in front of so many people, Hou Sheng’s expression immediately became extremely ugly!

“You lowly commoner, let go of me quickly!” Hou Sheng shouted angrily.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed. He picked up Hou Sheng with one hand and his other hand flashed with a golden light. He slapped Hou Sheng’s face!

“Who are you calling a lowly commoner?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hou Sheng’s face flushed. He gritted his teeth and said, “You lowly commoner, you...”

“Slap!”

Without saying a word, Qin Yu slapped him on the face again.

“Who are you calling a lowly commoner?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Hou Sheng opened his mouth, but he braced himself and said, “You b*stard...”

“Slap!”

Before Hou Sheng could finish, Qin Yu slapped him again!

This slap sent Hou Sheng flying.

His body spun 360 degrees in the air and finally fell to the ground.

“You’d better put away your sense of superiority. These few slaps will be a lesson to you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“If you dare to call me a lowly commoner in the future, I promise to pull out your tongue!”
