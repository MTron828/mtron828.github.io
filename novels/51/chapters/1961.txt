1962 Treacherous Villain

“Please wait a moment.” Without hesitation, the two immediately sent someone to report.

In a short while, the guard returned and invited Qin Yu into the city with great respect.

After they arrived at the palace in the city, the city lord arranged for Qin Yu to rest in a lounge. A few minutes later, the city lord appeared in front of Qin Yu.

This city lord wasn’t powerful, only at the Early-stage of the Reversion Void. However, he had an extraordinary appearance and disposition.

“You are Qin Yu?” The city lord was tremendously enthusiastic when he saw Qin Yu.

“Yes, City Lord,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

The city lord quickly put on a terrified expression and shook his head repeatedly, “Mr. Qin, you’re too polite. It’s my great fortune to be able to meet you. May I know Mr. Qin’s intention to come to my city?”

Qin Yu did not hide anything and immediately told the city lord his intention. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You want us to send you to the Yao family?” the city lord muttered.

“Well, you can just inform the Yao family,” Qin Yu said.

“That’s not a problem. This place isn’t far from the Yao family. At most, it will take a day to arrive,” the city lord said.

He thought for a while and said, “However, I can’t make the decision for such a big matter. I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble Mr. Qin to wait. I have to go and report.

“Sure, no problem.” Qin Yu agreed without hesitation.

“Alright, I’ll send someone to the Yao family to report this matter!” the city lord said.

Qin Yu agreed, but he was still worried.

After all, no one knew what attitude the Yao family would adopt.

Moreover, if the city lord were to reveal this matter, the Si family would probably arrive even faster.

Therefore, after the city lord left, Qin Yu began to activate his secret technique and again created a clone in case of emergency.

After doing this, Qin Yu took some herbs from his Spatial Magic Atifact and prepared to refine a few medicinal herbs.

The sky was getting dark, and Qin Yu was still sitting cross-legged in the middle of the night.

Due to the injuries on his body, his internal qi was extremely unstable, and his control of the spiritual fire was also tremendously poor. Thus he failed to refine several times.

“I can’t go on like this.” Qin Yu frowned.

He didn’t have many herbs on hand, to begin with. So he couldn’t continue to fail.

Just as Qin Yu took out the herbs and was about to continue refining, he heard a slight movement outside.

Qin Yu frowned and looked out of the window alertly.

“Who’s that?” As Qin Yu spoke, he adjusted his internal qi, planning to escape.

At this moment, a young man sneakily pushed open the door.

He looked around and walked up to Qin Yu after ensuring no one was around.

Seeing the young man in front of him, Qin Yu frowned and said, “You are… the guard earlier in the day?”

“That’s right. Mr. Qin, you have to leave quickly,” the guard said nervously.

“Why?” Qin Yu asked in confusion.

The guard whispered, “I was outside the city gate during the day. I happened to overhear the city lord’s conversation. He has sent someone to the Si family to inform them about you. I’m afraid it will be too late! If you don’t leave now.

Upon hearing his words, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

As expected, the city lord wanted to curry favor with the Si family!

“Why did you tell me this?” Qin Yu looked at the guard and said coldly.

“I don’t have time to explain it to you now. In short, if you don’t leave now, you really won’t be able to leave!” the guard said anxiously.

Qin Yu was not in the mood to continue asking questions, so he hurriedly followed him out of the lounge.

The two moved forward, and the journey was quite smooth.

After arriving at the city gate, the two walked out from the gate easily because of the guard’s identity.

“Mr. Qin, please follow me. I know a station not far away,” the guard said.

“Alright,” Qin Yu answered, then quickly followed the guard.

Along the way, the two were extremely fast as if they were escapees.

However, after walking for tens of stars, the guard suddenly stopped.

“Why aren’t you moving?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

The guard sighed, then turned around and said, “Mr. Qin, do you know how foolish our city lord is?”

“What?” Qin Yu was stunned. “What do you mean?”

“Sigh! I suggested today that we capture you and hand you over to the Si family to be acknowledged by them. However, not only did our city Lord disagree, he even gave me a good scolding.” The guard kept shaking his head and sighing.

Qin Yu’s face instantly turned a little ugly.

“I have no choice. I can only think of a way to trick you out of the city.” The guard’s voice turned cold, and he sneered.

Before his voice faded, several people walked out from the dark. These people all had unfriendly expressions and extraordinary internal qi.

“Mr. Qin, human beings die in pursuit of wealth, and birds die in pursuit of food. I’m sorry,” the guard said indifferently.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “It’s only one day. Even if you want to inform the Si family, I’m afraid you can’t make it in time, right?”

“You’re right,” the guard didn’t deny. He smiled and said, “That’s why I could only contact several top-notch martial artists to capture you for the time being.”

“Hehe,” Qin Yu sneered and said. “Since you’re not a Semi-Saint, do you think a few of you can stop me?”

...

“That’s right. We couldn’t do anything to you if you were at your peak. But now you’re seriously injured and can’t even use one-tenth of your strength, right?” The guard raised his head and laughed.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and knew things were not looking good.

As the guard said, Qin Yu could not even control his spiritual fire. His internal qi was extremely weak that he couldn’t fight at all.

“Mr. Qin, I’m sorry to offend you!” The guard snorted and waved his hand. A few people rushed toward Qin Yu!

Enduring the pain in her body, Qin YU forcibly mobilized the internal qi in his body and clenched his fist to receive the attack. For a moment, a golden radiance brightened the night, and a violent internal qi kept drifting away.

However, Qin Yu’s injuries were too severe. Even though he managed to push them back with great difficulty, he was soon exhausted.

“As expected of Mr. Qin. Even with such severe injuries, you still possess such terrifying strength,” the guard sighed and said.

“Unfortunately, it won’t be long before you lie down without us doing anything.”

“If it was just for fortune, why don’t you let me go?” Qin Yu gritted her teeth and said. “I can give you what the Si family gives you!”

“Hahaha! I think you’d better forget about it. If you’re really that capable, how were you forced into such a state by the Si family?” The guard sneered repeatedly.

“Moreover, the Si family is one of the nine great aristocratic families! You’re just a rogue cultivator. How can you compare yourself to them?”

...

Qin Yu opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but his vision began turning blurry.
