Chapter 1169: Chapter 1,169, the great battle against Gu Xinghe 

Qin Yu walked out from the ruins.

He looked at his own body and could not help but smile coldly.

The improvement brought by this blood was really terrifying.

No wonder everyone in the world went crazy over it!

The mark that was raised up did not even leave a single white mark. The degree of terror of this body had far exceeded one’s imagination!

Not far away, Gu Xinghe’s pupils shrank.

He lowered his head to look at his palm, as if he could not believe that this scene was real.

“He has indeed absorbed the blood. It seems that Yan Yongfu was right!”Su Qi shot backward and said in a low voice.

Gu Xinghe’s expression gradually turned ugly. Facing Qin Yu’s strength, he no longer dared to hide anything.

“It seems that it will be very difficult to kill you today if you don’t show your true strength,”Gu Xinghe said coldly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Qin Yu stood in the distance in the air. There was no sadness or joy on his face. The way he looked at Gu Xinghe was more like he was looking at a clown.

This look made Gu Xinghe extremely unhappy!

Back when he was still a half-step martial saint, Qin Yu had been in this posture.

Now that he had the strength of a mighty figure, Qin Yu was still in this State!

“I should have killed you back then...”Gu Xinghe regretted it!

If he had known this would happen, he would have killed Qin Yu! Instead of torturing him!

Streams of internal Qi swept over Gu Xinghe’s body.

A terrifying aura spread out from Gu Xinghe’s body and engulfed the entire divine alchemist pavilion!

This was the most powerful internal Qi that everyone had ever seen! That terrifying pressure shook the air and caused it to Rumble!

Qin Yu’s feet trembled and he stopped in his tracks.

He stretched out his hands and felt the internal Qi coming from Gu Xinghe’s body. It was as if he was feeling a gentle breeze. Not only was he not afraid, he even enjoyed it.

“Let’s end this quickly.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly said a few words.

Gu Xinghe’s pupils constricted. He suddenly had a bad feeling!

End this as soon as possible? Why was Qin Yu so confident in saying these four words? Could it be that he was hiding his strength?

Qin Yu, who was in the air, turned to look at Jiang he.

“Senior Jiang he, I have successfully comprehended the fifth level of the ‘Dou’formula,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Before he could finish his sentence, Qin Yu’s mind moved, and a golden ‘Dou’character suddenly burst out from between his brows!

This skill was the fifth level of the ‘Dou’Formula!

With the support of the fifth level of the ‘Dou’formula, Qin Yu’s strength instantly increased by dozens of times!

The originally calm internal Qi started to become extremely agitated!

It was as if a calm lake had turned into a stormy sea!

The golden light burst out from under Qin Yu’s feet and instantly suppressed Gu Xinghe’s internal Qi!

“What a terrifying internal Qi!”Su Qi’s expression changed drastically and a trace of fear flashed across her snow-white face!

“President Gu, it’s better to retreat quickly. The current Qin Yu can no longer be compared to him,”Su Qi said in shock.

However, how could gu Xinghe be willing to leave just like that? He glared at Qin Yu who was not far away and shouted, “You’re just playing tricks. A mere martial saint, I’d like to see how capable you are!”

After he finished speaking, Gu Xinghe raised his palm and spiritual power rapidly gathered towards his palm!

In an instant, it was as if a rising sun had appeared on his hand. This ray of light was incomparably scorching and illuminated the world.

“Nine stars Saint Explosion!”

Gu Xinghe let out a furious roar. Then, his fists were like iron hammers as he swung them at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu no longer had the mood to continue fighting. This Gu Xinghe’s actions were vicious and he had to kill him today.

Moreover, this battle word formula could only be maintained for five minutes at most. After five minutes, it was hard to say who was stronger or weaker.

Therefore, the veins on Qin Yu’s right fist bulged. All the golden radiance flowed along his arm like a stream of water and surged towards his fist!

“One punch can break ten thousand arts!”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and raised his hand to use his trump card!

The dragon-like fist light burst out, and Qin Yu bent his arm, then smashed forward!

At this moment, the entire Divine Alchemist Pavilion was split into two. Even with the protection of the formation, it was useless. In an instant, it cracked.

The light penetrated a few hundred meters, and the mountains and rivers shattered in an instant, shaking everyone’s ears!

Yao Qing, who was the weakest among them, had blood oozing out of his ears and his mouth.

The two techniques finally clashed at that instant. The golden light blotted out the sky and the Sun. The instant they clashed, it drowned Gu Xinghe’s nine star Saint Explosion. It lasted for less than a second!

“Not good!”Gu Xinghe’s expression changed drastically!

At that moment, he felt uneasy. He turned around and escaped into the void, trying to dodge the punch!

However, Qin Yu had already seen through his intentions. He could see the radiance between his brows. The desolate God’s eyes lit up as he looked straight at Gu Xinghe.

Following that, Qin Yu swung his fist again and punched out a second punch!

This second punch was even more powerful than the first punch. Even the void in this world was vibrating, as if it was about to collapse at any moment.

“Ka-cha!”

Finally, the void could not withstand it anymore and distorted at that moment.

Gu Xinghe, who was hiding in the void and planning to escape, fell out from the shock.

The moment he fell out of the void, he saw a light that was like the sun rapidly expanding in his pupils.

“Not good!”

Gu Xinghe’s expression immediately changed! His body was quickly covered in a layer of dark green light, completely covering his body!

This was the green crystal godly armor collected by the eight high-level officials. It was said to be able to withstand the might of a mighty figure and save one’s life!

“Boom!”

The fist qi completely enveloped Gu Xinghe.

At this moment, the Green Crystal Godly armor was covered in cracks and then shattered one after another!

Gu Xinghe was sent flying for thousands of meters! It left a long scar on the ground, and Qinghe town seemed to have been split into two at this moment!

The ruins fell on Gu Xinghe’s body. When the dust had dispersed, the ragged gu Xinghe could be seen.

The Green Crystal Godly armor on his body shattered one by one, leaving only pieces of broken armor sticking to his body.

Fresh blood flowed out of his pores, and a ghastly white bone was revealed on his right chest. Half of his face was also disfigured from the beating.
