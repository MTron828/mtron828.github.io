An open mystic realm didn’t need any mystic keys at all!

In this way, Qin Yu could directly open this mystic realm!

Qin Yu’s face was filled with unconcealable excitement, and Zhuo Jing was the same.

“An open mystic realm. In this way, we can easily enter,”Zhuo Jing said.

But at this moment, Qin Yu was somewhat vigilant.

He looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “An open mystic realm. How could no one discover it?”

Hearing this, Zhuo Jing also felt a bit strange.

There were countless experts in the holy region. It was simply not comparable to Earth.

Even the mystic realm on earth had been mostly exploited by the JINGDU Dance Association, let alone this holy region?

“This mystic realm has either been discovered by someone, or it’s... extremely dangerous!”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Zhuo Jing nodded slightly in agreement.

Then, he looked at Qin Yu and said, “What do you plan to do? I’ll listen to you.”

With Qin Yu’s personality, there was no need to think about it. As long as he was discovered, no matter how dangerous it was, he would not give up.

Therefore, he smiled and said, “Let’s open this mystic realm first.”

Having said that, Qin Yu did not waste any more words. He placed his palm on it and waited for the mystic realm to open.

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that when he placed his hand on it, the void in front of him suddenly began to collapse! Like glass shards, they fell one by one!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu hurriedly pulled Zhuo Jing and shot him hundreds of meters away!

He looked coldly at the collapse of the Void, and his face became even colder.

In a moment, the mystic realm appeared in front of everyone.

Contrary to Qin Yu’s imagination, this seemed to be a treasure cave that had been artificially hidden. It was not a mystic realm at all.

Soon, a huge treasure cave appeared in front of the two of them.

It stood in the desert, looking extremely dazzling and out of place.

“What... What’s going on? !”Zhuo Jing could not help but stare with his mouth agape.

The treasure cave was extremely grand and vast. It seemed to have been silent in this place for many years!

When the treasure cave appeared, an ominous feeling enveloped the hearts of the two of them.

“Looks like this isn’t some mystic realm.”Qin Yu took a deep breath, feeling even more puzzled.

Someone had clearly come here and used a secret technique to hide it after excavating it.

“Someone has discovered this treasure cave... who could that person be...”Qin Yu’s expression became uglier and uglier. He couldn’t help but think of Xiao Sheng.

“Dragon burial cave...”Zhuo Jing stared at the three big words on the treasure cave and muttered in a low voice.

In the next second, Zhuo Jing’s expression became somewhat unnatural.

“This... is actually... Dragon burial cave...”Zhuo Jing’s body trembled slightly, as if he had discovered something extremely terrifying.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “Do you know this place?”

Zhuo Jing grunted and said in a trembling voice, “I once saw this place in an ancient book. No, to be precise, there are two places.”

“One is called the dragon burial cave, and the other is called the immortal burial valley.”Zhuo Jing took a deep breath.

“These two places are extremely terrifying. As the name suggests, you should understand something.”

Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing in confusion, as if he didn’t understand.

The names of these two places sounded extremely terrifying, but whether or not it was what he thought it was, he didn’t know.

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “The immortal burial valley is rumored to be the place where immortals fall. Even true immortals can’t walk out of the immortal burial valley.”

“As for the Dragon Burial Cave, it’s the place where the Divine Dragon fell. If the divine dragon flies past this place, it will definitely become a corpse. This place is extremely dangerous, and it’s hard to find a living person.”

After listening to Zhuo Jing’s words, Qin Yu’s expression also became a little unnatural.

Regardless of whether it was the Dragon God or the true immortal, they were all legendary existences. Up until now, Qin Yu had never seen them before.

The names of these two places did indeed sound very frightening. Not only that, the aura emitted from the dragon burial cave was also extremely cold, making people feel extremely uncomfortable.

Unease filled their hearts. For a moment, neither of them dared to act rashly.

This was a feeling that arose spontaneously from the bottom of their hearts. They simply couldn’t resist it.

The longer it took, the more intense the fear became.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t resist it at all.

His forehead was drenched in sweat, and Zhuo Jing’s body was even trembling slightly.

“Are we... going to leave?”Zhuo Jing tried to ask after a long while, as if he couldn’t bear the pressure anymore.

Qin Yu wiped the sweat off his forehead and murmured, “Is this the dragon burial cave that Xiao Sheng wants me to take pictures of...”

“If that’s the case, Xiao Sheng really wants you to die!”Zhuo Jing was rarely excited.

“Qin Yu, we’d better leave this place. With those people’s methods, it’s impossible that they didn’t find the Dragon Burial Cave!”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He was a bit conflicted.

At any time or place, risks and opportunities always coexisted.

The Dragon Burial Cave was indeed dangerous, but there was probably something extremely important buried here.

If he could get a set of dragon bones, the benefits would be unimaginable!

Zhuo Jing seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s thoughts. He said in a deep voice, “If you want to go in, I can accompany you. But this place is indeed extremely dangerous. It’s better to be... careful.”

Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and said with a smile, “I understand. I know what to do.”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s face suddenly changed!

He subconsciously looked behind him, feeling extremely uncomfortable. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“What’s Wrong?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu said coldly, “There must be someone in the dark, secretly watching me. There must be a pair of eyes. My feeling is definitely not wrong!”

“Is it that mysterious person just now?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu shook his head, “I don’t know, but I’m sure that there must be someone in the dark who is watching me and is extremely powerful.”

Even the desolate God’s eye could not detect him. This was enough to prove that his strength was far above Qin Yu’s.

Ever since he learned about the east barren, everything seemed to have become strange.

“Are we still going?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin yuen replied, “We’re already here. We can’t just leave empty-handed. Listen to my command later.”

“Okay.”Zhuo Jing nodded and agreed.

The two of them walked towards the direction of the dragon burial cave with difficulty.

The closer they were, the more uneasy they felt.

This feeling came from their natural sense of danger. They had not even stepped into the dragon burial cave, but they already felt such a strong sense of danger. This was enough to show that the danger of the dragon burial cave was beyond imagination!

The two of them walked all the way to the dragon burial cave. Faced with the enormous treasure cave, the powerful sense of oppression made it difficult for them to breathe.

This was a feeling that Qin Yu had never felt before. It was incomparably terrifying.
