Chapter 411: Spending Money to Create Hype? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Wei Ming standing in front of Qin Yu made Qin Yu feel touched.

Although Wei Ming was initially in it for Qin Yu’s potential, in fact, Qin Yu’s potential didn’t bring anything to Wei Ming at all.

“Uncle, kill him quickly! Break his legs first, then lock him up in the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association, and let him spend the rest of his life in prison!” Guan Kai gnashed his teeth and said.

Guan Jiarong’s expression became even uglier!

Over the years, he had indeed done a lot of vicious deeds on the basis of his identity and status.

As long as someone offended the Guan family, he would be charged with a crime and brought into the Martial Arts Association’s Prison!

But since Qin Yu heard this, how could he hold back?

“Guan Jiarong, you really abused your power to the extreme,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Guan Jiarong’s forehead immediately broke out in a layer of sweat.

“How dare you talk to my uncle like that?” Guan Kai kept shouting.

Guan Jiarong glared at Guan Kai fiercely and berated, “Shut up! Don’t talk nonsense. When have I ever done those things?!”

Guan Kai said in a daze, “Uncle, what’s wrong with you? Aren’t there many people in our prison? There are also a few women that you like quite much...”

Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer.

He appeared in front of Guan Jiarong almost instantly!

Before Guan Jiarong could react, Qin Yu punched Guan Jiarong’s chest!

“Pfft!”

He spat out a mouthful of blood and several of his sternum were broken!

However, Qin Yu didn’t stop there. He raised his palm and a wave of internal qi instantly rushed over!

“Bang! Bang!”

The sound of explosions came from his knees! Guan Jiarong’s lower body was crippled!

“Ah!!!”

The pain made Guan Jiarong raise his head and roar!

The gruesome scene was unbearable to look at!

“Qin Yu, you... you’re so vicious!” Guan Jiarong roared angrily.

Qin Yu sneered. “This is vicious? Have you ever thought about the pain of those people who were bullied by you?”

Guan Jiarong was in so much pain that he almost cried.

However, Guan Jiarong’s remaining rationality told him that he couldn’t challenge Qin Yu at this time.

Otherwise, Qin Yu might really kill him!

“Mr. Qin, I... I know I was wrong!” Guan Jiarong quickly came back to his senses.

“I’ll let everyone go immediately. I’m... willing to make up for it!”

Qin Yu looked at Guan Jiarong coldly, and killing intent rose from the bottom of his heart.

But in the end, Qin Yu didn’t kill him.

After all, the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association was a huge organization. If the president died just like that, it would cause an uproar.

Qin Yu looked at Guan Jiarong coldly and said, “Scram! If I find out that you continue to do evil, I promise I will make you pay the price.”

Guan Jiarong gritted his teeth and nodded desperately. “Yes, yes, I understand...”

Guan Kai, who was beside him, was scared silly. He had never seen such a scene before.

The lower half of his body exploded? What kind of method was this? It was too scary!

“Get the h*ll out of here!” Guan Jiarong glared at Guan Kai and shouted angrily.

A few people carried Guan Jiarong out in a flurry.

Once out of the private room, Guan Jiarong shouted anxiously, “Go to the hospital! Go to the hospital!”

...

In the private room, Wei Ming was dumbfounded.

Qin Yu looked rather indifferent.

He poured a glass of wine for Wei Ming and said, “What business are you in now?”

Only then did Wei Ming come back to his senses and hurriedly said, “I’m in the business of stone gambling now. The business will open in about half a month.”

“Stone gambling...” Qin Yu thought for a moment.

Then, he looked at Wei Ming and said, “Go look for Jiang Gu tomorrow. I’ll inform him.”

Wei Ming hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, okay. I understand.”

Wei Ming finished this meal very uneasily.

Because in his opinion, the Qin Yu in front of him was no longer the Qin Yu who was once on par with him.

After the meal, the two of them dispersed.

Before they left, Qin Yu called out to Wei Ming.

“It’s better not to waste your talent. If you really can’t do it, come and help me,” said Qin Yu.

Wei Ming smiled and said, “I understand, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu’s actions were getting more and more attention.

Even though Guan Jiarong was crippled in the private room, the news spread.

Qin Yu became a desperado in the eyes of the public.

His high-profile actions made people feel a sense of alarm.

...

In a dark office in Jingdu, a few figures hidden in the darkness seemed to be discussing something.

“Qin Yu has already gone beyond our control,” someone spoke first.

“No one is allowed to challenge the authority of our association. Otherwise, our dominant position in the martial arts world will decline.”

“This kind of person can only be eliminated or used by us.”

The crowd fell into silence. Qin Yu was regarded as a radicalist.

“Let’s wait. The Yan family and the Han family will eliminate him.”

“What if they fail?”

“I don’t think they will fail. It’s impossible for just one person to topple these two big aristocratic families. No one can do it.”

They jumped to conclusions with just a few sentences.

...

The next day, Qin Yu looked at the various comments on the Martial Arts Forum, and the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but curl up into a sneer.

During this period of time, there had been a flurry of comments on the Martial Arts Forum.

Countless comments were targeting Qin Yu so the true masterminds wouldn’t need to dirty their hands to kill Qin Yu.

There was clearly someone deliberately manipulating things.

“Looks like there are quite a number of people who want to obtain the Meridian Circulation Technique.” Qin Yu looked at the comments and couldn’t help but sneer repeatedly.

What they didn’t know was that Qin Yu didn’t have any cultivation method at all.

The secret manipulations from behind the scene made Qin Yu the center of attention.

“That’s good too. This is exactly what I want.” Qin Yu sneered.

An Inner Strength Grandmaster would be extremely useful to Qin Yu.

It was the best and fastest cultivation method for Qin Yu.

“Then I’ll go with the flow.” Qin Yu put away his phone.

Then, he prepared to set off for Yunchuan City.

Yunchuan City was very far from Chuzhou. Even if he took a plane, it would take seven to eight hours.

At this moment, the Cao family was the number one aristocratic family in Yunchuan City.

Not only did they control the martial artists of the entire Yunchuan City, but they even controlled the economic lifeline of more than half of the city!

Beside Cao Shan, there were four to five women in Cheongsam massaging him.

Cao Shan also closed his eyes comfortably while looking like he was enjoying himself.

“Dad, Qin Yu seems to be in the limelight recently,” a young man said from the side.

Cao Shan sneered. “Someone is just deliberately creating hype. Aren’t there always a few people who get hyped up every year?”

“Hype?” Cao Shan’s son, Cao Hu, frowned slightly.

“You mean... something is spending money to create hype?”

Cao Shan nodded with satisfaction and said, “That’s right. The martial arts world seems to be independent from the secular world, but in fact, there is also capital controlling it.”

“As long as there is enough hype, then he can create wealth for capitalists.”

Cao Hu was suddenly enlightened.

Just as Cao Shan said, capitalists did introduce a few young people who were known as geniuses every year, but most of them ended up being one hit wonders.

“Dad, but I heard that Qin Yu seems to be coming to Yunchuan City.” Cao Hu suddenly thought of something.
