Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Why don’t you try touching her?”

“Oh really?” Xuan Yin raised his eyebrows. “I’ll satisfy you then!”

Having said that, Xuan Yin walked over to Xiao Yu with a lecherous expression.

“What... What do you want to do?!” Xiao Yu said with her eyes wide open.

Xuan Yin said with a wicked smile, “Don’t be afraid. I won’t do anything to you. As long as you have intercourse with me and help me improve my strength, I will give you endless riches!”

Intercourse?

Xiao Yu’s face turned pale!

She took a look at Xuan Yin. His skin was full of wrinkles, his eyes were beady, and two nose hairs stuck out of his nostrils.

“Ugh!”

Xiao Yu couldn’t help but vomit on the spot.

Xuan Yin wasn’t angry. He said with a nonchalant smile, “Little girl, it won’t do you any harm to help me practice my martial arts skills...”

Having said that, Xuan Yin reached out his hand and grabbed Xiao Yu!

At this moment, a foot kicked his body hard.

This kick sent Xuan Yin flying!

“You actually dare to touch her,” said Qin Yu with a cold expression.

Xuan Yin got up from the ground and said with a cold expression, “You’re just an Inner Strength Past Master, yet you dare to cross me? You’re too brazen!”

As soon as he finished his words, Xuan Yin stepped forward!

His hands turned into claws and he clawed at Qin Yu’s head!

“Crack!!”

However, before Xuan Yin’s hands could touch Qin Yu, they were shattered by a punch!

This made Xuan Yin furious!

His wrist had been injured by Jiang Gu just now, and now, this punch had shattered his palm!

“Two body refining top-notch martial artists? Your physical bodies are really quite strong,” Xuan Yin said coldly.

“Unfortunately, it’s useless. Your cultivation state is too low, not to mention that you’re suppressed by the dark energy!”

Xuan Yin roared and used the same trick again. He condensed the chains with both hands again and threw them at Qin Yu with all his strength!

Qin Yu didn’t panic, and no emotion could be discerned from his expression.

“Go to h*ll!” Xuan Yin roared angrily!

“Crash!”

The chains tied Qin Yu up! The thick chains stuck to Qin Yu’s body tightly!

“Little b*stard, I’ll kill you right now!” Xuan Yin opened his palm and revealed his sharp fingernails!

In the next second, Xuan Yin charged toward Qin Yu!

The fingernails stabbed toward Qin Yu’s chest!

“Boom!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, at this moment, a terrifying energy burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

The chains tied to his body were shattered!

Xuan Yin’s expression changed drastically, and he exclaimed in shock, “How is this possible?!”

He suddenly felt alarmed, but it was too late for him to retreat!

“D*mn you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

His fist was surrounded by golden light, and he threw a punch!

His huge fist punched Xuan Yin’s fingernails.

His sturdy body wasn’t afraid of any sharp blades!

Crack!

This punch not only shattered Xuan Yin’s arm, but also sent him flying dozens of meters!

Qin Yu’s body was surrounded by a golden light.

In this dark environment, he looked out of place.

“How is this possible? You... you aren’t suppressed?” Xuan Yin’s expression was extremely ugly!

Thinking of this, Xuan Yin hurriedly gathered his dark energy to fight to the death!

However, as soon as the dark energy floated to his palm, it started to dissipate before it could gather!

All the dark energy surged toward Qin Yu’s body like a storm!

“You... you can absorb dark energy too?” Cold sweat broke out on Xuan Yin’s forehead!

“No wonder you have a pure dark energy body by your side. She’s a tool for cultivation!” Xuan Yin suddenly thought of something.

“Bullsh * t!” Qin Yu was furious. He raised his hand and slapped Xuan Yin’s head!

This slap shattered Xuan Yin’s facial bones, and his head was severely injured!

Xuan Yin fell to the ground and wriggled weakly.

“Don’t think I’m as despicable as you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xuan Yin said anxiously, “Please spare my life! There’s a treasure hidden in the ground, and it’s definitely useful to you. I can give it to you!”

“Give it to me? It was mine to begin with.” Qin Yu grinned.

In the next second, the Heaven Swallowing Technique was activated!

Xuan Yin’s body suddenly became shriveled. In a flash, he turned into a dried corpse.

The two disciples not far away were so scared that they had wet their pants and were trembling like chaff!

“Spare... spare us...” the two said in a trembling voice.

How could Qin Yu spare them? He used the Heaven Swallowing Technique again and absorbed the inner strength of the two people.

After killing these three people, the chains on Jiang Gu’s body disappeared, and their surroundings gradually returned to calm.

Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and said, “Are you okay?”

After she witnessed the death of the three people, it was impossible for her to be okay.

Although Xiao Yu said that she was fine, her forehead was full of sweat.

She bit her pale lips with her teeth, and her petite body was also trembling.

“I’m... fine.” Xiao Yu’s hands trembled as she wiped the sweat off her forehead.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Xiao Yu, if you want to embark on the path of cultivation, you are destined to have such experiences.”

“If you can’t bear it, it’s not too late to quit. I will erase this memory for you,” Qin Yu looked down at Xiao Yu and said seriously.

Hearing this, Xiao Yu hurriedly shook her head. She wiped the sweat from her forehead and said, “I... I can’t quit... I can adapt!”

“Okay, then use the method I taught you and start cultivating.” Qin Yu acted like a strict teacher.

Xiao Yu hurriedly sat on the ground and started breathing exercises.

She tried her best to calm her emotions.

During this time, Qin Yu stood next to Xiao Yu and looked at her quietly.

After half an hour, Xiao Yu finally entered her state.

The surrounding dark energy began to slowly gather around her body. It even formed a small vortex around her body.

“It’s done.” Qin Yu nodded in appreciation.

Since Xiao Yu had calmed down, Qin Yu wanted to take a look at what kind of treasure was buried underground.

Just as Qin Yu was about to start, Xiao Yu suddenly opened her eyes.

She said timidly, “Qin Yu, is what that person said true?”

“Huh?” Qin Yu froze and didn’t understand for a moment.

Xiao Yu said with a blush, “Is what he said about having s*x with me and increasing his strength true...”

Qin Yu frowned and nodded. “It’s true.”

“Then, if we have s*x, can we also increase your strength?” Xiao Yu asked in a low voice.

Qin Yu blushed immediately. He scolded, “What are you talking about? Don’t let your imagination run wild!”

“I’m not letting my imagination run wild.” Xiao Yu stood up from the ground.

She pulled Qin Yu to the side and said in a low voice, “The old man from last time also wanted to take me away. This time, Xuan Yin also wanted to take me away.”

“I can dodge once, or twice, but can I dodge ten times?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What do you want to say?”

Xiao Yu said in a low voice, “Since I’m going to be taken away sooner or later, I might as well let you...”
