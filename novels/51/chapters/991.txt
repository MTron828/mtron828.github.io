Chapter 992: Chapter 992, the fourth round of Heavenly Tribulation!

Looking at the slowly growing crack, Qin Yu’s face also turned pale!

At this rate, his golden core would explode before he even stepped into the martial saint realm!

“No!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He hurriedly controlled his divine sense and slowed down, trying his best to stabilize his golden core.

With Qin Yu’s control, the immersion of his divine sense also became much gentler.

The speed of the crack on the golden core began to slow down, and then it stopped.

“It’s this speed...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He controlled his divine sense and slowly fused with the golden core at the current speed.

Although the speed was not considered fast, Qin Yu had no other way.

The two golden rays collided in Qin Yu’s body, blooming with a different light.

The pain that spread from every part of his body was close to his brain, and even tie Dan was affected by it.

“If I knew this would happen, I wouldn’t have come out with you!”Tie Dan couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He held his breath and tried his best to control the fusion of his golden core and divine sense.

“Rumble...”

At this moment, a loud sound suddenly came from the sky!

When they looked up, they saw colorful clouds in the sky!

These clouds were extremely peaceful, making people forget to return!

Traces of divine aura spread across half of the sky!

Even though they were far away, they could still see these auspicious clouds that blotted out the sky!

“Someone is going to become a martial saint.”When they saw this scene, someone could not help but whisper.

For a moment, countless people raised their heads to look at this auspicious cloud.

Zeng Ji and the others who were closest to him also slowly raised their heads.

“TSK TSK, is there going to be a third martial saint?”Someone beside him said.

“A third?”Zeng Ji could not help but sneer, “Do you think there are only three martial saints in this world?”

“As far as we know, this should be the third one.”The person beside him added another sentence.

Zeng ji placed his hands behind his back and looked at the auspicious clouds in the sky. He could not help but say, “I’m afraid that more and more people will step into the martial saint realm in the future.”

He did not think too much about it. After all, the area covered by the auspicious clouds was extremely large. He did not think that the place of origin was nearby.

Qin Yu slightly closed his eyes, and sweat could not help but form on his forehead.

What was going to happen next was the most critical moment!

Not only would the heavenly tribulation descend, but the power of his divine sense and jindan would also become even more frantic!

As a result, the difficulty of Qin Yu’s control over his divine sense and jindan would increase in a straight line!

In addition to the external heavenly tribulation, it would be even more difficult for Qin Yu to deal with!

“Rumble...”

The auspicious clouds began to gradually dissipate, and patches of dark clouds began to gather above Qin Yu’s head.

A powerful sense of oppression assaulted his face, and the entire mountain range buzzed!

“The scale of this heavenly tribulation... is probably not simple,”iron egg could not help but exclaim.

“Kid, are you sure you can hold on! This is double pain!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Whether I can hold on or not, I have to try! The arrow is on the bow, and I have no choice but to shoot!”

After saying that, Qin Yu stood up from the ground.

As he controlled the extremely violent energy in his body, he raised his head to look at the gathering dark clouds in the sky.

“Rumble...”

Muffled Thunder brewed within the dark clouds.

An extremely destructive energy seemed to be about to take shape in the clouds.

Qin Yu’s forehead was drenched in sweat. He did not know whether it was because of pain or nervousness.

“Crack!”

An earth-shattering sound rang out!

The sound of the heavenly tribulation was even faster as it struck Qin Yu’s body viciously!

“Ah!”

Intense pain!

An unprecedented pain!

This heavenly tribulation went through Qin Yu’s pores and headed straight into his body!

In almost an instant, traces of lightning that looked like swimming snakes appeared in Qin Yu’s body!

This lightning swam around his body and almost destroyed his internal organs!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and endured the pain.

“Kid, the martial saint’s heavenly tribulation usually has eight rounds. This is only the first round. Be careful,”reminded tie Dan.

“Eight rounds...”Qin Yu’s expression was ugly.

He tried to face the heavenly tribulation, but the pain in his golden core made him powerless to resist!

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and silently circulated his mental cultivation method. He forcefully released the Lightning that had entered his body along with his meridians.

Before Qin Yu could catch his breath, the second heavenly tribulation had already descended!

“Boom!”

This heavenly tribulation was extremely meticulous, like a stream of water, but the power contained in it was beyond imagination!

The heavenly tribulation directly smashed onto the top of Qin Yu’s head, and his brain immediately smashed fiercely onto the ground!

Qin Yu, who originally needed to control his divine sense, suddenly lost control of his divine sense under this heavy blow! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The power of the fusion between the Golden Core and divine sense became manic again, and the crack in the Golden Core also rapidly expanded!

“Not good!”

Qin Yu’s face changed greatly!

He did not care about the pain in his body. He hurriedly used all his strength to control his divine sense and once again suppressed the speed!

Although Qin Yu used all his strength, the effect of this heavenly tribulation on his divine sense was too great, and the speed of the fusion was still increasing!

“This won’t do...”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. Relying on his powerful consciousness, he tried his best to stabilize the speed of the fusion.

The heavenly tribulation seemed to be giving him face. The third heavenly tribulation did not descend for a long time.

Qin Yu spent an entire day and night before he managed to slow down the speed of the fusion.

He panted heavily, feeling a lingering fear in his heart.

“It’s finally... stabilized,”Qin Yu said with a trembling voice.

“It’s not that I want to strike you down, but this is only the second heavenly tribulation, and it has already made you physically and mentally exhausted. I’m afraid you won’t be able to withstand the third heavenly tribulation,”tie Dan said coldly.

Qin Yu had the same feeling in his heart.

Moreover, the third heavenly tribulation had yet to descend, but the dark clouds in the sky had not dissipated. Instead, they were getting darker and darker.

It was very likely that an extremely terrifying power was brewing.

“Rumble...”

Muffled sounds rumbled within the dark clouds.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the heavenly tribulation poured down like a torrential downpour!

The blue light illuminated the sky. Wherever it passed, the mountain rocks were directly turned into dust!

Even the air was filled with the power of lightning!

“It’s over!”

Seeing such a scale of heavenly tribulation, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned pale!
