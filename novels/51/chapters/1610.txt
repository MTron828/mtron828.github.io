“Don’t worry, the sect Master of the Heavenly Cloud sect isn’t here at all. Naturally, no one will be able to accept this gift.”Sima bei continued.

Even though that was the case, Yong Ji still didn’t have the intention to extend his hand to accept the gift.

He said somewhat awkwardly, “Lord Sima Bei, you should change someone else. I... Haven’t been feeling too well recently.”

Sima bei sneered, “What? A Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master scared you to this extent? I said, he’s not here at all!”

“I know he’s not here. I just haven’t been feeling well recently.”Yong Ji braced himself and said.

Sima bei frowned slightly. It was very obvious that he had underestimated Yong Ji’s fear of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master and overestimated Yong Ji’s courage.

“I’ve already said that he’s not here! Moreover, so what if he is? You’re only going to deliver a gift. As a great sect, the Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely not act rashly against you.”Sima bei said earnestly.

“If you don’t go, I’ll kill you right now. Of course, if you complete this matter, after the master recovers, I can help you step into the reversion void stage.”

The combination of kindness and power instantly made Yongji’s eyes light up.

Before Yongji could speak, Feng Hai at the side volunteered, “Lord Sima Bei, he doesn’t dare to go, I will go! Since his Tianyun sect’s sect master isn’t here, there’s nothing to be afraid of!”

“Alright.”Sima bei made a gesture and was about to pass this gift to Feng Hai.

But before Feng Hai could receive the gift, Yongji took the gift box in his hand.

“I’ll go.”Yong Ji said with a smile.

Sima bei snorted coldly, “Aren’t you feeling unwell?”

“It’s fine all of a sudden. Don’t you think it’s Strange?”Yong Ji said shamelessly.

He took the gift and repeatedly confirmed, “You’re sure that he’s in thunder roar courtyard and not in Heavenly Cloud Sect, right?”

Sima bei said with a dark face, “Since you’re so worried, I think you’d better not go!”

“I’ll go. I’m just asking.”Yong Ji said with an embarrassed smile.

Sima bei snorted lightly and said, “Then let’s set off now. Don’t waste time.”

“Okay, I’ll leave right away.”Yong Ji agreed.

With that, he stood up and shot toward the direction of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Although he was a bit worried, Sima Bei didn’t seem to be lying. Moreover, the condition of helping him to step into the reversion void stage was too tempting.

After Yong Ji left, Sima bei looked at Feng Hai.

“You cooperated well. The position of the godly monarch is currently lacking one. I will apply to the Lord as soon as possible,”Sima Bei said indifferently.

Feng Hai hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Thank you, Lord Sima Bei!”

“By the way... is the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect around?”Feng Hai changed the topic and asked suspiciously.

“Most likely not, but I’m not sure either.”Sima bei did not lie.

“Then is the news that he’s in the Thunder Academy Fake?”Feng Hai continued to ask.

Sima bei sneered, “Of course it’s fake. How would I know where he is?”

Feng Hai suddenly came to a realization and could not help but break out in cold sweat for Yong Ji.

“Yong Ji, I can only say that I’m helping you with your good luck.”Feng Hai muttered in his heart.

...

In the Heavenly Cloud Sect, the sect leader of many sects had gathered.

They had been discussing how to deal with the current situation all day long.

Qin Yu’s whereabouts were unknown. Qu Zhu was living in seclusion on wind bamboo mountain, while the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect was missing.

Under such circumstances, they could only rely on themselves.

“In my opinion, it’s better to find an opportunity to negotiate,”an elder stood up and said.

This old man was called Kong you. He had never been willing to fight with others, and it was the same for his sect.

If it weren’t for the northern land attacking them this time, Kong you would never have participated in this matter.

“Negotiate? How?”

“The negotiation needs to be done on an equal footing before we have the ability to negotiate. The northern land clearly wants to exterminate us.”

Kong you smiled and said, “Nothing is absolute. It all depends on how we negotiate.”

“Oh? Does that mean that old Mister Kong has an idea?”Someone asked coldly.

Kong you waved his hand and said, “We can only say that we’ll try. If we don’t try, no one knows if we’ll have a chance.”

“I don’t agree to negotiate. The northern lands also said that they wanted to negotiate the last time. What was the result?”

“Hehe, if Xiao Hai didn’t agree that time, it might not have been impossible to negotiate.”

“Didn’t they always want the northern border? We’ll just give it to them.”

For a time, everyone was divided into two factions. Some people agreed while others disagreed.

As they were speaking, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

A disciple of the Tianyun sect walked quickly to the side of the deputy sect leader and said in a low voice, “Yongji is here.”

As soon as he said this, the vice sect master’s expression changed drastically!

Although the Disciple’s voice was very soft, the people in the meeting hall were all very powerful and could not escape their ears at all!

“What? Yong Ji is here?”

“What does he want to do? is he going to attack us?”

“Where is the sect master? Yong Ji is here and the sect master still doesn’t intend to show himself?”

Everyone was panicking, and the deputy sect master’s expression was extremely ugly.

Di Zun, who was at the side, said in a deep voice, “Everyone, don’t panic. I’ll go ask the sect master to show himself now.”

When he heard this, a trace of surprise flashed across the deputy sect master’s face.

Di Zun nodded at him, telling him to be at ease.

When the deputy sect master saw this, he could only brace himself and agree.

Then, the deputy sect master stood up and walked out of the meeting hall.

In the hall, Yong Ji was holding a gift box and sitting there with a smile on his face.

He was also uncertain because he didn’t know whether the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect was there or not.

Even though his divine sense couldn’t catch the sect master’s figure, Yong Ji still didn’t dare to be too presumptuous.

The deputy sect master walked quickly into the hall. He looked at Yong Ji in front of him and couldn’t help but say coldly, “Yong Ji, you still dare to come to my heavenly cloud sect? !”

Yong Ji glanced at the deputy sect master and said indifferently, “Deputy sect master, Why Are You So Angry? It’s better to resolve the enmity than to form a knot.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The deputy sect master glared at Yong Ji and said through gritted teeth, “You are just a treacherous villain. What is there to talk about with a person like you? Get out immediately!”

Yong Ji’s eyes narrowed slightly. He slowly stood up and said, “I heard that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect has returned. I don’t know if it’s true or not.”

The deputy sect master was startled. He said with some lack of confidence, “Of course our sect master has returned. What does this have to do with you!”

“Are you serious?”Yong Ji raised his eyebrows and said tentatively, “Since he has returned, why hasn’t he made a move yet? You should know that I almost caused the fall of the Heavenly Cloud sect back then. Doesn’t he want to kill me?”

The deputy sect master opened his mouth and was speechless. He couldn’t say a word.

Seeing the deputy sect master’s expression, Yong Ji instantly had an idea.

“It seems that Sima Bei didn’t lie to me. The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect didn’t come back at all!”Yong Ji said coldly in his heart.
