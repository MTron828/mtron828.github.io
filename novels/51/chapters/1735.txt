Chapter 1736: Xiao Sheng’s Closed-Door Cultivation Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing Xiao Sheng in such a state, Qin Yu was shocked.

This was very different from the high-spirited Xiao Sheng. It was no exaggeration to say that Qin Yu had never seen Xiao Sheng in such a state!

He sent out a wisp of his consciousness to cover Xiao Sheng, only to discover to his surprise that there was no spiritual energy in his body at all.

In such a state, any Mighty Realm would be able to kill him easily, let alone Yuan Xiu!

“You… You are…” Qin Yu opened her mouth in shock.

!!

Xiao Sheng shook his head and did not answer the question.

“What happened?” Qin Yu frowned.

Qin Yu did not know about the battle between Yuan Xiu and Xiao Sheng. Now that he saw Xiao Sheng’s condition, he was even more puzzled.

Xiao Sheng then told Qin Yu what had happened.

Only after hearing this did Qin Yu realize that Yuan Xiu had already been here and that Xiao Sheng had really killed Yuan Xiu at the Reversion Void Stage.

“In other words, your current state is because of that battle?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

“No,” Xiao Sheng shook his head, “This is a path that I must endure in my cultivation.”

“Must endure? What do you mean by that?” Qin Yu was confused.

“This is my Dao,” said Xiao Sheng, “If I want to step into the Reversion Void Stage, I have to convert my cultivation technique.”

“I am only able to reach the Reversion Void Stage after I disperse all of my powers.”

Qin Yu was stunned. although he felt that it was a little strange, he was not too surprised.

There were tens of millions of cultivators in the world, and each of them had a different dao technique. Qin Yu had long been used to it.

“So you ran to the border of Xihuang? This place doesn’t seem safe.” Qin Yu said with a frown.

“The most dangerous place is often the safest,” said Xiao Sheng indifferently.

“I’ll take you to a place,” Qin Yu said after some thought. “Maybe your safety can be guaranteed there.”

“What place?” Xiao Sheng asked.

“The Divine Capital City,” Qin Yu replied with a smile.

At the mention of Divine Capital City, Xiao Sheng also recalled.

Back then, Qin Yu had hidden in Divine Capital City to avoid the First Elder’s pursuit.

“Don’t waste any more time, come with me.” Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle and took Xiao Sheng with him, heading straight for the Divine Capital City.

Along the way, Xiao Shengsat cross-legged on the back of the Divine Eagle. Then, he suddenly asked, “The matter in Xihuang, it has something to do with you, right?”

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment before he nodded.

“Is it an aristocratic family from Zhongzhou? ” Xiao Sheng continued to ask.

Qin Yu nodded in agreement.

“Which aristocratic family in Zhongzhou?”

“The Yan family.”

“Oh, one of the nine great aristocratic families. You do have an impressive background.”

“It’s not my background,” Qin Yu said with a wry smile. “The Yan family and I might become enemies in the future.”

Upon hearing this, Xiao Sheng fell silent.

He didn’t ask any more questions, and just closed his eyes.

After arriving at the Divine Capital City, Qin Yu activated the formation and brought Xiao Sheng into the city.

After the two of them entered, the Divine Inscription Formation immediately sealed itself, and no one was able to step inside.

“Your safety can be guaranteed here. There are only two people in this huge city. One is Zhuo Jing, and the other is not very strong.” Qin Yu said.

Xiao Sheng nodded his head slightly, as if he had agreed.

Qin Yu took him all the way to the back mountain.

At this moment, Zhuo Jing was still in seclusion and had no intention of waking up.

“Is this kid going to reach the Reversion Void Stage in one go?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but underestimate him.

“It’s not that easy to reach the Reversion Void Stage. From what I know, the youngest Reversion Void Stage cultivator in history was three hundred years old,” Xiao Sheng sighed.

“Three hundred years old?” Qin Yu was stunned.

He counted on his fingers. Damn it, he didn’t even have forty years of life.

Wasn’t this too far away from the Reversion Void Stage?

“Maybe it’s because they didn’t live in such a Golden Age?” Qin Yu guessed.

However, Xiao Sheng shook his head and said, “Do you think that there has only been one Golden Age in history? If we exclude the Golden Age, the fastest to reach the Reversion Void Stage would take a full 500 years, and that would still be a rare genius.”

This made Qin Yu fall silent.

He recalled Xiao Yu’s words, ” Don’t set foot in Zhongzhou until you reach the Reversion Void Stage.

However, the day of the Path of Heaven was only three to five years away. How could Qin Yu afford to wait?

“Is there any other way?” Qin Yu asked.

“Not for now, but who can say for sure when it comes to cultivation?” Xiao Sheng shook his head.

Qin Yu sighed slightly and suddenly felt extremely stressed.

“Don’t be too dejected. Perhaps this Golden Age will be different from the previous ones. After all, countless people have already reached the Reversion Void Stage as soon as this Golden Age arrived. Many of them are only a little over three hundred years old.” Xiao Sheng said.

“I hope so,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

After bringing Xiao Sheng to Divine Capital City, Qin Yu also took out the dragon’s blood, planning to break through to the Peak of the Mighty Realm.

It was not difficult to step into the Peak of the Mighty Realm, so Qin Yu did not feel too much pressure.

“Yuan Xiu will be resurrected in a few days.” At this moment, Xiao Sheng suddenly revealed a piece of bad news.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He frowned and said, “A perfect body Yuan Xiu?”

“Yes.” Xiao Sheng nodded.

“How long will it take you to reach the Reversion Void Stage?” Qin Yu asked.

“At least ten days, at most half a month.” Xiao Sheng said.

“Then wouldn’t it be too late no matter how much time you calculate?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Xiao Sheng nodded his head slightly, then said with a meaningful tone, “Before I reach the Reversion Void Stage, I’ll have to rely on you.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

That was a perfect body Yuan Xiu! even if Qin Yu gave it his all and advanced to the half-step Reversion Void Stage in the next few days, he would still not be a match for Yuan Xiu!

“Of course, if you can get the Yan family to take action, I don’t think Yuan Xiu is worth mentioning,” Xiao Sheng said in a half-joking, half-serious manner.

Qin Yu sighed slightly. This was obviously an impossible thing.

“I’ll try.” Qin Yu said.

He thought of the purple cloud pearl in his hand. Although he was still unconscious when Yan Ruoxue handed the purple cloud pearl to Qin Yu, Qin Yu could still faintly hear a few words from their conversation.

With the purple cloud pearl, Qin Yu might be able to fight. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After that, Xiao Sheng wasted no more time and started his own cultivation.

Three days later, Qin Yu had successfully advanced to the Peak of Mighty Realm and was only a step away from the half-step Reversion Void Stage.

According to Xiao Sheng, Yuan Xiu would be resurrected in two days. Qin Yu could not do much in these two days, so he left Divine Capital City and prepared to visit Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu.

If the two of them attacked together, they might have a greater chance.

Qin Yu took out the purple cloud pearl before he left the Divine Capital City.

The purple cloud pearl was shining in Qin Yu’s palm. It was extremely mysterious, and the aura it emitted was extremely strange.
