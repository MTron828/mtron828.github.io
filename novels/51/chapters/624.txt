“Qin... Qin Yu!” Seeing Qin Yu’s figure, Xia Hang’s expression suddenly became extremely ugly!

Qin Yu raised his finger, and the door was closed.

“You actually didn’t die!” Xia Hang shouted.

Qin Yu sneered. “Not only did I not die, but I am also going very well now.”

Xia Hang narrowed his eyes and said, “Hehe, you were lucky to survive. Why didn’t you find a place to hide for your whole life? How dare you run to Jingdu?! Are you courting death!”

Qin Yu slowly stood up and said, “Do you think that the probability of you or me dying is higher now?”

Xia Hang was stunned and then shouted, “How arrogant! Do you really think that you are my opponent?!”

The current Xia Hang had already stepped into the realm of a Martial Marquis, and his confidence soared.

Facing Qin Yu, not only did he not have the slightest fear, but he even walked forward with big steps. He tried to punch Qin Yu’s face!

His fist was incomparably fierce, and almost all the inner strength in his body exploded on his fist!

However, Qin Yu raised his hand and casually grabbed his fist.

“What, you think you’re invincible after stepping into the Martial Marquis Realm?” Qin Yu said coldly.

As he spoke, Qin Yu exerted force on Xia Hang’s fist. Xia Hang’s fist was immediately squeezed until it made a cracking sound!

The intense pain made Xia Hang wish he was dead!

Then, Qin Yu kicked Xia Hang’s lower abdomen. Xia Hang’s body was pushed back, and a mouthful of blood was spat out from his mouth!

Xia Hang wiped the blood from his mouth. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, don’t be arrogant. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will not let you off. Tomorrow, I will definitely ask a peak Martial Marquis to suppress you!”

“Do you think I will give you this chance?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xia Hang was alarmed, and he started to run.

“Dad...” At this time, a little girl’s voice came from the room.

Xia Hang’s face instantly turned extremely pale!

“Daughter... daughter!” Xia Hang turned around in fear. In the blink of an eye, he arrived beside the little girl.

“This is your daughter? She’s quite cute.” Qin Yu said with a fake smile.

Xia Hang’s body tightened and he said in fear, “Qin Yu, what are you trying to do?! This matter has nothing to do with my daughter. If you lay a hand on my daughter, I definitely won’t let you off!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Don’t worry. As long as you answer a few questions of mine, I promise I won’t touch your daughter.”

“You! You’re despicable!” Xia Hang roared angrily.

Qin Yu said coldly, “If you don’t want to be beaten in front of your daughter, you’d better answer my questions honestly.”

Xia Hang was panicking in his heart. His wife was just an ordinary person, and she couldn’t withstand Xia Hang’s inner strength at all. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Therefore, Xia Hang’s wife passed away after giving birth to their daughter.

To Xia Hang, his daughter was everything.

He gritted his teeth and then looked at the little girl. He tried his best to remain calm as he said, “Daughter, go back to your room first. Daddy will have a few words with him, okay?”

The little girl nodded and said, “Daddy, then you should rest early.”

After saying that, she turned around and went back to her room.

“Your daughter is so obedient.” Qin Yu smiled.

Xia Hang looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “What do you want to ask?”

“Tell me everything you know about the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“If you dare to lie, I can’t guarantee what I will do.”

Xia Hang’s expression turned cold, and then he sneered. “Qin Yu, I don’t believe that you would lay your hands on a child!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu was instantly filled with anger!

He stood up angrily and grabbed Xia Hang’s neck. Gritting his teeth, he said, “How could I not want to be a good person?! But the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has kidnapped my woman and tried every means to put me to death, making it difficult for me to even survive!”

“If it weren’t for you bunch of animals, who would be willing to be a murderous devil?!”

“Don’t stand on the moral high ground and criticize me!”

As he spoke, the strength in Qin Yu’s hand became stronger and stronger, almost suffocating Xia Hang.

Qin Yu glared at Xia Hang and finally let go of him.

“Speak, tell me everything you know. If you dare to lie, I will kill you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After feeling the murderous aura from Qin Yu, Xia Hang was completely afraid.

He didn’t doubt that Qin Yu would really do something crazy!

Hence, Xia Hang poured a glass of water and slowly told him everything he knew.

After Xia Hang’s narration, Qin Yu learned that the president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wasn’t the head.

Behind them were eight higher-ups. As for the identity of these eight higher-ups, Xia Hang didn’t know either.

“Everything we do is conveyed by the higher-ups. We carry them out,” Xia Hang said.

Qin Yu said coldly, “As for these so-called higher-ups, what exactly are their strengths and identities?”

Xia Hang shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. In short... their strength is far above ours.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu looked at Xia Hang and said, “Let me ask you, currently, does the Jingdu Martial Arts Association have a Martial Saint?”

A Martial Saint was an existence that couldn’t be provoked.

Once they met, Qin Yu would most likely die in a single exchange.

Xia Hang was silent for a moment and said, “I’m not sure either, but if the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wants to find a Martial Saint, it won’t be difficult.”

This made Qin Yu’s expression turn a little ugly.

He didn’t expect that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association actually had a Martial Saint.

“Apart from that, we also have a large number of Martial Saint weapons,” Xia Hang continued.

“Back then, the higher-ups gave the order to kill you. If Yan Guiyi had failed, we would have used our Martial Marquis weapons to kill you to prevent future trouble.”

Qin Yu nodded.

Just as Qin Yu thought, his actions had already crossed the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Apart from that, Xia Hang also told Qin Yu about the general division of strength and level of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

For example, those wearing white robes were the most ordinary members, and above that were Xia Hang and the others. As for those who were a level higher, they were people like Yan Guiyi, who wore black and gold robes.

All those who wore black and gold robes were the best among the Martial Marquises, and their strength was outstanding.

Above the black and gold robes were the purple robes. They had the most powerful combat strength in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Oh right, I heard that three geniuses have appeared in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. They are said to be the newly created powerhouses. What exactly is going on? What methods did they use?” Qin Yu looked at Xia Hang.

When this topic was brought up, Xia Hang’s expression instantly became extremely ugly.

He stuttered for a long time, but didn’t say a single word.

“Xia Hang, you’d better not play tricks on me.” Qin Yu’s fingers flickered with a sharp light as he said coldly.

Xia Hang gritted his teeth and said, “I can tell you, but you must promise not to vent your anger on me and my daughter.”
