This palm struck towards the sky, endless true qi burst out from his palms!

Then, 18 true dragons condensed in the sky, each of them vivid and lifelike, as if they had come from a miracle!

Xiao Hai raised his head and roared, the Qi energy in his body had already exploded to the extreme, his body began to bleed, as if he was going to fight to the death.

The eighteen true dragons surged over and overturned the ground. Streams of mist exploded and covered the entire world!

Everyone’s vision was instantly blocked. Even Qin Yu’s desolate god eye could not see through the mist!

“What happened? Why Can’t we see anything clearly!”

“What is senior Xiao Hai trying to do? is he going to risk his life to take this northern God away! ?”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely grave. He knew what Xiao Hai’s actions meant.

He planned to use his last bit of life to give the northern lands a final heavy blow!

Some people couldn’t help but start to cry. Everyone was moved.

They stared at the other side of the river of death, but couldn’t see through anything.

Traces of blood flowed down from the bank of the river of death and into the river of death.

Everyone present was shocked. They had no idea who the source of this blood was.

Qin Yu stared at the other side of the Dead River. He had an indescribable feeling in his heart.

A top-notch genius had given up his future and crossed the Dead River just to give the northern lands a heavy blow.

What kind of state of mind was this? No one could figure it out, let alone follow his footsteps.

Everyone looked at the opposite shore as if they were waiting for a piece of news. They were waiting for the fog to descend.

However, as time passed by, the fog became increasingly dense. It seemed as though it was about to envelop the entire northern land.

This wait lasted for three whole days.

After three days of fruitless waiting, everyone began to give up.

Although no one was willing to believe it, everyone clearly knew in their hearts that this battle was likely to end in disaster for Xiao Hai.

“From today onwards, the green rock sect will officially resist the northern lands,”a sect leader of a sect said coldly.

“Count me in as well,”a young woman said coldly.

“And my lightning surge sect!”

“Count me in!”

“...”

In an instant, almost all the sects on the shore issued letters of challenge to the Northern Lands!

Qin Yu suddenly understood the meaning behind Xiao Hai’s actions and felt even more emotional.

“This Xiao Hai is really strange.”Iron Egg couldn’t help but shake his head.

To iron egg, this was something that he couldn’t understand.

It was simply impossible for him to give up his life for the sake of others, much less give up his own.

This was the essence of the cultivation world. Anyone would step on the bones of others and stand at the peak.

But even in such an environment, there were still people who were willing to go against the current and become a unique existence in this world and this era.

Xiao Hai was such a person.

On the other side of the river of death, everyone began to slowly leave.

They no longer held any hope. Xiao Hai’s heroic feat was imprinted in everyone’s hearts.

Qin Yu stood on the other side of the river of death and did not leave for a long time.

He had mixed feelings in his heart. He did not know whether it was pain or admiration.

“Xiao Hai’s action is to stop the revival of the Northern Land’s master.”At this moment, the monk of the Hon Xi suddenly appeared beside Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked at the monk of the Hon XI and said, “Senior Xiao Hai should also know in his heart that this is an impossible thing, right?”

“The beginning of anything is based on fantasy. If you don’t even dare to think about it, then you will never be able to do it,”said the monk of the Hon XI.

“For Xiao Hai, his death can wake up everyone, and it’s worth it.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His heart was like a heavy stone, very heavy, very heavy.

People in the South Province had already fallen at the hands of the northern lands. There was the heavily injured Jue Wu, and now there was Xiao Hai, who had the courage to show himself. Even the Heavenly Cloud sect hadn’t been spared.

This made the anger of the South Province reach its peak.

The bank of the Dead River became cold. The cold wind blew, and it was like a sharp steel blade, cutting both on the face and the heart.

The monk of Hongxi put his palms together, worshiped silently, and then left.

“We should go too,”qu Zhu said.

Qin Yu sighed slightly and said, “Yes, we should go too...”

The fog on the other side of the dead river became thicker and thicker. There was no longer any movement. There was no point in continuing to stay.

“Xiao Hai wants to think of a way to send you away. He probably doesn’t want anything to happen to you. He probably hopes that you can resist the great flag of the northern lands,”qu Zhu said, intentionally or unintentionally.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Perhaps...”

When he said this, Qin Yu’s tone changed, and his tone became incomparably cold.

He took a deep breath and said, “The northern lands and I will not rest until one of us dies.”

Just as Qin Yu and the others left, a slender figure came to the shore of the Dead River.

He looked at the opposite shore from afar, and the expression on his face was extremely complicated.

“Is it worth it to die just like that?”He muttered softly, but there was some pain on his face.

This person was none other than the sect leader of the Tianyun sect who had disappeared for a long time.

He tried to sense Xiao Hai’s internal qi, but he realized that he could not sense anything.

“You have never liked competition since you were young. Yet, you have chosen to leave like this.”The sect leader of the Tianyun sect muttered softly.

He took out a pot of wine and scattered it in the Dead River. Waves of thick fog instantly rose from the Dead River.

“A person who doesn’t like competition is able to gain the patience of half of the people in the southern region. Perhaps you are more suitable to be the sect master than me.”

Saying this, he laughed bitterly and shook his head. “Speaking of which, with your character, you are not suitable to be the sect master. It’s really contradictory.”

The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect raised his head and let out a long sigh. He put his hands behind his back and said in a low voice, “Don’t worry. I will take revenge for you, but that will only happen after the northern region’s master recovers.”

...

This battle quickly spread throughout the southern province. Almost everyone had heard about this battle.

For a time, the news that Xiao Hai had forcefully crossed the death river and single-handedly resisted the entire northern land spread throughout the entire southern province.

Many people had voluntarily started to resist the northern land, which also gave the northern land’s cultivators great pressure.

At this moment, Qin Yu was on wind bamboo mountain.

“I don’t know what the Southern Region will do next,”qu Zhu said with a sigh.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “The initiative is not in our hands. It depends on the actions of the northern land.”

“Don’t even think about it. The northern land will certainly invade the southern region. Just wait and see,”iron egg said with a sneer.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Why do you say that?”

Iron egg said coldly, “The northern border is the last line of defense. Moreover, they suffered heavy losses in this battle. How could they not think of a way to make up for it?”

“The only way to make up for it is the southern region.”

Qu Zhu nodded slightly and said, “What iron egg said makes sense.”

Hearing this, iron egg narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Kid, you’d better not call me iron egg.”Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
