2223 Qin Yu Versus Demon King

“Demon King Xuan Yuan, you’re courting death!”

The evil exterminator floated in the air, and a sword light struck the demon king’s face.

The massive force of the slash sent the black tortoise flying, knocking numerous people away along the way.

“As expected of the divine beast black tortoise’s bloodline. Its defense is indeed high.”

Uncle Ling sighed and said by the side.

At this moment, Xuan Yuan stood up as if nothing had happened. It patted the dust off its body and threw itself into the battle again.

Under the impact of the terrifying beast tide, many weak cultivators had been devoured by the Demonic Beasts.

Humans hunted Demonic Beasts, and Demon Beasts also treated human cultivators as supplements.

Qin Yu had just shattered a True Saint violent bear, and he suddenly felt a heavy internal qi crashing toward him.

“Hahaha, brat!”

Xuan Ren ran wildly toward Qin Yu. The giant turtle phantom was lying dormant on his back, locking Qin Yu with his severely cold divine sense.

“It’s you again, old turtle.”

Qin Yu grabbed Xuan Yuan’s thick neck before it could hit him.

And then he turned his body and used his strength to throw it away.

The demonic ginseng was about to be born, and Qin Yu did not want to waste too much spiritual energy.

As the medicinal scent of ginseng gradually grew stronger, everyone instinctively reduced the frequency of their attacks.

“Old man, show that kid some moves.”

Under the protection of a dozen or so cultivators, Zong Yue appeared to be very relaxed amidst the impact of the fierce beasts.

“Young Lord, the two races are conflicting now. I’m afraid it will cause some people to feel dissatisfied if we act rashly.

A cultivator who was protecting him frowned and said.

“Young Lord, this person’s talent is top-notch. Should we find an opportunity to recruit him and restrain him?”

The old man bent over and asked.

“F*ck you! Just do what I tell you. In this galaxy, I have everything I want. It’s fine if it’s just an evil exterminator, but on what ground does a brat who has cultivated for hundreds of years have to crush me? I want him to die!”

Zong Yue laughed pervertedly and slapped the cultivator who spoke.

“Do you want to taste the methods of my Blood Sect?”

He licked his lips and looked at the old man.

The old man’s body suddenly trembled, and he turned to the cultivators, shouting, “All of you, attack Xuan Yuan with all your might!”

“Attack!”

All of a sudden, the cultivators from Zong Yue’s side attacked.

The old man’s divine sense took the opportunity to leap out. A phantom seemed to be dragging a massive green cloth and suddenly covered the space where Xuan Yuan was.

In that space, numerous Qin Yu holding silver-green three-edged awls appeared beside Xuan Yuan.

The next moment, the three-edged awls pierced into Xuan Yuan’s primordial spirit.

“Ah!”

Xuan Yuan let out a miserable cry. Although this attack did not cause any harm, it caused immense pain.

It rolled his body and suddenly stood up.

The massive body crashed into Qin Yu like a tank.

Qin Yu’s blood boiled from the crash, and the Saintly Body Technique on his body was almost shattered by Xuan Yuan.

“B*stard!”

Qin Yu caught a glimpse of Zong Yue and the others sneering at the side and was instantly enraged.

Before he could explain anything, the ferocious Xuan Yuan smashed its fist directly into the ground.

The tremendous shockwave sent him plummeting hundreds of meters into the depths of the earth, and Qin YU violently spewed out a mouthful of blood.

“Help us deal with this demon king. I’ll let you smell it when I get the demonic ginseng.”

Zong Yue laughed sinisterly.

“Haha, this kid has been targeted by Xuan Yuan.”

A cold smile appeared on Xing Mou’s face.

This demon king has already comprehended the power of rules, and its defense is even unbelievable. This kid from the Holy Region is most likely going to die.”

Wu Feng also had an expression of watching a show.

“Stinky old turtle, do you really think that I, Qin Yu, have no temper?”

Qin Yu, who had been punched dozens of times in a row, was covered in blood.

Cosmic form!

His body expanded to hundreds of meters and suppressed Xuan Yuan.

“Bang!”

The two massive fists clashed.

“Hahaha!”

Ripples appeared on Xuan Yuan’s hand when the fists clashed.

Qin Yu felt a wave of earth power coming from its hand. In an instant, he felt like striking by horizontal gravity.

Qin Yu’s massive body crashed onto the ground, causing the entire space to shake.

“Xuan Yuan should have comprehended the way of the earth. Moreover, it seems to have achieved its peak. It can defend and attack at the same time. Coupled with its unique divine beast bloodline, it’s indeed overwhelming. After a few hundred years, this old turtle had become even stronger.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Uncle Ling standing behind the evil exterminator exclaimed.

“However, Qin Yu isn’t simple either. He seems to have only suffered some injuries.”

Ling Yurou exclaimed too.

She stretched out her hand, and hundreds of green fireflies suddenly appeared in the air and entered Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu was shocked but sensed that these fireflies were only turning into pure energy in his body and healing his injuries at a terrifying speed.

“Thanks.”

Qin Yu cupped his fists at Ling Yurou.

“B*stard, continue! Are you the only one who has comprehended the power of rules?”

Qin Yu’s enormous body suddenly stood up, and a strange black flame ignited between his hands.

“Fist of Destruction!”

In an instant, the fist wind that tore through the air and the hundreds of fireballs that burned in the air smashed fiercely on Xuan Yuan’s body. The destructive power made it scream.

It was sent flying for thousands of meters but came back after a few moments.

The hundred-meter-tall bodies of the two clashed in the air. Black flames burned between heaven and earth, and the power of earth filled the entire space.

“Gulp.”

The old man swallowed his saliva.

“This kid is only in second grade, right? How did he force a demon king of at least sixth grade to such a state?”

Zong Yue was also dumbfounded. However, his tightly clenched fists only revealed the unwillingness in his heart.

“As expected of a person that even the aristocratic families in the Holy Region are wary of.”

Wu Feng’s face was also filled with shock.

Initially, everyone thought that Qin Yu might not be able to last a few rounds under the attack of Demon King Xuan Yuan. They did not expect the two to be evenly matched.

“Stop! Neither of us can do anything to each other. Don’t waste our energy.”

Xuan Yuan’s face was bruised and swollen, and he suddenly made a stop gesture.

“Stop your a*s!”

Qin Yu was furious and slapped Xuan Yuan’s face, sending him flying.

“Alright, stop!”

Qin Yu quickly shouted when he saw Xuan Yuan rush over unyieldingly again.

He was also panting heavily. In the collision just now, he used the power of rules in every attack.

Moreover, he had to maintain the cosmic form, which caused him enormous consumption.

“I already said stop, but why did you slap me? I want to slap you back.”

Xuan Yuan walked forward and said with a grave expression.

“Idiot, you don’t even know who attacked you. Your cultivation has all gone into your muscles.”

Qin Yu cursed. He was really angry.

How could these demons fall for such a clumsy method of framing?

Now, he had exhausted a lot of his energy and exposed his strength.
