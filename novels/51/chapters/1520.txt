Chapter 1521: Chapter 1,521, Breakthrough 1

Li Yingying was kicked out. She stood outside the door unwillingly.

But at the moment, she couldn’t think of anyone other than Yongji, so she could only give up.

In order to prevent suspicion, she thought about it and finally decided to go to the valley of the fallen life.

...

In a dark area in the South Province.

There were a few black-robed men standing there.

In front of them, a huge scene was formed.

What was shocking was that the scene in this scene was actually the Heavenly Cloud sect!

“Lord Sima Bei.”At this moment, a man wearing a black robe walked over

Sima bei glanced at him and said, “Didn’t I ask you to keep an eye on Yongji?”

The black-robed man hurriedly said, “Sir, the situation has changed. I just received an important piece of news.”

Following that, the black-robed man told Sima Bei what had happened.

After hearing this, Sima bei narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu is about to break through?”

......

“That’s right. Today, the location is Falling Life Valley,”said the black-robed man.

Sima bei could not help but sneer, “This Qin Yu and Jue Wu are in the same breath. If he breaks through, he will definitely attack us in the north.”

Speaking up to this point, Sima bei looked at the black-robed man and said coldly, “Bring people immediately and take the opportunity to kill him!”

The black-robed man smiled bitterly, “Lord Sima bei, it’s better for you to personally handle this matter. As far as I know, the person guarding him is not weak and has a void-returning artifact in his hands. Moreover, it’s not an ordinary void-returning artifact. It’s called Silver Spring.”

“Silver Spring...”Sima bei muttered in a low voice, and then said coldly, “Alright, I’ll personally handle it and get rid of Qin Yu!”

...

Zhuo family.

After Zhuo Jing had made some preparations, he came to Qin Yu’s room.

“Brother Qin, let’s set off,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and nodded repeatedly. “Alright, I can’t wait any longer.”

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “It’s better to keep a low profile this time, so we don’t need to ride on the Divine Eagle.”

“That’s exactly what I was thinking.”Qin Yu nodded.

Therefore, the two of them immediately left the Zhuo clan and rushed towards the falling life valley.

Because they couldn’t be too high-profile, the two of them traveled very slowly. They needed nearly two days to reach the falling life valley.

At this time, Eternal Limit City had already launched the Second Great War against the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Just as everyone had guessed, after the heavenly cloud sect recalled their elites and guest elders, the strength of eternal limit city immediately fell to the lowest tier.

In just a short half an hour, the eternal limit city was forced to retreat.

Even if the eternal limit city was incomparably brave, with the general trend, he alone could not change anything.

“It seems that the eternal limit city is really going to lose.”

“Sigh, it’s still too difficult to shake the position of the Heavenly Cloud sect in the Southern Region.”

“Perhaps we should take the opportunity to attack the eternal limit city together!”

Just as everyone was about to add insult to injury, the air suddenly trembled, and then they saw a thick black fog spreading over!

Along with the Black Fog came a large group of black-robed men!

Their auras were extremely powerful, and it was as if their every move was activating internal Qi!

“It’s the people of the northern lands!”Someone exclaimed.

“As expected, the people of the northern lands will take this opportunity to attack!”

Balls of black fog filled half of the heavenly cloud sect. Many black-robed people stood in the air and coldly looked down at the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Everyone in the Heavenly Cloud sect immediately felt a trace of despair.

The deputy sect leader, who was currently immersed in a bloody battle, had a livid expression.

“Today is the end of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”The black-robed leader shouted!

His voice was like thunder and shook the entire world!

The deputy sect leader was furious. He glared at the black-robed men and shouted, “How dare you! You northern land people dare to attack my Tianyun sect!”

The leader of the black-robed men laughed, “You brought this on yourselves! If you didn’t attack my northern land people, we wouldn’t have rushed here! If you want to blame someone, blame yourself!”

The people of the Tianyun sect who were already in despair pointed their spears at the deputy sect leader when they heard this.

“It’s all your fault! If you hadn’t insisted on attacking the northern lands, the Heavenly Cloud sect wouldn’t have fallen to this State!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Deputy sect leader, you have to take full responsibility for this matter!”

Someone even said immediately, “Deputy sect leader, we might as well take this opportunity to make peace with the northern lands. This way, not only can we protect the heavenly cloud sect, but we can also get rid of Yongji!”

Hearing this, the vice sect leader looked at him coldly and slapped him!

“Pa!”

With just one slap, the person who said this had his head smashed into pieces!

The vice sect leader glared at everyone and shouted, “Even if I die in battle, I will never make peace with the northern lands! If anyone says that again, I will kill them without mercy!”

“Your Courage is commendable,”the black-robed man said calmly in the air.

“That’s good too. From today onwards, the Heavenly Cloud sect will become history!”

“Everyone, listen up and kill!”

With the northern lands joining in, the Heavenly Cloud sect, which originally had the upper hand, immediately fell into a disadvantageous position.

However, the deputy sect master was still waiting. He was waiting for the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s people to return, waiting for the sect master to come out of closed-door cultivation.

...

After spending nearly two days, Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing finally arrived at the Falling Life Valley.

This place could be said to be truly devoid of human habitation. It was located in the middle of a huge valley.

Standing in the valley, was there the sound of the wind blowing? It was extremely ear-piercing.

“Brother Qin, this is the place,”Zhuo Jing said as he looked to the side.

“Brother Qin, Brother Zhuo!”

As he was speaking, Li Yingying ran over from not far away.

When he saw Li Yingying, Qin Yu’s brows instantly tensed up.

“Why is she here?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Zhuo Jing explained, “Brother Qin, she also wants to protect you.”

“Protect me?”Qin Yu’s expression turned cold, and then he said coldly, “I don’t need her to protect me. Let Her Go.”

Zhuo Jing suddenly looked a little embarrassed, and Li Yingying was even more furious.

She suppressed the anger in her heart and tried her best to keep a smile. “Brother Qin, let me help you a little. Take it as an apology for what happened before.”

Qin Yu knew that this Li Yingying was like a dog skin plaster that could not be shaken off, so he did not waste his breath.

He looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Brother Zhuo, it’s up to you.”

Zhuo Jing’s palm shook, and the Silver Spring was instantly held in his hand.

“Please rest assured, Brother Qin,”said Zhuo Jing.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He strode into the canyon and found a perfect place to sit down.

Then, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and began to make a breakthrough.

A trace of internal Qi circulated in his body like a swimming dragon. Finally, it gathered in one part of his body and began to make a breakthrough.

“Hu...”

In an instant, a strong wind blew in the falling life valley. Dark clouds began to gather in the sky.

“The tribulation is about to begin,”Zhuo Jing raised his head to look at the scene and said in a low voice.

Li Yingying remained silent. Her face was ice-cold, and countless thoughts formed in her heart.

The dark clouds in the sky became denser and denser, blotting out the sky and covering the sun, turning the day into night.

Below, Qin Yu’s body emitted waves of golden light!
