Both sides emitted intense killing intent and could attack at any time.

“If you don’t use the white bone club, I can kill you with just a raise of my hand,”Yong Ji coldly berated.

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “Don’t worry, I don’t need the white bone club to deal with you!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After saying that, he teng took the initiative to attack. Relying on his extremely powerful spatial spell, he pulled Yong Ji into the void!

Before Yongji could react, he teng had already started chanting an incantation and activated an extremely powerful ancient spell!

The space instantly collapsed, and Yongji, who was inside the space, was instantly suppressed!

“Ah! !”

However, Yongji was not an unknown person. He exploded with an extremely powerful aura, shattering the space in one move and escaping! Internal Qi and internal Qi were both extremely powerful!

“You really have some ability.”Yong Ji wiped the blood stains on his body and said coldly.

He Teng said darkly, “This is only the beginning...”

After saying that, both sides once again unleashed their spells and began the second round of collision.

...

Weapon Refining City.

Master Zheng Yang swallowed the pill while Tempering Qin Yu’s body.

The Flames changed again and again. Qin Yu’s body was destroyed and reassembled countless times!

On this day, Qin Yu’s body suddenly emitted a fiery-red radiance!

This radiance was like a red-hot iron, boiling hot and containing a terrifying heat!

“It’s going to be done!”Master Zhengyang seemed to have sensed something!

As a master blacksmith, he was extremely sensitive to the formation of divine weapons!

Qin Yu, who was sitting in the cauldron, also suddenly stood up!

The layer of red brilliance on his body was falling off bit by bit, and under the red brilliance, it seemed to be hiding some unusual brilliance!

Crack

Finally, a crisp sound was heard, and the fiery red brilliance on his body fell off as if he was shedding his skin!

In the next second, the golden brilliance broke through everything and shattered all the skin on his body!

Boom

The light burst out of Qin Yu’s body like a sun, rushing tens of thousands of miles!

The entire refining city was covered by the light. They all looked up at Master Zhengyang’s Palace!

“It’s in Master Zhengyang’s direction.”

“It seems that master Zhengyang has refined another top-tier divine weapon!”

“Divine weapon, my ass! It’s Qin Yu’s body!”

Wen Wentu and Xiao Cao’s father were also enveloped by this light.

They didn’t think too much and immediately rushed over in the direction of the light!

Master Zhengyang’s palace had already been dispersed by this powerful internal Qi. In the ruins stood a young man whose entire body was like gold!

Every inch of the young man’s skin was golden. Even his hair stood up at this moment, like vertical golden needles!

This strange scene couldn’t help but make master Zhengyang pale with fright!

“This... This is clearly a sign of the birth of a divine weapon!”Master Zhengyang swallowed his saliva.

Before he could speak, a strange color appeared on the horizon.

The strange color covered Qin Yu’s body, and it looked extremely magical!

When he saw this scene, master Zhengyang was completely stunned!

Because this strange scene was the sign of the birth of a heaven rank divine weapon!

“The physical body... can really be tempered like a divine weapon!”Master Zheng Yang exclaimed!

Right at this moment, Wen Wanyi had already rushed over.

He looked at Qin Yu, who was covered in golden light, and immediately stepped forward.

“How is it? Is it done?”Wen wanyi asked impatiently.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “This physical body has already stepped into the return to void realm.”

Reversion Void Stage!

This was a term that was filled with mystery in the entire Southern Region!

One had to know that it had been many years since a top-notch martial artist of the reversion void stage had appeared in the Southern Region!

Although Qin Yu’s body was only at the reversion void stage, as long as the word ‘reversion void’was mentioned, it was definitely not something that a mighty realm expert could compare to!

Qin Yu’s body was originally strong, but now that he had stepped into the reversion void stage, who didn’t know just how terrifying his strength would be!

Qin Yu looked at Wen wanye and said, “Master, please use your strongest spell to attack me.”

Wen Wanye was stunned, then he laughed loudly and said, “I have the same intention. Come!”

After saying that, Wen wanye raised both of his hands, and a terrifying spiritual power immediately gathered in his hands!

A powerful pressure swept out in all directions, and the entire ground collapsed in an instant!

A violent wind swept out, causing the entire palace to shake with a loud boom!

Fortunately, this palace was personally built by Master Zhengyang. Otherwise, it would have been reduced to ruins long ago!

At this moment, a huge axe suddenly condensed in the sky!

This huge axe flickered with a sharp radiance, and was as big as a small mountain. It was extremely terrifying!

Veins popped up on Wen Wanji’s arms. he shouted angrily, “Qin Yu, I’m Coming!”

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly. He put away all his spells and waited quietly for the arrival of the huge axe!

“Ha!”

Wen Wentong shouted and the huge axe instantly came crashing down, heading straight for Qin Yu’s head!

This was formed from pure spiritual Qi, and its power was extremely terrifying. There were even rumors that this spell came from the great Yue Mountain!

However, Qin Yu was unmoved by such a fierce spell. He planned to use his physical body to withstand it!

Everyone held their breath and watched this scene nervously.

Some people even closed their eyes and couldn’t bear to continue watching!

“Boom!”

Finally, the huge axe fell! An extremely terrifying sound exploded above Qin Yu’s head!

Just this sound alone was enough to force everything in the surroundings back! Even this palace seemed to be unable to withstand it!

Smoke and dust rose into the air. The ground under Qin Yu’s feet had already been shattered, and his body had been forcefully smashed into the ground.

With his feet as the center, everything in the surroundings had been shattered. Only Qin Yu stood there, not moving an inch!

The huge axe slowly disappeared above his head. Qin Yu reached out his hand to touch his head, but he was not injured in the slightest.

“A chaotic body at the reversion void stage... is actually so terrifying!”

Not far away, Wen Wanli swallowed his saliva!

He could hardly believe this scene because he knew clearly in his heart how powerful this spell was!

“It’s done, it’s really done!”Master Zhengyang also cheered excitedly!

The reason was none other than that this physical body was refined by his hand!

Before everyone could regain their senses, Qin Yu had already shot up!

He clenched his fist and headed straight for a certain spot!

Master Zhengyang took a closer look. Qin Yu’s target was none other than his divine general!

“Damn it, Stop!”Master Zhengyang was instantly anxious. This divine general had spent countless of his efforts!

However, no one could stop Qin Yu at this moment. Even the most powerful Wen Wanli could not do it!

“Clang!”

Finally, under everyone’s watchful eyes, Qin Yu’s Iron Fist landed squarely on the divine general!

The deafening sound caused everyone to cover their ears. However, everyone’s eyes were looking straight at Qin Yu.
