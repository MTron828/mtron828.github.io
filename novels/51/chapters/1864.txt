1865 Battle Against the Tong Family

Looking at the corpse, Tong Guangqing was reluctant to acknowledge it.

Although he did not like Tong Haoyang, everybody could see his strength. How did he die at the hands of a puny Qin Yu?

“You sent trash to kill me. You’re so stupid!” Qin Yu shouted, indirectly confirming Tong Haoyang’s identity!

Uncle Guan frowned slightly. He looked up at Qin Yu and said, “It must be someone else from your Demon-slaying Peak who did it, right?”

“Is there a need to? D*mned old man, you were also one of those who went to Nanzhou, right?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Uncle Guan’s face changed slightly, and he instantly shouted, “Little b*stard, do you know who you’re talking to?”

Qin Yu raised his head and laughed. He then raised his hand and slapped Uncle Guan!

Golden radiance shot out as if it was going to crush everything!

In front of so many people, Uncle Guan naturally would not dodge. He snorted coldly and waved his sleeve instantly, raising his hand to receive the attack.

“Boom!”

The moment they came into contact, all the radiance and techniques vanished.

Uncle Guan stumbled back a few steps and almost fell to the ground!

He only felt his arm go numb, and his bones were as if going to shatter! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Uncle Guan’s face finally showed a grave expression seeing such terrifying power.

“I’m here today to suppress your Tong family,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Tong Guangqing narrowed his eyes. He suddenly sneered and said, “Demon-slaying Peak doesn’t allow avenging personal grudge. Why did you bring ten or so people from Demon-slaying Peak to my Tong family?”

At this moment, the peak master stepped forward and said indifferently, “Someone provided evidence of the Tong family’s evil deeds to Demon-slaying Peak. We spent ten days or so verify it. Therefore today, we’re here not to take revenge but to slay the demons.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

He glanced at the peak master and seemed to understand something now.

No wonder this matter dragged on for so long. It turned out that the Hall of Justice had sent people to investigate.

However, how did they not know it was slander if they had investigated?

“What bullsh*t evidence? You’re talking nonsense. Do you dare to take it out?” Tong Guangqing shouted.

The peak master placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “We don’t have a such obligation.”

“Hahaha! He who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find his stick. It’s alright. My Tong family isn’t afraid of your Demon-slaying Peak!” Tong Guangqing shouted.

Qin Yu looked at Tong Guangqing coldly. He took a deep breath and said, “If you hand over Jue Wu now, I might consider leaving you with an intact corpse.”

Hearing this, Tong Guangqing instantly sneered and said, “Qin Yu, I’ll say the same thing to you. If you return my things, you might be able to see Jue Wu.”

“You’re courting death!” Qin Yu shouted angrily, and an extremely terrifying internal qi suddenly burst out from his body!

Following that, he stomped his feet and closed in on Tong Guangqing with his Golden Fist!

“Protect the young master!” Uncle Guan hurriedly shouted!

The Tong family’s elders and guest elders immediately stood in front of Tong Guangqing. Their bodies emitted a dazzling radiance as they received Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu was indeed too powerful. Like an arrow released from a bow, he was extremely sharp and forced everything back. It seemed that no technique could stop him!

The fist that was as hot as the sun, forced everyone to step back and steered straight for Tong Guangqing!

Tong Guangqing’s expression changed drastically. He did not dare to be slow and quickly cast a technique. A gigantic plaque suddenly appeared in front of him!

The plaque looked real, and it protected Tong Guangqing.

Qin Yu ignored it. He snorted coldly and his strength rose again. He smashed the plaque with his full power.

“Boom!”

The plaque that was condensed was not worth mentioning in front of Qin Yu. It was instantly crushed.

The terrifying aftershock pushed Tong Guangqing, who could not dodge in time, back a few steps. And he spat out a mouthful of blood!

Uncle Guan snorted coldly and immediately stepped forward, once again blocking in front of Tong Guangqing.

He exuded a strong fighting spirit and said coldly, “You dare to come to my Tong family and act atrociously? I think you’re courting death!”

Qin Yu looked at Uncle Guan in front of her and said coldly, “D*mned old thing, I’ll take your life today!”

Following that, many people came from all directions. The Tong family also asked for the help of their guest elders and hangers-on.

With Qin Yu’s attack, the battle began.

The first to make a move was Chang Mang. His massive body was like an enraged bull, and his pot-like fists contained a power that could destroy the world. Wherever he passed, no one could block him.

Jiu Xiao and the peak master did not waste time and joined the battlefield.

Although Demon-slaying Peak didn’t have the advantage in terms of number, those who joined Demon-slaying Peak were all top heaven’s favorites. Needless to say, they were all strong each was strong enough to fight against ten people!

It was an extremely terrifying battle. Light flashed everywhere and blood spilled everywhere. In a short time, the Tong family had become a carnage.

The anger that Qin Yu had been suppressing for many days finally exploded on this day. His terrifying iron fist swept across everything, forcing Uncle Guan and the others to retreat!

The more Uncle Guan fought, the more frightened he became. Qin Yu’s terrifying combat strength was totally beyond his imagination. Even a wisp of light that spilled out could take a person’s life!

Tong Guangqing looked at the scene in front of him and could not help but grit his teeth.

Qin Yu’s target was him. With Tong Guangqing’s strength, he was unable to fight. He could only hide in the dark and be prepared to escape at any time.

More and more people joined the battlefield. A large number of the Tong family’s hangers-on came to help. Countless secret techniques soared into the sky, causing thunder to rumble in all directions.

No one would have imagined such a terrifying conflict to suddenly erupt in Zhongzhou, more so a move against the aristocratic family of Zhongzhou!

All of the ancient buildings in the Tong family couldn’t withstand the terrifying pressure and were destroyed. Countless people died under the light, turning into corpses one after another.

...

At this moment, the Tong family’s mountain protection formation was activated!

Terrifying light burst out from the gates in four directions. The light shot up into the sky and covered everything.

“Buzz!”

A holy sound slowly rang out, as if summoning some kind of terrifying existence.

The entire Tong family was suddenly wrapped in a thick fog, blocking everyone’s vision.

Before the crowd could panic, a giant beast suddenly burst out!

It seemed to be an Azure Dragon. Its body was incredibly huge, and its pair of cold eyes looked down at the crowd. The tongue that it flicked out was emitting exceptionally terrifying internal qi.

This Azure Dragon was the Tong family’s Mountain Guardian Divine Beast. It was a True Saint that came from the Tong family and could protect the Tong family away from death!

Everyone was shocked by the Azure Dragon, and they were stunned for a moment.

At this point, the Azure Dragon’s eyes erupted with a flame-like radiance and swept over!

Those who couldn’t dodge in time had half of their bodies instantly burned away. As for those who were unyielding and received the attack with divine artifacts, their flesh and bones were directly shattered!
