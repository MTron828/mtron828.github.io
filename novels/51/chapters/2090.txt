2091 You’re Trash!

Yan Ruoxue did not answer but said with a sly tone, “Are you afraid?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “A little scared, but I definitely won’t agree.”

“You don’t agree? But what if the Yan family insists?” Yan Ruoxue continued to ask.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Then I’ll take you away from the Yan family! We’ll go wander all over the world together, flee together!”

“Good idea!” Yan Ruoxue’s eyes lit up as she whispered, “It’s settled. I’ll think of a way to run away from the Yan family before the day of the Path of Heaven!”

Qin Yu was stunned. He was merely joking, but now it seemed Yan Ruoxue was serious about it.

“You… really want to leave with me?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“What? You’re not willing?” Yan Ruoxue pretended to be unhappy.

“It’s not that I’m unwilling. It’s just that it will be very tough. I’m afraid you won’t be able to take it…” Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

Yan Ruoxue was born with a silver spoon. She had never suffered any hardship.

If she were to live a fugitive life, Qin Yu would feel uncomfortable.

“I won’t find it tough. I’ll definitely be happy every day when I’m with you.” Yan Ruoxue’s imagination began to run wild.

Seeing this, Qin Yu instantly nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll pick you up and leave. If you fail to escape, I’ll go and snatch you!”

“Alright!” Yan Ruoxue also nodded vigorously. She seemed to have just tasted the fruit of madness and appeared a little excited.

“Miss Yan, it’s time for us to pay a visit to the Teng family.” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue heard Uncle Yan’s voice in her mind.

Yan Ruoxue did not utter a sound. She looked at Qin Yu and said, “I’ll make a move first. See you in a few days. I’ll speed it up.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu nodded in agreement.

Yan Ruoxue walked away quickly after she finished speaking.

Looking at Yan Ruoxue’s back, Qin Yu felt a little upset.

That feeling was like a rich girl was willing to give up a good life for a poor boy.

“Sooner or later, the Yan family will accept me voluntarily,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, several phantoms appeared in front of the Teng family’s small world.

Following their appearance, the scene instantly became much quieter.

“It’s the Teng family,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At a glance, the leader was an elderly man with a sage-like appearance. This old man was none other than the head of the Teng family.

The head of the Teng family was called Teng Tian. His eyes were bright and full of spirit, revealing an indescribable majesty.

He had long and thick hair that was as black as ink. It formed a sharp contrast with his thick white beard. He wore a loose dark blue Daoist robe embroidered with clouds and mist patterns. Whenever he moved, he seemed to carry a mysterious aura.

Unlike the other aristocratic families, such as the Holy Lord of the Si family, who did not have high cultivation but only the power of the Si family, Teng Tian’s cultivation had nearly become a legend in the eyes of everyone in the world. He was called “Daoist Teng”. His cultivation was unfathomable, and no one knew what cultivation realm he was at.

Following the appearance of the head of the Teng family, the various aristocratic families came forward with generous gifts to express their gratitude and congratulations.

Si Qianjing took the lead and walked forward. He bowed slightly and said with a faint smile, “Congratulations to the Teng family’s Holy Son for stepping into the True Saint cultivation realm. My Si family has particularly presented a ten-thousand-year-old immortal medicine as a congratulatory gift.”

The cultivator beside Teng Tian received the congratulatory gift and walked to the side. Teng Tian cupped his hands and said, “Thanks to Brother Si for taking the time to congratulate us.”

After that, Holy Son Jiang walked forward as well.

He looked graceful and elegant, no longer devious like just now.

He handed the congratulatory gift to Teng Tian and said, “Uncle Teng, my father really can’t make it and has specially asked me to come and congratulate you.”

“You’re welcome. Please send my regards to your father as well.” Teng Tian stroked his beard and smiled.

The various aristocratic families stepped forward one after another, handing the gifts in their hands to Teng Tian.

They were extremely generous with their gifts. They seemed to attach great importance to the Teng family.

At this moment, Qin Yu also walked forward with a congratulatory gift.

Qin Yu’s appearance immediately attracted the attention of many people, especially Si Qianjing. His expression was tremendously cold as if he wanted to swallow Qin Yu alive.

“On behalf of Thunder Courtyard, I would like to congratulate the Teng family.” Qin Yu handed the gift in his hand to Teng Tian.

After receiving the gift, Teng Tian smiled and said, “Speaking of which, I haven’t seen Dean Lei for a long time. I wonder how he is doing?”

“He’s doing great. Not long ago, he even suppressed a dozen of us.” Si Qianjing snorted coldly. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, Teng Tian ignored what Si Qianjing had said. Instead, he stroked his beard and laughed, “Back then, Dean Lei was remarkably elegant. After so long, I think his cultivation has long advanced further, right?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Senior, I don’t know about Dean Lei’s cultivation. But I think he’s much stronger than Si Qianjing, a True Saint nearing the end of his life.”

Si Qianjing’s face darkened, but he couldn’t find a suitable response.

After all, Qin Yu was telling the truth. Dean Lei alone had defeated a dozen of True Saints.

Si Qianjing took a deep breath, snorted, and said, “Qin Yu, looking at the congratulatory gift in your hand, could it be the Traceless Immortal Scripture?”

“Traceless Immortal Scripture? The Traceless Immortal Scripture has been unearthed?” Teng Tian said in surprise.

Si Qianjing immediately seized the opportunity and said, “It seems that Sir Teng is not aware that not long ago, Wu Ji’s Big Grave was unearthed. Several aristocratic families joined forces to attack the Chaos Grave, but in the end, this kid took away the Traceless Immortal Scripture!”

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. Si Qianjing was obviously trying to attack him using the strength of another.

Teng Tian laughed out loud and said, “Traceless Immortal Scripture is not an ordinary thing. Even the various tribulation cultivators after Wu Ji had wanted to read it. I didn’t expect it to fall into your hands in the end.”

Qin Yu knew he could no longer hide it, so he nodded and said, “It was just luck.”

“If you knew it’s by luck, you should hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture. That kind of holy item is not something you can get your hand on it,” Si Qianjing said coldly.

Qin Yu felt increasingly displeased. He glanced at Si Qianjing and cursed, “F*ck you! You talk so much! I can’t get my hands on it, but you can? You’re trash!”

There was a moment of stunned silence. It then immediately became completely quiet.

It seemed that no one had expected Qin Yu to say such treasonous words in front of so many important figures in the Holy Region!

“Qin Yu, mind your manners!” Si Qianjing said angrily.

Qin Yu’s face darkened, and he said, “I can’t be bothered with you. You non-stop babble. If I don’t scold you, you don’t know what’s going on, do you? I’m telling you, I won’t give the Traceless Immortal Scripture to you. Moreover, when I master the Traceless Immortal Scripture, you’ll be the first person I kill!”
