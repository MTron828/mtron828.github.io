2511 Forcing out the Trump Card

“How can a mere little monster do anything to me? By the way, how is the situation outside after I went into retreat?”

He was immersed in deducing the mystery of He Teng’s demonic body just now and had forgotten about this matter for a moment.

“Let’s go to Huaning Mountain. Dean Lei and Flower Granny are there too.”

Yan Ruoxue moved her right hand, and Qin Yu felt a violent fluctuation.

The Sumeru ring shuttled rapidly into the depths of space. This speed was much faster than under Qin Yu’s control.

Not long after, the two returned to Huaning Mountain.

“Brat, I knew nothing could happen to you!”

Chang Mang suddenly punched Qin Yu’s chest. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Haha, of course.” Qin Yu returned the punch.

“Wow, your physical strength is simply terrifying!”

Under this punch, even if it was just physical strength.

Chang Mang grimaced in pain, his bones cracking.

“Dean, Flower Granny.”

Seeing the two, Qin Yu stopped playing with Chang Mang.

He and Yan Ruxue walked forward and joined them.

“Qin Yu, since you could resist He Teng’s strongest attack with the Way of Anomaly, you’ve achieved something on this path. You can also respond to the two brothers, Xiao Sheng and Xiao Hai!”

Lei Xin’s face was full of praise. He had seen how terrifying that attack was.

However, he did not expect Qin Yu to survive. Based on this point, many recognized Qin Yu’s path of anomaly.

“I was fortunate enough to survive. At the last moment, I comprehended a special power that recovered the demonic body, which saved my life. However, there is still a huge gap between me and He Teng. We can comprehend this power together some other day.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. Lei Xin’s words made him blush.

“Even Xiao Sheng, Teng Zixu, and the others dare not say they can survive this attack. The number one Godly King of the monster race is indeed worthy of his title.”

“Let me explain it to everyone. This is the first time since the Path of Heaven of Primordial Chaos that the elites of the three alien races attacked the human race together. The loss ratio of the human race to the three alien races is about 1:2, which is a rare and precious victory.”

Qin Yu nodded.

This time, the alien race invaded the human race. Apart from the demon race, which was relatively near to the human race, the other two races had to go through a long spatial passageway to reach the human race.

In terms of numbers, the human race had an absolute advantage.

Moreover, although the human race did not have a wide range of joint attack techniques, the various sects and families cooperated well.

Therefore, with the advantage in number, it was considered a relatively normal situation to have a 1:2 death ratio.

“However, there’s a piece of bad news. Qin Yu, you might not know about it. Xiao Hai, the masked woman, and many Yama Kings have also descended from the ghost realm. The masked woman has already touched the threshold of above the fifth level. This time, Yan Tianfeng is missing from the human race, while the ghost realm has an additional above the fifth level. This is tremendously bad news for the human race.”

Lei Xin smiled bitterly and said. Xiao Hai alone had already caused the human race to be incredibly sorry.

If Si Shiyue hadn’t come out of seclusion to stop Xiao Hai, Xiao Hai might have been able to turn some situations around.

When it came to the masked woman, it was already on the verge of collapse.

“There’s a masked woman in addition! How will the human race deal with it!”

Qin Yu’s face was a little pale. He did not expect that during this time when his body shattered, there were so many unforeseen events.

Especially when the masked woman broke through to the fifth level and above. It made his hair stand on end.

Was this mysterious masked woman who had been active for many Path of Heaven years finally going to show her terrifying edge during this chaotic time?

“The human race has won and lost. In ancient times, before the human race’s Heavenly Emperor challenged the Path of Heaven, some Immortal Emperors seemed to have predicted the ominous signs. They joined forces to set up the Heaven-slaying Formation among the various stars in the universe. It’s also the last life-saving method of the human race.”

Flower Granny told everything that had happened in detail. Initially, she and Lei Xin did not know about it either.

However, after the battle, they only discovered this after the higher-ups meeting of the human race.

Among the human race, scarcely more than a handful of people knew about this secret.

“If it was set up by the Immortal Emperor, what happened after the formation was activated?”

Everyone was unknowingly engrossed in listening. They did not sense the internal qi the formation being activated during the battle earlier on.

However, not long after the masked woman appeared, the alien race suddenly retreated.

“Immortal Crane sensed the activation of the formation in advance. The demon crown had already been refined. According to Revered Qi and the others, Immortal Crane seemed to have entered a deeper cultivation realm. Therefore, the moment the formation was activated, he and Ksitigarbha joined forces to transfer everyone.”

Flower Granny smiled bitterly and said, “They’ve long used the Supreme Path of Heaven to set up spatial coordinates. This operation seems to be to force out this top-secret trump card of the human race. Otherwise, their operation this time would be meaningless.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly as he thought of a demon race he had encountered on Earth.

At this moment, it was actually the Lord of the demon realm. This kind of unforeseen event made him feel a significant impact.

“According to the speculation of the higher-ups of the human race, this formation has existed for too long. Many of the coordinates of the stars have already changed, and the activation has become very slow. The other point is that Immortal Crane and Ksitigarbha have worked together to deduce and seem to have long discovered the human race has a secret. Therefore, they have made full preparations in advance. These factors combined have led to the failure of the Heaven-slaying Formation.”

Lei Xin shook his head, feeling a pity.

If they had known the location of this formation, the human race would have been invincible.

None of the higher-ups had thought of using this Heaven-slaying Formation.

Because as long as they had this trump card in their hands, the foundation of the human race would not be in danger.

The alien race definitely dared not attack with all their might.

However, they changed their mind when the three races’ elites came here. If they could kill all the three races’ elites, the alien races would no longer pose any threat to the humans.

When the masked woman came out, all the higher-ups had no choice but to activate the Heaven-slaying Formation.

This fifth level and above could slaughter the future of the human race if it was not activated. No one could stop it.

Qin Yu thought of a terrifying possibility. What if all of this was a bait…
