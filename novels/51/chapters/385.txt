Chapter 386: Purple Spirit Fire! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s actions caused waves of admiration from the crowd.

Even the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was somewhat moved.

“This kid is simply crazy.” Qiao Wu couldn’t help but grit his teeth.

He pushed open the door and turned to leave.

“Where are you going?” The person beside him asked.

Qiao Wu said coldly, “We can’t let him succeed. Think of a way to stop him!”

“Stop him? Can’t you see that there are so many people down there?” The Inner Strength Grandmaster beside him snorted coldly.

“The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is still standing there. Do you think she won’t do anything?”

Qiao Wu gnashed his teeth and said, “We can’t care about that anymore. Let’s act according to the circumstances.”

After saying that, Qiao Wu turned his head and walked out of the hotel. He carefully walked towards the direction of the stairway to heaven.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already climbed up to the seventeenth level with great difficulty.

The moment he touched the seventeenth level, his entire body was suddenly enveloped in flames!

This flame came from the inside out, and even his internal organs were affected!

Even the blood that flowed out of his body had turned into a sea of flames at this moment!

“Qin Yu!” Below, everyone immediately shouted out in alarm!

Qin Yu’s entire body was enveloped in flames. These flames were about to devour his physical body and divine sense!

“Body and soul are destroyed...” The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion muttered in a low voice. A look of unease flashed across her face.

No one had forcefully charged up the stairway to heaven, so no one knew what would happen!

If the result of forcefully charging up the stairway to heaven was the destruction of his body and soul, then everything would be over!

“Ah!!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Under the cover of the flames, Qin Yu still didn’t give up!

His body was almost shriveled up, and his blood seemed to have been burnt dry!

“I must obtain the Meridian Circulation Technique!!” Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, his body flashed with golden light!

Strands of divine sense power flew out from between his brows!

This divine sense power actually transformed into Qin Yu’s body and charged towards the eighteenth level!

“This... this is divine sense?” At this moment, the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was also dumbstruck!

That ball of flames seemed to have regained its senses and rushed towards Qin Yu’s divine sense!

But right at this moment, Qin Yu’s body actually stretched out his hand!

On his almost crippled hand, there were traces of blue spiritual fire.

Under Qin Yu’s powerful control, this spiritual fire transformed into a large hand!

The huge hand extended forward and grabbed the ball of heavenly fire!

The collision between the spiritual fire and the heavenly fire began at this moment!

“Ah!!” Qin Yu’s eyes were about to split open as he roared furiously!

And at this moment, Qin Yu’s divine sense actually entered the spiritual fire!

Following that, the ball of blue spiritual fire transformed into Qin Yu’s appearance!

“What kind of technique is this?!” Everyone was shocked by this scene!

Even the experienced and knowledgeable Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had a flash of confusion in her eyes.

The combination of spiritual fire and divine sense? It was unheard of!

How did this kid do it?!!

Qin Yu, who had the body of spiritual fire, had a violent collision with this heavenly fire!

This spiritual fire seemed to contain Qin Yu’s unyielding will!

He clenched his fist and rose up, then his blue fist fiercely punched toward that ball of heavenly fire!

“Phew!”

The heavenly fire was formless and boundless!

Qin Yu’s fist couldn’t touch the heavenly fire at all!

The heavenly fire dissipated and came again, endlessly!

If this continued, Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to hold on at all!

“Whoever dares to stop me, I will kill him!” Qin Yu roared crazily! The spiritual fire actually soared at this moment!

At a glance, it was like there was a blue giant standing on the stairway to heaven!

“Don’t even think about stopping me!” Qin Yu’s voice sounded unhinged, causing people to feel a chill run down their spines!

And in the next second, Qin Yu’s actions shocked everyone even more!

They saw Qin Yu, who was transformed from a ball of spiritual fire, open his mouth and forcefully swallow this ball of heavenly fire!

“Is... is he crazy?!” The Fifth Elder exclaimed in shock.

“Elder Qin... actually swallowed the heavenly fire?”

“Pavilion Master, who... who is he responding to?”

No one knew the consequences of this action, not even the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“Phew...”

The blue flames wrapped around the red heavenly fire.

The heavenly fire rampaged through the spiritual fire before dyeing the entire spiritual fire red from a small flame!

“Oh no!” When everyone saw this, they couldn’t help but gasp!

Did Qin Yu... fail?

Finally, the spiritual fire backlashed at this moment!

The two balls of flames were continuously entangling and fusing!

This process was very long, as if it was a confrontation!

Everyone was on edge and they clenched their fists tightly.

This scene was unprecedented!

“Huh?”

Just as everyone was panicking, the Pavilion Master’s eyes flashed.

“Don’t tell me... It’s the same as what I thought?” At this moment, the Pavilion Master was no longer aloof. Instead, she covered her mouth like a young girl.

“Pavilion Master, what’s wrong?” The Fifth Elder hurriedly asked.

The Pavilion Master pointed at the flames on the stairway to heaven and said, “Look, these two flames seem to be merging.”

It was just as the Pavilion Master said.

“Blue and red merging... purple spiritual fire?” The Fifth Elder was the first to realize it.

“That’s right.” The Pavilion Master nodded slightly.

As soon as she finished speaking, a faint purple color slowly condensed in the center of the two flames!

The instant the purple color appeared, it spread out at an extremely fast speed!

In just a few minutes, the heavenly fire and the spiritual fire disappeared and were replaced by a purple flame!

That flame still resembled Qin Yu’s appearance. From below, it looked extremely domineering!

“Phew...”

A gust of strong wind blew, and the flame rushed towards Qin Yu’s body.

Finally, things quieted down.

Qin Yu collapsed on the stairway to heaven.

Everyone watched this scene nervously. Their eyes were fixed on Qin Yu, and they were extremely worried.

Half a minute later, Qin Yu, who was lying on the stairway, slowly stood up.

He opened his palm, and a ball of purple spiritual fire danced in it.

“Yeah! He did it!”

Waves of cheers immediately came from below!

Even the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was extremely moved at this moment.

“This kid... is really beyond imagination,” the Pavilion Master muttered softly.

No one would have thought that Qin Yu would have such a bold idea at this critical moment!

On the stairway to heaven, Qin Yu remained silent.

The next step was that big hand. As long as he stepped on it, he would be able to obtain the Meridian Circulation Technique.

Furthermore, Qin Yu would become the first person in history to forcefully step on the stairway to heaven!

Qin Yu’s expression became extremely calm. He took a step forward and walked towards that big hand.

“Don’t even think about stepping on the stairway to heaven!”

At this moment, a loud shout came from the darkness!

Following that, a huge hand fiercely slapped towards Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu!” Below, the Fifth Elder immediately shouted anxiously!
