Chapter 777: Heading to the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Chen Huang’s expression changed drastically.

He subconsciously looked at the two people who had turned into skeletons beside him, and his forehead couldn’t help but break out in cold sweat.

“F * ck you!”

At this moment, Chen Huang suddenly made a move. His hand flashed with light and headed straight for Qin Yu’s glabella!

Qin Yu was already prepared. He couldn’t help but snort coldly and immediately waved his hand, sending Chen Huang flying with a slap!

This slap was extremely powerful, almost breaking half of Chen Huang’s face bone.

Chen Huang fell to the ground in a sorry state!

“I don’t want to die. Please spare me...” Chen Huang was afraid.

In the face of death, everyone revealed their most vulnerable side.

Qin Yu looked down at Chen Huang and said, “Tell me, where did you bring Yan Ruoxue?”

Chen Huang hurriedly said, “I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you everything!”

“That day, Granny Qin asked me to bring Yan Ruoxue to the true martial arts room of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. After I put her down, I chased us out.”

“I don’t know anything else. I only know that she was brought to the true martial arts room!”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “True martial arts room? Where is that?”

Chen Huang hurriedly said, “It’s in a mansion in the depths of the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy! Ask Xia Hang. Xia Hang knows!”

Qin Yu sized up Chen Huang and said, “You’re not lying to me, right?”

“I swear, I’m absolutely not lying to you!” Chen Huang hurriedly explained.

Qin Yu nodded. Then, a light flashed on his palm and directly shattered Chen Huang’s divine sense.

Since he suspected Xia Hang, then Qin Yu would never let him live.

Then, Qin Yu used the spiritual fire to finish off the three corpses and left in a hurry all the way back to Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.

Qin Yu took out his phone and called Xia Hang.

“Where is the true martial arts room?” Qin Yu went straight to the point.

Xia Hang said, “The true martial arts room? That is an important place of Jingdu Martial Arts Academy. I have never seen it before.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “How can I go in?”

Xia Hang smiled bitterly and said, “Even I don’t have the qualifications to go in...”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and thought to himself, “I have to find an opportunity to sneak in and take a look.”

After he hung up the phone, Qin Yu calculated the time.

There was still one day left before the time the Pavilion Master mentioned.

Therefore, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry. He brought the man with the mustache out and planned to buy a Spatial Magic Artifact.

“Spatial Magic Artifacts aren’t common items. If you want to buy them, I’m afraid you can only go to the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets,” said the man with the mustache.

“Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Not long ago, Qin Yu had offended the young master of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets. If he went to the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets Now, he would definitely be in trouble.

“Other than the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets, is there no other place to buy them?” Asked Qin Yu.

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “It’s very difficult, unless you’re looking for it at an auction, but there aren’t any auctions in the near future.”

Qin Yu thought for a while and said, “Forget about him. Maybe Luo Yang isn’t here at all.”

Thus, Qin Yu left the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy with the man with the mustache and rushed toward the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

The entrance of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets was very imposing. The door had a statue of a dragon and a tiger fighting. Looking in from the entrance, it was dark.

Standing at the entrance, one could feel the pressure emanating from it.

Above the entrance, there were a few big words: Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

“This is the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The man with the mustache licked his lips and said, “There are countless treasures here.”

Qin Yu said jokingly, “Why didn’t you come here to search for treasure?”

“Come here? Do you know what searching for treasures is? Searching for treasures is searching for leftovers. There are experts here, so I can’t find anything here.” The man with the mustache rolled his eyes.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that.

There were a number of luxury cars parked at the entrance of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

One of the cars attracted Qin Yu’s attention.

It was a Maybach with a Jingdu plate number, and Qin Yu was quite familiar with it.

“A car from the Yan Family?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

As he was speaking, Yan Sihai walked out of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

Beside him was a peak-stage Martial Marquis.

After seeing Qin Yu, Yan Sihai was stunned, and then he sneered. “Qin Yu? Long time no see.”

Qin Yu also sneered. “Yeah, I thought you were dead.”

Yan Sihai raised his eyebrows and said with slight sarcasm, “What? You haven’t rescued Yan Ruoxue yet? If you don’t bring her out, her blood will probably be sucked dry.”

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed, and a burst of killing intent burst out!

Feeling this killing intent, Yan Sihai unconsciously took a step back.

And the peak-stage Martial Marquis beside him quickly stepped forward and blocked in front of Yan Sihai.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Yan Sihai, Yan Ruoxue is your niece after all. Not only are you not anxious, but you’re even proud of her being taken away. You’re really thick-skinned.”

Qin Yu paused for a moment and continued, “But you can even be ruthless to your own biological father, let alone your niece.”

Yan Sihai said with a cold look, “Qin Yu, don’t think that I can’t do anything to you just because you have some achievements now. Remember what kind of society we live in now!”

Qin Yu also sneered and said, “Yan Sihai, if I want to kill you, even if you hire a bodyguard, it’s useless.”

Yan Sihai seemed to feel a sense of danger.

He snorted coldly, then turned around and left.

Looking at Yan Sihai’s departing back, Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Sooner or later, I will take back the Yan family for Old Mister Yan,” Qin Yu snorted coldly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Then, Qin Yu strode into the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets with his man with the mustache.

The Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets had all kinds of weapons and spiritual artifacts.

Some of these spiritual artifacts were purchased, and some were personally forged by them. Each of them was extraordinary.

“I hope I don’t run into Luo Yang,” the man with the mustache muttered.

But the truth was that what one was afraid of came true.

Not far away, Luo Yang was holding a folding fan and striding over.

“Hello, Young Master.” When the surrounding people saw Luo Yang, they all bowed to greet him.

“Damn, what bad luck!” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu pretended not to see Luo Yang and turned his head to the side.

“Qin Yu?”

But even so, he still couldn’t escape.

Luo Yang walked quickly to Qin Yu and said with some ridicule, “Isn’t this the famous Qin Yu? Why would a big shot like you come to my small Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets?”

Seeing that he couldn’t hide, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Young Master Luo, we meet again.”

Luo Yang said sarcastically, “Yeah, I still remember the time you stole my treasure.”

“Do you have that gourd with you?” Luo Yang raised his eyebrows and asked.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and didn’t answer.

At this time, a few people walked over from Luo Yang’s side and surrounded Qin Yu and the man with the mustache.

“To be honest, I’m very interested in that gourd,” Luo Yang said.

“If you’re willing to hand over that gourd, you might be able to avoid the pain of suffering.”
