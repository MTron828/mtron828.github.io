Chapter 1483: Chapter 1,483, the terrifying eighteen gods! 1

Qin Yu’s arms were crossed in front of him, and his body was forced back several steps.

If it wasn’t for the array they had set up behind him, Qin Yu would have been forced back several thousand meters!

By the time the light dissipated, Qin Yu’s arms had already turned pitch black, as if they had been burned.

But what was shocking was that even under such an attack, Qin Yu’s body was still intact, only slightly injured.

This caused everyone to be greatly shocked! And the alchemy king standing in the medicine Saint Hall had a drastic change in expression!

“How could this be!”The Alchemy King grabbed the windowsill and stared fixedly at Qin Yu!

That monstrous power just now was enough to obliterate the entire medicine saint capital! This Qin Yu was actually unharmed? How was this possible!

At this moment, the eighteen gods also seemed to be somewhat shocked. Their eyes also contained some suspicion.

They knew the power of that move the best, but Qin Yu actually withstood it.

Qin Yu raised his head and stared at the eighteen godly men, feeling a little shocked in his heart.

Of course, he was not as relaxed as he looked on the surface.

His physical body had indeed withstood it, but Qin Yu’s internal organs were all affected, and he almost vomited blood.

“We can’t continue like this,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He extended his palm and grabbed the bronze sword again.

Then, Qin Yu grabbed the bronze sword with both hands. Spiritual power surged out as if it had become one with the sword.

In the next second, Qin Yu’s body shot up!

He grabbed the bronze sword with both hands and drew a semicircle in the air!

“Nine absolute beginning slashes, fourth slash!”

Qin Yu’s voice shook all the internal Qi in the surroundings. His powerful aura swept out in all directions like ripples!

A vast and mighty sword light suddenly rose up and condensed in the air.

The enormous sword light blotted out the sky and the sun, shining brilliantly!

This sword could split the sky and split the earth!

Everyone was shocked by this sword, and countless people hurriedly fled.

“This kid is probably going to destroy the medicine Saint Capital!”Someone cried out in alarm!

The timid and cautious even gave up on their own herbs and directly fled the medicine saint capital.

There were also those who weren’t afraid of death and were greedy. No matter what they said, they would take their herbs and leave.

“Slash!”

Accompanied by Qin Yu’s furious roar, the fourth slash of the nine absolute beginning slashes slashed toward the eighteen celestials! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

This was the manifestation of a dao technique. It was an invincible will that shook the heavens and earth!

The future appeared once again, but this time, no one dared to look any further. They all wanted to flee for their lives!

“Boom!”

A loud boom rang out. Finally, the surrounding buildings couldn’t hold on any longer and began to collapse.

The so-called medicine Saint Hall, which hadn’t collapsed for hundreds of years, also began to rumble. In the next second, it collapsed with a loud bang!

It was at this moment that the palms of the eighteen deities suddenly began to emit light.

These lights were densely packed with talismans. They were incomparably mysterious. Their palms moved as if they were evolving some profound dao technique!

In a short moment, these rays of light actually weaved into a small world!

This side of the world was like a prehistoric beast. It opened its bloody mouth, and pitch-black rays of light emitted from it. Following that, it actually directly swallowed Qin Yu’s sword Ray.

Everything turned calm, as if nothing had happened.

And the eighteen gods were still standing there, coldly looking at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression was instantly horrified! What kind of spell was this? What exactly had they evolved?

“You... You!”At this moment, Qin Yu was a little flustered!

No wonder the Heavenly Cloud sect would view the eighteen gods as a great killing weapon. Their abilities were indeed too terrifying!

Qin Yu had never seen such a spell before!

“Just how many trump cards does the heavenly cloud sect have hidden...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, his heart filled with terror.

Such a terrifying technique shook the soul!

Just as Qin Yu was in shock, the eighteen gods once again activated the same technique, re-evolving that world.

This time, what they were devouring was no longer a technique, but Qin Yu himself!

The pitch-black hole gave off a powerful suction force, and in a short moment, the eighteen gods had already arrived in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. This small world could even devour the nine absolute beginning slashes, let alone Qin Yu!

In his panic, Qin Yu clenched his fist and ruthlessly smashed it at one of the eighteen gods!

Perhaps it was because they were releasing calligraphy, but this punch was actually unable to dodge.

With a bang, the eighteen gods’bodies that Qin Yu had smashed into instantly exploded!

And the world that they had condensed also disappeared.

What shocked Qin Yu even more was that even the surrounding spatial array began to disappear at this moment.

Qin Yu was stunned. He didn’t have time to think too much. He immediately activated the line word formula and ran away!

He didn’t even dare to look back. He used all his strength to shoot into the distance, afraid that the eighteen gods would catch up!

He did not know how long he had been running for until Qin Yu’s spiritual power was depleted. Only then did he stop and sit on the ground, panting heavily.

Qin Yu released his divine sense, covering the position within a few stars. Only when he was sure that the eighteen gods had not caught up did he heave a sigh of relief.

“Damn it, what the hell are these eighteen gods...”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

It was too dangerous. Once he was swallowed, everything would probably turn into nothingness.

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn, as if he was thinking about something.

“This spell seems to have a flaw. That is, they must get close to me.”Qin Yu recalled everything that had happened just now.

And if any of them were to be disturbed, their spell would disappear without a trace.

Not only that, the eighteen gods’defensive abilities seemed to be very poor, which also caused them to not easily get close.

“Hu, I wonder if that one is dead,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

According to Qin Yu’s calculation, as long as one of them died, the eighteen gods would cease to exist.

However, Qin Yu’s punch had only shattered his body, so it would probably be very difficult for him to die.

“This won’t do. I have to hurry back to Mount Hua Ning to enter seclusion.”Qin Yu climbed up from the ground, summoned the divine hawk, and rushed toward Mount Hua Ning.

On the other side, in the medicine Saint Capital.

The surroundings were a pile of broken walls. One of the eighteen gods had his body shattered by Qin Yu. He fell to the ground and struggled to get up.

They scanned their surroundings as if they were looking for Qin Yu’s traces.

After their search was fruitless, they picked up the injured God and turned around to leave.

At this moment, the most panicked person was none other than the alchemy king.

His heart was filled with endless terror, and his expression was filled with a hint of terror.

“He... he actually escaped... !”The Alchemist King panted heavily, and his heart was filled with even more panic.

Qin Yu had escaped, which meant that he would definitely come back to find trouble with him.

At that time, he might not even be able to save his life.

After thinking for a moment, the alchemist King no longer cared about his title.

He returned to the almost deserted medicine sacred hall, brought a batch of herbs, and turned around to leave.

His destination was the heavenly cloud sect. Only hiding in the heavenly cloud sect could guarantee his life.

...

Qin Yu sat on the Divine Eagle, slowly recovering his internal Qi.

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu finally returned to Mount Hua Ning.
