2113 Meeting the Pavilion Master Again

Other than that, there were many hidden places in the Alchemist Association, such as the mysterious laboratory, the ancient library, and the legendary medicinal herb garden that hid numerous rare herbs.

Qin Yu, Jue Wu, and Yao Meng walked into the interior of the Alchemist Association and were shocked by everything before their eyes.

“Is… Is this the interior of the Alchemist Association?” Qin Yu could not help but exclaim in admiration. Looking at the ancient alchemy equipment, rare alchemy secret manuals, and unknown rare medicinal herbs, Qin Yu felt incomparably shocked.

Jue Wu also had a look of astonishment. Although she had long heard of the Alchemist Association’s great name, only after seeing everything here did she truly understand how powerful the Alchemy Association was!

“This… This alchemy equipment, alchemy secret manuals, rare herbs, I… I’ve never seen them before!”

Yao Meng was dumbstruck. She stood there quietly as if she was shocked by everything in front of her and could not come to her senses for a long time.

“Is… Is this the Alchemist Association?” Yao Meng asked softly. Her voice trembled as if she was talking about an incomparably amazing thing.

“That’s right. This is the Alchemist Association.” Qin Yu nodded. His eyes were also filled with astonishment.

The Alchemy Association possessed terrifying resources. Even Qin Yu’s heart was filled with a sense of astonishment.

“Only eighth-grade alchemists can enter the Alchemist Association. I’ve violated the rules by bringing all of you in today,” Li Shen stood with his hands behind his back and said calmly.

“Thank you, President Li. I… I have another request,” Qin Yu bowed slightly and said.

Li Shen glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You want to see Ji Yuhong?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu quickly nodded.

Qin Yu’s heart was filled with gratitude toward the Pavilion Master. Ever since they had stepped into the Holy Region, the two had not met again.

“Ji Yuhong wants to see you too. You may go to the side room and wait,” Li Shen said.

Qin Yu was overjoyed and quickly said, “Thank you, President Li!”

“Mmm,” Li Shen responded. He looked at Jue Wu and the others and said, “Come with me.”

As requested by Li Shen, Qin Yu came to a side room.

The side room was not big, but the medicinal fragrance was tremendously strong. There were some alchemy equipment and books in the room as well as a few pots of rare medicinal herbs that emitted a faint medicinal fragrance.

A tea table was in the middle, emitting a faint fragrance. Upon closer look, one could see the Enlightenment Tea.

Qin Yu picked up the teacup and took a sip. He felt refreshed and clear-minded, with an enlightened state of mind.

After a long time, there was some movement outside the door.

The door was gently pushed open at this moment, and a figure walked in. That person was dressed in a long green dress. She was gentle and refined, exuding an ethereal charm.

She had a calm temperament, and her face was delicate. Her narrow and elongated eyes flickered with peculiar brilliance.

And this person was none other than Ji Yuhong!

“Pavilion Master!” Qin Yu cried out in surprise and quickly walked over!

As usual, there was neither joy nor sorrow on Pavillion Master’s face. Her thoughts were unfathomable and impossible to guess.

Immediately after, the Pavilion Master waved her hand, indicating Qin Yu to sit down.

Qin Yu suppressed the excitement in his heart and said with a trembling voice, “Pavilion Master, finally, I’m seeing you again after so long.”

A smile finally appeared on the cold face of the Pavilion Master.

She sized up Qin Yu and said calmly, “The Semi-Saint realm is beyond my expectations.”

Qin Yu felt slightly bitter because he discovered that the Pavilion Master’s internal qi had become even denser. With her cultivation now, Qin Yu could not see through her at all.

It was very different from what Qin Yu had anticipated. He looked at the Pavilion Master and frowned. “Didn’t you say that you couldn’t do two things at the same time? I have seen seventh-grade alchemists before. Their cultivation is not strong, but their alchemy techniques are extremely mature. However, you seem to…” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Pavilion Master poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu and then said indifferently, “Eighth grade and seventh grade is the turning point.”

“What do you mean?” Qin Yu asked in confusion.

The Pavilion Master smiled faintly. “The seventh grade is the peak of alchemy techniques, and there is no longer any possibility of further progress. Their alchemy techniques aren’t much inferior to the eighth or ninth-grade alchemist.”

Qin Yu remained silent and waited for the Pavilion Master to continue.

“Since ancient times, every great cultivator is a Great Success person. And a ninth-grade alchemist is a great cultivator at tribulation or even the Immortal Emperor realm. Do you know why?” the Pavilion Master asked.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and was not in a hurry to answer. He was as if carefully thinking about something.

“The Great Success… I seem to have recalled something,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The Pavilion Master poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu and signaled for him to continue.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I’ve been in the Holy Region for a long time now, and I’ve also come to understand the nature of cultivation. Everyone lives within the dao technique, and what they cultivate is merely the dao technique.”

“Just now, you said that the seventh grade and the eighth grade are the turning point, and the seventh grade is already the peak of alchemy. Then, the only possible difference between the seventh and eighth grade is the cultivation of the dao technique.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, a hint of approval flashed in the Pavilion Master’s eyes.

“That’s right. The strongest alchemists are the Immortal Emperors because they have already surpassed the dao techniques. And the essence of alchemy is not alchemy techniques. Similarly, it’s the dao technique.

“In other words, we use the power of the dao technique to change a person. Regardless of our physical body or mind, they are just a part of the dao technique. Therefore, if we are proficient in the dao technique of heaven and earth, everything can be solved easily,” the Pavilion Master said calmly.

Qin Yu instantly understood. Just as the Pavilion Master had said, cultivation and alchemy were of the same origin. If one comprehended the dao technique, one’s strength would naturally not be weak.

“But that’s not right.” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He scratched his head and said, “Based on what you said, wouldn’t any True Saint be an eighth-grade alchemist? Their comprehension of dao techniques is not inferior to anyone else, but I’ve seen a well-established True Saint asking for medicine from the Alchemist Association. This…”

“There are tens of thousands of dao techniques. They are all different,” the Pavilion Master just said this one sentence.

Qin Yu was a smart person. He immediately understood what the Pavilion Master meant.

The alchemists’ comprehension of dao techniques was to refine pills, while the True Saints’ comprehension of dao techniques was to cultivate and improve their cultivations.

Therefore, if they were in the same cultivation realm, the strength of the alchemists would probably not be comparable to the cultivators in the same cultivation realm.

Of course, the alchemists also had their advantages, that was their powerful mental strength.

And the true Great Success person would naturally gather thousands of dao techniques into one before they step into the supreme realm.

“In that case, I can consider changing my train of thought if I encounter a bottleneck. For example, I can come to the Alchemist Association to further my studies.” Qin Yu smiled.

The Pavilion Master nodded slightly in agreement.

“It’s a pity I’m plagued by evil things. I haven’t had the chance to enter the Alchemist Association for the time being,” Qin Yu sighed and said.
