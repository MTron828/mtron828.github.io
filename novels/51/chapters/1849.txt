1850 Advancing by Retreating

Dark iron was a top-notch material for blacksmithing, and Heavenly Palace Dark Iron was was one type of it.

Rumor had it that many Saint Weapons were made of Heavenly Palace Dark Iron, which was exceptionally precious.

The young man was then silent for a long time.

“What’s the matter?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

!!

The young man sighed. “This matter is very important, and I shouldn’t tell you. Therefore, I hope Brother Qin can make a promise.

“What promise?” Qin Yu asked.

“Don’t snatch my friend’s things,” said the young man.

Qin Yu seemed to have guessed something.

“Alright. I promise you,” he said after thinking for a moment.

Thus the young man slowly opened his mouth and said, “The Tong family controls Lizhou because they want to get the resources they have not exploited in Nanzhou.

“As one of the largest and oldest places in the Holy Region, Lizhou naturally contains a lot of resources. My friend accidentally excavated a dark iron mine.”

“Heavenly Palace Dark Iron mine?” Qin Yu asked.

The young man could not help but laugh and say, “It’s not realistic to excavate the Heavenly Palace Dark Iron mine. He only managed to excavate a batch of the Heavenly Palace Dark Iron.

“Due to this, my friend has established a relationship with the Tong family. He has close contact with family.”

Qin Yu understood now. He looked at the young man and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble you to introduce me to your friend.”

“Brother Qin, this matter should have been kept a secret,” the young man said in a deep voice. “I’ve also promised him to keep it a secret. Now…”

“Don’t worry. I won’t have any thoughts on his dark iron mine. I mean what I say,” Qin Yu said.

The young man heaved a sigh of relief. Then he smiled and said, “Then I hope Brother Qin will keep your promise. I’ll leave now to look for my friend.”

“I’ll have to trouble you then, my friend,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

The young man did not waste time and left Tianyun Sect immediately.

To be on the safe side, of course, he would not let Qin Yu touch the location of the dark iron mine. He could only bring his friend to Tianyun Sect.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He waited in Tianyun Sect.

Two days later.

The young man brought his friend and arrived at Tianyun Sect.

In the slightly run-down Great Hall of Tianyun Sect, Qin Yu poured a cup of tea for the two of them. He then said impatiently, “Please tell me everything you know without reservation. I will definitely remember this favor.”

The two of them looked at each other, and the mine owner said in a deep voice, ” Since you’ve already found me, I’ll tell you the truth.”

“The Tong family doesn’t have a True Saint at the moment,” he said.

Qin Yu’s eyes lit up, and he hurriedly said, “Is this true?”

“Yes,” the mine owner said as he sipped his tea.

“How did you know?” Qin Yu asked after a moment of thought.

“I’ve heard them talking about it once by chance,” the mine owner said in a deep voice. “It was the Tong family’s young master who said that.

“According to him, the last True Saint of the Tong family passed away 200 years ago.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu squinted his eyes.

As long as there was no True Saint keeping watch, Qin Yu would have a chance to take down the Tong family!

“The current Tong family is living on the foundation they once had. In other words, they’re just sitting around and eating. They only look impressive on the surface but are worthless,” the mine owner sighed. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Is that true?” Qin Yu asked, sizing him up.

“It’s nothing but the truth,” the mine owner said.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

Since that was the case, there was no need to fear the Tong family.

At this moment, the mine owner suddenly changed the topic and continued, “However, I don’t think it’s realistic for Brother Qin to overthrow the entire Tong family by yourself.”

Qin Yu remained silent, signaling him to continue.

The mine owner said, “The Tong family has indeed lost its former glory. However, a lean camel is still bigger than a horse. After all, they are an aristocratic family in Zhongzhou. They still have a certain amount of strength.

“All these years, to protect the Tong family, they’ve been very close to many sects and worshipped many guest elders.

“These guest elders are all at the very top of the Reversion Void Stage and are extremely powerful.”

“How many Reversion Void Stage cultivators do you think the Tong family can mobilize to help them?” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

“At least 50,” the mine owner said after some thought.

Qin Yu’s face turned solemn.

Even though Qin Yu was not afraid of any Reversion Void Stage cultivator, it was unrealistic for him to take on 50 Reversion Void Stage cultivators all by himself.

Moreover, although the Tong family had declined, they must have had a plan in place to protect themselves.

If he went there rashly, it would be no different from committing suicide.

“Many thanks,” Qin Yu stood up and said.

The mine owner smiled and said, “Brother Qin, you’re too polite. After all, I’m also a part of Nanzhou.”

After the mine owner left, Qin Yu sat alone in the hall, deep in thought.

This trip to the Tong family was bound to be a big move, and it was also the beginning of Qin Yu’s arrival in Zhongzhou. Therefore, no matter what, he could not make any mistakes.

In other words, this trip had to be successful, or it would mean Qin Yu’s failure to move into Zhongzhou.

After much consideration, Qin Yu finally decided to seek help from Demon-slaying Peak.

If Demon-slaying Peak was willing to help, it would be easy to deal with the Tong family.

Therefore, Qin Yu immediately got up and left Nanzhou, rushing to Demon-slaying Peak again.

However, what Qin Yu did not know was that the mine owner had gone straight to Zhongzhou after leaving Tianyun Sect.

…

In the Tong family, the mine owner stood in front of Uncle Guan as if he was reporting something.

“Uncle Guan, Qin Yu is indeed gathering information about the Tong family,” the mine owner said.

Uncle Guan squinted his eyes and sneered as if everything was under his control.

“How did you answer him?” Uncle Guan asked.

“I’ve done everything according to your instructions,” the mine owner quickly replied.

“Well done. After this matter is over, you won’t be lacking in benefits.” Uncle Guan slightly nodded.

When the mine owner heard this, he was overjoyed. He quickly bowed and said, ” “Many thanks, Uncle Guan.”

Speaking up to this point, the mine owner’s tone changed, and he said with some puzzlement, “Uncle Guan, there’s one thing I don’t understand. Why did you let him know that the Tong family has a large number of guest elders? Aren’t you afraid he won’t dare to come because of this?”

Uncle Guan glanced at him, smiled, and said, “He will definitely come. As long as Jue Wu is still in our hands, he will definitely come!

“If he knows that the Tong family is too strong, it will cause him to retreat and delay time.

“Although Thunder Courtyard won’t get involved in this, if he really brings a True Saint from Thunder Courtyard, everything will be doomed.

“But if you make the Tong family sound too weak, he’ll definitely doubt the truth of what you said.”

“I got it now. You’re advancing by retreating. Uncle Guan is still the wisest!” the mine owner said with sudden realization.

Uncle Guan sneered. He looked at the sky and said in a low voice, “He’s just a little rascal who doesn’t know his own place.”
