“If it wasn’t for the sake of resisting the northern lands, if it wasn’t for the sake of the southern region, just the few of you, Hehe...”the deputy sect leader laughed bitterly.

Qin Yu’s expression became a little ugly.

He hadn’t expected this deputy sect leader to actually be a righteous person!

“Is what you said true?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

The deputy sect master was too lazy to explain. He closed his eyes and did not want to say a word.

Qin Yu’s expression became even uglier. He looked around and coincidentally, Di Zun was walking over.

“What the deputy sect master said is true,”Di Zun said as he walked.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly walked over to Di zun and said, “He... he really withdrew the strength of the heavenly cloud sect for the sake of the northern lands?”

Di Zun Sighed, he slowly said, “Back then, when the northern lands launched a large-scale attack on the southern region, who knows how many people were harmed. The deputy sect leader resisted the public opinion and insisted on sending people to the various large cities to protect one side. That was why Yongji had an opportunity.”

“Moreover... in order for this proposal to pass, the deputy sect leader did not hesitate to imprison the first elder who opposed it. Master, I feel that the deputy sect leader did not have any problems.”

At this moment, Qin Yu felt that his worldview had collapsed.

He staggered back a few steps, his face extremely pale!

“How could this be...”Qin Yu clenched his teeth.

......

He walked quickly to the deputy sect master and helped him up.

“You... Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”Qin Yu said through clenched teeth.

The deputy sect master was completely unwilling to pay attention to Qin Yu and did not say a word.

“Not everyone in the Heavenly Cloud sect is like the first Elder.”Di Zun took a deep breath and said.

Qin Yu was silent.

He didn’t expect that there would be such a righteous person in the Heavenly Cloud sect.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt someone walking towards him from behind.

He hurriedly turned around and saw that the person was actually the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!

“You...”Qin Yu’s expression was horrified and he subconsciously took a step back.

“Don’t worry. This is just my divine sense,”the sect master said indifferently.

Qin Yu slightly heaved a sigh of relief. He frowned and said, “You know everything that happened in the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

“Why not?”The sect master said indifferently.

“Then why didn’t you make a move?”Qin Yu became more and more confused.

The sect master smiled and said, “I have my difficulties.”

“Difficulties? Isn’t the Heavenly Cloud sect more important to you than anything else?”Qin Yu said with a cold face.

The sect master said indifferently, “The heavenly cloud sect is indeed important, but there are things in this world that are more important than the heavenly cloud sect.”

At this moment, Qin Yu felt a little dumbfounded.

Why did the Heavenly Cloud sect seem to have changed in the Blink of an eye?

Could it be that he had misunderstood the Heavenly Cloud sect previously?

“Let’s have a chat in the room. What do you think?”The sect master waved his hand and pointed.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, feeling even more puzzled.

The Flames of war were raging outside. As the sect master of the Tianyun sect, Qin Yu found it hard to understand how he could have such leisure.

After thinking for a moment, he nodded and said, “Okay.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Therefore, Qin Yu followed behind the sect master of the Tianyun sect and came to a room and sat down quietly.

The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “How about you and the Heavenly Cloud sect call a truce?”

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted together. All his determination had collapsed at this moment.

“The Heavenly Cloud sect killed my friend and chased after me for so long, yet you want me to call a truce? I don’t agree,”Qin Yu said coldly.

He seemed to have expected Qin Yu’s answer, so he was not surprised. He just smiled and said, “Then let’s call a truce for the time being. At least for now, we should be united against the outside world.”

“United against the outside world?”Qin Yu could not help but laugh.

To Qin Yu, he did not have deep feelings for the southern region. How could he be united against the outside world?

If it were not for the people of the northern lands being too cruel, Qin Yu would not even want to be enemies with them.

“You say it nicely. Then why did you hide in the Cultivation Mountain and never go out?”Qin Yu sneered.

The sect master laughed faintly. He glanced outside and said, “The heavenly cloud sect has fallen into such a state. Did you see me make a move?”

“So I don’t understand. I killed your son. You could endure it for the sake of the heavenly cloud sect. Why didn’t you make a move now?”Qin Yu said with a frown.

He didn’t seem to want to answer this question. Perhaps he had some unspeakable reason. He just sighed slightly.

“Do you really want to get involved with people like Yong Ji? Just as the vice sect master said, the Heavenly Cloud sect is resisting the northern lands, but you guys are the accomplices of the northern lands.”The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect sighed.

“I think you don’t want to bear such a bad name.”

Qin Yu was silent.

He had always looked down on Yong Ji, but he had also been waiting for this opportunity.

But after hearing the words of the vice sect master and the sect master, Qin Yu was somewhat at a loss.

“Do you really think that Yong Ji is willing to join hands with you? He is just using you.”The sect master sighed.

“How could I not be using him as well?”Qin Yu shook his head.

The sect master smiled, he said, “There are some things that we may not be able to determine right or wrong. Everything should be left to the future generations to make the judgment. If you insist on doing things your own way, I have nothing to say. It’s just that I believe that you will regret making today’s decision.”

Qin Yu’s face was gloomy and uncertain. At this moment, Qin Yu was indeed somewhat wavering.

Compared to Yongji, the Heavenly Cloud sect was much more honest.

More importantly, the heavenly cloud sect would rather put themselves in danger than resist the northern lands. They would even protect the people in the various large cities.

This kind of situation was definitely not something that a person like Yongji could do.

“Alright, that’s all I have to say.”At this moment, the sect master suddenly stood up.

“I don’t have much time. Leave the rest to you to make your own decision.”

After saying this, his figure began to blur.

Qin Yu fell into silence.

Only when his figure completely disappeared did Qin Yu sigh slightly.

He slowly stood up and walked out of the room, all the way to the side of the deputy sect master.

“Where is the first elder?”Qin Yu bent down and asked.

The deputy sect master said with a cheeky face, “How would I know!”

Qin Yu was silent. His bottom line was to kill the first elder.

No matter who came to plead for mercy, the first elder had to die.

At this time, the Heavenly Cloud sect retreated again and again. In the blink of an eye, they arrived in front of Qin Yu and the others.

Yong Ji and Huai Chang led everyone and stood in the high sky, looking down at everyone coldly.

“Qin Yu, kill these people quickly!”Yong ji shouted from above.

Qin Yu remained silent, standing beside the deputy sect master without saying a word.

Huai Chang, who was beside Yong Ji, said indifferently, “Perhaps he doesn’t want to bear the blame. Let me do this...”

After saying that, Huai Chang’s figure suddenly shot towards the deputy sect master!

He held the black light in his hand and headed straight for the deputy sect master’s glabella!

At this moment, the deputy sect master seemed to have lost the ability to fight. This attack would definitely kill him!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Huai Chang’s wrist.
