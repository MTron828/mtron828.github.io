Chapter 2701: The Second Loss of Holy Energy

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Are you sure?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He had been feeling that some kind of change had occurred in his body.

However, he still could not see anything even though he used the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

“This thing seems to be a dark specter. I can’t tell for the time being, but there’s a strong dark specter on your back at this moment. I can’t be wrong about this. My perception can’t be wrong. You should feel that your body has changed, right?”

Holy Light Divine Flame!

A wisp of flame emerged from Qin Yu’s head. A terrifying flame appeared on the surface of Qin Yu’s body instantly.

“It’s useless. It’s still here.”

Xi Ming stared at Qin Yu.

He pinched his fingers as if he was calculating something. A thin level of sweat appeared on the tip of his nose.

Qin Yu’s scalp was also a little numb. From the exchange just now, he could tell that Xi Ming was not easy to deal with.

To be able to make him reveal such an expression, the thing on his body seemed to be difficult to deal with.

“Oh no! Someone has set up a Heaven Secrets Deception Array here! This person’s strength is far from what we can deal with. Leave quickly!”

Xi Ming’s body suddenly let out a dull sound as if he had been hit by something heavy.

He spat out a mouthful of blood and his expression was extremely ugly.

Suddenly, a deafening voice exploded in Qin Yu’s ears.

Then, a glass-shattering sound appeared in his sea of consciousness. Qin Yu was very familiar with this sound.

A hazy internal qi slowly spread out from the ground.

In an instant, the entire space seemed to be shrouded in fog. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The mist disappeared in an instant. It passed through the mine cave and dissipated in front of Qin Yu and Xi Ming.

At this moment, the power of thunder continued to shuttle through the sky.

The endless mist in the air blocked the entire Endless Mine.

“Who stole my holy energy right?”

Suddenly, an elderly man near the Endless Mine let out a furious roar. At this moment, his body emitted a ferocious internal qi.

The surrounding space was affected by his violent energy. Through the space around him, one could only see the elderly man’s figure distorted.

This person was the elderly man from the Path of Heaven Academy who was stationed here, Lord Tang.

“Lord Tang, bad news! All the entrances to the Endless Mine were blocked!

There hasn’t been any news from the contact point inside for half a day.

Perhaps the people inside…”

Lord Tang crushed the cup in his hand. His expression was as cold as ice.

“Let’s go. I want to see who dares to play tricks in the Endless Mine!” Lord Tang stood up.

“Contact the Guardian of Order and all the higher-ups of the Upper Dome.

Gather at the mine.”

Lord Tang’s expression was hideous. When he arrived at the Endless Mine, the other forces had arrived.

The Guardian of Order sent Yi Yun, and the Upper Dome sent a woman named Hong Luan.

The two nodded slightly when they saw Lord Tang.

Lord Tang is the strongest person stationed in the Endless Mine.

Three major forces jointly sent people to guard here. As for those who mined,

Even the scary Zui Rao didn’t even have the right to raise her head in front of Lord Tang.

“Did you find anything?”

Lord Tang asked.

“Ever since the Saint Power was stolen, all the entrances here have become impassable. It seems like someone has set up a large formation here. Everyone who entered has lost contact, including those at the contact points below.” Hong Luan’s expression turned ugly.

“The power of the Saint Kingdom has been withdrawn, the order of the Endless Mine has collapsed, and there’s also the Heaven Secrets Deception Array before this. All of these should be connected. It shouldn’t be so coincidental that they would appear together.” Yi Yun frowned.

“D*mn outsiders!”

Hong Luan said fiercely. Only an outsider could steal the Saint Power using the Heart of Saint Kingdom.

“What a terrifying murderous dark aura below this mine! I’ve never seen the formation energy coming from the entrance before! Three of us will work together to break through the formation and destroy it with our full strength. Then, we will enter and find out the truth.”

Lord Tang’s expression was cold.

The Endless Mine was a major matter that involved the sect. There must not be any problem here.

Divine Thunder Attraction!

Lord Tang chanted an incantation and waved the Dao sword in his hand.

A terrifying power of thunder poured down directly and bombarded the hole.

Hong Luan Fire!

Hong Luan spat out a flame from her mouth. The surrounding temperature rose by dozens of degrees as the flame appeared.

Yi Yun held a crystal clear Four Seas Bottle in his hand as he formed a hand seal.

An endless sea appeared.

“Boundless Ocean!”

Boom!

The power of the ocean condensed into a stream of energy that directly bombarded the cave entrance.

Three attacks landed at the entrance of the cave.

However, there was not even the slightest fluctuation. It was as if the attacks had never happened.

“What?”

Lord Tang and the other two were shocked.

After all, Hong Luan and Yi Yun were both at the Dao realm level 8. Whereas he had reached the Dao realm level 9.

With the three of them working together, an array would probably not be able to withstand it no matter how strong it was.

“It seems that we can’t break it with force. This array formation does not even have any fluctuations. One can imagine that its limit is not something that we can break through together.”

Hong Luan said with a bitter smile.

“Have you tried other entrances?”

Lord Tang pondered for a long time and suddenly asked the two.

“Yes. We’ve tried a total of five mine caves and found that they all contain the same energy. We can confirm that all the caves have the same situation with the other disciples entering one after another.”

Yi Yun said.

“Give the order. Everyone in the Endless Mine should carefully search for the formation. It’s impossible for such a huge formation to not have any clues. Remember to check if there are any abnormalities recently first. You must check thoroughly even if you have to dig three feet into the ground.” Lord Tang said coldly.

At that moment, everyone got busy. The news came in less than half a day.

“Lords, we have discovered a strange place!”

A cultivator ran over with a pale face.

“Lead the way!”

Hong Luan’s face lit up. If she could find the formation, she would be able to destroy it. At that time, the thing hidden under the mine would be unable to escape!

When they arrived at a location, it had already been excavated.

“The people guarding this area all fell sick today. Three Dao realm level 3 people even lost their lives. After three Lords gave the order, we dug up the ground and found this strange thing.”

The cultivator who led the way quickly reported the situation to the three of them.

At this moment, a strange thing was floating about 30 meters away from the ground..
