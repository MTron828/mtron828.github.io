Chapter 2654: Exchange

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This method was akin to training with a heavy burden, subtly strengthening his divine soul’s resistance to this consciousness.

As Qin Yu’s mind was immersed in studying this consciousness, he suddenly withdrew his divine sense. A person at the door hesitated for a long time before finally lightly knocking on the door.

“Qin Yu, I want to exchange for your bow, ” Aiden said, who pushed open the door and walked in. This time, he was fortunate enough not to be affected.

However, he had been slightly injured by Gu Yi’s punch.

The fairy Aiden seemed to have made up his mind.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and was about to speak.

However, Aiden stopped him. A familiar phantom slowly appeared on his hand. However, the moment the mark appeared, Aiden clenched his fist again and blocked the internal qi, as if he were afraid that the internal qi would leak out. “Heart of Saint Kingdom! You obtained the Heart of Saint Kingdom?”

Qin Yu could not believe it. This was the first time he had seen another Heart of Saint Kingdom other than his Seal of Heaven Returning.

And it was given to Aiden. No matter when they first met.

Even now, Qin Yu still felt that Aiden’s strength was very ordinary, but he didn’t expect him to obtain the most precious thing in this world.

“The Fairy Queen Galadriel’s Saint Kingdom had once fallen into the hands of a Saint-Level expert. After defeating many outsiders, she obtained the position of a Saint Kingdom. Therefore, she has some special experience in finding the Heart of a Saint Kingdom. Would you accept it in exchange for your Sun Chasing Bow?”

Aiden asked solemnly. He had hesitated for a long time before making this decision.

“The Heart of the Saint Kingdom is much more precious than the Sun Chasing Bow.”

Qin Yu asked in confusion.

“I want to know who will get the Sun Chasing Bow. This bow was forged by a

descendant of a senior magus. Rumor has it that its true power can shoot stars in the sky. My grandfather once got this bow and created a set of related cultivation techniques with it. If I can get my hands on it, it will greatly improve my strength. At least, it will be much more useful than this Heart of Saint Kingdom.”

Aiden raised his eyebrows and told him everything about the bow.

from being able to use the Heart of Saint Kingdom to mobilize the power of Saint Kingdom. It’s better to convert it into something that exists now and not bring this thing to Satan.”

Aiden said with a bitter smile.

The battle just now had given him too great a shock.

If it weren’t for his good fortune, avoiding being affected, even with the Heart of Saint Kingdom, it would have been of no use.

“Moreover, the oath I made before you spared my life is still valid. I will support all your actions in the Demon Sealing Valley. However, if you can pass this test, you must not stop me from continuing,” Aiden spoke again. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Alright,” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

His divine soul had transformed the Order of Destruction, and he could already tap into a portion of the Saint Power.

If he could add another Heart of Saint Kingdom, the amount of Saint Power he could tap into would double.

Moreover, the power of Saint Kingdom had a strong suppressive effect on the natives. Now was the perfect time for the Heart of Saint Kingdom to arrive.

In the Demon Sealing Valley, the power of the Saint Kingdom served as a form of intimidation to all the disciples. Compared to the Sun Chasing Bow, the Heart of Saint Kingdom was more useful to him.

Since both of them agreed, everything else fell into place logically.

Qin Yu exchanged the Sun Chasing Bow for the Heart of Saint Kingdom on Aiden’s body, and the mark was placed on Qin Yu’s palm.

It slowly fused into his palm and turned into a stream of energy that flowed through his meridians.

In the end, they stopped next to the Seal of Heaven Returning. The two bright Heart of Saint Kingdoms flickered with a dazzling light in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Waves of energy radiated from the Heart of Saint Kingdom, slowly merging into his divine soul, gradually transforming its origin.

From Qin Yu’s comprehension of the rules to the next step from the peak of Human Consciousness, this feeling became more and more apparent.

Although it didn’t have the obvious effect of the power of rules directly transforming the soul, this power was very stable. It constantly transformed the origin of Qin Yu’s divine soul, making it stronger and able to accommodate more holy energy.

“I’ll go and study this bow first. Farewell. This Heart of Saint Kingdom has a peculiar name, the Order Vessel of the Saint Kingdom. It seems to randomly capture some kind of power of rules and then seal them in the vessel. I don’t think it’s very useful. In any case, it won’t significantly enhance my strength.”

Aiden held the Sun Chasing Bow, which had been erased from Qin Yu’s divine soul mark, and an impatient expression appeared on his face.

“Wait! Clarify first!”

Qin Yu was anxious. How could he understand what this thing was thinking?

“I don’t understand the specifics. For example, there is a movement technique power stored in this vessel. Once you use it, you can utilize this movement technique power for a short period. This power was captured by Zi Xia during her battle.”

Aiden said with a frown.

Therefore, he did not dare to use the power within wantonly, afraid that others would notice it. Therefore, he was not particularly clear about the exploration of the Heart of the Saint Kingdom.

“What about before this movement technique? Did you capture any other powers?”

Qin Yu asked a crucial question. He did not have much time to explore the power of the Heart of the Saint Kingdom, so the information Aiden provided was crucial.

“I’ve also captured a few skills before, but I didn’t use them. Then, during the war in the Ancient Demon Land, I captured Zi Xia’s movement technique again.

Therefore, I guess that the capture of this vessel is random. Moreover, the power of the Heart of the Saint Kingdom is not under my control, so I can’t control it to capture the ability I want.”

Aiden shrugged. He had tried to replicate this heaven-defying power before, but he couldn’t activate it.

“Alright, I have a rough idea. You can go now.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. The Order of Rules in the Heart of the Saint Kingdom that Aiden had obtained seemed a little useless.

It was uncontrollable. Moreover, Qin Yu judged that this type of Order of Rules was not something that could be controlled.

The stronger the power, the harder it should be to capture.

Otherwise, why could he only capture a single movement technique? In the final battle, both Elder Xin Yue and Elder Gu Yi used extremely powerful strength, but they could not capture a single force.

Therefore, the stronger the power of the natural order, the harder it was to capture the vessel.

Qin Yu could probably guess this result. After all, he had never seen Aiden use the power of the Heart of Saint Kingdom along the way. There was a high chance that it was a Saint Kingdom ranked at the bottom. He put his mind into the Heart of Saint Kingdom..
