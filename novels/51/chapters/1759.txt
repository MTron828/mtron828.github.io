1760 You’ll Never Understand

Soon, Qin Yu was already in front of Xiao Hai.

At this moment, Qin Yu was undoubtedly crazy, but he was extremely calm.

He grabbed Xiao Hai’s body and exerted all his remaining energy to pull him out.

However, the force was so strong that Qin Yu could not stop it at all!

Yuan Xiu could not help but sneer at the sight.

“Qin Yu, you’re also a guy who surprises me.” Yuan Xiu said indifferently.

“It’s already very impressive that you can get close to him, but it’s impossible to take him away!”

Qin Yu was not in the mood to listen to his nonsense. He gritted his teeth and clutched Xiao Hai’s body tightly, trying to stop all of this.

“Ah! You’re courting death!” Qin Yu roared in anger. He grabbed Xiao Hai tightly, and the veins on his body bulged. He had obviously used all his strength!

“Qin Yu, it’s useless. Let go.” At this moment, Xiao Hai spoke.

He looked at Qin Yu and said calmly, “I’ve already done everything I should. I’ll leave the rest to you.

“No, I will never give up!” Qin Yu shouted angrily. He clenched Xiao Hai’s hand tightly and gritted his teeth. Sweat was dripping down his face.

“Qin Yu, if you don’t let go, you will die here with me.” Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

“Let go. Everyone is bound to die. I just need to do what I should do.”

“I won’t let go!” Qin Yu roared. “Senior Xiao Hai, I won’t let you sacrifice yourself a second time even if I die!”

“Let go! Qin Yu!” Xiao Hai roared. He wanted to force Qin Yu back with his remaining breath.

But Qin Yu’s grip was too tight. His stubborn and tough expression moved everyone.

Xiao Hai’s body was still immersed in the scene. Qin Yu’s efforts seemed to have no effect.

Seeing that Xiao Hai’s body had already reached his waist, everyone was in despair.

“Qin Yu, let go!” Xiao Hai roared.

“I won’t!” Qin Yu raised his head and roared. He suddenly raised his palm, and a golden light instantly surged into his palm!

The golden light around his body disappeared and gathered in his palm.

Without the protection of the light, Qin Yu’s body couldn’t take it anymore.

His skin was cracking inch by inch, and his body was being shattered at an extremely fast speed!

“Qin Yu!” Everyone immediately became anxious, and Jue Wu tried her best to rush forward to help.

“Let go of me!” Xiao Hai shouted angrily. “You’re still young and have a bright future ahead of you. It’s not worth it to die here!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “No... You said that everyone’s life should be treated equally, and there’s no such thing as being worth it or not. I... I am the same as anyone else!”

With a roar, Qin Yu used all his strength and slashed at Xiao Hai’s waist with his palm!

“Slash!”

This palm was like a sharp blade, instantly splitting Xiao Hai’s body into two!

Xiao Hai’s body fell down.

And his lower body had entered the scene!

“He... He did it!” Seeing this, Wen Wanchong and the others were both surprised and happy!

Qin Yu had actually cut Xiao Hai’s body in half at this critical moment, saving his upper body!

However, the next second, everyone’s hearts were at their throats again.

Without the protection of the golden light, Qin Yu’s body was on the verge of shattering. Even his head began to crack, revealing pieces of his bones!

The blood was so thick that Qin Yu’s face was barely visible.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and endured the pain. He grabbed Xiao Hai’s upper body and ran away.

By the time he arrived in front of Jue Wu and the others, his aura had already withered to the extreme.

“Take... Take good care of Senior Xiao Hai...”

After saying this, Qin Yu fell into a coma.

“Qin Yu!”

Jue Wu hurriedly raised her palm and transferred her internal qi to Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu was so badly injured that his body was almost crushed, and even a part of his bone was broken.

Even Jue Wu couldn’t provide him with any internal qi.

A hint of respect appeared on Xiao Hai’s face as he looked at Qin Yu, who was covered in blood.

“Qin Yu, thank you.” Xiao Hai took a deep breath, then reached out and pulled Qin Yu into his arms.

Qin Yu’s stubbornness and tenacity touched everyone’s hearts and filled them with respect.

“Take Qin Yu and leave.” The calm Qu Zhu looked at Wen Wanchong.

“Take Qin Yu and Senior Xiao Hai and leave this place.” Qu Zhu continued.

Wen Wanchong nodded. He picked up Qin Yu and Xiao Hai and was about to leave.

However, how could Yuan Xiu let them escape? With a wave of his hand, he froze the space in front of them, blocking their way.

“To be honest, I really don’t understand people like you.” Yuan Xiu said.

“It doesn’t matter if it’s you or Qin Yu. Why are you two willing to risk your lives? And how did you guys burst out that kind of... Strange and unfathomable power?”

Yuan Xiu kept sighing in puzzlement. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xiao Hai looked at Yuan Xiu coldly and said, “As I said, people like you will never understand.”

“Not necessarily.” At this moment, Yuan Xiu changed the topic.

He laughed coldly. “I still have a long time to slowly think about this problem. But you are different. You are going to die here.”

After saying that, Yuan Xiu raised his palm.

At this moment, these few people no longer had any fighting strength left. Yuan Xiu could easily kill them.

“Goodbye, you strange people.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

After he finished speaking, Yuan Xiu lightly pushed his palm forward and a terrifying radiance shot towards them!

Jue Wu hurriedly got up. Her small body burst out with a brilliant light and went straight to meet him.

“Boom!”

The moment they touched, the light on Jue Wu’s body was shattered.

Her small body rolled on the ground and blood flowed out.

“Hahaha, hitting a rock with an egg.” Yuan Xiu sneered.

Jue Wu stood up from the ground once again. She endured the pain in her body and once again rushed towards Yuan Xiu!

Yuan Xiu raised his palm and slapped at them!

A terrifying power erupted once again. Compared to the palm strike just now, the power of this palm strike was even more terrifying!

“Lord Jue Wu!” Wen Wanchong’s old face was filled with anger. He wanted to save her, but his body did not allow him to.

Just as the palm was about to hit Jue Wu, it suddenly stopped.

The fearsome power that Yuan Xiu had unleashed froze in mid-air, as if it had been frozen in place.

“What?” Yuan Xiu furrowed his brows, feeling that something was amiss.

Before he could come back to his senses, the aura actually began to burst in the opposite direction!

“What’s going on?” Yuan Xiu hurriedly turned around and looked into the distance.
