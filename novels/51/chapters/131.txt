Chapter 132: Wu Hongchang’s Goodwill Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Upon hearing Wu Hongchang’s words, Liu Yi couldn’t help but show surprise on his face.

In South City, Wu Hongchang was considered quite famous.

Plus, barely anyone knew that he had been beaten by Qin Yu.

“Mr. Wu, are you serious? Qin Yu isn’t easy to deal with.” Liu Shihui hurriedly asked before Liu Yi could speak.

Wu Hongchang snorted and said, “In my opinion, Qin Yu isn’t worth mentioning at all!”

“That’s right, that’s right. Mr. Wu, you’ve been famous for many years, so it’s a piece of cake for you to deal with Qin Yu.” Liu Yi said with a smile.

Wu Hongchang said with a nonchalant smile, “If Mr. Liu trusts me, give me two days. I’ll bring Qin Yu’s head to you!”

“Are you serious?” Liu Yi’s expression was joyful as he hurriedly asked.

Wu Hongchang nodded and said, “I’ll do as I say! But after the matter is done, I want 10% of the Liu family’s shares. Is that alright?”

“No problem!” Liu Yi hurriedly nodded and said.

“Alright, then we’ll meet the day after tomorrow.” Wu Hongchang stood up and walked out cockily.

After Wu Hongchang left, Liu Shihui couldn’t help but sneer and said, “With Mr. Wu’s help, Qin Yu will definitely be dead meat!”

“That’s right. In all these years, Wu Shichang has never been defeated by anyone besides Tao Shan. Dealing with Qin Yu is a piece of cake.” Liu Yi sneered.

Yao Qing drove for a long time and finally sent Sun Ying home.

Sun Ying’s family lived in a high-end residential area in South City. Although this wasn’t a single-family villa, each home was extremely large. Even the smallest home was at least 300 square meters.

“This is Sun Ying’s home,” Chen Xin pointed and said.

Qin Yu nodded. After the car was parked, Qin Yu carried Sun Ying into the residential area.

They arrived at the door of Sun Ying’s home. Qin Yu stretched out his hand and knocked on the door. Not long after, Sun Ying’s father, Sun Fu, opened the door and walked out.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, Sun Fu’s expression immediately changed.

When he saw Sun Ying in Qin Yu’s arms, his entire face flushed quickly!

“Qin Yu, how dare you touch my daughter?! I won’t forgive you!” Sun Fu said aggressively and pounced towards Qin Yu.

But before he could touch Qin Yu, he was kicked to the ground by Yao Qing.

“Are you out of your mind?” Yao Qing couldn’t help but say with a cold expression.

Sun Fu got up from the ground, pointed at Qin Yu and scolded, “You good-for-nothing dared to touch my daughter! You beast!”

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “Sun Ying drank too much. I just sent her home.”

“You forced my daughter to drink? She is only a teenager, yet you let her drink so much. What are your intentions?” Sun Fu was still unwilling to let it go.

Chen Xin quickly explained, “Sir, it has nothing to do with Qin Yu. If it weren’t for Qin Yu, Sun Ying would have been in danger tonight. You should thank him.”

“Bah! You guys are in cahoots and lying to me.” Sun Fu snorted coldly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh inside.

As expected of Sun Yumei’s younger brother, Sun Fu acted just the same.

“Believe it or not, it has nothing to do with me.” Qin Yu put Sun Ying on the ground, then turned around and left.

Sun Fu scolded from behind, “Just you wait. If anything happens to my daughter, I won’t spare you, you piece of trash!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and turned around to leave.

After going downstairs, Chen Xin couldn’t help but say, “Why is Sun Ying’s father like this? He’s so unreasonable.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Their whole family is the same,” Qin Yu snickered.

Chen Xin stuck out her tongue and didn’t say anything.

After that, Qin Yu sent Chen Xin to school and then returned to the hotel.

The next day, after Qin Yu woke up, he went to the balcony.

As he sat on the balcony, he couldn’t help but think about the Chinese Medicine Conference.

“There’s less than a week left until the Chinese Medicine Conference. It’s time to prepare,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

According to Mr. Yang, as long as he got first place in the Chinese Medicine Conference, he would be able to obtain a hundred-year-old herb stalk.

This was a rare opportunity for Qin Yu.

He sat cross-legged on the balcony and whispered, “According to the records of the inheritance, producing spiritual fire is possible at the Foundation Establishment Stage, and spiritual fire is extremely useful for refining medicine.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu closed his eyes.

He gathered all the spiritual power in his body in his palm and tried to conjure the spiritual fire according to the method recorded in his memory.

Soon, Qin Yu’s palm felt a trace of heat flow.

This heat flow became more and more intense in Qin Yu’s palm, and the burning sensation was somewhat unbearable for Qin Yu.

“Phew!”

At this moment, a flame ignited in Qin Yu’s palm out of thin air!

Qin Yu hurriedly opened his eyes and saw that the flame, a little dim under the sunlight, was light blue in color.

“So conjuring spiritual flames is that simple.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter.

If others heard this, they would definitely be extremely angered.

There was no telling how many top alchemist masters had been unable to succeed despite studying it for a lifetime.

After that, Qin Yu flicked his finger, and this wisp of spiritual flame floated out from Qin Yu’s palm.

The flame fell onto the ground and flickered for a long time.

It was only a small spark, but it actually burned for more than half an hour.

When the flame disappeared, a black hole actually appeared on the ground.

“Spiritual fire really lives up to its reputation. If it can be used to refine medicine, it will be twice the result with half the effort,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although that was the case, controlling it was very difficult.

If it wasn’t properly controlled, the wild flames might burn the herbs into ashes.

Qin Yu stood up from the balcony. At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

As soon as the door opened, he found Wu Hongchang standing at the door.

“What are you doing here?” Qin Yu didn’t have a good impression of Wu Hongchang at all. A trace of disgust flashed across his face.

Wu Hongchang hurriedly bowed and said, “Mr. Qin, I’m here to apologize to you.”

“Apologize?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

“Yes. I didn’t know how powerful you were before, so I hope you won’t blame me for being rude to you,” Wu Hongchang said respectfully.

Yao Qing couldn’t help but sneer. “Wu Hongchang, you were chased away by the Lu family, so you’re anxious, aren’t you?”

Wu Hongchang glanced at Yao Qing and said with a smile, “My young friend, you’re wrong. With my abilities, any aristocratic family would scramble to recruit me.”

It was true. Although Wu Hongchang liked to brag, he was still an Inner Strength Master Hands. Even without the Lu family, he could fend for himself.

“Mr. Qin, in order to express the sincerity of my apology, I specially prepared a gift for you,” Wu Hongchang continued.

Then, Wu Hongchang took out a pill that was emitting a green light from his pocket.

This pill looked crystal clear, and it was enveloped in a faint medicinal aroma.

“This is a medicinal herb that I have treasured for many years. I hope that I can get Mr. Qin’s forgiveness,” Wu Hongchang said politely.

As the saying went, one shouldn’t slap someone with friendly intentions.

Since Wu Hongchang’s attitude was so humble, Qin Yu couldn’t treat him coldly.

“There’s no need for that. Come in and have a seat,” Qin Yu said.

Seeing this, a crafty look flashed across Wu Hongchang’s face.

“Okay. Thank you, Mr. Qin.” Wu Hongchang bowed and then strode in.
