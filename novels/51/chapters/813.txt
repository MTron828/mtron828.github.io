Chapter 814: Chapter 814, martial saint in the second secret realm Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, Qin Yu’s battle intent had almost reached its peak.

This pure internal Qi swept across the entire street.

Yan Jinyao’s brows were tightly knitted together. He sneered and said, “Qin Yu, don’t think that I don’t know anything.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You relied on the power of a martial saint to come and challenge me? Do you think that I will fall for it?”

Qin Yu sneered, “Do I need the power of a martial saint to kill you?”

“Great! The power of a martial saint will disappear one day. At that time, you will die!”Yan Jinyao also shouted.

“It’s a deal.”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Yan Sihai, don’t think about Yan Ruoxue anymore. Cherish the last time you have with your son.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

“Qin Yu, are you really not going to hand him over? !”Yan Sihai could not help but shout.

“F * ck you, get lost!”Qin Yu scolded without even turning his head.

Yan Sihai gritted his teeth. Although he was furious, he could not do anything to Qin Yu.

The current Qin Yu’s strength had reached a point where even the Yan family could not do anything to him.

Without a martial saint, no one could restrict Qin Yu!

Helpless, the few of them could only leave.

After returning to Jingdu, Granny Qin had been waiting here for a long time.

When she saw Yan Sihai returning, she hurriedly went up to him and said, “Mr. Yan, did you bring him back?”

Yan Sihai could not help but curse, “Bring my ass! Qin Yu won’t let him go at all! I still want to ask your Jingdu Martial Arts Association for him!”

Hearing these words, Granny Qin immediately sat down on the ground, her face filled with despair.

If they could not bring him back, it meant that little black was going to die!

To Granny Qin, who had no children, this was simply unacceptable!

“Granny Qin, Why Don’t you send out a martial saint to kill that Qin Yu?”Yan Jinyao said with some doubt.

“The Jingdu martial arts association should have a martial saint, right? and... There seems to be a martial saint in that prison, right?”

Granny Qin glanced at Yan Jinyao and shook her head. She said, “If we could dispatch a martial saint, we wouldn’t have let Qin Yu live for so long...”

After she had said this, Granny Qin left this place in a daze.

...

At this moment, in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Qin Yu stood below the pavilion master and continued to wait.

For an entire day and night.

It was late at night when the pavilion master finally walked down from upstairs.

Upon seeing the Pavilion Master, Qin Yu hurriedly ran over.

“Pavilion Master, how is Ruoxue?”Qin Yu anxiously asked.

The pavilion master shook his head and sighed. “The Jingdu martial arts association seems to have long prepared for the possibility of her being rescued.”

“What do you mean? !”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The pavilion master said in a deep voice, “The JINGDU martial arts association has used a secret technique on Yan Ruoxue’s spiritual sense. Only the people of the JINGDU martial arts association can solve this secret technique.”

“This secret technique will flare up once it leaves the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed drastically.

He muttered in a low voice, “How can this be... if the secret technique is not solved, what will happen?”

The pavilion master said in a deep voice, “If this secret technique is not solved, Yan Ruoxue will never be able to regain her consciousness. To put it bluntly, she will become a living dead.”

“Living Dead...”Qin Yu’s heart suddenly felt as if thousands of arrows had pierced through his heart. A wave of anger shot straight to the top of his head!

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association...”Qin Yu clenched his fist tightly. His fingernails were almost embedded into his flesh!

The pavilion master at the side comforted him, “Qin Yu, don’t be anxious. At least this technique won’t harm your life. In other words, your little girlfriend is at least safe.”

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at the pavilion master and said, “Pavilion Master, what is the name of this secret technique?”

“Spirit binding technique.”The pavilion master hesitated for a moment and then replied.

“Spirit binding technique...”Qin Yu whispered the name. Then, he quickly looked for the three words spirit binding technique in his inherited memories.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu couldn’t find this technique at all.

“The soul binding technique was created by the people of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Other than them, no one else can unravel this technique.”The pavilion master seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s intentions.

Qin Yu’s face immediately had a hint of despair.

If that was the case, then wouldn’t it mean that only the people of the JINGDU martial arts association could unravel it?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu stood up and said, “I’ll go to the Jingdu martial arts association right now and find Granny Qin!”

However, the pavilion master stopped him and said, “It’s already late at night. Let’s talk about it next year.”

“Moreover, since you took her away, Granny Qin might be in the secret realm.”

Qin Yu frowned, as if he felt that what the pavilion master said made sense.

“Follow me upstairs first,”said the pavilion master.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude, then followed the Pavilion Master and jumped upstairs.

Upstairs, Yan Ruoxue was lying in a medicinal pool.

Her entire body was soaked in medicinal liquid. Drops of medicinal liquid slid down her snow-white skin.

Seeing this, Qin Yu’s heart couldn’t help but feel like it was being cut by a knife.

He walked forward and knelt in front of Yan Ruoxue on one knee.

“Ruoxue, wait for me. I’ll definitely wake you up as soon as possible. Wait for me...”Qin Yu grabbed Yan Ruoxue’s hand and said with a pained expression.

The pavilion master at the side comforted her, “You have already rescued her from the secret realm. There’s no need to blame yourself anymore.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and stood up from the ground. His face was filled with determination.

“I will not give up. So what if it’s the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Moreover... The Jingdu martial arts association has made Ruoxue suffer so much. If I don’t destroy their entire family, I will never give up!”

The pavilion master comforted him, “Don’t worry about anything. You only used two years, and you have already done so much. You should be proud.”

As he spoke, the pavilion master brought Qin Yu to the tea room.

In the tea room, Jiang he was sitting there waiting for Qin Yu.

“Senior Jiang He.”Qin Yu bowed slightly, as a greeting.

Jiang he couldn’t help but sigh, “Qin Yu, your growth rate... is much faster than I imagined.”

“Since the beginning of time, you’re probably the first person to be able to bring someone out of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “It’s far from enough. There are still many experts hidden in the secret realm of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“That’s right.”Jiang he confirmed Qin Yu’s thoughts.

He sighed. “After I witnessed the power of their secret realm, I felt a sense of helplessness and defeat, and I almost lost the desire to live.”

Qin Yu looked at Jiang he and said, “Senior Jiang he, have you been to the secret territory as well?”

“That’s right, the second secret territory.”Jiang he nodded.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “In this second secret territory, I can feel many mysterious powers.”

“And before I left, there was an extremely powerful force chasing after me. Is It... The Martial Saint?”

Jiang he looked at Qin Yu and nodded, “That’s right, there is indeed a martial saint in the second secret area.”
