In an instant, the shock wave exploded directly above Qin Yu.

The destructive power directly tore Qin Yu’s body into pieces. This demonic ape’s strength was so terrifying.

Although its peak power was a level-10 power vibration domain, its thickness seemed to have been accumulated for thousands of years.

Even Qin Yu’s physical body could not withstand the force at all.

“Oh no!”

Fatty Situ’s expression changed drastically.

He suddenly used the Phantom Immortal Track.

The talisman flew into the center of the explosion like a flying sword and lit up with green energy.

The entire terrain was affected by a strange force and began to change rapidly.

Huge trees rose from the ground in just a few seconds and countless vines the size of buckets entangled in the air.

Under the scorching sun, the numerous leaves emitted a mesmerizing mist.

The mist completely covered the space. It could even prevent divine sense from probing.

Fatty Situ heaved a sigh of relief after doing all this.

This was a mystic trace talisman used to conceal internal qi.

What he was worried about now was not Qin Yu’s life. Qin Yu was not in danger with the power of sealing gods.

However, it would be doomed if the change in his body was noticed.

For example, Liu Bai had recognized the power of sealing gods at a glance.

The three peak power experts, Taoist Priest Lan Ze, Qing Han, and Shen Yu, were defeated after the talisman was released.

Their peak power was not higher than the four king-tier magical beasts. The accumulation of their peak power was also far inferior to the other side. It was already their limit to be able to hold on until now.

“Split up and run!”

Taoist Priest Lan Ze unleashed another full-force attack, barely forcing the king-tier blood lion to retreat.

He roared at the people below. Once these four kings charged into the crowd, almost no one would be able to survive.

Whoosh!

The black tail flashed past like a sharp sword.

Taoist Priest Lan Ze’s expression suddenly froze. His body was instantly cut into two by the sharp edge of the tail.

The king-tier bone dragon landed indifferently. Its tail whipped down again.

Taoist Priest Lan Ze’s entire body was smashed into minced meat.

“Kill them!”

The bone dragon that had transformed into a half-human waved its hand. The demonic beasts immediately charged into the crowd.

“There’s a power that the Path of Heaven desires in this group of people. We must not let any of them go!”

The king-tier bone dragon let out a hoarse voice.

Then, it transformed into its true form and smashed down.

In just a few moments, nearly twenty people were cut into pieces by its sharp bone edge.

After these people died, their divine souls were completely gone.

Qin Yu was surprised to find their bodies emitting some power, slowly floating into the wormhole.

Qin Yu had also used his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze to observe this power during the previous Heaven Ritual.

It was not the power of the soul, but something like the power of the central thought.

Qin Yu secretly guessed that it was similar to the power of faith in Buddhism.

His body had recovered now, but the surrounding demonic beasts had already charged over.

In this short time, the people who had already scattered to escape were killed in all directions. No one was left.

The bone dragon circled in the air before diving down again.

This time, its target was Luo Xueyi. At this moment, she was holding a little girl in her arms.

The huge shockwave had already made her unable to stand up.

“Get lost!”

Fleeing Shadow!

Qin Yu’s body suddenly pulled in front of the two of them.

Qin Yu seemed to be able to feel the terrifying wind chimes coming from the tip of the bone in the black light.

The terrifyingly high temperature once again formed a wall of fire.

The bone dragon’s tail came to a sudden halt. It did not dare to attack the Primal Chaos Flame directly.

“You’re still alive!”

Under the heavenly flame that filled the sky, a Fire Fist pierced through like a bow.

The terrifying heat directly turned half of the bone dragon’s wing into ashes and it let out a miserable wail.

It grabbed its wing with one hand and tore off half of its bone wing.

Then, it threw the burning bone wings to the ground.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s you! Thank you so much!”

Luo Xue Yi’s face turned pale. She recognized that the person who saved them was Qin Yu.

“You’re still alive!”

The king-tier dragon elephant let out a puzzled voice. At this moment, its face was full of doubt and uncertainty.

It had just seen with its own eyes that Qin Yu’s body was directly shattered into meat paste by his iron hooves.

The bone dragon, demonic ape, and golden lion also sensed something was wrong.

“Qin Yu, we have to leave this place quickly. I can sense many demonic beasts are rushing over here!”

Fatty’s face was a little pale. He had a mirror in his hand that could detect internal qi.

It seemed that something had attracted the beast tide here. They were rushing over after they had finished cleaning up the humans.

“Charge out, Fatty! Protect these two!”

At this moment, Qin Yu could not care less about what Liu Bai had said before. He unsealed all the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth.

In an instant, the Primal Chaos Flame burned completely on his body.

The terrifyingly high temperature caused the entire space to begin to distort.

Three drops of Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth shot from Qin Yu’s finger and fell on Fatty Situ, Luo Xueyi, and the little girl.

After protecting the three of them, Qin Yu completely erupted with the power of the Primal Chaos Flame.

The flames suddenly erupted, enveloping the entire sky in flames.

Nine Dragons Combined Attack!

Amidst the flames that filled the sky, nine fire dragons slowly formed.

The power of the nine dragons controlled by the Primal Chaos Fire was unimaginably powerful.

Qin Yu’s expression was ferocious. It was still very difficult for him to control the Primal Chaos Flame that was released at full strength with one-tenth of his soul power.

Along the way, space melted and hundreds of powerful Dao Consciousness Realm demonic beasts evaporated.

The bone dragon, demonic ape, golden lion, and dragon elephant were also shocked.

This power was comparable to the peak power of level 12.

Even they felt like they were about to melt under this heat wave.

They also unleashed their peak power aura and attacked the power of the nine dragons with all their might.

Boom!

In an instant, a violent force caved in the flaming space.

The flames erupted again immediately.

This force was like an unstoppable high-pressure airflow.

In the blink of an eye, it covered the four kings. In the next moment, the flames were about to engulf them.

Boom!

Two dazzling golden lights flashed and Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

In the next moment, the two huge claws had landed on the flames.

The flames seemed to have been frozen and could no longer erupt.

Countless clear cracks appeared on the nine dragons’ bodies.

Peak power of level 12- The Golden Slicer.

Boom!

The fire dragon condensed by the Primal Chaos Flame exploded into countless tiny flames.
