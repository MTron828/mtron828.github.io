1983 The Ancient Demonic Egg

Jue Wu’s technique was meticulous, but also a bit rough, which looked tremendously weird.

Her small hand slowly rubbed the natural ore.

The stone-cutting master said impatiently, “If you keep wasting time like this, I don’t know how long you’ll take.”

“Shut up!” Qin Yu glared at him and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? Shut your bloody mouth!”

Although the stone-cutting master was tremendously unhappy, he stopped saying anything further.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, nearly an hour had passed, and Jue Wu had only rubbed off a small layer.

The stone-cutting master snorted and said, “This is meaningless. If the treasure is only wrapped by a small layer of the natural ore’s outer skin, it would have been snatched away long ago. Even a fool could smell the scent within.”

Although Qin Yu was somewhat unhappy, he had to admit what the stone-cutting master said made sense.

A thin layer couldn’t retain the internal qi.

As time passed, the stone-cutting master became too lazy to watch them. The surrounding onlookers also walked to the side, no longer paying attention to Jue Wu and Qin Yu.

Not to mention them, even Qin Yu had somewhat lost his patience.

But he didn’t say anything. As long as Jue Wu liked it, it was fine.

Just when everyone had almost forgotten about Jue Wu, an incredibly strong internal qi suddenly exuded from the natural ore!

This internal qi was cold, and in a short while, he could smell a tremendously ancient scent! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Boom!”

At the same time, the sky outside suddenly changed. The originally clear sky was suddenly covered with dark clouds!

Seeing this scene, everyone couldn’t help but be tremendously shocked!

“This… is a vision? Did she really manage to cut out some treasure?”

“No, this is not! A vision would have seven-colored auspicious clouds, not like this!”

“This… This doesn’t look like a vision, but more like the birth of an ominous thing …”

Everyone’s eyes quickly turned to look at Jue Wu’s palm.

A demonic egg appeared in her hand. This egg was pitch-black, and it emitted a strong ancient internal qi.

This internal qi instantly alarmed everyone. Even the person in charge of the gambling house also walked out.

Jue Wu held the egg in her hands and seemed to like it very much.

“What do you think? I told you my luck wasn’t bad, right?” Jue Wu grinned and said.

Qin Yu looked at the egg in her hand and couldn’t help but frown.

For some reason, Qin Yu had a feeling this egg would bring disaster.

“This thing… Why is it so weird?” The person in charge knitted his brows tightly.

The rest of the people had the same feeling. Some of them were even scared, and their faces were full of unspeakable horror.

“No, I’m afraid I’ll have to report this to the elder,” the person in charge said in a deep voice.

As the gambling house was tremendously important to the Si family, certainly, there would be an elder in charge of it, and his status was not low.

Before the person in charge could turn around to look for him, the Si family elder had already walked out.

With his white hair hanging down to his shoulders and two beards almost touching the ground, he looked like a sage.

“Elder.” Seeing the elderly man, the person in charge hurriedly bowed.

The elder didn’t pay any attention to the person in charge and walked straight in Jue Wu’s direction.

Obviously, he was also alarmed by this internal qi.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He subconsciously stood in front of Jue Wu to protect her from being hurt by this elderly man.

However, the elder ignored Qin Yu and said with a kind look, “Little girl, can you let me take a look at the egg in your hand?”

Jue Wu held the egg in her arms and refused without hesitation, “No! This is mine. I can’t give it to you!”

The elder wasn’t angry. He smiled and said, “Little girl, don’t worry. I won’t take your thing away. I just want to take a look. Is that okay?”

“I’ve already said no!” Jue Wu’s attitude was unyielding.

Qin Yu also hurriedly stood in front of Jue Wu and said, “Sir, my friend has already said no. Please don’t force it through.”

The elderly man looked at Qin Yu and said, “You’re that Qin Yu, right?”

Qin Yu had a bad feeling but nodded and said, “That’s right, I’m Qin Yu.”

“Oh, I’ve heard about you and the Si family. But don’t worry, I won’t get involved in the fight between you and the younger generation,” the elder said with a smile.

Despite what he said, Qin Yu remained wary.

“Little girl, how about this? You can hold this egg and let me have a look. Is that alright?” The elder continued to look at Jue Wu.

Jue Wu thought for a while and looked at Qin Yu as if wanting him to decide.

“Don’t worry. I can’t possibly steal anything from you in front of so many people. Wouldn’t that ruin the reputation of my Si family?” the elder shook his head and said.

Jue Wu thought for a while, then held the egg with both hands and said, “You can take a look.”

The elder looked at the egg, and his eyes shone.

The light landed on the egg and wrapped it up.

At this moment, the elder’s divine sense seemed to have entered the egg, and he looked somewhat dazed.

Everyone held their breath and dared not speak as they stared at the egg.

...

A few minutes later, a trace of fear suddenly appeared on the elder’s face. The next second, he suddenly retreated a few steps and spat a mouthful of blood!

“Elder!”

The people from the gambling house rushed forward and helped the elder up.

“Elder, are you alright?” the person in charge asked worriedly.

The elder shook his head. He looked at the egg in Jue Wu’s hand with a grave expression, and his eyes showed uneasiness.

“Sir, what did you see?” Qin Yu asked.

The elder didn’t answer him but said in a deep voice, “This egg… I’m afraid it’s an ancient demonic egg.”

“An ancient demonic egg? What’s that?”

“It’s indeed from ancient times. This internal qi can’t be wrong.”

“It must be a demonic creature! The vision in the sky has explained everything!” The surrounding people began to discuss animatedly.

Qin Yu felt somewhat uneasy, but before he could speak, the elder said, “I suggest you hand it over to me, and I’ll destroy it as soon as possible. Otherwise, it will definitely bring disaster to the Holy Region.”

...

“No way! Old man, don’t talk nonsense. I’m telling you, I cut it out, so no one can take it away from me!” Jue Wu tightly held the egg in her arms and looked nervous.

Qin Yu also felt the same uneasiness. However, he also understood this thing belonged to Jue Wu. Thus it should be handled by Jue Wu.

Therefore, Qin Yu stepped forward, bowed, and said, “Sir, you’ve said you wouldn’t take this away.”

“How about this?” the elder thought for a while and said, “I can give you money or other treasures in exchange. How about it?”
