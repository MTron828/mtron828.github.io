Chapter 1684: Chapter 1,684, re-entering the Heavenly Cloud Sect 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, everyone was stunned at first, then they laughed loudly and said, “You want us to Scram? Who Are You? Are you crazy?”

“That’s right, I think the one who should scram should be you!”

“Hurry up and scram. You are not welcome in the divine capital city!”

For a moment, everyone in the city and nearby people cursed at Qin Yu non-stop.

“This kid has a treasure on him. Tell him to hand it over before he leaves!”

“That’s right. The treasure on him is definitely a treasure of heaven and earth. We must make him hand it over!”

“No wonder I have been smelling a strange smell in the divine capital. That smell probably came from his body and robbed him!”

“Hand it over!”

Qin Yu, who was already extremely disgusted, became even more determined after hearing these words.

“As expected of a group of fugitives. They really don’t have any quality to speak of,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“I will only give you five minutes. Get out of the divine capital immediately. Otherwise… kill without mercy!”Qin Yu said coldly.

However, this group of people did not care at all. Instead, they continued to ridicule him.

Seeing their attitude, Qin Yu’s heart turned cold.

His body emitted an extremely cold chill. Just as he was about to start a massacre, Peng Liu suddenly ran out in a hurry.

Peng Liu was the acting city lord of the divine capital. He had been building and managing the entire city.

Now that such a thing had happened, how could he not be anxious.

Peng Liu ran as he shouted, “Shut up!”

Seeing Peng Liu’s figure, the surrounding people finally quieted down.

Peng Liu jogged all the way to Qin Yu.

He panted heavily and said with an embarrassed smile, “City… City Lord Qin, why didn’t you inform me that you were back…”

“Inform you? Why should I inform you?”Qin Yu said coldly.

“You came at the right time. From now on, no one will be allowed to stay in Shen ‘du city. Tell them to Scram,”qin yu said coldly.

The people around were instantly stunned. They looked at Qin Yu in front of them and couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

“What? This young man is the city Lord?”

“Qin Yu? He is Qin Yu?”

“Bad… bad.”

“City Lord, we didn’t know it was you. Please forgive us, City Lord…”

Peng Liu also smiled and said, “City Lord, they really didn’t know it was you. How about… We forget about it this time…”

Qin Yu glanced at Peng Liu and said coldly, “I said, get everyone out of the Divine Capital! I don’t want to repeat myself a second time!”

Seeing that Qin Yu was serious, Peng Liu’s expression was a little awkward. Meanwhile, the surrounding people rushed forward to apologize to Qin Yu and beg for mercy.

Qin Yu said coldly, “There are still three minutes left. If you don’t leave in three minutes, don’t leave.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu directly activated the formation patterns of the divine capital. For a moment, the entire city was filled with a strong killing intent.

“Qin Yu, you… You Are Serious?”

“Qin Yu, don’t go too far. If it weren’t for us, the divine capital would definitely not have such a scene. Now, you want to start a massacre in the divine capital?”

“Let me tell you, if you chase us out of the divine capital today, we will be your enemies in the future! One more friend is better than one more enemy!”

“Bzz!”

At this moment, a divine inscription suddenly struck down like lightning, instantly killing a person who was clamoring!

“There are still two minutes left,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Everyone was stunned for a moment before their expressions changed drastically. They turned around and fled!

In the blink of an eye, the crowded divine capital was reduced to an empty city.

Looking at the fleeing crowd, Peng Liu couldn’t help but sigh.

He cupped his hands towards Qin Yu and said, “City Lord, I…”

“You can stay,”Qin Yu said.

Peng Liu smiled bitterly and said, “Thank you, City Lord.”

Qin Yu could tell that Peng Liu seemed to be a little disappointed. He also knew what he was thinking.

It was not easy for a city to develop to such a scale. Now that everything was successful, he naturally would not feel comfortable.

“Don’t worry. There will be time for you to play,”Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said.

Then, Qin Yu pointed to the back of the mountain and said, “From today onwards, no one is allowed to enter the divine capital. My Friend is in seclusion at the back of the mountain. Don’t disturb him.”

Peng Liu bowed slightly and said, “Please rest assured, City Lord.”

After doing all this, Qin Yu turned around and left the divine capital.

Peng Liu was indeed a talent in management. He would definitely be useful in the future. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As for the group of people in the Divine Capital, Qin Yu did not care at all. If he did not chase them away, after Qin Yu left, they would definitely find an opportunity to attack Zhuo Jing.

After leaving the Divine Capital, Qin Yu headed straight for the Tianyun sect.

If Xiao Sheng was still not here this time, it meant that he really had a ghost in his heart.

On the way to the Tianyun sect, Qin Yu sensed several extremely powerful auras. From time to time, light pillars would rise up not far away, as if someone was breaking through. Qin Yu’s internal Qi was extremely powerful.

The divine capital was not close to the Tianyun sect. Relying on his figure, Qin Yu also needed several days.

In these few days, Qin Yu felt the strength of at least a dozen peak mighty figures.

And the number of people who had broken through in these few days was countless.

Such a strange scene made Qin Yu even more surprised.

“The spiritual Qi seems to have become denser.”Qin Yu tried to sense the surrounding spiritual qi, and couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

Qin Yu didn’t continue to think, and headed straight for the Tianyun sect.

All the way to the Tianyun sect.

The deputy sect master did not seem surprised by Qin Yu’s arrival.

He said with a smile, “You are here to look for the sect master, right?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Has he returned?”

“The sect master has already returned. He said that if you came, he would ask you to wait for him here,”the deputy sect master said.

“Wait for him? How long will you have to wait?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

The deputy sect master spread his hands and said, “Then I don’t know. But I don’t think it will be too long. The sect master has already been on the cultivation mountain for many days.”

Although Qin Yu was a little anxious, he had no other choice at the moment. He could only wait.

Fortunately, Qin Yu did not have anything important to do at the moment. He had also encountered a bottleneck in his cultivation. Otherwise, he would have run to the foot of the Cultivation Mountain and shouted loudly.

In the next few days, Qin Yu stayed in the Heavenly Cloud sect.

And the attitude of the Heavenly Cloud sect towards Qin Yu was extremely kind. In the entire heavenly cloud sect, other than the cultivation mountain, the other places were all open to Qin Yu.

In the blink of an eye, five full days had passed.

And Xiao Sheng still had no intention of going down the mountain. This made Qin Yu somewhat anxious.

Right at this moment.

A dazzling radiance suddenly erupted from the cultivation room!

Following that, a strange phenomenon condensed in the sky!

Balls of dark clouds condensed in the sky, enveloping the day into night! 1

“Someone is about to break through!”

For a moment, everyone in the sect raised their heads and looked at this terrifying strange phenomenon!
