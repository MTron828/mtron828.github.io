Chapter 159: What Do You Think of My Spiritual Fire? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu forcefully injected the spiritual energy in his body into the pile of herbs!

At this moment, the herbs became the carrier of the spiritual energy in Qin Yu’s body!

Countless amounts of spiritual energy flowed out from Qin Yu’s body, but it wasn’t enough for alchemy!

However, Qin Yu had no other choice at the moment. He could only brace himself and continue.

“What technique is this?” Someone not far away whispered.

“What’s with that blue light? Why have I never seen it before?”

The judges below the stage also furrowed their brows tightly. It was very obvious that the technique Qin Yu had used had already exceeded their understanding.

Only Zhou Tong, his eyes carrying a hint of shock, suddenly stood up!

“This... This light blue color... is similar to the one from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion back then!” Zhou Tong, suddenly having an ominous premonition inside, muttered in a low voice!

When he was traveling in the early years, he once saw a expert refining pills!

And that expert’s method of refining pills was extremely similar to Qin Yu’s current method!

“Impossible, absolutely impossible!” Zhou Tong hurriedly shook his head and denied.

“He’s just a country bumpkin from Jiangcheng, so how could he know any experts?!” Zhou Tong said with a cold expression.

Even though that was the case, he still had some worries inside.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, half of the amount of time had passed.

There was only half an hour left until the end.

On the stage, Luo Jian’s expression was relaxed, and he wasn’t anxious at all.

He had his hands behind his back as he quietly looked at the apparatus in front of him.

Meanwhile, the other three contestants were still flustered as they tried to control the flame.

“Hmph, competing with you guys is simply a disgrace.” At this moment, Luo Jian suddenly snorted.

He glanced at the crowd not far away from the stage and said indifferently, “Today, I’ll show you guys what I’ve got!”

After saying that, Luo Jian raised his palm. Then, they saw that there was actually a flame burning in his palm!

Upon seeing this wisp of flame, everyone immediately buzzed with discussion!

“What is that?! How could there be a flame in his hand?!”

“How did he do that? Is it a special effect?”

And a martial artist exclaimed, “That... that’s a spiritual fire? Luo Jian actually conjured a spiritual fire?”

The judges, their eyes full of shock, below the stage suddenly stood up!

“Luo Jian actually generated spiritual fire? How is this possible!”

“He’s only in his twenties, so how can he have such talent?!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“With spiritual fire, how can they be his match? They’re simply worlds apart!”

Everyone was shocked by Luo Jian’s technique!

Rumor had it that those who could give birth to a spiritual fire were all geniuses that were one in ten thousand!

There were very few people who could do so in the entire Chuzhou!

“This guy will definitely be able to achieve great things in the future!” All the judges exclaimed one after another.

Luo Jian seemed to be quite satisfied with everyone’s attitude.

He played with the spiritual fire in his palm and then looked at Qin Yu.

“Kid, do you know what this is called?” Luo Jian said somewhat provocatively.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and couldn’t help but think to himself, “This kid isn’t as simple as I thought.”

When Luo Jian saw that Qin Yu didn’t speak, he laughed out loud and said, “With your limited knowledge, you don’t know what this is, do you? Fine, I’ll explain it to you today.”

“The fire in my hand is called spiritual fire. It is created through my extraordinary talent.”

“And there are very few people in the world who can produce spiritual fire! I, Luo Jian, am one of them!”

“Qin Yu, do you think there is still a need for us to compete?” Luo Jian said in a provocative manner while feeling pleased with himself.

Qin Yu pulled his hand out of the medicinal paste.

He looked at the pile of medicinal paste and muttered in a low voice, “It should be about it. Although I can’t refine any top-grade pill, it should be considered top-grade in the secular world.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned his head to look at Luo Jian.

“You dare to call that bean-sized flame in your hand spiritual fire?” Qin Yu sneered.

After he heard Qin Yu’s words, Luo Jian’s expression suddenly changed.

“How ignorant!” Luo Jian said coldly.

“It’s not easy to produce spiritual fire, even if it’s only the size of a bean!”

“There are countless pharmacists in the world, and which one of them isn’t crazy about spiritual fire? You are too ignorant. How dare you say something so outrageous?!”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said with a nonchalant smile, “I don’t think there is anything special about your spiritual fire.”

Anger flashed across Luo Jian’s face! Even the flame in his hand flickered rapidly!

“Are you anxious?” Qin Yu looked at the restless flame in his hand and couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows as he asked.

Luo Jian said coldly, “Ignorant people are gutsy! Let me tell you, people who have spiritual fire surpass all the pharmacists in the world!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Then, he gently opened his palm, and a blue flame instantly appeared in Qin Yu’s palm!

“Then what do you think of my spiritual fire?” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.
