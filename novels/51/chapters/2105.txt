2106 It Shocked the World

Qin Yu coldly glanced at the several elders of the Yao family and said, “I don’t believe the Yao family would do such a despicable thing in front of everyone. But of course, even if you are shameless, I, Qin Yu, am not afraid.”

After saying that, with a loud shout, Qin Yu forcefully adjusted his internal qi to the extreme!

A terrifying internal qi swept out, shaking in all directions!

Everyone was instantly shocked!

“After experiencing such a great battle, Qin Yu still has such terrifying battle prowess!”

“From the looks of it, Qin Yu hasn’t used his full strength yet!”

“It’s terrifying, too terrifying! Where is Qin Yu’s peak state?”

Everyone was discussing animatedly, but the faces of the Yao family’s elders were ashen.

They snorted coldly and said, “My Yao family would never do such a thing. But let me tell you, Qin Yu, you’ve long made enemies with the people of the world. It’s only a matter of time before you die!”

“That you don’t have to worry,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

He walked toward the crowd. Before he could get close, Jue Wu had run over.

She threw herself into Qin Yu’s arms and said excitedly, “I knew you would be fine!”

Qin Yu’s face turned pale. He lowered his voice and said softly, “Quick, I can’t hold on any longer. Let’s quickly leave this place…”

Jue Wu was quick-witted. She quickly understood Qin Yu’s meaning and hurriedly transferred true energy to him. After that, she quickly left the place with Qin Yu.

Everyone wanted to come forward to congratulate him, but Qin Yu did not give them the chance at all. He left the place extremely fast, hiding her achievements and fame.

Seeing Qin Yu’s back quickly disappear, everyone was stunned for a moment.

“Qin Yu… He…”

“This is too shocking! He actually broke through Yao Xi’s golden lotus defense. This kind of power… is unbelievable!”

“I thought he had reached his limit. I didn’t expect him to have remaining strength. It’s unbelievable!”

“That’s right, Qin Yu’s battle prowess is simply beyond imagination. Yao Xi’s strength is already unrivaled in our eyes, but in front of Qin Yu, he’s like a fragile paper!”

“This is clearly not his true strength! Most importantly, he did not have any intention to show off at all. He just turned around and left!”

“The demeanor of a top-notch martial artist. This is the demeanor of an expert!”

The discussions were endless, and everyone’s faces were full of surprise and shock. Qin Yu’s strength had undoubtedly broadened their horizons.

As for the Yao family’s elders, their expressions were extremely ugly at this moment. They did not expect Qin Yu to still have the strength to escape under such circumstances. This instilled a profound sense of terror in them.

“We have to find him as soon as possible. Otherwise, once he recovers his strength, the consequences will be unimaginable!” an elder said in a deep voice.

The others nodded solemnly. They understood the seriousness of this matter.

While everyone was discussing animatedly, Jue Wu had already brought Qin Yu away from this place and disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Qin Yu’s body was tremendously weak at this moment. Although there was still determination in his eyes, his body could no longer support him to continue walking.

“Don’t be afraid. I’ll take you away from here,” Jue Wu patted Qin Yu’s head and said.

“Thank you very much…” Qin Yu said weakly. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jue Wu did not say anything. Bringing Qin Yu along, she rushed toward a city.

Qin Yu was in urgent need of rest and also needed the transfer of true energy. It was obviously unrealistic to return to Thunder Courtyard directly.

Thus Jue Wu brought Qin Yu to a city called “Quiet Wind City.” It was located between Qin Yu’s location and Thunder Courtyard. It was a big bustling city with convenient transportation and bustling streets and crowded areas due to the significant flow of pedestrians.

After entering Quiet Wind City, Jue Wu checked in a quiet inn and settled Qin Yu down.

Although they were in a foreign land, Jue Wu was very careful with Qin Yu’s treatment and did not dare to be careless at all. She stayed by Qin Yu’s side the whole time, transferring true energy to him and at the same time, using pills to treat his injuries.

Looking at Qin Yu’s gradually stabilizing internal qi, the worry in Jue Wu’s heart also lessened a little.

At this time, Qin Yu had already fallen into a deep sleep. Although his face was pale, his breathing had become much more stable.

After Qin Yu settled down, Jue Wu left the inn. She needed to find some herbs in case of emergency.

In the Yao family, the elders of the family had ugly expressions on their faces.

They learned from the witnesses that Qin Yu had escaped, which shocked them tremendously.

“That Qin Yu actually has such strength…”

“We must find him as soon as possible. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable…”

Turning around, they saw Yao Xi lying on the bed, half-dead. Clearly, he was severely injured.

What was even more unacceptable was that Yao Xi had lost three golden lotuses.

The outside world only knew that the three golden lotuses were for saving lives, but they did not know that three golden lotuses were equivalent to three lives.

As long as their primordial spirits were not destroyed, they could be revived perfectly.

But now, to defeat Qin Yu, Yao Xi had used all three golden lotuses.

Most importantly, he did not win!

It was a great insult to everyone.

The outside world was discussing this matter animatedly. Almost the entire Holy Region was discussing this matter.

“Yao Xi lost, and it was such a tragic loss!”

“That Qin Yu’s strength is too terrifying!”

“I’m afraid the Yao family will suffer heavy losses this time. Yao Xi’s strength has been greatly damaged, and it will take a long time for him to recover.”

“I heard that Qin Yu hasn’t used his full strength yet. If that’s true, then how strong is he?”

All these made the elders of the Yao family feel even more uneasy. They had to find Qin Yu as soon as possible. Otherwise, the consequences would be unpredictable.

In the inn in Quiet Wind City, Qin Yu was still in a deep sleep. His injuries were slowly recovering, and Jue Wu was also constantly sending true energy to him to help him recover.

Seeing Qin Yu’s condition gradually improved, Jue Wu heaved a sigh of relief.

Several days passed.

Qin Yu, lying on the bed, finally opened his eyes slowly.

He spat out a mouthful of black blood, and his pale face instantly gained a hint of rosy color.

“You’re awake!”

Seeing Qin Yu wake up, Jue Wu was incredibly excited.

Qin Yu rubbed his eyes and said, “How long have I been unconscious?”

“I don’t remember, but it’s been a long time anyway.” Jue Wu counted with her fingers for a long time, but still could not figure it out.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “During this period… Did anyone come and look for trouble?”

“No, it’s very quiet,” Jue Wu said.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He slowly got up from the bed and went to the window.

A bustling scene could be seen by the window with crowds of people and an extraordinary liveliness.
