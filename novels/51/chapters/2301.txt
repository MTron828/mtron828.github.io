2302 The Paramita Flower

A lot of Xiao Yu’s soul dissipated when it fused with the masked woman’s. There was a high chance she could be saved if she took this pill.

“Paramita Flower, the legendary ominous flower?”

Mei Li asked in surprise.

“Do you know?”

From her expression, Qin Yu could tell she seemed to know the whereabouts of the flower.

“It’s in the Crescent Moon Continent, very close to here. Spatial disruptions occur frequently over there, and foreign races often appear.”

Mei Li nodded.

After confirming the coordinates with Mei Li, Qin Yu planned to set off immediately.

Xiao Yu’s condition was tremendously bad, and Qin Yu needed to race against time.

“I won’t go. Although I can’t comprehend the Path of Heaven now, the spiritual energy here is abundant. I can cultivate here,” Mei Li said with a frown.

Qin Yu did not force her. After he boarded the warship, he headed toward the coordinates marked by Mei Li.

After sailing for about a day, the warship was approaching the Crescent Moon Continent.

It was a vast space, but it almost had no spiritual energy.

The space was full of miasma, and traces of cracks appeared in many places.

It was unknown where the space was connected to, but it emitted a strange internal qi.

The entire continent seemed lifeless.

Qin Yu released his divine sense to the utmost but could not find any trace of the Paramita Flower.

His father’s formula only described the characteristics of the Paramita Flower, but it did not specify its exact form.

“If I were to search slowly, it might be time-consuming!”

Qin Yu frowned. Suddenly, he had a thought.

His body instantly arrived in a forest. There were countless massive trees there that soared into the clouds.

The massive vines were coiling around like giant pythons, and countless poisonous insects, snakes, and ants were lurking in the deepest part of the forest, hissing from time to time.

At this moment, a teenage girl was picking mushrooms in front of a massive thicket barefooted.

“Hehe! These mushrooms are enough for my family to consume for a long time.”

She chuckled happily.

“Ahem.”

Qin Yu coughed several times.

The little girl was obviously frightened by Qin Yu. The basket in her hand slipped and dropped to the ground.

Her body trembled, and her hand held a small knife tightly as if she did not know how to react to the man who suddenly appeared before her.

“Little girl, don’t be afraid. I have something to ask you.”

Qin Yu tried his best to be more amiable.

“You said…”

The little girl became slightly less nervous upon seeing Qin Yu seem not to have ill intentions.

“Swish!”

Suddenly, a sound came from the bushes more than a meter high behind the little girl.

A hungry wolf with yellow light in its eyes suddenly pounced on the little girl, causing the little girl to scream in fear.

Qin Yu flicked his finger, and the hungry wolf instantly collapsed to the ground.

“Thank you. Do you want the meat?”

The little girl said timidly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Oh? I don’t want it.” Qin Yu was suddenly stunned, not knowing why the little girl asked this.

“Wow, that’s great!”

She skillfully dissected the hungry wolf on the ground and segregated its fur and meat. Her gestures looked very skillful.

“Little girl, have you been living here?”

Qin Yu asked curiously.

“That’s right, Big Brother. Our village’s ancestors all lived here, but the people here are getting lesser now.”

“Why?”

“In the past, there were still some docile things here, such as deer, rabbits, and fish that we could hunt. However, in recent years, those animals have become increasingly ferocious, and there are many strange creatures. Many people in the village who went out hunting had died. People are scared of going out now.”

The little girl said with a gloomy expression.

Qin Yu sighed. There was no spiritual energy at all in this place, and there were poisonous miasma and clouds everywhere. It was really difficult for ordinary people to live here.

“Big Brother, what made you come here?”

The little girl divided the meat and skillfully tied it with rattan before carrying it on her shoulder.

“Big Brother is looking for a kind of flower that has an exceptional magical power. When you get close to it, it might affect your thoughts. Do you know where to find this kind of flower?”

Qin Yu described in detail to the little girl. The Paramita Flower had powerful magical powers. When an ordinary person approached it, it would probably affect the person’s brain.

“I think I’ve seen that kind of flower before. It’s a very beautiful flower. Dad and I have seen it before.”

The little girl gritted her teeth and said.

“Okay, where is it, and can you bring me there?”

Qin Yu was overjoyed when he heard that.

“Big Brother, don’t go. That flower is so dangerous. My father just glanced at it back then, and he ended up staring blankly and jumped off a cliff!”

The young girl said, her eyes turning red.

“Don’t be afraid. Big Brother is very powerful. I’ll protect you to keep you safe.”

Qin Yu condensed a trace of spiritual energy and directly blew up a towering tree in the distance.

The little girl widened her eyes as if looking at an immortal.

“I’ll bring you there then.”

Seeing this, the little girl was no longer afraid. She led the way in the front.

The little girl did not stop until she had passed through countless jungles.

Qin Yu was somewhat impressed. He did not know how this little girl remembered such a complicated path.

“Big Brother, it’s right in front, but you must be careful. Dad only glanced at it back then, and then he seemed to have lost his soul.”

The little girl held Qin Yu’s hand and said worriedly.

“Don’t worry. Big Brother is very powerful.”

Qin Yu smiled and patted the little girl’s head.

He walked toward the depth of the forest, passing through another thicket of bushes.

A vast desert, about two kilometers in radius, was before him.

At the center, a dark purple flower stood in the desert.

That massive flower was like a strange smiling face. Qin Yu only glanced at it slightly, and his pupils seemed to have been attracted by the bud in the center.

There was indeed something!

Qin Yu instantly broke free from that soul restraint.

There were a few spatial cracks around the flower, and a strange internal qi came out from the void. The Paramita Flower was absorbing this internal qi.

Qin Yu put away the Paramita Flower into his Sumeru ring and scanned it with his divine sense.

There were dozens of Paramita Flowers in this area, and Qin Yu kept them all.

Suddenly, a dark blue figure passed through a spatial rift.

The moment it saw Qin Yu, it suddenly let out a wild cry and pounced toward him.

Qin Yu grabbed its neck with one hand. In an instant, black demonic qi spread out from its body.

When the demonic qi landed on Qin Yu’s chaotic qi, it emitted a sizzling sound like an intense demonic qi.

Qin Yu twisted its neck lightly and broke it directly.

The moment the head landed on the ground, it roared and erupted with a wave of demonic qi, biting toward Qin Yu’s neck.
