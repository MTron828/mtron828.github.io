Every major power was an expert, but when the battle came, it wasn’t worth mentioning.

Facing everyone’s chaotic battle, Qin Yu didn’t even dare to Blink.

Towards such a big battle, he seemed to have a natural interest.

“What’s there to see? Let’s go drink.”Big Wen pulled Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Let’s wait. This kind of big battle isn’t common. To me, it can be considered accumulating experience.”

“Uh, then we’ll go first.”Big Wen said.

“The Gathering Sage Building is waiting for you.”Second Wen said.

Qin Yu agreed and then looked at the battlefield again.

Facing so many mighty realm experts, that old man was getting worse and worse. From time to time, he would spit out fresh blood.

There were already many wounds on his body, and he stood there on the verge of collapse.

Although his strength was formidable, he was still extremely powerless against so many people.

“Old Fellow, hand over the thing, and perhaps we can spare your life,”someone coldly berated.

“If you don’t hand it over, we’ll kill you. The Huangji Buddha Flame will still be ours!”

The old man gritted his teeth. He glared at everyone and coldly said, “Don’t even think about it. Even if I die, I won’t hand this thing over to you!”

“If that’s the case, then you can go to hell!”

After an explosive shout, they attacked the old man once again.

But at this moment, the old man’s palm suddenly turned into a ball of light.

This ball of light was held in his hand. It had a scorching temperature and was extremely dazzling.

And everyone seemed to feel a trace of fear as they looked at the old man warily.

The old man gritted his teeth and threw the light in his hand forward!

No one dared to take it head-on and immediately dodged to the side.

The light rushed out of the dust and headed straight for Qin Yu!

With such speed, Qin Yu had no time to dodge.

His expression changed drastically, and he felt a trace of fear in his heart!

One had to know that this was an attack from a late-stage mighty figure. It was not something Qin Yu could withstand!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and immediately activated the fifth level of the battle word formula. He braced himself and grabbed at it.

“Pa!”

The light collided with Qin Yu’s fist, but there wasn’t the slightest bit of force.

The light on the surface quickly faded away.

What was wrapped under the light was actually Huangji fo Yan!

Qin Yu was stunned for half a second, then he was ecstatic!

This old man actually threw out Huangji fo Yan! It seemed that even if he died, he didn’t intend to hand over Huangji fo Yan to these people!

Qin Yu did not dare to think too much about it. He hurriedly stored the Huangji Buddha flame into the spatial magic artifact and ran away!

“You Can’t blame me for this. This was given to me,”Qin Yu muttered as he ran.

If that old man walked out alive, then he would return the Huangji Buddha flame to him.

If he died in battle, then Qin Yu could only reluctantly accept it.

At this time, no one on the battlefield knew that the Huangji Buddha Flame had been thrown out by the old man. They were still forcing him to hand it over.

“Chi!”

A Ray of light pierced through the old man’s chest. Blood spurted out from the old man’s mouth, and his internal Qi quickly became weak.

“Old Thing, don’t put up a stubborn resistance. Hand it over.”

The old man grinned and said coldly, “The Huangji Buddha Flame is no longer with me. I’ve already given it to someone else, and it’s on one of you...”

As soon as these words were said, everyone immediately looked at each other, their faces full of vigilance.

“Don’t listen to his nonsense. He just wants to sow discord between us.”Someone snorted coldly.

The old man wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth, he said cruelly, “Do you think I’m sowing discord between us? That Ball of light just now covered the Huangji Buddha Flame! As for who he ended up in, I don’t know.”

Everyone’s faces changed. They quickly moved forward and checked the old man’s body, including his spatial magic artifact.

As expected, the Huangji Buddha Flame had disappeared!

“Old Thing, you’re courting death!”Someone was furious and directly pierced through the old man’s chest!

The old man had died in battle!

“Why did you kill him?”At this moment, someone in the fog asked coldly.

“That’s right. Did the Huangji Buddha Flame fall into your hands and you want to kill him to silence him?”

“Nonsense, the Huangji Buddha Flame isn’t on me.”

“We don’t know whether it is on him or not! The Huangji Buddha flame on him has disappeared. It must be hidden on someone else’s body!”

“Why are you looking at me? Are you suspecting me?”

“How do you know that I am looking at you? Do you have a guilty conscience? Hand it over!”

“I think you are courting death!”

The great battle began again. This time, it was even more chaotic. Everyone had lost their target and was in a chaotic battle.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already brought Huang Ji Fo Yan to the Ju Xian restaurant.

He was panting heavily. Even though he was trying hard to suppress his excitement, a smile that could not be hidden could still be seen on his face.

“What’s wrong? Did you pick up the money? Why Are You So Happy?”Asked Wen da suspiciously.

“That’s right. Even if I picked up the money, I wouldn’t be so happy,”Wen er also said.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It’s okay. I’m just honored by the experience I learned today.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Are they done fighting?”Asked Wen Da.

“Not yet. It’ll probably take some time,”said Qin Yu with a smile.

“Okay, let’s not talk about this. Hurry up and eat. I’m hungry.”Qin Yu picked up his chopsticks and began to wolf down his food.

Seeing Qin Yu’s attitude, Wen da muttered, “He must have picked up the money.”

Qin Yu could not help but think to himself.

This was more exciting than picking up money.
