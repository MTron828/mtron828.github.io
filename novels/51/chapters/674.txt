Chapter 675: Tempering the Body with True Fire Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the coffin, the man with the mustache seemed to have goosebumps.

He shivered, but he still nodded and said, “Okay, but... you have to be careful. I keep feeling that this coffin is very scary.”

Qin Yu ignored the man with the mustache’s words. It wasn’t his first time entering this coffin.

Moreover, Qin Yu didn’t encounter any accidents.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He immediately opened the coffin and jumped in.

“Let’s begin.” Qin Yu glanced at the man with the mustache and said.

The man with the mustache nodded. He closed the coffin and pushed the coffin to the mouth of the huge pit with all his strength.

The heatwave from the shop was coming. This kind of feeling was very uncomfortable.

Therefore, the man with the mustache hurriedly pushed the coffin in.

The coffin rapidly fell into the huge pit, and Qin Yu, who was in the coffin, was extremely safe.

The cold air in the coffin was beyond imagination. Even True Fire couldn’t invade it!

The coffin quickly fell to the bottom of the pit, and the surrounding flames seemed to be about to devour the coffin.

Qin Yu, who was lying in the coffin, couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

“Please let me successfully get this material,” Qin Yu thought inside.

Then, he slowly pushed the coffin board.

The coffin only opened a small opening, and Qin Yu felt an intense heatwave rushing toward him!

Qin Yu only felt his palm being roasted until it hurt, and the flames kept drilling into the coffin!

“Damn it!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but withdraw his hand.

He glanced at his palm, and saw that it was already burning red. He could even smell the smell of roasted meat.

“This True Fire really lives up to its reputation,” Qin Yu thought as he lay in the coffin.

However, he had already come down, so Qin Yu didn’t retreat.

He lay in the coffin and thought for a moment, then activated the Saintly Body Technique to forcefully take this material.

Golden light suddenly appeared in the coffin, and Qin Yu’s body became indestructible.

He took a deep breath and then braced himself to push open a small opening in the coffin.

Then, Qin Yu stretched out his arm.

The moment he stretched out his arm, Qin Yu felt waves of pain! His entire arm seemed to be burnt!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to poke his head out. He could only endure the pain and rub it in the flames.

Once, twice, thrice...

Qin Yu took all kinds of strange-shaped gravel from the pit. Each piece was burned red by the fire.

He didn’t know which piece was the material needed, so he could only continue to fumble.

During this time, Qin Yu’s arm had been burned until his skin and flesh were torn! The intense pain made Qin Yu sweat continuously.

Outside the coffin, there was a burning fire, but inside the coffin, there was an ice-cold chill.

“Which one is the material...” Qin Yu looked down at the broken stones that were brought in and couldn’t help but frown.

These broken stones didn’t seem to be the required material.

Qin Yu glanced at his arm. The flesh and blood of his arm had been burnt to a pulp, even exposing his white bones.

“F * ck!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

“At worst, I’ll lose this arm!” Qin Yu was determined inside!

He extended his arm out again and continued to fumble outside.

Finally, the heavens didn’t disappoint. Qin Yu took out a fiery red glowing bead from the fire pit.

The bead was burning with raging flames, but the moment Qin Yu took the coffin, the flames immediately disappeared.

The bead looked extraordinary, like a fiery-red golden core with a burning internal qi.

“This should be it,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He retracted his arm. The flesh and blood on his arm had been completely burned.

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s bones were not damaged, but under the attack of the fire, they became black.

“With this golden core, I should be able to resurrect the two male corpses.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but look forward to it.

The strength of the two male corpses couldn’t be estimated, and even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association couldn’t compare to them!

Qin Yu closed the coffin and said in a low voice, “It’s time to go up.”

Then, Qin Yu grabbed the coffin with one hand, and his internal qi surged to forcefully take the coffin away from the pit of fire.

Waves of internal qi began to brew within the coffin.

The entire coffin began to tremble slightly as it slowly rose up from the pit of fire!

Qin Yu let out an angry roar as the internal qi on his body erupted. He brought the coffin with him and forcefully rushed upwards!

“Hula!”

The instant the coffin rose up, the True Fire in the pit of fire seemed to become frantic!

The flames were like a huge hand trying to grab the coffin!

Qin Yu only felt a huge force suppressing him, and the coffin couldn’t help but fall down!

“Damn it, could it be that this True Fire also has a spiritual sense?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to think too much. He adjusted the internal qi in his body to the maximum, and went all out to fight against the flames!

They were in a stalemate for a moment. Both sides seemed to be competing in terms of strength.

The veins on Qin Yu’s forehead bulged as he exerted his strength to the maximum.

He roared, “I don’t believe that I’ll be restricted by mere flames!”

Following Qin Yu’s angry roar, the golden light in the coffin suddenly erupted!

This golden light seemed to have merged with the coffin as the entire coffin finally began to slowly rise up!

After more than ten minutes, Qin Yu struggled to carry the coffin out of the fire pit.

The moment he landed on the ground, Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

“Damn it, this flame is too terrifying,” Qin Yu muttered.

The man with the mustache hurriedly ran over and pushed the coffin board away. He asked in a panic, “You’re still alive?”

Qin Yu nodded and climbed out of the coffin. Then, he frowned and said, “This flame really isn’t simple.”

Looking at Qin Yu’s arm that was almost burned to the ground, the man with the mustache couldn’t help but shiver.

“It’s really scary. If it were me, I would probably be burned to ashes,” the man with the mustache muttered as he looked into the coffin.

Qin Yu glanced at it and said, “That bead should be the material you want.”

The man with the mustache nodded repeatedly and said, “Not bad. It’s that bead. Help me take it out.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “You don’t know how to take it out yourself?”

The man with the mustache shivered and said, “I don’t want to put my hand into that coffin. It brings bad luck.”

Qin Yu had no choice but to take out the bead from the coffin and hand it to the man with the mustache.

“The materials should all be here by now, right?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache touched his chin and said with a smile, “The only thing missing is the mask.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He stood at the side and stared at the coffin, showing no signs of leaving.

“Let’s go. Aren’t you in a hurry?” The man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu shook his head. He pointed at a few stones that had been brought out from the fire pit and said, “Why do you think these stones haven’t been cremated? Also, why are the walls of this huge pit able to withstand True Fire?”

The sudden question confused the man with the mustache.

He scratched his head and said, “That’s right, what you said seems to make sense...”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Do you think it’s possible that this place was just a small pit at the beginning, but it became bigger and bigger under the attack of the True Fire?”

The man with the mustache was confused as he listened. He didn’t seem to understand what Qin Yu meant.

Qin Yu continued, “In other words... the stones here are just ordinary stones. But under the slow invasion of the True Fire, they began to be able to withstand the True Fire...”

The man with the mustache’s expression changed slightly.

He seemed to have guessed something, and then said in surprise, “What... What do you want to do?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “If my body is tempered by the True Fire, do you think my body will become stronger and stronger until it can withstand the True Fire?”
