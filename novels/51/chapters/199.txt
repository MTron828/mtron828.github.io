On the other hand, after Qin Yu woke up, he felt that his body had almost fully recovered.

The number of hangers-on who came to visit was still endless. For a while, Qin Yu was somewhat overwhelmed.

It was time to return to Jiangcheng, Qin Yu thought to himself.

At the very least, there wouldn’t be so many people who came to disturb him in Jiangcheng. It was relatively quiet, so Qin Yu could take this opportunity to refine medicine to save Wei Ming.

Other than that, Qin Yu was also a little worried about the situation in Jiangcheng. After all, Jiang Gu had been there once.

Therefore, Qin Yu drove to Jiangcheng on the same day.

The news of Qin Yu’s return to Jiangcheng spread like wildfire. As long as someone saw him on the road, he would take the initiative to greet Qin Yu.

The impact of this incident had far exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination.

Not long after Qin Yu returned home, Lei Hu drove to Dragon Paradise Villa.

Upon seeing Qin Yu, Lei Hu fell to his knees with a plop.

He burst into tears and lost his usual gangster-like demeanor.

Qin Yu stretched out his palm, and a gentle force helped Lei Hu up.

“What are you crying for? What happened?” Qin Yu frowned.

Lei Hu sobbed as he told Qin Yu what had happened.

“These people are all two-faced. If it weren’t for them, Lance wouldn’t have lost two of his legs...” As he spoke, Lei Hu’s tears flowed down his face again. “Lance...” .

Qin Yu’s expression was a little unsightly, and a wave of anger suddenly rose up.

He took a deep breath and slowly said, “Lei Hu, arrange a dinner tonight. Just say that you want to welcome me back.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay. Mr. Qin, who do you need to invite?”

“No one needs to be invited. Those who are willing to come will naturally come,” Qin Yu said slowly.

Lei Hu hurriedly nodded and said, “I’ll go and arrange it right away.”

After Lei Hu left, Qin Yu turned around and went upstairs.

Since Jiang Gu could easily summon this group of merchants, why not Qin Yu?

“Maybe I was too low-key,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was because of this that Qin Yu’s position in everyone’s heart wasn’t that high.

Then, Qin Yu found a chef and prepared a table full of dishes while waiting for the arrival of everyone.

In the evening, countless merchants flocked to the scene.

The people of Jiangcheng didn’t want to miss this opportunity.

They all came to Dragon Paradise Villa with generous gifts.

Even Zheng Mingshuo came to the scene.

“Mr. Qin, I really didn’t expect you to develop to such a level in such a short time,” Zheng Mingshuo sighed.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I was just lucky.”

“Mr. Qin, don’t be modest,” Zheng Mingshuo said with a wry smile.

Soon, the Dragon Paradise Villa was full of people.

Among these people, some relied on the Soul Nourishment Pill to make a living, and some purely came to welcome Qin Yu.

After a while, Lei Hu also came to the scene.

He pushed Lance, who was sitting in the wheelchair, and walked toward Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin,” Lance greeted Qin Yu.

Looking at Lance, who was sitting in the wheelchair, Qin Yu felt a little guilty.

“Don’t worry, your leg will recover.” Qin Yu patted Lance on the shoulder.

Lei Hu gritted his teeth and said, “Mr. Qin, don’t let these people off the hook no matter what!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I have my own plans. Please take your seat.”

Then, Qin Yu brought Lei Hu into the banquet hall.

When they saw Lei Hu, the expressions of many people present turned ugly.

“Mr. Lei, you’re here too.” The person who spoke was called Xiong Yi, the boss of a pharmaceutical factory.

Originally, Xiong Yi’s company was very ordinary. However, ever since he established ties with Qin Yu, the company also developed on a greater scale.

And he was the leader of this group of people. When they were kissing up to Jiang Gu back then, he was the first to stand out.

“Since a piece of trash like you is here, why can’t I come?” Lei Hu said in a bad mood.

Xiong Yi smiled embarrassedly and said, “Mr. Lei, why are you so angry? Sit down quickly. Let’s drink a little.”

Lei Hu snorted and didn’t say anything.

After Qin Yu came to the table, Xiong Yi took the lead to hold the wine glass, then stood up and said, “Congratulations, Mr. Qin, for returning home with honor. Let me toast to you!”

“Okay.” Qin Yu raised his wine cup and clinked it with Xiong Yi.

Xiong Yi was immediately overjoyed.

It seemed that Qin Yu didn’t blame him!

Hence, the others followed suit and raised their wine cups to toast Qin Yu one by one.

Qin Yu didn’t reject them and clinked them one by one.

This confused Lei Hu somewhat. He said anxiously, “Mr. Qin, they...”

Before Lei Hu could finish speaking, he was interrupted by Qin Yu with a wave of his hand.

They drank and ate merrily.

The atmosphere of this meal was quite harmonious. Only Lei Hu was sulking.

Soon, the meal came to an end.

“Mr. Qin, I didn’t expect you to be so accomplished. We deeply admire you!” Xiong Yi said with a smile.

The others also followed suit and started to flatter him.

Qin Yu smiled. He put down the wine cup in his hand and swept his gaze towards the crowd. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Everyone is doing this for the sake of wealth, so there’s no such thing as right and wrong. Even if you guys followed Jiang Gu, I would understand,” Qin Yu said slowly.

Hearing him say this, everyone at the scene heaved a long sigh of relief.

“However... Some people took advantage of others while they were down. This makes me feel a little disgusted.” Qin Yu changed the topic, and his tone instantly became somewhat cold.

The atmosphere instantly stiffened, and for a moment, it was a little awkward.

Qin Yu swept his gaze over everyone and said indifferently, “Now, if you take the initiative to admit your mistake, I might be able to let you off the hook.”

This group of people looked around and finally focused their gazes on Xiong Yi, as if they were waiting for Xiong Yi to set an example.

Xiong Yi stood up and said, “Mr. Qin, what are you saying? Jiang Gu is nothing. Does he deserve to be compared to you?”

“Xiong Yi, that’s not what you said back then!” Lei Hu immediately flew into a rage.

Xiong Yi ignored Lei Hu and continued, “Mr. Qin, don’t be blinded by this lowly person!”

“Who the f * ck are you calling a lowly person?!” Lei Hu shouted angrily.

Xiong Yi was unmoved. He snorted lightly and said, “I think everyone here knows who I’m talking about.”

After everyone heard Xiong Yi’s words, it was as if they had received an order. They all nodded and said, “Yes, Mr. Xiong is right. Mr. Qin, you must not be blinded by this lowly person!”

Lei Hu was so angry that he almost flew into a rage. He glared at Xiong Yi angrily and wished that he could tear him apart with his own hands!

“Mr. Qin, you’ve seen it. Everyone knows the truth!” Xiong Yi said with a smile.

Qin Yu looked at Xiong Yi. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Xiong Yi, not only did you hit me when I was down, but you also took me for an idiot.”

Xiong Yi’s expression changed. He was about to say something, but Qin Yu had already waved his big hand!

“Bang!” Xiong Yi was sent flying! Fresh blood spewed out non-stop!

Xiong Yi’s expression was somewhat ugly, but he knew very clearly that he couldn’t admit it no matter what!

Thus, Xiong Yi ignored the pain and crawled up from the ground. He said aggrievedly, “Mr. Qin, you have misunderstood me. What I said is absolutely true!”

“Absolutely true?” Qin Yu sneered repeatedly.

“You really don’t shed tears until you see the coffin.” After saying that, Qin Yu clapped his hands.

A large screen suddenly appeared on the wall.

“Xiong Yi, do you know that there is something called a surveillance camera?” Qin Yu said with a sneer.
