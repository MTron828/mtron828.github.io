Chapter 1476: Chapter 1,476, Purple Spiritual Fire 1

Feeling the internal Qi of the medicine Saint Hall, Qin Yu became more and more excited.

Only in this part of the sky could one’s talent be released.

After taking a few steps forward, the old man suddenly stopped and said, “Mr. Qin, please wait a moment.”

Qin Yu was stunned and said, “Aren’t we going to the top floor?”

The old man smiled and said, “There’s no need to go to the top floor for the assessment. Please wait here. I’ll inform them.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and then stood there waiting.

The old man walked up quickly.

At this moment, the guard suddenly walked in front of Qin Yu.

He tugged at the corner of Qin Yu’s clothes and whispered, “You’re going to take the assessment, right?”

Qin Yu glanced at the guard and nodded, “Yes, why?”

The guard glanced around. After making sure that no one was around, he said in a low voice, “I advise you to give up. This medicine sacred hall relies on the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s supply. Do you think they will let you in easily?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

The guard sighed and continued, “To tell you the truth, in order not to offend you, they will choose a very difficult pill for you to refine. This will ensure that you will not be able to join the Medicine Sacred Hall.”

“To put it bluntly, they will definitely make things difficult for you.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s eyes could not help but narrow slightly.

He looked at the guard and said, “Why are you telling me this?”

The guard snorted and said, “They don’t treat me as a human. I don’t like them. It’s as simple as that.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He didn’t expect this group of people to deliberately make things difficult for him.

“So, I advise you to leave,”said the guard.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Okay, I got it. Thank you for the Reminder.”

Although he said that, Qin Yu had no intention of leaving.

When the guard saw this, he didn’t say anything more.

“Don’t say that I told you,”the guard said softly before leaving.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry.”

Not long after the guard left, the old man walked down from upstairs.

Three old men followed by his side.

These three old men had solemn expressions and were filled with dignity. Every step they took was extremely steady.

What surprised Qin Yu was that these people’s strength had already stepped into the mighty realm.

This was practically impossible on earth, because no one had that much energy. They could both cultivate and refine pills.

“The holy region is indeed different.”Qin Yu sighed.

Compared to Earth’s harsh cultivation environment, the holy region was simply too comfortable.

“You are Qin Yu?”An old man took the lead and asked.

Because he knew their intentions, Qin Yu didn’t give him any face. He immediately asked back, “You are the assessment officer?”

The Elder was startled. He originally wanted to give Qin Yu a show of force to gain the initiative.

However, Qin Yu didn’t fall for his trick at all. For a moment, he was in a bit of a mess.

“I am the main assessment officer this time. My name is Su Song,”the elder said.

Qin Yu made an ‘oh’sound, then raised his eyebrows and said, “Tell me, what pill do you want me to Refine?”

Su Song said indifferently, “There’s no need to be in such a hurry. Come with us.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He followed Su Song and came to a room.

This room was obviously a temporary one. The surroundings were dark and even a little damp.

There was not a trace of sunlight in this place, and spiritual Qi was also extremely scarce here.

Obviously, this group of people wanted to make things difficult for Qin Yu.

“This is the room for your assessment,”Su Song said indifferently.

Qin Yu glanced at it and then snorted coldly, “What kind of place did you find for me? Do you guys usually refine pills here?”

Su Song was stunned, then said, “The assessment is up to us. You can leave, or you can choose not to take the assessment.”

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “Damn it, Old Thing, are you trying to deliberately make things difficult for me?”

Su Song’s face instantly turned extremely ugly. He didn’t expect that Qin Yu would actually not give him any face at all.

“Also, where is your alchemy king? Why isn’t he here?”Qin Yu said with a dark face.

Su song berated, “Watch your words! How can you meet our alchemy king just because you want to! You can talk about it after you get past US first.”

Qin Yu raised his head and looked up. Then, he pointed up and said, “If I want to go to the highest level, what conditions do I need?”

When Su Song heard this, he could not help but laugh out loud, “Want to go to the highest level? That’s simple. As long as you can refine a divine rank pill, that’s enough.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Are you serious?”Qin Yu’s brows raised, and he was immediately somewhat moved.

Su Song said indifferently, “Of course. It’s just that a divine rank pill isn’t that easy to refine.”

Qin Yu sneered, “You can make the decision, right? Do you need to seek instructions from your pill refining King?”

Su Song’s expression turned cold. He said somewhat unhappily, “There’s no need to seek instructions from the pill refining king for such a small matter.”

“Then don’t talk nonsense. You Don’t need to give me a test question. I’ll choose a divine rank pill myself,”Qin Yu said.

Su Song couldn’t help but laugh when he heard this. “Divine Rank Pill? Do you think there are cabbages on the streets for divine rank pills? You want to refine a divine rank pill with just you? You’re simply...”

Su Song’s expression changed drastically before he could finish speaking!

A purple flame was dancing in Qin Yu’s palm!

Although the flame wasn’t big, it was like an elf, flickering with a mysterious radiance!

“Purple... purple spiritual fire? !”Su Song’s eyes widened!

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that there wasn’t a single purple spiritual fire in the entire alchemist Sage City!

Even an alchemist King only had a blue spirit fire, two levels lower than Qin Yu!

“I’ve remembered what you said just now,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

“Alright, I’ll write a prescription now. Send me the medicine.”Qin Yu picked up the pen and wrote a few lines, then handed it to Su Song.

Su Song took the prescription shakily. For a moment, he didn’t know what to say.

“What are you still standing there for? Hurry up and bring me the medicine.”Qin Yu berated.

Only then did su song come back to his senses. He hurriedly turned around and left the room, heading straight for the roof.

All the way to the top floor, Su Song quickly found the Alchemy King.

“Alchemy King, that... that Qin Yu, he...”due to shock, Su Song couldn’t speak for a moment.

Pill king frowned and asked, “What About Qin Yu?”

Su Song swallowed his saliva and said, “Qin Yu, he... he’s actually a purple-colored spiritual fire...”

“Oh... What? !”Pill King’s expression suddenly changed, “Qin Yu is a purple-colored spiritual fire? !”

“Yes...”Su Song nodded.

“Are you sure? Who Did you hear it from?”Pill King hurriedly asked.

Su Song said with a trembling voice, “I saw it with my own eyes... he is indeed a purple-colored spiritual fire...”

This caused the alchemist king to feel extremely uneasy. He kept pacing back and forth in the room, his face carrying some fear.

“No, we absolutely can not let this Qin Yu enter the medicine Saint Hall!”The alchemist King said coldly.
