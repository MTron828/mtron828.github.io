Chapter 1654: Chapter 1654, eternal limit, don’t embarrass yourself! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This seemed to be a show of strength from the Lord of the northern lands to Qin Yu! It also seemed to be another demonstration of the loyalty of the northern lands cultivators to him!

Wave after wave of black-robed men rushed towards Qin Yu. There was a hint of panic in their eyes. They were shockingly ready to die!

An extremely tall black-robed man held a fist that was like a hammer. From top to bottom, he ruthlessly smashed it towards Qin Yu’s head!

Qin Yu stared straight ahead as he punched out with his right fist, instantly destroying his body!

“Scram!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly let out a loud roar!

The thunderous roar contained an extremely powerful and terrifying power, as though it wanted to shatter this entire space!

These black-robed men seemed to be unable to withstand this power and retreated one after another!

When everyone saw this, they were all shocked!

These black-robed men were carefully selected by elementalists. Each of them was a veteran who could sweep across the southern region with their strength!

However, such an existence was like a chicken or a dog in front of Qin Yu, unable to withstand a single blow!

Everyone knew that Qin Yu’s growth was no longer limited. He was already able to take charge of everything!

The elementalist not far away looked at Qin Yu coldly. The expression on his face was extremely strange and unpredictable.

Qin Yu walked up from the foot of the mountain step by step. He forcefully fought his way out. The blood of the northern land cultivators had already dyed this small path red!

Many of the southern province’s cultivators were very unsettled. Those who had once slandered Qin Yu felt even more terrified in their hearts.

The current Qin Yu was like a god of war. He was unstoppable and even made people unable to think of fighting him!

Very soon, Qin Yu walked up with heavy steps!

Even though the northern lands tried to stop him, they were still unable to stop him!

“Elementalist, we’ve finally met!”

Qin Yu looked straight at the northern lands lord and shouted!

The elementalist sized up Qin Yu and said coldly, “You really dare to fight me!”

“I’m not here to fight, I’m here to kill you!”Qin Yu shouted loudly!

His voice and demeanor were mesmerizing!

The elementalist narrowed his eyes and said with a sneer, “You yellow-mouthed brat, you really don’t know the immensity of Heaven and earth. Do you think you can suppress me with just your strength? What a joke!”

Before he could finish his words, another aura approached from outside!

It was the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect!

The One walking at the front was surprisingly the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, Xiao Sheng!

At this moment, everyone stood up. When they saw Xiao Sheng’s figure, their faces were filled with shock!

Xiao Sheng, he actually came as well!

Could it be that Xiao Sheng was going to make a move today? !

“He is the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect,”someone beside reminded the elementalist.

The elementalist’s gaze immediately shifted from Qin Yu to Xiao Sheng.

Looking at this face that was almost identical to Xiao Hai’s, many people in the arena could not remain calm.

They could not even tell if the man in front of them was Xiao Sheng or the deceased Xiao Hai!

“So there’s someone backing me up. Looks like the person who is going to fight me today is not Qin Yu, but someone else,”the elementalist said coldly.

Apart from the elementalists, no one on the field did not seem to be afraid of Xiao Sheng!

They stepped back one after another, not daring to say a word.

The crowd could not help but feel a little nervous. They looked at Xiao Sheng as if they were waiting for his answer.

“Don’t misunderstand. I am only here to watch the battle.”Finally, Xiao Sheng spoke.

Upon hearing his answer, everyone in the southern region immediately felt extremely disappointed!

At this moment, Xiao Sheng still did not make a move!

“Hahahahaha!”

The elementalist laughed loudly.

He pointed his finger in the air and shouted, “Xiao Sheng, don’t you dare to Fight Me!”

“Qin Yu is enough to deal with you,”Xiao Sheng replied indifferently.

His words shocked everyone!

Was Xiao Sheng looking down on the elementalist or did he approve of Qin Yu? Perhaps he meant both?

“Even the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect said so. From the looks of it, Qin Yu has really grown to a terrifying level,”someone lamented.

The elementalist sneered and slowly sat down. Then, he said indifferently, “Wang should fight with Wang. Why do we need to fight against a Junior?”

With that, the elementalist pointed at Yongji.

“Yongji, kill him,”the elementalist said indifferently.

Yongji’s expression was a little unnatural. Qin Yu’s terrifying combat strength just now made him feel a little afraid. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, in front of so many people, he naturally did not want to lose face.

Therefore, Yongji took a step forward, looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, I don’t need the master to deal with you. I’m Enough!”

Qin Yu looked at Yong Ji coldly and said sarcastically, “Yong Ji, you really are born to be a dog. It’s a pity that I’m here to kill Elementalists today, not you.”

“Impudent!”

Yong Ji roared. He seemed to want to show off in front of the elementalists and immediately stepped forward!

His hand emitted a blazing radiance that almost shook the sky and earth. The terrifying power of the sofa made everyone feel a great pressure!

Yong Ji raised his hand and used his trump card, the three elemental sacred palm!

The earth trembled as a terrifying aura spread out. That powerful internal Qi surged over as if it wanted to pierce through everything!

Facing Yong Ji’s attack, Qin Yu immediately let out a roar and swung out his right fist!

A golden radiance erupted over. His extremely powerful physical strength displayed his incomparable battle prowess at this moment!

“Boom!”

Fists collided with palms. The instant they collided, Yingning Mountain was almost destroyed!

A powerful airwave drowned everything and swept outwards!

Fortunately, Qu Zhu and the others acted at this moment and protected everyone!

Meanwhile, Yongji, who was shooting towards Qin Yu, was now shooting behind him!

His palm was pierced through and was dripping with blood. All of his spells were not worth mentioning in front of Qin Yu’s invincible belief!

Yongji was sent flying! If not for the elementalist who stabilized his body, he would have been sent flying out of Yingning Mountain!

“Damn it...”Yongji looked at his bloody right palm and could not help but clench his teeth. His expression was extremely ferocious.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely calm. He was like the ruler of the world, ruling the world!

That indifferent gaze seemed to despise everything. It made Yongji feel extremely uncomfortable.

“You are no longer worthy of my attack. Of course, if you want to send yourself to death, I don’t mind sending you off first,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Although his voice was soft, it was full of vigor, entering everyone’s ears!

Being publicly humiliated, Yongji’s face instantly became even more ferocious!

“Yongji, you are no longer Qin Yu’s match, don’t embarrass yourself!”

“A piece of trash. No wonder you escaped to the northern lands!”

“Even if you have learned the secret technique of the northern lands, you are still a piece of trash. You are not worth mentioning in front of Qin Yu!”

The cultivators of the southern region cursed loudly. They were so excited that even the blood in their bodies was boiling!

“Trash.”At this moment, the elementalist also spoke coldly and spat out two words.

Yongji’s face was hideous and terrifying. His entire body trembled and he was extremely angry.
