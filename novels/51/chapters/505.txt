Gu Canghai laughed coldly. As a Martial Marquis, he had absolute confidence in himself.

“Boom!”

The two palms collided, immediately triggering bursts of light!

Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hands to protect the surrounding pharmacists!

This was a clash between Martial Marquises, and the power was unimaginable!

“How is this possible?!”

After feeling the power from the Pavilion Master’s body, Gu Canghai’s expression changed greatly!

He retreated dozens of steps, and his palm felt waves of pain!

Gu Canghai’s expression was extremely unsightly, and a trace of uneasiness rose from the bottom of his heart.

“You... You’ve stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm?” Gu Canghai stared fixedly at the Pavilion Master.

The Pavilion Master said indifferently, “What do you think?”

“You!” Gu Canghai was so angry that he almost vomited blood!

He never imagined that Ji Yuhong, who was imprisoned in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association a few days ago, had actually stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm!

“Do you want to relive the past?” The Pavilion Master took a step forward, and a fierce internal qi suddenly burst forth!

With the Pavilion Master’s feet as the center, streaks of purple light began to linger around.

At the sight of this purple light, Gu Canghai felt dejected, and a trace of fear flashed through his eyes, as if he had remembered something terrifying!

“No, I absolutely have no such intention!” Gu Canghai hurriedly shouted!

This response shocked everyone!

Did Gu Canghai admit defeat?

As the sect master of the Saint Confucian Sect, he actually admitted defeat so straightforwardly?!

“Ji Yuhong, I don’t want to be your enemy!” Gu Canghai, not even daring to look at the Pavilion Master, turned his face to the side.

The Pavilion Master said, “You couldn’t do it back then, and now, you can’t do it either.”

Gu Canghai’s expression was ugly, but he didn’t dare to say a word.

Qin Yu, who was at the side, didn’t say anything.

He rubbed his chin and thought to himself, ‘It seems that there really is history between the two of them...’

As the Pavilion Master retracted her internal qi, Gu Canghai’s expression also eased up quite a bit.

“Qin Yu.” At this moment, the Pavilion Master suddenly looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu hurriedly walked over and said, “Pavilion Master.”

“What demands do you have? Raise them yourself,” said the Pavilion Master indifferently.

Qin Yu immediately nodded. He took a step forward, then pointed at Elder Qu and He Teng.

“Gu Canghai, I won’t go back on my words like you. I only want Elder Qu and He Teng,” said Qin Yu coldly.

Elder Qu’s expression suddenly changed!

He hurriedly grabbed Gu Canghai and said anxiously, “Sect master, no... You can’t agree. You absolutely can’t agree!”

Gu Canghai’s expression was gloomy. He didn’t say a word. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Sect master!” Elder Qu grabbed Gu Canghai’s arm tightly. His eyes were filled with fear and pleading.

Gu Canghai looked at Elder Qu and slowly lamented, “This is fate...”

Elder Qu’s eyes widened! He suddenly realized that something was wrong!

He Teng’s expression was also unsightly. At this moment, both of them wanted to escape.

“Qin Yu, I’ll leave these two to you,” Gu Canghai said coldly.

“But let me tell you, I’m not the only one who wants to kill you. The Han family, the Yan family, and even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association are all your enemies! Even if you have heaven-defying abilities, you won’t be able to escape your fate in the end!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Then I won’t trouble you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s large hand moved, and a powerful force grabbed Elder Qu and He Teng!

“Sect... Sect master!” Elder Qu shouted with all his might, but Gu Canghai didn’t say anything. He turned around and left.

“Gu Canghai! You f * cking Beast!” Elder Qu was flustered and cursed!

However, Gu Canghai had already turned around and left. There was no trace of him.

Elder Qu and He Teng’s expressions were somewhat unsightly. Now that they had fallen into Qin Yu’s hands, they had no chance of escaping at all.

“Qin Yu, don’t kill me. I... I’m a half-step Martial Marquis. I can help you!” Elder Qu gritted his teeth and said with a pleading expression.

Qin Yu looked at Elder Qu coldly and said, “Do you think I need you?”

Elder Qu hurriedly said, “Qin Yu, as long as you don’t kill me, I’m willing to be your slave! You are magnanimous, please spare my life...”

“Spare you? When you chased after me back then, did you think of sparing my life? When you were about to lay hands on the Pavilion Master back then, did you think of stopping?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Now, you want me to spare you? Do you think that’s possible?!”

With an explosive shout, the qi energy on Qin Yu’s body suddenly erupted!

When he sensed the incomparably strong murderous internal qi on Qin Yu’s body, Elder Qu’s expression became increasingly unsightly.

He knew that it was almost impossible for Qin Yu to spare him.

Thus, Elder Qu gritted his teeth. His palm transformed into a claw and suddenly clawed towards Qin Yu’s chest!

“Go to h*ll!” Elder Qu shouted angrily!

The energy in his hand burst out. All the inner strength gathered at one point, and a terrifying power instantly erupted!

“Qin Yu!” The Fifth Elder’s expression turned pale with fright when he saw this!

“Pa!”

However, Qin Yu only waved his hand and shattered Elder Qu’s palm!

His palm turned into a pile of meat paste, and all the light disappeared without a trace at this moment.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold as he looked at Elder Qu.

“How could this be...” Elder Qu was terrified! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

They were both half-step Martial Marquises, but the gap between their strength was so big?

“Qin Yu, I...”

“You can go to h*ll.” Qin Yu interrupted Elder Qu’s words.

He waved his hand, and the Heaven Swallowing Technique instantly appeared as he slapped Elder Qu’s head!

“Buzz!”

Streams of inner strength flowed through Elder Qu’s head and into Qin Yu’s body.

Painful wails spread throughout the entire Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

In just a moment, the high and mighty Elder Qu had turned into a dried corpse.

Qin Yu’s expression was impassive, as if he had stepped on an ant

Then, Qin Yu looked at He Teng coldly.

“It’s your turn,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Compared to Elder Qu, He Teng was much calmer.

He looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “I won’t wait for death.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “He Teng, I remember that I once told you that if I stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm, I would kill you within three seconds.”

“How long do you think you can last?”
