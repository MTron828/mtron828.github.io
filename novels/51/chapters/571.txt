Chapter 572: One Against Six! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The structure of the entire Jingdu Martial Arts Association was extremely complex. It was very different from what he had imagined. On the contrary, it seemed gloomy.

The first thing that came into view was a long corridor, followed by a large hall.

There were several rooms on both sides, and each room was marked with a position.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association, which had always been peaceful, had an uninvited guest today.

Qin Yu released his internal qi in an attempt to find Yan Ruoxue’s figure.

However, just as he released his internal qi, his expression became somewhat unsightly.

In the depths of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, waves of intense internal qi were pressing over!

These internal qi were extremely chaotic. There were at least several hundred of them!

Among them were peak Inner Strength Grandmasters, half-step Martial Marquises, Martial Marquises, and even more powerful experts!

With such a chaotic mixture of internal qi, it was impossible for Qin Yu to find an ordinary person like Yan Ruoxue!

“Rumble!”

At this moment, several figures instantly appeared in front of him!

These people wore white robes, and their extremely powerful internal qi surged!

Their white robes even indicated their identities!

“Who dared to forcefully barge into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?” A voice came from deep within.

Then, a figure slowly walked over.

The moment this person appeared, everyone hurriedly made way for him and shouted in unison, “President Xia.”

The person who came was none other than Xia Hang!

He strode in front of everyone. Just as he was about to speak, his expression changed slightly.

“Qin Yu?” Xia Hang frowned and then sneered. “Are you crazy? You came to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to kill people? Do you really think you are invincible?”

The moment he saw Xia Hang, the murderous internal qi on Qin Yu’s body couldn’t be suppressed!

The murderous internal qi on his body exploded, and the temperature of the entire room suddenly dropped!

Feeling this strong murderous internal qi, everyone couldn’t help but shiver.

Even Xia Hang’s expression changed!

“Xia Hang... The Jingdu Martial Arts Association actually dared to imprison Yan Ruoxue...” Qin Yu’s entire body was trembling with anger, and his eyes were bloodshot. The terrifying internal qi made them dare not to take even half a step forward!

Xia Hang’s expression instantly changed drastically!

He shouted loudly, “What nonsense are you spouting?! Who dares to imprison the Yan family’s daughter and beat her up?!”

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu roared angrily. This terrifying penetrating force instantly shook the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to the point of buzzing!

The half-step Martial Marquises and Inner Strength Grandmasters present were shaken until they vomited blood!

Even Xia Hang felt a strong sense of oppression!

“Qin Yu, who spouted nonsense to you?!” Xia Hang suppressed the shock in his heart and tried his best to remain calm.

“I’m not in the mood to listen to your nonsense.” Qin Yu walked towards Xia Hang step by step.

“If you don’t hand her over today, I’ll kill all of you!”

Xia Hang subconsciously took two steps back and then said angrily, “Qin Yu! See where this is! This is the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. It’s not somewhere you can do whatever you want to do!”

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu was furious. Golden light burst out from his hand, and he suddenly threw a punch at Xia Hang!

The terrifying fist force sent everyone flying, and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was even vibrating!

This punch was so terrifying that it almost crushed the place!

Faced with this punch, Xia Hang’s expression changed drastically!

Even though he had also stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm recently, he couldn’t even muster the slightest bit of fighting spirit when facing Qin Yu!

When he saw this punch approaching, Xia Hang’s expression became even uglier!

“Buzz!”

Right at this moment, a large hand suddenly stretched out from the darkness!

This large hand carried rolling inner strength as it collided with Qin Yu’s fist!

“Boom!”

A huge boom instantly exploded. The terrifying qi force forced everyone back!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold as he coldly looked towards the depths of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Young people nowadays really don’t have any sense of respect.” A voice came from the depths.

“That’s right. A mere Martial Marquis dares to come to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to find trouble?” Another voice came out.

“How many years has it been since someone dared to be so arrogant?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Who are you? Get out here. Don’t be a coward!”

Before he finished his sentence, six people walked out from the dark!

These six people were also wearing white robes, but there was no word on their white robes.

These six people were all in the Martial Marquis Realm!

“President Xia, who is this guy? How dare he come to Jingdu Martial Arts Association to cause trouble?” Someone said indifferently.

Xia Hang glanced at him and said coldly, “He is Qin Yu. I order you guys to arrest him immediately!”

The six of them smiled and said, “President Xia, don’t worry. Even if you hadn’t said so, we won’t let him go either.”

As they spoke, the internal qi of the six Martial Marquises slowly spread out.

These six people weren’t ordinary Martial Marquises. Their strength were all above the third-level of the Martial Marquis Realm!

Qin Yu was only a first-level Martial Marquis. Naturally, they wouldn’t take Qin Yu seriously.

“Do you want to obediently follow us into the prison, or do you want us to cripple you and throw you in?” One of them said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu coldly glanced at the six of them and immediately took a step forward. Golden light instantly erupted!

“There’s just six Martial Marquises. Bring it on. I, Qin Yu, have nothing to fear!” Qin Yu’s hair flapped wildly in the wind as he looked at them with disdain!

“Hmph, you don’t know your place.” One of them snorted coldly. His figure suddenly disappeared before he threw a punch at Qin Yu!

“Ah!!”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar. His powerful golden fist smashed down with a bang!

“Boom!”

Everyone saw golden light rise in all directions, and killing intent pervaded the air!

And in the next second, everyone saw a figure being sent flying!

His entire body was covered in blood, and his flesh was shattered. His fist was smashed!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s internal qi was surging, his fighting spirit was overflowing, and he looked invincible!

When they saw this scene, everyone’s facial expression couldn’t help but change. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xia Hang was shocked!

Qin Yu’s strength was beyond his imagination!

He had just entered the Martial Marquis Realm, but he already had such terrifying fighting strength. His future potential was unimaginable!

The things he was most afraid of were happening one by one!

Qin Yu roared angrily, “Bring it on. I will kill whoever dares to stop me today!”

His loud roar was deafening and domineering!

The six people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association finally felt a sense of solemnity.

“No wonder he dared to forcefully barge into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. He has quite some ability,” one of them said coldly.

“Third Brother, are you alright?” They helped up a Martial Marquis who was sent flying by Qin Yu.

“I’m... I’m fine.” Third Brother wiped the blood stains and shook his head with difficulty.

“Xia Hang, what’s the background of this person? How can a first level Martial Marquis have such combat strength?” Third Brother looked at Xia Hang.

Xia Hang glanced at him and snorted. “Even the higher-ups have noticed him. What do you think?”

“If you can take down Qin Yu today, the higher-ups will definitely reward you.”
