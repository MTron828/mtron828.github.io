Chapter 1287: Chapter 1,287, conspiring in cahoots 

Zhong Wu hurriedly nodded. “No Problem! By the way, Young Master Ling, what benefits do I get after this matter is settled?”

Hearing this, Ling Yun’s expression turned cold again, but it was fleeting.

What he hated the most was people chasing after him for rewards.

In Ling Yun’s heart, as long as he could give, no one else could take it. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be called a reward.

If it were any other time, Ling Yun would definitely kill Zhong Wu. However, he still needed him now. Thus, he nodded and said, “Of course. Whatever you want, just name it.”

Zhong Wu was overjoyed. He quickly said, “It’s enough that you can make me the city Lord!”

“Okay, no problem.”Ling Yun nodded in agreement.

The tianyun sect controlled countless small countries. Many City lords were directly controlled by the Tianyun sect.

Therefore, it wasn’t difficult for them to appoint a city lord.

Zhong Wu didn’t waste any time and immediately rushed back.

At this time, no one knew about the transaction between Zhong Wu and Ling Yun.

The next day.

Jin Lun, who was severely injured, couldn’t enter Qingyan Forest to hunt for a few days.

These few days, his followers accompanied him to play chess, play cards, and chat.

At this moment, Zhong Wu pushed open the door and entered. He sat down next to Jin Lun.

A two-faced person like Zhong Wu had long established a relationship with Jin Lun. Therefore, Zhong Wu’s arrival did not surprise Jin Lun. He only raised his head to look at him.

“Zhong Wu, you’re here,”Jin Lun said as he pondered over the chessboard.

The person next to him said sarcastically, “Zhong Wu, haven’t you been getting close to that Qin Yu recently? Why did you come to Our Place?”

Zhong Wu waved his hand and said, “Who’s close to him? I’ve long disliked that Kid.”

“You’re scared because he offended the heavenly cloud sect, right?”

The people in the room immediately burst into laughter.

Zhong Wu wasn’t angry because he knew that as long as Jin Lun didn’t say anything, these people couldn’t do anything to him.

“Brother Jin Lun, how are you feeling? Are You Okay?”Zhong wu asked hypocritically.

While playing chess, Jin Lun said indifferently, “I’m okay. I Won’t die.”

Since he had already said the pleasantries, it was time to get down to business.

He leaned against Jin Lun’s ear and whispered, “Brother Jin Lun, I want to discuss something with you.”

“What is it? Tell me,”Jin Lun said casually.

Zhong Wu didn’t say anything but looked at the other people in the room.

Jin Lun didn’t even raise his head and said indifferently, “They are all on the same side. If you have something to say, just say it.”

Zhong wu smiled embarrassedly and said, “This matter is of great importance. It’s better for you and I to discuss it in private.”

Jin Lun frowned slightly. He thought for a moment, then put down the flag in his hand and said, “You guys go out first.”

“Yes.”Everyone agreed and walked out of the room.

After everyone left, Zhong Wu leaned on the door and carefully looked around.

After making sure that no one was there, Zhong Wu returned to Jin Lun’s side.

He said in a deep voice, “Brother Jin Lun, this matter is very important. It involves the heavenly cloud sect.”

Then, Zhong Wu told Jin Lun his thoughts. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After hearing Zhong Wu’s words, even the arrogant Jin Lun was shocked.

“You Mean... you want me to kill the team leader?”Jin Lun narrowed his eyes and asked.

“Yes.”Zhong wu nodded slightly.

“As long as you kill him, you will be the new team leader! With the help of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, the entire hunter organization will be in your hands!”

At this moment, a hint of hesitation appeared on Jin Lun’s face.

Although he was a ruthless person, he had never thought of getting rid of the team leader.

He looked at Zhong Wu coldly, as if he could not believe that Zhong Wu would have such thoughts.

“Those who achieve great things must be decisive in their killing. Do you want to forever be under the team leader?”Zhong Wu said patiently.

“Furthermore, there’s another Qin Yu Now! If he doesn’t die, will you still be able to catch him as the Hunter King?”

Jin Lun wasn’t an indecisive person, especially when he heard the name Qin Yu. His expression was extremely cold.

“Alright! We’ll do as you say!”Jin Lun said coldly.

However, at this moment, Jin Lun changed the topic and said with a frown, “But the team leader has the bone club. I’m not his match.”

“Hehe, you don’t have to worry about that. I’ll bring you to see Ling Yun tonight. He will think of a way.”Zhong Wu smiled faintly.

Jin Lun looked at Zhong Wu and said, “Okay.”

“Meet me at the East River at 10 pm,”Zhong Wu said in a deep voice.

The two of them hit it off and prepared to get rid of the team leader.

At this moment, the team leader didn’t know what the two of them were up to. He was sitting in Qin Yu’s room and said, “Don’t leave the hunter organization during this period of time. Once you leave, he will definitely make a move on you.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Team leader, I understand. Thank you for your trouble.”

The team leader waved his hand and turned around to leave.

After all, this disaster was caused by Qin Yu, so it had to be resolved by Qin Yu.

If this continued, it wouldn’t be a solution.

He lowered his head to look at his injuries and said coldly, “When my injuries recover, I want to experience Ling Yun’s abilities.”

No one had expected that Jin Lun and Zhong Wu would be so confident and ruthless.

The hunter organization had always been extremely united. This was also the reason why other sects were unable to infiltrate the hunter organization.

However, the judgment of these two people would definitely bring about a change in the structure of the hunter organization.

At night.

Jin Lun followed the agreement and arrived at the East River.

Under Zhong Wu’s lead, they arrived in front of Ling Yun.

“Young Master Ling, this is Jin Lun,”Zhong Wu introduced.

Ling Yun glanced at Jin Lun and exclaimed, “What a huge body.”

Jin Lun wasn’t like Zhong Wu. He looked at Ling Yun coldly and said, “Tell me how to get rid of the team leader.”

Hearing this, Ling Yun frowned slightly.

This Jin Lun didn’t seem to be as easy to control as Zhong Wu.

However, there weren’t many people that he could use at the moment, so he could only rely on Jin Lun.

Ling Yun flipped his palm and a packet of medicine appeared in his hand.

“Think of a way to make him eat this medicine. As long as he consumes this medicine, he will definitely become weak. Take this opportunity to kill him,”Ling Yun said coldly.
