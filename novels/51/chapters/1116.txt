Chapter 1117: Chapter 1117, desolate God’s eye! 

After the trip to Cloud Dragon Island, Qin Yu could basically confirm one thing.

It was that the seawater could almost seal the internal QI.

There was so much spiritual Qi under the sea, but it did not flow out at all. This was enough to explain the problem.

“The seabed might be the best place for seclusion,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He locked his gaze on the Clear Bay Sea. This place had a huge sea area, but it was not a scenic spot. It just happened to meet Qin Yu’s requirements.

That day, Qin Yu took a taxi and headed straight for the Clear Bay Sea.

When he arrived near the shore, Qin Yu scanned his surroundings.

“This place is desolate and uninhabited. No one would think that I’m hiding under the sea,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He took a deep leap and walked towards the surface of the sea.

At this moment, a figure burst out from this place!

A steel knife pierced through Qin Yu’s chin from top to bottom!

Qin Yu’s face turned cold. Golden Light burst out from his body and shattered the steel knife into pieces!

“Who is it?”Qin Yu said coldly.

A young man burst out from under the sea.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “I wanted to ask you who told you to come here!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “This place is ownerless. Why Can’t I Come Here?”

“Cut the crap. My master is in seclusion here. Leave immediately!”The young man shouted.

“In seclusion here?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Wasn’t this F * cking bullshit? Besides Qin Yu, who would choose to enter seclusion under the sea?

He looked coldly at the youth in front of him and said, “Could it be that there are treasures hidden under the sea?”

The youth’s expression immediately changed! His body emitted an icy chill!

“You really came for the desolate divine eye!”The youth said coldly.

“Kid, let me tell you. The desolate divine eye belongs to my master. If you don’t want to die, get lost immediately!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

Desolate God’s Eye? He did not expect that there would be unexpected gains.

“I told you to get lost. Don’t you understand?”The killing intent on the youth’s body grew stronger.

Qin Yu could not help but sneer, “You guys are really overbearing. Is this your home? If you tell me to leave, do I have to leave?”

“You are courting death!”

The youth shouted loudly. The steel knife in his hand condensed once again and headed straight for Qin Yu’s face! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. He immediately waved his hand and instantly shattered the steel blade in the youth’s hand! The remaining power slammed onto his body and directly shattered his sternum!

The youth’s expression was horrified. He tried to get up, but the pain in his chest made it impossible for him to stand up!

“I originally didn’t want to snatch your desolate divine eye, but I’ve changed my mind now.”Qin Yu extended his palm and a terrifying force grabbed the youth across space.

“Tell your master to come out, or I’ll kill you,”Qin Yu said coldly

The youth’s face was filled with fear. He struggled with all his might, but he realized that he could not break free!

“Your excellency has such big words.”

At this moment, an old man emerged from under the sea.

He had his hands behind his back, looking like an immortal. He had the demeanor of an expert.

Although he walked out from the bottom of the sea, there was not a single drop of water on his body.

Qin Yu threw the young man to the side and then said coldly, “Where is the desolate divine eye? Hand it over and I’ll spare your life.”

The old man laughed loudly and said, “You want the desolate divine eye? Are You Worthy! ?”

After he finished speaking, the martial saint’s internal Qi on his body instantly erupted!

Qin Yu did not have the time to waste with him. He immediately condensed a golden palm and slammed it down fiercely!

The elder roared furiously and raised his hand to meet the attack.

However, this golden palm was too terrifying. The spell in the elder’s hand instantly melted and his body was slammed onto the surface of the water!

Qin Yu extended his palm and the huge palm grabbed him once again. The huge force almost crushed his body!

The elder said in fear, “Senior, please show mercy. I am willing to tell you about the desolate divine eye!”

Qin Yu snorted coldly and threw the old man on the ground. Then, he said coldly, “Tell me everything about the desolate divine eye, or I will kill you.”

The old man got up from the ground and knelt on the ground as he said in horror, “The desolate divine eye is under the sea. I only learned about it by chance.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and continued, “What is this desolate divine eye? What is its use?”

“Senior, aren’t you here for the desolate God’s Eye?”The Elder was stunned as a hint of awkwardness flashed in his eyes.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know anything about the desolate God’s eye.”

The elder immediately complained in his heart and could not help but glare at the youth.

If it was not for his disciple, he would not have given the desolate God’s eye away.

But now, he had no other choice but to tell Qin Yu everything about the desolate God’s eye.

“The desolate God’s eye is an ancient inheritance item. It is said to be the eye of an ancient god. Those who obtain the desolate God’s eye can see through all concealment spells in the world. They can even use the desolate God’s eye to peer into the Great Dao and sense the secret treasures hidden between heaven and earth...”. “...”the old man slowly said.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said in surprise, “The eye of an ancient god? It can peer into the Great Dao and secret treasures? is what you said true?”

“The rumors are true, but I don’t know if it’s true or not.”The old man said in a trembling voice.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Then where is the desolate God’s Eye?”

“It’s under the seawater. From here, we can see the desolate God’s eye’s location from about eight thousand meters down.”The old man hurriedly said.

When Qin Yu heard this, he couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows and said, “Since you know the desolate God’s Eye’s location, why didn’t you take it for yourself?”

The elder smiled bitterly and said, “The pressure under the sea is immense. Even if I use a secret technique, I would not be able to withstand it. If I were to forcefully take the desolate divine eye, I’m afraid that I would be crushed into meat paste.”

“I wanted to leave temporarily to search for a protective dharma treasure, but I did not expect to meet Senior...”
