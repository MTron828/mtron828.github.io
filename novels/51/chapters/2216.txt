2217 Evil Extermination Strikes

The person who attacked him should also be soul-cultivating, causing his recovered divine sense to be damaged again.

Qin Yu did not expect Zong Yue to sacrifice two True Saint Realm subordinates to kill him the first time they met.

A True Saint Realm top-notch martial artist! What was this Blood Sect? Even a True Saint’s emergence would cause a commotion in the Holy Region. Qin Yu did not expect this either. As expected, there would be loopholes where there were rules.

If he had not escaped so quickly when he saw something wrong, he would probably have had to use the spiritual energy in his body if another person had appeared.

At that time, he would have been killed.

“Hahaha, those old fellows bragged so much. Isn’t he just a trash of the third-grade True Saint? The more you want to take him into the sect, the more I don’t want to. The heaven’s favorite can only be mine.”

Zong Yue stretched lazily.

“Divine sense being damaged is like trash. It’s difficult for him to pass the fifth-grade True Saint to comprehend the power of rules. However, his physical body and cultivation techniques were top-notch. Perhaps the elders want to find out his secrets.”

The old man said in a low voice.

Qin Yu’s battle on the Black Platform Continent had already attracted the attention of many factions, including the Blood Sect, one of the largest factions in this galaxy.

A bone-piercing pain suddenly entered Qin Yu’s mind, and his expression changed drastically.

The after-effects of the netherworld cultivation technique attacked again. This time, even the Pure Heart Sutra could not suppress it.

The people walking on the streets were like top-grade food in Qin Yu’s eyes. He could not help but want to attack them.

Qin Yu no longer hesitated and quickly ran out of Solitary Cloud City.

“Sir, please wait. I have something to consult you.”

A few figures followed stealthily.

Outside Solitary Cloud City, a group of people had always been killing and robbing. When they saw Qin Yu alone, they naturally followed him.

“Do it. This Demonic Beast is only a second-grade True Saint.”

“Obediently surrender the treasures you have, and I can give you a quick death.”

Another person blocked Qin Yu.

Suddenly, the demonic qi around Qin Yu dissipated.

A blood-red pupil appeared before them. The leader felt his hair stand on end.

“Crack!”

Qin Yu directly crushed the head of the person before him. After that, black gas emerged from Qin Yu’s head and suddenly wrapped around the divine sense of the person before him.

Like eating an apple, the sound of chewing is clear, entering everyone’s ears.

In just a few moments, that divine sense was completely devoured by Qin Yu’s divine sense.

He turned his head and glanced at the other three cultivators.

“Misunderstanding, Sir. It’s a misunderstanding. We will leave now!”

The other person’s expression changed drastically.

Before he could finish speaking, his voice stopped abruptly.

Qin Yu lifted his neck, and his black divine sense suddenly pierced through the cultivator’s head.

Following that, a ball of divine sense phantom appeared.

“Gulp! Gulp”

Qin Yu swallowed the divine sense in two mouthfuls and turned to look at the other person.

Instantly, several people turned into a state of dementia completely.

Perhaps because the cultivators’ divine sense was too low, Qin Yu’s bloodthirsty desire did not weaken much.

Qin Yu rushed into the depths of purgatory.

Along the way, he killed hundreds of Demonic Beasts like Asura and devoured all their souls.

After he reached the True Saint Realm and circulated the netherworld cultivation technique again, the technique seemed to have improved further.

Qin Yu felt his divine sense’s control to be even stronger. The offensive power of the black divine sense was even more terrifying than the golden figurine.

In just an instant, the divine sense of a few True Saint cultivators was destroyed and devoured completely.

However, that desire was like a shackle that controlled him and made him somewhat panicked. He almost failed to control the desire to devour the soul.

If he continued cultivating this netherworld cultivation technique, would he become a bloodthirsty machine?

Half a day had passed, and it was unknown how many Demonic Beast’s souls he had devoured.

Qin Yu’s eyes gradually regained clarity.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s divine sense had recovered by more than half.

A part of the golden figurine in his divine sea was black and had a ghastly aura.

Furthermore, Qin Yu seemed not to see himself in its eyes.

The black portion of the divine sense seemed to have its own soul.

On the injury of the head of the divine sense, there was a constant power of the way that was destroying his divine sense.

The damage from Xing Xiu’s slash seemed something that even the netherworld cultivation technique could not completely repair.

“I can’t use this netherworld cultivation technique anymore. I can’t control my desires at all for half a day.”

Qin Yu thought to himself.

If the netherworld cultivation technique advanced further, it would probably be even more difficult for him to control.

At this moment, three figures were standing before a few corpses on the outskirts of Solitary Cloud City.

The leader was the young man who had killed the Tiger King earlier.

“Evil cultivation technique and also the messenger from the netherworld. Now, the demon race’s activities are getting increasingly frequent. Even the netherworld is taking action. It’s really getting increasingly restless.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Uncle Ling frowned and said

The young man stared at the corpse, his face expressionless.

“At the first and second levels, a large number of Demonic Beast’s souls were devoured. This person is probably still around.”

Uncle Ling’s tremendous divine sense swept out as he spoke to the youth.

The three entered the depths of purgatory like lightning bolts.

“Release your divine sense or die!”

The young man arrived in front of a team of ten.

“Are you looking for trouble?”

A young man was furious.

“Whoosh!”

The sword instantly pierced through his glabella.

“Evil Extermination Sword, he’s an evil exterminator!”

A terrified voice shouted.

“Spare our lives! We’ll release our divine sense!”

Everyone released their divine sense. Uncle Ling’s powerful divine sense swept across the area as he frowned at the young man.

“It’s not them.”

“There are still people five thousand meters ahead.”

The three of them disappeared instantly.

“F*ck, who has provoked these Asura of the Evil Extermination Sect again?”

A young cultivator wiped away the cold sweat off his face.

“Over the past few years, at least a few thousand demons have died at the hands of the evil exterminator, and most of them were True Saint Realm demon kings. I heard he had returned to the sect to cultivate, and I didn’t expect him to return to purgatory.”

An enormous divine sense swept past, and Qin Yu felt being locked onto by a terrifying divine sense.

The three arrived in an instant.

“It’s you again!”

Ling Yurou asked curiously.

“Release your divine sense, or you will die.”

The evil exterminator stared at Qin Yu indifferently.

“Let go. We don’t have ill intentions. We just want to see if you have anything to do with the evil cultivator just now.”

Ling Yurou shook her head.

“No.”

Before Qin Yu could finish speaking, the sword aura had already arrived before he could draw her sword.

The Saintly Body Technique broke the sword qi with a punch, and Qin Yu caught the Evil Extermination Sword with both palms.

A chill that permeated through his divine sense spread throughout Qin Yu’s entire body. Qin Yu only felt a massive force coming from the sword.

His both hands no longer could hold it. Qin Yu bent his body and narrowly dodged the sword.
