A king-level demonic ape!

The demonic ape smashed to the ground. Its huge body turned into the size of a human.

However, it stood up again in the blink of an eye. This attack did not cause any damage to it.

It stared at Qin Yu and the others before it disappeared.

“This f*cking talisman is a genuine level-12 peak power but it can’t even defeat this demonic ape!”

Although the other party was also a king, Fatty Situ’s face turned pale when he saw this scene.

“They seem to be looking for something! Did something offend them?”

Qin Yu frowned deeply. This demonic ape had left immediately after meeting him.

It didn’t look like it was going to fight to the death with them. This meant that they had a more important mission.

“Boss Qin Yu, I’m afraid we have to avoid this kind of fluctuation. If we encounter a group of kings, we might not be able to deal with them.”

Fatty’s face turned pale.

Before he could finish speaking, a terrifying shock wave came from the side.

It directly sent the two of them flying a few hundred meters. The huge trees it passed by were instantly turned into sawdust.

The entire forest instantly turned into a large open area and densely packed monster race figures appeared there.

Among them were nearly hundreds of humans.

Six of them had awakened their peak power, while the others were all below level 9 Dao Consciousness.

Looking at the number, it was not the people who had entered before.

Instead, they looked like someone who lived in the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

The four kings- demonic ape, bone dragon, dragon elephant, and blood lion had surrounded them.

The four powerful peak powers combined into one. That terrifying internal qi even suppressed the team of nearly thirteen humans.

“My peak power has been suppressed! It can only be extended to about one meter. The four kings have terrifying strength!”

A man holding a gigantic ax shouted.

“I’m also being suppressed!”

Another woman spoke with a solemn expression.

“Taoist Priest Lan Ze, you’ll be in charge!”

The man felt his heart beating faster and faster. He was at the front and was under great pressure. At this moment, he felt suffocated.

They had been living in this place all this time. After today’s Heaven Ritual, they had sensed that the spatial storm had dissipated.

Thus, they formed a team and wanted to leave this place together. However, they did not expect to encounter such a change short after they set off.

Almost everyone had an extremely terrified expression now.

Other than these four kings, there were nearly a hundred beasts.

“Form formations to face the enemy. Ju Shan, Qing Han, Shen Yu, and I will deal with the four kings. Yu Zhe and Yu Xuan, you two brothers will guard our rear and be ready to support us anytime. The others will form a formation and fight against the demonic beasts below the king level.”

After the old Taoist Priest had spoken, the demonic beast charged at them.

“Kill!”

Ju Shan’s expression was ferocious. The muscles between his hands swelled up.

Streaks of black lightning exploded around his arms. The axe in his hand slashed at the demonic ape with a mountain-splitting force.

“You’re courting death.”

The white-haired demonic ape transformed into a human. When it saw the axe coming at it, it allowed it to hit its chest.

How was this possible?

Ju Shan’s eyes widened.

His full-powered axe only left a white mark on the demonic ape’s body!

In the next moment, his head was directly crushed by the demonic ape.

This rapid defeat made it so that Yu Zhe and Yu Xuan, who were behind, did not even have time to support him.

“Block this demonic ape! If it charges in, these people will die!”

Taoist Priest Lan Ze was also shocked by this turn of events.

The two brothers faced the demonic ape at the same time. A terrifying heat wave surged in front of them.

In an instant, the air seemed to be heated to the boiling point.

The scorching heat wave was pushed out as they pushed their palms together.

The fire dragon that was visible to the naked eye directly collided with the demonic ape’s chest!

Roar!VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A black shadow swept over. The ape’s palm swept over and sent the two of them flying simultaneously.

A large black burn appeared on their chest, but the demonic ape did not care at all.

The other few peak power experts also fell into a disadvantage when they exchanged blows.

The humans in the Dao Consciousness and True Consciousness Realms were instantly killed or injured by the demonic beasts.

Four alien races formed the demonic beast team. They were superior to the humans in terms of numbers or strength.

All of a sudden, the demonic ape seemed to have sensed something.

The demonic ape stared in the direction of the human race and sniffed hard. His face immediately revealed a look of ecstasy.

Boom!

A huge iron hoof stomped down. A vortex-like vibration was formed under the iron hoof.

Then, it resonated and the entire space shook violently.

Thousands of vortexes slowly formed.

The dragon elephant let out a muffled roar. A hint of joy also appeared on its face.

With this attack, Taoist Priest Lan Ze was sent flying.

Under the resonance of the iron hooves, the other two peak power human experts were also restrained.

The four kings, including the demonic ape, suddenly rushed toward the group of humans in a frenzy.

The few people who were originally on the defensive did not expect this change at all.

It was already too late to stop it.

“Oh no! Quickly scatter!”

“In your dreams!”

The dragon elephant grunted.

The huge iron hooves stomped down once again. The huge shock wave connected and surrounded the circle of humans.

The few people who got close to the shockwave were instantly torn into pieces by the violent power.

“Da*n it! Break!”

A silver light burst out and a flying sword burst out from a young man.

It then turned into a silver streak of light and struck the shockwave. However, the flying sword was directly shattered by the terrifying power.

He spat out a mouthful of blood. Dao Consciousness’s power could not shake the peak power at all.

“Hahaha! Take them all down!”

The ape’s arm returned to its original form and swept out.

The tremendous force seemed to compress the air. Then, a shrill sonic boom sounded.

Primal Chaos Flame!

Amidst that shrill cry, Qin Yu finally could not endure it anymore.

He unsealed the Primal Chaos Fire. It turned into a wall of fire and stood in front of the four kings.

Howl!

The demonic ape’s face suddenly distorted. Its ape arm accelerated once again and directly smashed into the wall of fire.

The absolute power of the attack suppressed the Primal Chaos Flame for a moment.

Almost at the same time, an iron hoof had already arrived above Qin Yu.

As it stomped, a terrifying shockwave landed on Qin Yu’s body like a meteorite.
