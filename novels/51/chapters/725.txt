Chapter 726: Entering the Immortal Slaying Sect Again Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The man with the mustache sneered. “Qin Yu, think carefully. If she really awakens the masked woman’s memory, she won’t be someone you and I can control.”

These words made Qin Yu fall into deep thought.

The man with the mustache’s cautious attitude couldn’t help but make people worry.

Qin Yu stood there and didn’t speak for a long time.

There was a conflicted look on his face.

The man with the mustache wasn’t in a hurry. He just stood to the side and waited quietly.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu turned to look at the man with the mustache.

“Even if we don’t bring her, she will still awaken that part of her memory, right?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache nodded. “Yes.”

“Then let’s go.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“At least the current Xiao Yu is still under control.”

“Besides, she may not be as terrifying as you think.”

The man with the mustache seemed to have guessed Qin Yu’s decision.

He sneered and said, “Qin Yu, I’ll tell you a story about the masked woman.”

Qin Yu nodded and signaled the man with the mustache to speak.

The man with the mustache said, “According to the information I know, this isn’t the masked woman’s first reincarnation. She will reincarnate every two thousand years or so.”

Qin Yu grunted and waited for the man with the mustache to finish.

The man with the mustache continued, “Every time she reincarnates, she has to come back to this world through her mother’s womb.”

“And her biological parents died at her hands. No one related to her could escape, including her relatives, friends, and even her lover.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He frowned and said, “Why did she kill her parents? And why did she kill her friends?”

The man with the mustache sneered. “Let me give you an example. You are now Xiao Yu’s friend, or even her brother, but you aren’t the masked woman’s friend.”

“To the masked woman, you are just a stranger.”

“Her parents are the same.”

After listening to the man with the mustache’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think of the death of Mr. Wu.

That time, Xiao Yu seemed to have awakened her identity as the masked woman. Her cold eyes were indeed terrifying.

More importantly, in the face of Mr. Wu’s death, Xiao Yu didn’t seem to have any emotional fluctuations.

It was as if the person who died wasn’t her father, but an irrelevant passerby.

“Do you still plan to take her to the Immortal Slaying Sect?” The man with the mustache asked.

These words made Qin Yu a little worried.

If it was really as the man with the mustache said, and Xiao Yu had awakened a part of her memory, then it would be really troublesome.

“Let’s go.” After thinking for a while, Qin Yu finally decided to take Xiao Yu to the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“Even if Xiao Yu has really awakened her memory now, she isn’t my match. If anything happens, I will subdue her.”

“Moreover, she is only a Martial Marquis now. So what if she awakens her memory? At most, there will be one more genius among her peers in the world.”

The man with the mustache knew that he couldn’t dissuade Qin Yu, so he didn’t say anything more. He just nodded and said, “Okay.”

Therefore, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache turned around and returned to their rooms.

They took Xiao Yu and left the Green Moon Villa.

...

After almost a day, Qin Yu and the other two came to the island where the Immortal Slaying Sect was located.

“Qin Yu, you have to think it through carefully.” The man with the mustache warned Qin Yu again before they went to the bottom of the sea.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I have thought it through.”

The man with the mustache didn’t say anything more when he saw this. The three of them immediately swam to the bottom of the island.

The Immortal Slaying Sect was still here, and the number of inner cores under the island had decreased by a lot.

Obviously, those inner cores had been brought back by the people of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Xiao Yu, do you have any impression of this place?” Qin Yu pointed at the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect and asked.

Xiao Yu shook her head and said somewhat dubiously, “Where is this?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and smiled. “A sect.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache took out a well-made array platform from his spatial artifact.

This array platform was a simple and crude spatial teleportation array platform.

On the array platform were densely packed flags. The man with the mustache stood on the array platform and opened his mouth slightly to mutter, as if he was chanting some incantation.

A few minutes later, bubbles suddenly appeared around the array platform! The entire seabed seemed to be boiling!

“Buzz!”

Following a strange light, a circular spatial portal appeared in front of them.

“Let’s go,” the man with the mustache said.

Qin Yu nodded. He held Xiao Yu’s hand and whispered, “Follow me closely.”

Xiao Yu nodded and followed behind Qin Yu, stepping into the teleportation portal.

Because the teleportation portal was located at the side of the Immortal Slaying Sect, it took them a very short time to successfully enter the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“What kind of spell is this? It’s so magical,” Xiao Yu said with some doubt.

Hearing this, the man with the mustache immediately said with a smile, “This is the teleportation portal specially made by me. How is it? Isn’t it amazing?”

Xiao Yu gave the man with the mustache a thumbs up and said, “It’s very amazing.”

“Then you must remember me. Remember my appearance. Don’t kill me in the future,” the man with the mustache muttered.

This made Xiao Yu even more confused. She rolled her eyes and said, “Why would I kill you?”

“He’s an idiot. Ignore him,” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

“Let’s go. I’ll take you to a place.”

Qin Yu held Xiao Yu’s hand and walked towards the tomb.

The man with the mustache followed behind them, but he was far away and was quite vigilant.

After more than ten minutes, the three of them arrived at the entrance of the tomb again.

Ever since Qin Yu took away the coffin, the dark energy in the tomb gradually dissipated.

Although they could still feel traces of coldness, compared to the previous coldness, it was negligible.

“This is the place,” Qin Yu pointed to the tomb and said.

As he spoke, Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and secretly observed her expression. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Unfortunately, there was no special expression on Xiao Yu’s face, only confusion.

“Come, let’s go in and take a look,” Qin Yu said.

“You guys go in. I’ll wait for you here,” the man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with the man with the mustache. He held Xiao Yu’s hand and walked into the tomb.

The moment the two of them stepped into the tomb, a gust of chilly wind suddenly rose from the ground!

That bone-piercing chill swept over again!

Qin Yu frowned slightly and hurriedly looked at Xiao Yu.

He saw that the chilly wind that rose from the ground was approaching Xiao Yu!

A moment later, the chilly wind attached itself to Xiao Yu and formed a tornado around her!

“Xiao Yu?” Qin Yu suddenly felt a little worried and tried to call out.

However, Xiao Yu ignored Qin Yu. In the darkness, he couldn’t see the expression on Xiao Yu’s face.
