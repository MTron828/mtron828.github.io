Qin Yu flicked the Winding Silk Gloves in his hand. His body passed through the two of them.

With a flash of the blade, the heads of the two supervisors flew up.

Warm blood splattered out of the corpse that had fallen to the ground. “You guys can leave. The persons supervising the house outside are already dead. ”

Qin Yu said softly.

However, what surprised him was that these 200 people ignored him.

A few of them trembled as if they were tempted. However, they suddenly thought of something terrifying and began to knock on the mine again. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu sighed. He did not know what kind of torture these people had gone through.

They had already given up all hope. Their greatest hope now was probably to die quickly.

Qin Yu sighed. He picked up the little boy and continued on his way.

Along the way, Qin Yu realized that a contact point would be set at a fixed distance.

Moreover, almost every contact point had become a venting ground for these beasts.

This kind of disorderly place at ten thousand meters underground had magnified human evil almost to the extreme.

When Qin Yu arrived at every place, everyone inside was directly massacred.

These people could no longer be called humans. However, Qin Yu did not notice that the little boy behind him had quietly followed him.

He looked at the bloody scene without any fear. Instead, his terrifyingly calm eyes showed some emotional fluctuations.

At this point, it was abysmal.

Qin Yu did not forget his original intention of coming. He was at the last contact point.

A large amount of copper-gold ore was stored inside. Qin Yu unceremoniously plundered all of it into his Qian Kun bag.

However, his target was the crystal ore. If he could obtain a batch of crystal ores, he would probably save a lot of time in his future cultivation.

There was another contact point ahead!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and began to get impatient.

Just as he stepped into the room, he suddenly felt a sense of danger!

“Oh no, it’s too quiet!”

A slightly curved Dao sword slid down from Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu’s head shrank back in a flash. A cold chill slid down the tip of his nose.

The Dao sword, which looked like a withered branch, slashed into his Milky Way Holy Body.

A force exploded from the Dao sword, about to completely crush Qin Yu’s internal organs.

Boom!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s Milky Way Holy Body seemed to sense danger. The power of all the holy bones burst out. The huge power shook the peach

wood sword away.

The huge airwave shattered the whole house. The silver holy energy was dazzling in the dark mine.

Vast Qi of Milky Way!

Qin Yu stretched out his palm. All his power was released without reservation.

This was the first time he had used this move against an enemy after he had mastered the Milky Way Holy Body.

Qin Yu didn’t feel that the enemy person was very strong, but every move was filled with killing intent that could bring him a real threat.

Qin Yu did not dare to hold back in his attack.

The expression of the person who attacked changed drastically. A yellow paper with red characters suddenly appeared in his hand.

“Please, Sheshen!”

In an instant, the red words glowed brightly.

The red words turned into a blood -like liquid and flowed onto the ground.

In the void, a blurry god statue suddenly took shape.

In an instant, the air was filled with the smell of thick soil.

Almost at the same time, the power of the majestic Milky Way struck the statue directly.

The god statue that seemed to have been formed in a hurry blocked the power outside. The face of the person who ambushed him flushed red.

He straightened his hands, palms facing each other, and his big fingers pressed down on his little fingers.

After two God-summoning seals had been formed, Sheshen’s appearance gradually became clear.

Seeing that the Vast Qi of the Milky Way could not succeed, Qin Yu suddenly pulled the little boy back.

When the dust settled and Qin Yu saw the person opposite him, he could not help but let out a sound.

“It’s you?”

“It’s you?”

The person on the other side also cried out in surprise.

“Why did you come to this mine? Did you kill all these people?” This person was Ruoyao’s senior brother, Xi Ming, whom he had met before entering the cave. Qin Yu had not expected to run into him.

At this moment, his expression was cold and stern. He did not put down the magical sword in his hand.

“How can these beasts be called humans? Calling them devils is already a compliment.”

Qin Yu stared at him coldly and did not deny it.

“Even so, how can you kill tens of thousands of people? Are all of them heinous criminals?”

The killing intent in Xi Ming’s eyes was not concealed at all.

‘What? I only killed twenty-something beasts. Each of them had their way of death. ”

Qin Yu was a little puzzled. He knew that this misunderstanding had blown up.

After some communication, Xi Ming seemed to have understood some key points. He put away the Dao sword.

However, the rune was still in his hand. He did not completely let down his defense.

“Who is this child?”

Xi Ming asked with a frown.

Qin Yu shook his head and directly transmitted a simple explanation of what had happened to him.

“These bast*rds!”

Xi Ming’s face was ashen. He took back the talisman.

“As far as I know, the final share of these mine slaves is also handed over to your major factions. Don’t tell me you don’t know all this.”

Qin Yu sneered.

“These Saint Crystals are indeed important to every faction, especially the Aqua Saint Ore, which is an essential item for cultivation after Dao Realm level 10. These people have been here for a long time, so they will find someone to vent their anger on. Everyone knows this, but I didn’t know it would be so twisted.” Xi Ming’s face was ugly as he spoke with a complicated expression.

They had to rely on these people to supervise and squeeze the mining slaves to the greatest extent, which was directly related to the ore output.

Once these people were strictly monitored, they would not be willing to come to this mine.

Qin Yu saw that Xi Ming did not look like he was lying, so he changed the topic. “You said tens of thousands of people died. What’s going on?”

“It should have been two or three days since we lost contact with nearly 80% of the contact points here. There was even no message sent! There are also quite a few top-notch martial artists here. Furthermore, many Path of Heaven Academy experts entered one after another, but all of them were lost.” Xi Ming’s expression was grim.

Qin Yu’s expression also began to change slightly. Being able to kill so many people meant that the things that appeared here had already exceeded his imagination.

He could not do this even if his strength was doubled.

While the two of them were talking, Xi Ming glanced at Qin Yu’s back. His expression suddenly changed.

He stretched out two fingers and wiped his eyelids before staring at Qin Yu.

“There’s something on your back! Strange! Why can’t my Heavenly Eye see it?”

Xi Ming said with an ugly expression..
