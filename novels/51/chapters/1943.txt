1944 An Obsession

Not to mention Shiyue, he was probably even much more inferior to Si Shiyu.

There was something that Qin Yu couldn’t figure out. Why didn’t Si Shiyue imitate Si Shiyu, forcefully suppress his cultivation realm to the same level as him and make a move?

“Is Si Shiyue also worried he will lose?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After all, Si Shiyu had lost to him. Perhaps this would cause him some fear.

!!

On the other end, Si Shifeng also raised the same doubt.

“Even if you forcefully suppress your cultivation realm to the Early-stage of Reversion Void, he’s still not your match,” Si Shifeng said.

Si Shiyue glanced at Si Shifeng and said, “He’s not worthy of me making a move.”

These words instantly made Si Shifeng feel uncomfortable.

Obviously, Si Shiyue didn’t take Si Shifeng seriously. However, Si Shifeng seemed to have gotten used to it and soon resumed.

“That’s true. How is Qin Yu qualified to fight with the Si family’s Holy Son?” Si Shifeng said with a smile.

Si Shiyue snorted coldly and said, “Even if I give him time, and I’m unable to enter the Semi-Saint cultivation realm, he definitely won’t be able to catch up with me before the day of the Path of Heaven.

“When the time comes, I will kill him,” Si Shiyue said coldly.

Si Shifeng laughed and said, “Brother Yue, I’m afraid you won’t have that chance. I’m going to kill him three days later.”

“Mmm,” Si Shiyue responded, but he looked rather indifferent.

“Don’t let your guard down. After all, even Shiyu had lost to him,” Si Shiyue said.

Si Shifeng laughed, saying, “That’s because Brother Yu forcefully suppressed his cultivation realm. He suppressed his cultivation realm while attacking, so his strength was naturally greatly reduced. Otherwise, Qin Yu wouldn’t have had a chance.”

Si Shiyue didn’t deny this and just nodded.

The temple fair was about to begin, and it was getting more and more lively in the temple. Many experts had come to the scene.

“Look! It’s the Semi-Saint of the older generation, Mi Song. He actually came, too!”

At a glance, they saw an elderly man in a long robe coming with his feet stepping in the void.

“Look over there! Isn’t that Zu Shan who almost entered the True Saint cultivation realm? Are they here to listen to the dao lecture, too?”

Following that, several experts in the Semi-Saint cultivation realm arrived.

Initially, they had no hope of entering the True Saint cultivation realm. However, now that the Great Upheaval and Golden Age had descended, everyone wanted to take this opportunity to advance. These Semi-Saints were no exception.

“The Yao family’s Holy Son, Yao Xi, is also here.”

A young man was walking over.

This young man was tremendously handsome as if he had walked out of a painting!

Although Si Shiyue and the others were also very good-looking, they were dwarfed by the Yao family’s Holy Son.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

The guy was indeed overly handsome. His complexion was even fairer than a woman’s.

“That guy is known as the most handsome man in Holy Region.”

“Tsk! Tsk! Rumor has it that back then, countless people in Holy Region were crazy about him.”

Yao Xi’s arrival attracted countless gazes. Some female cultivators even had their hearts set on him as they looked shyly in Yao Xi’s direction.

“Holy Son Yao is also here,” Si Shifeng walked forward and greeted him.

Yao Xi was a little surprised to see Si Shifeng.

“I didn’t expect Mr. Si to come.” Yao Xi walked over and greeted Si Shiyue.

However, Si Shiyue’s response was rather cold. He seemed not interested in Yao Xi.

One could see that Si Shiyue was extremely arrogant. Regardless of who he faced, he always adopted a condescending manner.

“I wonder if the other aristocratic families will send people over,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He looked around with some anticipation.

Qin Yu was not anticipating anyone else but Yan Ruoxue.

Unfortunately, Yan Ruoxue did not come.

“That’s strange. Why are there only the people from the Si family and the Yao family?” Qin Yu muttered.

The person beside him laughed and said, “You don’t understand this. Si Shiyue and Yao Xi now got stuck on the verge of breaking through to the Semi-Saint cultivation realm. They certainly wouldn’t miss such a dao lecture.”

“So, among the great aristocratic families, only Si Shiyue and Yao Xi are about to enter the Semi-Saint realm?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“More or less,” the man said.

Qin Yu could not help but secretly click his tongue. No wonder this guy was so arrogant.

More and more people had gathered in the temple, and it was very lively.

In the dark, there seemed to be more experts who had not shown up.

Qin Yu released his divine sense, covering the majority of the temple.

“Eh? There are no cultivators of the True Saint cultivation realm!” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“True Saint? Do you f*cking think the True Saints are cabbages on the side of the road? In that cultivation realm, they’re gods in this world. Stepping out of Holy Region with a step is not a problem,” someone beside him laughed and said.

“Is True Saint so powerful?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“Nonsense! Even in the nine great aristocratic families, there are only a few True Saints!” the person beside him berated.

Qin Yu was very shocked. He knew True Saints were powerful, but didn’t expect them to be so precious.

At this moment, the temple suddenly emitted roars of Great Dao.

It was like the sound of a big bell, melodious and graceful, yet extremely majestic.

The temple immediately quieted down, and the peddling noises earlier also stopped.

A moment later, a phantom appeared in the temple.

This person was tall and had a dignified look. Even though it was only a phantom, it was full of a sense of oppression.

“Phantom? The phantom of the Great Xia Royal Family?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“It’s obvious that you came to the temple fair for the first time,” someone beside him laughed and said.

Qin Yu glanced at him, bowed, and said, “Please enlighten me, my friend.”

“Do you know why the temple fair is held once every 100 years?” the cultivator asked.

“Is it a rule set by Great Xia Royal Family?” Qin Yu asked after some thought.

“My a*s.” The cultivator waved his hand. This phantom was an expert in the history of the Prince of Great Xia. This temple used to be one of his sanctums.

...

“Now, after so many years, the expert’s obsession will still appear in this sanctum every hundred years. As time went by, this place became a temple and temple fair, where everyone would take the opportunity to listen to his dao techniques.”

Qin Yu was shocked and said, “That is to say, that phantom is already dead, and it is only an obsession?”

“That’s right. It’s his obsession when he was alive, and the process of his enlightenment when he was alive. Therefore, no one knows what he will say each time. Whether one can comprehend anything depends on luck,” the cultivator said.

“Rumor has it that during a temple fair, this obsession sat there cross-legged for three days without saying a word,” the cultivator said with a smile.

Although the cultivator spoke in a relaxed manner, Qin Yu’s heart was in turmoil.

To pass down an obsession for so many years, how powerful must he have been when he was alive!

“Eh?” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt an extremely familiar internal qi.
