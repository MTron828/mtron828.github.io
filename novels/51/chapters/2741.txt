After the old man finished speaking, his eyes lit up. He looked at Qin Yu as if he was looking at a peerless beauty.

“Then what is the use of this mark? What’s the difference between different levels of mark?”

“The different levels of the mark represent the locations of the regions you can enter. The deeper you go, the more terrifying the resentment will be, and the closer you are to the core of the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. The benefits will naturally increase, but the risks will increase too.” The old man said with a smile. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He didn’t explain the risks and benefits in detail.

“The fourth form of the mark is enough to overturn all our previous preparations. It might be worth taking a risk. Although this will increase our danger from 10% to 90%, I still think it’s possible. Lord Alester, what do you think?”

Lord Alester lowered his head slightly and did not respond to the old man.

“It seems that Lord Alester has agreed. Brother Qin Yu, I will now formally introduce you to our guild. To put it bluntly, we should be the strongest guild among all the guilds. Of course, everyone has to contribute. After I finish speaking, you can decide whether you want to join.”

The old man pointed at the group of people and said.

“I, Cang Yunzi, will provide you with detailed information regarding the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. I will even provide you with some of the information I know about the tomb layout.”

“God Slayer Luo Yu will provide the divine artifact, Ten Directions Annihilation.

Its destructive power will resist the resentment and support of the Tomb of

Heavenly Sins. At the same time, it also represents the support of the God Slayer to us.”

Luo Yu snorted coldly.

The divine artifact was one aspect. On the other hand, it represented the joining of the God Slayer organization.

Otherwise, such a big cake could not be divided by just a few people. Qin Yu frowned slightly. He had heard Ruoyao mention this organization Derore.

This was a restriction that didn’t allow the Holy Lord to establish. They will kill any outsider with the sign of becoming a Holy Lord.

Furthermore, this force had appeared from the two Holy Lords before Dao Xuan. It was also a very ancient organization. The people who could join were practically all top-notch monsters with talent.

God Slayer? Qin Yu suddenly thought of that woman. Zi Yan, whom he had met at the top of the Treasure Repository Pavilion in the Demon Sealing Valley. She was at the top of the pavilion to obtain the artifact spirit of Ten Directions Annihilation. The shockwave almost killed him during that attack.

Moreover, he did not know why Zi Yan did not kill him when she left.

Had a real divine artifact appeared this time?

Qin Yu was also somewhat speechless. The fluctuation emitted by that divine artifact was already so terrifying. Then what kind of level would the complete version reach?

“Gu Ying, one of the four leaders of the Guardian of Order. Gu Ying has the

Immeasurable Fusion of the nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom. The Immeasurable

Fusion can draw upon the power of Saint Kingdom. When we fight against the Tomb of Heavenly Sins, we can obtain a certain degree of protection. The power of the Guardians of Order will also protect us from the periphery and prevent others from entering the area we choose.”

Half of Gu Ying’s face was hidden under the scarf. For some reason, Qin Yu felt that the leader of the Guardian of Order would look at him from time to time.

Previously, he had fought against the three major forces in the Endless Mine. This person probably did not have a good impression of him.

What surprised Qin Yu the most was that the Guardian of Order had joined forces with the God Slayer for the sake of the Tomb of Heavenly Sins.

One had to know that these two factions had always been enemies. One wanted to support the Holy Lord to ascend to the throne, while the other wanted to slaughter the candidates who had become Saints.

He didn’t expect the Tomb of Heavenly Sins to unite these two forces temporarily.

Furthermore, there was another thing that piqued Qin Yu’s curiosity. What kind of power was the Immeasurable Fusion of the nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom?

The three Hearts of Saint Kingdom Hearts from before had been heaven-defying at the start, but their power became insufficient after entering the core region.

Whether it was the power of the Eight Trigrams, the Nineteenth Prison, or the power of Meng Jing, the single Heart of Saint Kingdom’s power was suppressed. It could not even use its original skill.

Thus, the nine Hearts of Saint Kingdom’s Immeasurable Fusion was extremely important to Qin Yu.

If he could learn from it, it would be essential for his fusion.

Qin Yu glanced at Gu Ying. He happened to notice that the man was also looking at him.

“This is Liu Si, the person designated by the three of them. He has the information from when he entered the Third Heaven and represents the will of the three of them. ”

“Hello, big brother. You didn’t lie to us about your fourth form of mark, right? Grandpa Rosacea only had three marks at most at that time. If you lie to me, I’ll eat you.”

A Ioli with bright eyes stared at Qin Yu.

“Not only I’m lying, but I’m also going to eat you.”

Qin Yu said unhappily. The little Ioli in front of him gave him a feeling that she was a little like Jue Wu.

“This is Lord Alester’s guardian. He is very strong…”

A slightly thin middle-aged man nodded slightly. He held a sword in his chest.

Ever since Qin Yu came in, he had not moved at all. It seemed that all his attention was on that woman, Alester.

A Dao Protector?

Qin Yu was a little puzzled. Usually, only people with powerful backgrounds could have a Dao Protector.

Just like when they were in the lower realm, Uncle Yan was Yan Ruoxue’s Dao Protector.

This was the first time Qin Yu had seen a Dao Protector in this Saint Kingdom.

Cang Yunzi said that this man was indeed strong.

When he introduced this man, he did not mention his power.

In other words, these two people were strong enough to enter this team.

Moreover, even the Dao Protector could enter. Then, how powerful was the woman he was protecting?

“This is Lord Alester.”

Cang Yunzi held his hand and bowed.

“The last one is you, Qin Yu. You need to provide us with a drop of heart blood, and our strength will be shared with you. This is also the condition for you to join.”

Cang Yunzi stared at Qin Yu with an enthusiastic look.

Qin Yu revealed the seal on his chest. It was indeed the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. Cang Yunzi carefully sensed the mark on it and suddenly pointed with his hand.

A power instantly surged into Qin Yu’s chest and circulated in a strange path.

Soon, a heavy internal qi slowly emerged from Qin Yu’s back.

That heavy internal qi was like an ancient beast that had been unsealed.

Cang Yunzi suddenly retracted his power and took in a breath of cold air.

“It is the fourth form of mark. He didn’t lie to us. How did you defeat the third form of Heavenly Sin? It’s unbelievable.”

Cang Yunzi was in disbelief..
