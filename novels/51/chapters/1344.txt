Chapter 1345: Chapter 1345, she is the ultimate dance? ! 1 

The Golden Fist broke through all defenses, and his spells shattered the moment they came into contact!

This was a fist that could even kill Ling Yun, let alone this young man in front of him!

“Kacha!”

With a crisp sound, his head exploded, and even his primordial spirit exploded!

The corpse fell to the ground with a loud “Bang”.

The surrounding people were terrified, and their faces were ashen

What kind of punch was this? He didn’t even have the strength to fight back?

The people around Zhu Lan had extremely ugly expressions. They had wanted to tease the Wen brothers, but they didn’t expect such an outcome. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Do you still want to come?”Qin Yu stepped forward and pressed down on Zhu Lan.

Zhu Lan’s expression was extremely ugly. His self-esteem made it impossible for him to lower his head. However, fear made him abandon his self-esteem at that moment.

“So it’s fellow Daoist Qin Yu. I’ve long heard of you. It’s because I have poor eyesight,”Zhu Lan cupped his hands and said.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered. “You know me?”

“The news of Brother Qin killing Ling Yun has spread throughout the entire southern province,”Zhu Lan cupped his hands again.

After Zhu Lan’s reminder, the people around him also reacted.

This young man was the one who had killed Ling Yun with two punches!

Even Ling Yun couldn’t withstand two punches, let alone them!

“So... so it’s brother Qin. I’ve heard a lot about you.”The others also greeted him.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Hurry up and get lost. I’m warning you, you’d better not come here and act like a B * TCH. Otherwise, you’ll have to bear the consequences.”

“Yes, yes.”These people didn’t dare to say anything more and turned around to run.

After they ran far away, Wen Da and Wen Er excitedly gave Qin Yu a hug.

“Damn it, Qin Yu, you’ve given us a lot of face!”

“Well done!”

The two of them gave Qin Yu a thumbs up, their faces full of excitement.

Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “You see, some things still have to depend on yourself, right? Even Senior Wen can’t do anything about it.”

Wen Da waved his hand and said, “This is nothing. It’s just an occasional thing.”

“That’s right, that’s right.”Wen Er also nodded.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only let out a bitter laugh.

It seemed that these two brothers’thoughts were already deeply ingrained and would not change easily.

“Let’s go and admire the flowers!”Big Wen pulled Qin Yu and said.

It had to be said that this flower appreciation party was filled with beauties, and each of them was extraordinarily beautiful.

Meanwhile, Big Wen and Wen Er were like the second generation of the rich in the ordinary world. It could be said that they could easily pick up girls.

Qin Yu was not interested in this. His eyes kept looking around, as if he was looking for something.

“Didn’t I say that Jue Wu would come? Why isn’t she here yet?”Qin Yu muttered in his heart.

Jue Wu was a famous figure in the South Province. She was one of the people standing at the peak. She must be an outstanding woman.

“Hey, you’re blocking me. Get Out of my way!”

At this moment, an extremely childish voice came from behind Qin Yu.

Turning around, she saw a little loli who looked to be only 15 or 16 years old staring fiercely at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at her and smiled. “Little friend, I don’t seem to have blocked you, right?”

“Nonsense! Come over here, I want to ride you and admire the flowers!”The Little Loli said with an overbearing look.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at her and said, “Little friend, this won’t do. You have to be polite, understand? Say Something Nice, Big Brother can hug you and admire the flowers.”

“Hug Me?”The Little Loli snorted. “I said I want to ride you. Do you understand?”

Qin Yu rolled up her sleeves and said, “If you continue to be so rude, I will teach you a lesson!”

“Teach me a lesson? I will teach you a lesson!”

The Little Loli’s figure suddenly disappeared as if she had disappeared into space.

Before Qin Yu could react, she had already sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“En, the view is much better this way,”the Little Loli said to herself.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be secretly shocked.

Such speed was truly terrifying.

“The flower viewing event is really full of hidden dragons and Crouching Tigers,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, Qin Yu didn’t want to lower herself to the level of a child, so she smiled and said, “Are you satisfied now?”

The little loli frowned and said, “Satisfied my ass. Your shoulder isn’t comfortable at all. It’s full of bones, and my butt is aching. I order you to quickly eat fatter and be my exclusive meat cushion.”

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he heard that.

“You Little Brat, it’s fine if you ran to someone else without their consent, but now you dare to despise me?”Qin Yu pretended to be angry and said.

The Little Loli glared at Qin Yu and said, “Shut up and don’t delay me from appreciating the flowers!”

Qin Yu rolled up his sleeves and said, “If I don’t Teach You a lesson today, you will be a little arrogant.”

“Qin Yu, what the hell are you doing here!”

At this moment, Wen Da and Wen Er ran over.

Qin Yu pointed at the Little Loli on her shoulder and said, “I want to teach this little brat a lesson. Don’t Stop Me.”

Wen Da looked at Qin Yu’s shoulder, but his expression instantly became a little strange.

“Ma... Aunt Juewu, when did you come? Why didn’t you inform us?”Wen Da laughed embarrassedly.

“That’s right, that’s right. It’s also good for us to prepare a banquet or something.”Wen Er also nodded.

Qin Yu was stunned.

Juewu?

The Little Loli on her shoulder was the famous Juewu? !
