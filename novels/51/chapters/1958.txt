1959 He Teng Reappeared

“The one who exterminated the Immortal Slaying Sect?” The expression of the elderly man beside him changed slightly.

The prince did not say a thing, but his eyes seemed to have many hidden stories.

The scene was silent, and the people from the Si family had tremendously ugly expressions.

The entire Si family would lose face with Si Shifeng’s defeat. He might even become Qin Yu’s stepping stone!

Not long ago, Si Shiyu had lost to Qin Yu. However, he had forcefully suppressed his cultivation realm. Therefore, it did not attract much attention from outsiders.

But today, Qin Yu defeated Si Shifeng in an open and aboveboard manner!

Everyone stared at the battlefield as if waiting for Qin Yu’s next move.

Qin Yu’s clothes shattered, his solid muscles stained with blood and bright red under the sun.

He walked up to Si Shifeng, bent his body, and looked down.

“Si Shifeng, you’ve lost,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Si Shifeng’s body was constantly trembling. He opened his mouth slightly, and blood gushed out.

“I hope you will keep your promise and let Chang Mang go,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Everyone present saw it, and Qin Yu wasn’t afraid Si Shifeng would go back on his word.

If not for Chang Mang, Qin Yu would have already killed Si Shifeng! If he killed Si Shifeng, Chang Mang probably could not come out again.

“Qin Yu… has won. This name will soon resound throughout Zhongzhou,” someone on the city wall sighed and said.

Qin Yu did not say anything else. He turned around and planned to leave.

However, at this moment, extremely powerful internal qi appeared in the surroundings.

The void trembled and rippled in all directions like water.

In a short while, four elderly men walked out from the dark.

The internal qi on their bodies was incredibly terrifying. Even if Qin Yu were at his peak, he would not be their match, not to mention Qin Yu was severely injured.

“Semi… Semi Saint! Four Semi-Saints!” On the city wall, someone’s expression changed drastically!

“What are they trying to do? Are they going to make a move ”

“Wouldn’t that disgrace the Si family? If you can’t beat him, you’ll kill him?”

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He looked at the four people in front and said, “What’s the matter?”

“Qin Yu, do you think it’s over? You can’t leave today,” one of the Semi-Saints sneered and said.

“Oh? What do you mean?” Qin Yu had a bad feeling.

“Hahaha! With the four of us here today, surely you’ll die!” That Semi-Saint shouted, and his terrifying internal qi swept toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu, being severely injured, was forced back several steps instantly!

The people on the city wall were no longer calm. Was the Si family going to act like a hooligan in front of everyone?

“The Si family failed to defeat Qin Yu, so they have to do such a disgraceful thing?”

“It’s a battle between the younger generation, but the older generation is taking action. This is insulting the reputation of the nine great aristocratic families!”

“Has the Si family become so shameless?”

Everyone was commenting animatedly, but the Semi-Saints couldn’t care less.

They looked around and said indifferently, “Everyone, please don’t misunderstand. Si Shifeng lost to Qin Yu because he was not capable. Of course, we won’t interfere.”

They then changed the subject and said coldly, “However, this person stole our Si family’s things, taking away our ores. He must pay the price!”

“Ore? What ore? Why haven’t we heard of it?”

“If you want to punish someone, you can’t simply find an excuse!”

“The Si family is just finding an excuse!”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. He didn’t expect the Si family to have such a trick up their sleeves!

In that case, wouldn’t Qin Yu’s efforts be wasted?

“Qin Yu, do you admit?” Seeing things not going well, a Semi-Saint immediately walked toward Qin Yu.

“When did the ores become the Si family’s belonging?” Qin Yu asked with a cold expression.

“Oh? It seems like you’re stubborn?” A half-Saint sneered.

After that, he looked into the distance.

After a while, a familiar figure appeared in front of everyone.

This man was none other than Gu Xinghe!

Gu Xinghe strode over slowly.

He looked at Qin Yu with a smug look and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, you stole the ores in my city and then ran away. Have you forgotten about it?”

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly. He did not expect Gu Xinghe, this b*stard, to have come!

“That ores have nothing to do with you all!” Qin Yu said coldly.

Gu Xinghe laughed heartily and said, “Qin Yu, are you joking?”

“You guys have never discovered the ores, not to mention you’ve personally said to split the ores between us!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“When did I say that?” Gu Xinghe laughed. “You’ve stolen something, so you must die!”

With that, Gu Xinghe took a step back, and the Semi-Saints walked toward Qin Yu slowly.

...

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. He gritted his teeth and kept retreating.

In front of these four Semi-Saints, Qin Yu couldn’t resist at all!

As the four Semi-Saints got closer, the Prince of Great Xia walked over.

With the help of several people, he walked up to them and cupped his hands. “Everyone, please give me some face, and let’s discuss this matter. What do you think?”

The Semi-Saints looked at the Prince of Great Xia, and one of them smiled and said, “Your Highness, don’t get involved in this matter. After all, it has nothing to do with you.”

“It’s right. Why don’t you just enjoy your life? Why must you get involved in our Si family’s affairs?”

Although these people sounded calm, their words were full of sarcasm and threat.

The prince was not angry. He smiled and said, “If Qin Yu has really stolen your things, it’s good enough for him to return them. Why must you take his life? Moreover, Qin Yu has just defeated Si Shifeng. If you attack him now, won’t the world misunderstand and laugh at you?”

The faces of the Semi-Saints turned cold, and their tone became colder. “I’ve already said this matter has nothing to do with you. Please step down to avoid getting injured accidentally!”

The Prince of Great Xia could not help but sigh.

He glanced at Qin Yu and said with a bitter smile, “Brother Qin, I’m afraid I can’t help you.”

Qin Yu gave the Prince of Great Xia a grateful look to express his gratitude.

Then he quietly mobilized the remaining internal qi in his body, planning to fight to the death!

But at this moment, the void in front of them trembled again. Then a young man in a black robe walked out of the void.

The man stood in front of Qin Yu and said coldly, “Qin Yu, I didn’t expect you to die again. What a pity…”

Hearing this familiar voice, Qin Yu frowned and said, “You’re… He Teng?”

True enough! He took off his black robe and revealed his face.

“Mr. Gu, long time no see,” He Teng said coldly.
