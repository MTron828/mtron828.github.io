Chapter 1140: Chapter 1,140, confusing the real with the fake? 

These eight high-ranking officials were like gods as they looked down on everyone.

The dazzling light emitted from their eyes seemed to be forcing people to kneel!

The eight high-ranking officials had finally appeared.

Qin Yu, who was in the main hall, naturally felt these abnormal internal QI.

“It’s those eight mighty figures...”Yao Meng’s voice was slightly trembling.

“Fear them a little. At most, they’ll die!”Chang Mang said coldly.

Other than Chang Mang, the others didn’t say anything.

It was very obvious that they didn’t want to offend these eight high-ranking officials for Qin Yu’s sake.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t blame them. In a life-and-death situation, everyone was afraid. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Therefore, Chang Mang’s feelings were even more precious.

“It’s a blessing, not a curse. If It’s a curse, it can’t be avoided.”Qin Yu put down the Teacup in his hand and slowly stood up.

He clearly remembered what the eight high-ranking officials had said.

Once they met, they would kill Qin Yu immediately.

Therefore, Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent and immediately used all his trump cards!

The battle word formula, the Divine Dragon Mark, the green wood true body, and all the other trump cards were unleashed at this instant!

A powerful internal Qi flow instantly appeared around Qin Yu’s body. This internal Qi flow even made the martial saint feel a little uncomfortable!

“What a powerful internal Qi!”Zhuang Teng exclaimed.

Not only Zhuang Teng, but Yao Meng and the others were also shocked by the powerful internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body!

Even Xiao Yuan, who had always been silent, had a trace of surprise flash in his eyes.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He turned around and planned to leave.

“Qin Yu, be careful,”pavilion master said in a low voice.

At this time, they couldn’t help.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I will.”

Then, Qin Yu walked out of the hall and approached the eight higher-ups step by step.

At this time, many warriors in the second secret realm had already knelt on the ground and worshipped the eight higher-ups.

Mu Qiang’s mentality made them want to lick the toes of these eight people.

“Where’s Qin Yu?”

Finally, a high-ranking official spoke.

The one who spoke was Yan Yongfu, the leader of these eight high-ranking officials.

That voice was like thunder, deafening.

The people below looked at each other, not knowing how to answer.

“I’m asking you, Where’s Qin Yu? Tell him to come out and see me,”Yan Yongfu spoke again.

“There’s no need to look for him. I’m Coming.”

At this moment, Qin Yu had already walked over.

He stood below and raised his head to look at the eight high-ranking officials coldly.

Yan Yongfu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Qin Yu, do you still remember me?”

Qin Yu said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner, “If my guess is correct, you should be the one who possessed Gu Zizhen’s body.”

“That’s right!”Yan Yongfu shouted.

“You destroyed my foundation and killed my disciples. What crime do you have to commit?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Go to Hell. Why are you saying so much nonsense? At this time, is there a need to talk such nonsense? If you want to kill me, just say it.”

“Hahahaha!”Yan Yongfu could not help but burst into laughter.

“You are right. I just want to kill you. You should still remember what I said back then. I will let you know the true strength of a mighty figure!”

After saying that, Yan Yongfu waved his sleeves at Qin Yu!

A breeze-like internal Qi shot towards Qin Yu!

This internal Qi was obviously very ordinary, but the power contained within it was something Qin Yu had never seen before!

He hurriedly raised his arms and placed them in front of his chest!

“Boom!”

That internal Qi still smashed fiercely onto Qin Yu’s body!

At the instant of the collision, Qin Yu’s body instantly shot backwards explosively!

Dense cracks appeared on the QINGMU true body. It did not even last a second before it directly exploded!

The golden light that covered Qin Yu’s body directly turned into powder and disappeared without a trace!

Even with the true body of Greenwood as a buffer, this force still directly shattered Qin Yu’s chest, causing his internal organs to be distorted!

Qin Yu’s body shot out hundreds of meters and fiercely fell to the ground.

“Pu!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out from Qin Yu’s mouth!

When everyone saw this, they were all shocked!

Just a single palm had already caused Qin Yu to be in such a sorry state?

One had to know that not long ago, Qin Yu had just beheaded a mighty figure!

“Is this the strength of a true mighty figure...”Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and stood up from the ground.

Not far away, Yan Yongfu frowned slightly and snorted coldly, “He actually didn’t die?”

This palm strike seemed to be a casual wave, but in fact, it was the condensation of all his internal Qi and battle intent. Not to mention that it contained his life’s ultimate technique, it was almost enough!

However, what Yan Yongfu did not expect was that this palm actually did not kill Qin Yu!

“As expected of someone who can make the Jingdu martial arts association suffer a loss. In this case, I will have to kill you even more.”Yan Yongfu’s tone contained an extreme coldness.

He raised his palm, as if he was preparing some extremely terrifying move.

At the same time, the eight people beside him also raised their hands, intending to use a lightning strike to directly kill Qin Yu!

“Stop!”

At this moment, a voice came from the dark!

Turning around, they saw a man in a black robe, whose face was covered, slowly walking out.

“Damn it, why did you come so late? If you were any later, I might REALLY DIE!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart!

However, Yao Qing didn’t pay attention to Qin Yu. He directly walked past Qin Yu and arrived in front of the higher-ups in a few steps.

“Who are you?”Yan Yongfu asked with a cold face.

“Dao Protector.”Yao Qing spat out these three words coldly.

His voice seemed to have undergone some special treatment and was completely different from Yao Qing’s.

“You... You Said... Who Are You? !”Yan Yongfu’s expression instantly changed!

“Do you want me to repeat myself a second time?”Yao Qing said coldly.

These concise words, coupled with his cold tone, had a certain temperament.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t tell whether this person was a dao protector or not.
