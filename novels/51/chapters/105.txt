Chapter 106: Yan Ruoxue Left Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Two days of hard work made Qin Yu so exhausted that he quickly fell asleep.

Not long after he fell asleep, Yan Yongxiu’s car stopped downstairs.

“President Yan, Miss Yan is staying here.” Yan Jiang bowed and said.

Yan Yongxiu nodded and said, “Take me upstairs.”

“Yes, President Yan.” Yan Jiang hurriedly led the way and brought Yan Yongxiu all the way to Yan Ruoxue’s room.

Yan Ruoxue had long woken up. She barely slept at all last night.

“Ruoxue, it’s time to go back,” Yan Yongxiu said indifferently.

Yan Ruoxue nodded and said, “I know.”

“Then let’s go,” Yan Yongxiu said in a sullen voice.

Yan Ruoxue bit her rosy lips with her teeth. She, wanting to say goodbye to Qin Yu, got up and went to Qin Yu’s room.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu was sleeping soundly. Yan Ruoxue didn’t have the heart to disturb him.

The few of them surrounded Qin Yu and didn’t speak for a long time.

“Let’s go,” Yan Ruoxue whispered. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Aren’t you going to say goodbye to him?” Yan Yongxiu asked.

Yan Ruoxue’s heart hardened and she shook her head. “No.”

“Then let’s go.” Yan Yongxiu strode out of the door.

“Ruoxue... I like you...”

Just as the few of them were about to reach the door, Qin Yu, who was lying on the bed, suddenly blurted out a sentence in a daze.

Yan Ruoxue’s body instantly stiffened, and her footsteps couldn’t help but stop.

She turned around, only to find that Qin Yu was only talking in his sleep.

“Even in his dreams, he was calling your name.” Yan Yongxiu sighed.

Yan Ruoxue felt even sadder. She bit her lip and suddenly said, “Dad, wait for me for a while.”

She hurried back to her room, took out a pen, and quickly began to write something on the paper.

She revised, changed, then repeated, and wrote a full page of words.

However, no matter how she wrote it, Yan Ruoxue wasn’t satisfied.

“Forget it.” In the end, Yan Ruoxue tore up the paper and threw it into the trash can.

Then, she wrote a few words in large pens: I’m returning to Jingdu. You have to take care of yourself.

These few simple words expressed Yan Ruoxue’s most sincere feelings.

She placed the paper on Qin Yu’s bedside, then kissed Qin Yu’s forehead gently.

“Let’s go.” Yan Ruoxue didn’t stay any longer. She turned around and walked out of the door.

In the car, Yan Ruoxue’s eyes were fixed in the direction of Qin Yu’s room.

“Start the car.” Yan Ruoxue waved her hand.

“Yes, Miss Yan.” The driver started the car.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly woke up.

He had a bad premonition inside and sat on the bed in a daze.

Soon, Qin Yu saw the note left on the head of the bed.

Qin Yu hurriedly opened the note and saw Yan Ruoxue’s handwriting.

“Miss Yan... Miss Yan...” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically and he felt as if his heart had been pricked by something!

He hurriedly ran to the window and looked out.

The Yan family’s car was downstairs and was about to leave.

“Ruoxue!” Qin Yu shouted with all his might!

Then, he ran downstairs at the fastest speed!

Unfortunately, the sound insulation of the car was very good, so Yan Ruoxue didn’t hear Qin Yu’s voice.

Just when Qin Yu rushed downstairs, the car started slowly and drove forward.

Qin Yu’s expression became extremely ugly. He gritted his teeth and chased after the car with all his might.

“Miss Yan! Ruoxue!” Qin Yu almost used all his strength to chase after the car.

In the car, Yan Ruoxue was in a very bad mood .

Although the two of them hadn’t been together for long, Qin Yu had long left a mark in Yan Ruoxue’s heart.

“Maybe in a year, this kid will really be able to come to Jingdu,” Yan Yongxiu comforted.

“Not maybe, but definitely.” Yan Ruoxue’s tone was extremely firm.

“I hope so.” Yan Yongxiu nodded.

The speed of the car was getting faster and faster, but Qin Yu, who was behind, had no intention of giving up.

His forehead was covered in sweat. As he chased, he shouted crazily.

“Miss Yan, there seems to be someone chasing us from behind.” Finally, through the rearview mirror, the driver saw Qin Yu, who was desperately chasing behind them.

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue hurriedly opened the window and looked behind the car.

“Stop the car!” Yan Ruoxue said hurriedly.

“Miss Yan, we...”

“I told you to stop the car!” Yan Ruoxue shouted.

The driver didn’t dare to disobey Yan Ruoxue, so he quickly leaned the car against the roadside.

Yan Ruoxue got out of the car and walked in Qin Yu’s direction.

The two of them rushing towards each other made Qin Yu even more impulsive.

He quickly ran to Yan Ruoxue and hugged Yan Ruoxue tightly!

“D*mn it, this b*stard!” Yan Jiang was furious. He was about to push the door open but was stopped by Yan Yongxiu.

“Forget it, let them be.” Yan Yongxiu waved his hand.

Hearing this, Yan Jiang had no choice but to keep quiet.

Qin Yu pulled Yan Ruoxue into his arms tightly and tears flowed out.

“Are you leaving already? Why are you in such a hurry...” Qin Yu said with some anguish.

Yan Ruoxue was still the gentle and generous Yan Ruoxue.

She reached out to wipe Qin Yu’s tears and said with a smile, “A man can’t shed tears at will.”

Qin Yu wiped the tears from the corner of his eyes and said with extreme anguish, “Can you not leave?”

“No,” Yan Ruoxue said without hesitation.

“I have been in Jiangcheng long enough. It’s time for me to return to Jingdu,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

“But... but I don’t want you to leave...” Qin Yu said somewhat shamelessly.

After these few days, she had already become a part of Qin Yu’s life that he couldn’t part with.

A day of not them seeing each other felt like three years.

This was Qin Yu’s current mentality.

Yan Ruoxue reached out and gently patted Qin Yu’s head. She smiled gently and said, “If you want to see me, come to Jingdu and look for me.”

“One year later, I’ll wait for you in Jingdu. I’ll wait for you to marry me.”

Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer, and tears almost burst out of his eyes.

But he didn’t want Yan Ruoxue to worry, and he didn’t want to disappoint Yan Ruoxue either. So he held back his grief.

“Of course, I’ll definitely go to Jingdu to marry you one year later. Wait for me!” Qin Yu said through gritted teeth.

“Ruoxue, it’s time to go,” Yan Yongxiu said indifferently in the car.

Yan Ruoxue glanced at Yan Yongxiu and then at Qin Yu. “Qin Yu, you have to rely on yourself in the future.”

“You can’t be too soft-hearted to some people. Otherwise, you will be bullied, understand?”

“I will wait for you in Jingdu in a year. I will wait for you to marry me.”

After saying this, Yan Ruoxue didn’t turn around and walked towards the car.

These few words kept echoing in Qin Yu’s mind.

He felt like his heart had been pierced through by countless needles. He was in extreme anguish.

Just as the car was about to start, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He hurriedly shouted, “Ruoxue, wait!”

The car came to a sudden stop again.

Qin Yu anxiously ran to the front of the car. He took out the jade pendant and handed it to Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue, this jade pendant is a gift from me to you. You must wear it at all times!” Qin Yu said with emotion.

Yan Ruoxue took the jade pendant and said with a smile, “Okay, definitely.”
