Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The smell of blood seemed to faintly emanate from his eyes.

“I accept, ” Qin Yu said, taking a deep breath, already prepared in an instant. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Snap!

With a snap of his fingers, the world before Qin Yu changed.

Before he could be surprised, a sword light had already appeared before him.

Qin Yu subconsciously moved to retreat, but his expression immediately changed.

Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze!

He abruptly opened the eye on his forehead, and the power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze poured out suddenly.

The violent power directly blocked the ordinary Dao sword.

“True Consciousness divine might?” Qin Yu was somewhat shocked.

Qin Yu was somewhat startled. He had seen the power of divine might before, but it was only in the recent battle with a True Consciousness expert that he truly understood its profound impact on himself.

He realized how significant the influence of this divine might was, a suppression of the cultivation realm.

The imposing pressure emitted by a higher-level divine soul when exerting the power of rules.

It was akin to the authority of a superior over an inferior, a force that locked down his divine soul and the aura of his body’s internal qi, nearly causing him to falter just a moment ago.

Order of Reflection!

Qin Yu dared not show any negligence, Tiger Wing trembled slightly.

The sword light had already traversed several spaces and accurately reached Xin Yue’s throat. Bang!

A palm resembling white jade blocked the Tiger Wing’s deadly blade the moment it extended.

“Hahaha, interesting,” Xin Yue laughed after blocking the Tiger Wing, landing another punch on it.

The Tiger Wing emitted a crisp metallic sound as a tremendous force transmitted from the void to the hilt, then into Qin Yu’s arm. Qin Yu’s arm bones made a loud sound, and half of his body went numb.

The force from this punch nearly broke his arm.

Vessel! Unseal!

The power of the Heart of the Saint Kingdom illuminated, and the sealed power within it suddenly surged through Qin Yu’s body.

Ling Bo!

Qin Yu stomped his feet and arrived in front of Elder Xin Yue. Then, he swung his Tiger Wing again.

Before Xin Yue could attack, he had to seize every second to launch his attack.

Otherwise, the power of the True Consciousness divine might would greatly affect his performance, leaving him with no chance of survival.

“Good!” Xin Yue seemed to have transformed into a different person as she laughed maniacally.

A punch was thrown at Qin Yu’s blade.

Instantly, a storm-like energy erupted, and Qin Yu’s body flew away like a piece of paper.

“The divine soul’s essence is quite resilient. Under the influence of my battle clone’s divine might, it managed to escape from the elusive Demon Sealing Valley. That’s not bad,” Xin Yue laughed heartily.

Her figure blurred, and she swiftly caught up to Qin Yu using her Ling Bo.

Qin Yu felt a surge of blood in his throat, his face filled with horror.

He had assumed that a Daoist’s physical cultivation wouldn’t be formidable, but he hadn’t expected her physical prowess to be this terrifying.

She had managed to block his Tiger Wing with her fists and even heavily injured him with her Ethereal Movement Technique.

Ling Bo, Fleeing Shadow!

Qin Yu stomped his foot, causing his body to rise a meter higher. Then, he employed the Fleeing Shadow Technique, merging his shadow with the ground and reappearing ten meters away.

Suddenly, a force pulled him back.

“When did this guy learn the movement technique of our Demon Sealing Valley? And under Master’s divine might, he’s using it so calmly. Even I probably couldn’t dodge Master’s two punches in a row,” Jing Xin exclaimed, surprised by Qin Yu’s unexpected skill.

“Hahaha, not bad with the movement technique. Looks like you’ve got some talent,” Xin Yue chuckled as she adjusted her position.

She pursued Qin Yu like a cat playing with a mouse. After Qin Yu dodged another attack, she abruptly halted.

Then, she extended her hand towards Qin Yu, her smile taking on a sinister edge.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He felt as though all his emitted internal qi was suddenly grasped by a force, immobilizing him like a cold-blooded animal entangling its prey.

His divine sense, internal qi, and even his body’s scent were enveloped in this terrifying chill.

Ethereal Movement Technique!

He instinctively activated his Ethereal Movement Technique, causing his entire body’s flesh and blood to lose gravity in an instant.

Soaring Wind Slash!

A mocking expression suddenly appeared in front of him, and a hand blade slashed diagonally.

Qin Yu heard the sound of his ribs, spine, muscles, and blood vessels breaking. This slash had cut his body in half just like that.

Closing in instantly and dealing heavy damage to the enemy, the power was immense. It could only be described as such. Even when using the Ethereal Movement Technique, there was no surge of power. Qin Yu!

Jing Xin couldn’t bear to watch and closed his eyes.

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s eyes turned pitch-black.

“Elder Xin Yue, this is the most powerful move I’ve comprehended in this Saint Kingdom. It’s filled with destruction, nothingness, and devoid of life. However, I, Qin Yu, don’t like it. I prefer to leave a trace of life amidst destruction. I call this move the Dusk Saber.”

Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly turned pitch-black, and the Tiger Wing in his hand slashed out.

It carried the immense power of the Order of Destruction in the Saint Kingdom, like a ferocious demonic dragon.

In an instant, both Jing Xin and Xin Yue, who had been watching coldly from the side, had their expressions drastically changed.

A terrifying phantom appeared behind Qin Yu. The emitted power even made Xin Yue’s hands tremble slightly.

What kind of terrifying rules were these?

She had sensed this power before, which was why she had stopped Qin Yu from attacking.

Now, being so close to the Dusk Saber, she suddenly realized its terrifying power.

Qin Yu’s body started trembling violently as he swung his saber.

That power had already spread to his entire divine soul, surrounding his divine soul origin and attempting to invade his entire consciousness from all directions.

Without any hesitation, the hand holding the Tiger Wing had already slashed at his neck, and his head and body were suddenly separated.

The Seal of Heaven Returning lit up. Qin Yu traversed the time tunnel and returned to the moment before Xin Yue’s saber struck his body.

Seeing his figure restored, he appeared on the battlefield again without hesitation.

Xin Yue was currently facing the Dusk Saber. The terrifying divine might suppressed her body. She couldn’t even raise her fist as her entire body was torn apart by the blade.

A surge of energy appeared around the minced meat, carrying countless ripples.

In that spot, the entire space moved slowly like water waves, with flickering light and shadow.

It was a very strange feeling as if she were in a dream. Elder Xin Yue suddenly transformed into countless butterflies and danced.

The butterflies then split into countless identical Xin Yues.

For a moment, no one could tell whether she was the butterfly or the butterfly was her.

An extreme drowsiness surged into Qin Yu’s head, almost causing him to fall asleep directly.

He gritted his teeth and barely managed to resist falling asleep.
