Chapter 421: Elder Zhuo’s Trump Card Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It wasn’t a good thing to be targeted by such a grim reaper!

Elder Zhuo hurriedly looked at the people around him and said, “Everyone, try your best to protect me!”

Qin Yu had already charged towards Elder Zhuo!

“Hurry up and kill him!” Everyone shouted in unison.

In an instant, rays of light rose in all directions, and spells charged straight towards Qin Yu!

On the other hand, Qin Yu relied on his strong physical body to charge straight at Elder Zhuo. He completely gave up on defense and focused all his attention on charging straight at Elder Zhuo!

Elder Zhuo knew that he was no match for Qin Yu, so he fled frantically.

Qin Yu chased after him relentlessly. No matter how much his body was bombarded with spells, he completely ignored them!

“This madman!” Elder Zhuo roared inside!

If this continued, he would definitely be killed by Qin Yu!

“Hurry up and kill him!” Elder Zhuo was anxious and angry as he shouted desperately!

“Elder Zhuo, hang in there. We will use this opportunity to get rid of Qin Yu,” someone said coldly from the side.

Even though that was the case, they were unable to cause any fatal injuries to Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

Finally, Elder Zhuo was hit by Qin Yu He vomited blood on the spot!

He hurriedly got up and continued to run away. As he ran, he silently chanted a spell in an attempt to block Qin Yu’s path.

“F * ck, these b*stards have no intention of letting me live at all!” Elder Zhuo roared inside!

These people were doing their best to get rid of Qin Yu. As for whether Elder Zhuo could survive, no one cared at all.

“Boom!”

Another punch smashed into Elder Zhuo’s chest!

This punch caused Elder Zhuo’s chest to sink and his sternum to be broken!

“Kid, you’re going too far!” Elder Zhuo roared crazily.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a long sword rose up from behind him and stabbed into Qin Yu’s back!

The sword pierced through Qin Yu’s body and fresh blood flowed down his body.

“Well done!” Shouted Elder Zhuo. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

But in the next second, his face turned extremely pale.

Qin Yu pulled out the long sword and chased after him again!

“Mr. Zhuo, don’t you have secret treasures? Don’t tell me you still want to hold back at this time!” Someone said coldly.

Mr. Zhuo couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

He had indeed accumulated a lot of treasures after traveling all over these years.

One of the secret treasures even possessed a trace of ancient power!

However, although the power of this secret treasure was great, it could only be used once!

After one use, it would turn into ruins!

How could Elder Zhuo bear to use it?!

“Slap!”

Just as Elder Zhuo was in a dilemma, Qin Yu swung his palm and slapped his face.

This slap shattered Elder Zhuo’s facial bones.

With his already sagging skin, he looked even more old in that instant.

“Qin Yu, you’re going too far!” Elder Zhuo was completely driven mad!

He flipped his palm and a Buddha bead landed on his palm!

“This Buddha bead was obtained from a Western religion. It possesses the purest power of faith. Let’s see what you can do...”

“Whoosh!”

Before Elder Zhuo could finish speaking, the Buddha bead in his hand disappeared.

In the next second, the Buddha bead landed between Qin Yu’s two fingers.

“Buddha Bead? This is really a good thing.” Qin Yu sized up the Buddha bead with a hint of interest on his face.

“You... you... pfft!”

Elder Zhuo was so angry that he vomited blood on the spot!

This secret treasure that had been treasured for many years had actually been snatched away by Qin Yu?

“Why do you say so much nonsense?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said indifferently.

“But no matter what, I still have to thank you for giving me such a babe. In return, I will let you die a quick death.” Qin Yu grinned.

Elder Zhuo’s entire body was trembling, and a wave of anger filled his chest.

“Qin Yu, you’ve gone too far. I’m going to kill you! I’m definitely going to kill you!” Elder Zhuo roared repeatedly. He actually spat out a wave of black energy from his mouth!

This wave of black energy blotted out the sky and covered the sun. It was extremely sinister!

Following that, the black energy spread in the air and slowly condensed into a skeleton holding a huge knife!

On the other hand, Elder Zhuo’s body seemed to have been hollowed out. He became as thin as a stick and his eyeballs bulged out!

“What... What kind of spell is this?” Someone exclaimed.

“I have no... no idea...”

“It’s the Senluo demon statue! It’s said that the price for using this spell is that one can never reincarnate...”

“Looks like Elder Zhuo has really been forced into a corner.”

“Everyone, don’t hide your strength. Use this opportunity to use your trump card to get rid of Qin Yu!”

Qin Yu’s expression turned solemn as he faced the giant skeleton.

As someone of the same generation as Jiang He, Elder Zhuo wasn’t to be underestimated.

This technique made Qin Yu feel a sense of danger.

“Rumble...”

The skeleton let out a mournful sound in mid-air.

The large saber in his hand carried killing intent!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately used the Saintly Body Technique and looked at the skeleton with a grave expression.

“Swoosh!”

Finally, the skeleton made his move!

His broadsword sliced through the sky and came slashing at his waist!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He raised his hand and used the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

“Swoosh!”

However, Qin Yu’s fist went straight through the broadsword!

“Huh?” Qin Yu’s expression changed.

Before he could recover from his shock, the broadsword had already cut into his waist!

“Bang!”

Under the broadsword, Qin Yu felt as if he had suffered a heavy blow, and his entire body was sent flying dozens of meters!

A one-centimeter-deep bloody scar appeared on Qin Yu’s waist.

“How could this be...” Qin Yu touched the blood that was flowing out, and his expression was extremely cold.

“My fist can’t touch him, but he can actually slash at my body...”

“Swoosh!”

The second blade had already slashed over!

Qin Yu hurriedly dodged. He tried to use the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist to attack again, but the result was the same. He still passed through this skeleton!

“Oh no,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The power of this huge blade was extremely strong. Even Qin Yu’s physical body couldn’t withstand it.

“I must not let this huge blade touch me. Otherwise, even if I don’t die, I will be heavily injured.” Qin Yu’s face was full of solemnity.

“Everyone, now is the best time. Let’s kill him!” The others said coldly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

In an instant, these ten or so peak Inner Strength Grandmasters used all their trump cards. Each of their spells had the power to split open the earth!

Even Qin Yu’s physical body couldn’t withstand it!

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, the skeleton’s large saber swung over!

The overwhelming spells were impenetrable, and with the skeleton’s large saber, there was nowhere for Qin Yu to hide!
