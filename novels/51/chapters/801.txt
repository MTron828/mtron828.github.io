Chapter 802: Chapter 802, beating! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Granny Qin’s expression changed slightly. Although she was extremely displeased, she still felt some fear when facing ye Qing.

Back then, Granny Qin had watched ye Qing grow up.

Moreover, the Jingdu martial arts association had given many obstacles to ye Qing’s path of growth.

Thus, the relationship between the two parties was naturally not much better.

Granny Qin snorted lightly and turned around to leave.

Just Ye Qing’s identity alone was not something she could contend with.

Ten minutes later.

A taxi drove over from not far away.

The people who came were none other than Qin Yu and the handlebar mustache!

The Moment Qin Yu got off the car, he attracted countless gazes.

Everyone looked at Qin Yu in unison and began to discuss in low voices.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He passed through the crowd and strode towards Qinggang Mountain.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, ye Qing waved at Qin Yu.

Seeing ye Qing at the scene, Qin Yu was also somewhat surprised.

He quickly walked forward and exclaimed, “Officer Ye, why are you here?”

Ye Qing took a puff of his cigarette and said, intentionally or unintentionally, “I have to ensure that the people of our military district will not encounter injustice.”

These words were clearly aimed at Granny Qin and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Granny Qin snorted coldly, and her heart immediately became even more displeased.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Officer Ye, it’s fine. Even if they play tricks, I’m not afraid.”

“So Confident?”Ye Qing said with some surprise.

Qin Yu glanced at Blackie and snorted coldly, “I’ll kill him like slaughtering chickens and dogs.”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s feet shook, and he landed in front of Blacky.

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere was pushed to the climax.

Waves of killing intent burst out from Blacky’s dark pupils.

And the killing intent on Qin Yu’s body was even more intense! The entire scene instantly became extremely cold!

“I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time.”Qin Yu slightly clenched his fist, and the killing intent in his heart seemed to be unable to be restrained.

“Me Too!”

Blackie roared angrily, and the aura on his body directly exploded!

This time, both sides did not say too much nonsense!

Their hatred towards each other seemed to have been endured for a long time, and they could no longer suppress it today!

The collision of both sides’internal Qi instantly caused bursts of explosions!

And the pressure on both sides made it even more difficult to breathe!

“Qin Yu, you damn bastard!”

Along with Little Black’s furious roar, he took the initiative to attack!

Relying on the power of a martial saint, Little Black threw a punch at Qin Yu!

The power of this punch was extremely terrifying. Just the wind from the punch was enough to cause the surrounding gravel to buzz!

This time, Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch.

Only a pair of cold eyes stared coldly at little black.

“Boom!”

This punch landed squarely on Qin Yu’s body!

A huge explosion exploded on Qin Yu’s body!

The crushed stones instantly turned into dust, and the dust even covered the sky!

Waves of terrifying storms swept across the entire scene, but Qin Yu, who was at the center of the storm, did not move an inch.

Little Black’s fist landed on Qin Yu’s chest. Qin Yu’s eyes were looking down at little black from above, looking coldly at him.

“How... how is this possible!”Little Black’s expression changed drastically!

This punch couldn’t even move Qin Yu? !

After all, his punch contained the power of a martial saint!

“What you have, I have.”Qin Yu’s voice sounded in Little Black’s ear.

Before little black could react, Qin Yu had already reached out and grabbed little black’s wrist.

A huge force twisted Blackie’s wrist in a strange arc.

Blackie struggled with all his might, but he found that he could not break free!

“Martial saint’s power, huh? I have it too!”

As his voice fell, a golden palm struck out fiercely!

“Pa!”

A clear sound, along with the sound of bones breaking, entered everyone’s ears!

Blackie’s body was sent flying a few hundred meters! His head was directly embedded into the ground!

The scene was silent.

No one dared to believe this scene.

“Blackie! !”Granny Qin’s eyes were wide open as she shouted with all her might.

She wanted to rush forward, but was blocked by ye Qing.

“What, do you want to break the rules?”Ye Qing said coldly.

Granny Qin clenched her teeth. Tears were about to roll out of her muddy eyes.

The people around her were even more shocked!

When did Qin Yu become so powerful? ! He had completely crushed Blackie who possessed the power of a martial saint? !

Yan Jinyao’s eyes widened. His pupils seemed to be filled with anger!

“Ah! ! !”

At this moment, Blackie dashed out from the ground!

Half of his face had been shattered, and it was a terrifying sight to behold!

“Qin Yu, I’m going to kill you! !”Blackie raised his head and roared, and rays of light shot out from his mouth!

This light gathered in his mouth, and in the next second, that Ray of light shot towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu sneered, “It’s useless, you’ll definitely lose today!”

Facing this powerful spell, Qin Yu slightly clenched his fist, and Golden Light began to gather on his fist!

“One punch can break all spells!”

Qin Yu roared again and again, and his simple and unadorned fist instantly met it with a fierce force!

“Boom!”

A loud sound spread out!

That golden light was only delayed for half a second, and then, in a crushing manner, it poured towards Blackie!

“Boom!”

The golden light landed squarely on Blackie’s body!

He spat out a mouthful of blood, and he was forced to retreat a few meters before he finally fell to the ground!

Blackie’s body was on the verge of shattering. His supposedly indestructible skin was now drenched in blood, and it was a horrible sight to behold.

“Blacky! !”Granny Qin’s eyes immediately burst into tears!

Qin Yu was not a soft-hearted person. He took a step forward and punched Blacky’s body again!

With this punch, Blacky could not stand up at all.

His internal Qi was rapidly weakening, and his entire body was on the verge of shattering!

“You’ve lost,”Qin Yu said coldly as he looked at Blacky, who had already lost consciousness.

Granny Qin, who was not far away, shouted angrily, “He has already lost. Let Him Go!”

Qin Yu glanced at Granny Qin, who was not far away, and said with a grin, “He has indeed lost, but do you think it’s possible for me to let him go?”

After saying that, Qin Yu lifted blacky up in his hand.

Granny Qin said angrily, “What do you want to do! He has already lost. Do you want to exterminate him?”

Qin Yu sneered, “I don’t know how the Jingdu Martial Arts Association brainwashed you, but I think even if I win, you won’t take me to the secret realm, right?”

Granny Qin was instantly stunned.

Just as Qin Yu said, even if Qin Yu won, she wouldn’t take Qin Yu to the secret realm!

Even if she had to use her spiritual sense, she would protect the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s Secret!

“It seems that I was right.”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

“I have to admire the brainwashing ability of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Granny Qin roared, “Qin Yu, what exactly do you want to do? If you want to kill me, then kill me!”

Qin Yu glanced at her and sneered, “Before you take me to the secret realm, I won’t let him go. Take Yan Ruoxue in exchange for him!”
