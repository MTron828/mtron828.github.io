2189 The Fusion of the Two Dao Techniques

In this grand battle, Wu Ji‚Äôs and Qin Yu‚Äôs dao techniques continuously intertwined and influenced each other. The clash of their powers resulted in terrifying energy ripples, and the surrounding space began to distort.

Wu Ji‚Äôs dao technique emanated an incomparably vast internal qi like an ancient and mysterious power. His figure loomed among the collapsed peaks like a real immortal.

Qin Yu‚Äôs dao technique displayed an incomparably fiery and fanatic power. His body continued expanding as energy surged and turned into a massive mountain peak standing on the battlefield.

The clash of their powers caused a terrifying energy storm. Intense air currents raged on the battlefield, destroying everything in the surroundings. Mountains collapsed, rivers flowed backward, and stars exploded, creating a chaotic scene!

At this moment, even the massive sharp blade that rose from the ground behind Qin Yu‚Äôs back was constantly trembling!

The two stopped moving, raised their hands, and looked as if they were standing still.

The only thing that could tell the two were still fighting was the worlds behind them that constantly fought against each other!

The two worlds fought against each other with all their might, giving off tremendously terrifying sounds. The two worlds sometimes advanced and sometimes were forced to retreat. Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

It was a battle between the two dao techniques. It was not as simple as an ordinary battle!

Even a True Saint could not reach this stage!

The clash between Qin Yu and Wu Ji grew increasingly intense in this heart-pounding battle and evolved into an even more magnificent scene.

Wu Ji‚Äôs dao technique contained an incomparably mysterious power. His figure looked like a towering mountain range, standing tall on the battlefield. His eyes were deep and calm, like being infused with the universe‚Äôs secrets.

As for Qin Yu, the dao technique displayed a blazing passion and fearless battle intent. His body turned into an immense ray of light like a burning flame. His eyes flickered with determination as if he wanted to ignite the entire world.

The clash of their powers triggered an even more terrifying energy storm. The air on the battlefield burned, and the spatial cracks expanded with the boundless power. Mountains collapsed, rivers churned, stars exploded, and everything turned chaotic.

The sharp blade on Qin Yu‚Äôs back trembled violently, making an ear-piercing sound. It seemed to have sensed Qin Yu‚Äôs battle intent and determination and thus became sharper and more dangerous.

‚ÄúRumble‚Ä¶‚Äù

A terrifying explosion spread, and the world behind Qin Yu seemed to have pushed back.

However, the next moment, the world behind Qin Yu emitted an even more terrifying light, pushing Wu Ji‚Äôs dao technique back in one go.

The clash between the two parties continued relentlessly, back and forth, hundreds of times. At times, Qin Yu gained the upper hand, and at times Wu Ji did.

This grand battle was getting increasingly more intense. Wu Ji‚Äôs and Qin Yu‚Äôs power intertwined into a magnificent painting scroll. Their bodies flickered, and tremendous power would release each time they clashed.

Wu Ji‚Äôs gaze revealed a hint of calmness and composure. His dao technique displayed an ancient and mysterious power. He transformed into a towering mountain standing proudly on the battlefield. He seemed to have fused with the earth.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, displayed an incomparably fiery and fanatic power. His body turned into a massive flame, burning with endless battle intent. His fists were incomparably formidable, with the explosion of energy accompanying each strive.

The two‚Äôs powers intertwined, triggering an even more terrifying energy storm. The energy on the battlefield surged and rolled, forming a chaotic scene. Mountains collapsed, rivers flowed in reverse, and stars exploded. The world seemed to have fallen into a catastrophe of doomsday.

The sharp blade on Qin Yu‚Äôs back trembled violently, making an ear-piercing sound. It seemed to have sensed Qin Yu‚Äôs battle intent and determination and became sharper and more dangerous!

The clash persisted for a couple of hundred days, and the two remained motionless like they were transcending mortal existence. They were in a stalemate, unwavering and still.

In the blink of an eye, another several hundred days passed by. Qin Yu‚Äôs tribulation this time lasted for ten years or so!

No one knew how long the clash between the two parties would last. Even the sky had become stagnant. Everything was affected by the two‚Äôs dao techniques!

These were the dao techniques they had created themselves. It was unprecedented and rare!

Qin Yu‚Äôs dao technique became clearer. Instead of saying it was a tribulation or a clash, it was a comprehension of the dao techniques that were Wu Ji‚Äôs inheritance!

Finally, on this day, the clash seemed to have been distorted!

The massive world behind Qin Yu began to expand rapidly!

That world expanded increasingly, and the background expanded infinitely, almost swallowing Wu Ji‚Äôs world completely!

The world continued to expand and soon began to devour the world behind Wu Ji!

The surrounding scenery kept changing. Everything turned into the scene of the world behind Qin Yu!

It was a remarkable spectacle! Qin Yu‚Äôs dao technique seemed to be devouring Wu Ji‚Äôs dao technique!

Or rather, Qin Yu was fusing with Wu Ji‚Äôs dao technique!

Wu Ji, who closed his eyes all the while, opened them at this moment. His face revealed a relaxed expression. The murderous aura and battle intent earlier on had disappeared, and an immensely relaxing expression replaced them!

Wu Ji had done it deliberately. Not only did he guide Qin Yu to comprehend his own dao technique, he even completely fused his own dao technique with Qin Yu!

The world behind Qin Yu expanded at a terrifying speed, swallowing Wu Ji‚Äôs world. The clash and fusion of the two worlds created an incomparably magnificent spectacle.

Wu Ji‚Äôs world began to dissolve gradually. The mountains, rivers, forests, and lakes merged into the world behind Qin Yu. Wu Ji‚Äôs power of the dao technique was absorbed by Qin Yu, becoming a part of his dao technique!

Qin Yu‚Äôs world became increasingly vast. Boundless mountain ranges and vast plains gathered the power of the two worlds. Strange runes and lights flickered in the sky like the revelation of the dao technique.

The entire battlefield was covered by this massive world, and every corner was filled with a thick aura of the dao technique. The energy storm weakened, and the battlefield became quiet as if celebrating the birth of this new world.

Everything quieted down. Only Qin Yu and Wu Ji looked at each other in the entire world.

Qin Yu fully understood. All of this was guided by Wu Ji. Otherwise, Qin Yu would have died millions of times in this heavenly tribulation!

In the next moment, Wu Ji‚Äôs divine robe of Qin Yu that had disappeared now reappeared on Qin Yu‚Äôs body.

The only thing that disappeared was Qin Yu‚Äôs Traceless Immortal Scripture.

The correct way to comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture was to fuse the two‚Äôs dao techniques. At this moment, Qin Yu completely understood.

Wu Ji‚Äôs figure slowly disappeared. His body remained tall, and he still had that invincible image.

Wu Ji‚Äôs figure gradually became blurred as if it had merged with the surrounding world. His form slowly faded, leaving only a faint trace of the phantom behind.
