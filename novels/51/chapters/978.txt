Chapter 979: Chapter 979, the masked woman appeared?

This was the fourth slash of the nine absolute beginning slashes! It was also the first time Qin Yu had tried to use it!

An even sharper sword ray appeared in the sky. Qin Yu held the sword with both hands and soared through the sky.

Under the contrast of the sword ray, Qin Yu looked like a God!

His clothes had been shattered, and blood flowed down his body bit by bit. However, the determination on his face did not decrease in the slightest!

Looking at this even more powerful sword ray, everyone stood up one after another!

Under the explosion of this internal QI, gusts of wind blew up at the scene. It was as if even the clouds in the sky had been affected!

Qin Yu glared angrily at the white bones below. With a roar, he gripped his sword with both hands and ruthlessly slashed at the white bones!

The white bones still raised its hands to receive the attack. It did not know what fear was at all!

“Swish!”

The bronze sword hummed. Under the control of Qin Yu’s hands, it ruthlessly slashed towards the white bone!

At the moment of collision, the bronze sword pierced through white bone and slashed downwards!

“Boom!”

The sword smashed onto the ground, and White Bone’s two palms were also cut off by Qin Yu’s sword!

Hiss...

The scene could hear the sounds of gasps.

Qin Yu... actually cut off white bones’arms?

One had to know that this was something that even star harvester couldn’t do!

Qin Yu held the bronze sword, breathing heavily.

Internal Qi and the fourth slash were both extremely stressful for him, and his aura was rapidly declining.

Above, Yan Jinyao’s face was gloomy.

“It must be that sword!”Yan Jinyao said coldly.

“Either it’s the problem with his technique or the battle word formula!”

“I have to think of a way to get the battle word formula!”

At this moment, Tian Xuehong’s expression was extremely cold.

He never expected that a mere qin yu could actually hurt his white bone army!

“Bang!”

At this moment, Qin Yu, who was gasping for breath, was kicked away by the white bones.

At the same time, two more white bones walked forward.

Looking at these two white bones, everyone felt despair.

Qin Yu risked his life, but only managed to cut off two of his arms.

And the Heavenly Blood Rainbow had dozens of white bones!

This disparity in strength made people feel despair.

Qin Yu tried to get up, but he found that he had no strength left in his body.

He grabbed the sword in an attempt to stand up, but he failed again and again.

The Sky Blood Rainbow walked towards Qin Yu Step by step.

He looked down at Qin Yu with a trace of disgust and anger on his face.

“You actually hurt my bones. It’s unbelievable,”said the Sky Blood Rainbow coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t have the mood to pay attention to the sky blood rainbow. He struggled to stand up.

However, before Qin Yu could get up, the Sky Blood Rainbow had already stepped on Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu, who was already lacking in internal QI, instantly did not have the strength to stand up after this kick.

“Qin Yu, you have successfully angered me,”said the Sky Blood Rainbow coldly.

“I will let you know the price of my anger.”

After saying this, the Sky Blood Rainbow’s eyes suddenly glared. A martial artist not far away was instantly drawn out of his spiritual sense, and his body violently fell to the ground!

Without waiting for everyone to be afraid, Tian Xuehong waved his hand again and drew out another martial artist’s spiritual sense!

“Stop!”Qin Yu’s eyes widened when he saw the situation!

However, Tian Xuehong stepped firmly on Qin Yu and sneered, “I will let you know the price of resisting me! You Bunch of maggots, you actually dare to resist!”

“You F * cking... Stop!”Qin Yu roared angrily.

However, the Sky Blood Rainbow didn’t care about Qin Yu. He reached out with his palm and could absorb a person’s spiritual sense!

The people at the scene instantly went crazy, wailing and screaming non-stop.

Despair made them lose their rationality. They were like headless flies, running around randomly.

It was as if this could give them a glimmer of life.

“All of you sit there!”

Tian Xuehong let out an angry roar, and several white bones rushed over!

That powerful pressure made everyone’s bodies stiffen. They stood on the spot, not even daring to breathe!

The scene was terrifyingly quiet.

Everyone’s hearts were entangled by despair.

Some people shed tears, while others fell to the ground, trembling.

Tian Xuehong laughed coldly. He bent down and looked down at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, aren’t you very strong? Fine, I’ll start with you,”Tian Xuehong said coldly.

He stretched out his palm, and three evil ghosts appeared and pounced on Qin Yu’s head!

These evil ghosts penetrated Qin Yu’s brain, wanting to extract Qin Yu’s spiritual sense.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. The Golden Man in his mind erupted with power and formed a confrontation with this evil ghost!

“Oh?”

Seeing this scene, Tian Xuehong was even more shocked.

In just a few days, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense had become so much stronger?

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, Tie Dan in his mind made a move and directly cut off the evil spirit’s palm!

The three evil spirits lying on Qin Yu’s head instantly disappeared without a trace.

Tian Xuehong immediately frowned.

“Such powerful divine sense?”

Tian Xuehong refused to believe it. He condensed three evil ghosts again and rushed toward Qin Yu.

Unfortunately, he failed in the end.

“Damn it!”

Tian Xuehong immediately became even angrier.

He lowered his head to look at Qin Yu and said, “You are really a shocking guy. It seems impossible for me to extract your divine sense with my methods.”

“But don’t be happy too early. When the spell of the immortal slaying sect lands on you, you won’t be able to escape even if you have great abilities!”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. Tie Dan in his mind also muttered, “If it’s the power of the eight light pillars, even I can’t stop them.”

At this moment, Tian Xuehong looked around and sneered, “Since I can’t extract your spiritual sense, I’ll start with them.”

“I want you to witness how they died in front of you!”

With that, the sky blood rainbow waved his hand and another warrior fell to the ground!

As long as the sky blood rainbow raised his hand, one warrior would definitely fall to the ground!

In just a few minutes, five warriors had died in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was furious, but there was nothing he could do.

That feeling of helplessness made Qin Yu feel a level of despair.

The hearts of the people present were in extreme pain.

They were all afraid. They were afraid that the next person to be extracted would be them.

“Let me out quickly! Quickly!”Tie Dan’s urging voice kept ringing in Qin Yu’s mind.

His voice was filled with anxiety, as if he couldn’t wait to control his body.

Qin Yu laughed bitterly in his heart.

Was he really going to let him out?

“Hahahaha!”

Tian Xuehong’s arrogant voice echoed in the martial arts hall.

“No one in the world can stop me! Once I absorb all of you, I will definitely return to my peak!”Tian Xuehong laughed maniacally.

“Quickly let me out, quickly!”Tie Dan was so anxious that he was about to curse. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, at this moment, Tian Xuehong’s laughter suddenly stopped.

Sweat unconsciously appeared on his forehead.

A strong sense of danger filled Tian Xuehong’s heart.

Not only Tian Xuehong, but everyone present felt their hearts palpitate.

No one could stop the physical fear that came from their bodies!

“Who? !”

Tian Xuehong looked around in fear, his eyes filled with panic.

At this moment, a beautiful figure slowly appeared in the air.

She wore a mask, and her entire body was emitting an ice-cold aura that made people shudder.
