He teng sneered, “I don’t think you’re a kind-hearted person. Why? You killed an ant, and you want me to explain?”

Yong Ji frowned slightly. Of course, he didn’t care about the life and death of such a person. It was just that after this incident, he was a little more wary of he teng. That was all.

“Since we know Qin Yu’s location, let’s set off.”Yong Ji changed the topic.

“To be on the safe side, it’s better to call a few more people. No matter what, we can’t let him escape again.”

He teng sneered and said, “I can do it alone.”

After saying that, his palm shook and he directly took out the white bone club.

Looking at this big club, Yong Ji immediately understood.

“So the hunter organization’s white bone staff is in your hands.”Yong Ji’s eyes showed a hint of greed.

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “You’d better not have any ideas about this white bone staff, or I can’t guarantee what I will do.”

After saying that, he teng turned around and left.

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and looked at he teng coldly, his heart emitting a hint of killing intent.

Master Zheng Yang had already refined Qin Yu for three whole days.

During these three days, his mental energy had been greatly exhausted. His entire person looked somewhat dispirited.

To master Zheng Yang, a divine weapon only needed two days at most to be completed.

However, Qin Yu’s physical body was like a heavenly treasure. It was like a divine weapon that had received a great improvement.

“No, I need to rest.”Master Zhengyang retracted his hand and wiped the sweat from his forehead.

“It just so happens that this flame needs to be changed.”

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly. He circulated his meridian circulation technique and his body was slowly recovering.

“How many days has it been?”Qin Yu asked.

“Three days,”master Zhengyang answered truthfully.

Qin Yu felt the state of his body, and then whispered, “According to this progress, it will take at most ten days to complete.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at master Zheng Yang and said, “I will only give you half a day to rest. During this half a day, you have to find enough flames.”

Master Zheng Yang quickly waved his hand and said, “Half a day is not enough. If I act rashly, it is very likely that I will destroy your body. Haste makes waste.”

These words made some sense.

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then took out a pill from the spatial magic artifact and handed it to Master Zhengyang.

“Eat this pill. Your vitality and mind will recover very quickly,”said Qin Yu.

Master Zhengyang took the pill and smiled wryly, “Why are you in such a hurry? This kind of thing...”

“Alright, stop talking nonsense. Go look for it now,”Qin Yu interrupted Master Zhengyang.

Master Zheng Yang couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu, so he had no choice but to agree.

After he left, Qin Yu went all the way to Xiao Cao’s room.

At this time, Xiao Cao was still in a deep sleep. Her strength was weak, so she couldn’t withstand the effects of the medicine at all.

For three whole days, she was still unconscious.

“Fortunately, I didn’t do anything. Otherwise... I would really be a sinner for all eternity.”Qin Yu sighed.

Not only did he destroy Xiaocao, but he had also let Yan Ruoxue down.

He caressed the jade pendant hanging in his arms, and his mind instantly became much more stable.

It was evening, and Master Zhengyang had finally returned.

He didn’t know where he had gone to have a good time. His face was Red, and his previous dejection had been swept away.

“How was it? Did you bring them back?”Qin Yu asked.

Master Zhengyang patted his chest and said, “Of course! Don’t worry, I brought enough flames this time!”

Qin Yu sized up master Zhengyang and asked curiously, “Where did you go? Why do you look so energetic?”

Master Zhengyang’s face turned red, and then he said with a smile, “I went out to find a widow...”

Qin Yu was immediately speechless. This old thing was really not serious.

“Speaking of which, I quite admire you. You actually did nothing under the effects of the Spring Heart Pill. TSK TSK.”Master Zhengyang sighed.

Qin Yu said with a dark expression, “Stop talking nonsense. Let’s quickly start.”

Master Zhengyang did not dare to say anything more and hurriedly began the second round of refinement.

...

City after city in the southern region fell. Tens of millions of people died at the hands of the northern cultivators.

As the picture scroll was absorbed, the elementalists’strength grew stronger!

The huge snow mountain in the center of the northern region seemed to be slowly melting and collapsing!

Huge ice rocks rolled down from the iceberg one after another with a loud bang!

Meanwhile, the aura of the elementalists in Teng men’s internal Qi was also rapidly increasing!

“It won’t be long before I can fully recover.”There was a hint of greed in the elementalists’eyes.

“Once I fully recover, let alone a small southern region, no one will be able to stop me in the entire Li Region!”

“Back then, Xiao Sheng tried to unify the entire Li region, but he was blocked by the river of death. Now, the river of death is disappearing. When that time comes, I will definitely complete it for him...”

...

He Teng and Yongji were rushing towards weapon refining city.

Along the way, the two of them were silent, as if they were strangers.

“What do you think the strength of the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect is?”He Teng suddenly asked.

Yong Ji glanced at he teng and sneered, “He was once known as the number one genius in the world. What do you think?”

“Genius? After cultivating to such a realm, which one of us isn’t a genius?”He Teng didn’t think much of it.

Yong Ji sighed slightly and then sighed, “Yes, but there is still a gap between geniuses, just like you and Qin Yu.”

As soon as he said this, he Teng’s face immediately turned cold.

“Although you are unhappy, you have to admit that Qin Yu is indeed stronger than you, even if you think so in your heart.”Yong Ji continued to ridicule.

He Teng said with a black face, “Yong Ji, are you provoking me?”

“Of course not. You are the godly king of the northern lands. How would I dare to provoke you?”Yong Ji said with a strange tone.

The killing intent on he Teng’s body grew stronger. He suddenly stopped and turned to look at Yong Ji.

“You seem to be very unconvinced,”he teng said with narrowed eyes.

Yong Ji was not inferior. He said coldly, “Convinced? I used to be the number two figure in the South Province. I almost won the South Province!”

“And you? I don’t know which mountain you came from, but now you are above me. Why should I be convinced?”

The more Yong Ji spoke, the more agitated he became. He glared at he teng and shouted, “This place is no one’s territory. If I kill you, no one will know!”

“As long as you die, the godly king will be mine!”

He Teng’s body emitted an extremely cold internal Qi. He smiled sinisterly and said, “The people living in the dream are really pitiful. On account that you still have some use, I will break your dream today.”

“I will use my actions to tell you that you are nothing. Not only are you not the number two figure in the South Province, you are not even number three, number four, or number ten!”
