1873 I Believe Him

The Tong family, an aristocratic family in Zhongzhou, was destroyed.

Qin Yu and the others rushed back to the Demon-slaying Peak.

In this battle, some people’s bodies were shattered, and some people died.

18 people went, and 16 people returned.

This made Qin Yu extremely uncomfortable. Although it was a mission from Demon-slaying Peak, Qin Yu knew that this was his personal matter.

But Qin Yu had no choice. In order to save Jue Wu, he could give up everything. Even if he was the one who died, he would still go.

“Alright, don’t think too much.” The peak master seemed to have read Qin Yu’s mind. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and comforted him.

“I know,” Qin Yu said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Then, Qin Yu returned to the cave with Jue Wu.

He hurriedly took out his cauldron and planned to refine a pill for Jue Wu.

But Jue Wu quickly stopped Qin Yu’s behavior. She waved her hand and said, “If you really want the best for me, then go to the forest and hunt for me. Damn it, I haven’t eaten for so many days, I’m so hungry.”

Hearing Jue Wu’s words, Chang Mang was dumbfounded.

He pulled Qin Yu aside and said in a low voice, “Could this guy be a man who has taken over the body of this Little Lolita?”

“F*ck you, you’re the f*cking man!” Jue Wu cursed.

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He waved his hand and said, “That’s Jue Wu’s character. Alright, stop asking. Hurry up and buy some wine.”

“Alright,” he said. Chang Mang nodded.

Chang Mang was in charge of buying wine, while Qin Yu was in charge of hunting in the forest.

In a short while, Qin Yu had caught a few huge wild beasts. He used the spiritual fire to roast them for Jue Wu.

By the time Qin Yu was done roasting, Chang Mang had also returned from buying wine.

Qin Yu hurriedly cut off the meat for Jue Wu and fed her.

Jue Wu ate and drank at the same time.

Chang Mang, who loved to eat and drink, also joined the ‘battle’.

Jue Wu and Chang Mang’s personalities were somewhat similar, and the two of them quickly got along.

The dining table was filled with laughter. Jue Wu and Chang Mang ate to their heart’s content, but it was difficult for Qin Yu.

At the same time, in Zhongzhou.

The news of the Tong family’s destruction spread very quickly.

Although the Tong family was not considered a top family, they had once been glorious and had a great reputation in Zhongzhou.

The destruction of the Tong family still caused quite a stir.

“Tsk, tsk. The Tong family has existed for tens of thousands of years. They just disappeared like that.”

“That’s right. It’s said that the Tong family used all their hidden power, but they still couldn’t escape the end of destruction.”

“Do you know who did it?”

“I heard that it’s the Demon-slaying Peak of Thunder Courtyard.”

“What a load of nonsense. It’s someone called Qin Yu. It’s said that the Tong family and Qin Yu have a deep grudge.”

“Qin Yu? Who is he? Why have I never heard of him?”

“There are always new talents in every generation. It’s normal that you haven’t heard of him.”

All of a sudden, Qin Yu’s name gained a little fame in Zhongzhou.

…

In a cluster of cities in Zhongzhou.

This place was extremely prosperous, and the spiritual energy was incomparably dense.

There were no weaklings who could live here. Families of all sizes were in great numbers, and they all had extremely good resources.

Above these cities of all sizes, there were many auspicious clouds.

On a closer look, there seemed to be mountains on the auspicious clouds.

This mountain range seemed to be man-made. It was majestic and not dazzling, but it was full of momentum.

This mountain range belonged to one of the most famous aristocratic families in the Holy Region, the Yan family.

At this moment, a young girl was cultivating on a quiet mountain in the Yan residence.

This small mountain was a Mystic Realm of the Yan family, and it was an extremely important Mystic Realm.

At this moment, an old man walked in from outside.

He stood beside the girl and said in a low voice, “Miss, Qin Yu has come to Zhongzhou again.”

Upon hearing this, the originally calm young lady’s body trembled slightly.

She turned around and looked at the old man. She said in surprise, “Where is he?”

“He has already gone back to Thunder Courtyard.” The old man continued.

The girl was even more surprised. She stood up and said, “Uncle Yan, why did he suddenly come to Zhongzhou?”

“Miss Yan,” Uncle Yan sighed, “Qin Yu didn’t keep a low profile as you expected. On the contrary, he did something very high-profile as soon as he came to Zhongzhou.”

“What is it?” Yan Ruoxue hurriedly asked.

...

“He crushed the Tong family,” Uncle Yan said with a bitter smile.

“The Tong family?” Yan Ruoxue furrowed her brows. She seemed unfamiliar with this place.

“Yes, they used to be a rather famous aristocratic family,” Uncle Yan explained.

Uncle Yan then told Yan Ruoxue everything he knew.

“As far as I know, Qin Yu seemed to have done this for a woman.” Uncle Yan said in a deep voice.

“A woman?” Yan Ruoxue wasn’t too surprised. She smiled and said, “Is she Qin Yu’s friend?”

“That’s right, to the outside world, they are indeed friends.” Uncle Yan nodded.

Then, Uncle Yan said in confusion, “Miss, aren’t you worried that Qin Yu will have second thoughts?”

Upon hearing this, Yan Ruoxue smiled confidently and said, “He won’t, he definitely won’t.”

“That’s true. Who can be compared to you, miss?” Uncle Yan smiled.

Yan Ruoxue stood up and said in a serious tone, “No, it has nothing to do with me. I just believe that Qin Yu would not do such a thing.”

...

Uncle Yan opened his mouth, not knowing what to say.

He had originally wanted to ask if he needed to send someone to get rid of Jue Wu. But after hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words, it seemed that there was no need to ask.

“Miss, Qin Yu is so high-profile. I think it won’t be long before he gets the attention of all the big families. After all, he’s the second one with the chaotic body.” Uncle Yan said in a deep voice.

“When that time comes, he will have to face Si Shiyue.”

Yan Ruoxue took a deep breath and said, “I hope this day will come a little later.”

…

Demon-slaying Peak.

Jue Wu ate from day to night, and then from night to morning.

Even Chang Mang would not be able to take such an appetite.

“I can’t, I can’t,” he said, waving his hand. “You’re like a f*cking pig. I can’t eat anymore.”

“You’re the one who’s like a f*cking pig, I’ll beat you to death!” Jue Wu was about to beat him up, but she had less than half of her arm left, so she could only shake her little arm weakly.

Seeing this, Qin Yu felt even sadder.

He quickly picked up a piece of meat and stuffed it into Jue Wu’s mouth. He smiled bitterly and said, “Hurry up and eat. If you eat more, your body will recover faster.”

In the next few days, Qin Yu’s daily work was to help Jue Wu hunt and then feed her.

After a full eight days.

Jue Wu didn’t stop eating and drinking. What was surprising was that Jue Wu’s four limbs were actually slowly growing back.
