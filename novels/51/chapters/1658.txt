Chapter 1659: Chapter 1,659, self-resurrection! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It wasn’t just the elementalists. No one present believed it.

No one had expected Qin Yu to be so powerful!

Just how confident was he? Even the phenomenon he condensed was his own!

This was a true heaven’s pride, a True Dao demonstrator!

Countless people seemed to have seen the future Qin Yu, who would be unrivalled and suppress the world!

“This is merely a spell that you condensed yourself. You are not a true important figure of the immortal slaying sect. You are the weak one.”Qin Yu’s tone was extremely cold as he crushed the pride of the elementalist on the ground.

The elementalist flew into a rage as he charged towards Qin Yu for the third time.

The third collision between the two parties could be said to be earth-shattering as it shattered everything!

A powerful radiance shot into the sky. No matter how far apart the internal Qi was, it could still be felt!

At this moment, Qin Yu was too powerful. Almost no one could withstand that conceited punch, and the elementalists were no exception!

Under Qin Yu’s overbearing attitude, he was defeated again and again, and that figure also became dimmer and dimmer!

“Qin Yu... is really too strong!”

“I’m afraid that no one in the younger generation can compete with him!”

“His talent is definitely not inferior to those top-notch geniuses in the Central Plains!”

In the dark, he teng and Yongji’s expressions were terrifyingly cold.

How long had it been? Qin Yu could already be compared to elementalists in their younger days, so how could they be able to contend against him!

“Qin Yu...”Yongji clenched his fists. He was extremely regretful. He regretted not getting rid of Qin Yu earlier!

Meanwhile, he teng remained silent. No one knew what he was thinking about.

Seconds and minutes passed. The battle between the two of them was like two small worlds colliding. It was extremely resplendent.

Before the battle ended, no one dared to make a hasty conclusion. No one knew if the elementalists had any other tricks up their sleeves.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s fists that shattered the heavens and earth forced the elementalists back once again!

At this moment, the Elementalist’s internal Qi was extremely dim, and his aura was no longer as strong as before. Everything seemed to have been destined.

Today, the Elementalist would definitely be defeated!

“You are truly a genius. You are the most talented person I have ever met.”The elementalist was not stingy with his praise.

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. He did not appreciate Qin Yu’s kindness at all, and the murderous aura on his body did not diminish in the slightest.

“Although I know that it’s impossible, I still can’t help but ask you if you’re willing to join my northern lands,”the elementalist said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Since you know that it’s nonsense, why do you have to ask?”

The elementalist’s expression became colder and colder. A material radiance erupted from his eyes, and it was extremely dazzling.

“Alright, since that’s the case, then you’d better die!”The elementalist’s expression suddenly became incomparably crazy!

As expected, the elementalist still had other trump cards!

His expression turned even crazier. His eyes were scarlet and extremely terrifying!

Anyone could feel that the elementalist was currently casting some extremely powerful spell!

“Qin Yu!”The elementalist shouted.

“You’re right. This figure is only an illusory figure in my spell. It has nothing to do with that figure. Otherwise, no matter how powerful you are, you will still die!”

“However, how do you know that I can not use heaven-defying means to let him have a trace of internal Qi?”

A trace of internal Qi!

A trace of internal Qi from the important figure of the immortal slaying sect!

Hearing this, everyone turned pale with fright!

After all, the immortal slaying sect was the number one sect in the past. It was an unimaginably powerful sect!

Among them, there were many great cultivators at the tribulation stage. No one knew who this figure was or what realm he was in!

If he was a grand cultivator at the tribulation stage, even a wisp of internal Qi could destroy an entire world, let alone Qin Yu!

He was an existence that could easily crush countless planets!

“Hahahahaha!”The elementalist laughed maniacally. All the internal Qi on his body was gathering towards that figure!

At this moment, the elementalist seemed as though he was about to transform into a dao and began to dissipate!

“The Elementalist is planning to use his own life to revive a wisp of internal QI,”Xiao Sheng said coldly.

“Can his life revive the internal Qi of a grand cultivator at the tribulation stage? How is that possible?”The person beside him seemed to be extremely puzzled.

Xiao Sheng said coldly, “I’m afraid it’s some kind of contract spell.”

At this moment, Xiao Sheng could no longer remain calm. Once the internal Qi was truly revived, no one in this world, let alone Xiao Sheng, could withstand it!

“An elementalist’s youthful state will not affect his internal Qi, so he can sacrifice his own life to revive a wisp of his internal Qi,”Xiao Sheng said coldly.

After he finished speaking, he slowly stood up as if he had the intention to attack.

“Hahahahaha!”The elementalist laughed maniacally as his figure slowly disappeared!

At the same time, there seemed to be a change in the world. The entire world rumbled!

The earth shattered at this moment, and the sky was annihilated at this moment. It was as if this world was about to collapse!

This was the power of the top experts of the immortal slaying sect. Just the process of recovery was enough to annihilate an entire world. It was extremely terrifying!

Qin Yu’s expression became increasingly solemn. He looked at the mysterious person who was gradually materializing and had an extremely ominous premonition in his heart.

“Qin Yu, you’re dead meat!”The elementalist shouted coldly!

After saying this, his figure completely disappeared. What was left was only the scene of the four index numbers!

That figure also slowly became corporeal. Traces of black internal Qi quickly spread to the surroundings and wrapped around Qin Yu!

“It’s a domain!”Xiao Sheng immediately had a bad feeling!

He didn’t expect this figure to directly use the power of the domain to isolate outsiders!

Perhaps it was because of the restrictions between heaven and earth that the power of the domain had to appear, but no matter what, this was definitely not good news for everyone!

“Sect... sect leader, what’s going on? Will Qin Yu Be Okay?”The deputy sect leader and the others all looked at the sect leader.

The sect leader said in a deep voice, “It’s hard to say. If it’s the aura of a great cultivator at the tribulation stage, not many people in this world can resist it.”

“What? !”

As soon as he said this, everyone’s faces turned ashen.

Even the sect leader was so unconfident, let alone the others?

In the domain, Qin Yu was in complete darkness. Only the mysterious person was coldly staring at Qin Yu.

At this moment, it was as if he had gained his own consciousness. Every move he made caused the world to shatter!

Even a single look from him made Qin Yu feel as if his entire body was about to be torn apart! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He tried his best to resist, but he realized that the strength in his entire body was not even worth mentioning in front of him!

That kind of deep pressure made people feel an indescribable sense of despair. They were unable to even have the slightest desire to resist!

At this moment, that mysterious figure made his move. He slowly raised his palm. The killing intent that blotted out the sky and the earth was like a sea wave that blotted out the sky and the earth!

Qin Yu stared with his eyes wide open. Facing such a figure, he did not have the slightest ability to resist!

Just as he was about to give up, the bracelet that had been on his body all this while suddenly flashed and floated up naturally!
