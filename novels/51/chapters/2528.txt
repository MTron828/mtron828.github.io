2529 Water and Fire, Adversaries

The air current between heaven and earth began to surge rapidly. The clouds in the sky quickly gathered, forming an enormous vortex. The wind howled, and thunder and lightning interweaved. The entire battlefield was enveloped by this powerful aura.

These lights interweaved in the air like a rainbow, forming a dazzling fist of energy.

The energy of nearly 400 people gradually gathered, forming a dazzling beam of light.

The beam of light pierced the darkness and struck the gathering point of the flame spirits below the Gu family.

With a single strike, the terrifying energy directly destroyed these elite flame spirits, turning them into the purest demonic qi.

“What a terrifying joint attack!”

Gu Wanqing and the others who were rescued revealed shocked expressions on their faces. The flame spirits surrounding them were all elites.

There were even dozens of top-notch flame spirits with the power of tribulation.

Even though she activated her magic sword with all her might just now, she could not break through the ultimate flames that these flame spirits surrounded. She did not expect the Human Race Watch cultivators’ joint attacks to break them.

Qin Yu was tremendously shocked, too. Previously, he had only seen the joint attack of the monster race army.

This time, it was performed by their side, and this feeling was even more straightforward.

Moreover, he felt like becoming one with the energy just now as if he only needed a thought to trigger that energy of the joint attack.

Qin Yu frowned.

Could this be the effect of the complete version of the Brilliance of Stars and Moon? At this moment, only he, Lei Xin, and Flower Granny knew about this complete version of the cultivation method. It was very likely to be a similar cultivation method to Demon King Xiang Yu.

Qin Yu’s heart started to beat faster when he thought of Demon King Xiang Yu’s halberd.

Perhaps it was a big surprise his father had left for him.

The cultivators from the third peak of Thunder Courtyard and the members of the Jee family who were currently in the fourth grade and below, it was very likely that this kind of strength would become unimaginable if their strengths increased by cultivating the Brilliance of Stars and Moon.

“I’ll deal with Flame Demon first!”

Qin Yu retraced his messy thoughts, and his gaze fell upon the Flame Demon before his eyes.

He unleashed the Heart of the Ocean that expanded into a bright moon.

Numerous chains suddenly sounded, and water chains slowly extended from the waves.

“Go to hell, the human race!”

The Flame Demon’s face was full of rage, and his body turned into a blazing fireball.

An uncontrollable raging flame rose steadily as if it contained the power to destroy everything.

The water chains binding his body evaporated due to the high temperature, releasing a thick mist.

As Flame Demon smiled coldly, fire energy surged out of his body like ignited lava from a volcano and turned into a massive wave of fire that rushed in all directions.

The Heart of the Ocean suddenly descended and transformed into a tall woman before the Flame Demon.

“Flame Demon, die!”

A chilly voice sounded in the air, filled with immense fury.

“Torrent of Water!”

Massive water current was like a surging wave, rushing forward with a thunderous roar. Its waves splashed, spreading moisture and water vapor in all directions, filling the air with a moist internal qi.

The speed of the Torrent of Water was astonishing. It could quickly devour everything in its way. The enormous water current surged past, crushing the mountain rocks, uprooting the trees, and washing away the land barren and desolate.

This power was unstoppable, and any living beings or objects caught within would face the fate of being destroyed.

“Retreat!”

Qin Yu was instantly shocked. All of this was the actions of the Heart of the Ocean.

It seemed to have a deep-seated hatred against Flame Demon.

One party was water and the other fire.

The two terrifying powers intertwined, and the terrifying mist storm stirred up a massive gale.

For a moment, Qin Yu could not interfere.

“The Heart of the Ocean seemed to have been activated by its artifact spirit. Do you know what’s going on?”

Qin Yu asked Gu Wanqing with a wry smile. He did not master this celestial artifact, so perhaps the Gu family members knew the reason better.

“The artifact spirit of the Heart of the Ocean was formed from a wisp of the soul essence of the descendant of Fuxi, the Water God. This is the feud between the two powers themselves. The conflict between the Water God and the Flame Demon in the past had led to an epic war. The Water God represents natural order and harmony, while the Flame Demon embodies destructive and chaotic forces. It seems to be the destiny of the two powers themselves.”

This was also the first time Gu Wanqing had seen the Heart of the Ocean activated by the artifact spirit.

“Qin Yu, can you lend a hand to the Heart of the Ocean?”

However, it was obvious that the power of the Chief of Flame, who had the body of a Flame Demon, was suppressing the Heart of the Ocean. In the world of water and fire, the light of the flames gradually gained the upper hand.

“Of course!”

Qin Yu stared fixedly at this Chief of Flame. Although the power that erupted from this demon living being was only at the initial stage of the Tribulation Fifth Level, Qin Yu was still shocked.

However, Qin Yu was unable to sense the source of its soul. In other words, the body of the Flame Demon in front of him was merely illusory.

Even if he directly broke this body, he could not kill this king of flame spirit.

Qin Yu activated his desolate divine eye. After careful inspection, he finally discovered that the true body of this flame spirit was actually in the deepest part of the Demon Flame Mountain Range.

“No wonder the human experts came to this area to fight countless times and even if they killed the King of Flame Demon and the flame spirits, new flame spirits would soon appear. It turns out that the true body is hidden in the depths of the mountain range. Today, I’ll make you disappear completely!”

The flame spirit race is tremendously vicious, especially fond of the flesh of human infants and young children.

Their level of cruelty surpassed even the most vicious people.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and lit up the soul that Evil Eye had absorbed.

Although the Ghostly Sword Evil Eye did not store much soul power, after absorbing Teng Zixu’s Heavenly Profound Energy, his soul was only short of a wisp to be able to sense the sea of destruction.

In an instant, Qin Yu sensed the violent sea of destruction.

The power of Fourth Level Soul Sinking poured into his fist.

“Great Destruction Technique!”

Qin Yu slammed his fist on the ground.

The power of destruction poured into the ground, and in an instant, the terrifying power caused countless cracks to appear on the ground.

As the destructive shockwave slowly spread out, the ground within thousands of feet of them no longer existed.

The bright red lava on the ground slowly flowed, and one after another, fire snakes continuously shuttled out from it.

Qin Yu stomped with one foot, and the lava beneath the ground was squeezed to both sides by that terrifying immense force.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
