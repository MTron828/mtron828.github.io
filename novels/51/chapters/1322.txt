Chapter 1323: Chapter 1,324, Kill! 

The Reckless Ah San held his long sword and charged at the green figures.

This creature was already strange and unpredictable. Now that Ah San’s spiritual power had been suppressed, how could he be a match for them.

“Idiot!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth and couldn’t help but curse.

He wanted to save Ah San, but once Qin Yu left, Wan ‘er, who was powerless, might be in danger.

“Clang!”

The sword in Ah San’s hand fiercely hacked at the mysterious creature’s body, creating sparks in an instant.

AH SAN’s expression immediately changed. He pulled back his long sword and took a look, only to find that the blade had already curled up.

“Come back quickly!”Qin Yu shouted.

Ah San wanted to retreat, but there was no chance at all. A green arm instantly stretched out and grabbed ah San in his hand.

His face instantly turned red. Due to the internal QI, he could not exert any strength and could not break free.

Ah San’s breathing became weaker, and his struggle also became weaker.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He looked at Wan ‘er beside him and said, “Miss Wan ‘er, wait for me here. Don’t go anywhere.”

Wan ‘er quickly nodded and said, “Okay, quickly go and save Ah San...”

Qin Yu did not say anything else. With a jolt of his feet, he instantly arrived in front of this mysterious creature.

At such a close distance, the terrifying feeling was even more intense.

Even Qin Yu felt terrified when he saw this face.

However, at this moment, ah San was about to die at any moment. Qin Yu did not have time to think. Divine power surged all over his body, and with a bang, he smashed his fist towards that mysterious creature.

Qin Yu’s strength was so great that this internal Qi had no effect on him at all.

Under this punch, the mysterious creature immediately felt pain. It took a few steps back, and its hand unconsciously loosened.

Qin Yu picked up Ah San with one hand and said coldly, “Are you stupid? What are you trying to do?”

Ah San got up from the ground and said in a panic, “Where is Miss Wan ‘er? where is she?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Go back and look after Wan ‘Er. Leave these few people to me.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the few creatures in front of him.

Their pupils were extremely calm. There was no sadness or joy, as if they had seen through everything in the world.

And this was the first time Qin Yu had seen this kind of creature. That mysterious feeling made people full of fear.

Qin Yu mobilized all the divine power in his body, and his two fists seemed to be in a daze.

“Swish!”

At that moment, the mysterious creature’s palm grabbed towards Qin Yu! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu snorted coldly. What he was least afraid of was close combat!

His right fist was clenched in an instant, facing that Green Claw!

“Bang!”

A loud sound.

The mysterious creature’s claw directly split open!

Qin Yu seized this opportunity, and his body leaped up. His fist was from top to bottom, fiercely hanging on his head!

This punch was almost all of Qin Yu’s strength, and it directly cracked his skull! His huge body also fell down.

The first mysterious creature was killed, but the remaining few people actually didn’t have any fluctuations.

They seemed to be one, but they seemed to be completely unrelated.

Qin Yu looked at these people coldly and said, “We only want to seek the life energy and don’t want to disturb everyone. But if you want to fight, I, Qin Yu, am not afraid.”

These mysterious creatures did not say a word. In the next second, they suddenly attacked together!

They had extremely fast speed and unimaginable strength.

Even Qin Yu appeared to be in a sorry state.

The sharp claws slashed across Qin Yu’s body, leaving bloody marks one after another.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He immediately activated the fighting word formula and clenched his fist to meet the attack.

In this thick fog, a great battle quietly broke out.

Qin Yu was like an undefeatable war god. Facing the attacks of several mysterious creatures, he was not at a disadvantage. On the contrary, the more he fought, the braver he became.

His body was left with many bloody scars. The sharp blade was too sharp. Qin Yu’s skin could not withstand it at all.

Not far away, ah San finally found Wan ‘er by relying on his memory.

“Miss Wan ‘er, are you okay...”Ah San said with a panicked look.

Wan ‘er said anxiously, “Where’s Qin Yu? where is he?”

Ah San opened his mouth and said in a low voice, “That thing is too terrifying. It’s as if it doesn’t belong to this world. Qin Yu... I’m afraid he’s doomed.”

Wan ‘ER’s expression changed drastically when she heard that.

She grabbed ah san and said, “You... quickly save him. He went to fight for you. You... quickly save him!”

Ah San gritted his teeth and said, “It’s useless even if I go. I’ll just give up my life for nothing. At most, I’ll bury him in glory.”

Wan ‘er slapped Ah San’s face when she heard that.

She looked at Ah San with hatred and said, “You Coward, I’ll Go if you don’t go!”

After saying that, wan ‘er walked straight forward.

Even though she couldn’t see clearly in front of her, she didn’t hesitate at all.

Ah San gritted his teeth and quickly caught up with Wan ‘Er.

But at this moment, a huge figure blocked in front of them.

The thick fog covered their faces and even their bodies.

Even though this figure was standing right in front of them, they were still unable to see through their faces.

“Not good!”AH SAN’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly blocked in front of Wan ‘Er.

However, at this moment, that huge figure fell heavily onto the ground, causing a loud bang to ring out.
