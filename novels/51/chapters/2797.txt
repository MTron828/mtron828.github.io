Chapter 2798: Story of the Little Boy and the Giant

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A hundred years was spent recovering from the pain brought by the punishment.

One could imagine what kind of technique this power was.

He estimated his strength was at least twice as strong as before in this incomplete Investiture of Gods, but this did not surprise him.

The cultivation and deduction were endless.

A surge of power in his body would help him deduce crazily with just a hint.

This feeling terrified him.

Everything came with a price, especially this kind of heaven-defying power.

If it was so precious, the number one kulapati and the head of the Alester family wouldn’t have shown fear when the Investiture of Gods’ power was released.

Looking at Smoker Xie’s current state, he was almost 100% sure he couldn’t escape.

“Smoker Xie, can you tell me a story?”

Qin Yu sorted out his messy thoughts a little.

“Sure. What do you want to hear? I’m bored here anyway, so I’ll take it as a thank you for this.”

Smoker Xie puked and lay down against a moss-covered rock.

The Nightmare Smoker Xie was doing the same thing not far away from him. It looked very strange.

“Come on, let’s shake hands.’

Smoker Xie extended his pipe and clinked it with his Nightmare.

Qin Yu was somewhat at a loss. Could this fellow have gone crazy?

“Is the story of the Investiture of Gods true?”

Qin Yu shook his head and asked.

Regardless of whether he could get out, he had to find out the information now.

Everything had to be done according to human nature before letting it be.

“The Primordial Chaos era was the strangest period. The Great Immortal, the Founding Master, and all sects and divine artifacts were involved. That was a completely different era from the ones that followed.”

Smoker Xie pondered for a long time before sorting out the messy content.

“Why is it different? It’s because we have no way to verify it. Even the documents left by the Immortal Emperor have never confirmed that the legends of the Primordial Chaos are real. However, a few legendary things would appear in the world from time to time in the chaos. Therefore, it makes people even more confused about whether the Primordial Chaos is real.”

“Haha! Anyway, I entered it through the power of Investiture of Gods today. It seems that this story is most likely true. However, I don’t know how much it has been tampered with. Only what we can know is left, or it’s deliberately made known to us.”

Qin Yu said with a smile.

Smoker Xie looked very relaxed. He spoke with his humor.

He would blow out smoke rings from time to time, giving Qin Yu a scholarly air.

His achievements would have been limitless if he hadn’t been apotheosized.

“Do you know what’s going on between us? I feel like I’m no longer me.”

Qin Yu asked after a long silence.

“Haha! Let me tell you a story.”

It seemed that no one had talked to him for a long time. He took a deep puff of his cigarette.

Smoke slowly spewed out from his nose. The thick smoke lingered on the ground for a long time, mesmerizing as a layer of clouds.

“Long ago, there was a genius little boy. He created a giant for some strange reason. This giant had easily helped him solve many things, including unimaginable powers that the little boy could not imagine. However, the little boy began to fear. He was afraid that he could not control this giant. He was afraid that he could not resist when the giant had other thoughts one day although he was the creator.”

Smoke swirled around the pipe. Smoker Xie sounded like he was telling a story. His voice made people feel sleepy.

“Therefore, he added a cage to the giant and a lock on it. The little boy thought he was smart enough to hide the key in a place no one knew about. He added a layer of security to himself in this way.”

“Can you guess if the giant can find the key? This is the story of the Investiture of Gods. ”

“Hahahaha!”

After Smoker Xie finished telling the story, he left immediately.

The person in the Primordial Chaos created this Investiture of Gods, which was the giant of the little boy. This giant easily solved many problems. “Is it my current state? I received some kind of power after entering here.”

If he continued cultivating here, he did not dare to imagine how strong he would become.

The Investiture of Gods used this power to create gods, gathering those extremely talented people here and nurturing them as giants to solve some problems.

However, problems arose when these top geniuses grew up here.

They fused, converged, and communicated here.

It formed a giant that even a little boy could not fight against.

If this giant wanted to go out, could he trick the little boy into giving him the key?

Qin Yu’s hair stood on end.

There was once an experiment on Earth.

It was to set up such a scene in an empty place.

Human traffickers took the ‘props’ they needed. Their mission was to lure the children to follow them.

The purpose of this experiment was to see how the child would respond.

However, not a single child could escape from the hands of the human traffickers in the experiment involving nearly 300 people.

Some human traffickers did not even need to use force to make the child leave with them.

The test results were too ridiculous.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Therefore, the researchers began to tutor the children and instill in them the knowledge they should not easily leave with strangers before the next test. After going through detailed training, the experiment was conducted again.

When the test results came out, everyone discovered a fact.

No matter how hard they tried, a child had almost no resistance when he encountered a human trafficker in a place where there was no external intervention.

The research team then placed the test in the bustling street.

Human traffickers also had a 70% success rate of taking children away.

In other words, no matter how smart a child was, he could not defeat an adult with superior intelligence in this kind of confrontation.

In other words, if what Smoker Xie said was true, the giants here should have left long ago.

As for the little boy who created this giant, his fate was self-evident.

Could it be that this was also related to the disappearance of the Primordial Chaos Era?

The history of the Primordial Chaos Era was still in a certain period in their world.

All the information disappeared..
