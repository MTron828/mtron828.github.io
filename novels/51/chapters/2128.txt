2129 The Day of the Path of Heaven Arrives

“Immortal Crane…” Qin Yu murmured.

Immortal Crane glanced at Qin Yu, then waved its hand and straightaway swallowed the cultivator into its stomach.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu felt even more uncomfortable in his heart.

As expected, Immortal Crane had become a demon race, and its cultivation method was similar to the demon race.

Immortal Crane appeared somewhat calm. He sat opposite Qin Yu and did not say a thing.

“Brother Crane, long time no see.” After hesitating for a while, Qin Yu walked forward and greeted him.

Immortal Crane still did not speak. He closed his eyes and seemed to be waiting for something.

Qin Yu frowned and was a little perplexed for a moment.

“There’s somebody here,” Immortal Crane said.

Qin Yu’s expression slightly changed. He immediately stood up and released his divine sense!

At this moment, another person walked in.

His figure was similar to Immortal Crane, but his internal qi was even colder.

And this person was none other than Xiao Sheng!

“Xiao Sheng, you…Why are you here?” Qin Yu hurriedly walked forward and asked.

Xiao Sheng was silent, but his face was full of bone-piercing coldness.

Qin Yu could sense that Xiao Sheng was unusual, and there was a trace of uneasiness in his heart.

“What happened?” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Xiao Sheng glanced at Qin Yu. A moment later, he said coldly, “I can’t find my brother.”

“Xiao Hai?” Qin Yu’s expression slightly changed.

Xiao Hai had also been hunted by the Si family back then, while Qin Yu had fled to the Donghuang.

From then on, there was no more news of Xiao Hai.

“Perhaps… Perhaps he has gone to the Crimson Moon Continent…” Qin Yu said somewhat without confidence.

“I’ve gone to the Crimson Moon Continent, but I couldn’t find him,” Xiao Sheng said coldly.

“If… If anything happens to my brother, I’ll ensure the entire Si family is buried with him!”

Although Xiao Sheng’s voice was low, it made people tremble!

Qin Yu opened his mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.

“Nothing will happen to Mr. Xiao. He miraculously survived in North Plain back then. He will definitely survive this time,” Qin Yu could only say in a low voice.

This matter had something to do with Qin Yu, so how could he not feel uncomfortable?

Xiao Sheng did not say anything, and he sat beside Immortal Crane.

Qin Yu seemed to have understood something. He walked forward and said, “You… Does this mean you’ve joined the demon race?”

Xiao Sheng glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “As long as I can avenge my brother, I’m willing to do anything.”

“Understood.” Qin Yu did not say much. This was Xiao Sheng’s dao technique, to begin with. Previously, he had said that everyone had the right to choose freely, and he was now fulfilling it.

“What about you?” At this moment, Immortal Crane suddenly spoke.

Qin Yu was startled. He said somewhat in surprise, “Brother Crane, you mean…You want me to join the demon race too?”

“That’s right. This seems to be your only choice now,” Immortal Crane said.

Qin Yu instantly felt conflicted.

Once he joined the demon race, it would mean he was the enemy of the entire human race, and there was no turning back.

But for Qin Yu in the current situation, joining the demon race was indeed a good choice.

Back then, Yan Ruoxue had also said she would seek refuge with Immortal Crane if she really could not make it.

“Let me decide when the day of the Path of Heaven ends,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“If something really happens to Brother Xiao Hai, I will help you no matter what.” After that, Qin Yu glanced at Xiao Sheng.

“Mmm,” Xiao Sheng responded and did not say anything else.

Then, the two did not stay any longer and quickly left.

Looking at the backs of the two, Qin Yu felt incredibly complicated n his heart. He knew his future path would not be smooth, regardless of whether he joined the demon race.

What made Qin Yu feel most conflicted was still Yan Ruoxue.

To Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue was willing to give up the Yan family’s abundant resources and follow him to wander around. Qin Yu could not let her become the public enemy of the human race. That was something that Qin Yu could not do.

The following time was waiting for the day of the Path of Heaven to arrive.

Perhaps it was because the day of the Path of Heaven was approaching that the following few days passed somewhat peacefully.

Sitting cross-legged, Qin Yu comprehended the increasingly dense dao technique and sensed the day of the Path of Heaven approaching.

The closer it was to the day of the Path of Heaven, the richer the dao technique became, and comprehending dao became simpler.

The day of the Path of Heaven was like a gift from the heavens, allowing cultivators more opportunities to break through.

Another three days went by.

The explosive dao technique had reached a terrifying level.

The entire world seemed to have become quiet at this moment. Every living being seemed to have felt the power of this formidable dao technique.

However, all of this was the calm before the storm.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He could feel the power in his body growing continuously.

Qin Yu did not let down her guard because of this, as he was clear that this was a sign the day of the Path of Heaven was about to arrive.

“The day of the Path of Heaven…” Qin Yu muttered. He could feel the power in his body surging endlessly as if it was about to overflow.

He closed his eyes and completely immersed himself in this process, trying to advance further in his cultivation at this moment.

The moment the day of the Path of Heaven was about to arrive, the dao technique in the void became visible to the naked eye.

Upon closer inspection, one seemed to be able to catch strands of thin golden threads in the void. Such a miraculous scene shocked everyone!

“Such a gushing dao technique is truly shocking.” Everyone could not help but sigh with emotion. Some even knelt on the spot as if worshipping the gift of the Path of Heaven.

“The day of the Path of Heaven has arrived!”

Someone’s shout shattered the serene atmosphere!

And on this day, the dao technique erupted to the extreme! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. His body trembled violently, and he instantly left the place.

On the street, everyone was rushing toward a specific place with crazy expressions.

Qin Yu did not know where the day of Path of Heaven would arrive. He wanted to ask, but no one paid attention to him.

Everyone was rushing in a specific direction, afraid they would fall behind.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, seemed calm and idle. He slightly closed his eyes as if thinking about something.

After that, Qin Yu raised his palm and sensed the dao technique in the air.

He slowly paced around in all directions and soon deduced it.

“I see.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and a smile appeared on his face.

This dao energy erupted, but it was different in every direction. In that case, where the day of the Path of Heaven would arrive must be the place with the densest dao energy.

Therefore, Qin Yu released his divine sense. As he captured the dao technique, he rushed forward with strides.
