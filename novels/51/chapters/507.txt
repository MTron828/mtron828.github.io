Chapter 508: 5,000-Year-Old Herbs Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Wei was about to come out of seclusion?

Hearing this news, everyone on the Martial Arts Forum was in an uproar again.

One after another, they began to guess Han Wei’s strength.

“Han Wei is also a famous genius in Jingdu. Since Yan Jinyao was able to step into the Martial Marquis Realm, he might be able to as well.”

“There will be drama next. The two great geniuses of Jingdu have released news at the same time. I wonder what Qin Yu will do.”

“Qin Yu’s talent shouldn’t be inferior to theirs. It’s just a matter of time. But who will give him time?”

“In just twenty days, how much time can Qin Yu have to improve?”

Looking at the news on the Martial Arts Forum, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little anxious.

He stood up and looked in the direction of the Pavilion Master’s building. He originally wanted to ask the Pavilion Master about the 5,000-year-old herbs.

But after thinking about it for a long time, he ultimately decided to cancel this plan.

If the Pavilion Master had news, she would definitely inform him.

...

In the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, many high-level officials gathered together.

This was the third high-level meeting held by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association this year.

And their meeting’s topic of discussion was the same.

That was Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu defeated a half-step Martial Marquis at the Inner Strength Grandmaster level. This isn’t good news.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“He is out of control. He will definitely become a hidden menace.”

“Either let him join the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, or get rid of him as soon as possible.”

“Do you think a person like him will obediently listen to our orders?”

The crowd fell into silence.

They were already beginning to feel fear towards Qin Yu’s growth.

Moreover, everyone in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had the same premonition:

Qin Yu’s rise was bound to bring trouble, even disaster, to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Let’s wait. There are still twenty more days. No matter what, we can’t let him leave Jingdu,” someone said in a low voice.

“That kid from the Han family won’t disappoint us.”

Qin Yu didn’t know that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had already set their sights on him.

At this moment, all he could think about was Han Wei’s wedding on the 9th of September.

At night, Qin Yu lay on the bed while tossing and turning, but was unable to fall asleep.

He simply sat up and ran to the courtyard of the Elder’s Residence to stare at the moon in the sky.

“The moon is an object of dense dark energy. If only I could swallow the moonlight, that would be great,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

But this crazy thought was quickly rejected by him.

“It’s been a long time since I’ve swallowed dark energy.” Qin Yu sighed slightly.

The treasures that had been unearthed were naturally countless.

Places like places where dark energy was prevalent were also abundant. If he were to travel for a long period of time, Qin Yu might be able to obtain some decent resources.

But time was running out.

Most of the martial arts resources in Pyro were in the hands of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

It was said that they possessed a set of information that clearly indicated where divine medicine would appear and where the treasures would be unearthed.

And it was precisely because of this that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had never lacked resources.

For the entire night, Qin Yu did not sleep a wink.

The next morning, Qin Yu was just about to eat breakfast when at this time, the door suddenly opened, and then the Pavilion Master slowly walked in.

“Pavilion Master!”

The moment he saw the Pavilion Master, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

The Pavilion Master walked straight to Qin Yu’s side and sat down. She said, “I’ve inquired.”

“How is it?” Qin Yu asked anxiously.

The Pavilion Master said in a deep voice, “Herbs that are five thousand years old are extremely rare. Even if there are, they are in the hands of a small number of people.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Do you mean... you want me to rob them?”

The Pavilion Master raised her eyebrows and asked, “Are you willing?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I’m not willing, but if I have to... it’s hard to say.”

The Pavilion Master couldn’t help but laugh.

She took out a map from her pocket and handed it to Qin Yu.

There was a location marked with red lines on the map, and the location was extremely remote.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “This is...”

“I asked someone to bring this out from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” said the Pavilion Master.

“It’s said that this is a Dragon Vein. There may be things you want there, even herbs that are beyond your imagination.”

“Dragon Vein?” Qin Yu was stunned.

Qin Yu had read about this in novels, but he had never seen it before.

It was said that the Dragon Vein was a sacred land where spiritual energy gathered. People born in the Dragon Vein were destined to be extraordinary all their lives.

“Pavilion Master, thank you very much.” Qin Yu took the map and bowed.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Don’t be happy too early. You are definitely not the only one going to such a place.”

“Moreover, those are the resources of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. If you appear, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association probably won’t let you off.”

“Also, although Gu Canghai has left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, he definitely won’t give up. If he kills you, there’s nothing I can do.”

Qin Yu grabbed the note, and a trace of solemnity flashed across his face.

He couldn’t help but think of Yan Ruoxue’s face and Han Wei’s arrogant face.

“I have no other choice.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Even if it’s a dangerous place, I still have to go.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t express her opinion. After a while, she stood up and said, “Take care of yourself.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

Just as the Pavilion Master was about to leave, Qin Yu took out the Three Pure Ancient Tree from the spatial artifact and handed it to the Pavilion Master.

“Pavilion Master, you can keep this for now,” Qin Yu said.

The Pavilion Master frowned slightly. She looked at Qin Yu and asked, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, “I’m afraid that if something happens to me during this trip, if I die, this Three Pure Ancient Tree will fall into the hands of others.”

“In that case, it’s better to leave it in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion for now. If I come back, I’ll look for you to get it.”

The Pavilion Master held the Three Pure Ancient Tree, then nodded and said, “Alright.”

“Then I’ll set off now,” Qin Yu stood up and said.

He held the map and studied it carefully.

The Dragon Vein was located in the northwest region. There were few people there, but the spiritual energy wasn’t dense.

The reason the Dragon Vein appeared was definitely because there were extraordinary treasures.

After bidding farewell to the Pavilion Master, Qin Yu left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and headed straight for the Dragon Vein.

At the same time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association also gathered a group of members.

These people were the elites of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! The weakest was at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm, and there were even several half-step Martial Marquises!

As the elites of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, they had extremely powerful cultivation techniques, and their strength was definitely not something that an ordinary half-step Martial Marquis could compare to!

Many of them were sent over by Jingdu’s aristocratic families and their statuses were noble.

And the person leading the team was none other than the vice president of the Martial Arts Association, Xia Hang!

“All of you are the elites of the Martial Arts Association. You are also the most important. And this time, the Dragon Vein must contain unimaginable treasures,” Xia Hang said coldly.

“So, all of you must seize this opportunity. Do you understand?”

Everyone shouted in unison, “Understood!”

Xia Hang nodded slightly, and a trace of undetectable desire appeared in his eyes.

Xia Hang had been at the half-step Martial Marquis Realm for many years and was only one step away from the Martial Marquis Realm!

Therefore, he also wanted to use the Dragon Vein to step into the Martial Marquis Realm!
