The better the quality of the jade, the greater the effect of the amulet.

Therefore, Qin Yu was determined to obtain this piece of jade.

“Seven million!” Very soon, someone continued to raise the price.

Without thinking, Qin Yu shouted, “Eight million!”

“Nine million!” At this moment, a young man sitting in the front row said coldly.

Qin Yu looked in his direction and saw that this young man had a handsome appearance and an ice-cold expression. Beside him stood an old man and a middle-aged man.

Qin Yu, wanting to probe the strength of these two people, released his internal qi.

Just as Qin Yu’s internal qi was about to touch that young man, his internal qi suddenly broke off, as if it was cut off by something!

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed! He hurriedly looked at that old man and saw that the old man was also looking at Qin Yu.

The corners of the old man’s mouth curled up into a sneer, and his gaze was even colder.

“This old man is definitely a practitioner,” Qin Yu thought inside.

This was the first time Qin Yu had encountered his internal qi being directly cut off!

His strength was probably beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

“What’s wrong?” Yan Ruoxue asked softly when she saw this.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

Then, Qin Yu raised his number plate and continued shouting, “10 million!”

The young man in the front row frowned slightly, as if he was a little displeased with Qin Yu’s behavior.

He thought about it for a moment, then raised his number plate again and said, “20 million!”

As soon as he said this, everyone at the venue couldn’t help but gasp!

Although this piece of ice jade could be considered top-grade, it was definitely not worth this price!

Using 20 million to buy a huge rock was simply crazy!

“30 million!” While Qin Yu was hesitating, Yan Ruoxue suddenly raised the number plate.

“Miss Yan, you...” Just as Qin Yu was about to say something, Yan Ruoxue reached out and covered Qin Yu’s mouth.

“It’s okay. It doesn’t matter who is spending the money. You have to return the money. Use it wisely.” Yan Ruoxue blinked and said.

At this point, Yan Ruoxue paused for a moment. She leaned towards Qin Yu’s ear and whispered, “I secretly saved a lot of money in allowance. There’s 500 million!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned. Then, he couldn’t help but laugh.

To be able to save up to 500 million in allowance, just how rich was the Yan family...

In front, the young man’s expression was extremely displeased. It was obvious that he was also very interested in this piece of jade.

Just as the young man was about to raise the number plate, the old man beside him suddenly shook his head and said, “Young Master Liu, our target isn’t this piece of jade. We need to preserve our strength now.”

The young man called Young Master Liu took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed his anger as he nodded.

“Congratulations to Mr. Qin for successfully bidding for the ice jade pendant at the price of 30 million!” The host shouted.

After he successfully bidded for the Jade pendant, Qin Yu kept looking at Young Master Liu who wasn’t far away.

He felt that this young man wasn’t ordinary, especially the old man beside him, who was even more mysterious.

“Miss Yan, do you know that young man?” Qin Yu pointed at Young Master Liu, who wasn’t far away, and asked.

Yan Ruoxue looked ahead and shook her head. “No, why?”

“I have a feeling that he’s not ordinary,” Qin Yu muttered.

“Maybe I’m overthinking it.” Then, Qin Yu waved his hand again.

The auction continued.

The next few items were mostly antiques, so Qin Yu wasn’t interested in them at all.

Finally, when the sixteenth item was auctioned, the host brought a glass cabinet.

Inside the cabinet was a ginseng. The ginseng looked glossy and smooth, and its quality was quite good.

“The next item to be auctioned is a hundred-year ginseng king. The starting price is 30 million, and each increment must not be less than a million!” The host shouted.

Once this item was out, the excitement at the scene immediately reached its climax.

“31 million!”

“36 million!”

“40 million!”

” ...”

These rich people all seemed to want a ginseng. To them, health was the most important thing, and a hundred-year-old ginseng could very likely save their lives at a critical moment.

“Isn’t this what you want? Why didn’t you bid?” Yan Ruoxue said with some surprise.

Qin Yu shook his head and said in a sullen voice, “Although this ginseng is a hundred-year-old herb king, in fact, the herbal effect has long dried up. As for spiritual energy... it’s even more pitifully scarce. It’s even worse than an ordinary herb.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s eyes were fixed on Young Master Liu, who was in the front row.

Other than when bidding for that piece of Jade, Young Master Liu didn’t say a word. His motive was very obvious. It was very likely that he had come for the herbs.

What made Qin Yu even more worried was that Young Master Liu hadn’t made a bid for this hundred-year-old ginseng.

“Looks like this guy is also very knowledgeable,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

This gave Qin Yu a headache. Once he had an opponent, it meant that he would have to spend a lot more money.

“Congratulations, Mr. Wang, for bidding for the hundred-year-old ginseng king at a price of 180 million!” At this moment, the host on the stage suddenly shouted.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

A ginseng whose herbal effects had already dried up was bid for nearly 200 million. How exaggerated would the price of a real medicine king be?

“Cultivation is indeed a very expensive thing.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

“Next is our final item,” the host said calmly on the stage.

He waved his hand, and the two of them carefully walked up with a hibiscus box.

Then, the host said with a nonchalant smile, “This was picked up by a fellow auctioneer from the mountain. It’s allegedly a wild Chinese knotweed. The starting price is 100 million, and each increment must be no less than 10 million!”

Then, the host slowly opened the box.

In the box laid a Chinese knotweed that was almost withered.

This Chinese knotweed looked very unattractive, like the wild grass on the roadside.

“D*mn, is he that poor? Shabby grass is being sold for 200 million?”

“Only a fool would buy it. Even the radishes I plucked from my backyard are better than this grass!”

“Hehe, not to mention 20 million, but I wouldn’t want it even for 20,000!”

Everyone present ridiculed it one after another, and they were clearly displeased.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu was staring fixedly at this Chinese knotweed! His eyeballs almost popped out!

Other than Qin Yu, Young Master Liu, who was sitting in the front row, also looked extremely excited!

“Young Master Liu, this Chinese knotweed is at least 200 years old,” the old man beside him reminded him.

Young Master Liu narrowed his eyes and said, “I must get this Chinese knotweed!”
