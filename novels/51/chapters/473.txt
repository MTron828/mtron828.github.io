Chapter 474: Ancient Tree In Hand! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As he looked at the collapsed Water Rhyme Tower, Elder Qu immediately became anxious!

“Qin Yu, f * ck you!” Elder Qu’s eyes constricted as he cursed!

An intense light burst out from his palm as he charged towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu immediately clenched his fist and charged forward.

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, Qin Yu immediately retreated a few steps. He let out a muffled groan as fresh blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth.

Elder Qu was, after all, a half-step Martial Marquis. Furthermore, Qin Yu’s current condition wasn’t good. Naturally, he would be at a disadvantage.

“I’m going to kill you!” Elder Qu roared crazily.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any time. He hurriedly stepped on the ground and rushed into the ruins, then arrived below the first level of the Water Rhyme Tower.

At this moment, the environment here had changed drastically!

The landscape-like scene from before had disappeared. What replaced it was a muddy scene.

The Guardian had also disappeared without a trace.

“As expected.” Qin Yu was overjoyed!

He had made the right bet!

The Water Rhyme Tower was the core of the array!

Qin Yu hurriedly walked up to the Three Pure Ancient Tree and reached out to pluck it before stuffing it into his spatial artifact.

“Don’t even think about running! I’m going to kill you!” Elder Qu’s voice came from outside.

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn, and he said in a low voice, “I have to think of a way to escape first.”

Qin Yu once again used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique to run away!

“You want to run? In your dreams!” As he looked at Qin Yu, who was running away, Elder Qu’s expression was extremely cold.

Then, he took a step forward and quickly chased after him.

However, Qin Yu’s Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique was a godly skill. How could Elder Qu compare to him?

The distance between the two of them grew further and further. In less than five minutes, Qin Yu had completely disappeared from Elder Qu’s sight.

Elder Qu, his expression extremely cold, panted heavily.

The people beside him also quickly caught up.

“Elder Qu, what should we do?” Someone asked.

A trace of ruthlessness flashed across Elder Qu’s face.

He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “I will definitely kill him! Go to the airport! I don’t believe that he can escape to the ends of the Earth!”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu only dared to stop after escaping for dozens of miles.

At this time, the spiritual energy in his body had completely depleted, and he fell to the ground without any strength to speak of.

The consumption of Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique was simply too great, and he could not hold on for too long.

“I’ll think of a way to leave Dongchuan first.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He hurriedly hailed a car and rushed towards the airport.

On the way, Qin Yu tried to send a message to the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“Pavilion Master, I’m in trouble now. I’ve provoked the Saint Confucian Sect and the Hong Yi Sect. Can I go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to hide?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

After all, the Saint Confucian Sect was the number one sect in the north. The Hong Yi Sect had ten half-step Martial Marquises. Qin Yu didn’t know if the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would be able to handle it.

After a short while, the Pavilion Master replied, “Okay.”

It was still a short word, but it made Qin Yu sigh in relief.

“I’ll have to trouble the Divine Alchemist Pavilion again.” Qin Yu smiled bitterly to himself.

Qin Yu didn’t know much about the strength of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. He only knew that their connections were extremely powerful.

But it was hard to say whether it was enough.

Qin Yu arrived at the airport. Qin Yu bought the earliest flight ticket and rushed towards Qinghe town. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Less than five minutes after Qin Yu boarded the plane, Elder Qu and the others also arrived at the airport.

With the connections of the Saint Confucian Sect, it wasn’t difficult to find a person. Therefore, Elder Qu quickly found out Qin Yu’s destination.

“Qinghe town?” Elder Qu narrowed his eyes.

“He’s going to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” the person beside him said in a deep voice.

Elder Qu snorted and said, “So what if he is going to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? If he goes against the Saint Confucian Sect, he has to die!”

Then, Elder Qu bought a plane ticket and headed straight for Qinghe town!

...

On the plane, Qin Yu finally got some rest.

“That was close,” Qin Yu sighed.

Fortunately, he had obtained the Three Pure Ancient Tree, so everything wasn’t in vain.

“As long as I have the Three Pure Ancient Tree and the herbs from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, it shouldn’t be difficult to step into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile.

With this blissful smile, Qin Yu quickly fell asleep.

When Qin Yu woke up again, he had already arrived.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. He hailed a cab and headed straight for the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Elder Qu was hot on Qin Yu’s trail. The time difference was less than half an hour.

“Elder Qu, going to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is of great significance. Why don’t... we first tell the sect master?” The person beside said.

Elder Qu snorted coldly and said, “There’s no need. If she doesn’t give in, it’s not too late to look for the sect master.”

...

He returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion once again.

Qin Yu stood at the entrance of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. The herbal aroma that assaulted Qin Yu’s face made him take a deep breath.

“Elder Qin!”

After seeing Qin Yu, countless pharmacists came forward to greet him.

“Elder Qin, you’re back!”

“Elder Qin, ever since you left, there have been endless legends about you! You’re too amazing!”

“Elder Qin...”

Everyone surrounded Qin Yu, their idol and role model.

Qin Yu responded politely one by one. After a long time, the crowd dispersed.

He arrived at the Pavilion Master’s building.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to shout when the Medicine Boy’s voice came from above, “Elder Qin, come up. The Pavilion Master has been waiting for you for a long time.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu scratched his head in embarrassment.

He jumped onto the building.

He saw the Pavilion Master sitting there with a cup of black tea in her hand.

“Lord Pavilion Master.” Qin Yu walked forward and bowed slightly.

The Pavilion Master pointed at the chair with her chin and said, “Sit.”

Qin Yu hurriedly sat opposite the Pavilion Master.

Neither party said anything, and the atmosphere was a little awkward.

A moment later, Qin Yu broke the silence and said, “Lord Pavilion Master, I. . . I want to borrow the herbs of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion... Don’t worry, I will return them to you as soon as possible!”

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Ordinary herbs are no longer effective on you now.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Yes, I don’t know why, but my dantian needs a lot of spiritual energy.”

The Pavilion Master slowly stood up and said indifferently, “If you want to improve your cultivation in a short period of time, there is only one way.”

Qin Yu, his eyes filled with admiration, hurriedly looked at the Pavilion Master.

The Pavilion Master extended her smooth finger and pointed at the distant warehouse.

“That place might be useful to you,” the Pavilion Master said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s eyes immediately widened!

Warehouse?

One had to know that all the herbs in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion were in that warehouse. The density of the spiritual energy inside was beyond imagination!
