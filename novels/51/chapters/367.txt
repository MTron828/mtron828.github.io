Chapter 368: The Angry Qin Yu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the body that didn’t belong to Old Mister Yan, Qin Yu had an indescribable feeling in his heart.

This body slowly opened its eyes, and there was a bit of confusion in its eyes.

“Old Mister Yan?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Old Mister Yan’s pupils suddenly dilated.

He reached out and grabbed Qin Yu’s arm while saying, “Qin Yu? where... where is this? Aren’t I already dead?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. Old Mister Yan’s memory was really good.

“You are now resurrected,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

He raised his head to look at Old Mister Yan’s glabella and discovered that the aura of death between Old Mister Yan’s glabella had disappeared.

This was enough to prove that Old Mister Yan’s death previously wasn’t a normal death.

As for the exact reason, Qin Yu didn’t know.

Then, Qin Yu helped Old Mister Yan up.

Old Mister Yan put his hands behind his back and couldn’t help but sigh.

He didn’t expect that Qin Yu would forcefully prolong his life.

“Qin Yu, you...” Old Mister Yan opened his mouth and waved his hand.

“Old Mister Yan, you should get used to this body first. If there is a chance in the future, I will give you a better body,” said Qin Yu.

Old Mister Yan nodded and said with a hint of sadness, “Qin Yu, I owe you.”

“Don’t talk about this.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the crowd and cupped his hands. “I, Qin Yu, will never forget your kindness.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took out a piece of paper and wrote down his contact details. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“If there is anything I can help you with, just let me know. I won’t decline,” Qin Yu said.

With Qin Yu’s words of assurance, everyone couldn’t help but smile.

“Mr. Qin, you are too polite.” Although they said this, they were extremely excited inside.

He was an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion! It was said that even the important figures in Jingdu were taken care of by the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, let alone them!

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly frowned slightly.

He felt an internal qi rushing towards him from not far away.

One, two, three!

“Three peak Inner Strength Grandmasters!” Qin Yu’s expression was unsightly.

He wasn’t afraid, but worried. He was worried that it was Cao Shan who was coming.

Qin Yu wasn’t the only one who felt this internal qi. Everyone else also looked in that direction.

Very quickly, three figures sped over!

The one leading them was Cao Shan!

Qin Yu’s heart thumped!

Cao Shan... found them?

Didn’t that mean that... something bad happened to Yan Jiang?

In the blink of an eye, Cao Shan had arrived in front of everyone.

There were a few bloody wounds on his body. The wounds looked as if they had been sliced by someone and looked extremely horrifying.

The internal qi of Cao Shan and the others were also somewhat chaotic. It was obvious that they had gone through a great battle.

Qin Yu’s expression became increasingly unsightly. He clenched his fists tightly.

“Qin Yu!”

Cao Shan roared angrily!

His internal qi was soaring as he strode towards Qin Yu!

“Your people killed two of my companions! I will make you pay for this!” Cao Shan’s eyes were burning with rage! It was enough to show his anger at this moment!

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “What did you do to Yan Jiang?”

Cao Shan narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Of course we killed him. If we didn’t kill him, how could we have the chance to chase after him!”

“You killed him?!” Qin Yu’s face instantly turned extremely ugly!

Anger almost swallowed Qin Yu at this moment!

“Or else?” Cao Shan said coldly.

“Don’t worry, I’ll send you to see him later!” Cao Shan’s aura slowly spread out.

“What, do you think we don’t exist?” At this moment, the people beside him suddenly stood up.

One, two, three...

More than twenty martial artists stood behind Qin Yu!

Among them, there were a total of eight peak Inner Strength Past Masters! There were countless ordinary Inner Strength Past Masters!

“Mr. Qin, do you need our help?” Someone asked.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Kill them. I want to tear them into pieces!”

“Alright, leave them to us!” One of the Inner Strength Grandmasters took the lead and stepped forward, then his internal qi burst out instantly!

The rest of the people followed closely behind. They all had the intention to make a move!

Cao Shan’s expression changed. He coldly said, “Who are you people? Do you not want to live anymore?!”

The underling beside Cao Shan even roared loudly, “This is the Cao family’s clan head, Cao Shan!”

“Cao Shan? We don’t know him!”

“That’s right. Even if you are the king, we will easily crush you to death today!”

Cao Shan thought to himself that things weren’t looking good.

He didn’t expect that Qin Yu had such charisma!

“Everyone, don’t be agitated. I work for the Yan family. If you go against us, you are going against the Yan family.” At the crucial moment, Cao Shan mentioned the Yan family.

When they heard this, everyone’s expression changed slightly. Some of them even took a step back.

“Working for the Yan Family? How do you know the people of the Yan Family?” At this moment, Old Mister Yan frowned and asked in shock.

Cao Shan put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I’m working for the Yan family’s Yan Sihai. It’s Mr. Yan who wants to kill him.”

“Yan Sihai?!” Old Mister Yan’s face suddenly turned a little pale.

He knew that Yan Sihai would definitely stir up trouble, but he didn’t think that he would chase them all the way here!

“Do you guys still intend to stop me now?” Cao Shan said with a nonchalant smile.

Everyone said somewhat awkwardly, “Mr. Qin, I’m really sorry. We can’t afford to offend the Yan family.”

“That’s right, Mr. Qin. Please forgive us for not being able to do anything.”

“I’m sorry.”

Everyone cupped their hands and took a step back.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu had already been overwhelmed by anger. He stared at Cao Shan and roared angrily, “Whoever kills Cao Shan, I’ll give him an Earth Rank pill.”

Everyone looked at each other, but didn’t make any movements for a long time.

“Ten pills!” Qin Yu roared angrily.

The crowd immediately gasped! Ten Earth Rank pills was indeed too tempting!

“Whoever kills Cao Shan, I’ll give him a Divine Rank pill!” Qin Yu raised the stakes once again!

With bountiful rewards, there would definitely be people willing to take a risk.

Upon hearing this, these Inner Strength Grandmasters couldn’t care less about the Yan family.

They stepped forward one after another and looked at Cao Shan.

“Who cares who you work for? Even if you work for the Yan family, so what? You’re just a lapdog of the Yan family!”

“That’s right. I don’t believe that the Yan family will make a big fuss after a lapdog is killed!”

“Everyone, let’s kill Cao Shan together!”
