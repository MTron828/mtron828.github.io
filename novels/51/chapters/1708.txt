Chapter 1709: He Teng, Who Blocked the Way! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The people from both sides quickly gathered at the border. Yong Ji also brought people and rushed to the scene.

Yong Ji coldly swept his gaze over everyone and shouted, “Didn’t you all want to take revenge for Xiao Hai? Come over!”

After saying this, Yong Ji took the lead to attack! He extended his palm and a huge hand covered all over the place and pressed down!

That terrifying internal qi instantly made people suffocate!

All the Mighty Realm experts were like ants in front of Yong Ji. With a single palm strike, countless people died in his hands!

Seeing the scene, everyone’s expressions couldn’t help but change drastically!

“Is this the strength of the Reversion Void Stage…”

“It’s too… too terrifying…”

Qin Yu’s expression was also somewhat ugly.

Just as Xiao Sheng had said, in this cultivation realm, the key factor that determined the outcome of a great battle was the highest combat strength.

In front of the Reversion Void Stage, mighty realm cultivators were like ants that were not worth mentioning. They could not resist at all!

Yong Ji seemed to have been killing that he had lost his rationality. Countless lives had died in his hands.

“Hahaha! This is my strength, who can stop me!” Yong Ji laughed crazily as if he was venting the anger that had been suppressed at the bottom of his heart during this time!

He just raised his palm, and a large number of people fell. This kind of strength could destroy things with incredible ease.

Qin Yu’s expression was ugly. If Nanzhou did not have a person at the Reversion Void Stage stepping out, then the outcome of this battle would be without the slightest suspense.

“Yong Ji…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He wished he could tear him apart immediately!

At this moment, Yong Ji was still madly killing people. With his existence, there was practically no need for the other cultivators of North Plain to participate in the battle.

As such, Qin Yu didn’t even have the chance to enter North Plain.

“All of you die!”

Yong Ji seemed to have killed until he lost his rationality. Countless lives had died in his hands.

Everyone’s state of mind also began to change. From the initial anger and agitation to the current fear and helplessness.

They even had nowhere to run. They could only passively wait for the arrival of death.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. His anger was almost unstoppable.

Right at this moment, someone finally made a move.

The palm of the Reversion Void Stage cultivator hidden in the dark reached out to receive Yong Ji’s palm!

At the moment of the collision, countless people were pushed back. A terrifying internal qi instantly spread out in all directions, shattering the void patch by patch!

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and looked coldly at a particular corner.

An old man slowly walked out.

He looked at Yong Ji and said indifferently, “Yong Ji, long time no see.”

Seeing this old man, Yong Ji was startled. He then laughed out loud. “Li Cheng? It’s you? I didn’t expect you, an old fart, to also step into the Reversion Void Stage. Ridiculous, it’s too ridiculous! Hahaha!”

The old man called Li Cheng was not angry. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Back then, I was unfortunately defeated by you. I thought that my dao technique had been broken. I didn’t expect to have been able to step into the Reversion Void Stage today.”

Yong Ji sneered, “Back then, you were not my match, and today you are not either. However, it takes a lot of courage for you to dare to attack me.

“After all, in your heart… I am a mountain that you will never be able to cross.”

Li Cheng said calmly, “In everyone’s heart, there is a mountain that can never be crossed. I think it’s the same for you.

“But you and I are different. I dare to attack you, but you will never be able to do so.”

Yong Ji’s expression became increasingly unsightly. Li Cheng’s every word pierced his heart.

He took a deep breath and said coldly, “Alright, I’ll let you know the consequences of attacking me now!”

After saying that, Yong Ji let out an explosive shout as if a clap of thunder had sounded in the sky!

Following that, his internal qi increased rapidly, and a huge hand stretched out. It could destroy both the heavens and earth!

Li Cheng did not lose out in the slightest. He raised both his hands, and the mark instantly burst out one after another. It actually shattered Yong Ji’s palm!

“Bravo!”

The cultivators of Nanzhou instantly shouted out in excitement!

With Li Cheng’s attack, the situation immediately changed drastically. Everyone regained their confidence, and a great battle was about to break out!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief in his heart.

He coldly looked at the cultivators of North Plain and then with a flash, he charged into the crowd.

Qin Yu’s strength naturally didn’t need to be elaborated. In his eyes, the cultivators of North Plain couldn’t withstand a single blow.

However, Qin Yu didn’t dare to overdo it for fear of being noticed by the people of North Plain.

This was a great battle that concerned both sides. A battle of such a scale hadn’t appeared for many years.

Qin Yu hid in the dark. He found an opportunity and tore off the clothes of a North Plain cultivator. He then quickly put them on.

After doing all this, Qin Yu planned to go to North Plain and find a place to hide.

However, just as Qin Yu put on the black robe of North Plain, a cultivator from Nanzhou rushed over!

“I’ll kill you!” The other party roared with extreme hatred.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He had no other choice but to stretch out his palm and slap on his chest.

After forcing the cultivator back, without further delay, Qin Yu quickly rushed toward the northern lands.

Everyone was in a state of battle, so no one noticed Qin Yu’s whereabouts.

He hurriedly rushed toward the depths of North Plain. Everything seemed to be going smoothly.

However, at this moment, a figure blocked Qin Yu’s way. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

This person was none other than He Teng!

He Teng looked at Qin Yu with a sinister expression and said with a grin, “Where are you going?”

Qin Yu’s expression, which was hidden under the black robe, changed drastically! His body trembled slightly as he tried his best to restrain his internal qi. He was afraid that He Teng would sense something!

“I… I have stomach upset,” Qin Yu tried his best to keep his voice low as if he was whispering.

“Oh? Is that so?” He Teng walked up to Qin Yu and looked down at him.

He raised his hand and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder, saying, “Is your stomach upset, or are you scared?”

“I… I’m scared.” Qin Yu could only bite the bullet and lie.

“I don’t want to die, I want to cultivate…”

Hearing this, He Teng instantly laughed out loud, “So you’re a coward. What’s the use of keeping a person like you in North Plain?”

Qin Yu sensed that thing was not right. He Teng had always not valued life, and could attack him at any time!

Qin Yu did not dare to say a word. He quietly adjusted his internal qi, preparing himself to attack at any time.

However, He Teng didn’t have the intention to attack. He said indifferently, “People should care for themselves. Cowardice is a good thing.”

After saying this, He Teng turned around and left.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He didn’t dare to think too much and immediately prepared to rush into the depths of North Plain.

“Stop.” At this time, He Teng called out to Qin Yu again.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Why do I feel smell something very familiar on your body?”
