2453 Persuade to Leave

“The Judge’s Brush!”

Qin Yu was tremendously shocked. He certainly knew what this thing meant.

This brush was probably the most formidable treasure in the ghost realm. The key was that it was almost unbeatable when combined with the Book of Life and Death.

Either of these two items was a much more powerful magical artifact than the celestial artifact of the nine great aristocratic families.

Moreover, Qin Yu had seen for himself the power of their combination just now.

That strange method of severing the fate line almost killed him among the human race. The key was that he still could not protect himself.

However, he did not know what had happened. The Judge’s Brush even penetrated the ghost realm and came to his body.

“Did Brother Xiao Hai save me again? Or Jun Yixian?”

Qin Yu’s expression was grave, although he did not know if it was due to Brother Xiao Hai or Jun Yixian.

However, he knew that someone in the ghost realm must have paid a tremendous price for the Judge’s Brush to fall into his hands.

He only felt a heavy weight on his chest. Xiao Hai’s attack was more like a final instruction.

The trip to the ghost realm was like a dream.

Moreover, the strength of the ghost realm Qin Yu had seen for himself made him understand how dangerous the situation in the human world was.

He had not seen for himself the human race’s foundation yet, but so many terrifying forces had appeared in a mere ghost realm.

What if the other two races joined forces to attack? What would the human race do then?

While deep in contemplation, Immortal Emperor Yao’s divine sense came out from an acupoint.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, I’m unable to fulfill our agreement.”

Sensing the fluctuations of the divine sense, Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

After a long time, a tremendously weak consciousness slowly spoke.

“A wisp of the soul’s consciousness has indeed left the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth long ago. I don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. The power of this ghost realm is no longer the same as when the human race was at its peak. If I didn’t hide in my soul and dare not show myself, I’m afraid even this soul wouldn’t be able to come back.”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s hoary voice slowly sounded.

There was an indescribable loneliness in his voice. Back then, the might of an immortal emperor was so heroic that he could fight against the heavens. He did not expect to dare not show his face like a stray dog today.

Qin Yu sighed, but he did not know how to comfort him.

His soul had turned into a stream of light and was flying to his body at a terrifying speed.

Soon, his enormous soul appeared in the Sumeru ring and entered his body.

Qin Yu, in the Sumeru ring, suddenly opened his eyes.

“F*ck, Qin Yun, you’re finally back.”

Chang Mang shouted when he saw Qin Yu open his eyes.

Although he knew Qin Yu was heading to the ghost realm, this was the first time Chang Mang had seen his soul travel so far. Therefore, he had been worried, afraid that something would happen to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu smiled and shook his head. He then punched Chang Mang in the chest.

He came to Yan Ruoxue’s side and took the Smeru ring from her.

Lei Qingye must have been pursuing him closely during this period. Yan Ruoxue and Elder Guai’s faces were extremely pale as if they had overused their soul power.

“I appreciate your efforts!”

Qin Yu smiled and rubbed Yan Ruoxue’s head.

“Are you alright? Qin Yu.” Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu worriedly, even though he had only been away for three days.

However, she could see some changes in Qin Yu’s eyes. If she had not experienced many things herself, she would not have seen such a change in his eyes.

“I’m fine. I’m just missing Wen Er and Master a little.”

Qin Yu looked in the direction of Nanzhou.

The Sumeru qi in his hand entered the ring, and then the entire ring stopped.

In an instant, Qin Yu seemed to have felt a wisp of consciousness spying on the Sumeru ring and locking on it almost instantly.

Layers of dark clouds arrived in an instant, lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled in the sky.

The thunders and bolts of lightning that filled the sky sealed the entire space and descended.

Lei Qingye managed to deduce their location the moment they stopped. His speed had not been this fast before Qin Yu left.

In a short period, his realm seemed to have improved again.

There was only one explanation for this. Lei Qingye must have gained something from his battle with Immortal Emperor Yao.

“Boom!”

Lei Qingye, who was like a Thunder God, had torn through space and appeared in front of Qin Yu and the others.

The moment he appeared, he frowned slightly and his gaze landed on Qin Yu.

At his cultivation realm, he could instantly sense the slightest change in his heart.

At this moment, facing Qin Yu, he felt like he could not see through Qin Yu at all.

This was completely different from the feeling Qin Yu gave him when he escaped.

“Go away. I don’t want to fight anymore…”

Qin Yu was a little tired. The battle in the ghost realm had exhausted him.

At this moment, he no longer wanted to fight Lei Qingye again. The Judge’s Brush suddenly appeared in his hand.

The tip of the brush emitted a crisp sound of the soul.

Lei Qingye felt a mysterious connection between his body and the brush.

The two seemed to have a connection between them.

He felt a terrifying threat from the tip of the brush.

This brush seemed to be able to decide his life and death.

“Go!”

Lei Qingye’s expression changed drastically, and he dared not hesitate in the slightest.

“Boom!”

He erupted with an even faster speed and fled with lightning speed.

Qin Yu looked at him indifferently and did not pursue him.

If he were to attack Lei Qingye forcefully, with the help of the Judge’s Brush, he might be able to kill Lei Qingye. However, he did not want to do so.

For the time being, he could not sense what this supreme treasure was, but since it could make him feel threatened, he dared not rashly try it.

“The Judge’s Brush? That seemed to be one of the two divine artifacts of the ghost realm. How did this thing appear on him? Did Qin Yu cause the vibration of the Path of Heaven that appeared earlier?”

At this moment, Lei Qingye’s hair was disheveled. The originally neatly arranged hairpin had come loose at some point, making him look quite unkempt.

He landed in Thunderous Courtyard, his thoughts in a mess.

Not seeing him for three days, what had happened exactly?

Even Immortal Emperor Lei would not have such a tremendous improvement.

Was it due to the support of that magical artifact that Qin Yu’s soul power was so powerful? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

…

At Huaning Mountain in Nanzhou…

After flying for half a day, Qin Yu and the others finally appeared in the areas of Nanzhou. This was the place where Jue Wu used to cultivate.

After arriving, Jue Wu’s eyes almost emitted light.

“Oh my god, I haven’t been home for so long. I wonder what that old brat Wen Wanchong has done to this place. Wen Er, Wen Wanchong! Get the hell out here!”

After Jue Wu and Qin Yu went to Zhongzhou, Wen Wanchong and Wen Er had come to live and cultivate in Huaning Mountain.

At this moment, in the Huaning Mountain, the forest was quiet.

Even under the scorching sun, there was still a cool feeling.

Butterflies danced, and birds chirped in the valley.

Compared to previously, it was less lively, but it had a lot more natural energy.
