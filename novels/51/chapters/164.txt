Chapter 165: Second Level of the Foundation Establishment Stage Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A grave expression appeared on Wei Ming’s face.

However, Mr. Yang was completely unaware. He still said angrily, “When Mr. Qin wakes up, he will definitely seek justice!”

However, Wei Ming shook his head. He looked at Mr. Yang with a grave expression and said, “It’s best not to let him know about this matter.”

Mr. Yang was stunned and asked with a puzzled expression, “Why... Why?”

Wei Ming said in a sullen voice, “The Jiang family is the most powerful family in the entire Chuzhou. Their power completely surpasses all the other families in Chuzhou. They basically rule over the area.”

“If Mr. Qin were to know about it, do you think he would let it go just like that? If there is a conflict, he might end up dead!” Wei Ming looked at Mr. Yang and asked.

Mr. Yang’s expression instantly turned a little ugly.

He knew that the Jiang family wasn’t ordinary, but he didn’t expect that even Wei Ming was so afraid.

“Then... then what should we do? The Nine Dragon Pill has been taken away by them. I... I can’t explain it to him.” Mr. Yang seemed to be at a loss.

Wei Ming sighed. He reached out and patted Mr. Yang’s shoulder while saying, “Mr. Yang, if you don’t want anything to happen to Qin Yu, you can take the blame yourself.”

Although he didn’t say it clearly, his intention was very obvious.

Then, Wei Ming didn’t stay any longer and left quickly.

After he left, Mr. Yang sat there and fell into deep thought.

After a while, Mr. Yang let out a long sigh.

“I’ll listen to Young Master Wei,” Mr. Yang muttered in a low voice.

Time flew by, and Qin Yu still hadn’t woken up in the past few days.

There were still many people who came to ask for the pill every day, but they were all rejected by Mr. Yang.

Two days later, Qin Yu finally woke up from his sleep.

He stretched his body while feeling refreshed all over.

Then, Qin Yu clenched his fist tentatively. After feeling the abundant energy in his body, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

“My physical strength has finally completely recovered,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, he pushed open the door and walked out.

It was noon. When Mr. Yang saw Qin Yu, he quickly walked forward and greeted him, “Mr. Qin, you’re awake.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Yang, how many days have I slept?”

Mr. Yang counted with his fingers and said, “Exactly a week.”

“That long?” This surprised Qin Yu.

Mr. Yang made a cup of tea for Qin Yu and said, “Yeah, I didn’t expect you to sleep for so long.”

After not eating or drinking for several days, Qin Yu also felt hungry and thirsty. So, after Qin Yu washed up, he took Mr. Yang out to a restaurant.

Qin Yu devoured the meal ravenously.

The meal lasted at least three hours.

After eating to his heart’s content, Qin Yu asked casually, “Mr. Yang, there were probably quite a number of people who came to look for me recently.”

Mr. Yang’s expression changed slightly. After a moment of silence, he said, “That’s right. Almost every day, people come to visit. Some people want the pill, and some people want to invite you to a banquet.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “As I expected. Has the Nine Dragon Pill been sold?”

Mr. Yang looked a little embarrassed. He braced himself and said, “No... No.”

Qin Yu didn’t care. He smiled and said, “That’s normal. After all, hundred-year-old herbs aren’t that easy to find.”

“No... No.” Mr. Yang raised his head and looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was stunned and said in surprise, “No? What do you mean?”

Mr. Yang said with his face flushed, “I ate the Nine Dragon Pill. I. . . I have been feeling very uncomfortable recently, so I ate it myself...”

At this point, Mr. Yang quickly stood up, bowed, and said, “Mr. Qin, I’ll buy this pill. Deduct it from my salary in the future!”

Qin Yu stared at Mr. Yang and didn’t say anything for a while.

The more he acted like this, the more nervous Mr. Yang felt.

“Mr. Yang, you’re being too polite when you say this.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“Since you’re not feeling well, I’ll give you the Nine Dragon Pill.” Qin Yu wiped his mouth and said with a smile. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Mr. Yang was stunned. He raised his head and looked at Qin Yu. He couldn’t help but feel touched.

“Mr. Qin, is what you said true?” Mr. Yang found it hard to believe.

That was the Nine Dragon Pill. Who knew how many aristocratic families were willing to spend a lot of money to buy it?!

But Qin Yu was actually willing to give it to him?

“Of course. It’s just a Nine Dragon Pill.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Thank you, Mr. Qin!” Mr. Yang quickly bowed respectfully.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Well, it’s time to go back. After resting for so long, it’s time to get down to business.”

The two of them returned to the hotel, but Qin Yu felt that something wasn’t right.

Because when Mr. Yang spoke, his eyes looked shifty, as if he was hiding something.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. He thought that it was because Mr. Yang felt guilty about it.

After returning to the hotel, Qin Yu looked at Mr. Yang and said, “Mr. Yang, I’m afraid that I’ll be busy for a few days. No matter who comes to find me, I won’t see them.”

Mr. Yang bowed and said, “Yes, Mr. Qin.”

Then, Qin Yu turned around and returned to his room before locking the door.

He took out the two stalks of Ganoderma.

One was a hundred years old, and the other was two hundred years old.

“With these two stalks of Ganoderma, I should be able to refine at least three Foundation Establishment Pills,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

As for the exact number, it still depended on the method of refining the pill.

The more skillful the method, the more pills would be refined.

Qin Yu placed the two stalks of Ganoderma properly, then began to control the spiritual fire to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill.

After the last Chinese Medicine Conference, Qin Yu’s control over the spiritual fire had obviously improved a lot.

With the support of the spiritual fire, Qin Yu only used one night to successfully refine the Foundation Establishment Pill.

The Foundation Establishment Pill was a basic pill, so the spiritual power consumption wasn’t much.

In the early morning, a total of eight Foundation Establishment Pills appeared in front of Qin Yu.

“No wonder they are so shocked by the blue spiritual fire. Its effect is far beyond imagination.” Qin Yu looked at the eight Foundation Establishment Pills in front of him and couldn’t help but think to himself.

“Eight Foundation Establishment Pills can at least let me advance to the third level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.” Qin Yu touched his chin and guessed.

Without thinking much about it, Qin Yu quickly swallowed the few pills.

Not long after, Qin Yu felt that his Dantian was filled with a huge amount of spiritual energy!

This spiritual energy was like a small stream, with the Dantian as the center, as it rushed towards the various acupoints in his body.

Qin Yu, guiding the flow of spiritual energy in his body, closed his eyes.

For an entire day, Qin Yu didn’t leave the room.

These eight Foundation Establishment Pills were quickly digested in Qin Yu’s body, but what was surprising was that Qin Yu didn’t advance to the first level.

It wasn’t until the last Foundation Establishment Pill was digested that Qin Yu felt that he was on the verge of breaking through to the second level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

Waves of energy started to swirl around Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and began to advance to the second level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.

His body suddenly lit up with a faint golden light, and this light illuminated the entire room, as if it was daytime.
