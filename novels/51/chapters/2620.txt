Chapter 2621: Time Rubik’s Cube

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Therefore, he might be able to break through certain restrictions. We need to be cautious about this,” Qin Yu said with a serious expression.

Even if they exclude Seifer, the necromancer, there was another outsider who could instantly kill Ju Wuwei. This was also something they needed to face.

What was even more terrifying was that this person could directly shatter the arrows shot by my Sun Chasing Bow. The speed of those energy arrows was so fast that not even the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could lock onto them. It was unclear how they achieved such a formidable reaction.

“Yes, but fortunately, we have the Time Rubik’s Cube. We can accomplish a lot in this one year,” Ju Wuwei spoke with a deep voice.

However, the Time Rubik’s Cube can only accommodate a total of five people, and we currently have only four. Who should receive the remaining slot?

Qin Yu hesitated. Among them, including himself, Ju Wuwei, Shen Qian, and Li Yue, there were only four people.

“If there’s an additional slot, we could consider selling it. A year is an extremely precious commodity for any living being.” Qin Yu nodded.

There was still over a day before the battle commenced, and entering the Time Rubik’s Cube only took one day, leaving half a day remaining.

Soon, as the news spread, people started coming in to test the waters with their bids. However, most presented only basic Pills, which held little attraction for Qin Yu at this point.

“Many outsiders perished in the previous scouting operation. The remaining individuals likely have few merit points. Let’s give the slot to the one with the highest bid.” Li Yue expressed a hint of helplessness. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Three bottles of Spirit Recovery Pills and one bottle of Energy Recovery Pills.

This is currently the highest bid. I’ll take this slot. It’s unlikely anyone will offer a higher bid.”

A middle-aged man with a cold expression declared.

He was the first to start bidding and consistently lowered the prices after observing others.

“Too low, ” Qin Yu frowned. Exchanging a year for four bottles of Pills was not an appealing deal.

“I’ll take this slot. Two Explosive Blood Pills and one Body-Protecting Golden Bell Talisman.”

A person with fiery red hair suddenly appeared beside Qin Yu.

Qin Yu gasped. The Explosive Blood Pill was the most expensive in the storage room.

Using it would burn up all the blood and qi, elevating strength to the extreme but resulting in certain death.

The military merit of this Explosive Blood Pill was approximately equivalent to exchanging two bottles of Energy Recovery Pills.

The Body-Protecting Golden Bell Talisman should also be a mysterious Dharma Treasure. Qin Yu sent his divine sense into the talisman.

It was a protective rule order, but a one-time-use item.

“Alright, it’s yours.” Qin Yu didn’t hesitate and directly took the fifth grade from his hand.

“Wait, I can still raise the price,” the middle-aged man with a cold expression spoke again.

“I’m sorry, I’ve already taken his things,” Qin Yu said coldly.

This person had been lowering the price from the beginning, and he had been unhappy for a long time.

Now that someone had finally bid so readily, Qin Yu would not accept it even if he bid again.

“You are Xiao Yunfei? The person who went through the second passage destroyed a blood pool where a necromancer reproduced the black dragon.”

Lu Yue was startled as he recalled some information.

Xiao Yunfei nodded indifferently.

Qin Yu took a deep look at Xiao Yunfei. It turned out that the huge explosion in the depths of the camp of the necromancy was caused by him.

With his military merit of breaking one of the black dragon breeding pools, the reward should be much higher than killing a black dragon. No wonder he could be so rich and generous to give out these rewards.

Qin Yu took out the Time Rubik’s Cube and sent his divine sense into it.

Five marks shuttled out of the Time Rubik’s Cube under Qin Yu’s control. These five spatial marks entered the five of them respectively.

As the mark lit up, Qin Yu and the others suddenly felt a huge suction force from the void. Their bodies were instantly pulled into a distant space.

This was a space that was as smooth as water. He couldn’t find anything else, and he didn’t know what the ground was made of.

Ju Wuwei’s saber actually couldn’t even leave a single mark.

Moreover, it seemed to be an entirely sealed space. There was no spiritual energy in the air.

“It’s a pity. If there were other living beings here, they would have accumulated a terrifying amount of holy energy in one year and improved their souls to the extreme.” Li Yue shook his head.

“But it’s enough. I can become more familiar with the power of the chessboard in a year.” Qin Yu frowned.

There were no other creatures in this space, so he could only increase his skill proficiency.

Ju Wuwei had already started looking for a spot to test his saber techniques.

Qin Yu also found a space. Now, he needed to familiarize himself with his other rule order, Projection.

This was obtained from Yin Lin, and it was also the order of a powerful rule.

This Order of Reflection involved a large amount of irregular void refraction.

With a slash, any slight deviation in angle would cause a huge deviation. This required a lot of time to familiarize himself with.

The few of them cultivated in this space day after day.

“Qin Yu, how about sparring with me?” Ju Wuwei suddenly stood up. He had reached a bottleneck after half a year of comprehension.

Now, he could only see if there was a breakthrough through actual combat.

“Come on!” Qin Yu said with a smile. He was also very curious about Ju Wuwei’s saber path.

To be able to use the saber techniques of the lower realm here, this was indeed an extremely terrifying talent.

The surrounding people were also attracted by this trial.

Ju Wuwei pulled out his Tiger Wings and raised them slightly to face Qin Yu.

He slowly walked toward Qin Yu. When he was about twenty meters away from Qin Yu, his body suddenly moved.

His body, which was as fast as an afterimage, was suddenly unsheathed along with the saber light.

Ding!

Qin Yu’s Vajra long saber was suddenly placed horizontally in front of her chest, blocking this powerful and heavy saber.

“Hahaha, my saber is not that easy to block!” Ju Wuwei laughed loudly.

A terrifying brute force pressed down from the blade once again, completely shattering Qin Yu’s scabbard.

His Vajra Saber had also formed an arch bridge. Qin Yu kicked the saber’s body and used the rebound force to kick Ju Wuwei away.

Ju Wuwei landed on the ground, and with a leap of his legs, he once again slashed at Qin Yu at an even faster speed.

Almost at the same time, Qin Yu felt Ju Wuwei’s aura lock onto his body.

A powerful and heavy saber aura pressed down on him from all directions, forcing him to face this saber..
