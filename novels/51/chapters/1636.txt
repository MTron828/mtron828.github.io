Chapter 1637: Chapter 1,637, the most precious treasure of the Central Plains! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Under the burning flames, Qin Yu began to lose his mind.

In this dark room, something unknown seemed to be happening.

Qin Yu’s lips and Xiao Cao’s met. The two of them hugged each other, venting the flames.

Xiao Cao’s hand caressed Qin Yu’s chest, and Qin Yu also drifted away from Xiao Cao’s body.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly opened!

He pushed Xiao Cao to the side and breathed in the air.

“Absolutely not...”Qin Yu clenched his teeth. He circulated the meridian circulation technique to stabilize his mind.

Qin Yu endured the pain again and again, let alone the so-called bathing fire in his body!

He closed his eyes slightly and breathed in and out in a regular manner.

This was a tempering of his temperament, and it was extremely tiring.

Beside him, Xiao Cao was stimulating Qin Yu even more. However, it was under such circumstances that Qin Yu’s state of mind slowly stabilized, and even improved!

For more than half the night, that bathing fire was successfully suppressed by Qin Yu.

He suddenly opened his eyes, as if he had been reborn.

The medicinal properties were directly expelled at this moment, and his state of mind improved even further.

If he had sufficient conditions now, Qin Yu could even take the opportunity to step into the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm in one fell swoop!

Looking at Xiao Cao again, she couldn’t bear it anymore. Her mouth kept breathing out hot air, and the clothes on her body were torn to shreds by herself.

Qin Yu took out the medicinal cauldron and began to refine the pill for the second time. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This time, the spiritual fire in Qin Yu’s hand became more agile, as if it was Qin Yu’s right-hand man.

With the withdrawal of the herbs, the pill took shape bit by bit.

This wasn’t a high-level pill, so it wasn’t difficult for Qin Yu to refine it.

Just as the pill was about to take shape, the door was suddenly pushed open!

Then, he saw Master Zhengyang standing at the door with a tall divine general beside him.

“Kid, so you are hiding here.”Master Zheng Yang said with a sinister smile.

And when Xiao Cao saw him, she immediately pounced on him!

Under the effect of the medicine, Xiao Cao had completely lost her mind.

“Hahahaha!”

Seeing this, master Zheng Yang couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Kid, did you see that? This is Xiao Cao’s voluntary. You Can’t go against her will.”Master Zheng Yang said with a smile.

He put one hand on Xiaocao’s shoulder, and his greasy face moved closer to Xiaocao’s face.

Qin Yu took out the pill from the cauldron, then his body shook, and he instantly appeared in front of Master Zhengyang.

Master Zhengyang was stunned, and he hurriedly stepped back!

At the same time, the divine general also stood in front of Master Zhengyang.

“You... you are actually okay? !”Master Zhengyang widened his eyes, as if he couldn’t believe this scene.

Just now, Qin Yu was clearly about to fall, so how did he recover to his original state? How did he do it?

Qin Yu pulled Xiao Cao to his side and then stuffed the pill into Xiao Cao’s mouth.

Very soon, Xiao Cao’s condition slowly stabilized.

“Go and have a good sleep.”Qin Yu carried Xiao Cao and placed her on the grass.

Then, Qin Yu’s gaze fell on master Zheng Yang.

“You Old Dog, you really don’t want to give up.”Qin Yu said coldly.

Although master Zheng Yang had some doubts in his heart, he didn’t panic.

“Kid, you have already offended me, and you still want me to help you? Divine General, destroy him for me!”Master Zheng Yang shouted.

Under Master Zhengyang’s orders, the divine general immediately rushed towards Qin Yu!

This divine general was made from top-grade materials and was said to have a physical body that was not weaker than a cultivator at the reversion void stage!

Qin Yu wanted to see so for myself as well. Therefore, he shouted and golden light flourished as he punched forward.

“Clang!”

The collision of the two parties’pure physical bodies caused an extremely powerful shockwave!

The shockwave swept out in all directions and instantly shattered the house!

The divine general staggered back a few steps while Qin Yu felt waves of pain on his wrist.

“This divine general really lives up to his reputation,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

From the looks of it, there was indeed a gap between his physical body and the reversion void stage.

“Hahahahaha!”Not far away, master Zheng Yang could not help but burst into laughter when he saw this!

“My Divine General is here, what can you do to me!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Your divine general is indeed not bad, but it does not have divine sense after all. To put it bluntly, it is just a tool.”

“To deal with a tool, you do not have to rely on your physical body.”

After saying that, streams of light emitted from Qin Yu’s body.

He raised his palm, and the Great Dao was revealed in an instant!

Rays of golden threads lingered in front of Qin Yu, looking extremely mystical.

That was the Great Dao! That was the Law of Heaven and earth!

Following that, Qin Yu raised both his hands, and abruptly pinched in the direction of the Divine General.

“Boom!”

That space instantly collapsed! The terrifying power actually directly pressed down on this divine general!

This was the power that Qin Yu had comprehended through repeated exchanges! It was the power of laws, a power that transcended the physical body and spiritual power!

Of course, Qin Yu’s comprehension was extremely shallow, so there was no way to kill this divine general in one go.

But this divine general was not the mastermind, as long as he was controlled, it would be enough.

The Venerable Fifth Mountain came crashing out at that moment, ruthlessly pressing down on the Divine General’s body!

The divine general tried to struggle, but found that he could not break free at all.

As Qin Yu’s state of mind improved, the venerable fifth mountain also seemed to have improved.

Compared to last time, this time it seemed to be bigger and heavier.

“It seems that although this divine general is strong, his strength is not strong enough,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Not far away, master Zheng Yang felt that something was wrong and wanted to run away.

Qin Yu snorted and immediately stepped on the line word formula, instantly arriving in front of master Zheng Yang.

“Ah!”

Master Zheng Yang cried out in surprise. Before he could escape, Qin Yu grabbed master Zheng Yang’s neck.

As a master of refining, master Zheng Yang naturally had some ability.

Two black spears shot out from his sleeves and headed straight for Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and his body suddenly emitted a golden light.

“Clang!”

Under the obstruction of the golden light, the two spears were instantly jolted to the side.

Qin Yu glanced at Chang Mang and could not help but sigh, “Another good thing. It’s a pity that your strength is too weak.”

The material of this spear was also extremely sturdy. Otherwise, it would have been sufficient to shatter it.

It was a pity that master Zheng Yang’s strength was not sufficient. Such a treasure would be a waste in his hands.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me! I can help you refine your body. I can also give you a treasure. It’s a real treasure!”Master Zheng Yang shouted anxiously.

“Oh?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said with a faint smile, “Is it really a treasure?”

“It’s definitely a treasure! It’s a treasure from the Central Plains!”Master Zheng Yang shouted hurriedly.
