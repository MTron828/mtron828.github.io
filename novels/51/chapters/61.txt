Chapter 62: Who Are You Calling a B*stard? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu didn’t care about the banquet, he just wanted to see Yan Ruoxue.

At night.

A Bentley that was used to take pictures in Jingdu stopped at the door.

Yan Ruoxue rolled down the window and waved at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu quickly trotted to the front of the car.

“Get in the car.” Yan Ruoxue blinked.

Qin Yu got into the car and sat next to Yan Ruoxue.

It wasn’t known whether it was because of the hot weather, but Yan Ruoxue’s face was flushed, which made her look even more attractive under the moonlight.

Qin Yu kept staring at Yan Ruoxue and was so mesmerized that he was unable to look away.

“Have you seen enough?” Yan Ruoxue reached out and patted Qin Yu’s head.

Only then did Qin Yu come back to his senses. He rubbed his nose resentfully, looking a little embarrassed.

“Let me tell you a piece of good news,” Yan Ruoxue said.

“What good news?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “Recently, the market share of the Shen family’s products in Chuzhou has been dropping non-stop. In just a few days, it has dropped by nearly 10% .”

“I think it won’t be long before Shen Tian comes to find you,” Yan Ruoxue snickered.

This gave Qin Yu a pleasant surprise. He had thought that it would take at least a month for it to take effect, but it had far exceeded his expectations.

“Qin Yu, let me ask you a question.” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly said with a serious expression.

“What question?” Qin Yu asked.

Yan Ruoxue tousled her hair and said with a smile, “If Shen Yun came to beg you, would you let him off the hook?”

Hearing this question, Qin Yu fell into a short silence.

Ever since he was a child, Qin Yu had always been merciful. Even if someone had hurt him, Qin Yu would forgive them.

But as he grew older, Qin Yu slowly realized that his benevolence not only wouldn’t help him gain the respect of other people, but he would even be looked down upon by other people.

After thinking for a long time, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I won’t be merciful to him, and I won’t let him off.”

Yan Ruoxue nodded slightly and smiled.

Although she didn’t say anything, it could be seen that Yan Ruoxue was very satisfied with this answer.

The secretary sitting in the front row said offhandedly, “The Shen family has been prominent for many years, so even if it declines, it won’t be so easy to deal with.”

Qin Yu knew that this secretary looked down on him, so.., he replied in a neither servile nor overbearing manner, “Maybe you think too highly of the Shen family, or maybe you look down on me too much, but the trifling Shen family can’t stop me, and he isn’t my target.”

Hearing this, the secretary turned his head.

He looked at Qin Yu with some surprise, and then secretly glanced at Yan Ruoxue, as if he was very surprised by Qin Yu’s words.

It wasn’t for other reasons, but because Yan Ruoxue had also said these words.

“If you can really eliminate the Shen family, I might look at you in a new light,” the secretary said indifferently.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t need you to look at me in a new light, because I don’t care about your opinion at all.”

“You!” The secretary was instantly rendered speechless by the snub.

Yan Ruoxue, who was at the side, secretly laughed.

...

The car arrived at a hotel, and the party was set up on the rooftop of the hotel.

“Wait for me here,” Yan Ruoxue said to the secretary.

“Yes, Miss,” the secretary nodded.

Then, Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu walked into the hotel together.

When they came to the rooftop, Yan Ruoxue stretched out her arm and rolled her eyes. “Do you still need me to teach you what to do?”

Qin Yu froze, then quickly reached out and held Yan Ruoxue’s arm.

“I’ve never attended such an occasion before...” Qin Yu said with some embarrassment.

“It’s okay. There will be more opportunities in the future,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this moment, two other people also came to the banquet.

“Mr. Lin is still lying in the hospital. I’m not feeling too well. Why must I attend this banquet?” Qi Yang said with some helplessness.

His ribs were in pain, but he had to endure it. This was simply torture.

“Ugh, even if I stay in the hospital, I can’t help much. Besides, I’ve never attended this kind of cocktail party before!” Lin Wan said in a petulant voice.

Qi Yang frowned. He was getting increasingly annoyed with Lin Wan.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the rooftop.

After showing the invitation, the two of them walked straight into the cocktail party’s venue.

“Wow! This place is so lavish!” As soon as they entered the cocktail party, Lin Wan shouted excitedly!

Qi Yang also said with some pride, “Although I’m not from Jiangcheng, I have a lot of friends in Jiangcheng.”

“This hotel is the tallest building in Jiangcheng. Standing here, you can overlook more than half of Jiangcheng!” Qi Yang said proudly.

Lin Wan quickly nodded and said, “Standing here gives me a lofty feeling!”

Qi Yang laughed and said, “I’ll bring you to meet my friend later. He is a big shot in Jiangcheng!”

As soon as he said that, Qi Yang suddenly frowned and saw Qin Yu a short distance away.

“Why is he here?” Qi Yang frowned and asked.

Ever since he witnessed Qin Yu’s strength, Qi Yang became terrified of Qin Yu.

It was definitely not a good thing to meet him at this cocktail party.

“I hope Lin Wan won’t see him,” Qi Yang thought to himself.

He knew very well that if Lin Wan saw him, she would definitely go over and provoke him.

Moreover, Qi Yang could also tell that Qin Yu didn’t hit women. When the time came, he might vent his anger on himself.

“Huh? That b*stard is actually here!” At this moment, Lin Wan suddenly shouted.

Qi Yang’s expression instantly darkened.

What he was afraid of came true.

“Qi Yang, look, it’s that B * Stard. Let’s go. I’m going to scold him to vent my anger!” Lin Wan said angrily.

Qi Yang coughed and said, “Forget it? It’s not good to cause trouble at this cocktail party...”

“It’s fine. If Qin Yu dares to get violent here, the owner of the hotel definitely won’t forgive him!” Lin Wan said smugly.

Even though that was the case, Qi Yang was still a little afraid.

The experience from the last time they fought still frightened him completely.

“Qi Yang, are you afraid?” Lin Wan rolled her eyes.

Hearing this, Qi Yang immediately braced himself and said, “I’m afraid? Why would I be afraid of him? I’m just about to settle the score with him! Let’s go!”

After saying that, the two of them walked towards Qin Yu.

On the way, Qi Yang kept praying in his heart, “I hope Qin Yu doesn’t dare to make a move, or else I’ll really have to go to the hospital...”

Very soon, the two of them arrived behind Qin Yu.

“You b*stard, you actually came!” Lin Wan shouted from behind.

Hearing the two of them shouting, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue turned their heads at the same time.

Looking at the two of them in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown and say, “Qi Yang, I was kind enough to show mercy to you, but you still want to find trouble?”

“I. . .” Qi Yang opened his mouth but didn’t dare to say anything for a moment.

“Cut the crap!” Lin Wan shouted loudly.

“What right do you have to participate in this kind of upscale cocktail party? You hurt my father. Do you think you will be let off the hook?” Lin Wan snorted and said.

“B*stard, you’d better disappear right now, or I’ll beat you to death!” Lin Wan shouted defiantly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Just as he was about to speak, Yan Ruoxue, who was beside him, suddenly said, “Who are you calling a b*stard?”
