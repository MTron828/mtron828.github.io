Chapter 642: Fighting Against the Eight Black-Gold Robe Powerhouses! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, Qin Yu was walking towards the Martial Arts Academy step by step.

He didn’t know that there was an ambush waiting for him.

Very soon, Qin Yu arrived at the entrance of the Martial Arts Academy.

He released his divine sense to investigate.

“Huh?”

Very soon, Qin Yu felt several powerful internal qi!

“Eight intermediate stage Martial Marquises?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Before he could react, these eight black-gold robe powerhouses had already arrived!

They hovered in eight different directions and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Black-robed man, today is the day you die!” A chill burst out from the eight people.

The internal qi on their bodies was extremely strong!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he couldn’t help but clench his fists.

“Even though I was so cautious, I still fell for it...” Qin Yu quickly understood.

He swept his gaze over these eight people, and quickly made a judgment.

The strength of these eight people wasn’t inferior to Yan Guiyi, and was even above Yan Guiyi’s!

Most importantly, they had made sufficient preparations!

“Oh no,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu might have the strength to fight against eight intermediate-stage Martial Marquises.

However, since they had set up an ambush, they must have made thorough preparations!

“I must think of a way to retreat quickly,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Black-robed man, surrender. We can let you die more painlessly,” someone in the air said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. His palm shook, and he held the scarlet bronze sword in his hand!

Then, Qin Yu slashed at them.

A blood-red sword light was about to cut through the air. It carried a sharp sword power and rippled.

“Clang!”

However, the other party only raised his hand slightly to block this attack!

“If we weren’t prepared, how would we dare to wait for you here?” They said coldly.

Qin Yu focused and saw that his hand was wrapped in a black-gold glove.

Obviously, this fist was also made of Black Gold Stone!

Qin Yu secretly felt that things were bad. He took a deep breath and gathered his spiritual energy on his legs.

In the next second, Qin Yu’s body flashed explosively to find an opening to escape!

But at this moment, a golden light suddenly flashed in the sky!

A magic artifact was suspended in the air, and it emitted waves of golden light!

The light formed a circle and blocked Qin Yu’s path!

“Do you think you can still escape?!” A fierce shout entered Qin Yu’s ears!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. It wouldn’t be so easy to escape today.

The black-gold robe powerhouses of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were divided into groups.

Each group had extremely tacit cooperation.

Moreover, the more people there were, the stronger they would be.

This was a group of eight people. Their strength was definitely above Yan Guiyi’s three-person group!

“Surrender!” A shout came like a lightning strike!

Qin Yu felt his eyes lose focus and almost fell to the ground!

“His voice contains a spiritual attack!” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly!

At the moment he lost focus, a beam of light shot out from the ground and sent Qin Yu flying!

“Swish! Swish! Swish!”

Before Qin Yu could get up, several beams of light like vines drilled out from the ground and bound Qin Yu’s entire body!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He tried to break out of this restraint, but he realized that these lights were both hard and soft. As long as Qin Yu exerted his strength, he would be tightly bound!

“It’s useless,” someone in the air said coldly.

“We’ve been waiting for you here for several days. How could we not be prepared?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “If I’m not wrong, the organizer of this operation... is Xia Hang, right?”

“It has nothing to do with you. You just need to know that you will definitely die today,” they replied coldly.

Qin Yu frowned. He tried to wave the bronze sword, but found that his wrist was tied up and he couldn’t move at all.

“Swish!”

At this moment, a sharp magic weapon shot toward Qin Yu!

This sharp blade was extremely vicious and was aimed at Qin Yu’s glabella!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He didn’t dare to be negligent and quickly activated the Saintly Body Technique to protect his body!

A ray of golden light lit up from Qin Yu’s body, and the area between Qin Yu’s glabella became even more resplendent!

“Clang!”

The sharp blade shot onto this golden light, causing a loud sound to ring out!

“Huh? Golden light? Interesting.” Seeing this scene, those people couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

“I remember that Qin Yu... was also covered in golden light. This kid can’t be related to Qin Yu, right?”

Qin Yu’s expression became a little ugly. He knew very well that once he used the Saintly Body Technique, there was a very high possibility of him being exposed!

However, Qin Yu had no other way at the moment. If he didn’t use the Saintly Body Technique, he would definitely die!

“Stop talking nonsense. Just kill him directly.” The few people looked at each other and said coldly.

They didn’t say anything more and walked toward Qin Yu in big steps.

However, at this moment, a golden light suddenly burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

A terrifying internal qi instantly burst out!

“Bang!”

The light surrounding Qin Yu was shattered!

Qin Yu left the silence. He waved his big hand and held the bronze sword again. He raised his hand and slashed out with the Nine Taiqing Slashes!

“Buzz!”

A terrifying sword light rose up. Qin Yu held the sword with both hands and slashed down ruthlessly!

“How brazen!” The few of them snorted. The eight of them activated their spells at the same time. In an instant, a huge circular plate condensed in the sky above them!

What was horrifying was that this circular plate actually swallowed the sword light directly!

“We’ll return it to you!” They snorted coldly. Then, they pushed with both hands. The sword light actually erupted from the circular plate and slashed toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He hurriedly held the bronze sword horizontally in front of him!

“Clang!”

At the instant of the collision, a loud explosion sounded out!

Even though Qin Yu used the bronze sword to block it, the terrifying power still sent Qin Yu flying dozens of steps! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What kind of spell is this?” Qin Yu looked at the circular plate in their hands and his expression couldn’t help but change.

At this moment, the huge circular plate turned into eight small circular plates hanging in each person’s palm.

“There’s more spells. Just use them,” the few people said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned and said in a low voice, “That disk seems to be a magic artifact... it can swallow my spiritual power.”

The essence of this sword light was formed by Qin Yu’s spiritual power.

In other words, the bronze sword was a vessel used to carry the spiritual power of the person holding the sword.

And the higher the level of this vessel, the greater the power it would unleash.

Therefore, a true master of swordsmanship had to rely on rich spiritual power or inner strength.

This was just Qin Yu’s guess. He didn’t know whether it was true or not.

Therefore, he immediately held his sword and slashed out a second time!
