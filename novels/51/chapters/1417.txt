Chapter 1418: Chapter 1,418, state your last words

The Great Elder’s entire body was exuding a surging killing intent. His hair was in a mess, and he looked somewhat pathetic.

However, the powerful aura from his body shocked everyone who was watching.

Qin Yu looked coldly at the Great Elder, he said, “What? You’ve been beaten up by me, and now you’re holding a grudge in your heart, right? You Don’t have the ability to kill me, so you have to rely on your sect master to help you? Hehe, the dignified number two figure of the heavenly cloud sect is actually such a good-for-nothing?”

The Great Elder was angered by Qin Yu to the point that his entire body was trembling. He was originally a person who was not good with words, so when he heard Qin Yu’s words, he simply could not reply.

“Little Bastard, if it wasn’t for your sneak attack, I wouldn’t have been injured by you!”The great elder gritted his teeth and said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You can’t blame me for this. If you want to blame someone, blame that pedantic ceremony of yours.”

“Pedantic ceremony? Let me tell you, that is my respect for the sect master, from the bottom of my heart!”The first elder shouted angrily.

The first elder wanted to continue speaking, but at this time, he seemed to have thought of something. He immediately sneered and said, “Little Bastard, is there a need for me to say so much to you? You are already a person on the verge of death.”

Having said that, the first elder did not say any more nonsense. His entire body was surging with energy as he stood up with his fingers.

That palm that was like dried wood was like a sharp blade as it ruthlessly grabbed towards Qin Yu’s chest!

“Clang!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A sound that sounded like steel clashing was instantly heard, and Qin Yu’s chest was actually completely undamaged.

The entire scene was completely silent, as if no one had expected such an outcome.

The awkward atmosphere roamed the entire scene.

And the first elder’s expression was incomparably unsightly!

“Hahahaha! First Elder, are you old? I’m tied up for you to kill, but you can’t kill me? hahaha!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

The surrounding people were also greatly shocked. They had all heard of Qin Yu’s peerless physical body, but they had never seen it before.

Seeing it today, it really lived up to its reputation!

“Little Bastard, don’t be happy too early!”The first elder roared angrily. All of his aura instantly gathered on his palm, and then he fiercely slapped towards Qin Yu!

This palm contained the power of a thousand catties. It was the gathering of anger, and its power was boundless.

Qin Yu naturally did not dare to be negligent. He directly opened the fifth level of the Dou character technique to resist this palm.

“Bang!”

The first elder’s palm fiercely slapped onto Qin Yu’s body.

But what shocked people was that Qin Yu was still unharmed!

“Hahahahaha!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh out loud again.

His laughter spread throughout the entire heavenly cloud sect. It was a little cheerful, but it was more arrogant!

“Did everyone see that? This is all the first elder of the Heavenly Cloud sect has! Did you all see that? !”Qin Yu roared crazily.

The first elder’s expression was extremely embarrassed and flustered. He stood there with no place to be ashamed. He wished he could find a hole to hide in.

Actually, Qin Yu knew very well that the reason why the first elder was so weak was because his injuries had not recovered at all.

However, Qin Yu naturally would not tell everyone the truth. He just wanted to crush the first elder’s mentality!

On the stage, the sect master’s expression was not good either.

He originally wanted to let the first elder handle this matter, but he did not expect to lose all face.

“You Little Bastard!”The first elder gritted his teeth, his face ashen.

As the first elder of the Heavenly Cloud sect, he had countless secret treasures and spiritual artifacts on him. If he used these spiritual artifacts, killing Qin Yu would be a piece of cake.

However, in front of so many people, if he used his secret treasures to kill someone who was tied up, he would definitely be laughed at by everyone.

The unwilling first elder gathered his spiritual energy again, planning to kill Qin Yu in one fell swoop.

Unfortunately, his third attack still failed.

Qin Yu was like steel. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t hurt him in the slightest.

The people below couldn’t hold back anymore. Everyone was amazed at Qin Yu’s ability.

“This Qin Yu’s body is really terrifying.”

“It can be described as abnormal. With such ability, no wonder the heavenly cloud sect went through so much trouble.”

“I wonder what the Great Elder is feeling now...”

“What can he be feeling? He is the champion of the Tianyun sect’s long-distance race.”

After saying that, the surrounding people laughed.

The Great Elder was completely enraged. He couldn’t care less about his face anymore. He immediately planned to use the phenomenon to get rid of Qin Yu.

This phenomenon was similar to Ling Yun’s. However, compared to Ling Yun’s phenomenon, the great elder’s was much stronger.

Just as the first elder was about to cast the phenomenon, the sect master appeared in front of Qin Yu in a flash.

He grabbed the first elder’s hand and shook his head. “You may leave.”

“Sect master, i...”

“Alright, you may leave.”The first elder wanted to say something but was interrupted by the sect master.

Even though the first elder was unwilling, he could only retreat to the side.

Seeing the sect master who suddenly walked over, everyone could not help but hold their breaths.

“It’s the sect master. The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect plans to personally make a move!”

“The sect master hasn’t made a move for many years. It’s said that when he expanded his territory back then, he beat all the sects until they could not breathe. In the end, all of them submitted to him.”

“Yeah, I didn’t expect him to make a move against a junior today.”

The crowd discussed animatedly, but the sect master turned a deaf ear to them.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said slowly, “Qin Yu, it seems that the Yan family won’t come to save you.”

Qin Yu’s face revealed a trace of solemnity.

He knew that the sect master’s strength was far above that of the first elder. The two of them could be said to be on a completely different level.

If he made a move, Qin Yu had no chance of escaping at all.

“What else do you want to say?”The sect master’s tone was ice-cold as he questioned.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He coldly said, “Look at the token on my waist. You will understand everything.”

The sect master glanced at Qin Yu’s waist and sneered, “What trick are you trying to play again?”

Qin Yu coldly said, “I have the Yan family’s token on my waist. You will naturally understand everything if you take it out.”

The sect master ridiculed, “Do you think I will take out the token? So what if you really have it? As long as I don’t look at it, I’m not guilty.”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly became extremely ugly. What he said was right. As long as they did not know the relationship between Qin Yu and the Yan family, the Yan family could not blame him.

“Qin Yu, you’d better take this opportunity to say your last words.”The sect master said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s expression was incomparably ugly. He had never thought that he actually didn’t even have the chance to take out his token.

“My last words are... F * CK You, Big Idiot!”Qin Yu cursed loudly.
