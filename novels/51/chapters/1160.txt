Chapter 1161: Chapter 1,161: Qin Yu escaped 

On the other side, Gu Xinghe had already invited people from all walks of life.

Apart from the martial arts world, people with prestige in the business world were also invited.

Even ye Qing had received an invitation.

This was enough to show how arrogant Gu Xinghe was.

Not only did he not avoid ye Qing, he even took the initiative to invite him.

This was both a demonstration and a provocation.

“Uncle Zhai Xing, follow me to the first mystic realm. Bring Qin Yu and the others out,”Gu Xinghe said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Zhai Xing did not say a word, but his heart was beating violently.

Finally, this day had come.

Gu Xinghe saw the expression on Zhai Xing’s face and could not help but sneer.

He really liked this feeling, this feeling of being trampled under the feet of someone who regarded everyone as a genius.

The two of them passed through the entrance and entered the first secret realm. Then, they walked towards the main hall.

The moment they stepped into the main hall, Gu Xinghe’s brows furrowed.

He swept his gaze around and realized that there seemed to be fewer people.

“HMM? Where’s Qin Yu? !”Very quickly, Gu Xinghe discovered that Qin Yu had disappeared without a trace!

He suddenly looked at the crowd and said coldly, “Speak, where did Qin Yu Go? !”

A terrifying killing intent pervaded the entire hall.

Meanwhile, Gu Xinghe’s emotions fluctuated, causing the air to tremble and Rumble!

“I’ve long said... Qin Yu and Yan Yongfu have come to an agreement... but you didn’t believe me...”Su Qi said somewhat mockingly.

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe’s face instantly turned extremely ugly!

He stretched out his palm, and a powerful suction force grabbed Su Qi in his hand!

Gu Xinghe grabbed Su Qi’s neck and said coldly, “What do you mean? Where did Qin Yu and Yan Yongfu Go? !”

Su Qi was almost suffocated by Gu Xinghe’s grab. She said with difficulty, “You... Let Go of me first...”

However, Gu Xinghe, who was in a rage, did not listen to her.

He glared at Su Qi and said furiously, “I’m asking you where Qin Yu went!”

“Let her go first. Otherwise, she will be strangled to death by you,”Zhai Xing reminded him.

Gu Xinghe glanced at Zhai Xing before throwing Su Qi to the side.

Su Qi coughed a little. She looked at Gu Xinghe coldly and said, “They have already run away.”

“Impossible! Absolutely impossible! His primordial spirit has already been bound by me, how could he run away!”Gu Xinghe said furiously.

Su Qi sneered, “Gu Xinghe, you know very little about Qin Yu. Back then, we were just like you. We didn’t kill Qin Yu immediately and allowed him to escape time and time again...”

“Let me tell you, as long as this child doesn’t die, he will have unlimited vitality!”

“Moreover, his ability to endure pain is much stronger than you think! You can go and regret it!”

Gu Xinghe’s expression was extremely complicated, and his expression changed again and again.

“I actually let him escape... Ah! ! !”Gu Xinghe raised his head and roared angrily! That terrifying internal Qi instantly shattered the Great Hall! Even the void started to crack at this moment!

Zhai Xing and the others were so shocked by this roar that they could not stop vomiting blood and knelt down on one knee!

Just a single roar had such terrifying power. This could not help but shock Zhai Xing greatly!

“I will definitely bring him back!”Gu Xinghe said through gritted teeth.

Su Qi sneered, “I’m just afraid that you won’t have the chance.”

Gu Xinghe suddenly looked at Su qi and asked, “What do you mean?”

Su Qi looked at the chain coldly and said, “Untie this first.”

“In Your Dreams!”Gu Xinghe rejected Su Qi mercilessly.

Su Qi also said stubbornly, “Then kill me. I will never tell you.”

Although Gu Xinghe was angry, he eventually waved his hand and let go of Su Qi.

At this moment, the pain that lingered around Su Qi’s body disappeared.

She took a deep breath, as if she was enjoying this ordinary comfort.

“Speak quickly,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Su Qi looked at gu xinghe and said, “When we captured Yan Ruoxue, it was precisely because we learned an important piece of news.”

“Once Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue combine, they will erupt with an extremely terrifying power.”

“It is said that this is a special kind of combination, a kind of combination born outside the Heavenly Dao.”

Speaking up to this point, Su Qi paused for a moment, a trace of ridicule flashed across her face, she said, “Yan Yongfu still has Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline in his hands. If Qin Yu obtains it, his already abnormal physique will advance even further. No one knows how strong he will become.”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe could not help but sneer, “With my current condition, I don’t care about his physique! No physique in the world is my match!”

“Oh? Is That So?”Su Qi’s face flashed with a hint of ridicule again.

“Let me tell you, once Qin Yu absorbs that bloodline, he might become a special existence.”

Gu Xinghe frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

Su Qi said indifferently, “Those horizontal ditches that can not be broken might be nothing in front of him.”

“It is very likely that he will defeat a mighty figure with the martial saint realm.”

When she said this, Su Qi paused again as if she felt that her words were not appropriate enough.

“No, perhaps he can crush a mighty figure, especially a mighty figure like you, Hahaha!”

Su Qi’s ear-piercing laughter made Gu Xinghe extremely annoyed.

With a wave of his hand, he directly smashed Su Qi’s mouth into pieces.

“Do you know where Yan Yongfu Is?”Gu Xinghe asked coldly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Su Qi merely shook her head and did not say a word.

Gu Xinghe took a deep breath and instantly felt a little worried.

Although he was extremely confident in his current strength, when he recalled the scenes from the past, the fear of being dominated by Qin Yu surfaced in his mind.

“Quick, go and find Qin Yu. No matter what price you have to pay, you must find Qin Yu!”Gu Xinghe hurriedly looked at Zhai Xing and shouted.
