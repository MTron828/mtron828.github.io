Chapter 828: The Techniques of the Hong Yi Sect

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, a subtle smile flashed across Wan Guqiong’s face.

“Qin Yu, are you that cautious?” Wan Guqiong asked.

“I’m afraid of being lied to, so I have to be cautious.” Qin Yu didn’t hide anything.

Wan Guqiong thought for a moment and said, “Alright, I’ll take a photo with my phone and send it to you.”

“Thank you very much.” Qin Yu bowed.

After that, Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He said goodbye to the two of them and left the Yao family home. He hurried towards the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Although Qin Yu was very confident in the Pavilion Master and Jiang He, he was still worried that she would be snatched away.

He rushed all the way to Qinghe town.

As soon as he got off the car, Qin Yu sensed that something was wrong.

The surrounding internal qi looked extremely calm, but this calmness seemed to contain a hidden killing intent.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and then said coldly, “Since you’re here, why are you hiding? Come out.”

Before he finished his words, several figures walked out from the darkness.

“Qin Yu, we meet again.”

The person who spoke was the elder of the Hong Yi Sect, Shen Yichun!

There were four people beside him!

The aura of these four people couldn’t be considered powerful, but their every move carried a strange internal qi.

“Shen Yichun, I let you run away last time. I didn’t expect you to dare to come again,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Shen Yichun smiled faintly and said, “I did underestimate you last time, but this time, we have prepared a foolproof plan.”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu’s expression became even colder.

“Qin Yu, Hong Yi Sect is quite interested in you. As I said, join us so that you can reunite with Yan Ruoxue. What do you think?” Shen Yichun said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “A bunch of treacherous people. I gave you a chance, but in the end, you schemed against me. Now, you still have the nerve to say such words?”

“Aren’t you also wary of us?” Shen Yichun snorted lightly.

“Qin Yu, as long as you agree to join us, I can make the decision and give you three Mystic Realms!”

“With your current condition, what you lack the most is spiritual energy, right? The Mystic Realms should be very important to you, right?”

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “You’re right, the Mystic Realms are indeed very important to me.”

“If I had three Mystic Realms, it would be enough to help me step into the half-step Martial Saint realm.”

“However, a noble man makes his wealth in ethical means. I don’t think there’s a need to work together with a sect like yours.”

Shen Yichun’s expression instantly turned cold.

“Then I won’t waste any more words with you. Hand over Yan Ruoxue and Zheng Ke!” Shen Yichun said coldly.

“Stop dreaming.” Qin Yu said with slight ridicule.

As he spoke, the internal qi on Qin Yu’s body rose rapidly.

At this moment, the power of a Martial Saint was fully displayed.

“I can use you guys to try out my new technique.” Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said.

However, at this moment, Shen Yichun took a step back.

“Qin Yu, I’m not stupid. You have the power of a Martial Saint. Of course, I have to avoid fighting you for now,” Shen Yichun said.

“The four of them are your opponents.”

Before he had finished speaking, the four of them immediately took a step forward.

Their bodies emitted a strange internal qi. This internal qi was filled with pressure.

Soon after, the four of them took out a token at the same time!

There were complicated talismans carved on this token. Rays of light emitted from it.

In just a moment, the space around Qin Yu became extremely strange.

The spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body was instantly suppressed!

Qin Yu frowned and said coldly, “What kind of technique is this?”

Shen Yichun laughed loudly and said, “This technique is specially used to deal with a half-step Martial Saint. In this space, your internal qi will be suppressed!”

“In other words, in this space, you are just an ordinary person and can’t use any spiritual power!”

Qin Yu frowned. He clenched his fist and tried to use the technique, but he failed.

“There’s such a strange technique?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Shen Yichun sneered and said, “Hong Yi Sect is a sect that has been around for hundreds of years. Its foundation is beyond your imagination!”

“Do it! Kill him!”

Following Shen Yichun’s order, these people quickly rushed towards Qin Yu!

With killing techniques in their hands, they approached Qin Yu from four tricky angles and went straight for Qin Yu’s vital points!

These four people were extremely fast, and Qin Yu had nowhere to hide! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Boom!”

The four spells fiercely hit Qin Yu’s body!

A puff of thick smoke billowed up, covering his vision!

“Humph, you don’t know what’s good for you.” Shen Yichun couldn’t help but sneer.

“Take his body back. The higher-ups want it.”

As soon as Shen Yichun finished his words, his expression changed drastically.

The four people were sent flying, and their chests caved in!

Shen Yichun’s expression changed drastically, and he exclaimed, “How is this possible?! Did the spells fail?!”

“Do you think that by suppressing my spiritual power, I will be at the mercy of others?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Elder Shen, the strength of this guy’s physical body... is too terrifying!” One of them said with difficulty.

Shen Yichun’s expression became even more unsightly.

Although these four people weren’t considered top-notch experts, they were all at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!

Four people at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm couldn’t defeat Qin Yu, who had his cultivation suppressed?

“My spiritual power has indeed been suppressed, but my physical body hasn’t changed.” Qin Yu clenched his fist.

“I’m afraid these few good-for-nothings won’t be able to kill me.”

Shen Yichun narrowed his eyes slightly and said in a low voice, “I’m afraid the Martial Saint’s power has even changed his physical body.”

Just as Shen Yichun had said, Qin Yu’s current physical body wasn’t even weaker than a Martial Saint’s!

“Fortunately, I was prepared.” Shen Yichun’s lips curled into a sneer.

He extended his palm and a broken blade appeared in his hand.

“A Martial Saint’s weapon?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

In a situation where his spiritual power was suppressed, it was difficult for Qin Yu to resist a Martial Saint’s weapon.

Especially when the person controlling the Martial Saint’s weapon was a half-step Martial Saint!

Shen Yichun held this sharp blade and said indifferently, “This isn’t an ordinary Martial Saint weapon, but a killing weapon. Its power is far above that of an ordinary Martial Saint weapon!”

Qin Yu felt a trace of a dangerous internal qi coming from it.

He frowned and immediately clenched his fists to break through this formation!

However, this formation was unbreakable. No matter how hard Qin Yu tried, he couldn’t use even a bit of the spiritual power in his body!

“Go to hell!”

Shen Yichun let out an angry roar. He grabbed the broken blade with both of his hands, and his internal qi surged toward the broken blade!

A trace of extremely powerful killing intent immediately spread out from the broken blade!

This killing intent was extremely terrifying, and it was also stained with a strong bloody aura!

“Go to hell!”

Shen Yichun grabbed the broken blade and hacked it toward Qin Yu fiercely!

Rays of light mixed with the Martial Saint’s internal qi and killing intent hacked toward Qin Yu!
