Chapter 989: Chapter 989, find the TAO technique! 

Looking at the Mad Qin Yu, everyone immediately scattered in fear.

They looked at Qin Yu as if they were facing a great enemy. The hostility in their eyes made the already angry Qin Yu even more furious!

“Don’t be afraid, everyone. Since we’re here, we naturally won’t let him do whatever he wants!”Gu Xinghe said confidently.

“Don’t worry, we won’t just sit and do nothing,”Wan Gu Qiong also said.

Then, he saw three martial saints walk out.

A cold smile hung on the corners of their mouths, and their bodies were even more arrogant.

Qin Yu once again suppressed his anger.

He looked at the crowd and said, “Since you all said it was me, then it’s me. From today onwards, I’ll leave the Hundred Spirit Society.”

“Leave? You can leave just because you want to?”Gu Xinghe raised his brows.

“Then we’ll have to ask if everyone agrees.”

After saying that, Gu Xinghe looked at the crowd and asked, “Do you agree with him leaving?”

After a short period of silence, someone quickly said in a low voice, “We can’t let him leave. If we let him leave, wouldn’t we be letting him become the next Sky Blood Rainbow?”

“That’s right! With the example from the past, we must eradicate the roots and kill him!”

“We definitely can’t let him leave Alive!”

The voices became louder and louder, and almost everyone pointed their spears at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, did you hear that? It’s not that I don’t want you to leave, but it’s that it’s hard to go against the will of the people!”Gu Xinghe said in a strange tone.

There was no longer a sorrowful expression on Qin Yu’s face. There was only a strong killing intent and crazy laughter!

“Hahahaha! Good, good!”Qin Yu’s laughter was like rolling thunder, causing everyone to be shocked!

At this moment, the wild beast that was suppressed in his body seemed to be completely unable to be stopped!

“Back then, I risked my life to save all of you. Now, all of you want me to die. Good!”Qin Yu shouted loudly.

The killing intent on his body had already erupted to the extreme and he could no longer endure it!

“Pay attention, capture him as soon as possible,”Gu Xinghe reminded.

“Mm.”The three martial saints moved forward at the same time.

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s figure suddenly disappeared and charged into the crowd!

He was like a wild beast that had gone mad, and more like he had lost his mind!

His large hand covered the area and directly smashed a head!

Wherever his palm passed, several people fell to the ground and could not get up!

His cruel methods were shocking!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu did not feel the slightest bit of guilt. Instead, he felt extremely carefree!

“You bunch of damnable things!”Qin Yu roared again and again!

“Hurry up and kill him!”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“I want to leave, but none of you can stop me!”Qin Yu roared.

After a furious roar, Qin Yu turned around and left like a gust of wind!

“You can’t Leave!”A martial saint shouted.

They hurriedly used their techniques to seal the space!

However, what shocked everyone was that Qin Yu had shattered the space with a single punch! Then, he turned around and left!

“I hope you don’t regret it, Hahaha!”Qin Yu’s crazy smile was still echoing.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with an intense killing intent.

Qin Yu had been suppressing this killing intent for a long time. Today, when he suddenly released it, Qin Yu only felt comfortable all over!

He quickly ran into the distance. After running for an unknown amount of time, the killing intent in his heart was slightly restrained.

Standing in this spacious area, Qin Yu didn’t say a word. His eyes looked into the distance.

“What? The feeling of being wronged by someone isn’t good, is it...”tie Dan said in a low voice.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He closed his eyes slightly, thinking about something.

Tie Dan thought that Qin Yu was feeling guilty, so he said, “When I first started killing, I was just like you. I felt very guilty... but they were malicious first, so I killed them.”

“You were the same. You risked your life to save them, but they saw you as an evil person. You deserved to kill them...”

Qin Yu remained silent. A moment later, he sat down cross-legged.

This made tie Dan even more confused.

“You...”

“Don’t speak!”

Tie Dan wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Qin Yu.

Seeing this, tie Dan could only shut his mouth.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly in this empty area.

A trace of internal Qi surrounded him.

In the air, there seemed to be golden rays of light gathering toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu just sat there, seemingly enjoying this feeling.

...

On the other side, Gu Xinghe was overjoyed!

He immediately arranged for people to make a statement on the martial arts forum!

He also posted the video of Qin Yu killing people in a frenzy on the martial arts forum!

When he saw that video, the condemnation of Qin Yu on the Internet increased exponentially!

Almost everyone was sure that Qin Yu was the murderer!

“Haha, hahahaha!”Seeing this, Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“See that? This is called killing the heart! Just a Little Qin Yu wants to fight with the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu? This is ridiculous!”

Long Mei and the others immediately flattered, “Young master gu is wise. With just a few tricks, you destroyed his reputation, Qin Yu...”

Gu Xinghe said calmly, “Does he really think it’s that easy to overthrow the martial arts association of Jingdu? What a joke!”

“Young master Gu, but that Qin Yu hasn’t been caught yet. Will there be any risk?”Long Mei asked.

Gu Xinghe smiled faintly, “He can’t escape. After such a thing happened, everyone sees him as an enemy. How can he escape?”

“What people fear the most is becoming the public enemy. Once he becomes the Public Enemy, there will be no place to hide!”

Long brows cupped his hands and said, “Young Master GU is wise!”

Just as they were “Happily enjoying themselves”, Zhai Xing walked in.

He glanced at GU xinghe and said, “Young master Gu, Yan Jinyao and the other young disciples have already tried to enter closed door cultivation to become a martial saint. It’s time for you to think about it.”

After saying this, Zhai Xing walked out.

Gu xinghe snorted lightly, “It’s effortless for me to become a martial saint.”

Of course, this was only what he thought. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Without a clear dao heart, becoming a martial saint was like ascending to the heavenly moat.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was still sitting cross-legged on this vast land.

The surrounding golden threads wrapped around Qin Yu’s body. These golden threads originated from the Great Dao!

After an unknown period of time, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes!

“I’ve finally found my own dao technique!”Qin Yu’s eyes were bright and full of vigor.
