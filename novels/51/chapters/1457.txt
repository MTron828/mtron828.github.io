Chapter 1458: Chapter 1,458, Dragon Drawing Divine Slash 1

All of Qin Yu’s spells were activated at this moment.

Battle word incantation, saintly body art. His entire body was enveloped in golden light, as if a deity had descended to the mortal world.

He stared at the white-robed Daoist not far away, his face emitting an icy cold killing intent.

The white-robed Daoist was not flustered. He had a void-returning artifact in his hands, so he naturally would not place Qin Yu in his eyes.

“Hand over the Huangji Buddhist flame and I’ll spare your life,”the white-robed Daoist coldly berated.

Qin Yu sneered, “That depends on whether you have the ability or not.”

The white-robed Daoist did not waste any words and immediately activated the virtual entity again!

Qin Yu had seen the power of this virtual entity, so he did not dare to be negligent. He immediately activated the Huangji Buddhist flame again, intending to resist this virtual entity.

At this moment, the void space trembled.

In a short moment, eighteen figures appeared in front of everyone.

Eighteen figures surrounded Qin Yu, giving off an imposing aura as a terrifying aura reverberated in the surroundings.

Seeing these eighteen figures, the white-robed Daoist couldn’t help but frown.

“I alone can kill Qin Yu.”The white-robed Daoist seemed somewhat unwilling.

But the eighteen figures completely ignored the white-robed Daoist. They were like machines, coldly looking at Qin Yu.

“It’s the eighteen gods of the Heavenly Cloud sect! It’s said that the eighteen gods are ruthless killing machines, incomparably powerful!”

“The Heavenly Cloud sect has used all their trump cards today. What are they trying to do!”

“It’s been too long since the southern region has experienced the terror of the Heavenly Cloud sect. I’m afraid this Qin Yu will suffer today.”

Qin Yu looked at the eighteen gods and felt a sense of foreboding.

For some reason, the eighteen gods did not have much aura fluctuations on their bodies, but they could make people feel terror from the bottom of their hearts.

“Damn it!”The white-robed Daoist cursed. He did not want to give up just like that. He immediately activated the void-returning artifact again, intending to Behead Qin Yu!

However, the eighteen gods were even faster than him!

They raised their palms at the same time, and beams of light that seemed to have control over order suddenly arrived!

It was unknown where this light came from. It was as if they had dragged it out from the void. It was incomparably terrifying!

The eighteen gods attacked at the same time, and the light suppressed towards Qin Yu!

This aura was terrifying. It even surpassed that void-returning artifact!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He did not dare to be negligent, and hurriedly activated his ten thousand arts shattering fist to meet this radiance!

“Boom!”

When the ten thousand arts shattering fist came into contact with this radiance, it was actually directly forced back!

That radiance had an extremely powerful suppressive force, as if it wanted to suppress Qin Yu Here! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! This was the first time that the ten thousand arts shattering fist had lost its effect!

“The Heavenly Cloud sect is indeed not simple!”Qin Yu thought to himself that things were not looking good. He immediately activated the ‘action’word formula, intending to leave this place.

However, it was already too late to retreat now!

The radiance tore through the void, directly pressing down on Qin Yu’s shoulders!

In just an instant, Qin Yu felt that his shoulders were bearing the power of heaven and earth, incomparably heavy!

His body was quickly crushed, almost crushed by this light!

“Ah! !”Qin Yu’s mouth roared repeatedly, trying his best to break through this power!

However, Qin Yu’s spiritual power had recovered to the limit, and he was still unable to stop this light’s tendency.

The eighteen gods coldly looked at Qin Yu who was struggling, and there was not the slightest expression on their faces.

According to this trend, Qin Yu would probably be crushed into minced meat, and at that time, even his primordial spirit would not be able to escape!

Just as the radiance was about to crush down and everyone was about to leave, a streak of golden light suddenly shot out!

In the next second, Qin Yu’s body was bathed in golden light. His body was rapidly expanding!

Even that radiance could not stop Qin Yu’s body from expanding!

In a short instant, the radiance was directly shattered! And Qin Yu’s body had already grown to several meters tall. He was like a giant!

“Eh?”

The eighteen gods frowned slightly, as if they did not expect Qin Yu to escape.

Qin Yu looked down at his own body, only to feel cold sweat flowing down his back.

If he had not used the limitless dharma idol at the critical moment, he might have been crushed to death by this light!

“What kind of spell is this?”The surrounding crowd seemed to have never seen such a spell before, and their eyes revealed astonishment.

Under the support of the limitless dharma idol, Qin Yu’s aura also increased by a few points.

Not only that, his body was huge, and he did not sacrifice his speed.

Qin Yu looked at the eighteen gods and immediately clenched his fist and smashed it!

This punch was like a meteorite falling from the sky, incomparably terrifying. Even the void could not withstand this enormous force and was directly shattered!

However, the eighteen god-men instantly disappeared without a trace. In the next second, they reappeared from afar.

The eighteen god-men’s faces turned ice-cold. They used the same trick again. The eighteen men stretched out their palms at the same time.

An even more magnificent light suddenly appeared! This time, the light directly transformed into the shape of a chain and instantly bound Qin Yu’s hands and feet!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He tried to struggle, but he found that he could not break free at all.

The chain came from somewhere unknown. It seemed to have no source, but it also seemed to have been born in the primal chaos, without a trace.

Even though Qin Yu tried his best to break free, the chain did not move at all.

The eighteen gods looked at Qin Yu coldly, and then reached out their hands again.

“Dragon drawing... Divine Slash!”

The eighteen people’s mouths spoke at the same time!

In the next second, an extremely terrifying light condensed in their hands. It was as if a swimming dragon had appeared in the air, and it was also like a sharp blade. It changed endlessly as it headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He struggled crazily, but he was still unable to break free from this chain!

“Chi la!”

The Dragon Lure divine slash slashed fiercely across Qin Yu’s body!

A bloody scar instantly appeared on Qin Yu’s incomparably huge body!

This bloody scar was more than ten centimeters deep, and one could almost see the white bones hidden in his body!

Fresh blood poured out like a rain of blood, and the scene was immediately filled with an extremely strong bloody smell!

“Eh?”

The eighteen gods seemed to be quite surprised, and their eyes revealed a puzzled look.

The white-clothed Daoist by the side couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

“This child’s physical body is truly terrifying,”the white-robed Daoist said in a low voice.

The surrounding people also whispered amongst themselves, “It’s said that even void-level experts wouldn’t dare to take the eighteen gods’dragon drawing divine slash head-on.”

“That’s right. Back then, the dragon drawing divine slash had killed countless peak-stage mighty figures. There were even half-step void-level experts who almost lost their lives to this technique.”

“Just what kind of background does this Qin Yu have? His physical body is so terrifying, and his technique is also extremely strange. I’ve never heard of such a technique in the southern region.”
