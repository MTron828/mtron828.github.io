At this moment, Yan Ruoxue no longer cared about the many people there and responded to Qin Yu passionately.

The love of human cultivators was even more difficult compared to ordinary people.

It had been nearly 300 years since they were on Earth, but they barely saw each other.

Even at this point, there were still many difficulties.

To make it to this day, even the ones who supported them, Lei Xin and Flower Granny, found it unbelievable.

“Small kids are not allowed to watch.”

Jue Wu quickly hugged Xiaoru and Little Fatty in her arms to prevent them from learning bad things.

After a long time, Qin Yu finally left those alluring cherry lips.

“Ruoxue, don’t worry. A mere ghost race can’t stop me.”

At this moment, Qin Yu felt that no matter what difficulties he would face, he could solve them.

He arrogantly pulled Yan Ruoxue into his arms and started to boast.

“Sister-in-law, this isn’t good. I felt this guy’s spirit is floating in the air right now.”

Jue Wu said worriedly.

Yan Ruoxue blushed like a ripe apple. She could not hear Jue Wu’s words at all.

She covered her face with her small hands. Only then did she remember that there were so many people around.

Stinky Qin Yu! He dared to bully her with so many people around!

She pinched Qin Yu’s waist tightly with one hand, causing him to grimace in pain.

Jue Wu rolled her eyes and looked at the two of them, knowing what she said was in vain.

“Big brother Qin Yu, you must not die. If you encounter those old farts, you must be careful. According to my analysis, these old farts’ cultivation are generally quite high.”

Not knowing what to say, Chang Mang casually said a few words.

“You’re right. I also realized the newborns are usually babies,” Qin Yu said unhappily.

“Elder Guai, Ruoxue, I’ll leave the Sumeru ring to you.”

Qin Yu placed the Sumeru ring in Elder Guai’s hand, turned to Immortal Emperor Yao, and said.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, your three souls and seven spirits have long been shattered and returned to the reincarnation cycle. However, among the one soul and three spirits derived from the Immortal Emperor’s body, one soul and two spirits are in the ghost realm. Do you dare to come with me to the ghost realm?”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s eyes shone with divine light. He had been using his body as a tool to seal the last bit of his soul power in his body, and it had been indeed too long. He, in a daze, did not know how long it had been and had even forgotten the meaning of his existence.

At this moment, in the face of Qin Yu’s suggestion, his soul broke out of his body almost without hesitation.

And then, just like the Heart of Thunder, the soul entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness through a specific method.

Qin Yu was shocked. His power of divine sense scanned through his entire soul, but he still could not find where Immortal Emperor Yao was hiding.

It was a great supernatural power that could perform an extraordinary and deceptive act. Even if he had previously opened an acupoint to suppress the black Qin Yu, he could still sense the location of that acupoint.

At this moment, Immortal Emperor Yao seemed to have disappeared. He could not sense it at all. Was this a method to jump out of the Path of Heaven? Qin Yu did not overthink about it.

A dark brown soul power soared into the sky. Qin Yu’s level two desolate divine eyes opened suddenly.

After he captured the power of the ghost realm, his soul had already attached itself to the line of rules.

As this line of rules climbed up, it suddenly arrived at the sea of the Path of Heaven. It was an extremely long road.

Qin Yu felt that the sharp straight line of rules cut his divine soul until he was covered in blood.

Furthermore, along the way, countless fierce winds pierced through his soul, making it even weaker.

The time between the soul and the comprehension in the real world was even longer.

He might have felt a long time had passed, but in reality, it was only a moment.

Just like when he encountered the scholar, Jun Yixian’s reincarnations of a hundred lifetimes, it was merely the blink of an eye in reality.

Moreover, during the process of climbing, the further the soul was away from the true body, the faster the consumption of the power of the soul. He had to seize the time.

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have seen something along with the movement of his soul. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the myriad of worlds, there were four major races. They were the human race, the ghost race, the demon race, and the monster race. There were also countless other races, but their overall strength was too small to be detected by the power of the Path of Heaven.

Surrounding the lowest bottom of the myriad of worlds was the power of the human race’s Path of Heaven. This power gathered various powers of rules and finally formed a vast ocean.

Billions of humans explored this enormous sea of the Path of Heaven and slowly grew stronger. Some Immortal Emperors even jumped out of the power of the Path of Heaven.

At this moment, while roaming, Qin Yu discovered many places had dried up, and the sea of the Path of Heaven had long disappeared.

Enormous ravines appeared in many places, indicating these places should once have surging power of the Path of Heaven.”

In that dried-up land, numerous Soul Statues were lying on the ground in a disorderly manner.

Some had been worn out to the point they could no longer be identified. Some nad turned Into countless massive fragments, and some almost fused witn tne dried-up seabed, unable to tell they were condensed Soul Statue.

This also corresponded to the gradual decline of the human race’s power of the

Path of Heaven, and the further down level of the human race’s power of the Path of Heaven was Qin Yu’s destination, the sea of the Path of Heaven of the ghost realm.

This location was the place Qin Yu was most familiar with, which was purgatory.

The purgatory was the intersection point between the ghost realm’s and the human race’s river of the Path of Heaven.

Between the two overlapping shadows was the weakest point between the two races.

After stepping into this layer of the sea of the Path of Heaven, Qin Yu felt that he had arrived in a turbulent current.

The sea of the Path of Heaven here was turbulent, and every trace of the power of rules was like a knife.

It was the place of the end of the vortex.

The intersection and fusion of the power of the two Paths of Heaven caused the power of rules here to be tremendously chaotic.

Suddenly, an enormous skull appeared at the bottom of the sea of the Path of

Heaven.

It was a ghost race whose consciousness was as vast as the galaxy. His soul was as bright as the sun, and Qin Yu could feel a terrifying pressure on him. The power of this ghost race should be about the same as Lei Huan.

“I want to go back, boohoo! Please let me go back, I beg you!”

The ghost race actually sent out obscure divine sense fluctuations. It was a desperate plea, and he rushed into the turbulence regardless of everything.

However, in less than five breaths, the ghost race let out a desperate scream.

His soul rapidly depleted, turning into countless specks of light that fused into the sea of the Path of Heaven.

Qin Yu was scared out of his wits and thought of something terrifying.

The fact that this ghost race could transmigrate here meant that he had already transmigrated through the ghost race’s sea of the Path of Heaven.

This meant that this ghost race’s soul was much stronger than his, but still unable to cross the two realms.

It was likely that the power of rules at this intersection of the two realms had an unimaginable killing intent.

“Forget it. I’m already here.”

Qin Yu roared. He was now very far away from his true body, and for every second he waited, he would consume a vast amount of soul power.

He could now only hope that his thoughts were correct. Otherwise, he would probably become a tonic for the sea of the Path of Heaven today..
