Chapter 1585: Chapter 1585, eight demon transformations! 1

The dazzling golden radiance and the mysterious and Strange Black Lotus finally collided.

Everything in the surroundings was instantly torn apart like paper. Everything was instantly turned into ashes.

What kind of terrifying power was this? It could be said to be world-shaking!

Even in the entire southern province, there were very few people who could withstand this technique!

Qin Yu, who had gained enlightenment, had an unprecedented power of ten thousand spell breaking punch. However, that was, after all, the godly king of the northern lands. It was the strongest attack of the strongest expert in the northern lands!

In front of the Black Lotus, Qin Yu was still forced back.

His body continued to retreat, leaving a long scar on the ground.

Qin Yu’s entire body glowed with golden light. His internal Qi had erupted to the extreme, but he was still unable to stop the Black Lotus!

Not far away, the two godly monarchs revealed shocked expressions. They did not expect that Qin Yu would not be crushed by the Black Lotus in a head-on clash!

“No wonder so many people think highly of him,”said a godly monarch in a deep voice.

“But it’s a pity that it’s useless. He’s going to die today. The other godly monarch has also arrived by his side.

Not far away, the black lotus was hovering above Qin Yu’s head, constantly pressing down.

Qin Yu used all his strength, desperately supporting his body, but he was still unable to block the Black Lotus.

He felt as if all the bones in his body were about to be crushed, and even his divine sense was being crushed!

“It’s useless,”the godly monarch said coldly.

He watched coldly as Qin Yu’s body was crushed one by one. A cold smile could not help but appear on his face.

However, at this moment, the internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body suddenly soared once again! The originally dim radiance bloomed once again like a ray of sunlight that pierced through dark clouds!

This was the Beast Spirit Pill! It was the Beast Spirit Pill that Qin Yu had refined during his previous experiments!

Under the enhancement of the Beast Spirit Pill, Qin Yu’s rationality was suppressed, but his strength had received an extremely strong increase!

The Black Lotus was pushed up inch by inch by Qin Yu, and his mouth let out a beast-like roar!

“HMPH, it’s a pill,”said the godly monarch coldly.

“That’s right. This child has indeed consumed some unknown pill, but even so, he is unable to resist the Black Lotus,”said another godly monarch.

Just as they were discussing, Qin Yu, who had consumed the beast spirit pill, had indeed improved greatly. However, against the Black Lotus, he still appeared to be lacking in strength.

The difference in strength between the two was simply too great. This godly monarch had already stepped into the half-step void-return realm, while Qin Yu was merely a newly advanced mighty figure. How could he be a match for the two!

Rumble..

The black lotus emitted rays of black light, and the power became even heavier.

Qin Yu, who had just had the momentum to counterattack, was now suppressed once again.

If this continued, he was afraid that he would be crushed to pieces by the Black Lotus!

Under the Black Lotus, Qin Yu’s head was covered in sweat and blood. He gritted his teeth, but he was unable to do anything to the Black Lotus.

“Looks like I can only use that move...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

He still had a technique that was useless. That was the eight demon transformations that Wen Wanji had imparted to him!

Once this technique was used, it would completely descend into madness, and one’s strength would also receive a huge increase!

Compared to the eight demon transformations, even the effects of the beast spirit pill were not worth mentioning!

Qin Yu originally did not want to use this technique, but the effects of the fighting word formula were about to disappear. At that time, he was afraid that he would completely become the plaything of the two!

Not far away, the two godly monarchs were looking at Qin Yu coldly.

Cold smiles hung on their faces, as if they had already seen the scene of Qin Yu’s body falling.

But at this moment, the golden light under the Black Lotus suddenly emitted a red light.

The two kinds of lights interweaved at this moment, and a crazy intent surged out!

“Oh? What is this?”The two godly monarchs said with some surprise.

With a glance, they saw that the black lotus that was crushing down was actually being pushed up bit by bit!

In the next second, the Black Lotus was instantly knocked out violently by Qin Yu!

“AH...”

Qin Yu’s mouth let out a beast-like roar. His scarlet eyes were staring fixedly at the two godly monarchs!

The eight demon transformation was a top divine skill, and it was also a spell that Wen Wanji relied on to support himself!

It was precisely because of this spell that he was able to run amok in the southern region, and even the Heavenly Cloud sect did not dare to provoke him!

In addition to Qin Yu’s line word formula, Beast Spirit Pill, and Divine Dragon Power, all the spells surged and overlapped at this instant. The power was unimaginable!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar. In the next second, his figure suddenly disappeared, and he instantly appeared in front of this godly monarch!

The expressions of the two godly monarchs changed slightly. They had already sensed the strangeness on Qin Yu’s body.

The terror of this power made even them feel a trace of fear!

One of the godly monarchs raised his hand to meet Qin Yu’s fist. However, in just an instant, he was sent flying by Qin Yu!

“Not good!”The other godly monarch seemed to have sensed something.

He hurriedly shouted, “It’s Wen Wanyu’s eight demon transformations! Hurry up and stay away from him!”

However, how could the mighty godly monarch give up just like that? He got up from the ground and said coldly, “So what if it’s the eight demon transformations? Why would I be afraid of him! I will definitely kill him today!”

With that said, the godly monarch leaned forward. His entire body erupted with black radiance as he charged straight at Qin Yu!

At that moment, Qin Yu had already lost his rationality. He was like a wild beast, with only the most primitive attacks!

The two of them engaged in an intense battle in midair. For a moment, there were incessant explosions. All of the DAO technique and laws had lost their effects at that moment! It was because Qin Yu’s physical body was too powerful. His physical body was already sufficient to sever everything!

When the other godly monarch saw this scene, he could not help but frown.

“The eight demon transformations indeed live up to their reputation,”he said softly.

The other godly monarch also sensed that something was amiss. How did Qin Yu’s strength increase so much? It was not inferior to his own!

“Come back. The eight demon transformations won’t be able to hold on for long. At that time, he will become a cripple,”said another godly monarch coldly.

Hearing this, the godly monarch who was in the middle of the battle could not help but grit his teeth. In the end, he still listened to his suggestion and shot backward.

“The eight demon transformations is the Wen family’s legacy spell. Rumor has it that its origin is the great Yue mountain. It must not be underestimated,”a godly monarch said coldly.

“HMPH, I really can’t accept this. This child is merely a newly advanced mighty figure. I actually did not manage to kill him...”

“It doesn’t matter. As long as he uses the eight demon transformations, he will be no different from a beast without intelligence. Just wait. Before long, he will definitely die.”

The two of them looked coldly at Qin Yu. Qin Yu, who should have attacked without thinking, was now standing there.

His eyes were suffused with a red light, but under this red light, one could actually see a trace of reason!

This look, and the lack of intelligence of the demonic beast is completely different!Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
