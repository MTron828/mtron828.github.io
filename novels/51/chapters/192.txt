Hearing Sun Yumei’s words, Uncle Zhong’s face turned cold.

“Do you know who this is? Watch your manners!” Uncle Zhong shouted.

Sun Yumei sneered, “I don’t care who you are. What can Qin Yu’s friend be? Are you guys going to scram or not? If you don’t, Don’t blame me for being impolite!”

After saying that, Sun Yumei picked up the broom and smacked it towards Jiang Gu!

“A mere ant dares to shout at me. You’re pulling the bell of death!” Jiang Gu waved his hand and Sun Yumei was sent flying!

Su Wen’s expression suddenly changed! He hurriedly ran over to hug Sun Yumei and shouted in pain, “Yumei! !”

However, Sun Yumei had stopped breathing, and her signs of life had completely disappeared!

Jiang Gu looked at Su Wen coldly as if he was waiting for his next move.

However, he never expected that not only did Su Wen not have any intention of taking revenge, he even knelt on the ground with a plop!

“Please forgive me! We were stupid to treat you like that! Please have mercy and spare my life...” Su Wen’s entire body trembled as he said in fear.

Jiang Gu and Uncle Zhong exchanged looks and couldn’t help but sneer.

“What a coward! No wonder Qin Yu ran away like a chicken. It seems cowardice runs in your family!” Jiang Gu sneered.

“Tell me, where is Qin Yu?” Uncle Zhong asked.

Su Wen hurriedly shook his head and said, “I don’t know. We have nothing to do with Qin Yu, but... I know where he usually lives!”

“Tell me,” Uncle Zhong said coldly.

“In the Dragon Paradise Villa!” Su Wen hurriedly said.

Jiang Gu and Uncle Zhong looked at each other, then turned around and left.

Su Wen sat on the ground and looked at Sun Yumei’s corpse. A trace of pain flickered across his face.

“It’s all Qin Yu’s fault. Qin Yu, you harmed my entire family!” Su Wen gritted his teeth and raised his head to roar!

...

Jiang Gu and Uncle Zhong came to Qin Yu’s residence.

There was no one here, but the environment was rather elegant.

Jiang Gu violently broke open the door and strode into the villa.

“Zhong, spread the news, I, Jiang Gu, invite all influential figures of Jiangcheng to have a chat,” said Jiang Gu indifferently.

Uncle Zhong hurriedly nodded and said, “Understood.”

That day, all the famous people of Jiangcheng were invited.

As Qin Yu’s representative, Lei Hu was naturally the first to be invited.

Looking at the invitation letter placed in front of him, Lei Hu’s expression was extremely pale.

“Brother Hu, you can’t go there! This is definitely a trap!”Lei Hu’s underling exclaimed.

“That’s right! If you go there, Jiang Gu will definitely let you have it!”

Lei Hu’s was also somewhat afraid.

After all, Jiang Gu was an incredible big shot in Chuzhou. When he became famous, Lei Hu was still just a small hooligan.

Lei Hu held the invitation letter in his hand. He gritted his teeth, stood up, and said, “Someone has to face Jiang Gu in Jiangcheng. Otherwise, no one knows what he will do.”

At this moment, Lei Hu was quite responsible.

Moreover, Lei Hu was also afraid that this matter would have a negative influence on his family.

“Which one of you is willing to go with me?” Lei Hu’s eyes roamed across the crowd.

The group of underlings kept silent. No one spoke.

Lei Hu shook his head and smiled bitterly. “Forget it, I’ll go alone.”

“Brother Hu, I’ll go with you.” At this moment, Lance took one step forward.

Lei Hu opened his mouth. He patted Lance’s shoulder and said, “You’re a true friend! If I can make it out alive, I’ll give you a promotion!”

In the evening.

All the famous people of Jiangcheng gathered in Dragon Paradise Villa.

Everyone was frightened and uneasy. They walked together and discussed in horror.

“It’s all Qin Yu’s fault. This bastard ran away on his own and made us take the fall!”

“Yeah, I knew he wasn’t a good guy!”

“Qin Yu is just a coward. He doesn’t even have the courage to face Jiang Gu. He’s such a worthless so-and-so!”

“If anyone dares to talk nonsense again, don’t blame me for tearing his mouth apart!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came over.

Turning around, they saw Lei Hu and Lance walking over.

Facing Lei Hu, everyone still had some fear in their hearts.

For a moment, all the people quieted down.

Lei Hu swept his gaze over everyone and said coldly, “You all have made lots of money out of Soul Nourishment Pill, haven’t you? Why didn’t you say anything when you were earning money? If you can talk nothing but sh*t, then shut up!”

Although everyone kept silent at Lei Hu’s words, in their heads, they had cursed Lei Hu as much as they could.

Lei Hu snorted lightly and went into the villa with Lance.

After Lei Hu had left, these people started cursing, “Who do you think you are? You’re just a minion!”

“Lei Hu is Qin Yu’s number one minion. Let’s see how much longer he can remain arrogant!”

In the villa.

Jiang Gu stood in a higher place and looked down on everyone.

To Jiang Gu, these so-called important figures in front of him were just ants. They were not worth looking at.

It was very quiet inside the hall. No one dared to say anything.

“What’s your relationship with Qin Yu?” At this moment, Uncle Zhong opened his mouth.

Hearing this, everyone hurriedly said, “Mr. Jiang, we have nothing to do with Qin Yu!”

“Yes! We have disliked him so long!”

“Mr. Jiang, please get rid of this evil bast*rd for us!”

Everyone shouted loudly, belittling Qin Yu as if he was a worthless rat.

Jiang Gu enjoyed this feeling very much.

He liked to be praised as if he was a God, and he enjoyed looking down on all livings.

“A clever guy knows when the right time to jump ship is. As long as you all distance yourselves from Qin Yu, we, the Jiang family, will not do anything to you,” Uncle Zhong said indifferently.

“Don’t worry, Qin Yu is just a loser! Who would take a fancy to him?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Exactly, how could Qin Yu have the qualifications to be on par with you!”

“We are willing to follow Mr. Jiang!”

“Follow me?” Jiang Gu raised his eyebrows.

He sneered, “Do you guys think you deserve a leader like me?”

As soon as he said this, the atmosphere became extremely awkward.

“In my eyes, you are just a bunch of reptiles. I’m in a good mood, so I don’t have to step on you to death,” Jiang Gu said coldly.

The famous figures of Jiangcheng immediately looked embarrassed.

“Mr. Jiang... Mr. Jiang is right!” Someone shouted.

“We are just ants. It’s our honor to meet Mr. Jiang!”

Looking at everyone’s attitude, Lei Hu couldn’t help but curse in his head.

“Who’s Lei Hu?” At this moment, Uncle Zhong suddenly looked around.

Everyone cast a look at Lei Hu in unison.

Lei Hu’s expression changed slightly. He brought himself to stand up and said, “M-Mr. Jiang, I’m Lei Hu...”

“I heard that you have a good relationship with Qin Yu?” Jiang Gu narrowed his eyes and asked.

Lei Hu’s heart pounded, and he didn’t know what to say for a moment.

“That’s right, Mr. Jiang. Lei Hu is Qin Yu’s loyal minion!”

“Yes, just now he was talking nonsense at the door, saying that he would kill you like killing a dog when Qin Yu comes back!”

“Mr. Jiang, you can’t let up on him!”
