Chapter 579: Facing Yan Guiyi! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Guiyi wasn’t angry at all. He said with a smile, “I know you have quite some tricks up your sleeve, but I advise you to put away your arrogance because it will bring you disaster.”

Qin Yu looked at Yan Guiyi coldly, and the internal qi on his body slowly rose.

Yan Guiyi continued, “I’ve seen a lot of people like you. Usually, there are only two outcomes.”

“Either you die, or you compromise. As for the third outcome, I’ve never seen it before.”

“Go to h*ll. Why do you have so much nonsense to say?” Qin Yu sneered.

As he spoke, a golden light suddenly appeared on Qin Yu’s body, and a terrifying internal qi immediately swept over.

“Since the Jingdu Martial Arts Association sent you here, you must have quite some tricks up your sleeve. I hope you won’t disappoint me.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s figure suddenly whispered and shot towards Yan Guiyi!

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes. He stretched out his palm and a black-gold light immediately condensed in front of him!

This light was like an iron plate blocking in front of Yan Guiyi.

Qin Yu punched out. This light emitted a loud bang and cracks appeared on it!

Yan Guiyi said in surprise, “You actually broke my Black Gold Heavenly Gate. You really have quite some tricks up your sleeve.”

Qin Yu was also extremely shocked.

He knew about the power of his punch very clearly. It could even break a small mountain!

But now, it only left a crack on the Black Gold Heavenly Gate!

Yan Guiyi put his hands behind his back and sneered. “If that’s all you have, you’d better come back with me obediently.”

“You talk too much nonsense!” Qin Yu shouted coldly and stepped forward again!

The Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist was unleashed to the maximum at this moment, and it was heading straight for Yan Guiyi’s face!

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes. He didn’t dodge, but chose to face Qin Yu head-on!

The two fists collided at this moment with a trembling sound!

At the moment of contact, streams of black and gold light burst out from Yan Guiyi’s body and enveloped his entire body!

“Clang!”

A loud sound rang out, and Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

Not only did this punch fail to hurt Yan Guiyi in the slightest, it even shook his wrist until it hurt!

“How could this be?!” Qin Yu’s expression changed!

Qin Yu had never been afraid of anyone when it came to his physical body! But Yan Guiyi was actually tougher than him!

“It is said that the chaotic body is unparalleled in the world. It really lives up to its reputation.” Yan Guiyi sneered.

He glanced at his fist and then said indifferently, “It seems that the higher-ups’ judgment is right. In time, you might really be able to change the entire martial arts world.”

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to listen to his nonsense. He looked at Yan Guiyi coldly and kept thinking of countermeasures in his mind.

“Bring it on, let’s see how strong your internal qi is.” The internal qi on Yan Guiyi’s body began to surge!

At the same time, the four of them shot out!

The four of them stood in four different directions. They took out a magical artifact.

The magical artifact was suspended in four different directions, and in the end, it flickered with dazzling rays of light!

The rays of light seemed to confine the space before wrapping the space into a cube!

Yan Guiyi sneered. “Qin Yu, you can’t escape anymore.”

Qin Yu looked around. The four lights seemed to confine Qin Yu and Yan Guiyi into the square.

“Since I can’t escape, I’ll kill you.” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with killing intent, and the Divine Dragon Power lit up on his forehead.

Yan Guiyi’s expression finally turned cold at this moment.

“In that case, don’t blame me for being rude,” Yan Guiyi said with a cold snort.

With a loud shout, his body turned into a black-gold light and shot toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately used the Saintly Body Technique and met the attack head-on!

This was a collision of physical bodies, and the clattering sounds could be heard.

Both of them seemed to have extremely strong physical bodies. Every collision would cause the space to shake!

In the blink of an eye, the two parties had already exchanged dozens of punches!

The two rays of light clashed together, and it was difficult for them to come to a standstill for a moment!

“Clang!”

It was another head-on clash of fists!

Qin Yu only felt as if his bones were about to be shattered! His thumb and forefinger even cracked!

“How could this be!?” Qin Yu lowered his head to look at his bloody fist, and his expression couldn’t help but turn somewhat ugly!

With his current physical body, it was impossible for him to be defeated by an opponent in the Martial Marquis Realm!

How did Yan Guiyi do it?!!

“Qin Yu, die!” Yan Guiyi roared angrily, and the terrifying fist force rushed toward Qin Yu again!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, roared angrily, and activated his Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, Yan Guiyi’s fist suddenly changed direction and smashed into Qin Yu’s chest!

“Bang!”

Qin Yu instantly shot to the ground like a bullet!

A huge hole was created in the ground, and the golden light on Qin Yu’s body was smashed into pieces!

“Hahaha!” Yan Guiyi couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

He patted his chest and said indifferently, “My whole body is made of Holy Metal Stone. Even if you have great strength, you can forget about hurting me.”

Holy Metal Stone?

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He suddenly thought of something!

Could it be that Yan Guiyi was wearing the same material as the prison of Jingdu Martial Arts Association?

If that was the case, then it was understandable.

Qin Yu got up from the ground.

He raised his head to look at Yan Guiyi, and a serious expression appeared on his face.

If he continued to fight like this, he might really be captured by Yan Guiyi.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, and his internal qi was rapidly rising.

Then, beams of golden light began to converge, and Qin Yu’s body began to expand!

“Cosmic form!”

When he saw this technique, Yan Guiyi’s eyes immediately flashed with a hint of shock! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Qin Yu really controls the cosmic form!”

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu’s body had already expanded to more than three meters tall!

His muscles tensed up, and his body had reached its peak!

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes and said, “It’s said that the cosmic form is a lost Divine Rank sacred technique. I’ve finally seen it today...”

“Bring it on, let me see this Divine Rank sacred technique!” Yan Guiyi roared angrily. His internal qi soared, and he rushed toward Qin Yu!

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly raised his hand slowly, and a purple flame instantly landed on his palm!

This flame was the spiritual fire that was able to destroy everything!

Qin Yu waved his hand, and threw the spiritual fire directly at Yan Guiyi!

Yan Guiyi couldn’t dodge in time, and could only let the spiritual fire land on his body!

“Whoosh!”

In an instant, sparks flew in all directions, and Yan Guiyi’s entire body turned purple!

The flames burned on his body

Faced with this purple spiritual fire, Yan Guiyi didn’t panic at all.

His body shook, and an intense cold gas appeared all over his body!

Under this cold gas, the flames actually began to disappear!

Then, Yan Guiyi stepped forward again!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He didn’t dare to be negligent, and immediately clenched his fist!

“Boom!”

There was a deafening sound. It seemed that all of Yan Guiyi’s inner strength was gathered on this punch!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!!”

Qin Yu’s body immediately took a few steps back!

Even with the support of the cosmic form, it was still difficult for Qin Yu to defeat Yan Guiyi!

“It’s a pity that the cosmic form is in your hands,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

“If you are willing to hand over the cosmic form, I might consider sparing your life.”

Qin Yu looked at Yan Guiyi coldly and said, “There’s no other way. It’s the only way.”

Qin Yu closed his eyes, as if he was activating some kind of spell.

In a moment, the internal qi on Qin Yu’s body began to surge!

The golden light on his body seemed to be sucked out, and his body rapidly shrank!

A ball of light instantly condensed on Qin Yu’s hands!

The ball of light flickered with a blazing light like the sun, and a rolling heat wave seemed to spread out in all directions!
