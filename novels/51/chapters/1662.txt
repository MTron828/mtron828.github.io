He Teng lifted his foot and walked towards the Dead River.

Sima bei looked coldly at he teng from the side with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

Very soon, he Teng’s foot stepped into the Dead River. The moment his foot touched it, his face instantly twisted. The extreme pain made his entire body tremble!

“Ah! ! !”

Finally, he teng couldn’t help but raise his head and roar. He hurriedly crawled back to the shore, his face full of lingering fear.

At this time, he Teng’s feet had been completely corroded. He thought that he could withstand the pain, but his face was full of fear.

“What? Didn’t you say that Xiao Hai could do it? Can you do it too?”Sima bei raised his eyebrows and ridiculed.

He Teng didn’t say a word. He only felt a chill on his back.

This kind of pain wasn’t something that a human could endure.

He even felt that staying in this dead river for half a second wasn’t as satisfying as dying immediately.

“Xiao Hai... how did he do it...”he teng muttered in a trembling voice.

No one paid attention to him. Sima bei and Yong Ji turned around and left.

“Master, you must recover completely within a hundred days,”Sima Bei said with a sigh.

...

On the other side, the vice sect master brought Qin Yu to the library.

Near the library, there were many disciples of the Tianyun sect who were studying their spells. When they saw Qin Yu and the vice sect master rushing over, they cupped their hands and greeted them.

After Qin Yu responded to them one by one, he looked at the vice sect master.

“I want to know about the history of the South Province,”said Qin Yu.

The deputy sect master muttered, “Normally, most of the spells here are from the Tianyun sect. As for the history you mentioned, I don’t know.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Do you rarely come here?”

The deputy sect master shook his head and said, “I often come here, but maybe I’m not familiar with this place.”

“Young friend Qin is here to read the holy text, right?”

At this moment, an old man walked out from the Scripture Pavilion.

This old man had a head full of white hair and looked quite old. The wrinkles on his face were like the wrinkles on a bun.

“Master Freewill.”The deputy sect master bowed slightly to this old man.

Qin Yu also hurriedly bowed as a form of greeting.

The deputy sect master introduced from the side, “Master Sui Xin is a living fossil of our southern province. He is also the person in charge of our library. If you have any questions, you should look for master Sui Xin.”

Qin Yu hurriedly walked forward. He opened his mouth and was about to speak when master sui Xin said, “Sect master has already told me. Follow me.”

“Thank You, Master Freewill,”Qin Yu said politely.

After saying this, Qin Yu followed behind Master Freewill and walked into the library.

The entire library was filled with all kinds of spell books. These books were preserved in an extremely complete manner. It didn’t seem like they had experienced a great battle at all.

This couldn’t help but make Qin Yu Look at Master Freewill with great surprise.

After all, the Heavenly Cloud sect had experienced two great battles. That kind of battle would almost destroy the entire sect. It was impossible for these books to be spared.

Unless this master freewill was extremely powerful, so powerful that he could protect the library from the chaos of war!

“It was the sect master who set up the formation.”At This Moment, Master Freewill suddenly opened his mouth.

He walked with rather aged steps and said as he walked, “The sect master values the library very much. Strictly speaking, those who are not from our sect are not qualified to enter this library.”

“Therefore, he has already set up the formation here. The precision of this formation has even surpassed the formation that protects the heavenly cloud sect.”Master Freewill continued to say.

Qin Yu was enlightened. He quickly cupped his hands and said, “Thank you for your explanation, Master.”

As Master Freewill walked in front, he said, “There’s no need to call me master. Just Call Me Freewill. If sect master didn’t think highly of me, I would have died in some unknown corner.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but his heart was full of worries.

Since Master Freewill was known as the living fossil of the South Province, there was probably nothing in the entire South Province that he didn’t know.

Therefore, Qin Yu took the opportunity to ask, “Master Freewill, the sect master said that he wanted me to come to this library to read the history of the South Province. What is recorded in this history? When did it start? Who compiled it?”

Master Freewill glanced at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “This book was written by me.”

Qin Yu was stunned and said in surprise, “You wrote it?”

“That’s right. I once traveled all over the South Province and checked all the relevant information before writing this book. I have already recorded all the development of the South Province within the scope of my ability,”said freewill.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel some admiration for this old man.

Under Qin Yu’s divine sense, he was surprised to find that this master Freewill’s strength wasn’t strong, and he wasn’t even at the mighty realm!

For a person of such a realm to travel through more than half of the southern prefecture, this was indeed an unbelievable matter.

“Alright, this is it.”Master Freewill stopped in his tracks. A stone wall appeared in front of him.

Then, Master Freewill raised his palm and placed it on the wall. In a short moment, the wall slowly opened up.

“No wonder the deputy sect leader has never seen it before,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Behind the wall was a small secret room. The lights in the entire secret room were dim. In front of him was a huge table with a thick book on it.

“Go in,”Master Freewill said.

“If you want to finish reading this book, it will take at least ten days. I Won’t disturb you during these ten days. If you have any needs, come and find me,”Master Freewill said.

Qin Yu glanced at the thick book and quickly called out to master freewill.

“Master Freewill, my time is tight. If it’s convenient for you, can you stay with me?”Qin Yu tried to ask.

Master Freewill was silent for a moment, then said, “Okay.”

“Thank you!”Qin Yu quickly bowed.

With such a living fossil, Qin Yu didn’t need to go through so much trouble.

The door slowly closed, and only Qin Yu and Master Freewill were left in the secret room.

“You read it first,”Master Freewill said.

Then, he walked to the side and sat down cross-legged. He closed his eyes slightly, as if he was meditating.

Qin Yu opened the book and took a simple glance, then closed the book again.

“Master Freewill, I have a question to ask you,”Qin Yu walked forward and said.

Master Freewill opened his eyes and frowned slightly. He said, “You have to be patient when reading. With your current state of mind, it’s not suitable for you to read books.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said with some embarrassment, “Master Freewill is right, but I really have a very important question.”

Master Freewill nodded slightly and signaled Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Have you ever heard of Earth on the other side of the starry sky?”
