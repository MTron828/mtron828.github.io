“Qin Yu, wake up!”

It was an extremely distant voice that had been calling him for countless years.

At this moment, he finally heard it clearly.

He felt that this voice was very familiar, but he could not remember it no matter how hard he tried.

At this moment, his memories had been completely erased. His soul was blank like a baby.

However, the only thing he felt was that this voice was very familiar to him. It had a kind of intimate intuition from the depths of his divine soul.

“Qin Yu, come on! If you’re any later, it’ll be too late!”

The voice began to sound a little anxious. At this moment, his divine soul was once again restrained by a powerful force.

He crossed another barrier. This was a barrier that was even more ancient than God’s Space.

It was filled with countless skeletons, and there was a thousands-of-feet-long Holy Dragon.

Some of the bones floating in the barrier emitted a power that shocked Qin Yu’s soul.

Huge divine demon skeletons could be seen everywhere.

There were even countless broken pieces of weapons, some of which had accumulated serious dirt.

Even towering trees had grown here. No one knew how long they had been floating here.

The boundless barrier was almost filled with these things.

Every single item caused Qin Yu’s soul to tremble.

In the huge space, Qin Yu felt that the sound became extremely intense.

He was a little confused, not knowing what had happened.

Qin Yu saw a space that was emitting a dazzling divine light in the dim light projection by the huge star.

The sudden appearance of the huge gravitational force was from this space, which was why his divine soul was sucked in at an accelerated speed.

A floating throne appeared in front of Qin Yu. On the throne sat a person wearing an emperor’s robe.

He held a huge broadsword in his hand and his eyes were slightly closed. However, his body did not rot like the other corpses. Instead, it was preserved very well.

All the corpses and remains within a hundred thousand meters were kneeling quietly. The energy in their bodies had been restrained to almost zero.

These skeletons seemed to be kowtowing to their king.

He was a little uneasy. The terrifying energy emitted by the person on the throne made him feel afraid.

However, he felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity when he got closer. The golden-haired king in front of him seemed to have a smile on his face. “Who are you? Why do I feel so familiar with you?”

Qin Yu had a splitting headache. That familiar yet unrecognizable feeling was simply driving him crazy.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s expression suddenly froze.

The entire sky above the throne suddenly lit up and it suddenly became daytime.

All the bones and weapon fragments around them trembled violently in an instant, and then slowly disintegrated into countless invisible particles.

In the next moment, a bolt of lightning that pierced through the universe suddenly descended.

Even before the lightning struck, Qin Yu felt his divine soul begin to melt.

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded out from Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“It’s been a long time. I’m finally back here. After being lost for so many years,

I’m finally back here…King, you didn’t betray us…”

At this moment, a surging consciousness suddenly appeared in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

In an instant, it seized control of Qin Yu’s soul. An internal qi lit up in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Then, it formed a Judge’s Brush in Immortal Emperor Yao’s hand.

It was the Judge’s Brush that Qin Yu had obtained in the ghost realm, but he did not notice it after entering the Saint Kingdom.

It turned out that the body of the Judge’s Brush was destroyed after entering the Saint Kingdom. However, the life and death energy was sealed by Immortal Emperor Yao within Qin Yu’s six senses. The life and death energy completely erupted at this moment.

Even if it’s you, get lost!

A huge ‘death’ word suddenly formed in Immortal Emperor Yao’s hand.

As he collided with the lightning, Qin Yu only felt that he was swept into a terrifying turbulence.

Around it was a world made of lightning.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The world of life and death supported by the tip of the brush confronted the lightning for less than a breath.

The power of lightning directly penetrated Qin Yu’s body. “King, are you back too?”

In Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, a choked voice sounded.

The man on the throne had stood up at some point.

He pinched the thunderbolt with two fingers. The power of the thunderbolt that pierced through the universe stopped abruptly and could not move in the man’s hand.

As he threw it away, the lightning suddenly changed its direction and rushed elsewhere.

A ferocious consciousness let out a furious roar as if it were raging.

The void space where Qin Yu was standing began to tremble violently.

At this moment, all the stars began to tremble like small boats. As a beam of light passed by, these stars were directly turned into dust.

“I’ll borrow your strength!”

The man on the throne slowly extended his right hand.

“Yes!”

Qin Yu heard a shout in unison from within the barrier.

In an instant, countless rays of light illuminated the entire place.

At this moment, even the incomplete bones seemed to have recovered their consciousness and transferred all the remaining power to the man’s right hand.

As the last remnants of power flowed away, these corpses slowly dissipated.

It was as if the purpose of their existence here was to wait for this moment.

“Everyone, I’ll be right there.”

At this moment, the man’s hand was emitting a divine light that was brighter than the sun.

The sword on his left hand had turned into a huge bow at some point. This bow stood in front of the man like a great wall.

The man on the throne slowly pulled the bowstring.

As the bowstring was pulled to the limit, his body began to shatter.

Whoosh!

The entire world suddenly darkened as if it had lost all its light.

In this collision, Qin Yu’s consciousness seemed to have been imprisoned by the enormous energy.

He didn’t know how long had passed before he gradually regained consciousness.

Waves of warm current slowly merged into his divine soul, making his entire body numb.

One familiar memory after another returned to his body.

The man on the throne had appeared in front of him. He pressed a hand on Qin Yu’s hair and revealed a warm smile.

However, this scene would be even better if his face was not covered in cracks.

“Go back, child. Forget all of this…”

Although the memories in his divine soul were still in chaos, his sea of consciousness only had a large amount of scattered memory power..
