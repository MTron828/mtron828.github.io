2365 Jun Yixian’s Will

“May I ask who you are?”

“What’s your name?” Asked Qin Yu softly, staring at her face that resembled Xi Menn’s.

“My name is Ximen Weiyu.”

Ximen Weiyu said softly. She seemed to be a little afraid.

“Don’t be afraid. We’re all friends of your brother. Your brother has gone to a faraway place to practice his sword and will be back soon. You can follow me during this time, and no one will bully you.”

Qin Yu patted Ximen Weiyu’s little head and smiled at her.

“Alright… How is Brother doing? Is he okay?”

Ximen Weiyu hesitated for a moment but could not help asking about her brother’s condition.

“Yes… Your brother has become the world’s greatest swordsman. He’s the most amazing person. He’s saved all of us.”

Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Xiaoru and Little Fatty mixed freely with people. They pulled Xi Menn Weiyu along to play games.

And there were dozens of tiny skull-shaped beads on the ground. Qin Yu picked them up and took a look.

It was the divine sense restriction that he had checked in these people’s sea of consciousness. A relatively large bead seemed to have been segregated from Ximen Weiyu’s divine sense.

The scholar seemed to have completed what he had asked for before leaving.

Qin Yu carefully sensed the divine sense restriction and found a trace of the Immortal Emperor’s will on it.

Especially Ximen Weiyu’s restriction, the will was even more vast.

Although it was a refined dead object, Qin Yu still felt an incomparably vast will on it.

Just as his divine sense entered it to probe, he felt like facing a ferocious beast that chose people to devour.

“Is this the divine sense of emperor level?”

Facing this wisp of divine sense, Qin Yu instantly realized that his soul was like tofu.

He could not help but feel a lingering fear.

At this point, the scholar had erased the Ji family ancestor’s consciousness from the divine sense restriction. Qin Yu dripped the blood essence into it and slowly refined it.

After refining this Immortal Emperor restriction, Qin Yu could comprehend a trace of the secrets of the Immortal Emperor and also detonate it using the same method as the aristocratic families.

And between heaven and earth, a thunder-like will suddenly soared into the sky.

That terrifying will almost made everyone breathless for a moment as if a god had descended. Even a little bit of overflowing internal qi was unbearable for many cultivators.

In an instant, countless demonic beast cultivators exploded and died.

In the distant void, the golden gate slowly opened.

The figure behind the golden gate stared at the will that soared into the sky, and a ray of light shot out from his hand.

That will was directly attached to the light.

In an instant, the world turned pitch-black. The sky seemed to have been torn apart dozens of times in a row. The entire heaven and earth kept shattering and then restoring.

The bright light from the clashes allowed Qin Yu to see the bones in his body clearly.

After a long time, heaven and earth finally regained clarity, and everything returned to peace.

The golden gate and the will disappeared as if the clashes just now were just illusions.

“What a terrifying strength! The scholar’s will can actually fight to a draw with the person behind the golden gate?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qin Yu felt a surge of shock and awe in his heart. He knew the scholar was strong but did not know he could be this powerful.

At this moment, numerous people were shocked by this will. Even the chosen one, Teng Zixu, had an extremely shocked expression on his face. He could not believe there was actually such a terrifying person in purgatory.

Qin Yu collected his thoughts and sat cross-legged in the Sumeru ring.

At this moment, in front of him, the lines of rules seemed to have expanded tenfold. The countless lines were even more detailed and clear before his eyes.

After he burned his soul and the power of the soul that was ten times stronger surged into the desolate divine eye, it seemed to have evolved.

Moreover, at this moment, in his Sea of Soul, the divine sense spirit bead in the center of his sea of consciousness was above the two divine sense figurines.

Something like a blood vessel connected the divine sense spirit bead and the two figurines.

After being compressed by the power of divine sense, the power of the soul became exceptionally high-quality power of divine sense, which surged into the two figurines’ bodies in the sea of consciousness. It then slowly spread throughout the entire sea of consciousness.

His power of divine sense was more than dozens of times stronger than previously. The rate the divine sense spirit bead compressed the power of the soul was extremely slow.

Not only did it require a long time, but it also required a vast amount of soul power.

No wonder the entire world seemed to have changed before his eyes. He could even see the patterns on a speck of dust clearly.

In his sea of consciousness, there was a tombstone that had been sealed.

It was the tomb of the beloved wife Nie Xiaoyun and Jun Yixian. Qin Yu’s divine sense entered the tomb, after which he instantly felt a massive suction force pulling him in.

Qin Yu was shocked and quickly retreated with all his might.

He had just gone through the reincarnation of Jun Yixian’s previous life. If he were to go through it again, his divine soul would probably collapse.

“Brother, let’s fight.”

At this moment, Chang Mang had absorbed the spiritual energy in the Sumeru ring and had recovered a little.

His battle-maniac nature was instantly exposed as he said to Qin Yu eagerly.

“Come!”

Qin Yu nodded. He also wanted to see how his current Glazed Holy Body compared to Chang Mang’s holy body.

“Bang!”

Chang Mang’s physical strength erupted, and he punched Qin Yu’s chest.

After that, a surge of brute force erupted from his fist. Qin Yu did not retreat and forcefully endured the brute force.

In an instant, the place where Qin Yu stood could no longer withstand that massive force.

Countless cracks exploded beneath his feet as Chang Mang leaped high into the air.

Like a ferocious beast, he smashed toward Qin Yu’s head.

This attack did not only comprise his physical strength but also his most powerful spiritual energy.

With a single strike, sand and stones flew.

Qin Yu’s body plunged directly into a depth of thousands of feet, and he raised his aching hands as he appeared before Chang Mang.

“Stop! I’m not fighting anymore. What’s the point of fighting? I used all my strength, but you could just block it with your arms.”

Chang Mang shouted and pinched all over Qin Yu’s body as if trying to figure out what this body was made of.

“The Si family always took your blood, and your soul hasn’t recovered yet. We’ll have a good fight when you’re fully recovered.”
