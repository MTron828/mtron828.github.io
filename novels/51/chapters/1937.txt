1938 The Clash of Different Views

Qin Yu’s strength convinced everyone.

His performance wasn’t inferior to Si Shiyue’s!

The reason was none other than Qin Yu had relied on the formation and his special physique to display a performance that far exceeded his strength.

Zi Xu retreated to the side, and the leader also stepped forward.

!!

He looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “You’re Qin Yu?”

“Please don’t ask when you already know the answer,” Qin Yu replied in neither an overbearing nor self-effacing tone.

The cultivator wasn’t angry. He smiled and said, “I know your plan, but I’m telling you it’s useless. You’re not worth mentioning in the eyes of the Si family.

“If it’s not worth mentioning, why did you come from far to chase after me?” Qin Yu said, spreading his hands.

“What makes you think I’m chasing after you?” He asked in return.

“We’re all smart people, so don’t play dumb,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Hahaha! Are you taking a risk out of desperation? Let me tell you. You’ll probably get into trouble by doing this,” the cultivator’s face gradually turned cold.

Qin Yu grinned and said, “I’m just a nobody. The reputation of the Si family should be more important than mine. Or rather… the reputation of the Holy Son of the Si family.”

The cultivator’s face turned even colder. He didn’t say anything else. He just snorted, turned around, and left.

After they left, Qin Yu was slightly relieved.

In fact, he was worried the Si family would not fall for it.

But fortunately, Qin Yu’s bet was correct. These great aristocratic families seemed to be the same. They boasted about being Orthodox and kind and particularly cared about their reputation.

Qin Yu wiped away the sweat from his forehead and mumbled, “It was f*cking dangerous. If I had come a little later, I would probably have died on the way.”

With their strength, Qin Yu could not resist them.

Qin Yu would not have been their match if it were not for the Yan family’s formation.

“I remember who this Qin Yu is now. He seems to be the one who annihilated the Tong family.”

“That’s right. That Qin Yu from Thunder Courtyard seemed to have defeated Si Shifeng not long ago.”

“Si Shifeng seemed to have suppressed his cultivation realm, didn’t he? But even so, he’s powerful enough.”

Qin Yu remained silent, but he was thinking to himself, “It seems like I’m quite famous.”

At the same time, the Yan family was also looking at Qin Yu from above.

Yan Ruoxue, at Mount Donghuang, naturally heard Qin Yu’s shout.

For a moment, she couldn’t help but smile and shake her head at times.

On the other hand, Uncle Yan’s face was livid. As Yan Ruoxue’s personal bodyguard, he was naturally an extremely smart person. Thus he could tell Qin Yu’s purpose with a glance.

“This kid really disappoints me,” Uncle Yan said coldly.

Yan Ruoxue glanced at him and said with a smile, “Disappoints you? Why?”

“Such shameless behavior. It’s simply shameless!” Uncle Yan berated.

However, Yan Ruoxue smiled and shook her head. She looked at Uncle Yan and said, “He doesn’t have a powerful background. How can he establish himself? To him, this might be the best way. It’s better than asking for help. What do you think?”

Uncle Yan was startled and did not speak for a long time.

“Sigh! He’s definitely alerted Holy Lord by doing so.” After a while, Uncle Yan shook his head again.

“It’s fine. Holy Lord won’t do anything to me,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

“Isn’t this kid afraid that our Yan family will attack him?” Uncle Yan said with a frown.

“Attack him? Is there any benefit to it?” Yan Ruoxue asked in return.

Uncle Yan was startled and did not say a word.

Yan Ruoxue continued, “All this while, Si Shiyue has always been very arrogant. Not to mention me, he’s even extremely impolite to Holy Lord. Qin Yu’s appearance might be a good thing for Holy Lord.”

“That’s true.” Uncle Yan touched his chin and realized it.

Certainly, Yan Ruoxue would not care. However, even if she would not care, someone else would.

That was Yan Yunfan, the former number one of the Yan family’s younger generation.

At this moment, he was standing and looking at Qin Yu coldly from above.

Qin Yu, who was below, saw that things were almost done and planned to leave.

Just as he was about to turn around and leave, a figure blocked Qin Yu’s way.

This person was none other than Yan Yunfan.

Yan Yunfan stared at Qin Yu coldly, with his eyes full of contempt and disdain.

“Yan Yunfan, what’s the matter? Are you going to stand up for Si Shiyue?” Qin Yu smiled and said.

“I’ve never stood up for anyone,” Yan Yunfan said coldly.

“Then what do you want?” Qin Yu asked, puzzled. “Why are you blocking my way? Do you want to catch up with me?”

“Catch up? I don’t even know you. What’s there to catch up?” Yan Yunfan sneered and said.

“Then quickly get out of my way,” Qin Yu grinned and said. “Don’t cause a delay to my work.”

After he finished speaking, Qin Yu wanted to leave, but Yan Yunfan once again stopped Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned and said unhappily, “What are you trying to do?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yan Yunfan, squinting his eyes, said softly, “You bunch of b*stards came from God knows where. You’re truly born to be lowly and shameless. Let me tell you, whether it’s you or Yan Ruoxue, it’s best not to defame the Yan family!”

...

Qin Yu’s face also turned cold.

“Yan Yunfan, don’t think too highly of yourself. You’re just sitting on the shoulders of a giant. You’re not stronger than us,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“In addition, your so-called conceit will slowly destroy you and even your dao technique.”

“I don’t need you to remind me,” Yan Yunfan said coldly.

Qin Yu knew he couldn’t convince Yan Yunfan, so he didn’t say anything else.

Different family backgrounds and environments led to two different views. Although they were both in Holy Region, they seemed to be people from two different worlds.

Qin Yu turned around and left. This time, Yan Yunfan did not stop him. He just coldly looked at Qin Yu’s back until he completely disappeared.

The people, who were planning to climb the stone stairways, couldn’t help but gasp.

“What’s going on today? First, someone tried to extort the Yan family, and now, even the former Holy Son of the Yan family has shown up!”

“We were fortunate enough to meet these people. This trip was not in vain.”

“I have to say, what that young man named Qin Yu said was quite reasonable.”

...

“Sigh! Don’t talk anymore. Let’s hurry up and climb. Although the Yan family is harsh, at least they gave us some hope.”

“This Qin Yu is probably going to be famous soon. I’m afraid there will be a lot of trouble in the future. I think he has to find a place to hide.”

However, things went beyond everyone’s predictions. Not only did Qin Yu not hide, but he also appeared openly in the most prosperous city of the Holy Region, Sky City.

Sky City was an extremely special place. Rumor had it that this place was once the real Imperial Palace, and also the place where the real ruler of the Holy Region lived.
