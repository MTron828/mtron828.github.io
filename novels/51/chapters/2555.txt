Chapter 2556 Unforeseen Change

“The barrier of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect! What’s going on?”

Qin Yu frowned. Chen Shuang had asked him to leave, but the barrier was activated now.

Judging from the internal qi emitted by this barrier, it was the most urgent formation barrier in the sect. Once opened, there was no way to get out except to break through it.

Concurrently, a mountain peak suddenly exploded.

Dazzling lights were flickering on it. Countless runes gleamed in the sky, forming a river of cultivation methods.

Just as Qin Yu was feeling astonished, another massive light appeared on another mountain peak.

As the runes suddenly exploded, countless treasure lights shot into the sky.

They were treasures with extraordinary internal qi. These treasures gleamed with brilliant treasure lights and created a world akin to a realm of jewels under the sun.

At this moment, outside the entire barrier, a layer of dark clouds slowly arrived at the territory of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

Wherever this layer of dark clouds went, it was darkness below.

Even the hottest sunlight in the noon time failed to shine through.

On the Solitary Shadow Continent, at this point, Xiang Yu and the Four Great Godly Kings seemed to have received an order.

Xiang Yu and the eight-winged monster race army slowly disappeared into the void.

He Teng also sneered coldly and disappeared from the spot.

…

At this moment, a dignified voice suddenly sounded from a mountain peak in the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

“From today onwards, the Scripture Pavilion’s cultivation methods are no longer hidden. One can comprehend the methods and cultivate them at will.

“As for all the magical artifacts of the Weapon Refining Peak, the capable can have them, regardless of life or death!”

As these were said, the entire Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect fell into a commotion.

Xuan Xin placed the Green Duckweed Sword on his thigh and slowly stood up.

“Well, it’s also good. This time, we’ll settle both new and old scores together.”

“Immortal Emperor Yao, quickly analyze it for me. Take this as one question.”

Qin Yu was shocked, too, and quickly called out to Immortal Emperor Yao.

All of this happened too quickly. At this moment, Qin Yu felt he had no confidence at all. After all, it involved the battle of the Saints. If he were not careful, he would probably be reduced to ashes.

Qin Yu still deeply remembered the scene in the Misty Forest. In front of Zi Yang, the seven of them had no strength to struggle at all.

“I can feel the internal qi of all the Saints fluctuating. It’s unlikely that we can win the support of the Saints here. There are also many fifth-level Godly Kings and monster beasts that accompany Zi Yang. However, this is all secondary. Zi Yang’s aura is much stronger than Chen Shuang’s. It will be very difficult for Chen Shuang to entangle Zi Yang completely. In other words, if the other Saints can’t support this battle, the outcome will probably be very miserable.”

Immortal Emperor Yao pondered for a long time as if sensing the intense internal qi of the fifth level and above.

“If a Saint were to attack us, I’m afraid we couldn’t withstand even a casual strike. Why don’t we take this opportunity to leave this place?”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

Once Chen Shuang was at a disadvantage, it would be a disaster for them.

When a Saint made a move against any fifth level, it was a downgrade strike.

“How could it be that easy? Once a Saint locks onto this place, the ends of the world will be within his divine sense. After his divine thought locks onto this place, this path will completely run its course. To Zi Yang, the more thoroughly destroyed the place here, the deeper the severance of his constraints. If we were to leave now, we might die even faster. However, Chen Shuang, that little fellow, has condensed the Seal of Heaven Returning for you with the power of the Saint. Perhaps it can withstand Zi Yang’s attack. You don’t have to worry too much. Now you have eight questions left, not nine.”

After Immortal Emperor Yao finished speaking, he returned to the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile. He was now involved in this war for no reason.

Qin Yu suddenly recalled what Immortal Emperor Yao had told her before he left.

Regarding his desolate divine eye, if he pushed himself to the limits, there might be unexpected results.

However, he could not use it during his trip to the Misty Forest.

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment. He could take this opportunity to give it a try.

With the help of the Seal of Heaven Returning, his body had recovered significantly. Coupled with the healing effect of the Heart of the Ocean, his body should not collapse if it withstood the power of the Primordial Chaos.
