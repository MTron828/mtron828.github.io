Old Mister Yan had expected Qin Yu’s question.

Therefore, he seemed to have prepared for this long ago as he said slowly, “I don’t know much about your father, but I know that he is an invincible person,” said Old Mister Yan.

“An invincible person?” Qin Yu looked at Old Mister Yan.

“Is he more powerful than the Yan family?”

Old Mister Yan smiled bitterly and said, “The Yan family is nothing in front of him.”

“To him, wealth is nothing. Let alone the small Yan family, with his strength, he can influence an entire country.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

Just one person alone could influence an entire country? What kind of realm did one have to possess to do so?

“Since you’re his son, I believe that your abilities aren’t inferior to his,” Old Mister Yan said.

“When that time comes, not to mention the tiny Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but even the authorities will have to show you respect.”

Such a realm was too far away for Qin Yu. Even a Martial Saint wouldn’t be able to achieve it.

“Then where did my father go? Why have I never seen him before?” Qin Yu asked hurriedly.

Old Mister Yan shook his head. His eyes were filled with yearning as he said, “Mr. Qin is a person who can’t be seen. He isn’t someone that we can speculate about.”

This was the first time Qin Yu had seen Old Mister Yan reveal such a respectful expression!

This was enough to show just what kind of existence Qin Yu’s father was.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. He looked at Old Mister Yan and said, “This means that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association must have discovered something.”

“That’s right.” Old Mister Yan nodded.

“Qin Yu, before you step into the Martial Marquis realm, try not to have any confrontations with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Old Mister Yan, I understand.”

That night, Qin Yu made his plans.

The next day, he left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and went out to explore.

At this time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association held another meeting.

This time, the meeting was no longer centered around Qin Yu, but Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue!

There were only four people in the huge meeting room, including Xia Hang.

However, there were more than four people participating in the meeting!

They were hiding in the shadows, and only their voices were heard.

“After our investigation, everything is as we thought.” A cold voice came from the darkness.

“Today, we investigated Qin Yu. It is very likely that he is related to that person. Moreover, his physique is a chaotic body.” Another voice came out.

“The daughter of the Yan family, Yan Ruoxue, has a different bloodline. This bloodline is beyond our understanding.”

“According to the ancient records, this bloodline and Qin Yu’s chaotic body are natural. Once the two of them have intercourse, they will be invincible.”

Xia Hang was stunned.

At this moment, he realized that although he was the vice president, he knew nothing compared to these higher-ups.

“We plan to borrow Yan Ruoxue’s blood. If we succeed, Yan Ruoxue will become the biggest treasure of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!” A voice came from the dark again.

Xia Hang hurriedly stood up and said anxiously, “But... Yan Ruoxue is the eldest daughter of the Yan family. Will the Yan family agree to us detaining her without reason?”

Everyone was silent for a moment and then said, “Go and tell Yan Sihai that we will ensure Yan Ruoxue’s safety and give some benefits to the Yan family.”

“If Yan Yunheng wasn’t dead, it might have been a little more troublesome. As for Yan Sihai... it doesn’t matter. We can just give him some benefits to satisfy him.”

Xia Hang didn’t say anything more.

“Then... what about Qin Yu?” Xia Hang suddenly thought of something.

In the dark, some spat out, “Kill him.”

Hearing that, Xia Hang finally heaved a sigh of relief.

No one had expected that the battle between Qin Yu and Han Wei would actually cause so much trouble.

Not only that, but the situation in Jingdu seemed to be quietly changing as well.

Many of the hidden powerhouses in Pyro were also slowly emerging.

... . .

The next day, Qin Yu bid farewell to the Pavilion Master and left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

He set off towards the northwest. He walked on foot along the way to temper his mental state.

Not long after Qin Yu left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Gu Canghai received the news.

After he put down his phone, his expression immediately turned cold.

“From today onwards, the Saint Confucian Sect will temporarily be handed over to Deng Sheng to manage,” Gu Canghai said coldly.

“Sect master, where are you going?” The old man called Deng Sheng hurriedly asked.

A trace of killing intent flashed across Gu Canghai’s face as he said coldly, “To kill people!”

...

Jade City was located in the depths of the northwest.

This city was just like its name. It was full of greenery.

Unlike the desolated surrounding cities, everything here was lush and verdant, like a forest.

Because it was located in the depths of the northwest, most of the residents here had left Jade City and chose to go to a big city.

This also caused Jade City to be extremely sparsely populated, but there were many sects.

“The surrounding cities are all deserts, but Jade City is actually all green.” Qin Yu stroked his chin and thought to himself.

He released his divine sense and tried to sense the internal qi of Jade City.

“Huh?” Soon, Qin Yu felt that something was wrong.

In the northwest corner, there was a faint surge of spiritual energy.

This spiritual energy was faintly discernible. It wasn’t very strong, and it was still very far away. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and immediately walked toward the northwest corner.

At the northwest corner, Qin Yu saw a huge rock that was like a city gate.

Near the city gate, there were a few black cars parked nearby.

Qin Yu looked up at the huge rock and saw a few big words written on it: Beaufort Tower.

“What kind of lousy name is that?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but ridicule.

He tried to feel the spiritual energy and sure enough, the wisps of spiritual energy came from Beaufort Tower.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and then walked in with big strides.

In Beaufort Tower, there was a large area of land that was surrounded, and it was on par with the manor of an ordinary wealthy family.

Qin Yu followed the wisps of spiritual energy and walked in a certain direction.

Not long after, Qin Yu saw a huge lake in front of him.

Qin Yu bent down and scooped up a handful of water.

The water had a strange taste.

“There is spiritual energy in the lake, but the taste is a bit strange. It’s different from the Water Dragon Cave,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

This feeling... It was as if the spiritual energy had been diluted countless times.

Qin Yu picked up a huge rock and threw it into the lake.

He tried to drink another mouthful of the lake water, but he found that the taste was different this time.

Compared to the first cup of water, the spiritual energy in the lake water seemed to be a bit denser this time.

“How strange.” Qin Yu was a bit puzzled for a moment.

He scanned his surroundings and found that there was a small entrance at the border of the lake.

The water in the lake seemed to flow in from this small entrance.
