Chapter 1334: Chapter 1334, First Elder’s appearance 

Everyone knew what would happen if Ling Yun died.

That would undoubtedly mean the wrath of the Tianyun sect! Who could withstand the wrath of the first elder!

Qin Yu looked at Ling Yun coldly, while the attendant was already anxious.

His spell landed on Qin Yu’s back, leaving spots of blood on it. However, that wasn’t enough to damage his foundation!

The follower gritted his teeth and raised his hands, as if he was preparing a top-tier spell.

“Hundred Flower Ghost Slash!”

The follower roared, and a large patch of blood-red flowers appeared in the sky.

The flowers blotted out the sky and covered the sun, making the entire space look blood-red. It was extremely beautiful!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He raised his head and looked at the sky, feeling a little curious.

“Hundred flower ghost slash... it sounds like a very powerful spell. I don’t know if I can withstand it,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He didn’t dare to be negligent and directly activated the fighting word formula.

With the support of the fighting word formula, Qin Yu’s physical body became even more tyrannical, and his strength also increased.

“Hundred flower ghost slash... I think I’ve heard of this name before,”wan ‘er said softly from the side.

There seemed to be some worry on her face, but she couldn’t remember this technique at the moment.

“Hundred flower ghost slash... What exactly is it? Why Can’t I remember it...”Wan ‘ER’s expression became more and more anxious.

“Miss Wan ‘er, What’s Wrong?”Ah San asked from the side.

Wan ‘Er didn’t answer. At this moment, her pupils constricted as if she had remembered something.

“Hundred Flower Ghost Slash... Oh no, it’s that spiritual spell!”Wan ‘ER’s expression changed. She hurriedly shouted at Qin Yu, “Young Master Qin, you must never raise your head and look directly at that Flower!”

Unfortunately, it was already too late. The sky was filled with blood-red flowers, and at this moment, they actually turned into one ghost head after another.

Qin Yu looked up at this scene. His expression suddenly froze, and his body fell straight down.

“Hundred Flower Ghost Slash. It’s said that this spell is somewhat similar to an illusion spell. It’s a spiritual attack.”

“That’s right. Once the spirit is tortured to death, at worst, the primordial spirit will be damaged, and at worst, it will never be able to wake up.”

“Yes, one second of ours is equivalent to more than ten minutes in his spiritual world.”

“The hundred flower ghost slash seems to be one of the top techniques in the Tianyun sect. It is extremely difficult to comprehend. Even Ling Yun, who is known as a genius, has not comprehended this technique. How did this follower learn it?”

“Hehe, you might not know this, but this follower was someone who had fought alongside the sect leader of the Tianyun sect back then.”

Just as they were discussing, Qin Yu’s world had already turned into a sky full of saber lights and Sword Shadows!

This was not a real attack, but it was a great torture to the mind.

That ghost head looked extremely horrifying and extremely ugly. It was said that many people would never forget it after seeing it for their entire lives.

And this was also one of the essence of the Hundred Flower Ghost Slash. It relied on the terrifying scene to break the psychological defense of the practitioner.

In addition to the accompanying flashes of swords and sabers, it was enough to make people stay here.

However, the only pity was that this technique wasn’t that effective on Qin Yu.

The terrifying ghostly heads were far inferior to the strange green creatures in the mountain mist. They were simply insignificant.

In Qin Yu’s heart, he firmly believed that his body was unparalleled and that these sabers wouldn’t be able to harm his body at all.

Everyone looked at Qin Yu who was lying on the ground and sighed.

No one expected that the one who would fight with Qin Yu in the end would not be Ling Yun, but his follower!

That follower knew that he might not be a match for Qin Yu, so he quickly arrived in front of Ling Yun and planned to use this opportunity to escape with Ling Yun.

He picked up Ling Yun and gritted his teeth as he said, “Young Master Ling, let’s Retreat.”

However, at this moment, the attendant suddenly felt a piercing sensation on his back as a cold sensation assaulted him.

The attendant’s expression changed as he hurriedly turned around. What responded to him was Qin Yu’s steel-like fist.

Boom

Even Ling Yun couldn’t withstand his right fist, and this attendant was even more vulnerable.

With a single punch, his head exploded, along with his primordial spirit!

When everyone saw this, they were all shocked!

How did this Qin Yu suddenly wake up? Could it be that he was pretending just now?

Qin Yu kicked his corpse to the side and sneered, “This spell of yours is still a little lacking.”

Just as Qin Yu said, the Hundred Flowers Ghost Slash controlled by the attendant was not complete, so it was easily broken by Qin Yu.

Even if it was a complete hundred flowers ghost slash, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid.

He didn’t grow up in an aristocratic family. Instead, he had experienced countless hardships before coming to the holy region.

Qin Yu had long developed a will as strong as steel through his life experiences.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Ling Yun.

“Alright, it’s your turn.”Qin Yu walked in front of Ling Yun. His right fist was sparkling.

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste any time in case Ling Yun’s primordial spirit took the opportunity to escape.

However, just as Qin Yu was about to make a move, a light flashed between Ling Yun’s brows. A figure floated out.

It was an extremely old figure. He was tall and had a dignified look on his face.

This person was none other than Ling Yun’s master, the Grand Elder of the Heavenly Cloud sect!
