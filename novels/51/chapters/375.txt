Yao Qing said as he ran. When he ran to the door, he realized that Qin Yu was already awake.

He hurriedly covered his mouth and subconsciously hid the phone behind his back.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu had already heard these words.

He looked at Yao Qing coldly and said, “Who is engaged to whom?”

“No... no one.” Yao Qing hurriedly waved his hand.

“Bring the phone over,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yao Qing coughed and changed the topic, “Um... Mr. Qin, you’re awake. I’ll go make you something to eat.”

“Bring the phone over!” Qin Yu shouted!

Yao Qing knew that he couldn’t hide the matter anymore, so he could only hand the phone to Qin Yu.

After Qin Yu took the phone, he hurriedly looked at the screen.

There was a piece of news on the screen:

The marriage of the century! The engagement ceremony between the Han family’s Han Wei and the Yan family’s Yan Ruoxue!

Qin Yu hurriedly clicked on the news, and saw that it was the news of Yan Ruoxue and Han Wei’s engagement! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

On September 9th, Han Wei and Yan Ruoxue were going to hold their wedding in Jingdu!

Updates by

The reason why they chose September 9th was for a certain purpose.

It was said that this date was chosen by the most powerful Mystic Arts Master of the generation!

In addition, there was also a photo taken on the engagement day in the news.

In the photo, Yan Ruoxue’s expression was ice-cold. There was no smile, which seemed out of place with the atmosphere at the scene.

Qin Yu looked at the news and clenched his fists tightly!

He got up from the bed and turned around to leave.

“Qin Yu, where are you going?” Taozi asked anxiously.

Qin Yu said coldly, “To the Yan family. I’m going to take Ruoxue away.”

“Mr. Qin, aren’t you going to die then?” Yao Qing also said anxiously.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “So what if I’m going to die? Do I have to watch Ruoxue marry someone else with my own eyes?”

“You can’t go!” Yao Qing hugged Qin Yu’s waist tightly.

“Get lost,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yao Qing desperately clung onto Qin Yu.

“I told you to get lost!” Qin Yu’s body suddenly erupted with an intense internal qi!

Under this internal qi, Yao Qing was directly sent flying!

At this time, Taozi also stood in front of Qin Yu.

She took a deep breath and said, “Qin Yu, I know you’re very angry and sad now, but now, if you go to Jingdu, it’s meaningless and you’ll even risk your life.”

However, how could Qin Yu listen to all this? He looked coldly at Taozi and said, “I don’t want to hit women, but if you insist on stopping me, I won’t show mercy.”

“Then kill me!” Taozi closed her eyes with a determined expression.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and roared, “You forced me!”

“Do you want to die so much? Won’t you have no chance if you die?”

At this moment, the Pavilion Master suddenly walked in from outside the door.

She gently raised her hand, and a gentle yet overbearing force imprisoned Qin Yu on the spot.

“Pavilion Master...” Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

He said with an almost pleading attitude, “Pavilion Master, please help me. As long as I can bring Ruoxue back, I’m willing to be a slave...”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with tears.

“I can’t just watch Ruoxue marry someone else...” Qin Yu’s tears were like a river bank that burst, and it gushed out.

However, the Pavilion Master said coldly, “You’re useless. Look at your current appearance! You’re a good-for-nothing!”

“She’s your woman, yet you want to ask others for help. Aren’t you a good-for-nothing?”

“Didn’t you say that you wanted Yan Ruoxue to stand at the top of Jingdu? With your current appearance, I think you should just die. No one will stop you!”

After saying this, the Pavilion Master immediately released Qin Yu from his imprisonment.

Qin Yu, his eyes full of tears, stood there.

“Go. Didn’t you want to die? Why are you still standing here?!” The Pavilion Master said coldly.

Qin Yu cried bitterly. He squatted on the ground and sobbed softly, “I... I can’t stand it...”

“Can’t stand it? If you can’t stand it, use your own strength to snatch her back,” the Pavilion Master said coldly.

“It’s September 9th. Isn’t there still more than half a year’s time left?”

After the Pavilion Master’s Reminder, Qin Yu immediately reacted!

He suddenly raised his head and muttered in a low voice, “Yes, there’s still half a year! There’s still half a year!”

The Pavilion Master said coldly, “If you’re a man, then go snatch the marriage and woman yourself.”

“If you’re not, then get out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

With that, the Pavilion Master turned her head and walked out.

After the Pavilion Master’s berating, Qin Yu calmed down a lot.

“Snatch the marriage... what a good idea.” Qin Yu muttered softly.

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu couldn’t calm down for a long time.

Because he knew very well that Yan Ruoxue must have been forced!

No one knew what kind of situation Yan Ruoxue was in now!

At this moment, Old Mister Yan suddenly walked in from outside the door.

“Old Mister Yan.” Upon seeing Old Mister Yan, Taozi and Yao Qing hurriedly greeted him.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and motioned for them to leave.

Taozi and Yao Qing didn’t say anything and immediately turned around to walk out of the Elders’ Residence.

The door was slowly closed.

Qin Yu rubbed his eyes and said in a low voice, “Old Mister Yan, I’ve made a fool of myself.”

Old Mister Yan patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and motioned for him to sit down.

The two of them sat opposite each other. Old Mister Yan poured a glass of water for Qin Yu.

“Do you regret it?” Old Mister Yan asked.

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, “I don’t regret it.”

Old Mister Yan smiled and said, “Qin Yu, when Ruoxue went to Jiangcheng back then, she was unwilling because no one would think highly of a useless son-in-law born and raised in Jiangcheng. I forced her to go.”

“At that time, I was the only person in the entire Yan family who had high hopes for you.”

Qin Yu lowered his head and didn’t say a word.

Old Mister Yan continued, “But later, the person who trusted you the most in the entire Yan family was Ruoxue.”

“She had high expectations for you. She believed that you wouldn’t be an ordinary person, but a man who could change everything.”

“Can you understand this kind of groundless and inexplicable high expectation?”

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Old Mister Yan.

There was an indescribable feeling in his heart.

He didn’t know whether it was gratitude for Yan Ruoxue’s trust in him or guilt towards her.

“Do you know why their wedding will be six months later?” At this moment, Old Mister Yan changed the topic.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know.”

Old Mister Yan sighed slowly and said, “Because the person who chose the days for them is an old acquaintance of mine. I have already expected today’s situation.”

“Although six months isn’t a long time, it is the last chance for you.”

Qin Yu suddenly raised his head and looked at Old Mister Yan.

“I believe in you. Ruoxue also believes in you. What about yourself?” Old Mister Yan asked.

Qin Yu’s heart was instantly ignited with vigor.

This power once again filled him with confidence and determination.

“Old Mister Yan, I won’t disappoint you.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“And I won’t let Ruoxue marry Han Wei.”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with determination.
