Chapter 2616: Crushing Ju Wuwei

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“It’s best not to go down. This person is truly powerful,” Li Yue reminded once again.

“No matter how strong he is, he’s still an outsider like me. We both entered this Saint Kingdom at the same time. If I don’t dare to draw my saber, there’s no need for me to use it in the future.”

Ju Wuwei snorted coldly, sitting in the basket and descending directly. This was a confrontation between outsiders.

The commando team on the city wall did not intervene in such challenges.

Holding the Tiger Wing, Ju Wuwei advanced step by step toward Ming Xie.

The present Ju Wuwei had completely transformed his military achievements into his strength. At this moment, he was at the peak of his condition. Even facing someone who could sit atop a black dragon, he showed no fear.

The clattering of footsteps echoed through the corridor.

Ju Wuwei sprinted wildly, right hand gripping the saber hilt.

When he was ten meters away from Ming Xie, he leaped into the air.

His body, like a ferocious tiger, charged towards Ming Xie, and a saber light flashed.

The Tiger Wing slashed past Ming Xie’s throat, about half a meter away.

Saber energy!

Ju Wuwei’s Saber energy surged once again. Previously covering a range of only about a punch’s distance, it had now nearly doubled.

This Saber energy could cut through the scales on a black dragon’s body.

Qin Yu, using the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, focused on how Ming Xie would handle this attack.

In the blink of an eye, a loud sound echoed, and the outcome was decided.

Ju Wuwei’s body slammed out, and his right side was crushed into pieces by a punch.

Qin Yu leaped down from the city wall, drew the Sun Chasing Bow from his back, and instantly pulled it to 80% of its maximum strength.

“Take my arrow!”

The golden energy arrow exploded in front of Ming Xie.

A violent flame erupted, and Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with disbelief.

His Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze saw the energy arrow accurately punched by Ming Xie, followed by a massive energy explosion.

“He’s injured. The Dower seems to be greater than I imagined.” Qin Yu

exclaimed.

A piece of Ming Xie’s fist bone was cut off by the arrow, and droplets of blood fell to the ground.

“Don’t worry, since I said I’ll spare his life, I won’t attack again,” Ming Xie sneered and whistled loudly.

The black dragon, hovering in the air, landed directly in front of Ming Xie, bending down.

“Are you alright?”

Seeing Ming Xie leave, Qin Yu, without fear, lifted Ju Wuwei.

“What a terrifying physique and strength. It seems he held back. My saber’s edge couldn’t break through his defense at all. He’s very confident, not even bothering to dodge,” Ju Wuwei said with a bitter smile.

He was defeated in a single round even in his strongest state, and this dealt something of a blow to him.

It should be noted that Ju Wuwei could contend with multiple rounds against even a black dragon, making it difficult to fathom being swiftly eliminated.

Not only Ju Wuwei, but Qin Yu’s most potent arrow faced a similar fate.

What’s more, it moved at an incredible speed. Even the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could only approximate its trajectory.

However, this individual precisely punched the arrow, a detail that sent shivers down Qin Yu’s spine.

“It’s challenging to fathom that such power of the soul must be backed by an immensely powerful soul force to achieve this. After entering this Saint Kingdom, I believed I had pushed my limits, yet there remains such a significant gap between us.”

Despite possessing aids like the Seal of Heaven Returning and the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, Qin Yu’s capabilities were still limited.

He found it challenging to comprehend how the person amidst the necromancy army possessed such a god-defying strength.

Li Yue was indeed not lying. Confronting this person would likely lead to an inevitable defeat.

“I don’t know whose representative this person is. Perhaps he possesses a robust Order of Rules or has even obtained the Heart of Saint Kingdom. Otherwise, it’s implausible for him to wield such god-defying power.”

Qin Yu contemplated for a considerable duration. This level of Saint Power of the Soul was beyond what mere talent could explain.

His body undoubtedly bore the influence of a powerful Order of Rules bestowed by a Saint. Otherwise, there was no reasonable explanation for such a god – defying phenomenon.

Immortal Emperor Yao had previously stated that the more formidable the way, the greater the energy required.

Especially when a Saint broke through the Saint Kingdom, attempting to pry into the contained laws would demand an enormous consumption of holy energy.

Qin Yu speculated that Ming Xie must have been carrying an extremely heavy mission, which was why a Saint bestowed upon him such formidable power. Just like Yin Lin, but unfortunately, he was unlucky enough to die at Qin Yu’s hands.

The two returned to the city wall, and the remaining outsiders all wore solemn expressions.

They had witnessed the previous battle, recognizing that Ming Xie’s strength far exceeded theirs, and they were uncertain about his other capabilities.

“Once the war begins, we will inevitably face him. Even if the necromancy army doesn’t wear us down, with Seifer, Ming Xie, and two other legions we haven’t encountered, can we truly survive?”

Li Yue looked at his pitch-black chessboard and spoke to Qin Yu with a wry smile.

“After I finish selecting items from the storage room, I’ll head straight to the bunker,” Qin Yu decisively stated.

Qin Yu immediately made up his mind. If he had not met Ming Xie, he might have considered it.

However, the appearance of this person made him completely determined.

In the grand scheme, whether it was the human race or the necromancy army, they were merely living beings derived from this Saint Kingdom.

They couldn’t control the Heart of Saint Kingdom or become the Lord of this Saint Kingdom.

However, outsiders were different. Each outsider had the potential to become the ruler of this Saint Kingdom.

With such a person in play, the survival of the human race was virtually impossible.

Qin Yu went directly to the storage room, where a soldier coldly informed him, “You can choose four mysterious items or opt for pills, weapons, armor, and other defensive items. Please choose quickly.” Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment. There was no holy energy left in his divine soul.

Previously, when he was escaping from the pursuit, he had strengthened his legs.

If he encountered danger, he would probably lack the means to respond.

He exchanged for a bottle of Spirit Strengthening Pills, which contained holy energy, similar to the holy energy obtained from killing demonic beasts.

One Spirit Strengthening Pill was equivalent to the holy energy of an orge. He exchanged the rest for a bottle of Energy Recovery Pills and Spirit Recovery Pills to deal with the upcoming battle.

Qin Yu swallowed the Spirit Strengthening Pill.

“For the rest, exchange for three mysterious items!”

Having slain a black dragon, Qin Yu gained valuable information. Now, as the rewards unfolded, black orbs of light appeared one after another in the air.

These mysterious items obstructed all vision, rendering even the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze ineffective in probing their hidden powers. Qin Yu grabbed one of these orbs, revealing an armor covered in moss.

“No way!”

Qin Yu clawed at it, and the armor shattered like junk. It was evident he had chosen a piece of low-grade equipment.

“Again!”

Qin Yu seized another orb, only to find a handkerchief without any discernible energy in his hands..
