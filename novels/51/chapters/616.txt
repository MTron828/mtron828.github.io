The two of them hurriedly ran into the main hall.

Along the way, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache were extremely excited.

The man with the mustache kept muttering, “The skull of a Mighty Realm powerhouse will definitely be able to forge a top-tier weapon!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel somewhat vexed. Why hadn’t he thought of this before?

Soon, the two of them arrived at the main hall.

A part of the skull had already been shattered, but as long as they searched carefully, they could still find a few pieces.

The two of them began to search. Soon, Qin Yu found a skull on the ground.

He hurriedly shouted, “I found it!”

The man with the mustache ran to Qin Yu’s side in a flash and said excitedly, “This skull belongs to me!”

After saying that, he reached out to take the skull.

However, when the man with the mustache’s hand touched the skull, the bone immediately melted and turned into powder.

When the wind blew, nothing was left.

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu frowned immediately.

The man with the mustache’s face also showed a hint of solemnity.

He didn’t give up and continued to search for skulls.

However, the skull he found next had the same result. As long as he touched it, it would shatter.

“How can this be?!” Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

The man with the mustache was silent for a long while. He didn’t say a word.

“Could it be... related to that corpse?” Qin Yu thought of the sect master’s corpse.

Ever since Qin Yu touched his corpse, these bones had begun to shatter.

Even if they hadn’t shattered, they couldn’t be used anymore.

The man with the mustache sighed and muttered, “I was excited over nothing. I knew that the bones of a Mighty Realm powerhouse aren’t that simple...”

Qin Yu frowned. “Then what should we do?”

“What else can we do? Just continue to follow me. My goal isn’t some cranium anyway,” the man with the mustache said mysteriously.

Qin Yu pulled the man with the mustache and said in a deep voice, “Then what’s your goal?”

The man with the mustache looked as if he didn’t want to tell Qin Yu. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But after a moment, he still waved his hand and said, “Forget it. I’ll tell you.”

“The Immortal Slaying Sect is known as the number one sect in the world. They have countless treasures.”

“But, I’m not here for the Immortal Slaying Sect. I’m here for a woman.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “A woman?”

The man with the mustache nodded and said, “The woman who destroyed the Immortal Slaying Sect!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu thought of the masked woman!

He hurriedly looked at the man with the mustache and said, “Do you know that woman very well?”

“Not really,” said the man with the mustache.

“But according to the information I have read over the years, this woman is absolutely unimpeded in this world! The Immortal Slaying Sect isn’t worth mentioning in front of her.”

At this point, the man with the mustache paused for a moment and said mysteriously, “I have a feeling that that woman might have left some treasure here.”

“If it’s her treasure, the foundation of the Immortal Slaying Sect isn’t worth mentioning at all!”

“If I can get that woman’s mask... Hehe, then I’ll be rich.”

Mask?

The mask that the man with the mustache was talking about was probably the mask in Xiao Yu’s hands.

“Let’s go, don’t waste time,” the man with the mustache said.

“If we can find that mask, I’ll give you all the treasures of the Immortal Slaying Sect!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he knew very well that the man with the mustache wouldn’t be able to get that mask today.

“It seems that I have to think of a way to inform Xiao Yu. She must not let others know about the existence of that mask,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The two of them continued to move forward. The man with the mustache held the Divine Plate in his hand and searched for the secret treasure.

After an unknown amount of time, the Divine Plate in his hand flickered with light again.

This time, the light was even stronger than before, almost turning white-hot.

This made the man with the mustache extremely excited! He held Qin Yu’s hand and said excitedly, “See? The light of this Divine Plate is so dazzling. This means that there must be an unimaginable treasure here!”

Qin Yu said with some lingering fear, “Don’t make another headless corpse.”

The man with the mustache ignored Qin Yu. He sat cross-legged on the ground and repeated the same trick.

Streaks of white ash exploded in front of the man with the mustache with a dazzling light.

Then, the world actually began to rumble!

A few minutes later, a crack suddenly appeared on the ground!

“There really is a crack!” The man with the mustache was so excited that he almost jumped up!

Qin Yu’s eyes were also filled with anticipation.

This was the Immortal Slaying Sect, the number one sect in the world ten thousand years ago. God knows how much heritage they had!

The crack grew bigger and bigger until it finally became a huge gap.

Looking down from the gap, they saw that it seemed to be a tomb!

This tomb was extremely beautiful. It covered a huge area and one couldn’t see the end of it.

The man with the mustache took out a lamp from his pocket and pulled Qin Yu with a serious expression. “If it is that woman’s tomb, it will definitely be filled with danger.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry. I will definitely follow you closely.”

The man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “No, I mean you have to protect me well.”

Qin Yu was speechless.

The two of them carefully walked into the tomb.

The passage of this tomb was extremely long, at least a few hundred meters.

The deeper they went, the stronger the dark energy became.

And this dark energy seemed to give Qin Yu a sense of familiarity.

This... was extremely similar to the dark energy in the huge pit in Chuzhou! The density was about the same!

The man with the mustache shivered and said with trembling lips, “I have a feeling... something isn’t right.”

At this moment, the man with the mustache actually had the intention to retreat and stood there hesitantly.

Qin Yu grabbed the lamp and said in a deep voice, “Follow me closely.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took the lead and walked into the tomb.

As expected, the deeper they went, the stronger the dark energy became.

A large area of the tomb in front of them was frozen!

On the wall of the tomb, there were icicles hanging one after another.

Qin Yu broke off an icicle, put it in his mouth and tasted it. Then he exclaimed, “This is... an icicle formed by dark energy!”

In other words, the dark energy here was too dense, so dense that it turned into water droplets.

And because this place was too cold, the water droplets formed by the dark energy directly froze into icicles!

“Such dense dark energy... is really terrifying,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“I’ve walked around various tombs for so many years, but I’ve never seen such dense dark energy...” the man with the mustache said with trembling lips.

Qin Yu felt the same thing. The density of the dark energy here was beyond imagination!

“Why... Why don’t we just forget about it? I’m afraid this is really that woman’s tomb,” the man with the mustache said while trembling.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Why are you so afraid?”

The man with the mustache swallowed his saliva and said, “Qin Yu, you don’t know how terrifying that woman is. According to my understanding, this woman is a murderer. The backup plan she left behind isn’t something we can resist...”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t you have the pestle and the POW? What’s there to be afraid of?”

Upon hearing this, the man with the mustache hurriedly put the POW on his head.

“Crack!”

However, at this moment, the POW on the man with the mustache’s head actually shattered!
