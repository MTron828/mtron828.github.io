“Be careful, he has two Hearts of Saint Kingdom!”

MO Wendao’s expression froze and he hurriedly reminded them loudly.

The others were also greatly alarmed inwardly. One had to know that it was merely a month since Dao Xuan fell. However, there was now someone who could obtain two Hearts of Saint Kingdom in such a short time.

There was no way to stop now anyway. The other four elders suddenly attacked. Four huge divine might powers erupted and joined forces with Gu Yi to defend.

A huge tremor suddenly erupted, and an angry roar came from the energy light shadow.

A furious will like that of an ancient demonic beast suddenly attacked. In an instant, the five people, including Gu Yi, felt as if their bodies were being devoured. Two elders even fell to the ground and struggled a few times, but they still could not get up.

The other few people were also pale. They were probably also injured.

“Xuan De, Wei Ming, are you alright?”

MO Wendao stared at Qin Yu with a sinister expression.

Gu Yi’s face was pale as well. Just now, he was not only affected by the terrifying power of the Saint Kingdom.

There was even an extremely huge will that far exceeded their limits.

If he didn’t have an extremely high-quality protective Dharma Treasure, he would probably be like these people now.

“This Heart of Saint Kingdom is at least ranked in the top five. However, how many more times can you still use it?”

Gu Yi sneered. However, he was cautious and did not continue forward.

He didn’t know how many times the Heart of Saint Kingdom could use its power, so he didn’t dare to rashly attack again. The attack just now had already caused a huge impact on his protective Dharma Treasure, so he wasn’t confident that he could block the next attack.

The power of the two Hearts of Saint Kingdom, the power of Saint Kingdom

that could restrain the natives, completely intimidated the elders of the Demon Sealing Valley.

Qin Yu’s body trembled slightly. He had used the power of the Saint Kingdom twice in a row, causing his body to be unable to withstand it, but there was no change in his gaze.

The suppression of luck that he had sensed would eventually erupt. This kind of situation could not be avoided.

Just like a person’s luck, it would always be high and low. This was his lowest point.

“All of you, leave.”

A gentle voice rang out as a seventy-year-old man walked over from behind.

There was a short hairpin on his head. His hair was tied up into a round hairpin.

His slightly white beard curled up slightly. When he appeared, all the elders, including Gu Yi, bowed respectfully.

“Elder Gu Ying, you’re here.”

This man was Dan’s personal disciple. If there was anything important, Dan would pass it on to him.

Gu Ying’s appearance at this time already represented a part of Dan’s attitude.

Gu Ying raised his head and nodded. He walked to Qin Yu and stared at him for a while.

“My friend, do you know the rules of the Demon Sealing Valley? Why are you attacking without permission?”

“MO Wendao attacked me first, so I had no choice but to fight back. If Elder Gu wants to make a move, just do it. There’s no need to find any excuses.” Qin Yu sneered. He had not even asked what happened but had already decided.

“Truly young and frivolous.”

Gu Ying said with a smile.

He pointed with his finger, and ripples appeared in the air.

In the next moment, a visible shock wave had already hit Qin Yu. The enormous power of the divine might completely locked Qin Yu’s body.

This divine might power was even much stronger than Gu Yi’s.

For a moment, Qin Yu felt as if his divine sense had fallen into an ice cave. His body was unable to react at all.

Boom!

The Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze opened once again, unleashing all of its remaining power.

The huge backlash pushed Qin Yu back fiercely. The power of the wave broke a few of his chest ribs.

If not for the impact of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze neutralizing most of the power, this would probably be a fatal move.

Order of Reflection!

Qin Yu roared as he leaped forward. The power of the Saint Kingdom once again poured into his body.

His divine soul was in extreme pain. The power of Saint Kingdom was too strong. Using this power three times in a row was already unbearable for his divine soul.

However, he couldn’t care less now. He was facing Gu Ying who was at least at the peak of the Dao Consciousness Realm.

If he did not use the power of the Saint Kingdom, he would not have the slightest chance of victory.

The power of Saint Kingdom poured into Tiger Wing, and it suddenly moved.

Swoosh!

A bloody light burst out, and a deep wound appeared on Gu Ying’s chest.

However, Qin Yu felt as if he had hit a stone. Even if he used all his strength, he still could not do further damage.

“Tai Chi Seal! Valley Master has handed the Tai Chi Seal to Elder Gu Ying. I want to see how arrogant this madman can be.”

A look of joy flashed across MO Wendao’s face.

At this moment, the Tai Chi Seal was slowly rotating, facing Tiger Wing.

The image of an old man splitting the earth and the sky, separating the turbid and clear, stabilizing the earth, water, fire, wind, and everything else, appeared.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The pattern continued to change and turned into a golden bridge. Five-colored light shone on the mountains and rivers.

The energy continued to circulate, slowly dissipating the power of Saint Kingdom above Tiger Wing.

Qin Yu’s body twitched a few times and fell to the ground uncontrollably.

He could only feel that his body was out of his control, and his spirit felt weak after using all his strength.

“Great! He’s at his limit! Even if he has two Hearts of Saint Kingdom, his cultivation realm is not enough to support him to use such terrifying power.”

Gu Tian shouted.

“Surrender. ”

Gu Ying put away the Tai Chi Seal and said indifferently.

“Hahaha! Surrender? What do you mean? It’s just that I’m not the one you chose. Such hypocrisy is really disgusting.”

Qin Yu revealed a mocking expression.

In fact, this was just the choice of the Demon Sealing Valley. The Demon Sealing Valley wanted to break through their current predicament.

They could only do their best to find an outsider. If that person could become the ruler of the Saint Kingdom in the future, then the Demon Sealing Valley would not have to be trapped here forever.

This was a difficult investment, and they could only choose one person.

And that person was Hua Tian. Whereas Qin Yu could only be sacrificed. Everything he had, including the Hearts of Saint Kingdom, would become Hua Tian’s.

There could only be one explanation for this. Otherwise, with what had happened in the Treasure Repository Pavilion, they could find out the exact details of what had happened. It would not come to this end.

Gu Ying’s eyes flashed with surprise. He did not expect Qin Yu to know so much.

“Since you can see through it, you should also understand the difficulty of our Demon Sealing Valley. We have no choice but to make this choice.”

Gu Ying sighed and revealed a regretful expression.

He rubbed his hands gently, and a slight rustling sound came from his palms..
