Chapter 1614: Chapter 1614, Yongji’s banquet

“F * ck your grandpa. If you dare to be rude to me again, I’ll stuff your head into Your Butt First!”

Qin Yu rubbed his ears. wasn’t that the voice of Wen Wanyun? !

He hurriedly put away the divine eagle and followed the voice.

Soon, he saw the three drunk people in the great hall.

The one sitting in the middle was Wen Wanyi.

His face was red. Obviously, he had drunk too much.

Qin Yu quickly walked to Wen Wanyi’s side and said with surprise and joy, “Master, you’re Not Dead?”

“You’re the F * cking dead!”Wen wanyi cursed subconsciously.

When he saw Qin Yu’s face clearly, he hurriedly stood up and said, “Qin Yu? Where did you go? F * ck, I thought you were really a coward!”

“Coward?”Qin Yu was stunned and asked in confusion, “What do you mean?”

“What else can I mean? That Yongji had been clamoring with you for several days and almost went on a killing spree. If grandfather hadn’t arrived in time, who knows how many people would have died,”Wen da muttered.

“That’s right, that’s right,”Wen er echoed.

Then, Wen Wanji pulled Qin Yu to sit down. He told Qin Yu the whole story.

After Qin Yu heard it, he couldn’t help but feel angry.

“Qu Zhu and monk Hongxi are both injured?”Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

“Yes, Qu Zhu is injured, but monk Hongxi’s life and death are unknown,”Wen Wanji said.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He didn’t expect so many things to happen after he left.

“If someone didn’t claim that the sect master of the Tianyun sect is back, the situation would be even worse,”Wen Wanji said in a deep voice.

“He’s Back?”Qin Yu was slightly surprised.

Wen wanyun sneered and said, “With my understanding of him, he definitely hasn’t returned, and he definitely won’t come back at this time.”

“He has never been interested in being a hero. He’s very different from Xiao Hai.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Although the two of them were blood-related brothers, their personalities were indeed completely different.

“Tomorrow, the eternal limit meeting will hold a grand meeting in eternal limit city. It’s said to be for negotiations, but in reality, it’s just to find out the truth,”Wen Wanyi said with a dark expression.

Qin Yu nodded slightly, then said coldly, “That’s fine. Tomorrow, I’ll Go and end things with eternal limit!”

Although Qin Yu hadn’t reached the middle stage of the Almighty Realm, he wasn’t afraid of dealing with eternal limit.

“Alright, let’s not talk about that. Let’s drink first,”said Big Wen as he pulled Qin Yu along.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “You guys drink. I’ll go to wind bamboo mountain to see Qu Zhu.”

Wen wanyun grunted in gratitude and said, “There have been quite a number of people who have gone to visit during this period of time, but they all returned in defeat. You...”

“He will see me,”said Qin Yu.

Seeing this, Wen Wanyun did not try to persuade Qin Yu. He only told Qin Yu to be careful.

Therefore, Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle and rushed towards the wind bamboo mountain.

Wind Bamboo Mountain.

Qu Zhu activated the formation and sealed the entire wind bamboo mountain.

This formation was quite superb. Rumor has it that in order to prevent anyone from disturbing him, qu Zhu had specially paid a huge price to set up this formation.

After rushing all the way to wind bamboo mountain, Qin Yu stood at the door and shouted into the wind bamboo mountain, “Big Brother Qu Zhu, Qin Yu requests to see you!”

After a loud shout, Qin Yu stood at the door and waited quietly.

Very soon, a light flashed in front of him and a tree-lined path appeared in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not waste any time and quickly stepped into the wind bamboo mountain.

There was a bamboo bed in the bamboo forest of the wind bamboo mountain.

At this moment, Qu Zhu was lying on this bed to recuperate.

His internal Qi was not calm, and there were spots of scars on his body.

“Big Brother Qu Zhu!”

Qin Yu quickly walked over and crouched in front of the bamboo bed.

Qu Zhu slowly stood up and said, “You’re back.”

Qin Yu acknowledged and then asked, “How are your injuries?”

Qu Zhu waved his hand and said, “It’s just a small injury. I really didn’t expect that a mere baro would have such ability...”

“Baro? The one who attacked was the Baro of the three madmen?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

Qu zhu grunted and said, “I don’t know what kind of cultivation method this baro has cultivated. His strength has soared, far surpassing the past. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have fallen to such a state.”

“Since they have joined the northern lands, the northern lands will naturally teach them the cultivation technique.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Qu Zhu sighed and said with a sigh, “Speaking of which, it’s really embarrassing...”

“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. What they cultivate are all techniques of the immortal slaying sect. It’s already not bad that you can defeat him.”Qin Yu said sincerely.

The immortal slaying sect was once a top-tier great sect in its glory days. It was an existence that suppressed the nine great families of the Holy Region. The cultivation technique they cultivated was naturally incomparable.

“You should be careful too. Yongji has been clamoring for many days,”qu Zhu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu sneered, “Even if he doesn’t look for me, I will look for him. This bastard should pay the price for his actions.”

Following that, Qin Yu took out the herbs from his spatial magic artifact and planned to refine the herbs for Qu Zhu.

The injuries on Qu Zhu’s body were not serious. With Qin Yu’s ability, he was able to recover to his peak in the shortest amount of time.

He took out the medicinal cauldron and began to refine medicine for Qu Zhu.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. The world’s sect had also received eternal pole’s invitation.

Eternal Pole City was dead silent. It no longer had the glory of the past.

And on the back mountain of Eternal Pole Manor, this place was still filled with dense air. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This back mountain was like a paradise. There were fine wine and delicacies. A faint fragrance assailed one’s face, forming a sharp contrast with the dead silence outside.

“I’ve finally waited for this day,”Yong Ji said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

All the major sects in the world had received Yong Ji’s invitation, and Yong Ji had already set up an inescapable net here. Who knew how many northern land cultivators and paintings were hidden in the dark.

As long as the sect leader of the Tianyun sect didn’t come, those who came today would die without a doubt.

At noon, one sect leader after another arrived.

They gathered together and discussed something in a low voice. No one greeted Yong Ji.

Yong Ji couldn’t help but sigh, “When I held the banquet last time, I was still one of the most respected people in the South Province. I didn’t expect that no one would take me seriously in such a short time.”

At this point, Yong Ji paused and then smiled, “That’s true. They are just a bunch of dead people. Why should I care about the respect of dead people?”

Soon, more and more people came to the back of the mountain. Almost all the people from the major sects and sects had arrived.

At this moment, Kong you and a few sect masters appeared at the door.

“This banquet concerns the life and death of the South Province. Everyone, please stay calm,”Kong you urged.

The person next to him snorted and said, “If you can really make the northern region leave the southern region, we will submit to you.”

Kong you smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I will do my best to convince Yongji.”
