2532 The Inner Change

Deathwing Draco spread his black wings and disappeared from where he was.

At this moment, this monster race army completely lost hope after their first three attacks could not defeat the human race.

In the following half a day, this army was completely killed by Qin Yu and the others.

“Let’s see if we can plunder anything from these orcs.”

Qin Yu shouted, and his divine sense swept across the ground.

Apart from their slightly better weapons, the ground was utterly empty. There seemed to be nothing valuable.

After a while, the people cleaning up the battlefield returned with news.

“Qin Yu, there’s nothing on these orcs. There doesn’t seem to be anything else other than their muscles.”

Xiaobai of Demon-slaying Peak said with a bitter smile. He threw a piece of meat at Qin Yu.

“Why don’t we marinate this thing and sell it as a specialty in the Holy Region?”

“F*ck you. These orcs live in damp and dark places. They stink. Who wants to eat this?”

Qin Yu turned around and kicked Xiaobai as he shouted.

“Retreat. Let’s go back to Solitary Cloud City and rest. We’ll make plans later.”

Unusual things had already happened here, one after another. Two experts and a monster race army had appeared in succession.

This meant that there was a high chance that this place had been targeted, or rather, they had been targeted. Therefore, they could not continue staying here.

They probably would not be so fortunate if more monster race armies appeared.

The group of people jumped onto various space navigation magical artifacts. After two days of travel, they returned to Solitary Cloud City. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In this battle, 700 or so people from Human Race Watch died.

However, they had killed 5,000 four-winged orc army and 3,000 flame spirits.

In terms of the ratio of casualties, the performance this time was actually considered very good. The only shortcoming was that they did not kill any high-level living beings in the monster realm.

This made Qin Yu a little worried. Could it be that their actions had always been under surveillance?

In that case, their situation would be a little dangerous instead.

The enemy was in the open while they were in the dark. If they calculated while they acted and encircled them again, they would probably not be as lucky as they were this time.

“Qin Yu.”

Sitting beside Qin Yu, the peak master’s expression seemed to struggle as if he was making a choice.

Suddenly, he stood up and said as if he had made up his mind.

“Pass on Brilliance of Stars and Moon to me, and I’ll abandon the Way of Thunder I cultivated before and switch to this Combined Attack Technique. Moreover, most people on the other three peaks want to learn this technique.”

“Peak Master, your current soul power has already reached the Tribulation Third Level Soul Sinking, and the phantom of the throne is gradually appearing. It’s almost certain that you’ll reach the fourth level. Why are you abandoning the previous cultivation method at this time?”

Qin Yu asked with a frown. To be honest, he felt it a waste to use the peak master’s strength to cultivate the Brilliance of Stars and Moon.

Once he started cultivating the Brilliance of Stars and Moon, he would be comprehending the power of another type of Path of Heaven.

This power was the most basic explosive power of the physical body. It was infused with the heavenly sea reflected by countless stars.

After that, the stars in the sky would attack together, and the power of the stars would combine to form a massive force.

Unlike the pure physical strength of the monster race, this Brilliance of Stars and Moon combined with a portion of the power of soul comprehension, and then the physical body would trigger this power.

With this change, this cultivation method well suited the human race cultivators.

This kind of Combined Attack Technique did not involve just a few people, but thousands, or even more.

Therefore, it was tremendously difficult to create a Combined Attack Technique, especially to combine this power to the greatest extent.

The more complicated the technique, the more people would attack together, and the more energy conflicts would occur.

This resulted in the fusion power being increasingly weaker, which was why Flower Granny and Dean Lei were tremendously shocked when they saw this technique.

With the strength of the peak master’s soul, he could sense the more formidable power of the stars. With him as the leader, he would launch this combined attack.

However, the price he had to pay was that he would have to spend a vast amount of time cultivating this new cultivation method.

The original immortal scripture of Immortal Emperor Lei could no longer be used.

It took a long time to comprehend each power of the Path of Heaven. Even a genius like Yan Ruoxue, who could trigger the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation, could only focus on the Way of Space.

The Peak Master was silent for a long time before he said.

“In this battle with the orcs, I realized that we were actually ridiculously weak. Even with my current strength of the Tribulation Third Level, the effect was negligible. Without you blocking the first wave of attacks, I’m afraid Human Race Watch would have suffered heavy casualties today. My request isn’t much. Killing more of these beasts in future wars is my long-cherished wish. This is also what the disciples of the three peaks think.”

Seeing the flame spirits’s brutal methods against the human race here, the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak could not let go.

Moreover, the arrogant thoughts of many True Saint disciples were crushed when facing the orc army.

In the face of their first wave of joint attack, many people were so shocked that their bodies could not even move.

“Alright, Peak Master, as long as you’ve made up your mind, this is the complete cultivation method. If there are still people in the sect willing to cultivate it, you can directly impart it to them.”

Qin Yu sent the complete version of the cultivation method to the peak master’s sea of consciousness directly. Now that more True Saints had joined them, it was actually good news. Moving on, they would play a greater role when they coordinated better.

“Qin Yu, is there a suitable technique of the Combined Attack Technique for my Gu family to cultivate? Most of the members of my Gu family cultivate the power of water. Although it’s not enough to attack, it has many healing and defensive techniques. It can also play a key role in war. It would be a waste to abandon it just like that.”

Gu Wanqing asked with a frown. The power of the combined attack, the Brilliance of Stars and Moon of the three peaks of Thunder Courtyard had indeed amazed her.

However, after hearing the conversation between Qin Yu and the peak master, she felt a little conflicted.

“If the people of the Gu family can be the support, there are suitable ones. This combined attack cultivation technique is divided into three parts, Unity of Will, Elemental Resonance, and Brilliance of Stars and Moon. Through the resonance of mental strength, in Unity of Will, many cultivators form a powerful willpower field that can strengthen each other’s defensive will and resistance.”

“You mean that we can cultivate the first two steps and then use elemental resonance to cast simple water elemental techniques?”

Gu Wanqing’s eyes lit up.

“That’s right. If it’s for defense and healing, you don’t have to worry about the internal strife force between the elements. You can do your best to unleash the resonance of the elements to the extreme and then use a simple technique. This way, whether it’s the healing power or the defensive technique, it will greatly improve. However, the specific details will have to be studied by the people of the Gu family. It’s best to impart the technique in three parts.”

Qin Yu wrapped the contents of the first two parts with his divine sense and sent them into Gu Wanqing’s sea of consciousness.
