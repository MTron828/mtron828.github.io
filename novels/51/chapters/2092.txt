2093 The Mysterious Person Appears

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He knew Yao Xi’s words were not meant to be friendly. Clearly, he was trying to provoke a fight.

However, after much thought, it was not candid enough to hide it deliberately.

Therefore, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Brother Yao is right. If I work hard, I might have a chance.”

The scene was slightly quiet. They seemed to be quite shocked by Qin Yu’s “arrogance”.

Everyone knew that currently, Teng Zi Xu was the number one person. He was also the person with the highest chance of stepping into the Immortal Emperor realm. However, Qin Yu actually dared to boast so shamelessly.

“I also believe that everyone here should have this opportunity,” Qin Yu continued.

Teng Zixu smiled faintly and said, “Brother Qin, you’re right. The dao technique is fair. Naturally, everyone will have a chance.”

After that, Teng Zixu stood up and said, “Today is a grand event organized for me. I need to excuse myself. Hope you guys enjoy yourselves.”

After that, Teng Zixu walked away.

After he left, Yao Xi said sarcastically, “Brother Qin, you have driven Teng Zixu away in anger.”

“Anger? It can’t be, right?” Qin Yu pretended to be surprised. “Teng Zixu is talented and dignified in demeanor. He has the courage of a righteous path. He shouldn’t be so small-minded like you, right? Otherwise, how does he comprehend the true dao technique?”

Yao Xi’s expression changed. He said with a cold face, “Did you say I’m small-minded? Qin Yu, what do you mean?”

“I mean it literally,” Qin Yu said in neither a servile nor overbearing manner.

Yao Xi narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Qin Yu, you’ve already offended the Si family. What? Are you trying to offend the Yao family as well?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “When you have a lot of troubles or problems, you become immune to them and no longer fear them. Your Yao family has attacked me many times. What do I fear? Brother Yao, if you’re not convinced, you can follow me out of this Teng family’s small world. We can have a competition, and you’ll take full responsibility for your own life and death. How about it?”

“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Yao Xi slammed the table, and his face was full of anger. The killing intent also aroused with it.

In the void of the small world, a light instantly flashed again. It was clearly a warning to Yao Xi.

“Come with me then.” Qin Yu stood up and said.

Qin Yu had long been annoyed by this Yao Xi. If there were a chance, he would teach him a lesson.

“You two should calm down. In such a grand event, we should drink and discuss the dao,” Saintess Gu tried to smooth things over.

“Hmph!” Yao Xi snorted coldly and said, “You want to discuss the dao with him?” I’m afraid that he, Qin Yu, is not worthy. I’m making a move now!”

After saying this, Yao Xi left the table.

Holy Son Jiang nudged Qin Yu using his shoulder and said with a smile, “Actually, I don’t like this guy either. He’s always stirring up trouble.”

“Why don’t you teach him a lesson for me?” Qin Yu joked.

“If you’re willing to let me read through the Traceless Immortal Scripture, I’ll send him a letter of challenge now!” Holy Son Jiang patted his chest and said.

“Alright, but you must hand over the Jiang family’s immortal scripture. How about it?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Holy Son Jiang glared at him and then scolded, “Go to hell! You indeed don’t miss out on any benefits!”ραпdα `n?ν?| сom

Qin Yu could not help but laugh. He waved his hand and did not continue this topic.

This grand event was quite luxurious. All kinds of rare and exotic fruits were served, and there were even some thousand-year-old divine medicines, such as Fire Spirit Fruit, Golden Crow Bloodline, Azura Dragon Jade Elixir, and so on.

These were tremendously precious existence in the Holy Region, but now, they were placed on the table like ordinary dishes.

More and more people came to participate in the grand event. They could be seen almost everywhere in the small world.

Not far away, numerous rogue cultivators were waiting and watching. They seemed to want to get a glimpse of the charm of the number one person of the younger generation.

Teng Zixu’s aura was indeed extraordinary. His status in the Teng family was also incredibly high. Even his father, Teng Tian, practically followed his orders. This inevitably made Qin Yu feel a little strange.

“The Teng family is indeed a strange family,” Qin Yu muttered to himself, rubbing his chin,

Qin Yu didn’t know much about the Teng family, but ever since he heard what Saintess Gu said, he was even more curious.

Glancing at this grand event, it was incomparably lively. Resplendent immortal lamps hanging high in the sky like stars decorating the night sky illuminated the entire small world like during daytime.

Under the illumination of the lights, the spacious square was full of a dazzling array of delicacies. The exquisite porcelain was filled with all kinds of immortal wine. The fragrance assailed the nose, making people drool.

The Teng family spared no effort for this grand event. They invited the disciples of various aristocratic families, rogue cultivators, and top-notch martial artists and caused the entire small world to immerse in a prosperous scene.

Standing in the crowd, Qin Yu’s gaze shuttled through this bustling grand event, and felt the unprecedented atmosphere. He thought to himself, “The Teng family truly lives up to its reputation. This bustling grand event is comparable to the banquet of the Heavenly Court. It’s truly an eye-opener.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just as the joyous atmosphere was boiling, the door suddenly flashed again, and someone leaped in!

He stepped into the void and flapped his wings, bringing with him a gust of wind that instantly attracted everyone’s attention!

The man was tall and slender. He was dressed in white and had two tremendously large wings on his back. He was wearing a mask that covered half of his face!

Even so, everyone could still feel his beautiful face under the mask!

The arrival of this person instantly tensed up the atmosphere. In less than half a second, everyone came back to their senses!

“It’s that mysterious person of the demon race!”

“The mysterious person of the demon race… Is he crazy? He actually dares to come to the Teng family’s grand event! Didn’t he know all the members of the nine great aristocratic families are gathering here?”

“How dare he! He killed so many heirs of the various aristocratic families, yet he still dares to appear in public at the Teng family’s grand event. Once the Teng family seals off the entrance, won’t he die here?”

Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes. He looked up at this mysterious person, and his heart was even more shocked!

Coming to the Teng family’s grand event alone, what was he trying to do? Could it be that he wanted to take the opportunity to kill the heirs of the nine great aristocratic families?

As expected, more than half of the Holy Sons of the nine great aristocratic families had come. However, if he were to attack here, it would be tantamount to courting death!

“It’s you!” Si Qianjing was the first to regain his senses. He was furious, and his hands were flashing with light, ready to attack at any moment!

“The mysterious person from the demon race… You actually dare to come to the Teng family’s grand event!” the elder of the Yao family said coldly.

“It’s good that you came. We were worried that we couldn’t find you. I didn’t expect you to come knocking on our door!” an elder from another aristocratic family shouted.

The mysterious man, stepping into the void, was silent. Looking at everyone below, his internal qi was calm, like a small bridge with flowing water. No one could feel the slightest fluctuation.
