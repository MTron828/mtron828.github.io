Chapter 571: Breaking into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu stared fixedly at this video. His entire body was trembling violently!

A terrifying killing intent erupted!

This killing intent was at an unprecedented peak. It sent the man with the mustache and the others flying!

“Ruoxue...” Qin Yu shivered. His eyes were bloodshot. He looked like a beast that had lost its rationality!

“Bro, you’re too scary.” The man with the mustache, afraid that he would be affected, hurriedly jumped to the side.

Qin Yu took out his phone and immediately called the person who sent the message.

The call was quickly picked up, and a somewhat familiar man’s voice came from the other end.

“Who are you? How did you get this video? Also, where is Ruoxue now?!” Qin Yu questioned in a hoarse voice.

A cautious voice came from the other end.

He said on the phone, “Qin Yu, I’m Yan Yongxiu.”

“Yan Yongxiu...” Qin Yu whispered.

He didn’t expect that the person on the phone was Yan Ruoxue’s father.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel angry. He shouted angrily, “Yan Yongxiu! You coward! Don’t you feel anything when you see Ruoxue suffer?! Do you want to be Yan Sihai’s lap dog forever?!”

Yan Yongxiu didn’t get angry at Qin Yu’s criticism.

He said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, I’m also helpless.”

“All along, Yan Sihai’s influence has been extremely strong. Moreover, he has been planning to become the Yan family’s successor for a long time.”

“Now, I have no real power. Although I’m said to be one of the four leaders of the Yan family, I’m actually just a puppet. The power that I have is almost zero.”

Qin Yu didn’t speak, and he waited for Yan Yongxiu to continue.

Yan Yongxiu continued, “Ever since Yan Sihai became the Yan family’s successor, he no longer cares about Ruoxue’s life or death.”

“This time, Ruoxue was taken away by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but Yan Sihai didn’t pay any attention to it. In the entire Yan family, no one knows what happened to Ruoxue and what kind of situation she is facing.”

“I’ve already used almost all my connections to get this video.”

Yan Yongxiu’s tone was somewhat sorrowful and painful, and his voice was even quivering slightly.

“Qin Yu, I take back my prejudice against you,” Yan Yongxiu said in a trembling voice.

“I only have Ruoxue. She’s my only daughter. Right now, the only person I can count on is you...”

“Qin Yu, no matter what, you have to save Ruoxue. I beg you...”

Yan Yongxiu finally couldn’t hold it in any longer and started sobbing softly over the phone.

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold and he couldn’t contain his anger.

He took a deep breath and said, “There’s no need for you to say it. No matter what, I will save Ruoxue.”

After saying this, Qin Yu hung up the phone.

He took a deep breath, but the anger in his heart was still hard to restrain.

“Man with the mustache, take the two of them to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.” Qin Yu took out his elder token and handed it to man with the mustache.

After the man with the mustache took the token, his eyes couldn’t help but light up. He said with an embarrassed smile, “Bro, this is the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s elder token. Aren’t you afraid that I will take the token and run away? Or do something bad?”

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “Then I’ll definitely kill you.”

The man with the mustache shivered and rolled his eyes. “I’m just joking. Don’t be so agitated.”

“By the way, where are you going? I still have something to tell you,” the man with the mustache said mysteriously.

Having said that, he moved closer and said secretly, “This is a huge matter! Even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association doesn’t know about it!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “I want to go to the Martial Arts Association. Nothing is more important than saving Ruoxue.”

“Ruoxue?” The man with the mustache touched his chin.

It was obvious that he had heard of Yan Ruoxue’s name.

“Since ancient times, heroes have had a thing for femme fatales,” the man with the mustache muttered.

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to listen to his nonsense. Whenever he thought of the scene in the video, Qin Yu’s heart felt like it was being cut by a knife.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association...” Qin Yu clenched his teeth tightly.

At this moment, his hatred had reached its peak!

Not only did he have hatred towards the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but also towards the Yan family!

“I will definitely kill you!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth!

That night, he went straight to the airport and headed straight to Jingdu.

As the most authoritative organization in the martial arts world, almost no one dared to challenge the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

At least in the martial arts world, no one would choose to offend the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

But no one expected that a young man was going to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association alone.

Early in the morning, it was quiet in front of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

But amidst this quietness, there was a sense of solemnity.

“Okay, it’s time to change shifts.” Two people walked out of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

The other two yawned and said, “I’ve been sleepy for a long time. I’ll leave it to you guys.”

These few people in charge of guarding the door were actually peak Inner Strength Grandmasters! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This was enough to prove the strength of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association

They were in charge of guarding the door, but in reality, it was just standing guard. This was because in all these years, no one had ever forcefully barged into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

However, at this moment, a figure walked straight towards the door.

His entire body was overflowing with killing intent. Even from a few miles away, they could feel an intense chill!

Even though he was alone, he gave people a sense of intimidation that was akin to an army of thousands of horses!

“Who are you? Stop!” The two security guards immediately shouted.

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold, and he didn’t say a word.

“I said stop!” The two people were instantly enraged, and they took a step forward together!

“This is the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s headquarters. No one is allowed to get close to it!”

“If you don’t want to die, get lost!”

Qin Yu looked at the two of them coldly and said in a cold voice, “Get lost.”

The two of them looked at each other and then sneered. “I think you have lost your mind. Do you know where you are? This is...”

“Bang!”

Before he could finish his words, his head was smashed by a punch!

The other security guard’s face instantly turned pale, and his body trembled.

“You...”

“Scram.” Qin Yu only spat out one word.

The security guard didn’t dare to say anything more, and turned to run.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and walked towards the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

This was Qin Yu’s first time entering the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. As soon as he stepped in, he felt a strong sense of oppression.
