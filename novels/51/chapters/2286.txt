2287 Two-Faced Buddha’s Scheming

“Boss… Save me!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu quickly stepped back. The flames slowly burned this beast into ashes.

“Brother Qin Yu, are you alright?”

Yun Qingyun seemed to be in disbelief and asked timidly.

“I’m fine. None of these scumbags can escape today.”

Qin Yu touched her head. This little girl must have been scared out of her wits for the past few days. She held the dagger so tightly that she did not even realize the edge of the dagger had cut her palm.

“You possess great strength. Why don’t you join me in becoming rulers of this chaotic world, enjoying the fruits of our arduous cultivation?”

Monk Hua Tian chuckled and said.

“Our paths diverge, and we can’t conspire together.”

Seeing Niu Er nearly completely burned, Qin Yu directly blew up his head with a punch.

There was a reason why a ruthless rogue cultivator like Niu Er could live for so long. Despite being in sixth grade, he still went all out when he attacked a fourth grade. Qin Yu would probably be in trouble if his strength were not superior to his.

“Hey, you can’t say so. What’s the point of our cultivation if it isn’t for enjoyment?”

Hua Tian laughed heartily.

“Qin Yu, be careful. This monk is also known as the Two-faced Buddha. He is also among the top ten rogue cultivators in this galaxy and has a solid foundation in Buddhist cultivation. Even the three major sects must provide him with resources every hundred years.”

Elder Guai seemed to have recognized this person and suddenly reminded him.

“Two-faced Buddha?”

Qin Yu felt strange and asked.

“This person is tremendously meticulous in his cultivation path. He’s tremendously ruthless toward those weaker than him but never provokes the stronger ones. He treats those stronger than him differently, thus known as the Two-faced Buddha.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu was a little eager to give it a try. However, he did not know this Double-faced Buddha’s strength compared to Situ Haoyue.

Although Situ Haoyue lost in the previous battle, his condition at that time was not at peak state.

“You must be careful. This person stepped into the ninth-grade True Saint realm a long time ago. Moreover, he has experienced several major disasters. Many cultivators in the galaxy died, but he instead obtained many opportunities. He’s not leaving because he probably thinks he’s stronger than you.”

“Whoosh!”

“What a powerful body! This palm of mine can smash an ordinary seventh-grade demonic beast into pieces.”

Hua Tian exclaimed, and his face revealed a thoughtful expression.

“Qin Yu, you must be careful. This monk is very powerful. Even our Yun family’s strongest magical artifact couldn’t harm him.”

The head of the Yun family said anxiously from behind.

“It’s my turn now.”

Qin Yu also threw a punch, and the fist qi directly bombarded the monk’s body.

The monk’s kasaya turned, relieving the terrifying force from his fist.

“You have the qualifications to become a true member under my command. Would you like to consider it? With me around, you will undoubtedly escape the calamities of this chaotic world and live a fulfilling life. Kneel, for this is your last chance.”

Hua Tian spoke earnestly, and with each word he uttered, his voice resonated like a Buddhist chant, seemingly attempting to resonate with Qin Yu’s divine sense and gain his acceptance of his word.

“Master Huan Tian is giving you a chance. Qin Yu, you have to cherish it. Don’t think a bit of luck will make you superior. Master Huan Tian’s Primordial Heavenly Divination can foresee the future.”

Nangong Qi was also clamoring at the side.

“Kneel!”

Buddhist light suddenly appeared on Hua Tian’s body, and the word exploded in Qin Yu’s divine sense like lightning.

Qin Yu’s divine sense was like a vast lake, unmoving.

Shrinking Ground Into An Inch!

Qin Yu stepped forward, and dozens of Fire Fists landed on Hua Tian’s body.

Huan Tian again used his kasaya to block the terrifying Fire Fist.

“Boom!”

A giant fist smashed toward the kasaya.

The Fist of Annihilation!

The terrifying power pierced through the kasaya and hit Huan Tian.

Hua Tian retreated dozens of steps and finally dispelled the terrifying force.

Qin Yu sighed with emotion. This Monk Hua Tian must be cultivating the physical body as well. The palm struck him as if it had landed on tough leather.

Qin Yu clenched his fist. Suo Lin’s boxing gloves on his hand were burning with a scorching flame.

The temperature of the entire space rose at a terrifying speed. Qin Yu used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch to arrive before Hua Tian.

Suo Lin’s fist suddenly struck out, and the power of annihilation wrapped around the fist.

“It’s a pity that you spent too much time comprehending the power of the Path of Heaven in the past. Thus your soul could not comprehend the rules for a long time. With your soul fusing with the Path of Heaven, I let you experience the power of the current Path of Heaven!”

“Buddhist Dharma, the Great Diamond Treasury of the Ten Directions in Two Realms!”

Huan Tian clapped his hands, and a golden light shot into his body.

His body suddenly swelled up, and the sound of bones stretching out came from his body. A terrifying pressure directly reached Qin Yu’s divine sense.

A sense of danger suddenly flashed across Qin Yu’s divine sense. This person’s strength was terrifyingly formidable.

The realm of such rules was close to Great Success, even if it was not. Moreover, it was a Great Dao with tremendous might.

“Boom!”

Hua Tian transformed into a giant Buddha at this moment. He carried a heaven-shaking aura as he arrived above Qin Yu. In an instant, hundreds and thousands of palms bombarded down wildly.

“The cosmic form.”

Qin Yu did not back down at all, and his massive fist met his.

Qin Yu felt a massive sense of oppression with every punch. That massive force directly crushed his power of annihilation and then ruthlessly slapped his body. He would have been seriously injured in this instant if it was not for his strong body.

“Hahaha, Kid, did you see it for yourself?”

The words of Vajra were uttered word by word. The sound of the words instantly turned into an offensive weapon. Each word detonated the spatial spiritual energy in front of Qin Yu and exploded violently.

“Go to hell, Kid. I will inherit your luck and karma!”

Hua Tian’s face contorted into a sinister grin as he roared. His massive arm slowly retracted, and an unknown fire burned on his arm.

The enormous Fist of Vajra shot out like a released arrow. Wherever the arm passed, golden light radiated, and the divine sound emerged from the void, disrupting the minds of those around.

“Can you inherit my luck?”

Qin Yu said indifferently. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The giant cosmic form also punched back, and the chaotic qi on his body rushed into Suo Lin’s gloves. The fire energy that could destroy everything instantly spewed out.

The massive Fire Fist carried the internal qi of burning everything. This punch was the full power of a peak tribulation divine artifact.

Even though it was driven by a fourth-grade True Saint, it was of the ninth grade!

“Boom!”

The moment the two fists met, a terrifying internal qi exploded from the center.

A shockwave visible to the naked eye spread like water, turning all the rocks and ground into dust.

Qin Yu’s body trembled violently, subjected to a significant impact.
