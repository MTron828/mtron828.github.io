Chapter 230: See You In a Year! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of Han Wei at all. He even provoked him!

This made Han Wei a little interested.

He sized up Qin Yu and said indifferently, “It’s been a long time since an ant dared to yell at me.”

Almost everyone around Han Wei obeyed his orders.

Which one of those people wasn’t a big shot in Jingdu?

But Qin Yu, a maggot who lived at the bottom, actually dared to defy him!

How interesting!

Han Wei couldn’t help but laugh out loud!

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “I was born at the top of the mountain. With a word from me, I can change your life. You’re a maggot, so where on earth do you get your confidence from?”

Qin Yu climbed up from the ground.

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said coldly, “I don’t like your lofty attitude, and I don’t like your attitude of looking down on us, people at the bottom.”

“Do you really think you’re invincible? How many families have fallen during changing times?”

“Your name is Han Wei, right? In less than a year, I will go to Jingdu to propose marriage. I hope that you and I can fight again.”

Qin Yu’s words were neither servile nor overbearing, but it made Han Wei laugh non-stop!

“Hahaha, this is really too interesting, too interesting!” Han Wei laughed wildly.

“Did you hear that? An ant is challenging me.” Han Wei shook his head.

Qin Yu sneered. “You don’t have to laugh. Just say whether you dare to agree or not.”

Han Wei narrowed his eyes and said, “It’s not that I don’t want to accept it, but I don’t think you’re worthy enough.”

“What right does a maggot that I can stomp to death with just a lift of my foot have to challenge me?”

The more Han Wei thought about it, the more ridiculous it felt.

All of this was too surreal for Han Wei!

He had never thought that there would be an ant who dared to provoke him like this.

“Then it means you still don’t have the guts to agree,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

“It seems that you’re not that confident about the resources of the Han family and your talent,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Han Wei narrowed his eyes.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said in an icy voice, “You’re goading me? Very well, you succeeded.”

“In a year, I will wait for you in Jingdu.”

“I will personally step on a maggot like you in front of Yan Ruoxue!”

At this point, Han Wei paused.

He glanced at Yao Qing and said indifferently, “At that time, everyone around you will die.”

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold, and fury ignited in his heart!

These so-called big shots didn’t take ordinary people seriously at all!

It was as if they could casually decide a person’s life or death!

“Han Wei, it’s a deal.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“I’ll see you in Jingdu. If I win, I won’t let the Han family off the hook!”

“I’ll kill all of you so-called big shots and blue-blood families who toy with other people’s lives!” Qin Yu said coldly.

Han Wei was laughing his head off.

“You’re the most courageous ant I have ever seen!” Han Wei sneered.

“Don’t worry. When you go to Jingdu, I will propose to Miss Yan and kill you at the same time.”

Han Wei’s tone was indifferent, as if he would just kill an ant, and not a human.

“Let’s go.” Then, Han Wei turned around and prepared to leave with his entourage. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Oh right, I forgot about something.” At this moment, Han Wei seemed to have remembered something.

He turned around and waved his hand lightly. A fierce force instantly blasted towards Qin Yu’s house!

“Boom!”

With just a casual strike, the house in front of Qin Yu collapsed!

“I really don’t like to see those photos.” Han Wei snorted coldly.

Photos!

Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly dilated!

Anger almost made him lose his rationality!

He clenched his fists tightly, and was ready to attack at any time!

But in the end, Qin Yu still held it in.

He knew very well that he was definitely not Han Wei’s opponent right now.

“Phew.” Qin Yu let out a long breath.

He looked coldly in the direction Han Wei left with palpitations a flash of coldness in his eyes.

“Han Wei... you won’t always be in that position,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yao Qing, who was at the side, quickly walked over.

He swallowed hard and said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, Han Wei... is so terrifying! The pressure he carries on his body actually made me unable to move...”

Qin Yu glanced at Yao Qing and didn’t say anything.

Han Wei’s strength was indeed beyond imagination.

It was even stronger than the pressure brought by Yan Jiang back then.

The house was destroyed, and the photos on the wall were all reduced to black powder.

This made Qin Yu’s heart ache immensely, and his hatred for Han Wei deepened by another level.

At the same time, this also made Qin Yu clearly realize the gap between him and the young masters of Jingdu.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu regained his rationality.

He turned around and got into the car.

“Mr. Qin, where are we going now?” Yao Qing asked.

“Bai City,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

“Okay.” Yao Qing didn’t say anything more. He started the accelerator and sped toward Bai City.

On the highway, the two Audi RS7 let out bursts of roars.

The extremely fast speed caught people’s attention on the highway.

Qin Yu sat in the car with his eyes closed.

He could feel the internal qi in his body and couldn’t help but frown.

He had clearly reached the ceiling of the seventh level of the Foundation Establishment Stage, but he couldn’t break through it.

At this moment, the car suddenly braked! Qin Yu’s head hit the front seat of the car!

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu frowned.

Before Yao Qing could say anything, he saw a BMW M 3 driving side by side with them!

This BMW M 3 had obviously undergone modifications. It was very flashy.

“Mr. Qin, this car is deliberately slamming against us,” Yao Qing said with a frown.

Qin Yu glanced outside and waved his hand. “It’s probably some rich kids. Ignore them.”

“Yes.” Yao Qing nodded. He deliberately slowed down and let the M3 leave first.

He thought that the matter would end here, but he didn’t expect that when they arrived at the toll station, the M3 was actually waiting for Qin Yu.

After seeing Qin Yu’s car, two young men dressed in thuggish clothes walked over.

They knocked on the car door and said provocatively, “What? Are you scared now? Why are you driving so slowly? Why are you driving an RS7?”

Yao Qing’s expression changed and he couldn’t help but scold, “Don’t look for trouble!”

“You’re getting anxious already?” The young man sneered.

“You’re so worked up. Remember to catch up with us later. Otherwise, we won’t let you get off the highway!”

The two young men snorted coldly and turned around to return to the car.

Yao Qing gritted his teeth. He looked at Qin Yu and waited for Qin Yu’s order.
