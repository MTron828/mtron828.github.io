Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer.

He looked at Ye nan coldly and said, “Are you playing with me on Purpose?”

Ye nan sneered and said, “How am I playing with you? My words are very clear. You can choose not to go, or you can leave immediately.”

“Fine, then return my things to me!”Qin Yu scolded angrily.

Ye nan sneered, “You want to take back the things that went into my pocket? Let me tell you, no way!”

“You... are courting death.”Qin Yu’s body emitted an extremely cold chill.

Ye Nan also predicted that Qin Yu needed his help, so he was not afraid at all. He sneered and said, “Why, do you want to attack me? You can try, I’m not afraid of You!”

“Moreover, if anything happens to me, not only will you not be able to get your things back, no one will follow you to the northern border!”

At this moment, Qin Yu was almost driven mad by anger, but his mind could not help but think of the miserable situation of the northern border and the many cultivators of the South Province.

Therefore, Qin Yu once again suppressed his anger.

He took a deep breath and said, “How about this? You will first follow me to the northern border. After the matter is done, I will give you whatever you want.”

“Impossible. I Won’t leave until you bring back what I want,”ye Nan said with a smile.

“This bastard really deserves to die. Give me his body and let me kill him.”

At this moment, Iron Egg’s voice appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu was stunned when he heard the voice. Then, he couldn’t help but be ecstatic!

“Iron Egg, you woke up at the Right Time!”Qin Yu said excitedly.

If he had Iron Egg’s help, why would he need this Bullsh * t ye Nan?

“Phew, I slept so comfortably this time.”Iron Egg’s voice was a bit lazy.

“I haven’t seen you for a few days. How come you have become more timid than before?”Iron Egg said sarcastically.

Qin Yu said impatiently, “Don’t talk nonsense, you know nothing!”

“Hehe, I saw it with my own eyes. If I was being so difficult, I would have smashed his head with a slap long ago!”Iron Egg snorted lightly.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, “I found a body. It is a divine body of the reversion void stage. Sigh, I originally planned to give it to you, but since your performance is so bad, I’d better forget about it.”

“Then hurry up and give me the body!”Heavenly Blood Rainbow said excitedly.

Qin Yu naturally ignored heavenly blood rainbow. Qin Yu couldn’t bear to give him this body.

In his mind, iron egg immediately said excitedly, “A divine body of the reversion void stage? is what you said true?”

“When have I ever lied to You?”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Hearing this, iron egg immediately became anxious. He roared crazily in his mind, “Quick, give me the body!”

“That won’t do. Based on your performance, I’d better give it to someone else.”Qin Yu stretched lazily.

Heavenly Blood Rainbow also became anxious. He shouted desperately in the spatial magic artifact, “Qin Yu, if you are willing to give me your body, I will agree to anything!”

Qin Yu ignored Heavenly Blood Rainbow again. He put his hands behind his back and quietly waited for Iron Egg to beg for mercy.

Ye Nan naturally did not know what had happened. When he saw Qin Yu’s expression, he could not help but look suspicious.

“Is this kid stupid?”Ye Nan said with a frown.

“Kid, if you really don’t want to go to Qingyan Forest, then leave now.”

Qin Yu did not pay attention to Ye Nan. He was still quietly waiting for iron egg.

Soon, iron egg’s aggrieved voice sounded in his mind.

“You... I’m begging you. Give me the body, how about that?”Iron Egg said sullenly.

Qin Yu snorted, “Is that your attitude? Brother? Who’s your brother?”

“You’re My F * cking brother, and you’re my father!”Iron Egg said angrily.

“TSK, tsk, it seems that you’re very reluctant.”

“... I’m really wrong, brother. You’re my real brother from now on. Give me the body, please.”

“Mm... that’s more like it. But let me tell you, I have already planted a mark in my body. If you dare to do anything, I can destroy you at any time!”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s mind moved, and he took out the bronze coffin from the spatial magic artifact.

Seeing this coffin, ye Nan’s eyes lit up. He said excitedly, “I knew you still had a babe on you!”

After saying that, he was about to put the bronze coffin into his bag.

But at this moment, Qin Yu grabbed his wrist.

“This is not for you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Ye Nan glared and said, “What? Don’t you want my help anymore?”

Qin Yu sneered and couldn’t be bothered with ye Nan anymore.

He slowly opened the bronze coffin and revealed the divine body inside.

Seeing this body, everyone could not help but be shocked!

“What a perfect body!”Ye Nan exclaimed.

“Is this the divine body, the divine body of the reversion void stage!”Iron egg shouted excitedly.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I will release your primordial spirit now. As for how to fuse with this divine body, that is up to you.”

Iron egg said impatiently, “Hurry up, I can’t wait any longer!”

Just as Qin Yu was about to release iron egg, ye Nan stretched out his hand to touch the body again.

“Divine body? A divine body at the reversion void stage? !”Ye Nan’s eyes lit up, revealing an intense greed in his eyes.

Qin Yu pushed his hand away and sneered, “You have good taste.”

Ye Nan said anxiously, “Qin Yu, if you are willing to give me this divine body, I will promise you. How about it? I can return all the treasures I took before to you!”

“Damn, this kid is courting death!”Iron Egg was furious and roared crazily.

“Qin Yu, don’t listen to this bastard. When I get out, I will kill him!”

Qin Yu looked at Ye nan coldly and said, “I don’t think that’s necessary.”

After saying that, Qin Yu violently opened ye Nan’s hand. Then, he closed his eyes and released Iron Egg’s primordial spirit from his mind.

A primordial spirit suddenly exploded and instantly floated in the air.

He didn’t waste any time and quickly entered this body. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At this moment, the quiet divine body in the coffin began to shake violently. Rays of light blossomed on the body!

Ye Nan could not help but say angrily, “What’s going on? Is there another primordial spirit in your body?”

Qin Yu looked at Ye nan coldly and said, “If you dare to talk nonsense again, I will kill you immediately.”

At this moment, the corpse in the bronze coffin stopped shaking. Everything instantly fell silent.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He hurriedly walked to the bronze coffin and carefully examined it.

“Damn, you won’t fail, right?”Qin Yu frowned and said.
