Chapter 351: Old Fart? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Han Meng agreed and looked coldly at Han Wei while saying, “Follow me down to meet Mr. Yan.”

“Yes.” Han Wei nodded repeatedly.

The two of them came downstairs.

Facing Yan Sihai, Han Meng immediately changed his attitude.

He went over to shake hands with Yan Sihai and greeted him.

Han Wei hurriedly called out, “Greetings, Mr. Yan.”

Yan Sihai nodded slightly, and then his gaze fell on Han Meng.

“Mr. Yan, you know about what happened yesterday, right?” Han Meng went straight to the point.

Yan Sihai lit a cigar and snorted lightly. “It caused so much commotion, so who wouldn’t know?”

Han Meng frowned and said, “Everyone knows that our family intends to establish a marital alliance with the Yan family, but now, Yan Ruoxue is publicly saying that Qin Yu is her boyfriend. Isn’t this a snub to the Han family?”

Yan Sihai glanced at Han Meng and sneered. “Yan Ruoxue is just a little girl. What can she decide on?”

“Old Mister Yan, not necessarily. As far as I know, Old Mister Yan has always regarded her as the apple of his eye. Yan Ruoxue’s position in the Yan family isn’t inferior to yours, right?” Han Meng went straight to the point without any euphemism.

Yan Sihai’s expression suddenly became a little ugly.

He snorted coldly and said, “My father has always been biased towards her. I really don’t know why.”

“In terms of ability, I’m above her. In terms of seniority, I’m his eldest son!”

“The only reason she can have such a high say is because she has my father’s support!”

The more Yan Sihai spoke, the angrier he became. His face flushed and he was about to slam the table.

Han Meng waved his hand and said, “Alright, Old Mister Yan, let’s talk about how to resolve this matter first.”

“I suggest you accept the interview. Just say that the Yan family has never acknowledged Qin Yu as the son-in-law of the Yan family.”

Yan Sihai glanced at Han Meng and said with a cold expression, “Why are you so anxious? Isn’t my father still alive?”

Han Meng frowned slightly. It could be seen that Yan Sihai was still very afraid of Old Mister Yan.

“Don’t worry. My father will hold a banquet in the next few days. At that time, I will naturally find an opportunity to clarify things.” Yan Sihai waved his hand.

“Hold a banquet? How come I’ve never heard of it?” Han Meng frowned.

“You’ll know soon enough.” Yan Sihai stood up and said.

“My dad won’t live for long. When he dies, I will immediately kill Qin Yu.” Yan Sihai glanced at Han Meng. These words gave the Han family reassurance.

“With your assurance, I’m relieved.” Han Meng also nodded.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was playing chess with Old Mister Yan.

However, Qin Yu was a little absent-minded.

He looked up at Old Mister Yan from time to time, and his face couldn’t help but show a hint of solemnity.

“What happened today?” Old Mister Yan glanced at Qin Yu and asked.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Old Mister Yan, can you let me check your body?”

“Check my body?” Old Mister Yan seemed puzzled.

Qin Yu said, “I don’t know how to explain it to you, but I have to tell you.”

“I can see the aura of death between your eyebrows, and it’s getting more and more serious.”

Old Mister Yan smiled and said, “So?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “From the aura of death between your eyebrows, you don’t look like you will die a normal death.”

Qin Yu had discovered this problem over the past few days. If one died a normal death, the aura of death would be concentrated in the location of the Life Palace.

However, the aura of death between Old Mister Yan’s brows was moving upwards.

This was definitely not a sign of death.

Therefore, Qin Yu couldn’t help but wonder if Old Mister Yan was sick.

Old Mister Yan didn’t seem to be too shocked by Qin Yu’s words.

He put down the chess piece in his hand and said indifferently, “There are many reasons for death. Sometimes, even if it isn’t the end of your life, you still have to die. This is fate.”

“I am fated to die this year, so I will definitely die. Don’t tell me you want to defy the heavens.”

Qin Yu said emotionally, “Cultivation defies the heavens! Old Mister Yan, as long as you don’t die, I have a way to cure you!”

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “It’s not the same. If you forcefully change my fate, it will definitely affect you.”

“I’m just an old man. I’ve lived enough.”

Qin Yu didn’t want to hear this. He said with some pleading, “Old Mister Yan, can you let me check your body for you?”

“When I say no, I mean no!” Old Mister Yan said unhappily.

“Don’t talk about this topic again!”

After saying this, Old Mister Yan left with a cold expression.

Qin Yu was extremely puzzled by Old Mister Yan’s attitude.

He couldn’t understand why Old Mister Yan was so resistant.

“I won’t let you die.” Looking at Old Mister Yan’s back, Qin Yu made up his mind.

...

In the following days, Qin Yu played chess with Old Mister Yan every day.

Qin Yu didn’t mention this topic again, but the aura of death between Old Mister Yan’s brows was getting more and more serious.

At this rate, Old Mister Yan wouldn’t be able to live for more than three days.

His condition was getting worse every day. If it wasn’t for the herbs, Old Mister Yan would have been lying on the bed and unable to move.

That morning, Yan Ruoxue dressed up to the nines and even made breakfast herself.

After Qin Yu and Old Mister Yan got up, Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “Quick, come and eat. Let’s go out together after eating.”

Old Mister Yan said in surprise, “Go out? Where are we going?”

“Gee, Grandpa, you can’t stay at home all the time. Let’s go to the North Province Island for a walk. It’s good for your body.” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand repeatedly and said, “There’s no need for that. I play chess at home. It’s pretty good.”

“No way!” Yan Ruoxue glared at him.

“It wasn’t easy for me to find the time. I’ll go no matter what!” Yan Ruoxue said with an overbearing look.

Old Mister Yan didn’t know how to react. He had no choice but to agree, “Okay, okay, okay. I’ll listen to you.”

After a quick meal, a Mercedes-benz S450 had already been parked at the door.

“Grandpa, get in the car.” Yan Ruoxue ran over and opened the car door for Old Mister Yan.

After the two of them got in the car, Yan Ruoxue personally drove the car and rushed toward the North Province Island.

The North Province Island was a famous scenic spot in Jingdu.

To go from Jingdu to the North Province Island, one had to take a cruise ship and cross the sea.

And the owner of North Province Island was a famous figure in Jingdu.

The three of them arrived at the entrance of the cruise ship. After parking the car, the three of them went to queue up to buy tickets.

The queue at the window was very long, and there were many tourists here.

Yan Ruoxue queued for nearly an hour. When it was her turn, two young men suddenly stood in front of Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue frowned. She patted the young man’s shoulder and said, “Don’t you know how to queue?”

The young man turned around and glanced at Yan Ruoxue, then his eyes immediately lit up.

This woman was so beautiful!

The young man couldn’t help but swallow hard, and his eyeballs almost popped out. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“She told you to queue. Didn’t you hear her?” Qin Yu didn’t like his gaze very much and couldn’t help but say coldly.

Only then did the young man come back to his senses. He glared at Qin Yu and said, “I never wait in line when I buy tickets! Don’t talk nonsense with me!”

After saying that, the young man shouted to the window, “How many tickets are there? I want all of them!”

When he heard this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

“How will others buy tickets if you buy them all?” Qin Yu suppressed his anger and asked.

The young man sneered and said, “What does it have to do with me? I can buy them if I want to. What does it have to do with you?”

Qin Yu looked at the young man coldly and said, “You’d better return the ticket immediately.”

“Are you trying to scare me? Do you know who I am?” The young man sneered.

Just as Qin Yu was about to speak, Old Mister Yan walked forward and said slowly, “Young man, don’t be too arrogant. It’ll get you into trouble.”

The young man glanced at Old Mister Yan and said impatiently, “Where did this old fart come from? What does it have to do with you? Did I talk to you?”
