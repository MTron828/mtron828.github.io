Chapter 1299: Earth chapter 1299, fighting against Ling Yun! 

The two of them were riding on flying demonic beasts as they sped towards Gu City.

“Young master, your injuries have yet to recover. Are you sure you want to go now?”The attendant beside Ling Yun couldn’t help but frown.

Ling Yun said coldly, “I can kill an ant even if I’m not at my peak condition.”

“Young master, don’t Underestimate Qin Yu. Elder Bai and guardian Ren both lost to him,”the attendant said in a deep voice.

Ling Yun snorted but didn’t say anything.

Elder Bai was the weakest of the few elders, so it wasn’t strange for him to lose.

Ling Yun was extremely frustrated during the last battle. He regretted not killing Qin Yu at the first opportunity. Instead, he was like a cat catching a mouse.

This time, I won’t give you any chance... Ling Yun roared in his heart.

...

In Gu City, Qin Yu looked like he was in the prime of his life. Whenever he saw something he wanted to eat, he would pick it up and stuff it into his mouth. He didn’t look like a person who was about to die at all.

“Do you think this kid’s brain isn’t working properly? Or is he confident? Or should I say, he’s just a broken pot that’s broken?”

The two youths on top of the tall building muttered as they stuffed their mouths full of delicacies.

“I don’t know, I don’t know. Didn’t that old man say that this Qin Yu injured the people of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? He must have some ability,”another youth said as he took a gulp of wine.

“Speaking of which, I quite like this kid’s temper and character. If he’s not dead, I’ll have to make friends with him,”another youth said with a smile. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

As he was speaking, a violent wind suddenly whistled past in the sky.

The enormous flying exotic beast blotted out the sky and covered the sun, turning the day into night.

Almost everyone raised their heads to look at this flying exotic beast, their eyes filled with shock.

“Damn, this demonic beast is even cooler than ours!”The two youths on the tall building cursed.

“What kind of bird is this? We’ll change it later!”

Other than the two of them, no one else present was so relaxed.

Even the city Lord of Gu City stood on the high platform and quietly watched everything.

He was worried that the battle between the two of them would destroy Gu City.

Qin Yu stood up from the bench. His previous playful posture was replaced by a cold expression.

“You’re finally here...”Qin Yu clenched his fists lightly. His heart was filled with hatred.

The death of the team leader had something to do with Qin Yu, but Ling Yun was the culprit.

Only by killing Ling Yun would Qin Yu feel better.

Ling Yun stood high in the sky and looked down at Qin Yu.

He jumped down with the almighty beside him.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and quickly noticed that something was wrong with his condition.

“Looks like that punch from the heavenly demon ape caused quite a lot of damage to you,”Qin Yu sneered.

Ling Yun looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “So What? Killing You is enough.”

Qin Yu Sized Ling Yun up and said, “I can tell that you are a petty person just by looking at you, right?”

Ling Yun’s expression turned cold as he said coldly, “Cut the crap. You have to die today. I Won’t give you any chance!”

Qin Yu laughed out loud and said, “What a coincidence! You killed the leader of the hunter organization. I will definitely chop off your head and bury you with the leader!”

“Arrogant words!”After Ling Yun roared, the internal Qi in his body exploded to the maximum!

Just as he had said, he didn’t want to give Qin Yu any more chances. Instead, he chose to end the battle quickly!

Qin Yu had the same mindset. This was his first real battle after coming to the Holy Region, and it was in front of so many people!

If he killed Ling Yun quickly, he would be able to make a name for himself!

Thus, Qin Yu immediately unleashed the fifth level of the battle word technique. His entire body erupted with an extremely terrifying godly power!

Although this power couldn’t be compared to the heavenly demon ape, it was already at the peak among human cultivators!

The atmosphere was extremely tense when their eyes met.

There were people watching from the surroundings. The city Lord immediately activated the formation to protect the city.

“Boom!”

Ling Yun didn’t waste any words. He raised his hand and used the heaven flipping seal!

His huge palm covered the sky and earth as it came crushing down!

This time, Qin Yu didn’t Dodge anymore. Under his peak condition, he wasn’t afraid even when facing the sky-turning seal!

Qin Yu let out a loud roar as he poured his divine power into his right fist. He intentionally threw a punch towards the sky-turning seal!

Boom

The huge collision spread out with the two of them as the center!

Even though there was a large array protecting the city, the powerful internal Qi still repelled countless people. There were even people who lost their lives because of it!

The sky-turning seal seemed to be in a sorry state under Qin Yu’s furious punch!

As Qin Yu roared, his strength was unleashed to the maximum.

Boom

Finally, the sky-turning seal couldn’t take it anymore and was directly shattered!

As for the Spellcaster, Ling Yun, he took a few steps back!

His face turned a few shades paler, and in the next second, he spat out a mouthful of blood!

Although it was only one move, both of them had fused their invincible fighting spirit!

One punch, and the winner was decided!
