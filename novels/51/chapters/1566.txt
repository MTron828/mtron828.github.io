“Pulled together by humans?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

These were two large plates. How could such a huge piece of land be pulled together by humans? How much power would that require?

Xiao Hai en said, “I’m calculating these few days. When the time comes, I’m afraid I’ll need a certain amount of manpower.”

Qin Yu could not help but feel shocked. Towards Xiao Hai’s tyranny, Qin Yu could be said to be dumbstruck.

“You can stay for the time being.”Xiao Hai looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I’m stupid, so I plan to stay behind to fight against the northern lands with you.”

“Thank you.”Xiao Hai nodded. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

On the other side.

Yong Ji was beaten until he was covered in injuries and in extreme pain.

He lay on the bed and panted non-stop.

If it wasn’t for the extremely brilliant spells in the north, he would have already become a corpse.

Baro and Feng Hai had also suffered different degrees of damage. The two of them fought against Xiao Hai, but they were still defeated. This made them feel extremely unbalanced.

Just as they were recovering from their injuries, Sima Bei walked in.

......

He swept his gaze over the few of them and said, “How do you feel?”

Barrow shook his head and said, “I suggest that we get rid of Xiao Hai immediately, no matter how great the price is.”

Sima bei did not say anything. After today’s battle, Sima Bei’s heart was also filled with worry.

That Xiao Hai was like a god of war, he did not know fatigue at all.

What made Sima bei the most worried was that he felt that Xiao Hai had yet to display his true strength.

After all, Xiao Hai did not use any spells and only relied on his dense spiritual power.

“Even I might not be able to defeat Xiao Hai,”Sima Bei said in a deep voice.

His main body was extremely powerful, far surpassing his clone. Even so, Sima bei was still extremely worried. He did not even dare to cross the river of death and step into the southern region.

“And that Qin Yu... We must kill him...”Yong Ji said with great difficulty.

Sima bei glanced at Yong Ji and said, “You don’t need to be anxious. In the following period of time, you should properly cultivate the sacred heart technique.”

“Once the Sacred Heart technique is completed, that Qin Yu isn’t worth mentioning.”

Yong Ji nodded repeatedly. He wouldn’t feel anything if he lost to Xiao Hai.

But now, he had lost to a junior and lost so miserably!

This was something he couldn’t accept!

Sima bei turned around and walked out. Under the biting cold wind, he walked alone in the world of ice and snow. He didn’t know which direction he was walking in.

After a long time, Sima bei came to the center.

There were three people standing there. Each of them had an internal Qi that wasn’t weaker than Sima Bei’s!

And the four of them were the current leaders of the northern lands. They were known as the Four Great Godly Kings!

“They’re here.”

After seeing Sima Bei, one of them opened his mouth and said.

“En.”Sima bei nodded.

“I heard that they lost this battle again.”Another person opened his mouth and asked.

Sima bei sighed slightly and did not say anything for a moment.

“HMPH, if you can’t do it, then let us take action.”Someone mocked.

Sima bei shook his head and said, “The southern region is not as simple as you think. Just talking about that Xiao Hai and the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, we can not underestimate them.”

“HMPH, we are afraid of the wolf before and the tiger after. How can we accomplish great things? We have already decided. We will head to the Southern Region Tomorrow.”One of them said coldly.

Sima bei hurriedly shook his head and said, “Absolutely not!”

“No need to say anything more. We have already consulted the Lord. The Lord has already agreed.”Someone said coldly.

Hearing these words, Sima Bei’s expression changed slightly.

He subconsciously looked at the snowy mountain in front of him.

Under the Snowy Mountain, the sleeping lord of the northern lands.

He had been sleeping for many years. During these years, the northern lands had swallowed countless living beings in order to provide for the lord of the northern lands.

The Lord of the northern lands had absolute authority, so Sima bei could not say anything more.

“Everyone, please remember that you must never go to the Heavenly Cloud sect. Do not offend the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”Sima bei said with a frown.

“Hehe, why? Did that battle leave a scar in your heart?”Someone at the side mocked.

Sima bei opened his mouth and did not know how to reply for a moment.

Sima bei was not born in the north. Back then, before the southern region was unified, he had also been a king in the southern region. It was just that at that time, it was not called the southern region.

It was not until later that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect began to campaign in all directions. He conquered the entire southern region in one go and unified all the sects, big and small.

From then on, Sima Bei fled to the north and became one of the four godly monarchs there.

“I’ve personally seen how terrifying he is,”Sima Bei said in a deep voice.

“Hehe, you’re just exaggerating.”The other three people did not take it seriously at all.

“If we want to enter the southern region, we’ll have to fight with the sect master of the Tianyun sect sooner or later. Why not make a move to probe now?”

Sima bei said in a deep voice, “I suggest that we wait for the master to finish his slumber before we make a move against the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“HMPH! Do We still need the master to make a move on such a small matter? Are the people of the southern region all so timid and afraid of trouble?”A godly king berated.

“Tomorrow, we will head to the southern region and meet the top-notch martial artist of the Southern Region!”

After saying this, the three of them ignored Sima Bei and left in a hurry.

Heavy snow started to fall from the sky. Sima bei looked at the huge snow mountain in front of him without saying a word. No one knew what he was thinking about.

...

Night fell.

The northern border was bone-chilling. Even Qin Yu felt a little uncomfortable.

“Why is the north so cold?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

One had to know that this was a cultivation world. Normally, the weather shouldn’t be so cold.

Could it be that the north is hiding some kind of ultimate dark energy? Qin Yu thought to himself.

He closed his eyes slightly and tried to absorb the dark energy in the air.

As expected! There was actually a trace of dark energy in the air!

Although the ratio was very low, it still confirmed Qin Yu’s guess!

This couldn’t help but make Qin Yu overjoyed! If there really was some kind of ultimate dark energy in the north, it would be a great fortune for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then stood up and went to Xiao Hai’s room.

At this moment, Xiao Hai was still not asleep and was still deducing the formation.

Seeing Qin Yu come in, Xiao Hai stood up and said, “Why? Are you not used to it?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “That’s not it. Senior Xiao Hai, I want to ask you a question.”

Xiao Hai nodded slightly, indicating for Qin Yu to say.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “What is the reason for the coldness of the northern lands?”

A trace of surprise flashed across Xiao Hai’s face. It was obvious that he did not expect Qin Yu to ask this question.

“In fact, I’m not too sure.”Xiao Hai was silent for a moment, then shook his head and said.

“The northern lands has been frozen for more than ten thousand years, but no one knows what the reason is,”Xiao Hai said.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “This cold air contains a trace of dark energy. Do you think... could there be something of extreme yin buried in the northern land? Or, is the northern land an ancient battlefield?”

“It’s very possible...”

At this moment, Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s voice was heard.
