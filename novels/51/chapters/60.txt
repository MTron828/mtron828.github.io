Chapter 61: Appointment with Miss Yan Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Upon hearing this, Lincheng’s expression immediately changed!

He knew very well that Qi Yang wasn’t bribed, but the difference in strength was too great!

Qin Yu’s strength was something that even Lincheng couldn’t rival!

“You’re too big for your britches. Do you think you’re a match for my father?” Before Lincheng could say anything, Lin Wan had already started chattering at the side.

Qin Yu ignored Lin Wan. Instead, he looked coldly at Lincheng and said, “Mr. Lin, please.”

Lincheng took a deep breath and said with a shameless smile, “Even if you want to fight, you have to fight Mr. Zheng. Where does a disciple like you get the right to do that?”

“If you don’t have the guts, just say you don’t have the guts. I won’t beat you up then,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Hearing this, Lin Wan shouted again, “Gee, you’re so full of yourself. Who do you think you are?”

Then, Lin Wan shouted at Lincheng, “Dad, teach him a lesson and take revenge for me. Break his legs!”

Lin Wan was forcing Lincheng into a dead end!

At this moment, Lincheng really wanted Lin Wan to shut up!

“Mr. Lin, Miss Lin is right. Teach this cocky guy a lesson,” the others also shouted.

“Yes, Mr. Lin, just think of it as educating the younger generation.”

“Mr. Lin, beat him up!”

Countless people jeered, making it difficult for Lincheng to back down.

If he went on stage, he would definitely lose to Qin Yu today.

But if he didn’t go on stage, the Lin Family Martial Arts School’s reputation would be ruined.

“My... my stomach isn’t feeling well,” Lincheng said shamelessly.

Qin Yu sneered while saying, “Mr. Lin, I’m afraid you don’t know that I’m also a doctor. The Soul Nourishment Pill that is popular in Jiangcheng was produced by me.”

“I can testify,” Lance quickly said.

Lincheng gritted his teeth. Just as he was about to find another excuse, Qin Yu took a step forward and said, “It seems that you really don’t have the guts to. Are you worthy of being called the number one martial artist in Jiangcheng?”

“Kid, don’t get too cocky!” Lincheng’s tone contained some anger.

He roared and then raised his feet to walk towards the stage. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Don’t think that I’m really afraid of you?! I just don’t want to hurt you,” Lincheng said with a cold expression.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said coldly, “People like you really disgust me. Your daughter said that she would break my legs. I’m also a reasonable person. I’ll only break both of your legs. I definitely won’t kill you.”

Lincheng’s expression changed drastically! Just as he was about to speak, Qin Yu had already walked over!

Qin Yu’s speed was extremely fast. The gust of wind from his fist was terrifying. Lincheng was alarmed!

Qin Yu’s strength was far beyond his imagination!

“Oh no!” Lincheng was alarmed and hurriedly retreated.

However, Qin Yu didn’t give him a chance. In an instant, he arrived beside Lincheng and kicked Lincheng’s calf.

With a crisp crack, Lincheng’s calf was bent!

“Ah!!” Lincheng couldn’t help but scream due to the intense pain!

Qin Yu didn’t stop there. He raised his foot again and kicked another calf.

With another crisp crack, Lincheng’s legs bent backward in a strange arc!

Without the support of his legs, Lincheng directly knelt on the ground!

“Alright, I’ve broken both of your legs. We’re even now,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Lincheng, his face distorted from the pain, clasped his legs!

Beads of sweat dripped down his forehead and he seemed to be in extreme anguish!

The venue was silent.

After a short period of silence, there was an uproar!

“How is this possible? Mr. Lin didn’t even have the strength to fight back?”

“The number one martial artist in Jiangcheng lost just like that?”

“D*mn, this young man called Qin Yu... is actually that impressive?”

“So... Mr. Zheng didn’t bribe Qi Yang at all?”

“No wonder he was favored by the Yan family...”

Lincheng’s expression was extremely unsightly. He wished he could find a hole to hide in!

If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have offended Qin Yu!

“Dad, Dad, are you alright?!” Lin Wan hurriedly ran in front of Lincheng.

She raised her head and glared at Qin Yu fiercely. “You’re so ruthless!”

“He brought it on himself,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“You, his daughter, also have to bear some of the responsibility.”

After Qin Yu said this, he turned his head and walked off the stage.

“Call an ambulance...” Lincheng used all his strength to say these words.

“Yes, yes, call an ambulance!” Lin Wan took out her phone in a panic.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu had already left the stadium with Zheng Mingshuo and the others.

In the car that was heading back, Mr. Zheng couldn’t help but cup his hands and say, “Mr. Qin, thank you for your help. I will definitely repay you!”

After saying that, Zheng Mingshuo looked at his disciple beside him and said, “From today onwards, the Zheng Family Martial Arts School will take out 10% of the profits and gift it to Mr. Qin.”

Upon hearing Zheng Mingshuo’s words, Qin Yu was deeply astonished.

He waved his hand and said, “Mr. Zheng, there’s no need. You’ve already given me a ginseng.”

“No, that ginseng is only for Mr. Qin to help,” Zheng Mingshuo said somewhat stubbornly.

“Mr. Qin’s actions today will bring the Zheng Family Martial Arts School a very high increase in profits. You deserve 10% of the profits,” Zheng Mingshuo said sincerely.

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t refuse.

They returned to Dragon Paradise.

“Mr. Qin, if you have time tonight, I’d like to treat you to a meal,” Zheng Mingshuo said.

Just as Qin Yu was about to agree, his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu hurriedly walked to the side and picked up the phone.

“Miss Yan.” Qin Yu’s tone carried a hint of gentle mirth.

“Doctor Qin, what are you doing?” Yan Ruoxue asked playfully.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Nothing, I’m just idling at home.”

“Then... accompany me to a dance party tonight? I need a companion,” Yan Ruoxue said.

Qin Yu hadn’t seen Yan Ruoxue for a few days, and he missed her immensely.

Therefore, Qin Yu agreed without thinking.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu turned around and walked back to Zheng Mingshuo’s side.

“Mr. Zheng, I’m afraid I don’t have time tonight,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Mr. Qin... Do you have an appointment?” Zheng Mingshuo asked tentatively.

Before Qin Yu said anything, Yao Qing, who was at the side, teased, “Seeing how he’s smiling so happily, it must be his appointment with Miss Yan.”

“Screw you.” Qin Yu kicked Yao Qing’s butt.

Zheng Mingshuo also had a look of sudden realization. He cupped his hands and said, “Then I won’t disturb you, Mr. Qin.”
