Chapter 2647: Meeting the Demon Sealing Valley Disciples Again

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Demonic Qi Fist!”

The demonic qi surged again as the Evil Buddha’s demon shadow launched another punch.

The enormous Demonic Qi Fist came crashing towards Qin Yu’s location. If it weren’t for Qin Yu’s constant vigilance with the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he would have been directly hit by this punch.

“D*mn it! This guy must have also gained power from Wu Tian!”

Seeing the Evil Buddha inexplicably attacking him, Qin Yu’s expression turned incredibly grim.

Whoosh!

With eighty percent of its power, the Sun Chaing Bow was swiftly drawn, and an energy arrow promptly responded.

The demonic phantom extended its massive palm, igniting sparks within its grasp.

As the demon clenched its fist, the flames were instantly snuffed out.

“Junior Sister Jingxin, Junior Sister Ling’er, follow my lead. We can’t afford to delay any longer. ”

The white-robed woman spoke icily.

“Yes, Senior Sister Zi Nia!”

The two petite women behind her replied in unison.

Zi Xia wielded her Dao sword, its movements synchronized with hers.

Ling Bo!

As she stepped into the air, the sword thrust forward. A surge of power emanated from it.

Suddenly, flames erupted fiercely from the sword, and a scorching internal qi rushed forth with the wind.

Qin Yu felt the temperature in the air sharply rise.

“What terrifying fire. Just a trace of it on the Dao sword possesses such formidable power!”

Qin Yu’s complexion changed drastically. This seemed somewhat akin to Ju Wuwei’s Wood Burning Blade Technique, yet far more potent.

“Samadhi True Fire! Join me in vanquishing this demon!” Zi Xia’s voice was stern.

The two women behind her also launched their attacks.

The three assaults landed almost simultaneously on the Evil Buddha. The demon behind it revealed a ferocious grin.

“Dharma Realm!”

Simultaneously, the Evil Buddha extended three arms, clashing with the three attacks.

Boom!

The tremendous force sent all three flying. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Annihilation!

As Zi Xia flicked her fingers, the Samadhi True Fire surged up the demon’s arm the instant it was sent flying, fiercely igniting within the demon’s Dharma Realm.

As if sensing the overwhelming demonic qi, the Samadhi True Fire surged the moment it entered the demon’s body.

The intense heat wave forced Qin Yu, standing at a distance, to take several steps back. Jiang Feng and Su Su, behind him, had already retreated even further.

“What terrifying power. The Demon Sealing Valley is truly formidable. This level of power has already reached the True Consciousness Realm. If I were hit by this Samadhi True Fire, I doubt I’d have any bones left.”

Jiang Feng’s face turned pale. Having just faced Gu Tian, now encountering Zi Xia was beyond his expectations.

“These few are all inner sect disciples. They should be considered top-notch in the sect,” Su Su said, trying to comfort herself.

“What troublesome Doaist true fire. It’s a little tricky to extinguish it with my current strength.” The Evil Buddha frowned slightly. The demon behind him tried a few times but was unable to extinguish the flames.

At this moment, his skin began to turn red, as if that power had been transmitted to his body.

Suddenly, he revealed a strange smile.

“Since the Buddha wants me to suffer this pain, it must be that this pain will allow us to find something. How can I enjoy such a good thing alone?”

He twirled the prayer beads in his hand, and the Adam’s apple at his throat kept moving.

As a prayer bead fell to the ground, Qin Yu and everyone else seemed to hear a drop of dew falling on the calm surface of the lake.

Even in such a terrifying heat wave, almost everyone suddenly felt a strange feeling of a tide rushing towards them.

It was as if they were facing the coast. The black tide was approaching, and everyone was standing in the black tide that was below their knees.

“Blessing the common people,” the Evil Buddha softly said four words.

A strange power surged from the black tide to everyone’s bodies. In an instant, the burning Samadhi True Fire burned everyone’s bodies.

An intense pain instantly hit Qin Yu.

“Not good, what kind of power is this!”

In less than five seconds, Qin Yu could feel his skin burning even though he had used all his strength. He tried his best to use his Saint Power to heal his injuries and resist the destructive power of the Doaist Fire.

“Since it can’t be avoided, then let all living beings enjoy this Samadhi True Fire with me!” the Evil Buddha smiled. When he saw Zi Xia’s face turn pale, he knew that he had won.

Retract!

Zi Xia looked at the people writhing in pain and gritted her teeth as she roared. “Senior Sister, don’t! The Samadhi True Fire can’t be retracted before it burns the evil. Even Senior Sister can’t resist this True Fire!” Jing Xin grabbed the ground with both hands. When she saw Zi Xia’s actions, she suddenly screamed in fear.

“Junior Sister, bring them to Master. We must stop Gu Yi’s plan,” Zi Xia said calmly.

The Samadhi True Fire suddenly left their bodies. The scorching flames rolled up and formed a sea of fire in the air. Then, the Samadhi True Fire entered her body.

In an instant, a terrifying flame ignited on her body. As the flame burned, her internal qi quickly declined.

“There are so many living beings. If we don’t save our precious lives, how can we save more people?” the Evil Buddha shook his head.

“People like you won’t understand,” Zi Xia said indifferently. The necklace on her neck suddenly broke, and a diamond-shaped door turned into a green door.

Before Qin Yu could react, he was pulled by a terrifying force and pulled into the green door.

The Evil Buddha slowly took a step forward. Zi Xia stood beside the green door, and her eyes were already burning with intense flames. However, Zi Xia did not seem to feel the terrifying pain of burning her bones. She looked at the Evil Buddha indifferently.

“Do you want to receive my last move?” the Evil Buddha revealed a fearful expression, but in the end, he did not continue forward.

Zi Xia smashed the door with a punch. Her hair, flesh, and bones slowly melted.

She did not even leave a trace of ashes behind. This was the terror of the Daoist true fire.

“Senior Sister!”

On the other side of the door, two women suddenly knelt. They looked in the direction of Zi Xia with tears in their eyes, unable to calm down for a long time.

The people behind had complicated expressions.

Even Qin Yu felt a lump in his throat at this moment.

They belonged to two different worlds, so why did this woman sacrifice her life to save them?

If they didn’t care about them, with their strength, perhaps the three of them could retreat completely.

Qin Yu had always felt that this place was separate from them, but at this moment, he felt that his thoughts might be wrong. These natives might be more like humans than some people..
