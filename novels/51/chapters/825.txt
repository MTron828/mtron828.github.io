Chapter 826: The Legend of the Masked Woman

According to this description, the masked woman was clearly recorded.

Qin Yu immediately looked down.

He saw a large row of densely written paragraphs below, which were all filled with rumors about the masked woman.

According to the records in this book, the masked woman had suddenly appeared 5,000 years ago and killed countless people.

Five thousand years ago... that should be the first time she successfully reincarnated, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Because Qin Yu had seen the masked woman in the Immortal Slaying Sect. At that time, she had already exterminated the entire sect of the Immortal Slaying Sect, and that time was ten thousand years ago.

Qin Yu continued reading and read the entire article.

After reading it, he found out that this masked woman had indeed killed countless people five thousand years ago!

There were sect leaders who had been massacred just because they had looked at her twice. There were thousands of disciples in the sect, and not a single one was left.

There were even people who had been killed just because they had been talking behind her back.

The men, women, children, parents, and family members around her were all killed by her.

“She killed her father when she was eight, her mother when she was twelve, and the entire Zhengyang Sect when she was fifteen

“Her father was a righteous man from a famous sect, and his strength was unparalleled. He was a Nascent Soul Stage patriarch.

“Her mother was an alchemist, and her name was known throughout the world. Her body was shattered by a single palm strike.

“She wielded a purple sword at the age of eighteen, and with a single strike, she flattened Qingyu Mansion. The bodies of tens of thousands of people were destroyed, and blood flowed like a river

“She was nineteen... twenty...”

It was a record of the masked woman’s actions every year.

She had become the public enemy of the world. The major sects had once used all their strength to resurrect a top-tier elder to kill the masked woman.

However, the final result wasn’t ideal. The elder had never returned. He was killed in the sky and his blood spilled all over the sky.

Qin Yu read with fear and trepidation.

She had killed a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator at the age of eight?

The Nascent Soul Stage was the equivalent of a Martial Saint!

According to this record, the masked woman had killed at least 100,000 people, and they were all from reputable sects. They were all well-known in the martial world.

However, what Qin Yu didn’t understand the most was why she would kill the parents, who had given birth to her and raised her?

As he continued reading, he saw that the book recorded that this person had a habit of killing people. It was all based on her preferences, and everyone could become a target.

The record came to a complete end.

Qin Yu continued reading. Next, every other year, the masked woman would reappear. However, she was unable to mature and died halfway through.

In this way, the masked woman only successfully reincarnated once.

“In this life, this is her second successful reincarnation.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but have an ugly expression.

If what was recorded in this book was true, then Xiao Yu would most likely become a disaster in the future! A demon who could kill people as easily as a blade!

“Now that she has entered the Martial Saint realm and found the mask, I’m afraid no one can stop her growth.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little regretful. If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have let her leave.

At the very least, he shouldn’t have brought her onto the path of cultivation!

If it weren’t for him, Xiao Yu wouldn’t have awakened her memories at all!

Qin Yu put the book away, his face filled with worry.

The records in the Scripture Pavilion weren’t very detailed, but between the lines, there was a hint of fear.

One had to know that the records in the book were from five thousand years ago! At that time, a Martial Saint was nothing, and there were countless top cultivators.

Even so, no one could do anything to her, let alone in the current era?

“If there’s a chance, I have to think of a way to stop her.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

She was released by him, so he naturally had to bear the corresponding responsibility.

Qin Yu didn’t continue reading. Although there were many characters recorded in this book, Qin Yu didn’t know them at all, so there was no point in reading.

Two days had already passed, and there were only a few days left until the third day.

After going downstairs, everyone was still immersed in their spells.

However, most of the spells they chose were Earth Rank spells.

In the following time, Qin Yu randomly picked a few spells that suited him and started to comprehend them.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Xia Hang also appeared at the door on time.

“Everyone, it’s time. Follow me out,” Xia Hang said.

The group didn’t waste any time and followed Xia Hang out of the Scripture Pavilion.

This trip to the Scripture Pavilion was quite rewarding for Qin Yu.

Not to mention the two Divine Rank spells, just these two pieces of information were worth it.

After walking out of the Scripture Pavilion, Zhuang Teng and Qin Yu chatted, “Brother Qin, I have to say, your harvest this trip should be the biggest. Two Divine Rank spells, how enviable.”

Qin Yu smiled. “I was just lucky.”

At this point, Qin Yu changed the topic and asked, “By the way, have you heard of the rumors about the Guardian?”

“Guardian?” Zhuang Teng was at a loss. Obviously, he didn’t know anything about this.

“I’ve heard of it.” At this moment, Yao Meng walked over from the side.

Qin Yu glanced at her and greeted, “Miss Yao.”

Yao Meng smiled and said, “Brother Qin, you’re talking about the agreement between the Martial Saint and the Guardian, right?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu hurriedly nodded.

“What does Miss Yao know?”

Yao Meng smiled and said, “This isn’t a place to talk. Why don’t we go somewhere else?”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

Just as the two of them were about to leave, Teng Hui suddenly walked over from not far away.

He stood beside Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, my uncle asked me to give you a message. He told you not to be too arrogant. In this era, martial arts are nothing. Without the support of capital, everything will be for naught in the end.”

Qin Yu sneered. “Go back and tell your uncle that I don’t want to tangle with him. But if he dares to provoke me, I don’t mind destroying his business empire.”

“Arrogant! Let me tell you, in front of capital, you are just an ant! Don’t be too arrogant!” Teng Hui had a warning look on his face.

After saying this sentence, Teng Hui turned around and was about to leave. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Stop.” At this time, Qin Yu took a step forward and raised his hand to press on his shoulder.

Teng Hui only felt as if there was a huge mountain on his shoulder, and he was unable to move.

“What are you doing?!” Teng Hui asked coldly.

Qin Yu ignored him and asked, “Is there a toilet nearby?”

Xia Hang pointed to a place not far away and said, “The toilet is there.”

Qin Yu grabbed Teng Hui and said, “Follow me.”

Teng Hui seemed to have realized something. A trace of panic flashed across his face and he said anxiously, “What... What are you doing?!”

Qin Yu sneered. “I’ve already forgotten about a nobody like you. Tell me, why did you insist on coming here to provoke me?”

“Today, I’ll treat it as a lesson for you and also as a warning to your uncle Teng Gong. Come with me!”

After saying that, Qin Yu grabbed Teng Hui and turned around to walk towards the toilet.
