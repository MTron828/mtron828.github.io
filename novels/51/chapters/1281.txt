Chapter 1282: Chapter 1,282, the extremely powerful golden wheel 

Qin Yu wasn’t too surprised when he saw the transformation of the Golden Wheel’s body.

As the number one hunter, the golden wheel naturally had more than this ability.

Under the support of the stone transformation technique and the Purple Phoenix Blood, the Golden Wheel’s body became even more ferocious, and its strength was as dense as the sea.

The Golden Wheel’s pupils emitted a strange and murderous glow.

He clenched his fists and walked towards Qin Yu step by step.

Every step was extremely heavy, almost causing the ground to collapse.

The team leader, Jing Bai, and the others all sighed.

Since things had come to this point, it was impossible to stop it.

Between the two of them, one of them would definitely fall.

“Is this your final state?”Qin Yu looked at Jin Lun coldly. The internal Qi on his body was extremely stable, like an ancient well.

Under the stone transformation technique, Jin Lun’s voice had become somewhat muffled.

“I originally didn’t want to take your life, but you forced me to do so,”Jin Lun said coldly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Back then, under the augmentation of the stone transformation technique, I once tore apart a tie Lin elephant with my bare hands.”

Qin Yu sneered, “So?”

“You won’t have a better outcome than tie Lin Elephant!”Jin Lun roared angrily. His fist was like a small mountain, fiercely swinging toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu was not afraid at all. With his divine power, he chose to meet Jin Lun head-on again!

“Boom!”

After the collision, waves of terrifying internal Qi swept out in all directions! Even the air seemed to be fluctuating!

Trees were uprooted, the earth was shaking, and some demon beasts that couldn’t Dodge in time were cut in half! They turned into a pool of blood!

Qin Yu and Jin Lun were still in a stalemate. Half a second later, a violent explosion occurred between the two of them! The two of them took a few steps back!

This couldn’t help but shock everyone!

Even with the support of the stone transformation technique and the Purple Phoenix Blood, Jin Lun still couldn’t gain any benefits?

Jin Lun slowly stood up from the ground. He didn’t seem to have suffered any substantial damage.

On the other side, Qin Yu also walked out from the forest.

His clothes had been torn to shreds, revealing his sturdy body.

“As expected of the Hunter King. He has some ability.”Qin Yu sneered.

Jin Lun shook his stone-like body and said coldly, “This is only the beginning. Don’t be anxious.”

With that, the radiance on his body became thicker. Following that, his strength also became denser.

This was an extremely strange spell that fused his body almost like a divine stone.

Coupled with the support of the Purple Phoenix Blood, Jin Lun’s physical body was extremely powerful at this moment. It could be said that he was invincible!

“Whoosh!”

In the blink of an eye, Jin Lun arrived in front of Qin Yu. Both parties once again engaged in close combat.

Jin Lun’s speed was extremely fast. His huge body did not slow him down.

Qin Yu’s expression did not change as he continued to receive Jin Lun’s fist in an orderly manner.

It had to be said that Jin Lun’s every punch was extremely powerful, and every time the two of them collided, space seemed to collapse.

The two of them became faster and faster, and in the end, only the sound of “Bang Bang Bang”could be heard.

The surrounding people watched with their mouths agape. This kind of battle that involved the use of physical bodies was indeed shocking.

At this moment, Jin Lun’s body could be said to be impregnable. Qin Yu’s fists had hit him many times, but even the gray stones on his body could not be broken.

On the other hand, Jin Lun’s fists were incomparably heavy. Even though Qin Yu’s body was indestructible, the powerful impact force still forced Qin Yu back again and again.

Qin Yu’s body was continuously sent flying. God knows how many mountains and forests were smashed into pieces. It was a miserable sight.

However, what was surprising was that every time Qin Yu stood up, his body was still intact and full of fighting spirit!

This undoubtedly made the golden wheel extremely furious. He became even more furious, and the Purple Phoenix Blood on his body also began to boil. The gray stone covering his body also began to tremble!

“As expected of the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm.”Qin Yu raised his head and stared at the enormous golden wheel, and couldn’t help but think to himself.

At this moment, Qin Yu missed the time when he had spirit energy even more.

If he could use the cosmic form, it would be no problem for him to destroy this golden wheel.

“Bang!”

Another collision occurred. This time, Qin Yu was sent flying nearly a hundred meters, splitting a large mountain forest into two.

The power of the golden wheel was simply too powerful. Even though Qin Yu’s body was incomparably fierce, he still felt quite uncomfortable under such a collision.

I Can’t wait any longer, Qin Yu thought to himself.

If this continued, even if he didn’t die, he would be tortured to death by the golden wheel.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and prepared to use the ‘Dou’character.

But at this moment, the Golden Wheel’s body suddenly changed strangely.

It was as if he had turned into a huge stone ball, and his human form could no longer be seen!

This stone ball was extremely huge, and it flickered with the light brought by the Purple Phoenix Blood.

At a glance, it looked like a meteorite that had descended from the sky!

“Rumble...”

Large areas of the ground were affected and began to collapse.

The surrounding team leaders and others who were watching all retreated.

They knew that this was the Golden Wheel’s trump card spell, and it was extremely powerful.

Qin Yu’s face also revealed a trace of fear.

He did not dare to be negligent any longer, and directly opened the fighting word formula to the second level, preparing to receive the Golden Wheel’s trump card spell!

“Boom!”

The stone ball brought with it a dark radiance as it came from the sky!

Qin Yu roared furiously. Divine power surged all over his body. He raised both of his hands and welcomed the stone ball!

“Boom!”

The collision between the two sides caused a huge earthquake!

In almost an instant, the ground under Qin Yu’s feet began to crumble.

More than half of his body was buried into the ground!

The stone ball was still exerting its terrifying power. In the next second, the stone ball actually started to spin at an extremely fast speed!

Qin Yu’s hands were instantly unable to grab onto the stone ball. The friction between his palms and the stone ball actually brought about waves of extremely intense sparks!

The stone ball spun faster and faster. Finally, Qin Yu’s powerful physical body was unable to withstand it any longer.

The skin on his palms was torn apart, and traces of fresh blood seeped out!

After all, he was only at the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm. Furthermore, he had used the stone transformation technique and the Purple Phoenix Blood!

Meanwhile, Qin Yu was only at the advanced stage of the Martial Saint Realm. He had not even stepped into the Almighty Realm!

If everyone knew about Qin Yu’s realm, they would probably want to die!

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu’s palm had been worn away. It was a bloody mess, and even his ghastly white bones were exposed!

“Go to hell!”

The stone ball emitted the cold voice of the golden wheel. Following that, an even more terrifying power was emitted from the stone ball!

“Level five of the battle character Incantation!”

Qin Yu roared and directly activated the battle character incantation to the last level!

In an instant, the divine power in Qin Yu’s body instantly skyrocketed!
