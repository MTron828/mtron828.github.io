Alester’s family had also obtained this incomplete Investiture of Gods. From the current situation, the Situ family’s use of the Investiture of Gods should be ahead of them.

However, Divine Doctor Lu felt a sense of fear when he saw how much the family had surpassed the use of the Investiture of Gods.

“I will never give up!”

Fatty Situ revealed a determined expression.

“Situ family bestowed you with all your magical artifacts. Your power and everything you have belongs to the Situ family as well. Who are you without the family?”

Situ Qianxun said indifferently.

“You’re right. I’m trash without the Situ family. However, there are no ifs in this world. I’ll fight you to the death with this dagger. I want to fight for the

Situ family’s patriarch!”

Fatty Situ was expressionless. He held the dagger with one hand.

He aimed it at Situ Qianxun.

A huge energy seemed to have awakened on the Treasure Continent.

The sky of the entire continent suddenly changed. Countless dark clouds slowly gathered as if they were waiting for something.

As the two dark clouds intersected, a seven-colored multicolored light slowly shone on the Treasure Continent.

Ever since the Situ family was passed down, a commandment was written in the family tree.

Any direct descendant of the Situ family had the right to initiate a life-and-death battle against the patriarch and seize the position.

All the power of the family’s outsiders could not be involved.

This commandment was to prevent the Situ family’s patriarch from becoming fatuous and degenerate.

Moreover, this rule was set by the first family. Every subsequent family head was perfecting this rule. “Accept!”

Situ Qianxun said.

The dark clouds in the sky completely dissipated.

Everyone had lost the strength to move. Not only Divine Doctor Lu but also Ye Kai and the many top-notch experts studying the incomplete Investiture of Gods.

That power was like air, silently occupying all of their bodies.

Then, the power slowly drifted away. Their body, divine sense, and thoughts were locked.

The peak power of level 14- the power of Heavenly Trapping.

Ye Kai’s sword trembled slightly. But in the next moment, his body could not move. He was like a statue.

In the entire Treasure Continent, only two people could move- Fatty Situ and Situ Qianxun.

Divine Doctor Lu stretched out his hands. His face was filled with disbelief.

No one knew why he had such an expression on his face. Was it Fatty Situ’s challenge or Situ Qianxun’s acceptance?

“Father, why did you accept it so easily?”

Fatty Situ lowered his head and said in a low voice.

He didn’t have outstanding talent, nor did he have the so-called perseverance to endure hardship. He only had a ridiculous and persistent personality.

When he was in the Treasure Repository Pavilion of the Treasure Continent, he even found out that his father gave him the strongest power.

That was why Divine Doctor Lu was so anxious. He did not have any chance of winning.

Therefore, he took out his trump card and gambled with Situ Qianxun with his life.

If Situ Qianxun accepted the challenge, it meant that he would die.

“You can’t understand.”

Situ Qianxun sighed and sympathised with his son who had already sat down dejectedly.

“I was once known as the number one person after Ming Alester, but I didn’t have the chance to enter the place even with so many magical treasures. I had given up, but I didn’t expect you to bring me this Investiture of Gods. This power might give me a chance to fulfill my long-cherished wish.”

“Therefore, you can die now.”

Situ Qianxun pointed.

The seven-colored light instantly disappeared. Everyone immediately resumed their movements.

“What a terrifying power! As expected of the legendary level 14 power.” Ye Kai was silent for a long time. That kind of power was irresistible.

Sword cultivators were not willing to admit defeat on their path of cultivation. No matter what kind of power they had, it was impossible to shake their saber intent.

However, he still felt helpless from the depths of his divine soul facing this power.

In the clouds, an old and young figure stepped on the white clouds and slowly landed.

The old Daoist’s expression was solemn, but the little girl beside him was jumping around and staring curiously at the surroundings. “I didn’t expect the Taoist Priest to come personally.”

Situ Qianxun said silently and bowed slightly.

“I was wandering around nearby, but I didn’t expect to sense the oath I made with Patriarch Qianxun five hundred years ago. The Dao seal has been activated in the Heavenly Treasure Continent, so I came to take a look.”

The old Daoist’s voice was calm and he revealed a smile as he stared at Situ Qianxun.

If Qin Yu was here, he would definitely be shocked to discover that this old Daoist was someone he had seen in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

Moreover, he had previously performed the Ethereal Enlightenment on Qin Yu, allowing him to avoid the Seven Tribulations Sin from Wu Tian.

“Now that I understand the cause and effect, it’s time for me to take back my Dao seal. However, I’m afraid the next tribulation won’t be easy for PatriarchFindd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qianxun. You have to decide as soon as possible.”

The old Daoist took back the seal and left behind a meaningful sentence.

Then, he brought the little girl and left the Treasure Continent.

“That’s not right, Grandpa. They haven’t decided the winner yet. The fat brother isn’t dead. Isn’t this a breach of contract?”

The little girl was curious.

“You’re just a child. What do you know?”

The old Daoist put the little girl on his shoulder. He let her chubby little face stick to him.

“You’re the one who cheats.” The little girl said angrily. “Haha! Grandpa will not cheat. Once a life -and-death agreement is formed, there is no way of turning it around. However, it cannot be considered cheating if we postpone it.”

The old Daoist looked at the slowly approaching dark clouds and shook his head.

Looking down from a height of ten thousand feet, a layer of fog had already surrounded the entire Treasure Continent.

A huge eyeball suddenly appeared from space on the Treasure Continent.

As the eyeball was squeezed out, a destructive force fell.

In the distant Kingdom of Destruction, the entire Sainy Kingdom suddenly let out a roar.

Violent power soared into the sky. This energy crossed space.

Space shattered wherever it reached.

It was as if this Saint Kingdom could not withstand this violent power.

The power of Saint Kingdom shot up into the sky like a volcanic eruption. A

10,000-meter-long bolt of lightning covered the entire Treasure Continent. The destructive, brutal, and bloody lightning of the Saint Kingdom suddenly descended.

Boom!

With a terrifying explosion, countless cracks appeared on the Treasure Continent.

The entire continent was falling rapidly.

The entire Treasure Continent was directly sent ten thousand meters underground under the full attack of the power of Saint Kingdom.

A huge divine tree stretched out from the center of the Treasure Continent..
