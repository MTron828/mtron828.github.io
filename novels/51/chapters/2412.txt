The Ji Family’s Arrival

Qin Yu endured the pain all over his body and rolled his eyes at the man with the mustache.

” What a terrifying Ji family! With the setup of so many years of the Path of Heaven, even the most ancient sects and aristocratic families didn’t notice it. The Evil Eye forged links between the two worlds. It can communicate with the power of the Pah of Heaven of the human race and the power of the ghost realm. It’s really heaven-defying.”

The man of the mustache seemed to have not come back to his senses. His face was still full of shock.

“It’s indeed terrifying. In the end, the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor’s uncontrollable explosive power was only a draw with the sword energy of the Way of Yin and Yang. If Ji Ao were at the Tribulation Transcending Stage, I’m afraid none of us could escape today.”

Qin Yu looked at the ghostly sword emitting a destructive aura and felt a lingering fear.

“It’s hard to say. Once Ji Ao breaks through to the Tribulation Transcending Stage, he’ll definitely be watched closely. The nine great aristocratic families are also scheming against each other. Now that the Golden Path of Heaven has descended, the hidden sects and various powerful itinerant cultivators of the Holy Region will gradually appear.”

The man with the mustache looked at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, I didn’t plan to attack at all. Today, you would have died. However, 1 didn’t expect the prince to have left behind a hidden trick. His final will was hiding in the ashes, causing the backslash of the royal family’s souls. Under the royal family’s guidance, the 30 million soul power of Sky City erupted, and only then did I get the opportunity to use the ominous qi to fight his supreme Five Emperor Coins.

“Without the control of the Five Emperor Coins, Ji Ao couldn’t control the ghostly sword at all. Otherwise, even the Immortal Emperor’s corpse wouldn’t be a threat to him.”

After hearing what the man of mustache had said, Qin Yu had a lingering fear.

They would probably die here today even if it were only the slightest deviation.

The Ji family’s setup had been very stable. With Ji Yuyi and Ji Ao, no one could pose a threat to them as long as the Tribulation Third Level did not appear. And those who had such strength would also be closely monitored by them.

He did not expect Qin Yu to appear in Sky City with the prince’s ashes and seized the Evil Eye instead.

“Ghostly Sword Evil Eye, the Ji family’s treasures, the Yao family’s corpse of the Immortal Emperor, all look good. However, you can’t use the corpse of the Immortal Emperor and the ghostly sword for now. Instead, you’ll attract a lot of lice on your head. You’ve snatched the Ji family’s setup for four or five generations this time. I’m afraid there will be relentless struggles.”

“Come on, the more lice, the less itchiness.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes. He lay on the grass of the Sumeru ring and enjoyed this rare peace.

“I’m making a move. I still have to check the feng shui of a few places.”

With a swoosh, the man with the mustache disappeared from the Sumeru ring.

“Thanks, brother.”

Qin Yu’s lips curled into a smile. The man with the mustache no longer hid himself and left the Sumeru ring directly.

“This is such a good opportunity. Why didn’t you get the ghostly sword? This sword will be of great use to us.”

A person stood beside the man with the mustache and asked softly.

“The karma of this sword doesn’t belong to us. We’ll have a problem if we were to get it.”

A mysterious smile appeared on the face of the man with the mustache.

“The incident this time is indeed strange. I never expected him to be able to obtain the ghostly sword. This brat’s fate is indeed interesting…”

After saying that, the two disappeared.

Qin Yu ate a Green Spirit Fruit to replenish the spiritual energy in his body. After that, he activated the Soul Torment Mind Technique and began to recover the power of the soul.

In the divine sea, traces of venomous parasites were circling unceasingly. No matter how Qin Yu’s soul power attacked, it actually could not be resolved.

Qin Yu frowned deeply. If he failed to clear the poison of the Ji family’s divine sense, it might pose a threat to him at any time.

But even though he used the Soul Torment Mind Technique, he still could not clear the parasites’ venomous poisons.

This seemed to involve another kind of power, and Qin Yu did not understand either.

Qin Yu tried taking out Evil Eye, but he felt a boom in his mind the moment he grabbed the scarecrow’s hilt.

An enormous dark and evil thing surged into his sea of consciousness, and Qin Yu’s divine sense immediately surged with a very irritable qi.

These wills tried to merge into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, and Qin Yu blocked that gloomy internal qi.

If these things were to fuse into his soul, he would probably be caught in an endless slaughtering. These things would fundamentally affect a person’s consciousness.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu was just about to put down the ghostly sword, but it stuck to his hand like a maggot.

The power of the ghost realm locked his entire body, and massive negative emotions instantly enveloped him. This sword was trying to control Qin Yu and make him a slaughter servant!

“F*ck, get lost! A mere dead sword wants to control me!”

Qin Yu was furious. The boundless evil power enveloped him, and his Sea of Soul also built a line of defense to resist this power. If it weren’t for the fact that his soul was tremendously strong, he would have been controlled by this sword in an instant.

Heart of Thunder!

With a thought, a tremendously thunderous sound rang out from his body.

A massive power of thunder and lightning suddenly surged on his body. Then, the Heart of Thunder in his sea of consciousness suddenly bloomed with the Ninth Heaven Divine Thunder.

Lightning was inherently the nemesis of evil things.

The moment the Ninth Heaven Divine Lightning exploded, the Evil Eye’s power retreated continuously.

Qin Yu took this opportunity to take up the ghostly sword and slashed out fiercely.

“Boom!”

The entire Sumeru ring suddenly turned upside down, and vengeful spirits soared into the sky. The space where the Sumeru ring came into contact with the sword energy of the ghostly sword suddenly exploded, and the sword energy rushed into the endless void.

However, because Qin Yu did not use any chaotic qi, this sword energy soon disappeared.

With the help of Heart of Thunder, he could probably strike out a slash.

However, this Evil Eye was a double-edged sword. Every time he used it, it would have a huge impact on his divine sense.

Just like Buddhism’s enlightenment, even a person who had gone crazy from killing would become a Buddha after being enlightened over time.

“Qin Yu, try not to use this d*mn thing. It’s too f*cking scary.”

When he slashed out the sword just now, everyone in the Sumeru ring fell into a boundless illusion.

“If this Evil Eye is slashed out using chaotic qi, its greatest strength can reach the Tribulation Third Level Soul Statue Reaching the Bottom. However, this ghostly sword can’t be used unless it’s absolutely necessary.”

Qin Yu frowned.

To control Evil Eye, firstly, he had to have a deeper understanding of the power of thunder and lightning. Secondly, he had to find a treasure like the Five Emperor Coins that could restrain evil.

“Let’s go back to Thunder Courtyard first.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

He adjusted his condition to the best. However, many people in the Holy Region had broken through between now and when he went to Sky City. He had to be careful now.

With a thought, he controlled the Sumeru ring to shuttle through space and swiftly rushed toward Thunder Courtyard. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In less than half a day, they were already close to Thunder Courtyard.

A divine thought suddenly locked onto Qin Yu precisely. Regardless of whether he was traveling through the void or above the Holy Region, that divine thought was like a maggot in the bone, hard to brush away..
