Chapter 1744: No… Don’t!

Yong Ji seemed to be performing some terrifying spell!

Just raising his hand was enough to make people feel a terrifying fear. This seemed to be Yong Ji’s trump card!

“Who is not a… A heaven’s favorite!”

Yong Ji’s roar shook the sky as he pushed out a galaxy with his palm!

!!

No one knew what kind of terrifying spell technique this was, but Yong Ji’s roar seemed to have vented all the grievances he had suffered for many years!

This was an extremely terrifying power, and it also relied on the evolution of the Great Dao.

Any kind of evolution was based on the world. The galaxy that Yong Ji had evolved was even more terrifying to the extreme!

Even Qin Yu was shocked.

Yong Ji’s spell technique was clearly beyond Qin Yu’s imagination!

At a closer look, the galaxies seemed to be the fusion of spiritual energy and dao techniques!

The things flowing in the galaxy were the best in the world!

“Ah!” Yong Ji’s hoarse roar shocked everyone!

Even Wen Wanchong and Yuan Xiu could not help but look over.

Yuan Xiu squinted his eyes in surprise.

His opinion of Yong Ji also changed at this moment.

“Go to hell!”

Yong Ji held the galaxy in his hand and pressed down heavily!

The entire world seemed to be collapsing. No one dared to ignore such a terrifying spell technique!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He immediately took out the iron rod and fused all his strength with the iron rod. At this moment, the iron rod had become Qin Yu’s left and right arms!

His entire body became extremely huge, and his cosmic form also appeared at this moment!

With the support of the cosmic form, Qin Yu held the iron rod and smashed it toward the galaxy!

It was like a collision between two planets. Everything around them disappeared, turning into a vast expanse of white!

Nothing could withstand the terrifying collision!

Qin Yu’s iron rod streaked across the sky and smashed toward the galaxy!

At this moment, the iron rod was like a long sword, a long sword that wanted to break the water!

The galaxy entered it, and its hidden power was revealed at this moment.

Tens of thousands of stars seemed to have exploded in the galaxy. An extremely terrifying force surged out, turning everything around it into dust!

Clang! Clang!

Qin Yu’s wrist could no longer withstand the terrifying force. The iron rod flew straight out and stabbed into the city wall of Divine Capital City!

Qin Yu’s body was smashed into the ground, and blood kept flowing out!

Looking at Yong Ji, he stood above the galaxy like a god who controlled the universe!

At this moment, everyone finally remembered that Yong Ji was also a top existence in Nanzhou!

“Hahahahaha!” Yong Ji laughed out loud, as if he was venting out the grievances he had suffered for years! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

On the ground, the cosmic form had disappeared. Qin Yu was curled up on the ground, looking terrible.

His body was on the verge of shattering, revealing his white bones.

Fresh blood dyed the ground red, and the golden light began to dissipate.

“Detestable…” Qin Yu’s eyes were wide open, and the intense pain all over his body made him almost unable to stand up!

“It seems like I have to end this battle as soon as possible.” Yuan Xiu sneered.

After he finished speaking, the aura on his body began to surge, and the powerful aura immediately swept out!

Yuan Xiu also became serious! He was going to kill Qu Zhu and Wen Wanchong!

Yuan Xiu raised both his hands in the face of the two people who were charging at him. Each of his hands displayed a terrifying spell!

Just as the two of them were approaching, Yuan Xiu suddenly opened his eyes. The radiance on his palm was extremely dazzling as he ruthlessly slapped the two of them!

“Boom!”

Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu were like kites with broken strings, and they were sent flying!

This was a powerful technique of Yuan Xiu. Not only did he have a realm that could crush the two of them, but he also had the inheritance of the Immortal Slaying Sect!

Under this spell, Wen Wanchong was directly beaten back to his original form, and the Eight Devil Transformation disappeared without a trace.

On the other hand, Qu Zhu’s situation wasn’t any better. He was lying on the ground, and even getting up was extremely difficult.

“I’m finished.”

Qin Yu and the other two were all defeated.

It seemed that Nanzhou was about to fall.

Everyone was in despair. The three people who represented the peak of Nanzhou had been defeated so quickly and thoroughly!

“Detestable…”

On the ground, Qin Yu was struggling desperately to get up. However, at this moment, Yong Ji’s aura pressed down on him and he was pressed to the ground again.

“Qin Yu, no one can save you this time.” Yong Ji said coldly.

Blood gushed out of Qin Yu’s mouth continuously. He gritted his teeth and turned to look in the direction of Yuan Xiu, his eyes filled with unwillingness.

Yuan Xiu lifted the two of them up, his eyes full of undisguisable mockery.

“You guys dare to stop me?” Yuan Xiu said sarcastically.

“What qualifications do you have to stop me?”

After saying that, Yuan Xiu ruthlessly smashed the two of them into the ground!

Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu’s aura instantly became even more dispirited!

“Detestable…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth, anger filling his chest.

However, Yong Ji also exerted his strength, almost crushing Qin Yu’s head!

“Yuan Xiu, I’ll f*ck your mother…”

Wen Wanchong spat out a few words with great difficulty.

Yuan Xiu sneered. He looked at Wen Wanchong, who was on the verge of death, and said, “I heard you’re a tough guy. Fine, I’ll give you a chance today.”

“If you’re willing to kneel and beg me, I can spare your life.”

“I’ll.. f*cking be spared…” Wen Wanchong cursed. Ever since he was born, he had never lowered his head to anyone, let alone Yuan Xiu.

“If you don’t beg for mercy, you’ll die,” Yuan Xiu raised his eyebrows.

“Splat!”

Wen Wanchong spat on Yuan Xiu’s face without hesitation.

Before Yuan Xiu could get angry, Wen Wanchong suddenly hugged him!

His hands were like chains, tightly binding Yuan Xiu. He stuck to Yuan Xiu like a piece of plaster.

“No… Don’t!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu instantly understood what Wen Wanchong was trying to do!

He was going to self-destruct! He had used self-destruction to kill Yuan Xiu!

Of course, Yuan Xiu had also figured out Wen Wanchong’s intention. His face turned cold, and a terrifying aura burst out.

Two big hands stretched out from his back and tore Wen Wanchong off, then he fell to the ground!

“You ungrateful thing!” Yuan Xiu’s voice was filled with extreme anger!

Clearly, Wen Wanchong’s action had thoroughly enraged Yuan Xiu!

“If that’s the case, then you should just die.” Yuan Xiu’s palm emitted a terrifying radiance, aiming at Wen Wanchong’s head.

Wen Wanchong had lost all ability to fight back after being severely injured.

He lay on the ground, unable to move.

“No… Don’t!” Qin Yu’s pupils dilated, and she was in extreme pain!

At this moment, Qin Yu swallowed the Reversion Void Pill!
