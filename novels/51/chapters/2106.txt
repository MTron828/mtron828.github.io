2107 Alchemist Association

“Accompany me for a walk,” Qin Yu said.

“Okay.” Jue Wu nodded and accompanied Qin Yu out of the inn.

This city was called Quiet Wind City. Contrary to its name, the city was bustling with noise and vibrant with activity.

There was a large trading market in the center of the city, which was the most prosperous place in the city. Every day, numerous merchants and adventurers were trading all kinds of rare treasures and resources there.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu came to this trading market. Shuttling among the many stalls, they were looking for things that might be useful.

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s gaze lingered on a stall. He walked over and looked at a strange stone on the stall.

The stone was about the size of a fist and light yellow in color. There were some strange patterns on its surface.

“This is…” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with surprise.

“This is a soul stone,” seeing Qin Yu’s expression, the stall owner immediately explained. His eyes were full of eagerness. “It’s a precious soul stone. It can help people restore their primordial spirit. It’s an excellent support tool for cultivators like you guys.”

Qin Yu was interested. He happened to need something like this to help him restore his primordial spirit.

“How much is it?” Qin Yu asked.

The stall owner smiled and revealed a cunning expression. “Young hero, it’s a rare soul stone. I’m asking for one million spirit coins.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. This price was clearly inflated. He was about to open his mouth to bargain when Jue Wu, beside him, impatiently took out one million spirit coins and threw them to the stall owner.

“Here you go,” Jue Wu said.

Qin Yu smiled helplessly. He knew Jue Wu was worried about his injury. Thus she was in a hurry to buy this soul stone.

After paying, Qin Yu and Jue Wu prepared to leave. But at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

“Wait, this price doesn’t seem right.”

It was the voice of a middle-aged man. Looking at the soul stone in Qin Yu’s hand, a strange look flashed in his eyes.

“Brother, what did you see?” Qin Yu looked at the middle-aged man with his eyes full of doubt.

The middle-aged man walked over and sized up the soul stone in Qin Yu’s hand seriously. Then, he slowly opened his mouth and said, “This soul stone should be worth more than one million spirit coins.”

When Qin Yu and Jue Wu heard this, they were very surprised. They did not expect the value of this soul stone to be higher than they had imagined.

“How did you know?” Qin Yu asked.

He placed the tool on the soul stone and observed it carefully for a while before saying, “This soul stone isn’t an ordinary soul stone. It contains tremendously powerful spiritual power. Such a treasure can be sold for at least five million spirit coins in the market.”

When Qin Yu and Jue Wu heard this price, they were tremendously shocked. They did not expect to buy such a valuable treasure at such a cheap price.

The stall owner was also shocked. He obviously did not expect this soul stone, which he thought was only worth one million spirit coins, to be worth five million spirit coins.

Looking at the stall owner’s shocked expression, the middle-aged man smiled. Then he said to Qin Yu and Jue Wu, “Congratulations, you guys have scored a big bargain this time!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the mysterious middle-aged man in front of him and said in a low voice, “May I know your name?”

The middle-aged man replied indifferently, “My name is Hu Kai, and I’m from the Artifact Refining Guild.”

“As expected,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu had heard a little bit about the Artifact Refining Guild. It was an organization that was as famous as the Alchemist Association. However, it was extremely difficult to enter the Artifact Refining Guild. Ordinary people could only go to Divine Fortuity City. They were not qualified to go to the Artifact Refining Guild to search for treasures.

“You should be Qin Yu, who has been in the limelight recently,” Hu Kai suddenly said.

Qin Yu’s brows instantly furrowed even tighter, and he had a sense of unease in his heart.

“You’re Qin Yu? You’re the famous Qin Yu?” When the stall owner heard this, he was incomparably excited!

He ran to Qin Yu and said excitedly, “Mr. Qin defeated the Yao family’s Holy Son in one go and left in a carefree manner. You’re the role model of our generation. I didn’t expect to see the famous Qin Yu here today!”

Qin Yu was slightly embarrassed. He did not expect his reputation to have reached such a level.

The stall owner at the side chattered non-stop, but Qin Yu looked at Hu Kai with apprehension.

“Mr. Qin, you don’t have to worry about the nine great aristocratic families. It has nothing to do with us,” Hu Kai seemed to have seen through the doubt in Qin Yu’s heart and immediately smiled and said.

“May I know why Senior has come here?” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“I want to take you to see someone,” Hu Kai put his hands behind his back, smiled, and said.”

“To see someone?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu and Jue Wu immediately became extremely vigilant.

Jue Wu stepped forward and shielded Qin Yu behind her.

“Mr. Qin, don’t worry. You know this person. He’s from the Alchemist Association,” Hu Kai continued.

Qin Yu was stunned.

Alchemist Association? Could it be Pavilion Master?

Qin Yu was instantly excited! The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was a benefactor to Qin Yu. It was just that he never had the chance to meet her because ordinary cultivators were not qualified to enter!

But now, this middle-aged man in front of him claimed to want to bring Qin Yu to the Alchemist Association. How could he not be excited?

“Why should we believe you?” Jue Wu’s words reminded Qin Yu.

Qin Yu came to his senses. He looked at Hu Kai in front of him, frowned, and said, “That’s right. Why should I believe you?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Hahaha!” Hu Kai couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Don’t worry, he’s waiting for you nearby, so we don’t have to go far. Of course, you can reject if you don’t want to go.”

After saying that, Hu Kai turned around and left.

Qin Yu stood behind him and hesitated for a moment. Then he gritted his teeth and quickly chased after him.

“Qin Yu, why do I feel that this fellow doesn’t look like a good person?” Jue Wu whispered beside Qin Yu.

“It’s alright. If it’s really a trap, I can still escape,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Moreover, not many people in the Holy Region know about my relationship with Alchemist Association. Even if they want to set a trap, they don’t have to use the Alchemist Association to attract me.”

Thus Qin Yu and Jue Wu followed behind Hu Kai and walked forward.

After walking for a long time, Hu Kai brought Qin Yu to a rather quiet private courtyard. Although this courtyard was small, the layout was exquisite. Every part of it revealed a peaceful atmosphere.

Bringing Qin Yu and Jue Wu along, Hu Kai walked toward the depths of the courtyard.
