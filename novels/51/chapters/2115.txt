2116 Si Liuhe Makes a Move

Their existence was an immense pressure. It was as if their existence alone had made the sanctum incredibly dangerous. They seemed to have endless vitality, as no matter how much damage they suffered, they could recover instantly.

At this moment, Si Liuhe stood at the edge of the Chaos Grave, staring at the sanctums. His body emitted a strong battle intent.

This battle intent undoubtedly shocked everyone! Si Liuhe had just come out of retreat and was already planning to attack the nine sanctums in the Chaos Grave!

“Is Si Liuhe crazy? Does he plan to attack the living beings in the sanctum of the Chaos Grave?”

“He… He seems to have such intention!”

“Is this the confidence of True Saint? It’s too terrifying!”

This news spread far and wide, and many people rushed over to witness this terrifying moment with their own eyes!

Staring at Si Liuhe, they discussed animatedly.

“I’m afraid that no one can stop Si Liuhe now.”

“He has just come out of retreat and has planned to attack the nine sanctums. He seems to have recovered his strength back then.”

“Who knows if it’s all bluff and bluster? Otherwise, why is he still not making a move?”

The internal qi in the Chaos Grave was getting stronger. And a gust of strong wind swept through as if it had realized Si Liuhe Liuhe’s intention.

Even the tomb slaves in the Chaos Grave had become restless. Without a doubt, as soon as Si Liuhe stepped into the tomb, all the tomb slaves would pounce on him!

“They are just a bunch of beasts without intelligence,” Si Liuhe spoke finally.

His words instantly shocked everyone! All their suspicions vanished at this moment!

“Si Liuhe… is going to make a move!” someone exclaimed.

“He… He’s going to attack the Chaos Grave!” An onlooker not far from the Chaos Grave said in shock.

“Is this real? Does Si Liuhe really have such courage?” someone said in disbelief.

“If he really dares to do this, he’s a real lunatic!”

At this moment, numerous gazes focused in the direction of the Chaos Grave. They were waiting for the existence they could not ignore to respond.

At this moment, Si Liuhe slowly raised his fingers.

Specks of light gathered on his fingers, and a terrifying Holy Power surged continuously!

“What… What a terrifying pressure…”

“Is this the peak state of a True Saint…”

In the next second, Si Liuhe’s fingers burst with light. The light flew into the sky above the Chaos Grave and exploded into numerous light spots!

The light spots were continuously merging with the void. Si Liuhe closed his eyes as if he was sensing something.

“What… What is he doing?”

“I know. Si Liuhe wants to comprehend the way in the Chaos Grave!”

“Yes, that’s right.” At this moment, Teng Zixu also came over from not far away. He planned to see the second True Saint in this world personally.

Seeing Teng Zixu arrive, many people opened a path for him.

Looking in Si Liuhe’s direction, Teng Zixu put his hands behind his back and narrowed his eyes. He seemed to be interested in Si Liuhe’s behavior.

Si Liuhe slightly closed his eyes, trying to sense the way in the Chaos Grave.

A moment later, he suddenly opened his eyes. Two rays of light shot out from his eyes and directly penetrated the heavy and turbid internal qi in the Chaos Grave!

“They are indeed a bunch of beasts without any intelligence.” Si Liuhe snorted coldly. After that, he stepped into the Chaos Grave!

When Si Liuhe entered the Chaos Grave, the tomb slaves who had been restless went berserk and pounced on him. Their figures were like a black storm that enveloped the entire Chaos Grave.

Seeing this scene, the hearts of all onlookers heightened.

However, Si Liuhe did not panic at all. His gaze was cold and emotionless. He waved his palm slightly, and a divine light flew out from his palm, instantly igniting the entire air.

The divine light carried incomparable majesty. It was like a blade that slashed directly at the tomb slaves pouncing toward him.

With a loud bang, the tomb slaves were cut into pieces by the divine light and turned into nothingness. Although their vitality was substantial, it was so fragile in front of the divine light.

“Is… Is this the strength of a True Saint?” someone exclaimed.

Si Liuhe’s majesty shocked everyone. He could easily destroy those powerful tomb slaves with one hand. This was his powerful strength. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Seeing this, Teng Zixu’s eyes also sparkled. He knew that Si Liuhe’s strength had been beyond his imagination.

At this moment, the tomb slaves in the Chaos Grave surged over again. Their numbers were even higher than before, and each emitted robust vitality.

However, Si Liuhe could not be bothered. He waved his hand again, and another divine light slashed out. This time, his divine light was even more powerful. It was like a heavenly river that poured down directly and swallowed all the tomb slaves.

Under the divine light, the tomb slaves turned into ashes and disappeared into the air.

In an instant, the Chaos Grave became empty. All the tomb slaves were killed by Si Liuhe.

“It’s really… really unimaginable…” someone muttered to himself.

Si Liuhe’s strength had gone beyond everyone’s imagination. His palm seemed to possess the power to destroy everything.

However, Si Liuhe did not stop there. His gaze became even colder as he stared straight at the nine sanctums.

Although Si Liuhe had killed the tomb slaves, they kept resurrecting and attacking Si Liuhe. Their bodies were like an endless source of energy. No matter how much damage they suffered, they could recover instantly.

However, Si Liuhe didn’t show any panic on his face. His eye expression was still cold. He waved his palm again, and another divine light slashed out.

This time, his divine light was even more powerful. It was like a destructive bolt of lightning that directly slashed at the resurrected tomb slaves. The divine light drew a long trail in the sky, bringing along a strong storm.

With a loud bang, the resurrected tomb slaves were cut off by the divine light again and turned into nothingness. Although they had strong vitality, they were weak in front of Si Liuhe’s divine light.

However, at this moment, the dead tomb slaves suddenly rose again and kept reviving!

Their number was more than before. They were like an endless black tide surging toward Si Liuhe.

“These tomb slaves… possess the ability to revive endlessly!”

“That’s right. As long as they’re in the Chaos Grave, they’ll continue to revive!”

“This is too scary. If this continues, even Si Liuhe can’t do anything!”

However, Si Liuhe was not surprised at all as if he had already expected it.

He stood where he was and waved his palm again.
