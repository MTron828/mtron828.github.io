2098 Meeting Yao Xi in Battle

“It’s easy to say that, Brother Jiang,” Saintess Gu said with a chuckle. “If the demon race really makes a comeback, I’m afraid we, the human race, will be in big trouble.”

“Although the demon race is powerful, the human race is not weak either. For example a few of us here, our strength would definitely become increasingly stronger. I believe everyone will become the pillar that has the strength of holding up the sky for the future human race and reversing the unfavorable situation.”

“Am I right, Qin Yu?” After saying that, Holy Son Jiang even pushed Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression was indescribably awkward, and he could only simply agree.

Fortunately, Holy Son Jiang and Saintess Gu did not continue to dwell on this topic. Instead, they turned to drinking and having fun.

In the following few days, Qin Yu stayed there.

And the news of Qin Yu and Yao Xi’s battle naturally spread out.

Ever since the arrival of the Golden Age, the battles between top-notch martial artists had been endless. However, no one had expected Yao Xi and Qin Yu to be the first of the younger generation. For a moment, everyone began to discuss this matter. Some even started to place bets on who would win this battle.

“Yao Xi has been famous for a long time and is on par with Si Shiyue and the others. The secret techniques of the Yao family are also countless, and they are inherited from the Immortal Emperor.”

“That’s right, but don’t forget that Qin Yu has just obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture. If he has comprehended the Traceless Immortal Scripture, it’s hard to say who will win.”

“It’s impossible to comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture so soon. Moreover, Wu Ji is just a Tribulation Stage cultivator. How can he be compared to an Immortal Emperor?”

“Hehe, is Wu Ji an ordinary Tribulation Stage cultivator? He integrated nine dao techniques by himself and entered the Tribulation Stage in the Degenerate Age. What he relied on was comprehension and technique. He’s not inferior to the Imperial Immortal!”

There were many different opinions, and people also started to gather on Mount Phoenix.

The various aristocratic families naturally sent their people to come and observe this battle. Currently, Qin Yu could not be considered the enemy of the aristocratic families, but he had indeed offended too many people. Everyone wanted to see if Qin Yu could live up to his reputation.

Time flew, and in the blink of an eye, the third day had come.

On that day, accompanied by Holy Son Jiang and Saintess Gu, Qin Yu rushed to Mount Phoenix.

At Mount Phoenix, Yao Xi had been waiting since early in the morning. He had changed into a set of very dull clothes. These clothes were incomparably dull, and even under the sunlight, they looked pitch-black.

He closed his eyes and stood on the mountain peak, quietly waiting for Qin Yu’s arrival.

Mount Phoenix was incredibly huge, and the terrain was even more complicated. Yao Xi had specially chosen an extremely eye-catching position to wait for Qin Yu’s arrival.

A few elders of the Yao family had personally taken action around Mount Phoenix to stabilize it so that it would not collapse during the battle between the two.

Time was ticking. Soon, Qin Yu appeared in everyone’s field of vision.

“He can’t wait to die.” Qin Yu’s tone was tremendously calm yet incomparably overbearing.

“Brother Qin seems to be full of confidence for this battle,” Saintess Gu smiled and said by the side.

Qin Yu did not reply. He naturally had no fear of this battle.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded. Turning his head around, he saw a purple light flash past and then pounce into Qin Yu’s arms with a whoosh.

Its speed was so fast that even Qin Yu could not react in time, and it almost crashed into Qin Yu’s chest.

“Jue Wu?” Seeing the comer, Qin Yu was overjoyed.

“It’s great to see that you’re fine!”

“It’s great to see that you’re fine!”

The two said this almost at the same time.

Holy Son Jiang came over. He bent and sized up Jue Wu. He smiled and said, “What a cute little girl! Come, let big brother hug you.”

“F*ck you!” Jue Wu did not say a word, and a thick palm instantly slapped forward!

This palm strike was tremendously powerful. Holy Son Jiang did not react in time. Therefore, he was immediately forced back by Jue Wu, and his chest hurt.

Rubbing his chest, he said with some annoyance, “This little girl has such a big temper!”

“If I’m not wrong, she should be Dean Lei’s personal disciple, Miss Jue Wu,” Saintess Gu said with a smile.

Jue Wu ignored Saintess Gu and stared at Qin Yu. “The Si family didn’t attack you, did they?”

Saintess Gu, standing by the side, felt a little awkward. Qin Yu could only shake his head helplessly.

“I’m fine. How about you?” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Without saying anything, Jue Wu took out the demonic egg and said, “Qin Yu, you are right. After I took out this demonic egg, I immediately…”

Before Jue Wu could finish speaking, Qin Yu hurriedly covered her mouth.

Seeing this, Saintess Gu did not say a word and retreated to the side.

Qin Yu brought Juewu to the side and whispered, “You can’t simply say anything. Also, put away your demonic egg! Many people are eying this thing!”

Jue Wu regained her senses and quickly put away the demonic egg. Then she said with a smile, “It’s okay. I was planning to go back to Thunder Courtyard to look for you. And I heard that you were going to fight with a person named Xi something, so I quickly came over.”

Qin Yu rubbed Jue Wu’s head and said, “With Dean Lei’s help, I managed to escape a calamity.”

At this point, Jue Wu continued to ask, “Have you heard from Xiao Hai recently? Since they had attacked me, they would have definitely attacked Xiao Hai.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“No. You don’t have any news about him either?” Qin Yu frowned slightly and said.

“En, after we parted ways, there was no more news of him. I heard he has returned to the Crimson Moon Continent, so I’m planning to look for him there.” Jue Wu took out an address.

“This is the address he gave to me before he left. He said if there’s anything, I can look for him.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “After this is over, I’ll go to Crimson Moon Continent with you.”

For some reason, Qin Yu had a bad feeling in his heart.

“Qin Yu, since you’ve come, why are you still dilly-dallying?” At this moment, Yao Xi’s voice suddenly sounded.

Qin Yu looked at Yao Xi coldly and said to Jue Wu, “Wait for me here. I’ll be right back.”

“Oh, be careful then. If it really doesn’t work, I’ll deal with him together with you,” Jue Wu muttered.

“I’m not afraid of him.” Qin Yu sneered and said.

After throwing this sentence, Qin Yu flashed and instantly arrived at the peak of the mountain, standing in front of Yao Xi.

Their eyes met, and a breeze blew past. The two figures emitted a collision of dao techniques.

Two rays of light emitted from their bodies continuously collided with each other as if they were testing each other.

“I didn’t expect you to dare to come,” Qin Yu sneered and said in advance.

As expected, after hearing Qin Yu’s words, Yao Xi was clearly stunned, and his face darkened.
