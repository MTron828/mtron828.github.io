Han Chongming snorted coldly. He put his hands behind his back and said, “Han Meng, this is your last chance. If you can’t handle it well, hand it over to Han Xiu.”

After saying this, Han Chongming turned around and walked out.

Han Meng’s expression was extremely ugly. He couldn’t help but clench his fists and clench his teeth.

Han Meng had no choice but to blame everything on Qin Yu, including Han Chongming’s indifference towards him.

“Qin Yu... I must kill you!” Han Meng said coldly.

...

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already been unconscious for an entire week.

Fortunately, with the Pavilion Master’s meticulous care, Qin Yu’s body was fine.

Finally, on this afternoon, Qin Yu woke up groggily.

Looking at the familiar surroundings, Qin Yu was momentarily stunned.

“You’re awake?” The Pavilion Master’s voice came from the side.

Qin Yu suddenly came back to his senses. He hurriedly stood up and said, “Pavilion Master, where is Ruoxue? Where is she now?”

The Pavilion Master blew at the soup in his hand and said, “Drink the medicine.”

Qin Yu didn’t have the mood to drink the medicine. He said anxiously, “Pavilion Master, I have to see Ruoxue immediately...”

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment. Then, she put the medicine aside and said, “She is in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association now. As for the reason, I don’t know.”

Only then did Qin Yu remember what he had heard before he fainted.

His expression was a bit ugly, and he hurriedly sat up from the bed.

“What? You want to send yourself to your death so badly?” The Pavilion Master said coldly.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Even if I die, I can’t just sit and do nothing.”

“You’d better take care of yourself first,” the Pavilion Master said coldly.

“Yan Ruoxue is the eldest daughter of the Yan family. Her situation is better than yours.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What you should be worried about now is how to deal with the anger of the Han family and the Yan family.”

Qin Yu was speechless for a moment.

Even though that was the case, it was impossible not to worry.

“Don’t worry. I will send someone to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to gather information,” the Pavilion Master said.

Qin Yu let out a sigh and nodded. “Okay, then I will have to trouble you, Pavilion Master.”

Although Qin Yu was very anxious, he also knew that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was dangerous.

With his own ability, it was impossible for him to take her away.

If it wasn’t for the battle he had with Han Wei, he would have died long ago.

Just the Yan family and Han family alone were powerful enough to take his life.

Qin Yu sat up from the bed.

He moved his body. Other than feeling a little stiff, he didn’t feel that uncomfortable.

“Let’s go. Follow me. Old Mister Jiang is still waiting for you,” said the Pavilion Master.

“Jiang He?” Qin Yu remembered him.

If he hadn’t made a move, the situation would have been extremely dire for him.

Qin Yu followed behind the Pavilion Master and walked toward the back mountain of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

At this moment, Jiang He was sitting on the back mountain with his eyes closed.

During this period of time, Jiang He spent practically all his time sitting on the back mountain.

“Old Mister Jiang.” The Pavilion Master’s voice came from behind.

Jiang He slowly turned his head. He shook his head and said jokingly, “Pavilion Master, you and I are practically the same age. It’s not appropriate to call me Old Mister Jiang.”

Ji Yuhong just smiled and didn’t say anything.

Although the two of them were about the same age, they looked like grandfather and grandchild.

“Greetings, Mr. Jiang.” Qin Yu walked forward and bowed slightly.

Jiang He nodded and said, “You’re awake. Have a seat.”

Qin Yu walked to the opposite side of Jiang He and sat down.

“Thank you, Mr. Jiang, for your help.” Qin Yu bowed and said.

Jiang He ignored this and asked, “What are your next plans?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said coldly, “I want to take Yan Ruoxue away.”

“She’s currently locked up in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. What if you can’t take her away?” Jiang He continued to ask.

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and coldly said, “Then I’ll destroy the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Hearing this, Jiang He couldn’t help but stroke his beard and laugh.

“Back then, I was just like you. I came from a lowly background, but my ambition was high. I thought I could change everything,” Jiang He slowly said.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association? Jingdu aristocratic family? In my eyes, they weren’t even worth mentioning.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He said somewhat confusedly, “Mr. Jiang, could it be that you also have a grudge with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

Jiang He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “It’s not just a grudge. I’ve killed at least ten Martial Marquises of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Back then, I also wanted to get rid of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“Then... . . Then why did you go into seclusion later?” Qin Yu was extremely puzzled by this.

Jiang He was allegedly the strongest person in Pyro. With his abilities, he should at least be able to force the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to admit defeat, right?

Jiang He raised his head and looked into the distance, as if he was reminiscing about the past.

A moment later, he quietly said, “Later on, I realized that I couldn’t change anything at all.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “Could it be that even you can’t do anything to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“Yes.” Jiang He didn’t hide anything.

“The deeper involved you get, the more you know how terrifying the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is, and the more you understand how powerful Jingdu is.”

“So, in the end, I chose to escape and live in seclusion.”

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly, and he was puzzled inside.

Why was even Jiang He so powerless against them?

“Don’t underestimate the power of Jingdu’s aristocratic families, and don’t underestimate the foundation of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,” Jiang He said.

“They have been established for many years and have already become the highest authority in the hearts of martial artists. Everyone regards entering the Martial Arts Association as an honor.”

“This is also why the most outstanding geniuses in the world work for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

At this point, the Pavilion Master beside him nodded and said, “Mr. Jiang is right. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is more powerful than you can imagine.”

“Other than the cultivation resources you can see, they also have an extremely strong foundation.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and just listened to them.

“Qin Yu, let me ask you, in your impression, what is the most powerful realm?” Jiang He asked.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I’ve heard of the Martial Saint Realm, but it’s said that the Martial Marquis Realm is already the ceiling.”

Jiang He nodded and said, “That’s right, the Martial Marquis Realm is indeed the ceiling.”

“But... this doesn’t apply to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed, and he hurriedly said, “Could it be... that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has a Martial Saint?”

Jiang He didn’t answer. He only said, “You will understand in the future.”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. Based on what Jiang He said, wouldn’t he have no hope?

Even Jiang He was so pessimistic, let alone Qin Yu?

“You don’t have to worry too much.” At this moment, Jiang He suddenly changed the topic.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Your future achievements will definitely be above mine. Perhaps, you are the one who will break the status quo.”
