Chapter 1267: Chapter 1,267, Spirit Monarch Lion 

But at this moment, the team leader beside him said indifferently, “Jing Bai, have you completely forgotten the principles of the Hunter Organization?”

“No matter how dangerous this order is, we can’t refuse the Hunter.”

Jing bai said furiously, “Fine, I’ll take responsibility for this! I don’t want to see anyone die fearlessly anymore!”

After saying that, Jing Bai wanted to tear the order into pieces.

And this undoubtedly infuriated the team leader.

He grabbed Jing Bai’s wrist and said coldly, “Jing Bai, are you crazy?”

“So What If I’m Crazy? At most, I’ll just leave,”Jing Bai said coldly.

Their eyes met, and rays of cold light burst out.

The two of them seemed to be about to erupt into a great battle at any moment.

Qin Yu coughed and stretched out his hand to take the order.

“Big Brother Jing Bai, thank you for your kindness, but... leave this order to me,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Jing bai immediately said angrily, “You... ! Newcomer, let me tell you, if you die, no one will collect your corpse!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’m confident.”

Jing Bai’s expression was extremely complicated. There was anger and frustration at the same time.

However, Qin Yu had already accepted it, so there was nothing he could do.

“Big Brother Guan Zhuang, let’s go. You lead the way.”Qin Yu looked at Guan Zhuang.

Guan Zhuang grunted and led Qin Yu towards Qingyan Forest.

On the way, Guan Zhuang said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, you are too arrogant. Jing Bai is right. Many people have already died in this order.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “In order to prevent more people from dying, leave it to me.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Guan Zhuang could not help but sigh in his heart when he saw this.

He had been in the Hunter Organization for many years and had seen countless new people.

These new people were arrogant and arrogant, but they had all paid a heavy price in the end, so Guan Zhuang was not surprised.

“Hopefully, there is a chance to save his life,”Guan Zhuang said in his heart.

“Big Brother Guan Zhuang, isn’t this hunter organization a spontaneous organization? Why is there a leader?”Qin Yu asked doubtfully.

Guan Zhuang grunted and said, “In any place, as long as there are more people, there will definitely be an organization. This is unavoidable.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. This was the truth.

“Then does this leader have great authority?”Qin Yu asked.

Guan Zhuang was silent for a moment and said, “It’s hard to say, but he has quite a high prestige among the hunters.”

Qin Yu muttered, “I think he’s not as good as Jing Bai. Although this jing Bai looks cold, he always thinks for the sake of the hunters.”

“That’s right.”This view was approved by Guan Zhuang.

He said, “Jing Bai is a young man with a sharp tongue but a soft heart. He has a very sense of responsibility.”

“Yeah, I’m just a newcomer, but he wants to stop me from taking this order and save my life.”Qin Yu placed his hands behind his head and muttered leisurely.

Guan Zhuangbai rolled his eyes and said, “Unfortunately, it’s useless. The newcomer is always disobedient.”

Qin Yu smiled and did not explain.

The demonic beast on this order was called the Spirit Monarch Lion, and it was an extremely powerful demonic beast.

However, other than its name, there was no other information on the order.

“Big Brother Guan Zhuang, can you tell me about the characteristics of this spirit Monarch Lion?”Qin Yu asked.

Guan Zhuang said in a deep voice, “The spirit monarch Lion’s biggest characteristic is its rough skin and thick flesh. We tried all kinds of methods, but we were unable to severely injure it.”

“Other than that, its teeth are extremely sharp. It can easily cut open a small mountain. Its powerful internal Qi even repelled other demonic beasts and formed its own territory.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and muttered, “That’s good, as long as it’s not a speed-type contestant.”

To Qin Yu, what he was most afraid of right now was a fast opponent.

Because Qin Yu didn’t have any spiritual energy, his speed was still slightly inferior, and it was very easy for him to escape.

As for its rough skin and thick flesh, Qin Yu wasn’t very worried.

With these two iron fists of his, nothing could withstand it.

More importantly, Qin Yu still had an iron rod in his hand.

Although Qin Yu didn’t know the origin of the Iron Rod, it was definitely a great killing weapon.

The two of them walked for a long time. In the Green Rock Forest, they could hear the roars of demonic beasts from time to time.

“Big Brother Guan Zhuang, do you think this spirit monarch Lion has life Qi in its body?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Guan Zhuang shook his head and said, “It’s hard to say.”

“Alright.”Qin Yu nodded.

It seemed that one still needed a certain amount of luck to obtain life Qi from Demonic Beasts.

At this moment, Guan Zhuang’s footsteps gradually slowed down.

He stopped and said in a low voice, “We’re almost at the Spirit Monarch Lion’s territory.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “Big Brother Guan Zhuang, wait for me outside in case anything unexpected happens.”

Guan Zhuang glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You are quite confident. Young Man, it is not a good thing to be too confident.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Big Brother Guan Zhuang, don’t worry. I have a secret technique to protect my life.”

Even though that was the case, Guan Zhuang still followed behind Qin Yu and slowly walked into the spirit monarch Lion’s territory.

The moment he stepped into the lion’s territory, Qin Yu felt a trace of an abnormal internal QI.

Along the way, the surrounding sounds were quite noisy. From time to time, the roars and cries of demonic beasts could be heard.

But here, it was extremely quiet.

Other than the rustling of leaves, there was no other sound.

“The Spirit Monarch Lion’s territorial awareness is particularly strong. You have to be careful and follow behind me,”Guan Zhuang said with a vigilant look.

Qin Yu did not say anything. He took a deep breath and tried to sense the internal Qi of the Spirit Monarch Lion.

“It’s coming!”

At this moment, Guan Zhuang suddenly roared!

Qin Yu did not sense any internal Qi at all. The Spirit Monarch Lion had already appeared behind Qin Yu!

“Be careful!”Guan Zhuang was immediately shocked and ran towards Qin Yu anxiously.

However, it was already too late. The Spirit Monarch Lion’s huge palm slammed fiercely onto Qin Yu’s body.

This slap had the power to Split Mountains and split seas!
