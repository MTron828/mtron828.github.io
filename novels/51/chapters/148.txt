The crowd immediately went into an uproar.

Just by extending his hand, he was able to cure the child’s illness? What kind of medical skill was this?

Qin Yu placed his hands behind his back calmly.

This was his prowess at the Foundation Establishment Stage. Ordinary illnesses could be cured with just spiritual energy.

Mr. Ding, who was at the side, walked to Qin Yu’s side quickly. He cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Qin, thank you for your help.”

After saying this, Mr. Ding turned to Zhou Tong and said, “Doctor Zhou, I clearly saw what you have done through the surveillance cameras.”

“I gave you a sum of money to invite you to give free consultations, but I didn’t expect you to accept bribes in private, so I’m sorry,” Mr. Ding said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

Qin Yu was rather appreciative of Mr. Ding’s behavior and couldn’t help but nod slightly.

Zhou Tong’s expression was ice-cold. He looked at Mr. Ding and said, “Mr. Ding, I hope you don’t regret it.”

“Of course I won’t regret it,” Mr. Ding said nonchalantly.

“Zhou Tong, you can get lost now,” Qin Yu scolded coldly.

Zhou Tong’s expression was extremely displeased. He looked at the two people beside him.

The two people immediately understood. They looked at each other and suddenly threw a punch at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu had already discerned that these two were Inner Strength Masters, so he was prepared.

Qin Yu raised his hands calmly and met them head-on.

With a crisp sound, these two were sent flying!

The bones in their hands were broken, and they were in extreme pain!

“You guys actually dare to provoke me?” Qin Yu said coldly.

The two of them got up from the ground and stood beside Zhou Tong without daring to say anything.

“Qin Yu, you will pay for your actions. Don’t underestimate the power of a famous doctor,” Zhou Tong said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered. “No matter how good your medical skills are, it’s not worth mentioning if you don’t have medical ethics.”

“Hahaha!” Zhou Tong couldn’t help but laugh loudly.

“My medical skills are just a means for me to get acquainted with high officials and nobles. As for you, I want to see how far your kindness can get you!” Zhou Tong said fiercely.

After saying this, Zhou Tong turned around and left.

The crowd quickly erupted into thunderous applause. Countless people were praising Qin Yu.

And Qin Yu also kept his promise. He immediately sat on Zhou Tong’s seat and began to treat everyone.

For the entire day, it was only until nine o’clock in the evening that the hospital gradually quieted down.

Qin Yu stretched his body and felt extremely exhausted.

Such a huge consumption of spiritual energy was something that even Qin Yu couldn’t tolerate. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Mr. Qin, I have really troubled you.” Mr. Ding brought a cup of water for Qin Yu and said politely.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Ding, you don’t have to be so polite. I’m not doing this for you.”

Although that was the case, Qin Yu’s action brought great benefits to the Chinese Medical Hospital.

“Mr. Qin, if you are willing, I would like to hire you as a special doctor. What do you think?” Mr. Ding suddenly said.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said with some confusion, “Special doctor? What do you mean?”

“I mean that you will be a nominal doctor. I’ll give you a salary every month, and your position will only be second to mine! You only need to come once in a while,” Mr. Ding quickly said.

Qin Yu thought about it for a moment. This was a good offer.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu said, “Forget about the salary. How about this? You only need to send me a batch of herbs every month. Is that okay?”

Mr. Ding was immediately overjoyed. He hurriedly nodded and said, “Absolutely no problem! Our Chinese Medical Hospital lacks everything except herbs!”

“Okay, then I’ll have to trouble you.” Qin Yu nodded and then turned around to leave.

When he returned home, it was already past ten o’clock at night.

Qin Yu walked around the house, but he still didn’t find Yao Qing.

“Weird, where did this brat go?” Qin Yu mumbled.

Yao Qing hadn’t been home for two whole days, and he couldn’t be reached by his phone. This worried Qin Yu a little.

Fortunately, Yao Qing was also an Inner Strength Master, so he probably wouldn’t encounter any big problems. Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it.

He slept until dawn.

The next morning, Mr. Ding asked someone to send over a batch of herbs.

In the next few days, Qin Yu spent almost all his time refining herbs.

“D*mn, it’s really difficult to completely control the spiritual fire.” Qin Yu looked at the burned herbs in front of him and couldn’t help but feel a little annoyed.

In the past few days, Qin Yu had tried countless times, but he always failed to control the fire properly. If he was even just a little careless, the herbs would be burned to ashes.

However, there was no shortcut to this. He could only rely on time to improve his experience.

Five days passed in the blink of an eye.

There were only two days left until the Chinese Medicine Conference.

Early in the morning, Mr. Yang arrived at Qin Yu’s door.

He stood in front of Qin Yu and said politely, “Mr. Qin, I have already arranged the work in the factory. Do you think we should set off?”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “This early?”

Mr. Yang forced a smile and said, “We still have to register in advance and go through the relevant procedures.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Alright, please wait a moment. I’ll pack up.”

After half an hour, Qin Yu brought some personal belongings with him and set off for the provincial capital with Mr. Yang.

Chinese medicine had declined over the years. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the influence of Chinese medicine couldn’t be compared to that of modern medicine.

Of course, no one could be blamed for this. The main reason was that too many swindlers were using traditional Chinese medicine as a ruse to swindle people, so no one was willing to believe in traditional Chinese medicine anymore.

After driving for a long time, they finally arrived at the provincial capital.

This was the second time Qin Yu had come to the provincial capital, so Qin Yu was familiar with the area.

Mr. Yang brought Qin Yu all the way to the venue of the traditional Chinese Medicine Conference.

“This is the venue of the Chinese Medicine Conference,” Mr. Yang said as he pointed at the huge stadium in front of him.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It doesn’t look like there are many people.”

Mr. Yang forced a smile and said, “In a normal city, there are at most two or three people participating in the competition. In Jiangcheng, for so many years, I was the only one who participated.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. It wasn’t easy for Mr. Yang to remain dedicated for so many years.

“Let’s go in and register. I’ve already submitted the relevant information,” Mr. Yang said.

Qin Yu nodded and followed Mr. Yang into the venue.

The registration area was a huge office. The interior decoration was extremely magnificent, and the person in charge of the examination was the provincial capital’s Chinese Medicine Association.

Qin Yu followed Mr. Yang into the office.

He saw four to five old men signing up in the office.

When they saw Mr. Yang, they teased him, “Mr. Yang, you’re here to sign up again.”

“This must be your thirteenth time participating in the competition, right? This time, work harder. Don’t be the last one.”

“That’s right. You lose every year, yet you still don’t give up. I really admire your enthusiasm despite repeated failure.”
