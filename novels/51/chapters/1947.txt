1948 News about Jue Wu

“That’s right.” The prince nodded slightly, smiled, and said, “Brother Qin, you seem very interested in my background.”

“I’m also an alchemist, so I was wondering if I could help Your Highness,” Qin Yu shook his head, smiled, and said.

“Brother Qin is also an alchemist?” the prince said in surprise.

“Yes, but not competent,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

!!

“There’s no need for that. I’ve seen most of the alchemists in the Holy Region,” the prince said with emotion.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and did not say anything else, but he had more doubts about the prince now.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He left after bidding goodbye to the prince.

After walking out of the palace, Qin Yu looked back again. Everything was extremely calm.

It was like an abandoned ancient building representing the past.

“He only contracted such a serious illness when he was fifteen,” Qin Yu thought to herself.

At fifteen, one would have formed their own thoughts and be the easiest to be tainted by hatred.

His father probably did not die a natural death. Therefore, whether the prince was really dispirited or just pretending remained unknown.

Of course, if Qin Yu could think of this, the people of the nine great aristocratic families must have thought of this as well. Since they didn’t care, they must have some countermeasures.

After leaving the palace, Qin Yu was not rushing to leave Sky City. Instead, he found a quiet place and planned to go for seclusion.

Sky City was incredibly prosperous. Almost everything one could think of was available here. However, it was extremely difficult to find a quiet place.

Qin Yu took a long time before he finally found a mountain forest.

“It’s about time for me to go for seclusion. As long as I reach the Reversion Void Stage, I don’t have to be afraid of Si Shifeng,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then he took out the dragon blood and began the closed-door cultivation.

Qin Yu swallowed the dragon’s blood straightaway recklessly, wasting natural resources. However, Qin Yu could not care less at this moment.

He relied on his strong willpower to resist the pain and slowly began absorbing the essence of the dragon’s blood.

On the other end, Si Shifeng and Si Shiyue were in a restaurant.

“Cough, cough…”

Si Shifeng’s face was extremely pale, and he coughed from time to time. He was extremely weak.

Obviously, Xiao Sheng’s strike caused him severe injury.

“Who is that brat actually…” Si Shifeng looked incredibly furious.

Si Shiyue shook his head and said, “I’ve sent people to investigate. I believe it won’t take long to find him.”

“I’ll definitely tear him to pieces!” Si Shifeng said through gritted teeth.

Due to his anger, Si Shifeng’s blood suddenly surged, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Si Shiyue remained quiet, but his heart filled with doubts.

When did such a young man appear in Zhongzhou? In the entire young generation of the Holy Region, not many people could injure Si Shifeng severely with merely a raise of their hands.

At this moment, the Si family’s cutivator walked over to Si Shiyue’s side.

“Holy Son, we’ve already investigated the person.”

Hearing this, Si Shiyue nodded and signaled him to continue.

“His name is Xiao Sheng. He came Nanzhou in Lizhou. He was once the number one figure in Nanzhou,” the Si family’s cultivator said.

He then told Si Shiyue all about Xiao Sheng’s past.

After hearing this, Si Shiyue couldn’t help but be in deep thought.

Si Shifeng by the side said furiously, “A b*stard from Lizhou dares to behave atrociously to the Si family!”

“By the way, rumor has it that Dean Lei of Thunder Courtyard once arduously invited him to join them.” At this moment, the cultivator seemed to have remembered something.

“So, he studied in Thunder Courtyard. No wonder!” Si Shiyue said in a low voice.

“No, Holy Son, you’re wrong.” The cultivator shook his head. “He didn’t go to Thunder Courtyard because he rejected Dean Lei’s invitation.”

“What?” Si Shifeng was instantly shocked!

Even Si Shiyue had a look of shock on his face.

Thunder Courtyard had an extraordinary status. Even the nine great aristocratic families would not dare to provoke it!

As for Thunder Courtyard’s resources, it was needless to say. Even Si Shiyue’s younger brother, Si Shiyu, had gone to Thunder Courtyard to study, let alone others!

“This brat is really arrogant…” Si Shifeng said, somewhat without much confidence.

Si Shiyue’s expression was gloomy, and he didn’t say a thing.

This immediately made Si Shifeng somewhat worried. He quickly said, “Brother Yue, are we just going to let him go like this?”

Si Shiyue glanced at Si Shifeng and said coldly, “No matter who he is, he must die for offending the Si family.”

Hearing this, Si Shifeng heaved a sigh of relief and chimed in, “Yes, he must die!”

At this moment, Si Shiyue looked at the cultivator and said, “Is there any news about Shiyu recently?”

“I was just about to report to you,” the cultivator bowed and said.

Although he said that, he stammered and was silent for a long time.

“Go ahead,” Si Shifeng berated from the side.

The cultivator smiled bitterly and said,” Young Master Yu lost again.”

...

“He was defeated again?” Si Shiyue frowned.

“Yes. This is his second failure since he lost to Qin Yu by suppressing his cultivation realm last time,” the cultivator sighed and said.

Si Shiyue snorted and said, “Thunder Courtyard is indeed full of talents!”

“Brother Yu must have suppressed his cultivation again. Otherwise, how could he have lost?” Si Shifeng chuckled from the side.

However, the Si family’s cultivator shook his head and said, “No, this time, Young Master Yu fought with all his might but he still lost.”

Si Shiyue’s expression turned ugly instantly.

He and Si Shiyu were from the same parents, and the same blood flowed through their bodies.

Although Si Shiyue was slightly stronger, Si Shiyu was definitely not weak!

“Who did he lose to?” Si Shiyue asked.

“Someone called Jue Wu,” the cultivator by the side said.

“Jue Wu? I’ve never heard of it.” Si Shifeng snorted lightly.

...

“Jue Wu is a closed-door disciple of Dean Lei. Rumor has it that she has Nirvana Body,” the cultivator said with a bitter smile.

“Nirvana body… It’s fine. The Nirvana Body will eventually decline and is not worth mentioning,” Si Shifeng said at the side.

Si Shiyue somehow agreed with what he said. Nirvana Body could indeed display incredibly powerful abilities in the early stage but not subsequently. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

In the entire history of Nirvana Body, only a handful could enter the True Saint realm. As for the higher cultivation realms, it was unheard of.

Si Shiyue did not dwell on this topic. He glanced at Si Shifeng and said, “I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for you to fight Qin Yu in your current condition.”

Si Shifeng gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu is just a nobody. Even if I’m seriously injured, I can still kill him!”

“Let’s fight on another day.” Si Shiyue stood up. “If you lose to Qin Yu, I’m afraid it will be even more embarrassing.”
