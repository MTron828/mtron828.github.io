Chapter 256: Pendant Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing Qin Yu’s expression, Xiao Yu was startled.

She clutched her chest and said, “You... you pervert, what are you trying to do?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Don’t worry, I’m not interested in a brat like you.”

“My condition is for you to eat obediently and listen to your father,” Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said.

Xiao Yu was instantly delighted and said excitedly, “Really?”

“Of course, but if your father says you’re disobedient, I won’t give it to you,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“I’ll definitely listen!” Xiao Yu ran to the dining table excitedly and began to eat in big mouthfuls.

Mr. Wu couldn’t help but give Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “You know how to discipline her. Sigh, I can’t control her anymore.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “People of every generation have their own ideas. Imposing our ideas on her might not work.”

Mr. Wu nodded thoughtfully.

Then, Mr. Wu asked, “By the way, where are you going to get tickets?”

Qin Yu said, “I know Yang Jing. Two tickets shouldn’t be a problem.”

When he heard this, Mr. Wu’s admiration for Qin Yu increased.

After dinner, Qin Yu took Yao Qing and prepared to leave.

Before leaving, Xiao Yu kept saying, “Qin Yu, don’t forget. It’s best to get a few more tickets!”

“Don’t worry.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

The car sped all the way home.

Qin Yu checked online and found that Yang Jing’s concert was about two days later.

Qin Yu calculated the time and found that it was exactly the day that Yang Jing came to pick up the medicine.

If he wasn’t mistaken, she would come to him of her own accord, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, Qin Yu went online to check Yang Jing’s concerts and couldn’t help but frown.

“This doesn’t sound that nice. It sounds bizarre,” Qin Yu whispered.

Just then, Yao Qing walked in from outside the door.

He said mysteriously, “Mr. Qin, there’s a beautiful woman outside looking for you.”

“Let her in,” Qin Yu said nonchalantly.

Yao Qing pretended to be surprised and said, “It seems that you two have known each other for a long time. Is she your friend with benefits?”

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu scolded with a smile and pretended to kick him.

Yao Qing then walked out obediently.

A moment later, Yang Jing walked in from outside the door.

As usual, Yang Jing was wrapped up tightly.

This also made Qin Yu wonder how Yao Qing could tell that she was a beauty.

After sitting down, Yang Jing took off the mask over her face and her eyes.

“Oh my, I’m suffocating.” Yang Jing panted heavily.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “Are you here to get the medicine?”

Yang Jing rolled her eyes and said, “What? I can’t look for you if I’m not here to get the medicine? Can’t I miss you?”

“No,” Qin Yu said quietly.

Yang Jing said angrily, “You’re too cocky! Do you think I really miss you?”

“It’s best if you don’t,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

“You!” Yang Jing opened her mouth, but there was nothing she could say.

“Forget it. Forget it. Hurry up and get me the medicine,” Yang Jing said impatiently.

However, Qin Yu looked at Yang Jing’s chest.

Yang Jing noticed Qin Yu’s gaze and immediately covered her chest. She rolled her eyes and said, “Men really don’t mean what they say. Are you mesmerized by my sexy figure?”

Qin Yu ignored her. He reached out his hand and reached for Yang Jing’s chest.

Yang Jing immediately panicked, and her face flushed.

Her heart beat violently, and her body trembled slightly.

Although she had a good impression of Qin Yu, this... wasn’t this too fast?

Just as Yang Jing’s thoughts were running wild, Qin Yu reached out and pulled the pendant off her neck.

“Who gave this to you?” Qin Yu stared at the pendant and asked with a frown.

Yang Jing grabbed the pendant back in a panic and said with a frightened expression, “You can’t touch this pendant. I got it from my mentor. It can bring me good luck. If you like it, I’ll take you to ask for another one.”

“Mentor?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

The pendant was filled with dark energy and there were even traces of blood. How could such a thing bring good luck? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I’m afraid you’ve been deceived.” Qin Yu touched the pendant and felt that it wasn’t as simple as it seemed.

Yang Jing rolled her eyes and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? This is a pendant that can make me even more famous! It’s very effective! And it brings me good luck!”

After saying that, Yang Jing, afraid that it would be snatched away, even put the pendant in front of her chest.

“Do you really think that this thing is going to bring you good luck?” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

“Of course!” Yang Jing said seriously.

Qin Yu reached out his hand and said, “Give me the pendant.”

“Huh?” Yang Jing was stunned.

Qin Yu said, “Don’t worry, I won’t snatch your pendant. Moreover, I don’t lack pendants.”

Yang Jing frowned slightly, as if she was in a dilemma.

A moment later, she handed the jade pendant to Qin Yu obediently.

After Qin Yu took the jade pendant, he immediately circulated his mental cultivation method.

There were countless mystical arts left in the inheritance. Qin Yu could choose any one of them to exorcize demons and ward off evil.

He dropped a drop of blood essence from his finger on the pendant.

The moment the blood fell, thick smoke immediately rose from the pendant!

Waves of pitch-black dark energy gushed out from it!

In the end, the dark energy slowly took shape in the air before showing one miserable human head after another!

The human heads looked extremely horrifying. Even the most thrilling horror movie couldn’t compare to them!

When Yang Jing saw this ghost head, she was so scared that her face turned pale. Her body swayed and she almost fell down!

“What... What is this...” Yang Jing said with trembling lips.

“This is what was hidden in your pendant,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The ghost head resounded with a series of miserable screams in the air, as if it was going to swallow Qin Yu.

“How dare you try to stir up a ruckus in front of me?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and suddenly opened his mouth. The ghost head was sucked in by Qin Yu!

The huge ghost head was directly swallowed by Qin Yu!

Yang Jing, who was at the side, was already scared out of her wits.

She looked at Qin Yu with a trace of fear in her eyes. She even moved her body a few steps away from Qin Yu.

“Why? Are you afraid?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

Yang Jing swallowed hard and whispered, “You... you actually swallowed it?”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “To you, it’s an evil thing, but to me, it’s a nourishing holy object.”

Qin Yu paused for a moment and looked at Yang Jing coldly. “Do you know the consequences of wearing this thing?”

Yang Jing, her small face full of grievance, hurriedly shook her head.

Qin Yu said coldly, “If you hadn’t met me today, this thing would have killed you.”
