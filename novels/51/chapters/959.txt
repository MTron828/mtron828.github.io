Chapter 960: Chapter 960, the descent of Jiang He!

These eight martial saints looked at Xu Huaigu coldly. A great battle was about to break out at any moment!

“Old Man, go to Hell!”

With a furious roar, the great battle officially began!

The eight martial saints attacked almost at the same time! Their swift and fierce moves shook the entire nine Pinnacles Mountain!

Xu Huaigu’s expression was calm, and his movements were even more elegant and natural.

His two large sleeves carried a gentle and fierce force as he faced the eight of them at a moderate pace.

The moves were dodged one by one. What was shocking was that Xu Huaigu’s movements were incomparably elegant, and he actually easily dodged every move!

“Senior Xu is so strong!”

Seeing this scene, everyone couldn’t help but clench their fists!

Qin Yu was also somewhat shocked.

Xu Huaigu’s strength seemed to have improved a bit!

“Boom!”

The explosions outside continued. Even Qin Yu and the others were affected.

Their eyes were fixed on the outside, and their hearts were in their throats.

Gu Xinghe and the others were not in a hurry. Eight Martial Saints could grind Xu Huaigu to death!

“Why don’t you go?”Gu Xinghe glanced at Zhai Xing and asked.

“There’s no need for that,”Zhai Xing said.

Gu Xinghe snorted lightly and said, “Is there no need, or do you not want to go?”

Zhai Xing did not respond, but his intention was very obvious.

“Uncle Zhai Xing, I have to remind you that you are a member of the second mystic realm,”Gu Xinghe snorted lightly.

Zhai xing nodded and said, “I know. I will always be a member of the second Mystic Realm.”

“Boom!”

At this moment, Xu Huaigu waved his palm and slapped a martial saint back!

“You have some ability!”This made many martial saints laugh coldly.

It was obvious that Xu Huaigu’s strength was much stronger than they had imagined.

In the room, Qin Yu frowned.

Through this short exchange, Qin Yu had already struck out Xu Huaigu’s advantage and weakness.

His advantage was that he was still able to face many people calmly and easily. However, his disadvantage was also extremely obvious.

Perhaps it was because of Xu Huaigu’s cultivation path that his moves did not have any fatal ability. In fact, he could not even injure his opponent in a short period of time!

If this continued, it would not be long before Xu Huaigu would fall into a disadvantageous position!

“Those eight martial saints don’t seem to have used their full strength.”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Yao Meng, who was at the side, also nodded and said, “Other than Zeng Ji, the others seem to be testing senior Xu’s foundation.”

“To be able to deal with eight martial saints to such an extent is already not bad.”Qin Yu sighed.

Just as the two of them were chatting, the great battle outside had already turned around!

These martial saints’internal Qi had erupted to the extreme at the same time, and their techniques had also become even fiercer. Each of their attacks were aimed at Xu Huaigu’s vital points!

“Dong!”

In just a few short minutes, Xu Huaigu had already received a punch to his chest!

This punch had directly pierced through Xu Huaigu’s chest, and fresh blood gushed out like a fountain!

Xu Huaigu stood up from the ground and once again came forward to receive the punch.

However, as the battle continued, Xu Huaigu’s flaws grew more and more, and the injuries on his body became more and more obvious!

“Bang!”

Another palm strike struck Xu Huaigu’s chest!

His body was instantly sent flying, and fresh blood spurted out from his mouth!

“Senior Xu!”Qin Yu’s pupils instantly constricted upon seeing this!

He clenched his fists, and his face was filled with worry.

Xu Huaigu tried to get up from the ground. However, as soon as he stood up, a palm descended from the sky and slammed him onto the ground once again!

“Pu!”

Fresh blood gushed out from Xu Huaigu’s mouth. The fresh blood had completely dyed his white clothes red!

Many martial saints looked at Xu Huaigu with a playful expression. The mocking smile on their faces made this scene even more cruel and tragic!

“I have to say, you do have some strength. It’s a pity that your methods are too gentle.”A martial saint commented.

“You are truly a benevolent person. How can you kill an enemy with such methods?”A martial saint beside him also mocked.

“Xu Huaigu, you are also considered a talent. Why Don’t you follow us? Perhaps, it will bring you a second spring.”

In the face of everyone’s words, Xu Huaigu did not say a word. He stood up from the ground once again.

“Boom!”

A Ray of light pierced through his abdomen!

“Whoosh!”

Another ray of light pierced through Xu Huaigu’s calves!

Xu Huaigu fell to the ground with a “Bang”sound. He kept spitting out blood from his mouth.

Even so, Xu Huaigu still stood up with great difficulty and walked towards these martial saints!

Zhai Xing, who was not far away, seemed to be unable to bear it. He turned his head to the side and could not bear to watch any longer.

“You are really stubborn.”A martial saint sneered.

“I want to see how many times you can stand up!”

A Ray of light descended from the sky and once again slammed Xu Huaigu onto the ground!

However, Xu Huaigu stood up once again!

Once, twice, thrice! Countless times, Xu Huaigu fell, got up, got up, and fell again!

“Senior Xu!”In the room, everyone’s eyes could not help but tear up!

Looking at such a tragic Xu Huaigu, everyone was touched.

Qin Yu was even more dumbfounded. He gritted his teeth and turned to look at Zhuang Teng.

“Give me your sword!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said.

“What are you doing?”Yao Meng frowned.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I can’t just watch senior Xu Huaigu die in front of me!”

“Qin Yu, you’d better calm down.”However, Yao Meng shook her head.

She pointed at Zhai Xing who was beside Gu Xinghe and said, “Zhai Xing hasn’t made his move yet. If you join him, Zhai Xing will definitely make his move too. I’m afraid the outcome will be even worse.”

“Then what should we do? Are We just going to sit and wait for death?”Kong Yun shouted.

“If senior Xu Huaigu dies, how can we live alone? !”

Yao Meng opened her mouth, but for a moment, there was nothing she could say.

Xu Huaigu fell to the ground again and stood up again.

A total of eighteen times.

Anyone who saw such a scene could not help but shed tears.

Every time he stood up, he tried to get close to them.

His stubborn attitude moved people.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He had suddenly guessed something!

“Senior Xu Huaigu... he wants to self-destruct!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

Was this the reason why Xu Huaigu had been trying to get close to them! !

Outside the door.

A martial saint said with a cold smile, “Xu Huaigu, you are already very good to be able to do this.”

“Yes, I can not bear to see you struggling so hard.”

“Send him on his way. This way, at least he will suffer less.”

Wan Gu Qiong, who was not far away, sneered and said, “It is already not bad for a person who has not stepped into the secret territory to have such skills. I hope that you can reincarnate into a secret territory aristocratic family in your next life.”

“Not bad, to be able to be on par with the martial saint in our secret territory, you are indeed worthy of praise.”

Just as everyone was secretly harboring killing intent, they suddenly felt an internal Qi approaching from not far away.

“Is the martial saint in the secret realm superior to others?”

A voice entered everyone’s ears!

They raised their heads and saw a man walking over! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Senior Jiang He!”Upon seeing him, Qin Yu was instantly surprised and delighted!
