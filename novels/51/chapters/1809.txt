1810 Fighting for an Opportunity

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment and then said hurriedly, “Going to Zhongzhou? Is the mission out?”

Xiaobai nodded with a smile and said, “That’s right. It just came out. However, there are only eight spots for this trip to Zhongzhou. Jiu Xiao is in charge.”

“Eight spots?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Not to mention the number of spots, under normal circumstances, there would be two people in a team.

But now, he wanted eight people. This was enough to show that this trip to Zhongzhou was extremely dangerous.

What troubled Qin Yu even more was his relationship with Jiu Xiao.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu had both offended him back then, so it would be very difficult for him to give the spot to Qin Yu.

“Are you going?” Qin Yu asked.

“No, I’m not,” Xiaobai shook his head and said. “I’ve never participated in such a life-threatening mission.”

Qin Yu remained silent. He then asked, “When is the registration?”

“Tomorrow,” Xiaobai said.

“Alright,” Qin Yu nodded and said. “I got it.”

“Xiaobai, what are you standing outside for? Come in and eat something.” At this time, Jue Wu’s voice came from inside.

Only then did Qin Yu realize that he had been impolite. He quickly cupped his hands and said, “I’m sorry, I was too anxious. Let’s go in and talk.”

Without further ado, Xiaobai followed Qin Yu into the cave abode.

In the cave abode, Jue Wu had already roasted a big yak.

Jue Wu’s cooking skills were indeed perfect. Perhaps it was due to her experience of eating too much. In short, the meat was tender, juicy, and incomparably tasty. Xiaobai praised while eating.

“Sigh! I really envy the life of the two of you. You two are indeed like a young married couple.” Xiaobai wiped his mouth and couldn’t help but sigh.

Jue Wu glared at Xiaobai and reprimanded, “Nonsense. I’m even too old to be his grandmother.”

“In this world, who cares about age?” Xiao Bai smiled bitterly and said. “Those who have reached the Reversion Void Stage can live for more than a thousand years, and True Saints can live for several thousand years. What is age?”

It was true. For cultivators, age seemed to be just a unit of measurement.

“Alright. Let’s not talk about this,” Qin Yu changed the topic and said.

“Xiaobai, do you think it’s possible to retain the place in Thunder Courtyard but not come back for a long time?” Qin Yu asked.

Hearing this, Xiao Bai said in surprise, “Why? Are you thinking of leaving Thunder Courtyard? I must tell you that the cultivation here is far more advanced than anywhere else.”

Qin Yu cried bitterly in his heart.

Of course, he knew he could listen to the Great Dao and feel the internal qi of the Immortal Emperor here. How could other places be able to compare to this?

However, with Qin Yu’s current condition, it was indeed too dangerous for him to stay in Thunder Courtyard.

Furthermore, once Qin Yu reached the Reversion Void stage, he would definitely head to Zhongzhou. It was impossible for him to stay in Thunder Courtyard for long.

“The resources controlled by Thunder Courtyard are beyond my reach in my life. It’s just that I’m used to being free, so it’s hard for me to stay in the same place for a long time,” Qin Yu said.

Xiaobai thought for a moment and said, “You can’t enter Thunder Courtyard freely unless you make a great contribution to Thunder Courtyard or stand out in Thunder Courtyard. Otherwise, you no longer can enter Thunder Courtyard after leaving for more than a year.”

“A year…” Qin Yu murmured.

To cultivators, a year was extremely short. It could be said to pass in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu would never be willing to give up Thunder Courtyard in such a manner.

“What do you mean by standing out in Thunder Courtyard?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

“It’s very simple,” Xiaobai said with a smile. “Every ten years, there will be a battle between the main peaks. You just need to get into the top three.”

“I see.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

“But I must tell you that besides the first main peak, there are many people in Thunder Courtyard on all the other main peaks. They are all extremely powerful,” Xiaobai continued.

“There were even more children from the aristocratic families in Zhongzhou in Thunder Courtyard. They have extremely powerful bloodlines flowing in their bodies. Ordinary people definitely can’t compare with them. It is very difficult to stand out among them.

“Even Jiu Xiao, the number one person on Demon-slaying Peak, is only ranked the fifth.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Thunder Courtyard was an indispensable existence for Lizhou, even the entire Holy Region. Naturally, there were countless geniuses.

However, Qin Yu was not afraid. As long as they were in the same cultivation realm, Qin Yu was not afraid of anyone. No matter what bloodline or what kind of heaven-defying physique you had.

“Many thanks.” Qin Yu nodded at Xiaobai.

Xiaobai waved his hand in response.

They chatted for a while before Xiaobai got up and left.

After he left, Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“No matter what, I must get the spot tomorrow.” Qin Yu clenched his fists and thought to himself.

Jue Wu wrinkled her little nose and said, “That little b*stard Jiu Xiao, he might hold a grudge.”

“Xiaobai said he wouldn’t, but who knows?” Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

“It’s fine. If it really doesn’t work, I’ll go by myself. I’ll give you all the points later,” Jue Wu patted Qin Yu’s shoulder to comfort him and said.

Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and shook his head, “This time, I’m not for the points, but to go to Zhongzhou.”

That was the place that Qin Yu had been dreaming of. And it was his only chance to go to Zhongzhou.

The following day.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu arrived at Jiu Xiao’s cave abode early.

In the cave abode, Jiu Xiao and the peak master were playing chess.

The door of the cave abode was tightly closed, and dozens of Devil Hunters of Demon-slaying Peak were waiting outside.

Qin Yu’s heart instantly sank.

They were all Reversion Void Stage cultivators. Jiu Xiao could not possibly forego a Reversion Void Stage cultivator and choose Qin Yu, who was only at the Mighty Realm.

“Qin Yu, you’re here too.” At this moment, someone beside him greeted him.

Qin Yu nodded with a smile in response.

“Qin Yu, you’re only at the Mighty Realm. It’s meaningless for you to go to Zhongzhou. It’s too dangerous.”

“Yes. We all know you want to go to Zhongzhou, but with your cultivation realm, you’ll die if you go there. We’re not going there for fun.”

“You can’t rush in doing things. Take it slow. It won’t be too late to go when you reach the Reversion Void stage.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu knew they had good intentions, but he would never give up.

Therefore, Qin Yu bowed slightly and said, “Thank you for your kind intentions, but I still want to give it a try.”

Seeing this, the people around him no longer tried to persuade him, but just shook their heads.

They all knew how stubborn Qin Yu was. It would be useless to persuade him.

At this moment, the door of Jiu Xiao’s cave abode slowly opened.

Everyone was talking and laughing as they stepped into the cave abode.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and immediately followed them in.

In the cave abode, Jiu Xiao and the peak master stood in front, glancing at the crowd.

When Jiu Xiao’s gaze fell on Qin Yu, he frowned.
