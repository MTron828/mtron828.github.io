He did not care about morality when it came to people like he teng. Rui Yi looked pitiful in front of him.

The few of them threw Rui Yi into a room and locked him up. The scroll that they had painstakingly collected was also taken by He Teng alone.

The battle between Baro and Qu Zhu had reached its climax. The battle had lasted for three days, but there was still no victor.

This shocked Baro greatly. After all, he had cultivated the Sacred Heart technique, and his strength had greatly increased, but he was still at a disadvantage.

More and more people were watching, and everyone was praying and cheering for Qu Zhu. They longed for qu Zhu to stand up under such circumstances and kill Baro!

The situation in the temple of no fate was the same. Perhaps it was because the path of the Hongxi monks was too merciful, and their methods were not as fierce.

After a great battle, the monk of Hongxi gradually fell into a disadvantage and was forced to retreat by Feng Hai.

Another three days passed.

The great battle was finally coming to an end.

The long sword in Qu Zhu’s hand cut through all of Baro’s defenses and stabbed into his throat. Blood immediately gushed out!

He panted slightly and looked down at Baro coldly.

Baro gritted his teeth and said angrily, “Qu Zhu, your strength is stronger than I imagined...”

However, qu Zhu did not want to waste his breath on him. He shook the long sword in his hand and intended to chop off Baro’s head.

However, at this moment, Baro’s figure was drawn into the darkness and disappeared without a trace.

Qu Zhu frowned slightly. He scanned his surroundings and Baro’s figure was long gone.

“Is this the advantage of the northern lands? No wonder Xiao Hai risked his life to cross the river of death,”qu Zhu said in a low voice.

His internal Qi was extremely unstable. Although he had won this battle, he was also severely injured. He would probably need some time to recover.

In the temple of no fate, Feng Hai slapped the monk of Hongxi on his chest. A powerful internal Qi directly penetrated his body.

The monk of Hongxi spat out blood and fell to the ground, unable to get up. His internal Qi instantly became extremely weak.

Soon, news spread throughout the southern region:

Qu Zhu was lucky to win, but he was severely injured and hid in the wind bamboo mountain.

The monk of Hongxi was pierced through by Feng Hai’s palm, and his life was unknown.

“Without Qu Zhu and the monk of Hongxi, I’m afraid the northern region will be even more unbridled...”someone murmured in despair.

“Even they have fallen. Who else in the southern region can stand out...”

At this moment, another piece of news was sent out:

Yongji had issued a challenge to Qin Yu. The location was precisely the Immortal Chuan Mountain where Xiao Hai was buried!

He stood at the side of Xiao Hai’s grave with his hands behind his back, quietly waiting for Qin Yu’s arrival.

Once this news was spread, many people spontaneously came to Immortal Chuan Mountain.

They hid in the dark and quietly watched Yongji on the mountain peak.

“It seems that these three people have a clear division of labor.”Someone Sighed.

“Ever since senior Xiao Hai was buried, Qin Yu has never appeared again. It’s really strange.”

“Yongji has already issued a challenge. I believe that he will definitely come.”

Time passed by minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.

For two whole days, Qin Yu showed no signs of appearing.

This made everyone suspicious. With Qin Yu’s character, he would definitely not be afraid of a battle. However, Yong Ji had already been waiting here for two days. How could he not appear?

Yong Ji opened his eyes slightly. He scanned his surroundings and said indifferently, “It seems that this Qin Yu is just a coward.”

The people around him remained silent. Although they were angry, no one dared to step out.

Another Day passed.

Qin Yu still did not appear.

This made the already arrogant Yong Ji even more impudent.

He scanned his surroundings and shouted, “It seems that Qin Yu doesn’t dare to face me. Does anyone of you dare to step out and fight?”

The people around him remained silent. No one was willing to step out and fight Yong Ji.

Yong ji laughed and said, “They are just a bunch of cowards. Why? Is there no one who dares to come out and fight in the entire South Province?”

“What’s the point of living like you trash?”

Yong Ji continued to curse, but no one dared to come out.

This made the mockery on Yong Ji’s face even more intense. He looked at Xiao Hai’s tombstone and said indifferently, “Xiao Hai, is this the person you risked your life to protect? Do you think it’s worth it for such trash?”

Hearing this, the person in the dark immediately clenched his teeth, and blood rushed to the top of his head.

“Damn it, Yong Ji, what’s there to be arrogant about? I’ll fight with you!”

Finally, someone could not hold it in anymore. He shot out explosively and headed straight for Yong Ji!

Looking at the young man in front of him, Yong Ji could not help but sneer.

“It seems that there are still hot-blooded people in the South Region.”Yong Ji said with a smile that was not a smile.

“F * ck you!”After the young man shouted, all the spells in his body burst out and rushed toward Yong Ji!

However, Yong Ji was too powerful. The spells of this young man were insignificant in front of him.

With a wave of his hand, Yong Ji directly sank into the light, grabbed his neck, and lifted him up.

“You don’t know life from death,”Yong Ji said with a smile that was not a smile.

“It’s good that young people have courage, but...”

“F * ck you, do you think you’re qualified to lecture me? Even if I die, I’ll drag you down with me!”The young man shouted and interrupted Yong Ji’s Bullsh * t!

Then, the young man’s body emitted thousands of lights. Before Yong Ji could react, a terrifying explosion exploded!

A powerful shockwave swept out in all directions, and Immortal Chuan Mountain was instantly affected.

Even the people hiding in the dark were affected. Some of them fell out of the void!

“He... he actually chose to self-destruct!”Someone exclaimed.

“He would rather die than be humiliated. Truly admirable...”

The young man’s actions immediately affected countless people, and many of them walked out from the void!

Yong Ji, who was standing on the peak of the mountain, had an extremely cold expression on his face.

Although the power of the self-explosion was not fatal, it still shattered a few of his ribs and wound after wound appeared on his body.

Yong Ji’s expression became increasingly gloomy as he coldly said, “To actually be injured by a trash like you... very good. You guys have made me very unhappy. I’ve decided to kill all of you!”

After saying that, Yong Ji looked at the people in front of him!

“Yong Ji, we are not afraid of You!”Someone with a ferocious expression shouted!

However, Yong Ji laughed out loud and said, “That Qin Yu doesn’t dare to come out and let you bunch of trash come and throw your lives away, right? Alright, since that’s the case, I will satisfy all of you!”

After saying that, Yong Ji shot towards this group of people!

However, at this moment, a white figure flashed past and blocked in front of Yong Ji.
