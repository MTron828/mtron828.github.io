Chapter 1549: Chapter 1,549, giving him a taste of his own medicine

Looking at the continuously increasing price, Qin Yu knew in his heart that he had no chance at all.

He sat there, feeling extremely conflicted. He was even whipped and tortured.

Whether or not he should forcefully occupy it, this made Qin Yu unable to make up his mind.

The Beast Spirit Pill formula was finally sold for 800 million.

The person who took the pill formula was an extremely ordinary-looking old man.

His clothes were extremely plain, and he didn’t look like someone from a wealthy family.

This made Qin Yu, who was already in a dilemma, feel even more guilty.

“This time’s Qingyan forest auction ends here. Everyone, please leave in an orderly manner,”Xia ze said.

Those who didn’t manage to get anything left one after another.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu stood up and followed Xia ze backstage.

They walked all the way to the backstage. The bronze coffin was placed in an extremely conspicuous position.

Coincidentally, the old man who obtained the Beast Spirit Pill formula happened to be next to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but glance at him a few more times, trying to determine his strength.

......

But unfortunately, in this castle, no one’s internal Qi could be detected.

“Old Sir, I’m sorry,”Qin Yu said in his heart.

He finished the procedures backstage, then put the bronze coffin into the spatial magic artifact.

After putting away the bronze coffin, Qin Yu couldn’t help but glance at Xia ze twice.

It had to be said that this Xia Ze’s appearance was extremely flirtatious. Her charm wasn’t ordinary, but a kind of feeling that made people unable to extricate themselves.

“This Xia Ze... who exactly is he?”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

The person who walked out from the depths of the green rock forest was definitely not an ordinary person.

With Qin Yu’s current strength, he probably did not have the qualifications to investigate clearly.

After taking the bronze coffin, Qin Yu turned around and left the castle. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Outside the castle, many sects were bitterly waiting.

Many rogue cultivators who served the sect were mercilessly kicked away after handing over their treasures to the sect.

The conditions that they had previously agreed upon were all gone.

These sects flatly denied it, allowing the rogue cultivator to beg and plead. They were unmoved.

Some rogue cultivators couldn’t swallow their anger and attacked the sect. In the end, they died.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer in his heart.

Sure enough, none of these sects were good.

At this moment, Li Feng brought the young man and walked toward Qin Yu.

The various sects that Qin Yu had entrusted to them also came to Qin Yu.

They surrounded Qin Yu and couldn’t leave.

Li Feng took the lead and took a step forward. He said with a smile, “Little friend, how was it? Did you gain anything from this auction?”

“Of course. I got quite a lot,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

Li Feng was delighted and quickly said, “What did you get? Hurry up and take it out.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “There’s no rush. Give me the commission you promised me first. I will naturally give you the treasure.”

As soon as he said this, a cold smile flashed across Li Feng’s face.

The young man next to him even mocked, “What commission? Kid, what are you talking about?”

The other sects surrounding Qin Yu also said, “Kid, are you still asleep? Commission? What Commission? Where’s the Commission?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer, “It seems that everyone is planning to go back on their word. is it appropriate to be so untrustworthy?”

“Young man, you must understand that both sides can only be trustworthy if they are established on an equal footing. Do you think you are equal to us?”Li Feng said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization and nodded, “So that’s what you mean. Our status is indeed not equal. Then, please make way for us.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

Li Feng stretched out his hand and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

He said with a gloomy face, “Little friend, what do you mean?”

Qin Yu said sarcastically, “Nothing. I want to leave. Why?”

“Hand over the thing. You can go wherever you want,”Li Feng said coldly.

Qin Yu imitated their tone and said, “Thing? What Thing? What are you talking about? Why don’t I Understand?”

Li Feng was stunned, and then he said angrily, “Kid, are you playing me again? Where’s the thing you got at the auction?”

“That’s what I got. What does it have to do with you?”Qin Yu ridiculed.

Li Feng narrowed his eyes and said, “You took our money.”

“Your Money? What do you mean your money? How come I don’t Know? That’s my own money.”Qin Yu sneered.

“Are you F * cking courting death! You want to play dirty?”The young man beside Li Feng said angrily.

Qin Yu sneered, “Honesty is a conversation based on equal status. Do you think you are equal to me?”

At this moment, Li Feng and the others also understood.

This Qin Yu was obviously playing with them!

“Kid, you dare to play with us. I’m afraid you are tired of living.”Li Feng’s body emitted waves of killing intent.

The people from the other sects also slowly walked towards Qin Yu. They could attack him at any time.

“Elder Li, let me teach this kid a lesson!”The junior beside Li Feng shouted.

After he finished speaking, he directly attacked Qin Yu’s vital point!

Qin Yu stood there without moving at all. He only looked at him coldly.

“Bang!”

His fist smashed into Qin Yu’s chest. The impact was like steel, causing the young man’s wrist to hurt. He was forced to take two steps back!

“Huh? How could this be?”The young man was stunned.

Qin Yu swept his cold eyes across the crowd and said, “I advise you all to scram immediately. Otherwise, you will lose more than just money.”

“You are courting death!”The young man was unconvinced and charged at Qin Yu again!

This time, Qin Yu did not sit still and wait for death. He waved his hand and a slap landed on his face!

With just a slap, that young man’s head and primordial spirit were directly smashed into pieces!

Seeing this scene, everyone gasped!

A slap that shattered a primordial spirit? What kind of strength was this? Could it be that this kid was pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger?

“You dared to kill our Fenghuo Tower’s people. You have to pay the price for this!”Li Feng said coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking, before he could make a move, Qin Yu had already slapped him.

Another slap! The same result again!

Li Feng’s head along with his primordial spirit directly exploded! Before he died, he did not even know what had happened!

Everyone was stunned! What kind of strength was this? A slap that killed an elder of the Beacon Tower?

“Who... Who Are You!”Someone shouted.

Qin Yu’s internal Qi slowly spread out.

Rays of golden light appeared on his body.

A terrifying pressure rushed over. Everyone present felt a huge mountain pressing down on them. Even walking was extremely difficult!
