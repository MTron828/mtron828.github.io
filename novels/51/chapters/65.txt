Perhaps because of Yan Ruoxue, Wei Jiang treated Qin Yu quite politely.

On the way to the Wei family’s home, Wei Jiang said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, my wife’s illness is quite serious, and it just so happens that there is already an international treatment plan. She can be considered lucky.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Wei Jiang was extremely tactful, but Qin Yu could still discern Wei Jiang’s meaning. He was insinuating Qin Yu from the side that he didn’t need to treat her illness.

“Mr. Wei, if your wife has a better treatment plan, that would naturally be the best. Our goal is for your wife to be healthy,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Wei Jiang was instantly overjoyed.

He hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Qin, don’t worry. I won’t let you come for nothing this time. I’ve already prepared a gift for you. You must accept it.”

“That’s not necessary.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Mr. Qin, just accept it. Our family doesn’t like to owe others a favor,” said Wei Hang.

This was the truth. Wei Jiang never owed others a favor.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and nodded in agreement.

The car drove to the Wei family’s home and soon stopped at a high-end residential area.

Then, Qin Yu followed Wei Jiang all the way upstairs.

In the room, besides some other people, there was a young man in his thirties.

The young man was dressed very elegantly and he spoke eloquently. He had the demeanor of a successful elite.

“Mr. Xu.” Wei Jiang walked over and shook hands with the young man.

The man called Mr. Xu nodded. Then, he looked at Qin Yu with a puzzled look in his eyes.

Seeing this, Wei Jiang quickly introduced, “This is Dr. Xu Majun. He has been studying abroad for many years and has just returned to the country.”

Then, Wei Jiang looked at Qin Yu and said, “This is Mr. Qin.”

After that, Wei Jiang stood to the side and didn’t say anything else.

Yao Qing couldn’t help but frown and immediately added, “Mr. Qin specially came from Jiangcheng to examine Mrs. Wei.”

Hearing this, Wei Jiang’s face immediately showed an awkward expression.

Mr. Xu frowned even more and said somewhat unhappily, “Mr. Wei, what do you mean? You don’t trust me?”

“No, no, no.” Wei Jiang hurriedly shook his head.

“Mr. Xu, please don’t misunderstand. Mr. Qin is only here as accompaniment.” Wei Jiang braced himself and said.

Xu Maojun glanced at Qin Yu and then snorted, “It’s okay as accompaniment, but I’m warning you. I don’t like to be disturbed when I’m treating patients.”

Displeasure flashed across Yao Qing’s face. He was about to speak when Qin Yu reached out and stopped him.

“Mr. Qin, please drink some water first. I’ll accompany Mr. Xu for the examination,” Wei Jiang said politely.

Then, Wei Jiang and Mr. Xu walked into the bedroom together.

In the living room, Wei Hang poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu and Yao Qing. Then, he smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, are you a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner?”

“Er... you can say that.” Qin Yu nodded.

In the medical inheritance left by his father, silver needles were indeed used. It should have some connection with traditional Chinese medicine.

However, after he heard these words, a hint of contempt flashed across Wei Hang’s face.

“Don’t you know that traditional Chinese medicine is all a lie?” Wei Hang said with slight derision.

Qin Yu wasn’t angry. The traditional Chinese medicine world had indeed been tarnished by a bunch of swindlers.

“Some diseases can only be treated by traditional Chinese medicine. Both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have their own advantages and disadvantages,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Wei Hang shook his head and didn’t say anything else.

Time passed minute by minute. After about half an hour, Wei Jiang and Xu Maojun finally walked out.

“Mr. Wei, don’t worry about your wife’s illness. It’s just caused by low blood sugar,” Xu Maojun said nonchalantly.

“Oh right, in traditional Chinese medicine, it’s called Qi and Yang imbalance caused by low blood sugar. It leads to physical and mental fatigue.” At this time, Xu Maojun looked at Qin Yu provocatively.

In reality, Qin Yu didn’t understand any of this at all. He had never studied traditional Chinese medicine, so he naturally didn’t understand these professional terms.

Beside him, Wei Jiang sighed and said, “We have gone to the hospital to check and the hospital has said the same thing. But after taking so many medicines, she hasn’t been cured at all.”

Xu Maojun said a little proudly, “The hospital resources in Chuzhou aren’t good. Their equipment and herbs have already fallen behind the foreign countries for many years, so naturally she wouldn’t be cured.”

After Xu Maojun said that, he took out a small blue bottle and handed it to Wei Jiang. He said nonchalantly, “This is the latest research product from the foreign countries. It’s far more effective than that of the backward Pyro. As long as you give it to your wife to take a few times, she will be able to recover fully.”

Hearing Xu Maojun’s words, Yao Qing couldn’t help but snort softly as he said, “What a foreign worshiper. Having studied abroad for so many years, all you have learned is how to kiss up to them, haven’t you?”

As soon as these words were said, the expressions of the people in the room changed drastically!

Especially Xu Maojun, who even scolded, “Mr. Qin, please discipline your subordinate!”

“He isn’t my subordinate, but my friend. Moreover, I think what he said is right,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

Xu Maojun’s every move had a foreign-worshipping air. When he mentioned his own country, his face was full of disdain, but when he mentioned foreign countries, his face was full of pride, which really made people feel disgusted.

Xu Maojun snickered and said, “What, I’m not allowed to say that this country lagging behind?”

“We can catch up if we are lagging behind, but Pyro is the place where we were born and raised, and we shouldn’t look down upon it.” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

When Xu Maojun heard that, he couldn’t help but laugh out loud and say, “I’m sorry, I have already obtained a green card overseas. Strictly speaking, I am no longer a citizenr of Pyro.”

Qin Yu looked coldly at Xu Maojun and said, “From the tone of your voice, I can tell what kind of person you are.”

“Oh really?” Xu Maojun raised an eyebrow.

“What kind of person do you think I am?” Xu Maojun asked with a tinge of amusement.

Qin Yu snickered and said, “You’re a traitorous person who throws your own country under the bus and kisses up to outsiders! A person like you definitely won’t have any outstanding medical skills. To be more precise, a person like you won’t be able to learn anything at all.”

“Therefore, I doubt your diagnosis!”

Qin Yu’s words were sonorous and powerful, making it hard for people to trivialize them!
