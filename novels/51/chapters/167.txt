Chapter 168: Xiao Yu Gets Teased Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Take it away quickly! Take it away quickly!”

Xiao Yu didn’t have the guts to look at this parasite. She hurriedly covered her eyes and kept stepping back.

Qin Yu handed the parasite to Mr. Wu and said in a sullen voice, “Mr. Wu, this is probably a parasite from the southwest.”

Mr. Wu looked at the parasite in Qin Yu’s hand with a serious expression and said in a sullen voice, “I didn’t expect that two little worms would be so terrifying.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There are many experts in the southwest who use parasites for good purposes. This is no big deal.”

“I think you should think about whether you have offended anyone.” Qin Yu said seriously.

Mr. Wu forced a smile and said, “In my position, do you think it is possible not to offend anyone?”

This was the truth. To climb to this position, who knew how many people he stepped on?

Even Lu Shuming had countless enemies, let alone a leader of a military district?

Qin Yu’s hands lit up with spiritual fire to burn these two parasites into ashes.

“There shouldn’t be any problems in the future.” Qin Yu looked at the pale Xiao Yu.

This matter probably had a great impact on her.

“Mr. Wu, if you have time, spend more time with your child.” Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and said.

Mr. Wu nodded and said, “Okay, I will.”

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first,” Qin Yu said to Mr. Wu and then left.

After returning to the hotel, Qin Yu didn’t sleep for a long time.

All he could think about was the mass of black energy that surged into his body.

Qin Yu looked down at his palm and muttered, “Can I really absorb dark energy?”

At this moment, Qin Yu had mixed feelings. He was both happy and worried. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

What he was happy about was that apart from using spiritual energy, there was another way to cultivate.

What he was worried about was that people who used dark energy to cultivate were usually not good people. They didn’t have good endings.

“What a catch-22.” Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

He didn’t continue to think about it. He would just take it one step at a time.

The next day, Qin Yu planned to go out for a walk and salvage some herbs along the way.

At this moment, Wei Ming called Qin Yu.

He smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, didn’t I promise to bring you to look for herbs last time? I wonder if you are free tonight?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Of course. I was just planning to go out.”

Wei Ming laughed and said, “Then I’ll see you tonight. I know the provincial capital like the back of my hand.”

“Okay, then I’ll have to trouble you.” Qin Yu agreed and then hung up the phone.

Since he had Wei Ming’s help, Qin Yu canceled his plans for today.

In the evening, Qin Yu’s cell phone rang again.

But what surprised Qin Yu was that this call was from Xiao Yu.

She said in surprise over the phone, “Qin Yu, I actually didn’t have a nightmare last night. How amazing!”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Now you believe what I said?”

Xiao Yu said on the other end, “I really didn’t expect you to be so capable.”

“Alright, is there anything else? If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up,” said Qin Yu.

“How dare you?!” Xiao Yu immediately shouted from the other end.

“Why don’t you act like a gentleman at all?” Xiao Yu said unhappily.

Qin Yu said somewhat helplessly, “Then what else do you have? Hurry up and say it.”

Xiao Yu said with a grin, “You’ve helped me a lot. I’ll treat you to a meal tonight as a way to repay you.”

“No need. It’s just a small matter. Besides, I have something to do tonight,” said Qin Yu.

Xiao Yu glared at him and said, “No way! I mustered up the courage to invite you, but you dare to refuse? Do you know how many people want to treat me to a meal?”

“Then you can go eat with them. I’m not free anyway,” Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said.

After saying that, Qin Yu was about to hang up the phone.

At this moment, Xiao Yu shouted from the other end, “If you don’t go, I’ll look for my dad and ask him to look for you!”

Qin Yu rubbed his head. These spoiled and pampered heiresses were really troublesome.

At the same time, this also made Qin Yu feel that someone like Yan Ruoxue was even more precious.

“Alright, don’t bother your dad. I’ll go with you. Alright?” Qin Yu said helplessly.

Xiao Yu was pleasantly surprised. “Then what are we going to eat? How about barbecue?”

Qin Yu didn’t think about it and agreed, “Okay.”

Then, Qin Yu drove to Mr. Wu’s house.

Xiao Yu had been waiting here for a long time and had specially dressed up. She wore a small t-shirt on her upper body and a pink short skirt underneath. She looked cute, yet slightly mature.

After seeing Qin Yu’s car, Xiao Yu said with some surprise, “Hey, it’s an Audi RS7, a high-performance car.”

“You know quite a lot,” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Xiao Yu snorted and said, “I know a lot of car enthusiasts. They know more than you do!”

That was the truth. Qin Yu didn’t know anything about performance. He just needed it to run fast and be convenient.

After getting into the car, Xiao Yu said, “I know a barbecue stall that’s very delicious. I’ll take you there!”

Qin Yu had no objections because he didn’t care anyway.

The car sped along and soon stopped in front of a relatively remote barbecue stall.

“This place looks unremarkable, but the taste is superb!” Xiao Yu said while drooling.

Qin Yu said jokingly, “Rich heiresses also eat roadside stalls?”

Xiao Yu sighed and said somewhat helplessly, “Usually, my father doesn’t let me eat it and saying that it’s dirty. Today, I finally found an opportunity.”

“Do you want to treat me to a meal, or use me as an excuse?” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

“Half and half.” Xiao Yu waved her hand.

Then, the two of them found a seat and sat down. Xiao Yu was quite generous when she ordered the dishes, and she asked the owner to serve them one of each dish.

After the dishes were served, Xiao Yu kept stuffing food into her mouth. She didn’t look like a wealthy heiress at all.

A gentle breeze blew on them quite comfortably.

At this moment, a few men at the next table looked over with lecherous looks in their eyes.

Their eyes were fixed on the bottom of Xiao Yu’s skirt, and their faces were full of lust. Some of them even whistled.

“Be careful not to expose yourself,” Qin Yu reminded her.

Only then did Xiao Yu notice that her skirt was blown up by the wind from time to time.

She glared at the group of tattooed guys at the table next to them. She scolded, “Go home and look at your mothers instead. If you keep looking, I’ll dig out your eyeballs!”

The tattooed guys at the next table giggled and said, “Young lady, you have quite a temper.”

“Aren’t you dressed so sl*tty just for us to see?”

“Since you’re so sl*tty, can your boyfriend satisfy you? Do you need help from us?”
