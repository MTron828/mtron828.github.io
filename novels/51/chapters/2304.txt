2305 Heading to the Ninth Level

“A person who only knows sneak attack. I will remember today’s humiliation.”

“Are you scolding yourself?” Qin Yu almost laughed out of anger.

He punched out, but Ying Zi’s body actually “melted” and his body merged into the shadow on the ground.

And then he instantly fled. His speed was so fast that Qin Yu found it difficult to lock onto him with his divine sense.

The remaining Xing Mou and Wu Shan looked at each other.

“Qin Yu, don’t be smug. There’ll be a day when you die under my arrows.”

Xing Mou said coldly and turned to leave.

“Did I let you go? I remember you were the one who brought my brother’s hand to me, didn’t you?”

Qin Yu instantly arrived in front of him.

“Bang!”

Qin Yu’s punch straightaway blew up Xing Mou’s head.

“Coward.”

Wu Shan spat out a mouthful of blood and rushed toward Qin Yu.

However, Xi Menn’s sword strike had already severely injured him, and his internal qi was extremely weak.

“You may go. I’ll fight you again when you recover.”

Qin Yu directly turned around and left, returning to his mountain peak.

Wu Shan gave him the feeling that he was Chang Mang. Moreover, neither party held a deep-seated grudge. Qin Yu thus did not kill him.

“Qin Yu, how did your speed become so fast?”

Mei Li said in surprise. Qin Yu’s speed just now indeed shocked her.

“I gained something by chance during my comprehension when I was on the mountain peak.”

Qin Yu did not explain further.

Mei Li could not hide her shocked expression.

Previously, when Ying Zi approached him, he could not sense any internal qi at all.

Qin Yu continued to sit cross-legged on the peak and continued to comprehend the power of the Path of Heaven.

Half a day passed, but Qin Yu still gained nothing.

The power of the Path of Heaven seemed constantly flowing away at every moment.

“Qin Yu, Xiao Yu has woken up. Do you want to come in and see her?”

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment before letting everyone out.

If he entered the ring of Sumeru, everyone inside would die on the spot once Mei Li damaged the Sumeru ring.

He was naturally concerned about Mei Li, whom he had not known for long.

“Who is this? Qin Yu! Don’t tell me you’ve had a change of heart! I want to tell Sister Ruoxue!”

Xiao Yu stared at Mei Li, and her expression changed drastically.

Qin Yu was overjoyed. The previous Xiao Yu was back.

“Xiao Yu, do you remember what happened previously?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“I recalled for a long time just now and seemed to have lost some of my memories. I was here the moment I woke up.”

Xiao Yu said in a daze.

The man with the mustache suddenly gathered his spiritual power and slapped Xiao Yu.

“Man with the Mustache, what are you doing?”

Qin Yu panicked.

However, almost instantly, a terrifying spiritual energy erupted from Xiao Yu’s body, and she hit the man with the mustache with her palm.

Eight faint visions of the Path of Heaven merged into one and turned into a palm that struck the man with the mustache.

“Boom!”

The man with the mustache was sent flying, and a tortoiseshell pattern magical artifact appeared on his body.

An ancient bronze door blocked his way, and the necklace around his neck lit up, turning into an egg-shaped giant shell again wrapped around him.

The three magical artifacts suddenly shattered into pieces and fell to the ground after the qi energy dissipated.

“My three Saint Weapons!”

The man with the mustache let out a shrill scream. He looked like he felt like crying but was unable to shed tears. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Xiao Yu looked at her own hands in a daze.

“F*ck, you have so many treasures! You refused to lend me any when I borrowed from you previously.”

Qin Yu looked at the fragments of the treasures on the ground and was instantly furious.

“Nonsense, these are for self-defense. Of course, I can’t simply lend to you.”

The man with the mustache said unhappily.

“It seems that my guess was right. Even after the masked woman has left Xiao Yu’s body, her instincts are still there. As long as Xiao Yu is familiar with the combat instincts in her body, this little girl is definitely a top-notch cultivator.”

The man with the mustache man said somewhat shockingly.

She had just awakened and had used the instinct to attack with such terrifying power. This was indeed terrifying.

“Oh yes, you haven’t told me who this woman is.”

Xiao Yu suddenly remembered what had just happened and grabbed Qin Yu’s clothes fiercely.

“We’re friends, don’t misunderstand.”

Qin Yu had a headache. Why did this woman keep focusing on this matter?

“Hmph! Don’t you dare lie to me! If I find out you’ve let Sister Ruoxue down, I’ll cut that thing off!”

Xiao Yu glared at Qin Yu’s lower body fiercely, and that fierce gaze made Qin Yu’s anger rise.

He finally managed to coax Xiao Yu and sent her and the others back to the Sumeru Ring.

“Man with the Mustache, you answer this little girl’s question properly.”

Qin Yu said to the man with the mustache and quickly left the Sumeru ring.

“You f*cking answer it yourself. I’m not free.”

The man with the mustache cursed, but Qin Yu had already left the Sumeru ring.

Looking at Xiao Yu’s sinister gaze, the man with the mustache could not help but shudder. He did not have so many magical artifacts to block Xiao Yu’s attacks anymore.

Upon return to the mountain peak, Qin Yu sat cross-legged again, hoping to pry into a trace of the power of Path of Heaven again.

However, even though he activated the desolate divine eye, he still found nothing.

“You’ve noticed it too, right? The power of the Path of Heaven above the True Saint is nearly gone.”

Mei Li looked at the sky.

“Mmm.”

Qin Yu nodded. His expression was extremely ugly. He had indeed missed this round of the Great Dao.

He could only return to the Holy Region if he wanted to break through. That was a distant and uncertain path.

“Let’s go to the ninth level of purgatory together?”

Suddenly, a voice rang out. It was Xi Menn.

“Let’s go.”

Qin Yu did not hesitate at all.

The Sumeru Qi he needed was on the ninth level. According to the Pavillion Master of the Moon Listening Pavilion, a Mystic Realm seemed to have connected to the Holy Region on the ninth level. He had to go there eventually.

“Are you guys crazy? That place was a place with a slim chance of survival.”

Hearing that the two were going to the ninth level, Mei Li exclaimed.

Xi Menn jumped into the air directly and flew toward the ninth level on his sword.

Qin Yu also moved in a flash and caught up with Xi Menn’s pace.

“Two lunatics.”

Mei Li said with a frown.

“Why did you help me earlier?”

Qin Yu looked at the young man before him and asked with a frown.

“I don’t know.”

Xi Menn answered without thinking.

…

“What do you need to get from the ninth level of the Mystic Realm?”

“I’m going to train my sword intent. I can’t comprehend sword intent here anymore.” Xi Menn only answered when asked.

Qin Yu did not know what to say anymore.

After flying at high speed for two days, Qin Yu was also a little tired, even though he had incomparably dense spiritual energy.

At this moment, he took out a few Spirit Pills and swallowed them. He also gave it to Xi Menn.
