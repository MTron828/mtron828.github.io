Chapter 1368: Chapter 1,368, shattering the Barrier 1

After experiencing this battle, Wen Wanji could be said to have become famous in one battle.

He, who was already famous in the Southern Province, was now even more famous in the world.

If he were to rise at this moment, he would definitely be able to establish a huge sect.

However, what was strange was that after that, Wen Wanji disappeared and never appeared again.

Heavenly Cloud sect.

The sect master’s face was ashen, and in front of them, there were two people kneeling.

One was the first elder, and the other was the vice sect master.

“Sect master, we didn’t expect that Wen Wanli would have such strength...”the first elder knelt on the ground, his face filled with panic.

It was as if this battle had left an indelible shadow in his heart.

“That’s right, we have completely underestimated Wen Wanli’s strength...”the deputy sect master said as well.

The sect master remained silent, but his face was as dark as water.

After a moment, the sect master slowly said, “It’s because of the eight devil technique. You Can’t be blamed for this.”

Hearing this, the first elder and the deputy sect master finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“Sect master, then what should we do next? Wen Wanli seems to have escaped.”The first elder asked.

The sect master shook his head and said, “It doesn’t matter. Our target is not Wen Wanli, but Qin Yu.”

“Pass down the order to search for Qin Yu with all our strength.”

“Yes!”

...

On the crater of the volcano, Qin Yu was still steadily increasing his strength.

He could clearly feel the improvement of this flame on his physical body.

In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.

On this day, Qin Yu walked out of the flames.

“How is it?”Wen Da and Wen Er hurriedly came up and asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “My physical body has indeed improved greatly, but there should still be a certain distance to the return to void stage.”

“Then don’t waste time. Continue,”Wen da urged.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I have already encountered a bottleneck. I haven’t felt anything for a few days in a row.”

Wen Da looked at the spatial barrier and said, “Then do you have a way to break it?”

“Almost. I can try.”Qin Yu looked at the illusory spatial barrier in front of her.

Qin Yu reached out and touched the spatial barrier. The barrier was like a layer of glass. Although it couldn’t be seen, it did exist.

“Hurry up. Don’t waste time.”Wen Da was extremely anxious.

They couldn’t wait to know the relevant information about Wen Wanji.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and directly activated the fighting word formula.

In an instant, a terrifying power condensed on his right fist.

“Boom!”

A golden light streaked past and ruthlessly smashed towards the barrier in front of him.

“Clang!”

A loud sound accompanied by a terrifying recoil force erupted, directly forcing Qin Yu to take a few steps back.

And in front of the spatial barrier, only a crack appeared.

“So Hard,”Qin Yu said in surprise

As expected of the spatial barrier set up by Wen Wanyi, it was indeed terrifying!

“Soon, soon, come on!”Wen Da and Wen Er hurriedly helped Qin Yu up.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to hide his strength anymore, and directly opened the fifth level of the fighting word formula.

His strength increased once again. Qin Yu clenched his right fist and ruthlessly smashed it toward the crack!

“Clang! Clang!”

After two consecutive punches, the spatial barrier finally could not withstand it anymore. It shattered like pieces of glass!

“That’s Great!”Wen Da and Wen Er were instantly overjoyed. Without saying anything else, they ran down the mountain.

The two of them, who loved to play, couldn’t hold it in anymore after holding it in for so long.

“Is this the smell of Freedom?”Wen Da sniffed the air around him.

“Let’s go. Let’s leave this damn place quickly,”Wen er said hurriedly.

They took out the flying beasts from their space divine artifacts, planning to leave this damn place.

“It’s better to put away your flying beasts.”At this time, Qin Yu shook his head.

“The Heavenly Cloud sect must be looking for us now. It’s better to keep a low profile.”

The two of them nodded, as if they felt what Qin Yu said made sense.

Fortunately, Wen Da and Wen Er knew the way, so it wasn’t difficult for them to walk out of here.

They spent three days to return to Dayue City again.

There was only one reason why they returned to Dayue City, and that was to get information about Wen Wanli.

“Wait for me here.”Qin Yu brought the two of them to a relatively safe location.

“I’ll go find out more information.”

Wen Da and Wen er nodded and said, “Then you be careful.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He didn’t have any spiritual energy fluctuations. As long as he covered his face, he could basically guarantee his safety.

They arrived at the largest restaurant in Dayue City.

There were many people here, and it wasn’t a high-end restaurant.

Many rumors would spread from here.

Qin Yu lowered his hat and casually found two seats to sit down. Then, he ordered a few dishes and secretly listened to the news around him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The battle between Wen Wanye and the heavenly cloud sect could be said to be the biggest news in recent times. It was almost spread everywhere.

The table beside Qin Yu was even more boastful.

“I saw it with my own eyes that day. After Wen Wanye used the eight demons, he beat the head elder of the Heavenly Cloud sect to a pulp!”

“Is Wen Wanye really that fierce?”

“Yeah, the eight demons was Wen Wanye’s famous skill. It’s said that Wen Wanye accidentally killed his own son when he used the eight demons. He hasn’t used this skill since then!”

“No Wonder Wen Wanyi dotes on his two grandsons.”

“What’s the use? Wen Wanyi did kill a lot of people from the Heavenly Cloud sect, but now he’s also on the run.”

“That’s true...”

Hearing the discussions around them, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be frightened.

From what they described, not only did Wen Wanyi not die, but he also killed a lot of people from the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“The eight demons...”Qin Yu muttered the name.

Wen Wentong had also taught this technique to Qin Yu, but Qin Yu had never comprehended it.

From what they had said, the eight demons was clearly a rare technique.

“As long as there’s nothing else, it’s enough.”Qin Yu stood up and did not stay any longer. She turned around and left.

When she returned, Wen Da and Wen Er were discussing something.

When they saw Qin Yu, they hurriedly asked, “How is he? How is my grandfather?”

“Don’t worry, master is fine,”Qin Yu said.

Then, Qin Yu told Wen Da and Wen er what she had seen and heard.

When the two of them heard the words “Eight devils,”their expressions were obviously unnatural, and there was even a hint of fear.
