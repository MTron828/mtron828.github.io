Old Mister Yan stared at the content on the screen.

After a while, a relieved smile appeared on his face.

“This kid isn’t bad.” Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“That kid from the Han family is probably fuming now.” Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but shake his head.

Yan Ruoxue’s beautiful eyes shone with a strange light. She had always been worried that Qin Yu would run into Han Wei, and what would happen if he did.

She had thought that Qin Yu would temporarily avoid the Han family and wait for an opportunity to make a move.

However, she hadn’t expected that Qin Yu would actually take the initiative to provoke Han Wei, and make him unable to back down.

Han Wei was in a dilemma.

This method was brilliant!

Now that the entire martial arts world knew about this matter, if Han Wei suppressed Qin Yu, wouldn’t that be admitting that he was incompetent?

“Qin Yu...” Yan Ruoxue muttered this name in a low voice. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

She wished that she could immediately fly to Qin Yu’s side.

“Cough cough!”

At this moment, Old Mister Yan actually started coughing violently.

“Grandpa, what’s wrong?” Yan Ruoxue hurriedly supported Old Mister Yan.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand weakly and said, “I’m old. My body can’t hold on anymore.”

“Grandpa, are you... are you sick?” Yan Ruoxue looked a little worried.

Old Mister Yan smiled and said, “I’m fine, so don’t worry. No matter what, I can hold on until you and Qin Yu get married.”

“I won’t be able to die without seeing my good granddaughter get married, Haha.”

Although his tone was nonchalant, in reality, there was a heavy expression on his face.

...

At this time, Qin Yu had already swallowed all eight pills.

He had already been stuck at the peak of the Foundation Establishment Stage for a long time. If he was unable to break through this time, then it would be very difficult for Qin Yu to defeat Chi Feng.

Time passed minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

There were only four days left before the fight with Chi Feng.

The valley was quiet and peaceful. Even the sky was clear.

“This doesn’t seem like a sign of a breakthrough.” Gu Taichu put his hands behind his back.

“Could it be that... Qin Yu can’t trigger the heavenly tribulation at the Foundation Establishment Stage?”

However, Gu Taichu thought that with Qin Yu’s talent, he would definitely trigger the heavenly tribulation!

Finally, on the fourth day, Qin Yu opened his eyes.

However, his internal qi didn’t change much.

“I can’t break through...” This made Qin Yu’s expression turn ugly.

One had to know that there were eight Earth Rank pills that were refined from a once in a thousand year Divine Medicine!

Moreover, Qin Yu could clearly feel that the breakthrough point was right in front of him.

“My current realm is enough for me to break through to the Monastic Stage, but I failed. Could it be that a once in a thousand year Divine Medicine is already unable to satisfy a small breakthrough?” Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

If that was the case, how difficult would his future cultivation path be?

Qin Yu’s expression was heavy as he walked out of the valley.

“Qin Yu, how is it?” Gu Taichu and Yao Qing hurriedly walked up.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I failed.”

“What? You failed?” Gu Taichu’s eyes widened.

He murmured, “A once in a thousand year Divine Medicine is enough to advance several levels in the Monastic Stage. How could it fail?”

Qin Yu was also puzzled. That was a once in a thousand year Divine Medicine!

“I know,” Gu Taichu suddenly said excitedly.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Taichu and waited for him to continue.

“It is said that the more talented a person is, the more spiritual energy they need to break through from the Foundation Establishment Stage.”

“Qin Yu, even a once in a thousand year Divine Medicine can’t help you break through from the Foundation Establishment Stage. Your future is full of potential!”

Gu Taichu was a little excited, and he couldn’t hide the excitement on his face.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He had considered this possibility.

After all, the Foundation Establishment Stage required more spiritual energy to lay a foundation on the path of cultivation. It wasn’t a bad thing.

Because this would stabilize the foundation.

But... what should he do about Chi Feng?

With Qin Yu’s current strength, it was impossible for him to fight Chi Feng.

“Qin Yu, don’t fight Chi Feng.” At this moment, Gu Taichu said.

Qin Yu frowned. He was about to speak when Gu Taichu continued, “If you die now, it’s not worth it.”

“But... Master Gu, forgive me for being blunt, but you are no match for Chi Feng,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Gu Taichu smiled brightly. “It’s okay. I’m old and have lived for too long. If I die, so be it.”

“But you’re different. Your future is still very long. You can’t die at this time.”

Qin Yu didn’t know what to say.

He was silent for a while. Then, he looked at Gu Taichu and said, “Master Gu, let me do it. I’ve already thought of a way to deal with it.”

Gu Taichu frowned. “Qin Yu, this isn’t realistic at all. I didn’t fulfill my promise to your father. How can I let you fight Chi Feng for me?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Master Gu, don’t push it. Do you think that even if you fight Chi Feng, he will let me go?”

“For him, now is a good time to establish his power. If he can kill me, he can also occupy a powerful position in Chuzhou.”

Although Chuzhou wasn’t very good in terms of its martial arts community, its economic development was still very good. Who knew how many people were eyeing this lucrative opportunity?

Chi Feng was naturally no exception.

Gu Taichu didn’t know what to do for a moment.

“Master Gu, trust me.” Qin Yu’s gaze was firm.

Their eyes met, and Gu Taichu was actually moved by Qin Yu’s gaze for a moment.

“Okay!” Gu Taichu nodded his head vigorously.

After that, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and continued to enter closed door cultivation.

Qin Yu knew very clearly inside that whether it was in terms of realm or internal qi, he couldn’t be compared to Chi Feng.

The only thing that could contend with him was his physical body!

Qin Yu’s physical body wasn’t inferior to Chi Feng’s, and even surpassed his.

As long as he could let Qin Yu get close to him, there was still a chance of victory.

After the battle with Gu Taichu, Qin Yu had already discovered his own weakness.

Chi Feng’s speed probably wouldn’t be slower than Gu Taichu’s, Qin Yu thought inside.

Since that was the case, then Qin Yu definitely had to learn a more powerful cultivation technique.

Thus, Qin Yu closed his eyes.

At the crucial moment, he still had to rely on the inheritance treasury left behind by his father.

Numerous pieces of information flooded into Qin Yu’s mind.

Finally, a technique called Shrinking Ground Into An Inch appeared in Qin Yu’s mind!

The effect of Shrinking Ground Into An Inch was quite similar to the fast speed that Gu Taichu used.

After browsing through it, Qin Yu was even more certain that the technique that Gu Taichu used was Shrinking Ground Into An Inch!

Qin Yu stood up and quickly walked out of the valley.

“Master Gu, did you use Shrinking Ground Into An Inch?” Qin Yu asked.

Gu Taichu nodded and said, “That’s right. This was also taught to me by your father.”

Qin Yu hurriedly asked, “Then did you teach this technique to Chi Feng?”
