Chapter 1527: Chapter 1,527, the furious Sima Bei 1

The iron rod flickered with a boundless radiance and actually met the heavenly tribulation on its own!

The heavenly tribulation that was about to descend actually started to shrink under this radiance!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes! He stared fixedly at the iron rod and couldn’t understand the situation at all!

“Could it be that... The Iron Rod has resurrected on its own?”Qin Yu gulped, feeling extremely shocked!

Not far away, Sima Bei and the others were also shocked by the scene in front of them!

This seemingly ordinary iron rod had actually erupted with such a mysterious power at this moment!

“I didn’t expect there to be unexpected gains.”Sima bei couldn’t help but sneer.

Qin Yu had such a precious treasure in his hands, so Sima bei naturally wouldn’t miss it.

As long as he killed Qin Yu, this iron rod would definitely fall into his hands!

“Weng!”

Under the powerful might of the iron rod, the heavenly tribulation started to dissipate until it was completely shattered.

The surroundings returned to silence, and the iron rod fell to the ground. Everything returned to normal.

Qin Yu grabbed the iron rod. He tried to revive the item, but discovered that the iron rod was the same as before, without any reaction.

......

“What... What’s going on...”Qin Yu was even more confused.

However, he couldn’t care less now. No matter what, he had endured the heavenly tribulation.

“There are still five heavenly tribulation left...”Qin Yu thought in a low voice.

He subconsciously looked in Zhuo Jing’s direction and couldn’t help but feel worried.

If he was disturbed by Sima Bei, the Heavenly Tribulation this time would definitely fail.

“Zhuo Jing, I can only rely on you...”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He had never thought that the people of the northern lands would suddenly descend. Otherwise, he would have called Qu Zhu over no matter what!

“Rumble...”

The fifth heavenly tribulation was brewing, and Sima bei already had the intention to kill Zhuo Jing. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He looked coldly at Zhuo Jing and said, “Kid, I’m almost done playing. Everything should be over.”

Zhuo Jing naturally didn’t dare to be negligent. He held the silver spring horizontally in his hand and was ready to attack.

On the other hand, Sima bei used the same trick again. His body once again burst out with a powerful radiance.

This was the power of the DAO technique and the power of the domain. Zhuo Jing had no way to resist it.

“Every time he uses a spell, his body will burst out with this mysterious radiance,”Zhuo Jing analyzed in his heart.

“I must think of a way to kill him before he uses a spell.”

Zhuo Jing’s father was at the reversion void stage, so he naturally left behind countless spells.

He held the Silver Spring in his hand, and countless thoughts flashed through his mind.

“Father once left behind a trump card spell. Rumor has it that he once used this spell to kill eight people at the reversion void stage,”Zhuo Jing thought in a low voice.

Zhuo Jing had not fully comprehended this spell.

However, under such circumstances, he could only give it a try.

Thus, Zhuo Jing grabbed onto the silver spring, and the internal Qi all over his body faintly erupted.

The Silver Spring hummed in his hand, like a long stream falling from the sky, extremely pleasing to the ear.

At this moment, the Silver Spring seemed to have come back to life on its own, emitting an extremely powerful internal Qi.

The entire body of the sword trembled slightly, emitting an even more powerful internal Qi!

At this moment, the Silver Spring seemed to have found its former owner, and he wanted to use the last of his remaining heat!

“It’s useless, your strength is too weak after all.”Sima bei said coldly.

“Whether it’s useful or not... Let’s try it first!”Zhuo Jing shouted. Then, the Silver Spring in his hand suddenly left his hand, and in an instant, it flew up to a height of 10,000 meters!

However, from such a far distance, one could still see the mysterious radiance emitted by the Silver Spring!

It was like a star hanging in the sky, incomparably resplendent!

Sima bei couldn’t help but laugh coldly. He didn’t put Zhuo Jing’s spell in his eyes at all.

“In front of absolute strength, all spells are useless,”Sima bei said coldly.

Before he finished speaking, a black ball of light appeared on his body.

This ball of light enveloped him and formed the power of the domain.

He held up the domain and slowly raised his palm.

In an instant, tens of thousands of black pillars of light burst out from the domain!

The pillars of light filled the air and contained a strange power!

In the next second, the pillar of light headed straight for Zhuo Jing!

Zhuo Jing, who had lost his Silver Spring, was no match for Sima Bei.

Even though he had used all his spells, he still looked extremely weak in front of Sima bei.

“Shua Shua Shua!”

The black pillar of light directly pierced through Zhuo Jing’s body.

All of his defenses could not withstand a single blow at this moment.

“Pu Pu Pu!”

In the blink of an eye, dozens of bloody holes appeared on his body, and each bloody hole was bleeding profusely!

Zhuo Jing’s internal Qi instantly became a bit weak.

He fell to the ground in extreme pain!

Seeing this, Sima bei couldn’t help but sneer.

“You threw the silver spring out of your own accord. How are you going to fight with me?”Sima bei said with a playful tone.

As he spoke, the Silver Spring in the sky approached Sima bei as if it came from outer space!

Sima bei narrowed his eyes and sneered, “In my domain, all your spells are useless.”

After saying that, he raised his head and looked at the Silver Spring that was descending!

The Silver Spring brought with it a rolling might as it sliced through an unknown amount of space along the way!

At a glance, it seemed as if the world had been directly split into two halves. The scene was extremely grand!

“It’s useless!”Sima bei shouted loudly. He raised both his hands and the power of that domain seemed to have become even stronger!

“Swoosh!”

Finally, the Silver Spring fell down and headed towards Sima Bei’s domain!

The black light started to tremble and in the next second, it was actually sliced open!

Sima bei’s expression immediately changed! He cursed in his heart that things were not good and turned around to run.

However, it was already too late. The Silver Spring was too fast and there was no way to dodge!

“Boom!”

After a loud sound, the entire area turned into nothingness!

The wind and sand blocked one’s vision. No one could see what was going on inside.

Zhuo Jing struggled to get up from the ground. He extended his palm and the Silver Spring returned to his hand.

At this moment, the Silver Spring had already been dyed red. Fresh blood dripped down the blade of the sword like drops of water.

“Heh... heh heh...”

Looking at the Silver Spring in his hand, Zhuo Jing understood everything.

This fresh blood naturally came from Sima bei. It was very obvious that this technique had worked!

“As expected of father’s trump card technique. It really isn’t simple...”Zhuo Jing wiped the fresh blood from the corner of his mouth, and a smile appeared on his face.

“Ah! ! !”

Right at this moment, Sima Bei’s furious Roar came from the center of the storm!

A powerful internal Qi instantly blew away all the wind and sand! Even Zhuo Jing was forced to take a few steps back!

At this moment, Sima Bei’s body was covered in blood, and he was in a sorry state. Even his black robe was covered in wounds!

Half of his body seemed to have been shattered, and it was a horrible sight. The Madness on his face made people feel even more afraid!

“Kid, I’m going to cut you into pieces!”Sima Bei’s furious roar came straight for Zhuo Jing!
