Qin Yu grabbed the ball of energy and squeezed it lightly. The ball of energy immediately exploded!

“Qin Yu?” He Teng narrowed his eyes and sneered. “You finally dared to come back?”

Qin Yu helped Jiang Gu up and then looked at He Teng coldly while saying, “Even if you didn’t come looking for me, I would have come looking for you.”

He Teng couldn’t help but laugh out loud and say, “Come looking for me? Do you know... that I am now at the half-step Martial Marquis Realm?!”

“It’s not like I haven’t killed a half-step Martial Marquis before,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

He Teng couldn’t help but sneer and say, “You mean Meng Wuxiong? Although he has entered the half-step Martial Marquis realm with the help of a magic artifact, he is still far inferior to me!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu’s energy surged all over his body. He pushed Jiang Gu to the side and then said coldly, “Then let’s try it.”

Seeing that Qin Yu was about to make a move, He Teng suddenly waved his hand and said, “No rush. We are both famous people of the younger generation. How can we fight in such a place?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, as if he had guessed He Teng’s intention.

He withdrew his internal qi and said indifferently, “You want to defeat me to achieve fame? Fine, I have the same intention.”

He Teng sneered and said, “Okay! Then tomorrow evening, I’ll see you by the lake!”

“I won’t leave until I see you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He Teng didn’t say anything more and turned around to leave.

At this time, the people who were watching the battle in the dark couldn’t help but feel shocked!

“Qin Yu actually came back!”

“This is really shocking. I thought he was going to hide for the rest of his life.”

“Did you hear what Qin Yu said just now? He said that it’s not like he hasn’t killed a half-step Martial Marquis before!”

“Isn’t he just bragging? He’s just an Inner Strength Grandmaster. How could he kill a half-step Martial Marquis...”

“Whether it’s true or not, we’ll naturally know tomorrow. This trip wasn’t in vain.”

...

Qin Yu looked at Jiang Gu and asked, “How are you? Are you okay?”

Jiang Gu shook his head as a trace of anguish flashed across his face. Then, he looked at Uncle Zhong, who was lying on the ground.

“Mr. Zhong...” Jiang Gu’s face was full of sorrow and pity.

“Uncle Zhong?” Looking at the person lying on the ground, Qin Yu remembered this person.

He was Jiang Gu’s butler and was extremely loyal.

Back then, he tried to get rid of Qin Yu, but his dantian was crippled by Qin Yu.

“Mr. Zhong has been my butler and my best friend for many years. I...” Jiang Gu, not knowing how to express his pain, opened his mouth.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He walked to Uncle Zhong and raised his hand before injecting a trace of spiritual energy into his body to temporarily protect his vital meridian.

“Don’t worry. He will be fine.” Qin Yu patted Jiang Gu’s shoulder.

Jiang Gu hurriedly raised his head and said anxiously, “Really?”

“When have I ever lied to you? You should rest well.” Qin Yu smiled.

After saying that, Qin Yu was ready to leave.

“Mr. Qin!” At this time, Jiang Gu called out to Qin Yu.

“You must be careful.” Jiang Gu took a deep breath and said.

Qin Yu nodded to Jiang Gu and said, “Don’t worry, I will definitely kill He Teng.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

After he returned, Yao Qing and Taozi hurriedly ran out.

“I knew you wouldn’t run away at the last minute!” Yao Qing said excitedly.

Taozi nodded hard and said, “By the way, Elder Qin, didn’t your dantian get crippled? Why are you still...”

Qin Yu smiled aloofly and said, “It’s a lie. I’m doing very well, better than ever.”

“It’s actually a lie?” Taozi was stunned.

At this moment, she seemed to have suddenly thought of something and said anxiously, “Then when the Divine Alchemist Pavilion chased you out...”

“It’s a lie.” Qin Yu nodded his head and said.

Taozi immediately felt waves of regret. If she had known this would happen, she wouldn’t have thrown the token away!

“Don’t worry, I will get someone to repair the token for you,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“It’s getting late. Hurry up and get some rest.”

In the past few days, Qin Yu hadn’t had a good rest. He turned around and went back to his room to sleep.

The next day, the news of Qin Yu’s return quickly spread throughout Chuzhou!

The news that Qin Yu and He Teng were going to fight by Yiyang Lake spread like wildfire.

The Martial Arts Forum was in an uproar.

“Qin Yu really came back.”

“I just got some news that Qin Yu seems to have killed a half-step Martial Marquis before.”

“It seems that the news that his dantian was damaged was fake.”

“Hehe, I guessed it long ago. I said he was faking it, but I was criticized.”

“The Jiang Bei Martial Arts Forum will broadcast it live. Don’t miss this unprecedented battle!”

“The two strongest people on the potential rankings are finally going to fight.”

At two o’clock in the afternoon, the lakeside of Yiyang Lake was already filled with people.

The Jiang Bei Martial Arts Forum had sent reporters early on. They came early and found prime spots. Then, they quietly waited for Qin Yu’s arrival.

“It’s really a magnificent scene. It’s been a long time since Chuzhou was so lively.” Jiang Gu arrived early and couldn’t help but sigh.

“Yes, martial arts has always been Chuzhou’s weak area. Ever since Mr. Qin’s appearance, this stalemate has finally been broken.”

At a glance, there were at least close to a hundred people by the side of Yiyang Lake. Among them, there was no lack of Inner Strength Grandmasters.

Even though they had restrained their internal qi, they could still feel a strong surge of internal qi.

At five o’clock in the afternoon, He Teng finally arrived at the side of Yiyang Lake.

“Mr. He is here!”

“He is number one on the potential rankings and a true half-step Martial Marquis!”

“What a powerful internal qi! This person’s strength is beyond imagination!”

In the dark, an old man was quietly looking at He Teng.

“This person’s strength is probably on par with yours,” the old man said.

The young man beside him immediately said unwillingly, “How is that possible? He has just entered the half-step Martial Marquis realm, so how can he be my opponent?! Master, you underestimate me too much!”

The old man shook his head and didn’t say anything.

Soon, Qin Yu’s figure appeared in everyone’s field of vision!

In contrast to He Teng’s powerful internal qi, Qin Yu looked extremely calm. Almost no fluctuations of his internal qi could be seen.

“Peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmaster?” The old man could see Qin Yu’s strength at a glance.

The young man next to him snorted. “Master, is this Qin Yu, who you’ve always thought highly of? He’s just so-so!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The old man glanced at the young man, stroked his beard, and smiled. “What if he can defeat He Teng, who is half-step Martial Marquis, with the realm of an Inner Strength Grandmaster?”
