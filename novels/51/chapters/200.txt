Chapter 201: Arrested Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As soon as he finished speaking, he saw the big screen on the wall slowly showing the scene from that day.

On the screen, Xiong Yi bowed and even led everyone to defame Lei Hu.

Seeing the content on the screen, Lei Hu got up excitedly and said, “Xiong Yi, what else do you have to say now!”

Xiong Yi’s expression was a little ugly. He never thought that Qin Yu would leave a surveillance camera in the living room!

“Mr. Qin, what happened that day was indeed my fault.” Xiong Yi hurriedly admitted defeat.

He smiled embarrassedly and said, “Mr. Qin, I also had no choice that day. Jiang Gu was too terrifying. I also had to protect my life.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I can understand if you wanted to protect your own life, but you wanted to use Jiang Gu to get rid of Lei Hu. I’m sorry, but I can’t tolerate it.”

Xiong Yi wasn’t flustered, because in his impression, Qin Yu was especially forgiving.

Therefore, Xiong Yi said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, please forgive me. I know I’m wrong, and I’m willing to compensate Lei Hu! What do you think?”

“Compensate?” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. “Xiong Yi, you betrayed your own people and caused Lance to lose both his legs. Can compensation solve it?”

“Then what else do you want?” Xiong Yi mumbled.

“The matter has already happened. It’s already good enough that I am willing to make up for it.”

“Moreover, these people are all listening to me now. Without us working for you, you can’t earn money, right...”

It was very obvious that Xiong Yi didn’t take Qin Yu seriously at all!

Updates by

His attitude towards Jiang Gu was completely different from his attitude towards Qin Yu!

Even if Qin Yu defeated Jiang Gu, in Xiong Yi’s eyes, Qin Yu’s influence was far inferior to Jiang Gu’s!

“Are you challenging me?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

He sneered. “It seems that sometimes, I really shouldn’t treat you guys too well.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu raised his finger, and a violent force directly shattered Xiong Yi’s knees!

Xiong Yi instantly fell to his knees with a plop!

“I now understand a principle. To you people, I have to make you afraid of me.” Qin Yu slowly stood up and walked towards Xiong Yi step by step.

Xiong Yi’s expression was somewhat unsightly, and he said in terror, “You... what do you want to do?!”

“If I don’t kill you, who will submit to me in the future?” Qin Yu’s voice carried a surging killing intent!

For a moment, Xiong Yi’s expression turned pale from fright!

He hurriedly looked at the others and anxiously shouted, “You... you guys, plead on my behalf...”

But these people were fence-sitters in the first place, so how could they plead on Xiong Yi’s behalf?

“Mr. Qin, I know I’m wrong. I. . . I won’t dare to do it again in the future. I beg you to spare my life...” Xiong Yi’s body trembled as he said in terror.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu raised his hand towards Xiong Yi’s head!

At this critical moment, the door outside was suddenly pushed open!

Then, they saw a few police officers walk in!

The leader was a man with a square face. He shouted coldly, “Qin Yu, you’re arrested!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Arrested?

“Who are you?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

The other party sneered. “I’m from the Police Department of Chuzhou. My name Is Feng Xiang.”

“Feng Xiang?” Lei Hu’s expression changed.

He hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, Feng Xiang is Jiang Gu’s man!”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly darkened.

He never expected Jiang Gu would use such a dirty trick after losing to him!

“Take him away!” Feng Xiang waved his hand, and a few people rushed towards Qin Yu.

“What do you want to do?!” Lei Hu hurriedly shouted.

Feng Xiang questioned coldly, “Qin Yu, you want to go against the authorities?!”

Qin Yu frowned.

Going against the authorities absolutely wasn’t allowed.

In this era, no matter who it was, they couldn’t go against the authorities.

“Lei Hu, back off.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Mr. Qin...” Lei Hu seemed a little anxious, but there was nothing he could do.

Qin Yu looked at Feng Xiang and said in a sullen voice, “I’ll go with you.”

Feng Xiang sneered. “That’s more like it!”

Then, a few people walked to Qin Yu’s side.

They seemed to be a little nervous. The man in front of them was, after all, someone who had won against Jiang Gu, so it was impossible not to be nervous.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Qin Yu was brought into the car.

“D*mn it, he scared me to death.” Xiong Yi panted heavily and felt a chill on his back.

“I knew Jiang Gu wouldn’t let Qin Yu off. He actually wanted to kill me? Dream On!” Xiong Yi snorted coldly.

Lei Hu glared at Xiong Yi and berated loudly, “Xiong Yi, haven’t you been taught a lesson from the last time?!”

“Lesson?” Xiong Yi snickered.

“Don’t tell me you think Qin Yu will still be able to come out this time? Let me tell you, the Jiang family has dominated Chuzhou for many years. Their connections are beyond your imagination!”

“This time, Qin Yu will definitely die in there!”

Xiong Yi’s words made Lei Hu’s expression turn a little ugly.

That’s right, the Jiang family had been in Chuzhou for so many years. Their connections had long been deeply established. It was too difficult to do anything to them.

“But without Qin Yu’s protection, who are you? Go back to being a gangster!” Xiong Yi sneered.

Then, he looked at the driver and shouted, “Take me to the hospital!”

...

After Qin Yu got in the car, it sped to the provincial capital.

“Mr. Feng, I want to know, what law I have broken?” Qin Yu asked.

Feng Xiang glanced at Qin Yu and sneered. “Don’t you know what law you’ve broken? You fought and even killed people, right? This is enough to get you a death sentence!”

Qin Yu frowned tightly.

Feng Xiang wasn’t wrong.

Qin Yu had indeed killed people, such as that overseas Inner Strength Past Master.

He had also fought and injured Liu Shihui, Jiang Haoran, and so on.

But... they usually turned a blind eye to competitions between martial artists.

As for that overseas Inner Strength Past Master, the media had praised Qin Yu!

Most importantly, they had no evidence of this!

“Do you think we have no evidence?” Feng Xiang seemed to have guessed Qin Yu’s thoughts.

He took out a stack of documents and sneered. “These are all evidence of you breaking the law. See for yourself!”

Qin Yu took the documents and glanced at them. They were full of murder cases.

But these weren’t done by Qin Yu at all! He had never even heard of them!

“Are you deliberately messing with me?” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

Feng Xiang sneered. “So what if I am? So what if I’m not? Qin Yu, do you think that you can rise to the top by defeating Jiang Gu? Let me tell you, it’s impossible!”

A flash of anger flashed across Qin Yu’s expression.

He glared at Feng Xiang and said, “You’re slandering me. You’re the one who broke the law!”
