Chapter 547: Impostor? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“There’s definitely a secret here,” Qin Yu said with some surprise.

After walking for several days, Qin Yu finally found a place with spiritual energy!

Therefore, he hurriedly walked toward the gap.

“Who are you? Who told you to be here?”

At this moment, a stern shout came from behind Qin Yu.

He turned around and saw two men looking at him vigilantly.

Qin Yu released his internal qi and realized that these two people were actually two Inner Strength Grandmasters.

“Huh? There are actually Inner Strength Grandmasters here.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

“Tell me, who are you? Who let you in?!” The two men shouted again.

The internal qi on their bodies exploded, and their faces were filled with coldness. They had the intention to attack!

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said politely, “My name is Qin Yu. I’m sorry for barging in. I was attracted by this lake.”

“Qin Yu?”

Hearing this name, the two of them were instantly stunned.

They looked at each other, and then hurriedly asked, “Are you the Qin Yu who injured Han Wei?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

It had only been a few days, but news of it had already reached this place?

“That’s right, it’s me.” Qin Yu nodded and said.

The two of them immediately changed their attitudes and said respectfully, “We’ve heard so much about you. We didn’t expect to see you in person today!”

“Mr. Qin, you’re our idol! You aren’t afraid of powerful people and you’re very brave. We have always wanted to follow you!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed. He said politely, “You two are flattering me.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu pointed at the lake and said, “Oh right, where does the spiritual energy in this lake come from? Why is it strong and weak at times?”

A hint of awkwardness flashed across their faces.

They smiled embarrassedly and said, “Mr. Qin, it’s not that we don’t want to tell you, but... This is our secret. We aren’t allowed to tell outsiders.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“How about... I bring you to see our Sect Master?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Alright, then I’ll have to trouble the two of you.”

Thus, Qin Yu followed behind the two of them and walked forward.

In front of them, there was a building. The two of them brought Qin Yu straight up to the twenty-seventh floor and then came to an office.

“Mr. Qin, this is our Sect Master’s office.” The two of them said politely.

Qin Yu bowed slightly to express his gratitude.

Then, Qin Yu knocked on the door.

Not long after, a woman’s cold voice came from inside, “Who is it?”

“Sect Master, someone wants to see you,” the two Inner Strength Grandmasters said quickly.

“Wait, I’m in a meeting. Don’t you guys know?” The woman said coldly.

The two Inner Strength Grandmasters were a bit embarrassed. One of them said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, please don’t mind. Our Sect Master just encountered a difficult problem recently, so she’s quite upset.”

“It’s alright.” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t be angry since he was disturbing others.

After he waited at the door for about half an hour, they finally opened the door.

Then, they saw four or five people walking out from inside.

What surprised Qin Yu was that these people were all peak Inner Strength Grandmasters!

With such strength, they were definitely top-notch existences in this small city!

“Come in.”

Then, he heard that woman’s voice.

Qin Yu immediately walked into the office.

With a glance, he saw a woman with an ice-cold expression sitting in front of the office desk.

Her skin was fair and she looked sharp, but there was a trace of worry on her face.

“Who are you?” After seeing Qin Yu, this woman couldn’t help but frown.

Before Qin Yu could speak, the two people beside him hurriedly said, “Sect Master, he is that famous Qin Yu!”

“Hello,” Qin Yu said politely.

However, this woman sneered and said, “These few days, there has been at least eight people who claimed to be Qin Yu. In the end, they were all liars!”

Although there were many videos of Qin Yu, they were all taken during battle. The extremely strong internal qi made the cameraman dare not to go forward.

Qin Yu’s face was unable to be seen clearly in the videos. Only a blurry figure could be seen.

When Qin Yu heard these words, he was stunned.

He said somewhat awkwardly, “Someone is pretending to be me? For what purpose?”

“You really think you’re Qin Yu?” The woman said coldly.

“Who doesn’t know that Qin Yu is currently in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? Even if he isn’t in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, he would appear in Jingdu! Why would he come to the tiny Jade City?!” The woman said coldly.

Qin Yu explained helplessly, “I’m really Qin Yu. I just left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. The reason why I’m here is because of the lake at the entrance.”

Just as the woman was about to speak, a man suddenly walked in from outside.

“Zhen Yue, Qin Yu is here,” the man said.

Zhen Yue immediately sneered. “Did you hear that? Another Qin Yu is here. Let him in.”

A hint of amusement appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

He found a place to sit down and quietly waited for “Qin Yu” to arrive.

Not long after, a handsome man walked in.

The man said indifferently, “Sect Master Zhen, right? I heard that you encountered some difficulties recently?”

Zhen Yue said expressionlessly, “You’re Qin Yu?”

“That’s right. I’m Qin Yu!” The man said indifferently.

Zhen Yue sneered. “Then why aren’t you at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? What are you doing in Jade City?”

The imposter laughed and said, “I heard that Sect Master Zhen has encountered some difficulties. Whoever can help you solve them will be able to get 100 million and have a good night with you...”

The impostor paused and continued, “Of course, I just happened to pass by here. I didn’t come here just for this.”

Zhen Yue didn’t have any expression on her face. She only said coldly, “How can you prove that you’re Qin Yu?”

The impostor didn’t say anything else. His body shook, and beams of golden light instantly burst out from his body!

Seeing the golden light, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

It was a d*mn good imitation!

“Golden internal qi!” Seeing this, everyone couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

“Qin Yu releases golden light when he fights! It seems that he really is Qin Yu!”

Even Zhen Yue showed a hint of surprise on her face.

“Are you really Qin Yu?” Zhen Yue stood up immediately and asked in surprise.

The imposter pretended to be displeased and said, “I came here to help you out of kindness, but you actually doubted me. In that case, I’ll leave.”

After saying that, the imposter turned around and was about to leave.

Zhen Yue’s expression changed. She hurriedly stopped the imposter and said politely, “I didn’t mean that. It’s just that there have been too many imposters these days. Please don’t mind, Mr. Qin...”

The impostor nodded with satisfaction.

Then, Zhen Yue looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “You can leave now.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but say helplessly, “This person is obviously a person who swindles money and women. How can you believe him?”

“What did you say?!” The impostor was instantly enraged, and the golden light on his body also rose.
