Chapter 1204: Chapter 1204, the person inside he Teng’s body 

It was as if everyone could sense the extraordinary aspect of this magic artifact, and their eyes were filled with fear.

He teng coldly berated, “Why didn’t you take out this thing earlier! Why did you have to wait until so many people died! ?”

That mighty figure coldly looked at he teng and said, “It’s easy for you to say that. This thing is a life-saving item for me. Not only will I not take it out at a critical moment!”

After saying that, he held the magic tool in his hand and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Qin Yu, if you are willing to let us go now, we can stop the war,”the Almighty said coldly.

It was obvious that he did not want to use this magic tool, especially at this time.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “Of course I can let you go, but he can’t go.”

Qin Yu’s finger pointed in the direction of He Teng.

He Teng’s expression changed! He immediately felt that something was wrong.

“All of you are at the Almighty Realm. If you want to block he Teng’s path, there shouldn’t be too much of a problem, right?”Qin Yu said indifferently.

He teng shouted, “Don’t listen to his nonsense! The second son is sinister and cunning. He’s clearly trying to drive a wedge between us!”

However, everyone was faintly moved.

This Qin Yu was like an insurmountable mountain filled with danger.

Most importantly, his future path was probably limitless.

Now, with his physical body of a martial saint, he was able to kill a mighty figure. Only the heavens knew how terrifying his future would be.

“Is what you said true?”A mighty figure asked coldly.

“Absolutely true.”Qin Yu said lightly.

“I don’t have too much enmity with you guys, but this he teng is different. He has committed many evil deeds and must die!”

Qin Yu had already begun to become impatient after escaping time and time again.

“Alright, we can agree to it, but we still have one condition.”The mighty figure holding the magic weapon said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly, indicating for him to continue.

“We must have a share of the quota to go to the saint-level,”the almighty expert said coldly.

“No problem.”Qin Yu agreed once more, making a concession.

This caused he teng’s face to turn extremely ugly.

He stared angrily at everyone, then shouted, “Are you all crazy? Do you really believe this kid’s Words? !”

“Why not? We’ve only met you for the first time.”A mighty figure sneered.

“That’s right. In our eyes, you’re no different from Qin Yu.”

As he spoke, these twenty plus people had already turned around and surrounded he teng.

He Teng gritted his teeth. He had never expected such an outcome. He immediately wanted to turn into a black fog and escape this place.

Unfortunately, it was already too late. Many mighty figures had taken action at the same time and sealed off this space.

He Teng did not have the Divine Power Qin Yu had to shatter this space. Even if he used all of his arts, he would still be unable to break through this space.

“Alright, we have already done what we should do,”said a mighty figure.

“Can we leave now?”

Qin Yu smiled. “Don’t be anxious. Everyone, why don’t you stay for a while?”

“Did you hear that? ! This Qin Yu is playing you!”He Teng roared crazily.

Many mighty figures also seemed to have some doubts.

“Qin Yu, one must keep one’s word.”A mighty figure said coldly.

Qin Yu smiled faintly and said, “Everyone, there’s no need to worry. Since I’ve Promised You, I will definitely do it. The reason why I’m keeping you here is because I want to discuss the ancient array platform with everyone.”

“Don’t listen to his nonsense! He’s lying to you!”He Teng was still unwilling to accept it.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “He Teng, you’re about to die. Stop talking nonsense. Everyone in the world knows that you’re a treacherous scoundrel. Who would have a good ending if they cooperated with you!”

“Qin Yu, don’t go too far!”He Teng roared crazily.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He took a step and arrived in front of He Teng. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He coldly looked at he teng and said, “This time, I want to see how you will escape!”

With that said, Qin Yu looked at the few mighty figures and said, “Please Lock Me in the same space as him.”

“Okay.”The many mighty figures nodded slightly. They immediately used spatial secret techniques to lock the two of them in an extremely narrow space.

He Teng immediately panicked. He was like a frightened bird, shivering.

The fear that spread from the bottom of his heart almost swallowed him up.

“You... Don’t come over!”He Teng said in fear.

Qin Yu sneered, “Such a small space, even if you have great ability, you can’t escape.”

He Teng gritted his teeth and roared, “F * ck you!”

He used the same trick again, and his hand squeezed the black fog toward Qin Yu.

However, even Gu Xinghe lost to Qin Yu, let alone he teng?

Qin Yu waved his hand and easily slapped his palm.

Then, he threw another punch at He Teng’s chest.

The Fist went through his chest and came out from his back. A huge bloody hole appeared in front of everyone.

“You... Wah!”

He Teng opened his mouth and was about to speak when he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

Qin Yu knew that he teng had many tricks up his sleeve, so this time, Qin Yu did not plan to give him any chance.

He clenched his fist, and divine power erupted. He immediately threw a punch at He Teng’s Head!

He Teng’s eyes widened, and his pupils constricted, filled with terror.

Just as Qin Yu’s fist was about to hit his head, he Teng’s pupils suddenly changed color.

His pupils, which were originally extremely ordinary, suddenly became two pupils.

Not only that, his pupils also turned blood-red, looking extremely terrifying.

He Teng raised his hand and grabbed Qin Yu’s fist.

But even so, he Teng’s hand bones were still shattered!

“Eh?”Qin Yu frowned, and then sneered, “The guy in your body has finally come out.”

He Teng looked at Qin Yu in front of him and grinned, “Thank you... if not for your help, this kid would never give me the initiative of his body...”

“Cut the crap, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time. Let’s Fight!”Qin Yu took a step forward and burst out with a monstrous fighting spirit.
