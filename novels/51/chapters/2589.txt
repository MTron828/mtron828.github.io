Chapter 2590: The Elf’s Promise

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Killing intent flashed across Qin Yu’s eyes. When the alien race joined forces to destroy those divine flame runes, Revered Qi and Lin Nantian did not do anything about it. They even fought with Loli for the divine flame runes.

At that time, Qin Yu’s soul’s consciousness had already awakened and he could see everything clearly.

“Brother Qin Yu, don’t be agitated. These are the will of the Saint. We’re just the pawns chosen by them. There’s nothing we can do.”

When the man saw Qin Yu’s cold gaze, his heart skipped a beat.

“However, before I came to Saint Kingdom, Lord Jue Chen had given me some information. I’m telling you this information in the hope that you can spare my life.”

He quickly continued. To save his life, he did not wait for Qin Yu’s response and continued to speak.

“The living beings derived here have five kinds. They are Confused

Consciousness, Human Consciousness for those who have just awakened, True

Consciousness for those above this, followed by Dao Consciousness, and then

Holy Consciousness. When one has a clear consciousness, one can become

Human Consciousness. These people will be restricted by the rules of this world’s order, but we can get enough help through them. This is a rapid way to increase one’s strength.”

“How did Jue Chen get this information?”

Qin Yu believed him. He had indeed obtained two benefits from the village chief.

One was the dao lecture, and the other was about the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

“The Saints also scheme against each other, especially the divine kingdom with the weakest strength of the Dao Mystical Saint. Countless pairs of eyes are eying on it. Once, Lord Jue Chen entered this place with a clone and peeped into the power formed here. These are some of the secrets he peeked out.”

The man said with a bitter smile.

“Ask him if all living beings can do this?”

A familiar voice sounded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

It was Immortal Emperor Yao.

Qin Yu frowned. He had always thought that Immortal Emperor Yao had been wiped out during the great war of catastrophe.

He did not expect him to hide in the depths of his soul and enter this world with him.

He asked the man what Immortal Emperor Yao had said.

“That’s right. Lord Jue Chen said this is the shortcut to increasing one’s strength. It’s also the weakness of this Saint Kingdom.”

The man nodded.

“You can kill him now. He’s lying.”

Immortal Emperor Yao sneered.

“Hahaha, do you think I’m an idiot? The other seed on Ni Fei’s body is the True Word, and it can judge if you’re telling the truth.”

With a sudden change in Qin Yu’s thought process, he said with a sinister smile.

At this moment, Hua Qianjie had returned after killing five or six demon beasts.

With a thought from Qin Yu, Hua Qianjie came to him expressionlessly and reached out to break his legs directly.

“Don’t kill me! I’ll tell you the truth!”

Fear appeared on the man’s face, and he was about to speak.

But Qin Yu did not give him any chance. Hua Qianjie smashed his internal organs and threw him in front of Shen Qian.

“Kill him and heal your injuries.” Qin Yu said softly. “Thank you, Brother Qin Yu!”

Shen Qian nodded.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, how did you know he was lying?”

“How can the order of Saint Kingdom be so easily raised? These derived living beings exist ultimately to balance the power in this Saint Kingdom, even to enhance the comprehension of the Dao Mystical Saint himself, not to serve as experience for you guys.” Immortal Emperor Yao sneered.

“Have you regained consciousness?”

This was the first time Qin Yu saw Immortal Emperor Yao take the initiative to talk so much, and he was curious.

“I absorbed some Saint power and recalled more things.

“Regardless of the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes or the supreme treasure that nurtured the soul, they only extend the time I can exist in this universe.

“However, it’s quite interesting to be able to enter this kingdom before leaving.”

“Can you be more specific?”

Qin Yu still did not quite understand.

“You will understand very soon.”

Seeing that he could no longer probe further, Qin Yu turned his gaze to the last outsider.

It was a living being of the monster race, and his skin was pale and emitted a faint light.

A thick mane of black hair, disheveled and cascading over his shoulders, accompanied by a faint blue glow.

“I am Aiden, chosen by Galadriel, the Saint of the demon race. In the depths of our elven race’s souls flows the blood of precise marksmanship, and the secret that the queen gave me comes from my bloodline. There is the strongest bowstring here, the Sun Chasing Bow, collected by Dao Mystical. I have the coordinates of this divine artifact. If I can obtain it and you are in danger, I will definitely assist you with all my might.”

Aiden walked up and said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was a little hesitant. In terms of race, both sides were now mortal enemies.

He did not want to let Aiden go just like that. This elf gave Qin Yu a sense of

oppression. He would definitely become a great enemy moving forward if he were allowed to grow.

“Agree with him.”

Immortal Emperor Yao spoke again, interrupting Qin Yu’s thoughts.

“You may go. I hope you remember your promise today.”

Qin Yu waved his hand.

Aiden could not believe his ears. He did not expect Qin Yu to agree to his request so readily. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He performed an elven gesture of courtesy toward Qin Yu and then quickly left.

“The elven race places the utmost importance on promises, and there are only a few, if any, among the entire history of the human race who can compare in this regard. This is also the reason the elven race was extremely rare. It will be of great help to you here if he can obtain the Sun Chasing Bow. Perhaps he can let you live a little longer.”

Immortal Emperor chuckled and said, but his words made people’s hair stand on end.

During this short conversation, Hua Qianjie had already hunted and severely injured five more Lightning Leopards.

She grabbed the enormous prey with one hand and threw them on the ground.

“Kill them all and recover from your injuries.”

Qin Yu said to the four people.

These four people were all from the three Daoist sects, especially Shen Qian who had gone through life and death with him. He could not have any other thoughts about these people.

“Thank you, Brother Qin Yu.”

The few of them said respectfully.

He could kill Ni Fei and control the humanoid monster Hua Qianjie. Qin Yu’s air of mystery has risen to an enormous level in the minds of those few.

After killing these demon beasts, their physical bodies and vitality were much better than before.

Previously, under Hua Qianjie’s control, they were more or less suppressed by Hua Qianjie. Their blood essence was less than half of their original state, and they even had to face these powerful demon beasts.

Qin Yu hesitated for a while, wondering if he should continue to let them increase their Saint power of the soul.

Now that Hua Qianjie was here, no living beings in the vicinity could threaten them. They could do whatever they wanted.

“Kid, there’s a difference between a seed and the Heart of Saint Kingdom. Once you use it, its power will disappear. Don’t let Hua Qianjie get too far away from you, or you might not be able to control her..”
