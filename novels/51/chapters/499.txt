Chapter 500: Miscalculation! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Replace the Saint Confucian Sect within a month?

This wasn’t an easy thing to do. One had to know that the Saint Confucian Sect was not only extremely well-connected, but they also had a Martial Marquis.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then stood up and said, “Okay, I agree.”

This shocked Teng Gong. He was stunned for a moment, then he laughed out loud, “Okay! Then it’s a deal!”

“It’s a deal.” Qin Yu shook hands with Teng Gong.

For Qin Yu, it was only a matter of time before he launched a crusade against the Saint Confucian Sect.

As for their backers, they had already become enemies with Qin Yu.

So he had nothing to worry about.

Under Teng Gong’s arrangements, Qin Yu contacted the reporters of Sea City. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After arranging everything, Qin Yu and the Saint Confucian Sect agreed on a time and place, and prepared to meet and negotiate for the first time.

At noon the next day, Elder Qu and Gu Canghai had been waiting for Qin Yu in a clubhouse in Hong Province’s Cang City.

“I didn’t expect that Qin Yu would actually dare to agree,” Gu Canghai said coldly.

Elder Qu smiled and said, “Sect master, Qin Yu is still young after all. He is still too naive.”

“If I’m not mistaken, he will definitely make some excessive demands.”

Gu Canghai sneered. “No matter what demands he makes, I won’t agree. As long as he dares to come, I will make sure he never leaves!”

He knew that Qin Yu had the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch ability , so Gu Canghai had already set up a formation!

In this formation, no one could escape from this room!

Time passed minute by minute. After more than ten minutes, movement finally came from outside the door.

“He’s here!” Elder Qu hurriedly stood up with a hint of excitement.

A hint of anger flashed across Gu Canghai’s face.

He suppressed the anger in his heart and waved his hand. “Open the door.”

Elder Qu ran to the door eagerly. When he opened the door, Qin Yu was indeed standing at the door.

“Qin Yu! You really dared to come!” The moment he saw Qin Yu, Elder Qu couldn’t help but clench his teeth!

Qin Yu sneered. “Why wouldn’t I dare to?”

Just as Elder Qu was about to say something, a group of reporters suddenly ran over from behind Qin Yu.

This group of reporters held cameras and approached Elder Qu.

Elder Qu’s expression changed and he said coldly, “What do you mean by this?”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “I was afraid that you guys would play tricks, so I contacted reporters in advance.”

“Oh right, let me remind you that they are reporters under the Teng family.”

Elder Qu’s expression became even more unsightly. He didn’t expect that Qin Yu would actually contact the reporters in advance!

“Qin Yu, you’re quite ruthless!” Elder Qu said coldly.

After saying this, Elder Qu moved aside.

Qin Yu strode into the room. The moment he entered, he saw a tall man with a white beard.

This man was none other than Gu Canghai!

The moment the two of them met, Gu Canghai’s expression darkened.

A strong murderous internal qi burst out from his body! The cold internal qi instantly caused the temperature in the room to drop by several degrees!

“Qin Yu... !” Gu Canghai suddenly stood up, as if he couldn’t hold back.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, appeared rather calm. He walked to the opposite side of Gu Canghai and sat down.

“You’re the sect master of the Saint Confucian Sect, right? Since you intend to negotiate with me, then show your sincerity,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Gu Canghai narrowed his eyes and couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Qin Yu, the Saint Confucian Sect has been established for many years, but we have never suffered such humiliation!”

“Killing my disciples and destroying my sect? Qin Yu, how should you be punished?!”

Qin Yu sneered. “If the Saint Confucian Sect didn’t bully others first, how could I kill innocent people indiscriminately?”

Gu Canghai narrowed his eyes and said, “You’re the first one who dared to challenge the Saint Confucian Sect.”

“That’s true. After all, when one beats a dog, one must answer to its master,” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

Gu Canghai wasn’t stupid. He naturally discerned the hidden meaning in Qin Yu’s words.

He sneered and said, “Qin Yu, you really shocked me by daring to come here today.”

“Negotiate with the Saint Confucian Sect? Are you even worthy?!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Gu Canghai, are you going to break the promise?”

“Hahaha!” Gu Canghai couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

He was about to speak when Elder Qu came up from the side.

He leaned against Gu Canghai’s ear and whispered, “Sect master, those reporters are from the Teng family of Sea City.”

Hearing the name of the Teng family, Gu Canghai narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Qin Yu, tell me. What are your demands?” Gu Canghai asked coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony. He looked at Gu Canghai and said, “First, I want the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to release the Pavilion Master.”

Gu Canghai didn’t say anything. He quietly waited for Qin Yu to continue.

“Second, I want two people,” Qin Yu continued.

Gu Canghai sneered. “Oh really? Which two people?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said coldly, “The first one is He Teng, and the second one...”

At this point, Qin Yu paused. He suddenly raised his finger and pointed at Elder Qu!

“The second one is Elder Qu!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s voice became extremely cold!

All of this was caused by Elder Qu! More importantly, he tried to do something improper to the Pavilion Master!

If Qin Yu didn’t kill him, Qin Yu would never let it go!

Elder Qu, who was standing at the side, suddenly became anxious. He hurriedly looked at the sect master and said, “Sect master, you must not agree to his request!”

Elder Qu naturally knew what the consequences would be if he fell into Qin Yu’s hands. He hurriedly stood behind the sect master with a face full of fear.

Gu Canghai kept silent and only looked at Qin Yu coldly.

After a moment, Gu Canghai said, “You think you can threaten me with a few reporters, don’t you?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said coldly, “What do you mean?”

Gu Canghai shouted angrily, “So what if they are the Teng family’s reporters?! I, Gu Canghai, have nothing to fear!”

Before he finished his words, Gu Canghai suddenly raised his hand and left!

Gu Canghai clenched his large hand, and the several reporters were crushed into meat paste!

Qin Yu’s expression immediately turned ugly!

He didn’t expect Gu Canghai to not care about the Teng family’s identity at all!

As he looked at the reporters lying in a pool of blood, Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly.

Gu Canghai slowly stood up. His hair flapped wildly, and his murderous internal qi surged!

“Qin Yu, even if the king comes, you will die here!” Gu Canghai said coldly.
