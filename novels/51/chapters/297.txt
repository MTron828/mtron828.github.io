Chapter 298: You’d Better Die! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After turning around, he saw Qin Yu standing on Chi Feng’s side!

The internal qi on his body looked extremely calm, but there was an extremely intimidating aura that made people dare not to look at him directly!

“You... you actually successfully passed the Heavenly Tribulation?” Chi Feng’s expression instantly became extremely ugly!

He quickly broke free and hurriedly retreated a few steps away!

“Mr. Qin!” Yao Qing shouted even more excitedly!

Even though his entire body was heavily injured, he still rushed to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression was calm. He nodded and said, “Take good care of Master Gu.”

“Alright! Mr. Qin, you also have to be more careful!” Yao Qing said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His entire disposition seemed to have undergone a huge change in that instant!

Then, Qin Yu looked at Chi Feng with calmness on his face.

There wasn’t even the slightest fluctuation of emotion in his pupils.

It was as if he was looking down on an ant!

“Qin Yu...”

At this moment, Gu Taichu, who was lying on the ground, suddenly spoke with difficulty.

Updates by

“You... can’t die...” Gu Taichu said with difficulty.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Master Gu, don’t worry, I won’t die.”

After saying this, Qin Yu looked at Chi Feng and beckoned at him.

This action undoubtedly infuriated Chi Feng! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He glared at Qin Yu and berated, “So what if you’ve broken through?! You’re just a trash who has just entered the Inner Strength Past Master realm! And I’m an eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster!”

The difference in strength between the two was indeed extremely great.

But for some reason, Qin Yu had a sudden weird feeling inside.

It was as if... Chi Feng wasn’t even worth mentioning and could be easily crushed to death.

“There’s no need to say anything more. Make your move.” Qin Yu placed his hands behind his back and gave off an imposing aura.

Chi Feng gritted his teeth and said angrily, “Alright, since that’s the case, then I’ll kill you!”

After saying that, Chi Feng clenched his fist again and came over!

A terrifying aura rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s gaze turned cold as he raised his fist to confront the attack!

“Boom!”

This was an unprecedented collision, and their surroundings shook!

After he felt this enormous force, Chi Feng’s expression suddenly changed!

He felt his fist go numb, and even his arm suffered a huge impact!

“Oh no, I can’t get close to him!” Chi Feng suddenly realized.

He hurriedly used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique to increase the distance between the two of them.

What shocked Chi Feng was that this time, Qin Yu didn’t catch up, but looked at him quietly.

“You dared to look down on me?!” Chi Feng glared at Qin Yu.

“I will make you pay the price!”

Chi Feng raised his head and roared. He raised his hands toward the sky! Streams of energy came from all directions and gathered in his palms!

As he looked at this spell, Qin Yu’s lips curled into a cold smile.

He had seen this spell before. Back then, Gu Jinhong also used this spell and called it his trump card!

Unfortunately, Gu Jinhong’s so-called trump card was shattered by Qin Yu with one punch.

“If I can destroy it once, I can destroy it a second time,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Chi Feng, who was in mid-air, roared crazily. The disk in his hand grew larger and larger, and almost blotted out the sun!

“Qin Yu, go to h*ll!” Chi Feng roared, and the disk in his hand immediately appeared!

“Rumble!”

The disk brought an extremely strong force with it and rapidly crushed toward Qin Yu!

In an instant, the entire world seemed to be buzzing!

Crack!

As the round disc approached, the ground under Qin Yu’s feet could no longer withstand it and actually began to crack!

“What a petty trick. Watch me crush it with one punch!” Qin Yu’s eyes shone with a cold light as he clenched his fist and rose!

The Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist instantly gathered in his hand, and golden light illuminated the area!

Boom!

Finally, Qin Yu’s fist smashed towards Chi Feng’s disk!

The collision between the two instantly caused a huge shock!

Not far away, Yao Qing clenched his fist and stared at this scene!

Even Gu Taichu, who was lying on the ground, turned his head with great difficulty!

“Break!”

Along with Qin Yu’s furious roar, the disk was shattered!

Countless fragments slowly disappeared in the air.

Everything returned to calm!

“How could this be?!” Chi Feng’s expression changed drastically! It was as if he couldn’t believe the outcome in front of him!

“My realm is far above yours. How could you possibly defeat me?!” Chi Feng roared furiously!

Qin Yu sneered. “I’ll tell you the reason. It’s because you’re trash. If it wasn’t for the opportunity given to you by Master Gu, you might have been a trash for the rest of your life.”

“You... You’re spouting nonsense!” Chi Feng seemed to have a mental breakdown as he roared at Qin Yu with all his might!

He formed a seal with both hands to unleash another killing move!

But unfortunately, Qin Yu didn’t give him the chance.

In an instant, Qin Yu arrived in front of Chi Feng!

“Oh no!” Chi Feng was alarmed and turned around to run!

But when he took a step forward, he realized that it was already too late!

The Heavy Falling Space technique restricted Chi Feng’s movements!

His legs seemed to be entangled!

“Chi Feng, you even tried to kill your master. You deserve to die!” Qin Yu’s cold voice rang in Chi Feng’s ears.

Before Chi Feng could react, Qin Yu’s fist had already smashed into his face!

Qin Yu, who had entered the Monastic Stage, had a qualitative change in his strength!

Not only did his spiritual power become as vast as the sea, but even his physical strength had increased by dozens of times!

Under this punch, Chi Feng’s entire face was deformed and his bones shattered!

“Ah!!” The pain caused Chi Feng to scream!

He wanted to escape, but Qin Yu had already grabbed his neck with one hand!

Then, he kept on slapping Chi Feng’s face left and right!

He used pure physical strength to beat Chi Feng until he was in unbearable pain! The sounds of slapping were incessant!

Even Yao Qing, who was on the ground, couldn’t bear to look at it. It was truly too pitiful!

“You ungrateful beast.”

“You actually tried to kill an old man who raised you and taught you cultivation techniques!”

“You stole my Enlightenment Tea and delayed my journey to Jingdu!”

With every sentence, Chi Feng’s face would receive a slap.

After more than ten slaps, Chi Feng no longer looked human in form.

His face bone shattered, and after losing the support of his bones, his entire face collapsed!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu grabbed Chi Feng’s neck and ruthlessly threw him to the ground!

A huge pit appeared on the ground!

Chi Feng fell into the huge pit with blood dripping down.

Just as he was about to climb out, Qin Yu kicked him in the spine!

“Ah!!” The pain was unimaginable! Chi Feng became a cripple!

The sudden change in the situation made Chi Feng feel like he was dreaming.

He had the upper hand just now, but now, he had lost the ability to fight back!

“Spare... spare me...” Chi Feng was scared when he thought about how he was going to die.

He cried, “Qin Yu, please.. spare me. I don’t want to die...”

“Now you feel fear?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Chi Feng said in a trembling voice, “Don’t kill me, I... I’m Gu Taichu’s personal disciple, and I’m like his son...”

Then, he shouted in Gu Taichu’s direction, “Master, save me! Save me! I don’t want to die... I just lost my rationality for a moment...”

Qin Yu grinned and said coldly, “I’m sorry. No one can save you today.”

Just as Qin Yu was about to kill him, Gu Taichu, who wasn’t far away, suddenly waved his hand and said, “Qin Yu, forget it. Spare his life...”

Qin Yu immediately frowned and then looked at Gu Taichu.

“Spare his life? Master Gu, he betrayed you and wanted to kill you, but you still want to plead for him?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Gu Taichu waved his hand weakly and said, “Forget it. Forget it. I don’t want to fuss over it anymore...”

“Did you hear that? My master said that he doesn’t want to fuss over it anymore!” Chi Feng felt like he had been granted amnesty and shouted excitedly.

However, in the next second, his voice suddenly stopped.

Qin Yu smacked Chi Feng’s head, and the Heaven Swallowing Technique instantly appeared!

“Master Gu forgave you, but I didn’t forgive you, so... you’d better die!” Qin Yu said coldly.
