Chapter 1014: Chapter 1014, is this your trump card? 

At this moment, Qin Yu’s aura had already become extremely different!

His entire body was exuding a tranquility that was like water. However, within this tranquility, it also seemed as if there was a violent storm that could set off boundless waves at any time!

That kind of terror that could not help but emanate from the bottom of his heart caused Li Ziqi to feel extremely uneasy!

A trace of gratification flashed across the pavilion master’s face. She even had some anticipation. She wanted to see just how powerful Qin Yu was after becoming a martial saint.

Li Ziqi held the pavilion master with one hand and could not help but take two steps back.

He said coldly, “Kid, I don’t want to fight with you now. Let me leave. Otherwise, I will kill her!”

As he spoke, Li Ziqi grabbed pavilion master’s hand and quickly increased his strength!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold, and his eyes burst with a cold light.

“Do you think I’ll agree to it?”Qin Yu walked towards Li Ziqi step by step.

Li Ziqi’s expression changed, and he shouted, “Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill her!”

“In front of me, you no longer have the right to threaten me,”Qin Yu said coldly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Before he could finish his sentence, Li Ziqi felt a gentle breeze pass by his eyes!

By the time he regained his senses, his right hand had already been chopped off by Qin Yu!

Meanwhile, the pavilion master was also held in Qin Yu’s arms.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye. The entire process took less than a second!

Li Ziqi looked at his broken arm and a wave of intense pain immediately assaulted him.

However, the intense pain on his body could not be compared to the fear in his heart!

Both of them were martial saints, yet Qin Yu had saved him in the blink of an eye! This already showed the difference in strength between the two of them!

“Pavilion Master, Are You Alright?”Qin Yu hugged the pavilion master with one hand and asked quietly.

Pavilion master shook his head, but fresh blood flowed out from the corner of his mouth.

Qin Yu did not say anything. He raised his palm and placed it on the pavilion master’s chest.

A wave of warmth instantly flowed through Qin Yu’s palm and spread throughout his entire body.

Pavilion master was shocked to discover that the pain in his body had completely disappeared!

Even his internal Qi had recovered by a few percent at this moment!

“Pavilion Master, Wait for me here,”Qin Yu said.

Pavilion master nodded, his eyes filled with gratification.

Not far away, Li Ziqi’s expression changed. He seized this opportunity and turned around to escape!

However, he only managed to escape a few steps before he realized that the space in front of him had been sealed!

Turning around, he saw Qin Yu reaching out with a single hand. With a twist of his finger, that space was completely sealed!

Not to mention the physical body, even the primordial spirit could not escape!

Li Ziqi clenched his fist and threw it crazily at the space in front of him, but he realized that he could not break free at all!

This immediately caused Li Ziqi to be greatly alarmed!

He turned around and glared at Qin Yu, shouting, “Brat, I am a member of the Heavenly River Mystic Realm. If you kill me, the Heavenly River Mystic Realm will not let you off!”

“Heavenly River Mystic Realm... I’ll go take a look.”Qin Yu said coldly.

Li Ziqi gritted his teeth and glared at Qin Yu as he roared crazily, “We’re both martial saints, I might not be afraid of You!”

“Everyone says that you’re invincible in the martial saint realm. Today, I, Li Ziqi, want to see for myself!”

After he finished speaking, Li Ziqi waved his hand and rays of light shot towards Qin Yu from his sleeve!

The rays of light were like a violent storm as they bombarded towards Qin Yu with crackling sounds!

Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch as he allowed the rays of light to shoot towards him.

When all the Rays of light touched Qin Yu’s body, they instantly melted!

This seemingly powerful move did not even leave a single white dot on Qin Yu’s body!

When Li Ziqi saw this, his expression instantly became extremely ugly!

“How is this possible!”Li Ziqi was incomparably terrified!

Although he realized that Qin Yu was definitely not an ordinary martial saint, he did not expect that the gap between the two of them would be so huge!

“It seems that I can not hold back anymore.”Li Ziqi took a deep breath.

He glared at Qin Yu angrily as he slowly closed his hands.

That huge blade once again formed between his hands!

This technique was Li Ziqi’s trump card!

Even Qin Yu’s heavenly tribulation was split into two by this technique!

Therefore, Li Ziqi was extremely confident in this technique!

“Kid, it’s not too late for you to regret now!”Li Ziqi said coldly.

However, Qin Yu did not say a word. He only looked at Li Ziqi coldly.

His eyes were filled with contempt, as if he was looking down on an ant.

“You dare to look down on me!”This gaze completely infuriated Li Ziqi!

He said furiously, “Brat, I will make you pay the price!”

After a furious roar, the large saber in Li Ziqi’s hand condensed into form!

Both of his hands fell from the sky, ruthlessly slashing downwards!

The large saber carried a fierce aura as it ruthlessly slashed towards Qin Yu!

“Be careful!”Pavilion master immediately cried out in alarm when he saw the situation!

However, Qin Yu’s face was still filled with contempt. There was not the slightest fluctuation in his expression.

He stood there without moving an inch, as if he was looking at a jumping clown.

“You’re dead meat!”Li Ziqi roared!

That huge blade ruthlessly slashed towards Qin Yu!

Just as it was about to land on Qin Yu’s body, Qin Yu gently tilted his head.

The huge blade brushed past Qin Yu’s face and smashed onto Qin Yu’s shoulder!

“Clang!”

A deafening sound shook the entire valley!

Li Ziqi’s expression turned extremely ugly at this moment!

From the initial fear, it turned into horror, then from horror to despair!

The huge blade smashed onto Qin Yu’s shoulder, and the ground beneath Qin Yu’s feet instantly exploded and collapsed, sinking several meters!

However, Qin Yu’s figure remained unmoved!

Li Ziqi’s trump card had actually not been able to hurt Qin Yu in the slightest!

“How... how is this possible!”Li Ziqi’s forehead was covered in cold sweat, and his entire body was trembling non-stop!

This broadsword that could even cut through the heavenly tribulation had not been able to hurt Qin Yu in the slightest!

“Is this your trump card?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Li Ziqi trembled like a leaf and could not say a word.

In the next second, Qin Yu raised his finger and gently flicked the broadsword.

The broadsword instantly turned into ashes and disappeared without a trace.
