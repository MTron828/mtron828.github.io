2060 Exchanging for the Tribulation Magical Artifact

It seemed that the Si family was really eager to get Wu Ji’s hidden treasure, even if it meant handing over the Si family’s immortal scriptures!

“The Si family’s immortal scripture was created by the Immortal Emperor. Its value is not inferior to the Traceless Immortal Scripture.”

“That might not be the case. Wu Ji has integrated nine different dao techniques in an unconventional way. It’s even tougher compared with the Immortal Emperor. If one can obtain his dao techniques, one can step into a cultivation realm comparable to the Immortal Emperor even without the appearance of the Golden Age in the future!”

“Speaking of which, Xuan Jizi is a little strange. As a True Saint, he should have the confidence to enter the Chaos Graves. Why did he give up the supreme bone?”

“Didn’t you hear what he said? His vitality energy has depreciated, so he probably doesn’t want to take this risk. However, the Immortal Emperor has a heaven-defying survival technique, so this Xuan Jizi obviously wants to live for a few more years.”

Looking at Holy Lord Si, Xuan Jizi smiled and said, “I won’t disturb you anymore. See you three days later.”

After saying this, Xuan Jizi turned around and left.

After he left, someone walked up to Holy Lord Si and whispered, “Holy Lord, are you really going to let Xuan Jizi read the immortal scripture?”

Holy Lord Si narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “As long as we can get Wu Ji’s hidden treasure, everything will be worthy. Moreover, Xuan Jizi is coming over to our Si family!”

The person beside him seemed to understand something. He whispered, “Should we let Supreme Elder take action?”

“We can only see if there’s a chance.” Holy Lord Si took a deep breath.

This Xuan Jizi was not to be trifled with. If he acted rashly, not only would he fail to obtain the supreme bone, but it would also affect the Si family. It might do more harm than good.

After that, Holy Lord Si looked at everyone and said, “If anyone else has news of the supreme bone, I hope you can tell me as soon as possible. My Si family will definitely remember his kindness.”

Seeing the grand event about to end, Qin Yu no longer needed to stay and planned to leave this place.

However, he had only taken two steps when a figure blocked his way.

This person was well-built, and his internal qi was extraordinary. There was an invisible sense of oppression on his body.

“You’re already here. Do you still want to leave?” the burly man said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the burly man and said, “What do you mean? Why can’t I leave?”

“You killed an elder of the Si family, yet you still dare to come to Astral Mountain. You’re so bold!” At this moment, Holy Lord Si strode forward, pushing the crowd aside, and came up to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu knew the Si family would never let him go, so he didn’t bother to say anything.

“You are the Holy Lord of the Si family? You look ordinary.” Qin Yu crossed his arms on his chest and acted like a top-notch martial artist.

Holy Lord Si was already filled with anger, to begin with. Now that he saw Qin Yu’s arrogance, he became even more furious.

“You’re indeed bad-mannered!” Holy Lord Si said coldly.

Hearing this, Qin Yu instantly laughed out loud and said, “What? You’re going to kill me and I still have to be well-mannered? Go to hell with manners!”

“Are you courting death?” Holy Lord Si was instantly furious!

“Looking at your behavior, I think you’re the Holy Lord of the Si family by inheritance, right? Your strength doesn’t seem to be strong. Other than inheritance, I really can’t think of any reason for you to be the Holy Lord,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

At this point, Qin Yu slapped his head and said, “I understand now. You must have given birth to a good son. Riding on him, you became the Holy Lord, right?”

Holy Lord’s expression turned even uglier.

There was no other reason than what Qin Yu said was true!

It was because he gave birth to a chaotic body that he was qualified to inherit the position of the Holy Lord!

Otherwise, it was absolutely impossible for him to become the Holy Lord with his strength!

The surrounding people were even more shocked. They seemed to be unable to believe the scene in front of them!

The dignified Holy Lord of the Si family was scolded by a junior like Qin Yu. It was simply unbelievable!

Holy Lord Si was so angry that his entire body trembled. He wanted to tear Qin Yu into pieces immediately, and the killing intent on his body grew even stronger.

However, Qin Yu continued, “Holy Lord Si, your Si family’s elder was not capable enough and was killed by me. Doesn’t he deserve it? What? Only your Si family can kill people, but others can’t fight back?”

“You have a sharp tongue. Do you think it’s useful to say such nonsense?” Holy Lord Si said coldly.

Qin Yu laughed heartily and said, “Of course, it’s useful. At least I can vent my anger! You’re just a Lord who bullies the weak and fears the strong. You were just beaten up by Xuan Jizi and vomited blood. You don’t even dare to let out a fart. What? Are you venting your anger on me now?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The surrounding people were all amazed, and some even gave Qin Yu a thumbs-up!

Everyone had long been dissatisfied with the nine great aristocratic families who were domineering.

It was just that no one dared to say it out loud because of the Si family’s powerful strength. Now that Qin Yu had spoken the words from the bottom of their hearts, how could they not be happy?

“Do it if you want to kill or slash me. How would a real man in the world be afraid of death?” Qin Yu spoke in a righteous manner.

Holy Lord Si couldn’t take it anymore. He waved his hand and slapped Qin Yu’s head fiercely!

Qin Yu did not dodge, allowing his palm to land on him.

“Smack!”

With a crisp sound, Qin Yu’s body was directly smashed into pieces. Then he fell onto the ground, fresh blood flowing non-stop.

However, not long after, the corpse disappeared and was replaced by a pile of spiritual herbs.

“It’s actually a clone?” Seeing this, everyone instantly understood!

“No wonder Qin Yu dared to speak so arrogantly. It turns out that his true body didn’t come at all!”

“The Si family seems to have been fooled.”

Holy Lord Si’s expression turned even uglier.

He had been humiliated one after another in front of everyone in the world today, which had tarnished the dignity of the Si family!

“Do you think that I can’t do anything to you just because you have a clone? Let me tell you, from today onwards, the Si family will definitely tear you into pieces. No matter what method I use, I will definitely find you!” Holy Lord Si said coldly as if he was trying to regain his dignity.

It was not difficult for the Si family to find Qin Yu. They had countless methods to calculate Qin Yu’s location. They could even use the magical artifacts to capture Qin Yu’s internal qi and to locate him.

However, the Si family had been focusing on the Chaos Grave recently, which was why Qin Yu had been allowed to be so “arrogant” for so long.

On the other end, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.

“What bullsh*t Holy Lord? In my opinion, he’s nothing more than a good-for-nothing,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

From this, it could be seen that the selection of the Holy Lord was absolutely unfair.

“Speaking of which, I wonder if the supreme bone that Xuan Jizi mentioned is true,” Qin Yu whispered to himself.

After much thought, Qin Yu decided to leave the Chaos Grave for the time being to exchange for a tribulation magical artifact.
