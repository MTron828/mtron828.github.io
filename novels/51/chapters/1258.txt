Chapter 1259: Chapter 1,259, wanted by the Heavenly Cloud sect 

Qin Yu looked coldly at the disciples of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, but he didn’t feel much fear in his heart.

Even their elder, Qin Yu, wasn’t afraid at all, let alone just a few disciples.

“Sirs, please come in.”

Those people glanced at the waiter, then took out a portrait and said coldly, “Have you seen this person?”

The person in the portrait was none other than Qin Yu.

Qin Yu slightly narrowed his eyes, and divine power surged all over his body. He seemed to be ready to make a move.

The waiter stared at it for a long time, then shook his head and said, “I haven’t seen him.”

The people of the Heavenly Cloud sect nodded and said, “Put this picture on the wall. Tell us immediately if you see him.”

“Don’t worry, I Will!”The waiter said eagerly.

These people didn’t say anything more and immediately strode over.

They released their divine sense, as if they wanted to find Qin Yu’s figure.

However, at this time, Qin Yu didn’t have any fluctuation of spiritual power, which caused them to be unable to catch Qin Yu.

As the saying goes, coincidences don’t make a book.

There was no space in this restaurant. They looked at each other and then walked toward Qin Yu’s position.

They sat down opposite Qin Yu and said coldly, “Are you done eating? Hurry up and leave after you’re done.”

Qin Yu picked his teeth and said, “I’m not done eating.”

“Get lost if you’re not done eating. We have commandeered this table,”another disciple said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You commandeered it? What does it have to do with me? I said I commandeered your wife. Can you send your wife to me later?”

As soon as these words were said, everyone in the restaurant couldn’t help but gasp!

“Damn, a warrior...”

“Challenging the heavenly cloud sect is really... audacious.”

The faces of the few disciples of the Heavenly Cloud sect instantly turned cold.

One of them even drew a long sword and pointed it at Qin Yu’s neck, saying coldly, “Do you know who you are talking to?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to speak when the luxuriously dressed young master at the next table walked over.

He cupped his hands and said, “Sirs, there’s no need to be angry. How about this? Why Don’t you come to my table? Today’s meal is on me.”

Qin Yu raised his head and glanced at the young man. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This young man was none other than the young man Qin Yu intended to rob from him.

The people from the heavenly cloud sect coldly said, “None of your business. Scram to the side.”

After saying that, they continued to coldly look at Qin Yu and said with a smile that was not a smile, “If you cut off your own legs now, we might be able to spare you.”

Qin Yu also said indifferently, “Leave the money you have on you and scram immediately. I can also spare you.”

“Hahaha!”The people from the Heavenly Cloud sect couldn’t help but laugh loudly.

“No one dares to talk to us like that!”

“A trash who doesn’t even have spiritual power dares to challenge us like this. He doesn’t know death!”

With that, the sword brought along a sharp wind and stabbed towards Qin Yu’s glabella!

When everyone saw this, they couldn’t help but sigh in their hearts.

Another human life.

“Clang!”

But in the next second, everyone was stunned.

Qin Yu stretched out two fingers and easily caught the sword.

That Disciple’s expression changed slightly. He tried to struggle, but found that he couldn’t break free at all!

Then, Qin Yu exerted a little strength with his hands, and a clear buzzing sound was heard.

The sword broke with the sound! As for that disciple, he took a few steps back!

The expressions of those disciples instantly turned ugly.

They looked at Qin Yu warily and said coldly, “We are from the Heavenly Cloud sect. Who Are You? Aren’t you afraid that our sect will blame us?”

“I have already offended the heavenly cloud sect. What’s there to be afraid of?”Qin Yu slowly raised his head and said with a faint smile.

The few of them sized up Qin Yu’s face and then exclaimed, “You... you are that Qin Yu!”

Before they could react, Qin Yu’s Iron Fist had already arrived!

In just a short ten seconds, these few people were beaten into meat paste and fell to the ground.

The surroundings were silent.

How many years had it been? Someone actually made a move against the heavenly cloud sect, and his methods were so decisive!

Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Qin Yu wiped the blood stains on his body.

Then, he walked in front of these people and searched around, taking all the money he had with him.

“F * ck, they are quite rich.”Qin Yu shook the money bags and found that these people actually had thousands of spirit coins on them.

Qin Yu casually took out a money bag and threw it to the waiter at the side, saying, “Waiter, pay the Bill!”

The waiter hurriedly returned the money bag and said with a terrified expression, “I don’t dare to take it. Just... just treat it as our treat. Hurry up and leave.”

Qin Yu took back the money bag and rolled his eyes, saying, “Forget it, save it.”

This place was not a place to stay for long. Qin Yu did not dare to waste time and immediately strode out of the restaurant.

He walked on the street in boredom. For a moment, he didn’t know where to go.

Qin Yu’s understanding of the holy region was pitifully low. He didn’t have many friends here, not even a person to consult.

This also caused Qin Yu to lose his target for a short period of time, not knowing what to do.

“Friend, please wait a moment.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from behind Qin Yu.

Turning around to look, it was actually that luxurious young master from the restaurant just now.

“Brother, please wait a moment.”The young man said with a smile.

Qin Yu sized him up and said, “What’s the matter?”

The young man said with a smile, “Brother has offended the heavenly cloud sect. I’m afraid you don’t have any good places to go now. Why Don’t you come with me?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said in surprise, “You plan to find a hiding place for me? Aren’t you afraid of getting yourself into trouble?”

The young man smiled and said, “I like to make friends widely, especially those who are brave and capable.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Then I’ll have to trouble you, Brother.”
