Chapter 517: Extremely Powerful Talent! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This ray of light was extremely sharp, as if it was going to cut through the air.

The man with the mustache was startled. He hurriedly leaped up and dodged it.

“F * ck, is he trying to take my life?” The man with the mustache patted his chest and muttered softly.

Not far away, Qin Yu finally stood up from the ground slowly.

He clenched his fists, as if he was feeling the power in his body.

“I finally feel a trace of the power of a Martial Marquis.” Qin Yu sighed softly.

Although the half-step Martial Marquis realm wasn’t a clear realm, he could clearly feel the power of a Martial Marquis!

It was said that once one stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm, one would enter a drastically different realm. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Before this, Qin Yu didn’t understand. But now that he could clearly feel the different power in his body, he finally understood.

“Just a trace of the Martial Marquis’s power made me feel a huge gap in power,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“If I stepped into the Martial Marquis realm, I would really enter another realm.”

In the cultivation world, the Martial Marquis was the equivalent of the Golden Core Stage.

At that time, the body would give birth to the Golden Core. It was naturally very different from cultivating with one’s internal organs!

In other words, from the Golden Core Stage onwards, it would be true cultivation!

“Now, I can go and try out the power of the Dragon Vein.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although it was only a thin line, the difference in strength was completely different.

The Consummate realm was far below the half-step Martial Marquis realm.

“How is it? Have you stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm?” The man with the mustache ran over and asked.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “You seem to know quite a lot.”

The man with the mustache said with a smile, “I have dug up many people’s ancestral graves and read countless pieces of information!”

At this point, the man with the mustache said carefully, “To tell you the truth, I also dug up a huge tomb of a chaotic body!”

“Really?!” Qin Yu was stunned and quickly looked at the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache said proudly, “Of course it’s true!”

“Bring me to take a look when you have the chance,” Qin Yu said seriously.

Qin Yu’s understanding of the chaotic body was practically zero.

And a huge tomb of a chaotic body might be able to answer Qin Yu’s doubts, or even clarify the right path.

“Alright, it’s time to go up.” Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the Dragon Vein above.

The man muttered, “You go up first. When you’re done, inform me.”

Qin Yu stared at the Dragon Vein and climbed up step by step.

...

Above the Dragon Vein, these dozen or so members of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were sitting cross-legged here while absorbing spiritual energy.

To them, the spiritual energy seemed to be endless. Even after a few days of absorption, there was practically no reduction.

Meanwhile, Xia hang was still in closed-door cultivation.

He was trying his best to break through to the Martial Marquis Realm!

At this moment, a ray of light suddenly lit up from below.

“Huh?”

Yan Yuqi was the first to notice the abnormality.

He opened his eyes and immediately looked at the bright light.

“Qin Yu?”

It was none other than Qin Yu, who had been kicked off the cliff!

A cry of alarm instantly woke many people up.

They stood up one after another and looked at Qin Yu, who wasn’t far away.

“Qin Yu is actually alive?”

“Didn’t President Xia say that he was already crippled? How come he doesn’t look like he’s crippled in the slightest?”

Just as they had said, Qin Yu was currently in high spirits. His hair flapped wildly, and he gave off a magnificent vibe. How come he didn’t look like he was crippled in the slightest?

“Qin Yu has killed several half-step Martial Marquises before! This is troublesome!”

“That’s right. President Xia is still in seclusion. Who here can stop him...”

“What are you guys afraid of?!”

Just as everyone was panicking, Yan Yuqi took a step forward.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, I was just regretting not being able to fight with you. Since you aren’t crippled, it’s a perfect chance!”

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Yuqi and said, “You’re not my match. Back off.”

Yan Yuqi’s pupils dilated and his expression changed drastically!

He was actually looked down on?

“Qin Yu! You’re looking down on me?!” Yan Yuqi said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Even if you and I were of the same level, you’re still not my match. What’s more, you’re only at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm.”

Yan Yuqi shouted, “I’m honored to fight someone above my realm! So what if I am a half-step Martial Marquis? I, Yan Yuqi, can still kill you!”

Yan Yuqi’s internal qi surged, and he was full of fighting spirit. He had the intention to attack.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Yuqi coldly and said, “Fine, since you want to die, I will satisfy you.”

“How arrogant!” Yan Yuqi roared, and his body immediately glowed!

At the age of eighteen, Yan Yuqi had already learned the top cultivation technique of the Yan family!

He raised his hand and used the Divine Rank cultivation technique, the Mystic Heavenly Sage Hand, which was passed down from the Yan family!

A huge hand with rolling might came crashing towards Qin Yu!

In an instant, the ground beneath Qin Yu’s feet began to explode!

The people around were also forced back by the pressure!

Qin Yu, who was at the center, was expressionless. His gaze looked extremely indifferent.

“Go to h*ll!”

Yan Yuqi roared and this huge hand lashed out fiercely at Qin Yu!

“Bang!”

However, Qin Yu stood there without moving at all while allowing this huge hand to land on his body!

“This cultivation technique isn’t bad, but it also depends on who uses it,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Yuqi’s expression changed drastically!

This Mystic Heavenly Sage Hand was a genuine Divine Rank cultivation technique, yet it was unable to harm Qin Yu in the slightest?! How was this possible?!

Buzz!

Not far away, a ray of light lit up from Qin Yu’s palm.

A similar large hand began to slowly condense!

“Mystic Heavenly Sage Hand?!” When he saw this scene, Yan Yuqi’s heart pounded!

How could Qin Yu also know Mystic Heavenly Sage Hand technique?

“It’s said that Qin Yu once used a very short period of time to learn He Teng’s trump card move!”

“From the looks of it today, he really lives up to his reputation!”

“He actually learned a Divine Rank cultivation technique so quickly!”

“Although it isn’t perfect, there’s no one else in the world who can comprehend this technique in such a short period of time!”

When Yan Yuqi heard this, he was exasperated!

He had spent three whole months comprehending the Mystic Heavenly Sage Hand before he barely managed to learn it.

Yet, Qin Yu only took a glance at it before he was able to copy it!

What kind of talent was this?!

“Although this Divine Rank cultivation technique isn’t bad, it’s a waste in your hands,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Before he finished his sentence, Qin Yu had already waved his hand down!
