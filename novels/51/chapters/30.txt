Chapter 31: Treat a Radish Like It’s Ginseng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Shen Tian’s face was red up to his ears as he struggled to pull his hand away.

But Qin Yu’s grip was as tight as an iron vise and Shen Tian’s hand was stuck.

Realizing that Shen Tian had scrunched up his face, Qin Yu asked in a concerned tone, “Mr. Shen, what’s the matter? Why are you grimacing? Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?”

Qin Yu’s words made Shen Tian’s blood boil.

”Why are you not speaking? Mr. Shen, I am something of a medical practitioner myself. Why don’t I take a look at your condition?” Qin Yu offered flippantly.

”L-Let go of me!” Shen Tian roared in rage.

”Ah. Why didn’t you say so earlier?” Qin Yu acted like he had an epiphany and released his clutch.

Qin Yu’s sudden release caused Shen Tian’s body to lose balance. The taller man took several steps backwards in an attempt to stabilize himself. But he ended up plonking onto the ground, landing heavily on his backside.

”Mr. Shen, what’s going on? Are you alright?” Qin Yu pretended to be worried and came over to help him up.

Shen Tian shoved Qin Yu’s hand away and scolded, “Are you treating me like a fool?”

”Whoa. Mr. Shen, where did this even come from? I don’t understand what you are talking about,” Qin Yu noted with a smug.

”Why, you little!” Shen Tian gritted his teeth. He drew in a deep breath in an attempt to calm his nerves.

”I’m not gonna stoop to your level and argue with you.” Considering that Yan Ruoxue was with them, Shen Tian replaced his angry expression with a gentle smile.

Qin Yu, too, did not want to bother bickering with the likes of Shen Tian. So, he took out his Aqua Rhyme Pill and presented it to Yan Ruoxue.

”Miss Yan, we’ve known each other for some time already, yet I never had the opportunity to give you a present. This is my token of appreciation. I hope that you will accept it.” Qin Yu handed the box to Yan Ruoxue.

Before Yan Ruoxue accept the gift, Shen Tian could be heard jeering, “What’s with that shabby-looking box? Did you get it from the flea market? Judging from its appearance, it costs only a hundred dollars at most.”

”Nonsense!” Qin Yu shot Shen Tian a glare and continued, “I got this from the dollar store!”

Shen Tian snickered, “Wow. That’s really generous of you, Mr. Qin. To think that you had the guts to give Miss Yan a tacky gift like that! Are you insulting her?”

”On the contrary, I like this.” Yan Ruoxue stretched her hand to receive the gift box.

”Thanks a lot, Qin Yu. I really love it,” Yan Ruoxue murmured as she grinned from ear to ear. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Shen Tian glowered angrily at the sight of Yan Ruoxue’s unexpected happiness.

”Miss Yan, I brought you a gift as well,” Shen Tian declared in a supercilious tone.

”I heard rumors that you have been procuring medicinal herbs lately. After searching high and low in Chuzhou with my connections, I finally found a ginseng root that is over a hundred years old.” Shen Tian took out an exquisite gift box and handed it to Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue took the gift box with an impassive look.

Upon seeing that, Shen Tian felt a little disappointed. But he was not a quitter. He asked, “Miss Yan, don’t you want to take a look at it?”

”Is there a need for that?” Yan Ruoxue declined euphemistically.

”Miss Yan, I think you should at least take a peek,” Qin Yu suggested enthusiastically.

A ginseng root that was over a hundred years old was considered a sacred treasure to Qin Yu.

If Qin Yu were to attain one for himself, he could easily reach the third or even the fourth level of the Qi Refining Stage.

”Alright.” Yan Ruoxue nodded.

With that, she opened the sandalwood box.

A ginseng root could be seen inside of it.

”Look, dude. This is what you call a gift. Even the box itself is beyond your purchasing power, let alone the ginseng root inside,” Shen Tian bragged with a snobbish attitude.

Taking a glance at the ginseng, Qin Yu remarked, “My gift may not be extravagant, but it is a sincere one at the very least. Very unlike you, who calls a radish a ginseng root, yet still feels proud of himself.”

”Mr. Shen, should I consider you uneducated, or are you perhaps trying to fool Miss Yan?”

Color drained from Shen Tian’s face, and he exclaimed, “What do you mean?”

”What do I mean, you say?” Qin Yu grabbed the ginseng root.

”This is just an ordinary ginseng root that was artificially cultivated. Its medicinal effect is comparable to that of a regular radish.

”If the seller deceived you, then I could only say that you were ignorant.

”But if you did it on purpose, then you are essentially conning Miss Yan!”

Beads of cold sweats formed on Shen Tian’s forehead as Qin Yu let out a volley of remarks.
