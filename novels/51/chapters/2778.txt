Chapter 2779: The Bottom of the Cliff

“If she used the power, I’m afraid I won’t be her match even if I use my peak power. Fortunately, the number one kulapati appeared by accident and saved my life.”

“Her cultivation technique is creepy indeed. Her entire body seems to be controlled by blood. Every part of her body is a killing weapon.”

It was no wonder that the power gave people a creepy feeling thinking of Qin Ji’s previous battle style.

“She’s just a person being controlled. The core is the power of the skeleton. That’s the true core of Creepy. As long as one is possessed, one will become that strange appearance. Moreover, it’s extremely difficult to kill Creepy once it’s formed. Although her head was removed just now, she probably didn’t die. And that Smoker Xie has even more powerful Creepy. Many people have died at his hands over the years, including those at the top.”

Aiden stared at Qin Yu and gave him a detailed introduction.

Qin Yu also felt that it was novel. It was the first time he had seen such a strange power.

“If you decide to go, you must avoid a few places. These are all places with top-notch Creepy. It shouldn’t be a problem to gather other powers later.”

“Is there anything special about this power? Why did the Guardian of Order specially come to collect it?”

Qin Yu was curious.

“I’m not sure about that. However, this kind of power has an extreme impact on people. If it’s a person with a firm mind, it might be able to have some effect on cultivation.”

“In that case, shall we set off now?”

Qin Yu was also a little curious.

“Oh right!”

Chang Mang suddenly shouted, frightening Qin Yu.

He took out a jade butterfly with flowing lights revolving on it.

A light ring suddenly appeared after Chang Mang placed his palm on it.

Then, Qin Yu’s face appeared on it.

“It’s you indeed. This is a joint arrest warrant from the Guardian of Order, Path of Heaven Academy, and the Upper Dome. I just missed out on something. It still has to be you to be able to cause such a huge commotion.”

Chang Mang knocked his head hard.

“Don’t you think it’s too coincidental? Chang Mang had already received news of Yi Yun heading to the bottom of the cliff before Qin Yu came here. These three major forces have power all over the Saint Kingdom. Perhaps they already knew about you when you were on the spaceship.” Aiden shook his head. The elven race was cautious.

He immediately sensed that something was wrong.

“Who cares? If there’s anything, I’ll just do it! I don’t care about such things.”

Chang Mang laughed sinisterly.

“What a boor!”

Aiden rolled his eyes.

Recalling the scene of him dealing with this fellow, he looked at Qin Yu.

“Well said. Let’s do it!”

Qin Yu sneered.

You guys…

“Sissy, get lost if you’re afraid.”

Chang Mang swallowed the drumstick in his hand in one gulp, then chewed the bones with crunching sounds.

Aiden rolled his eyes again and ignored Chang Mang.

“Aiden, you don’t have to force yourself if you don’t want to go. The deal I made with you back then and the Heart of Saint Kingdom’s Vessel also allowed me to achieve a breakthrough in the Demon Sealing Valley.”

Qin Yu knew what Aiden was thinking.

The elven race valued promises the most. Aiden had made an oath when he exchanged for the Sun Chasing Bow.

If he could leave the Demon Sealing Valley alive, he would follow Qin Yu for three years. He did not expect them to meet again here.

“I’ll go with you.”

Aiden suddenly said firmly.

“The promise is only one of the reasons. The most important thing is that I’ve seen myself as innocent. After entering the village of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, I realized that my talent was just a little. The Queen had paid a great price in exchange for the divine flame runes to allow me to enter this place. I used to be high-spirited and confident that I would stand at the top of this kingdom. However, I felt that I was even more ridiculous when my strength increased.’

Qin Yu was silent when he heard this. He was the same.

Even if he tried his best, he still could not see the dawn of eternal night.

This feeling of powerlessness almost crushed him completely, especially after the trip to the Tomb of Heavenly Sins in Lingxu City.

“In that case, let’s set off.”

Qin Yu said indifferently.

Aiden led the way as he explained the situation at the bottom of the cliff to Qin Yu and Chang Mang.

“There is a small path that leads to the bottom. It is best to walk down slowly and see what happens before taking action. Otherwise, it will cause a huge commotion if we fly down. Even those above Dao Realm level 9 wouldn’t be able to survive.”

These were all bloody lessons that were spread in the stories.

Even Dao Realm level 13 top experts died in there.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang nodded. Just because they were not afraid of danger did not mean they were fools.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The three of them walked on a path that only one person could pass through. The scene in front of them was pitch black.

Qin Yu snapped his fingers and a flame lit up in front of him.

As the Primal Chaos Flame burned, the miasma in front of them dodged.

Even the originally cold and bone-chilling internal qi suddenly became much warmer.

“What is this thing? It seems like my body is afraid of it.”

Chang Mang was very curious.

“Primal Chaos Flame. You better not touch it.”

Qin Yu looked at the eager Chang Mang and hurriedly reminded him.

“Is it the Primal Chaos Flame, one of the three divine flames of the Primordial Chaos?”

Aiden was shocked and immediately stopped to maintain a distance from Qin

“Don’t worry, it won’t lose control.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh when he saw Aiden’s expression.

It was not a problem for him to control such a small Primal Chaos Flame with the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth and the great improvement in his spiritual sense.

The few of them carefully walked down the narrow stairs. At this moment, the surroundings were deathly silent and the sound of their footsteps landing on the ground could be heard clearly.

A voice that sounded like a baby crying suddenly sounded in the darkness ahead.

Even though Qin Yu was prepared, he still felt goosebumps all over his body when he heard this sudden voice.

“Be careful. There might be Creepy here. No living thing can survive here unless it’s a parasitic human or demonic beast!”

Aiden quickly reminded.

As the few of them continued to descend, the terrifying crying sound became clearer and clearer.

A ferocious head suddenly appeared in front of the Primal Chaos Flame.

Her face slowly melted, revealing the ghastly white bones inside.

Her sinister pupils stared at the three people who were slowly walking down.

Her expression did not change even when her entire body melted. It was as if she had no sense of pain. Chang Mang felt his hair stand on end.

“What the f*ck is this? It looks like an evil ghost..”
