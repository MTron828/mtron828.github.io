There were at least dozens of people hiding in the surrounding area, each with their own internal qi.

Qin Yu retracted his internal qi. He looked at Xiao Yu and said, “Wait for me here. Don’t go anywhere until I come back.”

Xiao Yu stubbornly said, “I want to go with you!”

“No, this is a very dangerous thing. You can’t go with me,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Xiao Yu said, “I’m also a Martial Marquis now. I’m not afraid of danger.”

Seeing that he couldn’t dissuade Xiao Yu, Qin Yu had no choice but to take her downstairs.

After going downstairs, the sharp man with the mustache quickly sensed the abnormality.

He sniffed and then looked around, his fingers constantly gesturing in the air.

“The birth of ten-thousand-year-old herbs?” The man with the mustache said with a frown.

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “How did you know?”

“Professional instinct,” the man with the mustache said.

Although Qin Yu was a little surprised, he didn’t say anything.

More and more people gathered in the vicinity. Soon, more than twenty Martial Marquises appeared in the vicinity.

“Qin Yu, you came in time.” At this time, Song Shan and Ancestor Guan walked over.

Qin Yu glanced at them without saying anything.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Song Shan and Ancestor Guan at all.

“There are at least dozens of Martial Marquises here today to snatch the ten-thousand-year-old herbs. Do you think you have a chance?” Ancestor Guan snorted coldly.

“Shut your mouth. Whether I have a chance or not has nothing to do with you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Ancestor Guan snorted lightly and said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu, you better be careful in case someone tries to assassinate you.”

“Are you threatening me?” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold and he immediately took a step forward.

A powerful pressure came at him and Ancestor Guan’s expression changed slightly.

“Qin Yu, we’re here to help you. Why would we threaten you?” Song Shan hurriedly tried to smooth things over.

Qin Yu looked at them coldly and said, “I’m telling you, it’s best if you don’t plot against me. Otherwise... I don’t mind killing you first!”

Song Shan’s expression changed slightly, and he was a little angry inside.

But for some reason, Song Shan couldn’t say a word.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with the two of them anymore. He turned around and walked to the side.

The man with the mustache was still gesturing in the air, as if he was searching for something.

At this moment, Granny Qin walked over from not far away with eight purple-robed men.

The purple-robed men were extremely eye-catching under the sunlight, and their identities attracted the attention of countless people.

“Purple-robed men? People from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“They’re actually targeting it too. This is troublesome.”

“Eight purple-robed men have been dispatched. It seems like the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is taking this matter very seriously.”

Many of the Martial Marquises in the surroundings came from outside forces.

They were naturally somewhat fearful of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

After all, many of the overseas forces had been captured by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. The ones who had taken action were basically all purple-robed men.

Granny Qin seemed to be extremely satisfied with everyone’s attitude.

She placed her hands behind her back and swept her gaze around.

Wherever her gaze landed, everyone subconsciously turned their faces to the side to avoid making eye contact with Granny Qin.

This made Granny Qin even more satisfied and a sense of superiority arose.

Then, Granny Qin led her people and strode in the direction of Qin Yu.

“You really dare to come,” Granny Qin said with narrowed eyes.

“Why wouldn’t I dare? Even an old b*stard like you has come. How could I miss it?” Qin Yu mocked.

Granny Qin sneered. “Sharp-tongued brat, let’s see how long you can be arrogant for!”

After saying that, Granny Qin glanced at Qin Yu’s side and sneered. “With just the three of you, you dare to fight for the ten-thousand-year-old herb? You must be dreaming.”

Then, Granny Qin glanced at Xiao Yu and said sarcastically, “You call such a young child here to die? But I have to say, Qin Yu, your luck with women is not bad.”

“In the past, Yan Ruoxue suffered for you. Now, such a young child is willing to die with you.”

At the mention of Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu’s expression didn’t look too good. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You’d better shut your mouth,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Granny Qin didn’t pay attention to Qin Yu. Instead, she smiled and looked at Xiao Yu.

“Little girl, since you have entered the Martial Marquis realm at such a young age, with such talent, you can be said to be a genius. Are you interested in joining the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?” Granny Qin said with a smile.

Xiao Yu glanced at Granny Qin, but didn’t say anything.

Granny Qin put on a kind look and said, “Joining the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is an official job. It is a glorious matter. It is much better than being by the side of a hooligan.”

Looking at Granny Qin, Xiao Yu sneered. “Shut your mouth. Your breath is a little stinky.”

The moment she said that, Granny Qin’s expression darkened.

She looked at Xiao Yu coldly and said, “You shameless b*stard, I’d like to see what kind of ending you’ll have!”

Xiao Yu said with a mocking expression, “With your age, I reckon you won’t be able to see that day. You might just die tomorrow.”

“You!” Granny Qin’s expression turned cold. She was so angry that she laughed. Pointing at Xiao Yu, she said, “Well then! I hope you won’t regret it!”

Granny Qin knew that she wouldn’t be able to gain anything, so she turned around and left with the eight purple-robed men.

There were more and more people around them. Many Martial Marquises had gathered together.

Some had three or five people, while some had seven or eight people. Among them, the most powerful was naturally the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Why isn’t he here yet?” Qin Yu looked at the time and couldn’t help but frown.

Did Tang Mo forget about this matter?

At this moment, an old man walked over from not far away.

Seeing this old man, many Martial Marquises surrounded him. Even Granny Qin was no exception.

“Who is that person?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

From the attitude of everyone towards him, this person was probably extraordinary.

“Divination master Chou Heguang,” the man with the mustache at the side said.

“Divination master?” Qin Yu was even more surprised.

The man with the mustache grunted and said, “They rely on divination to determine the location of the birth of the treasure, so they are very popular.”

“There’s such a profession...” Qin Yu touched his chin and said in a low voice, “I have to go over and take a look.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked over eagerly.

As Qin Yu walked forward, Granny Qin looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“You aren’t welcome here,” Granny Qin said coldly.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “Am I here to look for you? What has it got to do with you?”

“Granny Qin is right. You are indeed not welcome here,” Chou Heguang said indifferently.

Qin Yu frowned immediately.

“Get lost!” Granny Qin scolded coldly.

Qin Yu looked around, and it seemed that everyone had a cold look on their faces.

Although he was a little unhappy, Qin Yu could only turn around and leave dejectedly.

“F * ck, you actually don’t want me to listen.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

The man with the mustache at the side sneered. “It doesn’t matter. Chou Heguang is known as a master, but in reality, he has failed eight times out of ten. He’s not even worth mentioning.”
