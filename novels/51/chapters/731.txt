Hearing Tang Mo’s voice, Qin Yu hurriedly came down from upstairs.

He said apologetically, “Young Master Tang, I’m really sorry. Someone came to find trouble just now and accidentally broke your things.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took out his bank card and handed it to Tang Mo.

“Young Master Tang, this is your compensation,” Qin Yu said.

Tang Mo waved his hand and said, “Forget it. If it’s broken, then it’s broken. There’s no need to be so formal.”

Qin Yu wanted to say something, but Tang Mo suddenly asked, “You said someone came to find trouble? Who is it? Doesn’t he know that this house is mine?”

“I don’t think so.” Qin Yu spread his hands.

Tang Mo muttered, “If I catch him, I’ll kill him!”

After saying that, Tang Mo asked his attendant to take out a set of keys.

“Stay here. The house is empty,” Tang Mo said.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “No need. We can stay here.”

Tang Mo said, “Alright then. I’m just here to see how you’re doing.”

After saying that, Tang Mo planned to leave.

At this time, Qin Yu suddenly blocked Tang Mo’s way.

He was silent for a moment and said, “Young Master Tang, I have something to discuss with you.”

“What is it?” Tang Mo asked.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Have you heard the news that a ten-thousand-year-old herb will be born here soon?”

“Ten-thousand-year-old herb?” Tang Mo raised his eyebrows. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You came for this?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, this ten-thousand-year-old herb is very important to me.”

Tang Mo narrowed his eyes slightly. He walked to the sofa and sat down. Then, he asked, “Then why did you tell me? In the territory of Tang City, no one can snatch what the Tang family wants.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Even if I wanted to hide it, I’m afraid I can’t hide it.”

“More importantly, Young Master Tang is so impressive. I won’t be able to compete with you.”

The last sentence immediately made Tang Mo smile.

He said proudly, “Of course! At least you know what’s good for you!”

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Tang Mo was really vulnerable to praise.

“Speaking of which, I don’t interfere in these matters. It’s my family’s responsibility.” Tang Mo touched his chin.

“I think my father and the others should have known about this ten-thousand-year-old herb long ago.”

Qin Yu’s brows instantly furrowed.

The Tang family had already set their eyes on this herb. How could he still have a chance?

“But I can discuss it with my father,” Tang Mo said in a low voice.

“How about this? Wait for my news. If there’s a chance, I’ll bring you to see my father.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Then thank you, Young Master Tang.”

Tang Mo waved his hand and then swaggered off.

In the evening, Tang Mo called Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, my father has agreed to see you. I’ll send someone to pick you up later,” Tang Mo said.

Qin Yu agreed, “Okay.”

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu walked to the door and waited there quietly.

About ten minutes later.

A rolls-royce slowly drove over.

As soon as the car stopped, the attendant hurriedly opened the car door for Qin Yu and said respectfully, “Mr. Qin, please get in the car.”

After Qin Yu got into the car, the car rushed towards the Tang family.

On the way, Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at the scenery outside the window.

One had to say, the scenery of Tang City was indeed beautiful and moving.

After driving for more than an hour, they arrived at a manor.

This manor was built extremely extravagantly, and its area was frighteningly large.

At a glance, the entire manor was filled with traces of man-made work. Even the trees had been trimmed.

The buildings in the villa were somewhat different, and golden yellow hue could be seen from time to time.

It was very obvious that they had spent a large amount of money on this manor, and it didn’t fit in with the scenery of Tang City.

The car stopped at the entrance of a villa.

The attendant opened the car door for Qin Yu and said politely, “Mr. Qin, Young Master is waiting for you inside.”

Qin Yu nodded. When he walked into the villa, he saw Tang Mo sipping tea.

“Young Master Tang.” Qin Yu went over to greet him.

Tang Mo stood up and said, “Let’s go. My father is waiting for you.”

Qin Yu followed behind Tang Mo and walked toward a teahouse.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the door of a teahouse.

The structure of this teahouse was extremely luxurious. Besides gold, it was also inlaid with diamonds.

Qin Yu touched his chin and roughly guessed Tang Mo’s father’s personality.

Tang Mo led Qin Yu into the teahouse. As soon as they entered the door, a gallant aura rushed toward them.

At the end of the teahouse sat a middle-aged man.

This man was Tang Mo’s father, Tang Sheng.

“Dad, Qin Yu is here,” Tang Mo walked over and said.

Tang Sheng looked up and casually said, “Have a seat.”

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Nice to meet you, Mr. Tang.”

Tang Sheng didn’t say a word. He just kept brewing the tea again and again.

“Tang Mo, you can go out first.” A moment later, Tang Sheng waved his hand.

Tang Mo got up and said, “Sure, Dad. You guys can have a good chat.”

Tang Sheng didn’t say anything. After Tang Mo left, Tang Sheng finally raised his head.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Are you Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu thought to himself, “Isn’t this obvious?”

“I heard you caused an uproar in Jingdu by yourself?” Tang Sheng continued.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “You must be joking, Mr. Tang. It was just a small skirmish.”

Tang Sheng snorted and said, “In my eyes, it was indeed a small skirmish. In Tang City, no aristocratic family is worth mentioning.”

Upon hearing Tang Sheng’s words, Qin Yu basically determined his character.

“I heard that you want to take a 10,000-year-old herb from the Tang family?” Finally, Tang Sheng got to the point.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes. Although this herb hasn’t been born yet, since it’s grown in Tang City, it belongs to the Tang family.”

“So, I still need Mr. Tang’s approval,” said Qin Yu with a smile.

When he heard Qin Yu’s flattery, a trace of smugness obviously flashed across Tang Sheng’s face.

Although it was only a flash, Qin Yu still saw it.

“Since you know it belongs to My Tang family, you still dare to ask for it?” Tang Mo put down the teapot in his hand and said.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “This ten-thousand-year-old herb is very important to me. I think a mere ten-thousand-year-old herb isn’t worth mentioning in front of the Tang family. It’s like wild grass on the roadside.”

“Who doesn’t know the status of the Tang family in Tang City? Who doesn’t know that the Tang family is as rich as a country? Who doesn’t know that the patriarch of the Tang family, Tang Sheng, holds the number one resources in the world?”

“Those 10,000-year-old herbs are a rare holy object for me. To the Tang family, they are just a stalk of grass, a mere stalk of grass. I think Mr. Tang definitely doesn’t care about it, so I wanted it.”

As he listened to Qin Yu’s smarmy words, the smugness on Tang Sheng’s face couldn’t be hidden any longer.

Although he tried his best to hold back the smugness on his face, he couldn’t help but smile complacently in the end.
