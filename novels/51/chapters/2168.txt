2169 Jue Wu Coming Out of Seclusion

After a moment of silence, Yao Qi nodded and signaled Yan Tianshi to leave with him.

The two arrived at a hidden place, just the two of them.

Yan Tianshi looked at Yao Qi and said in a deep voice, “You have seen the situation today. The only solution is to hand over the two who attacked Qin Yu.”

Yao Qi was stunned and angrily said, “What are you talking about? Do you want the Yao family to be responsible for your Yan family’s mistakes?”

Yan Tianshi placed his hands behind his back and said coldly, “This is the only choice we have now. Otherwise, Yan Ruoxue will not easily give up this matter.”

“That’s because you didn’t discipline her properly. What does it have to do with my Yao family?” Yao Qi sneered and said. “They have contributed to my family, yet I send them to their deaths. How do I be a decent person?”

Yan Tianshi looked at Yao Qi and said coldly, “To tell you the truth, I indeed can’t discipline her. There are only two choices now. Either the Yan family and the Yao family start a war, or you surrender the two persons and let the matter rest.”

“You!” Yao Qi was instantly enraged. Yan Tianshi’s tone was so overbearing, and Yao Qi was naturally tremendously displeased.

However, he knew Yan Tianshi’s character well. He was extremely hot-tempered, and Yao Qi could tell from the last time Yan Yunshi fought with Dean Lei with a celestial artifact.

If he disagreed, Yan Tianshi would probably start a war with the Yao family!

Yao Qi was silent, not knowing what to do for a moment.

“I don’t have much time for you,” Yan Tianshi urged. “If we can’t appease Yan Ruoxue’s anger, it will be a disaster for both of us. I will never give up the complete bloodline of my Yan family for the sake of your Yao family!”

Yao Qi was silent for a long time. Finally, he sighed and said, “I can do as you say, but you definitely can’t make me hand them over. I’ll give you a chance to kill them.”

Yan Tianshi’s expression finally eased up. He nodded slightly and said, “Alright, I won’t let your Yao family sacrifice in vain. Just take it as I, Yan Tianshi, owe you a favor.”

After saying this, Yan Tianshi turned around and left.

He pulled Yan Ruoxue and said, “Let’s go.”

“I won’t!” How could Yan Ruoxue agree so easily?

Yan Tianshi snorted and shouted, “Stop fooling around!”

After saying that, he grabbed Yan Ruoxue and turned to leave.

When the Yao family members saw this, they could not help but snort coldly.

Especially the two elders. They mocked and said, “You came to the Yao family to cause trouble. Do you really think you’re a favored daughter of the heavens?”

As Yan Ruoxue struggled, Yan Tianshi brought her out of the Yao family.

Yan Tianshi only stopped after they had walked far away.

But at this moment, Yan Ruoxue had already cried her heart out, tears streaming down her face. She looked at Yan Tianshi and whispered, “I’m sorry, but I… but I…”

Yan Tianshi turned to Yan Ruoxue and said coldly, “I will kill those two people who attacked Qin Yu. This is the best solution that I can give you.”

Yan Ruoxue raised her head and stared at Yan Tianshi in a daze. Tears rolled down her face, and Yan Tianshi could not bear to look at her face.

“I know this can’t appease your anger, but if you really want to attack the Yao family, work hard and grow. When you can take charge of the entire Yan family, the position of Holy Lord will be given to you,” Yan Tianshi said slowly.

Yan Ruoxue’s lips trembled as she nodded silently. She understood Yan Tianshi’s painstaking efforts and expectations.

Yan Ruoxue gritted her teeth and tried hard to control the anger and pain in her heart. She knew that she had to grow and become stronger to achieve the goal in her heart.

Yan Tianshi looked at Yan Ruoxue, sighed, and said, “Alright, let’s go back. Remember, you still have a long way to go. No matter what happens, I will always stand by your side.”

…

At Thunder Courtyard, Dean Lei did not say anything for a long time upon hearing the news.

He looked at the sky and murmured, “Are you really unwilling to save your son…”

There was no response to his words. He looked into the distance and finally let out a long sigh.

Even Dean Lei did not expect Qin Yu to encounter such a disaster on the path of the starry sky.

When it rained, it poured.

Coincidentally, Jue Wu’s internal qi drifted over from not far away.

Dean Lei’s expression slightly changed, and he instantly felt a hint of unease.

“D*mn it,” Dean Lei whispered to himself.

With Jue Wu’s character, if she knew about this, she would probably turn the world upside down!

Just as Dean Lei was about to block the news, Jue Wu had already rushed in excitedly.

She rushed into Dean Lei’s arms and said, grabbing his beard, “Old man, did you miss me?”

Dean Lei smiled bitterly and could only go along with their, “Yes, I did. The entire Thunder Courtyard missed you. Why? Have you broken through?”

“I’m only a hair’s breadth away from becoming a True Saint,” Jue Wu said proudly. “I probably can step into the True Saint Realm in a few days!”

At this point, Jue Wu said mysteriously, “Furthermore, I’ve comprehended more than half of the power of the purple cloud pearl! When I step into the True Saint Realm, I’ll definitely become invincible!”

Dean Lei said in surprise, “Is that true?”

“How can it be fake? By then, I will follow Qin Yu to fight the bullsh*t nine great aristocratic families!” Jue Wu waved her small fists and said.

Dean Lei’s expression slightly changed. He cleared his throat, attempting to change the subject.

However, how could Jue Wu give him a chance? Before Dean Lei could speak, Jue Wu asked excitedly, “Where’s Qin Yu? I want to have a good drink with him!”

Dean Lei was silent for a moment. He seemed not to know how to answer.

“What’s wrong, Old Man Lei? Are you mute?” Jue Wu grabbed Dean Lei’s beard and asked.

Dean Lei sighed and could only lie. “Qin Yu, he… he’s in retreat. He probably won’t come out for a while.”

“Oh, What a coincidence!” Jue Wu muttered, her tone carrying a hint of disappointment.

Dean Lei was afraid that Jue Wu would find out about it, so he quickly said, “Since you’ve reached the boundary of True Saint, why don’t you retreat together and wait until you become a True Saint before coming out?”

Jue Wu waved his hand and said, “No, no. I can’t. I’ve encountered a bottleneck. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come out.”

“If you still don’t let me eat and drink, I’m afraid I’ll go crazy!” Jue Wu placed her hands behind her back and paced back and forth in the room with an anxious expression.

Seeing this, Dean Lei could only say, “Alright then, I’ll get someone to set up a banquet now. I’ll drink with you!”

“Are you sure? Old Man Lei, can your old body take it?” Jue Wu said with slight disdain. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Just as Dean Lei was about to say something, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

“Dean Lei, I heard that someone built a cenotaph for Qin Yu!” a cultivator ran in shouting.
