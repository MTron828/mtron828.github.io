Chapter 109: Liu Shihui’s Visit Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu originally thought that there would be at most 20 pills. He never expected that the number would actually exceed this.

“28 pills are enough to support me to advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage.” Qin Yu, his heart filled with anticipation, clenched his fists.

After that, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time and hurriedly swallowed the pills.

There were more than twenty Qi Gathering Pills. Qin Yu could only consume and refine them one by one.

He swallowed the first pill and then slightly closed his eyes to feel the pill gradually blooming in his body.

When the pill entered his stomach, it felt like it exploded!

Dense spiritual energy flowed from Qin Yu’s stomach into his Dantian and then slowly flowed into his entire body.

In just two hours, a pill was completely melted!

And Qin Yu directly advanced to the sixth level from the fifth level of the Qi Refining Stage! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This shocked Qin Yu even more. He didn’t dare to delay, and hurriedly swallowed the second pill.

The second Qi Gathering Pill circulated even faster in Qin Yu’s body, and almost disappeared in an instant!

But this time, Qin Yu frowned.

This was because the second Qi Gathering Pill didn’t allow Qin Yu to advance to the seventh level of the Qi Refining Stage, and there wasn’t even the slightest change in his dantian.

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes and said with a frown, “Isn’t it said that each Qi Gathering Pill can make one advance a level?”

Although Qin Yu had expected the effect of the Qi Gathering Pill to become weaker and weaker along with the increase in strength, he didn’t expect the effect to be so weak on the seventh level.

“It seems that reality proves different from legends,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He wasn’t in a hurry to swallow the third pill. Instead, he looked at the Qi Gathering Pill in front of him and fell into deep thought.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu took a deep breath and decided to swallow the rest of the Qi Gathering Pill all at once!

If he took each pill one by one and refined them, it would take too much time.

“Even if I consume too many pills, there shouldn’t be any harm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he opened his mouth and threw the Qi Gathering Pills into his mouth one by one.

A total of twenty-six Qi Gathering Pills were swallowed into Qin Yu’s stomach. At this moment, Qin Yu felt as if his entire stomach was about to explode!

More than twenty pills were taking effect in his body at the same time. Qin Yu’s body was actually unable to hold on any longer!

Beads of sweat dripped from his forehead, and his lower abdomen was throbbing with pain!

“Ah...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but open his mouth and moan slightly.

Qin Yu had never felt such intense pain before. His body was trembling slightly, and his vision slowly dimmed.

“No!” Just when he was about to faint, Qin Yu clenched his teeth and forced himself to remain conscious.

He couldn’t help but think of Yan Ruoxue, and the words that Yan Ruoxue had said before she left!

“I absolutely can’t just collapse so easily.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He took a deep breath, and with his strong mental resilience, he endured the pain!

The Qi Gathering Pill exploded in Qin Yu’s body, and the rich spiritual energy rushed into Qin Yu’s Dantian like a swarm of bees.

Qin Yu endured the pain and tried his best to stabilize his state of mind.

Finally, after more than an hour, Qin Yu began to calm down bit by bit.

He seemed to have become numb to the pain. Even his trembling began to subside.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was surrounded by a light green light.

The light enveloped Qin Yu and isolated him from the outside world.

Spiritual energy slowly flowed into his body. Qin Yu felt the pain disappear and it was replaced by a warm current, as if he was soaking in a warm spring.

Qin Yu sat there with his legs crossed. His expression was calm as he fused spiritual energy with every cell in his body.

In the blink of an eye, an entire day had passed.

The sky gradually darkened and became filled with stars.

Yao Qing stood at the door of the room with his arms crossed over his chest. He looked around coldly, as if he was a guardian deity.

At this moment, a Land Rover drove over from a short distance away.

The car stopped steadily at the entrance of the villa. Then, a young man with two skinny men walked out of the car.

“Phew, the environment here really isn’t bad.” The people who came were none other than Liu Shihui and his entourage!

He looked at the beautiful scenery around him and couldn’t help but snort. “Qin Yu really knows how to enjoy himself.”

“Yeah, Jiangcheng is a small place, but it’s quite suitable for retirement.” Liu Shihui’s entourage also smiled and said.

Liu Shihui didn’t say anything more. He looked in the direction of the villa and waved his hand. “Let’s go and visit Qin Yu.”

After saying that, Liu Shihui brought his men and walked into the villa.

Yao Qing, who was standing at the door, quickly noticed Liu Shihui at the door.

He immediately took a step forward and blocked Liu Shihui’s way.

“This is Mr. Qin’s private residence. Please step back,” Yao Qing said coldly.

“How dare you?! Who do you think you are? How dare you talk to our Young Master like that?!” Liu Shihui’s henchman immediately shouted!

Liu Shihui waved his hand and said with a nonchalant smile, “We have to be polite. Do you understand?”

After saying that, Liu Shihui looked at Yao Qing and said with a nonchalant smile, “I’m here to talk to Qin Yu about something important.”

Yao Qing still said with a cold expression, “I’m sorry. Our Mr. Qin has something to do. He won’t be seeing any guests for the time being. If there’s anything, you can tell me.”

Liu Shihui raised his eyebrows and said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu is quite cocky.”

“I’m sorry, Mr. Qin does have something important to do.” Yao Qing seemed polite, but there was a slight threatening tone in his voice.

“Kid, don’t be shameless!” At this time, Liu Shihui’s henchman suddenly shouted!

“Do you know who this is? He is Liu Shihui, the Young Master of the Liu family!”

When he heard this name, Yao Qing’s expression changed slightly.

Obviously, he had heard of Liu Shihui’s name.

“So it’s Young Master Liu.” Yao Qing frowned slightly.

“Young Master Liu, I’m very sorry. Mr. Qin really can’t see you for the time being. Why don’t you wait first? When he’s done, I’ll definitely tell him.” Yao Qing said with a slight bow.

Liu Shihui raised his eyebrows and sneered. “I rushed over from South City to see him, and you want me to wait? What, is this how you treat your guests?”

Yao Qing said awkwardly, “Young Master Liu, Mr. Qin really has something to do...”

“Cut the crap.” Liu Shihui’s henchman was a bit displeased.

“Get out of my way, or don’t blame us for being rude!”

Yao Qing’s expression suddenly became a bit ugly.

As an Inner Strength Master, he had naturally heard of the Liu family.

Yao Qing knew that he definitely wasn’t a match for these people!

But before Qin Yu went into seclusion, he said that he absolutely couldn’t let anyone disturb him!

Thinking of this, Yao Qing braced himself and took a step forward.

“Young Master Liu, please come back another day,” Yao Qing said firmly.
