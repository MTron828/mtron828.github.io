Chapter 2652: Blade of Destruction

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The rest of the force was something Qin Yu couldn’t contend with at the moment.

Qin Yu felt his blood boiling in his veins.

Visible blood mist evaporated from every pore on his body. His face was now completely flushed as he struggled to suppress the power of the Saint Kingdom’s divine flame.

Fortunately, there was no demonic qi on his body. Otherwise, the power of this divine flame would have expanded several times and engulfed him. “Where’s your arrogance now? Why are you suddenly so weak?”

Gu Tian sneered. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He was burning with anger. Although these five people were not particularly strong, they were considered his loyal followers.

Most importantly, Qin Yu had dared to disregard his words in front of so many people. This was something he couldn’t tolerate.

Wu Tian from the Ancient Demon Land was one thing, but this former prisoner dared to be so bold.

Meanwhile, in the distance, a bald monk appeared and observed Qin Yu’s body with some confusion.

“This guy’s current strength is pitiful. No wonder my cosmic luck is suppressing him when I use my Heavenly Eye.”

Hua Tian wore a puzzled expression. In purgatory, his strength had never surpassed Qin Yu’s.

The only time he had tried to attack was when Qin Yu was extremely weak, but even then, he had failed. “As you wish.”

Qin Yu spoke coldly.

Suddenly, the Destruction Saber within his sea of consciousness trembled slightly.

Qin Yu’s eyes turned pitch-black in an instant. The flames on his body seemed to tremble violently as if encountering a terrifying enemy.

“Stay obediently! ”

In a flash, the aura of the Destruction Saber descended upon the holy light flame.

The divine flame emitted a terrified emotion, shrinking into a small flame, too afraid to move.

“My divine flame?”

Gu Tian’s expression changed drastically. He immediately sensed that something was amiss.

The connection between his divine flame and Qin Yu’s body had been severed. No matter how hard he tried to control the main body of the divine flame, he couldn’t retrieve the separated flames.

“Impudent!”

Before he could react, he locked his gaze on Qin Yu, whose eyes had turned pitch-black.

An icy intent emanated from his sea of consciousness. As the aura of the Destruction Saber spread, everyone present was immobilized.

Especially the natives of the Demon Sealing Valley, who were especially sensitive to this aura.

They suddenly felt as if they were facing an ancient monster, and the aura seemed akin to that of a celestial god. Even if they wanted to resist, it felt like blasphemy.

This was the Order of Saint Kingdom that Qin Yu had comprehended from the Avici Dao’s Three Sabers, the Destruction Saber.

The Avici Dao’s Three Sabers were the core order of the Saint Kingdom. At this moment, the divine might of the power of rules spread out, leaving even Gu Tian, whose strength surpassed Qin Yu’s, unable to move. “Since you’re aligned with them, you can die.” Qin Yu stepped forward, his aura locking onto Gu Tian.

Gulp!

Gu Tian’s face was covered in cold sweat, and his legs trembled uncontrollably.

He tried his best to raise his arm, but it seemed futile. The sensation of facing the abyss filled him with an insurmountable fear.

“What kind of power is this?!” Gu Tian roared crazily in his heart.

And he wasn’t alone in his astonishment. Even Jing Xin and Ling’er, the strongest in the area, saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

This unremarkable youth had comprehended such a terrifying Order of Rules.

This power was so strong that they could not even have to resist.

Moreover, the stronger the Order of the Saint Kingdom, the more likely it was to develop its own will.

Qin Yu was also lucky that he would have the self-awareness to avoid recklessly probing into its depths.

Qin Yu let out a maniacal laugh. The black intent in his eyes seemed to have become deeper and deeper in a short period.

Within a short period, his consciousness was filled with black tides.

This black tide was filled with boundless brutal power, wanting to completely assimilate his consciousness, just like when he first faced Pang De’s Dao Saber.

Qin Yu activated the Destruction Saber and was about to slash out completely.

If this dragged on, he might end up like Pang De, completely under the control of the Destruction Saber.

“Stop!”

Just as Qin Yu was about to slash out with his saber.

r

lWvo voices sounded almost at the same time. A hand suddenly landed on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

After cutting off his connection with the Destruction Saber, he reached out with his other hand.

It collided with the other palm.

Pa!

A wave of energy rippled out from between their palms, pushing everyone present away with an irresistible force.

Standing before Qin Yu was a middle-aged woman, taller than him, with slight wrinkles on her face.

However, her features were flawless, exuding a captivating aura, whether from her cultivated techniques or innate charm remained unclear.

Qin Yu’s glance at her felt akin to facing a deeply respected elder, rendering him incapable of any disrespectful thoughts.

“Elder Xin Yue?”

Qin Yu’s realization struck. The one who had intervened to save him must be affiliated with one of the factions within the Demon Sealing Valley, Elder Xin Yue.

On the other side, a yellow-robed figure stood in opposition to Xin Yue.

“Leave him be, and I shall not pursue today’s events,” Elder Xin Yue said.

Gu Yi’s robe shifted as he pointed toward Qin Yu.

“Gu Yi, you know that’s not possible,” Xin Yue retorted, shaking her head. Gu Yi’s finger pointed into the void, and from it, a stream of Qigong surged toward Qin Yu.

Xin Yue’s expression shifted, and with a swift motion of her hands, a suit of battle armor materialized before her. It acted almost lifelike, actively shielding Qin Yu and intercepting the incoming Qigong.

Swish!

With a slight movement of his finger, Gu Yi redirected the Qigong, narrowly missing the armor and striking down an outsider nearby.

Beside Qin Yu, Jiang Feng, and Su Su were decapitated, their heads soaring into the air, their expressions frozen in disbelief as if unable to comprehend their sudden demise.

“Xin Yue, though your strength matches mine at the pinnacle of True Consciousness, you lack just a fraction. Do you truly believe you can shield them from me?” Gu Yi questioned, gesturing with one hand while forming a pentagram seal with the other, creating a symbol out of blood..
