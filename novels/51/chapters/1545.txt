Qu Zhu and Jue Wu shared the same thoughts. They both felt that Qin Yu should not take such a risk.

“The hunter organization has existed for so many years. Many sects have coveted them, but in the end, the results were all in vain. Qin Yu, your journey this time is too risky,”qu Zhu said.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “The heavenly cloud sect is so huge, what’s the final result?”

Qu Zhu was stunned, then he laughed and said, “That makes sense.”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Brother Qu Zhu, don’t worry. I know what to do. Although Zhong Wu has a saint weapon, with his ability, he might not be able to activate it.”

Qu Zhu seemed to want to persuade Qin Yu, but he felt that he could not persuade Qin Yu. In the end, he shook his head and said nothing.

“The Green Rock Forest is mysterious and unpredictable. I don’t know how many treasures have been unearthed in the Green Rock Forest,”qu Zhu suddenly said.

“Although the holy region is incomparably vast, in reality, there is very little mining in the Green Rock Forest. If you go to the Green Rock Forest, you might be able to obtain something.”

Qu Zhu’s words clearly had a hidden meaning. Qin Yu naturally understood.

And the reason why he went to the Green Rock Forest was also one of his goals.

Following that, Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu.

He moved in front of Jue Wu and said, “How do you feel now? Are you feeling unwell?”

Jue Wu rolled her eyes and said, “What discomfort can I have? I can eat, drink, and sleep as much as I want!”

......

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu knew in her heart that Jue Wu’s current physical condition was definitely not as relaxed as she had said.

Jue Wu had always been strong. If it were not for her discomfort, she would never have returned to Mount Hua Ning from the north.

“Then take care of yourself. I’ll be leaving first,”Qin Yu said.

After bidding farewell to Jue Wu, Qu Zhu, Qin Yu planned to set off for Qingyan Forest.

“I’ll send you off.”Qu Zhu walked forward and accompanied Qin Yu all the way to the mountain gate of Mount Hua Ning.

“Qin Yu, I’m afraid that Jue Wu won’t be as relaxed as she says,”qu Zhu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Zhu in surprise and smiled. “Our thoughts coincide.”

“Big Brother Qu Zhu, I want to ask you for a favor,”Qin Yu said with a solemn expression.

Qu Zhu nodded slightly, indicating for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Jue Wu’s myriad flower is definitely a great killing weapon for the northern lands.”

“Absolute dance’s current physical condition isn’t good. I’m worried that the northern lands will take the opportunity to take revenge, so... While I’m away, I hope you can take good care of her.”

Qu Zhu picked up the wine flask and took a sip. He slowly said, “Alright, I’ll do my best.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. Then, he didn’t waste any more time. He immediately summoned the Divine Eagle and headed straight for the Green Rock Forest.

With Qin Yu’s current state, he wasn’t afraid of anyone. The strength of a mighty realm cultivator was enough for him to stand at the top of the South Province.

Qin Yu rode on the Divine Eagle and cut through the sky, heading straight for the Green Rock Forest.

Two days later, Qin Yu arrived near the green rock forest.

In the middle of the Green Rock Forest and Gu City, a huge castle had been built at some point in time.

At this moment, the surroundings of this castle were filled with people and internal Qi.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “When did such a castle be built here? Could it be that the descendants of the aristocratic families are planning to establish a foothold here?”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and immediately activated his desolate God’s eye, heading straight for the castle.

He saw that the castle was filled with people, and there was a large group of people gathered at the entrance. He did not know what they were talking about.

Qin Yu thought for a moment, but in the end, he decided to go and take a look.

Therefore, he put away the Divine Eagle, jumped down from the sky, and walked toward the door.

On the way, Qin Yu looked at the people around him and asked, “Fellow Daoist, who built this castle and when?”

The people around him said, “You still don’t Know? The Qingyan Forest auction is about to begin!”

“Qingyan Forest Auction? What is that?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

The person smiled and said, “There are many treasures in Qingyan Forest. Every thirty years, a castle will be built here to auction the treasures.”

“Rumor has it that these treasures were taken out from the depths of Qingyan Forest!”The person said mysteriously.

This couldn’t help but make Qin Yu pale with fright!

Taken out from the depths of the Green Rock Forest? Who would be able to do that?

One had to know that the ferocious beasts at the edge of the green rock forest were something that even mighty realm experts couldn’t withstand, let alone in the depths!

“Then who organized the Green Rock Forest Auction?”Qin Yu asked with extreme puzzlement.

When he heard this, a hint of mystery flashed across that person’s face.

He moved closer to Qin Yu’s ear and whispered, “Rumor has it that the Qingyan Forest auction was organized by a person who walked out from the depths of the Qingyan Forest! Those treasures were also provided by him!”

Hiss!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath!

A person who walked out from the depths of the Qingyan Forest? What kind of existence was that?

“Of course, that’s just a legend. In any case, no one has seen it before.”Then, that person smiled and said.

After his explanation, Qin Yu became even more interested in the green rock forest auction.

Without thinking, he immediately walked towards the entrance of the auction.

Only after arriving at the entrance did Qin Yu learn that the requirements to participate in this auction were quite harsh. Other than having requirements for strength and money, the most puzzling thing was the last one:

Only itinerant cultivators could participate in this auction.

“What kind of rules are these?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter softly.

He swept his gaze behind him and saw many people standing at the door.

These people all had the logos of the major sects on them. Clearly, they were waiting for something.

“It’s really... Strange.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

This was the first time Qin Yu had heard of an auction for itinerant cultivators.

Fortunately, Qin Yu didn’t join any sect, so he easily passed their test.

“The Qingyan Forest auction will be held at eight o’clock tomorrow morning. Wait outside,”said the cultivator in charge of guarding the door.

Qin Yu glanced at the cultivator. He stretched out a strand of divine sense, wanting to test their strength.

However, when Qin Yu’s divine sense passed by the castle, it was instantly cut off.

“It seems that the person who built this castle is definitely not an ordinary person.”Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed as he sighed softly.

It was currently evening, and there was still an entire night before the start of the auction.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He found a place to sit down and slowly waited for the start of the auction. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Night soon fell, and more and more people gathered at the entrance.

The people from the sect seemed to be trying to rope in these itinerant cultivators.

They offered extremely favorable conditions, hoping that the itinerant cultivators would help them sell the treasures in the auction.

These sects used coercion and enticement to get many itinerant cultivators to agree to their requests.

Of course, there were also many powerful itinerant cultivators who ignored these sects.

Soon, Qin Yu was targeted by the sect.

Two men in Brocade robes walked toward Qin Yu.
