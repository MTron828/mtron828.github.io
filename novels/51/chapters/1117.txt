Chapter 1118: Chapter 1,118, Ancient Sect, divine firmament sect? 

Qin Yu nodded slightly when he heard the elder’s words.

The pressure under the sea was indeed great. Even Qin Yu could not withstand it, much less an ordinary martial saint.

“Why would the desolate divine eye hide under the sea?”Qin Yu could not help but mutter softly.

Could it be that it was as he thought? The world back then had long since sunk under the sea?

“I really want to go down and explore,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, with his current body, even if he risked his life, he would not be able to dive too deep. Therefore, he could only temporarily give up.

“Follow me down and find the desolate divine eye,”Qin Yu said to the old man.

The old man had long lost the will to resist and immediately nodded in agreement.

Following that, the old man took the lead and dived into the water. Qin Yu followed closely behind.

The two of them kept diving into the sea, causing the pressure on their bodies to increase.

When they dived down to about 8,000 meters, the old man could no longer bear it.

His entire body was slightly distorted by the pressure of the sea, and his mind was on the verge of collapse.

“Senior, I’ve reached my limit...”the old man said in pain.

“The desolate divine eye is about a thousand meters below. Senior, please take it yourself...”

Qin Yu did not make things difficult for him. With his physical body, he was indeed unable to take another step down.

“Alright, I understand,”Qin Yu replied.

Following that, Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden light.

With the augmentation of the saintly body technique, the pressure of the sea water instantly decreased by a lot.

Qin Yu carried this pressure and continued to dive downwards.

He released his divine sense and covered the surrounding waters, searching for the desolate divine eye.

Unlike what he had imagined, the desolate divine eye did not emit any light. The surroundings were pitch black. It was not as easy as he had imagined to find the desolate divine eye.

Qin Yu used the water avoidance art and then used his spiritual fire to rely on this glimmer of light to find the desolate divine eye’s location.

According to the distance that the old man said, Qin Yu explored about a thousand meters before stopping.

“It should be around here,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Under the sea, Qin Yu’s divine sense could not cover too far, so he had to rely on the naked eye to find it.

Fortunately, the location that the old man gave him was not too far off. Qin Yu found a hibiscus box about a thousand meters below the sea.

The box looked like it had been there for a long time. To Qin Yu’s surprise, the Hibiscus box did not rot under the sea water. In fact, it was in perfect condition.

Qin Yu had no time to think. He reached out his hand and grabbed the hibiscus box. Then, he sped up. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He arrived at the shore. The old man was still standing on the shore and did not leave.

When he saw Qin Yu coming ashore, the old man hurriedly walked over.

“Why haven’t you left?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

The old man cupped his hands and said, “Senior, although this desolate God’s eye is not fated with me, I am here for the desolate God’s eye after all. Therefore, I still want to see the true appearance of the desolate God’s eye. Please agree, senior.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and then nodded.

He took out the hibiscus box and slowly opened it in front of their eyes.

The moment the box was opened, a faint light was emitted from it.

This desolate God’s eye was not an eyeball. At a glance, it looked like a bead.

“Is this the desolate God’s Eye?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

The elder said excitedly, “That’s right, it is exactly the same as in the records! The desolate God’s eye is hidden here!”

Looking at the bead in the box, Qin Yu frowned and asked, “How should I use the desolate God’s Eye?”

The old man quickly said, “According to the records, the desolate God’s eye needs to recognize its owner with blood.”

He stared at the desolate God’s eye with greed in his eyes.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Thank you very much. This desolate God’s eye is mine. If there’s a chance in the future, I will definitely compensate you.”

The old man hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Senior, you’re too kind. Everything is fated. I have no fate with this item.”

This made Qin Yu slightly surprised.

He looked at the old man and said, “How did you know that the desolate divine eye is hidden here?”

The old man explained, “This is a map left behind by our sect.”

“Sect? What sect are you from?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

The old man did not dare to hide it and quickly said, “Senior, I am from the Divine Firmament sect. I am the 35th generation successor of the Divine Firmament sect. My Name Is Wang Zhou.”

“Divine firmament sect?”A hint of shock flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

“One of the branches of the three talisman sects?”

The old man quickly shook his head and said, “We are considered a branch of the divine firmament sect. We are still different from the real divine firmament sect. The real divine firmament sect has long disappeared.”

Qin Yu was even more shocked.

Qin Yu had heard of the divine firmament sect before. It was said that it was one of the three talisman sects that was passed down in the Northern Song dynasty. It was evolved from the Celestial Master Dao, and the five Thunder Talisman that it cultivated was famous throughout the world.

He did not expect that the old man in front of him actually had a myriad of connections with the divine firmament sect.

“In other words... you guys are evolved from the divine firmament sect?”Qin Yu asked.

Wang Zhou nodded and said, “To be precise, it’s a sect that has degenerated from the divine firmament sect. The real divine firmament sect might have escaped into the holy region.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Back then, the divine firmament sect’s five thunder talisman was famous for a while, so it couldn’t have disappeared just like that.

“Then do you know the Five Thunder Talisman?”Qin Yu continued.

Wang Zhou smiled bitterly and said, “I’ve only learned the basics. It’s far from the legendary five Thunder Talisman.”

Qin Yu nodded and then said with a smile, “The holy region will be opened very soon. You might be able to head to the holy region and find the real divine firmament sect.”

“I hope so,”Wang Zhou said with a wry smile.

Qin Yu did not say anything more. He took out the desolate divine eye and planned to use the old man’s method to bind it with blood.

The desolate divine eye emitted a weak light in Qin Yu’s palm. Qin Yu forced out a drop of blood essence from his glabella and sent it toward the desolate divine eye.
