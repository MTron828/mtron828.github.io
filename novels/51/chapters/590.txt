This Demonic Beast looked extremely huge, and its internal qi was extremely dense.

“What kind of spell did Yan Guiyi use to summon this Demonic Beast?” Qin Yu frowned and couldn’t help but think inside.

If he could obtain this spell, then he would be able to rely on the Demonic Beast to cultivate.

Yan Guiyi swept his gaze across the crowd and said, “Now, I will appoint a person to kill the Demonic Beast.”

Then, Yan Guiyi looked at Yan Jinyao and said, “Yan Jinyao, you do it.”

Yan Jinyao nodded slightly. He took a step forward and soared into the sky!

With a flip of his palm, a long sword fell into his hand!

Yan Jinyao held the long sword in his hand. With a wave of his hand, a huge sword light suddenly came from the sky!

“Swoosh!”

The sword light seemed like it was going to split the surface of the sea! The colorful light fiercely landed on the neck of the Demonic Beast!

“Roar!”

The moment the sword light landed, the Demonic Beast let out a hoarse roar!

Then, the head of the Demonic Beast was chopped off by the sword!

Seeing this, everyone couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

Just a single chop killed this huge monster?

This was a little too terrifying!

Even Yan Guiyi’s face flashed with a trace of admiration.

He nodded slightly and said, “As expected of the number one person on the ranking list!”

Yan Jinyao, however, appeared extremely calm. With a wave of his hand, he tore open the stomach of the Demonic Beast and took out an inner core.

He handed the inner core to Yan Guiyi, then retreated to the side.

Yan Guiyi smiled and said, “As everyone can see, this is the inner core! The inner core contains the purest spiritual energy, and it has a wondrous effect on cultivation.”

Then, Yan Guiyi once again used the Soul Guiding Spell and summoned a second Demonic Beast!

This Demonic Beast was very powerful, and the one who attacked was Kong Yun!

Kong Yun wasn’t inferior to Yan Jinyao. In just two moves, he subdued the Demonic Beast and took away the inner core!

The third Demonic Beast was attacked by Yao Meng!

Yao Meng’s method seemed to be much gentler. She raised her hand and slapped forward lightly. Boundless waves were instantly stirred up on the entire surface of the sea!

The penetrating force of this palm was extremely strong. The Demonic Beast immediately fainted and collapsed onto the ground.

As the fourth person on the ranking list, Qin Yu was naturally the next to attack.

Yan Guiyi glanced at Qin Yu, and a sinister look flashed in his eyes.

Then, Yan Guiyi put his hands together and mumbled something.

This time, the casting time was extremely long. It lasted for a whole few minutes, but there was no sign of Yan Guiyi stopping.

Not far away, He Teng seemed to have heard of the spell that Yan Guiyi was mumbling.

He Teng’s expression changed, and he exclaimed, “This is... This is the spell to summon the Qingfu Tortoise! Yan Guiyi actually wants to summon the Qingfu Tortoise!”

Han Wei, who was standing beside He Teng, frowned and asked, “What is the Qingfu Tortoise?”

He Teng said in a deep voice, “Young Master Han, to tell you the truth, Qingfu Tortoise is an Earth Rank Demonic Beast. Its body is indestructible, and it’s extremely fierce. Its terrifying strength is beyond imagination.”

When Han Wei heard this, he couldn’t help but sneer. “It seems that Yan Guiyi wants to use Qingfu Tortoise to get rid of Qin Yu.”

He Teng nodded slightly, “That’s right. The few Demonic Beasts that Yan Guiyi summoned before are nothing compared to the Qingfu Tortoise.”

“Hurry up and let him die!” Han Wei gnashed his teeth and said.

“Young Master Han, don’t worry. Qin Yu will definitely die this time,” He Teng said.

Following Yan Guiyi’s chants, a powerful internal qi blew over!

Although the Demonic Beast had yet to show itself, the immense pressure was suffocating.

“Boom!”

Finally, a huge Demonic Beast burst out from the surface of the sea!

This Demonic Beast was extremely huge. Its entire body was green and it looked like a turtle!

Unlike a turtle, it had fangs in its mouth and scarlet eyes. It looked extremely terrifying!

Yan Guiyi said indifferently, “Qin Yu, it’s your turn.”

Qin Yu could see Yan Guiyi’s intention. He glanced at Yan Guiyi and sneered. “You want to use this chance to kill me?”

Yan Guiyi played dumb and said, “What do you mean by using this chance to kill you? What? Are you blaming me for your own incompetence?”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to argue with Yan Guiyi. He stared at the huge Qingfu Tortoise in front of him with a solemn look.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the Qingfu Tortoise struck at Qin Yu!

What was shocking was that the Qingfu Tortoise was huge in size, but its speed was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, it had arrived in front of Qin Yu!

“How fast!” Everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

Qin Yu naturally didn’t dare to be negligent. He used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch and quickly retreated.

That huge palm slammed onto the ground fiercely.

The entire ground instantly buzzed, and a huge pit appeared in front of everyone!

“Hmph, as expected of the bottom class. Compared to the geniuses of the aristocratic families, he’s far inferior,” Yan Guiyi mocked.

Qin Yu ignored Yan Guiyi. His body erupted with golden light as he looked at the Qingfu Tortoise with vigilance.

“Boom!”

The Qingfu Tortoise struck out with its palm once again. The huge palm arrived in front of him almost instantly!

Qin Yu let out an angry roar as golden light appeared all over his body. Not only did he not dodge, but he even faced it head-on!

This was the physical collision between a human and a Demonic Beast! It was almost unprecedented!

“How reckless.” Seeing this, Yan Guiyi couldn’t help but sneer inside.

One must know that the inner cores of Demonic Beasts were much stronger than humans of the same level. It was definitely not something that humans could fight against!

“Boom!”

The giant palm of the Qingfu Tortoise and Qin Yu’s fist collided fiercely!

However, the giant palm of the Qingfu Tortoise didn’t stop at all. It pressed down directly!

“Qin Yu!” Everyone couldn’t help but roar when they saw the situation!

Even Yao Meng covered her mouth slightly!

“Fighting head-on with the Qingfu Tortoise is really reckless,” Yan Jinyao said.

“I remember that a few years ago, a Qingfu Tortoise once appeared on the surface of the sea. Later, an army was mobilized to kill that Qingfu Tortoise.”

“Yes, I also heard about it. It is said that a lot of modern thermal weapons were used.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

That huge palm pressed onto the ground while raising a hundred thousand feet of dust into the air.

Yan Guiyi’s lips curled into a cold smile. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I declare that Qin Yu is dead, and that the experiential learning has been a...”

“Boom!”

Before Yan Guiyi could say the word “failure,” the Qingfu Tortoise’s huge palm was propped up!

At a glance, a powerful golden light burst out!

Qin Yu’s body was constantly expanding, and his body was covered in a dazzling golden light!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu’s body grew to more than five meters tall! Not only that, but his body was also growing!

“Cosmic form!” Seeing this scene, Yan Guiyi’s expression couldn’t help but change!

“The cosmic form this time... is much bigger than it was last time...”

This made Yan Guiyi feel a trace of unease. One had to know that the cosmic form was a divine technique. Back then, it had caused a lot of trouble to the Martial Arts Association!

“Boom!”

Finally, the body that was over seven meters tall finally stopped!

Qin Yu opened the Qingfu Tortoise’s flesh. He stared coldly at the Qingfu Tortoise. The internal qi around his body was rising rapidly!

In the next second, Qin Yu clenched his fists. His feet shook, and his golden fist smashed at the Qingfu Tortoise fiercely!

That golden light was blinding!

The golden fist smashed at the Qingfu Tortoise’s head!

“Boom!”

This punch was astonishingly powerful. Its force exceeded everyone’s imagination!

“Phew!”

In the next second, something shocking happened.

Under this punch, the Qingfu Tortoise’s head exploded before turning into a puddle of blood!

Just one punch had shattered the Qingfu Tortoise’s head!
