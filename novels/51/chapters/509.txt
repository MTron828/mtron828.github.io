Chapter 510: So What If You’re a Genius Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The loud shout instantly attracted countless people’s attention.

Xia Hang quickly turned around and looked over coldly.

When he saw who it was clearly, his expression instantly became a bit cold and playful.

“Qin Yu?” Xia Hang sized up Qin Yu and said with a nonchalant smile, “Why are you here?”

“It’s none of your business whether I’m here or not?” Qin Yu didn’t show any mercy to Xia Hang.

Xia Hang wasn’t angry either. He said with a smile, “I remember the last time I saw you, you were only an Inner Strength Grandmaster? Or an Inner Strength Master Hands?”

“Now, I’m your father.” Qin Yu sneered.

“Qin Yu, I knew that it was impossible for you and Miss Yan to be together. Now, it seems that it’s true.” Xia Hang continued.

“It’s none of your business.” Qin Yu sneered.

Finally, Xia Hang couldn’t hold it in anymore.

His expression darkened and he said coldly, “Qin Yu, back then, you kept calling me Mr. Xia. What, now that you’ve stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm, you think you’re invincible?”

“How did I know you were a beast back then?” Qin Yu sneered.

Xia Hang narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, you really don’t know your place! Back then, I really should have slapped you to death!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You can come and try now! I remember clearly that contemptuous look of yours back then!”

Xia Hang raised his eyebrows and said, “Do you think I’m not your match?”

“Then you can come and try!” Qin Yu shouted angrily, and the energy suddenly exploded!

Xia Hang’s expression was cold, and he didn’t say anything for a long time.

In the end, he still didn’t make a move.

“This is the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s territory. For Miss Yan’s sake, I can pretend that I didn’t see you,” Xia Hang said coldly.

“If you don’t want to be caught, get lost quickly!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s territory? What territory do you have?! This is obviously a public resource, so first come first serve.”

Xia Hang narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, do you want to make an enemy out of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?!”

“Xia Hang, don’t think that I don’t know about the dirty things that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has done.” Qin Yu sneered.

“You sent people to follow me and secretly ordered people to kill me. Do you think that I don’t know?”

“Make an enemy out of you? Do you think that we are friends now?”

Xia Hang’s expression was gloomy. After a moment, he said coldly, “It seems that the people above are right. You really can’t be left to live.”

These words caught Qin Yu’s attention.

He glanced at Xia Hang and said with some doubt, “What do you mean?”

Xia Hang ignored him and changed the topic, “So, it’s impossible for you to leave today?”

“What do you think?” Qin Yu asked back.

He walked to the young man and woman and helped them up.

“Don’t worry about the Martial Arts Association. On the surface, it looks like a righteous organization, but in fact, it’s full of bullies,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The young man and woman looked at Qin Yu with a hint of admiration.

“You are Qin Yu? Everyone says that Qin Yu is a person who doesn’t distinguish between status. It’s true!” The two people said excitedly.

“Don’t be happy too early. Be careful not to stand on the wrong side,” Xia Hang said coldly.

Hearing this, the expressions of the two people immediately changed.

“Don’t worry. I will ensure your safety,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Xia Hang snorted coldly and didn’t say anything.

No one knew that from now on, the martial arts world’s commoners represented by Qin Yu and the wealthy represented by the various aristocratic families began to clash.

Gazing at this mountain range, Qin Yu tried to sense the spiritual energy.

However, he realized that standing here, he couldn’t sense even a trace of spiritual energy.

This made Qin Yu extremely confused.

Normally, the Dragon Vein must be a place where the spiritual energy gathered. How could he not sense even a trace of spiritual energy?

“That’s weird. This place isn’t what I imagined,” the mustached man muttered softly as he held a map.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What did you find?”

The mustached man quickly jumped to the side and muttered, “I’m not familiar with you. Don’t even think about implicating me. My great cause hasn’t been completed, so I can’t die.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “So you’re a coward.”

“Of course!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

For some reason, the man with a handlebar mustache had an indescribable pride towards his own cowardice.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to him. He stood nearby like Xia Hang and the others and observed for a while.

“Mr. Qin, can we really follow you?” At this time, the young man and woman suddenly walked forward and asked.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “I’ll try my best to protect you on this trip. As for whether you guys can follow me... We’ll talk about that later.”

Right now, Qin Yu’s primary goal was to fight Han Wei to the death.

As for whether or not they would follow him, it wasn’t the time to think about it.

After a simple self-introduction, he learned that the young man and woman were brother and sister.

The boy’s name was Cao Hong, and the girl’s name was Cao Ying. Both of them had the cultivation of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, and their talent wasn’t bad.

They followed closely beside Qin Yu. Wherever Qin Yu went, they followed.

Time flew by. Qin Yu observed for an entire hour, but he still couldn’t figure out what was strange about this Dragon Vein.

“No wonder it was reduced to a no man’s land.” Qin Yu sighed.

Under normal circumstances, the land of the Dragon Vein would be a place filled with outstanding talents.

But there was no spiritual energy here, so how was it like a Dragon Vein?

If it wasn’t for the Pavilion Master’s notice, no one would have thought that this no man’s land would be a Dragon Vein.

Perhaps it was because of this reason that the Dragon Vein could be preserved until now.

“So that’s how it is.” At this time, the man with the mustache muttered.

He rubbed his chin and said with a smile, “Today, I’m going to be rich!”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Rich? Do you think the people of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association are all pushovers? Be careful, or else you’ll lose your life.”

The man with the mustache wasn’t anxious. He muttered, “I’m not going to the Dragon Vein. Why would I be killed?”

“Not going to the Dragon Vein? Then what are you going to do?” Qin Yu asked casually.

The man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “Nothing.”

Qin Yu didn’t take it seriously. After all, this man with the mustache had always been crazy.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, a shout suddenly came from not far away.

After turning around, he saw a youth less than twenty years old walking towards Qin Yu.

This young man was none other than Yan Yuqi.

“What’s the matter?” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Yan Yuqi put his hands behind his back and said with a nonchalant smile, “I heard that you beat a half-step Martial Marquis when you were an Inner Strength Grandmaster, right?”

“So what if I did? So what if I didn’t?” Qin Yu asked.

Before Yan Yuqi could reply, Xia Hang took a step forward and said coldly, “Yuqi, you aren’t his match. Don’t act recklessly.”

Yan Yuqi snickered and said, “If he can defeat a half-step Martial Marquis at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, why can’t I, Yan Yuqi, do it?!”
