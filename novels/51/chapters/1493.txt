Chapter 1494: Chapter 1,494, the battle begins! 1

With the last dance, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

“Have a good rest. Let’s set off in a while,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, he found a di fan to sit cross-legged and meditate. The last dance, on the other hand, transferred spiritual Qi to Qin Yu for the second time.

This time, the spiritual Qi she transferred was still extremely dense, like an unceasing torrent of river water.

This shocked Qin Yu greatly. One had to know that the recovery of spiritual Qi was very slow. Last night, Jue Wu had just transferred spiritual Qi to him!

What was even more infuriating was that last night, Jue Wu had been eating, drinking, and having fun. How did her spiritual Qi recover?

“Comparing people is really infuriating,”Qin Yu could not help but think to himself.

After a short rest, the few of them got up and prepared to set off.

Qin Yu and Hua Zi’s battle location was in Yin Palace. This place wasn’t too far away, so it wouldn’t take too long.

Yin Palace.

Before dawn, there were already people waiting in ambush, planning to enjoy the battle up close.

“Qin Yu and Hua Zi are both Heaven’s chosen. Their battle will definitely be extremely interesting.”Someone thought to himself.

“Hua Zi is Yongji’s disciple, but we’ve never seen him fight before. No one knows exactly how capable he is, so I have high hopes for Qin Yu.”

“You can’t say that. Yongji is also so mysterious. Don’t tell me you still doubt Yongji’s strength?”

There were many different opinions. Some people hid in the void, while others stood in the shadows.

Yin Palace was an extremely special city.

Rumor has it that this place used to be a battlefield. After hundreds of years, the dark energy in this place dissipated.

Even so, Yin Palace was still a wasteland. Not a single blade of grass grew.

A moment later, Huazi appeared on the horizon alone.

He was dressed in tight clothes and his long hair was tied up behind his head. He looked extremely capable.

As the disciple of Eternal Pole, his temperament was also tainted with the characteristics of eternal pole. One could hardly feel the slightest fluctuation of his internal Qi.

However, his footsteps were incomparably light, as if he was floating in the air.

“Hua Zi is here.”Someone looked in Hua Zi’s direction.

“En? Why Is He alone? Could it be that Mr. Yongji isn’t coming?”

“He’s coming alone to take on the challenge? What boldness!”

Hua Zi walked over. Someone in the dark stood up and greeted him, and hua zi politely responded to them one by one.

“Mr. Hua, why didn’t Mr. Yong Ji Come?”Someone asked.

Hua Zi slightly bowed and said with a smile, “Foster father said that this is a spar between us juniors. I don’t want to get involved too deeply.”

“Mr. Hua, isn’t Mr. Yong Ji Afraid of losing to Qin Yu and dying in battle here?”Someone said in surprise.

Hua Zi said indifferently, “My foster father said that if I die in battle, I can only say that my skills are inferior to others. No one else can be blamed, and I won’t help.”

“As expected of Mr. Yong Ji. I admire you!”Someone cupped his hands, his face full of respect.

Hua Zi didn’t say anything more. He stood there, quietly waiting for Qin Yu’s arrival.

There was no wind or fire in this place. It was extremely quiet. The Sun was hanging above their heads, but they couldn’t feel the slightest bit of spiritual qi.

The people sent by the Tianyun sect had long been hiding in the dark, waiting for an opportunity to make a move.

This seemingly peaceful scene was actually moving in the dark.

In the remote area of Yin Palace, there were also several people hiding here.

They were all wearing black robes, and their faces could not be seen.

“Sir, are we really going to attack Jue Wu today?”A black-robed person asked.

The black-robed person who was leading the group said coldly, “Yes, Jue Wu, Qu Zhu, and Xiao Hai must die. We must kill them before we fully enter the Southern Region.”

“Are you sure that Jue Wu will come?”Someone asked.

The black-robed leader coldly snorted and said, “She will definitely come. Just Wait.”

“Qu Zhu has also sent people. After today, the Heavenly Cloud sect will no longer have the three madmen and three deadly ones!”

This was an extremely fierce battle. It was unknown what methods the people of the northern lands used to completely conceal their internal Qi. They could not detect it at all.

The Heavenly Cloud sect and the northern lands were planning to attack at the same time!

At the scene.

No one had noticed the commotion in the dark. They also didn’t know that today’s battle would most likely involve the battle between the northern lands and the southern province!

At this moment, Hua Zi, who had his eyes closed, suddenly opened them!

Two rays of light shot into the distance!

“They’re coming,”hua zi said coldly.

As expected, not far away, Qin Yu, Wen Dawen, and the others were walking over while Jue Wu was sitting on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

This strange combination couldn’t help but cause people to be quite surprised.

“What are you looking at? If you keep looking, I’ll dig out your eyeballs!”Jue Wu, who was sitting on Qin Yu’s shoulder, cursed.

The surrounding people didn’t dare to offend Jue Wu and retreated one after another.

After walking all the way to Hua Zi, Jue Wu jumped off Qin Yu’s shoulder.

She glanced around and said, “Where’s Yongji? Why isn’t he here?”

Hua Zi said proudly, “My godson said that this is between me and Qin Yu...”

“Alright, cut the crap. If he’s not here, then he’s not here. Anyway, I don’t want to see him.”

Before Hua Zi could finish, Jue Wu waved his hand and interrupted hua zi.

Hua Zi, who was about to show off, was suddenly interrupted. His face couldn’t help but be stunned, and his heart was extremely unhappy.

However, the person who interrupted him was Jue Wu, so he dared to be angry but didn’t dare to say anything.

“Qin Yu, come forward and fight. I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”Hua Zi, who was holding his breath, could only vent his anger on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took a step forward and said with a faint smile, “Are you Mr. Yongji’s first foster son?”

Hua Zi said with a faint smile, “We don’t differentiate between before and after. We don’t differentiate between high and low.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Then it seems that you aren’t,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Hua Zi’s face turned cold and he said in a cold voice, “Our Yongji city has a lot of talented people, and my foster father is even...”

“Alright, Alright. Don’t talk nonsense. It doesn’t matter if it’s not true. Anyway, it doesn’t matter.”Qin Yu imitated the way he performed the final dance and interrupted Hua Zi’s words.

Hua Zi’s face instantly turned red. His eyes glared at Qin Yu.

“Then stop talking nonsense. Let’s Fight!”Hua Zi said furiously.

The furious hua zi raised his hand and used a killing technique. His body turned into a beam of light and in the blink of an eye, he charged towards Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

Hua Zi’s fist was wrapped in a bright light. He threw out a punch that could shatter the sky and earth!

What was shocking was that Hua Zi’s punch seemed to have evolved some kind of spell. Tens of thousands of rays of light turned into the heaven and earth and slashed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression was calm. He raised his hand and used the absolute beginning sacred fist. Golden Light enveloped the earth and collided with Hua Zi’s killing technique.

In an instant, the heaven and earth collapsed. The collision between the two of them was like Mars colliding with earth, exploding with an extremely dazzling light!

“Such power with just a raise of his hand. He is indeed worthy of being a prodigy of the southern region.”Someone cried out in shock as he used his hands to block the incoming heat wave.

As for Qin Yu and Hua Zi, they were already locked in battle. Their bodies were enveloped in a layer of light that blocked their movements.

Looking over, one could only see two towering figures fighting with all their might!
