Wen Wanji, who was originally a forthright person, was clearly unable to hold on in the face of everyone’s praise.

In addition, he had already drunk the wine. He immediately waved his hand and said, “No need to say anything else. I agree to this matter!”

“No!”Qin Yu Drank Wen Wanji without even thinking.

He said coldly, “Master, you can’t go no matter what. Once you step into the northern lands, you’ll definitely die.”

“What has it got to do with you? It’s fine if you don’t want to contribute to the southern region, but don’t stop senior Wen Wanli!”

“That’s right. When the elementalists are resurrected, that will be a terrifying thing!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “As you all have seen, the people who went are all dead. So many people have died for no reason. Do We still need to let more people die?”

“Although elementalists are terrifying, there are always ways to deal with them. In short, no one can go to the northern lands now.”

Everyone wanted to say something, but they were immediately chased out by Qin Yu.

After chasing these people away, Wen Wanyun said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, I have to go. Otherwise, if word gets out, how will I, Wen Wanyun, be able to live?”

“Is being human more important or is being alive more important? No matter what, I won’t let you go,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Wen wanyun narrowed his eyes and said, “You want to stop me? Can You Stop Me?”

“Can I? I have to try,”Qin Yu said coldly.

A powerful internal Qi burst out from both sides.

Wen Da and Wen er hurriedly came forward and said, “What are you two doing? Are you going to fight? Can’t you discuss anything properly?”

However, Qin Yu and Wen Wanyun didn’t say anything. They just stared at each other coldly.

At this moment, Wen Wanyun suddenly put on a smiling face and said with a smile, “I’m just joking with you. Can I really fight with you? If you don’t want to go, then don’t go. Come, come, drink!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“After the elementalists are resurrected, we must join hands to suppress them,”Qin Yu raised his wine cup and said in a deep voice.

Wen wanyun sneered, “This has nothing to do with us. Leave it to Xiao Sheng. We’ll talk about it after Xiao Sheng loses.”

Qin Yu grunted and did not say anything else.

The next day.

After saying goodbye to Wen Wanyun, Qin Yu rushed to the northern border.

The northern region had been rather quiet these few days. They did not enter the southern region again.

However, everyone knew that the northern region only needed to delay for time.

When the elementalists were resurrected, it would be a true disaster.

“TSK TSK, why are you here?”When they saw Qin Yu rushing over, the group of people who had gone to the great Yue mountain a few days ago immediately surrounded him.

“If you didn’t let Wen Wanyi go to the northern lands, why did you come here to put on a show?”

“That’s right. You should hurry back.”

Qin Yu glanced at them. He casually grabbed a person and threw him directly to the northern lands.

The moment he stepped into the north, the cultivator immediately panicked and ran back to the northern border with all his might.

“What… What are you doing!”The cultivator who had escaped said with a terrified face.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Why are you so afraid? You keep telling others to go to the north. What are you afraid of?”

“I. . . That’s because I don’t have the strength of the reversion void stage. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be afraid!”He quipped.

Qin Yu raised his brows and said, “How do you feel after stepping into the northern lands?”

The cultivator frowned. He thought for a moment and said, “It’s indeed not very comfortable.”

“Is it not very comfortable, or very uncomfortable? If you haven’t experienced it clearly, I can send you again,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Hearing this, the cultivator immediately felt flustered.

He said somewhat unwillingly, “Alright. When I entered the northern region, I indeed felt very uncomfortable. It was as if my spiritual power was suppressed.”

“Although it was only for a moment, the feeling was indeed uncomfortable.”

Qin Yu looked at everyone coldly and said, “When the elementalists entered the northern border, was I Ever Afraid?”

Everyone shook their heads and did not say a word.

“Who was the person who defeated the elementalists back then?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

Everyone became even more silent.

“If I’m cowardly, what’s the point of doing all this?”Qin Yu asked.

A few questions instantly caused the scene to fall into silence.

“I know that all of you hate the northern lands and fear elementalists, but you have to maintain basic rationality at all times,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, they became much calmer.

Someone asked, “Then what should we do next? Should we just wait for the elementalists to resurrect?”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “Believe me, there will be a way. Moreover, the southern region does not lack experts. An elementalist is not worth being afraid of.”

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, no matter how unwilling they were, they could only reluctantly agree.

“Indeed, we need you to stop the northern land cultivators from entering. You’ve worked hard. The southern region will always remember you,”Qin Yu said sincerely.

After speaking to these people, Qin Yu turned around and left.

He had to cultivate as soon as possible. Before the elementalists were resurrected, he had to step into the half-step to the reversion void stage.

Once he stepped into the half-step to the reversion void stage, Qin Yu had the possibility of facing them head-on. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Not to mention killing an elementalist, Qin Yu was at least somewhat confident when facing Sima bei, Yongji, and the others.

…

The northern lands.

During this period of time, the strange movements in the northern lands were becoming more and more intense.

Other than the death river between the southern and northern regions disappearing, the death river in the other major regions was also slowly disappearing.

It would not be long before the entire Li Province would completely merge into one.

In a certain cold room, waves of internal Qi were being emitted.

These internal Qi seemed like Sima bei and Yongji were doing their best to recover their bodies.

In comparison, Sima Bei, who was slightly injured, had already recovered his divine sense. However, his body was still badly damaged and unable to move.

In this state, he would probably need to recuperate for a very long time.

He lay on the bed with his eyes slightly narrowed. No one knew what he was thinking about.

At this moment, a black-robed person suddenly walked in from outside.

He half-knelt in front of Sima bei and said, “Lord Sima Bei, the speed at which the death rivers of the various large plates are disappearing is getting faster and faster. At this rate, I’m afraid that they will completely disappear in a few days.”

Sima bei looked at him with difficulty and asked, “How much longer will it take?”

“Within ten days.”The black-robed man said.

This made Sima bei feel a little flustered.

If the various continents disappeared completely, no one could guarantee that the people of the other continents would not take the opportunity to deal with the northern lands.

“Lord Sima Bei, you don’t have to worry too much. In the entire Li Province, only the South Province is a Land of outstanding people. Everyone is coveting it.”The black-robed man said.

“As for our northern region, we can be said to be a land of disdain. No one is interested in us.”

Sima bei nodded slightly. These words made some sense.
