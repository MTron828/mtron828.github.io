1765 Primordial Spirit Damaged

People in Tianyun Sect naturally saw the scene.

Xiao Hai frowned, trying to get up, but he had not recovered yet, so he had to sit back down.

He Teng looked down at the crowd and said indifferently, “The North Plain is now history. I’m here today to give Qin Yu a gift.”

A gift for Qin Yu?

Everyone was stunned. What was the relationship between Qin Yu and He Teng?

He Teng didn’t say more. He raised his hand and took out a corpse.

This was Yuan Xiu’s corpse!

He Teng casually tossed the corpse to the side and said indifferently, “Yuan Xiu is already dead. I killed him.”

The entire Nanzhou was in an uproar!

Yuan Xiu was dead? And he was killed by the Godly King of the North Plain?

“What does He Teng want? Is he going to replace Yuan Xiu?”

“He must have killed Yuan Xiu to take over the North Plain!”

“We shouldn’t have let Yuan Xiu escape!”

Hearing their words, He Teng laughed coldly.

“I have no interest in the North Plain,” He said indifferently, “I’m only here to tell you this news.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The he shouted, “Qin Yu, there will eventually be a battle between you and me. I hope you don’t die before that!”

After saying this, the void began to slowly close until it was completely gone.

The news of Yuan Xiu’s death quickly spread throughout Nanzhou.

Some suspicious people even went to the North Plain personally.

After confirming that there were no more people in the North Plain, people gradually relaxed.

“He Teng. I remember this person.” On the Cultivation Mountain, Xiao Hai said.

“This person is only a mortal. He has relied on the White Bone Club in the Azure Rock Forest to get to where he is today,” Xiao Sheng said with a slight nod.

“He seems to have an unusual feud with Qin Yu,” Xiao Hai said.

“He Teng doesn’t seem to be a threat,” said Xiao Sheng with a nod.

“Yes, but it’s best not to underestimate an ambitious man. After all, the most powerful people in history never had a special physique or a powerful bloodline, ” Xiao Hai said.

Xiao Sheng agreed.

“I wonder how Qin Yu is doing. I haven’t been able to visit him,” Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

“Rest well and get better,” Xiao Sheng shook his head and said.

After saying this, Xiao Sheng left the Cultivation Mountain.

Dayue Mountain.

Qin Yu was lying in bed, looking very weak.

Everyone was waiting for Qu Zhu’s return, waiting for him to bring back a powerful pharmacist.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng walked in.

Upon seeing Xiao Sheng, everyone in the room stood up.

“Xiao Sheng, why are you here?” Jue Wu asked, somewhat puzzled.

Xiao Sheng pointed at Qin Yu, who was lying in bed, and said, “How is he?”

“Not good, not good at all. Can you heal him?” Jue Wu looked extremely worried.

Xiao Sheng walked to Qin Yu’s bedside and released a wisp of his aura to check his condition.

“His injuries are very severe.” Xiao Sheng’s brows furrowed.

“Of course! He is only a Peak of Mighty Realm Cultivator, but he had to withstand Yuan Xiu’s technique!” Jue Wu said angrily.

“It’s all that bastard Yuan Xiu’s fault. It’s a pity I didn’t kill him!”

At this moment, Qu Zhu finally returned from the East Continent.

He brought a pharmacist with him.

“You’ve finally returned!” When she saw Qu Zhu, Jue Wu ran over to him.

Qu Zhu nodded slightly, then introduced, “This is the most famous pharmacist in the East Continent, Pharmacist Meng.”

“Pharmacist Meng, please heal Qin Yu. If you can heal him, you’ll be under my protection!” Jue Wu said immediately.

“I can only try,” Pharmacist Meng said in a low voice.

He walked to Qin Yu’s bedside.

A trace of dark green aura appeared on his hand.

The aura touched the space between Qin Yu’s eyebrows and then entered his body.

As the aura seeped in, Pharmacist Meng’s brows furrowed even tighter.

Seeing this, Jue Wu and the others broke out in a cold sweat. They became even more anxious.

A moment later, Pharmacist Meng stood up with a serious expression.

“How is it? Can you heal him?” Everyone hurriedly came forward and asked.

Pharmacist Meng sighed slightly and said, “His injuries are very severe. Even his primordial spirit has been damaged. I probably can’t do anything.”

“Even you can’t do it?” Qu Zhu’s brows furrowed.

“The damage to the primordial spirit isn’t something I can heal,” Pharmacist Meng replied.

“What will happen if he stays this way for a long time?” Qu Zhu asked.

Pharmacist Meng looked at Qu Zhu and said in a deep voice, “His primordial spirit will slowly be exhausted, until his soul is completely destroyed.”

Hiss!

Everyone gasped when they heard that!

They knew that Qin Yu was severely injured, but they didn’t expect it to be this bad!

“You should go to Zhongzhou. You might find help there.” Pharmacist Meng shook his head.

He bowed and turned to leave.

Qu Zhu walked him out to see him off.

After he left, Jue Wu said in a deep voice, “I’m afraid it’s too late to go to Zhongzhou. We don’t have a teleportation formation. Even if we can come back alive, it will take a long time. ”

“Yeah, even if there’s enough time, who can guarantee that the pharmacists in Zhongzhou will help?” Wen Wanchong said in a deep voice.

“Leave this matter to me.” At this moment, Xiao Sheng suddenly spoke.

Jue Wu was stunned. She looked at Xiao Sheng and said with excitement, “You have a way?”

“I can only try,” Xiao Sheng said in a deep voice.

“I will give you an answer in three days. ”

After saying that, Xiao Sheng turned around and left.

....

An uninhabited peak in Nanzhou.

Xiao Sheng stood there, looking into the distance.

There was no expression on his face. His eyes were closed, as if he was waiting for something.

At this moment, a faint glow appeared before Xiao Sheng.

Soon after, a pitch-black hole appeared.

A masked man in black walked out of the formation.

“I need your help.” Xiao Sheng went straight to the point.

“Oh?” the mysterious man raised his brows. “This is the first time you’ve asked for my help. ”

A trace of coldness flashed across Xiao Sheng’s face as he said coldly, “Cut the crap. Are you going to help or not?”

“Of course I can help, but I have a condition.” The mysterious man laughed.

“Say it,” Xiao Sheng said curtly.

“I have always hated your arrogance and conceit, ” the mysterious man said indifferently. “I once fantasized about what it would be like if you lowered your head before me.

“So my condition is very simple. You must beg me.”
