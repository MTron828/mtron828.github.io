Chapter 144: The Panicked Su Bo Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“That’s true.” The Deputy Chief couldn’t help but laugh.

Outside the factory, Su Bo was instantly delighted when he saw this car. He pointed at Qin Yu and said, “You’re dead meat. our Chief has arrived!”

The car quickly drove in. As soon as it stopped, Commander Guo, Yu Jin, and a square-faced man walk in. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Su Bo hurriedly walked forward, saluted, and shouted, “Hello, Chief!”

The square-faced man frowned. He glanced around and said, “What’s going on?”

Su Bo hurriedly said, “We investigated this factory with relevant departments. After inspection, we found that this factory is full of herbs not up to standards!”

The Deputy Chief, Commander Guo, and the others looked at each other with their eyes full of doubt.

Su Bo continued, “Reporting to the Deputy Chief, other than the herbs not up to standards, the boss of this factory, Qin Yu, should be punished!”

When he heard this, the Deputy Chief said in a deep voice, “Tell me the reason.”

Su Bo glanced at Qin Yu with a wicked smile, and then said coldly, “Not only did he produce health products not up to standards, but he even resisted with violence. He even claimed to be acquainted with the higher-ups of our Military District! Please give the order to punish him!”

Before the Deputy Chief said anything, Yu Jin, who was at the side, stepped forward and shouted, “Su Bo, you have to take responsibility for what you said!”

Su Bo was stunned. He looked at Yu Jin with a puzzled expression, then nodded and said, “What I said is the truth. Please investigate it, sir!”

Commander Guo frowned and said, “Su Bo, do you know who he is?”

Su Bo glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Yes, he is the son-in-law of the Su family, a man who only knows how to wash clothes and cook.”

“How dare you?! Mr. Qin is a distinguished guest of our Military District, and also the purpose of this trip!” Yu Jin immediately shouted angrily.

When he heard this, Su Bo’s expression suddenly changed!

Qin Yu was actually the person that Chief Wu invited by name? How was this possible? Didn’t Su Wen say that he was just a good-for-nothing?

Yu Jin glanced at Su Bo coldly, then quickly walked in front of Qin Yu and said apologetically, “Mr. Qin, what exactly is going on?”

“Yes, Qin Yu. Is there a misunderstanding?” Commander Guo also asked.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Commander Guo, I’m very disappointed with your Military District.”

Commander Guo frowned and said, “Qin Yu, why do you say that?”

Qin Yu looked at Su Bo coldly and said, “Su Bo claims to be an elite of your Military District, but he has no moral integrity! Just because I didn’t salute him, he joined hands with the Quality Inspection Department to frame me!”

Su Bo’s expression changed and he hurriedly said, “Sir, don’t listen to his nonsense!”

Qin Yu sneered. “I have a surveillance camera here. Do you want to take a look at it?”

When he heard this, Su Bo sneered. “Sorry, the surveillance camera is broken.”

“How do you know?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and asked indifferently.

Su Bo’s heart suddenly thumped! Oh no, it slipped out!

“I. . . I guessed it.” Su Bo braced himself and said.

Yu Jin looked at Su Bo coldly and said, “Su Bo, if we find out that you’re the one who caused trouble, I won’t let you off easily!”

Su Bo complained inside, how could he have known that Qin Yu had such powerful connections?!

But since things had come to this point, he could only brace himself and take it one step at a time.

Su Bo took a deep breath and said with some timidity, “Even if Qin Yu is an honored guest of our Military District, he should still abide by the law.”

“The products produced by this factory are all not up to standards. He should be punished accordingly.”

The Deputy Chief frowned. He glanced at Su Bo and asked in a cold voice, “Not up to standards? This factory is the focus of the commercial department. How can there be products not up to standards?”

After listening to the Deputy Chief’s words, Su Bo became more and more anxious. Cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

“Tell me quickly. What is going on?!” Yu Jin shouted angrily at the people of the Quality Inspection Department.

“I’m telling you, if you admit it now, we can give you a lighter sentence. If we find out, don’t blame me for being rude!” Yu Jin looked at the person-in-charge of the quality inspection coldly and said.

The expression of the person-in-charge of the quality inspection became extremely ugly, and he stood there uneasily.

But after thinking for a moment, he still braced himself and said, “There’s no problem with... with what Mr. Su said.”

“Okay.” The Deputy Chief nodded.

He looked at Commander Guo and said, “Immediately call the people from the second team of the Military District and have them investigate for me. If there’s no problem, all of you will be fired and investigated!”

“Yes!” Commander Guo saluted and immediately took out his phone to make a call.

At this time, the person-in-charge of the Quality Inspection Department suddenly shouted, “Don’t... Don’t call. I’ll tell you. I’ll tell you...”

Yu Jin snorted lightly and said, “Tell me, what’s going on?”

The person-in-charge pointed at Su Bo and said with a trembling voice, “He asked us to frame Qin Yu...”

“You... you’re talking nonsense!” Su Bo’s face paled, and he was sweating profusely!

At this point, the person in charge couldn’t care less about that.

He pointed at Su Bo and said, “He’s the one who asked us to do this. He even said that it would be best if we could find some, but if we can’t find any, then he’ll let us secretly put in bad herbs to frame Qin Yu...”

“You... you’re slandering me!” Su Bo’s expression was ashen. He hurriedly looked at the Deputy Chief and said, “Deputy Chief, you... Don’t listen to his nonsense. It’s all made up by him!”

The Deputy Chief looked at Su Bo coldly and said, “Are you still not going to admit it?”

Su Bo gritted his teeth and said, “Deputy Chief, this was all his own idea. I... I was just passing by!”

“Think about it. I’m a martial artist. How can I have the right to investigate herbs? This matter has nothing to do with me!” Su Bo pointed to the sky, as if he was swearing to the heavens.

The person in charge gritted his teeth and said, “I have a recording here! Mr. Qin is a famous person in Jiangcheng, so I was afraid that something would happen, and I specially recorded the conversation with Su Bo!”

“Take it out!” Yu Jin berated.

The person in charge immediately took out his phone and began to search for the recording.

Su Bo’s expression was panicked, and bean-sized sweat covered his forehead.

At this moment, Su Bo, wanting to snatch the phone, suddenly reached out his hand.

However, with a flick of Qin Yu’s finger, Su Bo’s body was sent flying!

“You want to destroy the evidence?” Qin Yu sneered.
