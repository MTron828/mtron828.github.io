2477 The Power of Sacrifice

The internal qi on their bodies surged crazily.

In the blink of an eye, every inch of their muscles ruptured, and every rupture of the muscles underwent a tremendous transformation.

After a while, those ruptured muscle fiber fragments emitted an incomparably terrifying internal qi.

A drop of blood essence dripped on the ground, and the ground shook violently and slowly sank.

The power of a drop of blood could be so immense!

“Boom!”

When every inch of these monster race living beings’ bodies completed their transformation, their bodies were reconstructed again.

Pairs after pairs of black wings slowly unfolded, giving off a suffocating pressure.

Two wings, four wings, and eight wings descended continuously along with the power of the Path of Heaven.

These monster race living beings let out mournful roars, and the muscles on their shoulders rose high.

However, as the power of the Path of Heaven weakened, the fifth pair of wings did not emerge in the end.

The eyeball behind the Heaven Gate, tremendously far away, let out a deafening roar that shook heaven and earth.

As it roared, the entire sky suddenly became a mess.

It was like the irregular, grid-like lightning storming through the sky as if manifesting the fury of the monster race’s Path of Heaven.

“The damage of this altar seemed to have caused the sacrificial energy to be insufficient, and thus these monster race living beings could only advance to the eight-winged monster race. This has led to the fury of the monster race’s Path of Heaven.” Lei Xin sent out a faint divine sense fluctuation.

“Yes, the damage of this altar has saved 40% of the human population. The sacrificial power has indeed reduced significantly. Otherwise, I don’t know how we can deal with this army. Even the power of the eight-winged has already reached the power of the Condensed Throne. Who can break the power of this army?”

Flower Granny said with a bitter smile.

It was an army of close to 5,000 Tribulation Fourth Level. Moreover, this eight-winged monster race army should have a certain extent of talent. After all, they were the offspring of human race women who had reached the True Saint cultivation realm.

If they could sense the Path of Heaven of the dark monster race, perhaps no living being in the universe could resist this army.

Moreover, they were proficient in joint attacks. Even cultivators of the Tribulation Fourth Level would have to avoid them. If they went to the battlefield, the destruction of this army would be unimaginable.

The joint attack power of the four-winged monster race army could have an additional 10% power.

The six-winged monster race had an additional 20% increase in power. The joint attack of the eight-winged monster race was probably more and not less.

If they clashed head-on, even cultivators with the power of origin would instantly turn into ashes.

“Whoosh!”

The army that was born seemed to have a strict sense of order.

They were in formation almost instantly. Following that, the leading eight-winged monster race’s sharp claw scratched.

It instantly tore open a vast void space before them, and in no time, this entire army vanished from sight.

“I wonder what harm this army will bring to the human race.”

Lei Xin sighed. If they encountered this army, it would be a miracle if they could escape, let alone stop them.

Following the disappearance of the eight-winged monster race army, the Heaven Gate that was burning with demonic flames did not disappear. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The demonic eye flickered with a strange divine light as if deep in thought.

“The power of the monster race’s Path of Heaven after the sacrifice doesn’t seem to have completely dissipated. A tremendously powerful energy seems to be fluctuating behind the Heaven Gate. Be careful, and don’t make any big movements for the time being.”

Flower Granny suddenly felt something not right. The power of the sacrifice was equally exchanged.

With nearly 600 million human lives, thousands of worshippers, and the power of the six-winged monster race army, the feedback of the power of the Path of Heaven was immensely vast. Originally, this power of the Path of Heaven should have been used for the monster race army’s advancement.

However, due to the damage to an altar, the ten-winged monster race army had failed to advance. Therefore, at this moment, the sacrifice’s feedback should have the remaining power of the monster race’s Path of Heaven.

It was a terrifying power that could directly raise a newborn monster race living being to the Tribulation Fourth Level. Even Qin Yu could not help but be tempted at this moment. If he could capture a fraction of it, it might just push him beyond the limits of his physical body, leading him into an entirely new realm.

“Don’t overthink. You will have to pay a huge price if you use the dark power. Even the soul of the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect’s descendant corroded and self-immolated using the dark power suppressed by the golden wheel of great compassion. This kind of power can’t be borrowed for use.”

Flower Granny seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s thoughts and spoke up to dispel his thoughts.

“Senior Wu Ji’s Path of Destruction is the power of the Path of Heaven that is closest to the monster race among the Path of Heaven of the human race. You should be able to sense the magnitude of that kind of power.”

Lei Xin also reminded him by the side.

Qin Yu nodded. He was naturally aware of this power.

His God-slaying Dusk was triggered after he comprehended the river of the Path of Heaven of destruction in the ghost realm and combined it with the power of the Breath of Yellow Springs.

And that was only the power of the Path of Heaven on the surface. He did not know how powerful it would be if he went deep into it.

However, the river of the Path of Heaven was too far away from the human race. After he returned to the Holy Region, he had been unable to sense its location.

Qin Yu guessed that this portion of power might end up in the hands of the Asura Godly King or the Moon Demon Godly King. Once they obtained this portion of power, they would most likely be in extreme danger.

Therefore, he had been looking for an opportunity to leave this place. However, under the watchful eyes of the monster race, they dared not leave rashly.

Suddenly, a figure appeared in midair.

He Teng? Why was he here? Was he courting death?

Qin Yu was surprised. This guy had been competing with him since he was on Earth.

But in his battle with Qin Yu, he had never gained the upper hand.

Qin Yu seemed to have become his nightmare. Once Qin Yu was in danger, and He Teng even helped him out of danger, afraid that Qin Yu would die at the hands of others.

At this moment, a colorful stone appeared in He Teng’s hand.

Under the gaze of the eye of that monster race, the stone suddenly exploded, and countless different-colored qi erupted.

An internal qi familiar to Qin Yu spread throughout the sky. In an instant, that internal qi completely entered the Heaven Gate.

“Soul Suppressing Stone! What a ruthless person. With so much power of cosmic luck, how many human race geniuses with cosmic luck have you killed?”

Wan Kong’s expression was almost distorted as he roared angrily.
