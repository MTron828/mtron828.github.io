Chapter 2582: Meeting an Acquaintance

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A meatball was rolling around in the open space. With its two eyes hanging from its long eyebrows, it looked around curiously. “Is this how the village’s Confused Consciousness came about?”

Suddenly, Qin Yu felt a chill run down his spine.

If following the order, these spiritual fires should condense into the forms of the demonic beasts he had slain.

Although this village chief seemed unreliable, he could make these newly born spiritual fires gain consciousness just by relying on such a strange dance. This fellow’s strength was definitely unfathomable.

Daoism was particular about teaching without discrimination. Moreover, it could directly transform a ball with only innate awareness into consciousness. In the original human world, no one could do this so effortlessly.

“Hmm?”

After Qin Yu pondered for a long time, he realized his body had become lighter.

With a thought, energy instantly flowed in from his fingertips.

As expected, he, by the side, had also benefited from the dao lecture just now.

Moreover, the enhancement was substantial. It was equivalent to the Saint power eating Dark Heart’s soul.

Qin Yu slapped his thigh. If he had been slightly closer to the village chief, perhaps his soul power would have been even more powerful!

“Village Chief! Village Chief! Your dance just now was so entertaining. Can you dance again?

He would become invincible if he could increase his strength just by watching the dance. He could just watch the village chief dance here.

“Village Chief, it’s me! Why are you ignoring me?”

Qin Yu called out a few more times into the village chief’s ear, but the village chief turned a deaf ear to them.

It was as if Qin Yu was invisible. Regardless of what Qin Yu said, he did not respond.

If Qin Yu blocked his way, he would take out a green hat and cover Qin Yu’s head.

Seeing the village chief walking back around and about to reach home, Qin Yu blocked the door.

The village chief stretched his neck, avoided Qin Yu, and entered the room.

“Strange, why does this person suddenly become a different person?”

Qin Yu was somewhat baffled at this moment. This village chief was like a chatterbox earlier.

But now, even though Qin Yu had just asked some simple questions, he would not pay the slightest attention.

“There’s the smell of blood!”

Qin Yu instantly became vigilant and returned to the vacant space.

At this moment, three of the newly born Confused Consciousness had fallen into a pool of blood.

Moreover, the smell of blood was spreading from all over the village.

That was fast, killing so many villagers in such a short time.

Decisive and ruthless, this person was not easy to deal with.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Killing so many villagers, the power gathered was definitely substantial.

At this moment, his Seal of Heaven Returning had yet to recover. If something went wrong again, he would be doomed.

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s face revealed a shocked expression.

Thirty meters away, twenty leopards with thick legs appeared.

Lightning Leopard!

Qin Yu was greatly shocked. In the human world, he had seen demon leopards with such appearance. It was called the Lightning Leopard and had incredible speed.

He might not be afraid if it was just one, but 20 of them appearing together was a threat to him.

This Confused Consciousness did not have a clear consciousness but the instinct of a ferocious beast.

The moment they saw Qin Yu, they immediately pounced toward him.

Qin Yu mustered all the strength in his feet and ran back crazily.

In less than two to three seconds, he could smell the panting of these Lightning Leopards.

“Rip!”

Qin Yu tilted his head slightly and pierced through the head of a Lightning Leopard with a backstab.

When the tip of the spear pierced through the flesh, a harsh and ear-piercing tearing sound could be heard as if muscles and tissues were being torn apart.

The massive force sent Dark Heart’s bone spike in his hand flying, and Qin Yu decisively abandoned his spear and took out his dagger.

As he had guessed, these leopards were incredibly fast, but their bodies were not notably sturdy.

Using the long bone spike to face the remaining nineteen leopards was undoubtedly restricting himself.

Qin Yu stretched out his dagger horizontally nearly non-stop.

He cut the head of the charging Lightning Leopard into halves and kicked the leopard away.

He then stabbed the dagger into the chest of a leopard and cut half of its body open.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye.

In a short while, he found himself surrounded by the remaining 17 leopards, which almost simultaneously launched an attack.

Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze!

Seeing himself surrounded, Qin Yu activated the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

With all his might, he slit open the throats of the three leopards before him and ran away.

“Rip!”

Several wounds instantly appeared on his back and thighs.

A large mouthful of flesh was torn off his thigh. The Lightning Leopard, which

smelled the bloody flesh, pounced at mm even more crazily.

“Smash!”

Qin Yu’s body crashed onto a small mountain, and the massive shock caused blood to flow out of his forehead.

In less than a few seconds, a few more pieces of flesh were torn out of his back.

It was a position he had noticed when he first entered the village. With his back against it would reduce the attack range of the Lightning Leopard by half, and the pressure on him significantly reduced.

“Close!”

The Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze on his forehead closed abruptly, facing half of the leopards.

The pressure on Qin Yu instantly reduced significantly. After nearly 20 minutes, Qin Yu pierced the dagger through the head of the last Lightning Leopard.

Stinky blood permeated the ground. It was hard to distinguish whether it was the blood from Qin Yu’s body or that of the leopards.

At this moment, his body was covered in wounds. The killing of these 20 leopards caused him considerable injuries.

He could feel his arm holding the dagger tremble uncontrollably.

“How terrifying! His strength has grown to such a level in less than three days.”

A figure appeared in the forest in the distance, slowly walking out with his hands clapping.

“Ji Tianming, I didn’t expect you, the Supreme Elder of the Ji family, to come to this Saint Kingdom. If I remember correctly, you seemed to have mixed in with the monster race in the last battle and killed many people from the Human Race Watch.”

Qin Yu slowly walked toward him, leaving behind a series of footprints.

In the last battle, many people of the Human Race Watch suddenly lost their strength for no reason. He only realized that the Ji family had joined the monster race after noticing the people of the Ji family. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Moreover, they had set their eyes on the many people of the Human Race Watch who were undergoing training in purgatory. Ji Tianming and the people of the Ji family had secretly poisoned them.

These poison insects were called Glazed Illusion Butterfly. They did not erupt in the short term. Instead, they released a special poison that could seep into the cultivators’ bodies and secretly corrode their strength and energy sources.

At the most critical moment of the battle, Ji Tianming detonated the Glazed Illusion Butterfly, causing everyone, including the peak master, to suffer heavy casualties.

“That’s right. You destroyed my Ji family, and I will never forgive you. Fortunately, Revered Qi has allowed me to come to the Saint Kingdom to kill you.”

Ji Tianming laughed frantically..
