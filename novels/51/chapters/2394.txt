2395 The Final Will

Qin Yu’s body suddenly appeared on the spot. He was sitting cross-legged on the ground at this moment.

Yan Ruoxue was immersed in Immortal Emperor Lei’s inheritance contents. Her body slightly trembled as if she could not believe what she saw.

“Ruoxue, continue cultivating with Flower Granny. I’ll bring Qin Yu to the peak for retreat.”

Lei Xin was overjoyed. He picked up Qin Yu and flew toward the mountain he was on.

He did not know why Qin Yu had come back to life in the end. Another force seemed to have pulled him back.

Lei Xin took a breath. Fortunately, Qin Yu survived. Otherwise, he might have to live in self-blame for the rest of his life.

No one had expected Immortal Emperor Lei’s final trial to be so terrifying. Even he could not pass it. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Yu was completely immersed in the vast memories left behind by Immortal Emperor Lei. He comprehended the way of thunder from the early years to maturity.

The five moves that Immortal Emperor Lei displayed previously were the first five levels of changes in the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

The first level was the Way of Heaven and Earth. It allowed one to activate the power of the way in one’s body and leave a mark in the sea of the Path of Heaven. One could enter the sea of the Path of Heaven at any time to activate the way.

The second level was the Soul Statue. The soul statue was condensed in the sea of the Path of Heaven, and the massive statue sank into the sea of the Path of Heaven to comprehend a more refined way.

The third level was the Soul Statue Reaching the Bottom. The soul statue sank to the bottom of the sea of the Path of Heaven with the formidable power of control and touched the most profound way. With a thought, one could communicate with the soul to activate the most profound power of the way between heaven and earth.

The fourth level was the Condensed Throne. It fused the soul statue with the sea of the Path of Heaven, allowing one to pry into the deepest mysteries of the sea of the Path of Heaven at any time.

The fifth level was splitting the heavens using strength, prying into the origin, opening a passageway, prying into the primordial rune, and evolving the power of the Great Success Path of Heaven.

These contents swiftly flashed through Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. Coupled with the fact that he had just seen the evolution of Immortal Emperor Lei face to face, he had a clearer understanding of the entire Tribulation Transcending Stage.

It did not seem that difficult to understand, but it required a long period of accumulation for each step.

If not for his desolate divine eye, he would probably not know when he could enter the sea of the Path of Heaven.

“Use the power of rules and activate it with spells to reach its strongest power.

“The Nine Thunder God’s Thunder Technique is the strongest I have ever created. One can activate it with the power of rules and shatter all enemies one faces. Even Immortal Emperors dare not take the attack!”

That consciousness evolved again. Qin Yu’s soul had already been shattered by the primordial rune of thunder, so he did not notice this attack.

Only now did he realize the terror of this attack. It could slash the entire Thunder Courtyard and the space within tens of thousands of meters into nothingness.

After a round of evolution, the consciousness became tremendously weak as if it would turn into ashes at any moment.

“Immortal Emperor Lei, I’d like to ask you. Why haven’t any Immortal Emperors appeared in the past few Path of Heaven years?”

Qin Yu quickly asked. Perhaps only the Immortal Emperor could answer this question.

Immortal Emperor Lei’s consciousness was silent for a long time before he spoke softly.

“Immortal Emperors have already jumped out of the Path of Heaven and formed their own system. As time passes, cosmic luck rises and falls. Ultimately, the human race will decline. Once, six Immortal Emperors of the human race had joined forces to attack the heavens to prolong the cosmic lunch of the human race for several Path of Heaven years. However, half of the Immortal Emperors had died, and the other half declined in their cultivation realms due to heavy injuries and returned to the Path of Heaven.

“After that, the sea of the Path of Heaven changed. I can’t say for sure about the change. Anyway, after that battle, no one could break through again. I’ve studied the reason for a long time but still don’t understand. However, after the six of us attacked the Path of Heaven, the heavens must have changed.”

Immortal Emperor Lei slowly revealed a secret that no one knew. Qin Yu’s heart was filled with turbulent emotions.

Immortal Emperor Lei’s consciousness exploded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. In an instant, Qin Yu felt that every part of his body was meticulously scanned.

In front of the Immortal Emperor’s consciousness, he seemed to be unable to keep any secrets.

“You didn’t choose to leave a mark in the Sea of Soul. This path wouldn’t work for an ordinary cultivator. After all, activating the spell would consume a vast amount of spiritual energy. However, with your Glazed Holy Body’s capacity for spiritual energy coupled with the thunder element tempering your body, this path seems to work for you. However, how could one reach the bottom of the river of the Path of Heaven and pry into its origin? It’s also a dead end…”

Qin Yu’s heart started to beat violently when he heard Immortal Emperor Lei’s words.

Soon his thoughts were interrupted by Immortal Emperor Lei.

“My time is almost up. The trend of the Path of Heaven is irresistible. Even if the Immortal Emperors jumped out of the Path of Heaven and formed their own system, they still couldn’t resist it. However, we managed to shatter the death qi that swept toward the human race and obtained a trace of cosmic luck, hoping for someone among the younger generations of the human race to resist the Path of Heaven. Therefore, my inheritance has very high requirements, and you, obtaining my final trace of will, is considered fulfilling my wish.”

Immortal Emperor Lei sighed, and he was filled with tremendous exhaustion.

“That Heart of Thunder was condensed from the origin of my soul. After my cultivation realm declined, I no longer had the chance to rush out of the Path of Heaven. This Heart of Thunder will slowly fuse into your soul. In the future, it will be tremendously easy for you to comprehend the rules of thunder. This is also the last thing I can do for the human race…”

After Immortal Emperor Lei finished speaking, his body slowly disappeared.

Qin Yu did not come back to his senses for a long time. The information that Immortal Emperor Lei gave him was too overwhelming. He could not accept it for a while.

He recalled what he had just said and suddenly felt his heart skip a beat.

The first level of the Tribulation Transcending Stage, the Way of Heaven and Earth, required one to leave one’s soul in the sea of the Path of Heaven. This way, the power of rules could be used with a thought, unlike the True Saint Realm where one had to use a large amount of spiritual energy to activate the power of rules.

Immortal Emperor Lei had mentioned something very important just now. He felt that there was a problem with the Path of Heaven and thus there was no Immortal Emperor in these few years of Path of Heaven.

At that time, he had just entered the sea of spatial rules and was about to leave a soul mark and a sense of danger appeared.

That seemed to be a reminder his father had left for him. That was why he had given up on leaving the mark.

Moreover, although the desolate divine eye was obtained on Earth, it had been nurtured by the chaotic qi until now. Even the power of the second level was only reached by the eruption of his soul power.

And the desolate divine eye had helped him skip the Soul Statue, the Soul Statue Reaching the Bottom, and the Condensed Throne.

At that time, he had relied on his second level of desolate divine eye to pry into the primordial rune directly. If his soul power could grow again, wouldn’t he be able to further pry into the primordial rune?

Qin Yu felt that everything was too coincidental. It was as if someone had set it up.

However, these were too far away from the current Qin Yu. He thought for a long time but still could not think of anything.

Based on the Heart of Thunder, he was immersed in comprehending the rules of thunder.

Moreover, he was delighted to discover that the rules of thunder could allow him to refine the Glazed Holy Body further.
