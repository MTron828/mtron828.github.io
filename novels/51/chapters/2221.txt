2222 Demon King Black Tortoise

Qin Yu frowned and did not continue to attack.

There was no time to waste now. With so many cultivators fighting over this demonic ginseng, they might not even be able to get a glimpse of it if they went late.

With the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch, he landed on a lotus leaf.

He tore apart the restriction outside and stepped inside.

“Big Brother, I didn’t offend you just now.”

The male cultivator, with a sneaky appearance and shifty eyes, who controlled the lotus artifact exclaimed in fear.

He was also one of the spectators just now. Qin Yu could take an arrow from Xing Mou. Such strength was not something he could resist at all.

“Cut the crap. Take me to the sixth level of purgatory.”

Qin Yu shouted coldly. It was a place where the strong preyed on the weak. He would probably be lying somewhere now if he were weaker. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yes, yes. As long as you don’t kill me.”

The wretched cultivator wiped away the cold sweat from his temples.

Although the wretched cultivator was only at the Peak of Reversion Void Stage, his lotus leaf treasure was tremendously fast.

If Qin Yu did not use the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch, he would probably have difficulty catching up to his speed.

“Sir, may I release you at the fifth level? With my current strength, I only dare to observe from the corners to look for opportunities. I dare not venture into the sixth level.”

The wretched cultivator had a bitter expression.

“Cut the crap.”

Qin Yu frowned. He locked on this cultivator using his divine sense. He did not believe in his nonsense.

If he did not have some ability, he definitely would not go to the sixth level of purgatory.

“Roar!”

A giant lizard suddenly jumped out from the ground, and a stream of brownish-green saliva suddenly spat on Qin Yu’s ship.

Qin Yu waved his hand, and a massive palm wind slapped the highly poisonous saliva away.

After that, he kicked the lizard’s neck and instantly split it.

Suddenly, several white wolves attacked them fiercely.

Qin Yu wielded his saber, and the four wolf heads were cut off in the air.

“Strange, could it be that these Demonic Beasts have also sensed that the demonic ginseng is about to be born? They seem to be especially violent today.”

The wretched cultivator’s expression was somewhat solemn.

Along the way, many cultivators had already died at the hands of the Demonic Beasts.

The roars of the Demonic Beasts were one after another. What was strange was that these Demon Beasts only attacked humans and not attack other species.

“It seems that someone is commanding these Demonic Beasts.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“That’s normal. There are many demon kings in the depths of purgatory. These demon kings commanded all the Demonic Beasts in purgatory. It’s even rumored that there are demon kings at the back of Solitary Cloud City.”

The wretched cultivator said.

When they arrived at the sixth level of purgatory, vigorous spiritual energy had already filled the vast space, permeating the heavens and earth.

A giant light egg shone intermittently in the depths, fluctuating between brightness and dimness.

Qin Yu scanned the egg with his divine sense. The light egg was like transparent glass, and a baby curled into a ball was inside.

It had a pinkish expression, and its face was round, just like a human baby.

At this moment, many people were standing around him.

Almost all in front possessed top-notch strength.

As for those who were further behind, the strength was weaker, and they hoped to get a share of the spoils.

Those at the most outer layer hoped to be lucky enough to pick up some remnants. After all, the fight for the ten-thousand-year-old ginseng would be tremendously intense. It was supreme luck if they could only get some remnants.

Some people found a place where they could cultivate, greedily absorbing the spiritual energy emitted by the ginseng.

Numerous shape-shifting Demonic Beasts also mixed among them.

The scene was surprisingly quiet. Everyone secretly took out the treasures and circulated their spiritual energy to the extreme.

They were waiting for the moment the ginseng turned into a demon.

All of a sudden, those Demonic Beasts became restless.

As if hearing some command, they charged at the humans madly.

In an instant, the scene was in chaos.

Many human cultivators were caught off guard and killed on the spot.

However, the human cultivators soon reacted and gathered together to block the Demonic Beasts’ attacks.

“Kill the Demonic Beast first. The ginseng must not be snatched by the demon race.”

Various treasures in the sixth level of purgatory emitted shimmering rays of light.

Demonic Beasts were stronger than human cultivators in terms of physical strength, but humans had many treasures complementing each other.

Soon, the number of Demonic Beast decreased tremendously.

Qin Yu was initially facing the attacks of two Demonic Beasts.

An arrow-like divine sense directly bombarded his sea of divine sense. The two Demonic Beasts’ terrifying bodies hit him directly, causing his qi and blood to surge.

“Brat, instead of staying in Solitary Cloud City, you dare to come here to seek fortune.”

A voice suddenly sounded not far away from Qin Yu.

Zong Yue’s face revealed a devilish smile. The more he laughed, the more exaggerated it became.

“You made me lose two subordinates. It’s time to settle the score now.”

“Good, you came at the right time. You ambushed me for no reason in Solitary Cloud City, and now you’re here to ambush me again. I’ll settle this score with you now.”

Qin Yu’s eyes turned cold instantly, and the killing intent on his face could not be concealed at all.

“Star Seal!”

He formed a seal with his hands, and a giant star fell from the sky like a meteorite.

The two cultivators beside Zong Yue were smashed into meat paste.

“What? How could a second-grade True Saint have such a powerful cultivation technique?”

Zong Yue’s face filled with shock. If that seal had hit him, he did not have the confidence to dodge it.

“Young Lord, don’t be afraid. Regardless of his cultivation method, it won’t change his second-grade True Saint cultivation realm. Moreover, such a powerful cultivation technique will probably consume a large amount of spiritual energy, and he can’t unleash it again.”

The elderly man frowned and said. His divine sense attacked again.

“Are you not done yet?”

Qin Yu’s golden figurine tore through the air and clashed with the elderly man’s divine sense directly.

The elderly man suddenly took several steps back, with blood and brain matter oozing uncontrollably from his seven orifices.

This clash caused him to be severely injured.

Suddenly, a sword light slashed down and landed between Qin Yu and Zong Yue.

The white-clad evil exterminator stared at them coldly. “Kill the Demonic Beast first, or die!”

“Brat, this isn’t over yet. I’ll let you taste the cruel punishments of my Blood Sect.”

Zong Yue shouted fiercely. He glanced at the evil exterminator with some fear before leaving with his subordinates.

“It’s you again.”

The evil exterminator recognized Qin Yu. He frowned and put down the sword he had raised.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. Although he was not afraid of the evil exterminator now, it was very troublesome to be targeted by this person.

At this moment, a demon king attracted everyone’s attention.

This demon king was hundreds of meters long and had a giant shield on his back. Every step he took seemed to carry a thousand catties of strength.

Every step he took caused the ground to shake. The attacks on it from the treasures only caused sparks to fly upon impact.

“Hahaha, are you tickling me?”

He laughed wildly and grabbed three or four cultivators with one hand. He bit off half of their bodies and chewed them in his mouth.
