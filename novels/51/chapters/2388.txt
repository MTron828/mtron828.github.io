2389 Taking in Disciple

He had his own story, too, but his position had made him give up a lot. It was something he had no choice but to do.

“Flower Granny, what are you doing?”

Si Liuhe’s expression was a bit unfriendly.

The matter had come to an end, but the atmosphere became solemn again with the appearance of Flower Granny.

“In the next hundred years, the immortal grave of Thunder Courtyard will be open to the Si and Yan families. I know that Holy Lord Yan and the Si family have an agreement to nurture Si Shiyue. Yan Ruoxue will take out five drops of blood essence sufficient for Si Shiyue’s use.”

Flower Granny stated her conditions.

Yan Tianshi and Si Liuhe looked at each other and noticed the disbelief in each other’s eyes.

For the sake of Saintess Yan, Thunder Courtyard was willing to pay such a price.

The immortal grave was the most confidential place of the Thunder Courtyard. If the higher-ups of the Yan family entered the immortal grave, they would have a sufficient understanding of the cultivation techniques left behind by Immortal Emperor Lei. The competitiveness of Thunder Courtyard would reduce significantly by then.

Just like the collaboration between the Si family and the Yan family, with the Si family providing their immortal scripture, it signified that the core interests of both families were intertwined. Moreover, after a brief study, Yan Tianshi was tremendously inspired.

“Not enough.”

Yan Tianshi shook his head.

“In addition, Qin Yu’s quasi-celestial artifact, Suo Lin. Qin Yu, give it to him.”

Flower Granny said loudly to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment before he reacted. He erased his mark on Suo Lin and threw it at Yan Tianshi without hesitation.

“It’s indeed a quasi-celestial artifact. The fire unicorn has even absorbed a trace of the Vermillion Bird’s flames. It’s truly a terrifying magical artifact.”

Si Liuhe checked Suo Lin with his divine sense and nodded slightly.

Yan Tianshi wanted to say something, but Flower Granny’s body emitted a powerful fluctuation, and a powerful internal qi instantly enveloped the two.

“I once missed an opportunity, and now I don’t want anyone to have the same regret as me. I believe Thunder Courtyard has already shown enough sincerity and given enough respect to the two families. If Holy Lord Yan still disagrees, don’t blame me for not being a good host.”

“Heh, you’re threatening us in front of me and the Yan family head? No one in this world seemed to be qualified to do so.”

“If you two don’t show respect, I’ll just kill you two.”

Si Liuhe and Yan Tianshi’s expressions changed drastically soon after the power was released. Yan Tianshi had experienced it very well. He was forced to use his celestial artifact just by a trace of the power of time.

If such a massive power of time hit them, he was not confident he could withstand it.

“Thunder Courtyard is really domineering. I’ll remember it.”

Yan Tianshi waved his hand, and Yan Ruoxue was released from Divine Destiny Pagoda. After that, the two disappeared.

“Qin Yu, are you alright?”

Yan Ruoxue grabbed onto Qin Yu. Seeing him covered in blood, she could roughly guess what had happened. She injected her dense spiritual energy into Qin Yu’s body and healed his injuries.

“I’m fine.”

Qin Yu pulled Yan Ruoxue to Flower Granny and Lei Xin.

He knelt in front of the two and kowtowed nine times solemnly. Yan Ruoxue also knelt.

He knew the price the two had to pay this time.

“Thank you, Dean and Flower Granny. Your kindness is like my reborn parents. I, Qin Yu, can never repay it.”

He said with a choked voice.

“Hehe, you little brat, the price we paid for the two of you this time is not small. These things all have interest.”

“From now on, my life belongs to the dean and Flower Granny.”

Qin Yu wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes. It was only in front of them that he would cry so unscrupulously. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lei Xin stroked his beard and released Jue Wu.

Just now, he was afraid that this little girl would go crazy and dared not let her out. Now that the matter was resolved, he could finally let her out.

“Stinky old man, I’m so touched! You and Flower Granny Hua are so awesome today. I’ll mourn for you when you die in the future. I promise you!”

Jue Wu’s eyes were red. She jumped on Lei Xin’s back and wiped her snot. She had thought that Yan Ruoxue would be taken away.

She did not expect things to take a surprising turn in the end, leaving her in tears.

Suddenly, she bit hard on Lei Xin’s neck. The pain almost made him faint.

“You crazy child, it hurts so much.”

Lei Xin almost fainted from the pain. He swung wildly but could not shake off Jue Wu.

Flower Granny pulled Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue up, looking up at the distant sky.

Behind her, Lei Xin shook his head subtly. Back then, Flower Granny had also hoped that a few people could stand up for her, but unfortunately, there were none.

They only left late at night.

When Qin Yu and the others left, the wrinkles on Flower Granny’s face sank like ravines. Even the black hair on her head instantly lost its color. She seemed to have aged by hundreds of years in an instant.

“Flower Granny! You!”

Lei Xin’s expression changed drastically.

“How can the power of time be so easy to control? When I activate it, it will inevitably backfire on me. However, I can help Qin Yu and Ruoxue today, so it can be considered as making up for my regret back then.”

Flower Granny waved her hand, not taking it to heart at all.

How could the most formidable person from the Yan family under Immortal Emperor Tianming be defeated so easily?

At noon the next day, Lei Xin and Flower Granny arrived at the courtyard where Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue rested.

“Cough, cough, cough, cough, cough, cough!”

The two only woke up when Lei Xin coughed until he hurt his throat.

“Dean Lei! Flower Granny!”

Yan Ruoxue blushed and bowed deeply to Lei Xin and Flower Granny.

“Qin Yu is still not awake?”

Lei Xin looked into the distance and pretended to ask casually.

“I’ll wake him up.”

Yan Ruoxue quickly ran away.

Actually, nothing happened last night. They only hugged each other and fell asleep.

Perhaps it was because they had been too stressed and did not expect to sleep so soundly that they did not wake up for a long time when Lei Xin came to the front door.

“Ruoxue, I’m asking you if you’re willing to become my direct disciple.”

Flower Granny stared at Yan Ruoxue and asked in a low voice.

“Although the Yan family’s immortal scripture and Thunder Courtyard’s theories are very different, the path of cultivation is the same. After tribulation, you basically have to rely on your own comprehension and have your own path. What I can give you are suggestions and guidance.”
