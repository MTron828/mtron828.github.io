2259 Fighting for the Body

At this moment, all the people in the Sumeru ring were cultivating.

For one month, everyone was immersed in the cultivation of the rapid advancement of their strength.

The internal qi on Qin Yu’s body surged like tidal waves, and the chaotic power emanating from its surface grew stronger with each wave.

Finally, that internal qi soared to its peak. Under his control, it returned to calmness within his body.

He suddenly opened his eyes. “Finally, I’ve reached fourth-grade True Saint!”

At this moment, the temperature of the Fire Unicorn Continent seemed to have dropped quite a lot under his frantic absorption. Subsequently, the speed at which he absorbed the fire energy in the air began to slow down.

He entered the Sumeru ring.

“Oh my, your this divine artifact is a bit pervert! The speed at which it absorbs spiritual energy is simply terrifying!”

The man with the mustache exclaimed.

“If the inner core of the ancient divine beast fire unicorn doesn’t even have this little effect, then it’s a waste of its title as the most ferocious beast,” Elder Guai said with a smile. He also absorbed a large amount of spiritual energy during this cultivation and restored some of his strength.

“Qin Yu, when are we going back to Solitary Cloud City? I’m hungry!”

Jue Wu’s legs had already regrown. Everyone had been cultivating for the past month, so she was extremely bored.

“Have you fully recovered?”

Qin Yu looked at the lively Jue Wu and found it somewhat unbelievable. She suffered a severe injury before entering the Sumeru ring, and he did not expect her to fully recover within a month.

“Of course, I’m going to catch a six-tailed fox and eat it!”Jue Wu waved her little fist.

“Qin Yu, take a look at Wang Feng. His condition seems to be a little bad.”

Elder Guai said with a frown.

Qin Yu quickly ran to Wang Feng’s side. Most of his body injuries had already recovered, but his condition was extremely bad at this moment. The spiritual energy in his body could not be controlled at all.

“Oh no, his divine sense is on the verge of collapse!”

Qin Yu extended his divine sense into Wang Feng’s mind and discovered his extremely damaged divine sense figurine.

At this moment, the power of Wang Feng’s soul was constantly dissipating. Qin Yu activated the Soul Torment Mind Technique to guide Wang Feng’s divine sense to circulate according to the route of the Soul Torment Mind Technique and repair his soul slowly.

While Qin Yu was retracting the Soul Torment Mind Technique, the black Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

A surge of ghostly aura suddenly emanated from Qin Yu’s body, and an internal qi chilling everyone’s soul enveloped everyone in the Sumeru ring.

“It’s again another Qin Yu!”

The man with the mustache’s expression changed drastically.

“What a powerful internal qi! It’s much stronger than last time!” Elder Guai’s expression was tremendously ugly.

Little Fatty and Xiaoru were also so scared that they hid behind Old Huai, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.

Only Jue Wu had a curious look on her face. She went over and poked Qin Yu’s face.

“Are you crazy? Come back quickly!”

The man with the mustache was so angry.

The golden Qin Yu opened his eyes and stared coldly at the black Qin Yu.

“Since you’ve employed the netherworld cultivation method, you must bear the interrelated consequences.”

The power of the black Qin Yu’s divine sense surged like the sea, crashing against the golden divine sense that was like a lonely boat.

Qin Yu, in the sea of consciousness, stood up. “You’re just a consciousness that’s an extension of a cultivation method, and here is my body.”

The black tide charged at Qin Yu madly, but he remained unmoving like a giant mountain.

Previously, he was afraid of this consciousness and had been subconsciously suppressing it, not daring to use the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

That fear had caused this divine sense to become increasingly more powerful. In the Fire Unicorn Continent, he almost fell into the abyss of the sea of consciousness, and his father broke the rules to save him.

His soul right now was as sharp as a sword, unwavering and determined, cutting through all obstacles.

“Surrender or die.”

The golden Qin Yu slashed out his sword, and the golden light of his divine sense cut through the black tide.

“I am you, and you actually want to kill me, hahaha!”

Floating in the air above the Sea of Soul, Qin Yu slashed down the sword.

The aura on his body stagnated, and the ghostly aura seemed to be suppressed.

“What happened? Qin Yu’s internal qi seemed to have weakened a lot,” the man with the mustache said after feeling it carefully.

Elder Guai frowned and said.

“In a battle of divine sense, the slightest problem will cause one’s body to die and Dao to dissipate! However, Qin Yu’s divine sense seemed to have become much stronger. When the Qin Yu from the netherworld appeared previously, he couldn’t resist at all.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The man with the mustache took a deep breath.

Another golden sword strike.

At this moment, the golden and black Qin Yu’s internal qi were damaged almost simultaneously. Their internal qi weakened to the extreme.

“Haha, how is it? Do you still want to try?”

“Surrender or die?”

The golden Qin Yu looked at his other self with an indifferent gaze.

A giant sword gradually took shape above his head. He focused all his divine sense on it.

“Are you trying to scare me? Come on! None of us will survive this slash. Let me remind you.”

The black Qin Yu revealed a mocking expression.

Qin Yu stared at him with an indifferent expression. In the next moment, he slashed the sword out fiercely.

“Are you crazy? Are we really going to perish together?”

When the sword landed on the divine sense, the black Qin Yu revealed a shocked expression, but it was already too late.

The golden light instantly drowned the black tide. Under this slash, the black Qin Yu was directly cut into pieces.

Qin Yu’s golden divine sense also shattered into pieces. His body crashed to the ground, and his internal qi suddenly disappeared.

“Qin Yu!”

Jue Wu screamed with a pale face.

The man with the mustache and Elder Guai also came over. Their expressions were tremendously ugly.

“What’s going on? Why is there no internal qi at all?”

Jue Wu clenched her fists tightly.

“Don’t worry, Jue Wu. Look at the Sumeru ring. It hasn’t shown any signs of movement yet. It means Qin Yu isn’t dead yet!”

Elder Guai said anxiously.

A few of them stared at Qin Yu intently, not daring to relax their eyes for a moment.

“Ding!”

Qin Yu’s boxing gloves suddenly made a sound, and an orange breeze blew.

It suddenly entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, and Qin Yu’s lifeless body finally had a trace of internal qi.

His Soul Torment Mind Technique suddenly activated, and the power of his divine sense slowly recovered.

Qin Yu captured numerous divine senses into his sea of consciousness, including the eighth-grade Ming Yue and the souls of the cultivators he had just killed.

His soul recovered at a terrifying speed. After ten days, 60% of his divine sense recovered.

At this moment, Qin Yu was still black and golden in the sea of consciousness.
