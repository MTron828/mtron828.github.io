2052 The Secret Hidden in the Heart

Xiao Hai grabbed the wine from the jar beside him, took a big gulp, and looked at Qin Yu.

“The nine great aristocratic families had attacked the Chaos Grave. It was just a few days ago. The news released today is fake,” Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu was shocked and hurriedly asked, “And then?”

“They failed.” Xiao Hai shook his head. “The Chaos Grave is even more terrifying than we imagine. The nine great aristocratic families each brought hundreds of people to attack the Chaos Grave, but they didn’t get anything and suffered heavy losses.”

“Rumor has it that… at least 800 people from the nine great aristocratic families have died, including three veteran True Saints and two Tribulation magical artifacts.”

Qin Yu was instantly shocked beyond words after hearing Xiao Hai’s words.

Wasn’t losing three veteran True Saints and two Tribulation magical artifacts too terrifying?

“Wu Ji’s Big Grave is more horrifying than what we imagine. Now, the nine great aristocratic families have completely given up and are planning to take it slow,” Xiao Hai said.

“Therefore… the Chaos Grave is no longer sealed. Anyone can enter as they wish, but at least 20,000 people have died since yesterday.”

Qin Yu understood now.

No wonder so many people wanted to obtain his blood essence today! They knew the nine great aristocratic families would no longer participate, and thus they wanted to try their luck!

“I must go and take a look.” Qin Yu hurriedly got up and rushed toward the Chaos Grave.

Without hesitation, Xiao Hai and Jue Wu followed closely behind.

When they arrived at the Chaos Grave, as expected, the enormous death qi of the Chaos Grave was even more terrifying. It no longer suppressed the spiritual power in the body but stripped away lifespan continuously.

People continued to enter the Chaos Grave, but almost all died inside.

Even if they were lucky enough to escape, they probably would be reduced to living dead.

Countless tomb slaves appeared in the huge Chaos Grave. They were without lifespan and divine sense, like withered zombies.

Seeing the scene, Qin Yu was shocked on the spot.

“It seems everyone has underestimated Wu Ji’s anger,” Xiao Hai whispered.

Qin Yu was silent. He had mixed feelings and did not know whether to be happy or worried.

“Are you still planning to go in?” Jue Wu asked softly.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, shook his head, and said, “Even a True Saint died in there, not to mention me. Even if I’m stupid, I can’t die in vain.”

“You might think so, but it doesn’t mean that others will think the same,” Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

No matter how many people died, they would never give up obtaining the hidden treasure, the immortal scripture.

In that case, the number of people who wanted to obtain Qin Yu’s chaotic blood would naturally increase.

“Hmm?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly sensed something.

He looked into the depths of the Chaos Grave and found a vast expanse of white.

“This internal qi… seems familiar,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Wasn’t this chaotic qi? To obtain the Life Aura, Qin Yu had seen for himself such internal qi back then. He had also seen that mysterious green creature in that chaotic qi. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Now, this internal qi had appeared in the Chaos Grave.

“Could it be… that the people of the nine great aristocratic families died at the hands of that mysterious green creature?” Qin Yu was shocked in his heart.

“Alright, let’s leave this place quickly. The Si family had the time to deal with you now,” Xiao Hai said.

Qin Yu nodded. It was not good to stay here for long, so they quickly left.

In the following days, countless people still entered the Chaos Grave, but almost all died there.

This situation lasted for more than a month before it gradually stopped, and the number of people heading to the Chaos Grave gradually decreased.

Qin Yu, Xiao Hai, and the others stayed in the magical artifact for more than a month.

Seeing the Si family not making a move, Qin Yu slowly let down his guard.

“It’s about time now. It’s time to go round.” On this day, Qin Yu stood up and looked at Jue Wu and Xiao Hai, intending to bid farewell.

“I’ll go with you. We can take care of each other if you run into the Si family.” Xiao Hai stood up. His broad arms gave people a sense of security.

Jue Wu also hurriedly jumped onto Qin Yu’s shoulder, nodded like a chick pecking at rice, and said, “That’s right. With the two of us around, no one can touch you.”

But Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I’m planning to go out and train. The Si family hasn’t made any moves yet. I don’t think they’ll spend their energy on me for the time being.”

“I’ll go with you!” Jue Wu hurriedly said.

Qin Yu glanced at Jue Wu and said smiling, “Jue Wu, you should know only by traveling alone that one can comprehend the dao. Moreover, life is full of danger. Let’s part ways for now.”

Jue Wu’s nose wrinkled slightly. She wanted to say something but couldn’t find the right words to respond.

“Brother Xiao Hai, please send Jue Wu back to Thunder Courtyard,” Qin Yu bowed to Xiao Hai and said.

Xiao Hai was a person who was absolutely trustworthy and reliable. With him accompanying Jue Wu, Qin Yu could rest assured.

“Are you really going to train?” Xiao Hai frowned and said.

“Yeah, time is of the essence. I can’t afford to delay it,” Qin Yu stretched lazily and said.

Seeing that Qin Yu had already made up his mind, Xiao Hai no longer persuaded him.

“I’ll take good care of Jue Wu. You take care of yourself,” he nodded and said.

“Thank you very much.” Qin Yu bowed to Xiao Hai again before he turned around and left.

He had only taken two steps when Jue Wu’s voice sounded behind him.

She rushed over to Qin Yu’s side and took out her Saint Weapon, handing it to Qin Yu.

“Take this with you, and I can feel more at ease,” Jue Wu said.

“This is something that belongs to ThunderCourtyard. I’m afraid Dean Lei will get angry if you give it to me,” Qin Yu smiled and said.

“No, he won’t. I’ll tell him that I’ve lost it!” Jue Wu patted her chest and said.

Qin Yu said, shaking his head, “I have a Saint Weapon with me now. It’s no use to have more of it. Don’t worry. I’ll be fine. You’ll hear good news on the day of the Path of Heaven.”

After saying that, Qin Yu did not stay any longer and left without looking back.

Looking at Qin Yu’s back, which was departing, Jue Wu did not speak for a long time.

Xiao Hai placed his hand on Jue Wu’s shoulder and said, “Qin Yu is a smart person. Nothing will happen to him.”

…

Qin Yu left the Mystic Realm. He concealed his internal qi and walked on the streets.

Qin Yu always had a thought in his heart, but he never shared this thought with anyone.

That was the Chaos Grave.

Most people had nearly given up on the Chaos Grave, and Qin Yu looked the same on the surface.

But in reality, his thought had never left the Chaos Grave.

“Even the Tribulation magical artifacts were destroyed. It means the method they used to enter the Chaos Grave was wrong.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.
