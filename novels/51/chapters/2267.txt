2268 An Attack of an Era

When the phantom saw Qin Yu heading toward the seventh level, the sword intent accumulated in its hand slowly dissipated.

Seeing Qin Yu finally move, the middle-aged man snorted coldly and continued rushing to the next place.

In the void of the galaxy, Qin Yu was on the ship in the void, and a densely packed of cultivators were shuttling toward the seventh level of purgatory. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In the void, many cultivators holding the Divine Command of Execution were rushing toward various continents, representing the Evil Extermination Sect ordering the cultivators to hurry to the seventh level of purgatory.

He sensed carefully and realized the majority were of the True Saint Realm with powerful strength.

Furthermore, the strength of some was unfathomable even to him, and he could not sense their exact strength.

“What’s going on, and why does the opening of the Mystic Realm at the seventh level attract the attention of the Evil Extermination Sect? Moreover, from the looks of it, it has caused much movement by the Evil Extermination Sect.”

Qin Yu frowned deeply, a strong sense of unease surging in his heart.

Soon, the warship arrived at the seventh level of purgatory.

At this moment, the seventh level of purgatory had completely changed. A colossal palace stood there out of nowhere.

The colossal palace pierced the clouds, and every intricately carved detail on the palace was vividly lifelike. A few statues resembling demon gods were carved on it, evoking a sense of fear at first glance.

However, the palace was not real and was a mirage. Qin Yu reached out and tried to touch the wall, and ripples appeared on the wall before it slowly disappeared.

The giant statues of the demon god seemed to be gods from the ancient era. Even with Qin Yu’s current terrifying divine sense, he seemed to sense danger and subconsciously dared not look directly at those gods.

Wu Feng, Xi Menn, the sect master of the Blood Sect, the evil exterminator, and the others stood in the seventh level of purgatory. Countless people with powerful internal qi were also in the seventh level of purgatory.

“Is that Situ Haoyue? He was a cultivator who had survived the last Path of Heaven. It was said that he had existed for 20,000 years. Unexpectedly, he shows up this time!”

“Mei Li is here too. She is a ruthless person who often goes to the ninth level of purgatory alone! That was a place where even eighth-grade True Saints had to team up to enter.”

A woman with a jade-like complexion and a graceful figure stood there, her face exuding exquisite beauty.

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted. She was the woman he saw earlier in the seventh level of purgatory. She was soaking in the bone cultivation water, and no demonic beast dared to provoke her.

As if feeling Qin Yu’s gaze, the woman’s bright eyes looked at Qin Yu and nodded slightly at him.

“Is that Chang Ye?”

“Who is this person? Do you know him?”

Elder Guai took a light breath.

…

More and more people came to the seventh level of purgatory. The ghostly qi of the palace erupted again. The palace suddenly expanded several times and instantly enveloped all the cultivators on the seventh level of purgatory.

In the palace, countless broken white bones were lying on the ground. When he stepped on them, the bones actually covered his chest.

And on top of tens of thousands of feet tall palace, countless bones were tied to the circular pillars.

Sensing it carefully, those bones emitted a terrifying internal qi. These skeletons were presumably all supreme experts when they were alive.

Qin Yu could not help but feel a chill run down his spine. So many human cultivators had died here. What exactly had happened in this palace?

Forcefully suppressing the uneasiness in his heart, Qin Yu extended his divine sense to the extreme and carefully sensed everything in this palace.

All of a sudden, a chilling and ancient odor rushed straight into Qin Yu’s nostrils.

“I can touch these bones now. This palace is gradually becoming real!”

“I can also touch this pillar, but I’ve never seen this material before.”

“Look, there seems to be a figure flashing past that demon god phantom!”

…

Some cultivators suddenly shouted. The entire scene was as noisy as a market.

A feeling of being spied on suddenly surged into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. An invisible pair of eyes seemed to be watching them, and that feeling was incomparably strange.

“No way. I’m getting out of this d*mn place! It’s d*mn too ominous.”

Amidst the sea of bones that covered their chests, some cultivators had already collapsed. This place was definitely not a benevolent one.

Some people began to flee frantically, but the moment they left the palace…

They suddenly failed to move, and their bodies deflated like a balloon. After that, only a piece of human skin fell to the ground.

In just a blink of an eye, nearly 30 people died.

Qin Yu unleashed his desolate divine eye. He saw that the moment those people died, all the internal qi on their bodies floated down beneath the palace.

Something must have been hidden beneath the ground!

And as these people died, the palace expanded.

Furthermore, the phantom had gradually materialized, and the bones underneath his feet faintly emitted a foul odor.

Suddenly, countless ghostly qi appeared at the top of tens of thousands of feet tall palace.

The vast amount of ghostly qi gradually accumulated and washed down like a waterfall in the next moment.

Qin Yu dared not relax in the slightest in the face of this strange ghostly qi.

He unleashed the Saintly Body Technique and placed Suo Lin’s shield before him.

The Fist of Annihilation also fiercely blasted out.

“Whoosh!”

In a blink of an eye, thousands of cultivators collided fiercely with the ghostly qi that fell like a waterfall.

What was surprising, however, was that whether it was an attack from the treasures or various spiritual energy and spiritual sense, the two would avoid each other in different dimensions in time and space.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s body seemed to have been hit heavily by a heavy hammer. The ghostly qi penetrated Suo Lin’s shield and the Saintly Body Technique and directly entered his body and divine sense.

Hundreds of people’s bodies instantly exploded. Just as their divine senses came out, they were pulled by an inexplicable internal qi and suddenly disappeared.

Countless attacks landed on the top of the palace.

The light emitted by the spiritual energy allowed people to see the appearance of the top.

Nine demon gods of different expressions were staring fixedly at everyone. Amidst the bombardment, the nine demon gods did not move at all. The spiritual energy that fell on top of them seemed to have disappeared into the sea and disappeared silently.

“It’s not the rules of the current Path of Heaven. It’s also not the power of rules from the previous era! All the attacks could only be withstood, and there was no way to defend.”

Chang Ye said softly.

If it was not the rules of these two Paths of Heaven, this Mystic Realm must have been passed down from even more ancient times.

As the desolate divine eye consumed a vast amount of spiritual energy, Qin Yu dared not keep it active. He only activated it the moment the Mystic Realm attacked.
