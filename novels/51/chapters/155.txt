Chapter 156: Even Hit Old Men? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu laid in the taxi. He didn’t have any strength at all.

Just now, he used up all his strength to climb into the taxi.

“It’s a pity that I didn’t kill him.” Qin Yu’s eyes were cold.

Qin Yu would never show mercy to those who wanted to kill him. Otherwise, they could make a comeback at any time.

He really didn’t expect the consumption of the Saintly Body Technique to be so huge. It seems that he should use it as little as possible in the future, Qin Yu thought to himself.

The car finally reached the hotel.

Even after the long journey, Qin Yu still couldn’t recover his strength.

Helpless, Qin Yu could only ask the taxi driver to carry him to the bed.

Lying on the bed, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

“I wonder if I can recover tomorrow,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

Tomorrow was the traditional Chinese Medicine Conference. If he couldn’t recover, things would really be troublesome.

On the other side, after Hong Wu went home, he fell into contemplation.

He couldn’t figure out how an Inner Strength Master Hands could defeat him despite such a large gap.

At this moment, Hong Wu felt a little conflicted.

He knew very well that Qin Yu had defeated him with the Saintly Body Technique.

If he tried to kill Qin Yu before the Saintly Body Technique was used, Qin Yu wouldn’t have had a chance.

But what if he failed? If he couldn’t kill Qin Yu, he would definitely die.

After thinking for a long time, Hong Wu finally decided not to take the risk.

“What a pity.” Hong Wu played with the Ganoderma and couldn’t help but feel a bit sad.

It wasn’t easy for him to get this Ganoderma, but he didn’t expect to send it back so soon.

At this moment, Mr. Yang was brought to the Wei family’s home.

Mr. Yang’s expression was dark, and his heart was full of worry.

“Young Master Wei, will Qin Yu... be okay...” Mr. Yang looked at Wei Ming. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Wei Ming opened his mouth, but didn’t say anything. However, the expression on his face showed his thoughts.

“It’s impossible for an Inner Strength Master Hands to escape from Hong Wu’s hands...” Wei Ming sighed in the end.

“Can you think of a way to save him...” Mr. Yang asked.

Wei Ming shook his head and said, “Hong Wu is an old Inner Strength Past Master. Even the Wei family isn’t willing to offend him.”

Mr. Yang suddenly felt sad. He laid on the bed with a sorrowful look on his face.

“Mr. Yang, rest early.” Wei Ming nodded to Mr. Yang and then walked out of the room.

How could Mr. Yang sleep? He laid on the bed with worry.

The next morning was the beginning of the Chinese medical conference.

Wei Ming prepared breakfast for Mr. Yang, but Mr. Yang was worried and couldn’t eat at all.

“Mr. Yang, what’s wrong?” Wei Ming asked casually.

Mr. Yang suddenly put down the chopsticks in his hand, stood up and said, “Young Master Wei, can you send me to the Chinese Medicine Conference’s venue?”

Wei Ming froze and frowned. “The Chinese Medicine Conference?”

Mr. Yang nodded and said, “It was originally Mr. Qin who was supposed to participate. Now that Mr. Qin had an accident, I will participate in his place!”

Wei Ming couldn’t help but fall silent for a moment, then he said, “Okay, I’ll send you there. Finish your meal first.”

After the meal, Wei Ming personally drove Mr. Yang to the venue of the Chinese Medicine Conference.

At this time, all the contestants had already arrived, and Zhou Tong was sitting in the judge’s seat with his face beaming with pride.

Mr. Yang slowly walked into the venue with heavy steps.

As soon as someone saw Mr. Yang, he teased, “Yo, Mr. Yang, where’s Qin Yu? Why isn’t he here?”

Mr. Yang turned a deaf ear and didn’t say anything. He just walked towards the venue with a heavy heart.

Soon, Zhou Tong discovered Mr. Yang’s figure.

When he saw Mr. Yang alone, the smile on Zhou Tong’s face grew even wider.

He stood up and walked towards Mr. Yang. His huge figure blocked Mr. Yang’s path.

Mr. Yang raised his head and glanced at Zhou Tong. He couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Mr. Yang, where’s Qin Yu? Why isn’t he here?” Zhou Tong asked despite knowing the answer.

Mr. Yang looked at Zhou Tong and said with a dark expression, “Mr. Qin has something to do. I’ll attend on his behalf.”

“Something to do?” Zhou Tong couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Is there something to do, or is he already dead?” Zhou Tong sneered again and again.

When he heard this, Mr. Yang’s expression instantly changed!

He raised his head and stared at Zhou Tong while berating, “Was it you who did it?”

Zhou Tong was instantly overjoyed. Qin Yu was indeed dead!

“Hahaha! So what? What can you do about it?” Zhou Tong said with some amusement.

Mr. Yang gritted his teeth and pounced towards Zhou Tong.

“You vicious villain!” Mr. Yang said aggressively and was extremely furious!

But he was already old, so how could he hurt Zhou Tong?

Zhou Tong grabbed Mr. Yang’s arm with ease and said coldly, “You dare to attack me? I now announce that you are disqualified!”

“So what if I am disqualified? I’ll fight it out with you!” Mr. Yang frantically waved his fists.

“You’re too gutsy!” Zhou Tong was instantly furious. He raised his hand and slapped Mr. Yang!

However, at this moment, a hand suddenly grabbed Zhou Tong’s wrist!

“You even hit old men. Zhou Tong, do you think you’re worthy of being the President?” Qin Yu was standing by his side while looking at Zhou Tong coldly.
