Chapter 697: Public Execution of Qu Xie! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qu Xie just shook his head at this question.

“These are recorded in the files of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. I’ve never seen them,” Qu Xie said.

“Files...” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He looked at Qu Xie and asked, “Are the files you mentioned in the

Scripture Pavilion?”

“That’s right,” a hint of surprise flashed across Qu Xie’s face.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “I think there should be a lot of things recorded in the files, right?”

Mentioning this topic, Qu Xie said proudly, “Of course! Almost everything that happened in the martial arts world was recorded in the files!”

Qin Yu thought to himself, “This Scripture Pavillion... I have to think of a way to get there.”

“One last question,” Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie.

Qu Xie nodded, “Go ahead.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and smiled. “There should be a lot of places belonging to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, right?”

“Yes, it’s natural as the palace of the martial arts world,” Qu Xie felt inexplicably proud.

Qin Yu asked, “Then... which place has the most martial artist?”

Qu Xie thought for a moment and said, “It’s Taoism Theory Library.”

“Taoism Theory Library?” Qin Yu seemed to find the name unfamiliar.

Qu Xie nodded and said, “That’s right. Taoism Theory Library is a public library set up by Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Many martial artists can come here to learn spells.”

This indeed surprised Qin Yu.

He had never expected that Jingdu Martial Arts Association would provide such public resources.

“The Taoism Theory Library... are you sure it has the most people there?” Qin Yu asked again.

Qu Xie snorted, “Of course. From Great Grandmaster to Martial Marquis, almost all of them have been to the library!”

Qin Yu nodded silently and said, “Okay, I got it.”

After asking, Qu Xie looked up at Qin Yu and said, “You can let me go now, right?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered. “Let you go? When did I say that I would let you go?”

Qu Xie’s face changed. He said coldly, “Qin Yu, aren’t you going to keep your promise?”

Qin Yu laughed. “Keep my promise? Why should I keep my promise to someone like you?

“Moreover, if I let you go, it would go against the harsh words I said before. Isn’t it also not keeping my promise?”

“You!” Qu Xie’s face changed drastically, and he was so angry that his face turned pale!

The internal qi on his body quickly rose. He then clenched his fist and threw it at the cage!

But at this moment, Robust had raised his big hand and easily pressed down on the cage.

All of Qu Xie’s qi energy was easily dissolved.

“Do you know why I asked you which place has the most people?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Qu Xie’s expression changed. He seemed to have realized something.

“What... What do you want?!” Qu Xie said in a panic.

Qin Yu laughed, “You are the prestigious president. Of course, you deserve a punishment that matches your identity.”

After saying this, Qin Yu drove to the Taoism Theory Library.

Qu Xie’s face was livid with anger. He said angrily, “Qin Yu, you are a despicable person who doesn’t keep your words! I will definitely kill you!”

Qin Yu ignored Qu Xie’s clamor.

He hummed a tune and rushed to the TaoismTheory Library.

...

At the TaoismTheory Library.

As the only social welfare resource of Jingdu Martial Arts Association, it naturally attracted countless martial artists.

Just as Qu Xie had said, from the Grandmaster to the Martial Marquis could be seen here.

Even though the spells here weren’t top-tier, being able to learn spells had been a great opportunity for an unspecialized person.

The entire library was rather quiet. Everyone was holding the books silently learning spells.

At this moment, noises were coming from the front of the library.

When they looked up, they saw a young man carrying a cage and walking forward.

There was an old man in the cage.

Seeing this scene, everyone looked over in unison.

The librarian shouted, “Who are you? What’re you doing?!”

Qin Yu glanced at him and pointed at Qu Xie in the cage. “Don’t you know him?”

“How do I know such a beggar?!” the librarian snorted.

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Get out now, or don’t blame me for being rude!” shouted the librarian.

At this moment, someone seemed to recognize Qin Yu.

“That person is Qin Yu!”

“The one in the cage... is Qu Xie, the president of Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“It’s true that Qu Xie was captured?”

Seeing this scene, many people took out their phones and wanted to take pictures of this scene.

Hearing this, the librarian’s face changed drastically and quickly retreated.

For a moment, everyone looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

“Tsk, tsk, I didn’t expect the dignified president to have been locked up in a cage.”

“This Qu Xie looks a little pitiful.”

“Haha, he deserves it! When he imprisoned others, did he ever think of others’ feelings?”

“Qin Yu is so admirable. He could even lock up the president of Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Faced with everyone’s gazes, Qu Xie’s expression was extremely unsightly.

He had been the center of attention since he was young. He was respected by all martial artists, and his status was extraordinary.

But now, he was locked up in a cage and was being watched like a dog.

This huge difference made Qu Xie almost collapse.

“Qin Yu, let me out. I can agree to anything you want!” Qu Xie gritted his teeth and said.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie coldly and said, “Don’t blame me. If you want to blame someone, blame the higher-ups of your association. They were the ones who gave up on you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at everyone.

He took a deep breath and said coldly, “I’ve said that if Jingdu Martial Arts Association didn’t let Yan Ruoxue go, I would kill their president.”

“The time is up. I still haven’t seen Yan Ruoxue. According to the agreement, I want to execute Qu Xie publicly!”

“Qin Yu, how dare you! Release our president immediately!” Someone suddenly shouted in the library.

Qin Yu glanced at him coldly, then with a wave of his hand, he smashed the person’s head into pieces!

“If anyone dares to talk nonsense again, I’ll kill them all,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The scene was instantly silent.

At this moment, the old woman had received the live broadcast.

“This Qin Yu...” the old woman gritted her teeth, and her expression was somewhat unsightly.

Her relationship with Qu Xie was extremely good. The two of them even had a relationship when they were young.

Now that she saw Qu Xie in such a miserable state, how could she not be angry!

Thus the old woman took out her phone and made a call.

“Go to the Taoism Theory Library immediately and kill Qin Yu!” said the old woman coldly.

In addition to the old woman, all the big families also saw this video.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com
