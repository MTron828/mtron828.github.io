The arrival of Yan Yongxiu unnerved Shen Yun.

This was enough to show that it was almost impossible for this matter to be settled.

“Shen Tian, remember later. No matter what he says, you must not admit that this matter has anything to do with you, understand?!” Shen Yun shouted anxiously.

Shen Tian was still unfazed. He just nodded and said, “I understand.”

Shen Yun was extremely uneasy. In the face of a person like Yan Yongxiu, none of his achievements and status were worth mentioning!

Very soon, Yan Yongxiu brought people to push the door open and entered.

Yan Yongxiu’s expression was calm and indifferent.

However, his intimidating aura made people tremble!

Even Shen Tian, who was extremely audacious, was a little afraid at this moment.

Because Yan Yongxiu’s presence was too imposing! Even the governor wasn’t as intimidating as him!

“Mr. ... Mr. Yan, why are you here...” Shen Yun suppressed the fear inside and said with a sheepish smile.

Yan Yongxiu glanced at him indifferently and didn’t say anything.

The bodyguard beside him immediately moved a chair and placed it behind Yan Yongxiu.

Yan Yongxiu slowly sat down and the person beside him lit a cigar for him.

The room was silent, but the more it was like this, the more frightened Shen Yun was.

Facing such a person was simply a kind of psychological torture! It was unbearable!

More and more sweat appeared on Shen Yun’s forehead. His body swayed and he almost fell to the ground.

Yan Yongxiu slowly exhaled a ring of smoke. He looked at Shen Yun and said indifferently, “Shen Yun, you have quite some guts.”

When he heard this, Shen Yun’s body softened and he immediately fell to the ground!

“Mr. ... Mr. Yan, I don’t understand your words...” Shen Yun braced himself and said.

“Oh really?” Yan Yongxiu raised his eyebrows. He took a puff of his cigar and said with a smile, “Do you think it’s meaningful to lie in front of me?”

Shen Yun’s body quivered again. He raised his head and said in a trembling voice, “Mr. ... Mr. Yan, I really don’t understand...” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I don’t understand...” Yan Yunheng’s expression gradually turned cold.

“Then I’ll remind you.”

“The last person who plotted against my daughter was the Sun family. You should know about the fate of the Sun family very clearly.”

When he heard these words, Shen Yun’s expression changed drastically again!

The Sun family of Jingdu! Back then, they were also a top-class blue-blood family in Jingdu!

However, the Sun family, which was prominent at that time, went bankrupt within a few days! Rumor had it that the Sun family’s elders and children had gone missing!

That incident was sensational in Jingdu back then, but no one knew exactly what had happened!

Some people said that the Sun family’s management wasn’t good, and some said that the Sun family had provoked someone they shouldn’t have provoked...

But no one knew that this was actually done by the Yan family!

Shen Yun knelt on the ground with a plop. His head hung on the ground, and he didn’t even dare to raise his head to look at Yan Yongxiu!

“Mr. ... Mr. Yan, this incident has absolutely nothing to do with the Shen family!” Shen Yun clenched his teeth tightly!

He knew very well inside that he couldn’t admit it no matter what! Because once he admitted it, the Yan family would never let them off the hook!

Yan Yongxiu looked down at Shen Yun and said coldly, “Raise your head and look at me.”

Shen Yun’s body stiffened and he said in a trembling voice, “I... I don’t dare...”

“I told you to raise your head!” Yan Yongxiu immediately shouted!

This bellow scared Shen Yun so much that he fell to the ground.

He struggled to get up from the ground and braced himself to look at Yan Yongxiu.

As he looked at Yan Yongxiu’s icy countenance, Shen Yun trembled like a sieve!

Yan Yongxiu looked at Shen Yun coldly and said, “Do you think I need evidence if I want to get rid of you?”

Shen Yun was stunned and immediately sat down on the ground.

Yes, the Yan family didn’t need evidence at all.

Once they were suspected by the Yan family, there was almost no chance of survival!

Yan Yongxiu glanced at Shen Tian, who wasn’t far away, and asked indifferently, “This is your son?”

Shen Yun hurriedly replied, “Yes, yes, Mr. Yan. This is my son, Shen Tian...”

After saying that, Shen Yun turned his head and shouted, “Greet him!”

Although Shen Tian could feel the powerful aura emanating from Yan Yongxiu, he, who had been spoiled, still didn’t feel fear.

He snorted and said, “My father has already said that this matter has nothing to do with us. Why are you so unreasonable?”

When he heard these words, Shen Yun was so angry that he almost fainted!

“What are you saying, you b*stard?! Apologize to Mr. Yan!” Shen Yun hurriedly shouted!

Shen Tian still said recklessly, “Even if you are a prominent family in Jingdu, you still need evidence. What right do you have to say that it has something to do with us?”

Looking at the stubborn Shen Tian, Yan Yongxiu couldn’t help but laugh.

“Interesting.” Yan Yongxiu rubbed the chair, and the corner of his mouth curled into a cold smile.

“How impudent! How dare you talk to Mr. Yan like this, are you courting death!” The bodyguard beside Yan Yongxiu roared angrily.

Shen Tian snorted coldly. “This is Chuzhou, not Jingdu! Moreover, there are only two of you. As long as I make a call, I guarantee that you won’t be able to leave Chuzhou. you don’t believe me?!”

Shen Yun was so angered by Shen Tian’s ignorance and arrogance that he almost collapsed.

At this moment, Yan Yongxiu’s expression had already gradually turned cold.

“It’s over. It’s over...” Shen Yun knew that this matter probably had no room for reconciliation.

He slumped to the ground with a vacant look in his eyes.

Shen Tian continued to look at Yan Yongxiu arrogantly while snorting coldly and said, “You have already made me unhappy. A strong dragon can’t suppress a local snake. Today, I will punish all of you!”

Yan Yongxiu looked at Shen Tian coldly without saying a word.

Shen Tian took out his phone and quickly dialed a number.

After making the call, Shen Tian sneered and said, “Get lost now. It’s not too late. Otherwise, I’ll make sure you won’t see the sun tomorrow!”

“Is that so?” Yan Yongxiu smiled nonchalantly.

“It’s been many years since someone dared to talk to me like that.” Yan Yongxiu raised his head and said with a sigh.

Shen Tian snorted lightly and said, “I’ve already given you a chance. It’s you who didn’t cherish it. Don’t blame me!”

“Mr. Yan, they’re already here.” At this moment, the bodyguard beside Yan Yongxiu said.

As soon as he finished speaking, the sound of helicopters suddenly came from outside the door!

Countless lasers passed through the window and directly shone into the house!

In addition, there were dozens of armored vehicles and hundreds of fully armed soldiers outside!
