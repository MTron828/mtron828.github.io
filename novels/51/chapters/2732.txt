Chapter 2733 - 2733: The Murder Case in Lingxu City

Moreover, this old Daoist was so powerful.

It was as easy as ABC if he wanted to kill Qin Yu. He did not need to go through so many tricks at all.

If there was no other way, he could leave this place.

Qin Yu shook his head. He couldn’t afford to offend him or hide from him.

He didn’t have a reason to stay here. If there was no news of Ruoxue and the others, he could leave immediately.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. In the next moment, his pupils turned pitch-black.

The power of God’s Space exploded in his body!

His body suddenly shattered into countless pieces. In the next moment, he appeared in the Soul Suppression Ring’s passageway.

The damage was transferred into the Soul Suppression Ring. Then Qin Yu returned.

Boom!

A terrifying power exploded.

Dao Realm level 6!

Holy energy flowed through Qin Yu’s body, filling him with power.

As expected, he could cultivate like this!

He had comprehended this cultivation method after facing the combined attack of the power of eight trigrams.

This power almost destroyed his entire body, but the power of the Dao of Dreams transferred him into the dreams.

Whereas his body had faced the damage in reality.

Therefore, his physical body would be strengthened again after he used the power of the night. It was equivalent to tempering his physical body in a life-and-death situation.

If he hadn’t cultivated the Dao of Dreams, he might not have experienced such a crushing tempering in his entire life.

Therefore, this kind of cultivation was a little like cheating.

However, he needed to endure the full pain of being crushed into pieces because the power was real. Even if he could transfer into the dream world, he still needed to endure it first.

“I’ve consumed about one-thirtieth of the power of the dream while the rest is the Night Qi.”

Qin Yu once again transferred the power of God’s Space out of the passageway and examined it.

Moreover, the power of the Kun Peng of the Eight Trigrams was also in the passageway.

Even if the power of the dream was exhausted, he still had this power as a substitute.

These two powers belonged to a higher level.

He now had that fist-sized Saint Crystal, so he could immediately replenish the Night Qi he had consumed.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. Countless blood splattered out from his skin again.

For a week, Qin Yu practiced this technique ten times in total.

At the last time, his divine soul felt like it was on the verge of collapse. His body began to convulse uncontrollably.

“It seemed that this was my limit.” A person facing death felt extremely hopeless.

This wasn’t just a direct pain in his divine soul and body. There were also many negative emotions mixed in.

Any cultivators would collapse after experiencing two or three times in a row of such real death experiences.

It was just that Qin Yu, this freak, had once experienced the extreme pain of condensing his divine soul into a pearl.

The power left behind by his father had protected his origin at that time, allowing him to endure the pain. Therefore, that was a transformation of his soul.

After that, he had experienced Jun Yixian’s thousand-year One Thought Reincarnation and had lived many lives.

His divine soul was already ridiculously abnormal at this moment, which was why he could withstand ten such cultivation sessions in a row.

Dao Realm level 8!

After a week of cultivation, his holy energy had reached Dao Realm level 8.

His physical body was more than three times stronger than before.

It was unknown how many levels of peak power his physical strength could compare to.

The levels of the Dao Realm below level 10 were graded according to the strength of the holy energy.

Level 10 and above were graded according to the peak power cultivated.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s physical strength was far above the strength of his holy energy.

He thought he could directly blast a person below the Holy Consciousness level into pieces under his full-strength physical attack now.

Qin Yu exerted a little force on his knees. The entire ground emitted a dull rumbling sound.

Then, the entire floor sank a few hundred meters.

That terrifying power also shocked Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s every single bone and muscle hid a terrifying power after he underwent crazy cultivation.

Every cell seemed to contain ten times the amount of holy energy.

As long as Qin Yu had a need, he could completely release it to clean up everything in front of him.

This power even made Qin Yu feel a little afraid. He was afraid that he could not control his power.

The potential of the Milky Way Holy Body was a little terrifying. This situation also showed the potential of the Milky Way’s holy energy.

Just like how there was a limit to one’s ability, there was also a limit to one’s physical strength.

Qin Yu had the illusion that he could not control it. It meant that he still had more room for development.

However, he could feel that the strength of his body was improving lesser and lesser on the eighth, ninth, and tenth time of this destructive cultivation.

He seemed to be used to this power.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I have to find a chance to try this new power!”

Qin Yu was also very curious about what kind of power he could erupt with now.

“Sir, what happened?”

When the young man saw the miserable state of the room, he immediately had a horror expression.

One had to know that this was Lingxu City. The foundation here was sturdy.

Even the power of level 9 could not cause such damage.

“Little brother, it’s fine. I accidentally damaged it when I was cultivating. I’ll compensate you. ”

Qin Yu said with a smile. “It’s fine. I thought you were in trouble too.” The waiter looked relieved. “In trouble? Did something happen this week?”

Qin Yu was curious.

“The words I told you previously can be considered a slap in the face. From the day you moved in, there have already been close to two thousand people killed right in this Lingxu City.”

The waiter smiled bitterly.

“Kill and rob? So many people have been killed, isn’t there relevant information?”

Qin Yu frowned.

“This is Lingxu City! It had to be known that there hadn’t been a single murder case before, but two thousand people had been killed this time. The Guardians of Order, the Path of Heaven Academy, and the Upper Dome had all sent people to investigate, but they had found nothing. Those people seemed to have died of natural causes. One of them was the Dao Realm level 9 who lived next door. There wasn’t any signal when he died.”

Qin Yu’s heart was filled with shock. How could a Dao Realm level 9 die silently?

Since the people guarding this city could not find anything, it showed how terrifying the culprit was.

“Big brother, you should leave this place as soon as possible. By the way, do you have the Mark of Atonement on your chest?”

The waiter suddenly thought of something and asked Qin Yu.

“Is this the Mark of Atonement?”

Qin Yu tore off his clothes, revealing the mark that had appeared after he saw the Tomb of Heavenly Sins..
