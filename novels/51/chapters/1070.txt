Chapter 1071: Chapter 1,071: loosening of the seal 

Just as Qin Yu had guessed, the Sky Blood Rainbow was relying on some kind of carrier to carry that power.

The Sky Blood Rainbow waited for a long time, but neither Qin Yu nor the Immortal Crane left the second mystic realm.

This caused the sky blood rainbow to be unable to retrieve that power, so he had to think of a way to trick Qin Yu Out!

Yan Jinyao remained silent as if he was weighing the pros and cons.

The scene of the last fight with the immortal crane was still vivid in his mind. Although the two sides only exchanged one palm strike, the difference was obvious.

Even today, Yan Jinyao still had lingering fear in his heart.

“What? Are You Afraid of Qin Yu?”When Tian Xuehong saw the situation, he fanned the flames by the side.

Yan Jinyao snorted lightly and said, “I’m not afraid of him. It’s just that he has a martial saint by his side. That martial saint is not simple.”

Tian Xuehong laughed loudly and said, “Don’t worry. If you had issued a challenge to Qin Yu, how could he bully the weak with numbers?”

Yan Jinyao remained silent, but he was still uncertain in his heart.

Qin Yu was the person who had killed Gu Zizhen. That was a martial saint at the peak of the Martial Saint Realm!

He had even fought with the higher-ups behind him once. Even Yan Jinyao did not have confidence in such combat strength.

“I will give you the secret technique of the slaughtering immortal sect. I will guarantee that you will be able to kill him in an invisible manner and make your name known throughout the world!”Tian Xuehong said in a deep voice.

Yan Jinyao snorted coldly and said, “I don’t lack secret techniques.”

“You don’t lack them? Can the secret technique in your hands be compared to the slaughtering immortal sect? That was the most mysterious sect ten thousand years ago! It was a sect that could hold the entire sect in power!”Tian Xuehong’s tone carried a hint of pride.

“This is an opportunity for you. If I can enter the martial saint realm, I will not trouble you.”

Yan Jinyao thought for a moment. Then, he narrowed his eyes and said in a deep voice, “Alright, I will agree to it.”

Tian Xuehong could not help but heave a sigh of relief in his heart.

However, he was finally fooled.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu and Immortal Crane had been guarding the second mystic realm.

They spent two days looking for the entrance of the second mystic realm to the first mystic realm, but unfortunately, they didn’t find anything.

Not only that, the second mystic realm didn’t seem to have any treasures.

“It shouldn’t be. How could the famous second mystic realm be so poor?”Qin Yu touched his chin and said in a low voice.

“Could it be that Gu Zizhen hid the treasure ahead of time? Or has he moved it to the first secret realm?”

The immortal crane said, “Let’s wait for Zhai Xing. He might know something.”

Zhai Xing had been staying in front of Gu Zizhen’s grave for the past few days. No one disturbed him.

Qin Yu was also waiting quietly, waiting for him to come down from the mountain.

To Qin Yu, his heart was still somewhat anxious.

Firstly, it was because he wanted to see Yan Ruoxue as soon as possible. Secondly, it was because the higher-ups of the first mystic realm were like a sharp blade hanging above their heads, ready to fall at any time.

If he could not increase his strength as soon as possible, then it would be very difficult to deal with the main body of the higher-ups of the first mystic realm.

While the two of them were chatting, Zhai Xing had already walked down from the mountain.

Qin Yu, who was highly sensitive, immediately noticed Zhai Xing’s figure.

He suddenly stood up and said in a low voice, “Zhai Xing has come down.”

Following that, Qin Yu walked quickly to the foot of the mountain.

When he arrived at the foot of the mountain, Zhai Xing happened to walk down from the mountain.

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere was quite strange.

The two of them were supposed to be enemies, but at this moment, the relationship was somewhat complicated.

“Gu Zizhen is already dead, and I’m not the one who killed him,”Qin Yu said.

“But you’re the one who started it,”Zhai Xing replied.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, “Do you really think so? Even if I, Qin Yu, am not here today, Zhang Yu, Li Yu, and Sun Yu will still appear.”

Zhai Xing immediately fell silent.

He sighed slightly, he said in a low voice, “Yes, speaking of which, you are just a rebel who has been oppressed. It’s just that... all these years, I have been used to seeing one person after another stand up against the second mystic realm. I didn’t expect it to end so quickly.”

“Time is a rolling wheel. There will always be people who will be pressed under the wheel,”Qin Yu said faintly.

Zhai Xing did not argue about this matter anymore. He was very clear in his heart that it would be effortless for Qin Yu to kill him now.

“Let’s go.”Qin Yu patted Zhai Xing on the shoulder.

This time, Zhai Xing did not refuse. He followed behind Qin Yu all the way to the main hall.

The main hall was filled with bad luck and was no longer as prosperous as before.

The entire second mystic realm was filled with a sinister killing intent.

“I want to know where the passage from the second Mystic Realm to the first mystic realm is. If you don’t tell me, I will kill you.”The Immortal Crane walked forward with an extremely cold tone.

He didn’t have the patience of Qin Yu. Moreover, the immortal crane didn’t like humans to begin with.

Zhai Xing stood up and said coldly, “Then come and try it.”

“Buzz!”

A strange phenomenon immediately appeared behind the immortal crane!

Under this strange phenomenon, even Zhai Xing felt a trace of pressure.

“That’s enough.”Qin Yu walked between the two of them and blocked the battle.

“Zhai Xing, we do need to know about the passage. I believe you should know something.”Qin Yu stared at Zhai Xing and said.

Gu Zizhen was dead, so there was no point in Zhai Xing being stubborn. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He was silent for a moment and said in a low voice, “I do know.”

The Immortal Crane put away the strange phenomenon and waited for Zhai Xing to continue.

Zhai Xing said in a deep voice, “Although I have never been to the first secret area, I know that the higher-ups will come to the second secret area from time to time.”

“However, they are extremely cautious when it comes to the first secret area. It is said that the passage leads to the great path of cultivation.”

“What do you mean?”Qin Yu asked.

Zhai Xing raised his head and looked at Qin Yu. He said, “That passage blocks the cultivation of martial artists and blocks the opportunity for cultivation.”

“Not to mention stepping into the Almighty, even a martial saint would not be able to do so.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “I have indeed heard of this rumor. However, the strange thing is that many people have already stepped into the martial saint realm this year.”

Zhai Xing said in a deep voice, “There is only one possibility. The seal that has blocked the cultivation has already loosened.”

“They have predicted many times that someone would step into the martial saint realm. This prediction is not because they have comprehended something from the Great Dao, but because they already knew that this seal would loosen this year.”
