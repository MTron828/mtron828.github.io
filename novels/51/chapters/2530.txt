2531 The Orc Army

After the king of flame spirit, Chief of Flame, was defeated, the remaining living beings of the Demon Flame Mountain Range almost posed no threat to them.

In about three days, almost all the remaining monster race living beings in this large area were killed.

“D*mn it! The monster race army is here.”

Elder Guai’s expression changed, and he sent a loud voice transmission to everyone to be on guard.

Suddenly, the entire ground shook rhythmically, and the water on the ground rippled with the tremors.

“Get ready. This time, the monster race army seems to have many people.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The internal qi of this monster race army that had been baptized by the Path of Heaven seemed to have connected. Even if it was wandering in the void, it could rely on its overall strength to suppress the spatial storm and not sink into the void.

Furthermore, such roaming in the void was tremendously hard to detect due to the effect of the spatial storm.

Only at close range could one notice this kind of spatial tremor. However, this would mean that the monster race army was about to descend and could no longer be avoided.

Therefore, even the three Saints did not notice the monster race general, Xiang Yu, and his army roaming in space for a long time.

The world seemed trembling at this moment, and a massive stench permeated the entire Demon Flame Mountain Range.

A vast black legion slowly emerged from the spatial rifts in all directions, and an immensely rugged four-winged orc army appeared before everyone.

These orcs were taller and more robust than ordinary humans, their muscles well-refined, exuding a powerful aura.

Moreover, their body structure was closer to that of the orcs. They had broad shoulders, thick arms, and strong lower limbs.

As the orc army appeared non-stop, everyone’s hearts could not help but sink.

There were nearly 5,000 orcs in the army.

This four-winged monster race army was formed by the orcs at the Reversion Void Stage and True Saint. However, after being baptized by the Path of Heaven of the monster race, their combat strength was not something that the current Human Race Watch army could contend.

Even the elite members of the Gu family were ashen from the pressure of a real army.

A terrified expression appeared on most people’s faces.

“Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!”

As the battle drums of the orc army rumbled, the four-winged monster race army began to charge forward.

“Kill!”

Under the leadership of the respective monster race leaders, their forces were united and charged at the scattered human race cultivators.

“Get lost! Fist of Annihilation!”

Qin Yu punched the ground, and nine gigantic black flaming dragons spiraled up from the ground.

These black dragons roared as they charged toward the four-winged orc army. However, the nine fire dragons were instantly slashed down under their combined attack.

The power of Qin Yu’s six acupoints burst out, and his left foot suddenly kicked the air.

Like an arrow, his body left the bow and arrived in the middle of the monster race army that came from all directions.

“Go to hell!”

The moment he landed…

Almost at the same time, several enormous hammer shadows were wandering in the forest like venomous snakes, directly hacking at his back.

Qin Yu’s body was knocked down, and a terrifying massive force suddenly swam on his back.

The power of meditation!

A taste of sweetness appeared in Qin Yu’s throat, and a surge of green power instantly surged on his back.

It instantly strengthened the defense of his entire back dozens of times.

His body crashed down onto the ground.

Relying on this force, Qin Yu’s Evil Eye stabbed into the ground, and a yellow wave swept out in all directions.

“God-slaying Dusk!”

The huge kingdom of dusk appeared above Evil Eye, and nearly a thousand monster race soldiers fell under this attack.

“Assemble! Thunder Courtyard and the Jee family will attack first, and the Gu family will defend at the back. Let’s coordinate!”

Qin Yu’s face was pale. He had used the God-slaying Dusk consecutively several times.

Furthermore, the power of meditation consumed an astonishing amount of his soul power. This was the limit he could do for the moment.

Otherwise, the first wave of the monster race’s attack would have caused heavy casualties to Human Race Watch cultivators.

Fortunately, Qin Yu managed to buy time before the human race cultivators could react.

The second wave of attack arrived immediately after!

The orc did not panic because of Qin Yu’s attack. Their army was divided into four teams.

As they unleashed their power again, four enormous white hammers smashed toward the Human Race Watch.

The terrifying power stirred up a massive wind in the surroundings. Qin Yu hesitated for a moment but did not make a move. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

If he had done that, and Human Race Watch still could not resist, it would mean they were unsuitable for this kind of battle.

The future battles would only become even more cruel. Qin Yu could not protect them forever.

The cultivators of the three peaks also attacked with all their might. They smashed all kinds of treasures against the monster race army, and the Gu family also resisted the charging force with all their might.

“Boom!”

As the four terrifying forces charged into the defensive circle of Human Race Watch, the bodies of more than 200 people before them were instantly smashed into pieces.

“Charge! Fight them at close range. Don’t give them the chance to charge again.”

The peak master roared and turned into a bolt of lightning as he charged into the orc army.

Behind him, the cultivators of Demon-slaying Peak and the other two peaks followed suit.

In a one-on-one battle, these orcs were no match for the human race army. The peak master seized the opportunity in this instant.

The two sides charged at each other, and the orc army behind them wanted to form a joint attack.

However, they were dispersed by Qin Yu who had been staring at them.

Brilliance of Stars and Moon!

At this moment, the third peak’s second joint attack came again.

Countless forces blasted out from each cultivator’s hands and then connected. They again charged toward the monster race army that was accumulating power.

As the power of Brilliance of Stars and Moon was released, the feeling of the connection between the souls and this attack grew stronger.

With a thought, Qin Yu suddenly appeared in front of the army.

As he waved his palm, the power of the Brilliance of Stars and Moon accelerated again.

It was like a stream of light that penetrated his back and blasted out with his palm.

“Boom!”

Amidst the massive tremors, the 300 or so four-winged orcs in front of him were directly shattered by this attack.

“As expected!”

Qin Yu was overjoyed. This joint attack technique was not that simple.

Not only could he combine the power of many forces into one, but those who cultivated the complete cultivation method seemed to be able to borrow this power. It was similar to Demon King Xiang Yu’s method.

At this moment, the three monster race living beings extremely far away revealed expressions of disbelief.

It was an attack that only the monster race army would have. This kind of power could only be obtained after the baptism and sacrifice of the monster race’s Path of Heaven. How could the human race cultivate a similar cultivation method?

“I’ll report this matter to Supreme Demon First Emperor immediately.”
