Chapter 1190: Chapter 1,190, a trip to the holy region 

In the Heaven Gate.

Qin Yu had already sent someone to fetch old Mister Yan.

Before he left, Qin Yu had to settle this matter properly.

The next day.

Old Mister Yan was brought back to the Heaven Gate.

In the blink of an eye, nearly three years had passed, and old Mister Yan looked much older.

Back then, when he changed his body, old Mister Yan only had three years left in his life. Now, it seemed that his lifespan was almost up.

Seeing Old Mister Yan’s originally young body turn into such an old man, Qin Yu could not help but feel a little sad.

He did not know how to explain to Ruoxue in the future.

“Is there any way to extend old Mister Yan’s life?”Qin Yu looked at Pavilion Master.

Pavilion master shook his head and said, “Prolonging one’s life is not something that mortals like you and I can do.”

Qin Yu’s expression became even uglier.

He had forcefully extended old Mister Yan’s life once before. It was already impossible for him to repeat the same trick.

Old Mister Yan did not seem to care about his own lifespan. He looked at Qin Yu’s white hair and could not help but exclaim, “Qin Yu, your white hair...”

“Old Mister Yan, this is a cultivation technique I cultivate. You Don’t have to worry.”Qin Yu didn’t speak the truth.

Afterwards, Qin Yu welcomed old Mister Yan into the room. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

After entering, Qin Yu poured a cup of tea for Old Mister Yan.

Old Mister Yan took a sip, then said, “Qin Yu, have you seen Ruoxue recently?”

“No.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“Ruoxue is in the saint-level. I thought about bringing you there, but your body... I’m afraid it can’t take it.”

Old Mister Yan was an ordinary person. In addition, he was nearing the end of his lifespan. There was no way he could withstand the fluctuations of the spatial formation.

“I’m already old. Why Bother?”Old Mister Yan waved his hand.

Then, old Mister Yan suddenly asked, “Why have you come to see me this time?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I have agreed to cooperate with Yan Sihai. As long as he gives you the Yan family, I will give Yan Jinyao a place to go to the Holy Region.”

Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but be speechless after hearing it.

He said with some gratification, “I didn’t expect you to be able to force the Yan family to bow down.”

Qin Yu sighed slightly and said, “Speaking of which, I am ashamed. I should have finished it earlier, but it has been delayed until now...”

Old Mister Yan lay on the chair and sighed, “No one expected that the world would develop to this day. The Martial World could even affect all the worlds.”

Qin Yu also nodded slightly. Just as Old Mister Yan had said, no one had expected this.

Then, Qin Yu intentionally or unintentionally glanced at old Mister Yan’s face.

Through the desolate God’s eye, he seemed to want to see old Mister Yan’s lifespan clearly.

According to Qin Yu’s speculation, old Mister Yan’s lifespan probably wouldn’t exceed three months.

This made Qin Yu let out a long sigh.

How would he face Yan Ruoxue when he reached the holy region.

At this moment, a Maybach drove in from outside.

This car was extremely iconic, and it was even more famous in Jingdu.

Almost everyone who was famous knew that this car came from the Yan family.

Seeing this car, old Mister Yan’s eyes narrowed slightly.

A complicated look flashed across his old face.

As soon as the car stopped, he saw Yan Sihai get out of the car.

He walked quickly to the main hall and was about to speak when he saw old Mister Yan beside him.

“Dad...”

Yan Sihai muttered in a low voice. Facing Old Mister Yan, his heart was filled with mixed feelings.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Yan Sihai and said, “Have you thought about it?”

Yan Sihai gritted his teeth and said, “I promise you.”

Then, Yan Sihai looked at Old Mister Yan and said, “Dad, I... I will take you home now.”

“Wait.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly called out to Yan Sihai.

“President Yan, can I have a word with you?”Qin Yu said.

After saying that, Qin Yu took the lead and walked out of the room.

The two of them came to an empty place.

“Do you have anything else?”Yan Sihai asked with a frown.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Sihai coldly and said, “Old Mister Yan doesn’t have much time left. He can live for another three months at most.”

“I hope that during these three months, you don’t cause any more trouble. After all, he is your father.”

Yan Sihai was stunned, and his brows furrowed slightly.

“I believe that after old Mister Yan leaves, the Yan family will definitely pass it on to you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“In the last three months, do your best to be filial.”

“I... I understand.”Yan Sihai nodded.

On the same day, Yan Sihai brought old Mister Yan back to the Yan family, and according to Qin Yu’s request, he publicly released a statement on the media.

After doing all of this, Qin Yu could be considered to have settled one of his worries.

The next day.

Yan Jinyao came to the Heaven Gate and conducted the test.

It had to be said that although Yan Jinyao’s cultivation had been crippled, his talent was extremely rare.

It was not an exaggeration to say that after many days of Lu Yun’s test, Yan Jinyao was probably the one with the strongest talent, without a doubt.

After a few more days, the 30 spots had been filled up, and the testing was completely over.

“It’s time to set off, right?”Qin Yu looked at Lu Yun and asked.

Lu Yun nodded and said, “I need to set up the array flag. I’m afraid it will take a few days.”

“How long will it take?”Qin Yu asked.

Lu Yun thought for a moment and said, “Give me three days.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

Three days was just enough time to finish the things that needed to be dealt with.

“That he teng and Tian Jizi actually didn’t show up.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Facing the temptation of going to the holy region, they were actually able to remain calm. It was really surprising.

That day, Lu Yun publicly issued a statement:

Three days later, he took everyone to sanctum.
