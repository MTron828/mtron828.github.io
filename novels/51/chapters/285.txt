When she heard Yao Qing’s words, the female reporter’s face immediately blushed.

Qin Yu, who was in the room, didn’t know how to react.

He waved his hand and said, “Let her in.”

The female reporter hurriedly walked into the room. She quickly walked in front of Qin Yu and said with a pleading look, “Can you accept my interview?”

Qin Yu said helplessly, “I’ve already answered you once. Do you want me to answer you a second time?”

When she heard this, the female reporter immediately wiped her eyes and pretended to sob. “It wasn’t easy for me to get this job. If I can’t get an interview, I’ll be fired.”

“What does that have to do with me?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said.

“You want to play the pity card with me? I’m sorry, I have no pity.”

The female reporter was instantly speechless. She didn’t even know what to say.

“Mr. Qin, I’m begging you. Please help me,” the female reporter said softly.

“As long as you promise me, I’ll do anything you want!”

Before Qin Yu could say anything, Yao Qing, who was at the side, said with a lecherous look, “Really?”

The female reporter glared at Yao Qing and said, “I’m not interviewing you. What does it have to do with you?!”

After saying that, she put on a pitiful look and looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu touched his chin. He could see that if he didn’t agree today, this female reporter wouldn’t give up. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, he had no way to tell her about the fight between him and Gu Taichu.

Gu Taichu had deliberately suppressed his strength and cultivation. If he really fought with his true strength, Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to win.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu said, “I can’t tell you about this.”

“Gee, just promise me.” The female reporter grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and kept shaking it.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “But I can promise you an interview. As for the content of the interview, I will decide.”

“Huh?” The female reporter was stunned.

“But... the request is for me to interview you and Master Gu for the decisive battle...” the female reporter said with some difficulty.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I will give you a satisfactory interview.”

The female reporter was a little confused, but there was still some anticipation in her eyes.

An idea was born in Qin Yu’s mind. This idea was related to the Han family, and its value was definitely greater than the fight with Gu Taichu.

Thus, the female reporter thought about giving it a try and started the interview.

A video recorder was placed in the room. The female reporter held the microphone and faced Qin Yu.

“Has it started?” Qin Yu asked.

The female reporter hurriedly nodded and said, “It has started.”

Qin Yu coughed at the camera, and then said slowly, “I’m Qin Yu. Not long ago, I had an agreement with the eldest young master of the Han family, Han Wei.”

When she heard this, the female reporter’s expression changed slightly.

Qin Yu continued, “He had always coveted my wife and tried to use the backing of the aristocratic families to oppress me. However, after my resistance, he didn’t succeed in the end.”

“At the same time, Han Wei and I made an agreement.”

“Half a year later, I will go to Jingdu and propose to the eldest daughter of the Yan family. I will also publicly battle with Han Wei. If I win, he will give up on my wife, Yan Ruoxue, and kowtow to me three times.”

Han Wei didn’t say these words at all. It was completely made up by Qin Yu himself.

Not to mention the female reporter, but even Yao Qing, who was at the side, widened his eyes.

“Then what if you lose?” The female reporter asked.

Qin Yu said indifferently, “I won’t lose. I will crush Han Wei to death, just like crushing an ant!”

Qin Yu paused at this point and continued, “But I also want to ask everyone to supervise, in case Han Wei is afraid of not being able to beat me and sends someone to kill me in advance.”

The interview came to an end.

Meanwhile, the female reporter was filled with excitement!

“Mr. Qin, this news is too explosive!” The female reporter said excitedly.

“Thank you so much! When I take this back, the higher-ups will definitely be very satisfied. They might even give me a promotion and raise my salary!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Oh right, as the media, you guys should know how to come up with a headline, right?”

The female reporter was stunned and asked in confusion, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “The title is called... a struggle between the lower class and the aristocratic families, and also a revolt against oppression!”

“As to who will be the victor, I hope everyone will pay more attention.”

When she heard Qin Yu’s words, the female reporter couldn’t help but give him a thumbs up and said, “Mr. Qin, you’re really a genius! It would be a pity if you don’t become an editor!”

Qin Yu’s title quickly raised his own position.

He had become a martial artist fighting against the aristocratic families, while the Han family had been labeled as black-hearted capitalists.

Qin Yu had lived at the bottom level since he was young, and he knew inside that countless people hated capitalists as much as he did.

Therefore, as long as this news was broadcast, it would definitely attract everyone’s attention and even praise.

“Mr. Qin, I don’t even know how to thank you. How about... I treat you to a meal?” The female reporter said.

“There’s no need for a meal. It’s just a small matter.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

The female reporter thought for a moment, then took out a business card and gave it to Qin Yu. She said, “How about this? In the future, if you go to Jiang Bei, you can call me. I’ll definitely thank you properly then!”

“How?” Yao Qing came forward and asked with a lecherous look.

“Shut up!” The female reporter glared at Yao Qing.

Then, the female reporter said goodbye to Qin Yu and left the place.

Qin Yu glanced at the business card and learned the female reporter’s name: Li Ruodan.

“Mr. Qin, if you’re not interested, can you give her to me?” Yao Qing rubbed his hands and said.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “If you want to pick up a girl, go pick up a girl yourself. A girl isn’t an item, so how can I give her to you?”

After saying that, Qin Yu ignored Yao Qing and turned around to walk upstairs.

Qin Yu believed that this news would definitely cause a sensation in the entire martial arts world!

...

The next day, Gu Taichu arrived at Qin Yu’s door early in the morning.

Qin Yu also prepared a car and was ready to set off.

“Mr. Qin, where are we going?” After getting into the car, Yao Qing asked.

“Jiang Bei’s Bin Province,” Qin Yu said.

Yao Qing’s pupils immediately dilated as he said with some fear, “Mr. Qin, I remember Gu Taichu is in Bin Province, right? If we go to Bin Province, will Gu Taichu let us off?”

“Moreover, I’ve even insulted him on the Internet. This old b*stard definitely won’t let me off!” Yao Qing muttered.

Qin Yu immediately looked at Gu Taichu.
