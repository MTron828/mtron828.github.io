1929 News about Pavilion Master

Seeing Qin Yu keeping quiet, Gu Xinghe did not continue asking.

“I really want to see between the two chaotic bodies, who will achieve greater achievements in the future,” he said with emotion.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be self-deprecating. “How can I compare to the Holy Son of the Si family? You think too highly of me.”

“Is that so?” Gu Xinghe’s brows twitched, and he said, “Back then on Earth, the Gu family wasn’t someone you could mess with, but what happened in the end? I worked very hard for so many years, but then I was destroyed in your hands.”

Qin Yu remained silent. As he could not figure out Gu Xinghe’s intentions, he naturally did not dare to say anything. The more he said, the more mistakes he would make.

Gu Xinghe laughed and said, “It’s all in the past. I don’t care about it anymore. Speaking of which, do you have any plans?”

“No, I’ll just take it one step at a time,” Qin Yu said perfunctorily.

“How about this? How about staying in Serene South City?” Gu Xinghe said with a smile.

“Serene South City might not be big, but to the Si family, it is the southern border. It will have a lot of development in the future.”

Only then did Qin Yu suddenly realize why he could sense several powerful internal qi in Serene South City.

“Forget it. I’m used to being free by myself,” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Gu Xinghe laughed and said, “Alright, I won’t force you. How about this? You stay in Serene South City for the time being. I’ll send people to mine the mine now. We’ll split it up when the time comes.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu nodded in agreement.

After that, Gu Xinghe arranged accommodation for Qin Yu. The place was quite luxurious, with mountains and rivers, and it was not far from the palace in Serene South City.

After Qin Yu left, the general-in-chief walked in.

He stood by Gu Xinghe’s side and cupped his hands. “City Lord, I didn’t expect you to meet your old friend.”

“Yes,” Gu Xinghe said expressionlessly. “I also didn’t expect to see him so soon. Holy Region is still too small.”

“Compared to the vastness of the universe, Holy Region is indeed very small,” the general-in-chief said.

At this point, the general-in-chief changed the subject and continued, “City Lord is really open-minded and magnanimous. He crippled your cultivation, and you could actually smile away all grudges.”

Upon hearing this, Gu Xinghe’s expression turned cold.

He waved his hand, slapped the general-in-chief’s face, and cursed, “Smile away all grudges? F*ck you! All these years, every day, I can’t wait to tear him into pieces, burn his bones, and scatter his ashes! If it weren’t for him, I would still be the lofty young master of the Gu family!”

The general-in-chief was stunned. He touched his face and frowned. “Then why did you…”

Gu Xinghe snorted coldly and said, “We can’t do anything to him for the time being. He’s full of tricks, and no one knows how many cards he has up his sleeve.”

“City Lord, aren’t you overthinking? This is Serene South City, and you are a member of the Si family. What does his trump card matter?” the general-in-chief laughed bitterly and said.

Gu Xinghe said coldly, “Back then, I had the same thoughts as you. Unfortunately, not only did I fail to get rid of him, but I also passively stimulated his growth. Even a lion would use its full strength when hunting a rabbit. It’s always good to be cautious.”

Gu Xinghe had indeed grown a lot over the years. He was no longer the reckless and arrogant guy from back then.

“City Lord, I understand now. What do you want me to do?” the general-in-chief asked.

Gu Xinghe sneered and said, “This kid and Yan Ruoxue are in a relationship. I’ve been trying to get information out of him, but he didn’t fall for it. It seems like he doesn’t trust me.”

“What? He is in a relationship with the saintess of the Yan family?” the general-in-chief was completely dumbfounded.

Placing his hands behind his back, Gi Xinghe snorted and said, “That’s right. After I tell this to the Holy Son, he can’t escape. Let him stay in Serene South City for the next few days and serve him good food and drinks. We mustn’t offend him.”

“I understand.” The general-in-chief nodded in agreement.

…

On the south of the palace in Serene South City, a house was suspended above the water.

Qin Yu was standing by the railing at this moment, looking at the trickling water, frowning.

“This Gu Xinghe, what is he trying to do?” Qin Yu murmured.

Based on Qin Yu’s understanding of Gu Xinghe, he was not the kind of person who would let go of grudges easily.

“No matter what he’s trying to do, I have to find a chance to leave this place as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He used his divine sense to probe the surroundings and realized Gu Xinghe did not deploy any men nearby.

This surprised Qin Yu.

“Could it be that this kid had really changed? Did he really start missing his old friends? That was simply unbelievable!”

Gu Xinghe had been cruel and merciless back then. No one knew how many people he had killed!

“If I sneak away now, Gu Xinghe won’t discover,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, after much consideration, Qin Yu finally decided to wait, because the temptation of the ore was too great.

At the same time, this incident also taught Qin Yu a lesson.

If he excavated treasures as a rogue cultivator, they would be taken as stolen even if he found something good.

“If I had known it earlier, I would have brought Saintess Gu along,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He then stopped thinking about it. Instead, he sat down cross-legged and began to meditate.

This was also a kind of cultivation, a kind of cultivation of the state of mind. Although there was no visible effect in the short term, it was very likely to change his entire cultivation path.

In the following few days.

Gu Xinghe brought good wine and food to Qin Yu every day. Not only that, he even gave him several extremely precious pills.

One day, Gu Xinghe came to Qin Yu’s place with a brocade box and two bottles of wine in his hands. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He handed the brocade box to Qin Yu and said with a smile, “I remember you’re a pharmacist… Oh no, it’s called alchemist here. You should be familiar with this pill.”

Qin Yu opened the brocade box and soon recognized the origin of the pill.

“Heavenly Astral Spirit Pill?” Qin Yu stared at the pill in front of him and was stunned.

...

“That’s right! As expected of an alchemist, you have sharp eyes!” Gu Xinghe nodded.

“This Heavenly Astral Spirit Pill is a top-notch pill. Rumor has it that it’s tremendously beneficial to one’s divine sense. You…” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“I’m giving it to you,” Gu Xinghe waved his hand and said generously.

“Really?” Qin Yu was even more dumbfounded.

“It’s just two pills, not worth mentioning,” Gu Xinghe said with a smile. “Speaking of which, I don’t think you can refine such a pill, do you?”

“With my ability, surely I can’t refine such a pill,” Qin Yu said, shaking his head.

Gu Xinghe suddenly changed the subject as he looked at Qin Yu and smiled. “Do you know who refined this pill?”

“Who?” Qin Yu was puzzled.

“Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, your old friend,” Gu Xinghe said mysteriously.

“What? Pavilion Master?” Upon hearing this, Qin Yu got up immediately
