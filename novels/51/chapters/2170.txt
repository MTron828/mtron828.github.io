2171 Qin Yu’s Madness

There was no boundary, no time, and nothing was there.

Qin Yu felt he had fallen into an endless abyss in this dark void. Loneliness and despair continued to erode his soul.

His body was bound by the dark power in the void, unable to move or breathe. It was as if being trapped in an endless cage.

Time became blurred here, and everything was at a standstill. Qin Yu tried to find an exit, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not find a way out.

Qin Yu’s consciousness gradually began to blur over a long time in this dark void. He felt his strength constantly being consumed, and the flame of his life slowly extinguished.

In the darkness, the despairing Qin Yu was floating in the void and fell asleep.

He was in complete despair and could not even feel his existence in this void.

But right at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly woke up!

The tremendously dense and painful internal qi on his body attacked again.

Qin Yu’s eyes were scarlet red as he stared fixedly at the void. Endless greed and desire burst out from his eyes!

“I will not die in this d*mned place. I won’t!” Qin Yu raised his head and roared. However, his voice failed to echo in the void and was quickly devoured!

At this moment, Qin Yu was like a madman. He raised his head and roared angrily. All the pores on his body opened up at this moment!

“If you have the guts, let me die here. Don’t even think about trapping me!” Qin Yu was planning to go all out and began to devour this inexplicable internal qi madly! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That incomparably dense internal qi surged madly into Qin Yu’s body, seemingly endless!

Following Qin Yu’s frenzied devouring, he felt the power in his body begin to surge violently as if it wanted to tear his body apart!

At this moment, Qin Yu was like a crazy demon. The double pain made his body tremble violently!

The pain brought about by the inexplicable internal qi pierced through Qin Yu’s body like a thousand needles, each seemed to be torn apart. His entire body trembled, and sweat dripped down his forehead. However, he gritted his teeth and endured the pain with all his might.

His body was filled with the impact of the dark power as if countless sharp blades were dancing in his flesh and blood, cutting his body apart.

Qin Yu felt his bones being shredded, his organs rolling in excruciating pain, and his blood burning like flames.

The agony caused his mind to nearly lose clarity, and his consciousness blurred amidst this torment.

However, not only did Qin Yu not restrain himself, but he also became even crazier like a madman. He even laughed out loud!

His face was ferocious, and his body was trembling, but the madness in his eyes did not diminish!

Qin Yu continued to devour the inexplicable internal qi madly, but this action did not relieve him. Instead, it intensified his pain.

Whenever internal qi surged into his body, he felt a thousand knives cutting him. His entire body trembled, and the pain was like a tidal wave drowning him.

Blood seeped out from the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth. He roared ferociously but his voice was swallowed by the dark void. There was not even a trace of echo. His eyes were as red as blood, filled with madness and despair.

His skin began to deform, and his distorted muscles twitched in pain. His body seemed to be about to be torn apart.

The internal qi he had devoured filled his blood, spreading to every cell of his like a poisonous snake. He felt the stinging pain of his bones being corroded, the pain of his internal organs being torn apart, and his soul being tormented endlessly.

His breathing became increasingly difficult as if an invisible hand was tightly gripping his throat, causing him to be unable to breathe. His body trembled violently and convulsed uncontrollably.

The pain was approaching its limit, and Qin Yu almost could not bear it anymore, but he did not give up. He clenched his fists tightly as blood seeped out from his fingertips. He gritted his teeth and endured the incomparable pain with all his might.

Qin Yu’s body trembled violently. He was enduring the pain brought by the internal qi as if lava was surging in his blood. His skin began to turn numb, covered in pain, and unable to feel the stimulation of the outside world.

His breathing became abnormally hard. Every breath seemed to draw flames into his lungs. A deep groan came from his throat. His painful voice echoed in the dark void, but it was superseded by endless silence.

Qin Yu felt as if he was being torn apart. His body was like thousands of pieces of puzzles being mercilessly torn apart. The painful stimulation continued to spread through his nerve endings, drowning his entire consciousness.

He clenched his fists so tightly that his nails dug into his flesh, and blood dripped down his fingertips. He gritted his teeth, and the veins on his forehead bulged. The muscles in his entire body tensed up as if he was enduring this endless pain.

“Hahaha!” Blood gushed from Qin Yu’s mouth, but his face became crazier.

Anyone who saw Qin Yu at this moment would treat him as a demon, a demon living in the void!

“There is no construction without destruction. If you have what it takes, let me die here. I will never become a prisoner!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth, and his face filled with madness.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s expression slightly changed as if he had sensed something.

Then the madness in his eyes disappeared and was replaced by ecstasy!

“This internal qi… indeed can be absorbed!” Qin Yu exclaimed in shock.

Although the internal qi was a tremendous burden on his body, it actually began to transform slowly after entering his body. Like spiritual energy, it began to be absorbed!

“Could it be…The dense internal qi in the void was the chaotic qi! Qin Yu suddenly thought of something!

The chaotic qi would also bring pain and a sense of burden, but it would not be so extreme!

However, there was another possibility, and that was that the chaotic qi in the void was even purer. It was the purest of all chaotic qi!

“In that case… I still have a chance to walk out of here!” Qin Yu was incomparably excited. The despair in his heart was swept away and replaced.

Qin Yu’s eyes flickered with excitement and a glimmer of surprise. He felt the spark of hope had reignited within him.

Qin Yu quickly adjusted his state. He restrained his previous madness and became calm and alert. He understood that this sudden turn of events might be his only chance to survive.

He began to absorb this pure chaotic qi and maximized the use of its power. His body began to tremble, but this time, it was no longer the painful trembling but the shock of anticipation.

The chaotic qi filled his entire body, penetrating his meridians and fusing into his bones and flesh.
