Chapter 2845: Who’s Right

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Jue Wu hurriedly stopped everyone from talking seeing that the situation was getting out of control.

“Who was that person just now? What’s his background?”

She stared at the person sitting beside her with a solemn expression.

“You should have heard of his name in the lower realm. I also have some connections with him.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“He was Senior Wu Ji.”

“What?! Didn’t Wu Ji die a long time ago? You also obtained his inheritance, the Traceless Immortal Scripture, and that cloth.”

Chang Mang was shocked. This person was one of the top existences of the Era of Annihilation. Why did he appear here?

“That was just a Dao tomb Senior Wu Ji had created for himself. After that, he had no opponents in that era. He could even use the power of tribulation to resist the power of the Immortal Emperor. However, he was schemed and his divine soul was imprisoned here by the power of sealing god.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

He did not expect that the first soul body that he and Xiao Hai had dabbled in was Wu Ji’s remnant soul.

The two of them used all their strength.

This included the powers of creation that Qin Yu had just awakened and the Beech Wood Commandment Xiao Hai had comprehended.

However, they were still easily suppressed by Wu Ji.

Without Qin Yu sensing the familiar internal qi of Traceless Immortal Scripture and using the Fist of Annihilation, they would have been completely beaten into remnant souls.

This kind of power was indescribable. In addition, the other party was only one of the scattered divine souls.

“The real Senior Wu Ji has long died. This is just a remnant soul that the Investiture of Gods forced to restrain. It was also the senior’s action to rescue both of you. I didn’t even know you were here.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

There were still many mysteries in the Investiture of Gods’ space. Wu Ji had never talked to him before.

However, he knew everything about him and could even sense what was happening in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

This kind of method was almost heaven-defying.

Therefore, he was shocked when he left the Investiture of Gods with the incomplete page and brought Jue Wu and Chang Mang in.

Both Qin Yu and Xiao Hai were confused.

Qin Yu learned about the dangerous process of Chang Mang and Jue Wu after a brief conversation.

It turned out that the two of them had also brushed past the Grim Reaper in a split second.

“Thank you, Senior Wu Ji.”

Qin Yu turned to look at the expressionless person. There was only deep admiration in his heart.

“F*ck! This place seems a little strange. Why do I feel like my previous path is wrong?”

Chang Mang finally realized that something was wrong here. He could use the power here in the Investiture of Gods.

Inadvertently, the aura on his body soared a little.

“It’s the Divine Phoenix Race’s internal qi. It seems that they have given their last bloodline to you.”

Wu Ji made a faint sound, but he just sighed softly.

Then, he left silently. This sigh seemed to contain a deep sense of helplessness.

“The Divine Phoenix Race can no longer continue, so they entrusted their last strength to me.”

Jue Wu also sighed. She knew that she might not be able to bear this burden.

However, she had to bear it. This made her feel a huge pressure.

“Auntie Jue Wu, don’t think too much. Anyway, whoever dares to provoke me will be beaten up. If they don’t want to admit defeat, then I will beat them up until they do. Even the demon race’s Saint can’t do anything to us this time. This shows that the heavens aren’t going to kill us. We will beat them up in the future!”

Chang Mang laughed heartily, not showing the slightest hint of nervousness.

In the following period, Jue Wu and Chang Mang borrowed the power here to cultivate crazily.

Their internal qi began to increase explosively.

Xiao Hai used his terrifying deduction power to help them perfect their cultivation.

Whether it was the divine might holy body or the power of the divine phoenix inherited by the Nirvana Body, both of them had compatible cultivation methods.

This was directly related to one’s peak power. Therefore, one could only rely on one’s deduction to gradually implement it.

They were gradually deducing the next step of the cultivation method in the Investiture of Gods’ space now.

Their strength increased exponentially with every breath.

A beech space was spinning in front of Xiao Hai’s chest.

One commandment after another shuttled through it. At a certain moment, the power gathered here.

Chang Mang and Jue Wu’s deduction sped up once again.

“They can only rely on themselves now. The two cultivation methods are both special powers. Only they can find the path that suits them the most. Our time should be about up. We have to leave this space after Chang Mang and Jue Wu wake up.”

Xiao Hai said softly. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Is the Investiture of Gods’ giant coming back?”

Qin Yu’s brows twitched. He could not help but feel his heart palpitate when he thought of the terrifying existence.

“I’m not sure for the time being, but one thing for sure is that this wielder’s schemes are not something we can match. Your power had heavily injured it. Although it will not easily appear in front of you again in the short term based on its cautious personality, it might try again. Now that we can’t use the power of the chaotic body and the Heavenly Emperor bloodline, we might not be able to resist.”

It was a combination of factors the last time for him to severely injure the giant.

This power’s calculations had already begun when he was a Dao Guardian.

He had heavily injured this ancient giant with the help of luck.

However, they had no chance of winning against such a terrifying giant no matter how they looked at it. It would determine to destroy everything the next time it appeared in front of everyone.

Qin Yu nodded with a solemn expression.

“It’s best if you can have a chat with Senior Wu Ji. We can’t see very far. If Senior Wu Ji can give us some pointers, it will be of great help to us.”

Xiao Hai looked at the figure and suddenly said.

“Let me try.”

Qin Yu had been trying to communicate with Wu Ji’s divine soul since he awakened it, but he had never received a response.

“Senior Wu Ji.”

Qin Yu cupped his fists.

“Does the human race still have hope?”

Qin Yu asked bitterly after waiting a long time without receiving a response.

Judging from the current situation, the true supreme experts had yet to make a move. Supreme experts like the Immortal Crane and Ksitigarbha were still behind the scenes.

However, the human race was already at an absolute disadvantage. Qin Yu did not understand why people like Zi Yang, Chen Zhisha, and Holy Saint Jue Chen, who should have belonged to the human race’s absolute combat strength, would choose another path against them.

Qin Yu had a terrifying guess.

They might be able to see through reality. What if their choice was right? Chen Zhisha once said that they were working hard for the existence of the human race.
