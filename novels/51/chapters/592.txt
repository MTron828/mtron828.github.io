Chapter 593: The Sinister Yan Guiyi Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He Teng couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

He Teng had always wanted to change his status.

A mere aristocratic family from the Central Plains wasn’t even worth mentioning.

If he could join the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, then that would be a true qualitative change in his status.

“Captain Yan, what do you need me to do?” He Teng asked.

Yan Guiyi put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I can see that you aren’t as simple as you seem. I will create an opportunity for you to get rid of Qin Yu.”

“When you kill Qin Yu, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will naturally give you a position.”

He Teng said in a low voice, “Captain Yan, do you think I can kill Qin Yu by myself?”

“No.” Yan Guiyi shook his head.

He put his hands behind his back and said slowly, “To tell you the truth, even I am not completely confident that I can kill Qin Yu, but I will think of a way to make Qin Yu’s condition decline.”

“Oh really?” This made He Teng even more surprised.

“If that’s the case, why didn’t you find someone else to do it? Instead, you came to me?”

Yan Guiyi snorted. “Because you are the most suitable.”

He Teng didn’t say anything. He was silent for a moment, then nodded and said, “Okay, I promise you.”

Yan Guiyi nodded approvingly and said, “Go. I will find an opportunity for you.”

He Teng didn’t say anything more and turned around to leave.

The first round of the Demonic Beast slaughter gradually came to an end.

At this time, the sky gradually darkened and the sun had already set.

At night, Yan Guiyi gathered everyone together. He held the inner cores in his hand and said nonchalantly, “Now, I’ll distribute the inner cores.”

He flipped his palm, and one inner core after another fell into his palm.

The quality of these inner cores varied. Among them, the Qingfu Tortoise’s inner core that Qin Yu killed was the most precious.

Yan Guiyi took out the Qingfu Tortoise’s inner core. He glanced at everyone and said, “Yan Jinyao.”

Yan Jinyao walked out with big steps. He looked at Yan Guiyi quietly and waited for Yan Guiyi to continue.

Yan Guiyi handed the inner core to Yan Jinyao and said, “This is your inner core.”

The expressions of the bottom class people couldn’t help but change.

Qin Yu’s brows also furrowed slightly.

“F * ck you! This inner core clearly belongs to Qin Yu. Why should it be given to Yan Jinyao?” At this moment, Chang Mang suddenly said angrily.

Yan Guiyi’s expression was extremely cold. He raised his finger, and the bracelet on Chang Mang’s hand immediately sparkled.

The intense pain instantly made Chang Mang want to kneel on the ground!

“I’ll give you a chance to change your words,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

Chang Mang endured the pain and struggled to stand up from the ground. His entire body was covered in a layer of crimson red. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’ll... kill you!” Not only did Chang Mang not show any remorse, but he even clenched his fist and rushed toward Yan Guiyi!

Yan Guiyi snorted lightly. He waved his large palm and a huge force instantly sent Chang Mang flying!

“You all saw it. He was disrespectful first,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

He was worried that he couldn’t find a reason to get rid of Chang Mang. He didn’t expect Chang Mang to do so of his own accord!

At this moment, Qin Yu stood in front of Chang Mang. He looked at Yan Guiyi coldly and said, “Chang Mang is right. The inner core of this Qingfu Tortoise should belong to me. Why should you give it to Yan Jinyao?”

Yan Guiyi snorted lightly and said, “Since the distribution rights are in my hands, I can give it to whoever I want.”

Yan Jinyao smiled nonchalantly and said, “The stronger you are, the more you will get. As if he should give it to you?”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu immediately took a step forward when he heard that!

His body was full of fighting spirit as he sneered and said, “So you think you are stronger than me?”

“Or what?” Yan Jinyao didn’t want to be outdone. He looked at Qin Yu and his internal qi burst.

“Then let’s give it a try!” Qin Yu strode forward with his fighting spirit bursting to the limit!

The sudden change made everyone somewhat surprised!

Yan Guiyi frowned slightly and snorted. “The bottom class people don’t know the rules at all. It seems that we have to teach you a good lesson. Otherwise... you will never know how to be obedient!”

With that, Yan Guiyi let out an angry roar, and the power on his bracelet exploded once again!

This terrifying power wrapped around everyone’s body, and everyone’s expression changed drastically!

This time, it seemed to be even more powerful than it was the last time. Even Qin Yu couldn’t bear it and fell to the ground with a plop!

It was also at this time that Yan Jinyao strode forward and punched out with both his fists at the same time, and sent Qin Yu flying!

Qin Yu struggled to stand up from the ground. Just as he was about to move forward, Yan Guiyi suddenly increased his strength!

“Boom!”

In an instant, Qin Yu’s entire mind received a heavy blow, and he instantly fell to the ground!

Yan Guiyi looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Do you know your mistake?”

“My *ss!” Qin Yu said through gritted teeth.

Even if Qin Yu couldn’t stand up, it still couldn’t bend his unyielding will!

Yan Guiyi sneered and said, “You’re quite stubborn. Well then, I’ll let everyone accompany you to be punished.”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. He looked at the others and saw that their faces were already pale. Some of them couldn’t even bear it anymore.

“Qin Yu, even if we die, we won’t lower our heads to him!” Chang Mang gritted his teeth and said.

However, Qin Yu frowned.

He could withstand this power, but the others might very well be tortured to death by this power.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth.

He took a deep breath and said, “I’ll give this inner core to you.”

Only then did Yan Guiyi nod his head in satisfaction. He waved his hand and dispelled the power in everyone’s bodies.

“Remember, in this place, I have the final say,” Yan Guiyi swept his gaze over everyone and said coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold. Although he felt hatred in his heart, he could only endure it.

A few minutes later, Yan Guiyi finished distributing the inner cores in his hands.

When it was Qin Yu’s turn, Yan Guiyi deliberately threw the inner cores on the ground and stomped on them until they were crushed.

“I’m sorry. I accidentally crushed these inner cores,” Yan Guiyi said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold, and a murderous internal qi instantly burst out!

“What? Do you want to rebel?” Yan Guiyi raised his eyebrows and asked.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said coldly, “Yan Guiyi, you will pay the price. Just you wait.”

Yan Guiyi couldn’t help but sneer.

He leaned against Qin Yu’s ear and said in a low voice, “Think about how you’re going to leave this place first. Oh right, Yan Ruoxue is in a lot of pain in prison now. Although she won’t die, she will be tortured forever.”

“Can you imagine the pain of having all the regenerated blood stripped away? You can’t even protect the woman you love. What a pity.”

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in anymore.

His golden fist burst out and smashed at Yan Guiyi!
