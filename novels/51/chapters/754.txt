Within the mansion.

Qin Yu sat alone under the moonlight, adjusting his internal qi slightly.

As his strength grew stronger and stronger, it became more and more difficult to increase one’s realm.

Many people would be stuck at a certain realm for the rest of their lives. It was unknown how many geniuses would stop before a certain realm.

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought, a beautiful figure appeared at the door.

Raising his head, he saw a curvy and graceful woman appear at the door.

Qin Yu glanced at her and frowned. “Who are you?”

This woman walked slowly towards Qin Yu with light steps.

She pretended to be delicate and pitiful as she whispered, “Mr. Qin, I am an ordinary member of the Martial Arts Academy. I. . . I have encountered some difficulties recently. I really have no choice. After thinking about it, I can only come to you for help...”

“Encountered some difficulties?” A trace of shock flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

The woman continued, “Yes, I am being pursued by a group of people. Right now, they are hiding outside the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Once I go out, I will be attacked by them...”

As he looked at the delicate and pitiful woman in front of him, a trace of ridicule flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

“So what do you want me to do?” Qin Yu asked.

The woman hurriedly said, “Please help me kill them! As long as you kill them, I’ll be safe!”

“Mr. Qin, as long as you’re willing to help me, I’m willing to do anything!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Why should I help you?”

“If you don’t help me, I’ll only die...” the woman sobbed softly.

“What does your death have to do with me? Do I know you?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

The woman opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but Qin Yu waved his hand and interrupted her.

“I won’t help you. Go out,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Mr. Qin, I...”

“I told you to go out. Don’t you understand?” Qin Yu said coldly.

The woman had no choice but to stand up and grit her teeth as she walked out.

Qin Yu wasn’t a person who was overflowing with sympathy.

Moreover, the woman’s words were full of loopholes, making it hard for people to believe her.

...

In the forest, the woman told Granny Qin what had happened.

Granny Qin said with a cold expression, “Trash! If you can’t even do this, how can I trust you?!”

The woman opened her mouth, bit her lips and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu is unyielding. He doesn’t believe me at all. I. . .”

“Bang!”

Before the woman finished her words, she was suddenly hit in the chest!

This slap immediately made her fall back. Her sternum was broken and blood kept flowing out of her mouth.

The intense pain made it difficult for her to even breathe. A trace of paleness appeared on her pretty face.

She looked up and saw Granny Qin looking at her coldly.

“Granny Qin, you...” the woman pointed at Granny Qin, her face full of confusion.

Granny Qin sneered. “It looks more realistic this way. Go, think of a way to trick him out.”

The woman’s expression was extremely ugly, but there was no turning back. At this moment, she already had no way out.

She could only endure the pain and walk towards Qin Yu’s mansion again.

Ten minutes later.

The woman appeared in front of Qin Yu again.

This time, she looked miserable.

The wound on her chest was shocking, and the blood at the corner of her mouth kept gushing out.

“Mr. Qin, I beg you to help me, or else... or else I will die...” the woman said with a pained expression.

Seeing her like this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

“You really went all out. Injuring yourself?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer inside.

Just as Qin Yu was about to refuse, another figure appeared at the door.

This person was none other than Yan Jinyao.

“Qin Yu, you really have a vicious heart. When someone comes to beg you, you actually won’t do anything?” Yan Jinyao said with a sarcastic tone.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “If you’re so kind, you can help her.”

Yan Jinyao spread his hands and said, “That won’t do. She’s begging you, not me.”

“Didn’t some person claim that he’s standing on the side of ordinary people? Now that someone comes to ask for help, he won’t budge. How hypocritical.” Yan Jinyao continued to ridicule.

Hearing this, Qin Yu slowly stood up.

He looked at the woman and narrowed his eyes. “I’ll give you a chance. Tell me, who asked you to come?”

A trace of panic flashed through the woman’s eyes. She hurriedly said, “I. . . No one asked me to come...”

From her expression, Qin Yu was even more certain of his thoughts.

Qin Yu took a look at the wound on her chest and said in a deep voice, “You’re so ruthless. Be careful.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the woman gritted her teeth and couldn’t help but lower her head slightly.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and then said, “You go first. I will come back later.”

Hearing this, the woman hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, thank you, Mr. Qin!”

After the woman left, Qin Yu walked straight out of the main door.

“You really have a flood of sympathy, don’t you?” Seeing that Qin Yu had agreed, Yan Jinyao ridiculed him again.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “How did your asshole grow on your face? Stay away from me. I think it stinks.”

Yan Jinyao’s expression instantly turned cold.

He snorted lightly and said, “Vulgar thing.”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Yan Jinyao. He turned around and left the mansion, walking directly toward the Martial Arts Academy. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the forest.

Granny Qin was looking at this woman coldly.

“It’s been half an hour. Where is he?” Granny Qin said with a cold expression.

The woman quickly said, “Granny Qin, he really said that he would be here soon. Please wait a little longer.”

Granny Qin said impatiently, “Idiot, have you been deceived by him again?”

“No... impossible, he really promised me...” A trace of panic flashed across the woman’s face.

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes.

She was about to speak when she felt a trace of internal qi approaching her.

“He’s coming.” Granny Qin’s lips curled into a cold smile.

In a short while, Qin Yu’s figure appeared in front of the two of them.

“Granny Qin, he’s here!” The woman said excitedly.

Granny Qin didn’t say anything. She just quietly looked at Qin Yu, who wasn’t far away.

“Granny Qin, you promised me the bloodline. You mustn’t forget it,” the woman said carefully.

Granny Qin glanced at her and then grinned. “Don’t worry, of course I won’t forget it.”

Before she could finish her words, Granny Qin suddenly stretched out her shriveled claw-like palm and slapped the woman’s head!

With a crisp cracking sound, the woman’s head was directly smashed into pieces!

“Trash also wants to touch the bloodline? It’s simply wishful thinking,” Granny Qin said sinisterly.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

Qin Yu had already warned her, but in the end, she still died because of her own greed.

“You’re really ruthless. Aren’t you afraid of your reputation being tarnished?” Qin Yu looked at Granny Qin and said coldly.

Granny Qin said indifferently, “You are the one who killed her. Why should I be afraid?”

“Qin Yu had an evil plot against the female student. He was afraid that the matter would be exposed, so he killed her ruthlessly,” Granny Qin said indifferently with her hands behind her back.
