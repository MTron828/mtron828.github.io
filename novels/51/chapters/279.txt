Chapter 280: The Current Situation of the Yan Family Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Jiang shook the wine cup in his hand and said indifferently, “There are some things that I should tell you.”

Qin Yu stared at Yan Jiang and couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.

He took a deep breath and said slowly, “I want to know everything about the Yan family.”

Yan Jiang seemed to have guessed it already.

He didn’t speak for a long time and only shook the wine glass in his hand.

After a while, Yan Jiang slowly said, “The strength of the Yan family is beyond your imagination. Even in Jingdu, it can be ranked in the top.”

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly, but didn’t interrupt Yan Jiang’s words.

Yan Jiang continued, “The complexity of a prominent family like this is beyond your imagination.”

“Although the Yan family is very powerful, it isn’t as flawless as it looks on the surface.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. “What do you mean?”

Yan Jiang glanced at Qin Yu and said, “On the surface, the Yan family seems to be impregnable, but in fact, it is unstable internally.”

“The reason why the Yan family hasn’t fallen apart yet is that Old Mister Yan is still alive.”

“As long as he is alive, the Yan family won’t fall.”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly.

Updates by

He couldn’t help but think of what Han Wei had said.

Old Mister Yan didn’t have long to live.

Qin Yu quickly looked at Yan Jiang and waited for his next words.

Yan Jiang continued, “Such a large family has branches that are beyond your imagination. They seem like a family to outsiders, but in reality, they are fighting among themselves.”

“Old Mister Yan has four sons. Each of them is secretly competing for control of the Yan family.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“For example, Miss Yan’s father Yan Yongxiu’s position in the Yan family isn’t as high as you think.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. No one knew what he was thinking.

Yan Jiang continued, “But because Old Mister Yan favored Yan Yongxiu’s eldest daughter, Yan Yongxiu was able to rise with the tide.”

“But what about after Old Mister Yan passes away? At that time, would Yan Yongxiu be able to maintain his current position?”

“Can Miss Yan continue to be the apple of the Yan family’s eye?”

Qin Yu’s expression became even more unsightly. He said somewhat defiantly, “Even if Old Mister Yan really passed away, his four sons are still biological brothers after all...”

“Biological brothers?” Yan Jiang scoffed at this.

“There is no true kinship in a prominent family. In the face of benefits, no relationship is worth mentioning.”

At this point, Yan Jiang looked at Qin Yu and said, “Let me tell you some bad news.”

“Among the four branches of the Yan family, the strongest is that of the eldest son of the Yan family, Yan Sihai.”

“And Yan Sihai’s relationship with Yan Yongxiu isn’t good. It can even be said to be very bad.”

“Old Mister Yan’s favoritism towards Yan Ruoxue caused Yan Sihai to harbor a lot of resentment.”

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted together.

He couldn’t understand these large families, and couldn’t understand the conflict between them.

“Which one of the people at the top didn’t climb up after much struggle? Their feelings have long been abandoned.” Yan Jiang shook his head while appearing somewhat helpless.

Qin Yu was silent.

He raised his wine glass and emptied it.

Qin Yu didn’t expect that Yan Ruoxue would also be in a predicament.

“Old Mister Yan is still alive. Miss Yan can protect you, but once Old Mister Yan is dead, I’m afraid Miss Yan won’t even be able to protect herself.” Yan Jiang put down the wine glass in his hand.

Qin Yu immediately felt a strong sense of crisis!

Although Qin Yu didn’t understand the internal conflict of the Yan family, he understood one thing inside.

That was, once Old Mister Yan died, it would mean that Yan Ruoxue’s status would rapidly decline! She would even be in danger!

“Qin Yu, Miss Yan has high expectations for you,” Yan Jiang said nonchalantly.

Qin Yu clenched his fists and he gazed towards Yan Jiang with determination.

“I won’t let her down.”

“If one day, she really falls into a difficult situation, I will never let her suffer any grievances.”

“Even if the opponent is the Yan family or the Han family!”

Yan Jiang laughed.

He reached out and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder while saying, “Qin Yu, some things can’t be said easily. Before you have absolute strength, you aren’t qualified to say this.”

“Although your progress is astonishing, with your current achievements, in front of the Yan family, you don’t have the slightest ability to fight back.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He knew that the gap between him and the Yan family was very big, but he didn’t expect the gap to be this big.

“I hope you can protect Miss Yan for the rest of her life,” Yan Jiang said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Jiang and said seriously, “I will let Ruoxue become the most powerful person in Jingdu.”

Hearing this, Yan Jiang couldn’t help but want to laugh.

“It’s not that I look down on you, but it’s just that these words aren’t realistic.” Yan Jiang shook his head.

“Unless you can become the next Ye Qing before Old Mister Yan dies.”

Ye Qing? It was Ye Qing again.

Qin Yu had heard this name countless times!

He was silent for a long time, then raised his head to look at Yan Jiang and said, “What level is Ye Qing at? And what martial realm is he at?”

Yan Jiang looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “In short, he is an existence that surpasses Inner Strength Grandmasters. When he was thirty years old, he had already reached the realm of Martial Marquis.”

Martial Marquis?

This was the first time Qin Yu had heard of this realm.

Yan Jiang smiled and said, “In short, you only need to know that Martial Marquis’s strength is far above that of Inner Strength Grandmasters.”

“Even a hundred peak Inner Strength Grandmasters aren’t worth mentioning in front of a Martial Marquis.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I understand.”

At this point, Qin Yu looked at Yan Jiang and asked with some doubt, “Why did you suddenly tell me all this?”

Yan Jiang let out a long sigh and said, “To tell you the truth, when I first met you, I looked down on you.”

Qin Yu nodded. He knew about this very clearly inside.

“But I didn’t expect you to have such achievements in such a short period of time.”

“And... I like your unyielding spirit, even when facing families and forces that are far more powerful.”

“In today’s society, which person isn’t groveling and struggling to survive...”

Yan Jiang sighed, as if he was lamenting.

Qin Yu also felt the same. He also knew that every person who stood at the top had struggled to reach there, and the competition for resources along with it.

This also caused the people at the bottom to always look up to them.

“Let’s not talk about this anymore. It’s time for me to leave.” Yan Jiang stood up and said.

“Thank you for the wine. Although it doesn’t taste good, I like it.”

After saying this, Yan Jiang was ready to leave.

“Wait!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly called out to Yan Jiang.

He stared at Yan Jiang and said, “Between you and Han Wei, who is stronger?”

Yan Jiang was silent for a moment and said, “Han Wei is the heir of the Han family. The resources he enjoys aren’t something I can compare to.”

Although Yan Jiang didn’t say it explicitly, his meaning was very obvious.

“Oh right, I have bad news for you.”

“The eldest son of the Yan family, Yan Sihai, is quite close to the Han family. If Old Mister Yan dies, Yan Sihai will most likely betroth Miss Yan to Han Wei.”
