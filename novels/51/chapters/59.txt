Chapter 60: If You Can Do It, Then You Do It Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qi Yang’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

The venue was dead silent!

“What... What happened?” Someone whispered.

Lin Wan even shouted from below the stage, “Qi Yang, stop playing around and quickly beat him up!”

Hearing Lin Wan’s shout, Qi Yang couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

As if he didn’t want to move! Was it him? He couldn’t move at all!

“This is your so-called inner strength?” A hint of ridicule flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

Qi Yang gritted his teeth and shouted angrily, “Don’t mock me!”

After saying that, he held up his other hand and pressed it towards Qin Yu’s head!

This time, Qin Yu didn’t even move and allowed Qi Yang’s fist to smash towards him!

“Bang!” A muffled sound rang out! Qin Yu didn’t move at all!

Qi Yang felt as if his fist had smashed into a rock and it hurted to the core!

“This... how is this possible?!” Qi Yang’s expression became increasingly unsightly!

This punch had almost used up all of his strength, yet it didn’t injure Qin Yu in the slightest? How was this possible?

“Inner strength isn’t that impressive.” Qin Yu sneered.

Qi Yang gritted his teeth. He tried his best to break free, but he realized that his strength was no match for Qin Yu’s!

At this moment, Qi Yang was filled with indescribable fear!

He was definitely not a match for the man in front of him!

At this moment, Qi Yang only wanted to escape!

“Qi Yang, break his arm quickly. Don’t hold back!” Lin Wan shouted desperately on the spectator stand!

Hearing this, Qi Yang was enraged!

He wanted to rush over and slap Lin Wan!

“You want to break my arm?” Qin Yu said with some amusement.

Cold sweat dripped down Qi Yang’s forehead. He hurriedly shook his head and said, “No... No, I absolutely have no such intention!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu sneered.

He raised his hand and smacked Qi Yang’s chest lightly.

“Bang!”

Qi Yang’s entire body was sent flying!

Waves of suffocatingly intense pain came from his ribs. It was difficult for him to even breathe!

The venue became completely silent.

Everyone watched this scene in a daze, as if they couldn’t believe that this was actually happening!

That palm... didn’t seem strong at all!

“How is this possible?!” Lincheng’s eyes widened and his expression was extremely ugly!

“Qi Yang!” Seeing this, Lin Wan hurriedly ran to the stage.

She supported Qi Yang and then cursed loudly, “Qin Yu, you’re really ruthless. You actually beat my Qi Yang into this state. Don’t you have any sense of shame?!”

Hearing Lin Wan’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel like laughing.

Lin Wan really had double standards.

On the spectator stand, Zheng Mingshuo laughed loudly and said, “Mr. Lin, it seems that the helper you invited isn’t impressive!”

Lincheng’s complexion was pale, and he was filled with regret!

If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have chased Qin Yu away!

Now, not only did he offend him, but his reputation was also ruined!

“Mr. Lin, your disciple can’t even stand up. I think there’s no need to compete anymore, right?” Zheng Mingshuo said with a nonchalant smile.

Although Lincheng was annoyed, there was no way out for him.

He braced himself, stood up and shouted, “This is a fake match! Zheng Mingshuo bribed Qi Yang in advance. That’s all!”

As soon as they heard this, the entire venue was in an uproar!

Everyone came to a sudden realization!

“No wonder, I was wondering. How could Qin Yu be Qi Yang’s opponent?!” Someone shouted from below the stage.

“That’s right! And Qin Yu’s punches look very weak. How could he send someone flying?”

“The Zheng Family Martial Arts School is really shameless!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“So that’s how it is! I knew it! How could Qi Yang lose?!” On the stage, Lin Wan couldn’t help but come to a realization.

After saying that, she slapped Qi Yang hard and said, “Qi Yang, you didn’t even tell me. You scared me!”

Qi Yang, who already had a broken rib, grimaced in pain after receiving Lin Wan’s slap!

He, wishing that he could beat this idiot to death, glared at Lin Wan fiercely!

“Qi Yang, what’s wrong with you? Why are you looking at me like that?” Lin Wan mumbled.

Qi Yang gritted his teeth and said, “It’s... It’s nothing.”

Seeing that the public opinion was one-sided, Lincheng couldn’t help but sneer.

“You want to fight with me? You’re no match for me,” Lincheng said indifferently.

Zheng Mingshuo’s expression turned ashen. He couldn’t help but grit his teeth and say, “Lincheng! You’re really shameless to the extreme!”

“Hahaha! This is called a tactic.” Lincheng didn’t feel ashamed. Instead, he felt proud.

“Zheng Mingshuo, so what if you won the competition? Your martial arts school still lost,” Lincheng said with some pride.

“You!” Zheng Mingshuo was furious, but he couldn’t do anything to Lincheng!

Lincheng stood up and said indifferently, “This farce should end. I’m sure everyone has seen the strength of the Zheng family’s dojo clearly. As for me, I won’t fool around with you guys anymore. Goodbye.”

After saying this, Lincheng turned around and left.

He was extremely proud of himself, and he was even more proud of his clever last-minute tactic.

“Hold on.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted from the stage.

Lin Cheng stopped in his tracks. He turned around and said with a nonchalant smile, “Do you have anything else?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Mr. Lin, since you said that Mr. Zheng bribed Qi Yang, how about this? You come, and we’ll fight.”
