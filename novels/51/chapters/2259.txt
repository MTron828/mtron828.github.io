2260 Charge into Azure Firmament Sect

However, if one were to sense it using the divine sense, one would discover that the black Qin Yu was actually showing a fearful expression and was completely suppressed by the golden Qin Yu.

The suicidal sword strike just now had already made him fearful, and in that moment of submission, the dominance over divine sense had been determined.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He finally solved this problem temporarily.

His continuous procrastination on this matter eventually led to significant consequences. This time, he had used a life-threatening blow. The Soul-hunting Bell had protected his soul, and that sword had allowed him to suppress the black Qin Yu. He had temporarily resolved the tremendous trouble of the Soul Torment Mind Technique. In the future, he could use the netherworld cultivation method without fear and would no longer be restricted.

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes and saw the anxious faces of a few people.

“I’m sorry for making you worried. I’ve just solved a big problem.”

Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Qin Yu, you seem to have changed,” Jue Wu suddenly said.

“It feels like there’s been a change in the soul. Previously, the soul didn’t give me any particular feeling, but now, it’s like a sharp sword, much more powerful. It’s a feeling different from the strength of divine sense.”

The man with the mustache frowned and said. He could not describe in words the specific feeling he felt.

“This might have been brought about after solving the netherworld cultivation method’s problem,” Qin Yu thought for a moment and explained to them.

“Qin Yu, please send me out. Next, I have to accomplish something here. It’s about time, so I won’t continue to travel with you. We will meet again when an opportunity arises.”

The man with the mustache hesitated a moment before speaking to Qin Yu.

“Alright!”

Qin Yu did not force the man with the mustache. The Sumeru energy wrapped around him and sent him out of the Sumeru ring.

“Qin Yu, I also want to go to purgatory to cultivate. I realized you’ve caught up with me. Brat, I’m not convinced!”

Jue Wu angrily said. No matter how much Qin Yu tried to persuade her to stay, she insisted on leaving.

“Jue Wu, take this Immortal Binding Rope with you.”

Qin Yu forcefully stuffed the Immortal Binding Rope to Jue Wu.

“Sigh.”

Jue Wu had a Nirvana Body. She had been enjoying eating and drinking, and her strength also increased rapidly. This was the first time she took the initiative to say she wanted to cultivate. She probably had been stimulated quite a bit coming here.

Elder Guai said meaningfully.

Qin Yu shook his head.

His body returned to the Fire Unicorn Continent.

“Qin Yu, you killed my master and the others?”

Piao Ruoyun’s voice came from the voice transmission jade slip.

“Why? You want to take revenge?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“I’m not a fool. It’s just that I’m too shocked. Your strength has actually improved so quickly in such a short time.”

Piao Ruoyun said after a long silence.

“Are you interested in taking over the Azure Firmament Sect? Of course, there is a price to pay.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“Any price is acceptable!”

Piao Ruoyun almost said without hesitation. In purgatory, being a sect master meant a vast amount of resources.

Although the Azure Firmament Sect had lost the strongest combat force, it still had enough resources for her to soar to the sky.

She sent Qin Yu the exact coordinates of the location.

This location was not far from the Fire Unicorn Continent. Qin Yu took out a warship from Ming Yue’s spatial ring and flew toward the coordinates.

Azure Firmament Sect was located in the Azure Ridge Continent. It took about three days to arrive with a warship from the Fire Unicorn Continent.

At this moment, Azure Firmament Sect was already in a mess. It had lost seven out of ten of its strongest combat forces, and all the disciples were panicked.

Some powerful people of the sect had already begun to snatch all kinds of resources.

Some rogue cultivators outside the sect also had their eyes on the various resources of the Azure Firmament Sect.

Qin Yu landed in front of the Azure Firmament Sect on the Azure Ridge Continent and stepped inside.

The sect protection formation suddenly activated, and in an instant, the place where Qin Yu stood was full of ghostly wailing and mournful howls. Countless illusions flickered before Qin Yu’s eyes, and multiple murderous intent lurked behind those illusions.

It was waiting for Qin Yu to reveal a flaw and kill him in one strike.

Qin Yu’s foot landed, and a massive fire column shot straight into the formation core of, breaking the sect protection formation.

He landed directly in the elders’ hall, and five elders arguing aggressively immediately fell silent.

“Kid, who are you? How did you come in?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

A middle-aged woman’s eye expression turned cold. She moved her hand slightly and prepared to kill Qin Yu.

“I am the one who killed your sect master.”

Qin Yu straightaway threw Ming Yue’s ring on the ground and went straight to the point.

“What do you want?”

A few of them trembled. Their eyes immediately revealed grief upon seeing the ring.

“Take over the Azure Firmament Sect. I want you, a few elders, to control all the resources as soon as possible, or you will die!”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“I’d like to see what a fourth grade like you can do. You’re in my Azure Firmament Sect! Do you really think that there’s no one else in my Azure Firmament Sect?”

“Stop!”

One of the elders shouted.

However, the person who spoke had already suddenly made a move. His sword pierced Qin Yu’s heart like lightning.

However, the sword broke directly.

The sound of the broken sword falling to the ground shook the hearts of these few people.

He used his body to block the sword! Moreover, Qin Yu’s body did not even have any spiritual energy fluctuation just now. He relied on his physical strength to resist an elder’s full-powered sword attack!

“I’ll give you a chance to attack with all your might.”

Qin Yu sat on the Palace Master’s seat and watched a few of them.

The elders looked at each other and nodded silently.

The five people’s internal qi straightaway raised to the extreme, and surging spiritual energy overflowed. Then the few of them condensed their full strength and ruthlessly bombarded Qin Yu’s body.

The one whose soul was strong turned his divine sense into a silver needle and ruthlessly pierced into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Intense spiritual energy directly hit Qin Yu’s body, but he did not even move. The silver needle that entered his sea of consciousness disappeared without a trace.

“Do you still want to attack?”

Qin Yu patted his clothes and stood up.

The five of them turned pale. The gap was too big; no wonder he could kill Ming Yue and the others.

“No matter how powerful you are, I will not submit to you. The hatred of killing the sect master is irreconcilable. I will avenge one day.”

An elderly woman said with a vicious expression.

“Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at by others for bullying us with your strength?” another person said coldly.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu directly slapped the elderly woman into powder and did not say anything else.

“Have I given you due respect?”

Qin Yu said coldly.
