2146 Yan Ruoxue Makes Her Move

Yan Ruoxue looked at the two without the slightest intention of retreating. Instead, her battle intent grew stronger.

The two linen-robed elderly men frowned even more. Yan Ruoxue’s identity was extraordinary. If they hurt her, the Yan family would be furious. At that time, it would not be so easy to make peace.

However, it would be completely unacceptable for them to let Qin Yu go just like that.

“Saintess Yan, capturing Qin Yu is the will of the Yan family’s Holy Lord, Yan Tianshi.” An elderly man mentioned Yan Tianshi in an attempt to intimidate Yan Ruoxue.

However, in Yan Ruoxue’s eyes, nothing was more important than Qin Yu.

She said coldly, “No matter whose will, I won’t let you touch Qin Yu at all today!”

“Saintess Yan, do you mean it?” a linen-robed elderly man shouted.

Yan Ruoxue’s body was surging with a terrifying internal qi as she said, “Stop talking nonsense. If you want to attack Qin Yu, step over my body!”

“Then we’ll have to offend you. We can only ask Holy Lord Yan for forgiveness later!” that linen-robed elderly man shouted.

“Hold on…” Just then, Qin Yu stood up with difficulty.

He stood before Yan Ruoxue and forced a smile. “Ruoxue, shouldn’t we prepare for the worst…”

Yan Ruoxue was stunned. She looked at Qin Yu but could not answer his question. She knew very well that if they could not open the gate to Astral Mountain, they would be at a dead end. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, at this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have seen through life and death. He slowly raised his hand and stroked Yan Ruoxue’s cheek. He said softly, “Yan Ruoxue, if I die, you must live on.”

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes were teary as she listened to Qin Yu’s words. She bit her lower lip and did not cry out.

“No, I don’t want.” Yan Ruoxue hugged Qin Yu tightly and gritted her teeth. “If you die, I won’t live either.”

However, at this moment, Qin Yu no longer had the strength to say anything. He closed his eyes. His physical strength and spiritual power were almost exhausted, and he was already beginning to feel dizzy.

Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu and felt her heart aching. She knew that Qin Yu’s current state had already reached the edge of extreme danger.

“No matter what… I won’t let anyone touch you!”

Yan Ruoxue glanced at them, turned around, and returned to Qin Yu’s side. She reached out to support him.

Determination filled her cold eyes. She knew that this time, she could not let Qin Yu fall into their hands no matter what.

“Ruoxue…” Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue’s determined gaze and was deeply moved.

He knew their current situation was tremendously dangerous. To protect him, Yan Ruoxue stood up for him without caring about anything. This determination made him feel warm.

“Don’t talk. Save your strength,” Yan Ruoxue said in a low voice. Her eyes were filled with determination. “I won’t let them hurt you.”

Qin Yu nodded and looked at Yan Ruoxue deeply. Then, he sat down and began to adjust his state of mind.

The two linen-robed elderly men did not attack immediately. They seemed to be considering something.

They knew that they had to be careful when dealing with Yan Ruoxue because Yan Ruoxue’s status was not something they could compare to.

“Try not to hurt her,” an elderly man said.

The other elderly man nodded and narrowed his eyes. He raised both his hands and a terrifying internal qi instantly spread out. Clearly, they were prepared to attack with all their might.

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes flashed with a resolute light. She knew that no matter what happened next, she could not retreat. No matter what, she had to protect Qin Yu.

“Saintess Yan, I’m sorry!” the elderly man roared and raised his hand, sending out a terrifying mark!

The elderly man slowly raised his palm, like the heaviest hammer in the world, causing the surrounding air to stagnate. Then he pressed down hard, and the air seemed to freeze. It was as if the entire world had frozen because of this action. A terrifying mark emerged from his palm. Some patterns looked like real dragons were on them. Spiritual energy surged and tore through the void.

This mark was like a storm filled with destructive power that rushed straight at Yan Ruoxue. In the face of this unprecedented power, Yan Ruoxue had no intention of retreating.

She slowly raised her head. Her eyes flickered with a resolute and determined light as if they had condensed into something tangible, making people dare not look straight at her. Then she slowly raised her hand, and the internal qi around her instantly erupted.

The internal qi around Yan Ruoxue seemed to have transformed into a solemn goddess at this moment. Her expression was dignified and bearing unmatched. Her aura was unparalleled. That cold and determined gaze made people feel fear.

In that instant, everyone’s gaze was attracted to her, and everyone was shocked. The two linen-robed elderly men revealed bewildered expressions. This strength, this aura, was simply beyond their imagination. Yan Ruoxue’s strength was actually so formidable.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly raised her hand. A ray of light burst out from her palm like a sun rising. This light was filled with endless power. It seemed to contain the most powerful power in the world as it rushed straight toward the menacing mark.

In an instant, the world seemed to be torn apart by these two forces. The powerful collision made everyone not able to look directly at it. A terrifying energy shockwave spread in the air. Even people dozens of meters away could clearly feel the powerful airwave.

“As expected of the Yan family’s saintess,” an elderly man said coldly.

“Unfortunately, we are both True Saints. Even if we don’t want to hurt you, you’re not our match,” another elderly man added.

Yan Ruoxue’s face was as cold as ice. The internal qi around her instantly erupted. The words of the two linen-robed elderly men were obviously meant to make her lower her guard so that they could find an opportunity to attack her. However, Yan Ruoxue was not fooled by their flowery words.

A terrifying internal qi erupted from the two linen-robed elderly men at the same time. They suddenly clapped their palms, and the air seemed to be compressed by their palms. A binding technique immediately rushed toward Yan Ruoxue.

However, Yan Ruoxue did not show any fear.

She looked coldly at the linen-robed elderly men, and an indescribable power instantly surged.

It was the Yan family’s secret technique, the Snow Spirit Divine Technique! It was a magical power that could resist any restraint. Behind Yan Ruoxue, snowflakes were rolling. These snowflakes seemed to be condensed from the void, and each was filled with powerful spiritual energy.
