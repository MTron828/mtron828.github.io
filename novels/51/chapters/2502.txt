2503 The Monster Race Overlord

“Who is this little guy? Why haven’t I heard of him before?”

Moreover, regardless of what it was, whether it was the supreme treasure of the ghost race or stopping the monster race from offering sacrifices, they were all earth-shattering events.

Previously, this kid seemed to have interfered with the monster race’s offering sacrifices of nearly a billion living beings in the Solitary Shadow Continent. According to the Fallen Godly King, he seemed to have stopped the eight-winged monster race from advancing.

A monk from the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect said softly, “This person killed a member of my Ten Thousand Buddha Sect. No matter what, he has to settle this matter.”

With a thought, the demonic flames on the Fallen Godly King’s body ignited.

As the body moved, the entire space seemed to tremble slightly.

One could hear He Teng’s feet stepping in the space everywhere, and his afterimages filled the space.

It was the utmost explosive power of the physical body. This explosive power could crush most of the Tribulation Fifth Level cultivators that Qin Yu knew.

“What a terrifying physical strength! Is this the Fallen Godly King of the monster realm? This power has completely broken through the Rules of Heaven and Earth. I wonder how this Fallen Godly King was created.”

Yan Wenxuan of the Heavenly Divination Sect also revealed a solemn expression.

“Little guy, you have to deal with it yourself. The eight-winged monster race army has locked onto me.”

The little loli ceased her playful laughter.

As He Teng made his move, the battle that had been brewing for a long time erupted in an instant.

“Qin Yu! Go to hell!”

A giant demonic hand shook the sky and earth, pressing on Qin Yu directly.

No one could react in time to this kind of attack after the body changed positions.

Almost all the people who had reached the fourth level were locked onto by He Teng.

It included Flower Granny, Lei Xin, the alliance forces, and even the four sects and four schools. In an instant, many top-notch martial artists of the alien race were in the surroundings.

Singularity Space!

The space unfolded abruptly like a deck of cards, and countless layers of space appeared one after another.

In just an instant, the space completely shattered.

“Qin Yu! Hand over my demonic hand! Otherwise, you’ll die!”

Qin Yu’s bones cracked under the immense force as He Teng screamed.

In the Solitary Shadow Continent, everyone worked together to cut off an arm of He Teng, who had just advanced.

This arm was his original power and was directly modified by the monster race’s Path of Heaven. It somehow had affected a portion of He Teng’s strength.

“Come and get it yourself if you want it!”

Evil Eye in Qin Yu’s hand suddenly started to burn, and its soul power entered his soul.

In an instant, he comprehended the sea of destruction.

With the support of the Heavenly Profound Power, he could almost directly use the fourth-level power of destruction.

He raised Evil Eye in his hand and stabbed it into the ground.

In an instant, Evil Eye’s power filled the entire ground.

The ground surged high like a balloon and then exploded like a tsunami.

The entire ground began to churn violently. It was like a towering wave that was lifted. The heaven and earth instantly inverted, and the endless dust seemed to swallow the sky.

“Boom!”

The power of the dusk’s downfall erupted with Qin Yu at the center.

The terrifying power directly repelled the demonic hand, and countless demonic qi instantly evaporated.

That power left a deep wound on He Teng’s hand.

He Teng looked furious but did not attack again.

This time, he had attacked with all his might to capture Qin Yu.

It would be very difficult to continue if this attack failed.

Qin Yu’s body turned cold.

If he did not obtain Teng Zixu’s Heavenly Profound Power this time and thus could not borrow more profound power regardless of the power of the Breath of Yellow Springs or the power of the Path of Heaven of the Way of Destruction, the kingdom of dusk could not block He Teng’s attack.

The power of this attack attracted the attention of countless people.

This power could block the power of the monster race’s number one Godly King and thus naturally could not be underestimated.

The little loli jumped up with her short legs and patted Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu felt a little helpless but dared to pull the little loli’s hand away when he saw the expressions of Lei Xin and the others.

Si Liuhe, Yan Tianshi, and the others also stared at Qin Yu with complicated expressions, especially Yan Tianshi.

He had always felt that Qin Yu was not worthy of Yan Ruoxue. At this moment, he finally had to admit that this fellow was a dazzling pearl even among the human race.

If he were to face the kingdom of dusk, he might not be able to take it.

“Looks like there are still quite some experts among the human race that have not been exterminated.”

A muffled voice sounded. The voice came from the heavy armor and gave off an extremely oppressive feeling.

The monster race general took off the armor from his head, and his sharp eyes seemed to be able to pierce through the sky.

The monster race general’s body emanated a thick and dark atmosphere at this point. His skin might have been pale or gray, and that power gave people an immensely ominous and evil feeling.

He had high cheekbones, a rough jaw, and a well-defined facial profile.

If it weren’t for the fangs at the corner of his mouth and the hard scales on his exposed skin, he looked no different from a human at first glance.

His arm raised the halberd in his hand high. In an instant, the demonic clouds of heaven and earth gathered above his head, and the entire Holy Region became gloomy in an instant.

Layers of demonic clouds even blocked the light of the sun. In an instant, night fell.

As he swung his halberd, terrifying demonic clouds gathered at the tip of his halberd. With the simplest and most direct explosive power, he directly attacked the little loli.

“Overlord! Xiang Yu!”

The 5,000 monster race army shouted almost simultaneously and stretched their halberds almost concurrently.

All the dark energy gathered in an instant and connected strangely. It followed the monster race general’s halberd and swung out in the end.

Wherever that power reached, it turned into the power of nothingness.

“The space is completely sealed by this power. I can’t use the spatial power!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

For the first time, Yan Ruoxue revealed a panicked expression. She had wanted to move everyone away from this power.

However, she realized that under the influence of this enormous force, even the power of the Path of Heaven could not enter this force field.

“What terrifying power! That monster race general was originally at the Tribulation Fifth Level. However, with the combined strength of these 5,000 monster race army, he seemed to have broken through to the utmost.”

Lei Xin said in shock.

The little loli stepped forward and arrived before everyone with a calm expression.

After that, she suddenly grabbed the halberd with her chubby hand. A terrifying power raged out, and in an instant, a violent wind blew across the heaven and earth.
