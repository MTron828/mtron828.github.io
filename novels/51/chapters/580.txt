Chapter 581: I Don’t Care Who You Are Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Although this old man was quite old, he was very imposing.

Even though one couldn’t see his strength clearly, he still gave off a sense of oppression.

“Qin Yu? Why are you here?” Xia Hang frowned tightly.

Shouldn’t Qin Yu be chased by Yan Guiyi at this time?

Even if he wasn’t killed, he shouldn’t be so calm!

Qin Yu sneered. “Why, are you surprised that I’m here? Are you wondering why Yan Guiyi didn’t kill me?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia Hang frowned even more deeply!

Could it be that even Yan Guiyi was defeated by Qin Yu?!

“You are Qin Yu?”

At this time, the old man beside Xia Hang opened his mouth.

His sharp eyes looked coldly at Qin Yu.

“I am, and which old b*stard are you?” Qin Yu asked bluntly.

Although Qin Yu didn’t know who this old man was, since he and Xia Hang got out of the same car, he was definitely not a good person. He was most likely someone from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“What did you call me?! Do you know who I am?!” A trace of anger flashed across the old man’s face.

“What, are you so old that you’re deaf?” Qin Yu sneered.

“I called you an old b*stard. You got a problem with that?”

A trace of coldness appeared on the old man’s face. He narrowed his eyes and said, “How ignorant and bold.”

“Qin Yu! This is the president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!” Xia Hang said angrily.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “Oh, you are the leader of those b*stards? I happen to have something to say to you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked toward the old man step by step.

Then, Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said word by word, “B*stard, you are the one who had Yan Ruoxue captured, right? F *ck you!”

“You better pray that you can kill me soon. Otherwise, I will definitely pull out your tendons and skin you!”

These few words made the old man’s expression turn extremely cold!

A terrifying internal qi burst out from his body. This internal qi carried a strong sense of oppression!

Qin Yu didn’t panic at all. He sneered and said, “What, old b*stard, you want to make a move? Remember where we are. If you have the ability, go ahead and try.”

It was very obvious that Qin Yu had made the right bet.

At the entrance of the venue, even if this old man was angry, he could only endure it!

“You don’t dare to make a move? Then I will.” Qin Yu sneered.

After saying that, Qin Yu slapped the old man’s face!

This slap was unexpected, and even the Pavilion Master was stunned.

No one had expected that Qin Yu would actually dare to slap the president’s mouth!

That president was so angry that his entire body was trembling! He angrily said, “Brat, you really deserve to die!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “The same goes for you. This slap is just interest. If Ruoxue suffers, I will make you pay back ten times or a hundred times!”

The old man gritted his teeth. He snorted coldly, then flicked his sleeves and left.

After they entered the venue, the Pavilion Master finally couldn’t help but laugh.

“Qin Yu, you’re so bold.” The Pavilion Master couldn’t help but laugh.

“That person’s name is Qu Xie. He is the honorary president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and has an extraordinary status. Even the major aristocratic families have to show him respect.”

Qin Yu sneered. “I don’t care who he is.”

The Pavilion Master helplessly shook her head and said, “This person is extremely powerful. You’d better be careful.”

“Since there are so many of them, I’m not afraid anymore.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Moreover, in my heart, he has already been sentenced to death.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything more.

“Let’s go in,” said the Pavilion Master.

Qin Yu followed behind the Pavilion Master and entered the venue.

The venue wasn’t big, but it was filled with the ambiance of the authorities.

After the Pavilion Master entered, she greeted everyone.

Qin Yu didn’t know these people, so he casually found a place to sit down.

A few minutes later, the Pavilion Master walked to Qin Yu’s side and sat down.

“These people are all powerful. Try not to provoke anyone,” the Pavilion Master reminded.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I know what to do.”

More and more people walked into the venue. At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly saw a familiar figure.

It was the War God of the Military District, Ye Qing!

His figure was tall and upright. His appearance was full of vigor. The moment he entered, countless people stood up and greeted him.

Ye Qing nodded slightly, but no expression could be seen on his face.

Qin Yu also waved his hand and shouted, “Mr. Ye, we meet again.”

Ye Qing turned around and looked at Qin Yu.

A trace of surprise flashed across his face. Then, he walked to Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, why are you here?” Ye Qing asked in puzzlement.

“I brought him here,” the Pavilion Master said with a smile.

Ye Qing suddenly understood. He looked at the Pavilion Master and said with a smile, “Ji Yuhong, it must be because of you that Qin Yu was able to improve so fast, right?”

However, the Pavilion Master said with a smile, “This child is very hard-working. The only reason he can get to where he is today is because of himself.”

Ye Qing couldn’t help but burst into laughter. Then, he patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “I have high hopes for you.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Thank you for your praise.”

After Ye Qing left, Qin Yu looked at the Pavilion Master and said, “Pavilion Master, do you know Ye Qing?”

“Yes, we have crossed paths a few times,” said the Pavilion Master.

At this time, a question flashed through Qin Yu’s mind.

He smiled and said, “Pavilion Master, who do you think is more powerful between Ye Qing and Jiang He?”

The Pavilion Master shook his head and said, “It seems that the two of them have never crossed paths before. I can only say that... the two of them aren’t the same kind of people, and they have chosen different paths.”

“Ye Qing is the talented type, while Jiang He is more hardworking.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said in a low voice, “I can see that Jiang He is a pure martial artist.”

“Qin Yu, you have the strengths of the two of them,” the Pavilion Master said with a smile.

“Pavilion Master, you flatter me.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Although Qin Yu had already stepped into the Martial Marquis realm, there was still a big gap between him and Ye Qing, and Jiang He.

At this moment, a man wearing a tunic suit walked out from backstage.

This man looked to be in his fifties. He had glasses on and he looked refined.

Although his expression was warm, his imposing aura intimidated people!

Even though he didn’t have the internal qi of a martial artist, he still made people feel great pressure.

As soon as this person appeared, everyone present stood up in unison.

“Greetings, Mr. Zhou,” everyone said.

Mr. Zhou smiled and waved his hand, saying, “Everyone, please take a seat. There’s no need for such formalities.”

When everyone heard this, they all sat down.

The Pavilion Master glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Zhou might be the person with the highest status you’ve seen so far.”
