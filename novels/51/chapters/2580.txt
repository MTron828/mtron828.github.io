Chapter 2581: The Dao Lecture

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“The Dao Mystical Saint had gathered 81 hearts before this Saint Kingdom became the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. Do you understand?” The young man smiled somewhat wretchedly and said.

“Now that the Dao Mystical soul has been destroyed, the Saint’s heart shattered, and that’s why this eternal night appeared in the Saint Kingdom. It’s strange indeed. Who could annihilate the Dao Mystical soul? Even a deity would have to make considerable effort.”

The young man murmured, but what he said shocked Qin Yu greatly.

This young man, with a very wretched appearance, seemed to know many things in depth.

“Village Chief, are you a native here? How is your current strength?” Qin Yu asked curiously.

The village chief glanced at Qin Yu but did not answer his question.

He looked at the sky and stretched. He looked at the vacant space and said lazily.

“It’s almost time for the dao lecture. Since you’ve helped the villagers of our village today, come and listen to my dao lecture.”

He ignored Qin Yu and walked straight to the vacant space. He then sat down on a stone street.

“Hong Da.”

The village chief said lazily.

“Yes, Village Chief. Recently, the number of the flames of the Confused Consciousness that appeared in the Spirit Transformation Pool seems to be increasing. I just happened to capture a lot of them.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Dao lecture? The flame of Confused Consciousness?”

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment. These were all things that he did not understand at the moment.

He found himself a space and sat down. At this moment, the old man, Hong Da, had cleaned up the thick and sticky blood on the ground.

Although he could still smell blood faintly, it was still bearable.

From his observation earlier, he could roughly understand that regardless of the old man, the village chief, or the boy, they were all living beings in this world. They would follow a specific trajectory in things they did.

Outsiders like them could also obtain some benefits through them.

Just like previously, he could gain a preliminary understanding of the situation in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom by enquiring some matters from the village chief. This was also what Qin Yu urgently needed now.

Taking advantage of this gap, Qin Yu used all the power accumulated to strengthen his feet.

If he had been faster in today’s battle, with the power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he would not have been killed by Dark Heart.

This also made him wary. The outsiders were definitely the top people chosen from the various races.

Including the three who had acted decisively in this village, they had already discovered some sort of order and condensed the initial stage of the scab monster body.

Dark Heart had retreated at first, but after noticing his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze was closing, he made a decisive move.

It proved that the three people he saw were definitely the top geniuses of the monster race.

Without the good luck that Chen Shuang had bestowed upon him, he would have already lost the qualifications to contend for this Saint Kingdom.

As his thoughts were directed, the energy in the air flowed into his legs.

Qin Yu instantly felt some changes in the fundamentals of the cells of his legs.

His muscles became more solid, and his legs felt full of energy.

He sensed that after absorbing the Saint power of the three souls, his speed was 50% faster than before.

“What a fast condensing speed! From my mind to the transformation of my legs, it only took me a second.”

Qin Yu felt it was a little unreal. In the human world, whether it was the tempering of the physical body or the soul, one had to take a long time.

Even if it was an elixir, herb, or treasure, it would take some time to condense. It would not transform in an instant. “Coo, coo, coo! Hurry up and run this way!”

Suddenly, Qin Yu’s thoughts were interrupted by a burst of noisy voices.

In front of Hong Da, there were fifty or so balls of fire of different sizes. These balls of fire seemed to be alive and bumped around.

But when they wanted to leave, they would always be precisely whipped by Hong Da’s whip and then driven back.

These balls of fire let out all sorts of different cries.

Some let out human-like roars, while others let out bleating sounds.

A voice that sounded like a butterfly that could destroy the world came from a throat. A middle-aged woman with the body of a sow was wriggling on the ground.

Various strange sounds instantly made the place noisy. The quiet village suddenly became like a market.

“Village Chief, everyone is here!”

“Hmm.”

The village chief raked through his greasy hair, looking like a person of high moral and intellectual attainment.

“Everyone, quiet please. The village chief is about to begin his dao lecture.” As he spoke, Qin Yu suddenly felt a sense of oppression.

The village chief suddenly burst into a flashy martial arts dance, and his mouth emitted strange and vibrant noises.

At this moment, Qin Yu did not smile at all.

He felt that as the village chief started dancing, the air in the surroundings changed slightly. It seemed to be the power of technique.

The power of techniques could indeed be used in this Saint Kingdom, but he had to find the right way!

Qin Yu’s heart beat violently. He activated the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze again.

He observed the fluctuations of the expanse of this heaven and earth but could not find any traces even after the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze exhausted its strength.

“How did he use this kind of power! ”

Qin Yu was a little frustrated. He could not figure out the rules of this Saint Kingdom at all.

As the village chief’s crotch moved, he took out a green hat from somewhere and put it on his head. The flames of the Confused Consciousness surrounding the village chief began to quieten down.

The balls of fire began to wriggle, absorbing the holy energy in the air and changing into different shapes.

There were people with bodies completely round like spheres. There were also those with limbs and arms.

Most of them had transformed into humanoid forms but with somewhat peculiar proportions.

“Village Chief, my buttock is so big that it’s difficult to walk. Can you shrink it a little and add it to my legs?”

A fat middle-aged woman said loudly. The proportion of her buttocks was a little exaggerated.

“This is the Way of Nature, the aesthetic of nature. What does a widow like you know? Follow the village chief’s decision. You won’t go wrong!” The village chief placed his hands behind his back and said sternly.

“Village Chief, I want to condense two more hands, but I don’t have enough strength. Can I not have my head?”

“Village Chief! Village Chief!”

“It’s so noisy! Village Chief is going to sleep. Hong Da, you will continue the lecture!”

Surrounded by a group of people, the village chief had a headache.

He raised his head high as he emerged from the crowd.

At this moment, when Qin Yu saw the scene of the dao lecture, he could not help but be stunned even though he thought he had seen a lot.

Was this how these villagers came about? No wonder Hong Yu could calmly clean up the scene after witnessing the incomparably cruel methods of these demonic cultivators.

The old man and Hong Yu were surrounded by a few kids laughing and pulling his beard.

A villager with four hands but without a head was walking quickly on the

ground like a crab..
