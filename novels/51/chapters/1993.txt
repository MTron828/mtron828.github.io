1994 The Strive of the Great Era

“Don’t play dumb, Saintess Gu. Who else could it be other than Qin Yu?” Yao Xi smiled and said.

Saintess Gu covered her mouth and chuckled. She shook her head and said, “Holy Son Yao, you’ve misunderstood me. The relationship between Qin Yu and me is only working together in partnership.”

“Partnership?” Yao Xi raised his eyebrow. “If it weren’t for his outstanding abilities, would you have become a partner to a rogue cultivator?”

Saintess Gu shook her head without comment.

“But as far as I know, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue have a special relationship,” Yao Xi continued. “If Saintess Gu has any other thoughts, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed.”

“Holy Son Yao, you’re overthinking.” Saintess Gu still shook her head.

Seeing this, Yao Xi didn’t continue to nag her.

He laughed and said, “Whenever the Golden Age descends, there will be one or two powerful rogue cultivators. They either become the most amazing people in history or die early and become the stepping stones for others.

“Counting from the past, very few can achieve great success.”

Saintess Gu didn’t refute him. She smiled and said, “But in history, how many of those who stepped into the Immortal Emperor cultivation realm didn’t experience countless tribulations?”

“It’s just a handful, not worth using as a reference,” Yao Xi said.

“One is enough. Don’t forget the first person who almost made the royal family disappear was the Demon Emperor,” Saintess Gu said.

At the mention of the Demon Emperor, Yao Xi fell silent. After a long time, he sighed with emotion and said, “The Demon Emperor is the most powerful Immortal Emperor in history, right?”

“Not necessarily. Yan Tianming of the Yan family is not bad either,” Saintess Gu said.

Yao Xi laughed and said, “The question of who is stronger between the Demon Emperor and Immortal Emperor Tianming has been debated for many years. It’s a pity they don’t live in the same era, so no one knows who is stronger. What a pity.”

“When the Demon Emperor was born, it wasn’t a Golden Age,” Saintess Gu said slowly.

“So, Saintess Gu is biased toward the Demon Emperor?” Yao Xi asked in surprise.

“No, I’m just saying the Demon Emperor’s conditions are much harsher,” Saintess Gu said indifferently.

Yao Xi sneered and said, “Back then, Immortal Emperor Tianming resisted several existences no weaker than Immortal Emperors and even killed them all by himself. Such a battle record is unprecedented. He’s the only one who has ever achieved this.”

After hearing Yao Xi’s words, Saintess Gu said with a vague smile, “Perhaps in another hundred or thousand years, the Holy Region will no longer be composed of the nine great aristocratic families but ten.”

Yao Xi’s mouth fell open, but he quickly guessed the meaning behind Saintess Gu’s words.

Then Yao Xi couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Saintess Gu is comparing Qin Yu to Immortal Emperor Tianming. Isn’t it overestimating him?” Yao Xi kept shaking his head.

“In the entire history, there has only been one Yan Tianming. What ground does Qin Yu base on?”

Saintess Gu didn’t dwell on this issue with Yao Xi. Instead, she changed the subject. “I’m afraid Qin Yu will be hunted down continuously.”

“That’s right. No one would want a rogue cultivator to grow up,” Yao Xi sighed and said.

“If he can withstand the pursuit of the nine great aristocratic families, who can stop his rise in the future?” Saintess Gu laughed and said.

Everything was as the two had predicted. After this battle, Qin Yu and Jue Wu’s situation became even more dangerous.

Almost all of the nine great aristocratic families were discussing this matter. They definitely did not want people like Qin Yu and Jue Wu to rise in the Golden Age.

In the Si family, Si Shifeng didn’t speak for a long time when he heard the news.

By the side, First Elder’s face was livid. Although the Si family had many Semi-Saints, they were reluctant to bear the loss of two Semi-Saints in one go.

“He could kill the Semi-Saint at the middle stage of Reversion Void. If he steps into the True Saint cultivation realm, no one in the world can stop him!” First Elder said coldly.

“With his current strength, he’s considered a top-notch existence even in the entire Holy Region. No one has the confidence to defeat him,” Si Shifeng also said in a low voice.

First Elder squinted his eyes and didn’t say a thing.

After a while, First Elder said in a low voice, “The nine great aristocratic families probably will meet again soon.”

The impact of this matter was far beyond imagination. As the nine great aristocratic families with vested interests, they would absolutely be reluctant to let a rogue cultivator snatch their resources.

Not to mention that more experts had emerged nowadays, such as the mysterious demon race who had walked out from the depths of the Azure Rock Forest, and now Qin Yu and Jue Wu.

The strength of these people was not weaker than that of the Holy Sons of the aristocratic families.

Soon, Holy Region sent out a message.

“After 300 years, the nine great aristocratic families will be meeting again. This meeting is called ‘The Strive of the Great Era’.”

As soon as the news came out, the entire Holy Region was shocked, and everyone started to discuss it.

“‘The Strive of the Great Era’? It sounds so nice, but in fact, aren’t they just being afraid?”

“I’m not afraid, but I just don’t want any untoward incident to happen.”

“In the Golden Age, it’s common to reshuffle the structure. The nine great aristocratic families have also experienced many impacts but have survived them all.”

“That’s because no Immortal Emperor was born. If an immortal Emperor were to appear, the nine great aristocratic families would probably have disappeared.”

Soon, the time was fixed. It would be three days later.

The location of their meeting was even more intriguing. It was in Sky City, where all nine great aristcratic families would send people over to discuss “important matters” in the Imperial Palace.

The prince, who received the news, felt a strong sense of uneasiness in his heart. Qin Yu had a similar feeling.

In the room, Jue Wu was still studying her demonic egg.

She had tried numerous methods, but still couldn’t hatch the demonic egg.

Apart from the ancient internal qi that it was emitting, there was nothing unusual about this demonic egg. It was no different from a huge stone.

“Strange! Why doesn’t this thing have any reaction?” Jue Wu frowned, and her little head was full of doubts.

“It probably will only be hatched under specific conditions,” Qin Yu said after taking a look.

“What specific conditions?” Jue Wu was puzzled.

...

“I have no idea,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

As they were talking, there was a knock on the door.

It was none other than the prince.

He walked into Qin Yu’s and Jue Wu’s room with a solemn look.

“Your Highness,” Qin Yu stood up and greeted him.

The prince waved his hand and said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, have you heard the news about ‘The Strive of Great Era’?”

“Yes, I’ve heard of it,” Qin Yu said.

“I’m afraid it will be a disaster,” the prince went straight to the point.

“Why did you say so?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

The prince sighed and said, “They have long wanted to remove Sky City’s special status. It’s just that they have never found the right opportunity. This time, they set the venue of the meeting in Sky City. What does this mean?”
