Chapter 63: Lin Wan Gets Served Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Ruoxue’s expression was a little cold, and her powerful aura instantly intimidated Lin Wan.

Lin Wan, who had always been fearless, was actually unable to speak at this moment.

“What does it have to do with you?!” Lin Wan braced herself and said.

Yan Ruoxue looked coldly at Lin Wan and said, “You said he’s a b*stard?”

“That’s right, he’s a b*stard!” Lin Wan snorted and said.

However, just as Lin Wan finished speaking, a clear palm print appeared on her face.

Yan Ruoxue raised her hand and slapped Lin Wan’s face!

Lin Wan covered her face and was stunned for a moment.

In all her life, no one had ever hit her!

“You... you actually dared to hit me?” Lin Wan widened her eyes and shouted in shock.

Yan Ruoxue said in an icy tone of voice, “If you dare to talk nonsense again, I will tear your mouth apart and make you unable to speak forever.”

“You... I’m gonna beat you black and blue!” Lin Wan pounced towards Yan Ruoxue.

Unfortunately, Lin Wan had just raised her hand when she received another slap from Yan Ruoxue.

The two consecutive slaps had stupefied Lin Wan, and her eyes were brimming with tears.

“You’re dead meat. I won’t let you off the hook!” Lin Wan said through gritted teeth.

Then, Lin Wan looked at Qi Yang and said angrily, “Qi Yang, quickly call your friends out and chase them out!”

Qi Yang coughed and braced himself to walk forward.

“How can you hit people? The boss here is my friend!” Qi Yang tried his best to maintain an arrogant attitude.

At this moment, Qin Yu took a step forward and said with a smile, “Miss Yan, leave this person to me.”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t refuse and nodded in agreement.

However, Qi Yang was frightened by this address.

Miss Yan? There weren’t many people with the surname Yan in the entire Jiangcheng!

Coupled with her powerful aura and the fact that she was standing beside Qin Yu...

Could it be that she was Yan Ruoxue from Jingdu?

When he thought of this, Qi Yang’s expression immediately changed!

He immediately changed his expression and said with a smile, “Gee, it’s all a misunderstanding. Qin Yu, this is Lin Wan’s fault. I will definitely teach her a good lesson!”

This caused Qin Yu, who was about to make a move, to freeze for a moment.

Why did Qi Yang, who was arrogant just a moment ago, change his expression in the blink of an eye?

“Qi Yang, what are you talking about?!” Lin Wan said angrily.

Qi Yang tugged Lin Wan and apologized, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. We’ll leave now...”

After saying that, Qi Yang dragged Lin Wan to the side.

After walking far away, Lin Wan said angrily, “What do you mean?! That woman slapped me twice and you’re still apologizing to them?”

Qi Yang suppressed his anger and said, “Do you know who that woman is? If you provoke her, your family will be dead meat!”

“I don’t give a hoot about who she is. She has to pay the price for hitting me!” Lin Wan said with a bit of viciousness.

Qi Yang impatiently waved his hand and said, “If you want to dig your own grave, then do it yourself. Don’t implicate me!”

After saying that, Qi Yang directly walked to the side.

At the banquet venue, Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu sat down.

“Do you want to dance together?” Yan Ruoxue asked with a smile.

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, “No, no, no. I don’t know how to dance, and I don’t like it either.”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t insist and said with a smile, “Alright then. I’ll introduce you to a friend later.”

More than ten minutes later, a middle-aged man in a suit and leather shoes hurried over.

“Miss Yan, I’m really sorry. I was delayed by something at home,” the middle-aged man said while wiping his sweat.

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “Mr. Wei, you don’t have to be so polite. Please take a seat.”

The man called Mr. Wei hurriedly nodded and sat down.

Then, Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “Let me introduce you. This is Chuzhou’s bank manager, Wei Jiang.”

After saying that, Yan Ruoxue looked at Qin Yu and said, “This is Qin Yu.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Wei Jiang quickly stood up and shook hands with Qin Yu warmly.

“Mr. Qin, you’ve been quite famous recently. Your name has taken Chuzhou by storm,” Wei Jiang said with a polite smile.

Qin Yu knew that Wei Jiang was just being polite, so he quickly said, “Thank you, Mr. Wei.”

“Mr. Wei, is your wife okay?” At this time, Yan Ruoxue suddenly asked.

Wei Jiang sighed and said, “The situation isn’t optimistic. I just hired a famous doctor from abroad, and it was because of this matter that I was delayed.”

Yan Ruoxue smiled as she looked at Qin Yu and said, “It just so happens that Mr. Qin is also a doctor. He may be able to help you.”

Wei Jiang looked at Qin Yu and pretended to be surprised. “Mr. Qin is a Chinese doctor?”

“Er... sort of.” In fact, Qin Yu didn’t know exactly what he was.

“Then I’ll have to trouble you, Mr. Qin,” Wei Jiang said with a smile.

“Qin Yu, Mr. Wei entrusted his wife to you. You can’t let him down.” Yan Ruoxue winked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and couldn’t help but sigh to himself.

Chuzhou Bank was the largest bank in Chuzhou. Almost all commercial loans were approved by Chuzhou Bank.

How could Qin Yu not understand Yan Ruoxue’s intentions? She was clearly paving the way for him...
