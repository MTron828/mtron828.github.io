“Any godly monarch from the northern lands can easily suppress you!”The godly monarch shouted.

Qin Yu could not help but sneer at the godly monarch’s clamor.

He held a cup of fine wine in his hand and took a sip. Then, he said indifferently, “The godly monarch of the northern lands? A person without a name? You are just a nobody. What right do you have to clamor here?”

The Godly King’s expression became increasingly sullen. However, he was still a person of high status and authority, so he quickly calmed down.

However, the people around him were extremely shocked!

Qin Yu actually issued a challenge to the godly king of the northern lands?

One had to know that the nine holes had all died at the hands of the Master of the northern lands!

“He has indeed returned,”someone thought to himself.

“Qin Yu is a role model for the younger generation. Perhaps he can become the next Xiao Hai!”

“A role model for my southern region.”

For a moment, discussions were rife. They clenched their fists as if they were cheering for Qin Yu. However, most of them were excited because of the hope.

The godly monarch took a deep breath. He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “If you want to challenge the Lord, you have to at least pass me. There’s no need to talk nonsense. Let’s meet on Mount Ying Ning.”

After saying this, the godly monarch turned around and was about to head to Mount Ying Ning.

However, Qin Yu mocked him from behind, “Do you think you’re qualified to go to Mount Ying Ning with me?”

As soon as he said this, the godly monarch’s body immediately stiffened.

A wave of sullen anger filled his chest, causing his entire body to involuntarily tremble.

“You Reckless Thing.”The godly monarch’s body emitted a strong killing intent.

Qin Yu emptied the wine in his mouth. Then, he stood up and said, “Since you must die at Mount Ying Ning, fine, I’ll satisfy you.”

With that, Qin Yu activated the line word formula. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared without a trace.

For a moment, this godly monarch did not know whether he should head to Mount Ying Ning.

After thinking for a moment, he finally suppressed his anger and rushed in the direction of Mount Ying Ning.

On Mount Ying Ning, Qin Yu stood there, quietly waiting for the arrival of the godly monarch.

In the blink of an eye, the godly monarch turned into a ball of black light and slowly appeared in front of Qin Yu.

His entire body was suffused with an intense black fog. Layers of extremely strange light lingered around his body.

“I’ve been waiting for you for a long time,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Speaking of which, I have to thank you. If it weren’t for your guidance, I might not have comprehended the DAO technique so quickly.”

“In order to repay you, I will leave you with a complete corpse.”

The godly monarch was repeatedly humiliated and could not hold it in any longer. he shouted, “I don’t know what gave you such confidence, but let me tell you, in front of the secret technique of the northern lands, everything is futile. I will crush everything you have!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Secret technique? Is it a secret technique that allows you to flee back to the northern lands if you can’t win?”

The godly monarch narrowed his eyes and said, “Do you think you have that chance?”

“You talk too much nonsense.”Qin Yu’s body was already suffused with a faint golden light.

He looked coldly at the godly monarch and said, “Even if you want to escape today, I will drag you back.”

“What arrogance!”The Godly monarch roared. Black light instantly encircled him and appeared above his head, forming a huge seal.

This seemed to be a secret treasure of the northern lands. It hung above his head. The light pierced through the sky as though it wanted to crush everything. It was extremely terrifying.

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s body was suffused with golden qi. The Great Dao was like thin threads that lingered around his body. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Boom!”

The godly monarch’s expression was cold as he threw out a punch without any fear.

His fist seemed to pierce through the void, bringing with it an extremely cold black radiance. At this moment, layers of black radiance hung down. It had the strength of ten thousand tons, yet it seemed to protect him behind his back.

The surrounding crowd sucked in a breath of cold air. This strike of the godly monarch of the northern lands was too terrifying. It seemed like it was going to Pierce through the entire world!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. His right fist was surrounded by a golden fog. This was the physical body of a reversion void stage cultivator. It was a fist of the reversion void stage. After fusing with the Great Dao, its might was boundless. He was not afraid at all.

That Golden Fist was like a small mountain that had formed. It wanted to shatter everything. It looked down on the world with a terrifying bearing

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, it was as though everything had been shattered!

The black radiance that hung down was like glass shards that exploded. The two fists collided head-on, colliding into each other like two huge mountains!

Ying Ning mountain was shaking with a loud boom. The terrifying radiance swept across everything. The surrounding crowd could not dodge in time, and some people lost their lives here.

Expression of terror appeared on the Divine King’s face. The moment he touched Qin Yu’s fist, a terrifying power poured over and smashed his fist bones into pieces!

The godly monarch hurriedly retracted his palm. He bent down to look at the almost shattered fist and realized that something was wrong.

“You... broke through?”The godly monarch said in disbelief.

Qin Yu coldly berated, “You should go underground and ask!”

With that, Qin Yu’s fist came smashing over again!

The golden light on his fist seemed to have a great dao rumbling, as though it wanted to crush this space.

The godly monarch had a bad feeling. He did not dare to clash with Qin Yu again, so he quickly retreated.

But How Could Qin Yu give him a chance! !

“Boom!”

A huge mountain suddenly appeared behind him. This mountain was extremely hard, and the radiance of treasures intersected, blocking his path!

Venerable Fifth Mountain!

This space was directly crushed. The huge mountain body was firmly pressing against the godly monarch’s back.

“Not good!”

The godly monarch cried out in alarm, and with a quick thought, the Dharma Treasure revealed itself!

This was a dharma treasure given to him by the Lord of the northern lands. It was a symbol of status and status, and it contained an extremely dense dao technique

A pitch-black human face appeared from the Dharma Treasure. It seemed to be some ancient secret technique!

However, this huge face was blasted into smithereens in less than half a second! The Dharma Treasure also shattered!

Qin Yu’s Golden Fist pressed forward. Nothing could stop it. At this moment, all the secret technique could not compare to this body!

The godly monarch’s expression changed greatly. He hurriedly activated the technique, and an ancient sound filled the air!

He wanted to use all the secret technique to block Qin Yu’s Golden Fist’s rampage!

“Break for me!”

Qin Yu roared. There was no shock on his face. He charged forward bravely, and he had the momentum to destroy everything!

Under the augmentation of the secret technique, the godly monarch clenched his fist again and came over!

The black internal Qi was like a waterfall that kept sinking down, completely enveloping his body!

His fist was no longer purely a physical body. Instead, it was the combination of DAO technique and physical body. He wanted to rely on his profound realm to counter Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

Finally, Qin Yu’s fist came. It was like a small mountain that came crashing down. Even the wind from his fist was able to cut through the black radiance like a waterfall, leaving a mark!

“Ah!”

The godly monarch raised his head and roared. His true Qi exploded to the extreme. Above his head, the mark of the immortal slaying sect’s secret technique quickly condensed!

However, all of this seemed to be inferior to Qin Yu’s pure physical strength!
