1778 The Attack from Zhongzhou

Everyone seemed to have the same doubt.

It was simply too inconceivable. Although they had never experienced their primordial spirit being damaged, they knew well what it meant.

It was unbelievable to be able to stand up with a damaged primordial spirit. Stepping into this formation was undoubtedly equivalent to suicide, not to mention passing through it.

Dean Lei did not say anything. He knew that no one believed him. He then waved his hand and a beam of light fell on Qin Yu’s head.

In just a while, his primordial spirit was forcibly pulled out by Dean Lei!

Qin Yu’s broken primordial spirit was displayed in front of everyone.

The damage to Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was even more serious than they had imagined!

Seeing this, everyone was shocked!

“It’s actually… true!”

“His primordial spirit was damaged to such an extent. How… how did he do it…”

“Oh my God! This fellow is just too abnormal…”

After sending Qin Yu’s primordial spirit back into his body, Dean Lei said indifferently, “Are you still suspicious?”

“No… We don’t dare to.” Everyone bowed, not daring to look at the dean.

Dean Lei looked at the peak master and said, ” “I’ll leave the two of them to you.”

“Don’t worry, Dean,” the peak master quickly nodded.

After the dean left, the peak master dispersed the crowd and quickly walked up to Qin Yu.

He opened his mouth, looking a little embarrassed.

After a while, the peak master chuckled and said, “You do have some ability, as expected of the dean.”

Qin Yu panted slightly and said with difficulty, “So am I considered taken in now?”

“Of course,” the peak master said with a smile.

“Come with me. I’ll arrange a place for you to stay and show you around,”

Thus the three of them followed the peak master and wandered around the Demon-slaying Peak.

After some exchange, they found out the peak master’s name was Pei Chonglie. He was already more than 500 years old and he had also just reached the Reversion Void Stage not long ago.

Thus, strictly speaking, his strength might not be above Jue Wu and Xiao Sheng.

“Our Demon-slaying Peak has two groups. One is outside responsible for the investigation and the other for killing the villains,” Peak Master Pei said.

“Normally, they will bring back news every ten days. And the missions they take on are all up to the individual’s choice.

“Other than that, there will be a dao lecture every 30 days. Everyone must attend.”

Qin Yu nodded while listening, but he was actually thinking in his heart about how to devour the primordial spirit as soon as possible.

The peak master took Qin Yu and the others around most of Demon-slaying Peak, including the places where they could accept missions and listen to dao lectures.

Finally, the peak master took Qin Yu and Jue Wu to a cave abode.

“You guys can stay here for the time being,” the peak master said.

“The requirements of Demon-slaying Peak are indeed not strict. Your daily activities are not restricted. But, of course, there is one requirement. You must take on a mission once a month.”

“Thank you, Peak Master,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

“Mmm,” responded the peak master. After giving Qin Yu and Jue Wu a token each, he turned around and left.

As there were fewer cultivators on Demon-slaying Peak, the cave abode was quite spacious. It could be called a small world.

“This place is quite suitable for me,” thought Qin Yu to himself.

As for the monthly dao lectures, rumor had it that cultivation techniques would be taught. And these cultivation techniques also had strict assessment standards.

For example in Demon-slaying Peak, the more missions were there, the more points would be. Therefore the cultivation techniques that one could learn would also be better.

“You two can stay here,” Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu nodded and said gratefully, “Many thanks.”

Xiao Sheng didn’t say anything else. He then turned and left.

After he left, Qin Yu quickly found a place to lie down.

Thunder Courtyard was the former residence of Immortal Emperor Lei. Not to mention Golden Age, even if it was during the normal days, the spiritual energy here was far more abundant than in other places.

It was as if one could smell the ancient Immortal Emperor’s past from these wisps of internal qi. In a place like this, the effects of enlightenment were far from comparable to other places.

The whole cave abode was filled with immortal trees which people wished for. There was also soft grass on the ground. Qin Yu fell asleep soon after lying on the ground.

In Pei Chonglie’s cave abode. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He was playing chess with a young man.

This young man’s name was Jiu Xiao. He was known as the number one person of Demon-slaying Peak. His strength was even above Pei Chonglie’s!

During the short Great Upheaval, he had stepped into the middle stage of the Reversion Void. He had even fast approached the Advanced-stage of Reversion Void!

With such talent, he was the top heaven’s favorite in the entire Lizhou and even the entire Holy region.

“two new people joined us today. Aren’t you going to take a look?” Pei Chonglie asked casually.

Jiu Xiao stared at the chessboard, shook his head, and said, “What does that have to do with me?”.

Pei Chonglie laughed and said, “These two people are not simple, especially Qin Yu. His primordial spirit was severely damaged, but he actually passed our formation test. Even the dean came to Demon-slaying Peak personally.”

“Oh?” Jiu Xiao raised his brows, smiled, and said, “That’s indeed surprising, but it’s not worth too much attention.”

“Why do you say so?” Pei Chonglie asked.

“His primordial spirit is severely damaged. So what if he passes the formation test? His foundation has been damaged. His future achievements will not be too high.”

Pei Chonglie came to a realization. He touched his chin and muttered, “That’s true. I don’t know why the dean values him so much.”

“Perhaps it’s because of some kind of spirit in him. But unfortunately, the spirit can’t be eaten,” Jiu Xiao said indifferently.

Pei Chonglie nodded slightly and said in a low voice, “His spirit can at least influence others. Perhaps this is the dean’s intention.”

…

At Tianyun Sect.

Xiao Sheng sped along at an extremely fast speed.

When he rushed back to Tianyun Sect, Deputy Sect Master ran over anxiously.

“Sect Master, two people have been waiting for you for a long time,” Deputy Sect Master said anxiously.

Xiao Sheng didn’t say much. He narrowed his eyes and instantly noticed the two people.

After that, Xiao Sheng came to the tea room.

In the tea room, the men were sitting there drinking tea.

When they saw Xiao Sheng who rushed back, the two of them raised their heads and looked over.

“Are you Xiao Sheng?” one of them asked.

Xiao Sheng looked at the two of them coldly and said, “Are you from Zhongzhou?”

“Oh? How did you know?” the two of them said playfully.

Xiao Sheng ignored them. He sat opposite them and said calmly, “Just say it if you have anything.”

“Good! Very straightforward. As expected of the number one in Nanzhou,” one of the men said with a faint smile.

“I’m here to bring you a message as instructed by my young master.”

Xiao Sheng looked at the two of them coldly as if he had guessed their identities.
