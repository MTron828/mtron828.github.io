Chapter 663: Forcefully Raising His Cultivation! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Geng Si’s body was enveloped by the Spiritual Fire Seal. Although the flames were a little dim, they still made Geng Si feel unbearable pain.

“It worked!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu was immediately overjoyed.

He hurriedly took out the bronze sword and activated his internal Qi. With a loud shout, he raised his hand and used the third slash of the Nine Absolute Beginning Slashes.

The sky-reaching sword light suddenly appeared. The swift and fierce killing move made people shudder in fear.

“Die!” Qin Yu shouted. The sword light expanded and then rushed toward Geng Si.

At this moment, Geng Si, who was wrapped by the Spiritual Fire Seal, suddenly reached out with his big hand. Light gathered on his palm and actually went straight toward the sword light.

“Boom!”

At the moment of collision, the entire street turned into a vast expanse of white! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

This terrifying aftershock directly pushed Qin Yu back dozens of steps and left several marks on his body.

However, Qin Yu’s eyes were still fixed in the direction of Geng Si.

Geng Si’s palm was shaken until it was dripping with blood, even revealing sparkling white bones.

Seeing this, Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change.

He did not expect that the third slash would only break Geng Si’s palm!

The flames surrounding Geng Si’s body also began to slowly disappear.

The purple robe on his body had already been burned, and there were even burnt marks on his skin.

However, what made Qin Yu despair was that not only did Geng Si’s internal Qi not show any signs of weakness, it was even more vigorous!

His vulture-like eyes were coldly looking at Qin Yu.

His fierce eyes made Qin Yu shiver!

Qin Yu’s face was slightly unsightly. He didn’t expect that even though he had used all his trump cards, he still couldn’t take down Geng Si.

“As expected of a Purple Robe of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association...” Qin Yu panted heavily, and he couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.

Geng Si tore off his clothes and walked toward Qin Yu step by step.

“No wonder they sent me to fight against you. You are really full of surprises.” Geng Si’s hands condensed a burst of brilliance.

This light seemed to be one with Geng Si. They were like a pair of fitting gloves on his hands.

“You should feel honored to be able to hurt me to this extent.” Geng Si’s voice was getting closer and closer, and the light on his hands was becoming more and more dazzling.

Qin Yu was extremely anxious. At this rate, he was definitely not Geng Si’s opponent!

But to run away like this, Qin Yu was even more unwilling!

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, Geng Si had already stepped forward!

He raised his palm and fiercely strike toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He shouted loudly and clenched his golden fist to meet it.

“Boom!”

A terrifying force poured out from Geng Si’s palm.

Qin Yu’s palm instantly felt waves of soreness.

Geng Si’s left hand quickly slid away and an “Exterminate” word swiftly condensed. It was then slapped onto Qin Yu’s chest.

“Bang!”

The word exploded in front of Qin Yu’s chest. Qin Yu was instantly hit hard and his body flew out.

A big hole was hit into his chest! Fresh blood flowed out from the hole.

Waves of pain started coming from his chest and Qin Yu was in anguish.

“To be able to survive the word ‘Exterminate’ is already worthy of praise,” Geng Si said with a cold smile.

He continued to walk toward Qin Yu. With every step he took, the pressure from his body became stronger.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “I can’t just stand here and wait for death!”

There were two paths in front of Qin Yu. He could either fight to the end or turn around and escape!

But once he escaped, Xia Hang would definitely be exposed. At that time, Qin Yu would have no chance at all.

“No, I’ve worked so hard for so long. I can’t give up just like that.” Qin Yu clenched his teeth.

He ignored the big hole in his chest and stared at Geng Si.

“What, are you still planning to put up a stubborn resistance?” Geng si sneered.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “I can only try!”

Qin Yu’s eyes were slightly closed. It seemed that he was casting some kind of spell.

Following that, Qin Yu’s internal Qi was rapidly rising.

His cultivation had gone from the fourth rank of the Martial Marquis Realm to the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm!

This was the spell that he had used when he was fighting Han Wei. Forcefully raising his cultivation.

However, the side effects of this spell were too great. Once it was cast, there was no way out. It might even affect his future cultivation.

Qin Yu had no other choice now. He could only fight!

“You’re courting death.” Geng Si’s eyes shone with a cold light as he used the extermination word spell again.

A large black word instantly struck forward.

This large word seemed to carry the aura of death, making people shudder without feeling cold.

Just as this large word was about to strike Qin Yu, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

“Ah!!”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar, and golden light burst out from his hand as he met the attack with his palm.

“Boom!”

The golden light and the extermination word had collided.

Dense cracks instantly appeared under Qin Yu’s feet.

The earth seemed to be unable to bear it anymore and began to collapse at this moment.

“Rumble...”

Dark clouds suddenly gathered in the sky, and gusts of a hurricane blew up, followed by a downpour of heavy rain.

“Break!”

Qin Yu’s palm turned into a fist and suddenly pressed forward.

The “Exterminate” spell could not withstand it anymore. It was directly penetrated by Qin Yu’s golden light and disappeared without a trace.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s strength welcomed the fusion, and his cultivation had stepped into the middle stage of the Marquis Realm.

Although it was only a thin line, the difference in strength was like Heaven and Earth!

Geng Si looked at Qin Yu coldly, and a trace of playfulness appeared on the corner of his mouth.

“Forcefully raising your cultivation?” Geng Si raised his eyebrows and said.

“Do you think this will work? As far as I know, this technique can only be maintained for half an hour at most. After half an hour, your cultivation will disappear and you will instantly become a cripple.”

Qin Yu looked at Geng Si coldly and nodded. “Yes, so I only have half an hour to kill you.”

“Kill me?” Geng Si shook his head.

“There are many people in this world who can kill me, but you are not one of them.”

Qin Yu did not have time to waste with Geng Si. He only had half an hour, so he had to hurry.

Qin Yu’s feet shook, and his body shot out like an arrow, instantly charging toward Geng Si.

The golden fist contained a crushing force, and the surging force created a crack in the ground.

Geng Si’s expression was cold. He raised his hand and collided with Qin Yu.

“Deng Deng Deng!”

This time, the light on Geng Si’s hand seemed to dim a bit, and his body unconsciously took a few steps back.

“Eh?” This made Geng Si slightly surprised.

Even if Qin Yu forcefully raised his cultivation, he was only in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm. There was still a certain gap between him and Qin Yu.

However, the power of Qin Yu’s punch was actually far above his own!

“Fighting across ranks?” Geng Si raised his eyebrows and then sneered, “Interesting...”

As he spoke, Geng Si began to condense the ‘Exterminate’ word on his hand.

Facing the extermination word, Qin Yu’s fist also began to condense internal Qi.

His golden light transformed into a dragon. If one listened carefully, one could even hear the roars of a dragon.
