2252 Two Parties Reconcile

At the forefront was an elderly woman with white hair, her face kind and benevolent.

“Isn’t this the Palace Master of Azure Firmament Sect, Ming Yue? How did she come so soon?”

“It’s troublesome now. The most powerful people of Azure Firmament Sect are all here.”

“Is Azure Firmament Sect going to gain an advantage before others?”

…

Nangong Qi’s expression was extremely ugly. He did not expect the people from the Azure Firmament Sect to arrive so soon.

“Everyone, please give me some due respect. This person killed our disciples and snatched our Soul-hunting Bell, the magical artifact of the Azure Firmament Sect. I will definitely take this person down and bring him to justice!”

The elderly woman Ming Yue said with a faint smile. The twenty or so people beside her had already silently surrounded Qin Yu.

The surrounding cultivators fell silent. Due to the elderly woman’s strength, no one dared to utter a sound.

“Are you saying if you say so, then it shall be? The heaven-defying divine artifact shall be obtained by those destined for it!”

A middle-aged rogue cultivator said coldly.

“Hmph!”

A green flexible sword instantly appeared before the middle-aged cultivator like a bolt of lightning.

His expression changed drastically, and he quickly took out a bell magical artifact and placed it in front of him.

“Ding!”

The bell hit him right in the middle, slicing his abdomen in half. Intestines and organs spilled out, making a mess on the ground.

Next to the elderly woman, a female attendant coldly sheathed her sword. Her moves were swift and powerful, intended to subdue everyone.

The elderly woman came to Qin Yu and said coldly.

“You’re the one who killed my disciples, and snatched my sect’s supreme treasure, the Soul-hunting Bell?”

“Yes, I killed them. They attacked and snatched my inner core first.”

“Shut up, did I ask you anything?” The elderly woman’s killing intent flashed.

“Boom!” His body slammed into a giant rock, and several of his ribs broke.

“Capture this trash!”

The elderly woman’s face was as cold as ice.

Two female attendants rushed over and were about to capture Qin Yu.

“Roar!”

With a punch, massive fist energy enveloped in deep crimson, almost black lava.

It brushed past the two female attendants and melted half of their bodies in an instant.

Two bodies fell heavily to the ground, emitting a strong smell of burnt flesh.

“Hiss!”

“What a terrifying magical artifact!”

“The power of this punch was probably unmatched even by cultivators who had comprehended the way.”

…

Nangong Qi looked at Qin Yu and suddenly sneered as he silently retreated.

The elderly woman looked at Qin Yu’s gloves and revealed a greedy expression.

“How dare you! You, reckless rogue, have not learned your lesson. I’ll let you taste torture!”

The elderly woman coldly shouted.

“You bullsh*t! If you want my life, come and take it if you have the ability.”

Qin Yu sneered.

“Hah!”

With a crisp sound, dozens of sword lights slashed at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s gloves moved and transformed into a giant shield.

Instantly, the fiendish internal qi changed abruptly, turning into a mountainous aura of heaven and earth.

The sword light could not even leave a mark on the shield.

“It can actually switch between offense and defense?”

The eyes of the surrounding cultivators almost popped out.

A divine thought like a poisonous snake suddenly blasted into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. This divine thought was extremely fine, and because of this, its penetrating power was even more terrifying. In almost an instant, Qin Yu’s divine sense figurine was penetrated.

Ming Yue was wary of the power of these boxing gloves and actually dared not approach for a moment.

It was adding insult to injury!

Qin Yu spat a mouthful of black blood and collapsed to the ground. He could not squeeze out even a trace of spiritual power. The giant shield turned into small gloves and merged into his hands.

He pulled off his gloves and threw them into the air. The gloves suddenly accelerated and rushed into the crowd.

“Old fellow, go and snatch it yourself if you have the ability!”

Qin Yu spat a mouthful of blood, sneered, and said.

“Brat, you’re courting death!”

Ming Yue angrily rebuked. She waved her hand and a wave of spiritual energy wrapped around the boxing gloves and then pulled them onto her body.

“Boom!”

Some cultivators fell silent, then suddenly launched an attack.

Once it started, it became unstoppable.

For a moment, the scene was in chaos. Although the gloves had been taken down, she was facing many rogue cultivators who were eyeing it covetously.

Azure Firmament Sect was having a hard time killing dozens of people consecutively.

“Are you courting death? Do you really think my Azure Firmament Sect is easy to manipulate?”

A vast green space suddenly enveloped everyone, and green spatial poisonous clouds non-stop rolling.

Within the poisonous clouds, one could occasionally hear the hissing of poisonous snakes.

Several cultivators who charged forward suddenly collapsed, and their souls were instantly pierced through.

“Ming Yue’s Poisonous Soul Domain, quickly retreat!”

“It’s so strong! In this Poisonous Soul Domain, she can attack our souls at any time.”

“Palace Master Ming Yue, if you take these gloves away like this, wouldn’t you be looking down on everyone present?”

An old man walked out with a cold smile. There were dozens of cultivators with powerful internal qi around him.

It was Shui Yuan, the sect master of the Mysterious Dark Sect.

“Shui Yuan, have you thought it through? Do you really want to start a war with my Azure Firmament Sect? Not to mention your people’s strength is inferior to mine, even if you get the gloves, are you sure you’ll come out unscathed?” Ming Yue’s eyes flickered a few times as she looked at the elderly man.

Shui Yuan was somewhat silent. Everyone present was a shrewd person who had lived for nearly 5,000 years. Naturally, they would not engage in actions that would be advantageous to others at their own expense.

“I can’t let you take this divine artifact for free. I want your sect’s magical artifact, Immortal Binding Rope, and three Mystic Realms of your sect. I’ll not fight for this divine artifact then.”

Shui Yuan said in a deep voice.

“What a big talk! The Immortal Binding Rope is also a tribulation artifact. How dare you ask for it?”

The cultivator beside the elderly woman coldly reprimanded.

Shui Yuan pretended not to hear him and just looked at Ming Yue, waiting for her reply.

The two of them were the most powerful forces here. If the Mysterious Dark Sect did not make a move, the ownership of this divine artifact would be obvious.

“If this drags on, and once the evil exterminator and the Blood Sect arrive, it’s hard to say who this divine artifact will end up with. This magical artifact is at the peak of the Tribulation Transcendence realm, right? If my friend Ming Yue thinks you’re at a disadvantage, I can give you a tribulation magical artifact and three Mystic Realms. What do you think?”

Shui Yuan laughed coldly.

“At most, the Immortal Binding Rope and two Mystic Realms. This is my bottom line,” Ming Yue said coldly.

“Deal, let’s swear via the Path of Heaven!” Shui Yuan nodded.

He was extremely envious of the gloves, but they were now in Ming Yue’s hands.

And just as Ming Yue had said, the Mysterious Dark Sect was slightly weaker than the Azure Firmament Sect. If they fought, the divine artifact would most likely not fall into their hands in the end. It was better to exchange it for real benefits.

After making the oath, Ming Yue finally felt relieved.

Her gaze fell on Qin Yu lying on the ground.

“Trash, how dare you kill my disciples!”

Her gaze was like a poisonous snake. Qin Yu instantly felt a poisonous snake in his soul that was ruthlessly gnawing at his soul. The pain that penetrated deep into his soul almost made him faint.

“Let my spirit snake taste your soul. Before you die, repent for offending my Azure Firmament Sect.”
