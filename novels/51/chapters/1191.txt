Chapter 1192: Chapter 1,192. Difficult decision 

He ran all the way to the pavilion master’s room. Qin Yu did not knock on the door and directly pushed it open to enter.

At this moment, the pavilion master was leaning on the wooden bed to sleep. Her eyes were slightly closed and she was only wearing a gauze robe.

However, Qin Yu could not care about these things. He quickly walked to the front of the pavilion master. Just as he was about to speak, the pavilion master opened her eyes.

She frowned slightly, and a hint of displeasure flashed across her eyes. Then, she reached out with her palm, and a long robe fell on her body.

“Pavilion master, I have something urgent to ask you.”Qin Yu took a deep breath and said.

Pavilion master sat up from the bed and motioned for Qin Yu to speak.

Qin Yu couldn’t wait to ask, “Do you know my mother? Where is she? What happened to her? Do you have a photo of her?”

This sentence surprised the pavilion master.

She looked at Qin Yu in surprise and asked in confusion, “Why did you suddenly ask this?”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to hide it and told the pavilion master what happened to her.

Qin Yu didn’t hide the scene in the inkstone at all.

After hearing it, the Pavilion Master’s face turned ugly.

She did not speak for a long time, which made Qin Yu even more anxious.

“Pavilion Master, what exactly is going on? is the woman I saw in the Inkstone My Mother?”Qin Yu asked anxiously.

Pavilion master sighed slightly.

She looked at Qin Yu and said, “I’m sorry to tell you that it’s true.”

This made Qin Yu’s expression change drastically, and his emotions were extremely complicated.

“Then where is she now? I’m going to save her!”Qin Yu clenched his fist and said.

“Also, who did this to my mother? Where is my father! Why is he sitting idly by!”

Pavilion master opened his mouth and sighed, “Your father also has some unspeakable secrets, he...”

“What Bullsh * t unspeakable secrets!”Qin Yu rudely interrupted pavilion master’s words.

“His own woman was treated like this, but he just sat there and did nothing. There’s no reason! He’s just selfish!”

Just as Qin Yu said, if the one who suffered this treatment was Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu would risk his life to take revenge.

Pavilion master was silent, as if Qin Yu was right.

“I don’t know where your mother is either,”pavilion master said after a while.

“You don’t know either?”Qin Yu’s expression became even uglier.

He remembered that he had asked Tian Jizi the same question, and Tian Jizi’s answer was the same.

Qin Yu sat on the bed, feeling ashamed.

He had never thought that his mother was still alive, much less that she would suffer now.

“Then do you know where my father is? As a dao protector, he definitely knows where my mother is,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Pavilion master shook his head once more. “I tried to look for him last time, but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to find him.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth, his heart filled with mixed feelings.

The saint-level was about to depart, but at this moment, Qin Yu had received such news. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Calm down, calm down. Even if you are anxious now, it’s useless,”pavilion master said.

Qin Yu clenched his fists and remained silent, as if he was thinking about something.

“I will definitely force him to show himself,”Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Last time, when Qin Yu was fighting against eight higher-ups, he wore a black robe and ordered the eight higher-ups to retreat.

This was enough to prove that when Qin Yu was in danger, he would definitely show up.

That night, Qin Yu sat in his room until early morning.

He was filled with regret and guilt.

The scene in the Inkstone kept playing in his mind.

Outside the door, there was a scene of singing and dancing.

Everyone seemed to be extremely excited.

“Qin Yu, come out and drink,”Zhuang Teng patted Qin Yu’s door and shouted.

Qin Yu did not say anything and did not pay attention to Zhuang Teng.

“Qin Yu? What are you doing?”Zhuang Teng wanted to push the door open and enter, but was stopped by the pavilion master.

“Qin Yu did not sleep well last night and is resting. Don’t disturb him,”said the pavilion master.

Zhuang Teng heard this and immediately kept quiet.

After a while, pavilion master pushed the door open and entered.

She sat opposite Qin Yu and said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, you... must not be rash.”

“I know, pavilion master. Don’t worry. I’m not a good kid anymore.”Qin Yu forced a smile and said.

Pavilion master sighed and said, “I believe that your father must have some unspeakable reasons. Because of his special identity, so...”

“Is it because he’s afraid of losing his identity as a Guardian? Or is it because he’s afraid of being punished by the Heavenly Dao?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

Pavilion Master didn’t refute Qin Yu’s words, but said, “But for you, he has violated the rules again and again.”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Pavilion Master, Please Don’t persuade me. That’s my mother. If a person can ignore his own mother, is he still human? He’s probably worse than an animal.”

At this point, Qin Yu stood up. He took a deep breath and said coldly, “I’ve decided. I Won’t go to the holy region for the time being.”

Pavilion master was stunned. He frowned and asked, “What did you say?”

“I said, I won’t go to the Holy Region. I Won’t leave until I find my mother,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Pavilion master frowned and said, “Think carefully. If you don’t go this time, I don’t know how long you’ll have to wait for the next time.”

“Moreover... This is the golden era. Every minute and second will produce a deviation. When you go to the holy region, it’s very likely that you’ll be left behind.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I won’t give up on family ties just for the sake of cultivation.”

“Keep this matter a secret for the time being. You just need to know it yourself,”Qin Yu exhorted.
