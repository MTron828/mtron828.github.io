Chapter 661: Was Discovered?! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He Teng looked at Qin Yu gloomily and said with a grin, “I had been wanting to meet you too...”

Yan Guiyi hurriedly shouted, “He Teng, kill him!”

He Teng licked his lips and said, “To me, you are an extremely delicious ingredient...”

“Ingredient?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He didn’t seem to understand what He Teng meant.

He Teng did not say anything more. He put away the Black Gold Ball, and with a shake of his palm, a long spear fell into his hand. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Looking at He Teng who was standing in front of him, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

This He Teng seemed to be different from before. The black energy surrounding him had completely disappeared, and his body seemed to be no longer as weak as before.

“Qin Yu, after I kill you, I will definitely have a good taste of you.” He Teng sneered. The long spear in his hand suddenly shook and headed straight for Qin Yu’s glabella!

Qin Yu was not afraid at all. He shouted loudly and held the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist in his hand as he went to meet it straight.

“Clang!”

The sound of steel colliding was deafening! Under this tremendous force, Qin Yu was forced back three steps.

On the other hand, He Teng’s long spear was unharmed, and there were even specks of light on it.

“This spear doesn’t seem simple. Your strength... seems to have improved,” Qin Yu said with narrowed eyes.

He Teng laughed loudly and said, “Qin Yu, do you think you’re the only one who’s improving!”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “You’re relying on that guy in your body, right? If you’re on your own, you’re just a piece of trash.”

He Teng’s face suddenly changed, and a trace of killing intent burst out of his eyes.

“What? Did I touch on a sore spot just like that?” Qin Yu sneered.

“He Teng, you are not worthy to fight with me. Let that guy in your body come out.”

He Teng ignored Qin Yu’s words and said coldly, “After I kill you, I will definitely sew your mouth shut!”

As he spoke, He Teng held the long spear in his hand and charged at Qin Yu again!

The power of this long spear was not ordinary. Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He immediately used the Saintly Body Technique to meet it again!

“Stab!”

What shocked Qin Yu was that this long spear actually went right through his golden light and pierced straight into his chest.

That huge force slanted from the long spear and forced Qin Yu back several steps!

Qin Yu’s face couldn’t help but turn cold.

He Teng’s strength had actually reached such a level! He was probably not much weaker than Yan Jinyao and the others.

He Teng said coldly, “Qin Yu, today is the day you die!”

Before he finished his words, He Teng waved the long spear as if he was casting some kind of spell.

Rays of light condensed on the long spear. The light continuously coiled and finally gathered at the spearhead.

In the next second, He Teng grabbed the long spear in his hand and quickly stabbed forward.

One, two, three times. In just a few short seconds, He Teng stabbed out thirteen times consecutively!

The thirteen rays of light instantly covered the sky and earth as they pressed down on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. His palm shook and he immediately took out his bronze sword. Then, he suddenly slashed out with his sword.

“Boom!”

The terrifying sword light swept out and collided with the thirteen beams of light!

The ground immediately began to collapse. The trees not far away snapped in half, and gravel rolled down.

Yan Guiyi hurriedly retreated. He took advantage of this time to immediately call Qu Xie.

“President Qu, Qin Yu is at my home now. Send someone to catch him immediately!” Yan Guiyi said anxiously.

Qu Xie immediately ordered Geng Si to go straight to Yan Guiyi’s residence.

The scene was still roaring. Both sides held sharp blades in their hands, and in the blink of an eye, more than ten moves had passed.

The surroundings were destroyed, and Yan Guiyi’s villa had turned into ruins.

For a moment, the fight between the two seemed to be inextricable. He Teng became even crazier, and the long spear in his hand kept stabbing out.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed. He waved the large sword in his hand, and then said coldly, “He Teng, the next time I see you, I will definitely kill you.”

He Teng sneered and said, “What, are you planning to escape?”

Qin Yu did not waste any more words with He Teng. He immediately used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch and turned around to leave.

He Teng originally wanted to chase after him, but that hoarse and old voice rang in his mind.

“There’s no need to chase after him...”

Hearing this voice, He Teng could not help but frown and say, “Why? Qin Yu is clearly not my match!”

“No, Qin Yu did not use his full strength at all...” That hoarse voice said coldly.

He Teng sneered and said, “How is that possible! If he had the ability to kill me, he would not waste this time!”

The hoarse voice did not explain further, but with his experience, he could clearly see that Qin Yu did not use his full strength.

Just as he had guessed, Qin Yu originally wanted to kill Yan Guiyi, but He Teng’s appearance had changed Qin Yu’s plan.

It was better to leave Yan Guiyi with his dog life and let him go and inform the others. This would aid Qin Yu in his plan.

“He Teng, hurry up and chase after him!” Yan Guiyi walked forward and shouted angrily.

He Teng looked at Yan Guiyi coldly and said, “Yan Guiyi, don’t forget that I saved you. If it weren’t for me, you would have become a dead soul by now!”

“Also, I’m warning you, I’m not your subordinate! If you dare to talk to me like that again...”

He Teng didn’t finish his words, but a strong killing intent burst out from his body.

The moment Yan Guiyi opened his mouth, he felt as if a fishbone was stuck in his throat.

He was actually starting to be afraid, afraid of this junior!

“We are in a cooperative relationship,” He Teng warned.

Yan Guiyi felt very aggrieved. He was a dignified black robe, but now he was being reprimanded by two juniors consecutively!

“You should leave quickly. The people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association are coming soon,” Yan Guiyi said after taking a deep breath.

He Teng did not say anything more and turned around to leave.

On the other side, Qin Yu was rushing straight to Xia Hang’s home.

Geng Si soon arrived at Yan Guiyi’s home.

“Where is he?” Geng Si asked coldly.

Yan Guiyi shook his head and said, “He has run away.”

Yan Guiyi seemed to want to show off, so he continued, “Mr. Geng, according to my speculation, Qin Yu seems to want to seek revenge.”

Geng Si ignored Yan Guiyi’s words and coldly spat out two words, “Trash.”

Yan Guiyi’s face flushed red, but he didn’t dare to say another word.

At this time, Geng Si’s phone rang.

He picked up the phone and heard Qu Xie on the other end say, “Qin Yu is heading in the direction of Xia Hang’s home.”

Geng Si didn’t say anything. He hung up the phone and turned to leave.

...

Qin Yu sped all the way and soon arrived near Xia Hang’s home.

He took a deep breath, took out his phone, and sent a message to Xia hang, “Come downstairs in an hour later.”

After sending the message, Qin Yu was ready to delete the message.

However, at this moment, a big hand grabbed Qin Yu’s wrist!

“Come downstairs in an hour later? It seems that Xia Hang has betrayed the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.” A cold voice sounded in Qin Yu’s ear.

He looked up and saw a tall man in a purple robe.

This man was none other than Geng Si!
