Chapter 1691: Chapter 1,691. Xiao Sheng won by 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After the drop of blood essence entered, the light became even bigger. It was actually going to swallow the Luo Sheng sect!

Everyone was shocked. The Luo Sheng sect had never had any countermeasures. Now, Zhao Jing was actually going to break the Luo Sheng sect? !

“Xiao Sheng, you must die today!”Zhao Jing raised his head and roared. His hair danced wildly, and all of his internal Qi was pressed into the light!

Xiao Sheng’s expression was extremely calm. He looked coldly at Zhao Jing, and his other hand moved.

This was his left hand. His left hand moved in the air, and then gently pressed in Zhao Jing’s direction.

“Boom!”

The Space Zhao Jing was in instantly collapsed!

Zhao Jing, who was in this space, had countless broken bones. His internal Qi instantly became unstable, and his face was extremely pale!

Even if he wanted to control the light, under the power of this space, his bones were almost crushed!

“Ah! !”

Finally, Zhao Jing couldn’t take it anymore!

He raised his head and roared, kneeling on the ground!

The light formed by his blood essence also disappeared.

Everything returned to normal. Zhao Jing fell to the ground, looking terrible.

His internal Qi was already unstable, and he looked like he was on the verge of death.

After sacrificing such a large amount of blood essence, Zhao Jing no longer had any fighting strength left!

“He lost. He really lost… at the reversion void stage.”In the dark, everyone couldn’t help but sigh.

No one had expected this battle to end like this.

Xiao Sheng had defeated the reversion void stage with his mighty realm cultivation. If news of this spread, it would probably shock the entire holy region. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Just as Xiao Sheng had said, no one below the reversion void stage was his match. As for the reversion void stage, he was not afraid.

“He really did it.”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Zhao Jing, who had just entered the reversion void stage, was really too miserable.

The strange phenomenon behind Xiao Sheng disappeared. He walked step by step to Zhao Jing and looked down at him coldly.

A strong killing intent was emitted from his body. He slowly raised his palm and a powerful internal Qi instantly erupted.

Zhao Jing’s expression changed greatly. He hurriedly stood up and shouted with all his might, “Xiao Sheng, spare me. Don’t kill me!”

Xiao Sheng didn’t say a word. The radiance of his palm became more and more holy and pure.

“Don’t… Don’t kill me. I don’t want to Die!”Zhao Jing panicked. He had just stepped into the reversion void stage, and he wasn’t willing to die just like that!

“The northern lands have come to invade. There’s still a use for you to keep me alive. I… I’ll redeem myself!”Zhao Jing said desperately.

Xiao Sheng looked at Zhao Jing coldly and shook his head. “I’m not Xiao Hai.”

Before he finished speaking, that Ray of light instantly erupted and completely destroyed Zhao Jing’s head.

An invincible reversion void stage cultivator had become a headless corpse just like that. It looked extremely desolate as it fell to the ground.

“Sigh, Saint Xiao’s strength has far exceeded our imagination.”

“Yeah, I thought that he would definitely lose today. I didn’t expect…”

“Zhao Jing died just like that. It really makes one sigh.”

The people watching from the shadows couldn’t help but sigh. Some sighed while others gloated. However, most of them still felt shocked.

Qin Yu, who was not far away, remained silent. His heart was filled with mixed feelings.

Was this the chosen one of the Holy Region? It was too terrifying.

Even Qin Yu, who had always been conceited, could not help but feel shocked at this moment.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng’s gaze suddenly turned toward the void not far away.

The person hiding in the void instantly tensed up, and his expression was incomparably nervous.

Xiao Sheng quietly stared in that direction without saying a word.

A moment later, Xiao Sheng opened his mouth.

He said coldly, “If any of you still want to attack me, feel free to do so.”

When he said this, everyone was shocked!

What did Xiao Sheng mean by this? ! Could it be that there were other reversion void stage cultivators present? !

Xiao Sheng, who had just experienced a great battle, was actually provoking the other reversion void stage cultivators? !

No one spoke, and the scene was dead silent.

Those cultivators who had just entered the reversion void stage chose to escape in the end.

This battle had dispelled all their thoughts. In this golden era, they weren’t willing to take this risk.

The people in the dark left one after another, and everything fell silent.

However, the Heavenly Cloud sect had already been reduced to ruins, and it probably needed to be rebuilt.

Xiao Sheng looked at the ruins, and there was no expression on his face.

The deputy sect master ran over and stood in front of Xiao Sheng. He said excitedly, “Sect master, don’t worry. I will get people to rebuild the Heavenly Cloud sect immediately!”

Xiao Sheng nodded slightly, agreeing with the deputy sect master’s words.

The rest of the people in the sect also walked over. They surrounded Xiao Sheng and were all excited.

Following such a sect master was a kind of honor for them.

Qin Yu also stood in the crowd. He looked at Xiao Sheng and couldn’t help but let out a bitter laugh.

If he had attacked him back then, he probably wouldn’t have had the chance to escape, right?

“You actually did it.”Qin Yu walked forward and couldn’t help but sigh.

Xiao Sheng raised his eyebrows and said, “Is it very strange?”

“It is quite strange. At the very least, I think I can’t do it.”Qin Yu said without hiding anything.

Xiao Sheng shook his head and said, “I don’t think so.”

Qin Yu was stunned, then he smiled bitterly and said, “You really think highly of me…”

Xiao Sheng said indifferently, “In this world, I only recognize two people.”

“One is my brother Xiao Hai, and the other is you.”

“Qin Yu, I’m looking forward to fighting with you.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth but didn’t say anything. He just nodded and said, “Okay, that day will come.”

Xiao Sheng didn’t say anything more. With a few flashes, he disappeared from everyone’s sight.

The deputy sect master ran over and said excitedly, “Qin Yu, the sect master really thinks highly of you! He actually compared you to Xiao Hai!”

Qin Yu sighed slightly. He didn’t say anything as he turned around and left.

The deputy sect master looked at Qin Yu’s back and couldn’t help but mutter, “I really don’t understand these people. It’s so baffling.”

…

After this battle, the entire southern region was talking about this matter.

Xiao Sheng, who had been silent for many years, was once again pushed to the cusp of the storm.

“Xiao Sheng is really too terrifying. As expected of the peak of the southern region back then.”

“That’s right. He used the mighty realm to kill a return to void stage cultivator. That’s too terrifying!”

“If he were to step into the reversion void stage, who would be able to defeat him? I don’t dare to imagine!”

“In that case, I’m not too worried about that elementalist. Xiao Sheng will definitely be able to kill him!”

Many people came here because of the fame and joined the Heavenly Cloud sect one after another.

This made the Heavenly Cloud sect, which had been in decline not long ago, once again become full of vitality.

Many people came because of the fame, even just to see Xiao Sheng once.

The deputy sect master was naturally so happy that he could not close his mouth. Such a grand occasion had never been seen except when the Tianyun sect was first established.
