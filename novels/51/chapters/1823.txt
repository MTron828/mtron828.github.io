1824 Xiao Sheng Disappeared?

Now that Heavenly Blood Rainbow was under Qin Yu’s control, he did not dare to hide anything and could only tell him the truth.

“Back then, Immortal Slaying Sect was indeed at its final stage. Its strength had also suffered a great blow, but it was still the number one sect in the world,” Heavenly Blood Rainbow said coldly. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Moreover, Immortal Slaying Sect’s Immortal Emperor had already fallen at that time. Thus a Tribulation Stage great cultivator was appointed as the sect leader.”

“If it wasn’t for this reason, it’s still uncertain who would win.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and recalled the scene he had seen in the Immortal Slaying Sect.

As Heavenly Blood Rainbow had said, there were no immortal emperors in the entire sect at that time. There were only Tribulation Stage great cultivators and even a large number of Mighty Realm cultivators.

“Of course, the damage the masked woman caused to the Immortal Slaying Sect was unsalvageable,” Heavenly Blood Rainbow said coldly.

“If it weren’t for her, Immortal Slaying Sect would definitely be able to make a comeback!

“Fortunately, I’ve left behind an inheritance. Immortal Slaying Sect will become the number one sect in the universe sooner or later!”

“Stop dreaming. Immortal Slaying Sect has already become history,” Qin Yu laughed and said.

“You don’t know how terrifying Immortal Slaying Sect is. If Immortal Slaying Sect is still here, what bullsh*t nine great aristocratic would be?” Heavenly Blood Rainbow coldly snorted and said.

“The one who has the true inheritance will definitely suppress all the existing heaven’s favorites, including you!”

Qin Yu was silent. He did not understand how terrifying the Immortal Slaying Sect was. But as the weakest inheritor of the sect, Yuan Xiu had brought a terrible disaster to Nanzhou.

A true inheritor of the Immortal Slaying Sect would probably be an extremely powerful enemy in the future.

Soon, Qin Yu and the peak master returned to the Demon-slaying Peak.

“Peak Master, there are still three more days. I would like to leave Thunder Courtyard for the time being,” Qin Yu said.

The peak master wanted to reject it subconsciously, but when he recalled Dean Lei’s attitude, he swallowed his words.

“You may go. Just pay attention to your safety. Let Jue Wu go with you,” the peak master was surprisingly gentle, which even surprised Qin Yu.

“Many thanks, Peak Master,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

Following that, Qin Yu called Jue Wu, and the two left Thunder Courtyard.

Qin Yu planned to go back to Nanzhou to visit Xiao Sheng.

Being away for so long, no one knew if Xiao Sheng could survive the Tong family’s attack.

…

In the peak master’s cave abode, Jiu Xiao was playing chess with the peak master.

The peak master’s chess skills were terrible today, and he lost several times to Jiu Xiao.

“This doesn’t seem like your level,” Jiu Xiao said jokingly.

“I’m not in the mood,” the peak master sighed and said.

“What’s the matter? Were you lectured by the dean?” Jiu Xiao smiled and said.

“I wouldn’t have ended up like this if the dean had lectured me,” the peak master said with a solemn expression.

“Oh? So what is that?” Jiu Xiao was a little surprised.

“The dean has agreed,” the peak master said in a deep voice.

“What did he agree?” Jiu Xiao was stunned.

“He agreed to Qin Yu’s visit to the Immortal Emperor’s ancestral grave,” the peak master said coldly.

This time, Jiu Xiao’s expression also turned a little ugly.

The peak master told Jiu Xiao everything that had happened.

After hearing this, Jiu Xiao fell into silence.

“I’m afraid this Qin Yu really has some background,” Jiu Xiao said in a low voice.

“As far as I know, only a handful of people in Thunder Courtyard are qualified to get close to the ancestral grave. People don’t even know where the ancestral grave is,” Jiuxiao said coldly.

The peak master sighed, “That’s right. This is what I can’t figure out. Who in such a vast Holy Region that even Dean Lei would respect so much? Could it be the patriarch of the nine great aristocratic families?”

Jiu Xiao did not say anything and fell into silence.

…

Qin Yu and Jue Wu left Thunder Courtyard and rushed to Tianyun Sect.

It was not far from Tianyun Sect. The two spent a short day arriving at Tianyun Sect.

However, their faces turn extremely ugly upon seeing the scene in front of them.

The once incomparably bustling Tianyun Sect was now desolated.

The main gate had collapsed, and Cultivation Mountain had also become ruins.

There was not a single pure land in the entire Tianyun Sect.

“How… How could this be…” Qin Yu murmured, and his face was extremely ugly.

He did not dare to waste any time. He quickly released his divine sense to capture Xiao Sheng’s figure.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu had searched the entire Tianyun Sect but could not find any trace of Xiao Sheng.

“How… How could it be?” Qin Yu’s face turned pale, and a bad thought crossed his mind.

“Let’s go in and look for him. Maybe he’s fine,” Jue Wu pulled Qin Yu and said.

Just as the two were about to step into Tianyun Sect, an old man blocked their way.

“You’re here to look for Xiao Sheng, aren’t you?” the old man said.

Qin Yu quickly nodded, walked over, and said, “Senior, where is Xiao Sheng? What has Tianyun Sect gone through?”

“Xiao Sheng said you would definitely return. Thus he had made me wait for you here,” the old man sighed and said.

“He… How is he?” Qin Yu asked impatiently.

“He’s still alive, but he’s seriously injured,” the old man said in a deep voice.

“The entire Tianyun Sect suffered heavy losses. The number of survivors can be counted on fingers.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, clenched his fists, and said coldly, “Was it done by the Tong family?”

The old man didn’t answer the question. He only sighed and said, “All living beings are equal in front of a Saint Weapon. It’s the same even for Xiao Sheng…”

After saying this, the old man was about to leave.

Qin Yu hurriedly caught up with him and said, “Did he tell his whereabouts?”

“I don’t know. I don’t know.” The old man shook his head. “It’s considered good enough to be able to leave this place alive…”

The old man waved his hand as he spoke, and he slowly disappeared from Qin Yu’s sight.

Qin Yu didn’t chase after him. He just felt extremely uncomfortable.

This matter had started because of him. Back then, Xiao Sheng offended the Tong family to help him.

“This Tong family…” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

At this moment, Jue Wu frowned and said, “Hurry up and leave!”

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu was puzzled.

“Someone is approaching. He’s very powerful. Let’s go quickly!” Jue Wu coldly said.

She didn’t have time to explain. She grabbed Qin Yu, turned around, and fled.

The two of them ran all the way and quickly left the place.

Not long after they escaped, two men appeared at the entrance of the Tianyun Sect.

“Where are they?” one of them asked.

The other man sniffed and said coldly, “They haven’t run far. Let’s chase!”

After that, the two of them followed Qin Yu’s internal qi and dashed away.

On the other end, Qin Yu and Jue Wu were running away swiftly.

At this moment, Qin Yu finally understood that the Tong family must have sent someone to stay there and wait for him.

They fled for hundreds of stars in one go before they stopped.
