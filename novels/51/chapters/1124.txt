Chapter 1125: Chapter 1,125, exit seclusion! 

The fourth transformation of the nine transformation golden pill, even Qin Yu did not know how long it would last.

He was slightly anxious in the bottom of his heart. He was afraid that he would miss the birth of a mighty figure and cause the Heaven Gate to fall.

Time passed by minute by minute, but the fourth transformation still did not stop.

At this time, Qin Yu’s physical body had already been destroyed and reassembled nearly a thousand times. His physical body had already reached an unimaginable level of strength.

In addition to the improvement of the Martial Saint Stage, Qin Yu’s strength had undergone a qualitative change. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Even Qin Yu himself had not expected such a change. Such an improvement could be said to have increased exponentially.

No wonder that mustache and tie Dan had said that the chaotic body would enter a strong stage after stepping into the martial saint stage. These words were true!

“No, we can’t continue.”Qin Yu frowned deeply.

He had a time calculation in his heart. According to this calculation, the time of his closed-door cultivation was definitely more than five days.

Qin Yu would never allow others to be hurt because of his closed-door cultivation.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden light, preventing the next collapse of his body.

He actually relied on his powerful spiritual power to forcefully stop the fourth transformation of the Nine Transformation Golden Pill!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was emitting a divine might. The terror of his physical body was beyond imagination.

Every inch of his skin seemed to be emitting rolling energy. This energy fused with Qin Yu’s physical body, as if it was covered in a layer of armor.

If one looked carefully, one could even see that his physical body was mixed with a wisp of faintly discernible white qi.

Qin Yu lightly clenched his fist, and a thick and powerful energy flowed out from his heart.

His body was filled with surging power. The strength of his strength made Qin Yu feel extremely confident in his heart.

“According to my guess, after stepping into the intermediate stage of the martial saint stage, he should be able to fight against a mighty figure. Even if he loses, he won’t lose too badly,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“However, the power of the intermediate stage of the martial saint stage has completely exceeded my expectations. Now that I’m fighting against a mighty figure, I even have a trace of confidence.”

He did not say anything more. With a stomp of his foot, the entire sea instantly stirred up a vortex!

That enormous power had shattered countless innocent creatures at the bottom of the sea!

Soon, Qin Yu burst out from under the sea.

The entire sea surface instantly stirred up raging waves!

These sea water mugworts turned into water droplets in the air. It was as if a heavy rain had fallen on the entire shore!

Qin Yu’s hair was wet from the sea water, and his clothes were also stained with water.

He looked at his own body, and then his body emitted a burning heat.

Under this burning heat, the sea water was instantly evaporated.

“It’s time to go back. I wonder how the Heaven Gate is doing,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He didn’t dare to waste any time and immediately rushed toward the Heaven Gate.

At this moment, there was only one night left until the day Tian Zong set the date.

Qin Yu had arrived at the Heaven Gate before this.

Standing at the entrance of the Heaven Gate, Qin Yu could clearly sense a strange internal Qi.

This internal Qi was definitely not something that a martial saint could release.

Even though he forcefully suppressed it, he could still feel the difference.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He activated his desolate divine eyes and looked towards a certain room in the Heaven Gate.

This line of sight passed through the entire Heaven Gate and headed straight for Tian Zong!

In the room, Tian Zong was watching television with great interest.

This could not help but cause Qin Yu to be slightly stunned.

“This mighty figure... is actually watching television?”Qin Yu did not know whether to laugh or cry.

He had thought that it would be a bloodbath, but he did not expect it to be such a scene.

Qin Yu retracted his desolate God’s eye. He was not in a hurry to find Tian Zong. Instead, he rushed all the way to the pavilion master’s room.

In the room.

Pavilion master, Jiang He, and Chang Mang were all in the same room.

Other than Chang Mang, everyone else looked worried.

Only Chang Mang, who was caught up in the commotion, was eating an apple and looking at his phone. From time to time, he would even laugh out loud.

“Chang Mang, haven’t you considered running?”Jiang he walked up and asked.

Chang Mang sneered, “Run? Since I was young, I, Chang Mang, don’t know what running is!”

“Aren’t you afraid of facing a mighty figure?”Jiang he couldn’t help but ask.

Chang Mang put down the apple in his hand and said seriously, “Ever since my mother passed away, I haven’t been afraid of anyone.”

When Jiang he heard this, he didn’t know whether it was a blessing or a curse.

Facing a mighty figure, they didn’t have any countermeasures at all.

Creak

At this moment, the door was suddenly opened.

“Who? !”Chang Mang suddenly stood up, and a thick power instantly erupted!

“Me.”Qin Yu pushed the door open and Strode in.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, Chang Mang was stunned, and then he said with a face full of surprise, “Qin Yu? When did you come back?”

“Just now,”Qin Yu said.

“I heard your conversation. Chang Mang, you are really...”

Even Qin Yu didn’t know how to describe Chang Mang for a moment.

This kid really didn’t know what fear was.

“Did you break through?”Pavilion master walked forward and asked.

Qin Yu nodded slightly, cupped his hands and said, “Pavilion Master, you must have suffered a lot these few days. Tian Zong didn’t make things difficult for you, right?”

“No, he has been cooped up in his room watching TV and cartoons every day,”Chang Mang muttered.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and didn’t know what to say for a moment.

“It’s normal. To Tian Zong, everything is new,”pavilion master said.

“Let’s not talk about this anymore. Qin Yu, are you sure you can beat him?”Jiang he walked forward and interrupted the reminiscence of the past.

Qin Yu could not help but fall into silence.

After thinking for a moment, he said, “To be honest, when I was at the early-stage of the martial saint realm, I could only endure for 18 minutes even if I tried my best.”

“18 minutes?”Jiang he and the others looked at each other.

Qin Yu nodded. Then, he changed the topic and said, “However... that Almighty’s strength should be above Tian Zong’s.”

After all, that was the true body of the handlebar mustache!

The handlebar mustache was extremely mysterious. He even had a way to come to Earth from the Holy Region. It was definitely not something Tian Zong could compare to!

“Moreover... Tian Zong has just been born. He has been sealed for many years. I’m afraid that he won’t be able to display much of his strength. Killing him shouldn’t be a problem,”Qin Yu said quietly.
