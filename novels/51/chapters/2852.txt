Chapter 2853: The Eruption of the Two Ancient Powers

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The powers of creation still gave him some weak feedback.

If he could be more careful, he could probably use the Investiture of Gods to deduce the relevant power.

Suddenly, a warning sign erupted.

It was the seed of righteous qi. It was emitting a dangerous aura.

As Liu Bai waved his sleeves, a Spiritual Energy Sword had already swept past Qin Yu.

Then, it accurately slashed at the general who had just appeared a hundred meters away.

Boom!

A dull vibration rang out.

The Spiritual Energy Sword that could cut through the earth only left a deep cut on the general’s body.

“What a terrifying body!”

The general’s body slowly rose from the ground.

Bang!

In an instant, hundreds of punches had repelled Liu Bai’s sword.

The village chief slid to the front of the general. The black profound power enveloped the general like a wave.

The general’s speed became slower and slower as if it was trapped in the quagmire of order.

What kind of power was this? It seemed to be a type of peak power.

However, he had never seen such an amazing method before.

Liu Bai’s vision was the highest here. He could see the magical part of this attack at once.

A saber light flashed and the saber energy emitted a cicada-like buzz.

In an instant, this place was filled with endless saber energy.

The general’s body was suddenly cut into three pieces by the terrifying saber energy.

The expressionless head rolled on the ground, staring at everyone with burning eyes.

The eyes looked very strange as if the general’s scheme had succeeded.

Ding Ning expressionlessly stomped down, crushing the general’s head into pieces.

The ground shook and countless dust particles were blown away. A huge crack extended into the distance.

“No! I don’t sense the internal qi of the God Source or the Absolute Beginning Life Stone.”

Liu Bai narrowed his eyes.

A magnificent sword intent rose from the ground and shattered the entire ground.

Streams of invisible sword essence swam deep underground, completely breaking it.

The remaining two parts of the general’s body were connected to two visible passageways like puppets.

A puppet?

Or was it a trap?

Before Qin Yu could think about it carefully, a terrifying internal qi flashed through the passage.

It entered the two halves at almost the same time.

A burst of energy like a meteorite exploded in front of Ding Ning. This force was ten times stronger than before.

The destructive flames caused by the friction between the shock wave and it drowned the entire space.

Break!

In the sea of fire, Ding Ning’s saber was pressed against the center of the force.

His body slowly retreated and the flames surrounded his body.

It burned the saber into a living person. However, Ding Yu did not show any signs of movement in the flames.

How interesting! Heaven Saber!

The corners of his mouth curled into a smile. A terrifying saber light raged out from his saber.

In an instant, the internal qi on his body changed.

The saber intent made him like the god of this world. This saber was the judgment of heaven and earth on everyone.

Ding Ning’s Heaven Saber Intent.

The body of the general in front of him was split into two.

On the other hand, Liu Bai’s sword also defeated the attack from the other part of the general’s body.

However, he still couldn’t find the God Source and the Absolute Beginning Life Stone.

As the two halves of the body slowly sank into the sand, everything returned to normal.

This included the energy channel that had connected earlier.

Suddenly, the vital energy surged.

The energy underground suddenly began to flow at lightning speed. The speed was like a river that had burst its banks.

In an instant, the entire ground seemed to be about to explode.

“Oh no! I was wondering why it was so strange this time. The Power of the Ancients is about to erupt!”

Ding Yu soared into the sky almost without any hesitation.

“Let’s spread out. The Power of the Ancients has the terrifying power of stripping. This abnormal energy fluctuation is like this. Our number will attract its attention.”

Liu Bai reminded them and disappeared in front of everyone.

Qin Yu had read about the terrifying Power of the Ancients from the ancient records Cang Yunzi had given him. However, he did not expect to encounter it so soon after arriving here.

“Village chief!”

Qin Yu subconsciously turned around, only to find that the village chief had already run off.

Divine Embryo You had also disappeared long ago. This scene made Qin Yu’s hair stand on end.

The eruption of this Power of the Ancients was probably much more terrifying than he had imagined.

A terrifying fluctuation slowly squirmed on the ground as if some creature had awakened from the depths.

River into Land!

At this moment, Qin Yu could not be bothered to conserve peak power. He did not hesitate to carve out a passage.

Then, he appeared outside the Burial Heaven Cave.

The colors in the sky began to solidify. It was the energy that had gathered to the extreme.

The scene was very creepy. It looked like a fake space.

A layer of impenetrable fog appeared in the sky.

This ball of mist was extremely far from Qin Yu. Even his power of divine sense could not reach it.

However, there seemed to be a faint mournful sound in it.

When Qin Yu heard that voice, his divine soul seemed to have been pierced by countless steel needles.

An extreme sense of weakness surged uncontrollably throughout his entire body.

It wasn’t an illusion, but a true sense of weakness.

Ghost fog.

The two words appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

The Power of the Ancients’ ghost fog corresponded to weakness. No matter what kind of energy it was, it would feel very tired.

Then, one would be in an extremely dangerous situation when faced with the creatures that erupted with the Power of the Ancients.

It was an irresistible force.

Qin Yu could not analyze this power. Even if he used his Saint Power, he could not resist it at all.

He wanted to enter the passage but he could not sense it. He seemed to be suppressed.

His current state should only be a quarter of his previous state.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

If Cang Yunzi’s record was correct, a wave of monsters would erupt after the ghost fog. At that time, it would be his most dangerous situation.

The picturesque clouds in the sky slowly crossed each other, revealing a small part of the sky.

Streaks of blood-colored aurora slowly emerged from the gap.

The aurora’s rainbow instantly pierced through Qin Yu’s body. This kind of Power of the Ancients was simply unavoidable. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely grave. Was this the Power of the Ancients’ aurora?

The Power of the Ancients exploded this time containing two kinds of stripping power.

This had never happened in the Burial Heaven Cave before.

This time, the two powers appeared. Didn’t that mean that their situation here was extremely dangerous?

Moreover, the power of the aurora corresponded to the chaos of the power of the six roots.
