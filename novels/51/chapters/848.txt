Chapter 849: Chapter 849, the evil of the immortal slaying sect!

At this moment.

Under the island of the immortal slaying sect.

Elder Qian he and elder Qian he stood there and looked at the entrance coldly.

“The teleportation array that suddenly appeared must be the work of Qin Yu,”elder Qian he and elder Qian he said in a deep voice.

“It seems that this kid isn’t meticulous enough. Isn’t he leading the way for us by leaving such an entrance?”

The two looked at each other and prepared to step into the entrance.

“Wait.”At this moment, the eldest among the Qian and he elders, Long Mei, suddenly stopped in his tracks.

The other elder with a white beard frowned and asked, “What’s Wrong?”

Long Mei said in a deep voice, “This kid is very cunning. He left the entrance on purpose. I’m afraid he’s up to something.”

White Beard was silent for a moment and said, “Then what should we do?”

“How about this? You wait for me here. I’ll go and scout the way,”said Long Mei.

White Beard stopped long Mei and said in a deep voice, “I’ll go. If anything happens in the town, my chances of escaping are higher than yours.”

White Beard had mastered the wind formula of the eighteen characters formula and had cultivated it to the extreme. His speed was indeed much faster.

“Okay, be careful.”Long Mei nodded.

Then, white beard stepped into the teleportation array and entered the immortal Slayer sect!

As soon as he stepped into the immortal Slayer sect, White Beard felt something strange.

The atmosphere here was extremely strange. The air was mixed with traces of gloomy and cold internal Qi.

As far as the eye could see, the entire immortal Slayer sect was in ruins, as if someone had been here.

“What’s going on?”White beard frowned.

He released his spiritual sense, intending to search for Qin Yu.

However, at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of white beard.

This person was very young, dressed in black, and his entire body was exuding an extremely cold and gloomy internal Qi.

“Who are you?”White Beard’s expression changed, and he coldly berated.

The youth raised his eyebrows and indifferently said, “Who told you to come to the Church of the Massacre Immortal?”

When the white beard heard this, he couldn’t help but sneer, “I am a member of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. I can go wherever I want! How can you question me!”

“Jingdu martial arts association... HMM, they have indeed been quite powerful these years,”the youth muttered to himself.

“But... In my eyes, they are nothing more than this.”

The white beard berated, “Impudent! Junior, how dare you speak such arrogant words!”

The smile on the young man’s face began to slowly disappear.

“There is no tiger in the mountain, the monkey calls the king. A half-step nascent soul dares to come to the immortal Slayer sect to behave atrociously. The world has really changed...”the young man muttered in a low voice.

“Nascent soul? !”

Upon hearing this title, the white-bearded man’s face suddenly changed greatly!

In the current era, all martial artists called the nascent soul realm the martial saint realm!

But this person actually called the nascent soul realm. There was only one possibility! He was not from this era at all!

“You... What’s your relationship with the Immortal Massacre Sect?”White Beard suddenly had a bad premonition.

The young man grinned and said coldly, “There’s no harm in telling you. After all, you’re a person who’s about to die...”

“I’m a disciple of the immortal massacre sect. I was a genius of the immortal massacre sect back then. My Name Is Sky Blood Rainbow...”

“I had the chance to inherit the immortal Slayer sect, but unfortunately, the masked woman massacred the sect in one fell swoop...”

A hint of fear flashed across the young man’s face when he recalled these past events.

“One person massacred the entire sect of the number one sect in the world. How terrifying...”

“Fortunately, I relied on my secret technique and luckily managed to preserve my divine sense,”the young man continued.

“Although our immortal Slayer sect was destroyed, it was still the number one sect in the world. After so many people died, evil spirits naturally emerged.”

“The power of this evil spirit is incomparably terrifying. It was also one of the Immortal Slayer sect’s trump cards

“The masked woman seemed to know about this as well. Therefore, she left behind a coffin, two dao protectors, and her own clothes to suppress the Immortal Slayer sect in order to prevent any evil spirits from emerging

“Under her suppression, I thought that the evil power of the Immortal Slayer sect would be sealed underground for the rest of their lives. To my surprise, someone took away the coffin and allowed us to be reborn...”

Every word of the young man who called himself Sky Blood Rainbow was terrifying!

At this moment, White Beard’s face was extremely ugly!

“You... you said that you are a member of the Immortal Slayer sect! A person who has crossed over ten thousand years? !”White Beard was shocked, but at the same time, he was extremely suspicious!

Because in this world, no one could cross over ten thousand years! Even a great cultivator at the tribulation stage couldn’t do it!

Tian Xuehong smiled faintly and said, “Don’t be surprised. Of course, I can’t Cross Ten Thousand Years.”

“My spiritual sense has already experienced many reincarnations. I just relied on a secret technique to awaken a part of my memory.”

“It’s ironic that this secret technique was created by the masked woman. TSK TSK.”

At this point, Tian Xuehong looked at Bai Xu and smiled. “Of course, this body of mine has lived for 1600 years.”

Bai Xu became more and more confused as he listened.

Even the JINGDU martial arts association could not do such a secret technique!

“Forget it. You probably won’t understand what I’m saying.”Tian Xuehong grinned.

“You only need to know that I’ve successfully obtained the power of the immortal slaying sect, as well as the evil being suppressed...”

As he spoke, Tian Xuehong raised his hand.

In an instant, more than ten withered bones crawled out from the ground!

Although these withered bones did not have spiritual sense, each of them was at the Almighty Realm. They were definitely not something a half-step martial saint could contend against!

Looking at the dozens of withered bones that crawled out, white beard could not help but take two steps back.

He gritted his teeth and glared angrily at Tian Xuehong. he shouted loudly, “What nonsense are you spouting! What 1,600 years? This is all made up by you, right?”

“The Massacre Immortal sect was the number one sect in the world at that time. How could it be massacred by one person? Why Don’t you write a novel instead?”

Tian xuehong laughed and said, “Yeah, I think it’s impossible too. How did she manage to massacre the entire massacre immortal sect by herself? The once prosperous massacre immortal sect was actually destroyed by a woman...” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“F * ck you, you’re full of nonsense! What Evil Spirit? What Genius? You’re just trying to buy time for that Qin Yu!”

“I’ll kill you right now and then go find that Qin Yu!”
