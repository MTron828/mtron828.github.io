1934 Good Deed Sect

“Why is that so?” Qin Yu was even more confused.

The elderly man glanced at Qin Yu and said, “It’s very rare to step into the Immortal Emperor realm. Of course, this isn’t the main point. The main point is that Lord Zhu and Immortal Emperor Tianming lived in the same era, which means he’s destined not to be able to become the most powerful person in the world.”

Immortal Emperor Tianming! Yan Tianming! The most powerful Immortal Emperor of the Yan family!

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. Yan Tianming’s power was needless to say. He had single-handedly turned the eight aristocratic families into nine. That was enough to prove how terrifying he was.

Soon, the two left Luminous City and walked into the distance.

A mountain forest was in front of them. It was not an ordinary forest, but the Azure Rock Forest occupied the largest area in Holy Region.

“We still have not arrived yet?” Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

The old man pointed at the Azure Rock Forest and said, “It’s right in front.”

“In the Azure Rock Forest?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

“That’s right,” the elderly man nodded and said.

This instantly reminded Qin Yu of his experience near the Azure Rock Forest!

That time, Qin Yu gathered a piece of important information at an auction nearby the Azure Rock Forest. Someone would come out of the depths of the Azure Rock Forest, and whenever they came out, they would bring out a rare treasure.

Was this old man from the depths of the Azure Rock Forest?

Qin Yu instantly became excited. There were many legends about the depths of the Azure Rock Forest. As for what kind of existence was there, no one knew. Even the nine great aristocratic families did not have any information!

As Qin Yu was thinking, the two stepped into the Azure Rock Forest.

The old man waved his hand, and an internal qi emerged from his palm.

This internal qi enveloped the two of them, falling on their bodies.

“What is this?” Qin Yu asked, confused.

“It’s a special internal qi. As long as you’re tainted by it, you won’t be detected by the Demonic Beast,” the elderly man said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu suddenly understood and said in a low voice, “No wonder you guys can stay safe and sound in the notorious Azure Rock Forest.”

This made Qin Yu even more suspicious of their identities.

Why were these people hiding in the depths of the Azure Rock Forest and not coming out? Were they hidden experts?

As Qin Yu was lost in his thoughts, a huge mountain appeared in front of them.

Although this mountain range was merged with the surroundings, it was not a real mountain upon closer look, but rather, it was cast from a magical artifact.

“It’s right in front,” the elderly man pointed at the mountain and said.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but mutter, “This can’t be considered the depths. At most, we’re just out of the periphery. So they weren’t hiding in the depths.”

The elderly man ignored Qin Yu’s words and stepped into the mountain with him.

After stepping in, a special smell immediately assailed his nose.

This scent was exactly the same as the one from the elderly man’s palm.

In the mountain range, it was a whole new world. The darkness he had imagined did not exist, but light instead.

As soon as Qin Yu stepped in, the mountain gate suddenly closed, and several people stepped out from the dark.

They were different from the elderly man. They seemed to be wearing the same clothes, and the huge word “kindness” was written on them.

“He’s really doing good deeds.” Seeing this, Qin Yu was even more convinced of his thoughts.

“Greetings, Seniors.” Thinking of all the good deeds they did, Qin Yu couldn’t help but bow to show his respect.

However, at this moment, the elderly man’s expression suddenly changed. He sneered and said, “You’re quite polite, young kid.”

Qin Yu still didn’t notice anything strange. He smiled and said, “The great deeds of the seniors are indeed worthy of admiration.”

“Great deeds?” the old man sneered and said. “Kid, is that you who are crazy, or we? Where did the heavenly holy stone in your hand come from? Tell me the truth!”

The echo was mixed with their loud waves of laughter, inevitably making people feel a little annoyed.

Qin Yu frowned and said with confusion, “Seniors, why are you all laughing like this?”

“Great deeds?” the old man sneered and said. “Kid, is that you who are crazy or we are? Where did the heavenly holy stone in your hand come from? tell me the truth!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. At this moment, he finally realized something was wrong.

“Senior, what do you mean by this?” Qin Yu squinted his eyes and quietly adjusted the internal qi in his body.

“You have 20 heavenly holy stones,” the old man said with a cold face. “That’s not a small amount. You must have other treasures, right? Hand all of them over!”

Qin Yu’s face gradually turned cold. He glanced at the crowd and said with a faint smile, “Take out the money, and I’ll certainly give you the items.”

“Hahaha!” The old man could not help but laugh. “50 billion? You really f*cking dare to take it! All of us combined would only have a few tens of billions, and you want to empty us? You must have gone crazy!”

“When doing business, the price should be clearly marked. One is willing to pay, and the other to take. Since you think the price is not suitable, I will leave now,” Qin Yu said.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

At this moment, the old man waved his hand, and the space in front of him was immediately distorted.

“You want to leave now? I’m afraid it’s too late. Leave the things behind, and we might consider leaving your corpse intact,” the old man said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned. “Who are you?”

“We are the famous Good Deed Sect! Do you want to take away something that’s already in our hands? You’re dreaming!” the old man shouted.

“So, you’re all robbers?” Qin Yu sneered.

“You can say that.” The old man didn’t feel embarrassed at all. Instead, he was proud of himself.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, ” I can give you the things, but you must let me go. You must at least have some professional ethics, right?”

...

“You’re dreaming. If I let you go, our place will definitely be exposed,” the old man said with a cold face.

Qin Yu glanced around and asked tentatively, “So you’ve been hiding here for a long time? I guess there must be a lot of treasures here?”

“What does it have to do with you?” the old man raised his eyebrows and said with a vague smile.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Nothing. I just want to see how capable you are. You’ve been hiding here for so long. You can’t even be considered robbers if you didn’t get any treasures.”

“Kid, have you really not heard of our Good Deed Sect?” At this time, a cultivator behind the old man shouted.

Before Qin Yu could answer, the old man waved his hand and said, “This kid is a young man. He hasn’t even heard of Lord Zhu. Probably he has just arrived here.”

“No wonder.” The others came to a realization. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The old man squinted his eyes and said, “Kid, you’ve asked so many questions. What do you want?” Are you going to hand the things over, or do you want us to do it?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and smiled. “How about this? Give me all the treasures and money in this cave, and I’ll let you go.”
