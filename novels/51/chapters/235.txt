Chapter 236: You Don’t Believe Me? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After feeling the power of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, Qin Yu looked forward to the future even more.

He couldn’t wait to advance to the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm!

With his chaotic body constitution, what did Qin Yu have to fear?

After that, Qin Yu restrained his internal qi and looked no different from an ordinary person.

“With the strength of this ancestor, I will definitely obtain this divine herb.” Qin Yu sneered inside.

In the evening, Yao Qing returned to Bai City from the Jiang family’s home.

He held many herbs in his hands.

“Mr. Qin, the seven Divine Sect Pills have been swept clean. These are herbs.” Yao Qing handed these few herbs to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at them. They were all herbs that were more than a hundred years old.

“These people are really rich.” Qin Yu stared at these herbs and couldn’t help but mutter softly.

A crazy thought flashed through his mind.

If he were to plunder all the aristocratic families in the world, how many herbs would there be?

Of course, this was just a thought. Qin Yu wouldn’t do such a despicable thing.

“Mr. Qin, Jiang Gu said that the Divine Sect Pills will definitely be in short supply. He asked me to ask you, do you have additional Divine Sect Pills?” Yao Qing said.

Qin Yu said, “As long as they exchange it for herbs, they can have as many as they want.”

Yao Qing nodded and said, “I understand.”

In the next few days, Qin Yu began to refine the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.

Since the Nine Transformation Golden Pill was said to be an Earth Rank medicinal pill, the refining method was naturally extremely complicated.

If not for the current Qin Yu having the strength of a Inner Strength Grandmaster, it was likely that he wouldn’t have succeeded in refining the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.

For three whole days, Qin Yu sat in his room without leaving.

The spiritual fire in his hand was almost exhausted, but the Nine Transformation Golden Pill had just taken shape.

Another three days passed.

On this day, dark clouds suddenly appeared in the sky.

The dark clouds blotted out the sky and the sun. Thunder rumbled loudly with a deafening sound.

“Strange, it’s almost winter. How can there be thunder?” The people of Bai City couldn’t help but mutter.

“It seems like the heavens want to punish us. Strange things have been happening more and more these past few years.”

“Tsk tsk, this is the result of humans destroying the environment.”

Everyone stared at this strange scene and discussed it animatedly. At this moment, Dong Tianhai was also looking up at this strange scene in Yihe Winery.

“Master, the sky was clear just a moment ago. Why is it suddenly going to rain?” His disciple frowned and asked.

Dong Tianhai watched this scene and didn’t say a word.

Rumble..

The thunder in the sky was brewing, and within the dark clouds, there was actually a hint of auspicious color!

“Could it be... could it be that an Earth Rank Pill has appeared?” Dong Tianhai suddenly thought of something!

“Earth Rank Pill?” His disciple was even more stunned.

“There’s someone in Bai City who can refine an Earth Rank pill?”

Dong Tianhai didn’t say anything. He raised his head and with his eyes filled with fanaticism, he stared at the sky!

“Could it be... Qin Yu?” Soon, Qin Yu’s figure flashed across Dong Tianhai’s mind!

“Master, don’t joke around. How could Qin Yu have such an ability?” The disciple sneered.

Dong Tianhai also felt that it was unlikely.

If Qin Yu really had such ability, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would have invited him long ago. Why would he stay in the insignificant Chuzhou?

“Rumble!”

Finally, a bolt of lightning descended!

A large hole was opened in Qin Yu’s house!

Lightning flashed, thunder rumbled, and sparks kept on flying.

A terrifying power burst out in front of Qin Yu!

A golden-shimmering pill flew out from the container!

It was as if the pill had its own spiritual sense, and the pill actually wanted to escape!

“Want to escape?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. He waved his hand, and a strong power grabbed the pill in his hand!

The Nine Transformation Golden Pill struggled in Qin Yu’s palm for a long time, but it finally calmed down slowly.

Qin Yu opened his palm and saw a pearl-sized pill lying in his palm.

The pill looked unremarkable and ordinary. It was a stark contrast from the brilliant golden light just now.

“This is the Nine Transformation Golden Pill?” Even Qin Yu was a little suspicious for a moment.

After such a big commotion, this was it?

Qin Yu glanced at the Nine Transformation Golden Pill recorded in the inheritance. As expected, it was exactly like this.

“It’s done.” Qin Yu put away the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.

However, at this moment, he was a little sleepy, so he didn’t rush to find Dong Tianhai. Instead, he laid on the bed and fell into a deep sleep.

The next day, Qin Yu took this Nine Transformation Golden Pill and got up to rush to the Yihe Winery.

Inside the winery, Dong Tianhai and a few disciples were preparing to leave for the Martial Arts Association.

“There’s only a week left until the Divine Medicine is born. I believe that many aristocratic families have already come to Bai City,” Dong Tianhai said in a sullen voice.

“Master, we have to go and investigate. This Divine Medicine must not fall into the hands of others,” the disciple said.

Dong Tianhai nodded. Then, the few of them walked out of the Yihe Winery.

Just as they walked out of the door, they bumped into Qin Yu.

“Why are you here again?” After seeing Qin Yu, the two disciples looked extremely impatient.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to them, but looked at Dong Tianhai.

“Mr. Dong, are you going out?” Qin Yu asked politely.

Dong Tianhai nodded and said, “Are you looking for me for something?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m here to deliver something to you.”

“Deliver something?” Dong Tianhai raised his eyebrows, as if he was a little surprised.

Qin Yu didn’t say much further. He took out the Nine Transformation Golden Pill and handed it to Dong Tianhai. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Speaking of which, I really can’t bear to part with it,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“But you and I have an agreement in advance. I’ll hand this pill to you,” Qin Yu said reluctantly.

Dong Tianhai took the Nine Transformation Golden Pill. He placed it under the sunlight and carefully examined it. Then, he frowned and said, “What is this thing?”

Qin Yu was stunned and quickly said, “Nine Transformation Golden Pill.”

“Nine Transformation Golden Pill?” Dong Tianhai was stunned and then laughed out loud.

“You said this thing is a Nine Transformation Golden Pill?” His two disciples laughed even louder.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, why are you all laughing?”

His disciple sneered and said, “You have the nerve to ask? Why? You take a piece of trash and say it is a Nine Transformation Golden Pill?”

Qin Yu frowned, and a hint of displeasure flashed across his face.

However, he didn’t flare up. Instead, he watched Dong Tianhai.

“Mr. Dong, this is indeed a Nine Transformation Golden Pill,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice.

Dong Tianhai stuffed the pill back to Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you’d better take it yourself,” Dong Tianhai said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Mr. Dong, you don’t believe me either?”

Dong Tianhai seemed to be a little impatient.

He said with a cold expression, “Qin Yu, as someone who has been through life, I have to give you a word of advice.”

“You are not the only smart person in this world.”

“Don’t treat others as fools, especially smart people!”

“Also, bluffing while riding on other people’s coattails will be exposed sooner or later! Without real talent, you won’t get far in life!”
