Chapter 745: Granny Qin VS Tang Sheng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The wailing gave people goosebumps all over.

Chou Heguang still wanted to explain, but Granny Qin didn’t give him a chance. She directly raised her palm and slapped Chou Heguang’s head!

Crack!

The slap directly shattered Chou Heguang’s head!

Granny Qin’s expression was gloomy as she clenched her teeth tightly.

“Granny Qin, what should we do now?” Asked a purple-robed man.

Granny Qin took a deep breath and said, “The 10,000-year-old herb is of great importance. We can’t give up just like that.”

“Follow me to the Tang Clan and ask for it!” Said Granny Qin coldly.

The purple-robed man next to her frowned and said, “Granny Qin, the Tang Clan is not to be trifled with. It is said that they have secretly developed their own forces and nurtured several Martial Marquises. Moreover, they have a large number of Elders.”

Granny Qin glanced at the purple-robed man and couldn’t help but grit her teeth and say, “How did Qu Xie go his job?! He actually allowed the Tang family to develop to such a scale!”

“After all, the Tang City is at the border. President Qu couldn’t do anything about it,” said the purple-robed man helplessly.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association relied on the local association to supervise it.

However, the local association would usually join forces with the local aristocratic families.

This also meant that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had no way to interfere with the local martial arts families.

“Go and try it. I will give them sufficient compensation,” Granny Qin said coldly.

A stalk of ten-thousand-year-old herb was of great importance, but to Granny Qin, the most important thing was that the herb couldn’t fall into Qin Yu’s hands.

...

At this time, Qin Yu had already rushed back to the Tang family with Tang Mo and the others.

“Qin Yu, you can stay here in peace,” Tang Mo patted his chest and said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Young Master Tang, thank you very much. This favor...”

“Alright, no need to say more,” Tang Mo interrupted Qin Yu.

Having said that, Qin Yu would never forget the kindness of the Tang family.

Therefore, he got up and followed Tang Mo to see Tang Sheng.

The reason why Tang Sheng was willing to help Qin Yu was also because of Qin Yu’s potential.

Over the years, the Tang family had developed rapidly. Relying on their own strength, they constantly expanded their own force.

Tang Sheng had invested in countless martial artists, and these people were all people with great potential.

As long as one of them had extraordinary achievements, the Tang family wouldn’t fall for decades.

It had to be said that although Tang Sheng was vain, he was also sharp.

“Mr. Tang, I reckon Granny Qin will definitely come to the Tang family to ask for it,” Qin Yu said with a bit of worry.

Tang Sheng waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry. Since I’ve promised you, I won’t go back on my word.”

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Thank you very much, Mr. Tang.”

Just as he said that, someone ran in from outside.

“Master, there’s someone who calls herself Granny Qin who wants to see you,” said the attendant with a bow.

“Hmph, they came really fast,” Tang Mo couldn’t help but snort from the side.

Tang Sheng smiled and said, “Let them come in. I also want to see Granny Qin.”

A few minutes later, Granny Qin strode in with eight purple-robed men.

When Granny Qin saw Qin Yu sitting in the hall, her expression instantly turned cold.

“Humph!” Granny Qin snorted coldly and then sat opposite Qin Yu.

As for the eight purple-robed men, they stood behind Granny Qin.

Granny Qin looked up at Tang Sheng and said, “Mr. Tang, please leave Qin Yu to us. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely remember your favor.”

Tang Sheng ignored her words and said, “Are you that Granny Qin?”

Granny Qin said, “Yes, I’m one of the real power holders of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Tang Sheng sneered. “You’re the one who belittled the Tang family? You called the Tang family monkeys?”

Granny Qin’s expression changed. She looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “This is all a trap set by that b*stard Qin Yu!”

“F * ck!” Tang Mo cursed.

“You really know how to act. If I hadn’t personally witnessed it, I would have really been deceived by you!”

Granny Qin’s expression turned cold. As a big shot of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, when had she ever suffered such humiliation?

So what if she was facing a local overlord? It was simply impossible to make her lower her head!

“Mr. Tang, I know that the Tang family has great power in the local area, but I have to remind you that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is the official organization of the martial arts world,” Granny Qin said coldly.

“If you’re willing to hand Qin Yu over to me, I can let the Tang family become the President of the Tang City’s Association. The martial arts world of Tang City will be handed over to you.”

“Otherwise... the Tang family will become our enemy!”

Granny Qin threatened and enticed, yet her posture was still high and mighty.

Tang Sheng couldn’t help but sneer. “Do you think the Tang family is scared? The Tang family has been in charge of Tang City for more than 500 years, so how could I be afraid of you?”

Upon hearing this, Granny Qin frowned again.

More than 500 years?

In other words, the Tang family was a martial arts aristocratic family with a deep heritage!

No wonder they had so many resources!

While she was surprised, a trace of greed also arose in Granny Qin’s heart.

How many resources did a 500-year-old aristocratic family have? How could the Jingdu Martial Arts Association miss such a resource?

“Mr. Tang, are you sure you won’t agree?” Granny Qin slowly got up.

Tang Sheng sneered. “The reason I agreed to see you is because I want to see how arrogant you are.”

“Well then!” Granny Qin raised her shriveled hand and clapped.

“Let me tell you one thing. No matter what kind of resources you have, they aren’t worth mentioning in front of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“I’d like to see how long the Tang family can be arrogant for!”

After saying this, Granny Qin got up and left.

Tang Sheng didn’t stop her. He watched Granny Qin’s back as she left and couldn’t help but snort coldly. “So what if it’s the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? I’m not afraid of them in Tang City!”

Qin Yu, on the other hand, said with a bit of worry, “Mr. Tang, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is indeed not to be trifled with. You’d better be careful.”

Tang Sheng waved his hand and said, “I won’t dare to offend them in other places, but in Tang City, they are nothing!”

“Qin Yu, just go into seclusion in peace. They can’t do anything to you,” Tang Mo patted his chest and said.

Qin Yu got up and bowed again to express his gratitude.

The Tang family had long arranged a room for Qin Yu and the others. The room was very large and had a vast courtyard.

“The Tang family is simply the local emperor of Tang City,” the man with the mustache couldn’t help but sigh.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I have a feeling that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association won’t let this matter rest so easily.”

The man with the mustache curled his lips and said, “Don’t worry too much. Since the Tang family has already stepped in to help, there’s no use regretting it.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. Then, he looked at the man with the mustache and said with a smile, “I also owe you a favor.”

“You owe me a lot of favors,” the man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said.

“Granny Qin, the Tang family is so arrogant. Are we just going to let it go like this?” A purple-robed man asked with a frown.

Granny Qin said with a sullen look, “Let it go? Humph, I’m very interested in the resources of the Tang family!”

“After this is over, I will apply to the higher-ups to exterminate the Tang family!”
