Chapter 1589: Chapter 1,589, Super Strong Foundation 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

There were four godly monarchs and eight venerables in the northern lands.

And the eight venerables were the most powerful people below the four godly monarchs.

Although their strength was inferior to the four godly monarchs, they were not to be underestimated, even above the eternal limit.

But such an expert actually died just like that. How could they not be shocked.

“Qin Yu... he killed the eight venerables so quickly...”the people guarding the ancestral hall could not help but reveal expressions of shock.

“Looks like we misjudged Qin Yu’s strength...”

“This matter must be reported to the godly monarch immediately. All of you wait here. I’ll go report it.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

These people naturally did not know of Xiao Yu’s existence. They only knew that the eight venerables had been instantly killed.

This was definitely a huge loss to the northern lands.

...

Qin Yu rushed back to the tavern. After finishing the remaining food, he summoned the Divine Eagle and rushed towards ye Nan’s residence.

This place was not too far from ye Nan’s residence. On the way, Qin Yu’s mind was filled with the words that Xiao Yu had said.

Do not step into the Central Plains until you have reached the reversion void stage.

Originally, Qin Yu had planned to think of a way to head to the central plains after settling the matters in the northern lands.

But now, it was as if he had been struck on the head, causing Qin Yu to be at a loss.

Yan Ruoxue’s figure appeared in his mind. The two of them had not seen each other for a long time. This longing buried deep in his heart was tormenting Qin Yu all the time.

“Central Plains...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, a trace of determination appearing in his eyes.

Xiao Yu’s growth speed had truly shocked Qin Yu.

And the people of Chang Mang, who had arrived at the Holy Region before Qin Yu, had probably already made a name for themselves.

They were all top-notch geniuses and were definitely not inferior to anyone. Who knew how many sects would fight to nurture them.

“It’s time for me to speed up my cultivation,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He closed his eyes slightly and began to absorb the spiritual Qi from the surroundings.

The Secrets of the northern lands also made Qin Yu curious and obsessed.

Xiao Hai wasn’t the only one who wanted the death river to disappear. Qin Yu was the same.

After a long time, they finally saw a grotto-heaven in the mountain range that filled the sky.

This could be considered a true grotto-heaven blessed land. Not only did it have an excellent geographical location, but it was also not disturbed by anyone.

On the huge stone door, there was a huge “Ye”written on it, indicating the identity of the owner of the grotto-heaven.

Qin Yu jumped down from the Divine Eagle and arrived at the entrance of the grotto-heaven.

At the entrance stood two green-faced, fanged people. Their appearances were extremely terrifying and ugly, causing people to Shudder in fear.

The aura emitted from their bodies was even more bizarre than the internal QI.

This internal Qi didn’t seem to come from a human cultivator at all.

“Please report that I was sent by senior Xiao Hai to visit Senior Ye,”Qin Yu said politely.

The two guards at the door glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Mr. Ye doesn’t want to see any guests.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Please report that I have something important to ask of you.”

The guard glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Young man, you don’t seem to know the rules.”

Qin Yu was stunned and said, “What rules?”

The two men sneered and said, “Why should we inform you?”

Qin Yu was stunned and quickly understood what the two men meant.

Therefore, Qin Yu took out a stack of spirit coins and handed it to the two men.

“I’ll have to trouble the two of you to help inform them,”Qin Yu said.

The two of them knocked the spirit coins to the ground and sneered, “Are you trying to send away beggars?”

“F * ck me...”Qin Yu was immediately enraged. However, he had a favor to ask, so he could only suppress his anger and said, “How much do you want?”

“At least take out a desired babe, right?”The two of them said coldly.

Qin Yu had no other choice. He could only take out a few pills from the spatial magic artifact and pass them to them.

The two took the pill and examined it carefully. Then, they snorted and said, “Wait here.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu immediately had a very bad impression of ye Nan.

As expected, the superior was superior, but the inferior was crooked.

Ye Nan was probably not a good person.

A few minutes later, these two extremely ugly people walked out.

“Go in. Walk straight from here and you will be able to see Master Ye.”The two people said.

Qin Yu did not say much and immediately took large strides into this grotto-heaven.

This place was a blessed land. The halo passed through the trees and sprinkled down, leaving behind spots of extremely beautiful marks on the ground.

The decorations on both sides were made of natural beautiful jade and divine stone. They were extremely luxurious.

After passing through this alley, one could see an extremely grand residence at the end.

This was the most luxurious building Qin Yu had seen since he stepped into the holy region.

The entire great hall flickered with a golden color. Although it was a little tacky, it was full of heroism.

A round table was placed in the great hall. The entire round table was black ink in color. It was clearly made from the best quality inkstone.

A middle-aged man was sitting there drinking tea.

What was shocking was that his tea leaf was actually enlightenment tea!

Qin Yu immediately turned pale with fright. Just what kind of character was this ye Nan? And just how many treasures were hidden in the entire grotto-heaven?

Seeing Qin Yu walking over, ye Nan waved his hand and said with a smile, “Are you guys introduced by Xiao Hai?”

Qin Yu retracted his divine sense and said politely, “Greetings, senior Ye. I Am Qin Yu.”

“Oh, why are you looking for me?”Ye Nan poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was shocked. This was the Enlightenment Tea, a treasure!

Therefore, Qin Yu lifted the cup of tea in one go. A refreshing feeling went straight to his mind!

“It really is the Enlightenment tea,”Qin Yu said in surprise.

The effect of the Enlightenment tea was much better than that of the great Yue fruit!

Ye nan laughed and said, “It’s just the Enlightenment tea. I have many more at home. They were all given to me by others.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh, “Senior Ye’s background is really shocking.”

At this time, Ye Nan changed the topic and said, “Since you came to me for help, what do you plan to give me?”

Qin Yu was stunned, then he smiled and said, “I don’t know what senior ye needs.”

Ye Nan raised his eyebrows. He looked at Qin Yu’s spatial magic artifact and said, “How would I know what you have?”

At this point, he waved his hand and said, “Forget it. Tell me what you want me to do first.”

Qin Yu quickly told ye Nan what had happened.

“This is a major matter that involves the southern prefecture and the northern lands. Senior Ye, please help me out.”Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

Ye Nan impatiently waved his hand and said, “Let me see what you have in your spatial magic artifact.”

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. After all, it was only right for him to give something in return for asking for help.

Thus, Qin Yu took out all the items in the spatial magic artifact, including the bracelet that Xiao Yu gave him, as well as Huang Ji Fo Yan and all the other treasures.
