Chapter 1120: Chapter 1120, the birth of a mighty figure! 

With the aid of the desolate God’s eye, Qin Yu’s line of sight penetrated the darkness of the sea, looking down at a distance of 1,000 meters!

What surprised Qin Yu was that even with the aid of the desolate God’s eye, his line of sight could not reach too far.

Through the desolate God’s eye, he seemed to have discovered faint traces of humanity under the sea!

“Oh?”Qin Yu’s pupils constricted as he stared down.

However, his vision was too blurry. He could only see a vague outline.

This outline was vague, like a mirage. Qin Yu did not dare to be sure.

“If I get closer, I will definitely be able to see clearly!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said in a low voice.

He took a deep breath and controlled his body to sink down again.

“Bang Bang!”

At this moment, cracks started to appear on Qin Yu’s Green Wood True Body, and it was on the verge of shattering at any moment!

“Crack!”

With a crisp sound, the green wood true body finally couldn’t take it anymore!

“Not good!”

Qin Yu’s face was filled with horror. He hurriedly circulated his spiritual power and quickly swam upwards! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He swam up for several hundred meters in one breath before the cracks on his body started to ease up. Then, it slowly stopped.

Qin Yu looked at the Golden and green light that was about to shatter on his body. He could not help but feel a lingering fear.

“That was close...”Qin Yu wiped the sweat that was dripping from his forehead.

If he was a step slower, this azure wood true body would probably completely explode!

At that time, he would definitely die. He reckoned that even his primordial spirit would not be able to escape!

Qin Yu’s eyes stared downwards as he said in a low voice, “What a pity. I was just one step away...”

It was a pity that time was too short. Otherwise, Qin Yu could have tried to raise his azure wood true body’s realm before continuing to sink.

However, there was not much time left for Qin Yu. He could only enter seclusion as soon as possible and try to break through.

“I don’t know how long it will take to break through this time. If there really is a world under the sea, it will exist for many years without anyone paying attention to it. There’s no rush,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

It would be a good choice to go down and explore it after his strength had increased.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it.

He rose hundreds of meters again and found a suitable location. He took out the heaven origin pill from the spatial divine weapon and prepared to break through.

Dozens of heaven origin pills were in Qin Yu’s spatial divine weapon. As Qin Yu’s divine sense moved, he stuffed the pills into his mouth one by one.

Surging Spiritual Qi surged out from his Dantian and then spread throughout his body.

Qin Yu activated his mental cultivation method and began his seclusion this time.

...

In the outside world, no one knew that Qin Yu had already entered seclusion.

The Heaven Gate was quiet and peaceful. All the disciples were cultivating methodically.

Now that Qin Yu was famous throughout the world, the Heaven Gate naturally rose with him.

On this day.

Pavilion master suddenly appeared in the sky above the Heaven Gate.

Jiang he immediately noticed pavilion master’s figure. He opened his eyes, and with a shake of his feet, he instantly appeared in front of Pavilion Master.

“Ji Yuhong, why are you here?”Jiang he asked quietly.

Pavilion master slightly bowed to Jiang he, and then slowly said, “Qin Yu is in closed-door cultivation.”

“Oh?”Jiang he was slightly surprised.

Pavilion master slightly sighed and said, “Qin Yu offended a sleeping mighty figure on Cloud Dragon Island. This must be a disaster.”

“At this time, Qin Yu is in closed-door cultivation. It is very likely that he will lead the disaster to the Heaven Gate.”

Jiang he also said with a slightly solemn expression, “That’s right. If we can’t find Qin Yu, the Heaven Gate will be the first to bear the Brunt.”

“Then you came here... to protect the Heaven Gate?”Jiang he asked in surprise.

Pavilion master shook his head and said, “With my strength, I’m not worth mentioning in front of a mighty figure.”

“Then what are you doing?”Jiang he was even more puzzled.

Pavilion master smiled and said, “There will always be someone who wants to be a lobbyist. I’ll think of a way to stop him from killing the innocent.”

“Can you persuade him?”Jiang he shook his head.

“I don’t know. I have to try,”pavilion master said indifferently.

“Even if I can’t persuade him, I can guarantee that I will treat the injured at the first opportunity.”

Hearing this, Jiang he couldn’t help but sigh and say, “Ji Yuhong, are you Qin Yu’s nanny? You are really meticulous.”

In this regard, pavilion master didn’t express his position. He just smiled and didn’t say anything.

The day of the Almighty’s birth was getting closer and closer, so the time left for Qin Yu was naturally getting shorter and shorter.

Under the sea, Qin Yu’s body was shrouded in darkness. Naturally, it was not just the sun and moon.

He could only activate his mental cultivation method to raise his cultivation base as quickly as possible.

However, even with the support of circulating his mental cultivation method, Qin Yu’s speed was still very slow.

For a whole three days, Qin Yu had only absorbed eighteen heavenly origin pills.

The internal Qi in his body was soaring rapidly. However, he was still quite a distance away from the middle stage of the martial saint stage.

Qin Yu’s special physique had caused him to consume a huge amount of spiritual qi. If it was an ordinary person, these eighteen heavenly origin pills would be enough to allow him to step into the intermediate stage of the martial saint stage.

At this moment, on the Cloud Dragon Island.

Yun Long was kneeling at the entrance of a cave. He was quietly waiting for the birth of this mighty figure.

Another two days passed.

The Cloud Dragon Island, which had always been quiet, suddenly erupted with lightning and thunder. The surface of the sea was filled with raging waves.

The sudden arrival of the heavy rain seemed to indicate that something extraordinary was going to happen today.

Cloud Dragon raised his head and looked at the dark clouds in the sky.

The heavy rain fell on his face and rolled down his cheeks.

“Boom!”

At this moment, there was a loud sound in the sky. It was a bolt of lightning that cut through the dark sky!

The huge cave in front of him also began to rumble. Huge Rocks rolled down!

Kacha

Countless rocks shattered in an instant. Finally, the cave could not withstand the pressure and exploded!

Another bolt of lightning!

Under the weak light of the lightning, Yun long clearly saw a figure walking out from the ruins of the cave!

This person had a hunched figure, but he had the bearing of an emperor. He had the aura of a tiger that could swallow ten thousand miles!

Finally, all the internal Qi calmed down, and the heavy rain stopped.

“Welcome master to the world!”Yun long knelt on the ground and shouted repeatedly!
