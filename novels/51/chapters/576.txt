Chapter 577: Qin Yu VS Yan Jinyao Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Qin Yu!”

The moment they saw the young man, everyone in the room stood up!

Yan Sihai’s expression was even colder. He sized up Qin Yu and snorted coldly. “How dare you come to the Yan family? Are you tired of living?”

Qin Yu walked straight to Yan Sihai. He looked down at Yan Sihai and said, “Go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and save Yan Ruoxue, right now.”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Yan Sihai couldn’t help but want to laugh.

He snorted coldly and said, “Qin Yu, are you crazy? Are you ordering me?”

“You can think of it this way.” Qin Yu’s killing intent wasn’t concealed at all.

Yan Sihai narrowed his eyes and said, “What if I don’t?”

“Then I will kill you.” With that said, Qin Yu raised his hand and pounced at Yan Sihai!

As a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster, Yan Sihai naturally wouldn’t just sit around and wait for his death!

Yan Sihai clenched his fists and charged forward!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, Yan Sihai’s body was sent flying and crashed into the wall!

A mouthful of fresh blood spewed out from his mouth!

Seeing this scene, everyone gasped!

They didn’t expect that Qin Yu would actually dare to make a move!

“Qin Yu, you’re courting death!” Yan Sihai was instantly enraged!

Qin Yu took a step forward and kicked Yan Sihai’s chest with hatred!

This kick caused Yan Sihai, who was just about to get up, to fall to the ground again!

Qin Yu’s foot stepped on Yan Sihai’s chest and said coldly, “So what if you’re rich? You only have one life.”

“I want to kill you now, and your wealth can’t help you.”

Yan Sihai had never suffered such humiliation. He struggled with all his might, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“Qin Yu, don’t be rash!” Yan Yongxiu said hurriedly.

Qin Yu ignored him. He looked at Yan Sihai coldly and said word by word, “Call them and ask them to release her.”

Yan Sihai sneered. “Don’t even think about it! Qin Yu, you have no idea what you’re doing! Kill me, and I guarantee that you won’t live past tomorrow!”

“Then let’s die together!” Qin Yu suddenly increased the strength of his feet!

Yan Sihai felt as if his chest was being pressed down by a huge mountain. He was in great pain!

“Release her!” Qin Yu shouted angrily.

Yan Sihai was unmoved. He sneered and said, “If you have the ability, then kill me. Kill me, and Yan Ruoxue will never come out!”

“You’re courting death!” Qin Yu’s body immediately flashed with light. His heart was filled with killing intent!

“Qin Yu, stop!” Yan Yongxiu shouted anxiously from the side. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, Qin Yu couldn’t care less anymore. As long as he thought of the scene in the prison, Qin Yu’s blood would boil!

At this moment, a ray of light suddenly shot over from behind!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He hurriedly turned around and met it with a punch!

“Boom!”

The entire room immediately erupted with a terrifying wave of air!

The four brothers of the Yan family were sent flying!

Qin Yu coldly looked at the person who had arrived at the door. A trace of battle intent appeared in his eyes!

“Yan Jinyao!” Qin Yu roared, and a burst of intense internal qi immediately erupted from his body!

Yan Jinyao wasn’t willing to be outdone. His body also possessed immense power!

The collision of the two streams of internal qi instantly caused the entire room to buzz!

“Everyone says that you, Yan Jinyao, are the number one genius in Jingdu. I would like to see so for myself today,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Jinyao’s expression was calm as he said indifferently, “I also want to personally kill you, the murderer who killed my grandfather.”

“Go to h*ll!”

Qin Yu was furious, and the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist immediately erupted!

Yan Jinyao snorted coldly. He didn’t panic at all, and his hands quickly slid through the air. Tha holy light seal was formed in front of him!

“Boom!”

A fist smashed down, and the light seal was shattered!

But Qin Yu’s body also took a few steps back!

The first time they exchanged blows, neither side seemed to gain any advantage.

“Jingdu’s number one genius really lives up to his reputation,” Qin Yu said coldly.

But Yan Jinyao said coldly, “I’m not Jingdu’s number one genius. There are many people in Jingdu who are stronger than me.”

Qin Yu frowned. Yan Jinyao’s strength was far beyond Qin Yu’s imagination. Compared to Han Wei, he was much stronger.

If he wanted to take Yan Jinyao down in a short period of time, it wouldn’t be so easy.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. His reason told him that he couldn’t continue to stay here.

Otherwise, once the Yan family’s reinforcements arrived, there would be nowhere to run.

“Yan Sihai, remember this. I will pay you back with twice the amount of pain that Yan Ruoxue has suffered,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu immediately turned around to leave!

Yan Jinyao didn’t chase after him. He stood there quietly with a calm expression.

“Jinyao, why didn’t you kill him?!” Yan Sihai gnashed his teeth and said.

Yan Jinyao glanced at Yan Sihai and said with a smile, “Dad, I finally have a decent opponent. It’s such a pity to kill him just like that.”

Hearing this, the brothers of the Yan family couldn’t help but sigh.

Yan Sihai and his son were really the same. They both liked to show off.

“D*mn it!” Yan Sihai was furious!

This humiliation was simply unbearable for him!

No one could accept being beaten up at home!

At the same time, this also made Yan Sihai realize a problem.

That was, the current Qin Yu already had the ability to get rid of him.

It was time to pay attention to his own safety.

...

Qin Yu didn’t continue to stay in Jingdu. That day, he left this dangerous place.

He rushed all the way to Chuzhou. Just as he arrived in Chuzhou, Qin Yu’s phone rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was the Pavilion Master.

Qin Yu picked up the phone and said, “Pavilion Master.”

The Pavilion Master said in a deep voice, “You went to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

“If you want to blame me, blame me.” Qin Yu didn’t say anything else.

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment, but in the end, she only said, “It’s good that you’re fine.”

Speaking up to this point, the Pavilion Master continued, “In three days, you’ll accompany me to Jingdu.”

“Go to Jingdu?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The Pavilion Master said, “You’ll go to participate in a conference. The people participating in the conference are all people who have an extremely important say.”

Qin Yu was momentarily unable to make sense of the Pavilion Master’s intentions.

“Protect yourself these few days. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association won’t let this matter slide.” The Pavilion Master said.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I understand.”

The next day.

On the forum, there was a piece of news:

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association had sent Yan Guiyi to capture Qin Yu!

Other than that, there was another piece of news:

The veteran Martial Marquis Ma Hai had been killed by Qin Yu. Three days later, Ma Hai’s mentor will come to Pyro and take revenge!
