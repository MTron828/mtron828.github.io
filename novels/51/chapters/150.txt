Chapter 151: The Furious Zhou Tong Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Zhou Tong couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

The surrounding old men also had mocking expressions on their faces. The way they looked at Qin Yu was as if they were looking at a clown.

“Guaranteed a spot in the finals? I’ve never even heard of such a thing.” Zhou Tong took a sip of tea.

“That’s right, he can’t even brag convincingly.”

“At such a young age, it’s fine if you don’t have any abilities, but you’re actually full of lies. Mr. Yang, is this the person you’re vouching for?”

Hearing their words, Qin Yu sneered again and again.

“Whether I’m guaranteed a spot or not, we’ll know the result immediately.” Qin Yu pulled Mr. Yang and found a place to sit down.

Zhou Tong sneered and said, “You’re planning to stay here without leaving, right? Even if there is a spot guaranteed, it has to pass through me, the president.”

“Even I, the president, don’t know about this. How did you get the guarantee?” Zhou Tong asked with mockery.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “There are some things that don’t need to go through you.”

Zhou Tong laughed and said, “You really know how to brag. Okay, I’ll wait and see!”

After saying that, Zhou Tong slammed the teacup on the table.

Qin Yu wasn’t anxiousy. He closed his eyes and quietly waited.

“Mr. Qin, did you really get a guaranteed spot in the finals?” Mr. Yang said with some worry.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Yang, don’t worry. I never brag.”

“That’s good, that’s good.” Mr. Yang patted his chest. It could be seen that Mr. Yang attached great importance to this Chinese Medicine Conference.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and tried to sense the aura of the internal qi around him.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu didn’t feel any spiritual energy in the Chinese Medicine Association.

“Does the Chinese Medicine Association not even have any herbs?” Qin Yu frowned.

What was this so-called Chinese Medicine Association for? What was the point of it?

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, it was already five o’clock.

The sun was setting, and the sky began to darken a little.

Zhou Tong yawned and said, “Qin Yu, it’s almost dark, and your guaranteed spot hasn’t arrived yet. Don’t waste our precious time.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “The sky turned dark so quickly because you came too late. Did the higher-ups give you bunch of good-for-nothings money just to have fun?”

Zhou Tong’s expression changed and he immediately said angrily, “Who are you calling a good-for-nothing?!”

“Whoever answers.” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Well, you have completely offended me!” Zhou Tong said angrily.

“No matter who comes, you can forget about participating in this Chinese Medicine Conference!” Zhou Tong said coldly.

As soon as he said that, the office door was suddenly opened.

Then, Yu Jin quickly walked towards Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, why didn’t you tell me you came to the provincial capital?” Yu Jin said with a smile.

Qin Yu stood up and said politely, “Officer Yu, I just arrived too.”

Yu Jin smiled and said, “Alright, this Chinese Medicine Conference is about to start, right? Contact me when you’re done.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”

After saying that, Yu Jin took out a document from his bag and handed it to Qin Yu.

“This is to be sent to the Chinese Medicine Conference. You can enter the finals,” Yu Jin said with a smile.

“Hehe, here comes another braggart,” Zhou Tong couldn’t help but sneer.

Yu Jin frowned slightly. He turned to look at Zhou Tong and said, “What do you mean?”

“What do you mean?” Zhou Tong sneered.

“I’m the President of the Chinese Medical Association. How come I don’t know about the guaranteed spot? Aren’t you bragging?” Zhou Tong sneered.

Yu Jin suddenly understood and then explained, “You’re the President, right? It’s like this. This guaranteed spot is issued by the sponsor. Didn’t they tell you?”

“Sponsor?” Zhou Tong was stunned.

“Isn’t the sponsor the Department of Commerce?” Zhou Tong said with some confusion.

“Yes, it’s issued by the Department of Commerce.” Yu Jin took the document and handed it to Zhou Tong.

Zhou Tong opened it and took a look. As expected, there was a stamp of the Department of Commerce on it.

“How is that possible?!” Zhou Tong’s expression suddenly became extremely ugly. He held this document tightly while wishing that he could tear this document into pieces!

However, all these years, the Chinese Medical Association was sponsored by the Department of Commerce. All the funds came from the Department of Commerce. Speaking of which, the Department of Commerce was Zhou Tong’s immediate superior!

He could only suppress his anger and he didn’t dare to flip out.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first,” Yu Jin said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Sorry to trouble you, Officer Yu.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“It’s no trouble.” Yu Jin smiled and said, “I look forward to seeing you get a good result.”

After Yu Jin left, Qin Yu glanced at Zhou Tong and said with a nonchalant smile, “It seems that I don’t need to ask you for me to participate in the finals.”

Zhou Tong gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, don’t be arrogant too early. This is the provincial capital, my territory. You better be careful!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Your territory? Who do you think you are? If you have any tricks up your sleeve, feel free to use it. But I have to remind you that people who offend me usually don’t have a good ending.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left with Mr. Yang.

Zhou Tong was so angry that he wanted to smash the table!

“What’s there to be arrogant about? Isn’t he just someone who relied on his connections to enter the finals?”

“That’s right. During the finals, his true colors will definitely be revealed.”

“President Zhou, please calm down. There’s no need to lower yourself to his level.”

Zhou Tong didn’t say anything, but viciousness rose in his heart.

As the President of the Chinese Medical Association, he naturally had a wide network of connections.

Wealthy people were quite close to famous doctors.

The people Zhou Tong knew extended to almost every industry.

“Just you wait!” Zhou Tong narrowed his eyes and muttered in a low voice.

...

Qin Yu and Mr. Yang returned to their residence. On the way, Mr. Yang seemed to be in high spirits.

“Mr. Qin, you really helped me get payback this time!” Mr. Yang said angrily.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s just that I don’t know if there’s a chance to beat those old rascals.”

“There’s absolutely no problem!” Mr. Yang patted his chest and said.

“With your skills, it won’t be a problem to beat them.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “That’s not what I mean. I’m just afraid that they won’t be able to make it to the finals.”

Qin Yu also had some anticipation in his heart.

He wanted to find out how capable these so-called experts were.

At night, Qin Yu laid on the bed with his eyes closed.

Countless pill formulas flashed through his mind, and these pill formulas all came from cultivation methods. Any one of these pill formulas was enough to shock the world.

Qin Yu eventually chose a pill.

“If I can successfully refine this pill, it should be easy for me to become the champion with this pill,” Qin Yu thought to himself.
