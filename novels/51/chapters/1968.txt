1969 Meeting Old Acquaintances

Hearing this, everyone’s face turned somewhat ugly.

No one had expected the Yao family to think of such a method!

Seeing the Prince of Great Xia did not speak for a long time, so the elderly man continued to ask, “Your Highness, is there any problem with this?”

The prince opened his mouth but did not answer the question. Instead, he said, “Everyone, I don’t know how Mr. Qin has offended the Yao family. Why don’t you all sit down and talk about it? Perhaps this is just a misunderstanding?”

!!

“Your Highness, you don’t need to say much. Just tell us if this is against the rules,” the old man said with pride.

The prince fell silent, not knowing how to answer.

“That’s enough. You, despicable people, don’t have to force Your Highness. I killed the people. If you have anything to say, just come to me!” Jue Wu took a step forward, and her tone was tremendously cold.

“Jue Wu, can you do it?” Qin Yu frowned and asked in a low voice.

Jue Wu snorted coldly and said, “I’m not afraid of them.”

“Alright. Since you’re willing to die, don’t blame us for being impolite,” the elderly man said coldly.

After saying that, their bodies also emitted their true internal qi.

Semi-Saint!

These elderly men were all Semi-Saints!

Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly, sensing their powerful internal qi.

“Jue Wu, you…”

“I’m not afraid of them. So what if they’re Semi-Saints?” Jue Wu interrupted Qin Yu.

“Come on, old fellows, come attack me together!” Jue Wu cursed.

“You’re not old, but you sounded arrogant. I alone am enough to deal with a little girl like you!” an elderly man walked out.

His internal qi was exuberant, holding a magical artifact in his hand.

A hole was torn in the void as he activated the magical artifact.

“I’ll wait for you,” the elderly man stepped into the void after saying that.

Without hesitation, Jue Wu stepped forward and quickly stepped into the void.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold, and he was tremendously worried.

Although Jue Wu was powerful, she was facing a Semi-Saint, a true Semi-Saint!

The gap in the cultivation realm was hard to make up. Even if Jue Wu had the power of the purple cloud pearl, no one dared to say who would win.

“Qin Yu, don’t worry. After this little girl dies, you’ll be next,” the other elderly man said indifferently.

“If Jue Wu dies, I will definitely bury the entire Yao family with her!” Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said

“Let the Yao family be buried with her? You’re spouting such arrogant words.” The elderly man shook his head. “The Yao family’s power is not something you can imagine.”

Qin Yu didn’t want to talk nonsense with them. All he thought about was Jue Wu.

However, Qin Yu was seriously injured and could not help at all. He could only wait helplessly.

A series of turbulence could be felt in the void as if it was about to be torn apart at any time. It was obvious that a great battle was taking place there.

“Qin Yu, are you still going to resist? If you follow us back to the Yao family, you might be able to keep your life. However, if we take action, you’ll surely die,” the elderly man said with a faint smile.

“What if I don’t go back with you?” Qin Yu squinted his eyes and asked. “What will happen?”

“Then I’ll kill you and bring your corpse back,” an elderly man said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Qin Yu’s expression grew even gloomier. The Yao family was indeed clean-cut.

“Qin Yu, you have a chaotic body. If you come back with us, I believe the Yao family will give you a chance to live,” at this moment, another elderly man walked out.

“Give him a chance to live? In your dreams! it’s already good enough not to take his life!” the previous elderly man cursed.

“You can’t say that. The Yao family has always valued talents. The future of the chaotic body is limitless. We can give him a chance.”

“That won’t do. He’s killed so many people from our Yao family. If he doesn’t die, where does the Yao family put its face?”

Seeing their act, Qin Yu sneered and said, “Stop acting. I thought the Yao family was some open and aboveboard family, but it seems they’re nothing more than this.”

“Qin Yu, I’m telling the truth. The Yao family will give you a chance to live, but it will depend on your performance,” the elderly man frowned.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “My performance? Do you think I don’t know what you’re thinking? The so-called ‘my performance’ was nothing but asking me to be obedient, put a collar on my neck, and make me kneel and live! Unfortunately, I’d rather die standing than live kneeling!”

“Alright. If this is the case, don’t blame us for being impolite!” The two elderly men seemed to have been angered by Qin Yu, and their bodies also burst out with strong killing intent.

The prince frowned and reminded them, “Do not fight within Sky City.”

“Don’t worry, Your Highness. We won’t make a move, but that doesn’t mean we can’t get rid of him!” the elderly man said in a sinister voice.

“The Yao family’s methods are not something you can imagine!”

The threat in their words became even more intense. They looked like they were ready to attack at any time. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Stop!”

At this moment, a young lady rushed in with a young cultivator beside her.

Qin Yu was stunned when he saw the lady.

“Yao… Yao Meng?” Qin Yu rubbed his eyes as if he could not believe what he saw.

Yao Meng nodded to Qin Yu, then looked at the two elderly men.

“Miss Yao,” the two elderly men bowed and spoke courteously.

“Mr. Qin is my friend. Please leave immediately,” Yao Meng said coldly.

“Miss Yao, Qin Yu has killed several people from the Yao family, you…”

“I’ll take responsibility if there’s any problem. Hurry up and leave!” Yao Meng scolded.

The two elderly men looked at each other and seemed caught in a difficult position.

“What? I can’t even decide on such a small matter?” Yao Meng’s tone became more serious.

“Alright then.” The two were obviously afraid of Yao Meng and finally nodded.

“Qin Yu can go, but that little girl must die!” Then, the elderly man added.

“Yao Meng, the little girl they’re talking about is my best friend. Nothing should happen to her!” Qin Yu said hurriedly.

Yao Meng’s brows furrowed. She was clearly caught in a difficult situation.

In the current situation, it was already good enough to protect Qin Yu. It would be hard to protect the other.

“Miss Yao, you don’t need to say anything else because it’s too late. That little girl has been dragged into the void, and I’m afraid she’s become a corpse by now,” the old man sneered and said.

However, as soon as he finished speaking, the void trembled violently and shattered!

In the next second, Jue Wu fell out of it, and her white clothes were stained with blood!

“Eh? She’s still alive?” The elderly man was surprised to see this.

Qin Yu also hurried forward to support Jue Wu.
