1986 The Evil Plan Succeeded

Ye Chuan was known as Demon Emperor, and the royal family’s portrayal of him was even more hateful. For example, he killed millions of people, devoured their divine senses, and so on.

Qin Yu frowned as he looked at the writing style, which was subtle but judgemental. He had some doubts in his heart.

“Heavenly Blood Rainbow, are these records true?” Qin Yu suddenly thought of Heavenly Blood Rainbow.

Heavenly Blood Rainbow, who had been silent for a long time, said with a gloomy voice, “So what if it’s true or fake?”

!!

“So, you’ve admitted it.” Qin Yu frowned.

Heavenly Blood Rainbow snorted lightly and did not speak.

“Could it be the royal family’s records are all true?” Qin Yu frowned.

According to the royal family’s records, the royal family was absolutely a powerful oppressor. Ye Chuan was like a dragon-slaying youth whose name had been smeared.

Could it be that the dragon-slaying youth had become an evil dragon after his success?

Qin Yu touched his chin and thought about it carefully. It was possible. After all, if a person at the bottom wanted to reach the peak, he would always use some extraordinary means.

Perhaps his success was by stepping on others.

However, Qin Yu felt that such comments were biased. After all, Heavenly Blood Rainbow was the last generation of the Immortal Slaying Sect, and he was not even considered an inheritor.

The first-generation Immortal Slaying Sect was most probably very different from the last generation.

Heavenly Blood Rainbow did not know much either. As he knew very little about the royal family, Qin Yu could not get much information from him.

Qin Yu stopped thinking about it in detail. He continued to read further.

At the same time, some people in the royal family already had their eyes on Jue Wu.

For three full days, Jue Wu had been observing this demonic egg and taking care of it with great care.

She even tried to use spiritual energy to hatch the egg. After she failed, Jue Wu even lay in bed holding the egg, like an old hen hatching an egg.

Unfortunately, the demonic egg still didn’t show any response.

“Strange! How should I hatch this egg?” Jue Wu’s small face was full of doubt, scratching her head,

The outside world was still crazily spreading this matter. The more it spread, the more mysterious it became. Some even said Jue Wu had released the ancient demon, which would bring an unprecedented disaster to the Holy Region.

“Have you heard about it? The person called Jue Wu cut out an ancient demon. Rumor has it that it is at the Tribulation Stage!”

“No, I heard it’s probably an egg of the Immortal Emperor!”

“We can’t let her simply do whatever she wants!”

Soon, many people arrived at the Imperial Palace and denounced Jue Wu.

“Hand over the demon and burn it!”

“Hand over the demon immediately, or we won’t let you off easily!”

The noise outside woke up Jue Wu, who was hatching the eggs. Hearing the curses outside, she couldn’t help but say angrily, “This bunch of b*stards. Do they think I’m a coward?”

After saying this, Jue Wu angrily walked out of the door. However, she had only taken two steps before she was stopped by the prince.

He stood in front of Jue Wu and said, shaking his head, “Jue Wu, you can’t go out.”

Jue Wu said angrily, “Why can’t I go out? Do we just let them talk nonsense outside?”

The prince laughed bitterly and said, “Jue Wu, with your temper and personality, you will definitely cause a lot of trouble if you go out. At that time, you will fall into their trap.”

Although Jue Wu was full of anger, she remembered Qin Yu’s warning and finally suppressed it.

“How about you leave this matter to me?” the prince asked tentatively.

Even a prince had to be cautious when facing a hot-tempered girl like Jue Wu.

Jue Wu impatiently waved her hand and said, “Alright. Go and tell them to stop barking. It’s so annoying!”

“Alright, don’t worry.” The prince laughed bitterly.

Then he walked out of the palace with the help of his attendants.

Jue Wu returned to her room angrily. She covered her ears directly, Out of sight, out of mind.

However, no one noticed someone was observing this scene in the dark.

“The heavens are indeed helping me.” This person was sent by Gu Xinghe. He narrowed his eyes and took advantage of the prince’s absence to walk toward Jue Wu’s room.

The cultivator tiptoed to the door. He took a deep breath, pushed the door open, and ran in, pretending to be scared.

“Jue… Jue Wu, something bad has happened!” the cultivator said in horror.

Jue Wu frowned and said, “What are you panicking for? What has happened?”

The cultivator swallowed his saliva and said, “Qin Yu… Qin Yu has been tricked and gone out of Sky City. He’s being hunted by two Semi-Saints now. You… quickly go and save him, or it’ll be too late!”

As soon as he said this, Jue Wu stood up. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

She glared at the cultivator in front of her and said coldly, “Who did this? Didn’t Qin Yu go to the library?”

“That’s right. Mr. Qin was deceived by someone in the library and is now being hunted down in the suburbs. If you don’t go and save him, he… he’ll be in big trouble!” the cultivator said nervously.

Jue Wu didn’t have time to think. She hurriedly waved her hand and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. Quickly bring me there!”

The cultivator was overjoyed and quickly said, “Alright. I’ll bring you there now!”

In her desperation, Jue Wu didn’t even have time to bring the demonic egg along. She followed this cultivator and left the palace, rushing out of Sky City.

Yang Tong, who was in the dark, watched this scene coldly.

“As expected, she’s all brawn and no brain.” Yang Tong snorted coldly.

Without delay, he immediately came out of the city to look for Gu Xinghe.

...

“The matter has been settled. Jue Wu has been tricked away,” Yang Tong said.

Gu Xinghe raised an eyebrow. He was not too surprised as if everything had been within his speculations.

“Go and find Qin Yu now. Tell him that I have his people. If he doesn’t leave Sky City, I’ll kill them all,” Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“Where is she?” Yang Tong frowned.

“On the way here, you tell him… Wen Da and Wen Er are in my hands. I’ll only give him an hour. If I don’t see him, I’ll kill them immediately,” Gu Xinghe said coldly.

“I’ll get someone to do it now,” Yang Tong sneered with his hands behind his back.

…

In the library, Qin Yu was still reading the records about the Immortal Slaying Sect.

The royal family had taken a lot of pages recording the Immortal Slaying Sect. Qin Yu also noticed some clues from this book.

“I’m afraid the royal family’s records are both true and false, Qin Yu thought to himself.

From the first generation of Ye Chuan to the sixth generation, the Immortal Slaying Sect seemed to have become a different sect. It was getting more vicious.

...

In the process of development, the Immortal Slaying Sect had wholly become a demonic sect, which was completely different from the original Immortal Slaying Sect.

“The books of the royal family don’t seem to have much value.” Qin Yu frowned.
