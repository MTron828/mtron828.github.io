Chapter 820: Chapter 820, do you think I will believe you? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at Wan guqiong behind him, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Mr. Qin, we meet again,”Wan guqiong said politely.

Qin Yu nodded to him and said, “What do you mean?”

Wan guqiong smiled and said, “You should know that Yan Ruoxue has a special bloodline. This bloodline is extremely powerful. Whoever can get Yan Ruoxue will be able to build a super powerful sect.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, indicating for Wan guqiong to continue.

“Therefore, many sects and forces in the world will target her,”Wan guqiong continued.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He looked at Wan Guqiong and said with a faint smile, “You said that Yan Ruoxue is not safe by my side. What should I do in your opinion?”

Wan guqiong said with a faint smile, “Mr. Qin, to tell you the truth, I also come from a secret realm.”

“Yes.”Qin Yu was not surprised by this.

Wan guqiong continued, “The safest thing is to take her to a secret realm. Of course, if Mr. Qin is willing, you can come with me.”

As soon as he said this, Qin Yu’s impression of Wan Guqiong was greatly reduced.

Qin Yu simply could not believe this wan guqiong.

Moreover, the two of them were not related, so how could he be kind enough to help him.

“There’s no need,”Qin Yu said without hesitation.

Wan guqiong smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, are you worried about me? Miss Yao and I are friends.”

“Yes, Mr. Wan is trustworthy,”Yao Meng also said.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly.

He stared at Yao Meng in front of him and said with a faint smile, “Miss Yao, to be honest, I have a good impression of you before this, but since you said that... Sorry, you’d better stay away from me in the future.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left.

A trace of surprise flashed across Yao Meng’s beautiful eyes. She hesitated for a moment and then quickly caught up with him.

“Mr. Qin, do you think that I Covet Ruoxue’s Blood?”Yao Meng frowned slightly.

“Is it important whether it’s true or not?”Qin Yu sneered.

“I risked my life to bring Ruoxue out. Do you think I’ll trust you with her?”

“Mr. Qin, you have misunderstood our meaning.”Wan guqiong followed.

“I originally wanted to provide you with a place to live. After your martial saint power disappears, the Jingdu martial arts association will not let you off.”

Qin Yu sneered, “Don’t worry about it. I have my own countermeasures.”

“Also, I warn you, it’s best not to have any ideas about Yan Ruoxue. As long as there are people who are involved with Yan Ruoxue, I will not let any of them off.”

Wan guqiong and Yao Meng looked at each other and were speechless for a moment.

After Qin Yu went back, he took out his phone and made a call to the Mustache Man.

“How is it? is your teleportation array ready?”Qin Yu asked.

The mustache man mumbled, “It’s not that fast. Just wait!”

After saying that, the Mustache Man angrily hung up the phone.

Qin Yu sat in this huge mansion, feeling a little worried.

He had a feeling that things were not that simple.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt a figure appear outside.

“Who? !”Qin Yu hurriedly stood up, and his internal Qi suddenly erupted.

With a glance, he saw Blackie walking over.

Qin Yu frowned. He walked forward and said, “Heaven-swallowing python? Are you here for Revenge?”

Blackie said coldly, “Although I don’t like you, I can tell right from wrong. The person who killed Granny Qin was the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, not you.”

Qin Yu said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “It seems that sometimes animals have more backbone than humans.”

Blackie ignored this sentence. He said coldly, “Don’t you want the inner core?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Huh? What do you mean?”A trace of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

Blackie said coldly, “I can take you to look for the inner core.”

“Didn’t you already tell me the address last time?”Qin Yu asked.

Blackie shook his head and said, “I lied to you last time. I also made up the address casually.”

Hearing that, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little angry.

“I can take you to find the inner core, but I have one condition,”Blackie said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu sat down and nodded slightly. “Speak.”

Blackie narrowed his eyes and said, “When you attack the Jingdu Martial Arts Association... Take Me with you!”

A trace of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

He said with a bit of ridicule, “Revenge for Granny Qin?”

“What do you think?”Blackie snorted coldly.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and nodded. “Okay, I promise you.”

After getting a positive answer, Blackie turned around and left without saying anything else.

...

The next day.

Qin Yu arrived at the entrance of the martial arts academy according to the agreed time.

He was a little excited.

Qin Yu had heard about the Scripture depository many times. Not only did it record spells, but it also recorded related history.

As for the rumors about the masked woman, Qin Yu could finally see it with his own eyes.

At this moment, the young masters of the various aristocratic families had already gathered here.

Xia hang also followed the agreement and was waiting here early.

“Brother Qin!”After seeing Qin Yu, Zhuang Teng and the others came forward to greet him one after another.

Qin Yu nodded at him as a response.

Ever since Qin Yu caused a ruckus at the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, these young masters of the aristocratic families had increasingly recognized Qin Yu and even had the intention to rope him in.

Qin Yu chose to maintain a distance that was neither too far nor too close to them.

“Since everyone is here, let’s set off,”Xia Hang said.

Everyone nodded slightly, and a group of people rushed toward the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

After passing through the main hall of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, they arrived at the backyard.

In this backyard, there were countless houses.

And in the depths of the backyard, there was an extremely tall tower. This tower was the famous scripture pavilion.

The three large golden words were shining under the light and were extremely dazzling.

Standing under this Scripture Depository, Qin Yu could feel a peaceful aura.

This peaceful aura came from Western Buddhism and contained a trace of power of faith.

“Scripture depository... The Last Time I came here was ten years ago,”Kong Yun sighed.

“Yeah, when I first came here, I was just a kid. In the blink of an eye, I’ve grown up.”Someone beside him echoed.

Xia hang coughed and said, “The scripture pavilion can not stay for too long. I’ll give you three days at most. After three days, everyone must leave. Do you understand? !”

“President Xia, don’t worry.”Everyone nodded.

Xia hang did not say anything more. He walked to the Scripture Pavilion and took out a token.

As Xia hang activated it, the token immediately flashed with rays of light.
