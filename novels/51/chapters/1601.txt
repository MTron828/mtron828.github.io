Yong Ji smiled but didn’t say anything. His intentions had been seen through, but he still didn’t say anything.

Baro and Feng Hai were both top figures of the southern region. They naturally wouldn’t become Yong Ji’s guns.

At this moment, the door suddenly opened, and a black-robed person walked in.

“The three of you, The Godly King invites you,”the black-robed person said.

Upon hearing this, Yong Ji raised his eyebrows and said, “Okay, we understand. We’ll go over right away.”

After the black-robed man left, the room fell into silence once again.

Everyone understood, but no one was willing to speak.

“Let your disciple go.”At this moment, Baro spoke.

Yong Ji glanced at Baro and understood.

He slowly stood up and said, “Alright, I’ll do as you say.”

Following that, Yong Ji walked out of the door. He found a disciple and followed behind the three of them, walking towards the godly King’s room.

In the room, four people stood in front of the godly king.

At this moment, Sima Bei and the others were extremely weak. Cold Sweat kept breaking out on their foreheads, and their internal Qi was extremely weak.

Under such circumstances, it was absolutely impossible for eternal pole not to be moved. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He narrowed his eyes slightly and thought of his own little plan.

At this moment, Eternal Pole’s disciple suddenly took a step forward and said coldly, “With your current state, do you still have the qualifications to be godly kings? I think it’s better for all of you to give up your positions!”

Sima Bei’s expression turned cold as he said coldly, “What do you mean?”

This disciple shouted, “Nothing much, I just feel that it’s time for all of you to step aside!”

After saying that, this disciple directly rushed towards Sima bei!

Sima Bei’s expression did not show the slightest bit of fear. His glabella trembled and a ray of light instantly lit up!

In the next second, that Disciple’s body instantly stiffened and he could not move. Fresh blood continuously flowed out from his entire body and it was as if his entire body was about to be torn apart!

The expressions of Yong Ji and the others changed drastically! As expected, these three godly monarchs still had means to protect themselves!

Yong Ji had a bad feeling and immediately took a step forward, shouting, “Disobedient disciple, how dare you speak to Godly monarchs like this, you’re courting death!”

With that said, Yong Ji took the lead and took a step forward, raising his hand and smashing his head into pieces!

The three godly monarchs’expressions were ice-cold, and Sima bei was even gloomier.

“Godly monarch, I’m really sorry. It’s my fault for not disciplining you strictly.”Yong Ji bowed and said.

Sima bei said coldly, “Manage your own people properly. If there’s a next time, don’t blame me for being impolite.”

Yong Ji cupped his hands and said, “Definitely.”

After that, Sima bei swept his gaze at the three people and slowly said, “It’s time for all of you to take action. Xiao Hai is already dead, and the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is missing. Currently, no one in the southern region is your match.”

“I want the three of you to head to the South Province. Kill those that you can take in and those that you can’t!”

The three of them looked at each other. They had no choice but to nod and say, “We understand. We’ll head to the South Province now.”

“Let Rui Yi go with you. You have to listen to her in all your actions. At the same time, she will ensure your safety so that you can return to the South Province at any time,”Sima Bei said.

With that, a sexy woman in a black robe walked in.

Yong Ji frowned slightly. Although he was a little unhappy, he did not dare to say anything. He could only nod and agree.

After the three of them left, the three godly monarchs’expressions turned extremely cold.

“We can’t let this Yong Ji Stay,”one of the godly monarchs said.

“That’s right. He must have ordered us to do what we did just now,”the other godly monarch added.

Sima Bei’s expression was gloomy as he said coldly, “Yongji is not willing to be subservient to others. He has schemed for so many years to replace the Heavenly Cloud sect. Why would he be willing to listen to our orders now?”

“If it weren’t for the fact that this is the time to hire people, I would have killed him long ago!”

“HMPH, let him live happily for a few days first. When the master recovers, it will be the day he dies!”

...

South Province.

Qin Yu, Qu Zhu, and the others were heading toward Immortal Chuan Mountain.

Today was the day Xiao Hai died, and the news had long since spread throughout South Province.

The cultivators of the various sects had all received the news and had all come to Immortal Chuan Mountain.

Many cultivators had even come to Immortal Chuan Mountain on their own accord, wanting to send Xiao Hai off on his last journey.

The Huge Immortal Chuan Mountain was almost filled with people, and every one of them had a solemn expression and a sorrowful expression.

“Xiao Hai is a true hero.”Someone Sighed.

“No one in the entire southern prefecture can do what he did.”

“I hope that senior Xiao Hai’s sacrifice is meaningful.”

Qin Yu, Qu Zhu, and the others also arrived at the Immortal Mountain.

As he looked at the people that filled the mountain, he couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

“This is the end of a generation of heroes.”Qin Yu murmured softly.

Qu Zhu didn’t say a word. No one knew what he was thinking in his heart.

The few of them walked all the way to the side of the monk of Hongxi. At this moment, the monk of Hongxi was already at the highest point of the immortal mountain. In front of him was a stone coffin.

The pitiful thing was that Xiao Hai didn’t even have a corpse. The only thing he could bury was the fragment of his mask.

“It’s almost time to bury him,”the monk of Hongxi said.

Qin Yu nodded. He bowed slightly and put his palms together as if he was sending Xiao Hai off.

Everyone on the mountain also bowed.

Monk Hongxi extended his palm and the huge stone coffin immediately rose from the ground.

With his strength, the stone coffin floated into the air and fell toward the golden well.

At this moment, a ray of light shot over and grabbed Xiao Hai’s stone coffin!

The sudden turn of events caused everyone’s expressions to change.

Raising their heads, they saw three people in black robes standing in the sky, looking down at everything.

These three people were none other than Yong Ji, Feng Hai, and Baro.

“It’s You!”Seeing these three people, everyone present was furious!

Qin Yu’s expression instantly darkened. He looked coldly at Yong Ji and said, “Yong Ji, what are you doing here?”

Yong ji said indifferently, “I’m here to send off Xiao Hai for his last journey.”

“Send off Xiao Hai for his last journey? Do You Think You’re Worthy? ! Senior Xiao Hai fought and died in a bloody battle, yet all of you have become the lackeys of the northern lands!”Someone at the scene could not help but berate loudly.

Yong Ji laughed loudly and said, “That’s because he’s stupid. If a person doesn’t do it for himself, Heaven and earth will destroy him!”

“You’re courting death!”Hearing this, Qin Yu was instantly enraged and threw a punch in the air!

The golden light directly approached Yong Ji. Yong Ji didn’t dare to resist it and immediately shot backward, hiding to the side.

He laughed loudly and said, “Qin Yu, why are you so anxious? Don’t worry, there will be a battle between you and me. Just Wait.”

“Wait? I think it’s better to end it today!”Qin Yu’s body shot out explosively and instantly arrived in front of Yong Ji!

The atmosphere instantly became tense, and Qu Zhu and the others were also ready to make a move.
