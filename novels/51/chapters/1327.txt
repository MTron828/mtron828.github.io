Chapter 1328: Chapter 1328, devouring life force 

Wan ‘er was a little surprised when she heard Ling Yun’s name.

“Ling Yun from the Tianyun Sect?”Wan ‘er tried to ask.

Qin Yu nodded. “Yes, that’s him.”

“I know him, but I’m not too familiar with him,”wan ‘er said.

Ah San snorted coldly. “Ling Yun is nothing! If it wasn’t for my miss’health problems back then, she wouldn’t be the number one genius in South Province!”

“Ah San, don’t spout nonsense!”Wan ‘er reprimanded.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he felt that what ah San said made sense.

Ling Yun’s realm was only at the early-stage of the Almighty Realm. Even though his strength wasn’t weaker than the middle-stage of the Almighty Realm, it was only limited to the middle-stage of the ordinary almighty realm.

If they were both Heaven’s favorites, then Ling Yun wasn’t even worth mentioning.

“Does young Master Qin Know Ling Yun?”Wan ‘er asked.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. In the end, he felt that it was best not to tell her.

After all, the Heavenly Cloud sect was powerful. It wasn’t something that ordinary people could afford to provoke.

“Miss Wan ‘er, let’s hurry back!”Ah San said anxiously.

“No Rush. I also want to witness Young Master Qin’s realm,”Wan ‘er said with a smile.

Qin Yu sighed and said with a wry smile, “Then I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you.”

“Oh? Why?”Wan ‘er asked with slight surprise.

Qin Yu waved his hand, not knowing how to explain.

He picked up the life qi and sat on the bed.

Wan ‘er and AH San stood quietly at the side.

“This Qin Yu is so terrifying even without spiritual power. If he recovers, he’ll probably be an expert of a region,”AH SAN said softly.

Wan ‘er nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. Speaking of which, I’m looking forward to it.”

Then, they didn’t say anything more and looked at Qin Yu quietly.

Qin Yu also began to absorb the life Qi in the jar.

Traces of life qi flowed into his pores.

The dark green internal Qi flowed through his meridians and throughout his body.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly, wanting to feel the changes in his body.

However, with the loss of life qi, there was still no trace of spirit energy in Qin Yu’s body.

“How could this be...”Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes, and a trace of despair appeared on his face.

This was already the second time he had swallowed life qi. What made Qin Yu Sad was that his spirit energy still hadn’t returned.

“Young Master Qin, How Do You Feel?”Wan ‘er hurriedly walked forward and asked. “...”

“Strange, he still doesn’t seem to have any fluctuations of spirit energy...”Ah San, who was at the side, said in astonishment.

Qin Yu slowly stood up from the bed.

His expression was extremely unsightly, and his entire person was incomparably gloomy.

“Young Master Qin, what... What Happened?”Wan ‘er asked in a low voice.

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He forcefully endured the pain in his heart and sighed. “There is still not the slightest bit of spirit energy in my body, and I can’t feel any changes in my body.”

“AH? How could this be?”Wan ‘er covered her mouth and said in surprise.

Ah San, who was at the side, whispered, “You can’t be poisoned by the Twilight Qi, right? But you can’t cultivate? As far as I know, there are many people in the holy region who have a physique that surpasses that of demon beasts, but they can’t cultivate.”

“Ah San, don’t talk nonsense,”Wan ‘er scolded. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. In fact, before this, I’ve already swallowed the life Qi once, and there’s no spiritual energy in my body either.”

“How could this be...”Wan ‘er frowned.

She had never heard of such a situation since she was young in the Holy Region.

Qin Yu sighed, and a trace of pain flashed in his eyes.

He had worked so hard for so long, and in the end, this was the result.

Could it be that elder Bai was telling the truth and that he really couldn’t cultivate anymore.

“Young Master Qin, the white hair on your head seems to have decreased by a lot.”

At this moment, wan ‘er suddenly said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s eyes lit up.

He hurriedly ran to the mirror and examined it carefully.

As expected, the white hair on his head was much less!

“This seems to be of no use,”AH SAN whispered from the side.

Wan ‘er said somewhat reproachfully, “Ah San, what nonsense are you talking about? This at least shows that the life qi is useful to young master qin. The spiritual power has not been restored. It is very likely that the life qi is not enough to restore the spiritual power.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I hope so.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu found another abnormality.

The faintly discernible cross between his brows was actually slowly changing!

Qin Yu stared at the space between his brows, his face full of disbelief!

The shape of the cross actually slowly turned into a “Nine”!

“This... what is this situation?”Qin Yu rubbed his forehead hard, but he found that he did not feel anything.

“Young Master Qin, What’s Wrong?”Wan ‘er asked.

Qin Yu didn’t have the mood to pay attention to Wan ‘er. He stared at the space between his eyebrows, countless thoughts flashing through his mind.

“Nine... In other words, the cross that I thought was actually the number ten?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

This number appeared when he swallowed the life Qi for the first time. Now, when he swallowed it for the second time, it had changed from ten to nine.

“I understand.”Qin Yu took a deep breath, and a hint of excitement flashed in his eyes.

In other words, he had to devour life Qi for eleven times before the spot between his brows would disappear.

At that time, the spiritual power that had disappeared would definitely follow!

“I understand, I understand!”Qin Yu was instantly extremely excited!

Although his spiritual power had not recovered yet, this at least gave Qin Yu a glimmer of hope.

“In other words, I still need to devour the Qi of life nine more times,”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly looked at Wan ‘er and cupped his hands. “Miss Wan ‘er, if you know where the Qi of life is, please tell me!”

Wan ‘er thought for a moment and said, “Now that my spiritual power has recovered, I think I will be valued by the family. When the time comes, I will think of a way to get someone to inquire about it.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you, Miss Wan ‘Er.”

“Young Master Qin, you are too kind. If it weren’t for you, I would never have recovered,”wan ‘er said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t say much. No matter what method he used, he had to gather as much life qi as possible.

There might still be some in the mountain range, but Qin Yu didn’t want to take a second risk.

In the mountain range, Qin Yu clearly felt a trace of fear. This was definitely not a good omen.

“HMM?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

After swallowing the life force last time, a certain part of his chest had turned dark gold, and that piece of flesh had also become stronger.

Now that it was the second time he had swallowed it, his physical body should have also changed!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu did not care about Wan ‘er and the others. He immediately tore off his clothes and took off all his clothes.
