Chapter 752: I’ll Swallow It For You! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Slaughtering chickens and dogs? Hahahaha!” Ao Zhan couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“What, do you still have that Martial Saint weapon with you?” Ao Zhan asked somewhat tentatively.

Qin Yu sneered. “You don’t have to probe. That Martial Saint weapon isn’t with me.”

Upon hearing these words, Ao Zhan could be considered to be completely relieved.

The internal qi on his body began to surge slowly. The internal qi of a peak-stage Martial Marquis filled the entire quiet bar.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Let’s go somewhere else. Don’t disturb his business.”

After saying this, Qin Yu took the lead and walked out of the door.

Looking at Qin Yu’s back, Ao Zhan narrowed his eyes.

He suddenly launched an attack. A gust of wind arose under his feet, and a pair of fists fiercely pressed toward Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu!” Yao Meng immediately cried out in surprise!

However, it was too late to dodge at this time. The speed of a peak Martial Marquis was too fast!

“Clang!”

Ao Zhan’s fist smashed firmly onto Qin Yu’s back!

A crisp sound reverberated throughout the entire room!

However, this incomparably fierce fist was unable to shake Qin Yu in the slightest.

Qin Yu slowly turned around and said with a grin, “Even a sneak attack is useless. You really are a piece of trash.”

Ao Zhan’s expression changed. He couldn’t help but take a step back, and his expression became more vigilant.

“I’ll wait for you in front,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of bar.

Ao Zhan snorted coldly and then quickly chased after him.

“Are we going?” Wan Guqiong asked.

Yao Meng nodded and said, “Let’s go and take a look.”

...

More than ten kilometers away, there was an abandoned factory.

It was deserted and there were no lights.

Qin Yu stood there and quietly waited for Ao Zhan’s arrival.

A few minutes later, a light flashed in front of Qin Yu. Then, Ao Zhan appeared in front of Qin Yu with a crossbow in his hand.

“Qin Yu, today is the day you die,” Ao Zhan said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at Ao Zhan expressionlessly and said, “It seems that you aren’t important to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Ao Zhan frowned and said coldly, “What do you mean?”

“If it were important, they wouldn’t have sent you here to die,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Ao Zhan’s pupils dilated and he said angrily, “Arrogant!”

Before he could finish his words, Ao Zhan grabbed the crossbow, and a ray of light shot toward Qin Yu!

This crossbow released the purest inner strength! After the crossbow, the inner strength could be dozens of times more powerful!

That ray of light contained a powerful force, and it shot toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu was calm. He clenched his fist, and then suddenly threw a punch!

“Boom!”

A loud sound shook the ground and dust flew everywhere!

The abandoned factory, which was already in ruins, was turned into dust at this moment!

Under this punch, the light from the crossbow was shattered!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s expression was calm. He wasn’t affected at all.

Ao Zhan’s expression changed and he said coldly, “What a tough body!”

“What other moves do you have? Just use them.” Qin Yu looked at Ao Zhan quietly.

Ao Zhan sneered and said, “Don’t be happy too early. It was just a test. Now, let’s get to the main topic!”

Before he finished speaking, Ao Zhan’s figure suddenly burst forward!

The crossbow in his hand flickered with light, as if it was brewing some terrifying power!

“Hualala!”

A series of strange sounds were emitted from the crossbow.

“Hundred Light Slash!”

Accompanied by Ao Zhan’s furious roar, the crossbow in his hand immediately burst out with bursts of dazzling light! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In an instant, countless balls of light shot towards Qin Yu!

These balls of light contained an extremely destructive power. Wherever they passed, even the air was ignited!

One ball of light after another bombarded wildly, almost turning Qin Yu into minced meat!

This technique was one of Ao Zhan’s famous techniques. Such a huge amount of energy, under the activation of the crossbow, contained an unimaginable power!

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. Facing these hundred balls of light, Qin Yu showed no fear.

With a furious roar, his body suddenly burst out with golden light!

The resplendent light instantly illuminated the surroundings!

“He wants to forcefully resist this Hundred Light Slash!” Yao Meng, who was watching the battle, seemed to have noticed something!

A trace of surprise flashed across Wan Guqiong’s face.

Just as Yao Meng had said, Qin Yu planned to use his physical body to forcefully resist this technique!

“Boom!”

The light balls rained down on Qin Yu’s body!

The ground under Qin Yu’s feet instantly collapsed, and cracks appeared one after another!

“Boom!”

The ground, with Qin Yu as the center, completely collapsed, and crushed stones shot out in all directions, like bullets!

Seeing this scene, Ao Zhan couldn’t help but sneer. “Arrogance will make you pay the price you deserve.”

He looked down at the dust from above, and a cruel smile appeared on his face.

But in the next second, Ao Zhan’s expression suddenly changed.

The ground around Qin Yu collapsed, but the ground under Qin Yu’s feet was intact, forming a long stone pillar.

Qin Yu’s clothes had been shattered, but his body was intact.

Under the golden light, he looked like a God!

“How... how could this be?” Ao Zhan’s expression suddenly changed!

Qin Yu looked in the direction of Ao Zhan and sneered. “Is this your technique? It’s just so-so.”

Ao Zhan immediately flew into a rage!

“Don’t be so arrogant!” Ao Zhao roared and grabbed the crossbow with both hands!

The inner strength in Ao Zhan’s body was pouring into the crossbow!

The crossbow seemed to be drawing out Ao Zhan’s inner strength. In a short moment, it contained an unimaginable power!

In front of the crossbow, there was a terrifying pressure.

This pressure made even Yao Meng feel a little uncomfortable.

“Go to hell!”

Accompanied by Ao Zhan’s angry roar, the crossbow instantly exploded with a dazzling ball of light!

This ball of light was incomparably bright, comparable to the sun and moon, and the power within was even more unimaginable!

“What a terrifying power.” Yao Meng frowned.

She looked in Qin Yu’s direction and couldn’t help but feel a little worried.

Qin Yu didn’t show any signs of responding.

“Boom!”

Following the activation of the crossbow, that ball of light crushed towards Qin Yu!

This ball of light had a diameter of several meters and was incomparably huge.

In front of this ball of light, Qin Yu’s figure seemed insignificant.

In the blink of an eye, this ball of light arrived in front of Qin Yu!

Qin Yu, who had been motionless, finally made a move.

He slowly raised his hand and said coldly, “Divine devouring technique!”

In an instant, Qin Yu opened his mouth.

He grabbed the ball of light and swallowed it in the next second!

This scene immediately made everyone’s jaws drop!

Even Yao Meng and Wan Guqiong couldn’t help but be dumbfounded!

“This... what is this...” Yao Meng’s beautiful eyes were filled with shock.

“I’ve never seen such a barbaric spell...” Wan Guqiong also said in shock.
