Chapter 535: The Great Battle! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The first head-on collision between the two fists erupted at this moment!

This wasn’t just a clash between Qin Yu and Han Wei, but also a clash between the lower class and the aristocratic families!

“Boom!”

A loud sound like thunder resounded in their ears, and a terrifying shockwave rapidly spread out in all directions with the two of them as the center!

Countless tables and chairs were shattered on the spot. If it wasn’t for Martial Marquises holding down the fort, all the ordinary people present would probably have died from this collision!

The two of them, their faces also filled with coldness, took a few steps back.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Han Wei and said, “It seems that you are just so-so. I now doubt how you beheaded the Martial Marquis.”

Han Wei narrowed his eyes and said, “Just now, I only used 10% of my strength for that punch.”

His internal qi was slowly released.

In an instant, the entire crowd felt intense pressure, as if a huge mountain was pressing down on their chests!

Qin Yu, who was at the center, didn’t change his expression. His body also released an intense internal qi, forming a confrontation with it.

“Qin Yu, I will let you know that all your hard work isn’t worth mentioning,” Han Wei said coldly.

“Because... I was born above all of you!”

Accompanied by an explosive roar, Han Wei suddenly extended both of his hands forward!

In an instant, countless rays of light gathered on his palms. A terrifying pressure instantly spread throughout the entire crowd!

“Han Wei is indeed worthy of his reputation. He actually activated such power so easily!” When everyone saw this, they couldn’t help but exclaim!

“Go to h*ll!”

At this moment, Han Wei let out an angry roar. With a wave of his hand, several terrifying rays of light instantly flew into the sky!

Countless rays of light headed straight for Qin Yu. In an instant, numerous spider web-like cracks appeared under Qin Yu’s feet!

“Crack!”

Finally, the ground couldn’t withstand this enormous force and began to crumble!

Qin Yu’s body was also slammed into the ground by this enormous force!

In an instant, smoke and dust rose into the air. Crushed stones shot out in all directions like bullets!

A huge pit suddenly appeared in front of everyone!

The crowd was completely silent. Everyone was looking at the smoke and dust.

“Is it going to end like this?” Someone said in a low voice.

“If it ends like this, then this battle will be meaningless,” a young man said indifferently.

The person who spoke was none other than Yan Sihai’s son, Yan Jinyao!

“Your words make sense,” said a handsome young man beside him with a smile.

This young man’s name was Zhuang Teng. He was a young master of the Zhuang family, and his strength was similarly powerful.

“I have to admit that Han Wei’s strength can’t be underestimated. Even in the entire Jingdu, he is top-notch.” Another young man walked over.

This person’s name was Chu Heng, and he was Chu Hedao’s biological brother.

These famous geniuses of Jingdu all came!

Their goal wasn’t to attend the wedding, but to watch the battle that had been hyped up for a long time!

“Brother Chu is right. Even if it was us, we would probably be injured.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Everyone agreed with Chu Heng’s words.

Only Yan Jinyao remained silent. He only looked at the gradually falling dust indifferently.

When the dust fell, a terrifying scene appeared.

Qin Yu’s clothes were pulled back by this huge force, but his body didn’t move at all. There wasn’t a single wound on his body!

His entire body was wrapped in golden light. His eyes that contained killing intent looked coldly at Han Wei!

“What a strong body!” Chu Heng couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

Zhuang Teng, who was beside him, also sighed. “It seems that Qin Yu has some ability.”

Han Wei couldn’t help but frown.

He said coldly, “Qin Yu, your body really lives up to its reputation... It’s a pity that it’s useless!”

After saying that, Han Wei suddenly disappeared, and in the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of Qin Yu!

His extremely fast speed caused the crowd to exclaim!

The next second, Han Wei’s palm, wrapped in a glow, patted on Qin Yu’s chest gently!

“Boom!”

The moment the palm touched him, Qin Yu instantly took a few steps back! An extremely strong internal force seemed to have exploded in Qin Yu’s body!

This technique was taught to him by Xia Hang, and his fist contained extremely strong penetrating force. It was also a strategy that Xia Hang had specially made for Han Wei to use to deal with Qin Yu’s tough body!

Now, this technique was in Han Wei’s hands, and it displayed an even more powerful force!

However, in the next second, Han Wei’s expression turned cold.

Qin Yu’s expression was calm. There was a white mark left on his chest, but his internal qi didn’t decrease in the slightest!

“He actually took it head-on!” Zhuang Teng couldn’t help but say in surprise.

“This kid’s body is beyond imagination!”

“This shouldn’t be. I’ve seen Han Wei’s punch before. Han Wei’s internal strength will be injected into his body, like a bomb exploding in his body,” Chu Heng said slowly.

“Could it be that his internal organs are also as strong as steel?”

For a moment, a look of shock appeared on everyone’s faces.

Yan Sihai, who was sitting at the front, had a hint of displeasure in his eyes.

“Is that all Han Wei can do? For two consecutive times, Qin Yu didn’t even lose a hair!” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“Mr. Yan, don’t worry. Han Wei only used 20% of his strength just now,” Xia Hang quickly explained.

Han Meng also tried to smooth things over. “Mr. Yan, my son hates Qin Yu to the bone. I’m afraid he’s unwilling to kill him just like that.”

“Isn’t it crueler to slowly torture your prey?” Han Meng said with a laugh.

Yan Sihai snorted lightly and didn’t say anything.

In the distance, Qin Yu patted the dust off his body,

He looked at Han Wei and sneered. “It seems that there really is something shady behind the news of you killing a Martial Marquis.”

Han Wei frowned, and his eyes narrowed.

Just as Qin Yu said, that Martial Marquis was just a criminal of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. When they fought, he was already crippled by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Han Wei just took advantage of the situation and used it to create prestige for himself. That was all.

“Han Wei, if we were both half-step Martial Marquises, you won’t be my match,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Is that so?” Han Wei raised his eyebrows and grinned. “Qin Yu... you think too highly of yourself!”

With a loud roar, Han Wei’s internal qi completely exploded!

His internal qi was rapidly climbing up, and rays of red light wrapped around Han Wei!

In just an instant, Han Wei’s strength soared by dozens of points! The murderous internal qi on his body caused the temperature to drop abruptly!

“Rumble...”

The terrifying qi force actually crushed the ground beneath his feet!

It stirred up a hurricane, completely shattering this meticulously decorated venue!

Martial Marquis Bai and the others hurriedly took action to protect everyone!

Han Wei’s body was covered in a layer of red light. At a glance, he looked like a demon.

He grinned while revealing a creepy smile.

“Qin Yu... everything has just begun!” Han Wei’s sinister voice entered everyone’s ears.
