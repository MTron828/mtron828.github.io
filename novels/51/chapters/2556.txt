Chapter 2557 Experiment

“Xuan Xin, have you heard of the Myriad Manifestation Gaze?”

Qin Yu suddenly thought of something and asked Xuan Xin.

It was Immortal Emperor Yao who mentioned the Myriad Manifestation Gaze. It would be best if Xuan Xin knew it.

With Immortal Emperor Yao’s current state, survival was his priority. Qin Yu dared not trust him completely.

“That seems to be the Guardian’s eye, the pupil of the once mightiest Guardian in the past. Back then, when the Immortal Emperor rebelled against the Path of Heaven, this Guardian’s power had led to the failure of this rebellion. Rumor has it that this eye can see the mysteries of the universe, the movements of the stars, and the various changes within nature. It can comprehend the way of nature and grasp the secrets of the universe. It can even see through the shackles of destiny and alter one’s fate and future.

Xuan Xin glanced at Qin Yu thoughtfully.

Qin Yu’s heart skipped a beat. He recalled the scene when he obtained the desolate divine eye.

“Something is not right. This eye of mine should be the desolate divine eye I obtained from Earth. Why did Immortal Emperor Yao say that it’s the Myriad Manifestation Gaze? If what Xuan Xin said is true, could it be that it’s the pupil my father left behind, and the desolate divine eye is just a disguise?”

Qin Yu’s thoughts were in disarray at this moment. If all this truly was his father’s contingency plan, the thought of it alone was terrifying.

How did his father know he would go to that place on Earth and obtain the desolate divine eye?

Could it be that he could see the future, as Xuan Xin said? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Primordial Chaos!

Just do it! Qin Yu unleashed the power of Primordial Chaos directly.

This time, after the terrifying power erupted from his dantian, Qin Yu controlled the surging energy with all his might, directing it upward.

It pierced through until his forehead and in an instant, the golden desolate divine eye opened.

After using the power of Primordial Chaos twice, Qin Yu had begun to get used to this violent energy.

Furthermore, with the help of the artifact spirit of the Heart of the Ocean, his Glazed Holy Body had extended from his spine to every part of his body.

His body’s strength had increased by another level, and he could now control this power slightly.

Previously, he had only used the simplest and most direct explosive power of his body. Now, he could use this power to unleash some simple cultivation methods. The power that erupted would definitely be far greater than previously.

Even if it were a simple fist-fighting technique, the power would probably increase by 10% to 20%. However, he still could not control the more refined cultivation method in his current state.

The desolate divine eye absorbed his soul power uncontrollably. At this moment, an enormous vortex suddenly appeared in his body.

The spiritual energy of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect seemed to have been guided as it surged frantically toward Qin Yu’s body.

“Keep it up!”

Immortal Emperor Yao’s voice sounded again.

Qin Yu’s body began to tremble violently, and a massive amount of blood began to spurt out from the pupil on his forehead.

Xuan Xin slightly frowned as if he did not understand the change that had happened to Qin Yu.

“Senior Brother Xuan Xin, this person seems to be Qin Yu from Human Race Watch.”

Several figures landed not far away. Seeing Qin Yu’s state, one of them revealed a look of interest.

“So what?”

Xuan Xin did not even open his eyes. At this moment, several supreme treasures in the sect had been taken by people. Those who had comprehended the cultivation method had also found themselves places to cultivate. The sect was not as noisy as before.

“Senior Brother, the monster race has already locked onto this place. This person has a lot of treasures with him. If they are in our hands, we can protect more people in the sect!”

The person who spoke was called Xuan Feng. He had already reached the peak of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect in cultivating the Way of the Sword. He was good at fast sword techniques and fierce attacks.

“Get lost!”

Xuan Xin’s voice was without fluctuation.

“Xuan Xin, although Sect Master has summoned this person, I have not heard of Sect Master having any special arrangements for him. Must you destroy the relationship among the brothers in the sect for an outsider?”

Another person coldly rebuked. He was Xuan Lan of the same generation as Sect Master Chen Shuang and was more senior than Xuan Xin by a generation.

During ordinary times, he might not have thoughts on the person summoned by the sect master.

However, the sect was now closed, and according to the news, the monster race’s attack had reached the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

Furthermore, Chen Shuang had not shown up, which made him have some thoughts.

The Ji family’s supreme treasure, the Evil Eye Sword, the Jee family’s treasure trove, the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes, and even the ghost realm’s supreme treasure, the Judge’s Brush, which could reverse life and death…

Any one of them could probably increase their chances of survival in this battle, or they might even advance further.
