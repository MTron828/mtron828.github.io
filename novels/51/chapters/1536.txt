Chapter 1537: Chapter 1,537, crushing with one hand! 1

The figure got closer and closer, gradually turning from a small blackie dot in the distance into a blurry figure.

“It’s... Qin Yu!”Someone exclaimed.

“Qin Yu is here as expected! I knew he wouldn’t just sit by and do nothing at a time like this!”

“One Qin Yu can’t change the outcome of the battle at all, unless one of the three maniacs and three uniques joins the battle.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s figure was already getting closer and closer. Soon, he arrived in the sky above the heavenly cloud sect.

Everyone looked at Qin Yu with different expressions on their faces.

“Qin Yu?”First Elder’s expression darkened. He couldn’t help but gnash his teeth as he said, “What is this little bastard doing here?”

The deputy sect leader’s brows also furrowed slightly.

Qin Yu’s participation in the battle was very likely to break the current balance.

“Qin Yu?”A smile surfaced on Yong Ji’s face.

He looked in Qin Yu’s direction and laughed loudly, “If Qin Yu participates in the battle, Your Heavenly Cloud sect will definitely lose!”

“I’ve already said that we must get rid of this Qin Yu. You didn’t Listen!”First Elder looked at the deputy sect leader and shouted angrily.

The deputy sect master knew that he was in the wrong. He gritted his teeth and said, “Leave this Qin Yu to me!”

......

“You? So what if I leave him to you? Any one of you can change the situation of this battle!”First Elder’s face was filled with anger.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already arrived in the sky above the heavenly cloud sect.

He lowered his head and looked down, his gaze extremely cold.

For a moment, the scene was silent, as if everyone was waiting for Qin Yu’s position.

Qin Yu coldly swept his gaze across the scene. His gaze landed on the group of black-robed men.

“The people of the northern lands are here as expected.”Qin Yu’s expression became even colder.

However, he was in no hurry to make a move against the northern lands. The most important thing now was to get rid of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Today is the day of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s death.”

After a long time, Qin Yu finally spoke.

Upon hearing this, Yong Ji and the others were instantly incomparably excited. Some even cheered and shouted!

On the other hand, the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s faces were ashen. They were incomparably furious and despairing!

“This Qin Yu...”first elder gritted his teeth. At this moment, he wished he could tear Qin Yu apart alive!

“Qin Yu, you came well!”Yong Ji waved his hand at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t like Yong Ji, but the enemy of an enemy was a friend. Since everyone was on the same side, Qin Yu nodded at him.

Then, Qin Yu jumped down from the godly eagle and stood beside Yong Ji.

He swept his gaze across the crowd and finally landed on Huai Chang.

The coldness in his eyes made Huai Chang feel that something was wrong.

He took the initiative to break the deadlock and said with a smile, “I’ve long heard of Qin Yu’s great name. Today, I finally get to meet him.”

“My Great Name?”Qin Yu’s eyes turned cold before he sneered, “That’s right. Hasn’t the northern lands always wanted to kill me?”

“Kill You? This is completely a rumor!”Huai Chang waved his hand repeatedly.

“Rumor? If it wasn’t for the fact that I was lucky enough to step into the mighty realm, I’m afraid I would have already died at the hands of Sima Bei,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Huai Chang’s expression changed slightly. He seemed to have realized something and hurriedly asked, “Where is Lord Sima Bei?”

“I don’t know where Sima Bei is. In short, his body has already been killed by me,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Huai Chang immediately flew into a rage. “You... you actually killed Lord Sima Bei?”

However, Huai Chang quickly realized that something was wrong. He smiled and said, “You’re bragging. Lord Sima Bei is invincible under the heavens. How can you deal with him?”

Yong Ji, who was standing at the side, seemed to sense that something was wrong. He hurriedly tried to smooth things over and said, “The two of you, our current enemy is the Tianyun sect. Don’t start an internal conflict.”

Qin Yu glanced at Yong Ji and said, “I’m here for my personal grudge, not to join forces with you.”

Although Yong Ji was a little displeased, he still smiled and said, “No matter what the purpose is, our vision is the same.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Stop talking nonsense and make your move,”Huai Chang said coldly.

After saying that, he directly rushed toward the first elder!

Qin Yu slowly clenched his fist and prepared to kill the first elder.

At this moment, the deputy sect master leaped over and arrived in front of Qin Yu.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Your opponent is me.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “You are not my opponent. The person I want to kill is the first elder.”

“Cut the crap! Anyone who invades my Tianyun sect is my enemy!”The deputy sect master shouted loudly, and the internal Qi in his body began to surge!

He opened his mouth and spat out a small golden sword. The spiritual energy sword’s aura was magnificent and came straight for Qin Yu’s glabella!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He stretched out two fingers and caught the small sword in his hand!

In the next second, Qin Yu exerted force with his fingers and actually shattered the small sword!

The deputy sect leader’s face could not help but change greatly!

Although this spell was not his trump card, it was still one of the famous spells and had endless power!

But now, this spell was actually easily broken by Qin Yu. How could he not be shocked!

“If you have any ability, then use it. Otherwise, there will be no chance,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The deputy sect leader knew that the current Qin Yu could no longer be compared to him. Therefore, he did not dare to hide his strength anymore. He immediately roared and began to cast a spell, forming a seal!

The huge mark contained the deputy sect leader’s determination. He narrowed his eyes and forced out a drop of blood essence from between his brows!

Blood essence entered the mark, and the mark instantly became even bigger. Its power could be said to be endless!

“It’s the vice sect master’s firmament Saint Seal.”Someone in the dark recognized this technique.

“That’s right. Just now, the vice sect master repeatedly used this technique to force Huai Chang back, and even nearly suppressed him.”

“Qin Yu has already stepped into the mighty realm. Clearly, the vice sect master doesn’t dare to be negligent.”

Huai Chang also noticed this scene and couldn’t help but sneer.

“Even I don’t dare to neglect the power of the firmament saint seal. I’d like to see how you deal with it.”Huai Chang snorted coldly.

As he spoke, the firmament Saint Seal had already blotted out the sky and covered the earth as it headed straight for Qin Yu!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s expression was incomparably calm. The Aura on his body was like a pool of stagnant water, making it impossible for others to sense his internal Qi.

Looking at this crushing Saint Seal, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

In the next second, Qin Yu slowly raised his palm.

His palm casually faced the sacred seal.

“Rumble!”

At the moment of contact, golden light rose in all directions. The sacred seal that was crushing towards him seemed to be held up by Qin Yu, unable to take even half a step closer!

“HMM? What’s going on?”For a moment, everyone was stunned by this scene!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s finger curled up slightly, and a terrifying force instantly shot out from his finger.

Boom

The enormous mark directly exploded!

The Cang Heaven Sacred Seal that the deputy sect leader had formed was actually crushed by Qin Yu with one hand!
