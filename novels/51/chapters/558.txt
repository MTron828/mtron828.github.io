Chapter 559: Rencounter Yan Jiang! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, Qin Yu finally understood how to step into the Martial Marquis!

The Martial Marquis Realm corresponded to the Golden Core Stage. Once he stepped into the Golden Core Stage, all his cultivation would be in the Golden Core Stage! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As a chaotic body, Qin Yu could cultivate both Dark Energy and Bright Energy!

To Qin Yu, the opportunity to step into the Martial Marquis was the fusion of Dark Energy and Bright Energy!

Once the fusion was successful, the Golden Core would be formed and he would step into the true Martial Marquis Realm!

“Unfortunately... stepping into the Martial Marquis realm requires peace and quiet. I can’t be disturbed at all.” Qin Yu quickly became despondent again.

Although he had comprehended how to step into the Martial Marquis realm, how could there still be a chance?

“If only I thought of it earlier...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little sad and indignant.

Success was right in front of his eyes, but he had lost the opportunity. Anguish and despair was written all over his face.

“Little b*astard, to be able to resist, you’re quite impressive,” Gu Canghai said coldly.

As he spoke, Gu Canghai raised both of his hands, as if he was condensing some spell.

A terrifying light exploded in Gu Canghai’s palms!

“Go to h*ll!”

Accompanied by Gu Canghai’s explosive roar, this ray of light, which contained a strong murderous internal qi, ruthlessly smashed towards Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

However, at this moment, a burst of internal qi suddenly shot over from not far away before colliding with Gu Canghai’s spell!

A huge explosion instantly shattered this room!

The surrounding people were pushed back dozens of meters, and some people were even turned into meat paste on the spot!

“Who is it?!” Gu Canghai’s expression turned cold as he berated coldly.

A man around 40 years old slowly walked in from the door.

Qin Yu was instantly stunned when he saw this man.

“Yan... Yan Jiang?! You’re not dead?!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but gape as a trace of excitement appeared in his eyes!

He wanted to stand up, but his injuries were too severe and he couldn’t stand up at all.

“Yan Jiang...” Qin Yu used all his strength to say these words.

Yan Jiang glanced at Qin Yu and nodded slightly.

“Yan Jiang, why are you here?” Gu Canghai said coldly.

Yan Jiang said in a deep voice, “Miss Yan told me to protect Qin Yu well.”

Qin Yu’s heart was filled with gratitude.

Qin Yu didn’t expect that Yan Jiang still remembered Yan Ruoxue’s order even to this day.

“Hahahaha!” Gu Canghai couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Miss Yan is no longer the eldest daughter of the Yan family. Why do you have to be so persistent?” Gu Canghai said indifferently.

Yan Jiang said coldly, “In my heart, she will always be the eldest daughter of the Yan family.”

Gu Canghai narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “As a member of the Yan family, you actually want to disobey President Yan’s orders?!”

“I only listen to the orders of Miss Yan,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

Gu Canghai’s expression instantly turned cold.

He took a deep breath and said, “Yan Jiang, I remember that you’re only at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, right? Do you think you can stop me?”

“How would I know if I don’t try?” The internal qi on Yan Jiang’s body also began to surge! The strength of a half-step Martial Marquis was fully displayed at this moment!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gape! He never thought that not only did Yan Jiang not die, but he even stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!

“Half-step Martial Marquis?” Gu Canghai sneered.

“A mere half-step Martial Marquis wants to stop me? What a joke!”

Yan Jiang didn’t say anything. His mouth was open, as if he was casting some kind of spell.

In a short instant, the internal qi on Yan Jiang’s body began to surge again!

He had stepped into the Martial Marquis realm from the half-step Martial Marquis Realm!

This kind of spell was exactly the same as the one Han Wei had used that day!

“As Miss Yan’s bodyguard, Old Mister Yan once brought me to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s library. When necessary, I can forcefully step into the Martial Marquis Realm,” Yan Jiang said coldly.

Gu Canghai’s expression became even colder.

Seeing that Yan Jiang had stopped him just when he was about to succeed, how could Gu Canghai not be angry?!

“So what if you forcefully step into the Martial Marquis realm? You can hold on for half an hour at most!” Gu Canghai said coldly.

“In half an hour, killing you will be a piece of cake!”

Yan Jiang said coldly, “No need for nonsense. Do it.”

“You’re courting death!” Gu Canghai was instantly furious. He curled his palm and grabbed at Yan Jiang!

Yan Jiang’s expression was ice-cold. He clenched his fist and met the attack head-on!

A great battle was about to break out. Both of them were Martial Marquises, and it was difficult to determine who was stronger!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. If he could step into the Martial Marquis Realm in this half an hour, then he could turn the tables!

“I must cherish the time that Yan Jiang has bought for me...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He gritted his teeth and adjusted his state of mind.

Then, Qin Yu closed his eyes and began to try to fuse the dark energy and spiritual energy in his dantian.

Under the guidance of Qin Yu’s powerful spiritual sense, the spiritual energy and dark energy in his dantian, which had never interfered with each other, began to try to touch each other at this moment.

“Bang!!”

However, the moment they touched, an explosive sound was produced in the dantian! Qin Yu felt a sharp pain in his abdomen!

It wasn’t that easy to fuse the two opposing internal qi.

However, Qin Yu couldn’t care about that anymore. He endured the pain and forcefully tried to fuse them.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!!”

Crisp sounds rang out in Qin Yu’s dantian.

The two internal qi were constantly repelling each other!

The intense pain made Qin Yu’s forehead break out in cold sweat. However, he didn’t dare to waste any time. He tried his best to fuse the Dark Energy and Bright Energy internal qi!

“Crack!”

Finally, under Qin Yu’s hard work, the two internal qi began to fuse!

“There’s a chance!” Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

He immediately struck while the iron was hot and used all his mental strength to guide the fusion of the Dark Energy and Bright Energy internal qi.

“Crack...”

Following the fusion of the two internal qi, Qin Yu’s dantian continued to emit sounds!

However, these two internal qi were extremely huge. It wasn’t so easy to complete the fusion within a short period of time.

“No... I have to be faster!” Qin Yu was so anxious that he bared his teeth. He tried his best to guide the fusion without daring to delay even the slightest bit!

“Boom!”

Not far away, the battle between Yan Jiang and Gu Canghai was still ongoing!

However, Yan Jiang had relied on a secret technique to forcefully enter the Martial Marquis Realm. Compared to Gu Canghai, who was already in the Martial Marquis realm, he was clearly inferior.

“Clang!”

At this moment, Gu Canghai’s palm struck Yan Jiang’s chest. Yan Jiang was instantly sent flying several meters away, and his mouth was bleeding non-stop!

“Yan Jiang, I advise you to stop. Otherwise, you will definitely die today!” Gu Canghai shouted loudly.

Yan Jiang wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and said coldly, “Stop talking nonsense. Unless I die here, you can forget about killing Qin Yu!”

“Okay, then I will kill you first!” Gu Canghai’s hair flapped wildly as he rushed toward Yan Jiang again!
