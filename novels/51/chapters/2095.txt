2096 The Arrogant Yao Xi

Seeing Teng Zixu’s terrifying internal qi, Si Qianjing and the others had no choice but to give up.

“Zi Xu’s strength is really terrifying,” Si Qianjing said coldly.

The others did not utter a word. Teng Zixu’s strength was indeed terrifying. No wonder he was known as the number one of the younger generation!

With such strength, he probably really had the potential to attain dao!

Qin Yu was silent. The heaven’s favorites of this life seemed to be even more terrifying. Compared to Si Shiyue and the others, the impact of Teng Zi Xu was undoubtedly even more terrifying.

Immortal Crane glanced at Teng Zixu without saying anything. He placed his hands behind his back and glanced at Qin Yu. There seemed to be something conveyed through his eyes.

Qin Yu was shocked and whispered to himself, “Immortal Crane recognized me as expected.”

Immortal Crane slowly retreated and walked away from the Teng family, disappearing from everyone’s sight.

Teng Tian looked at Teng Zixu with a complicated expression but did not say anything.

Everyone’s expression was ugly. This matter had tremendously embarrassed them.

The representative of the demon race could just escape this way, and they could not do anything.

The atmosphere of the banquet suddenly became gloomy. Although Teng Zixu, Teng Tian, and the others wanted to salvage the situation, everyone had some reservations in their hearts. Their conversations and laughter were no longer light-hearted and enjoyable.

Qin Yu kept thinking about Immortal Crane’s words. He knew Immortal Crane had come to the Teng family on behalf of the demon race to give them a warning.

The days to come were likely to be stormy and turbulent. The competition between the human race and the demon race would definitely become more intense.

The banquet ended in a depressing atmosphere. Qin Yu bade farewell to Saintess Gu, Holy Son Jiang, and the others. He knew in his heart that he needed to improve his strength as soon as possible to prepare for what might happen in the future.

The crowd gradually dispersed. Yan Ruoxue hurriedly ran to Qin Yu’s side and said, “That mysterious person just now seemed to come from the same place as us.”

Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue and looked worried for a moment.

He looked around, and after making sure no one was around, he asked softly, “What are your plans? The appearance of the demon race seems to have pushed Immortal Crane to the opposite side. I…”

“What plan?” Yan Ruoxue patted Qin Yu’s head and whispered, “Didn’t the appearance of the demon race attract the attention of the other great aristocratic families? Moreover, there was no distinction between good and evil. Everyone was just doing it for their own benefits.”

Yan Ruoxue paused for a moment and whispered, “If we can’t escape when the time comes, we might as well hide in the depths of Azure Rock Forest. With your relationship, the demon race shouldn’t do anything to us, right?”

Qin Yu was stunned. He never expected Yan Ruoxue’s thought to be so straightforward.

Compared to his indecisiveness, Yan Ruoxue, a mere woman, appeared more straightforward.

Yan Ruoxue nodded and said,” Yes, the Yan family has been treating me well. I shouldn’t have done anything to let them down. But if they force me to marry Si Shiyue, I have no choice.”

“Alright.” Qin Yu also did not want to overthink.

Who would care what race it was, as surviving was the most important thing!

Once, someone had walked out from the depths of Azure Rock Forest and provided a large number of treasures to rogue cultivators. Speaking of which, this demon race might not be the existence that would invade the human race.

After that, Qin Yu said goodbye to Yan Ruoxue and planned to leave.

Qin Yu walked toward the nearby teleportation formation, planning to return to Thunder Courtyard directly.

However, not long after, Qin Yu sensed that something was wrong.

In the dark, someone seemed to be following him.

“As expected, these people are unwilling to let me leave just like this.” Qin Yu sighed in his heart.

Thus he stopped in his tracks and quietly mobilized his internal qi, waiting for the other party to appear

A few minutes later.

An elderly man walked out of the dark.

He stood behind Qin Yu and said quietly, “Why aren’t you leaving?”

“I’m waiting for you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Waiting for me? Do you know who I am?” the elderly man said indifferently.

“It doesn’t matter who you are. What matters is what you want to do.” Qin Yu’s voice became even colder.

Before he could finish speaking, the elderly man suddenly stretched out his palm and charged straight at Qin Yu’s back! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Clang!”

The palm landed solidly on Qin Yu’s back, making a loud sound!

As for the elderly man, he was forced several steps back by the impact, and his palm became numb!

“So this is the chaotic body? What a tough body!” the elderly man exclaimed.

Qin Yu slowly turned around and sneered. “It’s not only because of my special physique but also the unique divine robe of Wu Ji.”

The elderly man narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Wu Ji’s divine robe… It seems you have obtained quite a number of supreme treasures from the Chaos Grave!”

Qin Yu didn’t want to waste time with him and shouted, “You’re a True Saint. If you want to kill me, you don’t have to waste your breath. Just burn your blood essence and fight me.”

“Hahaha!” Having heard Qin Yu’s words, the elderly man burst out laughing.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Although I don’t like you, Dean Lei has made a statement. I certainly won’t attack you.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He did not understand what he meant.

“I’m not the one who wants to attack you,” the elderly man continued.

“Who is that then?” Qin Yu frowned.

“It’s me!”

At this moment, a loud shout sounded!

Looking over, he saw that it was Yao Xi!

Yao Xi was dressed in white with gold embroidery. He looked simple but exuded a noble aura.

His face was handsome, his eyes were like stars, his shoulders were wide, and his waist was slender. It gave off a handsome and unrestrained feeling. His brows revealed a wild and unruly aura, but at the same time, there was a hint of gloominess.

“Holy Son.” The elderly man bowed and retreated to the side.

Qin Yu looked at Yao Xi coldly and said, “It’s you!”

“Why? Are you surprised?” Yao Xi said coldly.

“I’m indeed a little surprised. I didn’t expect the first Saint Child to fight me to be you, and I didn’t expect you to dare to fight me.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Yao Xi narrowed his eyes and laughed heartily. “Qin Yu, do you think that you are invincible in the same realm? You’re so ignorant! Your so-called invincibility is only against ordinary cultivators. In front of your bloodline, your so-called chaotic body physique is nothing!”

“Cut the crap. Let’s do it,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Yes, yes, yes. Fight quickly. I also want to watch the show.” Right at this moment, Holy Son Jiang appeared out of nowhere, and Saintess Gu was beside him.

Yao Xi frowned slightly as if he had not expected to see these two people.
