Chapter 183: Backlash! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qiu Feng roared crazily, and the dark energy in his body was released in an instant!

The immense amount of dark energy caused the surrounding temperature to drop abruptly!

Even Qin Yu felt a chill!

Qiu Feng didn’t stop. He urged the dark energy in his body with all his might, and then a black shadow condensed in mid-air!

This black shadow was extremely huge and looked like a skeleton. Traces of dangerous aura slowly spread out from the internal qi!

Qin Yu frowned. He didn’t quite understand.

Qiu Feng clearly knew that he could absorb dark energy. Why did he still use dark energy to fight?

Wasn’t he giving him nourishment?

“Hehe...” Qiu Feng opened his mouth and snickered.

“Qin Yu, this technique is inherited from the sect and has a history spanning several hundred years! Under this move, without a doubt, you will die!”

Layers of sweat appeared on Qiu Feng’s forehead, and he seemed to be somewhat dispirited.

It was very obvious that this technique had exhausted him greatly.

“Qin Yu, prepare to die!” Very quickly, Qiu Feng clasped his hands together and activated the technique!

The huge skeleton that he condensed instantly arrived in front of Qin Yu!

It held a large saber in its hand and slashed at Qin Yu fiercely!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent and hurriedly clenched his fist to defend himself!

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that this punch actually went straight through! It didn’t even touch the skeleton!

In the next second, Qin Yu felt as if his abdomen had been struck by lightning!

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu, a grave expression appearing on his face, hurriedly retreated.

Qiu Feng, who was a short distance away, sneered. “This thing isn’t solid. Every move and stance will take away the internal qi in your body! Wait until I completely absorb your internal qi, then without a doubt, you will die!”

The huge skeleton swung its saber at Qin Yu again!

Its speed was so fast that it left afterimages!

Even Qin Yu couldn’t dodge in time!

It penetrated Qin Yu’s body in several consecutive moves.

And with each move, Qin Yu felt his internal qi weaken a little!

“If this continues, I will really die here today.” Qin Yu’s face flashed with seriousness.

He tried to use spiritual energy to resist, but unfortunately, spiritual energy was useless against the skeleton.

Because the dark energy in Qiu Feng’s body was too abundant, it was far from what Qin Yu could compare to!

“Swish swish swish”

The large saber was still brandished, forcing Qin Yu to retreat repeatedly!

In the car, Wei Jiang was trembling as he watched!

Was this still the Qiu Feng he knew?

“Wei Ming, what... what is that thing...” Wei Jiang said while trembling.

Wei Ming said in a sullen voice, “It’s a kind of technique from the southwest, but I don’t know exactly what it is.”

“Will anything happen to Qin Yu? If something happens to him, then I’ll be a sinner...” Wei Jiang’s expression was a little ugly.

If Yan Ruoxue were to blame him, then he would be screwed!

“Don’t worry.” Wei Ming shook his head.

“Mr. Qin will definitely be fine.”

After witnessing “miracles” time and time again, Wei Ming had more and more trust in Qin Yu.

Every time he thought that Qin Yu would die for sure, Qin Yu blew his mind.

Wei Ming believed that this time was no exception.

Qin Yu continued to dodge. He even used his spiritual fire, but he couldn’t hurt the skeleton.

“Hehe, Qin Yu, under this technique, all your attacks are ineffective! I will slowly torture you to death!” A short distance away, Qiu Feng roared crazily!

Qin Yu didn’t make a sound. His expression was calm as he dodged while thinking about something.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body suddenly stood still in spot.

Facing the skeleton’s huge blade, he didn’t move at all. Instead, he closed his eyes!

“Qin Yu isn’t moving!” Wei Jiang, who was in the car, immediately panicked!

Even Wei Ming suddenly stood up and stared out of the window!

Could it be that... Qin Yu was really going to die here? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Hehe, have you given up resisting?” Qiu Feng, who was a short distance away, sneered.

After he roared angrily, the skeleton swung its saber and fell down!

But what was surprising was that after this saber fell, it didn’t swing its saber a second time!

“Huh? What’s going on?” Qiu Feng’s expression changed drastically!

The skeleton tried to pull out its saber many times but failed!

It was as if his saber was captured by Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression was cold and his eyes were closed.

The faint internal qi from before actually started to rise at this moment!

On the contrary, the skeleton’s dark energy started to slowly disappear!

Qiu Feng’s expression changed drastically! He suddenly felt as if the dark energy in his body was about to be absorbed!

“If you can absorb my internal qi, I can also absorb yours.” Qin Yu, the corners of his mouth curling into a sneer, raised his head.

“This kid actually wants to retaliate!” Qiu Feng’s face instantly turned extremely pale!

The reason why this skeleton could reduce Qin Yu’s internal qi was very simple. It absorbed Qin Yu’s internal spiritual energy and dark energy!

Every time the blade fell, there would be a short pause.

And this pause was the process of absorbing Qin Yu’s internal qi.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu took advantage of this gap and began to fight back!

The skeleton’s internal qi was dissipating, and Qiu Feng, who was using this technique, felt that his strength was getting weaker!

“How is this possible?!” Qiu Feng panicked. He wanted to stop, but he realized that it was too late!

Qin Yu ravenously devoured the dark energy in Qiu Feng’s body!

A huge amount of dark energy was sucked into Qin Yu’s body along with the skeleton!

“Ah! !”

Qiu Feng’s body began to twitch and curl, and a sharp pain came from his abdomen!

“This kid... how did he counter this technique...” Beads of sweat dripped down Qiu Feng’s forehead!

No one had ever been able to counter this technique!

“If this continues, I will definitely die here!” Qiu Feng was flustered and extremely anxious!

“Looks like I can only give up this body.” Qiu Feng’s mind raced.

He had already used this body for a long time. Relying on Qiu Feng’s position in Chuzhou, he had absorbed an unknown amount of dark energy!

Now, he was naturally unwilling to give up!

“Brat, just you wait. I will definitely take revenge!”

In the next second, Qiu Feng suddenly collapsed to the ground.

Black shadows floated out of his body and disappeared into the horizon.

The skeleton in front of Qin Yu also quickly disappeared.

Qin Yu opened his eyes and looked at Qiu Feng. He frowned and said, “It’s as I expected. It’s a pity that he escaped.”

As he looked at Qiu Feng, Qin Yu’s expression was calm.

Then, he said with a smile, “But this is enough. Such a huge amount of dark energy is probably enough to support me to advance to the third level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.”
