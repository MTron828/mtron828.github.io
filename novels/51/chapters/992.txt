Chapter 993: Chapter 993, the power of lightning

That muffled bolt of lightning rapidly smashed towards Qin Yu!

When he was a few hundred meters away, Qin Yu felt that terrifying pressure!

And when he was only a hundred meters away, Qin Yu’s entire body was directly slammed onto the ground!

He tried to get up, but he struggled and couldn’t get up at all!

Most importantly, Qin Yu still needed to spend some effort to control that divine sense!

He could not do two things at once. Now that he was faced with a dilemma, Qin Yu had no choice!

He roared angrily, and his entire body burst out with golden light, intending to forcibly resist!

He put all his attention on the fusion of controlling the divine sense and the Jindan!

As for this heavenly tribulation, he could just let it hit his body with all his strength!

“Boom!”

Finally, the heavenly tribulation ruthlessly smashed into Qin Yu’s body!

“Ah! ! !”

A painful wail suddenly sounded out!

That heavenly tribulation was like a cannonball, almost instantly blasting Qin Yu’s skin and flesh into pieces, causing blood and flesh to fly everywhere!

His bones were shattered, and the power of lightning spread throughout Qin Yu’s entire body!

The Golden Light had long disappeared without a trace, and under the influence of the power of lightning, Qin Yu’s body, no matter how tough it was, began to crumble!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and endured the pain.

However, the pain would definitely affect his divine sense.

Under this intense pain, Qin Yu was already unable to maintain his focus.

The violent power appeared once again, and his golden core was crumbling bit by bit!

“Boom!”

Without waiting for Qin Yu to make a countermeasure, the fourth lightning tribulation had already smashed down!

Seeing this lightning tribulation, Qin Yu was instantly filled with despair!

Countless blue lights completely soaked Qin Yu’s body.

Those traces of blue lights directly entered Qin Yu’s body!

It was as if it had its own divine sense. It suddenly passed through Qin Yu’s body and headed straight for the Golden Core!

“Not good!”Qin Yu’s expression changed greatly!

At this critical moment, if he were to be distracted for even a moment, he could be instantly turned into ashes!

“Swish!”

The lightning was like a sharp blade, slicing through Qin Yu’s golden core!

The fusion of divine sense and golden core stopped at this moment.

The Lightning in the outside world completely destroyed Qin Yu’s physical body.

“Bang!”

Qin Yu’s body fiercely fell to the ground.

The dark clouds in the sky also began to dissipate.

Under the Fourth Lightning Tribulation, Qin Yu was unable to withstand it in the end.

He had actually failed this tribulation.

Qin Yu fell to the ground. A trace of tears could not help but flow out from his black eyes.

The tears streaked across his face and dripped onto the ground. However, they instantly turned into steam.

“How could this be...”Qin Yu’s tears continued to flow out.

In order to become a martial saint, Qin Yu had paid so many prices!

But at the critical moment of becoming a martial saint, he had actually failed.

How Could Qin Yu Bear This!

He closed his eyes and felt the golden core in his body. He found that the cracks in the golden core had already spread.

The entire golden core was on the verge of collapse. Once he used his spiritual power again, the Golden Core would definitely explode!

This made Qin Yu even more desperate.

He collapsed on the ground, tears flowing endlessly. A sense of defeat arose spontaneously.

The scene was silent. Only the sound of Qin Yu sobbing could be heard.

“Hey... Don’t be too sad. It’s already a blessing in disguise that your golden core isn’t broken...”tie Dan comforted him.

Qin Yu clenched his fist and didn’t say a word.

His tears kept flowing down his face, almost washing away his dark cheeks.

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu slowly got up from the ground.

His expression was extremely cold. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Kid, Are You Alright?”Tie Dan asked in a deep voice.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I’m fine. I want to be quiet for a while.”

After he said that, Qin Yu found a seat and sat down cross-legged.

He closed his eyes slightly.

There was no internal Qi flowing around him. It was as if everything had stopped.

The whole night.

The next morning, Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes.

He stood up from the ground and said coldly, “I won’t give up just like that.”

“Yes, yes, yes. You just need to not use your spiritual power!”Tie Dan said quickly.

Qin Yu asked, “Can my jindan still be saved?”

Tie Dan pondered for a moment and said, “It’s hard to say. If we have the heavenly vanilla, coupled with our superb alchemy skills, it’s still possible to recover.”

“Heavenly vanilla... we still can’t avoid the heavenly vanilla,”Qin Yu whispered.

Tie Dan grunted and said, “Don’t you have the Purple Flame? I think your alchemy skills are not bad.”

“But I don’t know much about alchemy. You’d better find a professional alchemist to ask.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I understand.”

As long as one did not use spiritual power, the damage to the golden core would not increase.

If his golden core was not destroyed, he still had a chance.

“Can you still defeat a martial saint with my body?”Qin Yu asked.

“No problem,”tie Dan answered without thinking.

“I rely on my divine sense. I Won’t use your Golden Core.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Thank you.”

With that, Qin Yu planned to head to the Southern Mountain Village to save Yu Qin and the others.

But at that moment, Qin Yu spat out another mouthful of blood! Then, his face turned even paler.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said in a low voice, “It seems that the damage to the golden core has caused a more serious burden to the body...”

“This is inevitable,”tie Dan said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and rushed to the southern mountain village.

“Your body is full of wounds now. Why Don’t you recuperate first?”Tie Dan reminded him.

Qin Yu looked down at his body.

Sure enough, other than the wounds, his outer skin seemed to be charred. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu calculated the time.

There was only one day left from the three days Zeng Ji had mentioned.

Therefore, Qin Yu sat down cross-legged and planned to recover his body.

The wounds on his body were recovering bit by bit.

At this moment, a crackling sound suddenly came from the wounds on his body!

Although the sound was not loud, it was extremely ear-piercing.

Qin Yu looked down and saw that there were actually streaks of lightning within the wounds.

And after Qin Yu’s wounds recovered, the lightning even fused into his body!

Following that, Qin Yu was shocked to discover that after the lightning fused into his body, Qin Yu’s body became even harder!

“What’s going on?”Qin Yu turned pale with fright!

He tried to clench his fist, and to his shock, he discovered that his fist seemed to contain another powerful force!

This force was the power of the Lightning!
