1820 This Day Won’t Take Long

Everything was exactly the same as on Earth. As long as Qin Yu liked it, Yan Ruoxue would buy it without hesitation.

As a result, Qin Yu was a little embarrassed. He could only look straight ahead and not look at anything else.

Yan Ruoxue stayed by Qin Yu’s side the entire day.

She took Qin Yu to the famous historical sites in Zhongzhou. She took him to the tombs of the great cultivator of the Tribulation Stage, and even o the venue of the daoist rite left by the Immortal Emperor.

Of course, they couldn’t enter the venue because it had been sealed off by the major families. As undeveloped venues were full of dangers, no one dared to step in.

!!

Soon, the sky darkened, and the day seemed to have passed.

At night.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were sitting on a big rock, and the moonlight was shining on their faces.

Yan Ruoxue gently leaned on Qin Yu’s shoulder and said in a low voice, “Can we be like this forever?”

Qin Yu was silent for a while, then said, “It won’t take long for this day to come.”

After spending a day with Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu no longer had any fear in his heart. Even his inner demons were no longer haunting him.

She seemed to be the most powerful Pure Heart Sutra. As long as he was with her, it was as if all difficulties would disappear.

“Won’t you be blamed for not returning to the grand event for the entire day?” Qin Yu could not help but ask.

Yan Ruoxue laughed and said, “Silly you. I’ve said that nothing will happen to me.”

Although she said that, Qin Yu knew that the Yan family would definitely blame her.

Qin Yu did not expose her. He suddenly remembered what he had promised Tan Liu.

“By the way, does the Yan family still need people to do odd jobs?” Qin Yu asked.

“Why did you ask?” Yan Ruoxue asked in surprise. “Are you trying to use this opportunity to enter the Yan family?”

“Of course not.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Qin Yu then told Yan Ruoxue what had happened.

Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but laugh when she heard that Qin Yu had scammed the invitation letter.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I had no choice. To get into this event, I could only cheat him of his invitation letter. So, I want to ask if it’s convenient for you to let him enter the Yan family. He’s even willing to do odd jobs.”

“Of course, no problem,” Yan Ruoxue smiled and said.

“In a few days, ask him to go to the Yan family. There will be someone to receive him.”

“Thank you,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Is there anything else you need my help with?” Yan Ruoxue asked.

Qin Yu scratched his head. Speaking of which, there was indeed something.

“If it’s convenient, can you help me find Chang Mang?” Qin Yu asked.

“Chang Mang?” Yan Ruoxue was a little surprised. “Chang Mang from the Earth previously?”

“Yes, that’s him. He arrived at Holy Region a year earlier than me, and I’ve lost contact with him,” Qin Yu said.

“If it’s possible, ask him to go to Thunder Courtyard to find me.”

“Thunder Courtyard? You went to Thunder Courtyard?” Yan Ruoxue asked in surprise.

“Yes,” Qin Yu nodded and said. “I came to Zhongzhou this time through the teleportation formation of Thunder Courtyard.”

“Not bad. Thunder Courtyard’s power is comparable to any of the aristocratic families,” Yan Ruoxue smiled and said.

“Yes.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Qin Yu knew how rich the resources of Thunder Courtyard were. They were the best in the entire Holy Region.

“Then you don’t have to worry about Xi Shiyue. On the same platform, I believe you’re not worse than anyone else,” Yan Ruoxue said with a serious expression.

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with determination. He nodded hard and said, “I also think so.”

What f*cking Si Shiyue? D*mn it! Everyone would compete fairly, no one knew who would win until the end!

Just as the two of them were leaning on each other, a Divine Eagle suddenly appeared in front of them.

He hung in the air with his hands behind his back and said quietly, “Miss Yan, we should go back now.”

This person was none other than Uncle Yan.

Uncle Yan had shuttled through the void, so there was no need to say much about his strength.

“Alright.” Yan Ruoxue stood up, looked at Qin Yu, and said, “I’ll wait for you.”

Qin Yu nodded hard. At this moment, Uncle Yan’s gaze fixed on him.

His eyes were extremely sharp as if he wanted to see through Qin Yu!

Qin Yu was also looking at Uncle Yan. There was no fear in his eyes, only determination.

Uncle Yan didn’t say much. He turned around and disappeared into the void with Yan Ruoxue.

Everything in the surroundings returned to silence.

Qin Yu could not help but feel a little lonely.

However, after one day, Qin Yu’s previous worries and dejection were all swept away. What replaced them was a burning fighting spirit!

He gently clenched his fist and said softly, “I will never give up. No matter who I’m facing!”

…

In the Yan family.

Uncle Yan brought Yan Ruoxue back to the Yan family.

“That person is the Qin Yu you’ve mentioned?” Uncle Yan asked.

Yan Ruoxue quickly made a shushing gesture and said, “Uncle Yan, you must not tell anyone about this!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Uncle Yan sighed and said, “That Qin Yu looks pretty good. However, I’m afraid he’s far from Mr. Si. Why do you have to…”

“You don’t understand. Qin Yu has never lost to anyone.” Yan Ruoxue said with a face full of longing.

“One day, you will know that Qin Yu is the most powerful person in the Holy Region or even the entire universe!”

Uncle Yan was silent, but he was sighing in his heart.

He could tell that Qin Yu also had a chaotic body, and he could also see the strong will in him.

However, Qin Yu had started too late, and his current strength was not worth mentioning.

Compared to Si Shiyue, Qin Yu didn’t seem to have any advantage.

Si Shiyue also had a chaotic body, and the bloodline of the Immortal Emperor flowed in his body. How could Qin Yu be compared to him?

The bloodline of the Immortal Emperor was enough to override all other physiques!

In addition, Si Shiyue received the resources of the entire Si family. The gap between the two would only grow bigger.

Of course, Uncle Yan didn’t tell Yan Ruoxue about this. He knew that nothing he said would change her mind.

…

Qin Yu stood there for a long time. He didn’t return to the inn until late at night.

In the inn, Tan Liu had been waiting for a long time.

As soon as he saw Qin Yu, Tan Liu rushed toward him.

“I thought you wouldn’t come!” Tan Liu said with a nervous expression.

Qin Yu glanced at Tan Liu and said, “In a few days, you go to the Yan family. Someone will receive you.”

“Really?” Tan Liu was startled, he frowned and asked.

“Do I need to lie to you? If I wanted to lie to you, I wouldn’t have come back,” Qin Yu said, shaking his head.

Tan Liu seemed to feel that this was reasonable. Thus he asked tentatively, “Then whose name should I mention when I go to the Yan family? Yours, Shi Yuetie?”

“No need. You can just mention your name. Also, if you don’t want to die, don’t mention me to anyone,” Qin Yu said with a serious face.
