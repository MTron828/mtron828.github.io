Mysterious Bow

“Whoosh!”

Just as the rod was about to strike down, the enormous body suddenly shook violently.

A ball of flames suddenly erupted from the giant ogre’s body, and it lost all its strength as it charged toward Ju Wuwei.

Ju Wuwei dodged to the side, and the colossal demonic body grazed past him, smashing away.

In an instant, the body was burnt to a charred skeleton. “F*ck, what a terrifying power! What bow is this?”

The one who shot this arrow was certainly Qin Yu.

He had wanted to give it a try, but he had not expected it to be so powerful. An arrow had instantly killed the giant ogre.

“Thanks ”

Ju Wuwei leaned against a wall and bandaged the massive wounds on his body.

On the battlefield now, every strand of Saint power of the soul was a life-saving measure. It had to be used on the edge of the blade. A vast amount of Saint power surged into Qin Yu’s body, making him gasp.

He did not expect the giant ogre’s Saint power to be so potent, which had already surpassed the bear demon’s Saint power.

He pulled the bowstring once again and aimed at another giant ogre.

With the previous experience, his speed was much faster this time.

The moment he pulled the bowstring, waves of energy gathered in his palm, forming the shape of an arrow.

As the bowstring gradually pulled back, the arrow began to solidify into a tangible form.

A scorching force spread out from his palm. Halfway through pulling, his arm began to twitch violently.

After the initial arrow, his body had begun to tire, and the second time drawing the bow had reached the limit.

Strengthening!

Qin Yu’s arms started to tremble slightly. He forcefully injected about a third of his Saint power into his arms.

A powerful force instantly pierced through his arms. He pulled the bowstring back, but even with his strengthened arms, he could only pull the bowstring back by about 60%.

“Whoosh!”

A ray of light flashed and accurately pierced through another giant ogre.

“What a terrifying bowstring!”

Even seeing this arrow again, Qin Yu still felt his hair stand on end.

Another large amount of holy energy entered Qin Yu’s body. With the help of the bowstring, it was almost equivalent to cheating. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Originally, he definitely could not kill the giant ogre with his strength.

However, with this bowstring, it seemed to be different now. This battlefield could instead become the best place to increase his strength.

After killing two ogres consecutively, the situation on the battlefield was much better.

Qin Yu’s arm felt like on fire now. Even the slightest movement would cause a tearing pain. He would not be able to shoot another arrow in a short time unless he wasted precious Saint power to repair the injury on his arm.

“What a terrifying bow! That bow seems to be the Sun Chasing Bow. Why is it in his hands?”

A strange look flashed across the eyes of the green-robed demon race as he looked at the bowstring with greed.

“Thump! Thump! Thump!”

Another series of tremors sounded, and three more giant ogres climbed over the city walls. There were nearly 20 ogres.

They did not give them any chance to catch their breath. a huge tremor sounded.

In a massive tremor, one of the giant ogres was actually chasing him. However, the demon race young man was tremendously fast, so the ogre could not catch up to him.

Instead, it turned around and pounced toward Qin Yu. With its terrifying speed, it appeared before Qin Yu almost in the blink of an eye.

“Ding!”

With a flash of the blade, the giant ogre’s wrists were off.

It did not care at all. Its arms without palms swept toward Qin Yu like an iron rod.

Qin Yu’s body was sent flying. Fortunately, he had just strengthened his arms. He crossed his arms in front of himself, and the weapon in the hands of the giant ogre also tell to the ground.

Only then did Qin Yu save his life. He did not hesitate to use his Saint power to repair his broken arm and reconstruct the bones of his arm.

It almost consumed half of the Saint power of a giant ogre to reconstruct the arm.

Reconstructing the body would consume a significant amount of Saint power.

He pulled the bow again and killed this giant ogre directly. However, his reconstructed arm was stronger than before. This time, he did not have to pull the bow as hard as the first time.

Furthermore, he pulled the bowstring to about 50% before shooting the arrow. Although its power was reduced, it was enough to kill the giant ogre.

Previously, his arm could not withstand two arrows. Now, he should be able to shoot about three arrows.

After killing this giant ogre, Qin Yu silently analyzed the current situation.

“Enjoy!”

A mocking voice came from behind him. The demon race young man smiled evilly and licked his nostrils with his scarlet tongue.

hen his body suddenly disappeared, leaving behind a confused giant ogre.

After losing track of the demon race young man, it quickly locked onto Qin Yu as its target.

“F*ck, you tricked me, right? I had thought it was you who was behind this!” Qin Yu flew into a rage. He locked his gaze on the demon race young man.

The Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze suddenly opened its eyes, and a destructive power shot out from his eyes.

The demon race young man who had fled far away was sent flying by that enormous force.

A blood mist spurted out from his mouth, but he did not die. A vast amount of Saint power circulated through his body and instantly healed his injuries.

“Well, well, someone dares to make a move against me. I’ll remember you.” His sharp eyes stared fixedly at Qin Yu.

“This guy is not simple. He has the direct bloodline of the Holy Demon Race, the Emerald Serpent Witch. I’ve been targeting him for a long time. Even the ogres can’t do anything to him. Moreover, he should have an innate skill. It’s not a good thing to be targeted by him.”

Ju Wuwei said.

“I’ll remember you too! Can you hold off this ogre for a moment?”

Qin Yu turned around and asked.

“Yes, I can.”

Ju Wuwei did not say much and directly charged toward the ogre.

Qin Yu did not hesitate to draw the bow and directly pulled the bowstring to his limit.

Yin Lin’s expression changed drastically. His body moved at an incredible speed, which was actually much faster than the ogre.

His terrifying speed caused his body to seem to leave a trace of an afterimage.

Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze!

At this moment, the shock wave of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze was used. Yin Lin’s body was firmly targeted and he could not escape at all.

Strengthening!

Qin Yu once again strengthened his hands with all his remaining Saint power.

The bowstring was pulled back a little more, and a golden arrow pierced through the young man’s body.

“Bang!”

The body instantly exploded, but the soul’s Saint power did not flow to Qin Yu. “It’s actually an embodiment! Is this Yin Lin’s innate skill?”

Qin Yu frowned. Under the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he scanned the surrounding situation. However, he did not find Yin Lin’s true body, so he gave up.

It was a pity that he did not kill the true body..
