“Xiao Yu, what are you talking about?!” Mr. Wu scolded with a dark expression.

The girl called Xiao Yu didn’t care at all. She ran to Qin Yu’s side and looked left and right. Then she muttered, “There’s nothing impressive about him. He looks ordinary and even a little old.”

“Xiao Yu, don’t talk nonsense. Greet him properly!” Mr. Wu hurriedly scolded.

Qin Yu was amused. He looked at Mr. Wu and said, “Mr. Wu, is this your daughter?”

Mr. Wu forced a smile and said, “Yes, my daughter has been spoiled by me. Qin Yu, please don’t mind.”

“It’s okay.” Qin Yu shook his head. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Then, Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and said, “From your words, you seem to be very familiar with Ruoxue?”

“Of course! Ruoxue treats me very well!” Xiao Yu said proudly.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Since she was on good terms with Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu would naturally treat her well.

“Alright, Xiao Yu, go back to your room first. I have something to talk to Qin Yu about.” Mr. Wu waved his hand and said.

After sending Xiao Yu away, Mr. Wu said in a sullen voice, “Back then, Xiao Yu’s mother passed away unexpectedly because of work. So, I have felt very guilty towards Xiao Yu all these years. This also caused her to be a little rebellious and spoiled. Sigh.”

Qin Yu nodded. A child who grew up in a single-parent family like this was pitiful.

“Come, let’s eat first.” Mr. Wu raised his wine glass.

The two of them drank two bottles of white wine. Mr. Wu had been in the Military District for many years, and his tolerance for alcohol was also very good. He drank a bottle of white wine, but although his face was a little flushed, he didn’t lose his composure.

After eating, Mr. Wu stood up and said, “Qin Yu, it’s getting late. Why don’t you go to Xiao Yu’s room to have a look first?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I already know where the problem lies.”

“Oh really?” Mr. Wu was stunned and seemed to be a little surprised.

Qin Yu said, “Xiao Yu isn’t sick. She has been entangled by something foul, but I don’t know what exactly it is.”

Mr. Wu frowned and said in a sullen voice, “Others have said so, but I don’t believe in superstition at all. But since you have said so, I’m suspicious.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s normal. You’ve been in the Military District for many years, and you’re righteous. There won’t be any foul things around you, but that might not be the case for Xiao Yu.”

After saying that, Qin Yu stood up and walked into Xiao Yu’s room.

When he reached the door, Qin Yu said, “Mr. Wu, wait for me outside.”

“Okay.” Mr. Wu nodded.

After entering Xiao Yu’s room, Qin Yu restrained his internal qi and closed the door.

Xiao Yu was lying on the bed and playing with her phone. When she saw Qin Yu, Xiao Yu jumped up from the bed.

“What are you doing? Is it appropriate for an old man to run into a little girl’s room?” Xiao Yu rolled her eyes.

Qin Yu was amused. He said helplessly, “You have something foul on you. Do you know that?”

“Tsk.” Xiao Yu rolled her eyes.

“What era is this? You still believe in superstition? Aren’t you a little too lame?” Xiao Yu didn’t believe in Qin Yu at all.

Qin Yu said jokingly, “Then why do you have nightmares every night?”

“Having nightmares doesn’t mean anything. It only means that I’m too tired. I’ve been under too much pressure recently.” Xiao Yu pretended to be mature and sighed, but she looked rather funny to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sat next to Xiao Yu and said, “There’s really something foul on you, and it’s very scary.”

“Tsk, then call it out and let me take a look. I’ll kill it with one punch!” Xiao Yu raised her little fist and said angrily.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and then said, “Do you really want to see it?”

“Yes, if you can call it out, I’ll look. And I have to look carefully!” Xiao Yu said seriously.

“Okay, don’t be afraid later,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Tsk, as if you’re speaking the truth,” Xiao Yu rolled her eyes.

Qin Yu knew some stuff about mystical art, so he could tell at a glance that Xiao Yu was filled with evil energy.

However, Qin Yu knew nothing about how to exorcise ghosts.

He could only rely on his own guess to test it out.

Then, Qin Yu raised his hand and put it on Xiao Yu’s forehead.

“What are you doing?” Xiao Yu said with her eyes wide open.

Qin Yu said, “I’m going to help you exorcise the demon. Close your eyes.”

“Tsk.” Xiao Yu rolled her eyes at Qin Yu, but she still obediently closed her eyes.

Qin Yu could feel that there was a black gas on Xiao Yu’s forehead. This was the source.

The moment he placed his palm on Xiao Yu’s forehead, Qin Yu activated his spiritual energy and it surged towards Xiao Yu’s forehead.

In an instant, Xiao Yu’s forehead began to squirm slowly.

“It... it hurts!” Xiao Yu’s expression turned ugly, and her little face scrunched up tightly.

Qin Yu, still channeling the spiritual energy in his body, remained silent.

At this moment, traces of blood suddenly appeared on Xiao Yu’s forehead!

Then, a black shadow rushed out from between her brows!

The moment the black shadow appeared, it flew out of the window, as if it was trying to escape.

Qin Yu snorted. “Trying to escape?”

Qin Yu waved his hand, and a big blue hand instantly condensed in the air!

This big hand grabbed the black shadow and made it unable to move!

The black shadow instantly let out a shrill cry, and its voice was filled with fear, as well as menace. It sounded extremely horrifying!

“Ah! ! !”

When Xiao Yu saw this scene, she immediately let out a terrified roar!

Meanwhile, Mr. Wu, who was outside the door, hurriedly pushed the door open and entered!

“What’s going on?!” Mr. Wu shouted anxiously.

When he saw the black shadow in Qin Yu’s big hand, his expression suddenly changed!

“What... What is this?” Mr. Wu’s face was a bit pale as he asked.

Qin Yu said in a sullen voice, “I don’t know exactly what it is, but the dark energy on it... is really dense.”

The temperature in the entire room dropped by a few degrees!

Seeing the frightened expression on Xiao Yu’s face, Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to joke with her.

Just as Qin Yu was about to crush the big hand, a light flashed in his mind!

Then, the pores on Qin Yu’s body rapidly opened up, and this ball of black energy was actually absorbed into Qin Yu’s body!

“What... What’s going on?” Even Qin Yu himself was stunned!

This was clearly dark energy, which was a stark contrast to the spiritual energy that Qin Yu needed for cultivation. How could he possibly absorb this dark energy?

Most importantly, after absorbing this dark energy, Qin Yu could clearly feel that his strength had improved a little!

“Could it be that... I can cultivate both spiritual energy and dark energy at the same time?” Qin Yu suddenly thought of something, and immediately became ecstatic!

If that was really the case, then cultivating might be much easier for Qin Yu!

After the black energy was completely absorbed by Qin Yu, two black little bugs flew out.

“Parasites?” Qin Yu immediately frowned.

“Southwest parasites.” Qin Yu stretched out his hand and grabbed the two parasites.

Then, he handed these parasites to Xiao Yu.
