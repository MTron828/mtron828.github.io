Chapter 389: Fighting Qiao Wu Again! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“They’re three Inner Strength Grandmasters at the peak.” The Fifth Elder was quite worried.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It doesn’t matter. If they were ordinary Inner Strength Grandmasters, how could I test my strength?”

Currently, Qin Yu had already stepped into the peak of the Monastic Stage, but he didn’t know his own strength clearly. He only knew that the spiritual energy in his body was as vast as the sea, and his physical body had reached an indestructible state.

However, Qin Yu didn’t know what state he was in.

“Fifth Elder, we’ll meet again in the future.” Qin Yu bowed. After greeting everyone, he left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

This time, no one knew when he would return.

No one knew if he would return.

...

After walking out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the three of them appeared to be aimless on the streets.

Although Qinghe town was only a small town, it was quite prosperous.

In the streets and alleys, there were stalls set up everywhere.

There were snacks, toys, and herbs.

“Mr. Qin, where are we going now? Do you have any plans?” Yao Qing asked while stuffing pig trotters into his mouth.

“Eat your food. Can you help come up with any ideas?” Taozi rolled her eyes.

Yao Qing muttered, “No matter what we do, we have to have a plan.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I do have a plan, but it can’t be implemented for the time being. We can only take it one step at a time.”

“So let’s go back to Chuzhou for now.”

While they walked aimlessly on the street, they seemed leisurely, but in fact, it was like walking on thin ice.

Currently, Qin Yu had already become a sensation with all sorts of titles.

The son-in-law of the Yan family, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s pharmacist, the first person in history to pass the stairway to heaven...

Fortunately, Qin Yu wasn’t high profile, so not many people on the road knew him.

The moment Qin Yu left the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Qiao Wu had secretly set his eyes on Qin Yu.

“It’s better to tell President Yan about this in advance,” someone suggested.

Qiao Wu nodded slightly and said, “We must tell him this news.”

Qiao Wu took out his phone and informed Yan Sihai of this matter.

After Yan Sihai learned of this, he was immediately overjoyed.

He immediately gave an order, “Kill him immediately and bring his head back to see me.”

“Yes, Mr. Yan.” Qiao Wu hung up the phone.

However, he wasn’t in a hurry to make a move. Instead, he planned to wait until Qin Yu left Qinghe town before making a move, so as not to attract the attention of the people from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

...

Qin Yu, Yao Qing, and Taozi walked from day to night.

They didn’t use any means of transportation. They were like ascetic monks who could leave whenever they wanted and stop whenever they wanted.

The further they were from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, the thinner the spiritual energy became.

And in the evening, the three of them finally arrived in front of a stone tablet.

There were two big words written on the stone tablet: Qinghe town.

“Once we cross this place, we will leave Qinghe Town,” said Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, are we going to walk back to Chuzhou?” Yao Qing muttered.

Qin Yu shook his head and said indifferently, “We can’t go back to Chuzhou until we finish our business.”

“What do you mean?” Taozi was also a little confused.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He raised his foot and crossed the stone tablet. Then, he stood on a large grassland in front of him with his hands behind his back while quietly waiting for something.

“This place is more than a hundred kilometers away from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Even if we drive, it will take a few hours,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Aren’t you guys planning to come out?”

Yao Qing and Taozi were dumbfounded. They had no idea what Qin Yu was talking about.

“Since you know we are here, why did you still dare to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

At this moment, Qiao Wu and the others walked out from the dark.

The three peak Inner Strength Grandmasters looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Qin Yu...” Taozi looked a little scared.

“Don’t be afraid. I will protect you!” Yao Qing volunteered and blocked Taozi behind him.

Qin Yu looked at Qiao Wu and said with a nonchalant smile, “You really refuse to give up. What kind of benefits did the Yan family give you?”

“You don’t need to know!” Qiao Wu berated coldly.

“Qin Yu, because of you, the three of us can’t go back. We guard the vicinity of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion every day! We will settle this account with you!” Qiao Wu gnashed his teeth and said.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said with a cold smile, “If I were you, I would go home now.”

“Don’t worry. After we kill you, we will naturally go back,” Qiao Wu said sinisterly.

The internal qi on his body became more and more intense. During the period of time he was in Qinghe town, Qiao Wu’s strength had also increased slightly.

His current condition was his peak condition!

“Shouldn’t you think about why I dared to walk out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion openly?” Qin Yu asked indifferently. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Qiao Wu laughed loudly and said, “Of course it’s because you’re stupid! Qin Yu, although you are talented, I don’t believe that in three months, you can transform!”

“Is that so?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, then sneered. “Then come and try it.”

“Die!” Qiao Wu didn’t say anything more. He glared at Qin Yu and grabbed at him with both hands!

Two sharp gusts of wind tore through the air like sharp blades and grabbed at Qin Yu’s chest!

However, Qin Yu stood there without moving at all and allowed the two sharp claws to tear at him!

“Clang! Clang!”

The two streams of internal qi that were formed from internal strength fiercely grabbed onto Qin Yu’s chest!

However, what was shocking was that the moment they touched Qin Yu’s chest, the two streams of internal qi were directly shattered!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s clothes were torn, but only two white scars were left on his body!

“Not bad.” Qin Yu touched his chest and said indifferently.

Qiao Wu’s expression suddenly changed, and he exclaimed, “How is that possible?! Your physical body...”

“How is it? Is it very hard?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked.

Qiao Wu’s expression also gradually became serious.

The two Inner Strength Grandmasters beside him no longer simply watched the battle, and their bodies also erupted with powerful internal qi.

“Qin Yu, you really are a shocking fellow.” Qiao Wu narrowed his eyes and said.

“In time, I’m afraid I won’t be a match for you. But now... you’re still too inexperienced!”

Following Qiao Wu’s explosive shout, gusts of wind slowly condensed around his body!

Qiao Wu’s fists shook, and streams of ripple-like power condensed once again!

This technique was the technique that Qiao Wu had used previously!

It was also this spell that nearly killed Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu, let me see if you can survive the first level this time!” Qiao Wu roared crazily.

As soon as he finished speaking, streams of energy swept towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu sneered. “Is that all you have? Didn’t anyone tell you that the same move... is useless after the first time?!”

Following Qin Yu’s angry roar, the golden fist smashed towards the force!
