Chapter 1111: Chapter 1,111, the world under the sea! 

Feeling the traces of warmth, a trace of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

He reached out his palm, picked up a handful of water, and sent it into his mouth.

The moment the seawater entered his mouth, Qin Yu’s face was filled with ecstasy!

“This is... Spiritual Qi!”Qin Yu was beyond excited!

He immediately removed the water avoidance art and allowed the seawater to enter his body.

There was indeed spiritual Qi under the sea!

No wonder the demonic beasts under the sea had grown so terrifyingly.

That old man had summoned so many martial saint demonic beasts in one go!

One must know that even in the demon city, martial saints were as rare as Phoenix feathers and qilin horns. However, they seemed to be worthless here!

Qin Yu’s eyes swept his surroundings. He was enduring the pressure from the bottom of the sea, but his heart was extremely surging.

“Could it be that all the spiritual Qi on Earth has been gathered under the sea?”Qin Yu murmured.

Soon, Qin Yu had an even bolder idea. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Is there a possibility that the world of cultivators ten thousand years ago was submerged under the sea?”

The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more shocked he became. The exploration of the world under the sea was still in its initial stage.

No one knew what the world under the sea actually was.

“It’s not impossible. Otherwise, why would the number one sect in the world, the Church of massacre, be under the sea?”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

Such a large sect was not above the sea at all. On the contrary, it was under the sea. This was exactly what Qin Yu was thinking.

Qin Yu absorbed the Spiritual Qi from the bottom of the sea while trying to swim down to the bottom of the sea.

The lower he went, the denser the spiritual Qi became.

But at the same time, the pressure under the sea made Qin Yu unable to bear it.

The deepest exploration of the sea by humans was only more than 10,000 meters. No one knew what else was hidden under 10,000 meters.

Qin Yu endured the pressure on his body and continued to swim down to the bottom of the ocean.

As his body sank, the pressure became more and more intense. Soon, he felt that he could no longer bear it.

His entire body was tightly pressed down by the seawater, and his physical body was on the verge of shattering.

The green wood true body emitted a green light and fused with Qin Yu’s golden light.

In a short moment, a “Crack”was heard, and the green wood true body began to shatter!

Without the support of the green wood true body, Qin Yu’s body could not withstand it anymore.

The huge water pressure almost crushed his internal organs!

“Pu!”

Qin Yu suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, and his seven orifices and pores began to pour blood crazily.

“Not good!”Qin Yu’s expression changed greatly!

He did not dare to continue sinking down, but hurriedly swam upwards.

After swimming up for several hundred meters in one breath, the pressure around his body slightly eased.

Qin Yu once again used the true body of green wood to block this pressure.

However, the injury caused by his physical body still made Qin Yu’s heart palpitate.

“That was close.”Qin Yu wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, feeling his entire body turn cold.

If he had been a step slower just now, he would have been crushed into meat paste by the sea water!

“Although I almost died under the sea, I can almost be sure that there is an extremely rich spiritual qi hidden under the sea,”Qin Yu looked down and said in a low voice.

It was pitch black below, and Qin Yu couldn’t see clearly at all.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t dare to make a hasty conclusion about what was under the sea.

“I really want to go down and take a look,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

However, Qin Yu only dared to think about it. He had just sunk a little and almost died.

I have to think of a way to withstand the pressure, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Cultivation had a long history. In this long river of history, who knew how many heroes were born.

Qin Yu believed that someone must have also noticed the abnormality under the sea, but was restricted by the pressure.

Even Qin Yu’s body couldn’t withstand it, let alone others.

Qin Yu floated in the sea and found a critical position.

The pressure here wouldn’t hurt his body, but fortunately, he couldn’t absorb the spiritual Qi here.

“Just one more step,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

As long as his body was a little stronger, Qin Yu would have a chance to absorb the spiritual Qi from the bottom of the sea.

“What a pity.”Qin Yu sighed, his heart filled with unwillingness.

However, it was also good that he had at least discovered the spiritual Qi from the bottom of the sea.

“When I enter the intermediate stage of the martial saint stage, or the green wood true body takes another step forward, I will be able to try to absorb the spiritual Qi from the bottom of the sea.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just as Qin Yu was guessing, he suddenly felt a powerful internal Qi approaching him!

This internal Qi was extremely powerful and extremely fast!

“What a fast speed!”Qin Yu exclaimed.

“Could it be... That Yun Long?”

Before Qin Yu could react, Yun Long’s figure had already arrived near Qin Yu!

“Kid, I’ve finally found you!”Yun Long’s furious voice shook the seawater, as if it was boiling!

He glared at Qin Yu and said through gritted teeth, “Kid, you actually dare to trick me! I’ll definitely tear you into pieces!”

Qin Yu sneered, “Yun Long, you came really fast. I really didn’t expect to be discovered by you so quickly.”

Yun long said in a sinister manner, “Cut the crap. If I don’t kill you, I swear I won’t be a human!”

“You’re not a human in the first place,”Qin Yu mocked.

“F * ck you!”

Yun long roared and arrived in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye!

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

What a fast speed!

At the same time, Yun Long had already clenched his fist and was approaching Qin Yu’s glabella!

Qin Yu did not dare to delay and hurriedly clenched his fist to meet the attack.

But at this moment, Qin Yu realized that under the sea water, his speed and strength were greatly weakened!

At the moment of contact, a terrifying force exploded on Qin Yu’s fist! The palm of his hand instantly shattered, and Qin Yu’s body also shot backward!

“Oh no!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

He had neglected the fact that the Cloud Dragon was a demonic beast! Under the seawater, Qin Yu was definitely not the cloud dragon’s match!
