2526 The Human Race’s Expedition

Qin Yu continued with a solemn expression, “In my battle with Si Shiyue, in the end, I used the power of the Primordial Chaos I combined the three powers to clash with the Elemental Black Hole that Si Shiyue combined the five elements. I touched a kind of cage power, a huge cage that locked heaven and earth. At that moment, I seemed to feel a terrifying killing intent. I felt the power behind it could easily kill me. If it wasn’t for Su Xinghe, I don’t know what would have happened.”

“I had a vague comprehension before, and now that you’ve said it, I’m even more certain. It seems to be above us. Our every move is under the surveillance of others. Once we touch that cage, I’m afraid we’ll suffer an unimaginable calamity.”

Yan Ruoxue’s face turned pale.

Whenever she attempted to explore her personal space, she seemed to encounter immense resistance. There were some crucial aspects that she had not quite grasped yet.

Now, it seemed that this power had encountered another kind of resistance.

“However, we’re still not strong enough. The power of the rules of the Ni Temple of Heaven is obviously much stronger than my space. Moreover, ever since it was taken away by Immortal Crane, the power of the rules contained within has become even stronger. Therefore, there must be other ways to increase our strength.”

Yan Ruxue frowned. She had reached a limit that was difficult for her to break through.

“Yes, Si Shiyue’s strength should be much stronger than mine. He gives me the feeling that he’s a different person. This change in personality makes me suspect that he must have also seen something through the Way of Five Elements, or the Way of Cosmic Luck of chaotic body, or something else.”

Si Shiyue had made a hundred-year agreement with Qin Yu when Qin Yu was down and out and left Earth. A person like him would not bother to attack him when he was in his weakest state.

But this time, Si Shiyue seemed could not wait to kill him. This change was like he had become a different person.

“We can only rely on ourselves to find the answer. Perhaps the fog before us will become less dense when we become a little stronger…”

Yan Ruoxue said softly, concluding with the information Immortal Emperor Yao had revealed.

A tremendous change had already occurred in this heaven and earth, be it the war between the races or the cage of heaven and earth.

In short, it was definitely not a good thing for the human race, Qin Yu, and the others.

“Alright, at least for now, I’m very satisfied because you’re by my side.”

Qin Yu suddenly hugged Yan Ruoxue and gently held her beautiful face.

Ever since he returned to the Holy Region, he had not been alone with Yan Ruoxue for such a long time. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At this moment, the atmosphere seemed to have changed. Yan Ruoxue’s face turned red as if she had sensed a tremendous change.

Qin Yu kissed her bright red lips deeply and whispered to Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue, let’s get married when the dean and Flower Granny return!”

Yan Ruoxue blushed tremendously. She buried her little head deeply in Qin Yu’s chest.

As if sensing the atmosphere between the two, the starry sky in the Sumeru World became exceptionally bright.

In the subsequent few days, while Ji Yue was preparing to leave for purgatory, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue had been cultivating.

During their Dao discussion, Qin Yu discovered that Yan Ruoxue’s strength had reached a terrifying level.

Although she was only cultivating a single main way, this kind of comprehension of spatial rules was so profound that it shocked Qin Yu.

What shocked Qin Yu more was that after Yan Ruoxue felt the threat, she had already begun to gather her power to avoid triggering the cage.

No wonder she could create his own way in the Sumeru World.

“We need to pay attention to the qi of the cage now. It seems that the power of the origin has reached its limit. We need to find a way to advance like Si Shiyue and the others without triggering the backlash of the Path of Heaven. The subsequent cultivation will be even more dangerous. Whether it’s a treasure, cultivation technique, or anything else, we must try to find a way to improve them all.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

He Teng’s strength was far above theirs.

XiaoSheng and Xiao Hai were also on par with Si Shiyue. How did they avoid the surveillance of the Cage of the Path of Heaven?

There was a big gap between Yan Ruoxue’s current strength and He Teng’s.

If the two were to fight, Yan Ruoxue would have almost no chance of survival.

Now that she felt a sense of danger. Did this mean she was on the wrong path or the right path?

It was not until five days later that Ji Yue finished preparing everything.

There were all kinds of magical artifacts, spiritual stones, various healing pills, spiritual energy replenishment pills, and soul recovery pills.

Once the war involved so many people, these things would not be on one person.

Instead, it had to be distributed by levels. Therefore, even if the person who held the resources died, it would not affect the overall situation.

“Qin Yu, Ruoxue, the higher-ups of the alien race can’t make a move at this stage. Now that the human race has begun to attack, if the conflict between the human race and the alien race is unavoidable, this is the best time to weaken the alien race. However, we must also note that according to Revered Qi’s information, the higher-ups such as Ksitigarbha, Immortal Crane, Xiang Yu, and the eight-winged army definitely can’t make a move. However, the others might avoid the power of the Divine Annihilation Formation or only suffer light injuries. Thus, we cannot take things lightly on this trip to purgatory.”

Ji Yue instructed with a solemn expression.

“Understood, Sister Ji Yue!”

Both Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue nodded.

“Qin Yu, this is the best opportunity to take back the Xuanyuan Sword of the Jee family’s ancestor. Therefore, you must seize this opportunity. This is my bloodline’s blood essence.”

“And…” Ji Yue hesitated for a moment.

She took out a small mirror and placed it in Qin Yu’s hand. “There’s also the Nine Luminaries Mirror that my father passed down. My great-grandfather said this mirror could represent the power of the nine stars in the sky. The wielder can observe the trajectory of the stars through the Nine Luminaries Mirror, predict the changes in the weather, and use the power of the stars to enhance their combat ability. However, we have never felt this power. We may have lost the power over time.

“These two things should be able to prove your relationship with me if you encounter danger in the mystic realm. Qin Yu, bring out the Xuanyuan Sword! And my mirror, the only thing my father left to me.”

Ji Yue said softly.

“Sister Ji Yue…”

Qin Yu suddenly choked. He actually could not understand.

Why was Ji Yue so good to him when they had met by chance? She was really thinking for him selflessly as an elder sister.

“Young Brother, you don’t have to be so touched. There will be people in this world who will hate you for no reason, and there will also be people who will treat you well selflessly. Just do everything from the bottom of your heart. If I, Ji Yue, think you can do it, I will always trust you.”
