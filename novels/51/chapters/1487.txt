Chapter 1488: Chapter 1,488, absolute dance vs the Northern Lands 1

Just as absolute dance had said, Qin Yu also felt a trace of killing intent.

It was unknown whether this killing intent was coming for Qin Yu or absolute dance.

Qin Yu immediately stood up and said in a deep voice, “Let’s go out and take a look.”

Absolute Dance Glared at Qin Yu and said, “Sit down obediently and do what you need to do. It has nothing to do with you.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “How could it have nothing to do with me? Maybe they are coming for me.”

Jue Wu sneered and said, “Since they dare to come to my Hua Ning Mountain, I’m afraid they are fully prepared. You Won’t be of much help even if you go.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu became even more worried.

“No, I have to go with you. I can feel that there’s more than one person,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“No need. If I can’t even protect Mount Hua Ning, there’s no need for me to stay here.”Jue Wu sneered.

Then, she glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You stay here obediently. If you dare to disobey me, don’t come to Mount Hua Ning in the future.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.

Jue Wu didn’t say anything more and left in big strides.

Around Mount Hua Ning, more than ten people were rushing over.

All of them were dressed in black and had strong internal Qi.

Soon, these ten people landed on Mount Hua Ning. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“What are you doing here in the middle of the night?”Jue Wu put her hands on her waist and said coldly.

The leader was Yong Ji. He took a step forward and said indifferently, “Jue Wu, if you are willing to hand over Qin Yu, we will leave immediately. We Won’t disturb you.”

“Internal Qi! You came to my Hua Ning Mountain to ask for her? I think you are tired of living!”Jue Wu flew into a rage. An extremely terrifying aura erupted from her body!

Everyone could not help but be shocked when they felt this aura.

Even Yong Ji’s expression did not look too good.

“This crazy woman seems to be stronger than I imagined,”Yong Ji thought to himself.

“I can use this opportunity to get rid of her. Otherwise, I will definitely become a big trouble!”

Therefore, Yong Ji took a step forward and said coldly, “In that case, you are planning to protect this Qin Yu to the death.”

“Yes or no, it has nothing to do with you. Get lost right now. I might spare your lives, but it will be too late later,”Jue Wu said with a dark face.

Yong ji laughed out loud, “Alright, everyone says that southern state’s Jue Wu’s strength is outstanding. Today, I, the northern land, will have a taste of it!”

With that, Yong Ji took a step back.

He waved his hand, and the ten or so people instantly rushed towards Jue Wu!

“Bang!”

No one knew who it was, but someone raised a hand and slapped Jue Wu’s chest, forcing her to retreat dozens of meters away.

Her thin and small body fell into the rubble, and for a moment, she fell into silence.

“HM? Is it over?”Everyone couldn’t help but frown.

However, in the next second, the rubble instantly exploded and turned into ashes!

An extremely terrifying internal Qi fluctuation erupted from the rubble!

Then, they saw Jue Wu leap up from the rubble. Her pupils dilated, and her entire body trembled.

What was even more terrifying was that her internal Qi was rapidly increasing!

“I’m going to slaughter all of you and drink all of you!”Absolute Dance’s eyes slowly turned scarlet red.

At this moment, her hair also began to change. Her originally long black hair had turned scarlet red!

Blue veins popped up in her eyes. At a glance, absolute dance seemed to have turned from a little elf into a demon!

“What the Hell Is This?”Yong Ji could not help but frown.

Although he had known absolute dance for many years, he had never seen her in such a state!

“Weng!”

At this moment, absolute dance waved her small hand, and a scarlet light instantly enveloped Mount Hua Ning!

This sealed off their escape route! To prevent anyone from escaping!

For a moment, everyone was a little afraid. They subconsciously looked at Yong Ji.

Yong ji said coldly, “What are you afraid of? It’s just a bluff. Attack and kill her!”

“Swish!”

At this moment, Jue Wu instantly appeared in front of someone!

That icy coldness shocked everyone!

Before he could react, Jue Wu’s small hand had already slapped over!

This hand carried a scarlet radiance as it directly slapped her head!

“Kacha”a crisp sound rang out, and his head exploded on the spot!

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions could not help but change greatly!

One had to know that these people were all elite soldiers and valiant generals of the northern lands, yet they had been instantly killed by absolute dance with a single move!

“Oh no, the information is wrong,”someone in the crowd whispered to himself.

“Go to hell!”

Absolute dance went mad. Her long hair danced about in the wind like a demon, and then she launched an indiscriminate attack.

Her small hands kept clapping forward. One palm, two palms, three palms... ! In the blink of an eye, she had already struck out hundreds of palms!

Countless streams of spiritual power mixed with essence energy slapped toward the crowd.

For a moment, the entire Hua Ning mountain suffered as if it had experienced an earthquake!

Such a terrifying spell made everyone tremble in fear.

They dodged absolute dance’s attack in a panic. They couldn’t even free their hands to counterattack.

Absolute dance didn’t seem to have lost any energy as she continuously struck out palm after palm!

What was even more shocking was that her spell didn’t target anyone at all. Instead, she struck out randomly as if she wanted to kill everyone!

“Bang!”

Finally, someone wasn’t able to dodge and was struck by a palm. A mouthful of blood spurted out from his mouth!

“We can’t continue like this, or we’ll definitely be killed by her!”Someone shouted loudly.

Then, he raised his hand and conjured a spell. A beam of light shot towards Jue Wu.

However, Jue Wu was not afraid at all. She stretched out her hand and crushed the beam of light!

“Whoosh!”

Perhaps this action had angered Jue Wu, but her small body shot towards her at an extremely fast speed!

“Not good!”

The faces of the people from the northern lands changed. A snow-white protective armor burst out from their bodies!

However, Jue Wu closed her eyes and rammed wildly, using her head to crash into the Northlanders’Intruder!

“Crack!”

The protective armor didn’t even last half a second before it was shattered by Jue Wu!

Her body passed through the intruder’s body and turned his chest into the shape of Jue Wu!

Before he could react, Jue Wu turned around again and rode on his neck. Her small hands grabbed his head and forcefully pulled it off!

A pungent smell of blood filled the air, making everyone tremble in fear!

Everyone could not help but feel fear. Even Yong Ji’s expression was extremely unsightly.

“This madman...”Yong Ji gritted his teeth.

He had never thought that this would be a one-sided massacre.

He did not know whether it was because the people of the northern lands were too weak or absolute dance was too strong.

“Looks like the people sent by the northern lands are all a bunch of cowards.”Yong Ji took a deep breath.

He suddenly understood something.

These people were just followers. It was obvious that the north wanted Yong Ji to kill Jue Wu himself!
