Chapter 685: Perverted Woman Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Two internal Qi at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm were rushing toward Qin Yu’s direction.

Such terrifying internal Qi couldn’t help but cause people’s expressions to change.

Up until now, Qin Yu had never encountered a cultivator at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm. Qin Yu didn’t know anything about their strength.

The mustache man on the formation platform could also clearly sense the approach of these two internal Qi.

“Qin Yu, no matter what, don’t let anyone disturb me,” The mustache man said with a serious expression.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and nodded. “Don’t worry. I’ll stop them. You have to hurry.”

The mustache man nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Qin Yu looked in the direction of the two internal Qi and quietly waited for their arrival.

The two internal Qi were getting closer and closer. One kilometer, five hundred meters, one hundred meters.

Soon, they appeared in Qin Yu’s field of vision.

A man and a woman were standing in front of Qin Yu.

The man was eight feet tall and looked incredibly strong.

The woman’s figure was extremely graceful. Her twisting snake-like waist could not help but make people fantasize.

Qin Yu looked at the two people coldly and said, “Who are you? Are you people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? Or are you people sent by some aristocratic family?”

When the woman heard this, a charming smile couldn’t help but appear on her face.

“Little boy, we are not from an aristocratic family,” The woman covered her mouth and smiled coquettishly.

Qin Yu coldly said, “Then who exactly are you people!”

“You killed two of our members, and you still dare to ask who we are?” The man said coldly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu frowned and said, “People from the Han Palace?”

“That’s right, how dare you!” The man said coldly.

“Hey, don’t scare him,” The woman said with a smile.

Qin Yu’s face turned solemn.

Where did this Han Palace come from? They were actually able to send out two peak-stage martial marquis just like that?

“Kid, hand over the mask and I’ll leave your corpse intact.” The man’s tone was cold, and the pressure from his body was released.

Qin Yu instantly felt his shoulders as heavy as a mountain.

“Little boy, looking at your delicate skin and flesh, I can’t bear to kill you. Why don’t you hand over the mask and spend a night with me? I’ll plead on your behalf. How about it?” The woman licked her lips and said.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold, and he didn’t say a word.

The strength of these two people was definitely stronger than he had imagined.

“Don’t even think about taking away the mask. It’s best if you don’t even think about it.” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Ha!” The man couldn’t help but sneer.

“Qin Yu, you talk big. Do you really think you’re invincible?”

“Little boy, hurry up and hand over the mask. Otherwise, you’ll have to suffer.” A hint of coquettishness flashed in the woman’s eyes.

Without a word, Qin Yu’s internal Qi increased rapidly.

Rays of golden light surrounded Qin Yu’s body, lighting up the surroundings.

“Enough, he is obviously not interested in you.” The man could not help but sneer when he saw the situation.

A hint of regret flashed in the woman’s eyes. She sighed slightly and said with a regretful expression, “Then I can only kill you...”

Before she finished her sentence, the woman’s eyes burst out with a gaze that was like a poisonous snake.

In the next second, her figure flashed explosively and instantly appeared in front of Qin Yu. A sharp palm struck towards Qin Yu’s chest.

Qin Yu shouted loudly and immediately clenched his fist to meet it.

“Boom!”

A loud sound spread out. The collision of their bodies forced the woman back a few steps. Her palm was red.

“What a tough body,” The man said with narrowed eyes.

Meanwhile, the woman blew at her palm in a delicate manner and said pitifully, “Little boy, you hurt me. How do you think I should punish you?”

“F*ck you!” Qin Yu shouted and rushed over with the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist in his hand!

“Swoosh!”

The woman knew that her physical body was no match for Qin Yu, so she didn’t choose to take him head-on. Instead, she relied on her agile body to dodge.

She stood not far away and said pitifully, “You don’t know how to cherish a beautiful woman. You’re not a good child.”

Qin Yu’s face was slightly unsightly.

This woman’s speed was too fast. In the blink of an eye, she had retreated hundreds of meters.

Such speed really made him feel troubled.

“Stop playing. The mission is more important,” The man next to her reminded.

The woman sighed and said with a delayed expression, “I really can’t bear to kill you just like that... but I don’t have a choice. You won’t blame me, right?”

As she spoke, rays of icy blue cold light burst out from the woman’s body.

An icy cold chill instantly spread out!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He immediately activated the power of the Divine Dragon and looked at her warily.

“Whoosh!”

The woman’s body moved slightly, and the icy blue internal Qi on her body shot towards Qin Yu explosively.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He hurriedly used Shrinking Earth into an Inch and retreated backward.

However, this cold light seemed to have formed a divine sense as it followed closely behind Qin Yu.

The woman was not in a hurry. She just looked at Qin Yu with a playful look in her eyes.

“Stop fooling around!” The man could not help but shout.

The woman stuck out her tongue and muttered softly, “I know...”

As soon as she finished speaking, the woman raised her palm and pressed down gently.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt a thick force pressing down on his body.

“Boom!”

This huge force directly slammed Qin Yu into the ground.

Following that, the woman’s palm gently moved, and a huge force instantly appeared out of thin air.

Qin Yu felt as if his four limbs were about to be torn apart, and the pain was unbearable.

“Crash!”

The cold light that followed closely behind Qin Yu also erupted at this moment, directly piercing into Qin Yu’s various acupoints and pressing him to the ground.

That familiar feeling surfaced once again. Qin Yu’s internal Qi seemed to have been sealed and was unable to move at all.

The woman slowly walked toward Qin Yu as if she was on a catwalk.

Standing in a higher position, she exposed her two slender and beautiful legs under her short skirt.

The woman bent down and gently patted Qin Yu’s face. She sighed and said, “Why are you asking for trouble?”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He tried to struggle, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all.

“As expected of someone at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm...”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

This woman obviously hadn’t used her full strength yet. Compared to the late stage of the Martial Marquis realm, the peak of the Martial Marquis realm was obviously much stronger.

The woman put her hand on Qin Yu’s body and stroked down along his face.

“Yes...these strong muscles...” The woman seemed to enjoy it.

Qin Yu’s face was cold. He quietly manipulated his internal Qi in an attempt to break through the acupoints.

“Don’t waste your energy. It’s useless,” The woman said with a smile.

Qin Yu secretly thought that something was wrong.

This woman’s technique was obviously much better than the two black-robed men from before.

“Spend a night with me. If you make me feel comfortable, I’ll spare your life. What do you think?” The woman placed her face next to Qin Yu’s ear and blew her internal Qi onto Qin Yu’s face.
