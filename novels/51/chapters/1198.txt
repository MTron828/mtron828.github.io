Chapter 1199: Chapter 1,199, I’d rather die than surrender! 

He Teng was already prepared to head to the holy region, so he wasn’t afraid of Ye Qing at all. He even wanted to kill ye Qing before he left!

Ye Qing’s expression was ice-cold. Although he had already wasted his cultivation, he couldn’t just sit around and wait for death.

His entire body emitted an intense radiance. Rays of blue light that belonged to him emitted from his body.

He Teng narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Put up a stubborn resistance. Today, I’ll let you know what it means to be abandoned by the Times!”

After saying that, he teng suddenly clenched his fist and threw it at Ye Qing!

Ye Qing naturally would not be negligent and similarly clenched his fist to receive it!

“Dong!”

An earth-shattering sound shook the war chariot behind him and instantly sent it flying!

A resplendent radiance rapidly spread out in all directions with the two of them as the center!

Internal Qi exploded, and he teng took a few steps back. The light lingering on his fist was shattered!

He Teng couldn’t help but be shocked.

He lowered his head to look at his fist and said in surprise, “As expected of the number one genius of that year. Even if his cultivation was wasted, he could still burst out with such terrifying battle strength...”

Ye Qing looked at he teng coldly. This punch was quite strenuous for him, and it could even be said that this was his limit.

But even so, it only forced he teng back a few steps. It wasn’t able to hurt him in the slightest.

This wasn’t good news for ye Qing.

“Let’s attack together and get rid of him as soon as possible to prevent any changes.”At this moment, a mighty figure said in a cold voice.

One after another, mighty figures walked out. Their bodies were all emitting a terrifying aura. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He Teng alone was enough to give ye Qing a headache. In addition to the many mighty figures, he had no chance of winning at all.

He Teng didn’t try to be brave. He nodded slightly and said, “En, get rid of him as soon as possible to prevent any changes.”

Ye Qing’s face revealed a trace of seriousness. He couldn’t afford to delay for too long. The Sky Blood Rainbow’s spell was about to be completed.

“Ha!”

Ye Qing let out an angry roar. His clothes were instantly shattered, revealing his strong muscles!

Rays of light that were like dragons lingered on his body. This spell was ye Qing’s famous spell, the nine dragons divine art!

It was said that this spell was created by ye Qing himself by combining a hundred spells. Even Jiang he from back then was defeated by this spell in one move!

Of course, at that time, the two of them had only sparred with each other. If Jiang he had used the battle formula, Ye Qing had almost no chance of winning.

Looking at the technique that ye Qing had used, a hint of surprise flashed across everyone’s faces.

“This little kid isn’t simple,”an elder said darkly.

“Why don’t you join my sect? We’ll bring you to the Holy Region and train you well. You’ll definitely become a powerful fighter.”

Ye Qing was a person with a strong sense of justice. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have challenged the various aristocratic families of Jingdu back then.

He sneered and said, “Joining forces with you shameless people? I feel that it’s beneath your dignity.”

“Yellow-mouthed child, what arrogant words.”A mighty figure sneered.

He suddenly raised his hand and slapped towards ye Qing!

The mighty figure could form seals with just a raise of his hand! What was even more terrifying was that their control over spatial spells was far superior to that of a martial saint!

That dark yellow palm print shuttled through the void and arrived at ye Qing’s body in the blink of an eye!

“Clang!”

A terrifying sound exploded. That dark yellow palm was like a puddle of yellow mud that covered ye Qing’s body!

Meanwhile, Ye Qing circulated the nine dragons divine dragon. Several lifelike divine dragons circled around his body. As if they had their own consciousness, they easily dissolved this palm strike.

“Ha!”

Following that, Ye Qing let out an explosive shout as he suddenly clenched his fist and swung it out.

The nine dragons divine art followed suit, and a total of nine Golden Divine Dragons roared into the sky as ye Qing’s fist exploded out!

This punch was like a rainbow piercing through the sun, and also like golden colored glass pouring out, heading straight for that Almighty Expert!

“Hmph, overestimating yourself.”That almighty expert laughed coldly. He raised his palm, and with a light pinch, that piece of void actually directly distorted and deformed!

Ye Qing’s punch was easily dissolved.

“Get rid of him quickly,”he teng reminded.

“Don’t worry.”A powerful existence swiftly took action, directly sealing off the space where ye Qing was located.

“Void explosion technique!”That powerful existence roared. The space where ye Qing was located seemed to be filled with bombs as streams of resplendent light exploded!

Dust and smoke rose up in all directions. The void seemed to be about to collapse.

By the time the light dissipated, ye Qing’s body was already covered in wounds. His bones were exposed one by one, and traces of blood seeped out from the corners of his mouth.

“Oh? He actually didn’t die?”That almighty expert was slightly shocked.

Ye Qing didn’t have an abnormal physical body like Chang Mang or Qin Yu. For him to be able to achieve such a level with an ordinary body was truly shocking!

What was even more shocking was that ye Qing’s battle intent did not diminish in the slightest. His aura was like a vast ocean, churning endlessly!

“He really is a shocking ordinary person.”That mighty figure said with a faint smile.

Right at this moment, ye Qing let out an angry roar, directly shattering this spatial sealing technique.

He strode forward like a dragon and tiger, taking the initiative to charge towards that mighty figure!

“You don’t know whether you’re Dead or alive.”That mighty figure was also filled with killing intent. His expression turned cold as he raised both of his hands. Internal Qi rapidly gathered between his hands.

In the next second, pure spiritual power shot out from his palms. It was incomparably terrifying!

Even ye Qing’s nine dragons divine technique was insignificant at this moment. His body instantly shot backwards, and a huge bloody hole appeared on his left chest. That piece of bone had already been shattered!

Ye Qing’s internal Qi started to become a little dispirited, but he still stood up from the ground.

When he teng saw this, he couldn’t help but snort, “You and Qin Yu are really the same. No wonder the early Qin Yu was nicknamed Little Ye Qing...”

“With such talent, it’s such a pity to die like this. Why are you doing this?”A mighty figure said with a faint smile.

Ye Qing ignored the wounds on his body, as if he didn’t know pain.

He said coldly, “Since I’m sitting in this position, I have to bear the corresponding responsibility. Even if I die in battle today, I will not retreat even half a step!”

To fight alone against the world’s top people, it was admirable!
