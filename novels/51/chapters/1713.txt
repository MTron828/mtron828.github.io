“Brother Hu’s words make sense!”

“As long as we persuade a person at the reversion void stage to step into the northern lands, wouldn’t we be able to kill an Elementalist?”

“That’s right. Let’s Act Now and find a person at the reversion void stage immediately!”

While everyone was excited, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “This plan won’t work.”

When everyone heard this, they immediately looked at Qin Yu.

They sized up Qin Yu and said, “Why won’t it work?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Because he teng is still here.”

“He Teng? He’s only in the mighty realm. How can he be a match for someone in the reversion void stage?”Someone sneered.

“That’s right. Even if the strength of someone in the reversion void stage is suppressed, it’s not something he teng can deal with, right?”

Qin Yu looked at the crowd and said, “Could it be that you have forgotten about the battle between Xiao Sheng and Zhao Jing?”

“Of course we haven’t forgotten about that, but what right does he teng have to be mentioned in the same breath as Xiao Sheng?”

“That’s right. Xiao Sheng is the sect master of the Tianyun sect, a rare genius that appears once in a thousand years. Who does he teng think he is?”

After hearing everyone’s words, Qin Yu sighed and said, “He teng is not as simple as you think. His strength is definitely not to be underestimated.”

“Furthermore… he also has the white bone club in his hands. That is a holy weapon. Even though it has not been fully revived, its power is also unimaginable.”

Qin Yu’s words were not without reason. He Teng was once the number one genius of the central plains and his talent was not weak.

The white bone club in his hands was even more powerful.

If it was as simple as they thought, Qin Yu would have long made his move against that Snow Mountain.

However, how could they listen in? The group of people sneered at Qin Yu’s words.

“There’s no need to listen to him. What does he know?”

“That’s right. Just follow our original plan.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth. He wanted to stop them, but he knew that his face didn’t have any persuasive power, so he could only give up.

As for whether they could persuade a person at the reversion void stage, that was another story.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. Right now, he was at the critical stage of his breakthrough, so he left the northern border on the same day.

He rushed all the way back to Mount Dayue. After finding a suitable location, he began to try to break through.

Under the combination of yin and yang, Qin Yu seemed to have touched the border of the advanced stage of the Almighty.

Threads of internal Qi surged out from his body. Countless rays of light surrounded him, lingering around Qin Yu.

The golden threads surrounded Qin Yu’s body, as if they wanted to merge with Qin Yu as one.

This was an extremely terrifying change. It was a fusion with the Great Dao of Heaven and earth, and it was something that ordinary people could not handle.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s internal Qi began to churn multiple times, and his strength was also changing rapidly.

This change was even beyond Qin Yu’s imagination. The increase in his strength made people feel a trace of shock!

Soon, a thin layer of mist formed around him, enveloping Qin Yu within it.

No one knew how long this process would last, because this was the Dao of Heaven and earth. The process of merging with the Great Dao was extremely mysterious.

In the next few days, Qin Yu did not leave the great Yue mountain.

As usual, Wen Da and Wen Er drank and had fun all day long. They did not care about the matters of the South Province.

“Our grandfather and Qin Yu are both trying to break through. Is it not too good for us to drink every day?”Wen Da put down the wine flask and suddenly said.

Wen Er, who was rarely seen, did not agree with Wen Da. He quickly waved his hand and said, “Quickly restrain your thoughts. Cultivation is something that only laymen can do!”

“That’s true.”Wen Da nodded.

…

At the northern border.

With the efforts of countless cultivators, they really did ask for the help of a cultivator at the reversion void stage. Unfortunately, as Qin Yu predicted, he teng killed him at the foot of the snow mountain.

This news had already spread, and everyone at the northern border was instantly furious.

“Damn it, he actually failed!”

“That son of a B * Tch, he teng, really has some ability!”

“Sigh, what a pity for another warrior to die just like that.”

Although they felt regretful, they did not have the slightest intention of dispelling this thought.

“No matter, just wait for me to invite another one. The current he teng must be heavily injured. As long as another reversion void stage warrior appears, he will definitely die!”

This thought was instantly approved by most people.

Thus, they began the second round.

…

In the northern lands, under the Snowy Mountains.

He Teng, who had just killed a reversion void stage cultivator, looked quite satisfied.

Not only did he rely on the white bone staff to kill that reversion void stage cultivator, he even devoured his spiritual qi.

Drops of fresh blood were left on the white bone staff.

The fresh blood fell on the snowy ground, dyeing the white snow bright red.

He Teng then put away the white bone staff and planned to leave.

“Where do you plan to go?”

At this moment, a cold voice came from the snow mountain.

He Teng was stunned. He quickly turned around and said, “Master, I plan to walk around.”

“Walk around?”The Elementalist’s voice was extremely cold. “Do you plan to walk around or do you want some inheritance?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The moment he said this, he TENG’s expression changed drastically.

“Lord, I have no such intention. I am loyal to you!”He Teng did not say anything else and knelt down on the ground with a thud.

At this moment, he teng suddenly felt a sharp pain in his head!

Such a sharp pain caused he teng to instantly collapse to the ground and break out in cold sweat!

His body was constantly curled up and the sweat on his forehead formed layers of frost on his face.

He Teng endured the pain and said in a trembling voice, “Master… Why Are You…”

The elementalist said coldly, “Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking. I’m warning you, I can kill you at any time.”

“I… I have no other intentions…”he teng said with difficulty.

The elementalist snorted coldly, and the intense pain in He Teng’s head began to slowly disappear.

This was the mark that the elementalist had planted in their bodies. Not only could this mark resist the suppression of the northern lands, it would also be controlled by the elementalist.

He Teng collapsed on the ground. He looked a little weaker.

Even so, he teng endured the pain and knelt in front of the snow mountain.

“You can stay here,”the elementalist said coldly.

He teng replied extremely respectfully, “Yes.”

Although his attitude was respectful, his heart was already extremely cold.

…

In the blink of an eye, five days had passed.

Five days later, Qin Yu finally stepped into the late-stage of the Almighty Realm.

The Great Dao of Heaven and earth surged into Qin Yu’s body and glabella, completely fusing with Qin Yu. At this moment, his strength had also greatly increased!

“The late stage of the mighty figure and the middle stage of the mighty figure are actually so far apart.”Qin Yu lightly clenched his fist, and he could feel the boundless spiritual power within his body!

Most importantly, this was the fusion with the Great Dao, and his entire body felt incomparably transparent.

Just as Qin Yu was still sighing with emotion, a strange phenomenon suddenly condensed in the sky of the Great Yue Mountain!

Seeing this strange phenomenon, Qin Yu was immediately shocked, because this strange phenomenon was exactly the strange phenomenon of stepping into the reversion void stage!
