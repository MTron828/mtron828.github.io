Chapter 655: The Martial Saint’s Attack! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s entire back was almost rotten, and even his bones were exposed.

His internal organs were all greatly impacted, and he lay on the ground in extreme pain.

“Wah!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out from Qin Yu’s mouth. Intense pain spread throughout his entire body.

This was the power of a Martial Saint Weapon! Just a casual attack had broken through all of Qin Yu’s defenses!

“Hmph, let’s see how you can run now!” Qu Xie said coldly.

He withdrew the Prajna ruler and strode toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and forced himself to stand up again.

Then, Qin Yu exerted all of his internal qi to shrink the ground into an inch and run away!

Qu Xie’s face turned cold, and he shouted angrily, “You can still stand up! Your body is beyond imagination!”

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and sneered, “Even if you don’t die, you are still seriously injured. Let’s see where you can run to!”

Then, Qu Xie looked at the black-gold robes and shouted, “Go and catch him for me!”

Those few in black-gold robes were also heavily injured, but naturally, they did not dare to disobey Qu Xie’s orders. They could only get up and chase after Qin Yu.

Qu Xie looked at Yan Ruoxue. The reason why he did not chase after Qin Yu personally was that he was afraid someone would take the opportunity to take away Yan Ruoxue.

On the other side, Qin Yu was desperately trying to escape.

The Martial Saint’s attack had caused him great injuries. Blood kept spurting out of his mouth.

Even so, Qin Yu still did not dare to stop. Once he was captured, he would die without a doubt.

Fortunately, those few in black-gold robes were also heavily injured. Their speed was not fast, and they were far inferior to Qin Yu.

After more than ten minutes, Qin Yu had completely disappeared.

The few of them stood where they were and frowned, “He got away. What should we do now?”

“What else can we do? We were already injured, how could we catch up?”

“Let’s go back and report.”

The few of them looked at each other and returned to the martial arts academy.

“President Qu, we didn’t manage to catch him,” They said as they walked forward.

Qu Xie’s expression changed. He could not help but fly into a rage. “You bunch of trash! He was hit by a Martial Saint’s attack and was heavily injured. How can you not catch up?!”

“President Qu, our bodies are also heavily injured,” The few of them said in a low voice.

Qu Xie gritted his teeth and said, “Trash, trash!”

The black-gold-robed men stood there silently, allowing Qu Xie to continue cursing at them.

The faces of the young masters from the other aristocratic families were gloomy. Among them, the one in the worst mood was naturally Yan Jinyao.

“That black-robed man... is actually Qin Yu!” Yan Jinyao clenched his teeth.

He, the number one young master, had actually been surpassed unknowingly!

“I thought that black-robed man was an old monster who had cultivated for several years. I didn’t expect it to be Qin Yu.” Zhuang Teng sighed from the side.

“To cultivate to such a realm in less than two years, it’s really... terrifying.” Chu Heng also nodded slightly.

“I’m afraid that we, the so-called young masters of aristocratic families, will be completely suppressed by this Qin Yu.”

Yan Jinyao coldly glanced at everyone. He didn’t say anything and turned around to leave.

“What’s there to be arrogant about? I, Kong Yun, will definitely surpass that Qin Yu!” Kong Yun shouted loudly.

After that, he also turned around and left.

The young masters of the various families left the scene one after another. Soon, there were only three people left: Yao Meng, Chu Hedao, and Xiao Yuan.

“I really didn’t expect that the black-robed man who caused the Jingdu Martial Arts Association a great deal of trouble was actually Brother Qin,” Xiao Yuan said with a smile. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Yeah, I didn’t expect it either.” Yao Meng’s beautiful eyes were also somewhat surprised.

Chu Hedao, who was at the side, said, “I think the strength of the two of you should not be below Qin Yu’s.”

Once these words were said, the two of them shook their heads slightly and said, “Brother Chu, you think too highly of us. Even Yan Jinyao might not be his match, let alone the two of us.”

Chu Hedao said indifferently, “I think the two of you might have already surpassed Yan Jinyao’s strength.”

After saying this, Chu Hedao also left this place.

...

Qin Yu ran all the way back to his own private room.

His internal qi was rather listless. Waves of piercing pain came from every part of his body, and there were even bones that were shattered in his body.

With Qin Yu’s current state, even a Martial Grandmaster would be able to kill him so fighting against the marquis was out of the question.

“As expected of a Martial Saint Weapon...” Qin Yu was extremely weak as he spat out another mouthful of blood.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and tried his best to recover from his injuries.

However, his injuries this time were too severe. It was impossible for him to recover in a short period of time. It would take at least half a month.

However, half a month was too much of a luxury for Qin Yu. He had too many things to do and could not afford to waste half a month.

Qin Yu leaned against the wall and struggled to support his body.

He took out the two male corpses and examined them carefully.

As expected, the two male corpses were intact.

“The people accompanying the two men are so terrifying. I really don’t know how powerful the masked woman is...” Qin Yu could not help but think to himself.

Then, Qin Yu put away the two male corpses and began to treat his wounds.

...

After only half a day, the news had already spread throughout Jingdu.

The news that Qin Yu was the black-robed man shocked everyone.

“That Qin Yu is actually this powerful?”

“I originally thought that he was Qin Yu’s master, but I didn’t expect it to be him...”

“It seems that we have all underestimated Qin Yu’s talent. If this child doesn’t die, his future cultivation will probably be far beyond our imagination!”

“If he doesn’t die, he will definitely have good fortune! There will be a good show to watch. I’m afraid the various aristocratic families are starting to get anxious, right?”

The higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association held a meeting for this.

“No matter what, we must get rid of this Qin Yu, even if we have to use all means!” The higher-ups gave Xie Qu an ultimatum.

At the same time, the higher-ups gave Xie Qu permission to use the purple robe!

As long as they could get rid of Qin Yu, everything was worth it.

...

The sky gradually darkened. Qin Yu was hiding in his private room and felt a chill.

The injuries on his body made him look extremely weak. He couldn’t even resist the cold wind.

Qin Yu opened his eyes with great difficulty. He forced himself to stand up and was ready to leave.

“Tsk tsk, your injuries are so severe. If we don’t have you treated quickly, you will die.”

At this moment, a familiar voice was heard.

Raising his head, he saw a figure squatting in the corner of the wall.

This person was none other than the man with the mustache!

Qin Yu hurriedly looked at the man with the mustache and asked anxiously, “Have you prepared everything?”
