Chapter 1322: Chapter 1322, the reckless AH SAN 

Ah San led Wan ‘er and headed towards the mountain range.

Qin Yu did not waste any time and followed closely behind.

This mountain range was extremely vast, and the entire Yang City was beneath it.

Qin Yu used the desolate God’s eye to investigate, but he could not see anything in the mountain range, nor could he see the so-called demonic qi.

Therefore, Qin Yu deduced that there should not be any danger at the edge of the mountain range.

As expected, ah San was very careful along the way. He did not dare to relax at all.

However, after walking for a long time, they still did not see the so-called demonic aura. There was not even the slightest abnormality.

Other than whether it was a tree that had appeared, there was nothing else.

“Damn it, that old man must be spouting nonsense,”AH San said with a cold face.

Wan ‘er, however, still said vigilantly, “Old Mr. Chen has no need to deceive us.”

“That’s not necessarily true. Maybe he just found an excuse to scare us,”AH SAN said with a cold snort.

Qin Yu ignored him. He took the initiative to walk to the front of the group and walked toward the depths of the mountain range.

After the three of them walked for half a day, the legendary “Demonic qi”finally slowly appeared.

The surroundings first turned gray, as if everyone was surrounded by smoke.

As they went deeper, the smoke became thicker.

“Miss Wan ‘er, hold on to my hand!”Ah San hurriedly said.

He held Wan ‘er tightly, as a trace of fear appeared in his heart.

Although AH San had a strange temper, he was completely devoted to Wan ‘er, willing to die for her.

Qin Yu did not dare to think too much about it. He immediately activated the desolate divine eye and looked around warily.

The smoke became thicker and the heaviness in Chen Cang’s mouth began to show.

“My chest... is so uncomfortable.”Wan ‘er was the first to be unable to bear it. She clutched her chest as if it was difficult for her to breathe.

Ah San followed closely behind, but he did not say anything.

Even Qin Yu began to feel a little uncomfortable.

This kind of aura was different from the dark energy. Although the spiritual power in the internal Qi would be suppressed, it did not have that bone-chilling feeling.

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, a clear sound suddenly swept through the smoke and dust. A green light flashed in front of everyone, and before they could see it clearly, it had already disappeared without a trace.

Looking at Wan ‘er again, there was already a conspicuous mark left on her chest.

“Miss Wan ‘er, are you alright?”Ah San immediately panicked.

Qin Yu quickly walked in front of Wan ‘er and said in a low voice, “Stand behind me.”

AH SAN said stubbornly, “I don’t need you! I can protect Wan ‘er well!”

After saying that, he pulled out his long sword and said coldly, “If that monster dares to appear again, I will definitely kill him!”

Qin Yu glanced at Ah San and shook his head. “Your vision is obstructed here. It’s better if you don’t try to be brave.”

“Cut the crap!”How could ah San listen to him.

He gripped his long sword tightly and looked around vigilantly.

The three of them walked deeper and deeper. At this moment, ah San could clearly feel that the spiritual power in his body had been completely suppressed.

He was in the mighty realm. Even if his spiritual power was suppressed, his physical body was also extremely powerful. Therefore, ah San still had some illusions in his heart.

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and gently caressed these thick and heavy internal Qi.

He was surprised to discover that these internal Qi were clearly very thick and heavy, yet they were as fine as gauze. He simply could not catch them.

“What exactly is this internal Qi? Demonic Qi? There has never been such a record in history,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

This was definitely not demonic qi. It was probably a mysterious internal Qi that the people of Yang City had never come into contact with before.

“Hum”

At this moment, a green light suddenly appeared in front of them.

The moment the light appeared, ah San quickly grabbed his sword and blocked Wan ‘er behind him.

However, what surprised him was that this time, the green mysterious creature did not flash by. Instead, it just stood there quietly.

No one could see their faces clearly. They could only see their huge bodies and the strange green light they emitted.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He used the desolate God’s eye to look at the green creature in front of him.

Under the desolate God’s eye, nothing could be hidden. Even this mysterious internal Qi could not block Qin Yu’s vision.

He saw three figures. They were green in color. Although they were in human form, they had horns that were different from humans.

Their bodies were uneven. Their eyes were deep in their heads and were the size of green beans.

It was this pair of eyes that was extremely eye-piercing.

There was no special internal Qi on their bodies. Instead, they were extremely calm, like the water of a lake, making it difficult for people to discover them.

“What... What is this thing?”Qin Yu could not help but turn pale with fright.

This thing looked extremely terrifying, even more terrifying than a baleful ghost!

The others could not see the appearance of this creature at all, especially Ah San. He grabbed his long sword and shouted angrily, “Come, watch me cut you with one sword!”

With that, he grabbed his sword and took the initiative to charge towards the creature. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Yu’s expression changed and he hurriedly shouted, “No, come back quickly!”

However, ah San could not listen to him. He had already charged towards those people. The long sword in his hand danced wildly as he charged towards the strange creature!
