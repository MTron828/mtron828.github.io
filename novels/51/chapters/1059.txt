Chapter 1060: Chapter 1,060, the second attack 

Qin Yu took out the soul bell from his body and handed it to Luo Jingyu.

“I know this thing can resist, but I don’t want to use it,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Luo Jingyu took the soul bell, and a trace of excitement flashed in his eyes.

“Divine weapon, it’s really a divine weapon. I’ve lived for so many years, but I’ve never seen such a complete divine weapon!”Luo Jingyu’s hand holding the soul bell trembled slightly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Other than this item, what else do I have on Me?”

Luo Jingyu finally came back to his senses. He sized up Qin Yu and then pointed at Qin Yu’s right pocket.

“It’s in there,”Luo Jingyu said.

Qin Yu was puzzled and reached into the right pocket.

A moment later, Qin Yu took out the token that Yan Ruoxue had sent from the pocket.

It was a jade pendant with a dense internal QI surrounding it. It had an extraordinary aura.

“Yes, that’s it,”Luo Jingyu said.

“This thing can resist the five-petal Lotus?”Qin Yu’s eyes were full of doubt. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Luo Jingyu took the token and slowly rubbed it with his palm.

“The material of this thing is not inferior to the five-petal lotus. It’s even better than it. It’s a pity that this thing only grinds the raw material into a jade pendant. It Can’t be called a magic artifact,”Luo Jingyu said.

“If you are willing, I can help you to re-forge this object.”

Qin Yu snatched the jade pendant and hurriedly shook his head, “No, absolutely not!”

This was a token sent by Yan Ruoxue, and it was also the support of Qin Yu’s belief.

Moreover, Yan Ruoxue had said that the jade pendant could be crushed at a critical moment.

“Then I have no choice,”Luo Jingyu shook his head and said.

“You can try to activate the soul bell to resist the five-petal Lotus.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and said regretfully, “Even you can’t do anything?”

“As long as the materials are scarce, the materials we have are far inferior to the five-petal lotus,”Luo Jingyu said.

Qin Yu put away the soul bell. These materials came from the first secret realm, so naturally, they couldn’t be compared to the ones in this world.

“If it really can’t be done, I can only activate the soul bell.”Qin Yu put away the soul bell and sighed slightly.

Then, he said goodbye to Luo Jingyu and left.

After returning, Qin Yu quickly made a plan.

He found immortal crane and said in a deep voice, “I plan to attack the second secret realm again, but this time, you will lead the team.”

“Eh?”Immortal Crane’s long and narrow eyes were filled with surprise.

Qin Yu said, “You will attack the second mystic realm. I will find an opportunity to find Zhai Xing and think of a way to persuade him.”

“He is the key to this battle. Besides Gu Zizhen, he is the number one person. He knows the second mystic realm very well.”

Immortal Crane raised his eyebrows and said jokingly, “Call Me Big Brother, and I will agree to it.”

“... Big Brother.”Qin Yu was somewhat unwilling.

Immortal Crane laughed out loud. It patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Okay, Big Brother will agree to it.”

“That five-petal lotus is not simple. You have to be careful,”Qin Yu warned.

Immortal Crane nodded slightly and did not say anything.

Time could not be wasted, so Qin Yu did not waste it.

That night, he suddenly led people into the second mystic realm!

The group led by the Immortal Crane stepped into the second mystic realm one after another and launched the second round of attacks.

Gu Zi’s reaction was really fast. He immediately rushed out with his spiritual artifact, and the many martial artists in the second Mystic Realm also quickly stood up to fight.

“It’s up to you.”Qin Yu looked at the immortal crane and said.

After saying this, Qin Yu took advantage of the chaos and rushed to Zhai Xing’s residence.

Zhai Xing was seriously injured. He didn’t have any fighting ability, so he could only stand by the window and look at the sky from afar. His face was full of worry.

At this moment, the door opened and Qin Yu stepped in.

Seeing Qin Yu who suddenly came close, Zhai Xing’s face changed greatly. he shouted angrily, “Qin Yu, why are you here? !”

Qin Yu looked at Zhai Xing coldly and said, “I’m here to give you one last chance.”

“Give me a Chance?”Zhai Xing’s expression turned cold.

Qin Yu said coldly, “That Gu Zizhen won’t be able to hold on for long. His failure is fated!”

“Hahaha! Qin Yu, can you deal with five-petaled Lotus? !”Zhai Xing laughed coldly.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Do you really think that I can’t deal with five-petaled Lotus? I just can’t bear to let too many innocent people die in this battle!”

“Don’t you know that the person I want to Kill is Gu Zizhen and has nothing to do with the others in the second secret realm? !”

“Do you think that just because you’re blindly loyal to Gu Zizhen, you know what’s good for you? !”

Zhai Xing’s face was gloomy as he said coldly, “Cut the crap. Don’t try to convince me with just a few words.”

“Convince you?”Qin Yu’s face was cold.

He grabbed Zhai Xing and pressed him against the window, pointing at the battle outside, he said, “Can’t you see how many innocent people have died in this battle? “These people call you Lord Zhai Xing and regard you as their senior and role model. What about you? “Do you have the heart to watch them die here?”

“Zhai Xing, let me tell you. I’m not here to beg you. I’m just giving you a chance to atone for your sins!”

“If I really have the intention to kill, all of these people will die. Do you have a conscience to live with? !”

These few words made Zhai Xing’s expression turn somewhat ugly.

These few days, Qin Yu had investigated Zhai Xing and discovered that this person did not have any weaknesses.

He did not have any family, friends, or loved ones, so he was not afraid of anything.

However, as long as it was a person, they would definitely have weaknesses.

For example, Qin Yu’s weakness was Yan Ruoxue, and Zhai Xing’s weakness was his softhearted heart.

Seeing that Zhai Xing did not speak for a long time, qin yu sneered, “If I’m not wrong, Gu Zizhen doesn’t believe you anymore, right?”

“So What?”Zhai Xing said with a sullen face.

“So What? Do you want to let so many innocent people die for a person you don’t believe in?”Qin Yu questioned coldly.

“I...”Zhai Xing was instantly speechless.

At this time, he seemed to have reacted and said coldly, “I was almost tricked by you. Weren’t you the one who started this war? You are the main culprit!”

“I started it? hahaha!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he heard that.

“Zhai Xing, use your brain and think about it. It was Gu Zizhen who wanted to kill me first! He sent people to kill me many times! Don’t tell me I should let him kill me!”

Zhai Xing was still unconvinced. He said coldly, “Gu Zizhen only killed you.”

“The only person I want to kill is him, Gu Zizhen!”Qin Yu said coldly.

Zhai Xing did not say anything, but his heart had already begun to waver.

“Zhai Xing, I’ve said it. I’m giving you a chance, not for myself,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Let me tell you. I must win this battle. No one can stop me. As far as I’m concerned, if they die, they die.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu flicked his palm, and the soul bell fell into his hand.

“Watch carefully. If I really wanted to end this battle quickly, you guys would have lost long ago!”Qin Yu grabbed the soul bell and said coldly.
