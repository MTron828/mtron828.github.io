Chapter 822: Noblemen VS Second Mystic Realm

The flames of both sides rose rapidly. Finally, Qin Yu’s fist was the first to be clenched, and a golden light instantly erupted!

As a half-step Martial Saint, Gu Xinghe naturally grasped this detail. He immediately raised his palm to meet it!

“Boom!”

The explosive sound instantly spread throughout the entire Jingdu Martial Arts Association, as if a great earthquake had occurred!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!!”

Gu Xinghe took three consecutive steps back before he stabilized his body!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s internal qi didn’t decrease in the slightest. It was so thick that it sent chills down people’s spines!

Hiss!

When the surrounding people saw this, they couldn’t help but gasp!

Gu Xinghe had actually lost?!

Although it was only a simple collision, it was still able to compare the difference in strength between the two!

Gu Xinghe’s expression was even more unsightly. He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said with narrowed eyes, “He does have some ability, but so what?!”

Just as Gu Xinghe was about to continue fighting, the three elders beside him stopped Gu Xinghe.

One of the elders whispered into Gu Xinghe’s ear, “Young Master Gu, this person has the power of a Martial Saint. Don’t fight him. Don’t forget your father’s warning.”

“That’s right. Moreover, this is the important place of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. If we fight here, we will destroy this place.”

Gu Xinghe frowned slightly. Although he was unwilling, he still gave up.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Kid, you’d better return Yan Ruoxue. Otherwise, you will bear the consequences!”

Qin Yu laughed coldly. “Gu Xinghe, it is a pleasant surprise that you can come.”

Gu Xinghe didn’t understand what Qin Yu meant, but he didn’t think too much about it.

Gu Xinghe no longer paid attention to Qin Yu. He looked at Xia Hang and said, “Alright, everyone, leave this place.”

Xia Hang frowned and said, “Young Master Gu, I’ve already promised them. If I go back on my words now, wouldn’t that be breaking my promise?”

Gu Xinghe said impatiently, “Do what I tell you to do.”

Xia Hang didn’t give up. He continued, “Young Master Gu, think carefully. These people are the heirs of the top families in Jingdu. If they are unhappy, it won’t be good for you.”

This was the truth. Since this was the current society, they had to obey the rules of this society.

Even if you came from the second Mystic Realm, it wasn’t enough.

If he really enraged them, the second Mystic Realm could still be eradicated.

Gu Xinghe looked at Xia Hang coldly and said, “Xia Hang, are you trying to scare me?”

Xia Hang decided to go all out and continued, “This is also what Mr. Zhou wants to see. I think your father has to give Mr. Zhou face too, right?”

Gu Xinghe said somewhat irritably, “Xia Hang! Do what I tell you to do. You can’t go against orders!”

Xia Hang’s expression also turned cold.

He put away the smile on his face and said coldly, “Young Master Gu, I’m not responsible for answering to you. I’m only responsible for answering to the higher-ups.”

“Before the higher-ups give the order for you to take over Granny Qin’s position, I’m the one in charge here!”

“Please leave immediately!”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe immediately flew into a rage!

He pointed at Xia Hang and said, “Are you crazy? How dare you talk to me like that? Do you believe that I’ll immediately remove you from your position!”

“It’s up to you! But that will have to wait until you officially take office.” Xia Hang said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

“Well then!” Gu Xinghe was so angry that he laughed instead.

It was his first time coming to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association today, and he had already taken a beating. How could Gu Xinghe not be angry?

“Xia Hang, we’ll see about that!” After Gu Xinghe said this, he turned around and left.

After he left, Xia Hang’s face revealed a trace of worry.

“Sigh, this is going to be troublesome,” Xia Hang whispered.

He swept his gaze across the crowd, cupped his fists and said, “Everyone, hurry up and go in. I’m afraid I won’t be the president for much longer.”

“President Xia, don’t worry, we won’t let you lose this position,” At this moment, someone stood up and said.

“The Chu family will definitely do our best to protect you.”

“The Kong family will do the same.”

“The Zhuang family will do the same.”

For a moment, everyone stood on Xia Hang’s side.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

Xia Hang was quite shrewd.

He was originally on the same side as all the capitalists, so his connection with the martial arts world was relatively weak.

Now that he was once again standing by the side of all the major families, it was actually a good thing for him.

Capital versus the peak of martial arts. It was hard to say who was the weaker one.

After that, Xia Hang took out the token again.

He placed the token on the door, and the door immediately opened slowly.

Following a buzz, waves of extremely peaceful and sacred internal qi were emitted.

“It’s rumored that this place is a land of extreme Yang and isn’t affected by evil,” someone said.

“Mm, it’s said that if you want to enter the Scripture Pavilion, you have to have a heart of kindness. If you’ve killed too many people, you will be rejected.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He raised his foot and stepped into the Scripture Pavilion.

At that moment, Qin Yu’s heart suddenly felt as if it was pierced by a needle.

Not only that, but Qin Yu also felt that his body was under a myriad of resistance! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This caused Qin Yu’s expression to change.

He swept his gaze across the crowd and realized that only he had such a reaction.

“Could it be that what they said about killing is true?” Qin Yu frowned.

During this period of time, Qin Yu had indeed killed too many people.

Moreover, the killing intent inside him was getting heavier and heavier!

“As expected of the Scripture Pavilion,” Qin Yu thought inside.

He forcefully endured this resistance and tried his best to appear calm.

After they stepped into the Scripture Pavilion, the first thing that came into view was a towering tower.

The entire Scripture Pavilion had a total of four levels, and books were placed on each level.

Some of these books had been added in by later generations, and there were also ancient books that had been accumulated for many years.

Two huge calligraphy and paintings hung in the middle, looking extremely sacred.

“Sigh, this is the first time in my life that I’ve been humiliated like this,” Zhuang Teng couldn’t help but say angrily.

“Yeah, so what if he comes from the Mystic Realm? I really don’t know where he gets his sense of superiority from.”

“From his attitude, he doesn’t even take us seriously. As if he’s superior to us?”

“Fortunately, Brother Qin took action and helped us vent our anger,” Chu Heng said with a smile.

“Brother Qin, you’ve won glory for us!”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I didn’t win glory for you.”

“Moreover, when you guys interacted with others, haven’t you always acted superior?”

“It’s also a good thing to let you guys get a taste of it.”

After saying this, Qin Yu took the lead and walked forward, leaving everyone looking at each other.

Just as Qin Yu said, they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth and stood at the top. How would they know what it was like to be looked down upon, like those who lived at the bottom?
