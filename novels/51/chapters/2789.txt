“This lousy paper has such a terrifying origin. No wonder my Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze directly shattered when I saw the demonized Investiture of the God!”

Qin Yu touched the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze on his forehead with lingering fear.

His Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze seemed to be continuously damaged by a force that could not be repaired with holy energy until now.

“F*ck, doesn’t that mean it’s invincible? Isn’t this the ultimate goal that many people pursue?”

Chang Mang was shocked.

“Idiot, it’s not that simple. The Investiture of Gods was rumored to be a conspiracy. Daozu gave the Investiture of the God for a reason. At that time, the Jie Sect taught everyone regardless of their race. There were living beings of all races. Some of them were as talented as top-notch gods and demons. Even Daozu was afraid of them.”

Fatty Situ said proudly as if he was deliberately showing off. He told everyone the details he knew.

“First, one must have their physical body destroyed before their divine soul can be on the Investiture of Gods. However, most of the immortals were in the human world at that time. They were unrestrained. Compared to being driven

“First, one must have their physical body destroyed before their divine soul can be on the Investiture of Gods. However, most of the immortals were in the human world at that time. They were unrestrained. Compared to being driven by the Heavenly Court, they definitely tended to be free. The Investiture of Gods was actually a shackle. While it locked the immortals’ freedom, it also sealed part of their divine powers, making them impossible to break through in their lives. They can only be controlled for the rest of their lives.”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked. Such things only existed in legends.

However, it seemed like this was a real story from Fatty Situ’s words.

“Moreover, this is a good guess. The bad guess is even more shocking. Among the 365 names in the Investiture of the God, 80% were from the Jie Sect. However, according to the records, the descendants of these people didn’t get any response no matter how many times they called out to the seniors who became gods. Moreover, a Primordial Chaos mighty realm cultivator was heavily injured in the battle. He used his remaining lifespan to cast a forbidden technique. Nevertheless, he still could not get in touch with the ancestor who had entered the Investiture of the God.”

Fatty Situ chuckled.

“Was their divine sense wiped out and they became something like Creepy?”

One had to know that in the Primordial Chaos, each person in the three major sects was extremely famous.

At the very least, their power was equivalent to the current Holy Lords. However, an Investiture of Gods had made so many people join. One could imagine how many talented people this Investiture of Gods had destroyed if what Fatty Situ said was true.

“From the current information, this thing isn’t anything good anyway. It’s also surprising to encounter this damaged Investiture of Gods here. No wonder my father informed me so urgently for the first time.”

Fatty Situ looked with interest at the place where the endless faint radiance was emitting. That was the endless internal qi emitted by the incomplete Investiture of Gods.

“If this thing is so strange, then why are you here? If this turns you into something that’s neither human nor a ghost, you’ll regret it!”

Chang Mang felt his scalp tingle as he looked at the dense mass of Creepy. “Longevity is definitely not bad, but it’s a disaster if it’s like these Creepy.” Qin Yu also shook his head silently.

“We don’t know the specific use of this thing yet. Don’t you think that this is also a sinister magical artifact? Once the enemy’s divine soul is sucked in, not only can it erase his original consciousness, but it can also control him. These Creepy were also parasitizing on this incomplete Investiture of Gods to grow to this extent.”

Fatty Situ stared at the Creepy that filled the mountains and plains. His face revealed a surprised expression.

Even the magical artifact on his body could not detect the first few of Creepy’s strengths from their internal qi.

While they were discussing, everyone heard the rumbling sound of a huge millstone spinning.

The frequency of this sound was extremely high. Qin Yu felt an extremely heavy object rubbing out in space in just a few seconds.

The sound pierced through his entire ear. Blood slowly flowed from his ear.

The Investiture of Gods was out!

Fatty Situ’s voice was trembling.

He was also a little nervous to see such a heaven-defying item.

At this moment, the space at the bottom of the Nine Nether Cliff was like a sticky ball that could expand and contract.

The space began to expand and squirm violently. The proportions of the figures at the bottom of the cliff became very strange to Qin Yu and the others.

“What a terrifying power! It can distort space. Is this the power of the Investiture of Gods?”

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked.

His skin was wrinkled like an old man’s at this moment. The terrifying pressure on his body almost suffocated him.

Fortunately, they had retreated 10,000 meters away. Otherwise, this pressure would have directly turned them into meat pies when it erupted.

Thump!

Thump!

Thump!

The entire space where the Investiture of Gods was located was shrinking violently like a heart.

Countless black balls suddenly appeared in space with a loud boom.

These black balls floated quietly as if they had always been there.

Qin Yu felt his hair stand on end following the appearance of this black ball.

A feeling of death instantly enveloped him.

It was as if he was facing the most terrifying fierce beast at this time at close range.

Fatty Situ’s expression changed drastically. The Heavenly Umbrella in his hand suddenly opened up and enveloped the four of them.

Qin Yu and the others felt they had been enveloped in a new space. The order here held up the entire Heavenly Umbrella, protecting them.

The Heavenly Umbrella shook violently.

“Endless Energy Tribulation? What the he*l is that? Why do I feel like I’ll die if I touch that thing?”

Chang Mang’s voice trembled.

“That’s a heavenly tribulation that only the Great Immortal of the Primordial Chaos will encounter. According to the current level, it’s a heavenly tribulation from the seventh stage to the Immortal Emperor. Do you think you’ll die if you touch it?”

Fatty kicked Chang Mang angrily. “How dare you!”

Chang Mang was enraged.

“I’m your boss!”

Three to four sparkling magic swords appeared behind Fatty. Chang Mang was like a rooster that had been strangled, unable to utter a single word.

“This should be a castrated version of the Energy Tribulation. Otherwise, even the Heavenly Umbrella could not withstand it easily. However, this thing isn’t something we can deal with. It’s better to run away a little more. We don’t want to die.”

Rumor had it that the Energy Tribulation originated from the will of the world. It was a world-ending calamity that was caused by the disappointment of the world and its desire to rebuild it. As the number of life forms continued to increase through reproduction, all kinds of living beings would compete for resources and cosmic energy. This could lead to an imbalance in energy. When this imbalance reached a certain level, it would trigger a tribulation.

Fatty Situ wiped the cold sweat on his temples. He held the umbrella tightly as if he were trying to sense if the tribulation outside had stopped..
