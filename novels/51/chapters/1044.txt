Chapter 1045: Chapter 1,045, the strange crane 

The demon city was like a pure land.

It stood in a desolate place, yet it was extremely prosperous.

Qin Yu rushed towards the demon city on foot. The surrounding environment caused Qin Yu’s internal Qi to slowly dissipate.

By the time he arrived at the demon city, his internal Qi was almost exhausted.

Qin Yu stood at the gate of the demon city and realized that the gate of the demon city was tightly shut. It was obviously different from the last time he was here.

This could not help but make Qin Yu feel that things were not looking good.

The gate was tightly shut and a formation had been set up...

Could something have happened to the demon city?

Qin Yu did not dare to think too much. He hurriedly knocked on the door.

Not long after, the gate slowly opened.

Two people walked out from within.

He sized up Qin Yu and said coldly, “Who allowed you to come close?”

Qin Yu quickly explained, “I’m friends with Immortal Crane. Please tell him that Qin Yu is here to see him.”

“Friend? Why does Lord Immortal Crane have a human friend? !”The two people shouted.

Qin Yu explained helplessly, “I’m really his friend. If you don’t believe me, you can ask him.”

The two people looked at each other with a trace of doubt in their eyes.

“You stay here and watch him. I’ll go and inform Lord Xianhe,”one of them said.

After that, he turned around and walked towards the depths of the demon city.

Qin Yu looked at the other Demon Beast who was responsible for guarding the city and said with a smile, “Brother, why is the gate of the Demon City tightly shut? Is It...”

“Bang!”

Before Qin Yu could finish his words, the gate was fiercely shut.

“F * ck.”Qin Yu could not help but curse inwardly.

A dignified martial saint had actually received such treatment.

It seemed that this demon city’s disgust towards humans was truly worthy of its reputation.

A few minutes later, the door opened again.

Uncle Niu was standing at the door.

“Uncle Niu!”Qin Yu hurriedly walked forward and greeted him.

Uncle Niu laughed loudly and said, “Why did you suddenly come here?”

Qin Yu said with a lie, “I missed you guys. I came back to see you guys.”

“Hahaha, where’s that kid with the ghost head camphor?”Uncle Niu asked.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “He didn’t come.”

“Alright, let’s talk as we walk. Lord Immortal Crane is waiting for you,”uncle Niu said with a laugh.

“Okay!”

Qin Yu followed behind Uncle Niu and Strode into the demon city. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

On the way, Qin Yu said worriedly, “Uncle Niu, the demon city’s gates are tightly shut and a formation has been set up. Did Something Happen?”

Uncle Niu waved his hand and said, “No, it’s just that we became more cautious after you barged in rashly the last time.”

“I see.”Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

Soon, the two of them arrived near the grotto-heaven where the immortal crane lived.

“You can go in first. I’ll go prepare some food to welcome you!”Uncle Niu said.

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Thank you, Uncle Niu.”

After stepping into the grotto-heaven, they soon saw the immortal crane lying on the jade bed.

It had long hair and fair skin. Its slender fingers held the jade pot, making it look like a fairy.

“Immortal Crane!”Qin Yu waved at it and walked over quickly.

Immortal Crane slowly stood up. He sized up Qin Yu and said with some surprise, “You’ve become a martial saint?”

“I broke through by luck,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Immortal Crane stretched out its palm and a jug of bejewelled nectar suddenly appeared.

Qin Yu took the jug of wine and took a sip. Then, he said, “It’s really hard to find you here.”

Immortal Crane did not continue this topic. Instead, it stretched its back and said, “You must have something to tell me that you came to find me.”

Qin Yu’s old face turned red. He smiled embarrassedly and said, “No, I just missed you. I just came back to see you.”

“Oh? is that so? In that case, you can stay for a few more days. We can eat, drink, and have fun. Other than that, don’t mention anything else,”immortal crane said indifferently.

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately became anxious.

He hurriedly changed his words and said, “To tell you the truth, I really came to find you for something.”

The Immortal Crane snorted. It stood up barefooted and said indifferently, “Tell me. What is it?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he said, “I want you to help me with something. I want you to lead some people to attack the second mystic realm.”

Hearing this, the immortal crane snorted lightly.

“Do you think I will agree to it?”The Immortal Crane raised its eyebrows and stared at Qin Yu with its long and narrow eyes. There was a hint of playfulness and teasing in its eyes.

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, “I know it’s very difficult for you to agree to it...”

“Then don’t mention it.”The crane waved its hand and interrupted Qin Yu’s words.

“I have nectar, Jade Dew, and golden fine jade sashimi here. Don’t you feel comfortable staying here and having fun for the rest of your life? Why do you want to enter the mortal world and get involved in that groundless dispute?”

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “It’s not groundless dispute to me. The second mystic realm bullied me, humiliated me, and kidnapped my woman. If I don’t get rid of it, I won’t Be Happy!”

“But to me, it’s groundless,”said immortal crane indifferently.

Qin Yu instantly fell into silence.

That’s right. Immortal Crane was unwilling to enter the mortal world to begin with. It was indeed a little selfish to let him go to the second mystic realm for his sake.

“Okay, just pretend that I didn’t say anything. Let’s drink for a few days and talk about the past and the present!”Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Oh?”Immortal Crane raised his eyebrows again.

His soul-stirring gaze stared at Qin Yu, making Qin Yu feel extremely uncomfortable.

“If I don’t help, then what should you do?”Immortal Crane asked.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There are many ways. Take it slow.”

Immortal Crane didn’t say anything and just looked at Qin Yu quietly.

This gaze was like staring at a beautiful woman, making Qin Yu feel extremely uncomfortable.

“You... Are You a pervert?”Finally, Qin Yu couldn’t help it.
