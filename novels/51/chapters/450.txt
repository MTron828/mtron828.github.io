Chapter 451: So Tolerant? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Walking in the Meng family’s huge manor was like walking in a primeval forest.

Qin Yu looked at the villa in the center and said in a low voice, “That villa should be where Meng Wuxiong lives.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked straight to the villa.

The entire villa was built like a castle. It was no exaggeration to say that it was even more extravagant than the Yan family’s villa.

After he pushed open the five-meter-tall door, the first thing that came into his view was a long corridor.

At the end of this corridor, there was a chair made of gold and exuding a luxurious internal qi.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “He really is quite rich.”

Then, Qin Yu turned around the hall and came to another room.

Just as he pushed open the door, Qin Yu saw a shocking scene.

In this room, there was actually a Manchurian tiger!

A huge chain was locked around the Manchurian tiger’s neck, and the tiger’s body was covered in injuries. It was obvious that it had been beaten up.

The moment Qin Yu entered, the Manchurian tiger suddenly stood up and roared angrily at Qin Yu.

The roar was terrifying, but there wasn’t the slightest trace of panic on Qin Yu’s face.

After experiencing so much, Qin Yu realized that a mere animal wasn’t scary. What was scary was a thoughtful human. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He walked in front of the Manchurian tiger, raised his hand, and pressed it on the Manchurian tiger’s head.

The huge force instantly made the Manchurian tiger unable to move!

The murderous aura released by Qin Yu instantly made the Manchurian tiger turn into a kitten.

“Good boy.” Qin Yu patted its head and then slashed at the chain.

The chain broke, and the Manchurian tiger regained its freedom.

“Go back to your forest.” Qin Yu patted his head and said with a smile.

The Manchurian tiger seemed to understand Qin Yu’s words. It lowered its head at Qin Yu, then broke through the window and escaped.

...

Outside the door, Meng Wuxiong and the others had just returned.

When he saw the Manchurian tiger that had escaped, Meng Wuxiong’s expression couldn’t help but darken.

“Qin Yu actually let my pet go without permission!” Meng Wuxiong, his face full of anger, clenched his fists.

“You, go and capture the Manchurian tiger for me.” Meng Wuxiong pointed at an Inner Strength Grandmaster and said.

“Yes, Mr. Meng.” After the Inner Strength Grandmaster received the order, he hurriedly chased after him.

Meng Wuxiong took a deep breath and coldly said, “Mr. He said that we must delay him for three days. No matter what he does in these three days, we must satisfy him.”

“Yes.” The few of them hurriedly nodded.

Then, Meng Wuxiong walked into the villa.

After entering the hall, Meng Wuxiong saw Qin Yu drinking water by himself.

He was holding a beautiful woman in his arms.

“Mr. Qin, why are you here?” Meng Wuxiong suppressed the anger inside and quickly ran over to say.

Qin Yu glanced at Meng Wuxiong and said indifferently, “You should know why I’m here.”

“How could I know your intentions?” Meng Wuxiong said with a smile.

His attitude surprised Qin Yu.

Qin Yu pointed at Fang Yue and said, “Fang Yue has been unconscious for several days. Do you know how to wake her up?”

Meng Wuxiong scratched his head and said, “I really don’t know...”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at Meng Wuxiong coldly.

From the way he spoke, it didn’t seem like he was lying.

‘Looks like I’ll have to look for He Teng,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, He Teng was mysterious and unpredictable, so Qin Yu didn’t dare to act rashly.

This was also the reason why he came to Dongchuan first.

“Mr. Qin, you haven’t eaten yet, right?” Meng Wuxiong seemed to have thought of something.

He immediately turned around and berated, “Why aren’t you preparing the food?! Let Mr. Qin have a taste of our delicacies!”

When he saw Meng Wuxiong’s attitude, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “You’re this polite? This isn’t like you.”

“Gee, everything before was just a misunderstanding. It’s better to have one more friend than one more enemy,” Meng Wuxiong said while holding back his anger.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

He quietly sized up Meng Wuxiong and couldn’t help but sneer inside.

“I understand.” Qin Yu seemed to have guessed something.

He thought for a moment, then grabbed the cup in his hand and splashed it on Meng Wuxiong’s face.

The boiling hot water instantly splashed on Meng Wuxiong’s face.

A trace of anger flashed across Meng Wuxiong’s face!

But very quickly, he forcefully suppressed it.

“Hehe, Mr. Qin, why did you do that?” When Meng Wuxiong spoke, the corner of his mouth kept twitching. It was obvious that he was at his limit.

“As expected,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He narrowed his eyes and pondered for a moment. Suddenly, a slap landed on Meng Wuxiong’s face.

Although this slap wasn’t very strong, it was extremely insulting!

Meng Wuxiong’s body suddenly trembled. His expression was almost distorted.

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin, what are you doing?” Meng Wuxiong gritted his teeth and said these words.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “You can endure this? Then... how about this?!”

As soon as he said this, Qin Yu spat a mouthful of thick phlegm on Meng Wuxiong’s face.

“You!” Meng Wuxiong immediately clenched his fist! The murderous aura on his body suddenly exploded!

But soon, He Teng’s words came to Meng Wuxiong’s mind.

He gritted his teeth and reached out to wipe the thick phlegm off his face. He said in a trembling voice, “Mr. Qin, don’t go too far...”

“Too far?” Qin Yu slowly stood up.

He clenched his fist and punched Meng Wuxiong in the face!

Meng Wuxiong took a few steps back and fell to the ground.

His nose was broken by the punch and blood flowed out.

This completely infuriated Meng Wuxiong!

He stood up angrily and berated, “Qin Yu! Don’t think that I’m afraid of you!”

Qin Yu sneered. “You’re so tolerant. What are you trying to hide?”

Meng Wuxiong’s expression changed. He said with a cold expression, “What... What do you mean by hiding? I don’t understand what you’re talking about!”

Qin Yu didn’t continue to talk nonsense with Meng Wuxiong, he stood up and said indifferently, “With your talent, Meng Wuxiong, being able to reach the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm in this lifetime is a big step. And not only have you reached the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, but you’ve also nurtured so many Inner Strength Grandmasters...”

“Speak, what treasure does your family have? Hand it over, and I’ll spare your life.”

Meng Wuxiong’s expression instantly became extremely gloomy.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “I said I don’t understand.”

“You don’t understand? Then I’ll kill you.” Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed, and he immediately took large strides towards Meng Wuxiong!

Meng Wuxiong couldn’t hold it in any longer. He raised his head and roared angrily, “Qin Yu, you’re going too far! Do you really think that I, Meng Wuxiong, am a pushover? Go To h*ll!”

As he spoke, the muscles all over Meng Wuxiong’s body instantly swelled up and he threw a vicious punch!
