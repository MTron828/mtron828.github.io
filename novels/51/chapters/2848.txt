Chapter 2849: The Divine Embryo

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A dot of light rose in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

In an instant, the righteous qi extinguished the foreign world like a waterfall.

The power of righteous qi instantly eliminated the evil in the world.

This power was the seed of righteous qi left in Jiang Shengling’s body when he launched his last attack.

This power was the power of the ultimate evil.

The blood sword seemed to have met its nemesis and instantly became dispirited.

Bang!

Qin Yu stepped on the young man’s head.

The door to the foreign world closed and disappeared.

“I hate this sword intent.”

Qin Yu said lightly.

“You’re so strong. I’ll kill you one day.”

The young man revealed his handsome face, but the killing intent was almost tangible.

“Okay.”

Qin Yu said softly.

The young man’s face immediately revealed a trace of fear.

It made him feel a sense of fear of death. Even if he obtained the legacy of the Sword World, he would still die under this power.

“I need his power. Don’t kill him.”

The child came to Qin Yu’s side at some point. He tilted his head and stared at Qin Yu curiously.

“Alright, since it’s about going to the Heaven Burial Cave, I’ll spare your life first.”

Qin Yu kicked the young man away.

His goal was to go there and find Fatty Situ and Luo Xueyi. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“I really want to fight you and test your strength but I feel like I’ll die, so I’ll forget it,” said the child suddenly.

When the young man heard this, his face was filled with shock.

No one knew the child’s strength better than him, but Qin Yu had received such an evaluation.

His feeling just now was not wrong. If the child did not stop him, he would die here.

“My name is Divine Embryo You, a divine embryo from the Divine Realm.”

“Ling Kong.”

Although the young man was a little unwilling, he still spoke up.

“I’m Qin Yu. Do you know Lingxue?”

Qin Yu suddenly asked.

The powers of creation could already restore the source. Although their sword intent was very different, they seemed to be in the same vein.

“Shut up. Don’t mention them!”

A terrifying Spiritual Energy Sword suddenly slashed down. His eyes revealed a look of madness.

“Are you an idiot?”

Qin Yu kicked him away.

“Your peak power is terrifying. You can easily break through the Spiritual Energy Sword of the foreign world. Moreover, you seem to have just awakened your peak power. If you continue to grow, you are a dangerous person.”

Divine Embryo You suddenly said.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly. He did not respond to Divine Embryo You.

He was unable to see through the power of this little fellow. Although he had temporarily lowered his head to him, no one knew the exact details.

“Why are you going to the Heaven Burial Cave?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and asked.

“Everyone has their reasons to go there. My goal is to get the Absolute Beginning Life Stone and the God Source of the Heaven Burial Cave. The Absolute Beginning Life Stone can change a person and seize the fortune of heaven and earth, while the God Source can perfect my divine soul. As for the other people’s motives, you can ask them yourself. Anyway, one can travel with me as long as one’s strength reaches my expectations.”

Divine Embryo You said expressionlessly, making it impossible for others to determine the authenticity.

“Then what benefits do I get from joining your team? If there are no benefits, perhaps it would be safer for me to act on my own. I wouldn’t have to worry about the schemes between us.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“Since everyone is on the same team, there will be corresponding benefits. I can roughly calculate the time when the Power of the Ancients will erupt in the Heaven Burial Cave. Is this point enough? I landed in the Burial Heaven Cave when I descended from the Divine Realm to the Saint World. It was also because of these two divine items that I gave birth to my consciousness. I have a sufficient understanding of this place over the long years here.”

Divine Embryo You said indifferently.

A thought power landed in the air. The scene of the Burial Heaven Cave’s Power of the Ancients erupting was immediately displayed.

The power of time caused countless people to grow old and even turn into a pile of bones.

The Power of the Ancients that stripped off the realm shuttled through that mysterious region.

At this moment, these scenes reappeared in front of Qin Yu again.

This kind of immersive scene made Qin Yu sense the mystery and terror of this power. For a moment, he believed Divine Embryo You’s words a little.

However, he still felt a little uneasy. Perhaps there was something that Divine Embryo You hadn’t told him.

“Other than the three of us, is there anyone else?”

Qin Yu asked.

“There are two more, but they are already waiting for us there.”

Divine Embryo You revealed a strange smile.

“If you don’t have any questions, then we’ll be setting off. It seems like we won’t be able to find a better candidate.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Divine Embryo You stretched out his hands and his arms slowly flowed.

In a moment, Qin Yu only felt his vision blur.

He seemed to be wrapped in a drop of water, but he could vaguely see the scene outside the world.

That seemed to be a part of Divine Embryo You’s body.

Qin Yu was slightly surprised. It was the first time he had seen such a body.

“Don’t resist.”

In an instant, the world spun before his eyes.

The three of them shuttled through the world just like that.

They fused into the depths of the earth and became a part of this land.

When the people outside looked from afar, they only saw a flash of golden light.

After a while, they leaped into the sky from the underground and rode on the clouds.

This speed was even faster than the ancient ship from the Divine Realm.

Qin Yu sucked in a breath of cold air. Such a terrifying speed!

It seemed to contain Daoist techniques such as the Golden Ground and Fog Riding.

There was even a faint trace of the Five-Element Escape Technique and the River into Land that he had previously displayed.

What a terrifying body! He could faintly conform to the Great Dao just by relying on his body. There was no internal qi of peak power at all.

This was abit like an innate divine power, just like his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

However, it was unimaginably powerful. If this body fought, it would probably be a human-shaped weapon.

They advanced for nearly a month with this speed.

Divine Embryo You, who was in the middle, didn’t seem to be exhausted at all. He continued to move at lightning speed.

Suddenly, they stopped.

The water droplets wrapped around them slowly dispersed. Qin Yu and Ling Kong landed on the ground.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt an enormous pressure that was almost tangible.

In this area, the dark clouds were like ten-thousand-year-old ice. Even divine sense could not penetrate them.
