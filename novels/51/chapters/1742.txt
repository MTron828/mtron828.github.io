Chapter 1743: Another Battle with Yong Ji

Both Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu knew what kind of person Qin Yu was. He was someone who would never give up easily.

Even if the difference in strength between the two sides was huge, he would not retreat easily.

Hence, they did not say anything more and just looked at Yuan Xiu coldly.

Yuan Xiu had a mocking look on his face, as if he did not care about the people in front of him.

!!

“Master, leave Qin Yu to me.” At this moment, Yong Ji suddenly took a step forward and looked coldly in Qin Yu’s direction.

Yuan Xiu glanced at Yong Ji and said indifferently, “As you wish.”

Yong Ji looked in Qin Yu’s direction and said with squinted eyes, “Qin Yu, I’ve been wanting to kill you for a long time. I finally found the chance today.”

“Yong Ji, I don’t have the time to deal with you. Get lost.” however, Qin Yu did not even look at Yong Ji. He only stared coldly at Yuan Xiu.

This naturally made Yong Ji extremely furious!

He was a mighty Reversion Void Stage cultivator, but he was actually ignored!

“Qin Yu, you are not qualified to ask the Lord to make a move! I can kill you! Die!” Yong Ji shouted and attacked first, stepping on the wind!

Looking at Yong Ji, who was shooting toward him, Qin Yu had no choice but to meet the attack with his hand.

“Boom!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This was a collision of fists. Terrifying shock waves burst out from their fists and swept out!

The space collapsed. In front of these two people, the void seemed to become extremely fragile and could be torn apart at any time!

What was shocking was that Qin Yu was not at a disadvantage at all!

Yong Ji, who was in the Reversion Void Stage, did not gain any advantage at all!

“Get lost!”

“Die!” Qin Yu roared. A golden light flashed and forced Yong Ji to take a few steps back!

Everyone was greatly shocked by this scene!

One had to know that Qin Yu was only at the Peak of Mighty Realm Stage, and there was still a huge gap between him and the Reversion Void Stage!

“Is Qin Yu too strong or is this Yong Ji too weak…”

“It’s unreasonable. It’s too unreasonable. Ever since the great change in the world, it seems that everything can’t be measured with common sense…”

“First, there was Xiao Sheng and now there is Qin Yu. What’s going on with this world…”

Yong Ji’s expression was extremely ugly as he faced the crowd’s discussion.

“Qin Yu,” he gritted his teeth and yelled, “Your physical body has only reached the Reversion Void Stage. Otherwise, you’re not worth mentioning.”

“I told you to get lost!” Qin Yu roared, and his aura suddenly surged to the extreme!

His long hair rose into the sky, and a terrifying aura spread from his feet to the surroundings!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s golden light had reached its peak!

In the next second, Qin Yu’s feet stepped on the line word formula and instantly appeared in front of Yong Ji!

The golden light flashed in front of Yong Ji’s eyes, and a fist as hot as the sun came!

This punch was the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch. It was obvious that Qin Yu wanted to finish off Yong Ji as soon as possible!

Yong Ji did not dare to face the attack head-on. He hurriedly entered the void and hid.

The void was shattered by Qin Yu’s punch, revealing a dark hole, which looked extremely terrifying.

“You do have some ability.” Yuan Xiu was slightly surprised.

However, he quickly shook his head and said, “Unfortunately, your cultivation level is too low. You’re definitely not Yong Ji’s match.”

“Ah!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a brilliant light burst out and turned into a palm print, which slapped toward Qin Yu!

This Yong Ji had actually used his killing move with a raise of his hand!

For a moment, the entire space was sealed by his palm print, and there was no place to hide!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be slow, so he clenched his fist and met the attack.

“Boom!”

Although Qin Yu’s strength was obvious to all, his cultivation realm was really too low. In the face of the crazy Yong Ji, Qin Yu was still unable to bear it.

Although his terrifying body had withstood the palm print, his internal organs had suffered a great impact. He even spat out a mouthful of blood!

“You damn little bastard, you’ve repeatedly trampled my dignity to the ground!” Yong Ji’s hair was dancing in the wind as he looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He didn’t waste any time and rushed toward Yong Ji again!

“Is he planning to slay a god?” Someone commented in the dark.

To fight a Reversion Void Stage mighty figure at the Peak of Mighty Realm Cultivator could be described as a god slayer.

“Alright, it’s time for me to move my limbs.” Yuan Xiu raised his eyebrows and looked at Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu.

Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu did not dare to hide anything, because Yuan Xiu in front of them was terrifyingly powerful!

This Yuan Xiu was the key to this battle!

“Ah!”

Wen Wanchong raised his head and roared. His body suddenly emitted a red light, and even his pupils turned scarlet!

This was Wen Wanchong’s secret technique, the Eight Devil Transformation!

The fact that Yuan Xiu was able to activate this irrational secret technique was enough to prove how difficult it was to deal with him!

Qu Zhu did the same. He raised both his hands, using both strength and gentleness, planning to fight to the death.

However, Yuan Xiu in the distance had a mocking expression on his face. He did not take the two of them seriously at all.

“Whoosh!”

Just then, Wen Wanchong made the first move. He was like a wild beast, a terrifying aura surrounded him, and every punch he threw shook the space.

Qu Zhu’s hands controlled different forces, and the fusion of the two forces was even more terrifying.

However, Yuan Xiu did not seem to care. He clasped his hands behind his back and fought with one hand. His strong body sometimes disappeared into the void and sometimes appeared several stars away. He looked extremely elegant.

Seeing this, everyone’s expression became more and more solemn.

Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu represented the strongest combat power in Nanzhou. However, they were still far from being comparable to Yuan Xiu.

“This Yuan Xiu must have already reached the middle or even advanced stage of the Reversion Void Stage!”

“It’s definitely not the middle stage. If it was, Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu wouldn’t be in such a sorry state.”

“Is there no one who can stop him?”

He then looked at Qin Yu, who was fighting with Yong Ji. Although Qin Yu’s strength was extremely terrifying, the difference in their cultivation realms still made Qin Yu retreat in defeat.

“Boom!”

Yong Ji mumbled as he spat out a golden lotus that exploded beside Qin Yu. Qin Yu’s indestructible body was instantly smashed into a bloody mess!

With his hands behind his back, Yong Ji looked down at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “It’s useless. You’re too weak in front of me. You’re like an ant that I can kill at any time.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He activated his Meridian Circulation Technique and slowly restored his body.

“Damn it, the gap between me and the Reversion Void Stage is still too big.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

“I’ve let you escape so many times. This time, I don’t intend to give you any more chances.” at this moment, Yong Ji’s voice suddenly turned cold.

His hands were moving in the air as if he was about to use some kind of trump card.

“I’m going to kill you in one go!” Yong Ji shouted coldly. His hair was dancing wildly, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.
