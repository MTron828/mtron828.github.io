Chapter 1085: Chapter 1,085, the ashes of a mighty figure 

This layer of ash-like powder covered every inch of Yan Jinyao’s skin, as if adding a layer of armor to his level!

On top of that white powder, there was a familiar yet strange smell.

It seemed to be mixed with the aura of death and internal Qi.

Qin Yu stared at Yan Jinyao, whose body was completely white, and the interest in his eyes grew stronger.

“That layer of white ash shouldn’t belong to you, right?”Qin Yu said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Yan Jinyao glared angrily at Qin Yu and shouted, “Qin Yu, you’re Dead!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This layer of white ash was none other than the treasure bestowed by the Sky Blood Rainbow!

And this treasure was made from the bones of the skeleton army!

In other words, the current Yan Jinyao had a body that was no weaker than a mighty figure!

“Qin Yu, I must kill you!”Yan Jinyao roared angrily and charged towards Qin Yu!

He clenched his fists and pressed down on Qin Yu’s body. He actually planned to clash head-on with Qin Yu’s body!

When Qin Yu saw this, he couldn’t help but sneer, “I think you’re courting death!”

After saying that, Qin Yu clenched his fists and charged forward!

“Clang!”

A loud sound exploded, and an intense light wave erupted between the two!

At the moment of the collision, Qin Yu was directly pushed back dozens of meters!

This could not help but make Qin Yu’s eyes reveal a trace of surprise.

“Interesting.”Qin Yu climbed up from the ground.

He rubbed his fist, only to feel that his fist bones were numb.

“Hahaha! Qin Yu, didn’t you say that your physical body is unrivaled in the world? Today, let me, Yan Jinyao, experience it!”Yan Jinyao shouted excitedly.

After he finished speaking, he once again approached Qin Yu and threw a punch at him!

The second collision between the two once again forced Qin Yu back!

This time, the Golden Light on Qin Yu’s fist was directly shattered. On the other hand, Yan Jinyao was completely unharmed!

Qin Yu climbed up from the ground again. He looked at the cracks that appeared on his fist and his eyes couldn’t help but narrow slightly.

“What a tough body,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“What exactly is that layer of white ash?”

Yan Jinyao said with a cold smile, “It’s made from the bones of mighty figures! Qin Yu, so what if your physical body is strong? It’s nothing compared to a mighty figure!”

“The body of a mighty figure? No wonder.”Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

Such a tough body, it was likely that other than mighty figures, no other spell could do it.

“Go to hell!”

Yan Jinyao’s face was filled with madness as he charged towards Qin Yu.

He clashed head-on with Qin Yu’s body, and for a moment, loud bangs continuously rang out in the air.

It had to be said that the strength of a mighty figure’s body was beyond imagination. Even Qin Yu was knocked back repeatedly, and even his bones were showing signs of cracking.

“Go to hell!”

Yan Jinyao’s hand held a sharp light as he ruthlessly threw a punch over!

This punch had the power to open up mountains and open up seas. It instantly smashed Qin Yu into the ground!

A huge pit appeared in front of everyone. Yan Jinyao struck while the iron was hot. He roared and punched continuously at Qin Yu’s body!

Seeing this scene, everyone could not help but be shocked!

Yan Jinyao, who was beaten up by Qin Yu just now, actually exploded with such terrifying strength at this moment!

“Yan Jinyao is indeed not that simple!”

“I knew it. Since he is known as the number one disciple in the world, he naturally won’t be defeated like this!”

The reversal of the situation shocked the surrounding people.

These people were the standard fence-sitters. They were also watching to see who would win and decide who to follow.

In the blink of an eye, Yan Jinyao had already thrown out hundreds of punches. It seemed that Qin Yu had already lost the ability to resist.

In the crowd, Jiang he and Xu Huaigu could not help but frown slightly.

“Is Qin Yu going to lose to Yan Jinyao Today?”Xu Huaigu said in a low voice.

Jiang he waved his hand and said, “He won’t lose. Qin Yu still has many secret techniques that he hasn’t used yet.”

For example, the battle word formula! If Qin Yu had used the battle word formula, Yan Jinyao would have been defeated long ago!

“Go to hell!”

Yan Jinyao’s entire body erupted with a brilliant light. He gathered all his strength into his fist and smashed it fiercely at Qin Yu’s head!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu’s body suddenly erupted with an intense and dazzling golden light!

He suddenly raised his hand and grabbed Yan Jinyao’s fist!

“It’s my turn, right?”Qin Yu’s icy cold voice entered Yan Jinyao’s ears.

Yan Jinyao’s expression changed, and he suddenly felt a sense of unease!

The Golden Light on Qin Yu’s body slowly turned dark gold.

A terrifying internal Qi erupted from his body, instantly forcing Yan Jinyao back!

“Buzz!”

The dark golden light illuminated a large area of heaven and earth. Qin Yu’s body had entered a new level at this moment, becoming indestructible!

In the distance, Yan Jinyao frowned and did not dare to make a move for a moment.

Qin Yu got up from the ground. His body was emitting an extremely hot temperature. This temperature had completely evaporated his blood!

The heat wave that pounced on his face caused the surrounding temperature to rise!

“This is a newly developed spell. I haven’t named it yet.”Qin Yu shook his neck.

“This technique combines the saintly body technique and the vajra saintly body technique into one. It shouldn’t be inferior to a top-tier heaven-rank technique.”

The vajra saintly body technique was a heaven-rank technique to begin with. Now, after Qin Yu’s improvement, it had taken a step further!

“Speaking of which, I have yet to compete with a mighty figure in terms of physical body. Today can be considered an opportunity,”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and looked coldly at Yan Jinyao.

“Come, I’ll use you to test my new spell,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Jinyao’s pupils constricted and he shouted, “Arrogant! Today, I’ll break your inexplicable confidence!”

After saying that, Yan Jinyao stepped on the spell and closed in on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He slightly clenched his right fist and then fiercely punched forward!

“Clang!”

This was an unprecedented collision of physical bodies. The entire world seemed to be shaken by this sound.

In an instant, the mountains and rivers cracked and the Earth collapsed. The residual power that erupted from the two of them shattered everything in their sight into dust! Countless martial marquis were directly shaken into a bloody mist at this moment. Even the martial saints were affected and spat out fresh blood!
