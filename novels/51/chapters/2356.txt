2357 Purgatory Criminals and Holy Region Cultivators

These people were all beloved relatives and friends of the top-notch martial artists in purgatory the Holy Region used to control them. This sudden change made Yan Yunfan’s expression change drastically.

“Do you think you can save their lives by taking them away? All the people you saved will die in an instant.”

Yan Yunfan sneered at Xi Menn and the others.

“I can suppress their divine sense restrictions.”

Qin Yu said to Xi Menn and the others.

In the Sumeru ring, Qin Yu put everyone around the coffin.

After that, he circulated the coffin, and in an instant, the internal qi of the coffin suppressed the divine sense restrictions. Of course, these people could not help but faint.

This was the only thing he could do now. He would think of another way to remove this restriction.

Xi Menn stepped out without hesitation and came to Qin Yu’s side.

The other seven or eight people failed to react for a moment. When they saw Xi Menn walk over, they suddenly erupted with emotion.

“Don’t you f*cking kill my daughter! They all have the Holy Region’s divine sense restrictions on them. You can’t resolve it! Quickly release her!”

A person’s eyes were wide open and glaring as he roared madly at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, can you really suppress that divine sense restriction?”

Mei Li stared intensely at Qin Yu. She had once seen a soul-cultivating cultivator who had reached the half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage die tragically in an instant after the restriction was detonated.

Other than Xi Menn, the others stared at Qin Yu with struggling expressions.

“Well, well, well! You truly live up to your reputation, Qin Yu. You can turn the Holy Region upside down, and such a scheme is not simple. In a situation where you will surely die, you still want to bring a few people to keep you company. Unfortunately, you will die here no matter what you do today.”

Yan Yunfan laughed loudly. He suddenly pointed at the people from the purgatory.

“Even if these trashes help you, you will also die! I, Yan Yunfan, said this.”

Yan Yunfan was originally Heaven’s proud son, but after Yan Ruoxue appeared out of nowhere, his status and resources were taken away significantly. He also did not have a favorable impression of Qin Yu, who was close to Yan Ruoxue.

He stared coldly at the few purgatory criminals. “I’ll only give you ten seconds. If you still don’t make a move, I’ll trigger the restriction immediately.”

Qin Yu stared at Mei Li and Chang Ye. As he could not let people leave the coffin at this moment, he could not prove anything.

These people were their closest kin that they would not part with for hundreds or even thousands of years. Otherwise, they would not have been summoned by the Holy Region. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In the end, only Mei Li and Chang Ye walked over.

“I believe you!”

Mei Li said softly, her eyes no longer showing any hesitation. She had seen too many incredibilities in Qin Yu.

“I only felt that Xi Menn’s choice shouldn’t be wrong. Qin Yu, if you deceive me, even if I have to go all out, I’ll make sure we die together.”

The two knew Qin Yu. In the end, the other purgatory cultivators did not come over as they dared not take the risk.

“Qin Yu, quickly release our close relatives!”

“Don’t act not knowing what’s good for you. Are you f*cking dragging our family members along to die with you?”

Several people became anxious, demanding Qin Yu to hand over the people he had just taken away.

“B*stard, come at me if you have the ability!”

“Idiot, if you have the guts, come out and fight one-on-one. What kind of man are you betting on the lives of our close relatives?”

Some people started cursing.

“Shut up! Do you think only the Holy Region’s beasts can kill your close relatives, and I can’t? If you dare to utter foul things again, I’ll kill them immediately.”

Qin Yu was furious. He had tried to persuade them nicely, but since that was the case, he did not hold back anymore.

Others were allowed to threaten, but not him?

Those people were instantly frightened and dared not utter a sound.

He suddenly had an idea. “You have no choice now. Listen to me, and your family members may have a chance to live. If you don’t, I’ll kill them immediately.”

If the people from purgatory did not make a move, it would significantly reduce the pressure on him.

Hearing his words, the faces of those few people instantly turned pale.

Their people were now in Qin Yu’s hands. Therefore, no matter what, they could not attack him anymore.

“Yan Yunfan, trigger the restriction and see if you can kill anyone.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

Moreover, he could clearly feel that the spiritual soul restrictions of those people seemed to be suppressed by something, and he could no longer communicate with the token to detonate the restrictions.

However, he did not show it. He did not want to push these people from purgatory to Qin Yu’s side.

Even if they excluded the people from purgatory now, their strength would still be much greater than Qin Yu’s.

In an instant, the battle began again.

Qin Yu, Xi Menn, Jue Wu, Chang Ye, Mei Li, Elder Guai, and the others resisted the attacks of the Holy Region one after another.

Each attack from both sides was a clash of extreme power.

And here, only Xi Menn and Jue Wu could resist. Qin Yu had to share the pressure of the others.

In an instant, another seven or eight of his holy bones broke.

Heaven’s Son Teng Zixu’s every attack was full of shocking power. Moreover, he was relaxed and did not need to rest at all.

His cultivation realm had been far above everyone else. Under this kind of impact, the pressure on Qin Yu increased significantly.

This level of clash caused the entire Azure Ridge Continent to sink a few thousand meters in less than several tens of minutes.

The terrifying fluctuations even affected the surrounding continents.

Xi Menn collapsed onto the ground with a pale face. He was a person who had reached the pinnacle of the sword.

It had been their best to be able to hold on until now. The other people with lower cultivation were even worse off. They had almost exhausted their spiritual power.

Even though Qin Yu had cultivated the half-step Glazed Sacred Body, he still felt tremendously tired at this moment.

The people of the Holy Region all had powerful magical artifacts in their hands. Most of these magic artifacts were tribulation divine artifacts. They did not have such a partner at all.

Seventy percent of his bones had broken. It had reached the limit of what he could do.

The Sumeru World descended again, and a destructive black fire burned in the world, blocking this attack again.

He wanted to bring everyone through using the Sumeru ring but realized that a magical artifact had long sealed this place.

That space was like steel, and it was impossible to break through.

“Qin Yu, don’t even think about escaping. The Yun family’s supreme treasure, the Heaven-sealing Orb, has already sealed this place. Even a housefly can’t fly out.”

Yan Yunfan stared at Qin Yu in the air with a hint of mockery in his eyes.
