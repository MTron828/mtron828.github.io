Chapter 2035: Stepping into the Chaos Grave

Suddenly, the atmosphere in the entire area of the Chaos Grave became even more oppressive.

All the cultivators felt a powerful strange phenomenon. They held their breaths and focused on the center of the Chaos Grave.

During the opening process of the Chaos Grave, it was like beams of dazzling light emerging from the underground and gathering at the center of the Chaos Grave from all directions.

As the light grew brighter, the ground began to churn as if an invisible force was on the point of stirring up trouble.

!!

Everyone couldn’t help but hold their breaths as they stared at this strange scene.

In the center of the Chaos Grave, the originally scattered stone tablets began to rise into the air. They spun around each other and formed a mysterious halo.

The chaotic qi permeated the halo as if it came from the very beginning of the universe and contained endless secrets.

As the Chaos Grave opened, the surrounding atmosphere became increasingly tense.

Everyone from the nine great aristocratic families was excited. They looked at the gradually appearing Chaos Grave with a hint of greed on their faces.

However, Qin Yu and the group of rogue cultivators knew that when it opened, they were not qualified to participate in the fight. They could only wait silently at the side, looking for a suitable opportunity to take action.

“Chaos Grave… It’s finally about to appear.” Qin Yu took a deep breath, his eyes filled with anticipation.

However, he also knew he would only die in vain if he forcefully participated in the fight now.

Qin Yu collected his thoughts and secretly observed the situation in the surroundings, waiting for the best opportunity to appear.

The moment the Chaos Grave completely opened, an ineffable terrifying internal qi spread out.

It was like the internal qi of death and caused everyone present to feel a chill run down their spines.

Gradually, the actual appearance of the Chaos Grave began to reveal itself.

Under everyone’s astonished gazes, a massive tomb gradually appeared on the ground.

This tomb was like a massive ancient tomb. It seemed to have been through ages but still stood on this land emitting an internal qi of vicissitudes.

This Big Grave was dark gold, and its surface was full of cracks as if bearing traces of endless years.

Around the Big Grave, ancient runes flickered with a strange light. They were as if narrating the legends of this ancient tomb.

Countless sanctums hid in this Big Grave.

These sanctums had their own unique characteristics. Some were as hot as a furnace, some as cold as a glacier, and some as dark as the netherworld.

Every sanctum contained a mysterious power from the beginning of the chaos, which was fascinating.

However, everyone knew that this Big Grave was not a safe place.

The murderous intent in these sanctums was endless and incomparably dangerous.

The passages between many sanctums were narrow and winding, causing people to lose their ways like in a maze.

Many dangers were in this endless maze. One could encounter all kinds of dangerous threats at any time.

Looking carefully, one could see indistinct remnant spirits resting in some sanctums. These were the terrifying existences that naturally formed in the chaotic body sanctums. They were like the messengers of death, ready to capture their prey at any time.

As they were born in the Chaos Grave, they had the innate responsibility to protect the tomb.

“So this is the Chaos Grave…” someone murmured.

“Too magnificent… Even if it’s compared to the Big Grave of the Immortal Emperor, it’s probably not much different…”

Everyone was shocked by this massive tomb instantly. Even Yan Guyun, Si Liuhe, and the others were shocked.

They were the people who had seen the real Big Grave of the Immortal

Emperor. Even so, they were indescribably shocked when they faced this Chaos Grave.

Qin Yu was silent. As he looked at the flickering Big Grave, numerous thoughts flashed through his mind.

“Chaos Grave… I must obtain the fortuity within.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Being a chaotic body similarly, once he obtained a corpse of a chaotic body, it would mean that his future cultivation would be twice as effective. It was also Qin Yu’s only chance to surpass Si Shiyue!

The Big Grave slowly appeared in front of everyone, flickering with extremely hoary radiance and internal qi.

Nine enormous sanctums appeared in front of everyone.

A cultivator from the nine great aristocratic families said excitedly, “Rumor has it that the sanctum in the Chaos Grave was a fortuitous encounter at the beginning of the chaos. If we can obtain the nomological inheritance within, it will definitely allow our cultivation to rise to a higher level!”

Another cultivator said worriedly, “But danger lurks everyvvhere in the Chaos Grave. The remnant spirits are ruthless, and the traps are dangerous. If we enter, wouldn’t we have a slim chance of survival?”

The eyes of a young cultivator beside him flashed with determination. He said frankly, “So what if it’s a slim chance of survival? Ever since we started cultivating, weren’t we always walking on the edge of life and death? I’d rather take the risk than miss this unprecedented opportunity.”

In this mysterious land, everyone had different expectations. They all understood that this ancient tomb was full of danger and temptation, and only by giving it their all could they gain a chance to turn things around!

After saying that, the young man’s figure flashed, and he shot straight toward the Chaos Grave!

He headed straight for a sanctum. However, the living beings in the sanctum had started moving before his body could reach the sanctum.

The mysterious living being reached out its palm and instantly turned the cultivator into ashes. Not even his corpse was left behind!

Seeing what happened, everyone’s expressions instantly changed drastically! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

They widened their eyes and watched in horror as the young cultivator turned into ashes. They couldn’t help but panic!

Although that cultivator wasn’t very powerful, he was still a Reversion Void Stage cultivator!

However, at this stage, he could not even retaliate in front of that living being. In just an encounter, he turned into ashes!

“How… How terrifying…” someone murmured and the fear on his face was clearly visible.

Some people immediately wanted to retreat and no longer dared to have any fantasies about the Chaos Grave!

Everyone present, be it the cultivators of the nine great aristocratic families or the other rogue cultivators, felt an invisible pressure. Their faces turned incredibly pale, and their eyes filled with fear and shock.

Even Yan Guyun, Si Liuhe, and the others couldn’t help but frown.

...

“Even you and I will find it difficult to resist the living beings in this sanctum,” Si Liuhe initiated to speak.

Yan Guyun didn’t say anything. He looked at the terrifying living being in the sanctum, who was motionless. No one knew what he was thinking.

“Right now, this Big Grave can be said to be in a completely unknown state. Someone has to take the lead to explore it,” Si Liuhe spoke again.

He looked at an elder beside him as if asking him to find a pathfinder.

It was called a “pathfinder”, but everyone knew it would end up serving as cannon fodder.

Therefore, no one was willing to scout for the Si family.

“Hmm?”

At this moment, the elder of the Si family seemed to have thought of something.

His gaze swept across the crowd and finally landed on the people of the Chu family..
