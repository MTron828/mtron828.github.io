2084 Dean Lei Arrives

Si Qianjing’s expression changed. He said coldly, “Qin Yu, don’t talk nonsense. Since I’ve promised you, I’ll certainly let you leave.”

Qin Yu smiled and shook his head. Suddenly, he spread out her hands and said, “In that case, I’ll trust you this time. I’ll hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture to you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu took out a jade slip from his arms and threw it to Si Qianjing and the others.

Everyone’s eyes lit up as they reached out to grab the jade. However, just as the jade slip was about to fall into their hands, a powerful pressure suddenly erupted from within. The jade slip instantly shattered into pieces and disappeared.

“This…” Everyone’s expression changed drastically. They widened their eyes, looking at Qin Yu, and could not help but roar, “You actually dared to trick us!”

“Hahaha!” Seeing this, Qin Yu could not help but burst out laughing heartily.

Besides Qin Yu, probably no one else could fool a dozen True Saints!

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and said smiling, “I’ve told you, the Traceless Immortal Scripture is not with me at all. You actually wanted to snatch it. It seems that you really want to get this Traceless Immortal Scripture.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The True Saints looked even more displeased, but they suppressed their anger and did their best to remain calm.

“Qin Yu, hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture obediently. Otherwise, we can’t guarantee to spare your life,” a True Saint said coldly.

“In the Holy Region, not many people dare to make fun of us like this. Qin Yu, you owe us your life now,” another True Saint also spoke.

Qin Yu thought for a while and said, “Alright, I’ll tell you then. The Traceless Immortal Scripture is placed in the Azure Rock Forest in the southernmost of the Crimson Moon Continent. If you’re brave enough, you can go and get it.”

“Qin Yu! We don’t have that much patience!” These True Saints finally lost their patience.

Si Qianjing’s face darkened as he said, “Don’t listen to his nonsense. Our Si family has already planted a mark on him. Qin Yu didn’t have time to go to the Azure Rock Forest. If I’m not wrong, the Traceless Immortal Scripture is with him. Just kill him and get it!”

As he spoke, Si Qianjing’s internal qi became increasingly terrifying as if he was about to attack at any moment.

“Do you dare to bet?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and asked.”

“Why not?” Si Qianjing was furious. “Everyone, believe me, the Traceless Immortal Scripture is either with him or in the Dragon Burial Cave! When I capture him and bring him back to the Si family, I’ll search through his divine sense forcefully. The Traceless Immortal Scripture won’t be missing!”

Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

Waiting for death was never Qin Yu’s character.

The Mysterious Heavenly Mirror floated above his head and his body emitted rays of Golden Light.

Seeing this, Si Qianjing sneered, “Oh? Do you still want to try? Interesting, interesting!”

“I have a tribulation magical artifact with me. Thus I’m not afraid of you!” Qin Yu said coldly.”

Si Qianjing’s palm strike was earth-shattering and tremendously terrifying!

His palm seemed to have transformed into a mountain, filled with destructive power as if it wanted to crush the world. Dark clouds rolled in the sky, lightning flashed, and strong winds blew as if the end of the world had arrived.

Under the pressure of this palm, the entire Crimson Moon Continent felt an unprecedented shock.

The mountains collapsed, and the earth cracked. The wind blew, and the clouds surged. Everything was trembling as if it was screaming for a chance to survive.

Countless cultivators dodged and looked at this earth-shattering battle in fear. They sighed in their hearts. Was this a battle between True Saints? It could be said to be world-destroying!

At the same time, Qin Yu was fearless. He held the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror tightly and circulated the magic power in his body with all his might.

The Mysterious Heavenly Mirror spun above his head, emitting a dazzling light. Layers of light waves spread out and formed a golden light shield that wrapped him tightly.

Si Qianjing’s palm had already struck down. In an instant, it was as if this palm was the only thing left in the world!

That enormous palm shadow was like a giant beast that devoured the heavens, attempting to devour Qin Yu.

“Boom!”

The instant they made contact, Qin Yu immediately felt tremendously intense pressure! The Golden Light on his body trembled violently but shattered in a moment!

“You’re courting death,” Si Qianjing said coldly.

Although it was just a casual palm strike, it was not something a Reversion Void Stage cultivator could withstand.

“Clang!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body suddenly emitted a crisp sound. That palm seemed to have been blocked by something and then directly shattered!

“Eh?”

Everyone was stunned, then quickly looked at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu could not help but stroke his body as if he could not believe it.

“He… He resisted it?” someone exclaimed.

“How could it be? He, Qin Yu, was only a Reversion to Void Stage cultivator, so how could he resist it?”

“I know. He must have obtained some treasures in the Chaos Grave,” someone came to his senses at this moment.

Qin Yu had entered the Chaos Grave and obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

He opened Wu Ji’s coffin. No one knew what treasure was hidden inside!

“It seems that Wu Ji’s clothes… is indeed useful!” Qin Yu was overjoyed!

This seemingly ordinary piece of clothing had withstood a palm strike from a True Saint!

“Hmph, no matter what treasures you have, it’s useless. In front of absolute power, everything is just an illusion,” Si Qianjing said coldly.

His eyes narrowed slightly, and rays of light emitted from his glabella.

The lights condensed and were incomparably resplendent. It was as if it wanted to pierce through everything!

Qin Yu’s expression changed as he instantly understood Si Qianjing’s intentions!

This guy had planned to attack Qin Yu’s divine sense!

Although Qin Yu’s body was protected by the divine robe, his divine sense was not comparable to the True Saint!

“Don’t cut off his primordial spirit. Otherwise, how can we search him forcefully?” a True Saint by the side reminded him at this moment.

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing. I’ll leave behind a trace of his divine sense,” Si Qianjing said coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression was incomparably ugly, and he did not know what to do for a moment.

Qin Yu was helpless against Si Qianjing’s attack!

“Alright, alright, let’s stop here. Aren’t you looking down on me by doing this?”

At this moment, a voice came from the horizon!

Everyone frowned and hurriedly turned around.

A white-bearded old man stepped through the void and came over. He was dressed in white and had an appearance of a celestial being with Daoist qualities.

When they saw clearly who it was, everyone’s expressions became slightly unnatural.

“Dean Lei!” Qin Yu was shocked and instantly became tremendously excited!

He did not expect Dean Lei to have come at such a crucial time!

Si Qianjing took a deep breath, looked at Dean Lei, and said quietly, “Good to see you, Dean Lei.”
