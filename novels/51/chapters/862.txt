Chapter 863: CHAPTER 863, the Martial Saint made his move!

Anyone who went against the higher-ups would die without a doubt!

However, if the martial saint was sent, the Guardian might not appear! After all, he had not appeared for many years!

Hearing Gu Zizhen’s words, Gu Xinghe said anxiously, “Dad, why take such a big risk to kill Qin Yu? I can kill him!”

Gu Zizhen glanced at him and said, “This is an order from the higher-ups. I can’t disobey it.”

Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth. Although he was unwilling, there was nothing he could do.

“It’s his honor to die at the hands of a martial saint,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Gu Zizhen did not say anything more. He looked at the person beside him and said, “Go and summon Zhai Xing to see me.”

“Yes.”The person next to him immediately bowed.

About half an hour later.

A man with short hair and white hair walked in.

This person looked very energetic, but he was already a hundred years old!

“Uncle Zhai Xing.”Gu Xinghe saw this person and quickly greeted him.

The man called Zhai Xing nodded slightly and then looked at Gu Zizhen.

Gu Zizhen said in a deep voice, “Zhai Xing, you and I have been brothers for many years. I’m afraid we need your help this time.”

Then, Gu Zizhen told Zhai Xing what had happened.

After Zhai Xing heard it, a hint of hesitation flashed across his face.

“I know this matter is too risky for you, but I can’t think of anyone else except you,”gu Zizhen said with a sigh.

Zhai Xing was silent for a moment, and then said coldly, “You have done me a favor. This matter, take it as me returning your favor.”

Gu Zizhen patted Zhai Xing’s shoulder and said, “When you come back, this second secret realm will have half as much as you.”

Zhai Xing grunted in gratitude. He did not say anything more, turned around, and walked out.

...

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association was now in ruins.

But as the highest-ranking chief of the martial arts world, they did not lack money at all.

Soon, they began to rebuild the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

During the season of heavy snow, countless people were moving bricks.

Xia hang stood in the ruins and could not help but smoke.

He had never thought that Qin Yu would be so crazy.

Not only did he kill all the purple robes in one move, but he also smashed the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

To them, this was definitely a great humiliation. This move would definitely anger the higher-ups.

“Sigh.”Xia hang let out a long sigh.

At this moment, he did not know whether his choice was right or wrong.

Right at this moment, Xia hang suddenly felt a wave of palpitations!

His expression suddenly changed. This palpitations were as terrifying as being targeted by a fierce tiger!

Xia hang hurriedly turned his head and saw a white-haired man slowly walking over.

Even if he did not know this person, Xia hang could feel that he was extraordinary!

“You are...”Xia hang could not help but lower his head and asked tentatively.

“Star Seizer.”The other party only spat out two words coldly.

Hearing these two words, Xia hang’s entire body suddenly shivered!

“You are Lord Zhai Xing? !”Xia hang’s face instantly turned pale!

Although he had never seen Zhai Xing before, everyone knew of Zhai Xing’s great name!

“Greetings, Lord Zhai Xing!”Xia hang hurriedly knelt down on both knees, extremely respectful.

Zhai Xing glanced at him and said coldly, “You are the president of Jingdu Martial Arts Association? A peak-stage martial marquis?”

Xia Hang said with a trembling voice, “In reply to Master Zhai Xing’s words, I was recognized by the higher-ups and was lucky enough to sit in this position.”

“It’s really getting worse with each generation,”Zhai Xing said lightly.

Xia hang did not dare to say anything. He slowly raised his head and asked with a trembling voice, “Master Zhai Xing, how did you suddenly appear?”

Zhai Xing glanced at him and did not say anything. He walked straight past Xia Hang. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xia hang immediately felt that something was wrong!

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association had just met with an accident, and Zhai Xing had come!

This was obviously aimed at Qin Yu!

“No, I have to think of a way to inform Qin Yu!”Xia Hang said in fear.

However, at this time, Zhai Xing turned around and glanced at Xia hang.

“From now on, no one is allowed to leave this place, no one is allowed to use communication tools,”Zhai Xing said coldly.

The appearance of a martial Saint had violated the agreement, so Zhai Xing naturally did not want too many people to know about this.

As he spoke, Zhai Xing extended his finger, and a ray of light burst out from his finger.

This ray of light outlined the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and no one was able to take even half a step forward.

Then, Zhai Xing waved his hand slightly, and everyone’s phones exploded!

When Xia hang saw this, his face instantly turned ashen!

This made it impossible for him to inform Qin Yu!

“It’s over, it’s over...”Xia hang muttered in his heart, his face deathly pale.

He did not believe that Qin Yu had the ability to fight a martial saint!

No matter how talented a person was, it was impossible for them to cross this gap!

Zhai Xing did not say anything and turned around to walk out of this place.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu knew nothing about this.

He also did not expect that the higher-ups would go against the agreement of the DAO Protectors and send out a martial saint to kill him!

Now, they were reminiscing about the past in the pavilion master’s Building and did not know that danger was approaching.

Looking at Yan Ruoxue lying in the medicinal bath, old Mister Yan’s face was filled with grief and anger.

“I really did not expect that my granddaughter would be subjected to such torture...”Old Mister Yan’s eyes were filled with muddy tears.

Qin Yu could only comfort him, “Old Mister Yan, Ruoxue is fine. I will think of a way as soon as possible.”

Old Mister Yan wiped his tears. He suppressed the anger in his heart and waved his hand, “I was out of control.”

“Old Mister Yan, don’t think too much.”The pavilion master also comforted him.

The three of them sat at the tea table and started chatting.

After their conversation, they learned that old Mister Yan had been abroad during this period of time.

With Yan Sihai’s suppression, it was difficult for him to make any progress in the country. No one was willing to do business with them.

Therefore, old Mister Yan decided to restart his business overseas.

After a year of hard work, Old Mister Yan finally had a new family background.

“Old Mister Yan, what kind of bloodline does Yan ruoxue have? Why would she attract so many people to fight over her?”Qin Yu said with some doubt.

Hearing this, Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

“I’m afraid this matter will have to start from many years ago,”old Mister Yan muttered in a low voice, as if he was reminiscing about the past.

“Old Mister Yan, if I’m not wrong, the bloodline in Ruoxue’s body is probably related to the Yan family’s secret realm,”the pavilion master at the side said.

Old Mister Yan didn’t hide anything. He nodded slightly and said, “That’s right.”

“The secret realm of the Yan Family? Isn’t the Yan family a commercial empire? They actually have a secret realm?”Qin Yu was dumbfounded.

Old Mister Yan said in a deep voice, “This is a rumor. I’ve only heard of it.”

“And the person who told me all of this is your father,”old Mister Yan said in a deep voice.

“My Father?”Qin Yu’s eyes immediately widened.

Old Mister Yan was about to speak when Qin Yu suddenly felt an incomparably powerful force approaching the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.
