Chapter 641: Qin Yu Appeared! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xia Hang was waiting for him to fall into the trap!

As long as Qin Yu died, he could relax and even receive a reward from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

“No one in the world can threaten me.” Xia Hang hid in the darkness and said coldly.

...

After Qin Yu left, he returned to the hotel.

He caressed the black robe in his hand and coldly said, “Tomorrow, I will let them all die in my hands.”

This so-called academy would also be destroyed!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu didn’t know that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had already set up an inescapable net.

The next day, the vicinity of the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy was completely silent.

Martial arts was originally a niche that very few people participated in. Therefore, the location where this academy was set up was also relatively remote.

As far as the eye could see, there was no one there.

The surroundings were either lofty mountains or endless forests.

At this moment, there were eight men in black-gold robe powerhouses hiding around the academy.

They stood at the commanding point and looked coldly at the entrance of the Academy.

“Is everything ready?” Xia Hang asked coldly.

“Yes, there is an inescapable net here. As long as he comes, there is no way he can escape.”

“The eight of us have already used our magical artifacts to seal off this area. Even if he grows wings, there’s no way he can escape.”

Xia Hang glanced at them and said coldly, “We must kill him at the first opportunity. We must not give him the slightest chance to catch his breath!”

“Don’t worry. If we can kill them, we naturally won’t choose to capture him alive,” someone said coldly.

Xia Hang lit up a cigarette and took a deep breath.

His fingers trembled slightly, as if he was a little nervous.

Xia Hang knew very well that this was a choice.

Between the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and Qin Yu, Xia Hang chose the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Xia Hang, who originally planned to be on both sides, changed his mind.

It was because Qin Yu was too unstable.

He had no respect for the strong. Such unruly people usually die early on.

“I’ll leave the rest to you guys,” Xia Hang said coldly.

“What, you’re not going to show up?” Someone beside him asked.

Xia Hang said self-deprecatingly, “With my strength, I won’t be of much help.”

“I’ll wait for your good news.”

After saying this, Xia Hang turned his head and left.

Time flew by.

The surroundings of the academy were silent.

Qin Yu didn’t appear for a long time.

They waited from early morning to evening, but Qin Yu didn’t appear.

This made them suspicious.

“Hasn’t he arrived yet?” Xia Hang walked over from the dark and asked in a deep voice.

The few of them looked at Xia Hang coldly and said, “We want to ask you. Where is he? Didn’t you say that he would definitely come?”

Xia Hang lit up a cigarette and took a deep puff. Then, he said, “Don’t worry, he will most likely come at night.”

“I hope so.” The few of them snorted.

The sky gradually darkened and brightened again.

However, the black-robed man that they had been waiting for didn’t come.

“Vice President Xia, are you toying with us?” The few of them were slightly unhappy.

Xia Hang said angrily, “Would I have the mood to joke with you guys?! I want to kill him more than any of you!”

“Then where is he?!” These people shouted angrily.

Xia Hang frowned slightly, and he was also somewhat puzzled.

Could it be that... Qin Yu had given up?

Or perhaps, he had realized something?

“Let’s continue to wait. He will come sooner or later.” Xia Hang said as he blew out a smoke ring.

“Continue waiting? How long will we have to wait? If he doesn’t come, won’t we have to wait for the rest of our lives?” The few of them said coldly.

Xia Hang narrowed his eyes and said, “He will definitely come. It’s just a matter of time.”

“Also, since President Qu has given me the authority, you have to listen to me!”

“I am your superior now. If anyone dares to disobey my orders, I will definitely report it to President Qu.”

After saying this, Xia Hang turned around and left.

After he left, a trace of mockery appeared on their faces.

These black-gold robe powerhouses simply looked down on Xia Hang.

Although Xia Hang was a vice president, everyone knew in their hearts that the purpose of his existence was to build a good relationship with the various aristocratic families.

As for his strength, it wasn’t even worth mentioning in front of these black-gold robe powerhouses.

In the blink of an eye, another day had passed, but the black-robed man didn’t appear.

This made everyone even more anxious, and they even had the intention to leave.

At this time, Qin Yu had already found a second house to rent.

Although Qin Yu found it hard to calm down, he wasn’t a rash person.

Qin Yu was somewhat wary of Xia Hang.

Therefore, he wasn’t in a hurry to head to the Martial Arts Academy. Instead, he planned to wait?for a while.

But Xia Hang wasn’t a fool.

As someone who often interacted with the various aristocratic families, he naturally had a deep grasp of human nature.

In the next few days, Qin Yu didn’t have any intention of heading to the Martial Arts Academy.

A few black-gold robe powerhouses suggested that they continue to release news to Qin Yu. However, this idea was immediately rejected by Xia Hang.

“Absolutely not. Don’t move at all. Just wait here.” Xia Hang said while smoking.

“Xia Hang, I think you’re playing with us. If he doesn’t come, you won’t do anything?” Someone said coldly.

Xia Hang glanced at him and snorted, “What a bunch of idiots with strong limbs and simple minds!”

“What did you say?” The few of them narrowed their eyes and revealed a trace of killing intent.

Xia Hang was fearless and sneered. “If we release the news now, don’t you think it’s too obvious that it’s bait?”

“The reason why Qin... the black-robed man didn’t show up is that he suspects that we have a trap.”

“Once we release the news now, even a fool can see that we are deliberately luring him here.”

These few words instantly rendered the eight black-gold-robed men speechless.

“Alright, then we’ll wait for him for another three days! If he doesn’t come in three days, we’ll go and explain the situation to President Qu,” the few of them said coldly.

Xia Hang remained silent. He stood at a high place and whispered, “It seems that Qin Yu isn’t a reckless man. I underestimated him.”

Another two days passed, and Qin Yu didn’t come.

This made the black-gold robe powerhouses lose their patience completely.

They looked coldly at Xia Hang and said, “Xia Hang, even though what you said makes sense, we won’t continue to wait. Time is very precious to us.”

After saying this, the few of them turned around and were about to leave.

Xia Hang was anxious, but there was nothing he could do.

However, at this moment, a black shadow appeared not far away.

He was walking towards the entrance of the Martial Arts Academy.

“He’s here!” Xia Hang hurriedly stopped everyone!

The black-robed man was walking over!

“He’s finally here.” The eight people’s expressions turned cold, and a strong killing intent burst out from their eyes.
