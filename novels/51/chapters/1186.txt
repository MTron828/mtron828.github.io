Chapter 1187: Chapter 1,187, the person behind the Sky Blood Rainbow 

Qin Yu gestured with his hand and said, “Come.”

“Alright! Then I’ll respectfully comply!”Chang Mang’s body erupted with a terrifying scarlet radiance.

Yao Qing, on the other hand, ran out a few hundred meters in a flash, afraid that he would be affected.

Qin Yu placed his hands behind his back, intending to take this punch head-on.

“I’m Coming!”Chang Mang shouted loudly, and with a swoosh, he shot towards Qin Yu!

That extremely fast speed even tore through the air, and a pair of iron fists that contained monstrous might ruthlessly smashed towards Qin Yu’s chest! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The gusts of light wind blew Qin Yu’s white hair up, and a pair of fists ruthlessly smashed onto Qin Yu’s chest!

“Clang!”

An extremely clear sound rang out!

This time, Qin Yu took two steps back!

But what was shocking was that there were still no traces left on his body!

“How is this possible!”Chang Mang’s eyes widened like copper bells!

He looked at his fists in disbelief, thinking that something was wrong with his body.

“As expected,”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Everything was as he had imagined. His body had indeed become stronger, and he had even reached an abnormal number of steps.

Chang Mang was a holy body, one of the best physiques in the world.

Although this punch was not his full strength, it was enough to show how terrifying Qin Yu’s body was.

“Are you the F * cking reincarnation of Sun Wukong?”Chang Mang scratched his head, looking very naive.

Qin Yu waved his hand and sighed. “I don’t know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.”

His spiritual energy showed no signs of recovering. Could it be that he would never be able to use his spiritual energy?

He would definitely be restricted. After stepping into the saint realm, he would meet countless geniuses.

They possessed all kinds of spiritual energy. Even if they were unable to kill Qin Yu, they would be able to tie him up and slowly torture him to death.

Furthermore, it was an attack from the primordial spirit. The physical body could not break through the defense. If the primordial spirit was directly cut off, it would be troublesome.

“Sigh.”Qin Yu let out a long sigh. There seemed to be no other way at the moment.

After a day of selection, Lu Yun was half-dead tired.

And for an entire day, Lu Yun actually did not choose a single person.

“It seems that your sect’s requirements for selecting people are quite high,”said Qin Yu.

Lu Yun glanced at Qin Yu and said, “If they are all talented like you, our sect will definitely welcome them.”

Qin Yu thought about it and agreed.

Ever since Qin Yu eliminated the martial arts association of Jingdu, almost everyone had the opportunity to stand out. After all, the resources had already been made public by Qin Yu.

If they were really talented, they would have made a name for themselves long ago.

“According to this progress, how many more days will it take?”Qin Yu asked.

Lu Yun shook his head and said, “There’s no way to confirm. The number of people is still increasing. Roughly speaking, it will take at least five days.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He just happened to take advantage of these five days to finish the things on hand.

He took a deep breath and could not help but be somewhat expectant.

“Ruoxue, we can finally meet,”Qin Yu muttered softly.

...

At this moment, in a dark corner, a young man in a black robe was sitting cross-legged on the ground. Cold Sweat kept coming out of his forehead, and he looked like he was in extreme pain.

“The people from the holy region are at the Heaven Gate, which is Qin Yu’s territory. If you appear, you will die without a doubt...”the hoarse voice came out of He Teng’s mind.

“Shut up! I may not be his match!”He Teng cursed angrily.

“Oh? If you are so confident, why haven’t you left for the Heaven Gate...”there was a hint of mockery in his hoarse voice.

He Teng snorted coldly and said, “That is Qin Yu’s territory. Other than him, there are also Chang Mang and the others. It is just that it is difficult for two fists to fight against four hands.”

“Hehe... all of this is just an excuse... do you want to give up this opportunity to enter the Holy Region...”

“Give up... I will never give up!”He Teng gritted his teeth.

“Give me your body, I will take you to the saint-level...”the hoarse voice said.

“Don’t even think about it! Why Don’t you lend me all of your strength? When I go to the saint-level, I will find a good body for you!”

“Hehe... If you give me your body, when I go to the saint-level, I will give you a body...”

“Since we can’t come to an agreement, then no one should go!”He Teng snorted coldly.

“Alright... I’ve been waiting for a long time. I don’t need a day or two more...”

He Teng’s expression was ferocious, and he felt a little conflicted in his heart.

Although this wasn’t the only chance to go to the holy region, the outcome was definitely different between going early and going late.

If they were left behind, it would be troublesome.

Other than he teng, Tian Xuehong was the same.

He was at the peak of a mountain, sweating profusely, his face full of unwillingness.

“Why can’t I go to the Holy Region? Why!”Tian Xuehong almost roared as he questioned.

And in front of him was the figure of a man.

The man’s back was facing him as he said coldly, “You can go, but not now. Once you appear at the Heaven Gate, Qin Yu will definitely kill you.”

“It doesn’t matter if you die, but if you expose important information, it will be troublesome.”

Tian Xuehong said with some anger, “I have done so many things for you. Are you planning to abandon me now?”

“You have done so many things for me?”The figure’s voice immediately contained a trace of coldness.

“Which thing did you do successfully? The immortal slaying sect actually left a trash like you behind!”

“If you want to die, I can help you right now!”

Tian Xuehong’s expression changed drastically.

Although he was unwilling, he did not dare to say a word.

“Alright, I’ll listen to you.”A moment later, Tian Xuehong said as if he had lost his breath.

The figure did not say anything more and turned around to leave.

At this moment, Tian Xuehong suddenly said, “Before this, can you let me know your identity? who exactly are you!”
