Chapter 883: Chapter 883, entering the Yan manor again 

Danger was slowly approaching, but Qin Yu did not care at all.

As long as no martial saints were born, Qin Yu would not be afraid of anyone.

After arriving in Jingdu, Yan ruoxue suddenly asked, “Why must you come to Jingdu?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Although I haven’t been able to make you not fear anyone yet, I want to live a normal couple’s life with you.”

After the two of them confirmed their relationship, they had very little time to get together. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Now that they could finally be together openly, Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t miss it.

He hailed a car from the airport and headed straight for the Yan family manor.

Just a trip to the airport had caused countless people to take photos and circulate them.

At this moment, Han Wei had also seen the various photos circulating on the internet.

A deep sense of powerlessness filled his chest.

...

Soon, Qin Yu brought Yan Ruoxue to the Yan family’s manor.

The Yan family’s manor was as strict as ever.

Strangers were not allowed to approach from dozens of meters away.

Ever since Yan Ruoxue left, this manor had become Yan Sihai’s property. Zhang Yin lived here all year round.

Returning to the Yan family’s manor once again, Yan Ruoxue had an indescribable feeling in her heart.

The scenes of the past could not help but appear in her heart. Those happy times seemed to have gone for good.

“Stop, this is the Yan family’s manor. No one is allowed to come forward!”Very quickly, two bodyguards rushed over.

But when they came close, they were stunned on the spot.

“Miss... Miss?”The bodyguard’s voice was slightly trembling.

Yan Ruoxue smiled faintly and said, “Why? Don’t you recognize me?”

“No... No, of course not.”The bodyguard waved his hand.

“Then why don’t you quickly move aside?”Yan Ruoxue said faintly.

A trace of embarrassment flashed across the bodyguard’s face.

“Miss, President Yan has instructed us that no one is allowed to come near. I...”The bodyguard stammered, somewhat at a loss.

Qin Yu could not help but berate coldly, “This is Ruoxue’s home. What has it got to do with him, Yan Sihai? If he has any objections, just let him come to me.”

Seeing this, the bodyguard did not dare to say anything more. He could only nod and make way.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue Strode into the Yan family manor.

After they entered, the bodyguard immediately gave Yan Sihai a call.

“President Yan, Miss is back...”the bodyguard whispered.

“What? !”Yan Sihai suddenly stood up.

He said coldly, “Yan Ruoxue... She’s Back!”

Yan Sihai’s expression was a little ugly. He paced around the office. After a moment, he asked, “Who is she with?”

“With... with Qin Yu.”The bodyguard did not dare to hide it.

When he heard Qin Yu’s name, Yan Sihai’s expression instantly became even gloomier.

After a moment, Yan Sihai said coldly, “I got it.”

After he hung up the phone, Yan Sihai immediately used his connections and called three half-step martial saints to rush towards the Yan family manor.

Yan family manor.

As soon as Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue entered the door, they saw Zhang Yin sitting on the sofa like a noblewoman.

Looking at Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu in front of her, Zhang Yin’s expression became even more unsightly.

She stood up abruptly and berated, “Who let you in! Hurry up and get out!”

Before Yan Ruoxue could say anything, Qin Yu said coldly, “You’re the one who should get out.”

Zhang Yin immediately flew into a rage, “You’re an outsider, what has it got to do with you!”

“Yan Ruoxue, listen well, this Yan family manor is mine now! If you’re sensible, get out quickly, or don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold as he walked towards Zhang Yin Step by step.

“I said get the hell out of here. Do you understand?”Qin Yu’s tone was extremely cold. The powerful pressure caused Zhang Yin’s entire body to tremble.

Zhang Yin’s two bodyguards hurriedly rushed out and blocked in front of Zhang Yin.

“Get... get him out of Here!”Zhang Yin said in a panic.

“Yes!”The two bodyguards rushed towards Qin Yu without saying a word.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He waved his hand and smashed the two of them into meat paste!

Seeing this scene, Zhang Yin immediately screamed in fear.

Qin Yu raised his hand and slapped her on the mouth.

Although the slap wasn’t very strong, it still shattered more than ten of Zhang Yin’s teeth and her mouth swelled up.

“Don’t think that I don’t dare to kill you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Zhang Yin had long been scared out of her wits. She covered her mouth and turned to run.

After chasing her away, Qin Yu flicked his finger and finished off the two corpses.

Then, Qin Yu looked at Yan Ruoxue and said, “Okay, it’s okay.”

However, Yan Ruoxue was a little worried.

“Yan Sihai won’t agree with you,”Yan Ruoxue said in a low voice.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m not afraid of him now.”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t know Qin Yu’s current strength. She only knew that the Yan family was huge, and the power they could use was beyond imagination.

“Qin Yu, don’t underestimate Yan Sihai. His power is beyond your imagination,”Yan Ruoxue said in a low voice.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. Even if he finds the heavenly king, it won’t work today!”

Seeing this, Yan Ruoxue could only sigh slightly.

Qin Yu didn’t take Yan Sihai seriously at all. He pulled Yan Ruoxue and went upstairs.

Looking at the place where she grew up, Yan Ruoxue also had an indescribable feeling in her heart.

She lay on the big bed that she used to have and said in a somewhat lazy voice, “It seems like nothing has changed, but it also seems like everything has changed...”

Qin Yu lay on her side and said in a low voice, “Ruoxue, we will have more and more...”

The two of them looked at each other and smiled, enjoying this moment of happiness.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt several internal Qi approaching him.

“Yan Sihai, you’ve really come. I was just about to look for you.”The corners of Qin Yu’s mouth could not help but curl up into a cold smile.

In just a moment, Yan Sihai had brought three half-step martial saints and pushed open the door to enter!

Zhang Yin was also beside him.

“Master, you must avenge me!”Zhang Yin covered her mouth and said with a pained expression.

The moment she saw Yan Sihai, Yan Ruoxue also quickly stood up.

She subconsciously shielded Qin Yu behind her and said, “Uncle, all of this has nothing to do with Qin Yu.”

Yan Sihai said with a cold face, “Yan Ruoxue, you actually helped an outsider. Tell me, what crime should you commit?”

“I’ll commit your grandfather’s crime.”Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

“Yan Sihai, your skin is really thick. Where did you get the face to say such words?”

Yan Sihai narrowed his eyes slightly and sneered: “I know you have some abilities recently, but in front of My Yan family, you are nothing!”

As he spoke, Yan Sihai took a step back.

“Don’t worry, my three half-step martial saint friends will take good care of you.”Yan Sihai said coldly.

Half-step martial saint!

When she heard these words, Yan Ruoxue’s face instantly turned extremely pale!

She knew what it meant to be a half-step martial saint!
