2174 The Supreme Elder Dies

Yao Xi fell silent.

He thought for a long time, and several figures flashed across his mind. In the end, he denied them all.

At this moment, the battlefield outside had reached its climax.

In such a battle, ordinary cultivators were not qualified to participate. Even if they were willing to sacrifice their lives, they might not be even to serve the role of cannon fodder.

Jue Wu’s body emitted a powerful internal qi to resist the terrifying Tower of Holy Light. However, the Tower of Holy Light was the most top-notch magical artifact of the Yao family. Its power was not something a True Saint could resist.

Even though Jue Wu had the power of the purple cloud pearl, she was repeatedly pushed back by the blows.

All of her internal qi was crushed by the Holy Light Tower. Jue Wu’s petite body was covered in blood.

“It’s useless. The Holy Light Tower is a magical artifact the Yao family uses for self-protection. Although it can’t be compared with a celestial artifact, it’s not something a True Saint can afford to provoke!” the Supreme Elder of the Yao family said coldly.

Jue Wu got up from the ground. She wiped away the blood from the corners of her mouth, but there was still no fear in her eyes.

“Quickly die. Even if you are the personal disciple of Dean Lei, you will definitely die for causing trouble in my Yao family today!” After the Supreme Elder shouted, several True Saints immediately attacked and activated the Tower of Holy Light!

The Tower of Holy Light emitted a dazzling light like a blazing sun rising on the battlefield. The light spread, illuminating the entire area and covering the surrounding scenery in a holy light.

While the power of the Tower of Holy Light was releasing, unparalleled sacred energy spread. The powerful light contained the sacred energy like the ethereal light of an angel’s feather.

The light from the Tower of Holy Light condensed into dazzling beams of light in the air. It attacked Jue Wu like a gigantic pillar of light. Wherever these beams of light passed, the air seemed to freeze, causing time to pause for a moment.

The beams of light collided with Jue Wu’s figure, immediately causing a series of explosions. The energy fluctuations spread out from the two parties, and the surrounding space seemed near collapse. A powerful force impacted the battlefield, withering the vegetation and reducing it to ashes while the earth and rocks shattered.

The sacred energy released by the Tower of Holy Light surged like a mighty torrent, spreading throughout the battlefield and purifying all evil and filth. The power of darkness had nowhere to escape before the light and turned into nothingness.

The internal qi in the surroundings was suppressed by the Tower of Holy Light, causing the cultivators on the battlefield to feel a profound sense of awe. Their movements became slow and difficult as if they were bound by the sacred power.

The entire battlefield was enveloped by the Tower of Holy Light and the scenery changed. The originally chaotic battlefield instantly transformed into a pristine and flawless environment filled with tranquility and solemnity. The dark clouds in the sky were dispelled, replaced by a clear blue sky.

The light illuminated every inch of the land, making people feel the power of holiness and hope. Under the illumination, the cultivators on the battlefield looked determined. They seemed to have felt a sense of victory!

All of the light enveloped Jue Wu!

Jue Wu raised her two small hands. Her moves were simple and crude, but it was pure true essence!

Pure true essence surged out of her delicate palms, forming rays of flickering light. Her body trembled slightly, and her injured body appeared paler and desolate.

She did not back down and faced the Tower of Holy Light head-on. She knew she was facing an invincible fortress, but she was unafraid. An unshakable persistence was in the depths of her heart, which could be said to be madness!

Jue Wu’s figure was like a fragile feather, barely visible in the light of the Tower of Holy Light.

She transformed into a stream of light, flickering between the light beams, trying to find an opportunity to break through.

However, the Tower of Holy Light was so powerful that Jue Wu’s efforts seemed insignificant.

Whenever she tried to dodge the beams, she would be enveloped by the light and blood would splatter everywhere.

Jue Wu’s body was gradually eroded by the light beams. Her skin cracked, and her bones protruded. She looked in pain, but she persisted.

“Ah!”

Jue Wu’s piercing and frantic cry echoed from within the light. It was a scream of madness and exhaustion!

A hint of determination flashed in her eyes. She gathered the last of her power in her hand, and her pure true essence formed a sword that flickered with a cold light. She raised her sword and slashed at the light.

The sword light cut through the sky and collided with the light of the Tower of Holy Light, resulting in an ear-piercing tearing sound. Jue Wu’s sword intent was fierce and firm. She no longer dodged but stood up and started a life-threatening battle with the light.

The collision between the sword and the light beams triggered a violent energy fluctuation that instantly spread out. The surrounding space collapsed, and the earth shattered. It was as if the entire world was trembling because of this duel.

Jue Wu’s body was enveloped by the light, and her sword completely shattered. However, she did not stop. She used her body of flesh and blood to resist the power of the Tower of Holy Light with all her might.

Her body was gradually devoured by the light, her skin peeled off, and her flesh mangled!

Finally, her petite body was pressed to the ground, looking appalling!

“Hmph, you don’t know what’s good for you!” The Supreme Elder looked at Jue Wu with cold eyes. He stepped forward and looked down at her with a hint of contempt in his eyes.

“Do you know the consequences of provoking the Yao family? The Yao family had stood tall for many years, but no one had ever… Ah!”

Before the Supreme Elder could finish speaking, a purple light pierced through his chest directly!

Before he could regain his senses, Jue Wu had already jumped onto his neck like a ghost!

Her body was covered in blood, and madness filled her eyes. Her two small hands grabbed the head like a demon that nearly went mad!

“Ah!”

Then Jue Wu shouted. She exerted strength with both hands and directly crushed the Supreme Elder’s head. She did not even let his primordial spirit off!

For a moment, everyone was stunned on the spot. No one had expected the Yao family’s Supreme Elder to be killed by Jue Wu. Moreover, he was killed in front of so many people!

“Kill her! Kill her!” Someone regained his senses and immediately roared furiously!

Soon the other elders regained their senses. They once again activated the Tower of Holy Light to kill Jue Wu!

But at this moment, nine feathers suddenly appeared on Jue Wu’s body! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

These nine feathers flickered with a strange light and protected Jue Wu. In the next moment, Jue Wu’s figure turned into a stream of light and escaped toward the sky!

“It’s the Nine Heavens Flying Feather of Thunder Courtyard. How could such a sacred item be in her hands?” someone recognized this item and hurriedly shouted!

Jue Wu had spent several days stealing the Nine Heavens Flying Feather. She had thought it was impossible to exterminate the Yao family in this attempt. Therefore, she had stolen the top-notch magical artifact of Thunder Courtyard in advance!
