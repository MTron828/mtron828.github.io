Chapter 344: Old Classmate Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This piece of news immediately caught Qin Yu’s attention.

He immediately opened up the piece of news.

The first thing that came into his sight was a ranking that had been placed at the top.

On this ranking, there were a total of ten names, and they were also the top ten in Pyro’s martial arts ranking.

Ye Qing and a person named Jiang He were both ranked first in Pyro.

And the second was a person named Kong Luo.

The third was from the Han family and his name was Han Xiu.

The fourth was from the Yan family and his name was Yan Jingyao.

Yan Jingyao was the son of Yan Sihai and he was also a genius in Jingdu.

As for Han Xiu, he was Han Wei’s uncle.

The people who occupied this list were almost all from the top families all over the country.

Besides Ye Qing and Jiang he, the others all had their backs against a big tree and possessed top notch resources.

Under this ranking, there was another ranking.

And this ranking was the ranking of the younger generation in Pyro.

At the top of the ranking was Yan Sihai’s son, Yan Jinyao!

It was said that he was the number one genius in the martial arts in Jingdu and had already stepped into the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm at the age of ten! His current strength was already unimaginable!

As he continued to read, he quickly found Han Wei’s name.

He was ranked fifth, and had maintained this position for many years.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and couldn’t help but think to himself, ‘If I beat Han Wei, then I would be ranked fifth.’

In this way, Qin Yu would be considered the only young man who had killed his way into the list from the bottom.

“Qin Yu?”

Just as Qin Yu’s thoughts were running wild, someone patted him on the shoulder.

After turning around, he saw a young man in a suit.

This young man looked familiar, but he couldn’t remember him for a moment.

“What? Don’t you remember me? I’m Zhang Hang,” said the young man.

Hearing this name, Qin Yu remembered.

“You’re my... college classmate?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Zhang Hang said with sarcasm, “A man of your eminence is apt to be forgetful.”

Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and said with guilt, “I’m really sorry. My memory isn’t very good.”

“Okay, it’s fate that we can meet here. It just so happens that a few of our classmates who are working in Jingdu are having a meal together on the second floor. Let’s go together,” Zhang Hang pulled Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu didn’t want to go at all because he had a withdrawn personality in university and didn’t have a good relationship with his classmates.

There were even quite a number of people who deliberately bullied Qin Yu because of his withdrawn personality.

His university years weren’t a good memory for Qin Yu.

“Let’s go. We’ve already met. It won’t make sense if you don’t go up and have a seat.” Zhang Hang said as he pulled Qin Yu along.

Since it was difficult to reject his kind offer, Qin Yu had no choice but to agree.

He followed behind Zhang Hang all the way to a very small private room upstairs.

As soon as he pushed open the door of the private room, Zhang Hang shouted excitedly, “Look, everyone, see who’s here!”

Everyone’s gaze immediately turned to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sized up the people in the private room and couldn’t help but frown slightly.

There weren’t many people in the private room. Including Zhang Hang and Qin Yu, there were only five people.

Qin Yu was very familiar with the remaining three people.

They were the backbone of the Student Union back then, but as members of the Student Union, they had never helped Qin Yu in any way. Instead, they often bullied and oppressed Qin Yu. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was because of these few people that Qin Yu’s university life was extremely difficult.

“Qin Yu? Why are you here too?” The person who spoke was the former president of the Student Union, Sun Bo.

Sun Bo was burly and two-faced. He was extremely tactful, and he was very popular in the school. He was also the one who bullied Qin Yu the most.

“Come, come, come. Sit down,” Sun Bo pulled Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and sat next to Sun Bo.

“I really didn’t expect you to come to Jingdu, Qin Yu,” Sun Bo said with a smile.

“That’s right, Qin Yu. What kind of job do you do in Jingdu?” Zhang Hang asked.

“Since he appeared here, what kind of job can he do? He must be a waiter!” Someone next to him mocked.

“Haha, don’t look down on the waiters. It’s said that the waiters here have a high salary, about seven to eight thousand a month!”

In the face of their ridicule, Qin Yu didn’t refute, but asked back, “Then what do you do?”

Sun Bo suddenly said with some pride, “Hehe, I’m now a senior executive in the company. My monthly salary isn’t much, only about twenty thousand.”

“Not only that, but my relationship with my boss is very good. We’re buddies.”

After saying that, Sun Bo even deliberately took out his Mercedes-benz car keys and placed them on the table.

The people beside him also said, “Yes, Mr. Sun is now the boss’ favorite! Mr. Sun helped us get our jobs!”

“Qin Yu, we are now the company’s elite management class!” Zhang Hang couldn’t help but feel proud.

Qin Yu could see that the reason Zhang Hang called him over was to satisfy their pathetic pride.

“Sigh, when we were in school, we already had management abilities. This ability determines our future direction,” Sun Bo said proudly.

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered. “Management ability? It’s the ability to kneel and kiss up. Since you can sit in your current position, you must have kissed up to other people a lot.”

“You don’t think kissing up to other people is shameful, but you’re proud of it. How do you manage to do it?”

Sun Bo’s expression changed, and he said with a bit of anger, “You must also have the ability to kiss up to other people! I think you’re envious.”

“Envious? I’m envious of you guys groveling on your knees every day? I’m envious of you guys bowing every day like lap dogs in front of people?” Qin Yu sneered.

“I’m sorry, but I really don’t envy your kind of life.”

Sun Bo seemed to be angered by Qin Yu. He slammed the table and stood up while shouting, “Qin Yu, you’re just a lame waiter. What right do you have to challenge me?!”

“When did I say that I’m a waiter?” Qin Yu glanced at them.

“Moreover, waiters rely on their own ability to make a living. How are they inferior to you?”

Sun Bo sneered and said, “If you’re not a waiter, then what are you? A dishwasher? Or a toilet cleaner?”

“Huh? I remember that when we were in school, Qin Yu seemed to clean a lot of toilets.”

“Haha, this is his professional skill! In terms of cleaning toilets, we’re really inferior to him!”

After saying that, the people in the private room roared with laughter.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said coldly, “I’m your daddy.”

As soon as he said that, the private room immediately quieted down.

Sun Bo narrowed his eyes and said, “You didn’t get enough beatings when you were in school, did you?”
