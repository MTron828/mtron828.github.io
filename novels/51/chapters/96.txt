Chapter 97: The Auction Began Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Upon hearing Yan Ruoxue’s words, Qin Yu almost spat out a mouthful of water!

Even the security guard at the door couldn’t help but secretly laugh.

However, Mr. Bai’s expression was extremely cold. He took a deep breath and suppressed his anger as he said, “On account of your beauty, I won’t lower myself to your level.”

Speaking up to this point, Mr. Bai paused and continued to laugh, “You want to go in? How about this, you come with me, and I’ll bring you in. How about that?”

Yan Ruoxue pretended to be surprised. “You can go in?”

Mr. Bai said with some pride, “Of course! It’s just a billion. It’s not worth mentioning!”

“Oh really, is that so?” Yan Ruoxue nodded.

Then, she took out her phone and dialed a number. Over the phone, she said, “There’s a person with the surname Bai at your door. I don’t want him to go in.”

After saying this, Yan Ruoxue directly hung up the phone.

“You shouldn’t be able to go in now,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Mr. Bai sneered. “Beautiful lady, are you joking with me? Or have you watched too many TV dramas?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At this moment, the phone of the security guard at the door suddenly rang.

He held the phone and said over the phone, “Yes, yes, I understand. Please don’t worry!”

After the phone call was disconnected, the security guard hurriedly walked in front of Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu. He bowed and said, “Sir, Miss, our boss said that you don’t need a capital verification. Please come in!”

Yan Ruoxue blinked. She looked at Mr. Bai, who wasn’t far away, and said, “We’ll wait for you inside.”

Mr. Bai snorted lightly and immediately walked towards the door.

However, when he reached the door, he was stopped by two security guards.

“What are you doing?! Don’t block the way!” Mr. Bai berated.

The security guard said expressionlessly, “Sorry, the higher-ups ordered not to let you go in.”

Mr. Bai’s expression changed and he immediately flew into a rage. “Nonsense! Get out of my way quickly. I’m friends with your boss!”

“It was our boss who gave the order personally,” the security guard said with a cold expression.

Mr. Bai was stunned.

The boss of the auction personally gave the order? What was going on?

Could it be that what that woman said just now... was true?

...

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue received the number plate and entered the auction.

Qin Yu naturally liked to keep a low profile, so he sat down in a corner.

“Isn’t this place too remote?” Qin Yu muttered.

“It doesn’t matter where we sit,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything else.

Ten minutes later, more and more people came to the auction venue. Soon, the seats were full.

These people were all wealthy people with a net worth of more than one billion, and their outfits were even more extravagant.

Qin Yu glanced at the crowd. Wanting to see if there were any martial artists among them, he tried to release his Inner Strength.

Not long after, Qin Yu discovered that there were many martial artists with Inner Strength, at least ten of them!

“It seems that Miss Yan is right,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Most of these wealthy people had martial artists by their side to protect their safety.

At this moment, the host walked onto the stage, and the venue quickly quieted down.

“Welcome to the South City auction, everyone!” The host said with a breezy smile.

“The South City auction has prepared the auction items for everyone with great care. I believe that everyone will definitely return from this auction with a full load!” The host shouted.

With the sound of his voice, the auction officially began.

There was a wide variety of items in the South City auction. There were jewelry, antiques, limited edition luxury goods, bonds, and herbs that Qin Yu wanted so badly.

The first item was a limited edition jewelry. It was allegedly personally crafted by a foreign master. In the end, it was sold for 880,000 yuan.

The second item was calligraphy. It allegedly originated from the Qing dynasty. The final price was as high as 3.5 million yuan!

Qin Yu wasn’t interested in these items, and he was a little anxious.

There were already four items on the stage, but there were still no herbs.

“Don’t worry.” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly grabbed Qin Yu’s hand.

“In most cases, the later the item is auctioned, the higher the value. Maybe the herbs you want are the finale.” Yan Ruoxue blinked and said.

Qin Yu nodded and muttered, “I wonder if I can get a piece today...”

He needed to identify the age of the herbs himself. Many top-grade herbs didn’t look nice in terms of appearance.

At this moment, the host suddenly took out a dark green jade pendant.

The jade pendant was of excellent quality and was a brilliant emerald color. One could tell that it was obviously rare jade material!

“This is an auction item entrusted to us by our auctioneer. It is made of natural ice seeds. The starting price is six million! Each increment must not be less than five hundred thousand!” The host shouted.

Looking at this piece of jade, Qin Yu immediately raised his number plate and shouted, “Six million and five hundred thousand!”

This surprised Yan Ruoxuea a little. She looked at Qin Yu and said, “You like Jade?”

Qin Yu scratched his head and smiled. “I have never given you any decent gifts. I want to bid for it and give it to you.”

“You can’t refuse. This carries my earnest intentions!” Before Yan Ruoxue could say anything, Qin Yu hurriedly said.

A hint of embarrassment appeared on Yan Ruoxue’s aloof countenance. She smiled and nodded. “Okay, I will definitely accept it!”

There was another reason Qin Yu wanted to bid for this jade stone and give it to Yan Ruoxue.

It was because Jade was an excellent item to refine. Qin Yu planned to refine this jade stone into an amulet and give it to Yan Ruoxue.

Ever since the last incident, Qin Yu had been blaming himself. However, he couldn’t always be by Yan Ruoxue’s side, so he came up with this idea.
