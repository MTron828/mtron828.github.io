Chapter 1179: Chapter 1,179. That’s it? 

“The tomb of a Saint?”Qin Yu frowned.

“That’s right. It’s also called the tomb of an ancient saint,”Lu Guan said with a smile. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

This was probably the most terrifying tomb he had ever seen.

An ancient saint was a virtual entity. At this level, it was enough to cross the galaxy.

As for the flesh and bones of a sage, to a cultivator, they were all top-notch tonic, far surpassing all kinds of herbs.

He had never expected that there would be a sacred mausoleum hidden in the Green Earth Park!

Qin Yu subconsciously looked around, as if he was looking for someone.

However, he could not find the figure with the handlebar moustache even after looking around for hundreds of meters.

“Strange.”Qin Yu frowned.

Where did the handlebar mustache go? Normally, he was involved in such matters.

Could it be that he had left Earth since the last time?

“Alright, you must listen to my orders from now on,”Lu Guan said as he looked at the Holy Mausoleum.

After that, Lu Guan pointed at a person and said, “You, go and explore the grave.”

“Me?”

A trace of fear flashed across the face of the disciple who was pointed at.

“I... I don’t dare to go. I have a strong sense of unease in my heart...”said the disciple.

Lu Guan stared at him and said, “I don’t dare to go there. With Your Courage, you still want to follow me to the Holy Region?”

Hearing this, the disciple could only clench his teeth and bite the bullet as he walked toward the Holy Mausoleum.

But at this moment, Qin Yu reached out and grabbed his arm.

“You do whatever they tell you to do. Are You Stupid?”Qin Yu said with a cold face.

“Even a drop of essence blood of an ancient sage can take your life, let alone an ancient Sage’s grave.”

Hearing this, the disciple immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

But Lu Guan was not happy. He said with a dark face, “Kid, what do you mean? How dare you disobey me?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Do you want my people to die? To be cannon fodder for You?”

Lu Guan’s face became colder and colder, and his internal Qi was also climbing rapidly.

He said with a cold face, “Kid, I’ve disliked you for a long time.”

“Oh? Really? What a coincidence. I also disliked you.”Qin Yu sneered.

“You like to stand out, don’t you? Fine, then I’ll let you do it!”Lu Guan shouted.

Then, Lu Guan reached out his hand and grabbed Qin Yu’s arm, intending to throw him into the sacred mausoleum!

But soon, Lu Guan realized that something was wrong.

Even if he tried his best, Qin Yu still stood there without moving at all, like Mount Tai!

“How is that possible!”Lu Guan’s face changed. He didn’t believe in internal Qi and tried to throw Qin Yu out again.

However, Qin Yu still did not move. There was a cold smile on his face.

“That’s all you have? I think you should go in.”Qin Yu suddenly reached out his hand and grabbed Lu Guan’s neck. He easily lifted him up!

Lu Guan’s face immediately changed! He could not figure out how Qin Yu could have such terrifying strength when he was only at the middle stage of the Martial Saint Realm!

“You... Let Go of me!”Lu Guan roared angrily.

Qin Yu lifted Lu guan up and sneered, “Aren’t you from the Holy Region? Is that all you have?”

Lu Guan roared angrily, “Since you know that I’m from the Holy Region, why don’t you let go of me! You... Don’t you want to go to the Holy Region Anymore?”

Hearing this, the surrounding people immediately advised in a low voice, “Forget it, sect master, let him go. We still need him to go to the secret realm after all...”

“Yes, it’s not easy to open the holy region. If something goes wrong at this time, the loss will outweigh the gain.”

“Do you hear me? Let Me Go Now!”Lu Guan shouted angrily.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered, “What you said makes sense, but so what? Since you came from the Holy Region, you must have treasures. This holy power should be nothing to you, right?”

After saying that, Qin Yu suddenly exerted force and directly threw Lu Guan into the holy mausoleum.

The huge force made Lu Guan unable to control his body!

His body involuntarily shot toward the Holy Mausoleum and finally fell on the training field!

“Lu Guan!”Lu Yun, who was at the side, was instantly furious. She shook her palm and a long sword fell into her palm.

“Kid, you are really audacious!”Lu Yun said coldly with the long sword in his hand.

Qin Yu glanced at her and sneered, “It seems that you want to go too. Well, then you should go with him.”

However, Lu Yun was not Lu Guan. She did not want to sit and wait for death. She even moved the long sword slightly and slashed at Qin Yu’s head!

Qin Yu sneered. He stretched out two fingers and caught the long sword in his fingers!

These two fingers were like iron pincers. No matter how Hard Lu Yun struggled, he could not break free!

“You’re only at the advanced stage of the Martial Saint Realm. I really don’t know where your arrogance comes from,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Let me tell you, don’t think that just because we want to go to the saint realm, we have to Grovel and beg you. This is earth. Even if I kill all of you, you won’t be able to do anything!”

After saying that, Qin Yu’s two fingers flickered with golden light.

This resplendent golden light was incomparably hot, and a terrifying power erupted from these two fingers.

Kacha

With a clear sound, the longsword shattered!
