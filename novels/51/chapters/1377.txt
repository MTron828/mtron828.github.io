Chapter 1378: Chapter 1378, Face Changing 1

“Alright, I’ll wait for you here tomorrow morning,”Qin Yu said to sister Lin.

Sister Lin didn’t waste any more time and turned around to leave.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to stay here for too long and immediately rushed into the depths.

The next morning.

Qin Yu changed a tree and hid, waiting for sister Lin’s arrival.

Ten minutes later, sister Lin appeared nearby.

She scanned the surroundings and said, “Come out.”

Qin Yu knew that sister Lin would not lie to her, so she jumped down from the tree.

“Sister Lin.”Qin Yu greeted sister Lin.

Sister Lin acknowledged and then took out a map.

A location was marked on the map, and on the back of the map, there was a line of words written by Sister Lin:

Boss Zheng, my distant brother has just arrived in the South Province and needs a job. Please help him.

Qin Yu looked at the line of words and scratched her head. “Sister Lin, what does this mean?”

Sister Lin explained, “The heavenly cloud sect is extremely large, so it naturally needs a large number of suppliers, including medicinal herbs, food, weapons, and so on.”

“And this boss Zheng is the supplier to the Heavenly Cloud sect. He is responsible for delivering food to the Heavenly Cloud sect. What he needs is a large number of ordinary people and low-level cultivators.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but look at boss Zheng in shock, his eyes filled with astonishment.

Qin Yu really hadn’t thought of this. After sister Lin’s reminder, he finally reacted.

Where there were people, there was a market, even in the immortal cultivation world.

“Sister Lin, thank you.”Qin Yu cupped his hands to sister Lin.

It had to be said that she had indeed helped Qin Yu a lot. As a result, Qin Yu had many more opportunities to come into contact with the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Be careful,”sister Lin reminded him.

After parting with sister Lin, Qin Yu first found a safe place and applied the medicine on his face.

He stood by the river, quietly waiting for the change in his appearance.

“Does this thing really work?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter softly as he sat by the river.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt a stabbing pain on his face, like a mask trying its best to fit his face.

Qin Yu hurriedly stood up from the ground. He lowered his head to look at the reflection of his face in the water. He could not help but look shocked.

He saw that the reflection of Qin Yu had changed his appearance.

Compared to before, this appearance appeared extremely mediocre. Even if it was thrown on the side of the road, no one would take a second look at it.

It was not ugly, nor was it good-looking. It was just so ordinary that it could not be more ordinary.

“Damn, it’s so ugly. It’s even uglier than before,”iron egg scolded.

Qin Yu had a different opinion.

He touched the unfamiliar face and smiled. “Not bad.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It was meant to be a stealth. Whether it was too handsome or too ugly, it was not a good thing.

“With this face, I think no one will be able to recognize me,”Qin Yu thought to herself.

At this moment, tie Dan said, “Don’t be too optimistic. If someone can see through your primordial spirit, you will also be exposed.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “It’s alright. No one will take a second look at such an ordinary face.”

With that, Qin Yu did not waste any more time.

He first went to Gu City to take a look around with this face.

After making sure that no one could recognize him, Qin Yu rode on a flying exotic beast and rushed towards the vicinity of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The Heavenly Cloud sect was very far from Gu City. Even if Qin Yu rented a flying exotic beast, it would still take several days.

Along the way, Qin Yu exhausted three flying exotic beasts to death before he used the shortest amount of time to reach the vicinity of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

This was the second time Qin Yu came to the vicinity of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The first thing he saw was the huge mountain gate of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The entire sect was set up on a tall mountain, dozens of meters higher than the surrounding area, as if to express the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s high and mighty status.

Looking at the words “Heavenly Cloud sect”hanging in the clouds, Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his fists.

“You’d better restrain your killing intent.”At this moment, tie Dan reminded him in his mind.

“If you don’t want to be found out, you’d better restrain yourself.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and suppressed the killing intent in his heart.

Then, Qin Yu took out a map and followed the location of the map to the supplier.

The supplier was called an Fenglou, which was at the foot of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s mountain.

The entire an Fenglou was enormous. Besides supplying the heavenly cloud sect, it was also a very famous local restaurant.

It was said that most of the Tianyun sect elders would come here to eat when they received guests.

Qin Yu tidied up his clothes and then stepped into anfeng restaurant.

As soon as he entered the door, the waiter quickly ran over.

“Sir, what would you like to eat?”The waiter said with a smile.

Qin Yu said politely, “I was recommended by a friend to work here.”

Hearing this, the smile on the waiter’s face immediately disappeared without a trace.

“Wait here.”The waiter waved his hand.

Qin Yu nodded and found a random place to sit down.

While Qin Yu was waiting, someone suddenly walked in.

“Elder Bai, you’re here!”The waiter saw this person and ran over quickly.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s face changed dramatically.

“Don’t be nervous. Keep your composure, or people will suspect you. Your Face is no longer Qin Yu’s, so there’s no need to be nervous,”iron egg reminded him.
