Looking at the Heaven Swallowing Python in human form, Granny Qin was so excited that she almost cried.

She gently held the young man’s face and said in a trembling voice, “My good child... I will definitely make you the most powerful person in the world!”

A young man at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm appeared.

...

On this day, Jingdu Martial Arts Academy officially began to recruit students.

Early in the morning, Zhuang Teng and the others arrived at the vicinity of the academy.

These young masters of the aristocratic families seemed to like to gather together.

A few people stood at the door, instantly attracting the attention of countless people.

“I heard that Yan Jinyao has been in closed-door cultivation recently?” Zhuang Teng asked casually.

“After learning that Qin Yu was the black-robed man, Yan Jinyao directly went into closed-door cultivation.” Chu Heng nodded slightly.

“it seems that that matter dealt a great blow to him.”

“With Yan Jinyao’s personality, he absolutely wouldn’t allow anyone to surpass him. If I’m not wrong, the first thing he does after he comes out of seclusion is to send a challenge to Qin Yu.”

The few of them nodded one after another. They understood Yan Jinyao’s personality too well.

As the genius of the Yan family, his talent was absolutely unparalleled.

Even in Jingdu, he was a well-known figure and always ranked first among the younger generation.

Now that his title had been seized by a young man from the countryside, he definitely wouldn’t be satisfied.

More and more people came to the academy’s entrance. Many people came because of its reputation.

However, the requirements for martial artists here were extremely strict. Very few people could be selected.

“By the way, have you all heard about the Mystic Realm?” At this time, Zhuang Teng seemed to have remembered something.

“Yes, the Mystic Realm is indeed shocking. If there really is such a place for cultivation, then it would be good news for us.”

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is actually secretly hiding such resources. I seriously suspect that the outside world’s judgment of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s strength might be wrong.”

“Indeed, if the Jingdu Martial Arts Association really controls more than half of the Mystic Realm, then they might be able to create a top Martial Saint realm expert.”

Martial Saints were the most powerful existences in the hearts of almost all martial artists.

Even Jiang He and Ye Qing, who were known as the number one, were only at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm.

“Let alone a Martial Marquis, even a late-stage Martial Marquis is not someone we can compare with.” Zhuang Teng laughed bitterly again.

The strength of a late-stage Martial Marquis was far above that of a middle-stage Martial Marquis.

And a peak-stage Martial Marquis was the strongest in the current era.

It was said that an outstanding person at the peak of the Martial Marquis could rely on his physical body to resist the Martial Saint weapon!

If he had a physical body like Qin Yu’s, once he stepped into the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm, the Martial Saint weapon wouldn’t be able to harm him at all!

Thus, the greatest reliance of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association seemed to be helpless against Qin Yu.

Just as everyone was discussing, Qin Yu’s figure suddenly appeared in everyone’s field of vision. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He wore a light-colored sportswear and looked extremely refreshing.

“Qin Yu? Why is he here?” Everyone was somewhat surprised when they saw this.

For a moment, everyone’s gazes fell on Qin Yu!

“Could it be that he also wants to participate in this academy?” Chu Heng exclaimed.

“Brother Qin, I didn’t expect you to come.” Zhuang Teng thought for a moment and then politely walked toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded at him and didn’t say anything.

Zhuang Teng said with a smile, “Brother Qin, why are you here?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I’m here for the same reason you are here.”

As soon as he said this, Zhuang Teng’s mouth opened wide.

“Brother Qin, you killed Qu Xie and made the Jingdu Martial Arts Association lose face. Aren’t you afraid that they will attack you?” Zhuang Teng couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu sneered. “I didn’t kill Qu Xie. It was one of their own people.”

Chu Heng gave Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “Brother Qin, I really admire your courage.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He closed his eyes and waited for the academy to open.

Qin Yu came here for two purposes.

The first was for the Scripture Pavilion, and the second was to explore the Mystic Realm and find the Mystic Realm that imprisoned Yan Ruoxue.

Of course, Qin Yu knew that there would be danger, but if he didn’t come, he might never be able to save Yan Ruoxue.

Just as everyone was waiting, Qin Yu suddenly felt a familiar internal qi.

He frowned slightly and looked in the direction of this internal qi.

He saw Granny Qin and Xia Hang walking over.

Beside Granny Qin was a black-haired young man.

The young man had a head of waterfall-like hair, and his long and narrow eyes were cold.

The moment Qin Yu looked at Granny Qin, Granny Qin also noticed Qin Yu’s figure.

“Qin Yu...” Granny Qin’s body suddenly burst out with a ruthless aura!

She walked toward Qin Yu step by step, narrowed her eyes, and said, “What are you doing here?”

Qin Yu pointed at the gate of the martial arts academy and said, “Of course I’m here to participate in the trip to the Mystic Realm.”

“Are you worthy?” Granny Qin said angrily.

Qin Yu sneered. “Old b*stard, it’s not up to you to decide whether you’re worthy or not. Don’t think that I don’t know. The officials will be monitoring the recruitment this time. I don’t believe that you dare to go against the officials.”

Xia Hang told him all this information.

Ever since Qu Xie revealed the secret, the officials were furious.

In order to prevent the Jingdu Martial Arts Association from using the same trick again, they had sent people to keep an eye on them.

“You b*stard...” Granny Qin was so angry that she was trembling.

At this moment, the black-haired young man behind him took a step forward.

A cold killing intent instantly assaulted his face!

Qin Yu frowned slightly after feeling this chill.

This youth’s internal qi seemed somewhat familiar, but he couldn’t remember where he had seen it before.

“If you dare to talk nonsense again, I’ll kill you.” The black-haired youth’s long and narrow eyes emitted a chill.

Qin Yu raised his brows and said, “Kill me? Just you? Who are you? How come I’ve never seen you before?”

The black-haired youth didn’t say a word. He only said quietly, “I’m stronger than all of you. In my eyes, all of you are just a bunch of ants.”

The moment these words were said, everyone was shocked.

Zhuang Teng and the others were extremely displeased.

Stronger than all of them? And he even treated the descendants of the aristocratic families as ants? This tone was too arrogant!

“How arrogant. Where did you jump out from?”

At this moment, a figure walked over from not far away.

This person was none other than Kong Yun, who was second only to Yan Jinyao!

During this period of time, Kong Yun had also been in closed-door cultivation. Now, he had stepped into the advanced stage of the Martial Marquis Realm!

This time, Kong Yun had only one purpose for coming out of closed-door cultivation. That was to become the number one person on the ranking list!
