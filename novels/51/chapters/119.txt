“Good, good!” Liu Shihui nodded frantically.

“Tomorrow at eight in the morning, I’ll wait for you at home. If you don’t come, you’re a coward!” Liu Shihui sneered.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow.”

After saying that, he turned around and left.

This time, all the spotlight shone on Qin Yu’s body.

And this time, the light was on Qin Yu himself, not on Yan Ruoxue.

After taking a few steps forward, Qin Yu suddenly stopped. He raised his head and looked in Wei Ming’s direction.

Wei Ming’s expression suddenly changed, and his heart thumped!

But Qin Yu didn’t say anything and walked out with Yao Qing, Sun Ying, and the others.

Wei Ming looked at Qin Yu’s back and couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice, “I... I was actually scared just now... ?”

...

As they walked out of the Water Dragon Cave, everyone made way for Qin Yu.

On this day, Qin Yu was destined to be the center of attention.

“Mr. Qin, you can’t go tomorrow. You’ve embarrassed the Liu family. The Liu family definitely won’t let you off the hook!” Yao Qing said anxiously.

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you think I’m afraid of them?”

Yao Qing said with a trembling voice, “Mr. Qin, I know that your current strength has already exceeded my imagination, but the Liu family isn’t that simple to deal with. They...”

“Guess how much strength I used just now?” Qin Yu interrupted Yao Qing.

Yao Qing was stunned and hurriedly asked, “Mr. Qin, you didn’t use your full strength just now?”

Qin Yu snorted lightly. “I only used 30% of my strength.”

This time, Yao Qing was so shocked that he couldn’t speak.

He couldn’t figure out how a ninth stage Inner Strength Master could beat an Inner Strength Master Hands with 30% of his strength? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Brother-in-law, you’re too cool. You’re my idol!” On the way, Sun Ying kept chattering.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He didn’t want to pay any attention to Sun Ying.

“Brother-in-law, why don’t we go out to eat?” Sun Ying said with a smile.

Qin Yu touched his belly. He had to admit that he was a little hungry after exercising for so long.

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

“How about we go for hotpot? It’s my treat!” Sun Ying patted her chest and said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Anything is fine.”

The car soon arrived at a hotpot restaurant.

Sun Ying had long settled down in South City. Her family was quite rich, so she had quite a lot of pocket money.

As soon as she entered the door, she shouted, “What do you want to eat today? It’s my treat. Order whatever you want!”

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony. During this period of time, his appetite was unusually large, so he ordered a table full of meat.

“Speaking of which, brother-in-law, you’re so outstanding now. My sister must be very happy, right?” Sun Ying said with a smile.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “Your sister and I have already divorced.”

“Divorced?” Sun Ying was stunned. She immediately slammed the table and stood up.

“What’s going on? Why did you guys get divorced?” Sun Ying looked a little nervous.

She didn’t want to lose such an outstanding brother-in-law.

Qin Yu didn’t explain, but said, “You should go ask your sister.”

Sun Ying didn’t say anything, but Chen Xin, who was beside her, was a little excited.

Young girls liked gallant men, and Chen Xin was no exception.

Ever since she saw Qin Yu’s gallantry, she couldn’t help but fall for him.

After dinner, Sun Ying proposed to go out for more fun, but was turned down by Qin Yu.

He and Yao Qing found a hotel and temporarily stayed there.

“Mr. Qin, it’s better to be careful tomorrow,” Lying next to Qin Yu, Yao Qing reminded him again.

“Okay, go to sleep quickly. I know what to do.” Qin Yu yawned and then fell asleep.

Seeing this, Yao Qing sighed and didn’t say anything more.

Qin Yu slept very soundly, but at this moment, the Liu family was in chaos.

Liu Shihui’s father, Liu Yi, looked grim and his eyes were filled with anger.

“You trash, you’ve thoroughly humiliated the Liu family!” Liu Yi said angrily.

Liu Shihui didn’t say anything and didn’t dare to say anything.

This time, the Liu family had indeed suffered humiliation.

“Old Master, let’s think about what to do,” the secretary said softly.

Liu Yi said with a cold expression, “Of course. If we let him walk out of South City like this, the Liu family won’t have a place in South City anymore!”

“Moreover... the hangers-on that our family supports aren’t for show!” Liu Yi said with a gloomy expression.

The Liu family supported countless hangers-on, and among them, there was no lack of martial artists.

They spent a lot of money to support this group of people, with the purpose of them being able to help at a critical time.

“Go and call Tao Shan over for me,” Liu Yi said coldly.

The secretary hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes.”

After the secretary left, Liu Shihui couldn’t help but remind Liu Yi, “Dad, Qin Yu and the Yan family have a special relationship. If anything happens to him in the Liu family, the Yan family definitely won’t let us off the hook...”

Liu Yi’s expression changed again. He hurriedly scolded, “Why didn’t you tell us earlier?”

Liu Shihui opened his mouth but didn’t dare to say anything.

“Yan family, Yan family...” Liu Yi’s expression was a little ugly. For a moment, he didn’t know what to do.

After thinking for a moment, Liu Yi sighed and said, “We’ll act according to the circumstances tomorrow.”

Other than the Liu family, many other families in South City were secretly watching.

Qin Yu’s abilities naturally made them want to recruit him, but no one was in a hurry to make a move.

It was because they were waiting to see if Qin Yu could walk out of the Liu family safely.

If he died in the Liu family, then there was no need to recruit him.

The next day, Qin Yu slept until dawn.

He slept very soundly.

“How comfortable.” Qin Yu stretched and then looked at Yao Qing, who was sleeping soundly.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu finally decided not to disturb Yao Qing’s sleep.

He tidied himself up and rushed to the Liu family’s home.

At this time, the Liu family’s huge villa was already filled with people.

These people were all hangers-on of the Liu family.

Liu Yi made a cup of tea and quietly waited for Qin Yu’s arrival.

“Dad, Tao Shan is here.” At this moment, Liu Shihui walked forward and whispered.

They saw a two-meter-tall extremely burly man walking in.

The moment he entered, everyone felt a little awed and intimidated.

It was because Tao Shan had an extremely powerful presence!

“Mr. Liu.” Tao Shan nodded to Liu Yi.

Liu Yi waved his hand and said, “Tao Shan, follow my instructions later.”

“Okay, Mr. Liu.” Tao Shan nodded and retreated to the side.

“Maybe Qin Yu wouldn’t dare to come at all.” Someone beside joked.

Liu Yi couldn’t help but think, that would be the best.

If Qin Yu didn’t come, the Liu family would still have some dignity left, and they wouldn’t have to risk offending the Yan family.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu had already swaggered in.

His expression was calm, and there wasn’t the slightest hint of nervousness or uneasiness.
