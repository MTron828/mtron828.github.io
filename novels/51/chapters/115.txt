Liu Shihui got closer and closer to the crowd and soon arrived beside Jiang Long.

Jiang Long eagerly walked forward. Just as he was about to greet him, Liu Shihui directly walked past Jiang Long and arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you really dared to come,” Liu Shihui said coldly.

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “I’m still waiting for you to apologize to my friend.”

“Hahahaha!” Liu Shihui couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“I admire your courage to face death with resignation,” Liu Shihui said with a sneer.

“I don’t want to argue with you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Liu Shihui nodded. He leaned towards Qin Yu’s ear and whispered, “You should feel honored to have such a big fuss made over a nobody like you.”

After saying that, Liu Shihui patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and strode into the Water Dragon Cave.

At this moment, Sun Ying, Jiang Long, and the others were all dumbfounded.

This Qin Yu was really the Qin Yu who was competing with Liu Shihui?

“How is this possible...” Sun Ying swallowed hard, and her eyes were filled with disbelief.

Wasn’t Qin Yu a good-for-nothing who only knew how to do laundry and cook? How did he become someone who challenged Liu Shihui in the blink of an eye?

Jiang Long, who was a short distance away, was even more embarrassed. He wished he could find a hole to hide in.

“Sun Ying, your brother-in-law is quite amazing!” Chen Xin’s eyes couldn’t help but light up as she said with some excitement.

Sun Ying was still in shock and didn’t come back to her senses for a while.

“Oh right, Liu Shihui, those are my friends. Let them come in together,” Qin Yu, who had walked to the entrance of the Water Dragon Cave, suddenly shouted.

Liu Shihui turned around and glanced at him. He waved his hand and said, “Do whatever you want. As long as you’re not afraid of embarrassing yourself in front of your friends.”

Qin Yu turned his head to look at Sun Ying and said, “Come in.”

Chen Xin shouted excitedly, “Sun Ying, did you hear that? Your brother-in-law wants us to go in!”

After saying that, Chen Xin pulled Sun Ying and walked into the Water Dragon Cave.

“Oh right, except you.” Qin Yu pointed at Jiang Long and said.

Jiang Long’s expression changed, and he couldn’t help but curse inside, “Arrogant *sshole, I looked forward to seeing Young Master Liu kill you!”

Everyone strode into the Water Dragon Cave, and the separation line was pulled up again.

At this time, there was still nearly an hour before the official martial arts competition, so Qin Yu and Liu Shihui weren’t in a hurry.

“Qin Yu, you... When did you become someone with a powerful background in Jingdu?” Sun Ying couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “That was just Jiang Long bragging.”

“Big shots always keep a low profile!” But at this moment, Sun Ying and Chen Xin already believed that Qin Yu had a powerful background. No matter what Qin Yu said, they wouldn’t believe it.

Qin Yu didn’t bother to explain to them. Instead, he walked to the Water Dragon Cave hot spring and squatted down.

He reached out his hand to scoop a small handful of water from the hot spring and drank it. Then, he exclaimed, “It’s just as I guessed!”

The hot spring was filled with spiritual energy. Although it wasn’t rich enough, it was enough to prove Qin Yu’s idea!

“This is probably the reason why the Water Dragon Cave is famous.” Qin Yu stood up while feeling a little excited.

There were more and more people at the scene. Yao Qing kept looking around.

Most of the famous people in South City were invited in. Other than that, some big shots in the martial arts world of Chuzhou were also invited.

“I didn’t expect him to come.” At this moment, Yao Qing looked at a young man at the door and said.

Qin Yu looked over and asked casually, “Who is he?”

Yao Qing quickly replied, “Wei Ming, from the provincial capital. He is known as one of the top three young men in the martial arts world of the provincial capital. He was good friends with Shen Tian.”

Qin Yu sized up Wei Ming, rubbed his chin and muttered, “Top three? How does he compare to Liu Shihui?”

“This... I don’t know either, but I think Wei Ming should be better,” Yao Qing said.

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything more.

Other than these people, there were also people from all walks of life in South City.

Among them were the gangsters in the underground world of South City, big shots in the business world, big shots in the literary and art world, and so on.

Most of these people stood beside Liu Shihui and chatted enthusiastically with him.

“Young Master Liu, I’ll leave this kid to you.” Wei Ming sat beside Liu Shihui and said with a smile.

Liu Shihui said with a smile, “Wei Ming, treat it as revenge for you, haha!”

“Then thank you very much, Young Master Liu.” Wei Ming said with a nonchalant smile.

After saying that, Wei Ming looked coldly at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu, who was standing a short distance away, quickly felt a murderous aura approaching him!

Qin Yu frowned slightly and immediately looked at Wei Ming.

“Mr. Qin, Wei Ming is very hostile towards you. You’d better be careful.” Yao Qing also perceived this murderous aura.

Qin Yu ignored Yao Qing’s words and looked coldly at Wei Ming.

In the next second, Qin Yu actually took the initiative to walk towards Wei Ming!

“Mr. Qin!” Seeing this, Yao Qing hurriedly followed.

Very soon, Qin Yu came to Wei Ming’s side directly.

Qin Yu’s arrival immediately attracted countless gazes. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

All the celebrities present couldn’t help but look over.

“He’s Qin Yu? He looks ordinary.”

“I heard that he’s a gigolo taken care of by the heiress of the Yan family.”

“No wonder. With the Yan family around, he does have the right to be arrogant.”

Wei Ming sized up Qin Yu from head to toe. Then, he suddenly looked at Yao Qing.

“Aren’t you the lackey by Shen Tian’s side? What? You betrayed him just like that?” Wei Ming said with some amusement.

Yao Qing gritted his teeth and said, “Mr. Wei, you misunderstood. I...”

“There’s no need to explain,” Wei Ming interrupted Yao Qing.

“No one cares where a lap dog goes anyway,” Wei Ming said indifferently.

Yao Qing’s expression changed, and he couldn’t help but clench his fists.

He had been in the Shen family for many years and had never been treated as a human. This was the truth.

“You and Shen Tian are friends?” At this moment, Qin Yu spoke.

Wei Ming looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Since you know, you still dared to come and find me?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “You want to kill me?”

Wei Ming was stunned. He never thought that Qin Yu would ask such a question!

“Do you want to kill me?” Qin Yu repeated.

Wei Ming snorted coldly and said, “That’s right. It’s because of you that Shen Tian died!”

“Oh.” Qin Yu nodded.

Then, Qin Yu pointed to Liu Shihui and said indifferently, “In that case, the two of you can attack together.”

When he said this, everyone was shocked!

Qin Yu was a bit too arrogant!

One had to know that these two were both top-notch in the martial arts world of Chuzhou! No one dared to say such a thing!

Liu Shihui even laughed out loud.

“Qin Yu, I can sense that your strength has increased, but you are only at the ninth stage of Inner Strength.” Liu Shihui sneered.

“You’re merely at the ninth stage of Inner Strength, but you dare to be so arrogant? I will kill you as easily as squashing an ant!” Wei Ming said coldly.
