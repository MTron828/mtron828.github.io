Chapter 2807: Escape from the Investiture of Gods

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi- Bo Studio

His body started to tremble violently. It was the scene of a person in despair suddenly seeing a glimmer of hope.

With a thought from Qin Yu, a black crack had already appeared in front of him.

This was the best time to escape!

Qin Yu made a prompt decision and wanted to escape!

“No! You can only leave a trace of power. Your internal qi has already been sealed and you can never escape! If you attract the giant’s attention, you’ll probably not have any chance in the future!”

Smoker Xie shouted anxiously. His voice was trembling. He was afraid that Qin Yu would abandon everything and leave this place when he saw this rare hope. At that time, he would lose even his only hope.

Qin Yu hesitated for a long time. In the end, he separated a bit of divine sense from his body and left the space.

“Pay more attention to the changes in the Investiture of Gods. If you notice anything wrong, your divine sense must return to this space. Otherwise, you will be discovered!”

Smoker Xie’s last words fell and then completely disappeared.

The world spun. Qin Yu didn’t know how long he had been shuttling through the rugged void space before his divine sense returned.

In the small house in the forest, the stream flowed gracefully.

Fatty Situ, Chang Mang, and the holy daughter sat beside him with tired expressions.

Seeing Qin Yu wake up again, they revealed looks as if they had seen a ghost.

“Will it work?”

Chang Mang glared at Qin Yu.

The dislocated bones caused a trace of extreme pain. During the past few days of being beaten up, he had already developed a sense of fear towards Qin Yu.

Not only him, but Fatty Situ was the same.

He was immersed in the pain of his family’s destruction at first. Coincidentally, Qin Yu’s beating had also made him lose the strength to emo.

‘Why are you looking at me? This is the second time I’ve touched this thing. How would I know if it’s effective?”

Fatty Situ almost cried.

“The two of you, stop arguing! Prepare to suppress Qin Yu again. However, I don’t allow you to hurt him.”

Meng Jing said with a frown.

“Sister, do you feel guilty when you say this? You didn’t see our pig-like faces, did you? What do you mean you won’t allow us to hurt him? Are you speaking like a human?”

Chang Mang was furious.

“Thank you, everyone.”

Listening to that familiar voice, Qin Yu had the illusion that he had returned to the world.

It had been a long time since he had felt this body, or perhaps it could be said that he was no longer the one controlling this body. The few words he had left for Chang Mang and the others were only conveyed through his full strength.

Although only a trace of his will came out of the Investiture of Gods at this moment, this feeling made Qin Yu feel as if he had been electrocuted. He felt the air flowing through his skin and the soreness in his muscles.

“Fatty Situ, did you give me the Investiture of Gods?”

Qin Yu asked directly.

Qin Yu felt nothing else could allow him to escape from the space other than this incomplete Investiture of Gods.

“Yes. After the Situ family obtained this item, the four Holy Lords immediately attacked. This incomplete version is no longer useful to me.”

Fatty Situ’s face was a little gloomy.

Situ Qianxun had received his life-and-death battle, but he had given him a chance to live with the power of the Investiture of Gods.

During the final battle with the three Saints, Situ Qianxun had sent this item out of the Treasure Continent along with them.

After that, they traveled at full speed and finally arrived at the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

The holy daughter told Qin Yu everything that had happened.

Only then did he understand that so many shocking things had happened after he entered the Investiture of God’s space.

“I didn’t expect the incomplete Investiture of Gods would cause such a huge sensation.”

Qin Yu was silent for a long time before speaking. There was too much information and he fell into a short contemplation.

“Situ Qianxun could use the power he deduced to fight against two people in a short period, and he could even hold his ground. This shows how terrifying the power of the Investiture of Gods is. No wonder it could attract the four Holy Lords to attack. If the Investiture of Gods of Nine Nether Cliff didn’t leak any internal qi, I’m afraid it would cause a huge commotion in the Dao Mystical

Saint Kingdom.”

Meng Jing shook her head. Her condition was much better now.

Previously, Divine Doctor Lu had used all his strength to treat her in the Treasure Continent.

His peak power was also a heaven-defying ability that could allow death and bones to regenerate. Coupled with the Situ family’s treasures, her injuries had almost recovered.

Even some of the hidden injuries from the previous battle were completely healed.

However, she could not do anything about the effects of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom’s loss of cosmic luck. As a result, her current strength had decreased by about 30% and she was no longer at the Holy Consciousness Realm. “Has a Holy Lord descended upon the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom?”

Qin Yu immediately understood a lot of information from the holy daughter’s words.

Other than the Situ family, the Alester family, the number one kulapati, and Zi Yan also obtained the remnant pages.

There was only one place left if they wanted to protect the Investiture of Godsthe Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

Firstly, there was no Holy Lord in this Saint Kingdom. Secondly, once other Holy Lords entered this place, they would be suppressed by the internal qi here.

This was the born-into suppression, so this place would be in chaos.

It was possible that other Holy Lords would descend personally. At that time, it would be a disaster for them.

“There’s no clear news for now, but no one will give up this energy so easily.

My father said that this might be his only hope of breaking through in his life. If the four Holy Lords hadn’t descended, I’m afraid he would have killed me.”

Fatty Situ hesitated for a moment before saying.

Although the truth was cruel, he still had to face it.

“Qin Yu, have you recovered? Can the effects of the previous apotheosis be offset now?”

Chang Mang asked curiously.

“My divine soul is still in the Investiture of Gods. What came out now is only a wisp of will. If I force it out, I’m afraid it will attract the attention of a certain giant.”

Qin Yu had a headache.

The little boy who created the Investiture of Gods was now under the giant’s control that he created.

Smoker Xie told him that his current strength was like an ant in the Investiture of Gods, so he would not attract the attention of that existence.

However, it would set off a warning line once his power broke through a

certain level. At that time, his thoughts would probably be controlled. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Even though he did not cultivate after that, the increase in his strength almost made his hair stand on end.

This also proved how terrifying this Investiture of Gods was. Then, how could he break out of this situation now?

Seeing that Qin Yu was deep in thought, they did not disturb him although they were a little confused,

After a few days, Qin Yu still did not find any way to crack it..
