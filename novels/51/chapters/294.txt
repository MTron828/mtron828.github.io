Chapter 295: Suppression of Cultivation Realm! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s initiative to attack had exceeded Chi Feng’s expectations.

He sneered and slowly raised his palm to meet it.

Chi Feng was full of confidence!

Furthermore, his strength was far above Qin Yu’s!

However, when his fist approached, Chi Feng’s expression suddenly changed!

Did this terrifying killing power really come from a peak Inner Strength Master Hands?

“Oh no!” Chi Feng’s expression changed. He wanted to retreat, but it was already too late!

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!” Qin Yu roared again and again. His fist smashed towards Chi Feng with a crushing force!

A terrifying internal qi instantly swept through the entire area. In an instant, sand and stones flew everywhere!

Under this punch, Chi Feng felt his wrist go numb and it was almost broken!

He took several steps back, and a flash of anger appeared on his face!

“You can actually hurt me?! How dare you hurt me?!” Chi Feng shouted angrily.

However, Qin Yu’s expression was solemn.

He didn’t expect that even the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist could only break Chi Feng’s wrist.

The gap between realms was indeed difficult to make up for.

“Go to h*ll!” Chi Feng roared, and his entire body exploded with energy!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He knew very well that he had no other choice but to fight with his physical body!

Thus, Qin Yu quickly closed in on him and swung his fist!

Chi Feng’s spell was interrupted, so he could only choose to fight Qin Yu in close combat!

Clanging sounds kept ringing in his ears, and the sky flickered with a golden light!

The strength of an eighth-level Inner Strength Grandmaster was beyond imagination. Even if he relied on his physical body, Qin Yu wouldn’t be able to gain too much of an advantage!

What’s more, Chi Feng also learned the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist technique!

“Boom!”

They exchanged punches again! The whole place seemed to have exploded!

Chi Feng felt his fist go numb, and his thumb almost cracked.

“No way.” Chi Feng frowned.

“This kid’s body is too tough. I can’t use my weakness to fight against his strength.”

At this thought, Chi Feng immediately used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique!

As long as he could pull away, killing Qin Yu wouldn’t be a problem at all!

However, what Chi Feng didn’t expect was that Qin Yu’s speed wasn’t slower than his! It was simply difficult to pull apart the distance between the two parties !

“Old b*stard, you actually passed the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique to an outsider!” Chi Feng immediately flew into a rage and roared at Gu Taichu repeatedly!

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and followed closely behind!

His fist flickered with a brilliant light and a terrifying power.

“Chasing after me?” Chi Feng sneered.

“You’re just an Inner Strength Master Hands. I want to see how long your inner strength can last you!”

Chi Feng wasn’t stupid. The Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique consumed a lot of inner strength! Qin Yu couldn’t last long at all!

Just as Chi Feng said, if he continued to chase, Qin Yu’s spiritual power would soon be exhausted.

At that time, Qin Yu would become a lamb at the mercy of others!

Just as Chi Feng was feeling pleased with himself, he suddenly felt that his speed had slowed down!

His entire body was as heavy as a mountain!

“Huh? How could this be?” Chi Feng’s expression couldn’t help but change drastically!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s fist had already arrived in front of him!

“Boom!”

This fist smashed firmly onto Chi Feng’s back!

However, before he could land on the ground, Qin Yu took another step forward and swung another punch at him!

“What... What’s going on now?!” Chi Feng couldn’t help but roar crazily!

It was as if his body was pulled by a pair of giant hands. Even if he used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, his speed would be several times slower!

Qin Yu sneered. “This spell is called Heavy Falling Space. As long as you are in this space, your speed will be several times slower.”

“Even if you can use the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, you still can’t escape!” Qin Yu said coldly.

At this time, in order to deal with the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, Qin Yu specially learned this spell! The purpose was to deal with Chi Feng!

Chi Feng was extremely furious. He waved his fists crazily towards Qin Yu!

However, Qin Yu’s figure was extremely agile. Every punch was easily dodged by Qin Yu!

“Bang!”

Punch after punch continuously smashed onto Chi Feng’s body!

This was pure physical strength! It wasn’t mixed with any spells!

“D*mn it! D*mn it!” Chi Feng was in extreme pain! His body felt as if it was in a swamp, and his movements were greatly restricted!

Despite seeing Qin Yu’s fist smashing onto his body, Chi Feng was completely helpless!

“Phew!”

Finally, when Qin Yu threw out the thirteenth punch, Chi Feng couldn’t hold it in any longer and spat out a mouthful of blood!

Gu Taichu’s eyes shone with a strange light and his face was filled with shock!

He had never thought that Qin Yu would be able to chase after Chi Feng and beat him up!

“Qin Yu, I’m going to kill you!” Chi Feng roared crazily!

But he got punched yet again!

This punch landed on Chi Feng’s mouth and directly shattered one of his back teeth!

“I have to get rid of Chi Feng as soon as possible.” Qin Yu panted heavily, and his face was covered with layers of sweat.

Whether it was the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique or the Heavy Falling Space technique, it consumed a lot of spiritual power!

With Qin Yu’s current realm, he could only last for five minutes at most!

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t dare to use the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

If the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist couldn’t defeat Chi Feng, then all the people present today would probably die in Chi Feng’s hands!

“Go to h*ll!” Qin Yu’s eyes revealed madness. Spiritual power surged from his entire body and smashed toward Chi Feng!

“Enough!” Chi Feng raised his head and roared, as if he had gone mad!

His surging inner strength instantly burst out from his body!

And the Heavy Falling Space that Qin Yu had used was actually shattered in an instant!

“Oh no!” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

The gap between their realms was too big, and the Heavy Falling Space was actually shattered!

“Go to h*ll!” Chi Feng roared, and a dragon head condensed on his fist!

A terrifying murderous aura spread out in an instant!

If one listened carefully, one could even hear a hint of a dragon’s roar!

“Boom!”

Chi Feng took the opportunity to grab Qin Yu. Then, he ruthlessly punched him!

The entire space seemed to tremble at this instant!

Endless light enveloped a large area of the sky!

Qin Yu was like a meteorite as he ruthlessly smashed onto the ground!

His entire body was on the verge of shattering, and the Saintly Body Technique also disappeared at this instant!

“Qin Yu!” Gu Taichu hurriedly stepped forward and came to Qin Yu’s side!

“Qin Yu, you... how do you feel?” Gu Taichu said anxiously.

Qin Yu supported Gu Taichu and stood up from the ground with great difficulty.

Under this punch, Qin Yu’s body was severely injured!

What was even worse was that Qin Yu’s spiritual power had been exhausted, and he was unable to use any technique!

“Master Gu, I’m fine...” Qin Yu waved his hand with difficulty.

“Hehe, you didn’t die after taking this punch. Your body is quite interesting,” Chi Feng said with narrowed eyes.

Qin Yu looked at Chi Feng with a serious expression. He tried to retreat, but as soon as his body moved, pain came from everywhere!

“What about another punch?” Chi Feng grinned and sneered.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
