Chapter 2738: The Fourth Form of the Tombstone

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Drip.

Drops of blood slowly dripped down from the scythe, but it did not fall to the ground.

Instead, it floated in the air and slowly sank into his chest.

A searing pain came from that position. Qin Yu felt the bones in his chest twist.

The mark in that position changed again. This time, it became a tombstone.

This tombstone seemed to look a little like the tombstone carried by Heavenly Sin.

“Uncle Dagger, you’ve finally come out. You’ve devoured my Saint Crystals.”

Qin Yu looked at the Saint Crystals that had turned into ordinary stones. He almost cried.

These were the highest-grade Saint Crystals that the Starry Sandworm had condensed after devouring the Endless Mine. He hadn’t lost much Saint Crystals after cultivating for so long.

However, Sir Dagger devoured all of the fist-sized Saint Crystals as soon as it appeared.

“You survived in Heavenly Sin’s hands and even obtained the fourth mark. Are you still trying to act pitiful?”

“Ouch!”

Qin Yu cried out miserably. His divine soul seemed to have been pinched heavily.

This sudden pain made his snot bubble.

“Sir, what was that thing with the tombstone on its back just now?”

The image of that great battle replayed in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Even the details, including his split souls that entered the depths of everyone’s consciousness, were not taken into consideration.

Everything was clear and there was no falsehood.

This was because Chang Mang, Ruoxue, Jue Wu, Flower Granny, and the others couldnt fabricate these things in the depths of their consciousness.

“Haha! if I hadn’t swallowed a bit of energy, I probably wouldn’t have remembered.”

Sir Dagger laughed.

A little bit of energy…

Qin Yu was speechless.

“The Tomb of Heavenly Sins is a will that reaches the heavens. This will was formed by the strong resentment of many cultivators at that time. The tomb absorbed the internal qi of countless sinners. It will only disappear when all the sinners are dead.”

“Why is there such a terrifying resentment?”

Qin Yu did not quite understand.

“At that time, the Supreme of Divine Lane was at its peak. The Human race was strong and the Eight Great Immortal Emperors had their style. After the peak period, some people discovered that the energy between heaven and earth was constantly decreasing. Whether it was the lower realm, the saint world, the divine realm, or even the Immortal Emperors could not absorb enough energy. Under such an environment, the Human race attacked the heavens, but they suffered a crushing defeat in the end. The Guardians, the four Immortal Emperors, and the cultivators of the various alien races suddenly betrayed us.”

Qin Yu was slightly silent when he heard this. He seemed to be able to see the despair of those who had suffered a crushing defeat.

Sir Dagger’s tone did not fluctuate at all. He spoke so tirelessly, but Qin Yu could imagine the mountains of corpses and seas of blood at that time.

“This towering resentment became a heavenly sin. What you saw this time was just a weak will.”

“What is the connection between the Tomb of Heavenly Sins and that figure just now?”

Qin Yu was not clear about the connection between the two.

“The Tomb of Heavenly Sins is a land of spiritual ruins formed by immense resentment. The white-robed Heavenly Sin you saw was only one of the clones. Otherwise, do you think you can survive?”

Sir Dagger said lazily. “Then how did they know about Ruoxue’s memories?”

Qin Yu asked anxiously.

“This is a heaven-reaching will. As long as you exist, you can’t leave its deduction. No one in this world of saints can resist it. Moreover, I felt that they were real. A powerful magic power absorbed their divine souls. If you had made the wrong choice just now, they would have died! The reason why it’s those people was perhaps they’re all in this Saint Kingdom.”

After Sir Dagger finished speaking, Qin Yu felt that it was unbelievable.

In other words, those people just now were the divine thoughts of people he knew. Using this kind of power to plunder the divine souls, what kind of heaven -defying method was this?

“If Heavenly Sin is so powerful, why didn’t it just kill me?”

Qin Yu was a little puzzled. He felt that everything that had happened before seemed to be unnecessary.

A heaven-defying technique that could directly absorb a divine soul. He had no way of resisting this kind of power.

“I don’t know.”

Sir Dagger said lazily.

“You must know that it also has enemies. Even such an invincible existence has its fears. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have set up rules and could kill you directly. Perhaps it also has to follow some orders. ” “Alright, I’m going to sleep.”

“Who are you? Why are you on me?”

Qin Yu asked softly. He was very curious about Sir Dagger.

This dagger had followed him back to the Dao Mystical Saint Divine Kingdom from the Land of Gods and Devils, but he still did not know its identity.

“I don’t know. I’ve forgotten a lot of things too. You can only find out for yourself. I’m too lazy to think about it.”

Sir Dagger said angrily.

“And you have the fourth mark of the Heavenly Sin on your body. This thing should be of some use. The specific answer should be in the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. However, that place seems a little strange. It should be dangerous for you to go there with your strength.”

Dagger seemed to hesitate as if it had remembered something.

“Then you can just make a move when the time comes.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said.

“Who do you think I am? I won’t disappear even if you die. It’ll prove that I’m going to find someone else. If you didn’t pass the third form’s test, I wouldn’t have appeared.”

Sir Dagger yawned, disregarding Qin Yu’s words. “But there’s good news. My second form has been unsealed, so you can use it.”

After saying that, Sir Dagger did not respond anymore.

“No way! Brother, I still have so many questions!”

Qin Yu felt like crying.

It seemed that he still had to find the old man to solve this mystery.

The old man should have also entered the second form of the mark or even more, which was why he said those words to Qin Yu.

This kind of transformation was almost as difficult as hell. If he hadn’t received a warning from Chen Shuang’s friend, he would have casually confirmed someone just now.

Just like how he chose Yan Ruoxue, Heavenly Sin could kill him directly if he made the wrong choice.

He had used his greatest trump card, the power of the night and the power given by the dream to injure Heavenly Sin. That was how he obtained the third form.

If Sir Dagger didn’t appear, he would have been turned into dust.

This was Heavenly Sin!

Qin Yu touched the tombstone on his chest. At this moment, the slightly undulating outline gave him a faint illusion. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was not a dead object, but a living person filled with extreme anger.

Qin Yu felt a headache coming on. Sir Dagger’s words made him even more puzzled.

“Looks like I have to make a trip there if I want to find out the secret..”
