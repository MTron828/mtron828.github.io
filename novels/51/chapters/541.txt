Chapter 542: The Aristocratic Families Are Furious! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Jiang He’s tone was calm, but it was filled with dominance!

The two Martial Marquises faced eleven Martial Marquises, and for a moment, the situation was at a stalemate.

“Everyone says that Jiang He is unrivalled in the world. To be honest, I’ve always wanted to fight against you.” Martial Marquis Bai took the lead and took a step forward.

He rubbed his fist and said indifferently, “Jiang He, you should know that there are still many unknowns in this world.”

“You’re indeed very strong, but you’re not invincible. There are always people better than you. Moreover, there are Martial Saints in this world.”

Martial Marquis Bai’s words shocked everyone!

There were actually Martial Saints in this world? After all, a Martial Saint hadn’t appeared for many years!

Jiang He nodded and said, “You are right. I’m not invincible, and there is indeed a Martial Saint in this world.”

“However, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to deal with you guys.”

Martial Marquis Bai’s expression turned cold as he shouted, “I have stepped into the third rank Martial Marquis realm a few years ago! Today, I will see how powerful you are!”

After he finished speaking, Martial Marquis Bai took a step forward. Countless rays of light gathered between his hands!

In the next second, Martial Marquis Bai shouted loudly. He charged towards Jiang He with surging power!

Jiang He put his hands behind his back and his expression was calm.

He raised his skinny palm, and Martial Marquis Bai’s body flew out as soon as he got close!

A big hole appeared in his body, and he fell to the ground without any movement!

The venue was instantly silent.

He killed a Martial Marquis with one slap? What kind of powerful strength was that?!

Everyone’s expressions were ugly!

After so many years, Jiang He’s strength seemed to have increased again!

“Don’t worry, he’s not dead, but he won’t wake up in a short period of time.” Jiang He said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

“If anyone still wants to make a move, I’ll wait for you here.” Jiang He swept his gaze towards everyone present.

The venue was completely silent. No one dared to say a single word.

“Jiang He, aren’t you going too far?!” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“Do you really think that the Yan family can’t do anything to you?”

Jiang He glanced at Yan Sihai and said, “You can ask a Martial Saint to kill me, but I must take him away today.”

“You!” Yan Sihai gritted his teeth.

Obviously, no one present could stop Jiang He!

Jiang He didn’t speak anymore when he saw the situation.

He bent down and looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s consciousness was already somewhat blurry, but he still held on.

“Mr. Jiang He... can you help me take Ruoxue away...” Qin Yu said with difficulty.

Before Jiang He could answer, the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association took a step forward and said, “Jiang He, we want to take Yan Ruoxue back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“How dare you?!” Qin Yu’s eyes immediately widened!

He tried to get up, but he found that he couldn’t move at all.

“This is the decision of our superiors. We hope that Mr. Jiang He won’t stop us,” the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association continued.

As they spoke, they took out a document.

As expected, this document stated that they wanted to bring Yan Ruoxue to the Martial Arts Association, but it didn’t specify the reason.

Jiang He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “This is your own matter. I can’t help you.”

Qin Yu was speechless for a moment.

Yes, this was his own matter. Jiang He helping him was already a huge favor.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association... you’d better not try to do anything to Ruoxue...” Qin Yu said through gritted teeth.

“Otherwise, I will definitely destroy you guys!”

The people of Jingdu Martial Arts Association ignored Qin Yu and only looked at Jiang He.

“Take care of yourself first,” the Pavilion Master whispered.

Qin Yu wanted to say something, but he found that he couldn’t say anything.

His vision became darker and darker. Finally, Qin Yu blacked out.

“Let’s go.” Jiang He looked at the Pavilion Master.

The Pavilion Master nodded. The two of them took Qin Yu and left the venue in front of everyone.

When they reached the door, the Pavilion Master suddenly stopped in her tracks.

She glanced at Yan Sihai and said, “President Yan, I have a piece of advice for you. If you stop now, it’s still not too late. If you continue, you will be doomed.”

“When Qin Yu becomes more powerful, there will be unprecedented disaster for the Yan family.”

Yan Sihai said coldly, “Don’t worry about it. I want to see how Qin Yu will bring disaster to the Yan family.”

“It’s almost time. There’s no need to rush,” the Pavilion Master said coldly.

After that, she didn’t stay any longer and left with Qin Yu.

No one could have imagined that a wedding would end like this.

Even though Qin Yu didn’t manage to take Yan Ruoxue away, he defeated the Yan family this time and made the two great families suffer humiliation!

“D*mn it!” Yan Sihai’s expression was ashen, and the muscles on his face kept trembling.

This time, the Yan family would definitely suffer humiliation! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Son!” Han Meng ran in front of Han Wei.

“Take my son to the hospital!” He shouted.

A few people rushed forward before carrying Han Wei and leaving the place.

Xia Hang looked at the venue in front of him, and the killing intent in his eyes deepened.

“President Yan, we must kill Qin Yu as soon as possible,” Xia Hang said.

“At the same time, I will also inform the higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association about this matter.”

Yan Sihai ignored these words and said coldly, “Xia Hang, is this the disciple you nurtured?”

Xia Hang explained, “President Yan, don’t underestimate Qin Yu. He...”

“Don’t find excuses for your failure,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Xia Hang gritted his teeth and said, “President Yan, after Qin Yu recovers, he will definitely come back to the Yan family! He definitely won’t give up on Yan Ruoxue!”

“Okay!” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“I want to see how he can take Yan Ruoxue away!”

“President Yan, we will take Miss Yan away for now,” a few Martial Marquises of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association came forward and said.

Yan Sihai snorted and said, “Take her away for what? Why? Do you want to protect her?”

“This is a document from the higher-ups. We are only responsible for carrying it out. I hope you can understand,” said the few people.

Although Yan Sihai was a bit unhappy, he didn’t say anything.

He waved his hand and didn’t say anything else.

On the other side, the Pavilion Master and Jiang He left Jingdu with Qin Yu.

On the way, the Pavilion Master said in a deep voice, “When Qin Yu wakes up, he will definitely go to the Yan family to ask for her.”

Jiang He glanced at the Pavilion Master and said slowly, “Actually, there’s no need to be anxious.”

“You and I have seen Qin Yu’s performance today.”

“He used a secret technique to forcefully enter the realm of the Martial Marquis. No one present could stop him.”

“If he really entered the realm of Martial Marquis, who could stop him then? Even the Yan family would have to think twice.”
