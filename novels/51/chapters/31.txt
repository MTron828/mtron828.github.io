Needless to say, Shen Tian already knew that it was an ordinary ginseng root. To him, there was no difference between a century-old ginseng root and a normal one. He believed it was all a mass marketing fraud.

With this mindset, he went to a random herbal pharmacy, purchased a regular ginseng root, and then kept it in an exquisite box.

It never crossed his mind that Qin Yu would reveal his trick.

”W-what nonsense are you babbling about?” Shen Tian stammered in panic.

”Miss Yan, please don’t listen to him. He’s trying to defame me,” Shen Tian defended himself as he turned to look at Yan Ruoxue.

Upon seeing that, Yan Ruoxue heaved a long sigh. She looked disappointed while holding the ginseng root in her hand.

At that, Shen Tian wiped off his sweat and tried to redeem himself, “Miss Yan, I really didn’t know that it was fake. P-please, let me explain...”

Disregarding Shen Tian, Yan Ruoxue turned to Qin Yu and said, “Well, I guess I should throw it away then.”

Yan Ruoxue threw the ginseng root into the trash can.

”Being poor is not a problem. The problem arises when you try to pass a counterfeit item as genuine. The mere thought of it is revolting,” Yan Ruoxue criticized.

Shen Tian was rooted to the ground as his face reddened.

His shoulders were quivering. It was unclear whether the tremble was due to anger or humiliation.

Looking at Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu flashed a smile on his face.

Shen Tian gave Qin Yu a death glare, as if he would swallow the latter like a python.

”I need to tend to a few things. Please make yourself comfortable,” Yan Ruoxue said suddenly.

She then went up to the second floor, her secretary following closely behind.

There was a surveillance room on the second floor.

Yan Ruoxue was sitting before the monitors that played the live feed from the surveillance cameras. She was eager to see how the scene would play out downstairs.

”Miss Yan, t-there’s something that I don’t understand.” The secretary was confused.

”Don’t you think that you were being a little too merciless toward Shen Tian?” the secretary questioned in an upset tone.

Yan Ruoxue’s smile only broadened.

She raised her head, stared at her secretary, and clarified, “Do you seriously think that Shen Tian likes me? People of his caliber don’t usually like someone as an individual, but are rather in love with their family.”

The secretary furrowed his brows and queried, “I know that you favor Qin Yu. But why are you making enemies for him? This will only cause more conflict between Qin Yu and Shen Tian.”

Yan Ruoxue took a sip of tea and replied, “As I mentioned, Shen Tian is nothing but a stepping-stone for Qin Yu’s growth. That’s all there is to it.”

Shen Tian would have gone mad if he heard Yan Ruoxue’s words.

...

On the first floor, Shen Tian gave Qin Yu a dark look.

He stopped putting up an act and revealed his true, hideous self.

”Qin Yu, you are really something else, I’ll give you that. To think that you succeeded in winning the heart of Jingdu’s famous ice queen,” Shen Tian commented.

Qin Yu let out a laugh and mocked, “I’m nothing like you. I do not pull any tricks, unlike you. I’ve been treating her with sincerity. That’s it.”

Shen Tian snorted, “Qin Yu, please stop flattering yourself. You are not that noble. You are only getting close to Yan Ruoxue for her wealth and status. How does it feel like to live off a woman?”

”For her wealth and status?” Qin Yu raised his brows before replying sharply.

”Shen Tian, you are stealing my line. As far as I know, your family is not on the same level as her family. Tell me, why are you acting so ingratiating towards the Yan family?”

Shen Tian immediately scowled at Qin Yu after hearing the latter’s remarks. Shen Tian took a step forward and bellowed, “Qin Yu, you are just a commoner in my eyes! A vermin that I could easily destroy with a mere trample! Without the backing of the Yan family, you are nothing!”

”Who are you without the Shen family’s financial support?” Qin Yu asked.

Shen Tian chortled, “Listen carefully, Qin Yu! I was a gifted child at a very young age! My father sent me to the Chuzhou Region for training when I was eight! At age 14, I was sent overseas to further my studies! At age 21, I’ve already owned—”

”Alright. That’s enough,” Qin Yu interrupted Shen Tian’s words.

”Quit flaunting your inconsequential achievements! I’m tired of listening!” Qin Yu wagged his hand.

”Why, you little!” Shen Tian flushed with rage.

Gritting his teeth, he warned, “Hey dork, you would be better off staying away from Miss Yan! I swear you will suffer the consequences of my wrath if you get any closer!”

Qin Yu riposted, “I’m looking forward to it.”

Yan Ruoxue witnessed the entire exchange on the second floor.

A faint smile played on her lips as she pondered about what had happened.

...

Qin Yu headed straight home after leaving the Yan family’s manor.

There were about twenty Soul Nourishment Pills at his abode. After some consideration, Qin Yu decided to pass these pills to Lei Hu and let him sell them. It was something that could benefit the man.

With that, Qin Yu made a phone call to Lei Hu.

Around half an hour later, Lei Hu’s car came to a stop in front of the villa’s main door.

Lance had followed Lei Hu to Qin Yu’s residence.

”Mr. Qin, how may I help you?” Lei Hu asked, trying to curry favor with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu crooked his fingers towards the pills on the table and explained, “This pill is called the Soul Nourishing Pill. It basically strengthens and nourishes our bodies. There are only twenty of them in the market. Yes, they are all here.”

Glancing at the black pills on the table, Lei Hu could not figure out what Qin Yu was trying to imply at that moment.

Qin Yu continued, “Take these pills with you and sell them. Hmm. I’ll collect only fifty thousand per pill from you. There is no price ceiling for this product, so you can decide how much you want to mark up the price.”

The real value of the Soul Nourishment Pill undoubtedly exceeded fifty thousand each. Qin Yu sold them at such an affordable price so that Lei Hu could make a windfall for himself.

However, Lei Hu had a grumpy look on his face as he thought.

What? He is asking for fifty thousand dollars for one random black pill? Isn’t this daylight robbery?

”Mr. Qin. isn’t fifty thousand... Slightly overpriced?” Lei Hu asked tentatively.

Shooting him a look, Qin Yu remarked, “Mr. Lei, this is a good deal for you.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lei Hu’s expression immediately changed, as if an epiphany occurred to him.

Despite being reluctant, he paid the money for it without making a fuss.

For twenty pills, he paid a total of ten million in cash.

After getting into the car, Lei Hu lambasted, “I never expected Qin Yu to be such an unscrupulous person! What are these stupid pills, anyway? Is he crazy? Why is he selling these things for fifty thousand each?”

Lance frowned and asked, “Brother Hu, why did you agree to it?”

Lei Hu snorted, “You have no idea. These pills are just a facade. His real motive is to leech off me. It’s a common tactic used by big shots.”

Upon realization, Lance mumbled, “Did Qin Yu think that he is invincible now that he has the Yan family backing him?”

Lei Hu heaved a long sigh. “Men like us must keep a good rapport with people from all walks of life. Otherwise, things can get out of hand anytime.”

He might look glamorous on the outside, but Lei Hu was constantly living life on a tightrope.

”Brother Hu, should we throw these pills away? ” Lance questioned.

Lei Hu took a pill and put it inside his mouth. Then he snorted, “We will look for some suckers and make them buy these things from us, just like what Qin Yu did to us.”

Similar to how Lei Hu did not dare to reject Qin Yu, there were people who did not dare to refuse him either.

To Lei Hu, this was just how hierarchy works.
