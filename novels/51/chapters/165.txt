Chapter 166: Mr. Wu’s Request Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This ray of light was lingering around his body, and it was getting stronger and stronger.

Qin Yu was completely unaware of it. He only felt that his entire body was extremely hot, as if he was about to explode. Layers of sweat were seeping from his forehead!

“Buzz!”

An hour later, the surrounding golden light began to gather around Qin Yu!

All the light gathered on Qin Yu’s body and finally fused with his skin.

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes!

He lowered his head and looked at his skin. For some reason, it seemed that the pores on his skin had become smaller.

Moreover... There was a faint dark golden color on his body. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

The Foundation Establishment Stage was the foundation of cultivation, and also the beginning of the true path of cultivation.

Rumor had it that everyone’s potential would begin to appear at the Foundation Establishment Stage.

At this moment, Qin Yu had a strong feeling that his physical body had hardened immensely!

When he looked at the faint dark gold color, this feeling was even stronger.

Qin Yu stood up, grabbed the fruit knife beside him, and stabbed it into his arm fiercely!

“Clang!”

The sound of metal colliding instantly sounded!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s arm didn’t even have a scratch on it. There was only a white mark left on it.

“My physical body... is indeed much stronger,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

This made him excited. As long as his physical body was strong enough, his strength would naturally soar!

Otherwise, Cross-training Masters wouldn’t be so powerful!

“With this body and the augmentation of the Saintly Body Technique, there’s no telling how strong my body will be,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The only thing that made Qin Yu unhappy was that the eight Foundation Establishment Pills had only increased his level by one rank.

Normally, the eight Foundation Establishment Pills would help one advance by at least two ranks.

“If this goes on, I don’t know how many herbs need to be consumed in the future.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but force a smile.

At this time, it was almost dawn, and Mr. Yang was sleeping. Therefore, Qin Yu quietly pushed open the door and left the hotel.

Qin Yu drove to a park nearby.

The park was full of trees. Qin Yu clenched his fist and suddenly smashed it into a big tree!

The big tree suddenly collapsed!

The surrounding old men who were doing morning exercises were all dumbfounded. How could such a thick tree suddenly collapse?

Qin Yu was a little embarrassed. He didn’t dare to stay any longer and turned around to leave.

On the way back, Qin Yu whispered, “This is too ridiculous. I only used less than 10% of my strength...”

He didn’t want to destroy public property, but he had too much power.

“I have to find an opportunity to compensate them,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

On the way home, Qin Yu suddenly received a phone call.

He picked up the phone and saw that it was Mr. Wu calling.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Because of the previous conflict, Qin Yu didn’t have a good impression of Mr. Wu.

But after thinking for a moment, Qin Yu picked up the phone.

“Mr. Wu, is there something you want to talk to me about?” Qin Yu asked directly.

On the other end, Mr. Wu smiled and said, “Qin Yu, you have been in the limelight recently.”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “Mr. Wu, don’t make fun of me. I’m just a good-for-nothing, so how can I be in the limelight?”

He obviously meant to mock Mr. Wu. On the other end, Mr. Wu laughed wryly and said, “Alright, are you still holding a grudge? I was in the wrong to look down on you, so I’m here to apologize to you.”

Qin Yu wasn’t an unreasonable person. Since Mr. Wu had said this, if Qin Yu didn’t forgive him, it would seem a little petty.

Therefore, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Wu, I was just joking with you. Did you call me for something? If you want to recruit me for the Military District, then there’s no need to say anything.”

Mr. Wu laughed loudly on the other end and said, “You’re really an exception. Other people go all out to become a high-ranking official, but you try to avoid it.”

Qin Yu smiled wryly. Once the authorities were involved, many things would become troublesome.

“Alright, let’s get back to the main topic,” Mr. Wu said seriously on the other end.

“I’m calling you this time because of a personal matter,” Mr. Wu said.

Qin Yu agreed. “Mr. Wu, if you have anything to say, just say it.”

Mr. Wu said, “My daughter hasn’t been resting well recently. She has nightmares every day. I didn’t take it seriously initially, but this situation has been going on for an entire month. She is about to collapse.”

At this point, Mr. Wu paused and then said jokingly, “Originally, I looked for Zhou Tong, but because of you, Zhou Tong has already been arrested, so you have to be responsible for this matter.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Okay, when you have time, I’ll go over.”

“No problem!” Mr. Wu immediately agreed, “If it’s convenient for you, it’s best for you to come over tonight.”

“Okay, see you tonight.” Qin Yu agreed.

In the evening, Qin Yu drove to Mr. Wu’s house according to the address Mr. Wu gave him.

Mr. Wu didn’t live in a military complex. Instead, he bought a residential house in a relatively remote place.

Although the house wasn’t as luxurious as a villa, it was still quite nice. Not only that, but the surrounding scenery was also extremely beautiful.

The moment Qin Yu got out of the car, he frowned.

He sniffed around and muttered, “That’s not right. Normally, such a good environment should have rich spiritual energy, but... not only do I not feel any spiritual energy here, but it’s also barren.”

After Qin Yu parked the car, he walked straight into Mr. Wu’s house.

Mr. Wu had already prepared food. Although they were all home-cooked dishes, they were extremely sumptuous.

Mr. Wu even took out a bottle of good wine and waited for Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you’re finally here.” Mr. Wu said with a smile.

“Mr. Wu.” Qin Yu walked forward and greeted Mr. Wu.

Mr. Wu quickly pulled Qin Yu to sit down. Then, he poured a glass of wine for Qin Yu.

“Eat first. Let’s talk while eating!” Mr. Wu said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately drank with Mr. Wu at the table.

After three glasses of wine, Mr. Wu’s face gradually became flushed.

He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and lamented, “I was really blind back then. I almost missed out on someone so full of potential like you. Speaking of which, Miss Yan is quite sharp.”

Qin Yu was also puzzled about this.

Why did Yan Ruoxue, a lofty heiress, favor him so much?

To put it bluntly, even Qin Yu looked down on himself back then.

“Without Miss Yan, I wouldn’t be where I am today.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and said seriously.

All of Qin Yu’s self-respect, confidence, and hope were given by Yan Ruoxue.

Before Yan Ruoxue appeared, Qin Yu’s life was filled with darkness.

At this moment, a little girl who looked about sixteen to seventeen years old and with her hair in two pigtails walked in.

As soon as she entered, she glared at Qin Yu and said, “Are you Qin Yu, the man who is dating Ruoxue?”
