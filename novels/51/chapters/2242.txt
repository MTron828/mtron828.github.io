2243 Chopping Melons and Cutting Vegetables

It was countless red parasites. As soon as those parasites appeared, they turned into an overwhelming red fog that swept toward Qin Yu.

“Try out the wind of my Three Corpse Parasite!”

The wind of Three Corpse Parasite rolled onto Qin Yu’s body. The parasites seemed to have smelled the vigorous chaotic qi on Qin Yu’s body.

Immediately, they began to bite his skin like a madman, making a gnawing sound that caused one’s teeth to ache.

“Enjoy it. As long as the Three Corpse Parasite has its eyes on you and enters your body, it will keep devouring and depleting your soul and spiritual energy. That feeling is not so good.”

The elderly man chuckled wickedly.

“Haha.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Qin Yu looked at the old man mockingly.

After a long time, the Three Corpse Parasite with a sawtooth akin divine weapon covered Qin Yu’s body on the surface but did not even bite through his skin.

The parasites that entered the ears, nostrils, and other places were also blocked outside by a hard layer of membrane covering the surface of bones.

His body became incomparably tough, having gone through the refinement of the bone cultivation water.

The two elders of the Blood Sect looked at each other, and a trace of shock could not help but flash in their eyes.

The Three Corpse Parasite could easily penetrate demonic beasts with their strong defenses. Therefore, many demon beasts in the Blood Sect could not do anything to these cultivators who looked ordinary.

“It seems that your Three Corpse Parasite is just so-so.”

Qin Yu laughed coldly. He suddenly looked into the distance.

At this moment, three familiar figures were watching them. They were the Edgeless team previously.

Even though they were ten thousand meters away, Qin Yu instantly discovered the traces of the three.

“Haha, a Holy Region brat is against a Blood Sect elder. Interesting, interesting. Who do you think will win?”

Xing Mou revealed a strange smile. In purgatory, an enemy of their enemy was a friend.

“The strength of these two is ranked among the top within the Blood Sect.”

Wu Feng said indifferently.

Qin Yu frowned and ignored the three.

“Explode!”

Taking advantage of the instance of Qin Yu’s distraction, the elderly man made a hand seal with a ferocious expression.

The group of parasites suddenly exploded. As these parasites had devoured countless bodies and souls, the chain effect of the explosion caused the entire space to shake.

“So ruthless? It’s not easy to nurture this Three Corpse Parasite.”

Xing Mou revealed a surprised expression.

“This guy is not simple. He seems to have forced the two into a corner.”

…

The old man’s face revealed a pained expression as he roared ferociously, “To waste the Three Corpse Parasite that I nurtured for a thousand years, I’ll live in vain if I don’t torment you for eternity.”

“Old man, you accompany your parasite to die together.”

Qin Yu appeared behind the elderly man and punched through his heart.

The moment the Three Corpse Parsite exploded, he stepped the line word formula and rushed out of the explosion range in a breath.

As for the few Three Corpse Parasites that had entered his body, they only shook his body slightly and did not cause any harm to him.

“You’re courting death. Do you know what price you must pay for killing two elders of my Blood Sect?”

Hui Yin’s pupils revealed anger.

“My friend, Qin Yu. This old man broke my formation with a move. You be careful.”

Wang Feng reminded anxiously by the side.

“Do you know what price you must pay for kidnapping my friend?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Dark Thunder Curse!”

The spatial internal qi suddenly changed, and a silver-green thunderbolt struck Qin Yu’s body.

This thunderbolt was not as fierce as the heavenly lightning. Instead, it was incomparably chilling and targeted the spiritual souls.

In an instant, the place where Hui Yin and Qin Yu were was stormy. Countless dark thunderbolts struck nearby Qin Yu, and the energy of dead bodies on the dark thunderbolts was dense, carrying tremendous resentment.

“Redeem your soul, seize your soul!”

Hui Yin suddenly retreated and formed several finger seals on his hand.

Two gray marks protruded from the space and were imprinted on Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu felt a giant hand forcefully pull his soul out, and his body became heavy.

“Don’t think of escape, Brat!”

Hu Yin said with a gloomy expression.

“Three Corpse Curse!”

An obscure incantation came out of Hui Yin’s mouth, and the hand seals in his hands changed rapidly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, looking at Hui Yin. Hui Yin’s previous method seemed to restrict Qin Yu and allow him a chance to use this technique.

The internal qi of the rules in the space suddenly changed. The incomparably gloomy air was like the end of the world.

Numerous green energy of dead bodies gushed out from the ground like a volcanic eruption.

Amidst a rustling sound, a giant hand pushed away the mound on the ground.

A giant corpse slowly stood up, and half of its body was rotten.

At this moment, two green ghost flames were burning strangely in his half-rotten pupils.

“Boom!”

The corpse suddenly jumped into the air, retracted its forearm, and punched Qin Yu.

Qin Yu punched out too, and the massive force blasted the corpse’s arm directly.

The corpse jumped up again without stopping. As it flipped its body, it kicked Qin Yu’s neck fiercely.

Qin Yu raised his hand to resist, and the massive force caused the ground to shake slightly.

“The Three Corpse Curse is indeed a technique not to be passed down by the Blood Sect. These corpses still maintain their techniques before death. Look at its attack method. It has its unique martial arts technique.”

Xing Mou exclaimed.

“This Three Corpse Curse is boundless. No matter how strong Qin Yu is, he can’t resist it.”

The soul cultivator behind him said indifferently.

Several more corpses stood up from the ground. Their internal qi was tremendously powerful. They should have been powerful experts when they were alive.

The three corpses surrounded Qin Yu, leaving him with no way to escape.

“These three corpses are all experts who are not weaker than me. Enjoy them. After you die, I will seal your soul on the corpses and let you live forever to work for me.”

Hui Yin’s expression was incredibly gloomy and sinister.

“Not to mention that the three are corpses. I couldn’t care less even if they were alive.”

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and said.

The three corpses suddenly attacked. In an instant, thousands of punches landed on Qin Yu’s body. Qin Yu directly clashed with them with the strength of his physical body.

From time to time, the sound of bones breaking and muscles tearing could be heard in the space.

As the sound faded, the surrounding dust settled.

The three corpses fell to the ground. Qin Yu had shattered their limbs, and their bodies were broken.

“What?”

Hui Yin was shocked.

These corpses were the three strongest people who died here. He had used all his strength to summon them.

Moreover, the Three Corpse Curse allowed them to retain their strength while they were alive. Under the control of the Three Corpse Curse, they were even more fearless. He did not expect them not to be Qin Yu’s match.

“Corpse Controlling Technique!”

Hui Yin roared and suddenly waved his hand. The three corpses on the ground crashed into him like flowing lights.

The three corpses suddenly swelled up, and the energy of dead bodies in their bodies boiled violently like water.

In an instant, the three corpses exploded violently. The violent shock wave caused Wu Feng and the other two, ten thousand meters away, to retreat involuntarily.

The three corpses turned into a rain of rotting flesh that fell into the surroundings.
