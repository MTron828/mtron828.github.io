Meng Wuxiong rubbed his fists and sneered. “I want to see what kind of person this person who dares to challenge the Yan family is.”

Qin Yu frowned.

Fighting He Teng would be strenuous to Qin Yu.

It would be very difficult to defeat both He Teng and Meng Wuxiong.

“Didn’t your dantian get crippled?” Meng Wuxiong teased.

Qin Yu’s attention wasn’t on Meng Wuxiong at all.

His eyes were fixed on He Teng.

He Teng chanted a spell silently while Fang Yue’s body trembled more and more severely.

“He Teng, stop!”

Qin Yu roared angrily and rushed towards He Teng with large strides!

“Buzz!”

However, at this moment, a golden light flashed around Qin Yu.

This golden light was like a barrier, blocking Qin Yu’s path.

“You’re ignoring me?” Meng Wuxiong raised his eyebrows and said.

Qin Yu looked at Meng Wuxiong coldly and said, “You aren’t my match. Get lost quickly!”

“Whether it is true or not, we will know after we fight!” Meng Wuxiong roared, then clenched his fist and came over!

He was extremely strong, and the strength of his fist was extremely great!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent, and could only raise his fist to confront him.

In the blink of an eye, the two sides had already exchanged dozens of blows.

Qin Yu’s mind wasn’t on Meng Wuxiong at all. He was caught off guard, then his chest was punched by Meng Wuxiong and his body flew back several meters.

“Hehe, it seems that your title as the king of Chuzhou is just an empty title.” Meng Wuxiong sneered.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground, rubbed his chest, and then sneered. “I was wondering why yours and He Teng’s experiences were so similar. There is indeed a myriad of connections between the two of you.”

“Hehe, so what?” Meng Wuxiong said indifferently.

“You’re dead meat. What’s the use of knowing so much?”

Qin Yu sized up Meng Wuxiong and said, “I’m giving you one last chance. Scram right now!”

“Give me a chance? You think you’re worthy of it? I’ll kill you, the King of Chuzhou, today!” Meng Wuxiong roared and rushed over again!

Qin Yu was extremely annoyed. His internal qi soared in an instant, and his physical body became indestructible!

The golden fist had the power to destroy everything in its path. With the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, he instantly arrived in front of Meng Wuxiong.

“Boom!”

This punch used almost 100% of his strength, and the fist pierced through Meng Wuxiong’s chest, then stuck out from his back!

“Pu!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out from Meng Wuxiong’s mouth!

The surrounding golden light also began to slowly disappear.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any more time. He once again used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and quickly arrived in front of He Teng!

“Clang!!”

Qin Yu punched, but his fist seemed to have smashed into steel! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At a glance, he saw a brown pot suspended in front of He Teng.

This flask emitted an ancient internal qi, and the energy that erupted from it even blocked Qin Yu’s fist.

“Magic artifact?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

He Teng slowly stood up from the ground.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “You’re really annoying. It seems that you won’t stop until I kill you.”

“Ah! ! !”

At this moment, a series of roars came from behind him!

He saw Meng Wuxiong’s figure begin to expand!

His height, which was already 1.8 meters, had increased to more than two meters at this moment!

All the muscles on his body bulged, and every inch of his muscles was covered by a sparkling light.

What was even more shocking was that there was a magic artifact hanging above his head!

“Another magic artifact.” Qin Yu gasped

Magic artifacts were difficult to find, but these two people actually had one each!

How did they get them?!

“Qin Yu, you’ve angered me!” Meng Wuxiong roared like a wild beast!

He Teng put his hands behind his back and said coldly, “Attack together and kill him!”

“Whoosh!”

After his transformation, Meng Wuxiong’s speed and strength had increased by a lot!

Most importantly, the magic artifact above his head seemed to have a powerful penetrating force!

Qin Yu threw a punch and felt the force penetrate his body before hitting his internal organs!

“Puff!”

After just three moves, Qin Yu couldn’t take it anymore.

This powerful penetrating force stirred the internal qi in his dantian and made it extremely chaotic!

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He stared at the magic artifact above Meng Wuxiong’s head and said in a low voice, “This force must come from the magic artifact.”

As long as that magic artifact was broken, Meng Wuxiong wouldn’t be a threat!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately used the the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and rushed toward the top of Meng Wuxiong’s head!

“Bang!”

But at this moment, He Teng made his move!

A ray of light shot out from the pot hanging above his head and blocked Qin Yu’s path!

“It’s useless,” He Teng said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat solemn.

At this moment, he was being attacked from both sides, and the two magic artifacts gave Qin Yu a great headache.

“Buzz!”

Qin Yu’s palm shook, and a bronze sword appeared in his hand.

“Nice weapon,” He Teng said indifferently as he looked at the bronze sword in Qin Yu’s hand.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His internal qi surged, and he raised his hand to perform the Nine Absolute Beginning Slashes!

The half-foot-wide sword light seemed to come from the horizon!

The terrifying sword energy made Brightheart Island tremble slightly!

“I told you, it’s useless!” He Teng’s expression turned cold.

The earthen pot hanging above his head actually emitted wisps of white energy.

The white energy flowed backward and covered He Teng’s entire body and face.

At a glance, he looked like an immortal who had descended to the mortal world!

Clang!

The loud sound caused huge waves on the surface of the sea!

However, the seemingly weak internal qi on the earthen pot easily blocked the first slash of the Nine Absolute Beginning Slashes!

Qin Yu’s expression instantly changed drastically!

This was a Divine Rank cultivation technique, yet it was actually ineffective?!

“Boom!”

Just as Qin Yu was feeling shocked, Meng Wuxiong attacked once again!

The magic artifact above his head flickered with light, and the terrifying internal qi transformed into a huge ball of light before ruthlessly smashing into Qin Yu’s chest!

“Dong!”

Under the attack of the magic artifact, Qin Yu instantly retreated before smashing fiercely into the center of the group of rich people!

“Pu!”

Several of Qin Yu’s sternums had been broken, and his mouth was bleeding profusely. It was a miserable sight.

“You can’t die. If you die, what will we do...”

“Hurry up and stand up to go fight with them!”

“As a martial artist, you should protect us!” The big-bellied man shouted sternly.

When he heard the big-bellied man’s voice, Qin Yu’s eyes flashed!

He hurriedly looked at the big-bellied man and said, “Give me that rockery!”

The big-bellied man shrank back and muttered, “What situation is it? Yet you’re still thinking about the rockery...”

“Cut the crap and give it to me!” Qin Yu roared angrily.

The big-bellied man was so scared that he trembled.

He reluctantly took out the rockery and whispered, “Let me tell you, it’s not right to steal things...”

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to listen to his nonsense. He held the rockery in his hand and used his inner strength. A trace of blood essence immediately flew out from between Qin Yu’s eyebrows.

Under Qin Yu’s control, this trace of blood essence landed on the rockery.

“Crash...”

The moment the blood essence landed on the rockery, it actually began to fall off! Pieces of broken rocks fell down from the rockery one after another!

In just a few seconds, this rockery had changed its appearance!

And after the rockery fell off, it formed the shape of a small mountain!

“This is... The Venerable Fifth Mountain?” Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted, and a strong sense of excitement flashed across his face!
