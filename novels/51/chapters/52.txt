Chapter 53: Unruly Heiress Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu was beyond excited.

He held Mr. Yang’s hand tightly and said, “Mr. Yang, don’t worry. I will definitely get first place in Chuzhou!”

Qin Yu had countless prescriptions in his hands. Although Qin Yu was temporarily unable to refine a pill with these prescriptions, as long as his strength improved slightly, it wouldn’t be a problem.

“In my lifetime, I will be able to see Jiangcheng take first place in the Chinese Medicine Conference. I can rest in peace,” Mr. Yang couldn’t help but lament.

Through the conversation, he learned that the next Chinese Medicine Conference was within a month.

To be on the safe side, Qin Yu had to increase his strength as soon as possible within a month to ensure that he could successfully refine the pill.

At present, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to increase his strength.

Because he knew very well that Yan Ruoxue was too perfect.

The average Joe was definitely unworthy of such a woman.

Since Yan Ruoxue was willing to believe in Qin Yu, then Qin Yu definitely wouldn’t let Yan Ruoxue down.

“Ruoxue, I definitely won’t let you down.” Qin Yu, his eyes shining brightly, clenched his fists.

...

Shen Yun’s expression was ashen and his face was full of anger.

“This lowlife actually dared to trick me!” Shen Yun flipped over the vase on the table!

“Dad, what happened?” Shen Tian, who had just been discharged from the hospital, asked in puzzlement.

Shen Yun coldly snorted and berated, “Shut the f * ck up! It’s all because of you, you loser!”

Shen Tian immediately said with some grievance, “What has it got to do with me...”

At this moment, Zhao Gang walked over and said with a sheepish smile, “President Shen, if I were you, I would just get rid of Qin Yu!”

“You talk too much!” Shen Yun kicked Zhao Gang’s butt.

“If I kill Qin Yu, what if Yan Ruoxue investigates it? Will you be responsible?!” Shen Yun vented all his anger on Zhao Gang.

Zhao Gang shrunk to the side sheepishly. Although he was unhappy, he didn’t dare to say anything.

Shen Yun snorted and said, “My family has hundreds of products and more than ten experts. I want to see what an insignificant Soul Nourishment Pill can do!”

...

The next day, Qin Yu got up early and prepared to rush to the market to buy a batch of herbs.

Ever since Shen Tian appeared, Qin Yu felt a strong sense of crisis.

Just Shen Tian alone was enough to give Qin Yu a headache. What about a top-tier city like Jingdu?

A perfect girl like Yan Ruoxue definitely didn’t lack suitors. Moreover, the suitors definitely had powerful backgrounds.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any time.

He called Lei Hu and rushed to the market together.

The market in Jiangcheng was located on Market Street. Every morning, countless small vendors would set up stalls here.

In addition to vegetables, meat, and other daily necessities, there were also some herbs vendors from the mountains who came to set up stalls.

“Mr. Qin, I’ve been here for a long time. There’s nothing interesting here.” After getting out of the car, Lei Hu muttered at the side.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Maybe it’s because you can’t discern quality.”

Lei Hu touched his nose and said sheepishly, “I can’t discern quality, but I was born on this street. There are too many swindlers here.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. Instead, he began to walk on the street.

Just as Lei Hu said, almost all the herb merchants here were swindlers. Qin Yu walked down more than half of the street but didn’t even see a single wild herb.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly noticed a vendor in the last row.

The vendor in front of him displayed a dazzling array of artificial herbs.

Only a stalk of Angelica dahurica caught Qin Yu’s attention.

Only a stalk of almost withered Angelica dahurica was emitting a strong medicinal fragrance.

Seeing this stalk of Angelica dahurica, Qin Yu’s eyes immediately lit up.

He hurriedly walked forward, casually picked up a stalk of herbs, and asked politely, “Sir, how much is this stalk of Angelica?”

The vendor gLanced at it and said, “30,000!”

“F * ck you, is this highway robbery? I will smash your lousy stall!” Lei Hu pointed at the vendor’s nose and cursed.

The vendor glared at Lei Hu and said, “If you can buy it, then buy it. If you don’t buy it, then get lost. Stop harassing me, you pauper.”

“You motherf * cker...” Lei Hu rolled up his sleeves and was about to beat him.

Qin Yu hurriedly stopped him and shook his head with a smile.

“30,000 it is then. I want it,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

When he heard this, the vendor’s expression immediately changed. He hurriedly sat up and said, “You’re so perceptive. I’ll give it to you right now!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The difference in his attitude amused Qin Yu.

He smiled and shook his head, then looked at Lei Hu.

Lei Hu hurriedly took out 30,000 yuan from his bag and threw it to the hawker while muttering, “If it weren’t for Mr. Qin’s good temper, I would have beaten you!”

Just as Qin Yu was about to reach out to take the stalk of Angelica dahurica, someone grabbed it before him.

“I want this stalk of Angelica dahurica!” The person who spoke was a well-dressed young girl.

The young girl was only 17 to 18 years old. She had light makeup on her face, and the head-to-toe designer clothes on her body indicated that she was wealthy.

The bodyguards around her also showed that she was the daughter of a wealthy family.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown and said as politely as he could, “Miss, I saw this stalk of Angelica dahurica first. I’ve already paid for it.”

“It’s none of my business. It’s mine since it’s in my hands!” The young girl said arrogantly.

Qin Yu frowned and said with some displeasure, “Miss, you have to be reasonable.”

“Why should I be reasonable with you? I told you, it’s mine if I want it!” The girl said defiantly.

Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold. He took a step forward and said, “You’d better give this stalk of Angelica dahurica to me obediently. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude.”

“Yo, are you trying to scare me? Do you know who I am?” The girl sneered.

“I don’t care who you are. You have to be reasonable.” Qin Yu’s voice was extremely cold.

“Miss Lin? Why are you here?” At this moment, Lei Hu’s bodyguard, Lance, suddenly exclaimed.

Qin Yu frowned. He looked at Lance and said, “You know her?”

Lance didn’t say anything, but the girl said rudely, “Lance, tell her who I am! Tell him to get lost!”

Lance said awkwardly, “Mr. Qin, she is my master’s daughter, Lin Wan...”

“Your master?” Qin Yu frowned and said, “Lincheng?”

“Yes...” Lance nodded.

Lin Wan took a step forward and snorted. “Do you know who I am now? Get out of my sight, or I’ll break your legs!”

Qin Yu looked at Lin Wan and sneered. “I don’t care who you are. This stalk of Angelica dahurica is mine!”

Lin Wan’s expression was filled with anger. She yelled, “My father is Lincheng! The number one martial artist in Jiangcheng!”

“No one can have it even if he’s the king!” With that, Qin Yu waved his hand, and the stalk of Angelica dahurica fell into Qin Yu’s hands.

“You!” Lin Wan was so angry that her petite body trembled. She pointed at Qin Yu and ordered, “Give me back the stalk of Angelica dahurica!”

“No,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

“You... You’re courting death!” Lin Wan shouted and swung her small fist at Qin Yu.

Lance quickly pulled Lin Wan back and said awkwardly, “Miss Lin, you’d better leave quickly. Mr. Qin saw this stalk of Angelica dahurica first...”

Hearing Lance’s words, Lin Wan became even angrier.

She raised her hand and slapped Lance. She said angrily, “You traitor, hurry up and snatch it back for me!”
