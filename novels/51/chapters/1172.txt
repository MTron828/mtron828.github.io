Chapter 1173: Chapter 1,173, Xiao Yu? ! 

“Beat him to death! beat him to death!”

The roars from below were enough to see the anger of the crowd.

Gu Xinghe’s face was full of anger. After three days, his injuries had slightly improved, and his internal Qi had also recovered a little.

“A bunch of ants, shut up for me!”A furious roar shook the sky and Earth!

In an instant, no one dared to speak, and everyone kept quiet.

“Qin Yu! I Won’t let you off even if I become a ghost!”Gu Xinghe raised his head and roared, desperately shouting Qin Yu’s name.

Qin Yu glanced at him, ignoring him.

At this time, Gu Xinghe was already a lamb waiting to be slaughtered, not worth mentioning.

“Mr. Zhou, you can rest assured that I won’t become the next Gu Xinghe,”Qin Yu said with a smile. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Mr. Zhou was speechless. Of course, he was a little worried, but he just couldn’t say anything.

Following the gunshot on the stage, Qin Yu’s mind also moved.

Gu Xinghe’s primordial spirit exploded at this moment. His eyes dimmed and he completely fell to the ground. There was no longer any chance of survival.

“Qin Yu, we’ve prepared lunch. Let’s eat together.”Mr. Zhou patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Zhou, I still have some matters to attend to, so I won’t be going. Thank you for your kindness.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

He took out the list. The first line of the list was Fang Yue.

Fang Yue had been lying there for too long. All of this was because of He Teng.

And because Qin Yu had too many things to attend to, Fang Yue had been in a coma.

“According to the mustache, Fang Yue needs demonic beast spirit pills,”Qin Yu thought.

Two spirit pills could wake Fang Yue up.

Qin Yu took out a spirit pill from his hand.

This spirit pill was taken from Yun Long’s body.

“I need to find another one,”Qin Yu thought.

He owed Fang Yue, and he had always felt guilty.

What he could make up for now was to find a better spirit pill.

Thus, Qin Yu found Yan Yongfu and planned to bring him to the island to summon a Demon Beast.

At the same time, at an inconspicuous place on Earth, an unusual light was flashing.

The light was extremely bright, like a ball of red light.

Under the red light was an ancient array platform.

The light gradually faded, and a man and a woman walked down from the array platform.

“This is earth? The legendary ancient star?”The woman scanned her surroundings, her eyes filled with surprise.

“TSK, it looks like it’s just SO-SO.”The man snorted.

The woman said in a deep voice, “The elder said that this ancient star is a Land of outstanding people. Many top-notch great cultivators who transcend tribulations come from this ancient star.”

“It’s the Golden Age now. Whenever the golden age descends, there will always be a few figures who stand at the top of the Holy Region on this ancient planet.”

The man sniffed and snorted, “I think it’s just a rumor. This so-called ancient planet’s spiritual qi is exhausted. How can there be any top-notch people? It’s not even worth mentioning.”

“Alright, don’t say anymore. Do as the elder asks.”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu brought Yan Yongfu to the former Cloud Dragon Island.

On the way, Yan Yongfu frowned and said, “The holy region is about to open. You should take advantage of this time to absorb all the remaining blood.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and shook his head. “There’s no rush. Before I leave, I have to finish what I need to do.”

Yan Yongfu sighed slightly and didn’t say anything else.

At this moment, Qin Yu recalled the world he had once seen under the sea.

“With my current cultivation level, I might be able to step into that underwater world to take a look,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu’s current physical body was many times stronger than before. The pressure under the sea was already very difficult to hurt Qin Yu.

Soon, the two of them arrived at the Cloud Dragon Island.

As a mighty figure, Yan Yongfu had many spells under his control. Naturally, the summoning of demonic beasts was not a problem.

Following the summoning of spells, one demonic beast after another gathered here.

Qin Yu directly used hand-to-hand combat. With a few punches, several martial saint demonic beasts fell to the ground and could not get up.

He took out a spiritual pill from among them. Together with the spiritual pill from the cloud dragon, it was enough to wake up Fang Yue.

Qin Yu could not help but feel a myriad of emotions as he held the two spiritual pills.

Back then, Fang Yue’s strength was not weaker than Qin Yu’s. If she had cultivated all the way, she would have already entered the martial saint realm.

“What a pity.”Qin Yu sighed slightly, and the guilt in his heart increased a little.

Just as the two of them were about to leave, Qin Yu suddenly felt a powerful internal Qi drifting over faintly.

“Do you feel a trace of martial saint’s Qi?”Qin Yu looked at Yan Yongfu and frowned.

Yan Yongfu shook his head and said, “No. How could there be anyone in such a place?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He released his divine sense and that internal Qi became even more obvious.

“Buzz!”

A light flashed between Qin Yu’s brows as he used his desolate God’s eyes to look a thousand miles away.

He saw a beautiful figure standing on the surface of the sea.

She had a slender figure and her hair was jet black. She wore a mask on her face.

“Xiao Yu? !”Upon seeing this person, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly!

Why was Xiao Yu Here? !

At this moment, Xiao Yu followed Qin Yu’s gaze and looked over coldly.

That gaze was clearly staring at him!

However, the distance between the two of them was extremely far. Qin Yu had to rely on the desolate God’s eye to barely discover her figure!

How did she discover him from such a far distance?

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He put away the desolate God’s eye and immediately shot towards Xiao Yu.
