“Brother, I miss my younger sister so much. In the past, Grandpa would tie my younger sister’s hair every day, and I would accompany my younger sister to catch fish. However, my younger sister was killed by a bad guy. Grandpa said the village chief would make me another younger sister, but I don’t want anyone else. I just want my original younger sister.”

Hong Yu suddenly started sobbing softly.

“Grandpa has been crying secretly. The person he saved killed my younger sister. He thought I was asleep, but I wasn’t. Brother, do you think my younger sister will come back in the future? I really miss her. In the past, I always bullied her and pinched her face. She wanted to play with my wooden horse, but I was unwilling to give it to her. When she comes back, I’ll give all my toys to her.”

“Your younger sister will come back in the future. Brother will also protect you all and not let anyone hurt you all. Big Brother promises to do my best not to let anyone bully you all.”

Qin Yu felt bitter in his heart, hugging the little boy who sobbed softly.

Previously, he might have suspected that these were just the emotionless spawns of Saint Kingdom. But now that he saw the little boy’s reaction, he had completely overturned this thought.

The living beings here were all living people. They had their emotions, just like them.

It was just that one was an outsider and the other a native.

At this moment, the village chief in the room looked at Qin Yu and revealed a somewhat inexplicable smile.

“I’m sorry, Little Hong Yu is still not used to it, especially after the soul of the Lord of this Saint Kingdom perished. The village chief has already told us this kingdom will no longer be as peaceful as before.”

The old man, Hong Da, appeared out of nowhere. He took over Little Hong Yu, who had fallen asleep.

“Can’t you all resist? Even if these people kill your relatives, you can’t retaliate?”

Qin Yu said with a frown. He somewhat could not understand.

Regardless of Dark Heart, Demonic Flame, Faint Radiance of the monster race, or Ji Tianming, they treated the villagers as nourishment to strengthen their soul power.

But these villagers could not resist them. This was unfair.

“The village chief has said that this is our destiny…”

The old man said in a low voice. He seemed unwilling to continue chatting with Qin Yu.

“Little Brother, you’ve saved us villagers again. Go and see the village chief. He should thank you properly.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Could it be that the village chief would thank the people who contributed to protecting the villagers in this area?

The more he thought about it, the more likely it was. At that time, he had saved Hong Da and Hong Yu and got to listen to a dao lecture when going back.

The power of the dao lecture had increased his power of the soul, even more than the power he killed Dark Heart.

Qin Yu’s heart began to beat rapidly. He quickly went to knock on the village chief’s door.

“Village Chief!”

Qin Yu pushed the door open and walked in, only to see the village chief pull up his pants in a panic.

Several big banana leaves were beside him with some unknown liquid on them.

“Cough, cough, cough! It’s you again, the great outsider. Thank you for protecting our villagers once again.”

The village chief stretched out his hand, looking solemn, and wanted to shake Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Qin Yu’s hand.

“Village Chief, forget about shaking hands.”

Qin Yu looked at the strange mucus on his fingernails and could not get over it.

“This time, the evil outsider has killed another 20 villagers. It seems that there is a need for another dao lecture. Brave outsider, you can participate.”

The village chief clasped his hands at his back and put on a calm expression.

Qin Yu suppressed the joy in his heart. It was indeed as expected.

The village chief would only care about him if he was of help to the village.

After giving the reward, the village chief would treat him as invisible again.

It was like the bounty rules in the lower realm. There would be a reward for completing the mission.

“Village Chief, I want to ask you something. Other than the dao lecture, can I ask you something else? For example, how can I maximize my strength now?”

Qin Yu asked tentatively. Increasing the Saint power of the soul was important, too.

However, it could be increased by killing some Confused Consciousness that had yet to awaken their consciousness. Discovering other ideas would be the most important to Qin Yu.

“Young Man, your question is not simple. Only wise elders who have been through a long time can answer your question. However, if I answer your question, you can’t participate in my dao lecture.”

The village chief said mysteriously.

“Agreed. ”

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment before confirming it.

Although the dao lecture was also tremendously important, Qin Yu felt that acquiring knowledge of the Saint Kingdom was even more so.

Just like this time, when facing the Bear King and 20 Lightning Leopards, if he were to face them head-on, he might not be able to defeat the person behind them even if his strength was doubled.

“Then let me explain to you briefly. There are several types of power here. The first is the simplest Saint power of the soul. Regardless of killing the living beings here or outsiders, they will absorb the Saint power of the other party and use this Saint power to enhance their strengths.

“The second is the Heart of Saint Kingdom. Every Heart of Saint Kingdom has a sealing skill that allows one to find their opponent’s weak points, and it’s common to see the weaker party defeat the stronger party. Of course, the more Heart of Saint Kingdom you have, the more methods you’ll have. With 81 Heart of Saint Kingdom, you can control the shrine and become the master of this place. This is naturally the most important power.

“The third is the innate ability of an individual. For example, the dragon race’s dragon breath which is an innate ability of its body, the mind control of the heavenly monster race, and your Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.”

The village chief glanced at Qin Yu’s forehead.

“Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze is also considered one?”

Qin Yu was somewhat surprised. Previously, he was wondering why the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could follow him here.

“This Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze is considered a bloodline inheritance. It’s not convenient for me to elaborate further.

“The fourth is to control the order and comprehend the power here.”

The village chief smiled mysteriously.

“There are four abilities, with no distinction between strength and weakness. It depends on your choice and cosmic luck. Moreover, they have to be compatible with each other. Some skills of the Heart of Saint Kingdom can only be unleashed with a suitable physique.

“Once, someone used the power of order to kill the Lord of this kingdom. That person’s name was Wu Ji.”

The village chief looked at Qin Yu meaningfully.

Qin Yu’s body was as if being struck by lightning. Senior Wu Ji was once in this kingdom?

He even killed the master of the Saint Kingdom as an outsider. How terrifying was this power?

“Everything in the Saint Kingdom exists for a reason. There are some powers that even the Lord of the kingdom couldn’t control. Many talented foreign guests appeared in this world. Even the most intelligent person in the history of the Primordial Chaos perished in this world. A genius who had gathered ten Heart of Saint Kingdom was killed by a living being who didn’t even have a single Heart of Saint Kingdom.”

Seeing Qin Yu deep in thought, the village chief did not rush him.

Qin Yu felt the village chief wanted to give him some advice, but he could not grasp it no matter what..
