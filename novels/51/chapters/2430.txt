Chapter 2431 - 2431: The Peak of Third Level

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Shut up, you shameless old thing!”

Qin Yu stepped forward. He arched his fist and gathered power. The power of the world surged on his fist and pierced out like an arrow leaving the bow.

The Sumeru World!

His speed of spatial rules deduction increased by a hundredfold after he obtained the Five Emperor Coins.

Whenever he had the time, he would continuously expand the Sumeru World. At this moment, the power of the Sumeru World was about 20% stronger than previously.

His one punch already contained the strength of the Third Level.

“Small tricks. Killing of Thousand Thunders!”

The elder’s punch carried the lightning in the sky. He had to fight with this punch forcefully.

A terrifying force suddenly erupted. Even the ancestors of the Lei family were forced back a few steps by this terrifying force.

“Five Emperors! Lend me your strength!”

In the Sumeru World, the phantom of a Great Emperor appeared. A colossal fizure resembling a deity appeared behind Qin Yu and gently patted his back.

The power flowed to his fist, and Qin Yu once again released a tsunami-like power.

It broke the elder’s arm and sent him flying backward.

“Sissy, did you see that? That’s the strength of a man. Why not we exchange a punch?”

Qin Yu smiled at Hua Zhikong.

“You!”

Hua Zhikong spat another mouthful of blood.

“You’re so crazy, then I have nothing to worry about after killing you.”

Lei Li’s expression was indifferent. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of Qin Yu.

In the blink of an eye, the sound of the sea of the Path of Heaven echoed across the sky at the bottom of the sea of the Path of Heaven.

A colossal Soul Statue slowly opened its eyes. In an instant, numerous powers of rules were directly injected into Lei Li’s body from the statue.

A terrifying internal qi rose from Lei Li’s body.

“Martial Uncle Lei Li, please show mercy!”

Lei Xin’s face changed. He came to Lei Li and wanted to plead for mercy.

The scorching lightning flashed, and Lei Li had already passed by him.

“If this kid hadn’t attacked, I might have spared his life. But now he’s already sentenced to death!”

“Old man, fight if you want to. Stop dawdling and talking nonsense!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s muscles were bulging. He had already activated the cosmic form, and his physical strength was at its peak.

Even if he was facing this Tribulation Third Level elder, he was not afraid at all.

More and more people gathered at the periphery of Thunder Courtyard.

These people were initially here to see the genius who triggered the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation. They did not expect to encounter such a situation.

“Jiang He, does Qin Yu have a chance of winning against this person?”

Yao Meng’s expression was complicated. She and Jiang He were carrying out a family mission nearby.

They did not expect the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation to descend. They wanted to see how Yan Ruoxue would transcend the tribulation and did not expect such a change to happen.

“Look at the power of the heavenly sea. It’s already at the Peak of the Third Level. This person is probably also a core bloodline of the Lei family. His strength is much stronger than ordinary Tribulation Third Level. Qin Yu will have a tough battle to fight.”

Jiang He shook his head slightly. Even though they were in the same cultivation realm of Tribulation Transcending, there were times when the difference was vast.

And the size of the Soul Statue condensed in the heavenly sea actually represented the difference in the power of the soul. These were the Soul Statues of different sizes that Qin Yu had seen when he first swam in the sea of the Path of Heaven.

The size of the Soul Statue represented the level of the power of the Path of Heaven.

And the more central the position of the statue was, the purer the power of the Path of Heaven.

Lei Li’s power at this moment was obvious. His Soul Statue was at the center of the sea of thunder, and the combat strength was almost the top-notch of the Tribulation Third Level.

“Tsk tsk, even if he wins this battle, what can Qin Yu do? Does he think that he can escape from Lei Qingye and the others?”

A sinister smile suddenly appeared beside Jiang He and Yao Meng.

It was actually He Teng. At this moment, He Teng’s expression kept changing. One moment, he was laughing wildly and worried the other moment.

Without knowing him, one would definitely think he was a lunatic.

Although his internal qi was only at the True Saint Realm, Jiang He and Yao Meng dared not underestimate him because he could get close to the two silently just now.

He must have taken the same path as Qin Yu had taken, and his soul had not fused with the sea of the Path of Heaven.

“Qin Yu, Qin Yu, you’d better not die here. Otherwise, how am I going to get rid of my inner demons?”

Back on Earth, He Teng had never defeated Qin Yu. If Qin Yu died, he might not have been able to break through the inner demons, which was tremendously fatal to cultivators.

“You’re a True Saint fellow. Why are you barking here? It’s so noisy.” An ancient cultivator stared at He Teng and frowned as he scolded.

“Hehe!”

He Teng’s eyeballs rolled a few times, then he stuck out his blood-red tongue and licked the air.

The ancient cultivator’s voice suddenly came to an abrupt halt. A dense, net-like pattern of blood vessels suddenly appeared on his body. After that, his body instantly turned into countless pieces of flesh and blood that fell to the ground.

The surrounding people were shocked and quickly moved to the side, not daring to stay with this madman. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“What a weird method! You could use a spell to activate the spatial power of rules forcefully, and your soul is tremendously powerful as if something is lurking inside.”

Jiang He was a little surprised. He did not see He Teng’s attack clearly.

“Hmph, none of your business!”

He Teng’s expression was a little gloomy. He did not expect Jiang He to be able to see through some of his situation the moment he attacked.

Most people did not notice He Teng. Many were discussing animatedly, expressing their views on this battle.

Usually, most people would not care about this battle. However, Qin Yu was famous since he returned to the Holy Region from purgatory. Some people felt that Qin Yu had a chance to defeat the famous Lei Li.

Finger Spear!

After Lei Li’s internal qi rose to the extreme, thousands of fingers pierced out in an instant.

Every finger was aimed at the vital point.

The Finger Spear was as fast as lightning. There was no other way but to fight it head-on.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu did not retreat at all. The power of annihilation surged through his entire body, and the Fist of Annihilation pierced out with terrifying destructive power.

Both sides retreated after the first contact and then used their killing moves.

The power of the Finger Spear was at the Peak of Tribulation Third Level. The sound of electric current on Lei Li’s body roared crazily as if endless.

Qin Yu’s body was covered in blood. Every time they clashed, it would bring about a massive shock to his body.

At this moment, he was furious. Even if he had to exchange injuries, he would not retreat at all.

In the blink of an eye, they had already clashed tens of thousands of times.

Many wounds appeared on Qin Yu’s body. Facing the utmost power of Tribulation Third Level, his realm still had a big gap.

“What a terrifying power of the flesh god. Take this finger of mine again!”

At this moment, Lei Li was injured, too. However, he was stronger than Qin Yu, so his injuries were much lighter than Qin Yu’s.

Lei Li’s body turned into the power of thunder and lightning as he swam around Qin Yu. At this moment, he was the embodiment of thunder and lightning..
