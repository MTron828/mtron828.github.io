Chapter 1590: Chapter 1,590, Sleeping Demonic Beast 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu placed almost all of his treasures in front of Ye Nan.

Ye Nan took a glance and quickly saw that the treasures in Qin Yu’s hands were extraordinary.

“Huangji Buddha Flame?”Ye Nan raised his eyebrows and stretched out his hand to take it.

Although Qin Yu was reluctant to part with it, he didn’t say anything and allowed ye Nan to take the Huangji Buddha flame in his hand.

That Ball of flame danced in Ye Nan’s palm, looking extremely demonic.

And Ye Nan’s eyes were also bursting with excitement.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “Senior ye, if you are willing to help, I can give this Huangji Buddha Flame to you.”

Ye Nan stretched out his palm, and the Huangji Buddha Flame instantly disappeared without a trace. Clearly, it had been kept into the spatial magic artifact by him.

This made Qin Yu feel extremely reluctant to part with it. However, the matters of the northern lands were more important right now, so Qin Yu could only forcefully endure this reluctance.

After that, Ye nan indifferently said, “A mere Huangji Buddha flame isn’t worth me making a move. You also know that I, Ye Nan, don’t lack treasures.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and asked, “Then what does senior ye mean?”

Ye nan said indifferently, “My meaning is very clear. If you want me to help, you have to give me more rewards.”

“But... This is all I have,”Qin Yu said with a frown.

“Really?”Ye Nan raised his eyebrows.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Of course, this wasn’t true.

He still had a bronze coffin in his hand, but the divine body in the bronze coffin was left for iron egg by Qin Yu. He really couldn’t bear to give it to Ye Nan.

“It’s true.”After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu finally lied.

Hearing that, ye Nan immediately said, “How about this? Three hundred miles ahead, there is a cave where a demonic beast is sleeping. You bring me its inner core, and I will reluctantly agree to it. How about it?”

“A sleeping demonic beast? Is it very powerful?”Qin Yu asked subconsciously.

“It’s alright. If it weren’t for the fact that I had something to do, I would have gone to retrieve its inner core,”ye Nan said indifferently.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and felt that this wasn’t a difficult matter, so he nodded and agreed.

“Senior Ye, then I will set off now,”Qin Yu said.

After saying this, Qin Yu stood up and left.

He summoned the Divine Eagle and prepared to find this demonic beast.

After Qin Yu left, Ye Nan let out a light snort. With a thought, he took out the Huangji Buddha Flame.

“In this world, there are still people who come to pay their respects to me. Not Bad,”ye Nan said with a smile.

“Do you really want to help him?”At this moment, Ye Nan’s butler asked.

Ye nan sneered and said, “Help him? How is that possible? I don’t have the leisure to do that.”

“Then what if he really brought back the inner core?”The Butler said with some confusion.

Ye nan sneered and said, “There are a total of eight caves three hundred miles away from here. That place is called the demonic cave. Not to mention that these demonic beasts are powerful, even if he really brought back the inner core, so what? “I can find an excuse to say that he found the wrong cave and took the wrong inner core.”

The Butler suddenly came to a realization. He continued to ask, “Then, don’t you want to return this Huangji Buddha Flame to him?”

“Return it to him? When will there be a reason to return the thing that is in My Hands?”Ye Nan sneered.

He handed the Huangji Buddha Flame to the butler and said, “Alright, put away this Huangji Buddha Flame.”

“Yes, Master.”The servant beside him took the Huangji Buddha Flame and slowly retreated.

On the other side, Qin Yu was riding on the divine eagle as he sped in the direction that ye Nan had pointed out.

Soon, Qin Yu was getting closer and closer to that position. At this moment, the figure under Qin Yu’s feet was letting out a cry, looking extremely uneasy.

“HMM?”Qin Yu frowned slightly. As he reached out to comfort the divine eagle, he opened his desolate divine eye and looked ahead.

He saw that in the forest, there were many caves. Each of the caves emitted an extremely powerful internal Qi.

It was this powerful internal Qi that made the divine eagle feel extremely uneasy. It trembled in the air.

It was obvious that ye Nan had lied. The demonic beast in the cave was extremely powerful.

Qin Yu put away the Divine Eagle and walked towards the cave.

When he arrived in the vicinity, the powerful internal Qi became even more obvious. It was almost suffocating.

What gave Qin Yu the greatest headache was that there were eight caves in front of him. In each cave, there was a demonic beast sleeping soundly.

“Which cave is ye Nan talking about...”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

There were eight caves in total. Qin Yu had no idea where to start.

But since he had already come, Qin Yu was somewhat unwilling to go back just like that.

“Since he didn’t say which cave it is, I think any demonic beast should be fine,”Qin Yu muttered.

He swept a glance and finally chose the cave with the weakest internal Qi and Strode in.

The cave was pitch-black, and it could be said that one couldn’t even see one’s own fingers.

Qin Yu stretched out his palm and released the spiritual fire, walking forward with the weak flames of the spiritual fire.

His divine sense went deep into the demonic beast, searching for it.

As Qin Yu went deeper into the demonic beast, the internal Qi became stronger. The cold killing intent emitted from its body made even Qin Yu tremble.

“Even when it was sleeping, it had such a terrifying killing intent. I wonder how many of its kind this demonic beast has killed,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Soon, a huge body appeared before Qin Yu’s eyes.

It seemed to be a sleeping tiger. The stripes all over its body were flickering in the darkness.

The demonic beast didn’t wake up at all when Qin Yu arrived. It was still snoring loudly. The deafening snoring echoed in the cave. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“It really slept like a log...”Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was likely that this demonic beast had no natural enemies. Otherwise, it would not be so careless.

“I might as well kill it while it is sleeping, so as to avoid alerting the other demonic beasts during the battle,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu’s body emitted a golden light, and his right fist bulged with veins like a dragon.

Spiritual power gathered on his right fist, ready to explode with the most fatal blow at any time.

But at this moment, the killing intent on Qin Yu’s body startled this demonic beast!

Its lantern-like eyes suddenly opened, and two beams of light shot towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he hurriedly crossed his arms in front of him.

“Bang!”

A terrifying force exploded in Qin Yu’s arms, and Qin Yu’s body was directly sent flying, crashing into the mountain.

Large pieces of falling rocks fell down, almost burying Qin Yu!

Qin Yu hurriedly shot out from the falling rocks. He lowered his head to look at his arms. His arms seemed to have been burned by flames and were emitting wisps of white smoke.

Waves of pain came from his arms, and his skin was close to rotting.
