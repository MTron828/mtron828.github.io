Chapter 614: The Man With the Mustache Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the man with the mustache’s greedy look, Qin Yu was tempted.

Many people had said that the Immortal Slaying Sect sect was the most powerful sect, if you can get an opportunity here, it will definitely change your life.

“Then quickly set off, don’t delay time,” Qin Yuxin wanted to return to the outside world, so he urged.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “What’s the rush? I have to prepare. This is the Immortal Slaying Sect. If I touch something that shouldn’t be touched, I’ll be killed here.”

After saying that, the man with the mustache took out one magic artifact after another from his pocket.

These magic artifacts were extremely strange. There was a pestle, a POW, and some densely-packed runes.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask curiously, “What’s this?”

The man with the mustache said, “This has the purest power of faith, which can be used to protect the body.”

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t ask further.

He was tired now, so he took this opportunity to have a good rest.

...

In the outside world.

They seemed to accept the fact that Qin Yu was dead.

There were very few people who still had hope. After all, Qin Yu hadn’t appeared for an entire month.

In the Green Moon Villa.

A white-haired young man was sitting by the Spiritual Spring while absorbing the spiritual energy from the Spiritual Spring.

This young man was none other than Yao Qing.

Ever since he learned of Qin Yu’s death, Yao Qing’s flippant demeanor had completely disappeared. He became an ambitious young man who had worked hard.

Taozi chose to return to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. The reason why she had left was because of Qin Yu.

Now that Qin Yu wasn’t here, she had nothing to be reluctant about.

“Who told you to cultivate here?!”

At this moment, two people walked forward and pointed at Yao Qing and shouted.

Yao Qing opened his eyes. A trace of anger flashed across his face, but he eventually endured it.

After that, Yao Qing stood up and turned his head to leave the Spiritual Spring.

He walked all the way to the main hall and turned around to enter a boudoir.

The one staying in this room was Zhen Yue.

Yao Qing pushed the door open and entered the room.

Seeing Yao Qing, Zhen Yue slowly stood up and said with an unpleasant expression, “Yao Qing...”

Yao Qing took a deep breath and said, “Sect Master Zhen, I plan to leave the Green Moon Villa.”

A dazed look flashed across Zhen Yue’s face. She frowned and asked, “Why... Why?”

Yao Qing said in a deep voice, “Mr. Qin is no longer here, and the Green Moon Villa has fallen into the hands of evil people. It’s time for me to leave.”

Zhen Yue lamented, “It’s very dangerous to go out to train alone. Now, there’s no Qin Yu to back you up.”

Yao Qing showed a trace of anguish.

Then, he said in a deep voice, “I’ve been relying too much on Mr. Qin during this period of time, so I haven’t made any progress for more than a year.”

“If I continue to cultivate, maybe... maybe I can help Mr. Qin. At the very least, I can kill Deng Sheng!”

Zhen Yue opened her red lips slightly, as if she wanted to say something, but in the end, she didn’t say anything and just nodded.

“Then I wish you a smooth journey,” Zhen Yue said.

Yao Qing grunted in gratitude, then turned around and left.

Zhen Yue was still the sect master of the Green Moon Villa, but she had long become a puppet.

The real sect master had long become Deng Sheng.

The only reason Deng Sheng kept Zhen Yue alive was that Zhen Yue still had a certain amount of prestige in the Green Moon Villa!

Even if Deng Sheng wanted to take over the Green Moon Villa, he had to seize power from Zhen Yue step by step.

In the center of the Green Moon Villa, there was a huge stone statue.

This stone statue looked exactly like Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s stone statue looked like a galiant man with starry eyes. He had a dignified bearing and looked like he was looking down on the world.

Deng Sheng looked up at this stone statue and sneered. “Qin Yu, I knew you would die sooner or later, but I didn’t expect you to die so quickly.”

“When I completely take back the Saint Confucian Sect, this stone statue of yours will disappear!”

...

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

This month, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had nurtured many experts, including eight newly advanced Martial Marquises!

There were even rumors that someone from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had stepped into the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm! His strength was only second to that of a Martial Saint!

This allowed the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to obtain unprecedented grandeur! Their prestige was further deepened!

During this period of time, the young masters of the various aristocratic families had stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm.

The outstanding ones among them had stepped into the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.

For example, Yan Jinyao, Kong Yun, and Chu Hedao.

With the death of Qin Yu, Jingdu seemed to have quietened down. Everything was progressing in a stable direction.

“Since Qin Yu’s death, Jingdu has become much more peaceful,” an old man on the rooftop of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association said quietly with his hands behind his back.

“Yeah, the appearance of this radical person really made us break out in cold sweat,” said Qu Xie, who was behind the old man.

The old man glanced at Qu Xie and said, “Jiang He was the first, then Qin Yu appeared. I wonder who will be next.”

Qu Xie sneered. “No matter who it is, we will crush it to death in the bud!”

“Moreover... The Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s strength is now at a higher level. Let alone the next Qin Yu, even if Qin Yu is still alive, he won’t be as much of a threat to us as before.”

The old man didn’t say anything and just nodded.

...

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Jiang He appeared in the Pavilion Master’s building.

The two of them looked at each other and sat there while sipping their tea.

“In the blink of an eye, more than a month has passed,” Jiang He sighed slightly. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Yes.” The Pavilion Master nodded her head.

“Time passes really quickly. I think those people in Jingdu must be very happy now,” said the Pavilion Master.

At this point, Jiang He suddenly paused and continued, “Ji Yuhong, do you really think Qin Yu is dead?”

When she heard this, the Pavilion Master’s hand that was holding the tea suddenly stopped in mid-air.

She put down the tea and said with a smile, “You and I should have the answer in our hearts.”

Jiang He couldn’t help but stroke his beard and laugh.

After a moment, Jiang He said in a low voice, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association already deeply detests Qin Yu. It’s not a bad choice for him to disappear now.”

“Mm.” The Pavilion Master agreed with this.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is already fed up with him. If Qin Yu continues, I don’t doubt that they will send a Martial Saint.”

“Yes.” Jiang He sighed.

He put down the teacup in his hand and said, “I hope Qin Yu can understand this logic and continue to hide.”

“By the way, have you seen Yan Yunheng recently?” Jiang He suddenly asked.

The Pavilion Master shook her head and said, “Ever since Qin Yu’s death, Yan Yunheng seemed to have disappeared. I sent people to investigate, but they didn’t find anything.”

“The companies he registered before have been canceled.”

Jiang He couldn’t help but frown slightly, as if he was a little worried.

However, the Pavilion Master smiled and said, “Old Mister Jiang, there’s no need to worry too much. Yan Yunheng is much more powerful than we imagined.”

Jiang He only nodded and didn’t ask any more questions.

...

Inside the Immortal Slaying Sect.

The man with the mustache was engraving some strange characters on the paper.

After an entire night, the man with the mustache finally finished.

He wiped his sweat and said excitedly, “We can set off now!”
