Qin Yu was stunned on the spot.

Half a second later, Qin Yu hurriedly grabbed Zhuo Jing’s arm and said anxiously, “What did you say? Xiao Hai went to the north? He... he forcefully crossed the Dead River?”

“That’s right.”Zhuo Jing nodded. “Senior Xiao Hai may be the first person to forcefully cross the Dead River.”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. He couldn’t understand why Xiao Hai was so anxious.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu expressed his gratitude to Zhuo Jing. Then, he hurriedly called Iron Egg and Qu Zhu, preparing to head to the northern border.

“I’ll go with you,”Zhuo Jing said.

Qin Yu glanced at Zhuo Jing and nodded. “Okay.”

Therefore, Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle. The group of four rode on the Divine Eagle and headed straight for the northern border.

This was a long process. Qin Yu was extremely anxious.

He did not know if he still had time to reach the northern border. He also did not know if Xiao Hai could hold on.

Qin Yu also did not have a clear understanding of Xiao Hai’s strength. He only knew that Xiao Hai was very powerful, but those godly monarchs were also not to be underestimated.

“With senior Xiao Hai’s strength, he should be able to return safely...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. He did not know if he was comforting himself or if he really thought so.

However, qu Zhu poured cold water on the matter by the side and said, “Naturally, there’s no need to say much about Xiao Hai’s strength. It’s just that forcefully crossing the river of death will place a huge burden on his body.”

“More importantly, after going to the northern lands, Xiao Hai’s strength will also be suppressed. In this way, it’s already not bad for Xiao Hai to be able to display 30-50% of his strength.”

Qin Yu looked at Qu Zhu with a solemn expression. He had a bad premonition in his heart.

Qu zhu sighed, “I’m afraid that Xiao Hai never thought he would come back.”

“I’m afraid that I will never be able to make his choice.”

Qin Yu did not say a word. He had never thought that Xiao Hai would make such a decision.

To fight against the entire northern lands by himself, such a feat could not be found in the entire southern province.

Along the way, many people were heading to the northern border.

It was obvious that this news had already spread, and many people were planning to go and watch the battle. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qin Yu did not say anything. He sat cross-legged on the back of the divine eagle, adjusting his internal QI and state of mind.

“Senior Xiao Hai, please hold on...”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Although he tried his best to adjust his state of mind, anxiety still showed on his face.

Qu Zhu put his hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “It’s useless for you to be anxious. Even if you go, you won’t be of much help. Neither of us can cross the Dead River.”

“Yes.”Of course, Qin Yu knew, but even if he knew some things, he still couldn’t suppress his heart.

After a few days, the group finally arrived at the northern border.

At this moment, many people had already arrived by the Dead River at the northern border.

Many of these people were the sect leaders of the various large sects. They stood on the other side of the Dead River and looked at the other side with a solemn expression. No one knew what they were thinking.

Even though they were all egoists, they were still moved at this moment.

The entire northern border was shaken to the point of rumbling. At a glance, one could see Xiao Hai’s undefeated posture despite fighting to the death. He was like a god of war, fighting against many northern land cultivators alone.

Everyone had a solemn expression on their faces. At this moment, they hoped that Xiao Hai could come back alive more than anyone else.

Qin Yu jumped down from the godly eagle and walked quickly to the Dead River.

He used the desolate God’s eye and looked straight at the other side of the Dead River.

On the other side, Xiao Hai’s broad and strong body was like a tall mountain, seemingly never to fall.

His long hair was fluttering wildly in the wild wind, and his arrogant fists were about to shatter the world.

When Qin Yu saw Xiao Hai’s face clearly, he could not help but be stunned.

“This face...”Qin Yu’s eyes widened.

This face was clearly the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!

Someone beside him seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s confusion and explained, “Don’t you know that Xiao Hai and the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect are blood brothers? They are of the same mother.”

Qin Yu was stunned.

Xiao Hai was actually a brother of the Tianyun sect? And a brother of the same mother?

No wonder he had been wearing a mask. He was probably trying to hide his face!

“Senior Xiao Hai is really our role model,”someone exclaimed.

“I wonder if senior Xiao Hai will be able to come back alive this time.”Someone Sighed.

Qin Yu did not say a word. With his desolate divine eyes, he could clearly see Xiao Hai on the other side of the Dead River.

The three godly monarchs joined forces to suppress Xiao Hai, but Xiao Hai’s fists were filled with invincible battle intent. Every punch was pushed to the limit!

Even the three godly monarchs seemed to be powerless as they retreated.

“Xiao Hai, you are very powerful, but you can not leave here alive!”A godly monarch shouted angrily.

Xiao Hai did not say a word. The only thing that responded to him was his incomparably powerful fist!

Every step he took seemed to be fusing with the Great Dao. This was the display of his battle intent exploding to the extreme!

Facing the three godly monarchs, Xiao Hai did not show any fear. Instead, he erupted with an extremely strong battle intent!

His fist pierced through the void and exploded over, almost shattering the entire world!

“Even if I am unable to shake the northern ruler, I will still kill the three of you today!”Xiao Hai’s voice was cold and powerful, and his aura made people unable to resist submitting!

What kind of words was this? Xiao Hai actually wanted to rely on his own strength to kill the three godly monarchs of the northern lands!

One had to know that the current Xiao Hai had already fought for several days, and was under the suppression of the northern lands!

No one doubted Xiao Hai’s ability. At this moment, everyone understood that Xiao Hai’s strength was far above the three madness and three uniques!

If he wanted to compete, he was afraid that no one in the entire southern region was his match!

“Xiao Hai, your strength is beyond imagination, but the Northern Lands’methods are definitely not something you can compare to!”A godly king roared furiously.

However, Xiao Hai did not say anything. The only thing that responded to them was that fist that shattered everything!

At this moment, Xiao Hai’s eyes exploded with a dense killing intent, causing the already incomparably cold northern lands to feel a bone-piercing chill!

The three godly monarchs also felt an extremely strong pressure. They had sacrificed too much in this battle. It was unknown how many northern lands cultivators had died at Xiao Hai’s hands.

Each of Xiao Hai’s punches had the sound of a dragon’s roar. No one knew what kind of dao technique this was. However, Qin Yu understood that this was Xiao Hai’s Dao. His Dao seemed to be born for dedication!

Under such battle intent, Xiao Hai was invincible. No one seemed to be able to resist him.

The three godly monarchs did not dare to hold back anymore. They raised their heads and roared angrily. They had actually borrowed the dao technique of the northern lands.

Ice spikes rose from the ground. This was a technique shared by the three godly monarchs. Tens of thousands of ice spikes condensed in the void. Any one of them could easily wipe out the mighty realm!

Several ice thorns condensed and headed straight for Xiao Hai’s glabella!
