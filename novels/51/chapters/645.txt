Chapter 646: Shocked Everyone! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xia Hang seemed to have made up his mind, and there was a hint of fear in his eyes.

Qin Yu didn’t die. To Xia Hang, it was like a bolt from the blue!

That meant that his daughter’s life might be in danger!

“President Qu, Qin Yu didn’t die. The black-robed man is Qin Yu!” Xia Hang said with a terrified expression.

However, Qu Xie couldn’t help but sneer. “Xia Hang, are you crazy? That black-robed man is Qin Yu? Are you out of your mind?”

“Although Qin Yu has a lot of potential, what qualifications does he have to kill nine super experts of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? And with just one slash?”

“Where does he get the ability to fight against eight black-gold-robed men?”

“In the whole world, no young man can do it! Not even Yan Jinyao!”

Qu Xie’s words were sonorous and powerful.

Xia Hang said desperately, “President Qu! Although I don’t want to believe it, it’s true! That black-robed man is Qin Yu!”

As he said that, someone suddenly walked in from outside the door.

It was none other than Yan Jinyao.

“Guys, what happened?” Yan Jinyao looked at the black-gold robe powerhouses covered in blood and couldn’t help but be surprised.

“Greetings, Young mentor Yan,” they greeted one after another.

Qu Xie smiled and said, “Young mentor Yan, you came at the right time. We sent eight black-gold robe powerhouses, but we still couldn’t take down that black-robed man. Not only did we let him escape, but we were also injured.”

Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but be surprised when he heard that.

“That black-robed man... has such strength?” Yan Jinyao exclaimed.

One had to know that even the current Yan Jinyao might not be able to escape from the hands of the eight black gold-robed men!

Qu Xie nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. That black-robed man’s strength is even stronger than we imagined. Young mentor Yan, you have to be careful.”

Yan Jinyao smiled and said, “I understand, President Qu.”

“Oh, right. Xia Hang just said that the black-robed man is Qin Yu,” Qu Xie said with a smile.

Hearing this, Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but sneer. “Vice President Xia, stop joking. Qin Yu? Does he have the ability to do that? Moreover, he is already dead.”

“It’s true!” Xia Hang explained anxiously.

“Qin Yu is really that black-robed man!”

Hearing this, Yan Jinyao couldn’t help but sneer. “Xia Hang, putting aside that Qin Yu is already dead, even if he isn’t dead, do you think he has such great abilities?”

“Not to mention him, but even I might not be able to do it!”

Obviously, no one believed that Qin Yu was the black-robed man.

After all, no one was willing to believe that Qin Yu had already achieved such prowess at his young age.

Xia Hang knew that his explanation was useless, and he didn’t know what to say for a moment.

He was very conflicted, but he was worried that his daughter would die in Qin Yu’s hands!

“I hope that Qin Yu doesn’t realize that this matter has something to do with me...” Xia Hang could only pray silently in his heart.

...

At this time, Qin Yu had already fled back to the room.

He had many wounds all over his body and his internal qi was weak. He was seriously injured.

As for that black robe, it was already in tatters like a rag.

“I almost died at their hands...” Qin Yu wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth, and his expression was somewhat unsightly.

At this moment, Qin Yu was also somewhat worried.

He was worried that his identity would be exposed. If that was the case, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would definitely mobilize their combat strength to kill him! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Xia Hang... you actually dared to set me up!” Qin Yu took a deep breath, and a trace of coldness flashed across his face!

He sat cross-legged on the ground while slowly healing the wounds on his body.

At this time, the outside world was already in an uproar!

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association sent out eight black-gold robe powerhouses, but they still couldn’t get rid of the black-robed man!”

“It is rumored that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association made comprehensive analysis and preparations to defeat the black-robed man, but they still returned in defeat!”

“Not only that, but three black-gold robe powerhouses from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were seriously injured!”

“It has been so many years since anyone could defeat the black-gold robe powerhouses. I really wonder where this black-robed man came from.”

For a moment, rumors spread everywhere. Not only did the Jingdu Martial Arts Association fail to establish its authority, but it was also even more humiliated.

...

In a certain teahouse in Jingdu, a few young mentors were also gathered together.

“You’ve all heard about the matter, right?” Zhuang Teng drank a mouthful of tea and asked rather casually.

“Eight black-gold robe powerhouses... What kind of battle strength is this? Yet they were still unable to kill that black-robed man.”

“I really wonder who this black-robed man is. He’s too terrifying.”

Even Kong Yun, who had always been arrogant, nodded slightly and said, “Mm, eight black-gold-robed men are enough to wipe out a family. This black-robed man is probably a reclusive old powerhouse.”

As he spoke, Yan Jinyao walked over from not far away.

When they saw Yan Jinyao, everyone greeted him.

“Young mentor Yan, you should have heard about it, right?” Zhuang Teng asked with a smile.

Yan Jinyao nodded slightly and said, “I just went to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association today. Guess what Xia Hang told me?”

“What? Could it be that he wants to capture the black-robed man?” Zhuang Teng said jokingly.

Yan Jinyao shook his head and sneered, “Xia Hang said that the black-robed man is Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu?” Everyone shook their heads.

“If Qin Yu is that black-robed man, then he is probably the number one person among the younger generation in Jingdu.”

“No young man can escape from the hands of the eight black-gold robe powerhouses.”

Even Yao Meng felt that it was somewhat impossible.

Those were eight black-gold robe powerhouses! Their strength was unimaginable!

Even if they wanted to capture an international criminal, they didn’t need to send out eight black-gold robe powerhouses!

“I also feel that it’s somewhat laughable.” Yan Jinyao scoffed.

“But then again, this black-robed person is probably linked to Qin Yu.” At this moment, Yan Jinyao changed the topic and said.

“What do you mean by that?” Everyone asked one after another.

Yan Jinyao snorted and said, “This black-robed person’s combat technique is quite similar to that of Qin Yu, and his physical body is equally powerful!”

“According to our speculation, this person must be related to Qin Yu. He is most likely here to take revenge for Qin Yu.”

Everyone came to a sudden realization, “No wonder he has such strength! So he is Qin Yu’s mentor!”

“To be able to teach a disciple like Qin Yu, he is naturally not an ordinary person. That makes sense.”

Even if Qin Yu revealed his signature techniques, no one suspected him.

...

At night, Xia Hang returned home in fear.

As soon as he pushed open the door, Xia Hang smelled the pungent smell of blood!

Qin Yu was sitting on the sofa!

Xia Hang’s expression changed drastically! He rushed inside in a hurry and shouted angrily, “Qin Yu, what did you do to my daughter?!”

Qin Yu glanced at Xia Hang coldly and raised his hand to slap his face!

Xia Hang got up from the ground and said angrily, “You dared to touch my daughter! I will kill you!”

His internal qi exploded and he walked towards Qin Yu!

“Dad, you’re back!”

At this moment, a little girl’s voice came from the room.

Xia Hang was stunned when he saw the little girl.

He quickly ran to the little girl’s side and touched her face to look left and right. He said with a terrified expression, “Daughter, are... are you okay?”
