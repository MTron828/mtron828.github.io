Chapter 1247: Chapter 1,247, news of the Holy Region 

In truth, Qin Yu was more anxious than anyone else.

He couldn’t wait to see Yan Ruoxue, and he couldn’t wait to go to the holy region to climb the peak.

Next, all the mighty figures began to search for the array flags.

It wasn’t just them. The entire martial world seemed to be waiting for the holy region to open.

But this process far exceeded everyone’s imagination.

In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.

However, during these three months, there was still no movement from the ancient array platform.

It was as if the holy region had been closed again, and no one had come again.

Many people in the martial arts world had already begun to give up. They were even secretly laughing at Qin Yu, laughing at him for giving up the only chance to step into the holy region.

The weather gradually turned cold, and many people put on cotton clothes.

As Qin Yu walked through the Heaven Gate, he began to feel somewhat worried.

“So much time has passed, and there’s still no news of the Holy Region. Could it be that it really won’t open again?”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, his face filled with grief.

The twenty mighty figures were on the verge of collapse.

“I can’t hold on any longer. The holy region this time is just a lie. I’ve given up. Let’s wait for the next opportunity.”

A powerful existence decisively stopped the loss and chose to seal his lifespan again.

“I already have no chance to seal it a second time. If I can’t step into the Holy Region, then I’d rather die!”

That night, a powerful existence forcefully barged into the holy mausoleum.

Mournful wails came from green earth park, indicating that the barging had failed.

The entire martial world seemed to have fallen into an unprecedented desolate state.

“Is this the golden era? Does the golden era want to isolate us from the outside world? ! The heavens are unfair!”Someone raised his head and shouted angrily.

There were also people who could not withstand such a blow and died from serious illness.

Qin Yu was a rare person who was relatively calm.

Although he was also looking forward to the holy region, giving up was never his character.

“Since the holy region hasn’t opened yet, I can’t just waste my time like this.”Qin Yu sighed softly.

In the time that followed, Qin Yu left the Heaven Gate.

He began to embark on a journey. He planned to travel the entire earth and find a path of cultivation for himself.

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, a year had passed.

Too many changes had occurred during this year. Out of the twenty mighty figures, eight chose to enter closed-door cultivation, three died, and two tried to break through forcefully and died under the heavenly tribulation.

Jiangnan, in an extremely unremarkable fly shop.

There was an old man dressed in shabby clothes who was leaning on a crab.

It was as if he hadn’t eaten for a long time, and his posture could be described as wild.

In front of him sat a youth with snow-white hair.

The youth looked to be in his thirties, but because of his white hair and his rather weathered appearance, he seemed to have aged a bit.

He held a small notebook in his hand and was carefully listening to the words of this beggar-like old man, just like a schoolboy.

“Seriously, he insisted on inviting a beggar to dinner and even wanted to reserve the restaurant,”the waiter mumbled as he carried the crab up.

This young man was none other than Qin Yu.

In the face of the waiter’s sarcasm, he did not have the slightest reaction. He was still carefully listening to the old man’s incessant chatter.

“Old Sir, please continue. I’m listening.”Qin Yu wrote and drew on the notebook, appearing extremely respectful. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The old man wiped the oil on his mouth, patted his stomach in satisfaction, and said, “I’m just a beggar who can’t eat. What can you get from me?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “The life of a hundred states is the life of a human field. From the emperor to the beggar, there’s not much difference.”

The old man’s eyes lit up when he saw this, as if no one had ever respected him so much.

He seemed to have opened up a chatterbox. His mouth was eloquent, and his words were full of truth and falsehood. It was quite mysterious.

Qin Yu listened with great interest. From time to time, he would write down something in his notebook.

In the past year, Qin Yu had visited a lot of people.

Just as he said, Qin Yu had visited everyone from the upper echelons to the beggars in the countryside.

He had recorded the lives and psychology of these people.

He had used a total of six notebooks alone.

This was a kind of cultivation, a cultivation of the state of mind.

Over a year’s time, Qin Yu’s state of mind had greatly improved.

It was also because Qin Yu could not use his spiritual power now, or else he would definitely step into a higher realm.

“Thinking back to the past, I also had a glorious time. When I went out, I always rode a Mercedes-benz. Big Brother, I bought eight!”The old man said with a thumbs up.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Old Sir, why do you need so many Big Brothers?”

“One for me, one for my wife, and one for each of my remaining six mistresses!”The old man said proudly.

The female attendant next to him stole a disdainful look and snorted lightly, “Old Shameless.”

The old man ignored her and continued to talk about the half-true and half-false glorious history.

From his glory to his decline, the old man seemed to be talking about history.

Qin Yu was envious from time to time and laughed from time to time. He was like an old friend to this beggar.

“Young man, let me tell you. In one’s life, all the glory is Bullsh * T. Dullness is the final destination.”The old man took a sip of wine.

“You see, although I am a beggar now, I am not worried. My whole family is not hungry after I eat my fill. I will definitely live to a ripe old age.”

Qin Yu gave him a thumbs up and said, “Old Sir, you’re so thorough.”

“Of course. Some things are enough once you have them,”the old man said happily.

“Look at those big bosses in suits. Do they have a chance to be beggars? They don’t!”The more the old man spoke, the more excited he became. His voice also became louder.

The waitress beside him seemed to be unable to continue listening. She first covered her ears, then turned on the television and turned up the volume.

“The latest news. An unknown group of people was found in the east continent today. It is rumored that they are related to the martial arts world.”

At this moment, news suddenly came from the television.

Qin Yu was stunned, then he hurriedly looked at the television.

He saw that the place that was being interviewed on the television was precisely the ancient colored array platform!

The ancient colored array platform was clearly the traces of someone’s movements, and there were cracks and footprints on it.

“Old Sir, you eat first, I won’t accompany you.”Qin Yu hurriedly threw down a thousand yuan, then ran out of the small restaurant in a hurry.
