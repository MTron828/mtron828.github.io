1863 Father’s Painstaking Efforts

Tong Haoyang’s corpse fiercely fell to the ground, creating a deep pit on the snow-white ground. Following that, blood started to flow out of the pit continuously.

Everyone was silent. It was as if no one had expected such an ending.

They were clearly evenly matched just now. However, in the blink of an eye, Tong Haoyang no longer had the strength to fight back.

Looking at Tong Haoyang, lying in a pool of blood, Qin Yu fell into silence and did not speak for a long time.

!!

After a moment, he sighed and said in a low voice, “Sigh! It seems it’s not that easy to control the primordial spirit.”

The people around were speechless. They didn’t expect what Qin Yu had in mind to have nothing to do with Tong Haoyang at all.

Such a heaven’s favorite did not seem to attract Qin Yu’s attention at all.

“Peak Master, when are we setting off?” Qin Yu looked at the peak master.

“The day after tomorrow,” the peak master said with a bitter smile.

“Alright,” Qin Yu nodded and said. He then cupped his hands and said, “Thank you very much.”

The peak master didn’t say anything else, but was even more doubtful about Qin Yu’s identity now.

The main door of the Martial Arts Hall widely opened, and everyone left.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer and immediately returned to his cave abode.

The entire Demon-slaying Peak was shocked by Qin Yu’s strength.

They began to compare Qin Yu with Jiu Xiao. Jiu Xiao, who used to be the number one of Demon-slaying Peak, seemed to be losing his position now.

“If they were to fight, I’m afraid Qin Yu would win!”

“That won’t happen. After all, Jiu Xiao’s cultivation realm is much more advanced than Qin Yu’s. Qin Yu would win if they were in the same cultivation realm.”

“But I feel it would be difficult for Jiu Xiao to defeat Qin Yu even now.”

Everyone chimed in and discussed endlessly. It had even become the topic of everyone’s after-meal conversation.

“Obviously, this kid has been playing dumb.”

“Ah! No wonder Chang Mang was so protective of him. It seems that Chang Mang is right.”

…

In the Tong family, no one knew that Tong Haoyang had died at this moment. They even had never thought of this possibility.

They shouldn’t be blamed for this. After all, Tong Haoyang was too strong. There was barely anyone in the younger generation who could match him.

Even the top princes in Zhongzhoun didn’t dare to say they could defeat him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

For the past few days, Tong Guangqing had been feeling very uncomfortable and had a gloomy face.

Uncle Guan, who was by his side, certainly understood his feelings.

No one would be willing to be disrespected by their own father, and Tong Guangqing was no exception.

“Don’t overthink. You must be the one Sir concerns the most,” Uncle Guan comforted him.

“I wish Tong Haoyang would die in Qin Yu’s hands!” Tong Guangqing gritted his teeth and said.

Uncle Guan sighed and said, “You and I both know it’s impossible. With Tong Haoyang’s skills, even I don’t have the confidence to win, let alone Qin Yu.”

Hearing this, Tong Guangqing became even angrier.

“I’ll get rid of Tong Haoyang sooner or later!” he said coldly.

“Is this your ambition?”

At this moment, Tong Lianyang walked in from outside.

Seeing Tong Lianyang, Tong Guangqing’s expression turned unnatural.

He quickly got up and said nervously, “Father… Father, I’m just talking nonsense. Please forgive me…”

Tong Lianyang didn’t say anything. He slowly walked up to the two.

His body exuded extremely terrifying pressure.

Under this terrifying pressure, Tong Guangqing and Uncle Guan felt extremely pressured. Their bodies trembled, and they could not help but kneel.

Tong Lianyang walked to the throne and sat down. He looked at Uncle Guan coldly and said, “How did you teach Guangqing?”

Uncle Guan’s mouth was agape, and his forehead was full of sweat. He didn’t dare to say much and could only say in a trembling voice, “It’s… It’s all my fault…”

Tong Lianyang snorted coldly. He waved his hand, and a terrifying force directly shook Uncle Guan to cough out blood. He was even forced to step back repeatedly.

Uncle Guan couldn’t care less about his injuries. He got up again and knelt in front of Tong Lianyang.

Seeing this, Tong Guangqing couldn’t hold it in any longer. He glared at Tong Lianyang and shouted, “It’s your problem. Why did you blame it on Uncle Guan?”

Uncle Guan’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly rebuked, “Young master, don’t talk nonsense!”

However, how would Tong Guangqing, who lost his mind, listen to him? He glared at Tong Lianyang and said, “If you have the ability, kill me today and Tong Haoyang will be your ideal son! Otherwise, you’ll have to give me the treatment and respect I deserve!”

The atmosphere in the room instantly became tense. Tong Lianyang did not say a word and only looked at Tong Guangqing coldly.

Uncle Guan didn’t even dare to breathe as sweat dripped down his forehead like rain.

After a while, Tong Lianyang shook his head.

He looked at Tong Guangqing in front of him and said indifferently, “My blood flows in your body. No one can compare to you.

“Tong Haoyang can only be considered as the Tong family’s mountain guardian at best. All these years, I’ve tried to get close to the nine great aristocratic families, but I’ve been ignored. If this continues, the Tong family will only be wiped out.

“After I die, how will you face the other aristocratic families’ division and nibbling?”

Tong Guangqing was stunned when he heard Tong Lianyang’s words.

...

“I don’t have much time left.” At this moment, Tong Lianyang threw out a piece of shocking news.

“If I can’t form a strong descendant in a short time, no one can protect you.”

Tong Guangqing’s mouth was agape, and his expression instantly turned ugly.

“Father, you…” Tong Guangqing opened his mouth, not knowing what to say for a moment.

“Remember, Tong Haoyang is for paving the way for you. I’ve planted a mark inside his body. No matter how strong he becomes in the future, he will have to be loyal to our Tong family,” Tong Lingyang continued.

“Today, I’m in control of him. After I leave, you will be the person in control.”

After hearing Tong Lianyang’s words, Tong Guangqing’s body limped and he could not help but fall to the ground.

Tong Lianyang had lived for thousands of years. In these thousands of years, he had been working his heart out for the Tong family.

Now that he was near the end of his life, he tried to break through to the True Saint cultivation realm but failed in the end.

“That token contains a great secret and opportunity. It’s also the only capital for our Tong family’s comeback,” suddenly, Tong Lianyang changed the subject and said coldly.

“No matter what the price is, we must get the token back. As long as we can open the secret of the Forbidden Zone, the Tong family will become a top aristocratic family in the Holy Region!

...

After saying this, Tong Lianyang stood up and walked out.

Sitting there, dumbfounded, Tong Guangqing did not speak for a long time.

“Now you understand Sir’s good intentions.” Uncle Guan could not help but sigh.

Tong Guangqing didn’t say anything. He had mixed feelings in his heart. He didn’t know whether he was sad for his insensibility or disappointed in his own incompetence.
