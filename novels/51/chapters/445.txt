Chapter 446: Half-step Martial Marquis Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu tried to sense Fang Yue’s internal qi, but her internal qi was extremely weak.

Although it was not fatal, it would be difficult to think about it in a short period of time.

Then, Qin Yu tried to transfer spiritual energy to Fang Yue, but it was still useless.

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu frowned.

He had never seen such a situation and was at a loss for a moment.

“Qin Yu, are you hurt?”

At this moment, Old Mister Yan walked over from not far away.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I’m fine, but I’m afraid that everyone else isn’t.”

The expressions of the people who were relaxed just now changed drastically.

“We are not fine? What... What do you mean?” Everyone hurriedly ran over.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Just now, He Teng and Meng Wuxiong planted a mark in your bodies. This mark has a strong poison and can kill you at any time.”

“What? How could this be?!”

“Die at any time? Then... Then when is it?”

“What kind of mark is this? How should we treat it?”

Everyone looked at Qin Yu with eyes full of fear.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “How about this? Everyone wait for my news. I will find time to go to the Central Plains and ask He Teng about it.”

“At the same time, I will also try to refine pills for everyone.”

Old Mister Yan nodded at the side and said, “Qin Yu was an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion before.”

“So you are an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? What an honor!”

The big-bellied man also laughed embarrassedly and said, “I thought you were just a martial artist. I didn’t expect you to have such an impressive identity...”

“Qin Yu, you must save us. Our lives are in your hands!”

“Yes, as long as you can save us, we will definitely remember you as an adult!”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Don’t worry, everyone. I have already said it, so I will definitely be responsible for everyone.”

After such an incident happened, they obviously didn’t have the mood to have fun anymore.

Therefore, on the same day, everyone planned to set off and return. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After boarding the boat, Qin Yu and Old Mister Yan stayed in the most luxurious suite.

“Qin Yu, what exactly is the mark you mentioned?” Old Mister Yan asked.

Qin Yu drank a mouthful of water and said indifferently, “It’s a lie. I’m just bullsh*tting.”

“Lie?!” Old Mister Yan was instantly stunned.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “There isn’t any mark at all. But these people are all ordinary rich people. They definitely value their lives very much.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu paused for a moment and said jokingly, “Old Mister Yan, didn’t you say that rich people will also be deceived? It’s just that the method is different.”

Old Mister Yan immediately laughed out loud.

“Qin Yu, you’re really something.” Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but shake his head.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I have no choice. If I want to go to Jingdu, I definitely can’t just rely on myself.”

“When I return, I plan to immediately establish my own sect and aristocratic family.”

This sect and aristocratic family was born to fight against the Yan family and the Han family!

As for whether it would succeed or not, that was another matter.

...

The ship slowly sailed on the sea.

On this return trip, everyone’s attitude toward Qin Yu was clearly much better.

They, afraid that Qin Yu would forget them, all left their business cards.

However, Qin Yu’s mind was not on this.

All he could think about was the Dragon Spirit and the Divine Dragon Power in his body.

After possessing the Divine Dragon power and the Venerable Fifth Mountain, Qin Yu felt strong confidence.

He even felt that he could fight against a half-step Martial Marquis.

“Han Wei seems to be a half-step Martial Marquis, right?” The corner of Qin Yu’s mouth curled into a sneer.

“Han Wei, wait for me in Jingdu. I’ll personally wring your head off!”

Other than that, Qin Yu also planned to make a trip to Dongchuan.

Meng Wuxiong was able to create a large number of Inner Strength Grandmasters, so he must have some secret treasure.

If he could step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm before September 9th, then Han Wei wouldn’t be a threat.

...

Fang Yue didn’t wake up during the three days of the return journey.

Her internal qi was extremely weak, but her life was not in danger.

Three days later, the cruise ship finally returned to Sea City.

“Old Mister Yan, you have to be careful during this period of time,” Qin Yu reminded him as he got off the ship.

Old Mister Yan nodded and said, “I understand.”

“Of course, I will do my best to attract the Yan family’s attention to me,” Qin Yu comforted him.

Old Mister Yan smiled bitterly and said, “Thank you.”

Li Zinan was waiting quietly near the lavish cruise ship.

There was a huge waist tag hanging on his waist.

On the waist tag were the few words: Saint Confucian Sect!

“Elder Li, that lavish cruise ship seems to have returned,” An Inner Strength Grandmaster beside him said at this time.

Li Zinan snorted lightly and said, “How is that possible? It’s only been a week, and their trip will take half a month!”

“Elder Li! They’re really back!” Someone pointed at the cruise ship and shouted.

Li Zinan took a closer look and realized that it really was a lavish cruise ship!

Qin Yu and Old Mister Yan were helping themselves off the cruise ship!

“This fast?” Li Zinan sneered.

Then, he quickly stood up and walked toward Qin Yu.

The five peak Inner Strength Grandmasters quickly surrounded Qin Yu and Old Mister Yan.

“You still haven’t left?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

Li Zinan narrowed his eyes and said, “Because of you b * stard, Mr. Yan scolded me!”

“I originally wanted to let you live. Since you’re so ungrateful, then don’t blame me for being merciless!”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Li Zinan, I deliberately let you live last time. Why aren’t you grateful?”

“Let me live? Go to h*ll!” Li Zinan sneered.

“You have already been seriously injured by me, yet?you still dare to boast?!”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Why haven’t you thought about whether I did it on purpose?”

“On purpose?” Li Zinan’s expression changed slightly, then he waved his hand and said, “Impossible! Don’t bluff!”

“You guys, kill him!”

“Yes!”

The four Inner Strength Grandmasters immediately rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu glanced at them, then suddenly raised his palm and slapped them!

A huge palm appeared out of thin air, and a golden light directly pierced through the four people!

“Boom!”

The four of them died on the spot!

A single strike killed three to four Inner Strength Grandmasters!! What kind of technique was this?!

Li Zinan’s face paled!

Didn’t they say that Qin Yu was already crippled?! Could it really be a lie?!

“Oh no! I’ve been deceived!”

Li Zinan secretly cursed, and turned around to run!

But unfortunately, Qin Yu instantly blocked Li Zinan’s path.

“You want to run?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Li Zinan swallowed hard. He braced himself and said, “Qin Yu, you... you better not do anything reckless! I am now an Elder of the Saint Confucian School!”

“So?” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Li Zinan snorted coldly. “Do you know what it means to attack an Elder? It means that you will offend the entire Saint Confucian School!”

“And the Saint Confucian Sect is full of half-step Martial Marquises, and even Martial Marquises!”
