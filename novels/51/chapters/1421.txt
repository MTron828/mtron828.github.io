Chapter 1422: Chapter 1422, Heavenly Cloud Sect’s unforeseen event 1

Seeing Zhuo Jing return, Qin Yu quickly walked over.

“Brother Zhuo, how is it?”Qin Yu asked with some anticipation.

Zhuo Jing’s face, however, revealed a trace of solemnity.

He pulled Qin Yu to sit down, and then said in a deep voice, “I’ll tell you some bad news.”

“Bad News?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Zhuo jingen said, “In these few days, something happened in the Heavenly Cloud sect. The sect master suddenly announced that he would go into closed-door cultivation. The sect will be temporarily handed over to the first elder.”

As soon as he said this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately became a bit ugly.

In the entire heavenly cloud sect, the person who hated Qin Yu the most was probably the first elder.

If he were to take control of the Heavenly Cloud sect, he would definitely pursue Qin Yu with all his might! It was very likely that he would not care about the consequences!

“Why is he so sudden...”qin yu frowned and muttered softly.

Zhuo jing sneered, “Is there even a need to say that? The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is obviously afraid of the faction behind you, but he had no choice but to attack you, so he simply chose to avoid the limelight.”

“If nothing happens, that’s naturally for the best. If anything happens, the first elder will take the blame.”

Zhuo Jing’s analysis had to be said to be very reasonable.

He was in closed-door cultivation at this time, obviously afraid.

Qin Yu’s face was gloomy, and for a moment, she didn’t know what to do.

“Let’s Wait a little longer and see if the first elder makes any moves,”said Qin Yu.

Zhuo Jing shook his head and said, “I advise you not to wait. Once he gives the full order, you won’t be able to run away.”

Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Brother Zhuo, do you have any good ideas?”

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “I’ll arrange for you to leave the South Province now. Recently, the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s vigilance has been relaxed a lot. There should be no problem.”

The teleportation array formation wasn’t something that ordinary people could afford.

The activation of an array formation required a large number of teleportation stones, and these teleportation stones were extremely precious. It was said that the value of a single teleportation was at least ten million spirit coins, and it was priceless. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even if you had money, you might not be able to activate the teleportation array formation.

“Brother Qin, we can’t afford to waste time. I’ll set off now,”Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Alright. Then you have to be careful.”

Zhuo Jing didn’t say anything else. He turned around and left the Zhuo family again.

Zhuo Jing only rushed back the next day.

He said with a gloomy face, “We’re still a step too late. The Great Elder has already started the operation.”

Qin Yu looked at Zhuo Jing and waited for his follow-up.

Zhuo Jing continued, “The great elder has ordered to seal off all the teleportation arrays and to strictly investigate all the people coming and going. All the major cities in the South Province have also been placed under surveillance. Even the vicinity of the divine capital city are all people from the Tianyun sect.”

“The great elder is determined to get rid of you this time.”Zhuo Jing raised his head and looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked around and said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “Fortunately, they don’t know that I’m hiding here.”

However, Zhuo Jing was not as optimistic as Qin Yu. He shook his head and said, “It’s not safe here either. You have to leave the South Province immediately.”

“As far as I know, the great elder has already sent people to check on anyone who had an affair with you.”

As he was speaking, a voice suddenly came from outside.

Zhuo Jing’s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly looked at Qin Yu and said, “Quick, go to the cellar and hide!”

Zhuo Jing stretched out his palm and a ray of light lit up.

This ray of light pointed towards a certain direction of the Zhuo family.

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent and hurriedly shot towards that Ray of light.

After rushing all the way to the cellar, Qin Yu opened the door of the cellar and jumped down.

This cellar was much deeper than he had imagined. When he landed, there was a loud bang.

The surroundings were pitch-black, without any light.

Fortunately, Qin Yu had the desolate divine eyes, so he could see through everything in the darkness.

Outside.

Zhuo Jing released his spiritual sense, covering more than half of the Zhuo family.

Soon, two figures walked over from not far away.

They were two beautiful figures with extraordinary looks. One of them was Li Yingying, whom Qin Yu knew.

“Why are you here?”Seeing Li Yingying, Zhuo Jing was a little surprised.

Li yingying smiled and said, “What’s wrong? Can’t I Come?”

Zhuo Jing shook his head and said, “No, I’m just a little surprised.”

After saying that, Zhuo Jing brought Li Yingying to the pavilion and sat down.

Because the Zhuo family didn’t have any servants, Zhuo Jing had to do everything himself.

He poured a cup of tea for Li Yingying and said with a smile, “I’m afraid that you have something to do with your sudden visit.”

Li Yingying took a sip of tea, then, she said in a deep voice, “Have you heard about what happened in the Tianyun sect recently? The great elder seemed to have gone crazy. He mobilized almost all the people of the Tianyun sect, as well as all the secret treasures, and vowed to find Qin Yu.”

Zhuo jingen answered, “I just heard about it.”

“We have met him once before. It’s very likely that we will get into trouble.”Li Yingying sighed.

Then, she said with some hidden bitterness, “I thought this Qin Yu was a promising talent with a limitless future. Who knew that he was an idiot? Because of him, we got into trouble. As expected, geniuses are easily killed.”
