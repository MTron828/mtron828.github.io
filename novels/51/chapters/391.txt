Chapter 392: Martial Arts Association’s Requisition Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After killing Qiao Wu, Qin Yu turned around and returned to the vicinity of the stone tablet in Qinghe town.

Yao Qing and Tao Zi stood there at a loss. With their strength, it was impossible for them to catch up with Qin Yu.

“Will anything happen to Mr. Qin...” Yao Qing swallowed hard and said with some fear.

Tao Zi glared at him and berated, “Shut your mouth!”

Yao Qing whispered, “I’m just afraid that there might be a trap...”

As he was speaking, Qin Yu slowly walked back from not far away.

“Let’s go,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

Yao Qing hurriedly ran up and asked tentatively, “Mr. Qin, did you... kill him?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded.

Taozi couldn’t help but praise, “There were three peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters... I can’t even imagine it!”

Qin Yu ignored them and continued walking forward.

“Mr. Qin, where are we going now?” Yao Qing asked.

“Bai City,” Qin Yu said.

Qin Yu had set up a spiritual energy gathering formation in Bai City, and it had been almost a year now.

There should be a lot of spiritual energy in the spiritual energy gathering formation. It was time to go back and take a look.

The next day, the three of them rushed back to Bai City from Qinghe town.

The spiritual energy gathering formation was set up in a tourist area. After such a long time, a lot of people must have already visited by now.

However, what made Qin Yu unhappy was that when they arrived at the tourist area, they found that it wasn’t open for business at all.

Looking at the various facilities that had been completed a long time ago, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little baffled.

“How can it not be open for business after such a long time?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

When they reached the door, the security staff quickly stopped Qin Yu.

“This place isn’t open for business. You guys should go somewhere else,” said the man who opened the door.

Qin Yu pointed to the tourist area and said, “My name is Qin Yu. I’m the boss here.”

“Boss?” The man scratched his head and seemed a little puzzled.

Qin Yu ignored him and continued to ask, “This place has been completed for over a year, right? Why hasn’t it opened yet?”

The man said, “It seems to have been requisitioned, so the opening has been delayed.”

“Requisitioned? Which company requisitioned it?” Qin Yu asked.

The man smiled embarrassedly and said, “Don’t ask me about that. I’m just a gatekeeper.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He led Yao Qing and the others to enter the door.

The man hurriedly stopped Qin Yu and said, “You’d better register yourself, in case something unexpected happens.”

Qin Yu nodded. He followed the man to the security room to register his name and then walked in the direction of the spiritual energy gathering formation.

Soon, the three of them arrived near the spiritual energy gathering formation.

This place had been rebuilt according to Qin Yu’s request.

High walls were built around it, and there was a medium-sized villa inside to rest.

Qin Yu walked to the door. He tried to push it open, but found that the door was locked.

“Someone actually locked my own home?” Qin Yu was instantly furious. He immediately grabbed the iron lock and forcefully broke it into two pieces.

The door opened, but what surprised Qin Yu was that there wasn’t even the slightest bit of spiritual energy here!

It had been close to a year, yet he couldn’t feel any spiritual energy? How was this possible?

“Who let you in?!”

At this moment, a middle-aged man walked quickly towards Qin Yu. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qin Yu looked at the middle-aged man coldly and said, “I should be the one asking you this. Without my permission, who let you come to my home?”

“Your home?” The middle-aged man sized up Qin Yu.

“This place has already been requisitioned. Now, it belongs to the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association! Return your home?” The middle-aged man sneered.

“The Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association’s base? Requisitioned my house without my permission? Who gave you the right?” Qin Yu’s expression became colder and colder.

The middle-aged man said impatiently, “Stop talking nonsense and get out quickly. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

After saying that, he reached out to push Qin Yu.

Qin Yu immediately grabbed his wrist and threw him out.

The middle-aged man fell heavily to the ground. Waves of pain came from all over his body.

“You... You dared to hit me? Do you know who I am?” The middle-aged man roared angrily.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “Go back and tell your association’s president to come apologize to me and discuss the issue of compensation.”

“Well then! Just you wait!” The middle-aged man pointed at Qin Yu and turned to run.

“D*mn, the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association is really overbearing.” Yao Qing couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “They entered my house without permission and stole my spiritual energy gathering formation. They better give me a reasonable explanation.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and walked into the villa.

The huge villa wasn’t empty. All kinds of furniture and facilities had been moved in.

A private movie theater, gym, and so on.

At a glance, it looked like a resort.

“These petty thieves really know how to enjoy themselves,” Yao Qing muttered as he laid on the massage chair.

Taozi, on the other hand, appeared a little reserved as she stood there at a loss.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “Find yourself a room to rest in. You guys can stay here temporarily from now on.”

The reason they chose this place was because the natural spiritual energy here was quite rich, and the location was large enough.

Since it wasn’t open for business, Qin Yu decided to remove this tourist area and convert it into private houses.

As for what he wanted to do, no one knew.

Qin Yu inspected the villa and found clothes in many rooms.

These clothes were casually thrown on the table and the bed in an extremely indecent way.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and a hint of displeasure flashed across his face.

After the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association requisitioned it, it was used to do these sorts of things?

It was simply outrageous!

After Qin Yu cleaned up these indecent things, he laid down on the sofa.

He took out his phone and opened the Martial Arts Forum.

On the forum, there were still discussions about Qin Yu.

And the key words in these discussions were mostly “Son-in-law of the Yan family,” “Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” “Lower Class’ Rebellion,” and so on.

Even after such a long time, there were still people who admired Qin Yu for climbing the stairway to heaven.

As he looked at these contents, the corners of Qin Yu’s mouth couldn’t help but curl up into a smile.

“It’s time to take advantage of such high popularity to do something,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After experiencing so many things, Qin Yu understood a principle.

There was a limit to relying on one person’s strength. Of course, it was no problem for him to enjoy fortune himself, but if he wanted to take down the aristocratic families in Jingdu, he definitely couldn’t do it by himself.

Hence, Qin Yu also intended to create his own alliance and forces.

At that moment, Qin Yu saw a post.

The title of the post was “Pyro’s Potential Martial Artist Rankings” .
