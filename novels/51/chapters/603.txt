Yan Gui hurriedly stood in front of Yan Jinyao.

“Yan Jinyao, don’t take this risk. If he really is the sect master, then we...”

“He definitely isn’t,” Yan Jinyao said with a cold smile.

“Captain Yan, if he was the sect master, he would have subdued us already. Why wait until now?!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

He could only slowly turn around and spread out his hands. “Today, I am your ancestor. I, Qin Yu, will accept this great gift.”

When they saw Qin Yu’s face, the atmosphere instantly fell into awkwardness.

The entire crowd was silent. For a moment, no one reacted.

“You lost.” At this moment, Yao Meng looked at Kong Yun with a smile.

Only after saying this did everyone come back to their senses.

This so-called sect master... was actually Qin Yu? !

In other words... so many people had been played by Qin Yu?

“Qin Yu, you’re courting death!” Yan Jinyao instantly flew into a rage!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Young Master Yan, you are the heir of the Yan family, so I didn’t expect you to kneel down with me.”

Yan Jinyao said coldly, “Qin Yu, I will never forgive you for such humiliation. I will kill you!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “F * ck you. Do you think I’m afraid of you?”

For a moment, everyone was furious!

They were all member of Jingdu’s upper class.

Now, they knelt down to Qin Yu. How could they not be angry?!

“Qin Yu, you actually didn’t die,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and said with a nonchalant smile, “Yes, surviving a great disaster is bound to bring good fortune. I never thought that I would appear before you guys.”

Yan Guiyi narrowed his eyes and said, “I was almost tricked by you... but unfortunately, you still have to die here today!”

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to Yan Guiyi anymore. His body shook, and he arrived in front of Chang Mang.

“How are you? Are you okay?” Qin Yu asked as he transferred the spiritual energy to Chang Mang.

Chang Mang wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth while looking like he was in extreme pained.

However, he pretended to be tough and said, “I’m fine. Help me up. I want to kill them...”

Qin Yu patted Chang Mang’s shoulder and said, “Lie here obediently. If we fight with them now, we will definitely lose.”

Chang Mang’s expression was also a bit ugly. He thought of the intense pain brought by the bracelet and couldn’t help but feel a lingering fear.

Qin Yu stood up and looked at Yan Guiyi and the others.

“Why don’t we make a deal?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Yan Guiyi raised his eyebrows and sneered. “Make a deal? Qin Yu, what can you offer in exchange for your life?”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “I came here before you guys, so of course I took everything in this place.”

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically! They came here from thousands of miles away for the treasures of the Immortal Slaying Sect!

Now that Qin Yu was one step ahead of them, how could they not be angry?!

“How about this? You let us go, and I’ll give you the treasures.” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

“Hehe, Qin Yu, don’t think about it As long as we kill you, this treasure will still be ours.” Yan Jinyao said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t panic. He said with a nonchalant smile, “The treasures have already been hidden by me. If you kill me, you will never find it.”

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and said, “Then... I don’t want it anymore!”

After saying that, Yan Jinyao flashed and instantly appeared in front of Qin Yu!

The internal qi in his hand was extremely terrifying. It shook the entire Immortal Slaying Sect to the point that it was buzzing!

Qin Yu snorted coldly and said, “I also want to see what you are capable of!”

Golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body, and the terrifying golden light illuminated the entire seabed!

“Boom!”

The two fists collided at this moment! Waves of air spread out in all directions with the two of them as the center!

This was the second time that the two of them had exchanged blows! Both of them took three steps back!

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and said, “You have some ability, but unfortunately, if you only have up your sleeve, you are no match for me.”

“Is that so?!” Qin Yu took a step forward aggressively!

His hair flapped wildly, and his blood was boiling!

“Yan Jinyao, it’s time for your position as the number one person to change hands!” Qin Yu shouted.

After saying that, Qin Yu stepped forward again!

He clenched his golden fist and smashed it at Yan Jinyao with a crushing force!

Yan Jinyao wasn’t afraid at all. He gathered the inner strength in his body and chose to fight head-on with Qin Yu again!

However, this time, Yan Jinyao didn’t get the upperhand. His fist shattered and his body took a few steps back!

“You, the number one person, are only so-so!” Qin Yu snorted coldly.

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and sneered. “I know that your body is strong, but I have 10,000 ways to avoid your body and kill you!”

“Then you can try it!” Qin Yu shouted.

Just as Qin Yu was about to attack for the third time, the bracelet began to shine again.

The terrifying force instantly covered Qin Yu.

The intense pain caused Qin Yu to collapse to the ground again and caused Qin Yu’s entire body to tremble incessantly.

He tried to stand up, but he discovered that the strength on the bracelet was getting stronger and stronger!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. He gritted his teeth and sneered. “So you, the number one person, also have to rely on despicable methods...”

Yan Jinyao didn’t seem to mind at all. He sneered and said, “The winner takes all! Qin Yu, as long as you can win, any method is noble!”

Before he finished his words, Yan Jinyao summoned a ray of light and smashed it at Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

The ground was smashed through! Under the pain from the bracelet, Qin Yu had no way to dodge at all!

His body was seriously injured again, and he was dripping with blood!

Yan Guiyi sneered and said, “Qin Yu, this is your ending.”

“Hand over the treasure of the Immortal Slaying Sect, and I might consider letting you die a quick death,” Yan Guiyi said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and sneered. “I hid the treasure... in your grave!”

Yan Guiyi’s pupils dilated, and he shouted angrily, “You’re courting death!”

His fist smashed towards Qin Yu’s face fiercely, forcing Qin Yu to retreat.

At this time, He Teng walked forward and said with a nonchalant smile, “Captain Yan, leave it to me. I have ten thousand ways to torture him and make him suffer a fate worse than death.”

Yan Guiyi glanced at He Teng and said coldly, “Don’t disappoint me again this time.”

“Don’t worry,” He Teng said with a sinister smile.

Then, He Teng walked toward Qin Yu step by step. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He looked down at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, I admit that you are capable, but sometimes, the key factor of success or failure has little to do with your ability.”

“For example, right now, you are tormented by this bracelet. How are you going to deal with me?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “What a sissy. You talk too much nonsense.”

He Teng said with a nonchalant smile, “Okay, then I will satisfy you.”

“Crack!.”

However, at this moment, a crisp sound suddenly came.

“Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!!”

Then, cracking sounds spread throughout the hall!

The bracelets on everyone’s wristss were broken!
