Chapter 2586: Intelligence Evolution

As both of them were chosen by Revered Qi, they knew what each other possessed.

Looking at the “seed” in her soul, Hua Qianje suddenly shivered and retracted all her messy thoughts.

This seed could save her but could also destroy her.

A method a Saint had spent so much effort to set up would not be so simple. As an old woman who had lived for many years, she knew that these people’s schemes were not something she could speculate.

“Hmm? Three hundred meters northeast, there is an outsider. His Saint Power of the soul is not weak, much stronger than these people.”

Ni Fei suddenly said.

“You can actually see so far?”

Hua Qianjie was surprised.

“All the power of my soul has strengthened my eyes. I can see very far.”

Ni Fei smiled and explained.

“What kind of ‘seed’ did this old fart get?”

Hua Qianjie was a little mad. Ni Fei had been reporting to her after meeting up with her.

The reason why she could absorb such a vast amount of Saint power was also related to Ni Fei.

However, what surprised her was that Ni Fei did not want these people’s Saint power of the soul. This made Hua Qianje feel very uneasy, not knowing what mission he had.

“Forget it. I don’t care. I’ll strengthen myself first. Only when I’m strong can I have the capital to speak.”

Hua Qianjie moved in the direction that Ni Fei pointed at. Her speed was comparable to that of a Lightning Leopard, so she caught the outsider almost instantly.

“Another one. Looks like we can advance even faster. We’re still too slow.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ni Fei shook his head.

“An outsider from the demon race. This guy only strengthens his body, which is perfect for dealing with the bear demon. However, it will take another day or two. I need to gather some strength first.”

“It’s a waste of time. We might fall behind other outsiders.” Ni Fei shook his head.

“Ji Tianming already has methods to deal with these demonic beasts, but he died in the bear demon’s territory. This means that there must be other changes here. If you want to die, you can go yourself. I don’t mind.”

Hua Qianjie laughed coldly. The fear of dying for the first time was too real.

If it wasn’t for the technique of “seed” storage that had saved her life, she would not have had the chance to roam freely in this Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom now.

To her, being twice as cautious would not be excessive.

During the two days of hunting, Qin Yu infused a portion of his Saint power into his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

He sensed a force continuously condensing within his Nine Heavens

Manifestations Gaze. It was as if with his will, this energy could erupt.

However, the Saint power this pupil required was incredibly shocking. Qin Yu had killed nearly ten demonic beasts in the past two days.

The pupil had swallowed half of the Saint power but had only condensed a trace of strength. This made Qin Yu very doubtful.

He could also make significant progress if he used this power to strengthen his body.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu suddenly heard the sound of light footsteps.

While his body was strengthened, with his current hearing, he could detect sounds from a hundred meters away, accompanied by the smell of blood.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. That place was the territory of the bear demon.

Thinking of the terrifying power of the bear demon’s body, Qin Yu felt a chill down his spine.

He went to take a look. Anywvay, the Seal of Heaven Returning had already completed its cooldown. In addition, Ji Tianming’s dragon remains were also with him at this moment. Even if there was danger, he should be able to retreat safely. Moreover, if the smell of blood belonged to the Black Bear King, the benefit would definitely be more than killing 50 demonic beasts if it was injured.

Qin Yu thought to himself.

He slowly walked toward that place. Right now, his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze was accumulating energy as if this energy would explode the moment he opened it.

Therefore, he could not use it.

When he reached that place, drops of blood dripped down from a huge tree. An unconscious person was hanging on one of the thick branches.

Qin Yu was stunned. Who else could it be but Shen Qian?

His expression suddenly changed drastically. At this moment, he could see a penetrating wound in Shen Qian’s abdomen.

At this moment, his internal qi had withered to the extreme. Qin Yu ran toward a bear demon.

After heavily injuring a young bear demon, he grabbed the bear demon and returned to the original spot.

“Shen Qian, use more strength on your hand.”

Qin Yu placed the bone spike in Shen Qian’s hand and pointed the other tip at the Black Bear King’s heart.

He dared not help Shen Qian either because he did not know if he would attract the Saint power to himself.

At this moment, Shen Qian seemed to have regained some consciousness.

Her slender arm trembled slightly, and she finally stabbed the bone spike into it, killing the bear demon.

A surge of Saint power entered her body, and her tremendously dispirited internal qi slowly eased up.

“Brother Qin Yu?”

Shen Qian opened her eyes slightly and asked.

“Take a rest first. Don’t talk.”

Qin Yu tore off a strip of cloth from his clothes and wrapped it tightly around her abdomen.

A huge vibration suddenly sounded and spread to the branches.

A pair of bright yellow eyes appeared in the depths of the forest, and a massive bear’s body slowly revealed.

Cold sweat appeared on Qin Yu’s forehead. Just now, he killed the demonic beast in the Black Bear King’s territory and was detected by this terrifying Bear King.

As the Bear King approached, Qin Yu gritted his teeth and opened a corner of Ji Tianming’s bag. Then, he stuffed it on Shen Qian’s back.

“Take this bag, and don’t move.”

Then, he decisively jumped to the other side. Even if he died, he still had the Seal of Heaven Returning.

However, if Shen Qian were to face this Bear King, she would definitely be injured even if she did not die.

Facing this silly and cute girl who had experienced life and death together with him, Qin Yu could not be ruthless.

“What happened?”

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks. The Black Bear King actually ignored her.

Instead, he sniffed at the bear demon’s corpse on the ground and then sniffed it hard a few times with his nose.

“Boom!”

Suddenly, the Black Bear King slammed into the tree.

With a crack, the tree nearly three to four people thick cracked.

Countless branches and leaves instantly fell from the tree. Fortunately, Shen Qian regained consciousness and grabbed the branches. Otherwise, she would have fallen.

“What happened? Could it be that the bag had lost its effect? But it’s only been two days, and the smell hasn’t changed at all!”

Qin Yu was shocked.

“That’s not right. This Bear King’s intelligence seems to have elevated.”

At this moment, Qin Yu felt a chill run down his spine as he looked at the Bear King which immediately hid far away after slamming into it.

After the clash, the source of the dragon saliva did not respond.

It roared angrily..
