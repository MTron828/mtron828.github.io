Chapter 2587: Going All Out

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The spiritual intelligence of the demonic beast did not advance easily, especially formidable ones like the Black Bear King with such a terrifying physique.

At this moment, the Black Bear King had shown a remarkable increase in intelligence in such a short period. Some unexpected changes must have happened here.

“Brother Qin Yu, quickly leave this place. Revered Qi has sent a few people to this Saint Kingdom and they are nearby. Hua Qianjie’s strength is even more terrifying than this black bear.”

‘What?!”

Qin Yu was shocked but didn’t have time to think about it now.

At this moment, the black bear had indeed rushed toward the giant tree where Shen Qian was.

“Crack! ”

A white light hit the black bear’s body. Qin Yu fiercely threw out the bone spike in Dark Heart’s hand previously.

The massive force broke the bone spike in the middle. It only penetrated a little before splitting into two.

“Roar!”

The black bear let out an angry roar and immediately turned around to run toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu crawled and rolled, frantically moving in a zigzag pattern.

This black bear should be the most powerful king in this area. At this moment, its speed and strength were at least four times greater than his, leaving no hope for a head-on confrontation.

“Rip!”

The giant bear charged and brushed past Qin Yu.

Although it did not knock Qin Yu down, its sharp claws slashed across his ribs. Fortunately, it did not rupture the lungs. Otherwise, the Saint power of the soul required for healing this injury would significantly increase.

“D*mn it.”

At this moment, Qin Yu no longer hoped to dodge the black bear’s attack. He placed his palm on the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

He controlled the power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, getting ready to use it at any time.

Qin Yu was not confident at this moment. This was the first time he used the power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze. He was unsure if he could deal with this bear demon.

The black bear turned his head around, standing tall like a human.

Its muscular body glistened, resembling a towering black mountain.

Its eyes emitted a fierce gleam as if concealing endless desires for slaughter.

However, it had been staring at Qin Yu cautiously at this moment. It paced back and forth uneasily as if it had keenly sensed danger.

Meanwhile, on the other end, Ni Fei, Hua Qianje, and the others had heard the bear’s roar just now.

“If I’m not wrong, this black bear demon is the most powerful king here. Even my current strength is probably inferior to it. Could it be that another demonic beast is fighting with it?”

Hua Qianjie frowned.

“Let’s go over and take a look. If we can take down this bear demon, we can consider speeding up and not be so timid. Moreover, with my vision and your strength, it won’t be a problem for us to retreat even if there are any changes.”

Ni Fei looked at Hua Qianje, nodded, and said.

After making up their minds, the six people controlled by Hua Qianje unwillingly walked slowly toward the area where the tremors were coming from.

“Hurry up, or die!”

A cold light flashed in Hua Qianjie’s eyes, and she threw a twig out of her hand.

The twig pierced through one of their palms like an arrow departing a bow. He let out an unwilling roar.

However, there was nothing she could do about it. After so many days of hunting, she ate the most demonic beast’s soul’s Saint power.

At this moment, Hua Qianje’s body emitted a powerful scent of vitality. She now had half of the Bear King’s strength.

The others could only sadly quicken their pace, hoping the Bear King would not discover them.

“Hahaha, it’s actually an old acquaintance!”

Ni Fei closed his eyes, but he seemed to be able to see the surrounding scene. “Looks like the seed Revered Qi gave him is a power similar to true vision, and it should have a cooldown time. After using roughly two hours, it no longer can be used.’

Hua Qianjie thought that Si Fei’s appearance was a coincidence.

Therefore, even though they were chosen by Revered Qi, she had been on guard against Ni Fei all along.

They were all bestowed with seeds, but in this Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, almost everyone had to fight for the final Holy Saint Kingdom.

Ni Fei had been using his vision to help Hua Qianje, allowing her to grow to such a level in such a short time.

Even without the incident this time, they would still want to go and kill this bear demon a day later.

This abnormal behavior, on the contrary, made Hua Qianjie very wary.

Anyone who could enter this place was definitely not a good person. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Unless he was absolutely confident, otherwise, why would Ni Fei help her so much?

In the past few days, she had thought of ambushing and killing Ni Fei numerous times. However, she dared not take the risk due to the other hidden seed.

“After slaughtering this bear demon, I must settle things once and for all.”

Hua Qianjie had made up her mind. The longer she dragged on, the more uneasy she felt.

“Hahaha, it’s indeed an old acquaintance. This Qin Yu is confronting the bear demon now!”

Ni Fei revealed a cold smile.

“How’s the situation now?”

Hua Qianjie’s expression turned cold.

“They’re still in a standoff, but he shouldn’t be a match for the Bear King.”

At this moment, Qin Yu had a massive wound on his body, and he looked tremendously miserable.

“What a trash! Do we still want him to cause some damage to the bear demon? Looks like we can’t count on him!”

Hua Qianjie spat.

“This little b*stard is really lucky. He actually managed to enter this place.” Ni Fei sneered.

The Ni family and the new Thunder Courtyard had an unresolvable grudge against Qin Yu.

Seeing Qin Yu in such a sorry state at this moment, he felt a rare sense of joy.

“Roar! ”

At this moment, the black bear could no longer hold it in. The qi and blood Qin Yu emitted before it was miserable. It would not have hesitated for so long if it was not for the faint sense of threat.

It attacked Qin Yu again. This time, it was sprinting at full speed.

Qin Yu’s eyes almost failed to capture the black bear’s figure.

The black bear charged at its prey at full speed like a landslide. Every step it took was earth-shattering as if a furious war god was charging at it on a stormy sea.

The vibration actually transmitted to Qin Yu’s feet from a hundred meters away.

“No, it’s too fast. I have to get closer.”

Qin Yu was covered in cold sweat at this moment. As his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze did not open, it was hard for him to capture this terrifying speed.

Without the power condensed by the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he would be doomed completely.

Even if he had the Seal of Heaven Returning, which had completed the cooldown, he would probably die again if he resurrected here.

In the face of absolute strength, even reviving a few more times was useless.

Moreover, based on his analysis of the effect of the Seal of Heaven Returning Seal last time, Qin Yu could control it to go back to ten seconds ago.

The black bear could not detect him, but he would have to reappear in ten seconds.

“I’m going all out!”

Qin Yu grabbed his head with both hands and began to surge with the

condensed power..
