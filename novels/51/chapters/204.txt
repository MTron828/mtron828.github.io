Chapter 205: Certain Death Situation? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was obvious that Qin Yu had guessed correctly.

Yuan Hong had no intention of letting Qin Yu go!

He wanted to use Qin Yu to cure Jiang Haoran and then lock Qin Yu back in!

“Hehe, Qin Yu, if you don’t use it when I give you a chance, then don’t blame me for being merciless,” Yuan Hong said with a cold expression.

“I will submit the materials very soon. At that time... you won’t have a chance to go back even if you regret it!” Yuan Hong berated coldly.

“You don’t have to worry about that,” Qin Yu said expressionlessly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Although Yuan Hong was angry, he had no choice but to leave.

He went all the way back to the office. In the office, Jiang Gu was sitting there sipping tea.

“President Yuan, how was it? Did Qin Yu agree?” Jiang Gu asked.

Yuan Hong shook his head and sighed, “Mr. Jiang, Qin Yu is smarter than we thought. He has seen through our intentions.”

Jiang Gu immediately slammed the table and stood up!

He shouted angrily, “Are you going to let my son lie in bed for the rest of his life?!”

Facing Jiang Gu’s anger, Yuan Hong didn’t dare to say anything. He could only stand at the side and tremble.

“If it really doesn’t work... let’s let Qin Yu go. This way, he might be able to treat your son’s illness...” Yuan Hong suggested.

Jiang Gu glanced at Yuan Hong and said coldly, “No, this boy must die!”

Obviously, Jiang Gu was already panicking.

If Qin Yu didn’t die, it would be a disaster for the Jiang family!

He would never allow anyone to challenge the Jiang family’s position in Chuzhou!

Yuan Hong sighed and said, “Then there’s nothing we can do.”

Jiang Gu glanced at Yuan Hong coldly and said, “Submit the materials immediately and kill Qin Yu. We’ll talk about other things later.”

To Jiang Gu, the status of the family was even higher than the life of his son Jiang Haoran!

...

After Qin Yu returned to the cage, Yao Qing hurriedly walked up.

“Mr. Qin, you... you offended the Jiang family?” Yao Qing’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Just as Qin Yu was about to speak, a few Inner Strength Past Masters who were kneeling on the ground walked toward Qin Yu with the help of a few people.

This time, there was no longer any resentment on their faces. What replaced it was respect!

“Mr. Qin!” The few of them cupped their hands together and shouted.

This made Qin Yu somewhat surprised.

He sized up the few people in front of him and said with a half-hearted smile, “What is this?”

The few of them hurriedly said, “We heard that recently, there was a young man in Chuzhou who not only provoked the Jiang family, but also defeated Jiang Gu.”

“I never thought that that young man would be you!”

“Yeah, your deeds have long spread. We admire you a lot!”

“Please forgive us for offending you earlier!”

Qin Yu was even more surprised.

They even got the news from inside the cage?

It seemed that the Jiang family’s influence in Chuzhou was indeed beyond imagination.

“Mr. Qin, in all these years, no one has dared to provoke the Jiang family. You are the first person!”

“That’s right. If it’s possible, we are willing to follow you!”

These people were all Inner Strength Past Masters. If they were in the outside world, they would definitely be able to stir things up.

However, it was a pity that Qin Yu wouldn’t have the chance to leave.

The few of them chatted happily, and Qin Yu also healed their legs.

Even though these people were afraid of the Jiang family, they also had a strong sense of resistance in their hearts. It was just that they didn’t dare to do it.

After looking at the angry crowd, Qin Yu couldn’t help but look in the direction of the prison.

He said in a sullen voice, “Why don’t you guys follow me and rebel against the Martial Arts Association to break out of this prison?”

As soon as he said this, the crowd instantly fell into silence.

The crowd that was lively just now suddenly became a bit cold and quiet, and no one dared to speak.

“Mr. Qin, it’s not that we don’t want to help you, but... this isn’t realistic,” someone said.

“That’s right, Mr. Qin. We advise you to give up this idea as well.”

Qin Yu frowned and said with some confusion, “I saw it when I came in. This Martial Arts Association just has a few Inner Strength Past Masters holding down the fort. As long as we stick together, it’ll be easy for us to break out.”

“Mr. Qin, what you saw was just the Martial Arts Association in Chuzhou.” The brawny man who took the lead shook his head.

“It’s true that Chuzhou only has Inner Strength Past Masters. What about Zhongzhou? What about Jingdu?”

“The Martial Arts Association is the official organization of martial artists. They will never allow anyone to challenge their authority.”

“Once there is a rebellion, Zhongzhou and Jingdu will probably send people to get rid of us.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately understood.

This Martial Arts Association was probably a huge organization.

After so many years, they had long developed deep-rooted power.

It naturally wasn’t that easy to defy them.

“Mr. Qin, we’re sorry.” They cupped their hands and said.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I was just joking. I’ll have to trouble you guys to take care of Yao Qing in the future.”

“Mr. Qin, please rest assured.” Everyone said.

They hadn’t been imprisoned for long, so they naturally wouldn’t take this risk with Qin Yu.

And Qin Yu didn’t mention this matter again.

Time flew by.

In the evening, Yuan Hong had prepared the materials related to Qin Yu.

“These materials are enough to take Qin Yu’s life.” Yuan Hong handed the materials to Jiang Gu.

Jiang Gu took the materials and glanced at them, then sneered and said, “That’s right. Let’s not delay. If we delay, things will change. Yuan Hong, execute Qin Yu tomorrow morning!”

Yuan Hong nodded and said, “Understood.”

Jiang Gu didn’t stay any longer. After he left the Martial Arts Association, he asked Mr. Zhong to spread the news.

He wanted to maintain the Jiang family’s position in Chuzhou and let everyone in Chuzhou know that he shouldn’t try to provoke the Jiang family! Otherwise, he would only die!

What a good move!

This news quickly spread throughout Chuzhou! For a moment, countless people were discussing this matter!

“Qin Yu... lost in the end,” Hong Wu murmured in a low voice like an old man’s.

Even people in Jiangcheng found out about this matter.

“Hahaha, I knew Qin Yu would die for sure!” Xiong Yi couldn’t help but laugh out loud while sitting in his office.

With a cigar in his mouth, he had viciousness on his face.

“He actually wanted to kill me? Dream On!” Xiong Yi said coldly.

Then, Xiong Yi shouted towards the door, “Let Mr. Wu in.”

Not long after, a young man walked in.

Behind him, there was a large group of people!

And the young man called Little Wu was a genuine eighth stage Inner Strength master! His strength even surpassed Yao Qing!

“Mr. Xiong.” Mr. Wu bowed and shouted.

Xiong Yi sneered and said, “Qin Yu is already in prison and will be executed tomorrow. We should shake things up a bit in Jiangcheng!”

“Mr. Wu, bring some people to deal with Lei Hu tonight!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Yes, Mr. Xiong.” Little Wu nodded slightly and said.

“Mr. Xiong, if Qin Yu dies, then the Soul Nourishment Pill...” Xiong Yi’s secretary couldn’t help but frown slightly.

Xiong Yi sneered and said, “I have long made preparations. Once Qin Yu dies, only one person will be able to produce the Soul Nourishment Pill, and that person will be Mr. Yang! As long as Mr. Yang is controlled, this Soul Nourishment Pill will belong to me alone!”
