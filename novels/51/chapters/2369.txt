2370 The Little Monk

He did not expect that cultivator to be so strong that he could last until now under the siege of the monster race army.

A bald youth stood barefoot on the ground, his face still revealing a hint of tenderness.

A layer of Buddha light enveloped him. He fiddled with the Buddha beads in one hand and formed a hand seal with the other. The ancient chants of the scriptures flowed continuously from his lips.

Beside him, numerous monsters had their legs blown off and were lying on the ground.

He strolled leisurely among the monster army, and the legs of the monsters he came into contact with all exploded.

“What a terrifying strength!”

Qin Yu was shocked. This little monk was too relaxed.

He seemed to be shopping around and was very relaxed when facing the monster race army. He could even control his spell techniques to keep these monsters alive.

At this moment, the monster race general on the giant chariot let out an angry roar. Dozens of priests chanted incantations around the altar.

In the sky, cold wind blew at intervals and demonic qi shrouded the air with a sense of eerieness unwittingly.

Qin Yu, even with his current strength still felt like a huge mountain suppressing his divine sense, making him feel tremendously uncomfortable.

As the chanting of the incantation continued, the feeling became stronger.

Suddenly, an extremely murky dark thunder struck down with great force, and a monstrous demonic aura swept across the entire Crescent Moon Continent.

Qin Yu’s hair instantly stood on end and he instantly hid his internal qi to the utmost.

At this moment, he seemed to have smelled an incomparably vast and powerful internal qi.

He had only sensed this feeling when the Guardian attacked him during the backlash of the Path of Heaven.

In an instant, the entire continent fell into complete silence.

The human race corpses on the ground, the remaining human race souls in space, and various vitality seemed to have been devoured by the demonic qi.

After that, the demonic qi disappeared very quickly. The speed was so fast that Qin Yu thought it was an illusion.

This method was rather similar to what the monster race had used in the Azure Firmament Sect.

But this time, the ritual performed by the monster race seemed to be more advanced.

The leading general roared and rushed into the dark clouds raising a flag.

The flag suddenly unfolded, and countless human souls scrambled out from it.

Like a waterfall, blood gushed out and lasted for dozens of seconds before the souls and blood were completely released and then suddenly devoured.

Although this continent was barren, it still had vast and boundless space. This method was shocking enough.

In Qin Yu’s divine sense, nearly all the remaining human internal qi in that space were devoured in an instant.

When the demonic qi disappeared, a blood moon suddenly appeared in the sky.

The red light that filled the sky shone on the Crescent Moon Continent, and the pupils of those monsters suddenly turned red. This blood moon seemed to have directly made them go berserk.

The monsters on the ground whose legs were broken, the edge of the bone breakage was wriggling, and then gradually recovering.

A blood-red light shone on the general’s body, and a violent internal qi surged frantically like a tide.

With the support of the blood moon, the monster race army charged at the little monk crazily.

Even if their legs were broken, those who were leaders still clung tightly to the Buddha light.

They self-destructed before they died just to reduce the power of the Buddha light.

The little monk’s face was slightly pale. He had been fighting here for a long time and now began to feel a bit overwhelmed.

The 40,000 to 50,000 monsters that he had just eliminated their fighting strength had recovered at this moment, and they were now launching even more reckless and fearless assaults on him.

“Sigh.”

The monk sighed and stopped chanting.

“Sanskrit Sound Annihilation!”

A Sanskrit sound came from the little monk’s mouth. At this moment, Buddha light surged from his body.

The resplendent Buddha light suppressed the demonic qi, and the Buddha voice spread out in all directions with visible ripples.

In the next moment, Qin Yu heard a thump in his heart.

It was as if a Sanskrit sound had exploded in his divine sense, but that Sanskrit sound did not cause any harm to him.

The monster race army around the small monk fell to the ground and died completely. There were no more soul fluctuations on their bodies.

The monster race army seemed to have heard some order and retreated frantically.

The monster race general’s eyes were bloodshot. The demonic qi on his body soared into the sky, and the Buddha voice actually disappeared thousands of feet away from him.

He raised the halberd in his hand high and slowly walked toward the little monk.

Before he reached the little monk, the halberd smashed down at him with surging demonic qi.

The little monk’s expression was calm as he received the demonic halberd with his palm.

Golden Buddha light shot out from his hand, and countless demonic qi were purified by the Buddha light.

The general slowly opened his mouth and spat out a word.

“Die!”

The terrifying power in his hand exploded again, and monstrous demonic qi surged out of his body.

The demonic qi exploded from the halberd like a hurricane in the monk’s palm.

“D*mn!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. At this moment, the monster race general’s internal qi actually rose steadily.

It indeed had already far exceeded the realm of the half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage. It was a little similar to Teng Zixu’s Borrowing Power from the Heavens.

“The Three Stances of the Initial Meditation, Between Bodhi, End of Samsara, and Beginning of Nirvana.”

The little monk’s expression was tremendously calm. His right hand suddenly pulled out three Buddha beads.

The three dharmic seals shot into the air and instantly turned into three huge Buddhas, which then crashed into the monster race general’s body.

“No, it’s still not enough. Nine Dragons!”

Nine raging fire dragons spiraled and collided with the halberd. Qin Yu then pulled the little monk.

“Singularity Space.”

Qin Yu stretched out a hand, and instantly, thousands of spaces formed in front of him.

The halberd finally landed in his hand after striking through countless spaces.

Qin Yu only felt an unrivaled force land on his palm, instantly knocking him tens of thousands of feet underground.

The entire ground shook non-stop, and cracks appeared on Qin Yu’s arm.

Almost at the same time, a claw suddenly reached out from the general’s back.

It grabbed onto the monster race general’s back, and sounds of metal clashing were heard. The claw under the Spiritualization Technique could only scratch the monster race general’s body.

It was a claw that had reached half-step heavenly might!

Qin Yu was shocked in his heart. His movements were not good at all.

A layer of Sumeru qi drifted from his hand and attached itself to the giant claw. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The giant claw imbued with spatial power surged with power again. The monster race general seemed to have sensed something not right. He dodged to the side, and one of his arms fell to the ground.

He came to the side of the arm, picked it up, and disappeared on the spot.

The monster race general roared angrily. He raised his halberd high, and countless dark thunder fell on it. Earth-shaking fluctuations emitted.

“Let’s go! We can’t beat him.”

The little monk patted Qin Yu’s shoulder. The next moment, Qin Yu felt dazzled and arrived on a new continent.
