2127 Arriving Soon

Qin Yu slightly bowed. He did not say anything else, then turned around and left.

At this moment, Dean Lei called out to Qin Yu.

His palms shone brightly, and a mark entered Qin Yu’s mind.

Qin Yu was startled and said with some confusion, “Dean Lei, what is this?”

“Don’t ask. In short, this thing can protect your primordial spirit at a critical moment, but only once.”

Qin Yu was overjoyed upon hearing that! His physical body was invincible, relying on Wu Ji’s divine robe on his body, and his primordial spirit was the weakest.

Now, with this thing from Dean Lei, he could protect his life at a critical moment.

“Thank you very much, Dean Lei,” Qin Yu bowed and said.

After bidding farewell to Dean Lei, Qin Yu left Thunder Courtyard.

Another reason he left Thunder Courtyard was the agreement he had with Yan Ruoxue.

Now that the day of the Path of Heaven was approaching, it was also time to keep the appointment.

“Perhaps it’s really time to embark on the escape path.” Qin Yu took a deep breath. He already had a complete plan in his mind.

He cast his gaze upon Astral Mountain. There was a gate that led to the star field. Numerous geniuses had already embarked on this path.

Now that Qin Yu was fleeing, leaving through Astral Mountain might be a good choice.

As for the way to get to Astral Mountain, Qin Yu already knew about it. He already had such a plan when he first went to Astral Mountain.

“Phew!” Qin Yu’s had a sense of anticipation in his heart.

After all, that was the path all the chosen ones had taken. No one knew how many legends had been left on that path.

“Wu Ji… He should have been there too,” Qin Yu thought to herself.

With Wu Ji’s strength, he might not even need to rely on the formation to cross the void. Therefore, all of this was only Qin Yu’s guess.

After leaving Thunder Courtyard, Qin Yu prepared to go to the Yan family.

Meanwhile, visions still kept appearing in the sky. It was unknown if it was because someone was about to break through to the True Saint Realm or if the day of the Path of Heaven was approaching.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at Nanzhou, once his former homeland.

The sky was getting dark. He found a tavern to rest for a while and planned to continue his journey the following day.

The tavern was full of the clamor of voices. The arrival of the day of the Path of Heaven seemed to have made everyone feel inexplicably excited.

Even though the day of the Path of Heaven did not have much to do with them, it still excited them tremendously.

“Have you heard? The day of the Path of Heaven will arrive in ten days at most!”

At this moment, someone in the crowd said softly.

“Ten days? So soon?” The surrounding people immediately surrounded him, and Qin Yu was no exception.

He slightly frowned, pricked up his ears, and listened intently.

“This news has spread. Didn’t you hear?” the man said in surprise.

“We have never heard of this news. Where did you hear it from?” someone asked.

“This news has spread throughout Zhongzhou, and I happened to be from Zhongzhou,” the other party said with a trace of pride.

As soon as he said this, the surrounding people became even more excited. They surrounded him and waited for him to continue.

To these ordinary cultivators, it was a great honor to be able to go to Zhongzhou.

“In Zhongzhou, there are people publicly deducing the dao technique. At most ten days, the day of the Path of Heaven will arrive. As for the exact location, it remains unknown,” than cultivator continued.ρ

“Tsk tsk, the day of the Path of Heaven is finally coming. I wonder who will be chosen by the Path of Heaven in the end,” someone sighed with emotion and said.

“The number one person of the younger generation, Teng Zixu? Or Si Shiyue, the Holy Son of the Si family?”

“There are many Holy Sons in the world, and everyone seems to have a chance.”

“Don’t forget Yan Guyun and Si Liuhe. Although they aren’t the chosen ones of the younger generation, they still have a chance in the current world.”

“Qin Yu, who defeated the Yao family’s Holy Son, might be the one. His potential is immeasurable, and the possibility of him chosen by the Path of Heaven is tremendously high.”

For a moment, there were varied opinions, and Qin Yu could not help but sigh with emotion.

He did not expect to become a legend in other people’s mouths unknowingly. Everything seemed to be a dream.

“The day of the Path of Heaven… will arrive in ten days. It looks like it’s too late now.” Qin Yu sighed.

He had wanted to go to the Yan Family and take Yan Ruoxue away, but it seemed that it was too late.

Before the arrival of the day of the Path of Heaven, it would be hard for Yan Ruoxue to find a chance to leave, and it would take Qin Yu some time to reach the Yan family.

“My friend, is what you said true?”Qin Yu could not help but ask in a low voice.

The other party glanced at Qin Yu and was about to speak when he froze on the spot.

“You… You are Qin Yu?” the cultivator said in shock. He quickly stood up and cupped his hands at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu? You’re the Qin Yu who walked out of Nanzhou?”

“Yes, I am.” Qin Yu nodded lightly and smiled bitterly.

His response instantly caused a commotion in the entire tavern.

“You’re Qin Yu, the Qin Yu who defeated the Yao family’s Holy Son!”

“I’ve long heard that Qin Yu is also from Nanzhou. I didn’t expect to see him here!”

“This is simply too shocking! Qin Yu, you are the pride of our Nanzhou!”

“Qin Yu, I heard you are now a chosen one of your generation in Thunder Courtyard. Now that you have returned to Nanzhou, is it for the day of Path of Heaven?”

Looking around, countless gazes instantly gathered on Qin Yu. Those eyes were full of admiration, shock, and even worship. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Facing everyone’s fervent gazes, Qin Yu smiled faintly, knowing he had become the idol in the hearts of these people.

“I’m just an ordinary person. I just had better luck,” Qin Yu said lightly, his voice indifferent.

However, what he said became even more shocking in the ears of the surrounding people.

“Qin Yu, you’re too humble. You defeated the Yao family’s Holy Son and became a chosen one of the Thunder Courtyard. You’re the pride of the people of Nanzhou!”

“That’s right. Qin Yu, Your achievements have surpassed our reach, leaving us in awe.”

Qin Yu responded to them one by one. Then he looked at the cultivator and said again, “You said that the Path of Heaven is arriving in ten days. Is that true?”

The cultivator quickly stood up and cupped his hands. “I did hear such discussion in Zhongzhou, and it has spread widely. All the great aristocratic families now seem to be waiting for the day of the Path of Heaven to arrive.”

“Thank you very much,” Qin Yu bowed and said.”

After saying this, Qin Yu hurriedly left this place and rushed toward Zhongzhou.

He had wanted to go to the Yan family and take Yan Ruoxue away, but it seemed he did not have sufficient time. He could only think of another way.

Qin Yu took three days to come to the Cold Moon Palace. He wanted to ask Saintess Gu about it.

As usual, Saintess Gu sat under the enormous ancient tree, playing the zither and drinking tea, comprehending dao.
