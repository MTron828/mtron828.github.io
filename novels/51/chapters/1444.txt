Chapter 1445: Chapter 1,445, demon subduing divine lamp! 1

The Great Elder had already forgotten his original intentions. Before he came, he had already decided that no matter what, he would immediately activate the divine lamp.

But now, when he faced Qin Yu, he still could not hold back.

At this moment, the great elder regained his senses.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and a strange smile appeared on the corner of his mouth. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Little Bastard, you really have some ability. But so what? In the end, you still can’t escape death,”the first elder said gloomily.

Qin Yu looked coldly at the first elder and said, “If you still have any ability, feel free to use it.”

The first elder did not say any more nonsense. His palm shook, and the divine lamp instantly fell into his palm.

Looking at this extremely ordinary divine lamp, the expressions of the people around could not help but change greatly.

“This is... the demon subduing divine lamp!”Someone recognized this item!

“Demon subduing divine lamp? The first elder actually took out the demon subduing divine lamp. This is the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s most precious treasure!”

“How... How is this possible! Why would he bring out the demon subduing divine lamp!”

The surrounding people were all greatly shocked. Only Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled.

This divine lamp looked extremely ordinary and did not have the slightest bit of magic.

However, why would such a divine lamp shock everyone?

“Qin Yu, be careful! This demon subduing divine lamp is the heavenly cloud sect’s top-notch treasure!”Zhuo Jing shouted from below.

Qin Yu nodded as a solemn expression appeared on his face.

He was just about to activate his protective divine technique when Qin Yu discovered that the spiritual energy in his body had already been depleted.

“Damn it!”Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he thought to himself that things were not looking good.

Qin Yu’s body had been depleted for too long. A short day’s time was not enough to change anything.

However, he did not expect that the spiritual energy had already been depleted after enduring for such a short period of time.

This meant that Qin Yu could not release any more spells, or even activate the picture. He could only rely on his physical body to resist the demon subduing divine lamp!

“When the house leaks, the rain will fall.”Qin Yu’s expression became more and more serious.

The first elder was already floating in the air. His white hair fluttered in the wind and he looked extremely murderous.

In his hand was the demon subduing divine lamp.

Wisps of Aura followed the first elder’s palm and entered the divine lamp.

The originally dim divine lamp suddenly emitted an extremely powerful aura!

The divine lamp was slowly vibrating. Although it was still dim, it gave off an extremely powerful pressure at this moment!

Even Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change. The aura emitted from this divine lamp was too terrifying!

“Little Bastard, your time of death has come!”The first elder roared angrily.

Immediately after, he raised the divine lamp in his hand and an extremely ancient aura drifted towards Qin Yu.

This aura was as calm as water, but it was also as terrifying as a raging fire. It couldn’t help but make people tremble in fear!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu immediately clenched his teeth, and activated the fifth level of the battle word incantation!

“Qin Yu, take the Silver Spring Well!”Zhuo Jing hurriedly shouted.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to it. Even if he had the Silver Spring in his hand, it wasn’t much of an improvement for Qin Yu.

Looking at the sweeping aura, Qin Yu’s muscles tensed up.

He clenched his teeth and threw a punch with all his strength towards the sweeping aura of the demon subduing divine lamp!

“Buzz!”

However, at the moment of contact, Qin Yu was directly sent flying by this aura!

With just a slight touch, cracks appeared on Qin Yu’s fist, and even his internal organs received the impact!

His body was sent flying for hundreds of meters. It was unknown how many mountain rocks he had to smash to stabilize his body.

Such terrifying power had indeed shocked everyone!

Qin Yu struggled to get up from the ground. He suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Damn it...”Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly.

If he had not lost his spirit energy at this moment, Qin Yu would not have been in such a sorry state!

Although the demon subduing divine lamp was powerful, it was impossible for it to force Qin Yu to such a State!

He raised his head to look at the first elder in the air, his expression turning uglier and uglier.

“If I could use that divine map, his divine lamp wouldn’t be worth mentioning,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Beads of sweat broke out on his forehead. The attack just now had injured him severely, causing him to feel pain all over his body.

“Little Bastard, today is the day you die.”The first elder could not help but reveal madness on his face.

At this moment, he didn’t want to bring Qin Yu back at all. Instead, he wanted to kill him on the spot!

“Little Bastard, go to hell!”

The first elder activated the demon subduing divine lamp again. Wisps of aura rapidly gathered on the divine lamp.

“Qin Yu!”

Seeing this scene, Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but Roar!

“What a pity. In front of the demon subduing divine lamp, Qin Yu will also have to die here.”

It was as if everyone could see Qin Yu’s ending.

The Aura from the divine lamp swept towards Qin Yu once again!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He endured the pain and placed his arms in front of him.

Just as the light was about to sweep across Qin Yu’s body, a figure suddenly appeared and blocked in front of Qin Yu.

A pair of palms actually grabbed towards the light.
