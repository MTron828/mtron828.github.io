Chapter 1466: Chapter 1,466, are you a F * cking traitor? 1

Yongji City? Zhong Wu actually wants to go to Yongji City?

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned. Yongji actually invited Zhong Wu? What did he want to do?

But after thinking about it, Qin Yu also understood.

Although Zhong Wu’s own strength wasn’t that great, he was still the leader of the Hunter organization.

The hunter organization had a great influence in the South Province, so it was reasonable to invite him.

“It really doesn’t take much effort to come here.”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

At that time, Jue Wu and the others would all go there, so it would be more convenient for them to start a fight.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He immediately left the green rock forest and rushed toward the Eternal City.

There wasn’t much time left before the appointed time in the Eternal City. Qin Yu was about to leave now, so he could make it in time.

Riding on the Divine Eagle, he rushed towards Yongji City.

Fortunately, Qingyan forest was not far from Yongji city. It did not take long for Qin Yu to arrive near Yongji city.

He put away the divine eagle and strode towards Yongji City.

For this grand feast, Yongji seemed to have put in a lot of effort to prepare.

Outside the gate of Yongji City, there were two people responsible for welcoming him.

When they saw Qin Yu, they immediately cupped their hands and said, “Greetings, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu politely replied and then asked, “Is everyone here?”

“Basically, they have already arrived,”the Greeter said.

Qin Yu nodded and followed behind them as they walked into Yongji city.

As soon as he stepped into Yongji City, Qin Yu felt several extraordinary auras from the Internal Qi.

Even though these internal Qi were trying their best to restrain themselves, they were too powerful, so he could still feel them.

The entire city was just as Qin Yu had imagined. This was the heaven of the strong.

As long as one had money or strength, one could receive the final result here.

In the deepest part of the Eternal City, there was a huge palace.

And this palace was the famous eternal mansion, which was also the residence of the Eternal City.

Under the lead of these two people, Qin Yu came to a place that was like a place of peach blossoms.

This place was filled with dense qi. Thousands of divine rays descended from the sky, as if it was an immortal palace.

In this immortal palace, there were already many people who had come here, but Qin Yu didn’t recognize most of them. He appeared to be somewhat cautious.

He had just found a place to sit down when a cup of fine wine was sent to Qin Yu.

Rumor has it that this wine was condensed from hundreds of flowers and dew. The taste was sweet but not greasy, like the nectar of jade dew.

Qin Yu released his divine sense and almost covered half of the immortal palace.

Soon, Qin Yu found that almost all the people here were extremely powerful, and there was no lack of top-notch martial artist among them.

The most shocking thing was that when Qin Yu’s divine sense swept over Yongji’s disciple, that strand of divine sense was instantly cut off.

As expected, more than half of the talents in the South Province have been recruited by Yong Ji, Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was no wonder that Yong Ji didn’t put Ling Yun in his eyes. Perhaps Ling Yun was a treasure in the Tianyun sect, but in Yong Ji’s eyes, he was worthless.

This was because any one of his disciples wasn’t weaker than Ling Yun. In fact, they were even stronger.

Very soon, Yong Ji walked over from not far away.

He smiled and said, “I knew you would definitely come.”

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “How can I refuse Mr. Yong Ji’s invitation?”

Yong Ji laughed loudly and said, “Qin Yu, what do you think of My Place?”

Qin Yu looked around and nodded. “Whether it’s the environment or the resources, they are all top-notch.”

Yong Ji said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “If that’s the case, why don’t you choose to stay?”

Qin Yu rejected straightforwardly. “Although the Yong Ji Mansion is indeed a good place, it’s not suitable for me. I’m used to being free. Please forgive me, Mr. Yong Ji.”

Yong ji laughed and said, “Qin Yu, do you know that no one has ever rejected my invitation?”

Qin Yu could not help but smile bitterly when he heard that and said, “Then I’m afraid that I will have to take away Mr. Yong Ji’s first time.”

Once these words were said, it immediately made Mr. Yong Ji not know whether to laugh or cry.

“Oh right, Mr. Yong Ji, what is the theme of this banquet?”Qin Yu asked curiously.

Yong ji said mysteriously, “I can’t tell you about this for the time being. You will naturally know about it later.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After saying that, Yong Ji patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and got up to leave.

Qin Yu didn’t think much about it. Since he was already here, he might as well enjoy it.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t care about his image and began to eat and drink.

Just as Qin Yu was sweeping away the clouds, a person that Qin Yu didn’t want to see appeared outside the door.

The moment he appeared, he immediately attracted many gazes. There were even people who walked forward to greet him.

This person was none other than the first elder.

Just as Qin Yu was looking at the first elder, the first elder also noticed Qin Yu’s tracks.

His face sank and he immediately strode towards Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu! Why are you here!”The first elder said while suppressing his anger.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “I should be the one asking you this. Why didn’t you hide in the Heavenly Cloud Sect? Why did you run out? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll take the opportunity to kill you?”

“Little Bastard, how dare you!”First Elder flew into a rage.

After saying that, he shouted and a long halberd appeared in his hand.

This long halberd was also extraordinary. It was even more powerful than the divine lamp from that day!

“How many rounds do you think you can last under the Heavenly Dragon Halberd?”First Elder said coldly.

“TSK TSK, you gave me a divine lamp last time, and now you’re going to give me a long halberd? Are you a F * cking traitor of the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

At this moment, a mischievous female voice came from not far away.

It was none other than the Swan Dance!

Seeing the swan song in front of him, the first elder instinctively shivered.
