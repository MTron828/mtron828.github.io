2475 The Fallen Godly King

Lei Xin and Flower Granny also launched a full-powered attack, while Qin Yu summoned the power of his six acupoints and stabbed his sword at it.

“What a powerful defense!”

Wan Li’s face turned solemn, and at this moment, the sky above him, thousands of meters away, seemed to be burning with demonic flames.

These demonic flames slowly descended, and they would probably detonate this continent when the ritual was completed.

By then, all human race living beings below the Tribulation Transcending Stage would probably turn into ashes.

All of a sudden, a shocking sword energy descended from the sky like a rainbow.

The Blood River Banner let out a strange beast-like shriek, and the vast sword energy entangled with the Blood River for nearly ten breaths before it slowly disappeared.

In the air, three people slowly revealed themselves.

They were the evil exterminator, Uncle Ling, and Ling Yurou. He was the first to notice the abnormality after the seal was broken.

At this moment, the evil exterminator exuded a majestic aura of the Path of Heaven and gazed coldly at the monster race beneath.

“What a formidable power of the Path of Heaven!”

Lei Xin could feel the internal qi coming from the evil exterminator, and he could not help but say in shock.

He raised the Evil Extermination Sword in his hand high. The sword domain was released, piercing through the burning demonic clouds.

Besides the sword domain, three powers of the way surrounded the three sides.

One main and three auxiliaries mutually nurtured and reinforced each other.

The terrifying intent of the Way of the Sword suddenly formed.

The violent power stirred up a storm in the space, fine sword intent as fine as hair connected in the air.

The shadow of a dragon sword suddenly roared into the sky like a divine thunder.

“Whoosh!”

The evil extermination suddenly sheathed his sword, and the sword light that filled the sky disappeared suddenly.

Instead, he walked straight toward the altar and wanted to attack the altar directly.

The earth-shattering sword chant even suppressed the prayers of thousands of worshippers.

Even the swordsmen far away in the Holy Region could faintly feel this sword intent. They looked in that direction with shocked expressions, not knowing who had accumulated such a terrifying sword intent.

He slowly assumed a sword-drawing stance, a flash of sword aurora bursting forth from the scabbard.

The Sword of Heaven and Earth! The monster’s fall!

A magnificent sword energy shot out like it was from the evil exterminator’s hand. A sword energy that could sweep across the Path of Heaven pierced out.

In an instant, a cold light lit up like the rising sun. Another blurry rising sun seemed to appear slowly in the sky of the billions of continents in the universe.

Tiny sweats appeared on the evil exterminator’s face that had never changed. He took a deep breath.

He threw the scabbard on the ground, grabbed the hilt with his other hand, and stabbed the Evil Extermination Sword with all his might.

This was the true Sword of Heaven and Earth!

The evil exterminator landed on the ground. His shoes made a sizzling sound as they trembled on the ground.

Uncle Ling and Ling Yurou appeared beside him. This strike seemed to have exhausted all of his strength.

All the demonic qi around the sword energy dispersed.

“What a terrifying strike! Perhaps it can really break the altar.”

Chen Zhisha looked at the shocking sword strike with a gloomy expression.

“Please don’t think about attacking. Otherwise, even if I burn my soul power, I’ll stop you with my life.”

Wan Li stared at Chen Zhisha. He was no longer willing to call the person in front of him Martial Uncle.

Qin Yu and the others also stared at the sword energy nervously. However, something suddenly happened.

A blood-red figure suddenly appeared in front of the sword energy. This person had a dark aura that soared into the sky. His body was like a giant, and every moment his muscles moved, they emitted exaggerated sounds.

Endless falling qi appeared on his body.

In an instant, the Sword of Heaven and Earth had already pierced through him, and then it ruthlessly clashed with the altar.

Ding!

Unlike Qin Yu and the others, the sword energy of the Evil Extermination Sword seemed to have broken through some rules and directly bombarded the altar. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The earth-shaking sword chant ceased abruptly after hitting the altar, causing it to tremble violently. Under this enormous shock, one could only see an afterimage when divine sense swept over.

“Fallen Godly King, why didn’t I sense him coming here?”

Wan Li’s expression was tremendously ugly, but he understood it all when he saw the Moon Demon Godly King.

A Godly King was also Stationed in this nest of the monster race. He used the power of the Moon Demon to conceal himself, the Fallen Godly King.

The outcome would be obvious if this sword had hit the altar in its perfect state.

However, there was no “if”…

“Sigh, this is the Fallen Godly King with the strongest physical strength among the monster race. His physical strength can even compete with the Tribulation Fifth Level cultivator. His physical strength is on par with the primordial rune of the Path of Heaven. The sword energy wasted too much energy to kill him just now. Otherwise, it might have destroyed the altar.”

Lei Xin sighed and said.

“Such a terrifying physical strength?”

Qin Yu said in shock.

Cultivators had to experience the Soul Sinking, Condensed Throne, and create heaven and earth before they could have a chance to pry into the origin and use this part of the power.

Even Qin Yu found it inconceivable that he could resist the power of heaven and earth with the strength of his physical body.

His current Glazed Holy Body had opened up six acupoints that connected. The maximum explosive power should be at the Tribulation Fourth Level.

“Agares, the Fallen Godly King, was originally a human race physical cultivator. In the subsequent battle, he comprehended the monster race’s Path of Heaven and left a mark on it. After his body was baptized by the monster race’s Path of Heaven, his physical strength gained the strength of the monster race’s body, and he brought great damage to the human race in the previous battles.”

Flower Granny seemed to be very familiar with this history. She frowned and told them the origin of the Fallen Godly King.

“It’s troublesome now. I’m afraid it’ll be very difficult to stop this sacrificial ritual of the monster race. They are even willing to sacrifice the power of a Godly King to complete this grand ritual. I’m afraid that this time, they will create something that the human race can’t deal with.”

Lei Xin’s expression was tremendously ugly. Everyone had expected the evil exterminator’s sword strike to break the altar and did not expect this to happen.

Wan Li took a deep breath and stretched out his hand.

A disc-shaped golden wheel of great compassion suddenly appeared in his hand.

As he let go of his hands slightly, a circle on the edge engraved with the appearance of various Arhats as well as surrounding the center, the true form of the Buddha with a single palm in a gesture of compassion suddenly manifested in gold.

The three dharma forms circled the golden wheel of great compassion and slowly floated into the void. The enormous golden wheel floated in the air like a constellation.

“The Sect Leader’s item actually appeared in your hands, but it’s still not enough.”
