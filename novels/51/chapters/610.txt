Chapter 611: The Power of the Black Gold Ball! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Immortal Slaying Sect was a mess.

In the main hall of the Immortal Slaying Sect sat a young man. In front of him were countless inner cores.

As the inner cores were swallowed one after another, Qin Yu successfully advanced from a first level Martial Marquis to a second level Martial Marquis.

He slowly opened his eyes and couldn’t help but sigh. “I can’t even feel the passage of time here.”

Cultivation was so mundane and boring.

He stared at the towering door in front of him, and he began to yearn for life outside.

“There are nearly ten thousand inner cores left. I’ll eat these inner cores first.” Qin Yu shook his head helplessly and could only continue cultivating.

In the Green Moon Villa, Chang Mang and the others had already become members of the Green Moon Villa.

As a Saintly Body, Chang Mang was extremely powerful. There weren’t many people in the younger generation who could defeat him.

Now, since Qin Yu wasn’t here, Chang Mang had become the backbone of the Green Moon Villa.

“Sect Master Zhen, don’t worry. I will make the Green Moon Villa glorious!” Chang Mang said confidently.

Zhen Yue opened his mouth, but in the end, she only sighed and said, “Alright.”

However, someone was secretly plotting something.

This person was Deng Sheng, the former Elder of the Saint Confucian Sect!

Ever since he heard about Qin Yu’s death, Deng Sheng had been looking for an opportunity to restore the Saint Confucian Sect!

However, Deng Sheng, who was cautious by nature, wasn’t in a hurry to attack because he was afraid that Qin Yu didn’t die.

More than ten days had passed, and Qin Yu still hadn’t shown up.

Just when Deng Sheng thought that an opportunity had come, Chang Mang appeared!

“I must find a way to make Chang Mang leave,” Deng Sheng said grimly.

As long as Chang Mang left, Deng Sheng would have a way to take back the Saint Confucian Sect!

By then, he would be the Sect Master of the Saint Confucian Sect!

If he had the chance, he could even gain the appreciation of the big families and replace Gu Canghai!

“Sect Master Zhen, Mr. Chang, there’s a man who claims to be Mr. Qin’s old friend who is here to see you.” At this moment, someone walked in and said.

“Mr. Qin’s old friend?” The two looked at each other and said, “Let him in!”

“Yes.”

A few minutes later, a man in a black robe walked in. He was full of dark energy.

Seeing this man, Chang Mang suddenly stood up and shouted, “He Teng? You dare to come?!”

He Teng took off the black robe that obstructed his vision and said in a sinister tone, “If you can come, why can’t I?”

Chang Mang took a step forward and without saying a word, he threw a punch!

The terrifying qi force brought about a majestic wind as it charged straight at He Teng!

He Teng didn’t expect Chang Mang to make a move without saying a word. He hurriedly raised his hand and responded in a panic.

“Boom!”

The two fists collided, and He Teng’s body was pushed back dozens of steps before smashing the door behind him!

His wrist was in pain. Even with the protection of the black energy, the bones of his hand were still shattered.

“What a powerful force.” He Teng’s expression couldn’t help but change.

“This guys’s strength rivals Qin Yu’s.”

This caused a trace of anger to rise in He Teng’s heart! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Where did these people come from?!” He Teng said angrily.

Qin Yu had already dealt him a huge blow, and now, there was Chang Mang!

“He Teng, when you were on the island, you plotted against Qin Yu many times. If it wasn’t for you, Mr. Qin wouldn’t have died!” Chang Mang shouted.

“I was just thinking about seeking revenge on you, but I didn’t expect you to deliver yourself to my doorstep!”

He Teng looked at Chang Mang coldly and said, “Looks like you have forgotten the lesson from last time!”

The black energy on He Teng’s body was slowly surging. It was obvious that He Teng was prepared to use the same trick again.

When Chang Mang saw this technique, his expression changed slightly.

He snorted coldly and said, “He Teng, I will kill you right now. I will use your head to pay tribute to Qin Yu!”

As he spoke, Chang Mang stepped forward once again!

He Teng didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately activated this black energy and charged towards Chang Mang.

However, this time, Chang Mang closed his eyes. After that, he activated all the inner strength in his body and ruthlessly smashed it over!

The scarlet light carried a powerful force and shattered that ball of black energy!

Chang Mang was like a madman. Once he attacked, he wouldn’t know how to turn back.

He took large strides forward and his sturdy body appeared in front of He Teng in the blink of an eye!

He Teng’s expression changed. Just as he was about to activate the black energy to protect his body, Chang Mang’s fist had already smashed into his chest ruthlessly!

“Pu!”

A mouthful of fresh blood spurted out from He Teng’s mouth!

His body was sent flying dozens of meters away!

“This b*stard...” He Teng couldn’t help but feel a little shocked.

He had never expected that Chang Mang’s strength was actually so powerful!

“Die!” Chang Mang shouted loudly. He held the scarlet light in his hand and charged towards He Teng once again!

He Teng gritted his teeth. He took out the Black Gold Ball and said coldly, “If it wasn’t for this Black Gold Ball... I really wouldn’t be his match!”

This made He Teng extremely furious!

Once upon a time, he was the number one person in the Central Plains, and there was practically no one who could rival him among the younger generation!

But now, these prodigies were appearing one after another like bamboo shoots after a rain, and each one of them was extremely powerful!

“Kill him... take his body.”

At this moment, that hoarse voice sounded in He Teng’s mind.

He Teng didn’t say anything. Facing Chang Mang, who was rushing over, he immediately activated the Black Gold Ball to attack him.

“Whoosh!”

The Black Gold Ball turned into a ray of light!

“Clang!”

The Black Gold Ball smashed into Chang Mang’s fist fiercely. Chang Mang was immediately knocked back repeatedly, and cracks appeared on the bones of his hand!

“What is this thing? It’s so hard.” Chang Mang glanced at his fist and said in a low voice.

He Teng stood up from the ground. He looked at Chang Mang coldly and said, “Chang Mang, I admire you very much. Are you interested in working with me?”

“F * ck you. I’d rather die than work with a despicable person like you!” Chang Mang roared angrily and stepped forward again!

His iron fists were almost invincible.

But today, he had met his match.

He Teng activated the Black Gold Ball to attack Chang Mang.

The other Black Gold Ball was like a bullet, and in the blink of an eye, it smashed on Chang Mang’s body dozens of times!

Under He Teng’s control, the two Black Gold Balls worked seamlessly together, and Chang Mang had no way to resist!

Looking at Chang Mang, who was beaten until he vomited blood, He Teng couldn’t help but lick his lips and sneered. “This Black Gold Ball... is really a good thing...”

“Don’t waste time, get rid of him quickly...” that hoarse voice sounded again.

He Teng nodded and raised his palms. The two Black Gold Balls immediately erupted with a terrifying power and smashed on Chang Mang’s chest at an extremely fast speed!

This attack shattered Chang Mang’s physical body, and his entire body fell to the ground!

Chang Mang struggled to get up, but he found that he couldn’t get up at all!

“F * ck you...” Chang Mang glared at He Teng.

He Teng walked in front of Chang Mang and said with a sinister tone, “Chang Mang... Don’t worry, I’ll kill you right now!”
