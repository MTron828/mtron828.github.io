Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed and immediately praised, “Well done!”

Following that, Lei Hu sent the address and time to Qin Yu.

The time was set at noon, and the location was the largest restaurant in the area, called Yihe Winery.

At noon, Qin Yu packed up and prepared to leave.

Before he left, Qin Yu reminded him, “Take care of the herbs in the garden. Don’t forget to water it later.”

“I know. I know.” Yao Qing waved his hand impatiently.

Then, Qin Yu drove to the Yihe Winery.

In a small private room in the winery, there were three people sitting there.

One of them was an old man, and the other two were young men.

“Master, do you really think Qin Yu is that capable?” A young man asked with a frown.

Dong Tianhai said in a sullen voice, “I think so. I know Jiang Gu very well. He values the reputation of his family very much. If Qin Yu doesn’t have the ability, it’s impossible for him to make Jiang Gu submit to him willingly.”

“I still don’t think it’s possible.” The other young man snorted.

“Master, I’ve heard that Qin Yu has a special relationship with the Yan family” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Moreover, back then, Yan Ruoxue came personally and asked Jiang Gu to let him go. I think Jiang Gu is most likely afraid of the Yan family.”

Dong Tianhai didn’t say anything.

He rubbed his chin and thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “Mm, it’s indeed possible. Let’s talk after I meet him.”

The two of them didn’t say anything else. They just sat there and waited quietly.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu pushed the door open and entered.

The moment they saw Qin Yu, the two disciples frowned even more.

Judging from his aura, Qin Yu was only an Inner Strength Master Hands. He wasn’t even a grandmaster. How could he possibly win against Jiang Gu, who was an Inner Strength Grandmaster?

Even Dong Tiannan was a bit suspicious.

It was impossible for an Inner Strength Master Hands to win against an Inner Strength Grandmaster, even if he was a genius!

Could it be that Qin Yu really had an undeserved reputation?

“You must be the medicine king, Mr. Dong.” Qin Yu took the initiative to walk forward and shook hands with Dong Tianhai.

Dong Tianhai nodded. After the two of them shook hands, Qin Yu sat down.

After exchanging some pleasantries, Dong Tianhai said with some flattery, “Mr. Qin, you have already achieved so much at such a young age. It really surprises us.”

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Mr. Dong, you must be joking. Compared to you, my achievements aren’t worth mentioning.”

A disciple at the side laughed and said, “Mr. Qin, I’ve long heard that your strength is extraordinary. Even Jiang Gu was defeated by you. Seeing you in person today really surprised me.”

He seemed to be complimenting him, but in fact, he was suspicious.

The other disciple said straightforwardly, “I think Jiang Gu just has some misgivings.”

Qin Yu frowned. Although he was displeased, he didn’t say anything.

“Mr. Qin, if you don’t mind, I wonder if you and I can spar?” The disciple stood up and said somewhat provocatively.

Qin Yu glanced at Dong Tianhai and shook his head. “Forget it. I came here today because I have something to ask of you, Mr. Dong.”

“Hehe.” The disciple smiled and didn’t say anything more.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt a wave of internal qi sweep across his body.

Although it was only for an instant, Qin Yu still caught it.

He looked at Dong Tianhai and couldn’t help but frown.

Dong Tianhai wasn’t as simple as he seemed! He was indeed worthy of being called the king of herbs.

“Mr. Dong, I came here to discuss a cooperation with you.” Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and went straight to the point.

Dong Tianhai poured a glass of wine and took a sip. He smiled and said, “I wonder what kind of cooperation Mr. Qin wants to discuss?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and then said, “Mr. Dong is called the king of herbs. I believe you must have top-notch herbs in your hands.”

Dong Tianhai wasn’t modest. He nodded and said, “That’s right. I have more than ten stalks of herbs that are hundreds of years old.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp!

More than ten stalks of herbs that were hundreds of years old? Dong Tianhai was really rich!

Qin Yu said somewhat enthusiastically, “Mr. Dong, if possible, I want to buy a few stalks from you. Name your price!”

“Mr. Qin, are you looking down on my master? Do you think my master is short of money?” His disciple sneered.

Qin Yu quickly changed his words, “Mr. Dong, if it’s possible, I’m willing to exchange an item of equal value with you!”

“An item of equal value?” Dong Tianhai raised his eyebrows.

He put down the wine cup in his hand and said with a nonchalant smile, “Mr. Qin, may I ask if you have anything precious in your hands?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “I have pills. Is that okay? No matter what pill it is, as long as you ask, I can try making them.”

“Hahahaha!” Hearing this, Dong Tiannan couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“I didn’t expect Mr. Qin to know how to refine pills,” Dong Tianhai said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I know a little about it.”

Dong Tianhai couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

After thinking for a moment, he suddenly said, “Okay, if you can give me a Nine Transformation Golden Pill, you can choose any of my herbs!”

“Nine Transformation Golden Pill?” Qin Yu immediately searched through his inherited memories.

Soon, the formula for the Nine Transformation Golden Pill appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

“No Problem!” Qin Yu immediately agreed.

Since he had the formula, refining the Nine Transformation Golden Pill should not be a problem.

“Okay, then it’s a deal!” Dong Tianhai nodded.

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He quickly raised his wine cup and clinked it with Dong Tianhai.

After eating this meal, Qin Yu said goodbye to Dong Tianhai and left the winery.

After Qin Yu left, Dong Tianhai’s expression immediately darkened.

“Master, this kid is definitely bragging.” His disciple snickered.

“That’s right! I proposed to spar with him, but he didn’t dare to agree! If he really has the ability, why would he refuse?!” The other disciple also said.

Even Dong Tianhai snickered.

He glanced at his two disciples and said, “From his aura, he is indeed only a seventh stage Inner Strength Master Hands. His strength is low and isn’t worth mentioning.”

“Moreover... I deliberately used the Nine Transformation Golden Pill to test him, but he actually agreed.” Dong Tianhai narrowed his eyes and said.

“You must know that even in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, there are very few people who can refine the Nine Transformation Golden Pill?! It is very obvious that he is a braggart!”

The other two disciples nodded one after another.

Not to mention that the refinement of the Nine Transformation Golden Pill was extremely difficult, but just the herbs required for the refinement were extremely rare.

Qin Yu’s firm assurance made Dong Tianhai suspicious.

“Master, the King of Chuzhou is just an empty title. It seems that we have to find someone else to work with,” his disciple said in a sullen voice.

Dong Tianhai nodded and sighed slowly. “Fortunately, I didn’t tell Qin Yu about the birth of the Divine Medicine...”
