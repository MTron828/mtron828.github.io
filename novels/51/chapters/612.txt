Chapter 613: The Man With the Mustache Arrives! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu held the bronze sword and walked quickly to the door.

Standing at the door, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.

Whether or not he could break through the door depended on the bronze sword in his hand.

“Buzz!!”

As Qin Yu injected his spiritual power, the bronze sword exploded with a dazzling light. The entire sword seemed to have been endowed with life, and it was trembling non-stop!

Qin Yu shouted loudly, and the bronze sword in his hand immediately swung towards the door!

“Clang!”

The loud sound was deafening! The terrifying recoil force even forced Qin Yu back a few steps!

Under the tremendous power of the bronze sword, a shocking scar was cut on the door!

“It’s finally effective!” Qin Yu’s eyes flickered with a strange light, and hope was ignited in the bottom of his heart!

He held the bronze sword and slashed at the door again!

The door rumbled again, and another mark appeared!

However, other than the mark, the door showed no signs of breaking open!

Qin Yu didn’t give up. He held the bronze sword and slashed out more than ten times.

Each slash could cut through the surface of the door, but it couldn’t completely break open!

Qin Yu’s expression began to turn ugly.

“Could it be that... Even with this weapon, it’s impossible to break through this door?” Qin Yu frowned.

He took two steps back and prepared to activate the Nine Taiqing Slashes!

This was a true Divine Rank spell. Qin Yu had comprehended it a long time ago, but he hadn’t used it many times.

“With my current strength, I can only use three slashes at most,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was said that every time one comprehended the Nine Taiqing Slashes, its power would increase explosively!

And the ninth slashes even had the power to split their surroundings apart!

Qin Yu took a deep breath, the spiritual power in his body was boiling.

“The Nine Taiqing Slashes, the first slash!”

Qin Yu roared angrily, and his physical body instantly rose into the air!

He held the scarlet bronze sword in his hand, and slashed down from high up!

The huge sword light instantly obscured his vision. As if it came from the horizon, it landed on the gate!

“Boom!”

A loud sound was heard and the ground around the gate collapsed!

However, the gate still couldn’t be broken open!

“How could this be...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth.

He immediately activated the third strike of the Nine Taiqing Slashes, but he still couldn’t break open the gate.

“D*mn it!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse to himself.

He tried to strike out the fourth strike, but unfortunately, he failed.

Even though all the spiritual power in his body was drained, Qin Yu still couldn’t use the fourth strike!

On the contrary, his strength was completely depleted, and he collapsed on the ground.

“Do I really have to be trapped here for life?!” Qin Yu was on the verge of breaking down, and he couldn’t help but raise his head and roar!

He still had too many things that he hadn’t completed. He still hadn’t been able to save Yan Ruoxue. How could he bear to be locked up here like this?!

“Let me out!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but break down and roar loudly!

His voice reverberated in the Immortal Slaying Sect for a long time.

“Buzz!”

Just as Qin Yu was about to give up, a pitch-black hole suddenly appeared out of thin air.

Then, the man with the mustache jumped out.

“Oh my God, you’re still alive!?” The the man with the mustache was obviously shocked when he saw Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was even more stunned. He hurriedly got up and hugged the the man with the mustache!

He hugged the the man with the mustache tightly, and his excitement was beyond words.

At this moment, Qin Yu wished he could kiss the the man with the mustache!

“Oh my God, I don’t want to hug you. I’m not interested in men,” the the man with the mustache said with a look of disdain.

Qin Yu couldn’t care less about the the man with the mustache’s teasing. He said excitedly, “I’m saved! I’m saved!”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “I thought you were dead. I didn’t expect you to still be alive.”

Qin Yu suppressed the excitement. He stared at the the man with the mustache and said, “Why are you here?”

The the man with the mustache said proudly, “The ancient ruins of the Immortal Slaying Sect have been unearthed. Of course, I has to come and clean it up!”

At this point, the the man with the mustache said, “This is the Immortal Slaying Sect... the number one sect in the world definitely has treasures!”

“By the way, how did you get in?” Qin Yu asked with some doubt.

The the man with the mustache said, “Of course, it’s by relying on the array platform. For someone like I who often deals with ancient ruins, I have to have a certain level of mastery over a spell array platform.”

Qin Yu said jokingly, “Since there is such a spell, why didn’t you come to save me earlier? At least you could have collected my corpse.”

The man with the mustache glared at Qin Yu and said, “Do you think the spatial array platform is easy to set up? I spent more than a month to successfully set it up!”

“More than a month... in other words, I have been locked up here for more than a month,” Qin Yu said with a frown.

The man with the mustache patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Now, the people outside all think you are dead. It won’t be long before they forget about you.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu said anxiously, “Let’s go!”

“Where are we going?” The man with the mustache rolled his eyes.

Qin Yu said, “Of course we are going out!”

“F * ck. It wasn’t easy for me to come in. How can we just go out like this?” The man with the mustache muttered.

“I came here to search for treasures, not to save you.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I’ve looked around. There’s nothing here. I’m afraid you’ve come here for nothing.”

“No, no, no. In your eyes, there’s nothing here. But in my eyes, this is a treasure!” The man with the mustache said with a smile.

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

It made sense. The man with the mustache was a professional. Treasures that Qin Yu couldn’t find might be treasures for the man with the mustache.

“What is this?” At this moment, the the man with the mustache noticed the bronze sword in Qin Yu’s hand.

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and told the the man with the mustache what happened.

After the the man with the mustache heard it, he said with a pained expression, “What a waste! With so many materials, you only refined such a thing?”

“If those materials were given to me, I could duplicate them perfectly. What a pity!” The the man with the mustache clutched his chest with a look of heartache.

Qin Yu waved the bronze sword in his hand and said, “There’s no other way. I have to think of a way to save myself.”

“Moreover... This bronze sword isn’t bad.”

The man with the mustache glanced at the bronze sword and said, “It’s not bad. It can be considered a good weapon. It’s just that... compared to a powerful weapon, it’s far too inferior.”

At this point, the man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “Forget it. Perhaps there’s a complete Mighty Realm weapon hidden here. If I can obtain a powerful weapon, won’t I be invincible in the world?”

“When the time comes, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the aristocratic families of Jingdu can go to h*ll!” The man with the mustache said excitedly.
