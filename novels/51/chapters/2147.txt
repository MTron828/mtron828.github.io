2148 Gathering of True Saints

“Don’t… Please stop. I’m begging you…” At this moment, Qin Yu’s tears were falling like rain, and his heart was as if being twisted by a knife.

Yan Ruoxue’s gaze grew increasingly icy, like a female demon lord. The previous fairy-like temperament had disappeared as if a murderous demon was standing in front.

She turned around and forced a smile at Qin Yu.

“I won’t let anything happen to you.” Yan Ruoxue’s mouth was stained with blood like a flower blooming in the snow.

Yan Ruoxue’s words were filled with determination and tenacity. Her goddess-like gaze was enough to make people fall into it. At this moment, she seemed to have really transformed into a goddess, protecting everything in her heart.

She raised her palm again, ignoring the bone-piercing pain in her body, and slapped her chest without hesitation.

At that moment, a loud explosion sounded in the air. Yan Ruoxue’s body instantly disappeared in the air, leaving behind a suffocating powerful internal qi hovering in the air. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Despair and pain filled Qin Yu’s heart. He felt as if his heart had been gouged out, and an indescribable pain assaulted him.

However, Yan Ruoxue’s figure reappeared in the light ball. Her internal qi was even more powerful as if it had already surpassed the limits of a human. Her eyes were cold and deep, revealing endless sorrow and determination.

At this moment, she seemed to have truly transformed into a mighty goddess, exuding boundless authority and fierceness. She was so beautiful, so cold, and so powerful.

“Saintess Yan, you…” The linen-robed elderly men’s words halted abruptly. They knew this was Yan Ruoxue’s final decision, and any persuasion would be useless.

Yan Ruoxue did not answer them. She just looked at them coldly and pointed at the two elderly men.

“One more time… I want you all to die!” Staring at the two linen-robbed elderly men, Yan Ruoxue raised her delicate hands, intending to kill herself for the third time!

However, at this moment, a golden light shot over from afar. The golden light was like a chain blocking Yan Ruoxue’s delicate hand that was about to land!

Then a tremendously terrifying internal qi descended.

Everyone looked into the distance and saw a tall middle-aged man slowly descending.

His internal qi was dense and imposing, emanating a commanding presence even when he was not angry. There was even an indescribable emperor’s aura between his brows.

This person was none other than Yan Tianshi. Behind him were many True Saints, including Si Liuhe.

“Have you gone mad…” Yan Tianshi’s voice entered Yan Ruoxue’s ears.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue was in complete despair.

She knew that even if she reincarnated nine times, she could not defeat Yan Tianshi.

“You’re really going all out for Qin Yu.” Si Liuhe sounded displeased.

“Holy Lord Yan,” the two linen-robed elderly men bowed and greeted him with a flattering tone.

Yan Tianshi glanced at them, then raised his hand and slapped their faces twice!

These two slaps were tremendously powerful, almost shattering the faces of those two people!

“How dare you force my Yan family’s saintess to this extent? Are you tired of living?” Yan Tianshi’s tone was cold.

The two linen-robed elderly men were naturally incomparably aggrieved, but in the face of Yan Tianshi’s protective behavior, it was useless to say anything.

Although the Ni family’s elder not far away was unhappy, he could not say anything and only pretended not to see anything.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue seemed to have thought of something. She hurriedly ran in front of Qin Yu and shielded him behind her.

“No one is allowed to touch him!” Yan Ruoxue almost roared out this sentence!

Yan Tianshi looked at Yan Ruoxue coldly and did not say anything for a long while.

“No one can protect him today,” Si Liuhe stepped forward and said coldly.

Yan Tianshi, standing by the side, did not say a word. He seemed to have acquiesced to Si Liuhe’s words.

“If you dare to touch him, I will die before your eyes!” Yan Ruoxue’s eyes suddenly burst into tears as she roared madly.

However, how could Yan Ruoxue resist Si Liuhe, a top-notch True Saint?

He looked at Yan Tianming and said, “Holy Lord Yan, I won’t get involved in your family matters.”

Yan Tianshi obviously understood Si Liuhe’s intention. He slowly raised his hand, and a terrifying force instantly captured Yan Ruoxue, immobilizing her!

“Don’t touch him… don’t touch him!” Yan Ruoxue roared like she was mad, but she could not break free!

Her face was covered in tears, and her heart seemed to be torn apart.

“I beg you, don’t touch him, I beg you…” Yan Ruoxue looked at Yan Tianshi humbly and begged him.

However, Yan Tianshi’s expression was cold as if he had made up his mind.

Si Liuhe did not waste any time. He stepped forward and arrived in front of Qin Yu almost instantly.

At this moment, Qin Yu was staring blankly at Yan Ruoxue. Seeing Yan Ruoxue being treated like this with his own eyes, the pain in his heart almost made him lose his mind. He even forgot about his own situation.

“Qin Yu, it’s time for you to pay the price for causing trouble in the Holy Region!” Si Liuhe’s voice was full of authority and majesty. Many True Saints also stepped forward.

Facing so many True Saints, Qin Yu naturally had no chance of resisting.

He closed his eyes slightly, and two streams of tears flowed out.

“Ruoxue, I’m sorry. I still can’t do it…” Qin Yu muttered, his tone filled with despair.

Si Liuhe looked at Qin Yu coldly. He slowly raised his hand, and a dazzling light rose. The terrifying internal qi covered the entire heaven and earth.

At this moment, time was like standing still. Everyone’s eyes focused on his hand.

“Don’t, don’t!” Yan Ruoxue screamed at the top of her lungs as tears streamed down her face.

“Go to hell!” Si Liuhe shouted, and his palm slapped toward Qin Yu!

Right at this moment, a powerful internal qi suddenly blocked in front of Qin Yu!

An old man with a head of white hair received this attack and protected Qin Yu behind him.

“So many people bullying a child, how shameless!”

It was none other than Dean Lei.

Dean Lei glared at the crowd and said, “Do we need to mobilize so many people to deal with a child? Are you guys crazy?”

Si Liuhe was not surprised by Dean Lei’s words. He said coldly, “Dean Lei, you can’t save him today. The nine great aristocratic families have a common wish to get rid of Qin Yu. You alone can’t do anything.”

However, Dean Lei did not back down at all and said, “Let’s try and see!”

“Do you really want to do this?” Si Liuhe asked coldly.
