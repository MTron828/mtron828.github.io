After hearing these words, a shocked expression finally flashed across Han Wei’s face.

He said coldly, “The last time I saw him, he was only an Inner Strength Master Hands. The possibility of him becoming Inner Strength Grandmaster isn’t high.”

“So, does that mean that Qin Yu,with the strength of an Inner Strength Past Master, really defeated a level five Inner Strength Grandmaster?”

The butler nodded and said, “Yes... Yes. If Qin Yu was also Inner Strength Grandmaster, he wouldn’t be a threat at all. But...”

Han Wei didn’t say anything. His expression was ice-cold.

It was almost unheard of for an Inner Strength Past Master to defeat an Inner Strength Grandmaster!

“Young Master, why don’t we take action ahead of time and get rid of Qin Yu first?” The butler asked tentatively.

When he heard this, Han Wei’s expression immediately became ice-cold.

He looked at the butler coldly and said, “What, do you mean that I’m inferior to Qin Yu?”

“Young Master, I absolutely have no such intention!” The butler was so scared that he immediately knelt on the ground!

Han Wei said coldly, “He’s just a piece of grass. If I squish him to death, it’s like squashing an ant!”

“If we take action now, won’t the Han family be disgraced?”

“Yes, yes...” The butler broke out in cold sweat and nodded desperately.

Han Wei didn’t say anything more. He looked out of the window and snorted coldly. “There’s less than half a year left. I don’t believe that he can make much progress in half a year!”

Updates by

It was impossible for him to become Inner Strength Grandmaster in half a year!

Therefore, Han Wei wasn’t too worried.

...

The next day, after Qin Yu got up, he refined a pill for the members of the Longhu team in advance.

He refined two kinds of pills in total. One was used to heal wounds, and the other was used to increase inner strength.

As long as these two kinds of pills were combined with the body refining technique, Qin Yu was confident that he could get first place.

“It’s time for me to go into seclusion,” Qin Yu thought to himself after contemplating for a while. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

At this moment, Xiao Yu suddenly ran into the room.

She shook Qin Yu’s arm and said, “Didn’t you say that you were going to take me somewhere? When are you going to take me there?”

Qin Yu said with a headache, “In a few days.”

“No!” Xiao Yu shook her head.

“I want to go now. If you don’t agree, I’ll pester you!” Xiao Yu said with a serious look.

Qin Yu felt helpless. He thought for a moment and said, “Okay, I’ll take you there once. Is that okay?”

“Okay!” Xiao Yu nodded quickly.

Qin Yu took out his cell phone and called Jiang Gu.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu asked, “Jiang Gu, where is the largest cemetery in Chuzhou?”

Jiang Gu was stunned and asked in confusion, “Mr. Qin, why are you looking for a cemetery?”

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and immediately told Jiang Gu what happened.

“If Xiao Yu wants to cultivate, she must rely on dark energy,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Jiang Gu was silent for a moment and said, “Most of the cemeteries in the provincial capital are public now. There is no dark energy.”

Jiang Gu paused and continued, “But I do know a place. It used to be a battlefield. Rumor has it that hundreds of people died there.”

Qin Yu immediately said, “Come and pick me up. I’m at Mr. Wu’s house.”

“Yes, Mr. Qin,” Jiang Gu replied.

After he hung up the phone, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Jiang Gu had a holy body now. In addition to his strength as an Inner Strength Grandmaster, the strength of his physical body was definitely beyond imagination!

Using him to test his physical body might be a good choice.

Ten minutes later, Jiang Gu’s car arrived at Mr. Wu’s house.

Xiao Yu had already prepared herself. She even changed into a lightweight outfit.

It was already early winter, and Xiao Yu sat there shivering from the cold.

“Why are you wearing so little?” Qin Yu frowned.

“It looks cute! Don’t you know that beautiful women care about how fashionable clothes are instead of how warm they are?” Xiao Yu said with a smile.

Qin Yu was a little helpless. He reached out with his palm and a wisp of spiritual energy instantly wrapped around Xiao Yu.

In an instant, Xiao Yu felt warm all over her body.

“Let’s go,” Qin Yu said with a wave of his hand.

The two of them got into Jiang Gu’s car and then sped toward the destination that Jiang Gu had mentioned.

“This battlefield is on the outskirts of the provincial capital. It was a village in the past, but later on, strange things kept happening, so the people in the village dispersed,” Jiang Gu introduced.

Qin Yu nodded.

From what Jiang Gu said, this battlefield was a good place for cultivation.

After driving for more than two hours, they finally arrived at the village that Jiang Gu had mentioned.

This place was cordoned off with a warning sign next to it: accident-prone area, no entry.

Qin Yu got out of the car. He frowned and looked up at the sky.

Dark clouds covered the village. What was more frightening was that under the dark clouds, there seemed to be a huge ghost face!

“What’s that?” Qin Yu pointed at the ghost face in the sky and asked.

Jiang Gu frowned and said, “There’s nothing. What’s wrong?”

“Nothing.” Qin Yu shook his head.

It seemed that only he could see the ghost face.

“There’s something off about this place,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“You guys should stay with me later. Don’t go far.”

Xiao Yu said nervously, “What... What’s wrong? It’s creepy here and it looks a little scary...”

“Are you scared? Go home if you’re scared,” Qin Yu said.

“No!” Xiao Yu quickly grabbed Qin Yu’s arm.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He led the two of them across the police line and walked into the village.

The ghost face in the sky was at the center of the village.

Therefore, Qin Yu walked straight to the bottom of the ghost face.

Soon, the three of them arrived at the bottom of the ghost face.

“Who are you? Leave quickly!” A shout came as soon as the three of them arrived!

After turning around, they saw two young men blocking their way.

Qin Yu sized up the two of them and asked, “Who are you guys?”

“Cut the crap! My master is currently cultivating. Hurry up and leave!” The two young men shouted.

At the same time, the internal qi on their bodies burst out!

“Inner Strength Grandmasters?” Qin Yu raised his brows.

Judging from the internal qi of these two people, they were probably Inner Strength Grandmasters of the first stage.

Qin Yu sneered. “What does your master’s cultivation have to do with us?”

“How dare you! My master is Lord Xuan Yin of the Central Plains! Leave now!” The two of them shouted angrily.

Qin Yu sneered. “You guys are really overbearing. If he can enter, why can’t we?”

The two of them said arrogantly, “Because our strength is above yours, this place belongs to us!”

“Oh really? So, if we are stronger, we have the right to chase you out?” Qin Yu sneered and said.

The two of them said indifferently, “That’s right. It depends on whether you have the ability!”

“Really? Then I will satisfy you!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Jiang Gu, clear the area!” Qin Yu shouted.

“Yes!” Jiang Gu strode forward, and the internal qi on his body suddenly burst out!
