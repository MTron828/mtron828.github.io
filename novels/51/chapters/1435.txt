Chapter 1436: Chapter 1436, kneading di zun 1

In such an era, everyone had a chance to stand out, and everyone could become the gravel of the era.

Qin Yu walked into the palace, which was similar to the design of the city Lord of Gu City.

Other than a huge hall, the rest were almost all Qin Yu’s rooms.

Qin Yu chose a room and planned to rest for a while.

He had been too tired during this period of time, and every day had exhausted him.

He lay on the bed and soon fell asleep.

Perhaps it was because the recovery of spiritual power had made him feel more at ease, but in any case, Qin Yu had not slept so well for a long time.

The next day, Qin Yu slowly woke up at noon.

He sat on the bed and tried to sense the spiritual power in his body, but he was surprised to find that there was still very little spiritual power in his body.

“What’s going on?”Qin Yu could not help but frown.

Could it be that the spiritual power in his body was scarce because he had not cultivated for a long time?

It was very likely! After all, the divine capital was located in a desert, and the surrounding spiritual power was not dense. Otherwise, it would not have become a ruined city in the past.

Moreover, there were so many people living in the divine capital now. The scarce resources were naturally even more scarce.

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, the token in his pocket suddenly flashed with a ray of light.

This token was the one Zhuo Jing had given him back then.

Qin Yu took out the token from his pocket and felt that the token was extremely hot.

It was obvious that Zhuo Jing had crushed the token.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and then crushed the token in his hand.

“Could zhuo jing have also found the life force?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was for the best. Qin Yu took this opportunity to absorb the life force again to see if the nature essence in his body would change.

Therefore, Qin Yu waited quietly for Zhuo Jing’s arrival in the divine capital for the next few days.

...

Tianyun sect.

After the first elder killed Zhen Yue, he didn’t make the next move.

“First elder, Zhen Yue is dead, but Qin Yu hasn’t shown up. This means that either he doesn’t know about this news or Zhen Yue doesn’t care about him at all,”someone beside him analyzed.

With a gloomy face, the first elder said, “Then I’ll kill them all!”

“Is there a need for that?”

At this time, the deputy sect master walked out.

He sat beside the first elder and said in a deep voice, “Why should I do something meaningless?”

The first elder glanced at the deputy sect master and said, “I’m in charge of the Tianyun sect now, not you.”

The deputy sect master was not angry. He smiled faintly and said, “I’m not here to fight for power with you. I’m just here for the development of the Tianyun sect.”

“You killed Zhen Yue, but you didn’t Force Qin Yu to show up. Instead, you offended Di Zun.”

“It’s not a good thing for such a genius to be concerned about you.”

The first elder frowned, but it only lasted for a moment.

He snorted and said, “If di Zun dares to oppose me again, I’ll kill him!”

“Kill him? Hehe.”The deputy sect master laughed.

“Everyone in the world knows that this is a golden era. Every genius has a limitless future.”

“You should know that all the sects are fighting to retain the talents of the younger generation. Their goal is to survive in the golden era.”

“Di Zun is a rare talent. If you kill him, where are you going to find one to return to the sect leader?”

His words immediately made the first elder fall into silence.

“If you can’t kill Di Zun, then one day he will really grow to an invincible state. Have you thought about the consequences?”The deputy sect master sipped his tea and said indifferently.

The first elder suddenly felt a chill on his back.

After the deputy sect master’s analysis, he finally understood what Di Zun meant to the sect master and even the Heavenly Cloud sect. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The sect master’s son had been killed, yet he couldn’t bear to kill Di Zun to force Qin Yu to appear. This was enough to show how important Di Zun was to the sect master!

“Phew...”the first elder let out a long sigh of relief.

He looked at the deputy sect master, cupped his hands and said, “Thank you for telling me. I will never forget your great kindness.”

The deputy sect master smiled faintly and said, “That’s not necessary. I can tell you how to ease the relationship between you and Di Zun.”

The first elder looked at the deputy sect master and waited for him to finish.

The deputy sect master said, “You’ve killed Zhen Yue. Even if Di Zun hates you, he can’t save them. But the ones who are still alive are different.”

“If I’m not wrong, Di Zun will come and plead for Fang Yue and the others once he has recovered.”

“When that time comes, you should know what to do.”

After hearing the deputy sect leader’s words, the first elder could not help but bow his head in admiration.

“I understand.”The first elder bowed again.

“In terms of leadership ability, you must be above me.”The first elder sighed from the bottom of his heart.

The deputy sect leader stretched his back and sighed, “It’s a pity that the deputy sect leader has never been able to hold too much power. Otherwise, this time, it would not be your turn to represent us.”

After saying this, the deputy sect leader walked out.

The first elder sat on the rattan chair and pondered for a moment. Then, he ordered the people around him, “Send the medicinal pills to Di zun immediately. Make sure that he can recover as soon as possible.”
