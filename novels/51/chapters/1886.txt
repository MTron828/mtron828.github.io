1887 No Need to Comprehend?

A golden door appeared in Qin Yu’s mind.

The door was incredibly mighty, exuding a mysterious internal qi. The dazzling radiance caused Qin Yu hard to open his eyes, but he was unconsciously full of longing.

He walked toward the door step by step, and his body slowly disappeared into the golden light.

In an instant, rays of more dazzling golden lights appeared in front of Qin Yu!

!!

Qin Yu endured the discomfort in his eyes and fixed his gaze on everything in front of him.

Countless mysterious cultivation techniques were in front of him, each wrapped in a golden light.

“These… Are these cultivation techniques?” Qin Yu’s eyes widened in disbelief!

However, when did such a “cultivation technique library” appear in his mind?

“Could it be… my father?” Qin Yu suddenly thought of something at this moment!

When Qin Yu had just embarked on the path of cultivation, his father had left behind numerous cultivation techniques.

It was just that with the increase in his strength, the effects of those cultivation techniques had become negligible.

However, the cultivation techniques presented in front of Qin Yu were incredibly top-notch!

“Could it be… this door will only open when I reach a certain cultivation realm?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

If that was the case, it meant his father had paved the way for Qin Yu’s cultivation!

At each stage, Qin Yu would obtain cultivation techniques and hidden treasures of different levels!

“Hello, Qin Yu?”

Chang Mang gave Qin Yu a hard push from outside.

Only then did Qin Yu come back to his senses. He shook his head and tried feeling the door in his mind.

As expected, it was still there. It was not an illusion.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “In that case, my cultivation will not be as difficult as I imagined…”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile.

“Why are you giggling?” Chang Mang scratched his head.

“Nothing! Hahaha! Hahaha!” Qin Yu laughed heartily.

Seeing Qin Yu’s silly look, Chang Mang was even more dumbfounded.

“Are you still going? Are you out of your mind?” Chang Mang said with a frown.

“Of course, we’re going! Let’s go now!” Qin Yu said with excitement.

Although Chang Mang didn’t know what had happened, he could tell that Qin Yu was very excited. Thus he didn’t ask any more questions.

Therefore, the two of them came to the first main peak and were once again brought to the Thunder Academy by the two messengers.

Standing at the entrance of the Thunder Academy, Qin Yu cupped his hands to the two messengers and took out his token.

“Seniors, I’m afraid we’ll have to stay inside longer this time,” Qin Yu said.

One of the messengers took over the token from Qin Yu’s hand and closed his eyes as if he was calculating the time.

A few minutes later, the messenger returned the token to Qin Yu.

“You can stay in there for two months at most,” the messenger said.

“Two months is enough. Thank you, Senior,” Qin Yu quickly nodded and said.

The two messengers did not say much. They waved their hands and Thunder Academy opened.

This was Chang Mang’s first time entering Thunder Academy, so he was very excited.

Looking at the endless array of cultivation techniques, he could not help but drool.

“All the good cultivation techniques are up there,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Nevertheless, they were not in a hurry to go upstairs.

After all, it didn’t mean that the higher the level of a cultivation technique, the more powerful it would be. It depended on whether it was suitable for one.

Many top experts could still unleash unimaginable power even with a Yellow Rank cultivation technique. However, some people could not unleash even one-ten-thousandth of the power of the cultivation technique left behind by the Immortal Emperors.

Qin Yu and Chang Mang thus began their cultivations at the Thunder Academy.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry to comprehend cultivation techniques. Instead, he planned to spend time looking for a cultivation technique that was more suitable for him.

It was because two short months were just not enough for him to comprehend cultivation techniques.

The higher the level of a cultivation technique, the more time it would take to comprehend it.

A top-notch cultivation technique might even take hundreds of years to comprehend.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu and Chang Mang had stayed in Thunder Academy for a month.

In a month, Qin Yu had selected three cultivation techniques, and these three cultivation techniques had used up all the points in his hands!

One of them, the Thunder Mystical Technique, cost him 900 points!

Rumor had it that Immortal Emperor Lei invented Thunder Mystical Technique. So far, only three people in Thunder Academy had successfully comprehended it. They were Dean Lei, Flower Granny, and a venerable from Thunder Academy.

Countless people in Thunder Courtyard had tried to understand Thunder Mystical Technique, but all failed.

This Thunder Mystical Technique contained nine marks. Each was an incredibly terrifying emperor technique!

In addition, Thunder Mystical Technique contained incredibly powerful Immortal Emperor techniques, which were no weaker than any other cultivation technique in the world!

Looking at Thunder Mystical Technique in front of him, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and planned to comprehend it in a month.

...

Unfortunately, Qin Yu had overestimated himself.

Even with his talent, he couldn’t understand the slightest bit of it and was very lost.

It was like a vast expanse of emptiness in front of him, and he couldn’t find any direction or target. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It seems like it’s not easy to understand the emperor technique.” Qin Yu could not help but smile bitterly.

Immortal Emperors were existences who could destroy stars with a lift of their hands. Rumor had it that they could destroy the world with a gaze.

How could it be so easy to comprehend the cultivation technique created by such an existence?

Helplessly, Qin Yu had to put away Thunder Mystical Technique for the time being.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu and Chang Mang had stayed in Thunder Academy for 50 days. They only had 10 days left before leaving Thunder Academy.

Chang Mang was still trying to comprehend the saint technique. His body was glowing with a faint red light, making him look very mysterious.

Qin Yu could not bear to disturb him. Thus he went to the fifth floor of Thunder Academy, which was the floor where the Saint Weapons were stored.

On this day, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the fifth floor of Thunder Academy. He closed his eyes slightly, planning to try to see the hidden treasure left by his father again.

...

The primordial spirit again entered the glittering door, and countless cultivation techniques appeared in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu tried to reach out his palm and caught a ray of golden light in front of him.

The golden light instantly turned into memory and entered Qin Yu’s primordial spirit.

Suddenly, Qin Yu felt the technique had merged with his body.

“What?” Qin Yu frowned.

“Could it be… I don’t even need to comprehend these cultivation techniques?” Qin Yu was dumbfounded!

He tried to grab another ray of golden light. As expected, the golden light quickly turned into memory and entered Qin Yu’s mind. He didn’t have to spend time comprehending it.
