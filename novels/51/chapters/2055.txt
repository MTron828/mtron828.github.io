2056 Astral Mountain Grand Event

Qin Yu returned to his accommodation and began to create a clone.

He knew very well this clone must possess sufficient strength and intelligence to handle the nine great aristocratic families’ grand event at ease and obtain crucial information.

To achieve this goal, Qin Yu decided to use a mysterious secret technique to create the clone.

This secret technique was called the Soul Splitting Technique. It could strip a part of a cultivator’s divine sense to remain outside independently, forming a clone that resembled the cultivator.

Although this secret technique was powerful, the side effects were not minor. If not careful, it could cause damage to one’s divine sense or even permanent damage.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and thought to himself, “The birth of this technique is for self-protection when necessary, and it allows one to live a normal life. Obviously, it doesn’t suit me.”

To Qin Yu, he only needed to use a clone to listen at the grand event. Thus he did not have to take such a risk.

Therefore, Qin Yu decided to use only a trace of divine sense to support this clone. It was good enough as long as this clone could live and talk like normal.

In that case, even if he were slapped to death by the people of the nine great aristocratic families, Qin Yu would not care.

After that, Qin Yu spent three days preparing a lot of precious spiritual herbs and magical artifacts and placed them around the room.

He arranged it according to the formation required by the secret technique. Sitting in the center of the formation, he began to concentrate and calm down, stabilizing his divine sense and primordial spirit.

Under the guidance of the secret technique, a trace of Qin Yu’s divine sense flew out from his glabella. This portion of divine sense slowly condensed into an entity under the effect of the formation.

Time passed by. As the quality of this clone was not too high, it did not take long. Soon, his clone gradually took shape.

This clone looked exactly the same as Qin Yu, like his twin. Not only that, but the two bodies also shared the same divine sense and did not interfere with each other. It was perfect for Qin Yu.

After doing all this, Qin Yu quietly waited for the news of the opening of the grand event.

In the inn, Qin Yu sat cross-legged. He closed his eyes slightly and felt the remarkable improvement in his state of mind. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qin Yu had indeed benefited a lot from the battle with Elder Si. Coupled with the enlightenment under the Bodhi ancient tree, Qin Yu now had a deeper comprehension of the dao technique.

Although this level of comprehension was insufficient for Qin Yu to enter the Advance-stage of the Reversion Void, he could comprehend the dao techniques of the Advance-stage of the Reversion Void in a year at most based on his calculations.

“If this trip to the Chaos Grave goes smoothly and I obtain the Traceless Immortal Scripture or even Wu Ji’s corpse, my progress will be unimaginable,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Of course, Qin Yu knew very well that this trip would not be as smooth as he had imagined. Even though he had the supreme bone, he was afraid he would still have a slim chance of survival.

“Let’s split up.” Qin Yu slowly stood up.

There was no point staying in this inn. Qin Yu decided his true body to hide in the Chaos Grave while the clone went to various taverns to gather information.

He concealed his internal qi and found a place to hide for the time being. His eyes were like a beast hiding in the darkness, coldly scanning everything.

The Chaos Grave was no longer as “prosperous” as it used to be. The forceful attacks of the nine great aristocratic families had caused the death qi in the Chaos Grave to become even more terrifying. Even the tomb slaves had become somewhat restless.

“Ah!”

Soon, miserable screams came from the Chaos Grave. Someone seemed to have been torn apart by the tomb slaves.

These people were like flying moths darted into the fire. They knew they would die, but they still rushed forward one after another.

However, Qin Yu did not think that they were stupid. Instead, he was full of emotions

If possible, who would be willing to risk their lives?

In just a few days, even Saint Weapons were shattered. The Chaos Grave was like a battlefield. Blood flowed like a river, and death qi overflowed.

On the other end, Qin Yu’s clone walked around various taverns every day. He covered his face with the brim of his hat and quietly walked to a corner. He ordered two plates of beast meat and a bottle of warm wine and quietly waited for news.

On this day, Qin Yu came to the tavern as usual.

The number of people in the tavern today was clearly much lesser than usual. Only very few customers were chatting idly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He immediately felt that something was wrong.

Therefore, he pressed his hat down and walked to a table. He whispered, “My friend, why are there so few people today?”

The customer glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Most of the people have gone to the grand event of the nine great aristocratic families. Don’t you think those people are stupid? What’s the use of us, the small fries, going? What’s the use of meeting those so-called big shots? They won’t even look at us.”

“That’s right. We should live our own lives. It’s already not bad if we can live our lives peacefully.”

At this moment, Qin Yu was not in the mood to listen to this. He asked impatiently, “Where is the grand event?”

“Look, there’s a fool,” the customer mocked mercilessly.

Qin Yu was not angry. He only said anxiously, “My friend, I have an important matter to attend to at the grand event. If it’s convenient, please let me know.”

“It’s in the Astral Mountain. If you want to go, hurry up. Otherwise, it’ll be too late,” another customer said.

Qin Yu hurriedly thanked him, then turned around and ran out of the tavern.

“Sigh! Young people are really aggressive.”

“That’s right. When I was young back then, I also wanted to do something big and become a famous figure in the Holy Region. But what happened in the end? Society ruined me, and I finally recognized the reality.”

…

Rumor had it that Astral Mountain was at the border of the Holy Region.

After crossing Astral Mountain was the path to the starry sky.

In the depths of Astral Mountain, there was an enormous mountain gate. This mountain gate had been silent for many years. Rumor had it that someone had entered the starry sky to train through this mountain gate some years ago. As for where he had gone, no one knew.

Astral Mountain was incredibly huge. As it was located at the border of the Holy Region, Astral Mountain’s internal qi was tremendously mysterious. Its scenery was incredibly diverse too.

The trees on the mountain reached the sky, and all kinds of spiritual herbs grew everywhere. All kinds of strange beasts shuttled through the forest.

The spiritual energy here was incomparably dense, making people feel relaxed and happy.

Astral Mountain was not only famous for its geographical location but also the many legends and mysterious internal qi. There was a secret place in the mountain called the Starry Sky Mystic Realm. After passing through that mountain gate, one would enter the Starry Sky Mystic Realm followed by the starry sky.

Now, Astral Mountain was the venue for the grand event of the nine great aristocratic families, attracting cultivators from all over the world to participate.

At the foot of the mountain, a temporary built-up city grew like a mushroom. In a short period, a large number of cultivators gathered.

Qin Yu’s clone traveled through days and nights. After some effort, he finally arrived at the foot of Astral Mountain.

He raised his head and saw towering mountains surrounded by clouds, giving off a mysterious feeling.
