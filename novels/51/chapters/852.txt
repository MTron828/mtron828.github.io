Chapter 853: Chapter 853, a casual punch

Looking at Uncle Guan’s arrogant expression, Qin Yu remained silent.

He lowered his head and touched the position of his dantian. Waves of faint pain assaulted him.

Under his repeated blows, Qin Yu’s Dantian had indeed received a great impact.

But no matter what, Qin Yu could be considered to have officially stepped into the perfection realm.

Both his body and strength had been greatly improved.

The spiritual power in his body was as vast as the sea, almost endless. Its density had even exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

It was true that the chaotic body was invincible among those of the same level!

Moreover, there was only a thin line between Qin Yu and this half-step martial saint!

“Why? Are You Afraid?”Uncle Guan said indifferently.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Do you know what you look like in My Eyes?”

Uncle Guan raised his brows, “Oh?”

“The current you is like an ant in my eyes. No matter how you clamor or or jump around, you still look ridiculous,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

When he heard Qin Yu’s words, Uncle Guan could not help but laugh out loud, “You are only at the perfect stage, how dare you speak so arrogantly?”

“What, after possessing the power of a martial saint, do you really think that it is your own strength?”

Qin Yu laughed coldly: “To be honest, the current me is much stronger than when I possessed the power of a martial saint.”

“You are full of nonsense.”Uncle Guan said with a gloomy face.

“Kid, since you are not dead, I will give you a chance to live.”

“Hand over Yan Ruoxue, I can consider sparing your life.”

Qin Yu’s face turned cold, and he said coldly, “There’s only one ending for you if you Miss Yan Ruoxue, and that’s death.”

As he spoke, the killing intent on Qin Yu’s body increased rapidly.

Uncle Guan couldn’t help but frown slightly when he felt the bone-chilling coldness on Qin Yu’s body.

This coldness made him feel a strong sense of danger!

“No, I must kill him as soon as possible!”Uncle Guan said in his heart.

He didn’t waste any more time, and his hands moved quickly in the air.

Streams of inner strength spurted out from his hands and took shape, turning into giant pythons!

The pythons were light blue in color, and their huge heads were swaying in the air.

They were formed from pure spiritual power, and their power was unimaginable.

“Go to hell!”

Uncle Guan shouted and pushed his hands forward. These pythons formed by inner strength rushed toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked at these pythons coldly, and a contemptuous smile appeared on his face.

He slightly clenched his fist and casually threw a punch to meet them!

It seemed to be a simple punch, but it contained the power to destroy the world!

The golden light seemed to shoot out from Qin Yu’s fist, and the golden light instantly covered everyone’s vision!

“Boom!”

With this punch, everything in front of him turned into nothingness! Even the entire space was buzzing, as if it could not withstand this power!

The python that Uncle Guan had transformed into instantly disappeared!

Uncle Guan’s expression changed drastically!

He took two steps back, a trace of fear appearing on his face.

This technique was his famous consummate skill, yet it was shattered by a casual punch?

“What... What technique is this?”Uncle Guan asked in horror.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “It’s not a technique, it’s just a casual punch of mine.”

Casual Punch?

How was this possible? His famous ultimate skill was actually shattered by a casual punch?

“Qin Yu, you...”

“I don’t want to listen to your nonsense.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Every single one of you who came to seek death must say a bunch of useless nonsense before they die.”

“Either beg for mercy or make me wait. I’m tired of listening to it.”

“So... you’d better shut up!”

Before he could finish his words, Qin Yu had already closed in with another punch!

Uncle Guan turned pale with fright! He hurriedly took out his martial saint weapon to deal with it!

Unfortunately, the martial saint weapon was extremely weak in front of Qin Yu.

Under this punch, the radiance emitted by the martial saint weapon was directly swallowed and then exploded!

“Boom!”

The fist smashed onto Uncle Guan’s body!

This punch actually directly smashed uncle Guan’s body!

Pieces of flesh flew everywhere, and the air was emitting a bloody smell.

Qin Yu slowly walked to the front of Uncle Guan.

He took out uncle Guan’s golden core, then raised his palm, and the flesh directly turned into a bloody mist.

The young man who followed Uncle Guan widened his eyes and shivered.

Fear made his body go limp and he fell to the ground.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me...”the young man begged with a trembling voice.

Qin Yu glanced at him and didn’t say anything. He just casually kicked his head to pieces.

After obtaining the two golden cores, Qin Yu slightly closed his eyes and felt the glittering golden core in his dantian.

The golden core seemed to have been injured by Uncle Guan’s several heavy blows. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu carefully observed it, and his expression became more and more unsightly.

A small crack appeared in the Golden Core.

Although the crack wasn’t big, it was clearly visible.

Qin Yu frowned tightly.

Although Qin Yu didn’t feel any discomfort at the moment, no one knew whether this injury would leave behind a hidden disease or what kind of effects it would bring.

“This Hong Yi sect...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth, and his hatred towards Hong Yi sect increased.

“Forget it, I’ll go ask Pavilion Master later. He might have a way,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He turned around and left the ruins. Just as Qin Yu was about to leave the mystic realm, he found Su Qian lying on the ground.

Su Qian’s body was covered in blood, and his internal Qi was extremely weak.

Qin Yu quickly walked in front of her and hurriedly stretched out his hand to transfer Qi/spiritual energy to her, temporarily saving her life.

“Rumble”

At this moment, the mystic realm suddenly started to shake! Whether it was the sky or the ground, both began to collapse at this moment!
