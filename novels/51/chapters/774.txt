Seeing the change in Qin Yu’s expression, the young man immediately became even crazier!

He laughed loudly and said, “Qin Yu! Why, are you very surprised? Do you think that you are number one in this world? I, Jiang Yi, am not convinced!”

“Jiang Yi...” Qin Yu silently said this name and immediately guessed something.

“You are senior Jiang He’s disciple?” Qin Yu suddenly raised his head and asked.

Jiang Yi shouted, “No need to ask. Let’s talk after the fight!”

After saying that, Jiang Yi strode toward Qin Yu!

Jiang Yi’s moves were simple and neat. There was no fancy moves, only pure power!

That incomparably fierce fist made Qin Yu a little absent-minded for a moment!

Jiang Yi’s style was actually somewhat similar to his own!

“Qin Yu, don’t be so distracted!” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but shout.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. His fist instantly flickered with golden light, and then he raised his fist to meet it!

“Bang!”

The two fists collided, causing the ground to rumble!

In an instant, the ground collapsed, and the entire back mountain seemed as if it was about to be shattered!

The two fists collided, but for a moment, the victor couldn’t be determined!

“Go to hell!” Jiang Yi roared again!

The two sides immediately launched the simplest and most extreme collision!

In the blink of an eye, the two sides had already exchanged dozens of punches!

Under this tremendous force, the ground had been completely shattered! However, they still couldn’t decide the winner!

The man with the mustache couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

It was indeed shocking to have a physical body that could fight against a chaotic body!

“This person really has some ability,” the man with the mustache couldn’t help but say in a low voice.

“Boom!”

At this moment, another fist collided!

This time, Qin Yu and Jiang Yi both took three steps back.

The difference was that Jiang Yi was already panting, while Qin Yu still looked calm.

He frowned slightly and said, “Jiang Yi, I’m not your enemy, and you don’t need to compete with me.”

“Cut the crap!” Jiang Yi shouted crazily!

“I want to prove to everyone that I, Jiang Yi, am not inferior to you, Qin Yu!”

Qin Yu’s frown deepened.

Jiang Yi was Jiang He’s disciple, so Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t have the intention to kill him.

However, if there was no winner today, Jiang Yi would obviously not let it go.

“Alright.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“I’ll accompany you in a great battle,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Before he finished his words, Qin Yu’s internal qi started to rise, and his golden radiance erupted to the maximum.

Jiang Yi sneered. “You’d better not hide your strength, or else... You’ll die here!”

“Stop!”

At this moment, Jiang He and the Pavilion Master suddenly stepped forward and blocked the two of them!

When he saw Jiang He, a trace of unwillingness flashed across Jiang Yi’s face!

“Master...” Jiang Yi clenched his teeth.

Jiang He turned to look at Jiang Yi and said in a deep voice, “Why do you insist on fighting Qin Yu?”

Jiang Yi suddenly raised his head and shouted angrily, “Because I’m not convinced! I don’t think I’m inferior to him!”

“Master, I will definitely defeat him today. I will prove to you who is the one who has stepped into the Martial Saint Realm!” Jiang Yi roared crazily.

However, Jiang He shook his head and said, “Jiang Yi, let’s stop here. You are equally outstanding. I have never felt that you are inferior to anyone.”

“Then let me have a big fight with him and determine the winner!” Jiang Yi roared angrily and charged towards Qin Yu again!

However, this time, Jiang He stepped on a secret technique and instantly stood in front of Qin Yu. He raised his hand to receive Jiang Yi’s punch.

The sound was deafening!

The dazzling light made people unable to open their eyes!

“Master!” Jiang Yi clenched his teeth, as if he was extremely unwilling.

At this moment, Qin Yu took a step forward and shook his head. “Senior Jiang He, please satisfy him.”

Jiang He looked at Qin Yu and frowned slightly.

He was silent for a moment, then he sighed slightly and said, “Okay.”

Jiang He moved aside and stepped aside.

“Only today,” Jiang He said.

Jiang Yi didn’t say anything more. He clenched his fist and charged at Qin Yu again.

Although Jiang Yi was Jiang He’s disciple, his moves were completely different from Jiang He’s.

Compared to Jiang He’s elegance, Jiang Yi’s moves were extremely rough. Almost every punch was a collision of extreme power.

Qin Yu no longer restrained his internal qi. His moves were open and unrestrained. Golden light illuminated the world, and he fought with an undefeatable posture.

This battle lasted from day to night. Jiang Yi gasped for breath and vomited blood many times, but he still didn’t give up.

Even Qin Yu was slightly moved by his determination!

Both of their bodies were covered in blood, but their stamina didn’t show any signs of weakening. Instead, they became braver as they fought.

The Pavilion Master couldn’t help but frown and said, “Your disciple is a bit stubborn.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jiang He sighed slightly and said, “Yes, this is his strength and also his weakness.”

“If you don’t guide him, he might walk down another path.” The Pavilion Master was a bit worried.

Jiang He kept silent. He naturally understood this reasoning.

All these years, he had been guiding him.

The battle was still going on. It seemed that both sides would only give up if one of them fell.

“Although Qin Yu didn’t hide his strength, he didn’t use his spells to oppress Jiang Yi,” the man with the mustache said in a low voice.

He knew very well that Qin Yu had a secret technique. If it was really a battle of life and death, Jiang Yi would have fallen long ago.

What Qin Yu did was use the purest power to fight.

“Boom!”

Finally, in the early morning of the next day, Qin Yu punched Jiang Yi’s chest with his golden fist.

Jiang Yi’s body was smashed into the ground, and there were many bloody marks on his body.

He wanted to stand up, but he found that he couldn’t. The bones in his body were almost shattered.

“Ah...” Blood kept pouring out of Jiang Yi’s mouth, but his fighting spirit didn’t decrease.

Qin Yu’s body was bathed in fresh blood. The bright red and golden color merged into one.

Qin Yu walked in front of Jiang Yi and said with his head lowered, “Jiang Yi, I admire you very much. I’m not your enemy.”

Jiang Yi gritted his teeth and said with difficulty, “Qin Yu... Sooner or later, I will kill you...”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He looked at the Pavilion Master and said, “Pavilion Master, I’ll have to trouble you with his injuries.”

The Pavilion Master nodded and said, “Yes.”

Then, Qin Yu said, “I have to return to Jingdu. I have something to take care of.”

“Now?” The Pavilion Master’s brows were slightly furrowed.

She looked at the fresh blood on Qin Yu’s body and seemed somewhat worried.

Qin Yu wiped the blood off his body and smiled. “I’m fine. It’s just a superficial injury.”

Seeing this, the Pavilion Master didn’t say anything more.

Then, Qin Yu walked quickly to the man with the mustache.

“There’s news from Jingdu,” the man with the mustache said.

Qin Yu took the phone and looked at the content on the phone. Qin Yu frowned slightly.
