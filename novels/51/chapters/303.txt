After hearing the Elder’s words, everyone was shocked!

How great an honor was it to be praised by an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?

“Kiddo, I’ll return the Breakthrough Pill to you.” The Elder returned the pill to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took the pill and couldn’t help but frown slightly.

He was a little confused for a moment and became even more suspicious of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“Give it to me!” Seeing this, the stall owner hurriedly snatched the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth back from the hands of the apothecary!

Then, the stall owner looked at Qin Yu with an embarrassed smile and said apologetically, “Sir, I’m sorry. I misunderstood you just now. This Purple Gold Gauze Cloth is yours!”

“Are you serious?” Qin Yu immediately felt a little happy.

The stall owner hurriedly nodded and said, “Absolutely!”

“Alright, then I’ll refine the remaining two pills for you now,” said Qin Yu.

The stall owner hurriedly stopped Qin Yu and shook his head while saying, “Sir, there’s no rush. Using your hands to refine the pill is too cruel. When you succeed in refining it in the future, just give the pill to me.”

Qin Yu said somewhat gratefully, “Thank you very much!”

Just as the two of them were conversing, the Elder looked at the apothecary coldly.

“This is clearly a Breakthrough Pill. Why did you say that it was a failed pill?” The Elder questioned coldly.

The pharmacist’s head was immediately covered in sweat and he was incomparably nervous.

He braced himself and said, “Elder... Elder, I’m sorry. I was ignorant and made a mistake.”

“Ignorant and made a mistake?” The Elder immediately shouted!

“The Breakthrough Pill is stored in an extremely large amount in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Almost everyone has one. You say that you made a mistake? If you only have such subpar abilities, you’re not worthy of staying in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” The Elder said coldly.

The pharmacist immediately panicked. He hurriedly knelt on the ground and begged for mercy, “Elder, I know I was wrong. I. . . was just blinded by greed for a moment, so I lied. Please forgive me this time. I beg you...”

The Elder said with a cold smile, “You have tarnished the reputation of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. You’re even less worthy of staying in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“From now on, you’re no longer a pharmacist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Get lost!”

“Please don’t, Elder. I really know my mistake. Give me another chance!” The apothecary shouted crazily.

Unfortunately, the Elder didn’t give him a chance at all.

The Elder extended his finger and his Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s token immediately shattered.

Such a scene made the crowd sigh.

“Kiddo, I wonder if you’re interested in coming to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion as a guest?” At this moment, the Elder looked at Qin Yu with a smile.

Everyone was shocked again!

Qin Yu was actually invited by an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? How honorable was this?

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “If I have time, I will definitely pay a visit.”

The Elder laughed loudly and said, “Alright, I will wait for you at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”

Qin Yu bowed to him as a show of respect.

The Elder didn’t stay any longer and quickly turned around to leave.

After he had left, everyone surrounded Qin Yu, then started to praise and curry favor with him.

“Mr. Qin, my name is Wang Bao. If you need anything from me, just let me know!”

“I have a 300-year-old Chinese knotweed at home! If you like it, Mr. Qin, feel free to take it!”

“Mr. Qin, I am willing to pay 50 million for you to treat my illness!”

Looking at the enthusiastic crowd, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Rumor had it that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was extremely prestigious. Seeing it today, he realized it really lived up to its reputation.

After thanking them one by one, Qin Yu put away his Purple Gold Gauze Cloth and left with Yao Qing.

“Mr. Qin, I really didn’t expect that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion would actually take a fancy to you. You will gey rich in the future!” Yao Qing said excitedly.

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, “It was just a casual invitation. Don’t take it too seriously.”

“Casual invitation? Mr. Qin, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has never taken the initiative to invite anyone!” Yao Qing said, as if it was a matter of fact.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and his mind raced.

Joining the Divine Alchemist Pavilion might really be a good choice.

In this way, he could at least obtain more resources and close the distance with Han Wei.

“Let’s go.” Qin Yu didn’t continue this topic.

Yao Qing asked in puzzlement, “Where are we going?”

“To find Dong Tianhai,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The venue of the medicinal Herbs Convention was extremely large, and the number of visitors was terrifyingly high.

However, it wasn’t difficult to find Dong Tianhai.

Since he was known as the King of Medicine, there would naturally be many people who worshiped him.

As expected, Qin Yu found Dong Tianhai at an extremely conspicuous location.

“I’ve finally found you,” Qin Yu said with narrowed eyes.

Yao Qing frowned and said, “Mr. Qin, there are many people in front of his stall, and there are also many top-notch martial artists. Isn’t it a bit dangerous for us to go there just like this?”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “Don’t worry. I have my own countermeasures.”

There were countless people standing in front of Dong Tianhai’s stall.

“Mr. Dong, we finally meet again.”

“Mr. Dong, I have a Divine Medicine here. Can you take a look at it?”

“Master Dong, how much is this herb?”

When facing the crowd of people, Dong Tianhai had a very arrogant attitude.

He closed his eyes and said indifferently, “Then exchange it for herbs of the same rank or a treasure. No bargaining.”

In the face of Dong Tianhai’s arrogance, no one was angry. On the contrary, all of them were humble.

“Master Dong, how much are these three herbs?”

At this moment, a familiar voice sounded.

Dong Tianhai suddenly opened his eyes and hurriedly looked over.

“Qin... Qin Yu? You’re actually alive?” Dong Tianhai’s expression was a bit ugly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Why? Do you really want me to die that bad?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Dong Tianhai’s expression was somewhat flustered. The three herbs in Qin Yu’s hands, each of them more than 500 years old, could be said to be priceless treasures!

“Master Dong, have you forgotten what you promised me?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and a murderous aura rushed towards Dong Tianhai.

Dong Tianhai pretended to be calm and said, “Qin Yu, you’d better not act recklessly. This is the Herbs Convention, and the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is keeping order.”

Qin Yu ignored him and put the three herbs into his Spatial Magic Artifact.

Dong Tianhai’s expression changed, and he hurriedly berated, “Qin Yu, are you going to rob me openly? You’re violating the rules!”

“Violating the rules?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, and then sneered. “What rule did I violate? I’m just taking back my own things. Is there a problem?”

“You!” Dong Tianhai was so angry that blue veins popped out!

He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, don’t force me. My power here is beyond your imagination!”

“Oh really? Is that so? I really want to see it.” Qin Yu sneered.

“Do you really want to do this?” Dong Tianhai stood up angrily and said.

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you think I’m joking with you?”

“Okay! You forced me to do this!” Dong Tianhai said angrily.

Then, he looked at the Inner Strength Grandmasters who were slowly walking over and said, “Please wait! If you’re willing to solve a small problem for me, I, Dong Tianhai, will owe you guys a favor!”

As soon as he said this, the three Inner Strength Grandmasters immediately came over after hearing the news.

“Master Dong, what problem is there?” The three people asked politely.

Dong Tianhai pointed at Qin Yu and said through gritted teeth, “Teach him a lesson!”

The three immediately looked at Qin Yu.

However, when they saw Qin Yu’s face clearly, they said in surprise, “Mr. Qin, why are you here?”
