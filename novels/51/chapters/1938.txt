1939 The Royal Family of Sky City

Sky City was full of legends. Rumor had it that the people who lived here were once the real royal family, who was also the real ruler of the Holy Region.

However, this royal family was overthrown by the eight great aristocratic families in the late stage and declined since then.

Fortunately, the eight great aristocratic families were rather magnanimous. They jointly dominated Sky City and provided endless resources for the declined royal family. Now, the city was jointly dominated by the nine great aristocratic families.

As such, the royal family still lived a far more comfortable life and was far more powerful than ordinary people.

The reason Qin Yu came to Sky City, firstly, was to try his luck to see if he could encounter any opportunities.

Secondly, to tell the world he truly wasn’t afraid of the Si family. At the same time, he wanted to see how the Si family would react.

“Sky City truly lives up to its name.” Walking on the streets of Sky City, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

Most of those who lived in Sky City were descendants of the royal family back then. Although they had long lost their power, they still maintained a great deal of pride.

As for the buildings in Sky City, they were exuding an air of extravagance. At a glance, each looked like the building of the ancient royal family.

As Sky City was jointly dominated by the nine great aristocratic families, this place was tremendously safe. No one would choose to cause trouble here, and the Si family was no exception.

The shouts of street vendors were non-stop in the surroundings. They were much louder compared to the ordinary market.

There were all sorts of stone gamblings and auctions here. At the same time, the biggest stone gambling market and auction house in Holy Region were also in Sky City.

Their names were also very straightforward. They were Sky City Gambling House and Sky City Auction House.

Unlike ordinary gambling houses, the gambling houses here did not resort to fraud. As treasures had been excavated from many natural ores, Sky City Gambling House was packed with people.

Of course, most people who came to Sky City to look for opportunities were half-baked fools like Qin Yu. They had some ability but were still far from top-notch.

Those at the top would probably have to travel more than half of the Holy Region if they wanted to seek opportunities.

“Let’s go to the gambling house first,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He rushed to Sky City Gambling House which was bustling with people and nowhere to stay.

Qin Yu counted the money in his hands. As he still had a lot of money, he could choose a lot of natural ores.

“A treasure is out. It’s a thousand-year-old Divine Medicine!”

As soon as Qin Yu stepped in, he heard a loud shout!

Immediately after, everyone looked in that direction!

Qin Yu clicked his tongue and mumbled, “As expected of the number one gambling house in the world. This thousand-year-old Divine Medicine is like free of charge.”

Compared to the thousand-year-old Divine Medicine on earth, the Divine Medicine in Holy Region was more valuable. After all, this place had always been on the path of cultivation, and the spiritual energy had never been exhausted.

Of course, even though a thousand-year-old Divine Medicine was extremely valuable, it was not top-notch.

The nine great aristocratic families probably had herbs that were a hundred thousand years old or even a million years old in their hands to supply to their children for their breakthroughs in the future.

Since he had come to the gambling house, Qin Yu didn’t hold back and immediately started to make his move.

After all, Qin Yu had 50 billion spirit coins in his hands. He had enough to spend for a few days regardless he won or lost.

In the following few days, Qin Yu obtained many treasures with the help of the desolate divine eye.

They were the ten-thousand-year-old spiritual medicine, the Saint’s bones, supreme-grade materials, and others. Each item drew the crowd’s cheers.

Soon, someone in the crowd recognized Qin Yu.

“That kid seems to be Qin Yu. The one recently clamored at Shi Shiyue, was he?”

“It’s him. This kid offended the Si family. Instead of finding a place to hide, he came to Sky City in a lofty manner. And he even came to Sky City Gambling House!”

“It seems he doesn’t care about the Si family at all!”

“However, the Si family most probably won’t make a move on him. Wouldn’t that lower their status?”

Soon, the news of Qin Yu’s appearance in Dky City spread like wildfire.

In the Si family, Si Shiyue’s face was ashen.

As he listened to the reports of his subordinates, the veins on his forehead kept bulging.

“This Qin Yu… I have never provoked him, but he actually did such a thing!” Si Shiyue said angrily.

The person beside him smiled bitterly and said, “This kid is deliberately trying to extort you. He knows that you have a noble status and won’t lower yourself to his level. If you attack him, it will tarnish Holy Son’s reputation.”

Si Shiyue gritted his teeth. He had been in Holy Region for so many years, but this was the first time he had encountered such a shameless person!

“Do we just let him do whatever he wants out there? Isn’t this even more embarrassing for the Si family? ” Si Shiyue said coldly.

Si Shifeng, by the side, stepped forward and said with a smile, “Brother Yue, you can’t do anything, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. How about I teach him a lesson for you?”

Si Shiyue glanced at Si Shifeng, shook his head, and said, “There’s no need for that.”

“I think Young Master Feng is right. He could send Qin Yu a challenge letter and have an open contest,” someone said.

Si Shifeng also nodded and said, “That’s right. You’re in a critical period of your breakthrough. You can’t let such a small matter affect your state of mind.”

Upon hearing this, Si Shiyue couldn’t help but sigh.

He clasped his hands behind his back and said slowly, “I seem to have lost my direction. No matter how hard I try, I can’t get close to the Semi-Saint cultivation realm. It’s like a cloud of fog in front of me, preventing me from advancing further.”

During this time, the Si family poured massive resources into Si Shiyue. He had swallowed countless spirit medicines, more so the spirit pills. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

As for enlightenment and mental state secret treasures, they were not stingy at all. They had given them all to Si Shiyue, but he still showed no signs of a breakthrough.

There were many geniuses in Holy Region. Besides Si Shiyue, the sons of several other aristocratic families were also striving. Everyone wanted to be the first person to touch the word “Saint” in the Golden Age, and this also put a lot of pressure on Si Shiyue.

“Brother Yue, it happens that there’s a temple fair in Sky City. It’s a rare event that only happens once in a hundred years. Why don’t we take this opportunity to relax and meet that kid, Qin Yu? ” Si Shifeng suggested.

Si Shiyue was silent for a while, then nodded and said, “You accompany me there then.”

“What if we bump into Qin Yu?” Si Shifeng asked.

...

After thinking for a long time, a trace of coldness flashed through Si Shiyue’s eyes, and he said coldly, “Do as you see fit.”

“I got it.” Si Shifeng didn’t say anything else and immediately retreated to the side.

In Sky City.

In the past few days, Qin Yu did not leave the gambling house. Although he had gained a lot, there was nothing Qin Yu wanted.

“Tsk! Tsk! Speaking of which, I’ve been in Sky City for a few days. How could it be so quiet?” Qin Yu touched his chin and thought to himself.

Qin Yu had offended the Si family, which meant he had offended countless people.

Countless people wanted to curry favor with the Si family and use this opportunity to stand out.
