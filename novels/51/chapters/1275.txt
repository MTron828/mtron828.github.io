Chapter 1276: Chapter 1,276, soul refining clothes 

This raw stone was very different from the ones on Earth. The sealing of internal Qi was a unique skill. It was very difficult to sense anything from this raw stone, unless one was a top master.

As the raw stone was slowly cut open, traces of internal Qi leaked out.

Traces of green liquid were slowly flowing out of the raw stone.

“A Babe has appeared! It’s ambergris!”Someone exclaimed.

The Master of the shop at the side also hurriedly collected the ambergris.

“Sir, do you want this ambergris?”The master asked.

Qin Yu asked in puzzlement, “What do you mean?”

“Sir, it looks like this is your first time here. If you want it, it’s yours. If you don’t want it, we’ll take it back,”the master said.

He looked at the ambergris and said, “This is about 40,000 spirit coins.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“I don’t want it.”Qin Yu waved his hand without thinking.

“You are lucky,”Guan Zhuangzhuang said in surprise.

Qin Yu whispered, “The good show has just begun.”

After saying that, Qin Yu activated the desolate God’s eye again and looked at the raw stone.

“Help me open that one.”Qin Yu pointed at a raw stone and said.

The raw stone slowly opened and a treasure dropped out once again.

This was a weapon. Although it was not expensive, the recovery price was at 50,000 spirit coins.

“I want that one too.”

The third piece opened and another treasure dropped out.

This could not help but make the people around cry out in surprise. They all looked at Qin Yu, their eyes filled with passion.

“I want that one too, and that one too.”

One by one, the raw stones were cut open, and each piece produced a treasure.

This made the Master of the stone gambling shop’s expression turn extremely ugly.

In less than two hours, Qin Yu had already earned a total of three hundred thousand spirit coins.

If this continued, they would probably lose money to death.

Guan Zhuang, who was watching from the side, had a face full of excitement. As someone who liked to gamble, he couldn’t help but feel his hands itching.

Just as Qin Yu was having a good time, the genius youth from the Heavenly Cloud sect had arrived at the Imperial Palace of Gu City.

The city Lord of Gu City rushed out to personally welcome him.

“Young Master Ling Yun, why are you here?”The city Lord walked over and asked with a smile.

The youth known as Ling Yun looked at the city Lord coldly. His cold gaze made one’s heart turn cold.

Even the city Lord of Gu City couldn’t help but feel uneasy.

Ling Yun ignored the city Lord and Strode into the Imperial Palace.

Even though the city lord was puzzled, he didn’t dare to think too much and quickly followed.

Ling Yun wasn’t old, only seventeen years old. However, his aura wasn’t inferior to the city Lord’s.

At this moment, Ling Yun was sitting on the city Lord’s throne. His eyes were slightly closed, and no one knew what he was thinking about.

The entire great hall was silent. No one dared to breathe loudly.

After an unknown period of time, Ling Yun finally spoke.

He looked at the city lord and said, “I’m looking for a person named Qin Yu. Someone said that he disappeared near Gu City.”

“Qin Yu? Who Is He?”The city Lord seemed a little puzzled.

Ling Yun’s words were extremely simple. “A dead person.”

The city Lord’s expression changed drastically.

“What do you want me to do?”The city Lord asked.

“I’ll try my best to find him,”Ling Yun replied coldly.

The city lord nodded slightly. “Alright, I’ll try my best.”

Gu city had a large population and was highly mobile. Many people came here to search for treasures.

Therefore, it wasn’t that easy to find a person.

The city lord said, “I can only seal the city immediately and investigate. However, if that’s the case, we will face a problem.”

“If there are any important figures in Gu City who are stationed here, they will definitely be unhappy if they are sealed in the city. At that time, I’m afraid that it will be troublesome.”

Ling Yun’s eyes immediately flashed with a cold light.

He looked at the city lord coldly and said, “I don’t want to hear any excuses. I want to see the results within three days.”

The city Lord said in a deep voice, “Young Master Ling Yun, I’m Afraid I Need a promise from you. If you offend someone who shouldn’t be offended because of the city’s closure, your Tianyun sect will have to take responsibility for it.”

Ling Yun’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a hint of displeasure appeared on his face.

“Since it’s the Tianyun sect’s business, I think no one will not give us face, no matter how important the person is.”

Fortunately, the people around Ling Yun helped to mediate the situation, which stopped Ling Yun’s anger.

“Your words are enough.”The city lord nodded.

“I will order them to seal the city now.”

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was having a good time in the stone gambling shop.

He had earned more than a million dollars. This exaggerated figure made everyone excited.

“It’s about time to leave. If you continue playing, the shop owner will become angry from embarrassment,”Guan Zhuang reminded him.

Qin Yu agreed. He pointed at a raw stone and said, “The last one.”

Although the shop owner was unwilling, he didn’t want to shed all pretense of cordiality in front of so many people.

As the raw stone was cut open, rays of golden light burst out.

A dazzling light flashed past, and then a treasure that looked like a gauze robe appeared in front of everyone.

This treasure was somewhat ethereal, and it seemed to be neither real nor real. It was extremely strange, but anyone could tell that it was extraordinary.

“It’s the spirit refinement robe?”At this moment, someone in the crowd suddenly said.

“That’s right, it’s exactly the same as the spirit refinement robe in the records!”

“Friend, your luck is so good that you actually obtained a spirit refinement garment!”

Qin Yu asked in puzzlement, “What’s the spirit refinement garment for?”

The person next to him explained, “You don’t even know about the spirit refinement garment? Rumor has it that this item is used to protect the primordial spirit. As long as you refine this item, it’s like attaching a layer of armor to the primordial spirit!”

Without waiting for Qin Yu to be surprised, the shop’s master quickly walked over.

He cupped his hands and said, “Friend, our shop is willing to take back this item at a price of one million spirit coins.”

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head.

To Qin Yu, this spirit refining robe was an item that he needed immediately.

He had a powerful physical body, but he had always been worried that his primordial spirit would be chopped off.

If he obtained this item, it would be like adding wings to a tiger!

“I’m sorry, I’ll take this item,”said Qin Yu.

The master immediately frowned and subconsciously looked behind him.

After a while, a middle-aged man walked out.
