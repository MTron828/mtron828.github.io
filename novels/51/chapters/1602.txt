Qin Yu’s body emitted an extremely intense golden radiance. The killing intent emitted from his body even engulfed the entire Sichuan immortal mountain!

“Kill him!”Someone shouted from below.

“Qin Yu, you must kill this bastard. You must not let him leave the Southern Province Alive!”

“This bastard, kill him and bury him with Xiao Hai!”

Qin Yu looked at Yong Ji coldly and said, “You saw it, right? Everyone wants to kill you.”

Yong Ji laughed loudly and said, “So what? Qin Yu, do you think I’m afraid of You Now?”

“Then stop talking nonsense and do it!”Qin Yu took a step forward and clenched his golden fist. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Wait, I’m not here to fight with you today.”At this time, Yong Ji waved his hand and took out a broken shirt.

He held the shirt and said indifferently, “This is a gift for you.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

Yong Ji glanced at the grave below and sneered, “It’s not a good meaning to bury an empty grave. This is Xiao Hai’s shirt. I’ll give it to you.”

After saying that, Yong Ji waved his hand and threw the broken shirt into the distance!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly as he hurriedly chased after him using the line word formula.

He grabbed the clothes in his hand and looked down. It was indeed Xiao Hai’s clothes!

At this moment, Yong Ji and the others also took this opportunity to quickly leave.

“Qin Yu, don’t worry. I will come and find you soon.”Yong Ji’s arrogant voice reverberated throughout the entire Sichuan Immortal Mountain!

“Where the F * ck are you going? !”Qin Yu immediately flew into a rage and was about to chase after him.

At this moment, Monk Hongxi stopped Qin Yu.

He shook his head and said, “There’s no need to chase after him. Since he dared to come, he must have a way to escape.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He looked at the clothes in his hands and felt extremely pained.

All his fantasies vanished into thin air at this moment. There were even people crying silently below.

At this moment, all their fantasies vanished into thin air.

Xiao Hai had probably really fallen.

“Yongji... I will definitely not let you off,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Following that, Qin Yu placed the clothes and the fragments of the mask into the stone coffin.

Under everyone’s gaze, Monk Hongxi slowly placed the stone coffin into a golden well.

As a cloud of dust rose up, the grave was slowly buried. A huge stone tablet stood in front of them with four words written on it: Xiao Hai’s grave.

Looking at the tombstone in front of them, everyone felt a level of pain in their hearts.

“Senior Xiao Hai, we will definitely not let you down.”Qin Yu took a deep breath and bowed deeply to the tombstone three times.

Raindrops fell from the sky as if they were sending Xiao Hai off.

...

Yong Ji and the other two quickly escaped from this place.

“Why don’t you kill him directly?”Baro said coldly.

Yong Ji glanced at Baro and shook his head, “Do you have absolute confidence to defeat him?”

“You don’t, but I do.”Baro snorted coldly.

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and sneered, “You mean you are stronger than me?”

Baro laughed, “What else? Speaking of which, I don’t think we have ever fought before.”

“Why? Do you want to try?”

As they spoke, their internal Qi became stronger and stronger, as if they were going to attack at any time.

At this time, Rui Yi berated them, “Stop right there. The god King did not send you to the south region to cause internal strife.”

Yong Ji snorted coldly and said, “Baro, don’t worry. When this matter is completed, I will definitely satisfy you.”

“That’s what I want.”Baro did not back down.

Rui Yi looked at the three of them and said, “It’s time to get down to business.”

With that, he took out a list.

The list was filled with names one after another. There were hundreds of people on the list.

These people were the top people in the South Province. They were either the sect leader of a certain sect or the young talents of the younger generation.

It took forever for Yong Ji and the other two to draw up the list.

“Alright, Let’s start with the first one,”Rui Yi said coldly.

...

After Xiao Hai was buried, Qin Yu, Qu Zhu, and the others also returned to wind bamboo mountain.

In the next few days, Qin Yu did not leave wind bamboo mountain. He wanted to go into seclusion, but he was a little worried, afraid that the northern lands would suddenly attack him.

“Yongji and the others definitely didn’t come to the southern region to deliver that piece of clothing,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Qu zhu sighed and said, “Yeah, just wait and see. The southern region is going to be in chaos.”

As expected, in the next few days, a large number of cultivators from the northern lands entered the southern region.

They launched an attack on the various large sects. This time, it was no longer limited to ordinary people. Everyone became their target.

Green Rock sect.

The entire sect was covered in corpses and rivers of blood.

In the Great Hall of Green Rock sect, Yong Ji and the other two were sitting in front of the sect leader.

“How about it? Either you follow me to the northern lands, or I’ll kill you,”Yong Ji said indifferently.

The sect leader of Green Rock sect gritted his teeth and said angrily, “F * ck you! Even if I die, I won’t join forces with people like you!”

Yong ji sneered and said, “Alright, then I will send you on your way.”

After saying that, Yong Ji’s palm emitted a light and slapped toward the sect master of the Green Rock sect.

The entire great hall instantly exploded and turned into ruins, and the sect master of the Green Rock sect also turned into a corpse.

Yong Ji put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Next, it’s time to go to another one.”

Beside him, Baro said with some sarcasm, “Do you only know how to pick these soft persimmons? What’s the point?”

Yong Ji’s expression turned cold as he said, “What do you mean? I’ve tolerated you for a long time!”

Baro laughed loudly and said, “Yong Ji, should I say that you’re cautious, or that you’re as timid as a mouse?”

“From today onwards, you and I will go our separate ways and do our own things. How about it?”

Yong ji sneered and said, “That would be my wish.”

“Alright!”Baro shouted loudly, “I will go and Challenge Qin Yu right now. Do you dare? !”

Yong Ji was also enraged. He gritted his teeth and said, “Why wouldn’t I dare? ! I’m afraid that Qin Yu will not be able to do it!”

“Hahahaha! Leave Qin Yu to me. You Go and kill Qu Zhu. How about that?”Baro said with some sarcasm.

Feng Hai stood up and said, “Leave the monk to me. I want to fight him too.”

Yong Ji gritted his teeth and said, “I’ll take care of Qin Yu. You deal with Qu Zhu.”

“Okay!”Baro agreed without thinking.

Rui Yi frowned and said, “That’s not what we want. We want to create panic, not...”

“If we kill these three, they’ll panic even more. Who will stop us then?”Baro interrupted Rui Yi.

He handed the list to Rui Yi and said, “I’ll leave the names on the list to you.”

After saying that, Baro turned and left.
