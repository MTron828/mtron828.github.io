Chapter 1653: Chapter 1,653, the battle against the Lord of the northern lands! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Void return pill?”Qin Yu was startled and immediately turned pale with fright!

Void return pill was a rare treasure. Even with Qin Yu’s technique, he was unable to refine it!

This Jing Bai actually had a void return pill hidden in his hands? And it was left behind by the group leader?

“How did the group leader have this thing? Then why didn’t you consume this pill back then?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Jing Bai sighed slightly and said, “Zhong Wu is still one of us after all. Team Leader said that this thing is used to resist foreign enemies.”

“Moreover... the side effects of this thing are extremely great. No one will use it unless it’s a critical moment, unless the hunter organization is in the midst of destruction.”

Following that, Jing Bai stuffed the return to void pill into Qin Yu’s hands.

“Now that I’m handing it over to you, it’s still the same. Unless it’s a critical moment, don’t use this thing,”Jing Bai said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu held the void-returning pill and frowned. “If you give it to me, what will you do if the hunter organization has a disaster in the future?”

Jing Bai smiled bitterly. “If the entire South Province Falls, does the hunter organization still have a purpose to exist?”

At this point, Jing Bai changed the topic and said in a relaxed tone, “Besides, there’s still you. It’s enough for you to protect the hunter organization in the future.”

Qin Yu took the pill and said in a deep voice, “Okay, Jing Bai, thank you.”

Jing Bai waved his hand and said, “Take this pill and leave quickly.”

Qin Yu nodded and quickly left the hunter organization with the pill in his hand.

It had to be said that the pressure on Qin Yu at this moment was extremely great.

It was as if the entire South Province had placed their hopes on Qin Yu.

At the same time.

A large number of cultivators from the northern lands had arrived at Mount Yingning.

The huge mountain was filled with black-robed men.

At a glance, it was quite a spectacular sight.

Many famous people from the southern province had also rushed to this place, as if they wanted to spectate the battle.

Both sides had formed an extreme opposition. They stood to one side and looked at each other coldly.

The elementalist was rather calm. He even set up a banquet here to welcome everyone.

“The huge southern region actually wants a junior to stand out.”The elementalist could not help but sigh.

“The development of the southern region is so abnormal. It’s really surprising.”

In the entire world, which place did not have many geniuses? Which place did not have many outstanding young people?

Many geniuses were no weaker than the older generation, but the southern region was an exception.

There were very few geniuses of the younger generation, and those who could be called by their names could be counted on one hand.

Yong Ji, who was at the side, kept silent. He was the one who caused this situation.

Almost all the geniuses of the younger generation had become his foster sons. In his hands, these geniuses simply couldn’t play their due role.

As for the experts of the older generation, they were also deformed.

Which region did not have a few top-notch people standing on the mountain peaks? However, only the South region was ridiculously rare.

And the reason for this situation was because of the battle at the Heavenly Cloud sect back then.

Xiao Sheng’s strength had almost suppressed all the experts of the South region to the point that they could not breathe. In fact, he had even massacred them all.

If not for the kind-hearted Xiao Hai, the nine holes would have long ceased to exist.

“Boom!”

At this moment, Wen Wanji rushed over. He glanced at the young elementalist and immediately gave him the middle finger.

Wen Dawen er, who was following behind them, also imitated Wen Wanji and gave him the middle finger.

The elementalist did not mind. Instead, he revealed a smile on his face as if he was laughing at their immature behavior.

Soon, more people arrived one after another.

The sect leaders of the major sects were looking at the elementalist coldly. Zhuo Jing and the others also arrived.

“I’m afraid that this battle will affect the future of the entire southern province.”

“No matter what, at least Qin Yu has stepped forward. Regardless of victory or defeat, we must protect his life.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“That’s easy to say. Protect his life? who has the ability to do that?”

As he spoke, a graceful figure arrived.

Everyone was shocked when they saw this person!

“Qu Zhu? Aren’t you dead?”Wen Wanli shouted first.

Qu Zhu shook his head and said weakly, “I was only heavily injured and luckily survived.”

The elementalist in front was also a little surprised when he saw Qu Zhu.

“I remember... You died at my hands. How did you come back to life?”The elementalist asked in surprise.

Qu Zhu smiled and said, “If you had left a minute later, I might have already died.”

“Oh? It seems that you have a lot of connections,”the elementalist sighed.

Qu Zhu did not say anything. He quietly found a seat and sat down.

“Is that old bald donkey still alive?”At this moment, the elementalist rubbed his chin and muttered.

The old bald donkey was clearly worthy of being called a monk of the Hong Xi sect.

The elementalist could not help but feel a little expectant.

A moment later, the monk of the Hong Xi sect arrived.

Upon seeing this scene, the elementalist could not help but stand up excitedly.

“Hahahaha! He’s actually still alive!”The elementalist could not help but laugh out loud.

He looked at the monk of the Hong Xi sect and said, “You guys really surprised me. You guys really surprised me. hahaha!”

The monk of Hongxi bowed slightly to the elementalist and then led him into the crowd.

“Master, let me kill them.”Sima bei volunteered.

The elementalist waved his hand and said, “No, I don’t want to kill them now.”

Then, the elementalist looked at Yongji and said with great interest, “I think you have some life-saving methods, right?”

Yong Ji bowed slightly and did not answer.

The elementalist did not continue asking questions. He stretched his body and quietly waited for Qin Yu’s arrival.

Many northern land cultivators were standing around Ying Ning Mountain.

Their bodies were filled with killing intent, and they could attack at any time.

Three days later.

Qin Yu stepped on the Godly Eagle and came over!

His figure did not look strong. In fact, he was a little thin and weak.

But at this moment, in the eyes of everyone, he was incomparably tall and Big!

Qin Yu had arrived!

Everyone looked in the direction of Qin Yu in unison!

The northern land cultivators who were standing around Mount Ying Ning stood out with surging killing intent, blocking Qin Yu’s path.

These people were all carefully selected by the northern land gnomes and had gone through countless life and death situations to survive. They were extremely powerful, or else they would have long been reduced to nourishment. They were definitely not people that the ordinary cultivators of the southern region could compare with.

“Those who dare to provoke the master, Kill Without Mercy!”

They all shouted in unison. Their imposing manner was unparalleled, as if they had come with the determination to die!

Qin Yu did not utter a single word. He raised his hand and threw out a golden fist, directly shattering their bodies and primordial spirit!

Another northern land cultivator made a move. A pitch-black longsword pierced straight into Qin Yu’s forehead!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold, and golden light instantly erupted from his body. That terrifying internal Qi shattered the Longsword, and the sword shard pierced into the northern land cultivator’s forehead, taking his life.

But even so, these northern land cultivators were still like Death Warriors, Blocking Qin Yu!
