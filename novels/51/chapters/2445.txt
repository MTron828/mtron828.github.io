After that, the black and white reapers exerted force and pulled it downward.

Qin Yu’s body suddenly exploded into countless Dure ghostly Qi. The body he had just condensed could not withstand this force at all.

“You’re courting death!”

Qin Yu’s soul suddenly turned into a massive black hole, and a terrifying sucking force emitted again.

The suction force of the Northern Underworld Demonic Technique and the Chain of Dark Soul confronted each other.

Qin Yu’s looked solemn. The Soul Guiding Power these two activated was something that even the Northern Underworld Demonic Technique was powerless for a short while.

However, the faces of Xie Bi’an and Fan Wujiu also revealed an expression of astonishment.

This was their most powerful technique. Under the Soul Guiding Power, even a ghost king-level living being could not resist.

Numerous souls in the surroundings had been sucked into the terrifying vortex and transformed into the purest power of the soul.

A massive qi of Yin Sword gradually formed.

After numerous souls from the ghost realm entered it, the balance between Yin and Yang was broken. The Yin power conquered all the power of the Yin and Yang road.

Just as the Yang power was about to fully disperse and transform, the Yin Way of the Sword reaching the heavens slashed out.

In an instant, a crisp bell-like sound rang out in the sky, and the Yin Sword directly shattered the Soul Guiding Chain.

Xie Bi’an and Fan Wujiu’s bodies instantly suffered severe injuries. The massive backlash caused them to be severely injured.

The Way of Yin and Yang was a sword technique of the two realms.

In the ghost realm, the Yin power could be unleashed to the greatest extent. It was the most formidable sword move that Qin Yu could unleash.

All of a sudden, Wen Da, suppressed by Qin Yu, burst out and emitted fire of soul.

Taking the opportunity of the instant Qin Yu attacked, he forcefully burned his soul and unleashed his most powerful attack.

The yellow internal qi spread. As soon as Qin Yu’s soul came into contact with this internal qi, a massive surge of his soul power evaporated as if it had encountered sulfuric acid.

While Qin Yu was in a flurry, Wen Da’s soul broke free.

He stood in the air in a daze as if he had forgotten what he wanted to do. After burning his soul, his soul became tremendously weak. It could not even compare to the ordinary people he had encountered behind Dark Mountain.

The light of the ghost moon shone on his soul, and his soul became transparent.

Qin Yu let out a roar. He stared at the soul that had returned to its transparent state with eyes widened in rage.

Northern Underworld Demonic Technique suddenly wrapped up the entire space and sucked in all the power.

However, he could not find a single memory. Even though he used Soul Torment Mind Technique, he could not find Wen Da’s memories at all.

“It’s useless. His soul’s mental ability has almost depleted. He has also burned the power of the origin of his soul. It might be a good thing if he can enter the Six Paths of Reincarnation smoothly after this. Otherwise, he will be like a wandering ghost in the netherworld, and what can he do?”

The young man seemed to be used to it.

“Is this how the ghost realm plays with the hearts of living beings?”

Qin Yu’s eyes welled up wih tears as he clenched his fists tightly.

He could feel Wen Da’s pain. He had lost his memory, but an inexplicable memory was guiding him. That feeling would drive him crazy.

With Wen Da’s forthright personality, he wondered how much pain he went through to become like this.

“This is the way of the Primordial Chaos in ancient times. If you want to take back your mental ability, you must become stronger. Accumulate enough merit points, and you can take back your memories. Otherwise, you will only become the nourishment of the ghost realm. The ghost realm is at the far end of the alien race’s plane. Through this method, some terrifying living beings ultimately emerge, including the black and white reapers. As long as the ghost realm exists, countless Xie Bi’an and Fan Wujiu will take over. This is the capital for the ghost realm to always exist.”

The young man pointed at himself.

“It’s not just me, but the ten Yama, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, and the masked woman, the living beings searching for their mental ability. They just want to find that obsession.”

“What?”

Fear instantly filled Qin Yu’s eyes. Even the masked woman was only a living being controlled by the ghost realm. How powerful was the foundation of this ghost realm?

“Boom!”

At this moment, the Yellow Springs Mark erupted again.

The Soul Guiding Power this time was nearly twice as strong as before.

Caught off guard, a small portion of his mental ability was sucked into ghost moon.

“You don’t have much time left. The Yellow Springs Mark will activate different powers according to different people. From this portion of power, the ghost moon should have high expectations from you. However, I don’t think you’re worth my investment.”

The young man seemed a little disappointed but did not leave.

Qin Yu did not respond. He was currently in a mysterious and eerie state.

He seemed to have lost some of his memories, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not locate that missing part of his memory.

It was like having dreamt of a mirage. It was so close, yet he could not see through the fog in front of him.

This feeling simply drove him crazy. He held Evil Eye in his hand.

The scarecrow in his arm seemed to have sensed his anger, and its indented hollow eye sockets seemed to have started distorting.

The reddish-brown soul power was released without any concealment. The living beings around him withered almost instantly, turning into merit points and entering his Yellow Springs Mark.

“The Way of the Curse of the sorcerer tribe? This saber is not simple.”

The young man revealed an interested expression.

The sorcerer tribe’s power of the curse was a mysterious power from the sea of the Path of Heaven in the human world. It was also the power of the Path of Heaven closest to the ghost realm.

The power of the two realms seeped through each other and enabled the Ji family to refine Evil Eye successfully.

Four people appeared in front of him.

“The Ox-Head and Horse-Face, the four top ghost generals that wander day and night.” The young man revealed a strange smile.

Qin Yu walked toward them step by step and a surge of power of the soul segregated from his body.

It stopped at the border of the ghost realm and opened the desolate divine eye in an instant.

The golden desolate divine eye tore through the layers of obstacles in the ghost realm and looked at the sea of the sorcerer tribe.

Four rays of red light shot out from the hilt of the sword and stabbed into Ox-Head, Horse-Face, and the generals that wondered day and night.

A few of them looked at each other and sneered.

“A human race living being who has just entered the ghost realm actually looks down on me. The soul origin is split into two, and he even plans to fight one on four.” The Ox-Head blew a breath out from its nostrils.

A tornado seemed to be blowing on the ground. He held a steel trident in his hand.

Amid the turbulence, even the air seemed to tremble.

In an instant, he stomped on the ground, and his body blasted out like a cannonball.

The steel trident brought with it the power to exterminate the heavens as it directly slashed toward Qin Yu.

Before the arrival of the steel trident, the enormous power brought by the weapon suppressed his soul to the point he could not breathe.

“Disgusting Charm! ”

The scarecrow in Evil Eye’s hand turned into an enormous phantom floating in the air. Qin Yu’s two fingers lit up with lightning that suffocated the Ox-Head.

Triggered by the Heart of Thunder, the Ninth Heaven Divine Thunder gathered on his two fingers..
