Chapter 2542 The Combined Attack of Dark Spell

This figure moved, squirming in the dark, emanating cold and terrifying internal qi.

Without anyone noticing, they appeared nearby and gave them a deadly blow.

When Qin Yu saw the long halberd under the black shadow clearly, an intense cold feeling surged from the soles of his feet to his entire body.

A strange and sinister laughter sounded in everyone’s ears again, and following that, the entire Misty Forest shook.

A dense crowd of nearly 500 figures suddenly appeared before them.

One pair, two pairs, three pairs, four pairs, and a pair of wings spread out from their backs.

The nine-winged monster race army! It was an attack launched by the nine-winged monster race army!

The eight-winged monster race already had the power of Tribulation Fourth Level Condensed Throne. These 500 nine-winged would probably have unimaginable transformation. He did not expect to encounter such a terrifying army in the Misty Forest after the battle in the Holy Region.

Although there were only 500 of them, and the leader was not Demon King Xiang Yu, they were the top forces in the monster territory. The power linked together could pose a terrible threat to them.

A terrifying thought emerged in Qin Yu’s mind. Could it be that this was a trap set up long ago? He was merely waiting for them to come in!

“Retreat quickly!”

Qin Yu roared.

“Crack!”

Almost the instant they saw the halberd, nearly everyone’s divine soul suddenly froze, and the thoughts in their souls seemed to have been cut off in an instant.

The halberd struck, and the devil shadow above threw out countless fish hooks that hung on their bodies.

It was an untouchable black shadow.

An eerie bone-made shackle locked onto their souls as the fish hooks pierced through.

This soul shackle seemed infused with the dark energy and the power of death. Its appearance was composed of cold iron chains and skulls, and the chains were inlaid with ancient runes and dark shadow patterns.

The terrifying suppression power of the Path of Heaven completely suppressed their souls under this shackle, making them unable to break through at all.

That was not all. Qin Yu could feel countless bone spikes besides the bone shackles piercing deep into their souls.

It absorbed his life force frantically to strengthen its dark power. This absorption seemed to be an extreme torture, bringing intense pain to his soul.

Although the pain was bearable for him, the others were trembling.

Even Xuan Xin and Xuan Tian, whose strength was the strongest, were ashen.

It could penetrate the victim’s body and soul, devouring their life force, weakening them, and eventually leading to death.

A terrifying sword intent burst out from Xuan Xin’s body, but in an instant, he grunted.

The bone shackle let out an exaggerated tone and instantly covered the surface of his body.

He seemed to have suffered a backlash and spat a mouthful of blood.

Nether Bone Shackle! This nine-winged monster race army could actually release the power of the Path of Heaven!

Xuan Xin roared in rage. He erupted with a terrifying power again and intertwined with the sealing power.

This was not the power of an individual’s Path of Heaven, but 500 living beings.

This power had already surpassed his three-power combined attack.

At that moment, the necklace on Shen Rou’s chest suddenly broke.

The World Extinguishing Abyss Breaking Pearl!

Xuan Xin slightly heaved a sigh of relief.

A black bead on her necklace’s pendant suspended quietly in the air.

Deep vortex patterns covered the surface of the bead. It suddenly pierced through the air as if sensing something.

It began to tremble and let out a low hum.

Suddenly, the bead spun rapidly and released a dazzling dark light.

As the power accumulated, the Abyss Breaking Pearl began to tremble and let out a sharp noise. The dark energy formed a vortex-like air current around the bead, absorbing everything in the surroundings like a black hole. The air was full of heavy and destructive internal qi.

The Abyss Breaking Pearl erupted a massive dark shock wave as the energy reached its limit. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The long halberd suddenly repelled, and the 500 nine-winged monster race army fell backward.

They seemed to have suffered heavy injuries and stepped back, about to leave this place.

Under this attack, the shackles that locked their souls no longer existed.

“What a terrifying bead!”

Qin Yu said in shock. A bead’s power could actually repel the attack of this monster race elite.

The World Extinguishing Abyss Breaking Pearl was a one-time use magical artifact left behind by the Three Purities Sect. It was gone just like that! Even among the three sects, there was only one! It was even more precious than the Heavenly Soul Jade!

Shen Rou was so distressed that she felt like crying.

Qin Yu gasped. He knew this bead was precious but did not expect it to be so precious.

However, this was not the time to be emotional. The nine-winged monster race was about to retreat after being injured.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, and the power of his six acupoints burst out.

His body floated up, and he fiercely stomped his feet backward.

Like lightning, he instantly chased and attacked the monster race army.

“You killed so many living beings of our human race, and you want to retreat like this?”

Qin Yu shouted coldly. He raised his Evil Eye and stabbed into the sky.

The second move of the Evil Eye, Soul Ferry, was unleashed.

“The souls of these monster race army are powerful. I’m afraid this attack won’t be effective.”

Xuan Tian frowned and said. He also wanted to attack, but more living beings seemed approaching in the dark. They had to conserve their strength to resist other possible attacks.

The third move, God-slaying Dusk!

Qin Yu slapped the air with his left hand and held the sword in his right hand. His entire body smashed into the army like a meteor.

At this moment, Evil Eye had already absorbed the power of the soul to the extreme. After it exploded, coupled with Teng Zixu’s Heavenly Profound Power, it could now draw upon the early stage of the fifth-level power of destruction.

This third move was the power that he had never gathered before. The descending power of dusk smashed down on this army like the destruction of a divine kingdom.

“What a terrifying power! This ultimate force has faintly approached that of Senior Brother’s!”

Xuan Tian said in horror. The others were dumbfounded.

They did not participate in the previous war with the Ji family, so they only had a rough understanding of Qin Yu’s strength.

The power that erupted at this moment was indeed beyond their expectations.

“D*mn it!”

Xuan Xin’s expression changed. He seemed to have sensed something, and a sword energy suddenly attacked.

The instant it landed, two crossed fists appeared in the void and were suddenly stuck under Qin Yu’s wrist.

After that, the figure suddenly dodged the green sword energy.
