Chapter 2414: Kill His Way to the Ji Family

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Boom!”

A vast divine thought floated down like a firefly and precisely stopped in front of Qin Yu.

That divine thought slowly wiggled, and after a brief expansion and contraction, it turned into an elderly man with dry, wrinkled skin.

“Ji family, Ji Wuyi, you should know why I’m here.”

The elderly man coughed several times and said weakly.

“Old fart, aren’t you here to kneel and repent for the tens of millions of living beings in Sky City?”

Chang Mang cursed.

The elderly man gently stretched out his hands, and a streak of greenish-black qi suddenly appeared on Chang Mang’s face. The intense pain caused his veins to bulge, and his mouth was open, but he could not make a single sound.

“Is this your sincerity in coming to negotiate?”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“This ghostly sword is the most important thing to my Ji family, and for the sword, our family will pay any price. I don’t know if you, young friend, can deal with this karma.”

The elderly man coughed lightly, and both his hands moved slightly.

Jue Wu, Chang Mang, and almost everyone else in the Sumeru ring had black energy on their faces.

“Young friend, you also know someone from the Ji family’s collateral bloodline, Ji Yuhong, the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak, and many others who seem to be your friends.”

Ji Wuyi said weakly.

Jue Wu felt a chill run down her spine. In such a short time, the Ji family had thoroughly investigated all of Qin Yu’s friends. Was this the power of an aristocratic family?

“Tell me your purpose directly,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Of course, you have to hand over the Evil Eye, and it’s not easy to take things away from my Ji family. We will forget about this matter if you go to the Ji family to apologize.”

Ji Wuyi waved his hand as if he was passing a judgment.

“Old dog, go and eat sh*t!”

The black energy in Chang Mang’s body suddenly seeped into the Sumeru ring and then into the ghostly sword.

His body suddenly could move, and he rushed out and punched the elderly man.

Instantly, the physical body turned into blood foam. The physical body was merely a manifestation of the soul and thus could not withstand a punch from Chang Mang’s holy body.

A ray of flowing light shot out at a terrifying speed.

“You will regret your choice.”

The elderly man said calmly and was about to leave.

“What Chang Mang said is right. Go and eat sh*t!”

Qin Yu’s forehead emitted a bright lightning bolt, and the Evil Eye in the Sumeru ring suddenly grabbed onto his hand.

The Way of Yin and Yang.

Two streams of qi, black and white, rushed out and instantly devoured Ji Wuyi’s soul.

“How dare you, brat! The Ji family will definitely make you wish you were dead, and it’s useless no matter where you hide! There’s still a chance for reconciliation if you let me go now.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ji Wuyi was no longer as calm as earlier and let out a shrill cry.

“D*mn reconciliation!”

Qin Yu moved his hand, and Ji Wuyi’s divine soul completely sank into the ghostly sword. The Evil Eye was then sent back into the Sumeru ring to be suppressed.

“Pavilion Master!”

The woman who had protected him with her life! He could not let anything happen to the Pavilion Master.

In the Ji family far away, a bone tile suddenly shattered.

The eyes of the dozens of people in the surroundings turned cold.

“Cast a curse!”

The obscure language of the sorcerer tribe was uttered from the mouths of dozens of people. Behind them, Ji Yuyi, dressed in a red robe, let out a shrill scream as if suffering intense pain!

Qin Yu suddenly leaped up, and his body turned into a thunder dragon that instantly flew away.

“Pavilion Master, you must not let anything happen to you!”

Qin Yu roared furiously. His speed was tremendously fast.

The sonic boom force behind him could not even catch up to his body. The force that swept past his body left a deep trench on the ground.

When his speed reached its peak, there were even sparks caused by the friction between space and his body.

In less than two hours, he had already rushed to the Alchemist Association.

“Who is it? This is the Alchemist Association. Who allowed you to fly in the air?”

A guard pointed at Qin Yu and shouted angrily, but Qin Yu suddenly lifted him.

He flattened a mountain peak ten thousand meters away with a palm strike and then stared at the guard.

“Where is Ji Yuhong?”

“Spare me! Senior! Ji Yuhong left with the Ji family yesterday. The three Tribulation Transcending Stage Supreme Elders of the Ji family came and directly broke Lord Ji Yuhong’s legs. The entire Alchemist Association could not protect her.”

The smell of urine suddenly filled the entire space. The cultivator was so scared that he wet his pants.

“Qin Yu, don’t be rash. Should we go back to Thunder Courtyard and ask for Lei Xin’s and Flower Granny Hua’s opinions?”

Jue Wu said with a frown. She knew the relationship between Qin Yu and Ji Yuhong.

Ji Yuhong had once protected Qin Yu as if she was protecting her own child. Even if she was in a desperate situation, she would not retreat.

Now that she was captured by the Ji family, Qin Yu would definitely kill his way to the Ji family without considering anything.

A divine sense jade talisman suddenly shattered, and Lei Xin’s voice came from within.

“All the people of Demon-slaying Peak have been poisoned. It seems to be the

Ji family’s doing. Quickly come back to discuss.”

“The Ji family!”

Qin Yu’s eyes were bloodshot as he tossed the Sumeru ring to Chang Mang. Almost at the same time, his body disappeared from their sight.

“This idiot, he’s going all out!”

Chang Mang cursed. He threw the ring to Jue Wu and turned around to chase.

“What are you chasing for? With your speed, you can even burn incense for Qin Yu when you reach the Ji family.”

Jue Wu took out the warship and pulled Chang Mang up.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu almost raised his speed to the limit. In half a day, the Ji family had already appeared in front of him.

His speed did not slow down at all. His entire body crashed into the Ji family’s formation like a meteor.

“Boom!”

Amidst the massive tremors, endless thin threads surged out of the information. These thin threads wrapped around Qin Yu’s body layer by layer.

After that, waves of obscure energy crazily drilled into his skin.

“Ji family’s wretched thing, get the hell out here!”

Wu Ji’s flames surged out of his body, burning the layers of thin threads.

A colossal skull burning with cold flames suddenly appeared in the air, and then a middle-aged man with a grim expression appeared in front of the skull.

“Boom!”

Three figures suddenly landed, and the magnificent aura made Qin Yu involuntarily step back. These three people had the strength of a Tribulation Third Level Soul Statue Reaching the Bottom.

And then, six more terrifying internal qi descended. They were all in the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

Ji Ao, Ji Yuyi, and hundreds of the most elite cultivators of the Ji family.

“Wuyi’s life in exchange for your arrival is worth it.”

The elderly in the middle of the three said softly. This person was Ji Tianming, the number one Supreme Elder.

“Where is Ji Yuhong?”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“Yuhong died because of you, and the restrictions were activated, even the immortals can’t resolve it. The karma of the Ghostly Sword Evil Eye is too massive, and so many people died because of you. This is the terror of this ominous sword. Nobody except my Ji family can deal with it. Do you understand?”

The middle-aged man said softly. He was the Holy Lord of the Ji family, Ji Changhong.

“Kneel and repent in my Ji family. After a hundred years of service, I will let you go-”
