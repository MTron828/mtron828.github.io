2308 Frenzied Cultivation

It could devour the soul to replenish the power of the soul and could even repair the soul.

Previously, in the Holy Region, Qin Yu had used the Netherworld Mind Technique Sister Ning had given him to repair his damaged soul.

However, it would give rise to another consciousness, which could be fatal for ordinary people.

Previously, Chang Ye and Situ Haoyue seemed to have come into contact with the masked woman’s cultivation method. When they faced the masked woman, they were completely in control.

Qin Yu relied on suppressing the black Qin Yu’s consciousness and the power of the soul left behind by his father to solve this problem, and his divine sense had now reached the peak of the ninth grade, almost comparable to or even suppressing Situ Haoyue.

“Once I break through to fifth grade, my soul will merge with the Path of Heaven, and I can further expand the capacity of my soul. Are there any ways to continue absorbing the power of the soul now?”

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground, and his thoughts were as fast and sharp as lightning.

He suddenly had an idea and wanted to test it.

He instantly appeared behind a wandering soul, and the Star Technique straightaway broke through its defense.

After that, the Soul Torment Mind Technique circulated, and a terrifying power of divine sense surged into its divine sense.

His sea of consciousness began to ache, unable to immerse itself in the power of the soul.

His Soul Torment Mind Technique circulated faster, and the terrifying suction force on his body doubled.

The power of divine sense was forcefully “dragged” into his sea of consciousness bit by bit.

An intense pain came from his soul, and he felt like his divine sense had become a battlefield, and countless powers of divine sense clashed.

“Ah!”

Qin Yu let out a roar, and the Soul Torment Mind Technique circulated even faster.

More power of divine sense was dragged into his sea of consciousness. His soul darkened, and he almost fainted from the intense pain.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and held on to his consciousness. All his previous efforts would be in vain if he fainted now.

The pain in his soul was a hundredfold more intense than in his physical body, and each trace of his soul power dragged into his body was no different from enduring a round of excruciating torture.

After forcefully absorbing this wisp of remnant soul, Qin Yu impatiently began to circulate his power of divine sense.

This time, his divine sense could see nearly 20 meters away.

Moreover, the two divine sense figurines in his sea of consciousness seemed to have shrunk a little as if they had been compressed to the extreme.

“It’s indeed effective!”

Qin Yu was overjoyed deep down, and his eyes turned to look at the other remnant soul.

However, when he thought of the heart-wrenching pain earlier, he could not help but shudder.

“D*mn it, I’ve already missed the Golden Great Dao of True Saint, and how do I fight Si Shiyue if I don’t give it my all now!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and used the Spiritualization Technique.

The giant hand of divine sense grabbed the wisp of remnant soul, and the Soul Torent Mind Technique activated again.

The intense pain hit his head again, and the most terrifying thing was that…

As the power of the soul continued to compress, the pain increased exponentially.

After absorbing the wandering soul, Qin Yu was drenched in cold sweat with bean-sized beads of sweat dripping down like rain.

His body was trembling non-stop, and his face was tremendously pale.

This method was no less severe than any torture.

“Do what you can. Keep it up.”

Xi Menn rarely spoke up.

After recovering for half a day, Qin Yu continued to move again.

As long as the speed of the Soul Torment Mind Technique did not reach its limit, he could still compress this soul power.

However, the pain that his divine sense had to face kept increasing relentlessly.

“Don’t refine the power of the soul and let it in again! Are you crazy? You’ll die if your soul explodes.”

That black Qin Yu’s expression contorted, and it instantly trembled seeing Qin Yu was about to make a move again.

“Shut up.”

The other golden Qin Yu shot out a golden light and suppressed the black Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and grabbed another wandering soul.

“Whoosh!” The Soul Torment Mind Technique accelerated its speed again.

The power of the soul once again crushed together, and every inch of the divine sense felt the intense pain as if being cut by a knife.

This time, Qin Yu could not withstand it and fainted directly.

This kind of pain had exceeded the limits of the soul, and the body had only reacted naturally. His divine sense might collapse if this continued.

A sword light suddenly slashed down and shattered the wandering soul.

Xi Menn took over Qin Yu and gently placed him on the ground.

Then he sat cross-legged at the side and protected Qin Yu.

“You’re actually pushing harder than me.”

He said softly.

After half a day, Qin Yu finally woke up.

And he could not wait to use his divine sense, only to discover his soul power to be stronger, as expected.

His current soul power was almost stronger by half than before.

Thinking of that pain, Qin Yu could not help but shiver.

However, he still braced himself and planned to continue moving forward.

“Are you crazy? If you forcefully absorb more power of divine sense, your soul will collapse.”

Xi Menn frowned.

After spending so many days with Qin Yu, he could roughly see through Qin Yu’s motive.

“It’s fine. I only absorb a little at a time. Moreover, after experiencing the pain earlier, the divine sense can endure even greater pain the second time. As long as I control well, it shouldn’t be life-threatening.”

Qin Yu shook his head. He did not want to stop just like that.

Under the circumstance he could not break through the rules, the path to becoming stronger had thus become narrower.

It was rare to come across such an opportunity. How could he catch up with the genius of the Si family if he did not push himself to the limit, and what was there to talk about protecting Yan Ruoxue?

Seeing he failed to persuade Qin Yu, Xi Menn could only shake his head. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

For the subsequent nearly one month, Qin Yu and Xi Menn spent their time in the ninth level, challenging their own limits.

Qin Yu did not know how many times he had fainted. After he recovered, he continued to absorb divine sense.

“F*ck, this Soul Torment Mind Technique is really pervert!”

Qin Yu said in shock. His power of divine sense was about twice as strong as from the beginning.

A difference of one fold could only be described as a massive chasm.

If he unleashed the Divine Sense Attack in full power, he felt Situ Haoyue could not withstand the power of one strike of his divine sense.

Meanwhile, Xi Menn was also constantly tempering his sword intent. Each time, he was riddled with wounds before he stopped.

As if stimulated by Qin Yu’s frenzied cultivation, he even ventured a few meters deeper into the ground.

He even triggered the corpse of a demonic beast that had gained sentience. If Qin Yu had not blocked the terrifying attack in time, Xie Menn would have died on the spot.

At this moment, his divine sense could even reach 50 to 60 meters away.

He could only see a few meters away when he first arrived here.

As they continued to walk on the edge, Qin Yu’s divine sense detected a faint yellow light.

Qin Yu took a few more steps forward, his face revealing an ecstatic expression.

“That’s Sumeru qi!”

He carefully sensed the surging internal qi and confirmed that it was his Sumeru qi.

However, the Sumeru Qi was at a depth of over 50 meters inside.
