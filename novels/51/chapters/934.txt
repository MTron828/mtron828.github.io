Chapter 935: Chapter 935, an abyss 

The moment his divine sense entered the spatial artifact, Qin Yu felt as if his soul had left his shell.

He sat on the ground without moving. If someone attacked Qin Yu Now, it would be extremely dangerous.

Inside the spatial artifact.

Qin Yu’s divine sense transformed into a human form.

He scanned his surroundings. Other than some of the storage items in the spatial artifact, it appeared extremely empty.

“Is this the interior of the spatial artifact?”Qin Yu frowned.

His surroundings looked extremely dark, and his vision wasn’t clear. Qin Yu could only slowly walk forward.

This was his first time stepping into a spatial artifact. Looking at the special structure of this spatial artifact, he couldn’t help but feel somewhat surprised.

“This spatial artifact’s space is so big.”Qin Yu thought to himself as he walked.

After walking for dozens of minutes, Qin Yu still hadn’t reached the border.

This meant that the capacity of this spatial artifact was absolutely beyond imagination.

For half a night.

Qin Yu still didn’t notice the abnormality of this spatial artifact.

Helpless, Qin Yu could only leave this spatial artifact temporarily.

That strand of spiritual sense returned to his body, and Qin Yu’s face instantly became extremely pale.

With his current realm, it was an extremely arduous task for a large amount of divine sense to leave his body.

“How is it?”Seeing Qin Yu open his eyes, the mustached man hurriedly asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, this spatial artifact is much bigger than I imagined. I’m afraid I need to rest for a while.”

The mustached man muttered, “Kid, your luck is really good. If there really is some divine sense hidden in this spatial artifact, then you’ll Be Rich.”

“Rich?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Even if there is some divine sense hidden, what benefit does it have for me?”

The Mustache Man waved his hand and said, “You can explore this yourself. Don’t ask me everything.”

As he said this, Qin Yu’s vision suddenly turned pitch black.

The intense pain in his dantian came again.

Qin Yu’s entire body instantly became limp on the ground.

His expression only eased up slightly when he spat out a mouthful of blood from his mouth.

There was a pool of black blood on the ground, which looked shocking.

The amount of blood he spat out this time seemed to be much more than before.

“The crack in his Dantian seems to have become bigger,”Qin Yu said with a frown.

At this rate, it would not be long before the golden core would shatter.

At that time, he would definitely die.

“Pavilion master said that there might be heavenly vanilla in the second secret realm,”Qin Yu muttered softly.

However, if one wanted to step into the second secret realm, one had to at least step into the martial saint realm.

However, if the damage to the Dantian was not repaired, how could one step into the martial saint realm?

This immediately made Qin Yu extremely worried.

“Forget it, let’s take it one step at a time.”Qin Yu sighed.

He lay in this piece of desert, closed his eyes slightly, and recovered his spiritual sense.

In the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Gu Xinghe’s expression was extremely ugly.

This time, not only did he lose his spirit stones, but he also lost face.

That Bloody Rainbow did not put him in his eyes at all, how could he endure this.

“Damn it!”

The more Gu Xinghe thought about it, the angrier he got.

Ever since he took over the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, he had been in endless trouble.

Not only did he lose Yan Ruoxue, he couldn’t even catch Qin Yu.

Just then, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

“Young master Gu, there’s someone outside who calls himself Luo Yang to see you.”

“Luo Yang?”Gu Xinghe frowned slightly.

“Why is he looking for me?”

“He said he has something important to tell you.”

Gu Xinghe thought for a moment, waved his hand and said, “Let him in.”

“Yes.”

A few minutes later, Luo Yang walked in quickly.

He walked directly to the opposite side of Gu Xinghe, cupped his hands and said with a smile, “Young Master Gu, long time no see.”

“What’s the matter?”Gu Xinghe seemed a little impatient.

Luo Yang smiled faintly and said, “If there’s nothing important, how would I dare to disturb you?”

“If you have something to say, say it quickly!”Gu Xinghe berated.

Luo Yang didn’t dare to be negligent. He was silent for a moment before he said, “Young Master Gu, I came here to tell you the location of Qin Yu.”

Gu Xinghe was stunned for a moment before he suddenly stood up and glared at Luo Yang. “Qin Yu? is what you said true?”

“It’s absolutely true!”Luo Yang said lightly.

“Not long ago, he came to look for my father and took a spiritual artifact from his hands.”

“That spiritual artifact is called thousand faces, and it’s a hat. After wearing this hat, it can conceal the internal Qi!”

Gu Xinghe’s pupils suddenly constricted!

Hat?

Wasn’t that the kid who fought with Qiao Zun not long ago near the Spirit Stone Mine? !

No wonder he had such strength and courage!

“It’s actually him...”Gu Xinghe’s face instantly turned cold.

He stood up and looked at Luo Yang, saying coldly, “Is what you said true?”

“It’s absolutely true!”Luo Yang patted his chest.

“Good!”Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but smile coldly.

Right now, he couldn’t find a way to contribute to the JINGDU martial arts association. As long as he caught this Qin Yu, he would be able to contribute to the higher-ups!

“Young master Gu, I told you such important news. Can it be considered a contribution?”Luo Yang said with a smile.

Gu Xinghe glanced at him and sneered, “Of course! After I’ve captured Qin Yu, I can give you anything you want!”

Luo Yang was delighted and immediately stood up, “Young Master Gu, leave this matter to me! I have a way to trick Qin Yu into showing himself!”

“Are you serious?”Gu Xinghe became even more excited.

Luo Yang patted his chest and said, “Of course! Give me a few days, I promise to find Qin Yu!”

“Good, good!”Gu Xinghe burst into laughter.

“If you can find Qin Yu for me, I can agree to anything you want!”

Luo Yang touched his nose, stood up and said, “Young Master GU, just wait for my good news.”

After saying that, Luo Yang turned around and walked out.

...

In the next few days.

Qin Yu did not leave this desert.

He forced out his divine sense and probed into the space artifact to look for any abnormalities.

Each time, Qin Yu could only hold on for half a day.

He entered and left like this eight times. Finally, Qin Yu found an abnormality in the space artifact!

He saw that in the depths of the space artifact, there was actually an abyss!

Qin Yu quickly walked to the edge of the Abyss and looked down.
