1749 The Divine Inscription Formation Collapses

It was unknown where the voice came from, but it seemed to be some kind of spell.

Wen Wanchong’s face darkened and he shouted, “Who’s sneaking around? come out!”

“Wen Wanchong, if you want to die, go ahead. Don’t drag us down with you!” The cold voice sounded again.

“Yuan Xiu is such a terrifying opponent. Even you and Qu Zhu combined weren’t his match, let alone us!”

“If we join forces,” Wen Wanchong said coldly, “We might have a chance of survival!”

“Join forces? Wen Wanchong, should I say that you’re stupid or na?ve? At this level, could they win by relying on numbers? If the gap between us and Yuan Xiu isn’t too big, numbers might be useful. However, there’s a huge difference between the heavens and the earth. We’ll just be courting death if we go.” The voice said coldly.

Wen Wanchong was furious. He gritted his teeth and cursed, “Who the f*ck is talking nonsense? If you have the guts, come out and I’ll tear your mouth apart!”

“Forget it,” he said.

At this time, Jue Wu suddenly jumped up and patted Wen Wanchong’s shoulder.

Surprisingly, she was not as impulsive as before and was very calm.

“I think what he said seems to make sense.” Jue Wu mumbled, holding her chin.

“Don’t say that, ” Wen Wanchong said awkwardly. “One more person is always one more power.”

“Sigh, that Yuan Xiu is indeed terrifying. Don’t make things difficult for them.” Jue Wu waved her hand.

“It isn’t easy for everyone to reach the Reversion Void Stage. Who’s willing to die? ”

When the people below heard this, they quickly nodded and said, “Yes, that’s right. Thank you for your concern, Lord Jue Wu.”

“Then we won’t disturb you any longer, goodbye.”

The group did not waste any time and quickly left Dayue Mountain.

After they left, Wen Wanchong sighed and said, “Why are you doing this? This isn’t like you at all.”

Jue Wu wrinkled her little nose and said, “Cultivating is not easy, they should have their own choices.”

“What should we do next?” Wen Wanchong asked.

“It doesn’t matter, I’ll take action,” Jue Wu said with a smile.

“You...” Wen Wanchong didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

If it was Jue Wu, who was in the Reversion Void Stage, Wen Wanchong might have believed this.

However, no one at the half-step Reversion Void Stage could possibly be a match for Yuan Xiu.

...

In the North Plain.

Sima Bei knelt in front of Yuan Xiu and said in a low voice, “Master, I’ve checked. Qin Yu has not come out since he entered the Divine Capital City.”

“Where are the others?” Yuan Xiu asked.

The two losses made Yuan Xiu start to worry.

He had to eliminate all possible enemies in the dark.

“In the entire Nanzhou, ” Sima Bei said coldly, “Other than Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu, no one else is willing to help. There are already Reversion Void Stage cultivators who have left Nanzhou for the East Continent.

“In addition to them, there is also Jue Wu, who also caused us heavy losses.” Sima Bei continued.

Yuan Xiu narrowed his eyes and said, “Jue Wu... I seem to remember this person, she’s a very small woman?”

“That’s right. She’s not weak. However, she has been unconscious for a long time and is only a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator. She’s not a threat to us.”

Yuan Xiu glanced at Sima Bei and continued, “Is there no possibility of other people taking action?”

“Master, you shouldn’t waste any more time. It’s already been close to ten days. If you delay any longer, Xiao Sheng will come out of his seclusion.” Sima Bei said with a frown.

Yuan Xiu cast a cold glance at Sima Bei. Clearly, the tone of Sima Bei’s words had displeased him.

However, it had to be said that Sima Bei’s words made sense.

At this moment, Yuan Xiu suddenly stood up, causing Sima Bei, who was kneeling on the ground, to stagger in fear.

“Thunder Courtyard... They won’t be involved in this, right?” Yuan Xiu suddenly asked.

“Thunder Courtyard has never been involved in these things,” Sima Bei quickly said.

“Then let’s not waste any more time. We’ll set off immediately for the Divine Capital City!” Yuan Xiu squinted his eyes and said.

“Yes!”

The group of people once again rushed towards Divine Capital City!

It was late at night, and everything was silent.

Divine Capital City, which was deserted, was eerily quiet.

At that moment, three people suddenly appeared near Divine Capital City. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Yuan Xiu scanned the surroundings coldly. He released his divine sense, which covered a radius of several hundred stars!

“There’s not a single person?” Yuan Xiu narrowed his eyes and sneered.

He stretched out his palm and the gigantic ax appeared in his hand again!

The bright light instantly lit up the night! The pitch-black night seemed to have turned into day!

An extremely terrifying aura caused the nearby sand and stones to start floating.

The ground rumbled as if a great earthquake was happening!

Peng Liu, who was in Divine Capital City, was jolted awake.

He raised his head to look at the gigantic ax that was flashing in the sky, and his expression instantly became extremely ugly.

“I’m finished...” Peng Liu swallowed his saliva, feeling extremely terrified.

Yuan Xiu looked down at the entire city and said coldly, “Last time, I almost broke through the Divine Capital City. This time, I’ll see who can stop me!”

After saying that, he raised his palm, and a terrifying aura instantly condensed. Thousands of light rays condensed on his gigantic ax!

As Yuan Xiu’s palm fell, the sharp blade of the ax came crashing down.

“Boom!”

The Divine Inscription Formation instantly took form, and thin divine inscriptions covered the entire city!

The divine inscriptions trembled under the might of this gigantic ax, but they still stubbornly withstood it in the end.

Yuan Xiu didn’t waste any time. He raised his gigantic ax again and swung it down for the second time!

This time, the divine inscriptions trembled even more violently!

Yuan Xiu’s face turned even colder. He grabbed the gigantic ax in his hand and swung it down for the third time!

“Boom!”

Under the third strike, the divine inscriptions instantly became a bit dimmer! Just like the last time, it seemed to be on the verge of collapse!

“What dogshit Divine Inscription Formation? I’ll break you today!” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

He grabbed the gigantic ax and swung it for the third time!

The Divine Inscription Formation finally crumbled under the might of this ax!

The dense golden threads were directly broken!

They were scattered in the sky and became extremely dim!

A moment later, all of the divine inscriptions slowly disappeared and merged into the air.

Divine Capital City had been breached!

“Finally, finally!” Sima Bei was extremely excited!

He was the first one to rush into Divine Capital City. He quickly released his divine sense and headed straight in Xiao Sheng’s direction!

“Xiao Sheng, let’s see who else can save you this time.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

With a jolt of his feet, he immediately shot in the direction of Xiao Sheng.

“Qin Yu, it’s time for you to pay the price. I’ve been waiting for this day... It’s been a long time!” Yong Ji sneered.

Instead of following Yuan Xiu, he quickly located Qin Yu’s position and sped off.
