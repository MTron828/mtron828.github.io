Chapter 2818: Summoning Gods

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Brother, are you heading to the Eight Desolates Beast Domain?”

He had been searching the trading market for a few days.

No teams were heading to the Divine Silkworm Ridge at all. However, he found a team heading to the Eight Desolates Beast Domain, about a thousand miles from the Divine Silkworm Ridge.

“That’s right. However, our team only accepts people with Dao Consciousness and above, specifically those who have awakened their peak power. I’m afraid you don’t meet the requirements.”

A buzzcut young man directly declined.

The awakening of peak power had a special internal qi that combined a cultivation technique with its sequence.

This internal qi was different from Saint Power, and it could not be concealed, much like the smell of a human body.

Therefore, with just a slight glance, the young man could tell that Qin Yu and Fatty Situ had not awakened their peak power.

There were seventy-eight people in this huge team.

Upon closer inspection, it was indeed as the buzzcut young man had said.

These seventy-eight people were those who had awakened their peak power! This was extremely terrifying!

He had never seen such a grand lineup, even in the Heavenly Sin.

“Little brother, don’t be too surprised. This is a long journey. Although there are a lot of people now, many will drop out along the way. By the time we reach the Eight Desolates Beast Domain, there might not even be a third of the people left.”

The buzzcut young man was still relatively friendly. He smiled and introduced them.

“Brother, I’m close to comprehending peak power. Can you give us a chance?”

Fatty Situ squeezed his big face over.

“Brothers, it’s not that I don’t want to agree, but this is the most fundamental requirement. We even need to pass through many areas controlled by alien races. Therefore, we only set off once in a long time. Those who haven’t awakened their peak power would be risking their lives in vain. Moreover, if their strength isn’t compatible, it will affect the safety of the team. This is not allowed.”

The buzzcut young man refused.

“Forget it, let’s find another way.”

Qin Yu shook his head. This kind of hard target was the most difficult to meet. They really couldn’t meet the requirements now.

“No way, boss. You don’t have such long-distance travel experience. Without a large caravan like this, it will take us a lot of time to travel. Moreover, we’ll consume a lot of resources!”

Fatty Situ came over and whispered.

“Moreover, what that guy said just now is right. There are many dangerous places we have to pass through. If it’s just the two of us, it will probably take a lot of time. By the time we reach that area, it might take even longer.”

The Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom was vast, with some natural gourd-shaped terrains.

To pass through, one could only go through those places. Moreover, some places had fierce and numerous living beings.

However, these places were very barren. Even if they killed these living beings, they couldn’t obtain anything useful.

These places were ones that no one wanted to enter.

Even in a dark place like the Divine Silkworm Ridge, one might be lucky enough to encounter a supreme-grade magical artifact or have some fortuitous encounters.

However, in these barren lands, there were no Dharma Treasures at all.

Not only would it take a lot of time, but it would also not gain any benefits in the end.

“I’ll go and talk to him again!” Fatty Situ rose and followed.

“Get lost!” As soon as he caught up, he heard a cold voice.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically, and he was about to attack directly.

“Boss Qin Yu, I can handle it!”

Almost at the same time, a golden light erupted from Fatty Situ’s body.

The Stars-shifting talisman lit up automatically. It was a level-ten defensive talisman.

At this moment, a black palm print appeared on the talisman. Fatty Situ would have been seriously injured if not for the Stars-shifting talisman activating.

“What do you mean by this?”

Qin Yu stared coldly at the person who attacked.

“Nothing much, I just want to kill annoying people.”

It was a bald man with a sinister expression. There were twelve round scars on his head, left by burning incense, but his body was filled with killing intent.

He did not look like a monk at all. He walked towards Qin Yu and the others gently.

“To be able to take one of my attacks, even if you use a Dharma Treasure, is rare and precious. Get lost before I change my mind.”

The monk revealed a smile.

Those black teeth emitted a chilling coldness.

The twelve scars were left behind by Buddhist Sect disciples who burned their bodies with incense to purify their senses. Each scar required a long period of trials, so it was extremely rare to see a monk with twelve scars.

It seemed like even Chen Zhisha didn’t have so many scars. Qin Yu was secretly on guard.

“F*ck you! Do you know who I am? My Stars-shifting talisman! I don’t have many left.”

Fatty Situ was furious. He did not expect this guy to suddenly make a move.

“Hehehe!”

The golden light on Fatty Situ’s body completely shattered, turning into golden specks. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

With another attack, the talisman on Fatty Situ’s body was completely exhausted.

What a fast speed!

Qin Yu’s pupils narrowed. The speed of the attack just now had increased again.

This monk had awakened peak power, but it was unclear at what level.

“F*ck you, no one can protect you today. D*mn bald monk!”

Fatty Situ was furious again. The monk attacking twice for no reason had already enraged him to the extreme.

“Hahaha, Monk Yi Xing has gone berserk again. These two guys are unlucky.”

Joking voices came from the surroundings.

“Who asked these two little fellows to not know what’s good for them? Their strength is weak and they haven’t realized it. It won’t make sense if they don’t die.”

“Shut up!”

Fatty Situ said angrily. As the young lord of the Situ family, when had he ever encountered such a grievance?

“Summon the God! Lei Zhenzi!”

Fatty Situ was furious.

He crushed a talisman in his hand, and a powerful will of lightning instantly filled the entire space.

In the next moment, his pupils seemed to have changed.

Two identical lightning marks appeared in his eyes, followed by a violent peak power.

The violent peak power spilled out like lava and instantly spread over thousands of meters.

“It can even change the internal qi of the divine soul, and it can awaken the peak power of the summoned god in this state. This is not a simple summoning talisman! Interesting!”

Yi Xing allowed the power to strike his body.

His kasaya was swept up by the violent lightning, revealing his bronze-colored muscles.

One had to know that ordinary summoning could only temporarily borrow a portion of the power of the god they were summoning.

It was impossible to unleash the power of its core, let alone the peak power of a god.

However, the talisman in Fatty Situ’s hand was able to temporarily combine the summoned god with his soul and awaken peak power. This was already somewhat heaven-defying!

Qin Yu was not surprised. Fatty Situ had even more heaven-defying Dharma Treasures.
