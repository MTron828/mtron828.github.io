1842 Nanzhou, I’m Back!

Qin Yu didn’t talk nonsense and immediately nodded. “Yes, I need everyone’s help.”

Everyone fell into silence.

When Jue Wu was captured, everyone was indeed very angry. But now that so much time had passed, their anger had long been diluted.

Therefore, when Qin Yu asked for everyone’s help, everyone could not help but fall into silence.

“I wonder how Brother Qin wants us to help,” someone finally spoke up, and it was Xiaobai.

Qin Yu looked at Xiaobai gratefully and said in a deep voice, “The Tong family captured Jue Wu and did such a thing to her. I will definitely make them pay the price.

“The most important thing now is to save Jue Wu. But they most likely have Saint Weapon. So… I would like to borrow everyone’s points to exchange for a Saint Weapon.”

Everyone fell into silence again.

In fact, this was not a difficult task. They were willing to take out their points for Saint Weapons to deal with the two people from the Tong family back then.

However, nearly a year had passed since then. In this one year, many things had faded and been forgotten in their minds.

If it didn’t involve a personal grudge, who would remember it for so long?

“Don’t worry, everyone. I’ll definitely pay you back the points,” Qin Yu continued.

“I’ll pay you back together with Qin Yu!” Chang Mang quickly said.

After a long silence, someone finally spoke.

“Qin Yu, it’s not that we don’t want to help you. It’s just that our points may not be enough,” someone said.

“That’s right, Qin Yu. Jue Wu is also part of us. I’m willing to give my points, but we don’t have enough to exchange for a Saint Weapon,” Xiaobai said.

Without saying much, he immediately walked forward and gave his points to Qin Yu.

Xiaobai was a casual person, so he didn’t have many points. He only had about 50 points.

After taking the points, Qin Yu bowed and said, “Many thanks.”

“Qin Yu isn’t the only one involved in this matter. The Tong family also killed many of our people.” At this moment, Cao Huang also stood out.

He gave his points to Qin Yu without hesitation. He had about 60 points in total.

“Thank you,” Qin Yu bowed again and said.

Then, a few more people came forward and gave Qin Yu their points.

Soon, Qin Yu had nearly 300 points in his hands.

However, these points were not enough at all. If he wanted to exchange for a Saint Weapon, he would need at least 800 to 1000 points.

However, if they were not willing to give their points to him, Qin Yu could not force them.

He could only put away the points in his hands, bowed, and said, “Thank you, everyone. I’ll definitely return the points you’ve offered today in double in the future.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Qin Yu, what’re you going to do if you don’t have enough points and can’t exchange for a Saint Weapon?” At this moment, a voice came from the distance.

Looking up, he saw that it was Jiu Xiao.

And beside him was the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak.

The two of them attracted everyone’s attention as they walked over.

Qin Yu also looked in the direction of Jiu Xiao.

“Even if I can’t get the Saint Weapon, I’ll still go and save Jue Wu. Even if I have to risk my life, I’ll get her out,” Qin Yu said coldly.

As he spoke, Jiu Xiao had already walked to the middle of the crowd.

He looked in Qin Yu’s direction and asked coldly, “Is it true?”

“It’s absolutely true,” Qin Yu said with a calm expression.

Jiu Xiao was silent for a moment.

After that, he suddenly took out his token and threw it at Qin Yu.

“Demon-slaying Peak has a rule stating that we can’t go against any sect or aristocratic family for personal grudges, so I can’t go with you. I’ll give you this token,” Jiu Xiao said calmly.

As he spoke, he walked out. His voice faded and echoed in the cave abode.

Holding the token in his hand, Qin Yu was silent. After a while, he shouted in the direction of Jiu Xiao, “Many thanks. I will remember this favor.”

Everyone was surprised. Previously, it was because of Jiu Xiao’s hesitation that Jue Wu left Demon-slaying Peak in the middle of the night.

But now, he had given his points to Qin Yu, which was really unexpected.

“Perhaps… Jiu Xiao is feeling guilty,” someone murmured.

In fact, Jiu Xiao could not be blamed for this. After all, they earned the points by risking their lives.

More importantly, using points to exchange for Saint Weapon was something very unavailing.

No one would be willing to use a high amount of points to rent a Saint Weapon.

Qin Yu grabbed the token in his hand, and a killing intent flashed across his eyes.

Jiu Xiao had nearly a thousand points in his hands. With his help, saving Jue Wu wouldn’t be a difficult task.

“Qin Yu, bring Jue Wu back,” the peak master said with a smile.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and nodded. “Definitely. Please help me tell Jiu Xiao that I don’t only owe him points but also a favor.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang and said, “Let’s go. Follow me to the first main peak.”

“Alright. I’ll go with you now!” Chang Mang hurriedly nodded and said.

“Wait.” At this time, the peak master suddenly stopped the two of them.

He looked at Qin Yu and said in a deep voice, “You both can’t go together. It’s against the rules of Demon-slaying Peak.”

“What do you mean?” Chang Mang was stunned.

“Qin Yu can go alone,” the peak master explained. “But if two of you go together, you’ll be representing Demon-slaying Peak and Thunder Courtyard.

“This doesn’t conform to the rules of Demon-slaying Peak. Demon-slaying Peak doesn’t allow avenging personal grudge.”

Hearing this, Chang Mang became anxious instantly.

“What bullsh*t rule is this?” he said with his eyes wide open. “What if I insist?”

“Then you will be expelled from Thunder Courtyard,” the peak master said in a deep voice.

“You speak as if I care. I’ll leave then!” Chang Mang took out the token in his hand and was about to throw it back to the peak master without saying anything else.

Qin Yu quickly reached out to stop Chang Mang. He shook his head and said, “I’ll go by myself.”

“No way,” Chang Mang immediately said angrily. “We’re brothers! I must go with you!”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I go alone is good enough. You can’t leave Thunder Courtyard.

“Moreover… I already owe Thunder Courtyard many favors.”

Thunder Courtyard had been taking good care of Qin Yu. Thus he didn’t want to make things difficult for Dean Lei.

“But…”

“No buts. Listen to me.”

Chang Mang still wanted to say something, but he was interrupted by Qin Yu.

Qin Yu then looked at Chang Mang and said, “Be good and wait here for me to come back.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left.

At this moment, Chang Mang shouted from behind, “Qin Yu, no matter what happens, your life is the most important. I don’t want to lose you.”

After hearing Chang Mang’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but stop.

Yan Ruoxue seemed to have said the same thing before.

Qin Yu turned around. He looked at Chang Mang and said with a smile, “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely be back.”
