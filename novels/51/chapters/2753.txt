Chapter 2754: God-slaying

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Moreover, the number of divine beasts in the sky increased further with every step Qin Yu took.

After advancing shortly, countless divine beasts were already around him. At this moment, his figure seemed especially lonely in the blood -red setting sun.

A group of people was gathered at the periphery.

These people had already passed the second test, but most were in a sorry state.

It seemed that the second level of Heavenly Sin had also made them suffer a lot.

“It seems that it is just as you said. The punishment in Heavenly Sin is different this time. I’m only at the second level, but it’s already forcing me to risk my life.”

Luo Yu’s expression was also a little ugly. There was a deep wound on his body.

He seemed to have paid a huge price to escape from the place just now.

On the other hand, there were no changes to Lord Alester and her Dao Protector. They seemed relaxed.

“Resentment materialized. It was just an illusory space in the past. But this time, it was a physical space directly derived from its resentment. As expected, a certain person whom Heavenly Sin is determined to kill has appeared!”

Cang Yunzi’s expression was extremely ugly.

They were the people with the second and third marks.

However, they also felt extremely strong pressure. This strength was completely different from what Cang Yunzi had previously investigated.

“Da*n it! It scared me to death. I’ve used a huge pile of talismans.”

At this moment, a round body was suddenly teleported out. Fatty Situ was holding a handful of talismans in each hand.

His other hand was holding an umbrella.

A tower was hanging above his head while a huge shield was circling him!

“Fatty Situ! You don’t even have a mark. Even if you get involved in the resentment, it won’t be too difficult. Is there a need to do this?”

Liu Si said in a young voice.

“It’s none of your business. What if this thing doesn’t play by the rules?”

Fatty said unhappily.

The people who had passed the second stage all looked at Fatty Situ with envy.

Perhaps they could only get one or two of the items in his hands. They could not imagine how Fatty Situ would use them. “Old man, where’s Little Brother Qin Yu? Why hasn’t he come out yet?” Fatty looked around but he did not see Qin Yu.

“I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for him to come out! This is the place where the resentment of the sinners gathers. Everything here is the manifestation of resentment. These resentments are of different sizes. They are chosen according to the internal qi of one’s bloodline. Therefore, those who do not have the mark will suffer the least pressure. It is the same for Lord Alester’s

Dao Protector, Liu Si, Situ Fatty, and his Dao Protectors.”

Cang Yunzi shook his head.

“Those with the second and third level of the mark will be under more pressure. You should be able to feel the internal qi of those divine beasts. That is the war they have experienced. This soaring resentment has caused them to reappear. ”

“So what?”

Fatty Situ asked in confusion.

“Even if we killed the final person in different scenarios, we didn’t hurt the resentment itself at all. Even after we come out, the resentment will intertwine and eventually form a new resentment. In other words, the game is not over yet.”

Cang Yunzi’s expression was hideous.

At this moment, they were in a hazy and dreamy space. The surrounding environment was like the stomach of a huge creature.

The ground and walls were constantly distorted, looking very strange.

However, everyone’s divine sense perception was forcefully suppressed by 90%. Therefore, no one could completely explore this place.

“In other words, it was just Heavenly Sin’s game against us. We didn’t hurt him at all?”

Liu Si frowned slightly.

This Heavenly Sin was indeed extraordinary.

Even though she had the life-saving item left behind by the three Holy Consciousness, she still began to feel a little uneasy.

“The nature of this power is very special. It belongs to an even more powerful willpower and it is becoming stronger. Those who died have become nutrients for this place.”

Xiao Hai softly said. However, his face revealed a trace of fanaticism.

“It’s pure. The purest resentment. It’s the hatred towards sinners, without any distracting thoughts. ”

Xiao Hails incoherent words made Cang Yunzi shock. This could be said to be Heavenly Sin’s greatest secret.

The willpower here was completely based on its instinctive power, which was why it could absorb the power of all the dead.

Heavenly Sin’s power became stronger and stronger in that way. It was like the power of holy energy. It had no special attributes and could be used as long as the cultivators put it into their bodies.

Heavenly Sin’s power was pure resentment.

The power of the dead was also assimilated into the power of the Heavenly Sin and they continued to pursue new sinners.

It would also become stronger and stronger. One had to know that many top-notch cultivators had died since the opening of the Heavenly Sin. This huge power was simply unimaginable.

At this moment, the space in front of them rippled and a colorful vortex suddenly appeared.

Several of the largest vortexes seemed to erupt with a suction force suddenly. The surrounding energy was also absorbed into it. The vortex in the middle was tne most eye-catcnmg.

At this moment, it exploded with a violent suction force. The surrounding vortex was directly pulled into it.

Then, it turned into an even greater resentment.

“This resentment should be the space where the possessor of the fourth mark of Heavenly Sin is currently located. I’m afraid that even I won’t be able to withstand such a terrifying power.”

Cang Yunzi had a complicated expression. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The second level belonged to these grudges and they would choose their own ‘opportus’.

They could not control it at all. The higher the level of marks on their bodies was, the stronger the sinner’s bloodline was.

The chance of being absorbed by the powerful space of resentment would be even bigger.

In the space where resentment materialized.

Qin Yu was covered in blood at this moment. His body was already heavily injured.

In just a short time, the power of the night in his body had been exhausted.

Slash!

A bright light appeared on Qin Yu’s body again.

It was another talisman that Fatty Situ had given him. At this moment, another level 14 talisman exploded and burned in front of Qin Yu.

The talisman was instantly enlarged by ten thousand times. The details of the entire talisman were presented in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu could even see countless bent ink lines that looked like iron chains.

Moreover, peaks and ridges were between each stroke with different heights.

A saber energy was sealed in the middle of the tens of thousands of brush and ink. The flame slowly burned.

One of the brushes and ink broke. The saber energy seemed to have sensed it.

It made a bright sound.

In an instant, all the ink chains broke like a chain reaction..
