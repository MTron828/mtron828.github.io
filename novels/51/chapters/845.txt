Chapter 846: Chapter 846: beating the Martial Saint!

Qin Yu’s physical body was unrivalled. Even when facing a martial saint, he would not be at a disadvantage!

“Boom!”

The two fists collided at this moment. This was purely a physical confrontation without any internal Qi!

“Deng Deng Deng!”

Under this punch, that martial saint took a few steps back before he could stabilize his body!

His fist was in so much pain that it seemed like his bones were about to be shattered!

“How is this possible!”This could not help but cause people to be shocked!

Qin Yu’s physical body was actually stronger than a martial saint? !

One must know that he was only a martial Marquis Now! ! If he were to step into the martial saint realm, how terrifying would that be? !

“Impossible!”That martial saint was unwilling to accept this as he charged towards Qin Yu once again.

Qin Yu laughed coldly. He raised his palm and slapped out with a “PA”sound!

This slap was direct and that martial saint was sent flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood from his mouth!

“Hahahaha!”

When Qin Yu saw this, he could not help but burst into laughter.

“Is this what it feels like to beat a martial saint? Awesome, Awesome!”Qin Yu’s maniacal laughter was so loud that it made one’s ears hurt!

The other martial saint did not believe it and also rushed towards Qin Yu.

However, the result was not much better. He was sent flying by Qin Yu’s punch!

These people could not help but feel shocked!

Among them, the one who was most afraid was naturally wan gu Qiong.

If even two martial saints were suppressed by Qin Yu, then wouldn’t he, a martial marquis, be even more miserable?

“Not good, this kid’s physical body is extremely powerful. Just by relying on his physical body, we are not his match at all!”One of the Martial Saints said in shock.

“Quickly retreat! Run!”

The three of them made a prompt decision and ran!

“You want to run? Do you think I will let you escape?”Qin Yu laughed coldly.

His feet shook and he immediately chased after the three of them!

In front, the three of them fled frantically while Qin Yu chased closely behind them!

In a short while, they had escaped to the position of the palace.

For a moment, everyone raised their heads and looked at this strange scene.

“What’s going on?”

“Qin Yu... is chasing after two martial saints?”

“Damn, could it be that Qin Yu has also entered the Martial Saint Stage?”

Everyone was stunned by this scene!

Qin Yu, who had been threatened by two martial saints yesterday, why was it the other way around now? !

Hearing the discussions of the people below, these two martial saints could not help but turn livid and extremely furious.

But now they had no time to explain, because Qin Yu was right behind them!

“Stop, I’m going to confiscate your golden cores!”Qin Yu shouted from behind!

“No, as martial saints, if converted to the cultivation realm, you should be in the nascent Soul Realm, right? No, I have to confiscate your nascent souls and eat them!”

Qin Yu’s words were like a demon, causing people to be unable to help but tremble in fear!

The two martial saints fled frantically, but their speed was also suppressed.

Seeing Qin Yu getting closer and closer, San became even more panicked.

“What’s the situation?”At this moment, Le Xian could not help but walk out with a frown.

When he saw Le Xian, Wan Gu Qiong seemed to have grabbed onto a life-saving straw.

He shouted crazily, “Uncle Le, Save Us! Qin Yu is crazy! He wants to kill us!”

“Qin Yu wants to kill you? Are you kidding me?”Le Xian didn’t seem to understand the situation.

Wan Gu Qiong didn’t have the time to explain. he shouted anxiously, “Save Us, I can’t explain for a while. Uncle Le, Save Us!”

Le Xian frowned slightly. Although he didn’t understand the situation, he still took a step forward and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

“Qin Yu, what’s Going On?”Le Xian asked with a frown.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “None of your business. Get out of the way!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Le Xian was stunned and could not help but say with anger, “Pay attention to the way you talk to Me!”

“I’ll pay attention to your grandpa! Get out of Here!”Qin Yu cursed.

Le Xian was completely enraged by Qin Yu and two martial saints walked out from beside him.

“Kid, how dare you talk to me like that? Do you believe me...”

“Get lost, or I will not recognize you with this slap!”Qin Yu rudely interrupted Le Xian’s words.

Le Xian immediately flew into a rage: “You are courting death! Teach him a lesson!”

“Alright.”

The two martial saints of the Le family quickly walked forward and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“Kid, you...”

“Slap!”

Before the two of them could finish their words, Qin Yu had already sent them flying with a slap!

“Why are you talking so much nonsense!”Qin Yu could not help but say angrily.

When everyone saw this scene, they immediately swallowed their saliva!

This Qin Yu... sent the martial saints flying with a slap? What was going on?

Le Xian’s eyes also widened. He hurriedly rubbed his eyes as if he could not believe the scene before him.

Qin Yu could not be bothered with Le Xian anymore. He quickly walked forward and grabbed the two martial saints from the Wan family.

He picked up one of the martial saints with one hand and raised his hand to draw the bow from both sides.

For a moment, the sound of slapping could be heard continuously.

“You still want to kill me? Old Man, now you know how powerful I am, right?”

Qin Yu slapped their aged faces and cursed loudly.

Everyone was dumbstruck.

The so-called invincible martial saint was now being treated like this? !

After a round of violent beating, Qin Yu seemed to be tired.

He glared at the two martial saints and said, “I haven’t tried the martial saint’s primordial spirit yet. I think it will improve me tremendously.”

“Hand over your primordial spirit and I’ll spare your lives,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Qin Yu, don’t even think about it!”The two men sneered.

“Under the suppression of this yin qi, we are indeed no match for you. However, I’m afraid you won’t be able to kill me!”

Just as they had said, as a martial marquis, it was indeed impossible for Qin Yu to kill a martial saint.

What was even more vexing was that with Qin Yu’s current realm, he had no way to forcefully extract their primordial spirits.

Moreover, their bodies had long since lost their golden cores. Even if Qin Yu shattered their dantian, he would have gained nothing.

“Damn it.”Qin Yu could not help but curse inwardly.

“Since I can’t kill you, then take out all of Your Babe!”Qin Yu cursed.

He grabbed the martial saint with one hand and rubbed his other hand on their bodies.

What Space Divine Weapon? What Martial Saint Weapon? All of them had been snatched away by Qin Yu.

After all of them had been snatched away, Qin Yu still did not seem to feel satisfied.

He rubbed his chin and muttered, “If I can’t kill you, it’s not bad to make you lose face.”

Thus, Qin Yu grabbed the two of them roughly and directly shattered their clothes.

“Run Naked for me!”Qin Yu cursed.

These two martial saints’faces immediately turned red and they were so angry that their bodies were trembling!

Martial Saints were invincible in this world. Wherever they went, they would be respected?

Now, they were stripped naked in front of so many people. This was worse than killing them!
