1864 Heading toward the Tong Family

At the Demon-slaying peak.

In the blink of an eye, the day of departure arrived.

On this day, the peak master and Jiu Xiao seemed to have taken the initiative to step aside, giving all the authority to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu also knew their good intentions, so she didn’t say much.

!!

He swept his gaze over the crowd like a general about to set off an expedition.

Everyone held their breath, waiting for Qin Yu’s announcement.

Qin Yu did not speak for a long time. After a long time, he said in a deep voice, “At any time, protect your own life.”

Jiu Xiao and the peak master could not help but frown.

The two of them looked at each other and seemed to feel something was not right.

During a great battle, morale was needed, not such demoralizing words.

They looked at Qin Yu in unison, but the determination on his face cheered them up.

“Let’s go.” The peak master and Jiu Xiao did not say anything else. They knew that Qin Yu had been waiting for this moment for a long time.

Chang Mang was standing beside Qin Yu. He asked softly, “Qin Yu, who is the person you’re going to save?”

Qin Yu glanced at Chang Mang and said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “I think you two will get along well. I’ll introduce you to each other.”

After saying this, the teleportation formation slowly began to glow.

Everyone stepped into the formation one after another. Their destination was the Tong family.

At this moment, the Tong family knew nothing about this. They did not expect Qin Yu to have the idea of attacking them.

Zhongzhou had been peaceful for far too long.

Over the long years, Zhongzhou seemed to be the most stable place. The structure seemed to have set long ago, and there had never been a war.

Qin Yu’s appearance was undoubtedly the one who stirred up a storm in Zhongzhou.

Nearly 20 people arrived near the Tong family through the teleportation formation.

They were all wearing the outfit of Thunder Courtyard’s Demon-slaying Peak. From the back, there was a huge symbol of thunder.

This symbol was the symbol of Thunder Courtyard.

Qin Yu stood at the forefront. He activated his desolate divine eye, and his eyes glowed as he headed straight for Tianyun Sect.

Everyone was standing by Qin Yu, waiting for his order.

“Let’s go.”

With Qin Yu’s order, everyone followed Qin Yu and set off, heading straight for the Tong family.

The Tong family, a large aristocratic family in Zhong Zhou, was located on incredibly flat land.

The scenery here was beautiful, and it occupied a vast area. It indeed had the geographic advantage and opportune time.

Everything was going orderly. The Tong family had a large number of guests and servants. There were at least a few hundred people in total.

At this moment, the clear sky suddenly covered by dark clouds. The heavy dark clouds seemed to be about to fall.

It seemed to be a sign of something. Some Tong family members looked at the dark clouds and felt somewhat uneasy.

“The dark clouds are pressing down on the city.” An elderly man placed his hands behind his back and sighed.

Behind the dark clouds, nearly 20 people suddenly arrived!

They were awe-inspiring, and each of them exuded a terrifying killing intent. They also held different divine artifacts in their hands.

And the person leading was Qin Yu!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s face was extremely cold. His long robe was fluttering in the wind, and his long black hair was swaying along, making him look like a god of war.

“Who’s that?”

“Eh? Why would someone suddenly come to my Tong family?”

“Looking at this situation… Are they here to cause trouble?”

A huge commotion broke out below. They looked at the terrifying scene in the sky and were all in a panic.

Qin Yu looked down coldly, then shouted, “Tong Guangqing, get out here!”

A thunderous roar pierced through the clouds and cracked the rocks!

Everyone was alarmed by this loud roar. Some of the weaker ones were even shocked to the extent of spitting blood!

Eighteen people swore to crush the Tong family of Zhongzhou!

Deep down in the dungeon, Jue Wu, bound by chains, suddenly raised her head.

When she heard this familiar voice, she couldn’t help but mutter, “This voice is… Qin Yu?”

“Tong Guangqing, come out and die!”

Just as Jue Wu was feeling suspicious, another shout sounded.

Hearing this voice, Jue Wu was immediately convinced that the person who had come was none other than Qin Yu!

Everyone in the Tong family was shocked by Qin Yu, and countless people looked up at him.

A Tong family’s guardian shouted with an unfriendly expression, “Who are you? How dare you make a scene in the Tong family? How can you casually call Young Master Tong’s name?”

Qin Yu didn’t respond to the Tong family’s guardian’s shout. He only responded with a golden palm!

His palm streaked across the sky, smacking this guardian into meat paste directly!

...

This action instantly shocked the people in the Tong family.

That guardian was at the Reversion Void Stage, but he didn’t even have the power to fight back and was slapped to death. What a terrifying power!

At this moment, they understood that the person who had come was definitely not simple!

“Look at the logo on their bodies. They seem to be from Thunder Courtyard!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Eh? Why would Thunder Courtyard come to the Tong family? Why are they attacking the Tong family?”

“That’s not right. Thunder Courtyard can’t get involved in personal disputes, right?”

At this moment, Tong Guangqing, who had heard Qin Yu’s angry shout, also walked out of the mansion house with Uncle Guan beside him.

Apart from them, there were also ten or so Tong family elders and guest elders following behind them.

Tong Guangqing raised his head to look at the sky, and his eyes could not help but narrow slightly.

“Qin Yu? You’re still alive?” Tong Guangqing said in surprise.

Uncle Guan, who was at the side, frowned.

...

The head of the family had sent Tong Haoyang to kill Qin Yu, so why was Qin Yu safe and sound?

“Tong Guangqing, it’s time for you to die.” Qin Yu’s tone was so cold that it pierced into his heart like icicles.

Tong Guangqing sneered and said, “Qin Yu, I didn’t expect you to dare to come. Why? do you like our gift?”

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted slightly. He then sneered and said, “I’ll give you guys a gift too. I’m sure you’ll like it.”

After that, Qin Yu waved his hand, and a corpse fell from the sky and hit the ground hard with a loud noise.

The people from the Tong family were puzzled. They moved forward and looked at the headless corpse carefully.

“This… This seems to be Tong Haoyang’s body!” Uncle Guan was the first to recognize the owner of the body!

“Tong… Tong Haoyang?” Tong Guangqing’s expression changed drastically!

The surrounding people couldn’t help but whisper. They covered their mouths as if they couldn’t believe it.

Tong Guangqing’s expression was extremely complicated. He had always hoped that Tong Haoyang would die as soon as possible. However, after hearing Tong Lianyang’s words, he changed his mind.

He did not expect Tong Haoyang to turn into a corpse today, lying in front of him!

“How could it be Tong Haoyang?” Tong Guangqing didn’t seem to want to believe this truth.
