Chapter 1342: Chapter 1342: The Terrified City Lord of Gu City 1 

On the other side, Qin Yu was sitting on the wind-chasing stallion, hurrying towards the Wen family.

On the way, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself.

This Wen Wanye was far too different from the immortal-like character he had imagined. He was just like a rough man.

“No wonder the Wen brothers have such personalities...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

The two brothers did not take it seriously. Obviously, this was not the first time.

“F * ck, I wonder if we can make it back in time,”Wen da muttered.

“Why? Do you have anything else to do when you go back?”Qin Yu asked with some doubt.

Wen da glared and said, “Of course. The flower appreciation meeting that is held once every ten years is about to begin. If I miss it, I will be so angry!”

Qin Yu was slightly surprised and said, “I didn’t expect you to be a refined person.”

“Refined my ass. He’s just trying to pick up girls,”said Wen Er.

Wen da laughed and said, “Women are also flowers, and they are even more beautiful and flirtatious!”

At this point, Wen Da moved to Qin Yu’s side and said mysteriously, “Let me tell you, there are many beautiful women at this flower viewing event, and all of them have good taste. I can’t miss this opportunity!”

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He didn’t have the leisure to pick up any girls. He just wanted to recover his strength as soon as possible and go to the central plains to look for Yan Ruoxue.

The three of them flew in the air for a long time. About three days later, they landed at a place called Dayue City.

“Do you see it? The huge manor in front is our Wen family!”Wen Da said excitedly.

Following the direction of his finger, as expected, an enormous manor appeared in front of them.

This was the saint-level, after all. There was plenty of empty space here. To experts, a single piece of land was nothing.

“Let’s go. I’ll show you our Wen family’s Manor!”Wen Da pulled Qin Yu and stepped into the manor.

Upon entering the manor, they ran into two maids.

“Young Master Wen, you’re back.”The handmaidens greeted the Wen brothers.

“Yo, Little Flower, did you miss me?”Big Wen said with a smile.

“I hate you!”

“Eh? Little White, you’ve gained weight recently. Your Butt is bigger than before, but I like it!”

“That Ling ‘er, you look much fuller again.”

Along the way, almost all the handmaidens they met were teased by Big Wen.

Qin Yu’s old face was red. He wished he could find a hole to hide in.

...

Qin Yu only found out when he arrived at the Wen family that the Wen family no longer had any descendants. Wen Da and Wen Er’s father and uncle had both died in a battle a few years ago. In the entire Wen family, they were the only inheritance.

This was also the reason why Wen Wanji doted on these two grandsons. The only pity was that they did not inherit Wen Wanji’s talent in cultivation and only inherited Wen Wanji’s character.

There were hundreds of people in the Wen family. They were basically maids, servants, and guards of the Wen family.

Of course, there were also young people who came after hearing the news. They wanted to cultivate with Wen wanji, but they basically failed.

There was no other reason. Wen Wanji was temperamental, and his training was extremely strict. No one could withstand it, so he left the Wen family.

After walking around, Qin Yu found that in the entire Wen family, except for Wen Wanji’s training academy, almost all the other places were used for eating, drinking, and having fun.

It was said that in order to eat, the Wen family had invited over a dozen chefs of different styles, as well as many winemakers.

It was not an exaggeration to say that the Wen family was simply heaven on Earth.

“No wonder the two of you look down on the imperial palace in Gu City.”Qin Yu shook his head and said.

“TSK, what is that lousy Imperial Palace of his? One look and you can tell that he has no taste!”Wen Da rolled his eyes and said.

“That’s right, that’s right. If I were to build it, I would first tear down the main hall for him. Look at that Dragon and Phoenix carving. It’s vulgar! Too Vulgar!”Wen Er also said.

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry for a moment. He originally wanted to come to the Wen family to scout for news, but in the end, in the entire Wen family, there seemed to be no one who was “Decent”except for Wen wanwei.

“Is Senior Wen not at home?”Qin Yu asked. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Wen Da waved his hand and said, “We made an agreement to come back in these two days. Whoever comes back late will be punished for drinking wine and will have to give the other party a million spirit coins!”

“Hehe, looks like we won,”Wen er said with a smile.

Qin Yu opened his mouth but was speechless.

Qin Yu had never seen such a way of dealing with each other.

“Qin Yu, you should rest for a day first. Tomorrow and the day after, we will take you to the Flower Appreciation Meeting!”Wen Da said mysteriously.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”

...

Gu City, where the Heavenly Cloud sect was stationed.

The city lord was sitting in a room, his face full of worry.

“We sent over a hundred people to capture that Qin Yu, but in the end, we let him escape.”The city Lord Sighed.

A middle-aged man sitting in front of him couldn’t help but sneer, “That’s because you guys are incompetent. A hundred people can’t capture him, Qin Yu?”

The city lord glanced at him and said with a bitter smile, “Capturing him is naturally not a problem. It’s just that... Wen Wanli suddenly crossed his arms. Old Wang, you have to help me speak up more.”

The man who was called Old Wang immediately frowned.

“Wen Wanli? This madman, why does he have to interfere in this matter?”Old Wang said with a frown.

“It’s all because of his two grandsons.”The city Lord Sighed.

Old Wang was silent for a moment before he stood up and said, “No, I have to report this matter to the sect master immediately!”
