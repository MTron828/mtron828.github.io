Chapter 507: Number One of the Younger Generation! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

He Teng’s expression was somewhat unsightly, and beads of sweat flowed down his forehead.

He had fought with Qin Yu before, and he knew Qin Yu’s strength very well.

But he simply couldn’t give up just like that!

“I also want to see just how strong a person who has stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis realm is!” He Teng roared explosively, and his qi energy instantly erupted before charging towards Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed!

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and sneered. He didn’t take He Teng seriously at all.

“Bang!”

Just as He Teng rushed over, Qin Yu suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed He Teng’s neck!

All of his internal qi wasn’t worth mentioning at this moment!

Qin Yu used his physical body to pass through his cultivation technique and easily grabbed He Teng’s neck before lifting him up into the air.

The enormous strength of his fingers caused He Teng’s expression to change drastically!

He was once the number one person in the Central Plains, but at this moment, he realized that he couldn’t break free at all!

“I’ve said it before. Among those of the same level, you’re just a piece of trash,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He Teng gritted his teeth. He tried to struggle, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

All of his pride was shattered at this moment!

“Tell me, what exactly is going on with Fang Yue,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He Teng said with difficulty, “If I tell you, can you spare my life...”

“No,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“But I can make your death easier.”

When He Teng heard this, a trace of anger immediately rose in his heart!

He was unwilling to die just like that!

“Qin Yu, don’t even think about it!” He Teng said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said with a cold smile, “In the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, there are many ways to deal with people. I want to see how long you can last.”

After he said that, Qin Yu slowly raised his left hand.

A light spot condensed on his palm and landed between He Teng’s brows.

That light spot instantly entered He Teng’s mind!

In that instant, He Teng felt as if his brain had been struck by lightning, and his entire head seemed as if it was about to explode!

“Ah!!”

The pain made He Teng roar, and his body trembled non-stop!

“Wait until I break your limbs and cripple your dantian, then I’ll slowly torture you,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

At this moment, that hoarse voice appeared in He Teng’s mind.

“Give me your body... I’ll bring you out of here...”

He Teng, who was in pain and suffering, desperately shouted, “I want you to help me kill Qin Yu! I want you to tear him into pieces!”

“Okay...” that hoarse voice said with a gloomy tone.

“Give me control of your body, and you can take revenge...”

“Ah!!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He Teng raised his head and roared angrily. He seemed to be unable to hold on any longer!

Right at this moment, He Teng’s body suddenly emitted a ray of light!

The internal qi in his body was rising rapidly, and his entire body became a few times stronger!

“Huh?” Qin Yu frowned.

He felt as if his hands were about to be stretched open, and He Teng seemed to have transformed into a different person!

“Boom!”

The enormous force pushed Qin Yu back, and his hands couldn’t help but loosen!

“Qin Yu!” The Fifth Elder and the others hurriedly surrounded him.

Qin Yu frowned. He stared at He Teng, and a trace of doubt flashed through his eyes.

He Teng stood there, and a different internal qi erupted from his entire body.

A moment later, He Teng turned around and looked at Qin Yu.

A cold smile completely different from He Teng’s demeanor just now appeared!

“Qin Yu... speaking of which, I have to thank you...” He Teng grinned.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Thank me? What do you mean?”

He Teng laughed loudly and said, “You don’t need to know. We’ll meet again in the future!”

After saying these words, He Teng turned around and was about to leave!

“Where are you going?!” Qin Yu’s hair flapped wildly and he took a step forward!

He held the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist in his hand and smashed it at He Teng!

He Teng didn’t even turn his head. He turned around and slapped it, and the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist vanished into thin air!

Then, He Teng quickly fled!

In the blink of an eye, he disappeared from everyone’s sight.

Qin Yu frowned tightly.

“There is indeed something wrong with He Teng!” Qin Yu said in a cold voice.

His strength had soared in a short period of time, and his demeanor was like a different person’s.

Looking in the direction He Teng had left in, Qin Yu was silent for a long while.

“I let him escape again.” Qin Yu’s brows were furrowed.

“Elder Qin, are you alright?” The pharmacists surrounded him.

Qin Yu shook his head and asked, “Where is the Pavilion Master?”

“The Pavilion Master has returned to the Pavilion Master’s Residence,” said the Fifth Elder.

Qin Yu nodded. He didn’t say anything and turned around to return to the Elder’s Residence.

Sitting in the Elder’s Residence, Qin Yu closed his eyes. He couldn’t help but think of Han Wei.

There were only twenty days left until September 9th.

During this period of time, there was almost no news of Han Wei.

“Right now, I am only in the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, but I can crush a half-step Martial Marquis. Han Wei is only a half-step Martial Marquis. He isn’t worth mentioning,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Unless he can step into the Martial Marquis realm, he isn’t worth mentioning.”

Although that was the case, Han Wei was a member of an aristocratic family after all. He wasn’t someone that an ordinary half-step Martial Marquis could compare with.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but take out his phone and open the Martial Arts Forum.

As soon as he opened the Forum, Qin Yu saw an eye-catching message:

Yan Jinyao had officially stepped into the Martial Marquis realm. He was the number one person of the younger generation.

There were tons of comments below. Other than comments praising Yan Jinyao’s strength, there were also people who mentioned Qin Yu.

“As the heir of the Yan family, Yan Jinyao definitely won’t let Qin Yu off, right?”

“Yes, Qin Yu killed Yan Jinyao’s grandfather. Yan Jinyao naturally won’t let him off!”

“The two of them are of the younger generation. Even if they fight, no one can say anything.”

Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat ugly, and he even felt a trace of pressure.

He had just stepped into the Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, but Yan Jinyao had already stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm!

There weren’t many Martial Marquises in the world, and Yan Jinyao was probably the youngest one!

“Blue bloods are really impressive!” Qin Yu was silent.

There were many geniuses in Jingdu, and Yan Jinyao was probably not the only one. Who knew how many other genius blue bloods there were?

And as people in the same circle, they were naturally Qin Yu’s foes.

He was destined to have enemies, and they were privileged people.

“Yan Jinyao...” Qin Yu muttered this name in a low voice. He couldn’t help but think of the last time they met.

At this moment, another message was sent out:

“Han Wei will come out of seclusion soon!”
