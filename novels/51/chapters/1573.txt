Chapter 1574: Chapter 1,574, the Furious Qin Yu 1

Although the speed of the line word formula was fast, it consumed a lot of spiritual power.

Even if Qin Yu’s spiritual power was as vast as the sea, it would still be difficult for him to perform the line word formula the entire time.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu couldn’t care less. All he could think about was the final dance.

He felt extremely uneasy. He kept feeling that something big had happened to the final dance.

For three whole days, Qin Yu didn’t even stop to rest.

When he rushed to Mount Hua Ning, the spiritual power in his body was already depleted, and he was so tired that he was sweating profusely.

He looked at Mount Hua Ning, which had already turned into ruins, and his face became extremely ugly!

“As expected... as expected!”Qin Yu clenched his teeth, and his whole body was almost trembling!

He released his divine sense, covering more than half of Mount Hua Ning.

Very quickly, he discovered several figures on Mount Hua Ning.

These figures were all extremely unfamiliar, each of them in a hurry.

They were busy searching for and moving the remaining items on Mount Hua Ning, in an incomparably hurried manner.

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned ice-cold. His body trembled, and he instantly appeared high up in the sky.

......

“All of you, Stop!”Qin Yu roared, instantly shaking the entire Mount Hua Ning into a buzzing sound!

Everyone present was stunned by this shout. Some of them even vomited blood on the spot!

Qin Yu swept his cold gaze across the crowd before he slowly landed in the middle of them.

This group of people had already wet their pants in fear. They looked at Qin Yu with trembling eyes and said with an embarrassed smile, “All... All for you, all for you...”

Upon hearing these words, Qin Yu, who was already furious, became even more furious. A wave of killing intent instantly swept across the entire Hua Ning Mountain!

This caused everyone present to be even more terrified. Some even knelt down on the spot.

“Let me ask you.”Qin Yu took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed his anger.

“Where’s Jue Wu? Where did she go?”

Everyone looked at each other and then hurriedly said, “Don’t you know? Lord Jue Wu was besieged by two mysterious people and suffered heavy injuries. Now, her life and death are unknown...”

“Yes, yes. We tried to find Lord Jue Wu’s body, but we didn’t find it. Including her two attendants and the two drinking friends, they are all gone...”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned extremely pale!

He said with a trembling voice, “Who... who did it...”

“I don’t know. Rumor has it that it’s someone from the northern land. It seems to be some two great godly kings of the northern land.”The person next to him didn’t dare to hide it and hurriedly said.

“But don’t worry too much. After all, we haven’t seen Jue Wu’s corpse. It’s possible that she’s fine...”

Despair appeared on Qin Yu’s face. Qin Yu’s feelings towards Jue Wu were extremely complicated.

If it weren’t for Jue Wu’s repeated actions, the current Qin Yu would have long been reduced to a corpse.

“Have you guys seen qu Zhu?”Qin Yu asked.

“No... We haven’t,”the person next to him quickly replied.

Qin Yu endured his grief and slowly said, “I understand. You guys can go.”

Everyone looked at each other and immediately turned to run.

Qin Yu was the only one left in the entire Hua Ning mountain.

He slowly paced around Hua Ning mountain, trying to find any traces.

Unfortunately, there were no other traces other than battle marks.

It was obvious that the scene had gone through a fierce battle. The entire Hua Ning Mountain had already turned into ruins.

Standing in the cultivation room, Qin Yu could not help but feel a little unbearable.

He squatted on the ground. The pain in his heart could not be described with words.

“Jue Wu...”Qin Yu gritted his teeth, afraid that tears would fall.

However, he was also very clear in his heart that pain was useless.

Moreover, the life and death of Jue Wu was unknown. He was not sure if she was still alive.

This also caused a glimmer of hope to emerge in Qin Yu’s heart.

He slowly stood up, his expression turning extremely cold.

After that, Qin Yu turned around and walked down from Mount Hua Ning.

He did not know where to look for the two godly monarchs. He only heard that the godly monarchs had also gone to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Hence, Qin Yu rushed straight to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Heavenly Cloud sect.

The deputy sect master was severely injured. Under the treatment of many alchemists, he still did not show any signs of life.

“How is it? is the Deputy Sect Master Alright?”Di Zun hurriedly asked from the side.

The Alchemist shook his head and said, “The situation is not good. I have temporarily sealed his mingmen, but if we want to cure him, I’m afraid...”

Di Zun and the surrounding people’s expressions became somewhat solemn.

“If this goes on, how long can the deputy sect master live?”Di Zun asked.

The Alchemist said in a deep voice, “At most a week. I suggest you go to the Holy Region and find a stronger alchemist.”

“Going to the holy region... is not that simple.”The disciples around him could not help but have ugly expressions.

Di Zun gritted his teeth and said, “Going to the Holy Region in a week is simply impossible... even if I set off now, it would be too late unless I use the heavenly cloud sect’s teleportation formation.”

“No one can open the formation without the sect master’s order,”someone reminded at this moment.

The deputy sect master who was lying on the bed said with difficulty, “Forget it... I’m afraid I won’t be able to live for long. Don’t go through so much trouble...”

“No!”Di ZUN’s expression was cold.

He took a deep breath and said, “Take me to the array platform. I’ll set off for the Holy Region immediately.”

“No, if you open the array platform without permission, the sect master will blame you...”

“If the sect master blames you, I, Di Zun, will bear the responsibility!”Di Zun shouted.

“Don’t worry. I have already hired an alchemist. This alchemist’s standard is very high. He will arrive soon.”At this moment, elder Bai said indifferently.

Everyone immediately turned to look at elder Bai.

Elder bai said somewhat proudly, “This alchemist is someone I met by chance when I was traveling. He’s also the strongest alchemist I’ve ever seen! I dare to guarantee that he’ll definitely be able to cure the vice sect master!”

Di Zun frowned slightly and said in a deep voice, “I’d better go to the holy region and make some plans.”

“There’s no need to go to the Holy Region.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

At this moment, a voice was heard.

This voice was none other than Qin Yu.

Qin Yu slowly walked in with an extremely cold expression.

“Master? Why are you here?”

Seeing Qin Yu, Di Zun hurriedly walked over.

He ignored him and walked to the deputy sect master. Then, he raised his hand and placed it on the deputy sect master’s chest.

“Don’t tell me you want to harm the deputy sect master?”At this moment, elder Bai said with a strange tone.

Qin Yu gave elder Bai a cold glance, and elder Bai hurriedly hid behind di zun.

Then, Qin Yu ignored elder Bai. He raised his palm and placed it between the deputy sect master’s eyebrows, feeling the flow of the internal Qi in his body.

A moment later, Qin Yu looked at di zun and said, “It’s okay. Give me some time. I will refine a pill.”

“Really, master!”Di Zun asked excitedly.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Don’t worry.”

“TSK tsk, who knows if you want to harm our deputy sect leader.”At this moment, elder Bai said with a strange tone.
