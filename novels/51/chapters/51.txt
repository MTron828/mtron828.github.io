It was under Sun Peng’s lead that everyone ran over to mock and ridicule Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked at the many businessmen below the stage and slowly said, “I don’t have a prescription, but I can give you all the rights to represent me. I will only take 10%.”

Hearing this, everyone was instantly extremely excited!

Just taking 10% was equivalent to giving it to them for free!

“But I have a condition.” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly spoke.

He looked coldly at Shen Tian and said, “No one is allowed to do business with the Shen family, and all the prices must be the same.”

“Otherwise, your right to act as an agent will be revoked.”

Qin Yu was clearly targeting the Shen family.

Once the price was standardized, Shen Yun would have no way to buy it from others!

Shen Yun looked at Qin Yu coldly. He suddenly slammed the table and stood up as he angrily berated, “Qin Yu, do you think you can compete against me with this lousy Soul Nourishment Pill? Let me tell you, it’s impossible!”

“Whether or not it’s impossible is not up to you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Shen Yun glared at Qin Yu and said with a vicious tone, “Let’s wait and see!”

After saying that, Shen Yun turned around and left.

Sun Peng, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed. He shamelessly walked to Qin Yu and said with a sheepish smile, “Mr. Qin, I. . . I was just joking just now. Are you offended?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and waved his hand as he said, “Lei Hu, throw him out!”

“Yes! Mr. Qin!” Lei Hu quickly called out to a few people and directly threw Sun Peng out of the door.

Su Yan and Zhao Gang didn’t dare to stay any longer and quickly left No. 1 Grand Mansion.

“When did that loser learn about Chinese medicine...” After walking out of No. 1 Grand Mansion, Su Yan couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

She had lived with Qin Yu for three whole years, but in these three years, Qin Yu couldn’t do anything other than doing laundry and cooking!

Zhao Gang’s expression was grim, and he didn’t say anything.

After it was over, Qin Yu and the genius Dr. Yang came backstage.

“Mr. Yang, this is the pill formula for the Soul Nourishment Pill.” Qin Yu was very generous, and directly handed the pill formula for the Soul Nourishment Pill to Mr. Yang.

“I can’t believe that I actually get to see such a mysterious pill formula in my life... I will die without regrets!” Mr. Yang grabbed the pill formula, and tears of excitement flowed down his face.

At this point, Mr. Yang suddenly looked at Qin Yu and said, “If you are willing, I can refine the Soul Nourishment Pill for you!”

Qin Yu froze for a moment before he said happily, “Mr. Yang, are you serious?”

“I’m absolutely serious! Please trust me!” Mr. Yang said earnestly.

“That’s great!” Qin Yu’s tone was filled with excitement. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

With Mr. Yang’s help, Qin Yu could free up a lot of time.

Moreover, Mr. Yang had many disciples under him and they could all refine the Soul Nourishment Pill for Qin Yu.

The two of them instantly bonded, and they chatted happily.

Through their communication, Qin Yu could clearly feel that Mr. Yang was a medicine geek. He had practically devoted his entire life to refining pills.

“It’s a pity that I’m not talented enough. I can only stay in Jiangcheng for my entire life.” Mr. Yang sighed slightly.

Then, he changed the topic and looked at Qin Yu while saying, “With your talent, you definitely shouldn’t just stay in Jiangcheng. At least, you should go to the Chinese Medicine Conference to compete and prove yourself!”

“Chinese Medicine Conference?” Qin Yu frowned and asked with some confusion, “What’s that?”

Mr. Yang said in surprise, “You actually don’t know?”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said awkwardly, “Mr. Yang, I rarely go out, so I don’t know much about this...”

When Mr. Yang heard this, he immediately explained, “The Chinese Medicine Conference is a competition organized by our country for Chinese medicine. It’s usually held biannually. As long as you rank high, you will get a stalk of herbs as a reward.”

“Last year, the first prize in Chuzhou was allegedly a hundred-year-old King of Medicine.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately stood up.

“Mr. Yang, is what you said true?” Qin Yu’s excitement couldn’t be concealed.

A 100-year-old King of Medicine was enough for Qin Yu to refine ten Qi Gathering Pills! When that time came, his strength would definitely improve by leaps and bounds!

Mr. Yang nodded and said, “Of course it’s true.”

At this point, Mr. Yang said somewhat regretfully, “I’ve participated a few times, but I wasn’t able to rank high for Jiangcheng.”

“I thought there was no hope for Jiangcheng. If you participate, you will definitely bring glory to Jiangcheng’s traditional Chinese medicine world!”
