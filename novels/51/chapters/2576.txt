Chapter 2577: Confused Consciousness

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“I’ll go alone. I’m used to it.”

Xiao Hai shook his head, smiled, and said. A look of anticipation appeared on his usually calm face for the first time, as if a young man had stepped onto the path of cultivation for the first time.

A day passed by very quickly. Qin Yu walked around in this Saint Kingdom.

At this point, he began to understand that there was a self-imposed constraint in this place, the power of this Saint Kingdom.

Just like the human race, they would be suppressed when they entered the ghost and demon realms.

But here, the suppression was even more emphatic, and he could not even use a trace of the power he had comprehended previously.

However, his skills and martial arts techniques were not affected at all. For instance, the battle instinct, he could still suppress them with his combat skills even though his body was inferior to the other party when he fought with some demonic beasts here.

Of course, they were the uncivilized demonic beasts. Qin Yu felt a great danger in this eternal night kingdom.

There was one advantageous aspect for him. After the original soul power underwent the baptism of the holy energy, not only did it enhance the power of origin, but its original power remained relatively consistent.

In other words, his powerful soul from previously still had an advantage.

Moreover, he could still use the special power, the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

This was also one of the reasons why he could kill eight uncivilized living beings in a day.

What made him feel strange was that the Seal of Heaven Returning that Chen Shuang had condensed for him still existed in his soul and did not collapse when his body shattered.

This time, the Seal of Heaven Returning also allowed him to recover much strength after the battle.

“Young Brother, be careful. Don’t make any noise.”

Suddenly, a very soft voice sounded behind Qin Yu’s ear.

Qin Yu’s hair stood on end, and his body instantly tensed up as tight as steel.

The voice was very close, but he did not sense it at all. If it had ill intentions toward him, the sneak attack on Qin Yu would probably have succeeded.

“Don’t be nervous. Something is coming. You must not make any movements.”

Suddenly, a stinky wolf skin was thrown over and covered Qin Yu’s body.

Not long after, Qin Yu heard a dense flapping sound from above his head. He raised his head slightly while crouching on the ground.

Oh boy! Crows stretched into the distance. There were at least a few thousand crows in the sky.

Moreover, he felt they could not be trifled with just by looking at those blood-red crow eyes.

Suddenly, hundreds of crows swooped down.

A mournful bear roar came from a forest, and in a few seconds, the sound died down.

Nearly an hour later, a rustling sound came from his back.

A slightly elderly middle-aged man and a boy about six or seven years old laughing heartily, appeared behind Qin Yu.

“The old man’s reminder was pertinent. If I were to be targeted by the crows, I would have died.”

Qin Yu subconsciously stepped back.

Although the old man had just saved his life, the living being that could appear here could not be assessed by common sense. It was better to be careful.

“Night Demon Crow, a demonic beast that rumor says will only awaken in the eternal night kingdom. I didn’t expect the legend to be true.”

The old man stared at the crows that had left, not reacting to Qin Yu’s wariness.

“You should also be an external living being, right?” The old man turned his head and suddenly asked.

This old man was not simple!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and prepared his body for battle.

“Don’t be nervous, Big Brother. Grandpa has been living here for more than 700 mystical years, so he knows many things. Besides, the village chief accepted three people like you into the village yesterday.”

The boy grinned and said.

“Are you the natives of this place? You seem different from what I’ve come into contact with so far.”

Qin Yu asked softly.

Many places seemed to have derived from this Saint Kingdom. Just like on Earth, there were villages, towns, and countries.

“Are you talking about those uncivilized demonic beasts? These living beings have yet to awaken their consciousness. Here, they are called Confused Consciousness. Those who have just awakened their consciousness are called Human Consciousness. Those above that are called True Consciousness. After that, they are called Dao Consciousness, and beyond that, I have no idea.” The old man, sensing Qin Yu’s wariness, did not approach him.

“What level of consciousness do you belong to, Old Man? And where did you acquire this information?”

Qin Yu vaguely sensed the old man did not seem to have any ill intentions, so he continued to ask.

“We are Confused Consciousness.”

The old man said with a smile. As if he could see Qin Yu’s surprise, he continued to explain.

“However, since we were born, the village chief has been guiding us. Due to this, we gradually developed some consciousness. The village chief also taught us the method to avoid these wild beasts. The village chief said that we’re still some distance away from becoming Human Consciousness.”

“What?”

Qin Yu was shocked. This elderly man was at the lowest level of existence in this Saint Kingdom.

What about True Consciousness and Dao Consciousness? From the names, this Saint Kingdom seemed to have a cultivation system.

He had used his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze to pry into this Saint

Kingdom, but he did not sense any power of the way. How did they cultivate?

“Then what level is your village chief?”

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment before asking.

“Big Brother! The village chief was the most amazing person. He was the most powerful person here! Do you want to go back to the village with us and get to know the village chief? You’ll surely think he’s amazing!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The boy said, bouncing around with a round head that nodded and swayed, looking incredibly adorable.

He only knew a few adjectives, such as amazing and very powerful. He looked so adorable.

“I’ve asked the village chief before, but he didn’t answer me. He should be a Human Consciousness or an expert of a higher level. Otherwise, how could he enlighten us?”

The old man smiled and rubbed the little boy’s head.

“Forget it, I’m not going.”

Although Qin Yu wanted to get to know the village chief they were talking about, he was a little worried.

“Young Man, you must be careful then. We’re going back now. The village chief said that many outsiders like you have died.”

The old man shook his head and was about to leave with the boy.

Qin Yu’s body moved and silently walked toward another place.

Like a ghost, he shuttled through the forest, his body agile and swift, almost without a sound. He changed several directions before he stopped.

At this moment, the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze on his forehead slowly appeared.

He clearly saw those two figures in the world of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

Like infrared rays, the two slowly walked away.

“What a wonderful person. And he didn’t have any sense of wariness?” Qin Yu was a little curious. He had never let down his guard.

This old man could live for more than 700 years. Based on his condition, Qin Yu felt he could not have survived for so long..
