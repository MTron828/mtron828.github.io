2006 Third Princess Pleading

Qin Yu raised his head to look at Uncle Yan, wanting to see something from his face. Unfortunately, Uncle Yan was merely smiling, so he could not see anything. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yan Pingnan, whose idea is it that you’re making a move now?” Yan Guyun asked.

“It’s the saintess’s will. She wants me to save Qin Yu no matter what.” Uncle Yan bowed and said with a smile.

“In that case, the saintess is indeed related to this Qin Yu?” Yan Guyun raised his eyebrows.

“I’ve never asked about things that have nothing to do with me,” Uncle Yan said with a smile.

Yan Guyun sneered. He put his hands behind his back and said, “Do you know what it means for Qin Yu to attack the third princess? If we don’t teach him a lesson, how will the Yan family keep a foothold in the future?”

“Didn’t you already teach him a lesson?” Uncle Yan was still smiling.

Yan Guyun shook his head and said, “The order of the family head is to kill Qin Yu. It is a lesson for him.”

Qin Yu could not help but sigh after hearing Yan Guyun’s words.

He had finally fallen out with the Yan family. The Yan family had indeed planned to kill him. It would be difficult for him to get in touch with Yan Ruoxue in the future.

“The saintess’s idea is to protect Qin Yu,” Uncle Yan continued.

“You should know I’m only responsible to the family head. I only listen to his orders,” Yan Guyun said lightly.

“Then you should know I am only responsible for the saintess and only listen to her orders,” Uncle Yan smiled faintly and said.

Yan Guyun’s face turned cold. He looked at Uncle Yan and said, “Yan Pingnan, so you’re planning to attack me?”

“If I have no choice, I can only attack you,” Uncle Yan said.

Yan Guyun looked at Uncle Yan coldly and said, “Do you think you can stop me?”

“Maybe I can try.” The internal qi on Uncle Yan’s body quietly burst out.

Qin Yu knew he couldn’t help with anything, so he immediately carried Jue Wu and hid to the side.

The two internal qis clashed non-stop in the void, and the clashing sound was endless. It was tremendously terrifying.

The collision of such existences could destroy a city easily. It would be hard to preserve the Tai Chi Diagram here.

“You’re courting death,” Yan Guyun said coldly and walked toward Uncle Yan.

Just as the two parties were about to fight, the third princess suddenly ran over.

She stood opposite Yan Guyun, shook her head, and said, “Let’s forget it.”

Yan Guyun was stunned. He couldn’t believe his ears.

“Third Princess, what did you say?” Yan Guyun frowned slightly.

“I said forget it,” the third princess repeated. “Let them go.”

Not only was Yan Guyun stunned, but even Uncle Yan was dumbfounded.

The third princess was a person who would always seek revenge for a tiny grievance. She regarded human lives as worthless, so how could she let Qin Yu off so easily?

“Third Princess, have you been harassed? With me around, you don’t have to be afraid,” Yan Guyun said coldly.

The third princess shook her head and said. “No, Qin Yu didn’t do anything to me. Let him go.”

“What about your injuries?” Yan Guyun looked at the third princess in disbelief.

“This has nothing to do with Qin Yu,” the third princess frowned and said. ” Anyway, let him go. I want to go back now. I’m tired.”

Yan Guyun remained silent as if he was thinking about something.

The third princess said unhappily, “My father wants you to save me and bring me back. If you don’t let him go, I won’t go back either!”

Yan Guyun could not help but laugh bitterly.

He shook his head, and the internal qi on his body slowly dissipated.

Following that, Yan Guyun glanced at Qin Yu and said with a hint of a smile, “It seems you have some ability to make the third princess plead for you.”

Qin Yu dared not speak. He stood at the side without saying a thing.

“Yan Pingnan, you’re lucky,” Yan Guyun said. “But since you dare to go against me, I will remember this.”

Uncle Yan bowed slightly and did not reply.

Yan Guyun didn’t say anything else. He waved his hand and said, “Bring the third princess back.”

“Yes.”

The surrounding people stepped into the void and left in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu only heaved a sigh of relief after they left.

“Uncle Yan, thank you,” Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

Uncle Yan looked at Qin Yu curiously and said, “How did you get the third princess to plead for you? Don’t tell me you had a hold over her?”

“I only saved her life,” Qin Yu shook his head and said.

“You saved her life?” Uncle Yan was even more surprised.

Qin Yu didn’t elaborate on this matter but changed the topic. “Uncle Yan, did Ruoxue send you here?”

“Otherwise?” Uncle Yan sighed slightly. “Kid, since the family head has sent Yan Guyun, it means he has the intention to kill you. You’re on your own now. ”

“Uncle Yan, what is the background of this Yan Guyun?” Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said. “His strength is indeed so terrifying…”

“You don’t have to know that. In any case, Yan Guyun is not someone you can mess with,” Uncle Yan said.

After saying this, Uncle Yan looked into the distance and said, “I should go back and report my work. I believe the Yao family will arrive soon. You should leave early and return to Thunder Courtyard.”

“I know, Uncle Yan.” Qin Yu nodded.

...

He thanked Uncle Yan again and carried Jue Wu, planning to leave this place.

Although there were secrets hidden in this place, staying alive was the most important thing at the moment. Qin Yu could only leave for now.

…

At the Yan family, Yan Ruoxue was sitting on the edge of the cliff. Her eyes were closed, and her surroundings were emitting a holy light.

However, these lights were tremendously unstable. They were at times bright and at times dim, indicating the tremendously uneasy feeling in the heart.

Yan Ruoxue sighed slightly. She slowly opened her eyes and looked into the distance.

At this moment, Uncle Yan’s internal qi appeared on Mount Donghuang. Yan Ruoxue hurriedly stood up floating toward Uncle Yan’s direction.

Soon, Uncle Yan arrived in front of Yan Ruoxue.

“Uncle Yan, how is it?” Yan Ruoxue asked anxiously.

“It’s fine now,” Uncle Yan said with a smile.

Upon hearing this, Yan Ruoxue’s anxious heart finally relaxed.

...

“You and Yan Guyun…didn’t fight, right?” Yan Ruoxue asked.

“If we had fought, I wouldn’t be standing here safe and sound.” Uncle Yan smiled bitterly.

This surprised Yan Ruoxue. She asked in confusion, “Yan Guyun didn’t make a move? How did you do it?”

“I’m afraid you’ll have to ask the third princess about this,” Uncle Yan sighed with emotion and said. “Looks like this Qin Yu is indeed quite capable. Even the third princess took the initiative to plead for him…”

“The third princess pleaded for Qin Yu?” Yan Ruoxue was stunned. She couldn’t believe her ears.

“It’s very surprising, isn’t it?” Uncle Yan nodded slightly and said.
