Chapter 610: Swallowing the Inner Core Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu tried his best, but he was still unable to do anything to this door.

This door was simple and unadorned. He didn’t know what material it was made of, but it was extremely hard. Even Black Gold Stone couldn’t compare to it.

“Perhaps... there is some mechanism here that can open this door?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He immediately released his divine sense and began a search to find the mechanism of this door.

But unfortunately, Qin Yu spent an entire day and still couldn’t find the so-called mechanism.

This made Qin Yu worry.

Could it be that he would be trapped here for the rest of his life?

“Forget it.” After thinking for a long time, Qin Yu decided to cultivate in seclusion and swallow these inner cores.

If he was strong enough, he might be able to break through this door.

Although he didn’t know what realm he had to reach to do so, Qin Yu had no other way at the moment.

The Immortal Slaying Sect was extremely large and almost occupied the internal space of the entire island.

In fact, not only Qin Yu, but even Yan Guiyi and the others hadn’t searched the Immortal Slaying Sect.

Therefore, no one knew what treasures there were in the Immortal Slaying Sect.

“Corpses will rot and bodies can be destroyed. However, artifacts and weapons will definitely be left behind.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Normally speaking, people who had cultivated to the Mighty Realm would be able to preserve their bodies for many years even if they died.

However, the strangest thing about the Immortal Slaying Sect was that there wasn’t a single complete corpse. Other than the sect master’s half-decayed corpse, the rest had practically become skeletons.

Qin Yu didn’t think any further. He took out his inner core and began to devour and cultivate.

...

In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed.

During these ten days, the discussions about Qin Yu never stopped.

Qin Yu’s friends all came to the Green Moon Villa to wait for Qin Yu’s arrival.

However, after such a long time, there was still no news of Qin Yu. This made them lose confidence.

“Is Mr. Qin really dead...” Yao Qing knelt on the ground with tears on his face.

Among these people, Yao Qing was the most upset.

He had known Qin Yu for the longest time and they had experienced too much together.

Now that hope was lost, he was overwhelmed with anguish.

Zhen Yue stood by the bed and gazed outside while murmuring, “Is Mr. Qin really not coming back...”

...

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Qu Xie hadn’t reported this news to anyone.

Although he thought it was impossible for Qin Yu to escape from the Immortal Slaying Sect, he was still worried.

Now that ten days had passed, Qu Xie finally breathed a sigh of relief.

“It seems that this guy is really dead,” Qu Xie sneered.

Then, he turned around and walked toward the conference room.

On the other side, the Yan family and the Han family were celebrating.

“Haha, Qin Yu is finally dead!” Han Meng said with a smile while holding a glass.

Yan Sihai shook the red wine in his hand and said indifferently, “I’ve said before that he isn’t worth mentioning. He is just a martial artist. You think too highly of him.”

“President Yan is right!” Han Meng hurriedly raised his glass and said.

Speaking up to this point, Han Meng gave Han Wei a look.

Han Wei hurriedly raised his glass and said, “Mr. Yan, look... about my wedding with Miss Yan...”

Yan Sihai glanced at Han Wei and snorted lightly. “Han Wei, it’s not that I don’t like you. You lost to Qin Yu in front of everyone. Do you still have the nerve to come to the Yan family to propose marriage?”

When he heard this, Han Wei’s expression immediately changed.

He hurriedly said, “Mr. Yan, please give me another chance. I... I definitely won’t let you down!”

“The last time was just an accident. You have to believe me. My ability is definitely not below Qin Yu’s!”

Han Meng, who was beside him, also said with a smile, “President Yan, isn’t Qin Yu already dead? Besides, martial arts doesn’t mean everything, right?”

Yan Sihai waved his hand and said, “Let’s talk about this matter in the future.”

Han Wei’s expression was a bit ugly. He gritted his teeth, but didn’t dare to say anything.

In a private house in the suburbs.

This private house wasn’t big, but it had a total of seven people living in it.

With a slightly worried look on their faces, they surrounded a strong man.

“Chang Mang won’t die just like that, right?” Someone asked with a frown.

“If that’s the case, wouldn’t Mr. Qin have died in vain?”

“It’s been ten days, but Chang Mang still has no signs of waking up... this...”

Everyone frowned.

Qin Yu died because he saved Chang Mang. If Chang Mang died just like that, no one would be able to accept it.

At this moment, Chang Mang finally opened his eyes slightly.

He rubbed his forehead, slowly stood up and said, “Where am I?”

“You... You’re finally awake!” When they saw Chang Mang wake up, everyone immediately surrounded him.

Chang Mang said somewhat dumbfoundedly, “What... What’s going on?”

Everyone opened their mouths and then sighed. They told Chang Mang what had happened.

After Chang Mang heard this, he suddenly sat up from the window. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You... you said that because Qin Yu saved me, he was locked up in the Immortal Slaying Sect?” Chang Mang’s eyes had a ferocious look in them.

The few of them nodded and said, “Yes.”

This made Chang Mang feel extreme anguish, and his huge body trembled slightly.

“Qin Yu...” Chang Mang gritted his teeth. He glared at the north and shouted, “Qin Yu, I will definitely avenge you. I will definitely kill Yan Guiyi!”

His angry voice reverberated for a long time.

The few of them thought it over and finally decided to join the Green Moon Villa!

The Green Moon Villa was Qin Yu’s brainchild. They decided to protect the Green Moon Villa well.

On the other side, He Teng was rushing towards the Green Moon Villa.

Currently, he had an even more sinister aura, and it was difficult to discern his gender.. Even his voice had become a little shrill.

“As long as I devour enough people... I can be resurrected! No, to be precise, I can live with you!” That hoarse voice sounded in He Teng’s mind.

He Teng licked his lips and said sinisterly, “This is why you agreed to Yan Guiyi, isn’t it?”

“That’s right... cooperating with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will make it easier for us to kill people!” That hoarse voice sounded.

He Teng sneered. “Yan Guiyi wants to use me... but he doesn’t know that I’m using him too!”

He planned to head to the Green Moon Villa and start a massacre!

Not only would he be able to complete the mission Yan Guiyi had given him, but he would also be able to raise his own cultivation level!

He Teng was extremely ambitious. He had long been fed up with the stuck up attitudes of the aristocratic families!

However, he wasn’t like Qin Yu. Everything Qin Yu did wasn’t for him to be able to replace them. What he wanted was for everyone to be equal.

He Teng wanted to become an aristocrat, so he could be superior to the masses!
