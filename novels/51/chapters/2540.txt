Chapter 2541 Tablet’s Sensing

What was that?

Qin Yu was so shocked that the veins on his head could not help but throb.

Could it be that after going around in circles, this operation involved Saint Zi Yang again?

He felt a headache coming on. When he heard the peak master and the others talk about it, he still had some hope.

He had thought this was something that happened two Path of Heaven years ago and was too long since then. It should not have involved the matters of the Saint, and he did not expect it to come back again.

Since it involved the Saint, the danger of this matter would probably increase immensely. This also explained why the sect masters of the three sects had to ask Saint Su Xinghe to deduce despite the strength of Xuan Xin and others.

“Before our three sects split up, the Three Purities Sect was the strongest. It could even suppress the two great sacred sects.”

Since he had said it out loud, Xuan Tian might as well tell him the whole story.

Qin Yu’s mind stirred slightly. There were even legends and myths about the Three Purities on Earth.

It seemed to correspond to what Xuan Xin said. Could it be that there was a connection between the two?

Or were these three sects the inheritances of the Three Purities from the myth on Earth?

In the legends on Earth, the Three Purities in Taoism, namely the Upper Pure, Middle Pure, and Lower Pure, are three crucial deities within Taoism.

They represented the three levels of the universe and were the fundamental power of the universe.

Upper Pure was the highest level of purity, representing the supreme Dao. Middle Pure was the middle level of purity, representing the power between heaven and earth. Lower Pure was the lowest level of purity, representing the power of all living beings.

“Martial Uncle Zi Yang was one of the few people in the sect who had comprehended the foundation of the Three Purities. He was also the last light on the degenerated path of the Three Purities. However, he never expected to be unable to leave this place after carrying out a mission. Last month, at this time, when the two races fought, Martial Uncle Zi Yang’s life and death tablet in the sect moved slightly. It was the first response from Martial Uncle’s tablet in a long time, prompting immediate joint action from our three sects.”

Xuan Tian told him the whole story.

“The place of the sensing is in the depths of this forest. We’re heading there now.”

“Could it be the Heavenly Revered Supreme, Saint Zi Yang, is still alive?”

Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed. The danger would undoubtedly be reduced significantly if they had another Saint.

“Although Martial Uncle’s tablet didn’t shatter, the power of his soul is almost extinguished. Perhaps the suppression of the Misty Forest had been reduced during the war between the human race and the alien race, which is why Martial Uncle’s soul power could transmit to the sect’s tablet. This time, the Saint couldn’t act because their cosmic luck was too strong. Even the supreme treasures of heaven and earth couldn’t conceal their power. Therefore, only we, below the Saint, could act.”

Xuan Tian said with a bitter smile.

“Martial Uncle is the last light of the Three Purities Sect. The origin of the Dao he comprehended can even resist the power of heaven and earth. With Martial Uncle’s methods, he must have left something behind. If we can find his corpse and obtain his inheritance, then our three sects will definitely have a heaven-defying fortune. Therefore, even if it is tremendously dangerous, we must do our best to come to this place.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. This involved the inheritance of a Saint. No wonder the three sects invited him to go along even if they had to offer the most precious treasure, the Heavenly Soul Jade. It was all to increase their chances.

“Be careful! Zhang Xiang and Li Yang, change directions.”

Just as they were talking, Xuan Xin suddenly reminded everyone.

Xuan Xin, who was at the front, retreated. His face was slightly pale as if he had overused his spiritual energy.

Almost simultaneously, Zhang Xiang and Li Yang stared at him.

The two chanted an incantation at the same time. The same incantation seemed to be used by the Taoists to worship heaven and earth. Moreover, Qin Yu found the incantation somewhat similar to the sacrifice of the monster race.

The two cast their spells very quickly. Soon, the power of the Path of Heaven of Thunder penetrated this place and entered their hands. Immediately, their palms emitted a bright lightning glow.

“Junior Brother, draw the Seal of Thunder with me!”

The spellcasting took just an instant, and the talisman formed.

A pattern of lightning interweaved slowly formed. In an instant, a powerful bolt of lightning descended from the sky and connected with Zhang Xiang and Li Yang’s palms.

This bolt of lightning was like a flash of light, emitting tremendously powerful electromagnetic energy.

The terrifying dark storm seemed to be afraid of the power of thunder. It passed by both sides and did not hit them head-on.

“Junior Brothers, your Heavenly Talisman cultivation has become increasingly profound. The power of this attack has already reached the fifth level power of the Path of Heaven.”

Xuan Xin admired and acknowledged.

Qin Yu also nodded. He had once seen Chan Ye’s talisman attack in purgatory. However, compared to the Heavenly Talisman of the two from the Heavenly Divination Sect, the power of heaven and earth he triggered was much weaker.

Although Zhang Xiang was rather talkative, his strength was quite good. No wonder he was one of the people sent by the three sects.

Although they were still going deeper, Qin Yu’s expression started to turn grim at this moment.

The energy of the storm here was increasing exponentially.

At this moment, the sound of a vengeful spirit crying came from all directions.

The evil wind swept over, tearing apart everything and distorting life.

This terrifying storm carried a dark internal qi, mercilessly tearing apart everything it encountered, causing them to become distorted, incomplete, and even destroyed.

The evil power within was like a surging black tide that was daunting.

“Be careful ahead. I’ve detected at least three monster races at the fifth level; Titan King, King of Flame Spirit, Flame Demon, and the Death Godly King.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he immediately reminded them loudly.

He had fought with the three of them before, and the power of Evil Eye’s witchcraft had already left a mark on them. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Although there was a terrifying storm in the surroundings, and it was difficult for the divine sense to detect it, Qin Yu could still sense three people not far away.

They were probably waiting for an opportunity to give them a fatal blow.

Xuan Xin stared at Qin Yu in surprise. He seemed surprised that Qin Yu could sense it.

However, he soon discarded his doubts and prepared himself with the others.

“Whoosh!”

In front of the boundless dark vortex, they suddenly heard a sound like a candle blown out.

That voice was clearly transmitted into everyone’s ears amidst the massive storm.

Zhang Xiang and Li Yang’s Seal of Thunder was instantly cut off by a force in the void.

A shadow came knocking at them, and a pair of green pupils stared at them.

Qin Yu gasped. It was a twisted and entangled shadow.

One could occasionally see its twisted body, sharp claws, and fallen wings in the storm.

There were also countless pitch-black tentacles extending from its body.
