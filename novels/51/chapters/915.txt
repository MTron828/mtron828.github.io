Chapter 916: Chapter 916, the old immortal 

Looking at her flushed face, Qin Yu finally shook his head.

Seeing this, Yu Qin couldn’t force herself. She could only carry the medicine basket and leave.

Qin Yu sat quietly on a stone. Her eyes were slightly closed, and she breathed in and out gently.

After an unknown amount of time, Yu Qin came back from outside.

When she saw Qin Yu sitting on the rock, Yu Qin walked over and whispered, “Qin Yu, you haven’t rested yet.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I can’t sleep.”

Yu Qin continued, “Your injuries haven’t healed yet. You should rest more. I... I’ll go get some water for you to wash up.”

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Yu Qin. Just as he was about to refuse, he noticed that there seemed to be something unusual on Yu Qin’s face.

She dodged and dodged as if she was afraid of being seen by Qin Yu.

“What happened to your face?”Qin Yu asked.

Yu Qin covered her face and said hurriedly, “It’s... It’s nothing. I... I’ll go get you some water.”

After saying that, Yu Qin ran away in a hurry.

Not long after, Yu Qin ran back with the water in her hands.

She placed the water in front of Qin Yu and said, “You... you can wash up.”

It could be seen that Yu Qin was a capable, simple, and kind woman.

Living at the bottom, her simple character was indeed eye-catching.

Seeing how hard Yu Qin took care of him, Qin Yu also felt a little embarrassed.

He slowly stood up and placed his hand on Yu Qin’s face.

This action immediately made Yu Qin’s face flush red.

She whispered, “Qin Yu, you...”

Qin Yu did not explain. A bright light appeared on his hand. Strands of Qi/spiritual energy surged out of his palm and covered Yu Qin’s face.

Yu Qin only felt waves of warmth on her face. It was extremely comfortable.

After dozens of seconds, Qin Yu took his hand away.

Yu Qin subconsciously touched her face. She was surprised to find that the redness just now seemed to have disappeared.

“How... How did you do it?”Yu Qin could not help but widen her eyes.

Qin Yu did not explain. To Qin Yu, who was a half-step martial saint, this was a wound that could be easily treated.

However, to Yu Qin, who had some medical skills, this was simply a godlike technique.

“Qin Yu, you... you are too amazing!”A trace of excitement could not help but flash across Yu Qin’s face.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “This is nothing.”

Yu Qin wanted to say something else, but was interrupted by Qin Yu.

“You should go and rest early.”

After saying this, Qin Yu no longer paid any attention to Yu Qin.

He sat on this rock and thought about how to deal with the martial saint who was chasing after him.

Although Yu Qin wanted to speak to Qin Yu, she did not dare to speak rashly. She could only step aside carefully.

Qin Yu didn’t sleep the whole night.

After thinking about it, the safest way was to hide her face and avoid the sharp edge for the time being.

The next day, before dawn, Yu Qin got up early. She carried the medicine basket on her back and prepared to pick herbs.

When she saw Qin Yu sitting on the stone, Yu Qin said in surprise, “You... Why are you up so early?”

Qin Yu said casually, “Well, I can’t sleep. What About You?”

Yu Qin said, “I have to get up early to pick herbs.”

Hearing that, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown and say, “Do you have to pick herbs so early every day?”

“Yes, do you want to come with me?”Yu Qin asked tentatively.

Qin Yu thought for a moment. Since it was an experiential learning, he had to experience all the flavors of life.

Therefore, Qin Yu stood up and said, “Okay.”

After getting a positive answer, a trace of excitement flashed across Yu Qin’s face.

She hurriedly said, “How about... I make some food for you first. You Eat Something First.”

“No need. Let’s go.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

The two of them embarked on the journey to pick herbs.

The place where they picked herbs was precisely the mountain forest where Qin Yu fell.

This mountain forest was extremely large, and there were all kinds of strange things growing inside.

In this mountain forest, there were wild beasts appearing from time to time. Qin Yu could clearly hear the roars coming from the dark.

“Aren’t you afraid of encountering wild beasts when you come to pick herbs every day?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask in surprise.

Yu Qin said in a low voice, “I’m afraid, but my luck is better. I can usually escape.”

“Isn’t this too dangerous?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Yu Qin sighed and said, “I can’t do anything about it...”

“I don’t quite understand. Why do you have to pick herbs every day? are people in the village like this?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Yu Qin opened her mouth as if she wanted to say something, but in the end, she shook her head.

“If you have any difficulties, you can tell me. I might be able to help you,”Qin Yu said.

After all, Yu Qin had helped him before. He had to return this favor no matter what.

“There’s no need!”Yu Qin smiled and shook her head. “I can solve it myself.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t ask any further.

In the mountain forest, Yu Qin carefully picked herbs everywhere.

She seemed to be extremely sensitive to danger. As long as there were wild beasts around, Yu Qin would avoid them.

For the whole morning, Yu Qin picked a basket of herbs.

Although these herbs were ordinary, their medicinal effects were well preserved.

“I’m so tired.”Yu Qin sat on the ground and wiped the sweat off her forehead.

At this moment, Yu Qin’s stomach suddenly began to growl.

A hint of embarrassment flashed across Yu Qin’s face. She blushed and hurriedly turned her face to the side.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “Don’t you usually eat lunch?”

Yu Qin said, “I brought a pancake. Do you want to eat one?”

As she said that, Yu Qin took out a pancake from her mouth.

“This is what you want to eat?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Yu Qin smiled and said, “Anyway, I’ll just deal with some at noon.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “Wait for me here.”

“Where are you going?”Yu Qin quickly asked.

Qin Yu did not answer. He turned around and walked into the depths of the forest.

The sounds of birds and beasts could be heard in the forest. A few minutes later, Qin Yu came back with a wild boar.

When Yu Qin saw this, her eyes immediately widened.

“Where... where did the wild boar come from?”Yu Qin exclaimed.

Qin Yu said perfunctorily, “I picked it up by the roadside.”

After saying that, Qin Yu tore the wild boar apart with his bare hands.

This immediately made Yu Qin even more shocked!

“Qin Yu, you... are so strong...”Yu Qin said in surprise.

Qin Yu tore off a leg and then lit the spiritual fire in his hand.

The current Qin Yu’s control of the spiritual fire could be said to be perfect. In just a few minutes, a roasted wild boar leg was ready.

“Eat it.”Qin Yu handed the wild boar leg to Yu Qin.

Yu Qin swallowed her saliva. She grabbed the wild boar leg and wolfed it down.

“It smells so good.”Yu Qin seemed to be extremely hungry. A wild boar leg was eaten up in a short while.

After eating it, Yu Qin seemed to feel a little embarrassed.

She wiped her mouth and said somewhat embarrassedly, “Did I eat too fast?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said nothing.

“Qin Yu, you are really powerful. You are almost like the old immortals in our village,”Yu Qin muttered.

“Old Immortals?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yu Qin hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, the old immortals in our village are especially powerful! It is said that they can fly and burrow into the ground! They can tear apart wild beasts with their hands!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but say in a low voice, “It should be a cultivator.”

“What?”Yu Qin asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and continued, “Is he a native of your village?”

Yu Qin shook her head and said, “No. It is said that he became an old immortal a few years ago after receiving a reward from the heavens in our village.”

When Qin Yu heard this, his interest was immediately piqued.

The so-called reward from the heavens was naturally his nonsense.

However... For him to suddenly become a cultivator, he must have obtained some sort of babe in the village.

‘perhaps this old immortal can provide me with some sort of treasure,’Qin Yu thought to himself.
