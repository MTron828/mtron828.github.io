Chapter 233: Nine Transformation Golden Pill Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The reason why Dong Tianhai stayed in Chuzhou was because a Divine Medicine was about to be created in Bai City.

And this Divine Medicine lasted as long as a thousand years!

Even Dong Tianhai didn’t have this Divine Medicine in his possession!

But the appearance of this Divine Medicine would definitely cause a commotion!

Although not many people knew about it, the families of Chuzhou and even the entire Jiang Bei region might have received the news.

Helpless, Dong Tianhai thought of looking for someone to work with.

He originally wanted to look for Qin Yu, who was the King of Chuzhou. However, after seeing him today, Dong Tianhai dispelled this idea.

“Master, why don’t we look for the Martial Arts Association?” At this moment, his disciple suggested.

“Although there aren’t many experts in the Martial Arts Association of Chuzhou, there are still many Inner Strength Past Masters.”

“With their help, our chances of success will be higher.”

After hearing his disciple’s words, Dong Tianhai thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “This is the only way.”

In the Martial Arts Association, ever since Yuan Hong’s death, Yuan Hong’s eldest disciple had taken over as the new president.

This president’s name was Wan Xin, and he was Yuan Hong’s favorite disciple. The two of them had a very good relationship.

Ever since Yuan Hong’s death, Wan Xin’s mind had been filled with thoughts of revenge. However, he wasn’t strong enough, and he was afraid of the Yan family, so there was nothing he could do.

Wan Xin sat in his office. In front of him was the video of Yan Jiang torturing Yuan Hong that day.

“Qin Yu...” The more Wan Xin watched, the angrier he became!

He didn’t have the ability to take revenge on the Yan family, so he directed all his anger onto Qin Yu!

“President Wan, someone is looking for you outside.” At this moment, a subordinate walked in and said.

“Who?” Wan Xin frowned and said.

“Jiang Bei’s King of Medicine, Dong Tianhai,” the subordinate answered truthfully.

When he heard this name, Wan Xin immediately stood up!

“Quick, invite them in!” Wan Xin hurriedly said.

Soon, Dong Tianhai led his disciple into the office.

As for Wan Xin, he made tea and waited respectfully.

Upon seeing Dong Tianhai, Wan Xin quickly walked forward and said warmly, “I’ve heard of the King of Medicine’s achievements since long before. Seeing you in person today, I see that you are indeed extraordinary!”

“President Wan, you’re too polite,” Dong Tianhai said indifferently.

After sitting down, Wan Xin probed, “May I know what you are here for?”

His disciple opened his mouth and was about to speak, but was interrupted by Dong Tianhai with a wave of his hand.

He looked at Wan Xin and indifferently said, “President Wan, there’s something I want to ask you.”

“Medicine king, feel free to tell me! As long as I know, I’ll tell you everything!” Wan Xin patted his chest and said.

Dong Tianhai was silent for a moment and said, “I’m not from Chuzhou, so I don’t know much about Chuzhou.”

“Recently, there’s a young man in Chuzhou who has been in the limelight. His name is Qin Yu, and he’s known as the King of Chuzhou. Rumor has it that he beat Jiang Gu.”

“I wonder if this is true?”

When he heard Dong Tianhai’s words, Wan Xin’s expression instantly turned cold.

He gnashed his teeth and said, “Qin Yu is only at the seventh stage of the Inner Strength Master Hands realm. How could he possibly defeat Jiang Gu?”

“Oh really?” Dong Tianhai raised his eyebrows. “But rumor has it that Jiang Gu was defeated by Qin Yu.”

Wan Xin snorted and said, “Isn’t it because of the Yan family? If it weren’t for the Yan family, Qin Yu would have died long ago!”

“Are you serious?” Dong Tianhai frowned and said.

“If you don’t believe me, I have a video here!” Wan Xin hurriedly turned on his computer and opened the video.

The content was the video of Yan Jiang torturing Yuan Hong.

“This person is from the Yan family and is extremely powerful! If it weren’t for him, Qin Yu would have died long ago!” Wan Xin snorted coldly.

Dong Tianhai looked at the content of the video and couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

“Master, I’ve already said it before. Qin Yu only has an empty title!”

“That’s right. How can an Inner Strength Master Hands like him win against an Inner Strength Grandmaster? Just think about it and you will know that it is impossible.” The two disciples shouted. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wan Xin also said, “These two gentlemen are right. Qin Yu’s realm is low and it isn’t worth mentioning. It’s just that the Yan family wants to support him.”

“You also know that with the Yan family’s ability, even if it’s a pile of dog sh*t, they can still help him rise to the top.”

Dong Tianhai sighed and said in a low voice, “It seems that I have overestimated Qin Yu.”

In that case, they could only rely on the Martial Arts Association.

After that, Dong Tianhai expressed his intentionS.

“Divine Medicine? This is simply amazing!” Wan Xin said with ecstasy.

“Thank you, Mr. Dong, for giving us this opportunity!” Wan Xin said excitedly.

Dong Tianhai nodded and said, “Remember, don’t tell anyone about this. You must keep it a secret.”

Wan Xin patted his chest and said, “Don’t worry. Who doesn’t know that I, Wan Xin, keep my mouth shut?”

“In that case, organize the personnel in half a month,” Dong Tianhai said.

After giving his instructions, Dong Tianhai left with his disciple and returned to the winery.

...

On the other hand, Qin Yu returned home excitedly.

He didn’t dare to waste any time and immediately prepared to refine the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.

However, when he looked at the prescription carefully, his brows furrowed tightly.

“I was too excited just now. I actually didn’t look at the required herbs...” Qin Yu felt a headache coming on.

The herbs needed for the Nine Transformation Golden Pill were extremely rare. It required a ginseng that was more than a hundred years old, two Chinese knotweed that was a hundred and fifty years old, and a variety of weird commonplace herbs.

Qin Yu was unable to even get his hands on these herbs.

“I agreed too quickly.” Qin Yu sighed.

“However... the effect of this Nine Transformation Golden Pill is beyond imagination.” Qin Yu glanced at it and said in a low voice.

As the name implied, the Nine Transformation Golden Pill gave the user nine chances to remodel his body.

The first three times were to temper the body, and the next few times were to temper the internal organs and even the spiritual sense.

Even in the immortal cultivation world, the Nine Transformation Golden Pill was a high-quality medicinal pill, and its level was as high as the Earth Rank.

“If it weren’t for Dong Tianhai, I wouldn’t have known that there was such a miraculous medicinal pill,” Qin Yu said as he stroked his chin.

Even so, Qin Yu couldn’t do anything about the difficulty of acquiring the herbs.

“Oh, right!” At this moment, Qin Yu slapped his head.

Since Dong Tianhai was called the King of Herbs, these herbs would be easy for him to obtain!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly got up and rushed to Yihe Winery.

Yihe Winery was not only a restaurant, but also a hotel.

Qin Yu guessed that Dong Tianhai would stay here, so he came in a hurry.

When he arrived at the door, Dong Tianhai had just returned.

The two of them met at the door, which saved a lot of trouble.

Qin Yu walked up quickly and said politely, “Mr. Dong, there’s something I need to trouble you with. This Nine Transformation Golden Pill requires a hundred-year-old ginseng, a hundred and fifty-year-old Chinese knotweed, and many ordinary herbs.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took out a piece of paper and said with a smile, “I’ve written down all the herbs I need.”

Dong Tianhai took the list of herbs and took a look. Then, he sneered and said, “Are you sure this is the formula for the Nine Transformation Golden Pill?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded.

Dong Tianhai sneered and said, “If this is all the herbs needed for the Nine Transformation Golden Pill, it won’t be called the rarest medicinal pill!”
