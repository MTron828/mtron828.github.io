2304 Killing with One Sword Strike

“Why go through so much trouble? My iron fist can directly smash him into a meat pie,” Wu Shan said in a muffled voice.

He had to refine the Paramita Pill quickly. Xiao Yu’s vital signs were constantly disappearing, and he could no longer delay it.

Qin Yu returned to the mountain peak and started refining the Paramita Pill after the preparation.

The moment he took out the Paramita Flower, it attracted the attention of the man with the mustache and Mei Li.

The strange soul-suction force almost made people unable to shift their eyes away.

“What a weird flower!”

Mei Li stared at the Paramita Flower curiously.

At this moment, the Paramita Flowers had already begun to wither as if they needed to absorb the strange internal qi in the space to survive.

Thinking of the monster race he encountered earlier, Qin Yu suddenly wondered if these Paramita Flowers absorbed demonic qi.

Qin Yu suppressed the thoughts in his mind. He took out the alchemy furnace and began to refine the Paramita Pill.

As it was his first time refining this, Qin Yu failed the first and second times.

In the third attempt, Qin Yu finally managed to gauge the amount of ghost qi to add under the burning of the purple fire and the ghostly qi.

A purplish-black Pill finally took shape.

Almost the instant the pills took shape, a soul suction force was released from the core of the pill. The effect was a bit like Uncle Ling’s Soul Vortex.

Qin Yu refined another six Paramita Pills and stopped refining them after ensuring he had enough pills.

Qin Yu placed Xiao Yu on the ground from the Sumeru ring, then gently put the Paramita Pill into her mouth.

An hour later, Qin Yu felt a slight spatial fluctuation.

Countless tiny soul powders gathered from all directions. Under the pitch-black night sky, these soul powders looked like fireflies.

Some came from the void and slowly gathered into Xiao Yu’s body.

The soul on Xiao Yu’s body fluctuated, and Xiao Yu started to return to normal.

Qin Yu was overjoyed.

He must seize some Paramita Flowers if there was an opportunity. It might save his life at a critical moment!

Qin Yu thought to himself.

After a day and a night, the soul fragments no longer appeared.

Xiao Yu’s beautiful eyes moved and finally opened.

“Qin… Qin Yu? I… I think I had a very long dream.”

Xiao Yu asked in confusion. Her face was ashen as if she had just recovered from a severe illness.

“Xiao Yu, don’t talk. Have a good sleep first.”

Qin Yu sent Xiao Yu into the Sumeru Space. The space was full of spiritual energy, so she should recover faster.

Suddenly, a violent fluctuation attracted Qin Yu’s attention.

“There seems to be a fight over there.”

Mei Li looked toward another mountain peak.

Qin Yu frowned. That mountain peak was where Xi Menn was.

With Xi Menn’s strength, people still dared to challenge him!

Xi Menn sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, and those people who wanted to conquer the mountain peak were the three people who stopped Qin Yu just now.

A deep sword scar on the ground blocked the three people. The bottomless sword scar seemed to tell them that this place was inviolable.

“The three worthless persons again.”

Qin Yu felt a burst of annoyance.

“There’s a good show to watch. I think Xi Menn will win. What do you think?”

Mei Li stood up and said with interest. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s hard to say. That Wu Shan has a holy body. His defense is too terrifying. It’s very difficult for Xi Menn’s sword to kill him in one strike. Xi Menn would definitely win if it were one-on-one, but I don’t think these three people will go on one-on-one.”

Qin Yu shook his head. That Ying Zi’s figure was tremendously weird. He did not know what cultivation technique Ying Zi cultivated, but he concealed his internal to the extreme.

When they got close to him just now, Qin Yu did not notice them. The two were restraining Xi Menn.

Xing Mou shouted.

However, his clamor was completely ignored by the white-robed man. Xi Menn sat there without moving at all.

The three stopped before the sword scar and saw Xi Menn not moving.

“Xing Mou, you attack first,” Ying Zi snorted coldly and said.

“No!” Xing Mou was shocked. “This guy’s sword is too fast. I’m afraid I’ll be killed by him straightaway!”

“You’re really trash!”

Wu Shan snorted coldly, and his body rushed toward Xi Menn.

The terrifying massive force under his feet actually made the mountain peak tremble. Behind him, a giant phantom slowly appeared.

Countless chains of the way linked the two of them together. At this moment, the energy of another giant in the void was transmitted to Wu Shan.

A layer of white light enveloped his body.

“Stomp!”

Wu Shan suddenly stomped his feet, and the ground instantly collapsed. Countless cracks spread out in all directions from the place where he stood.

After that, he leaped high up into the air and shot toward Xi Menn like an arrow.

A punch landed ruthlessly.

A world-destroying aura instantly exploded. Even Qin Yu, who was extremely far away, was affected by the fluctuation. The mountain peak trembled slightly.

When the fist landed, Xi Menn finally opened his eyes.

His sword gently met Wu Shan’s fist.

A similarly bright sword light appeared. In a flash, the two had already crossed paths.

Xi Menn’s face was a little pale. He gently sheathed his sword.

A thin line of blood appeared on Wu Shan’s fist.

The sword light suddenly exploded and released a terrifying sword intent again.

It directly cut nearly three-quarters of Wu Shan’s body into two.

“How terrifying! If it weren’t for Wu Shan’s powerful body, his body would have been split into two by this sword.”

Qin Yu gasped. Xi Menn’s sword energy was extremely pure Way of the Sword. It cut through everything in one strike.

This destructive power far exceeded that of ordinary cultivators.

Even Situ Haoyue and the others’ attacks with all their might were no match for Xi Menn’s sword.

Ying Zi’s face was full of shock, but his movements did not slow down in the slightest.

Almost concurrently, he disappeared into the void and appeared behind Xi Menn.

His dagger stabbed at Xi Menn with a suffocating sharp edge. The dagger flickered with spatial qi and could cut through almost everything.

“Hmph!”

Qin Yu stepped on the line word formula. With a move of his Gale Resistance Boot, countless wind forces wrapped around his body, and his body instantly disappeared before Mei Li.

His speed was so fast that even Mei Li could not capture him with her divine sense.

In less than a breath, he arrived above Ying Zi.

“Cosmic form.”

The massive palm covered a radius of 1,000 meters and slapped downward.

In an instant, Ying Zi’s body was slapped onto the ground like a fly, and half of its body almost shattered.

“Just this? And you want to kill me after killing him?”

Qin Yu landed on the ground and spat at him.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. This fellow actually looked down on him just now. He thus spat at him a few more times.

“Thanks.”

Xi Menn nodded and returned to the mountain peak, sitting cross-legged.

This character somewhat resembled Xiao Sheng. Qin Yu suddenly felt this person a little cute.
