Qin Yu didn’t know how to explain it, but he could clearly feel that Qiu Feng had a murderous intent towards him.

“Alright, you might have been too paranoid recently. Don’t worry too much.” Wei Jiang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything.

Then, Qin Yu continued to choose raw stones in the venue.

However, after a few rounds, Qin Yu didn’t find any stones that were worth buying, so he walked to the side.

Stone gambling was only a part of this venue. The venue didn’t lack high-value rare herbs.

Qin Yu looked around and saw several herbs that had medicinal effects that could last several decades.

Unfortunately, these herbs were ridiculously expensive. Any one of them would cost tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions.

“How ridiculous.” Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel speechless.

No wonder the disciples of the prominent families were much more powerful than ordinary people.

The prominent families had sufficient resources, so they progressed very quickly.

And if they were powerful enough, they could earn even more money.

This was a vicious cycle.

“The poor can only depend on mutation to strike it rich. This isn’t just a saying.” Qin Yu forced a smile.

In a short while, Qin Yu spent almost all his money.

He was carrying four to five herbs dozens of years old in his hands, and he was penniless.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, he suddenly felt an extremely dense dark energy.

The moment this dark energy burst out, Qin Yu looked over.

Besides Qin Yu, Qiu Feng, who was a short distance away, also looked over at almost the same time.

Their eyes met.

A sharp gleam burst out from his eyes at the same time!

There was definitely something off with Qiu Feng!

Qin Yu strode towards the stall, where a stone statue was placed in front.

The dense dark energy came from the stone statue.

Qin Yu pointed at the stone statue and said, “Sir, how much is this?”

The owner didn’t even raise his head and said, “200 million, and no bargaining.”

“Sir, isn’t this price a little too high?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

If the stone statue was surrounded by spiritual energy, this price could still be understood.

If it was dark energy, the audience range would be very small.

Ordinary people avoided dark energy like the plague, so why would they pay a high price to buy it? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“It’s up to you whether you want it or not. This is my family’s heirloom. If it weren’t for an incident happening, I wouldn’t sell it no matter how much you offered,” the owner snickered.

“If you don’t have money, don’t blame other people for selling it at a high price.”

At this moment, Qiu Feng walked over from the side.

He stood beside Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Sir, I’ll pay 200 million.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the owner and said in a somber voice, “Sir, give me an hour. I’ll go get the money.”

“I don’t have time to wait for you!” The owner waved his hand without hesitation.

He looked at Qiu Feng and said, “After you pay the money, this thing will be yours.”

“No problem.” Qiu Feng smiled nonchalantly. He flipped his palm and a bank card fell into his hand.

Qin Yu hurriedly said, “I can pay 250 million. Keep this thing for me.”

No one could resist the temptation of money, and this owner was no exception.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, he hurriedly withdrew his hand that he was about to pass to Qiu Feng.

“Is what you said true?” The owner’s eyes lit up and he said with some anticipation.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Absolutely true.”

The owner had an idea and said, “I’ll only give you one hour. If you can’t get the money in an hour, I’ll sell this thing to this old man.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

Qiu Feng’s expression was cold. He looked at Qin Yu icily and said, “This thing doesn’t seem to be of any benefit to you. It’s useless even if you want it.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered. “You’re quite shady. Tell me, who are you?”

Qiu Feng said coldly, “It doesn’t matter who I’m, but I’m warning you. If you ruin my big plan, I won’t let you off the hook!”

“Really? Then I’ll wait and see,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned his head and walked toward Wei Jiang and Wei Ming.

“The two of you, lend me some money. I’ll return it to you in a few days.” Qin Yu said with some difficulty.

“How much do you need?” Wei Ming asked.

Qin Yu stretched out three fingers and said, “300 million.”

Hearing this number, Wei Ming couldn’t help but stick out his tongue. Wei Jiang, who was beside him, also shook his head.

“Mr. Qin, do you think we’re all the same as you? 300 million is an astronomical figure.” Wei Ming rolled his eyes and said.

Wei Jiang nodded and said, “Even with all my savings added together, I don’t have three hundred million.”

This made Qin Yu a little embarrassed.

Qin Yu didn’t know when it started, but it seemed that he had no concept of money.

“Hehe, since you can’t get the money, the thing is mine.” Qiu Feng walked up from behind.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said indifferently, “This small amount of money can’t stop me.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked straight to the center of the venue.

He scanned his surroundings and suddenly shouted, “From now on, I will sell my medical skills. As long as you give enough money, I will treat you three times. This time, there is no limit on time or place.”

His sonorous voice reached everyone’s ears.

There was immediately an uproar. Many people gathered around him.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground while quietly waiting for patients to come to him.

“Isn’t this Qin Yu? I heard that he’s the president of the Chinese Medicine Association.”

“That’s right, rumor has it that his medical skills are above Zhou Tong’s!”

“Last time, he refined a Nine Dragon Pill that can cure all diseases!”

With Qin Yu’s title as the President of the Chinese Medicine Association, everyone gathered around.

“Mr. Qin, can you help treat me? I’ve been feeling very weak recently and it has been going on for many years,” someone asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Of course, as long as you are willing to pay.”

“Mr. Qin, my old mother has a cerebral infarction and has been lying in bed for several years. Please accompany me to see her.”

“Mr. Qin, I’m willing to pay for your Nine Dragon Pill. You can name the price.”

“Doctor Qin...”

Everyone’s enthusiasm continued to soar. To these rich people, their lives were more important than money.

Getting Qin Yu to treat them three times was equivalent to having three more lives guaranteed.

“Although Qin Yu’s medical skills are good, he has offended the Jiang family. How long do you think he can live? As if he has the chance to make house calls for you guys?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.

The person who spoke was Qiu Feng.
