Chapter 2043: Kill Qin Yu First

Elder Shi raised his hand and shattered half of his body, causing blood to spurt out instantly.

Seeing Elder Shi’s decisiveness, the surrounding people’s expressions changed drastically, and they were shocked.

“What exactly happened…”

“Even Yan Guyun and the others have suffered such severe injuries. What… What exactly is in this Chaos Grave?”

!!

The expressions of Yan Guyun and the others were tremendously solemn. The face of each of them was filthy with grime, unlike aristocratic families!

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly furrowed. He looked at the man with the mustache but realized his expression was solemn too.

“What happened?” Si Shiyue stood up, walked up to Si Liuhe, and asked.

“We’ve underestimated the Chaos Grave,” Si Liuhe said in a deep voice. “Guardian living being have been born in the depths of the Chaos Grave for a long time. We can’t deal with them!”

“Guardian living being?” Si Shiyue also frowned.

To the Immortal Emperor, even a stone beside him could develop intelligence under the influence of a dao technique!

As for a guardian living being that was formed from pure dao technique, it was unimaginable how terrifying its strength was!

“We can’t move this Chaos Grave at all. I’m afraid we’ll have to bring a tribulation magical artifact or even an Emperor Weapon.” Si Liuhe took a deep breath.

“Even my blood is useless?” asked Si Shiyue in a deep voice.

Si Liuhe glanced at him and said, “Guardian living beings are born to protect the corpses of the chaotic bodies. Your blood is useless.

“In other words, we can only retreat for the time being.”

Everyone looked at each other in shock. Their eyes filled with fear as they looked at the Chaos Grave.

Similarly, Yan Guyun and the others gathered together and discussed something in low voices.

“Let’s leave for now. I’m afraid we’ll need the nine great aristocratic families to work together to excavate this Chaos Grave,” Yan Guyun said coldly.

Si Liuhe frowned and said, “If we leave, I’m afraid numerous people will come here.”

“So we have to make a foolproof plan. We can’t let anyone get close,” Yan Guyun said coldly.

They were naturally not afraid of ordinary cultivators. After all, even if they wanted to get close to the Chaos Grave, the outcome would be death.

However, no one could guarantee other hidden experts would not take action.

If this news spread, experts from outer regions might descend.

“Remove the formation and leave this place,” Jiang He said quietly.

Si Liuhe glanced at him and sneered, “Of course, I have to remove the formation. But before that, I have one more thing to do.”

Si Liuhe leaped into the air and landed above the crowd.

He looked down at everyone like a god, incomparably arrogant. He was no longer as miserable as just now.

Everyone’s attention was drawn to Si Liuhe.

They raised their heads, looking up at Si Liuhe, and frowned.

“What is he trying to do? Does he want us to die?”

“Impossible! Even they can’t enter the Chaos Grave. It’s useless even if we go.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Si Liuhe glanced at the crowd and said indifferently, “I’m afraid I’ll have to put the matter of the Chaos Graves on hold for the time being. However, before I remove the formation, I must find someone first.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed slightly, and he had a bad feeling in her heart.

“Qin Yu, I know you’re here,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

Everyone below was stunned!

Si Liuhe was looking for Qin Yu? Could it be that he wanted to kill Qin Yu here?

Even Si Shiyue was startled. He hurried to Si Liuhe’s side and whispered,

“Master, what…what are you doing? Haven’t I already made my choice?”

Si Liuhe glanced at Si Shiyue and said, “I’m very happy that you have made the right choice, but Qin Yu must die. This is your father’s order.”

Si Liuhe then ignored the others. He glanced at them and said coldly, “Qin Yu, come out. You killed an elder of the Si family and have gone against the Si family many times. No one can save you today.”

Qin Yu’s expression was tremendously ugly, and fear was even in his heart!

In front of Si Liuhe, Qin Yu absolutely had no power to fight back!

“Don’t ever admit it,” the man with the mustache said from the side at this moment.

“There are so many people here. If he wants to find you, I’m afraid it will take some time.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “If it’s possible, it’s best you bring me to your formation.’

The man with the mustache did not say anything. He still looked extremely solemn.

“If you don’t come out, I’ll kill everyone here. I’d rather kill a thousand innocent people than let you go,” Si Liuhe said coldly at this moment.

The moment he said this, the people below immediately panicked!

Facing Si Liuhe’s threat, they did not blame him. Instead, they blamed everything on Qin Yu!

“Is this Qin Yu trying to kill us?”

“Qin Yu, if you’re here, come out quickly. Don’t implicate us!” “Be responsible for what you did. We don’t want to be buried with you!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, not knowing what to do for a moment.

At this rate, Si Liuhe would definitely find him!

“Everyone, take off your magical artifact. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude.” Si Liuhe ordered again.

...

Hearing this, everyone hurriedly took off the magical artifacts that covered their internal qi and revealed their original appearance.

Qin Yu’s expression was incomparably ugly. He knew that if this continued, there was no way to escape!

Just as Qin Yu was about to step forward, Jiang He suddenly bowed and said, “Senior Liuhe, the internal qi in the Chaos Grave is extremely unstable. Now is not the time to attack Qin Yu. Otherwise, I’m afraid we’ll attract a huge disaster.”

However, Si Liuhe only gave Jiang He a cold glance and said, “Jiang He, I know your background, so you don’t have to say anything. I also advise you not to cause trouble for yourself.”

Jiang He was silent, but he had no intention of retreating.

Si Liuhe’s expression turned cold, and he was extremely displeased.

“D*mn it!” Qin Yu cursed secretly and took a step forward, planning to face Si Liuhe!

“Senior! Jiang He is right. The internal qi in the Chaos Grave will erupt soon. If we don’t leave now, it will be too late!” The man with the mustache suddenly stood up!

He looked nervous and shouted anxiously, “The internal qi of the Chaos Grave will continue to spread until it reaches the entire Tai Chi Diagram! If we don’t leave now, we can no longer leave!”

Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache man in a loss. For a moment, he could not figure out if what the man with the mustache said was true or if it was just to help him escape.

Si Liuhe glanced at the man with the mustache, sneered, and said, “You’re deluding the public with lies.. Could it be that you’re Qin Yu?”
