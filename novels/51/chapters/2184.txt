2185 Wu Ji’s Dao Technique

The tremendous internal qi was constantly surging from his body, and that invincible battle intent was bursting out non-stop!

Qin Yu’s eyes were full of vigor. He no longer dodged. Instead, he clenched his Golden Fist and charged forward Wu Ji!

At this moment, Qin Yu was no longer afraid of Wu Ji. Instead, he treated him as a respectable opponent and fought with all his might!

Wu Ji’s gaze remained cold, and his body emanated a terrifying battle intent!

He resembled the real and revived Wu Ji as if reliving a terrifying battle!

And Qin Yu was his only opponent!

Both parties’ physical bodies clashed with all their might. Each time, an incredibly terrifying sound would burst out, shattering everything!

Their figures shuttled swiftly on the battlefield, and every clash released destructive energy. The ground collapsed under their feet, and the clouds in the sky shattered into pieces.

The energy fluctuations distorted the surroundings, and time seemed to be distorted and become unpredictable. The hurricane on the battlefield intensified, with lightning continuously interweaving in the sky, creating a terrifying and spectacular scene.

Qin Yu’s body was covered in blood, but he was unafraid. Instead, his battle intent grew even more intense. His power surged endlessly, and there seemed to be endless energy flowing in his body!

His physical body collapsed repeatedly and then reassembled. Each time he reassembled, his internal qi would weaken!

Qin Yu did not use anyone else’s technique. He could have used the secret technique Yan Ruoxue had imparted to him, but he did not. He chose to use his physical body’s ultimate strength!

This great battle had caused the world to turn dark, destroying all the way, and even time seemed to have become stagnant!

However, Wu Ji’s power was beyond imagination. He represented an era, the most formidable chaotic body in history!

No matter how Qin Yu unleashed his physical body to the extreme, he failed to shake Wu Ji’s tall figure!

He was like a big mountain blocking Qin Yu’s way. A raise of his hand contained thousands of dao techniques!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, Wu Ji raised his palm and gently pressed in Qin Yu’s direction.

In an instant, endless dao techniques took shape in his palm. It was a power Qin Yu had never seen before. It was as if a new world had been formed!

“Is this the dao technique created by Wu Ji?” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He raised his head and roared angrily, and his internal qi erupted to the limit. He gathered all the power in his fists to face the palm!

“Boom!”

A terrifying explosion spread, but in less than half a breath, everything of Qin Yu dissolved, and nothing existed anymore!

“What?!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu was shocked. Before he came back to his senses, his body shattered again, and fresh blood flowed out like a fountain!

Qin Yu’s body completely collapsed under that attack, turning into countless fragments. Blood gushed out, creating a tragic scene.

His limbs were broken, his bones and tendons were separated, and his internal organs were torn apart and scattered on the ground. His face filled with pain and despair. His eyes lost their luster and revealed endless helplessness and sorrow.

Flesh fragments and blood covered the battlefield, forming a terrifying scene. Wu Ji’s power completely crushed Qin Yu’s resistance, causing him to fall into a state of destruction.

The surrounding energy fluctuations and airwaves pushed Qin Yu’s remains into the distance. The remaining pieces of flesh trembled in pain!

His physical body was reforming in the distance. If Wu Ji attacked at this time, Qin Yu would have no chance at all!

However, Wu Ji was disdainful. He just looked at Qin Yu coldly without emotional fluctuations in his eyes.

After some time, Qin Yu reassembled his physical body again. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Each time it reassembled, it brought tremendous consumption to Qin Yu.

With his body covered in blood, Qin Yu looked at Wu Ji, and he was even more shocked deep down.

“Senior Wu Ji, you are indeed worthy of being regarded as a tribulation great cultivator no weaker than an Immortal Emperor…” Qin Yu opened his mouth, and blood gushed out.

He looked at the flawless figure before him, and his mind spun rapidly. Every clash just now flashed past Qin Yu’s mind!

Qin Yu recalled every detail of this battle, trying to find a flaw.

Wu Ji just looked at Qin Yu quietly. There was neither sadness nor joy in his eyes, and he did not have the slightest intention of attacking.

This was formidable confidence! He did not bother to take advantage of others when they were in danger!

Qin Yu sat cross-legged. The true essence that had flowed out of his body was slowly recovering, and images kept flashing through his mind.

Qin Yu closed his eyes and pondered. He recalled every clash and every confrontation with Wu Ji, and every detail quickly flashed in his mind.

His state of mind gradually calmed down. He began to sense the flow of energy on the battlefield and the subtle changes in space.

The sky crackled with lightning and echoed with thunder as if expressing its dissatisfaction toward Wu Ji. However, Wu Ji, as lofty as the heavens, paid no heed to such expression.

He just looked at Qin Yu quietly without any change in his expression.

Qin Yu recalled every detail. Each time he clashed with Wu Ji, he did not gain any advantage. Each time he attacked, he failed to cause any harm to Wu Ji.

This was completely illogical. Although Wu Ji was powerful, he could not be unscathed in the same realm!

After all, Qin Yu was not an ordinary Semi-Saint. He was a chaotic body that had comprehended dao techniques!

“No!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes as if he had realized something!

Wu Ji seemed to be independent of dao techniques. He was in the dao techniques he created himself!

Qin Yu stood up and looked around. After that, he tried to capture the dao technique.

As expected, this place was like an independent territory that Qin Yu had never touched!

Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with a hint of excitement. He could feel the immense power of the dao technique contained within this territory.

He began to fuse into this territory gradually, resonating with the techniques within. His body trembled, and limitless power surged around him.

Qin Yu began to comprehend these unique dao techniques. He comprehended their profundity and essence within and could sense the patterns and principles of the dao techniques Wu Ji was wielding.

He began to try using this technique. Path inscriptions appeared on his body, containing limitless power. His fists and footsteps became precise and powerful, and each attack contained the power of the dao technique.

Qin Yu once again faced Wu Ji. This time, his body emitted a completely different internal qi than earlier. His attacks became sharp and accurate. Every punch and kick filled with the power to destroy everything!

Unfortunately, with the support of this dao technique, Qin Yu was still not Wu Ji’s match. He was mercilessly crushed again, his body collapsed, and reassembled again!

Once, twice, thrice!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already challenged him countless times, but the results were the same. Wu Ji was like an insurmountable mountain, standing there and blocking everything.
