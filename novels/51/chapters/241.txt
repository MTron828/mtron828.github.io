Chapter 242: I’ll Kill All of You Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Duan Shi’s body was extremely large, and his punches were extremely fierce!

The sharp wind was like numerous sharp blades cutting into one’s skin until it hurt!

Faced with such a powerful attack, Qin Yu didn’t dodge, and raised his hand to meet it head-on!

“Clang!” A loud sound rang out!

After the two fists collided, a shocking scene appeared!

Qin Yu’s entire body was like a kite with a broken string, and it instantly flew out!

He spat out a mouthful of blood! In an instant, he became extremely weak! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Mr. Qin!” When he saw this, Jiang Gu hurriedly ran over!

He supported Qin Yu and said anxiously, “Mr. Qin, are you alright?”

Qin Yu didn’t panic in the slightest bit, and there was even a smile that was difficult to notice.

“What? This is all the King of Chuzhou has? You really make people laugh their heads off,” Duan Shi sneered.

Jing Lu shook his head.

It seemed that this King of Chuzhou wasn’t some kind of top-notch martial artist.

The King of Chuzhou couldn’t even take a punch from Duan Shi!

He was too weak!

At this moment, the surrounding spectators couldn’t help but feel speechless.

They didn’t expect Qin Yu to be defeated so miserably!

“Master, Qin Yu is indeed a good-for-nothing. He can’t even withstand a punch from Duan Shi.” Not far away, Dong Tianhai’s disciple sneered.

Dong Tianhai nodded and said, “There’s no other choice. In this era, the status of martial artists isn’t high. In front of wealth, they are nothing.”

The power of wealth far surpassed these so-called martial artists.

Other than Dong Tianhai, Chen Meng and Zhang Hua also saw this scene.

“Haha, this is the top-notch master that Jiang Gu kept praising?” Zhang Hua sneered.

“I can crush a piece of trash like him to death with one finger!”

In the face of everyone’s snubs, Qin Yu didn’t say a word.

He stood up and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and the smile at the corner of his mouth deepened.

With Qin Yu’s current strength, Duan Shi’s punch wasn’t even worth mentioning!

And the reason Qin Yu was sent flying was because he had allowed it on purpose.

Qin Yu had many enemies in the dark, and there were countless people who wanted to crush Qin Yu.

If he revealed his strength too early, he would very likely become the target.

“Mr. Qin, are you alright?” Jiang Gu said somewhat anxiously.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said with a smile, “I’m fine.”

At this moment, Fang Yue suddenly walked over with graceful steps.

Her voice was sweet and pleasant. She whispered in Qin Yu’s ear, “Mr. Qin, are you okay?”

Qin Yu said politely, “Miss Fang, I’m fine. I’m just a little weak from the injury.”

Fang Yue covered her mouth and smiled. She suddenly raised her hand and placed it on Qin Yu’s chest.

Waves of warm energy surged into Qin Yu’s body.

After feeling this warmth, Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed!

This feeling was too familiar to Qin Yu!

What Fang Yue released was precisely the spiritual energy that Qin Yu relied on!

“As expected, I’m not the only immortal cultivator in the world,” Qin Yu thought with narrowed eyes.

“Of course,” Fang Yue said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu’s expression changed again!

Fang Yue could actually hear his inner thoughts? How did she do it?

“Mr. Qin, don’t worry. This is the power of spiritual sense. In the secular world, it’s called spiritual power,” Fang Yue took the initiative to reply again.

This made Qin Yu feel a little uneasy.

If that was the case, Fang Yue would probably easily see through him!

“Thank you, Miss Fang, for treating my injuries. I’ve already recovered.” Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately wanted to stay far away from Fang Yue.

However, things didn’t go as he wished. Not only did Fang Yue not leave, but she even smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, why don’t we travel together?”

Travel together?

Qin Yu’s expression gradually darkened.

He looked coldly at Fang Yue and a hint of vigilance flashed in his eyes.

“Mr. Qin, there’s no need to worry,” Fang Yue said with a nonchalant smile.

“I just feel that you aren’t as simple as you seem,” Fang Yue said nonchalantly.

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

After thinking for a moment, he said, “Whatever.”

Since Fang Yue had already determined that he wasn’t ordinary, there was no need to argue with her.

Fang Yue covered her mouth and laughed softly without saying anything more.

From time to time, loud booms came from deep in the mountains.

This was the sign of the imminent birth of the Divine Medicine.

“Rumor has it that after the birth of the Divine Medicine, a shocking phenomena will be triggered, and an isolation with the surrounding world will be formed. I don’t know if it is true or false,” Jiang Gu said in a sullen voice.

Fang Yue nodded and said, “That’s right. Under the irrigation of the sun and moon for a thousand years, the Divine Medicine has long developed a spiritual sense. When it is born, it will think of ways to protect itself.”

“It’s that powerful?” Qin Yu was a little surprised.

Fang Yue glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Mr. Qin, didn’t you hear old people mention it when you were young? The wild ginseng on the mountain can escape on their own.”

“There is indeed such a legend, but no one has ever seen it,” Jiang Gu said.

Qin Yu scratched his head. He really didn’t know anything about this.

Qin Yu, who had been an orphan since he was young, had never heard any old people talk about such nonsense.

“When that time comes, Mr. Qin, you have to think of a way to protect yourself. According to my observation, there are many people who want to kill you here,” Fang Yue suddenly reminded him.

“There are many people?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He looked around and found that he didn’t have many enemies. There were only a few of them.

“Once a person reaches a high place, it will be easy to attract enmity. After you were sent flying by Duan Shi’s punch, there will naturally be people who want to step on you to get to the top,” Fang Yue said.

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization.

So that was the case.

However, he wasn’t worried. Instead, he was looking forward to it.

As long as he stepped into this isolated area, it wasn’t certain who would end up killing who.

Time flew by, and the time for the Divine Medicine to be born was getting closer and closer.

The booming sounds also became more frequent.

Many people were looking at the entrance of the Deep Mountain and preparing to enter.

Qin Yu was no exception. He took a step forward and stood near the deep mountain.

“Qin Yu, you really dared to come.” Zhang Hua glanced at Qin Yu coldly and said.

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “Why wouldn’t I dare to come?”

Zhang Hua narrowed his eyes and said, “You are the bravest person I have ever seen. Let me tell you the truth. As soon as you step into this deep forest, I will definitely kill you with my own hands!”

“That depends on whether you have the ability or not.” Qin Yu said nonchalantly.

Zhang Hua laughed and said, “How dare a mere Inner Strength Master Hands say such arrogant words?! I will kill you like stepping on an ant!”

“Really? Then I will wait and see.” Qin Yu sneered.

As he spoke, Qin Yu looked around.

As expected, he found that many people were secretly eying him.

“I will kill all of you later.” Qin Yu coldly thought to himself.

Just when everyone was feeling nervous, a series of explosions suddenly came from the sky!

This series of explosions quickly attracted countless gazes!

A helicopter steadily landed in front of everyone!

The huge propeller set off a series of cyclones.

The cyclones swept up the dust and temporarily obscured their vision.

The luxury cars at the scene paled in comparison to this helicopter.
