Chapter 374: Pavilion Master’s Pill Refinement! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was unknown whether it was because the difference in strength was too great, or Qiao Wu was caught off guard.

But these two punches caused Qiao Wu’s face to be covered in blood and his bones to be completely broken.

“If you dare to speak any more nonsense, I will kill you,” the Law Enforcement Elder said coldly.

Although Qiao Wu was unhappy inside, under such circumstances, he didn’t dare to say anything at all.

Qin Yu was brought away by Law Enforcement Elder, while the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion personally walked up to Old Mister Yan.

“Old Mister Yan.” The Pavilion Master bowed, as a form of greeting.

Old Mister Yan also politely replied, “The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion really lives up to her reputation.”

“Old Mister Yan, you’d better hurry and leave with us.” The Law Enforcement Elder at the side said.

Old Mister Yan nodded and said apologetically, “I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you all for the next few days.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything. She waved her hand and left together.

“How should we report to Mr. Yan now?” Qiao Wu’s expression was a little ugly.

He was very clear that with Yan Sihai’s character, if the mission wasn’t completed, he would definitely get punished.

“Alright, let’s tell Mr. Yan about the situation here first,” someone beside him said.

Qiao Wu sighed and said, “This is the only way.”

...

Qin Yu was brought to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Taozi, Yao Qing, and the others quickly surrounded him.

“Pavilion Master, is Mr. Qin... alright?” Yao Qing’s face was deathly pale from fear!

He had never seen Qin Yu suffer such a serious injury!

The Divine Alchemist Pavilion Master didn’t say anything. She raised her smooth and fair hand and placed it on Qin Yu’s chest.

A moment later, she turned her head to look at the Fifth Elder and said, “Go to the warehouse and fetch the herbs for me.”

With that, the Pavilion Master waved her hand and left the names of several herbs on the paper as well as the required age.

The Fifth Elder didn’t dare to waste any time. He quickly turned around and ran to the warehouse.

About ten minutes later, the Fifth Elder returned to the Elders’ Residence with the herbs.

“Pavilion Master, here are the herbs you requested,” the Fifth Elder said respectfully.

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything. A cauldron with a phoenix carved on it landed in front of everyone.

The moment the cauldron appeared, everyone felt a strange internal qi!

This internal qi seemed to come from ancient times, and people had the urge to worship it!

“The Pavilion Master... is going to refine the pill personally?” Someone realized.

“Really? the Pavilion Master is going to refine the pill personally?”

Everyone immediately buzzed with commotion!

The people from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion immediately came to the entrance of the Elders’ Residence to see the scene of the Pavilion Master refining the pill personally!

The Pavilion Master threw all kinds of herbs into the pill furnace. Then, she flipped her palm and a purple flame landed in her palm!

“Purple spiritual fire! It’s a purple spiritual fire!”

“Everyone says that the Pavilion Master has a purple spiritual fire. It’s really true!”

“I didn’t expect to see the Pavilion Master personally refine pills in my lifetime!”

Almost everyone was shocked by the alluring ball of flame in the Pavilion Master’s palm!

One had to know that the purple flame was the most sacred flame among all the spiritual flames!

Even the experienced Elders had never seen it before!

“Quiet down. Don’t disturb the Pavilion Master,” the Law Enforcement Elder said coldly.

Everyone immediately quieted down, but the infatuation in their eyes was difficult to hide.

The Pavilion Master gently raised her palm, and the flame fell into the pill furnace.

The pill furnace instantly lit up with a raging flame!

The purple light reflected in everyone’s eyes!

The Pavilion Master quietly looked at this ball of flame, and not a single trace of emotion could be seen in her eyes.

At this moment, the Pavilion Master’s mind moved, and a pill furnace carved with a divine dragon once again landed in front of everyone!

Following that, the Pavilion Master waved her palm, and threw the remaining herbs into the second cauldron of pill furnace!

The same purple flame lit up in her left hand!

Hiss...

The crowd gasped! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“The Pavilion Master... is trying to refine two different kinds of pills at the same time?” Someone whispered.

“This... This is too unbelievable...”

“It’s extremely difficult to control the spiritual flame, but the Pavilion Master can actually do both things at the same time?”

Just as everyone said, it was almost impossible to refine two cauldrons of pills at the same time!

This was because one had to be fully focused when refining pills. The slightest carelessness would cause the medicinal pills to be burned and destroyed!

And not only did the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion control two balls of spiritual fire at the same time, but she didn’t seem to feel the slightest bit of pressure!

What kind of superb alchemy skills were this?! And what kind of state of mind was this?!

The flames burned wildly within the pill furnace. In merely half an hour or so, the Danyun Phenomenon condensed in the sky.

“Clutter!”

In the next second, pill after pill that looked like exploding beans gushed out from the pill furnace!

The Pavilion Master waved her hand lightly, and all the pills fell into her palm.

At a glance, there were at least dozens of Earth Rank pills in the Pavilion Master’s hand!

This was simply unheard of!

Amidst everyone’s shock, the Pavilion Master held the pill in her hand. With a flick of her finger, it fell into Qin Yu’s mouth.

The moment Qin Yu consumed the pill, his internal qi slowly stabilized.

“Feed him once every hour.” The Pavilion Master handed the remaining pill to Taozi.

Taozi, who had always been proud, was now filled with respect.

She took the pill with both hands, bowed and said, “Please rest assured, Pavilion Master.”

The Pavilion Master didn’t say anything more. She turned to look at Old Mister Yan, bowed and said, “Old Mister Yan, may I have a word with you?”

Old Mister Yan also politely replied, “Alright.”

The two of them left the Elders’ Residence under the watchful eyes of the crowd.

The surrounding crowd had not recovered from their shock.

“The Pavilion Master is too amazing. She refined dozens of Earth Rank pills in half an hour.”

“Oh my God, the Pavilion Master controls different spirit fires with both hands! It results in different pills!”

“The Pavilion Master is my goddess!”

The Fifth Elder coughed and said, “Alright, Elder Qin needs to rest. Disperse quickly.”

After dispersing the crowd, Fifth Elder closed the door.

“What exactly did Mr. Qin experience to actually suffer such serious injuries?” Yao Qing couldn’t help but frown.

The Fifth Elder slowly said, “It must be the Yan family.”

“Yan Family? The Yan family of Jingdu?” Yao Qing immediately turned pale with fright.

“Aren’t Mr. Qin and Miss Yan a couple? How could this be...”

Taozi glanced at Yao Qing and said with a bit of disdain, “Qin Yu stole Old Mister Yan’s body. It’s already been spread around. I’m afraid only you don’t know.”

“Huh? Stole Old Mister Yan’s body? What on earth is going on?” Yao Qing was dumbfounded.

Taozi said impatiently, “Investigate it yourself!”

...

Qiao Wu treated his wound in the forest.

He held his phone and called Yan Sihai while trembling slightly.

The call was quickly picked up. Yan Sihai asked coldly, “Bring Qin Yu’s head back.”

Qiao Wu’s expression changed slightly. He said in a low voice, “Mr. ... Mr. Yan, the mission failed...”

“Failed?” Yan Sihai’s voice immediately carried some anger.

“What are you doing? The Yan family spent so much money to nurture you. Is it to support trash like you?” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Qiao Wu hurriedly explained, “President Yan, it’s the Divine Alchemist Pavilion! The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion saved Qin Yu!”
