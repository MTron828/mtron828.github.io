Chapter 920: Chapter 920: War is imminent!

The call was picked up quickly. Luo Yang said anxiously, “Young Master Gu, I have something to tell you.”

On the other end, Gu Xinghe was busy with the spirit stone mine.

Therefore, he said impatiently, “What is it?”

“It’s... Du Du du...”

Before Luo Yang could finish his sentence, the call was hung up.

A light flashed and broke Luo Yang’s phone.

The person who did it was none other than his father, Luo Jingyu.

“Dad, what are you doing!”Luo Yang said with some anger.

Luo Jingyu shook his head and said, “It’s better not to tell him about this.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Why? !”Luo Yang was extremely puzzled.

Luo Jingyu said in a deep voice, “They sent so many people, but they still couldn’t catch Qin Yu. If Qin Yu doesn’t die, we will die.”

“Then... then we will just endure it?”Luo Yang said with an angry face.

Luo Jingyu sighed slightly and said, “Let’s just forget about it.”

Although he said so, Luo Yang still had an unconvinced face.

Outside the door.

Qin Yu heard these words clearly.

After hearing Luo Jingyu’s words, Qin Yu finally relaxed and left this place.

...

There was only one day left before the opening of the Spirit Stone Mine.

More and more people were gathered around the big spirit stone mine.

From hiding in the dark at the beginning, they slowly moved up to the stage.

The seven martial saints from the secret realm were still discussing something.

The two sides at the scene were divided into two factions.

One faction was the current martial artists, and the other faction was the martial artists from the secret realm.

“How ironic. I didn’t expect that we would also encounter such a situation,”Zhuang Teng said self-deprecatingly.

“Yeah. Back then, which one of us didn’t look down on all living beings from above? Now, we are being looked down upon by a group of disciples from the Mystic Realm.”Chu Heng couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

“Now I finally understand why Qin Yu is full of hostility toward us,”Kong Yun said coldly.

The scene fell into silence, and everyone couldn’t help but sigh.

“The large spirit stone mine has been making a lot of noise these few days. It must be about to open soon,”Yao Meng said quietly.

She looked around as if she was looking for something.

“What’s Wrong?”Xiao Yuan asked.

Yao Meng frowned and said, “I have a feeling... that Qin Yu might come.”

...

That night, the atmosphere at the scene became more and more subtle.

Qin Yu finally arrived at the scene in the latter half of the night.

He released his spiritual sense and covered the surroundings.

Soon, Qin Yu’s face darkened.

There were at least close to a hundred people at the scene!

And the weakest one was at the Martial Marquis Realm!

“It seems that all the reclusive experts have come into being.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

A Hundred Martial Marquis was simply unheard of.

Such a scale had not been seen for many years.

Seeing that the scene was divided into two factions, Qin Yu could not help but sigh in his heart.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu silently approached Yao Meng and the others.

He stood in the faction of the heir, but he was dozens of meters away from Yao Meng and the others.

“With those seven martial saints around, we won’t be able to fight back at all,”someone said in a low voice.

“When the Spirit Stone mine opens, it will be the time for the conflict to erupt.”

“The conflict has been going on for the past few days. Both sides have suffered losses, but our losses are much greater.”

As he spoke, a car slowly drove over from not far away.

As soon as the car stopped, they saw Gu Xinghe get down from the car.

“This trash!”Zhuang Teng and the others could not help but curse inwardly when they saw Gu Xinghe!

Ever since the martial saint walked out of the secret realm, Gu Xinghe had been hanging out with them.

“In the past, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would at least pretend to be fair. Now, they don’t even pretend anymore and directly express their attitude,”Yao Meng said in a low voice.

“It’s Still Qin Yu Who’s smart enough to fall out with the Jingdu martial arts association long ago.”

“This bastard, since he’s made his stance clear, don’t even think about leading the martial arts world. But he won’t. He wants everything.”

Under everyone’s gaze, Gu Xinghe walked towards the seven martial saints.

When he passed Zhuang Teng and the others, Gu Xinghe stopped in his tracks.

“Everyone, how have you been?”Gu Xinghe said with a smile.

Zhuang Teng said with a cold smile, “Oh, isn’t this the young master from the second secret realm? We are truly honored to be able to speak to you.”

“That’s right, young master Gu, Why aren’t you bringing your disciples from the secret realm to show off? What are you talking to us for?”

Gu Xinghe was not angry about this.

He smiled faintly and said, “I know you’ve all misunderstood me, but let me tell you, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely give you the answer you want.”

“What we represent is not the secret realm nor you, but fairness.”

“Bah!”Zhuang Teng could not help but spit on the ground.

Gu Xinghe sighed slightly and waved his hand, “I will give you the answer you want.”

After he finished speaking, Gu Xinghe walked towards the seven martial saints.

“Motherf * cker, you pretentious son of a B * Tch!”

“I really want to smash his head!”

“When I step into the martial saint realm, I will definitely kill all of them!”

As he was speaking, another disciple from the secret realm walked over not far away.

This person was dressed in gorgeous clothes and surrounded by pearls. He had the demeanor of a rich young master.

When Zhuang Teng and the others saw this person, a trace of anger flashed across their faces.

This person was none other than the disciple of the mystic realm who had injured Zhuang Teng and Kong Yun, Qiao Zun!

Qiao Zun’s gaze swept across the surroundings and finally landed on Zhuang Teng and the others.

Following that, a trace of playfulness flashed across Qiao Zun’s face as he walked straight towards Zhuang Teng.

“Oh, you’re still alive?”Qiao Zun said sarcastically.

Zhuang teng gritted his teeth and said, “You’re not dead yet, how could I Be Dead?”

Qiao Zun clicked his tongue and said, “Looks like I was too lenient last time. If I had known earlier, I would have slapped you to death.”

“You!”Zhuang Teng was so angry that his face turned pale and he clenched his fists tightly.

Qiao Zun ignored him and continued to ridicule, “This is not a place that you can come to. You also want to obtain this spirit stone mine? You Don’t even have a martial saint, what right do you have? Hurry up and go home to wash up and sleep.”

“F * ck your mother!”Kong Yun immediately roared and threw a punch at Qiao Zun!

Qiao Zun immediately raised his hand to receive the punch. When the two fists collided, the world instantly shook and rumbled!

“You defeated opponent, you still dare to attack me? !”Qiao Zun said with a gloomy face.

“F * ck your mother! If it weren’t for your tricks, how could I have lost to you!”Kong Yun said furiously.

“If you don’t accept it, just fight again!”

Qiao Zun narrowed his eyes and said, “Well, if you want to die, I Won’t Stop You!”
