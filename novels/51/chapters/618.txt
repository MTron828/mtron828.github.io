Although that was the case, the road ahead was already blocked. How could he escape?

Even if Qin Yu used all his strength, he was completely unable to break through this barrier!

And behind him, the two male corpses were walking over step by step.

The distance between them was getting closer and closer. The powerful pressure on their bodies was suffocating!

Qin Yu felt even more terrified, as if the two people in front of him were like two demons!

“Damn it!” The man with the mustache gritted his teeth and took out one Magic Artifact after another from his Spatial Magic Artifact.

“I’ll think of a way to stop them, and you’ll think of a way to break this barrier!” The man with the mustache said.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded. He took out the bronze sword in his hand to try it out.

Then, the man with the mustache shouted and took out the Magic Artifact in his hand!

However, a shocking scene happened.

The two male corpses only raised their hands and glanced at it from the corner of their eyes. The Magic Artifact exploded!

“How... how could this be?!” At this moment, Qin Yu was dumbfounded!

The Magic Artifacts in the man with the mustache’s hand were all top-notch in the world!

But such a top-notch magical artifact was shattered by a single glance!

What kind of strength and what kind of spell was this?

“It’s over!” When he saw this scene, the man with the mustache’s face was ashen.

He knew that no matter how many magical artifacts there were, they probably wouldn’t be able to restrain these two male corpses!

“Get out of the way! I’ll do it!” Qin Yu hurriedly walked to the front of the man with the mustache.

The fear in his heart growing, he stared at the two male corpses nervously.

This fear came from the bottom of his heart, and it came from the gap in strength! There was simply no way to restrain them!

Qin Yu held the bronze sword in his hand, and with an angry roar, he poured all his spiritual power into the bronze sword. Then, his body rose into the air and slashed down viciously!

“Clang!”

The instant Qin Yu’s sword landed on their bodies, it was sent flying!

That terrifying power shook Qin Yu until he vomited blood!

“How can there be such people in this world...” Qin Yu’s face was pale, and his heart was filled with terror.

“It’s over.” The man with the mustache was also panicking at this moment.

He had walked through so many tombs, but he had never seen an existence with such strength!

“Don’t you know how to set up a formation? Quickly set up a formation and send us out!” Qin Yu shouted anxiously.

The man with the mustache couldn’t help but curse, “Do you think a formation is that easy to set up? Do you think I have time to set up a formation?!”

“Furthermore, do you think a formation is useful in front of such an existence?!”

Qin Yu’s expression turned uglier and uglier. The two male corpses were getting closer and closer to Qin Yu. That powerful pressure made them feel as if it was going to flatten their bodies!

“This won’t do... If this continues, they won’t even need to make a move. We’ll all be crushed into meat paste!” Qin Yu said in pain.

He curled up his body and was about to kneel on the ground.

Cracking sounds came from all over his body. His bones seemed to be crushed, and cracks appeared on his body!

“I told you to leave quickly!” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but curse.

“This is great. I’m going to die here...”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He looked up at the two male corpses and kept thinking for a way to escape.

“I got it!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly had an idea!

He hurriedly took out the picture he had taken from the coffin and threw it out!

Although he didn’t know if it would work, Qin Yu could only give it a try now.

Buzz!

The picture floated above the male corpse, exuding an ancient and internal qi.

The two male corpses stopped in their tracks.

They raised their heads and looked at the picture.

The atmosphere was awkward, and Qin Yu was extremely nervous!

“Is it useful?” The man with the mustache asked.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I don’t know. I can only give it a try. If it really doesn’t work, I’ll return this thing!”

The man with the mustache nodded and said, “Yes, my life is important.”

The picture hung in the air, and the two male corpses just stared at it blankly.

“Quickly take out the bracelets and clothes!” Qin Yu shouted.

At this moment, the man with the mustache didn’t dare to be negligent. He hurriedly took out the clothes and bracelet and threw them forward.

The clothes floated in the air and flew toward the two male corpses.

The moment the two male corpses saw the clothes, a trace of fear flashed in their eyes!

In the next second, the male corpses turned around and walked away. Their footsteps were even somewhat panicked.

All the internal qi started to disappear at this moment. Everything returned to calm.

Qin Yu panted heavily, and the pressure on his body made him unable to breathe. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It really workes!” The man with the mustache man said excitedly.

“Qin Yu, you’re a genius!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. His face was filled with mixed emotions, and the scene from just now couldn’t help but flash through his mind.

When the two male corpses saw the clothes, they seemed to be extremely terrified.

One had to know that they were existences that surpassed Mighty Realm powerhouses!

Such invincible existences were scared off by a single piece of clothing...

What level had that masked woman reached?

What had she done to cause these two invincible cultivators to be afraid of even a single piece of her clothing?

“Let’s hurry up and leave. I don’t want to stay in this place for even a minute.” The man with the mustache said anxiously.

Qin Yu nodded. He didn’t think about it anymore. Instead, he nodded and said, “Yes, it’s time to go back and take a look.”

“Go back?” The man with the mustache was stunned.

“Go back to where?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Of course, I’m leaving the Immortal Slaying Sect. I’m going back to where I came from.”

Hearing this, the man with the mustache fell into silence.

A moment later, he reached out and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Qin Yu, I suggest that you don’t leave for the time being.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and asked, “Why?”

The man with the mustache said in a deep voice, “In the month that you disappeared, all the young masters broke through one after another. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association even had a new peak Martial Marquis.”

“Moreover... The Jingdu Martial Arts Association announced to the public that you were dead. If you weren’t dead, it would be a slap to their faces.”

“They will definitely use the fastest method to kill you regardless of the cost! They will even spare no expense to dispatch a Martial Saint!”

Qin Yu instantly fell into silence.

The man with the mustache’s words made sense. Qin Yu knew very well that he had already repeatedly offended the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the various aristocratic families.

“You are now a famous person. Wherever you go, you will receive a lot of attention. Once you appear, there is no escape,” the man with the mustache said.
