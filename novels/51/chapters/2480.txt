2481 The Heavenly Divination Sect Appears

The second move that he had just burned his soul could reach a higher level.

After returning from the ghost realm, he had only used the third move once.

Qin Yu, indeed, could not deal with it if he encountered such a strong person again.

He cast his gaze on He Teng’s severed arm.

Qin Yu had kept one of his arms in his Sumeru World when his body was pierced by Lei Xin earlier. Wang Feng had set up many array formations in the Sumeru ring to suppress it.

When Qin Yu carefully examined it, he realized it was not the formation.

90% of the power in the Sumeru World was resisting this arm, including the two supreme treasures, the Heart of Thunder and the Five Emperor Coins.

“Does an arm has such great strength?”

Qin Yu was somewhat shocked.

The golden desolate divine eye shone on the arm.

Qin Yu’s divine sense rumbled as if it had hit something tremendously hard as soon as his gaze landed on the skin.

The desolate divine eye on his forehead again concentrated and gazed at the monster race’s arm.

When it passed through the skin, Qin Yu seemed to have seen a trace of green air current that was tremendously hard to detect.

The green ball of air slithered around his arm like a small snake. Wherever it passed, the flesh of his arm would undergo some change.

Every cell seemed to have expanded and formed a space, which was why the body had such terrifying power. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Could this green energy be something similar to a bloodline, and it can affect the changes in the entire body?”

Qin Yu was amazed. This wisp of air current was tremendously thin.

However, its effect was extremely impactful. He Teng must have such a dense bloodline power in his body that could erupt with terrifying strength.

This bloodline power was tremendously strange. As long as it existed, it could bring about such a major change to his body.

He was somewhat curious. Could it be that the monster race’s Path of Heaven was a kind of creature that could bestow its bloodline to others?

Although there would be an advancement, there was a world of difference from the changes brought about by the power of the bloodline.

It was similar to the acupoints in Qin Yu’s body, but it was so delicate that it could open up a space in each cell. Although the space was not as huge as the six acupoints, it was tremendously terrifying when stacking up.

This was inconceivable. Qin Yu’s Way of Spatial Rules was considered the most profound he had comprehended.

Thus far, he had only opened six acupoints, which could not be compared to the transformation of the bloodline power.

Qin Yu stared intently at the transformation of this green bloodline power, hoping to pry out some secrets from it.

If he could gain something out of it, his physical body could advance further and no longer be limited to the soul’s Way of Rules!

At this moment, Flower Granny had returned from her cultivation. She walked to Qin Yu’s side and looked at He Teng’s monster race’s arm with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu told Flower Granny about his discovery in detail. Flower Granny could comprehend the Way of Time. Her soul talent was top-notch, and she might have some solutions.

“Can you purify this bloodline and merge it with yourself?”

Flower Granny asked after a moment of silence.

“I should be able to, but this bloodline most likely has its consciousness that the monster race’s Path of Heaven should be able to withdraw it at any time. It’s similar to the bone cultivation water that I came into contact with previously. I’m afraid I can’t resist the will of this bloodline power.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Although he was very confident in his soul, he did not have the slightest bit of confidence against the monster race’s Path of Heaven.

If something went wrong with this thing, this wisp of bloodline could probably control him, something he could not bet on.

“There’s no need to rush. As it involves the power of the Path of Heaven of the Monster race, how can it be so easy to see through? Take your time with it.”

Flower Granny also agreed with Qin Yu’s actions.

Her palm gently slid across the monster race’s arm as if using the power of time to pry into the foundation of the Path of Heaven of the demon race.

Qin Yu stared at Flower Granny and suddenly had a tremendously strange illusion. However, he could not tell what it was.

“We’re about to reach Solitary Cloud City. It seems there’s a problem there.”

At this moment, Ji Yue’s voice sounded. She reminded everyone with an ugly expression.

She had just received the news that Yan Ruoxue had not made herself back in time because something had happened in Solitary Cloud City.

…

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue was outside of Solitary Cloud City. There were nearly a hundred people in front of her.

All these people had the word “divination” on their clothes.

“The Heavenly Divination Sect has reappeared. Looks like this chaotic world is really coming.”

“Isn’t that true? The Heavenly Divination Sect hasn’t appeared for two Path of Heaven years. This time, so many people appeared. I’m afraid that the situation is complex. The four sects and four schools are starting to get restless.”

Many humans lived near Solitary Cloud City, so a veteran cultivator immediately recognized this group of people.

The leader was a young man who was as good-looking as a woman. He revealed a faint smile.

“I heard you’re looking for people to go to the Solitary Shadow Continent. I wonder if the people from our Heavenly Divination Sect can win your admiration.”

“I’m sorry. I’m not interested in people who are neither male nor female.”

“But I’m interested in your bloodline. The human race now seems much more interesting than I imagined that I encountered such a powerful bloodline just after leaving the sect.”

Yan Ruoxue frowned slightly. She had wanted to seek help but encountered the people from the four ancient sects unexpectedly.

These people gave Yan Ruoxue a terrible feeling. All the while, they had never cared about the one billion humans in the Solitary Shadow Continent.

After a round of conversation, she had completely given up on the idea of convincing them.

“Whoosh!”

The handsome young man touched his chin, and his movements suddenly froze.

During this pause, he had already appeared beside Yan Ruoxue. He smiled and placed one hand on Yan Ruoxue’s shoulder.

Suddenly, his expression froze.

His hand pierced the “Yan Ruoxue” before him, but it was an afterimage.

After that, Yan Ruoxue’s body suddenly appeared on the distant horizon as if she had teleported.

Even the elderly man with a powerful internal behind him exclaimed.

“This is similar to the two points of attraction of the teleportation formation. This speed is close to teleportation. This woman has terrifying talent!”
