1790 The Dao of the Immortal Emperor

Everyone was dumbfounded to see such an ending.

Even Qin Yu was speechless.

He didn’t expect this to happen! Jue Wu had actually taken advantage of the darkness of the night and secretly injured Cao Huang!

“This doesn’t make sense. Isn’t Qin Yu’s primordial spirit damaged? How did he defeat Cao Huang?”

“The key is that Cao Huang is at the Reversion Void Stage while Qin Yu is only a Peak of Mighty Realm Cultivator. Unless he is hiding his true strength, he is definitely not Cao Huang’s match.”

“There are only a handful of people in the entire Demon-slaying Peak who can defeat Cao Huang quietly,” the peak master said at this point.

“Even I can’t do it,” he said coldly, with his hands behind his back.

Then, his gaze fell on Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, what secret treasure did you use?” The peak master said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t want to cause trouble for Jue Wu, so he nodded and said, “Yes, I did use a secret treasure.”

“Why did you secretly attack Cao Huang?” The peak master was a little unhappy.

“He kept provoking me. I couldn’t hold back my anger. Thus I went to find him in the middle of the night,” Qin Yu said.

The peak Master snorted coldly. He placed his hands behind his back and reprimanded, “I’ll let it go this time. But you’re not allowed to do this again in the future.”

“Yes.” Qin Yu bowed slightly.

After saying this, the peak master did not stay any longer and turned to leave.

On the other hand, Jue Wu pulled Qin Yu and quickly returned to the cave abode.

As soon as they returned to the cave abode, Jue Wu used a secret technique to seal the entrance.

“What do you think? Didn’t this resolve the crisis?” she said triumphantly.

“You’re indeed good at this…” Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said.

Jue Wu had indeed helped Qin Yu out of his predicament.

It was not that Qin Yu was afraid of Cao Huang, but she was worried that he couldn’t suppress the evil thought in his heart.

After saying this, Qin Yu’s forehead was covered with sweat again.

Obviously, it was getting harder for Qin Yu to refrain from his impulse.

Another two days passed.

Qin Yu’s condition was getting worse.

There seemed to be hundreds of millions of ants crawling in his heart, constantly drilling.

“Tomorrow is the day of the dao lecture. You… Are you alright?” Jue Wu frowned and said.

Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead and said, “I can bear it.”

Jue Wu sighed. She didn’t know how to make Qin Yu feel better. Thus she could only chit-chat to divert Qin Yu’s attention.

The following day was the day of the dao lecture.

On this day, everyone in Demon-slaying Peak came to Demon-slaying Peak’s dao lecture hall.

This dao lecture hall was not as grand as Qin Yu had imagined. Instead, it was like a small temple and was rather down-to-earth.

Around the dao lecture hall, there was a huge bell hanging. Rumor had it that dao technique was emitted through this huge bell.

The dao technique emitted through the bell was the dao of the Immortal Emperor, which was extremely precious.

“Qin Yu, you’re pretty awesome. You actually defeated Cao Huang without a sound,” As soon as Qin Yu entered the hall, Xiaobai came over.

“It was with the help of a secret treasure,” Qin Yu forced a smile and said.

“That’s not a bad choice,” Xiao Bai smiled and said.

,

Qin Yu remained silent. As he never liked to lie, he would be exposed if he continued.

In the dao lecture hall, people arrived one after another.

At this moment, a man of average height walked in from the outside.

He didn’t look strong, but the internal qi he exuded carried a sense of pressure.

“He is Jiu Xiao,” Xiaobai introduced and said.

Qin Yu’s eyes immediately looked in the direction of Jiu Xiao.

Not only Qin Yu but almost everyone looked at Jiu Xiao simultaneously. Some also greeted him warmly.

Jiu Xiao only nodded slightly, as a top-notch martial artist did.

“This Jiu Xiao is indeed not simple,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He could vaguely feel a trace of an extremely powerful internal qi from Jiu Xiao’s body. It was as if he was surrounded by a dao technique.

Qin Yu had only ever felt such a feeling from Xiao Sheng.

“He’s the number one person of Demon-slaying Peak and has been evaluated by the dean. Rumor has it that he can reach the True Saint cultivation realm within 100 years,” Xiaobai said with emotion.

“A hundred years…” Qin Yu murmured.

Of course, he knew it was extremely difficult to become a True Saint within 100 years.

It would take several hundreds of years for a mighty realm cultivator to reach the Reversion Void Stage, not to mention the True Saint.

At this moment, Qin Yu saw Cao Huang from the corners of his eyes.

The moment he saw Cao Huang, Qin Yu immediately had a bad feeling.

“I have something to do over there. I’ll talk to you later,” he said to Xiaobai. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left, trying to avoid Cao Huang.

However, Cao Huang seemed to be here for Qin Yu. As soon as he entered the room, his eyes swept around.

Soon, Cao Huang’s gaze landed on Qin Yu.

He hurriedly came over to Qin Yu.

“Brat, you’re pretty good!” Cao Huang said through gritted teeth.

“You’re not my match, so you f*cking let your hatchet man bully me?”

That hatchet man, of course, was Jue Wu.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Who said it was Jue Wu who beat you? Do you have any evidence?”

“Of course, I don’t have any f*cking evidence! However, I can issue you another challenge letter!” Cao Huang said through gritted teeth.

At this moment, a hand patted Cao Huang’s shoulder.

Cao Huang instantly turned his head and was about to start cursing.

However, when he saw that it was Jue Wu, his expression became a little unnatural.

He pointed at Jue Wu and said, “You… You don’t do anything silly. You don’t think I’m scared of you!”

Jue Wu grinned and said, “Who said you’re scared of me? Why do I do a silly thing? I just saw you guys chatting and wanted to chat with you. Why are you so nervous?”

“I… I don’t want to talk to you,” Cao Huang bit the bullet and said.

“Oh! It’s fine if you don’t want to talk to me now. I’ll go look for you tonight.” Jue Wu’s smile was innocent and pure, but in Cao Huang’s eyes, it was like a demon.

He swallowed his saliva and turned around to leave.

Looking at his back, Jue Wu snorted and muttered, “If he still doesn’t behave, I’ll beat him up again tonight!”

“Cao Huang shouldn’t be a villain. Otherwise, he could have publicly announced this matter,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Who cares!” Jue Wu waved her hand.

“If others find out about this, I’m afraid it’ll be troublesome,” Qin Yu said worriedly.

Jue Wu wasn’t worried at all. She looked so relaxed.

Qin Yu didn’t think much about it. He and Jue Wu found seats for themselves and waited for the lecture to begin.

After a while.

A white-robed, sage-like old man walked in.

Upon seeing this person, everyone stood up, cupped their hands, and greeted him, “Mr. Jiang.”

The old man, who was addressed as Mr. Jiang, nodded slightly and then walked to the seat where the lecture was held and sat down.

Qin Yu took a look at Mr. Jiang and felt that his internal qi was especially calm and bottomless. Looking at him, he was as if looking at an ancient well.
