Chapter 1372: Chapter 1372, Cooperation 1

Ding Jie’s entire body erupted with an extremely terrifying spiritual power, shaking the entire city.

Wen Da and Wen Er were so frightened that they hurriedly hid behind qin yu and whispered, “Qin Yu, I’ll leave the rest to you.”

Qin Yu sneered, “Don’t worry, I was just about to test the effects of this body tempering.”

A treasured sword appeared in Ding Jie’s hand.

The treasured sword flickered with a cold radiance and carried a sharp aura as it stabbed straight at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He clenched his fist and pretended to attack. He deliberately revealed a flaw and let Ding Jie’s treasured sword stab at Qin Yu’s face.

Upon seeing this, Ding Jie was immediately overjoyed. The spiritual power in his entire body burst out to the limit and was poured into the treasured sword in an attempt to pierce through Qin Yu’s head!

The sword was approaching Qin Yu’s glabella, and Qin Yu took the opportunity to reach out her palm and grab Ding Jie!

“Clang!”

The sword landed on Qin Yu’s glabella, and a wound appeared on her glabella!

Qin Yu also took the opportunity to grab Ding Jie’s palm. He ignored his injury and rushed forward, pulling Ding Jie in front of him!

Ding Jie’s expression changed. He had a bad feeling and immediately planned to escape.

How Could Qin Yu give him the chance? He immediately approached and grabbed Ding Jie’s neck!

“Now you can’t escape, right?”Qin Yu grinned and said with a cold smile.

Ding Jie’s expression couldn’t help but turn ugly. He had never thought that Qin Yu would choose such a desperate method of fighting.

Traces of blood flowed out from between Qin Yu’s brows.

The treasured sword had pierced half a centimeter into Qin Yu’s glabella, leaving a trace of a wound on his skull.

However, such an injury couldn’t endanger Qin Yu’s life at all. Instead, he had fallen into the jaws of a tiger.

Ding Jie tried to struggle, but he discovered that Qin Yu’s palm was like an iron pincer, unable to move at all.

“You people from big sects seem to be quite fragile in your hearts,”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Ding Jie gritted his teeth. A bright light suddenly burst out from between his brows, trying to force Qin Yu away.

However, Qin Yu did not dodge, but actually withstood it! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The light hit Qin Yu’s body, emitting bursts of explosive sounds. White spots appeared in front of everyone.

Ding Jie’s expression changed slightly, and then he sneered, “No wonder even the sect master looks up to you. You really have some ability.”

Qin Yu looked coldly at Ding Jie in front of her and said, “You’re not my match. Don’t waste your energy. If you’re willing to help me, I might consider letting you go.”

“F * ck you. Since I’m here, I have no intention of going back alive!”Ding Jie sneered.

“To tell you the truth, if you kill me, the great elder will immediately find your position! At that time, you won’t be able to escape!”

“Come on, come and kill me!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. This Ding Jie was really loyal to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

As such, Qin Yu couldn’t kill him.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and then said, “Ding Jie, don’t you think about your wife?”

“Bah! You Don’t deserve to mention her! Shut Up!”Ding Jie’s eyes were wide open and his face was ferocious.

“There’s no need to be so agitated,”Qin Yu said with a smile. “Think about it carefully. If you die, how sad your wife will be. If you die, the words we scolded you just now will become real.”

Ding Jie’s expression immediately became a little ugly.

He seemed to be unable to accept his wife becoming someone else’s home.

After hesitating for half a second, ding jie said coldly, “Don’t waste your energy. I Won’t do anything that will let down the heavenly cloud sect.”

“Don’t worry. I Won’t let you do anything that will let down the heavenly cloud sect. This matter is beneficial to me and the Heavenly Cloud Sect,”said Qin Yu.

Ding Jie frowned slightly. He looked at Qin Yu as if he was waiting for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I heard that the young master of the Heavenly Cloud sect rarely shows his face and almost never leaves the sect, right?”

Ding Jie snorted coldly and said, “So? You killed the young master just after he left the sect. You deserve to die!”

Qin Yu ignored Ding Jie’s curses and continued, “Have you ever thought about why the young master of the Heavenly Cloud sect suddenly left the sect and provoked me on the premise that I have already made peace with your sect master?”

“Do you want to kill him just because he provoked you? !”Ding Jie said angrily.

Qin Yu shook her head and said, “I think there’s a trick in this. I’m afraid that someone did it on purpose to sow discord between me and the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

Upon hearing this, Ding Jie was also stunned for a moment, but he soon sneered.

“What do you want to say? You want to stay clear of this matter? Isn’t it you or something?”Ding Jie sneered.

“You underestimate me, Qin Yu.”Qin Yu sneered.

“I killed him. The relationship between me and the Tianyun sect has long fallen to the freezing point. There is no possibility of detente.”

“I only let you do this because I want to clarify the matter. I don’t want to be used for no reason.”

“I think your sect master will have the same idea.”

“If you cooperate with me, you can save your life and help your sect leader figure out the truth. Why Not?”
