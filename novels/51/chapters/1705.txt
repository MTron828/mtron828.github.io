Chapter 1706: The Dead River that Was about to Disappear Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu didn’t know what Sister Lin had experienced, nor did he know her current living conditions.

But at this moment, Qin Yu didn’t care at all. He only wanted to cultivate as soon as possible.

All beauty would eventually turn into skeletons in Qin Yu’s eyes. It wasn’t worth mentioning.

“Sister Lin.” Qin Yu greeted her.

Sister Lin was also quite eager. She seemed to be very happy to see Qin Yu.

The City Lord by the side stood up and said, “You guys chat first. I’ll get someone to send it over to you later.”

“Okay, thank you very much.” Qin Yu nodded.

After the City Lord left, Qin Yu looked at Sister Lin and said, “Sister Lin, how have you been?”

Sister Lin smiled and said, “Pretty good. Now Nanzhou is different from the past. All the major auctions have started. I’ve also benefited from it.”

Qin Yu glanced at Sister Lin and realized her cultivation had stopped advancing. There was no improvement at all.

Qin Yu was very clear in his mind that Golden Age was both a prosperous and a chaotic era.

In such a great era, nothing was worth mentioning other than strength. Strength was the only thing.

If one did not have powerful strength, the future would not be good.

“Sister Lin, if you have time, you should cultivate more.”

Qin Yu did not know how to advise her. So he could only tactfully remind her.

After saying that, Qin Yu took out a drop of dragon blood and gave it to Sister Lin. He also told her the same thing he told the City Lord.

Seeing this, Sister Lin could not help but smile and say, “Why are you behaving as if you’re leaving your last words? Why? Are you not coming back in the future?”

“I will,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

However, whether or not he would come back and what he would be when he came back, no one could tell for sure.

“By the way, Sister Lin. Do you still have that thing that could change your appearance previously?” Qin Yu asked.

Sister Lin was startled and said, “What do you want that for?”

“It’s useful.” Qin Yu didn’t tell her the truth.

Sister Lin thought for a moment and said, “I don’t have it now, but I can help you look for it. It will take some time.”

“How long will it take?” Qin Yu asked.

“I’m afraid it will take a few days,” said Sister Lin.

Hearing that, Qin Yu immediately shook his head and said, “It’s too late. Can it be done in a day?”

Sister Lin frowned slightly and said, “Are you in such a hurry?”

“Yes, I really need that thing,” said Qin Yu.

Sister Lin thought for a moment and said, “Alright, I’ll try my best. Wait for me here. I’ll be back by tomorrow at the latest.”

“Thank you.” Qin Yu bowed slightly.

Without further ado, Sister Lin immediately left the city to look for what Qin Yu needed.

That day, Qin Yu did not leave Gu City.

At night, Qin Yu and the City Lord sat together and played chess.

The City Lord asked casually, “Qin Yu, who do you think will win in the end between North Plain and Nanzhou?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t dare to make a conclusion before I see Yuan Xiu again.”

The City Lord sighed and said, “There’s no need to say too much about the sect master’s strength. However, Yuan Xiu is not to be trifled with. He has lived too long. In front of yuan Xiu, the sect master is only a junior.”

Qin Yu glanced at the City Lord and said, “It seems that you don’t think highly of the sect master.”

“It’s not that I don’t think highly of him,” the City Lord said in a deep voice.

“I’m also considered one of his subordinates. Although I don’t interact much with him, I do know about him.

“Xiao Sheng is extremely conceited. His conceit will make him pay the price sooner or later.”

Qin Yu remained silent. For a moment, he did not know how to comment.

What the City Lord said was naturally correct, but this was Xiao Sheng’s path.

Once he gave up his path, his cultivation would most likely stop advancing.

This kind of dao technique that left no room for escape so that the soldiers would fight for their lives out of desperation and eventually win the battle had only two outcomes.

It would either become an extreme tribulation or become a skeleton.

“Maybe.” Qin Yu sighed.

…

The next day.

Qin Yu woke up early. Just like the day before, he played chess with the City Lord while waiting for Sister Lin.

“Your mind seems to be very unstable,” the City Lord said indifferently.

Qin Yu put down the chess piece in his hand and sighed. “Yes, my mind can’t calm down at all.”

“What happened?” the city Lord asked with a smile.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

Qin Yu couldn’t say anything about the Yan family.

However, this matter was like an inner demon, making Qin Yu unable to calm down.

This was definitely not a good thing. For cultivation, once one’s mind was unstable, it was very likely to affect the dao technique.

At noon, Sister Lin finally returned.

Seeing Sister Lin return, the City Lord consciously retreated, leaving the two of them a private space.

“Sister Lin.” Qin Yu stood up and greeted Sister Lin.

Being fatigued with the journey, Sister Lin was a little breathless.

“I found the thing.” Sister Lin took out a small jar and handed it to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took it and said, “Is it like previously? It can only last for one month?”

“No, this time is slightly different. It can last longer,” said Sister Lin.

Qin Yu was slightly surprised and said, “How long can it last?”

“One and a half months,” said Sister Lin.

“Additional half a month…” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

Although it was not a lot of time, fifteen days of cultivation was precious enough for Qin Yu.

“Thank you.” Qin Yu cupped his hands to Sister Lin.

“By the way, if you receive such a thing, please keep an eye out for me,” Qin Yu said to Sister Lin.

Sister Lin did not ask further. She just nodded and said, “Okay, I got it.”

At this moment, the general sent out by the City Lord rushed back.

He held a huge jar in his hand. This jar looked very much smaller than Qin Yu had imagined.

“Young Master Qin.” The general handed the jar to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “It’s so small?”

The general smiled bitterly and said, “This is the biggest I could find. I’m really sorry.”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Thank you.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Although it was smaller than he had imagined, it was better than nothing.

After taking the jar, Qin Yu said, “Please say goodbye to the City Lord on my behalf.”

“Okay.” The general nodded and agreed.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He put away the jar and left.

And this time, the place Qin Yu was going to was the northern border.

On the City Wall.

The City Lord looked at Qin Yu’s back and an extremely strange expression flashed across his face.

“The Golden Age is still the stage for these people,” the City Lord muttered softly before shaking his head.

…

Qin Yu rode on the Divine Eagle and headed straight for the northern border.

The dead river was getting even smaller, to the point that it was almost insignificant.

On both shores, a large group of people had gathered!

At a glance, it stretched for dozens of li!

Their bodies were emitting an extremely powerful internal qi. With such a huge amount, the space in the surroundings nearly couldn’t take it.

Those who could stand on the dead river’s shores and curse at each other, naturally, their strength did not need to be elaborated.

And those who were weaker were hiding quietly and started bragging.
