2251 Suo Lin Tribulation Divine Weapon

The Venerable Fifth Mountain was tremendously solid and durable due to its inherent properties of a giant mountain.

However, the highest temperature lava in the Fire Unicorn Continent was drawn up, at this moment, with the help of the fire unicorn’s inner core, and he could try to combine these supreme treasures again!

As expected, within a few breaths, the Venerable Fifth Mountain and the Soul-hunting Bell melted into a material resembling golden water.

The golden water spiraled around the boxing gloves earlier on, and the aura of the gloves instantly soared.

In the sky, a massive bolt of lightning struck down.

Under the terrifying thunder and lightning, even the ever-present fiery clouds that lingered in the sky seemed to retreat silently.

In Qin Yu’s consciousness, a violent and fierce beast took shape and transformed into a magical artifact as heavy as a mountain, which also had a demonic soul-hunting power.

“That’s right. It’s the inner core of the fire unicorn, and how did Qin Yu manage to get hold of the inner core of the fire unicorn?”

The man with the mustache had a look of disbelief on his face. It was an ancient fierce beast, and even if it was a remnant soul, a tribulation mighty realm cultivator would be intimidated.

No one had expected the demonic egg Jue Wu had left in the Sumeru ring to be even more terrifying in the soul aspect. It suppressed the fire unicorn’s remnant soul so much that it did not dare to move, or else even Black Qin Yu’s soul could not withstand it.

“The fluctuations of this magical artifact actually caused the world to tremble!”

Wang Feng looked shocked as well. It was the first time he had seen such a level of artifact refinement.

“The soul of this artifact was of the ancient fierce beast unicorn. With the Venerable Fifth Mountain, Wu Ji’s robe, and even the Soul-hunting Bell, just thinking about it is terrifying.”

The man with the mustache looked at the boxing gloves about to be born and gasped.

“Immediately gather all the people of the Mysterious Dark Sect and get the sect master to come over immediately. Tell the sect master an extremely powerful tribulation divine artifact has emerged which might even be stronger than the sect’s supreme treasure, the Yin-Yang Dual Qi Vessel!”

Greed filled Nangong Qi’s face.

“Hurry up, get the sect master to mobilize all the elders in the sect!”

“Yes, sir!”

A cultivator retreated fearfully and cautiously.

“It’s my Azure Firmament Sect’s Soul-hunting Bell. Let’s see who dares to stop my Azure Firmament Sect from taking back this magical artifact!

An old woman said coldly and crushed a voice transmission jade slip to summon her disciples to the Fire Unicorn Continent.

At this moment, the nearby cultivators were rushing toward the Fire Unicorn Continent.

His face was nearly bloodless, and the hand holding the carving knife was trembling.

At this moment, he almost depleted the spirit essence around him.

What was even more worrying was that his divine sense was nearly exhausted.

Spiritual energy could be replenished quickly through spirit essence pills, but the recovery of divine sense required a long time.

More and more cultivators gathered in this area and even some people in the distant Holy Region learned of this news.

“Qin Y… If it doesn’t work out, just give up on this divine artifact…”

Elder Guai glanced at Qin Yu.

At this moment, both Qin Yu’s legs were broken, and his hands and body skin were also severely damaged. The spiritual power and divine sense were almost depleted. In this state, even if the divine artifact was successfully refined, he could not escape unharmed.

“Elder Guai, the man with the mustache, and Wang Feng, leave this place first.”

Qin Yu handed the Sumeru ring to Elder Guai. He was now in a terrible state.

He was unsure how the situation would develop subsequently, but even if there were only a slim chance, he would not give up.

“Take care, Qin Yu. I believe you have your own judgment, but let me say this, where there is life, there is hope.”

The man with the mustache said seriously.

The three retreated in silently. As everyone focused on Suo Lin, their departure did not attract much attention.

Suddenly, a violent surge of soul power exploded within Suo LIn, and a sickly flush of red appeared on his face.

Qin Yu’s eyes were a little red as burning his soul was burning his life away.

His speed of carving the formation became even faster, and the formation continued to enter the glove.

The thunderclouds in the sky grew even more dense, and finally, in the last moment before the boxing gloves solidified, the last stroke of power was absorbed into the gloves.

A divine artifact was formed!

A lightning beam as thick as a water bucket struck the boxing glove, and the boxing glove emitted a silver light.

Under the baptism of the lightning tribulation, the silver light became even more dazzling, and even the powerful True Saints could not look directly at it.

Dozens of massive lightning bolts struck the boxing glove, refining the last trace of impurities.

Suo Lin laughed frantically as he struggled to crawl to the gloves.

He hugged the gloves gently with both hands as if hugging his children.

“Boom!”

Under the vast lightning beam, the entire Suo LIn turned into nothingness.

“Roar!”

A tremendous beast roar resounded throughout the entire world, and the gloves floated up and slowly merged into Qin Yu’s left hand.

As he had refined the glove along with his divine sense earlier on, Qin Yu felt a completely different contact from before when the glove merged with his hand. It was as if the magical artifact was a part of his body.

“Master Suo Lin, I’ll name this divine artifact Suo Lin. One day, I will make your name resound throughout the Path of heaven.”

Qin Yu looked at the sky and shouted.

He suddenly raised his hand, and in an instant, the volcano seemed to be triggered, and hundreds of fire beams shot into the clouds, and the entire Fire Unicorn land overturned.

“Hiss!”

Many people gasped. A simple trigger could create such a terrifying power!

The peak of tribulation magical artifact! Many cultivators’ pupils dilated with excitement, their eyes filled with inexplicable meanings. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The fire unicorn was the king of this Fire Unicorn Continent. It was almost effortless to draw the lava here.

“Brat, hand over the divine artifact! Master Suo Lin is an honorary elder of our Mysterious Dark Sect. If he dies, you have to pay the price!” Nangong Qi said coldly.

Bullsh*t! Master Suo Lin and I have a deep bond despite the age difference. The divine artifact he refined before he died should be kept by me!” a powerful rogue cultivator said.

In the face of divine weapons, even the Mysterious Dark Sect of the four great sects was powerless.

Basically, everyone had the same thought that they would run away after obtaining the divine artifact. In this chaotic world, obtaining this peak tribulation divine artifact would definitely increase their strength by a significant level.

At this moment, they treated Qin Yu, whose legs were broken and spiritual energy exhausted, as a dead person.

“Get out of my way!”

Twenty or so handsome cultivators slowly descended from a massive and exquisite folding fan magical artifact.
