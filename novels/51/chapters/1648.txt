Chapter 1649: Chapter 1649, power of four symbols 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Great Dao surged, and the Golden Qi boiled. All the defenses were pierced through by this one!

Under the Golden Radiance, this fist was incomparably huge, and it smashed directly at the godly monarch’s body!

“Boom!”

His entire body was directly smashed through, and he crashed into the venerable fifth mountain behind him!

The mountain moved a few meters at this moment, and the godly monarch’s bones were crushed between the fists and the mountain!

The onlookers cried out in surprise, and some people shouted excitedly!

At this moment, Qin Yu was their hope! They had been oppressed by the northern lands for too long, and now, someone finally stood up!

The godly monarch dragged his broken body, his face filled with shock and unwillingness.

“In just a few days... how could he improve so quickly...”The Godly King roared in his heart!

He understood that he had completely underestimated Qin Yu!

No wonder he had the courage to challenge a young elementalist. It was all because of the support of this powerful combat strength!

“As expected of the godly king of the northern lands. He actually withstood this punch,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The godly monarch slowly stood up. His secret technique circulated as his body slowly healed.

The ice-cold expression on his face seemed to indicate his spell.

“I really underestimated you,”said the godly monarch coldly.

He opened his mouth and coughed out a mouthful of black blood, but the light above his head grew brighter and brighter.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He did not care about his spell at all.

As long as this godly monarch did not escape, he would definitely be killed today!

“A mere early-stage mighty figure possesses such terrifying combat strength. I’m very impressed by you,”said the godly monarch in a low voice.

“If we were at the same level, I’m afraid I would be killed by you in a single exchange.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “You talk too much nonsense.”

With that said, Qin Yu took another step forward, his fist striking out!

He did not want to give this godly monarch the slightest chance to escape. He only wanted to get rid of him as soon as possible!

At that moment, the godly monarch suddenly let out an angry roar and an endless amount of internal QI gushed out!

Above his head, there was actually a huge palace hanging up!

This palace was like a fairyland. It was very different from all his previous spells. It even formed an extremely distinct contrast!

How could the people of the northern lands cast such a holy spell? It was incomprehensible.

At a glance, it was clearly an immortal palace.

There were divine beasts soaring in the immortal palace, and there was the reflection of treasures, and Immortal Qi circulating.

But there was no human figure. It was like an illusory fairyland.

Qin Yu naturally did not know the origins of this immortal palace, nor did he know whether it was a spell or a magical artifact.

But it did not matter. As long as everything was destroyed, it would be enough!

The Golden Fist smashed fiercely towards the godly monarch!

At this moment, the godly monarch sat down. He pressed his palms together, and wisps of internal Qi floated out from between his brows, connecting with the immortal palace.

Just as Qin Yu’s fist was about to arrive, there was finally a reaction from the immortal palace.

The Divine Beast stretched out from the immortal palace. It was a huge black tortoise that was extremely fierce. Even Qin Yu’s fist was defeated at this moment. It was as if the Black Tortoise’s turtle shell had blocked this fierce attack.

Qin Yu frowned slightly, and a trace of surprise could not help but appear in his eyes.

What kind of spell was this? It was actually so strange and mysterious?

One had to know that Qin Yu’s punch was extremely powerful, enough to shatter the void! Even a small world would not be able to withstand it!

But the black tortoise that flew out of the Immortal Palace protected him!

“What is it?”Qin Yu frowned.

The godly monarch said coldly, “This is the art of four symbols. It was given to me by the Lord. What I have comprehended is just the tip of the iceberg.”

Art of four symbols?

How come he had never heard of it before? Could it also be from the immortal slaying sect? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu tried to ask Heavenly Blood Rainbow, but he knew nothing about it.

“It’s actually not the immortal slaying sect’s secret technique?”Qin Yu was somewhat surprised.

“Not necessarily. Back then, the dream of the immortal slaying sect was to ascend to immortality. It’s not strange that they created such a technique,”said heavenly blood rainbow.

Qin Yu looked coldly at the godly monarch. He clenched his fist again and a monstrous power erupted, smashing towards the godly monarch for the second time!

The black tortoise power appeared once again, protecting the godly monarch closely behind!

Before Qin Yu could be surprised, the Azure Dragon’s appearance appeared in the Immortal Palace!

A gigantic azure scaled claw came from all directions, as if a gigantic mountain range was charging over!

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. With a furious roar, he raised his hand and met the attack with a ten thousand spell breaking punch.

“Boom!”

The huge collision shattered the entire void!

The huge Dragon Claw was pushed back by the punch and retreated back into the immortal palace.

“Your physical body is really terrifying.”

Even the godly monarch could not help but sigh.

This technique was his final trump card. Up until now, he had never encountered such a situation.

“Even someone at the reversion void stage would not be able to do this,”the godly monarch said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered incessantly.

What he did not know was that Qin Yu’s physical body was the physical body of someone at the reversion void stage! Furthermore, it was a chaotic body at the reversion void stage!

Just based on the physical body alone, the reversion void stage could not be mentioned in the same breath!

“I still don’t believe it. No matter what technique you use, I will smash it for you!”Said Qin Yu coldly.

He stepped on the line word formula, and golden fists came in turn!

The area where the godly monarch was was turned into ruins. The black tortoise power kept condensing and then dissipated.

Under Qin Yu’s indiscriminate bombardment, the black tortoise power was shattered!

It shattered like pieces and was all returned to the Immortal Palace!

Without the protection of the black tortoise power, the godly monarch’s body could not withstand Qin Yu’s fist that came at him!

His body was smashed into minced meat. The stench of blood permeated the air. Not even his bones remained!

“He died just like that?”Qin Yu looked at the pool of blood and could not help but frown.

The surrounding crowd was also somewhat surprised.

The godly monarch of the northern lands died just like that? He was smashed to death just like that?

“That’s not right.”Qin Yu shook his head.

He looked at the Immortal Palace. It showed no signs of disappearing.

This made Qin Yu puzzled. He narrowed his eyes as though he was waiting for something.

“Whoosh!”

At that moment, the Immortal Palace sent down a divine fire!

The fiery red color covered the entire area. In the flames, the godly monarch, who had been reduced to a pulp, appeared once again!

“It’s the rebirth of a divine Phoenix from the Flames,”heavenly blood rainbow reminded.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He could not help but look at the immortal palace. He felt the strength of the immortal slaying sect even more!

What kind of sect were they? To be able to create such a terrifying technique!

The godly monarch looked coldly at Qin Yu. His eyes were filled with killing intent and coldness.

At this moment, his body emitted an extreme killing intent! It was extremely cold!

Soon, a huge scene appeared in the Immortal Palace again.

A snow-white palm stretched out from the immortal palace and headed straight for Qin Yu!

This palm was crystal clear, and it was abnormally white.

However, it was this jade-like hand that contained an extremely terrifying killing intent that made people tremble in fear!
