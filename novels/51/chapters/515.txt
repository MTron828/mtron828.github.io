Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache while feeling a little excited.

But he didn’t show it.

Since the man with the mustache wanted the bronze mirror so much, it was definitely not an ordinary object.

As for the demonic beast inner core, it wasn’t particularly difficult to find it.

Therefore, the initiative was still in Qin Yu’s hands.

“Don’t even think about the bronze mirror, but I can consider giving you two bronze plaques,” Qin Yu said.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “I just want the bronze mirror. I won’t exchange it with you for the bronze plaques.”

“Then forget it. I don’t lack demonic beast inner cores anyway,” Qin Yu muttered.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

The man with the mustache had an idea. At this moment, he suddenly pulled Qin Yu and muttered, “Alright, exchange it then.”

As he spoke, the man with the mustache began to take out the inner core from his Spatial Magic Artifact.

Not long after, three demon beast inner cores and eight thousand-year-old herbs appeared in the man with the mustache’s hand!

It had to be said that the man with the mustache wasn’t bragging.

He indeed knew the herbs needed for the Reincarnation Pill, and the treasures on him were indeed beyond imagination.

“Is that enough?” The man with the mustache reluctantly handed the goods to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Later, when we divide the treasures, I’ll give you more.”

“That’s more like it.” The man with the mustache was finally satisfied.

Qin Yu took the goods from him, then took out the two bronze plates and handed them to the man with the mustache.

“Alright, it’s time to divide the loot.” The man with the mustache licked his lips and looked around.

With a glance, he could see that there were countless treasures in the surroundings. There were all sorts of magical artifacts and many medicinal herbs.

Unfortunately, these medicinal herbs had lost their medicinal effects. To Qin Yu, they no longer had any value.

The two of them walked around and chose the treasures that they wanted.

Although the man with the mustache was greedy, he was extremely picky when choosing treasures.

It was difficult for an ordinary treasure to catch his eye.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry. He just stood by the side and waited quietly.

In the end, the man with the mustache only picked out three treasures:

A snow-white Genestone, a Kraft paper-shaped divine map, and an incense burner.

“Okay, I’m done,” the man with the mustache said in satisfaction.

Qin Yu took a look at the remaining treasure and immediately put it into his bag.

“Are you a rag collector?” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but ridicule.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “You don’t understand.”

In the future, Qin Yu might establish his own sect. These treasures would come in handy sooner or later.

After finishing all this, the man with the mustache looked at the Dragon Vein above and said in a low voice, “Unfortunately, I don’t have the chance to dig out the Bright Energy Grave on the Dragon Vein.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “That might not be the case.”

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “Those are people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Who would dare to provoke Xia Hang?”

After saying that, the man with the mustache prepared to leave with his treasures.

“What if I say that I can chase them away?”

At this time, Qin Yu’s voice came from behind.

The man with the mustache stopped in his tracks. He hurriedly turned around and said with a smile, “Is what you said true?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Of course.” Qin Yu nodded.

“But you’ll have to wait for a while.”

The man with the mustache said, “No problem. I can accompany you! But I’m afraid of death. I can’t provoke the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Alright, there’s no need for you to show up. You just need to open the tomb,” said Qin Yu.

The man with the mustache hurriedly nodded and said, “No problem! That’s my duty!”

Qin Yu no longer paid attention to the man with the mustache.

He raised his head to look at the Dragon Vein above, and couldn’t help but mutter to himself.

“If I’m not mistaken, the Dragon Vein has already begun to condense spiritual energy,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Not only do I want to obtain the treasure in the Bright Energy Grave, but I also want to absorb all the spiritual energy!”

All of this was in preparation for Qin Yu’s breakthrough to the Martial Marquis realm.

Then, Qin Yu took out the Phoenix Cauldron that the Pavilion Master had given him.

Then, he put all kinds of goods into the Phoenix Cauldron and began to refine the Reincarnation Pill.

Qin Yu was slightly nervous, because he didn’t know whether this five-thousand-year-old herb that had lost its medicinal effect would work or not.

Refining pills was an extremely tiring task. All of Qin Yu’s attention was on the pill cauldron.

For a moment, Qin Yu couldn’t feel anything around him.

At this moment, the man with the mustache was standing in the distance and staring at this scene.

“Chaotic body and purple spiritual fire. Who exactly is this person?” The man with the mustache said in a deep voice.

He stood there and stared in Qin Yu’s direction. No one knew what he was thinking.

Time flew by.

Under the support of the purple spiritual fire, the herbs in the pill furnace turned into thick juice.

And the next step was to form the pill.

Forming the pill was the most important part of the pill refining process, and the requirements for one’s mental state were extremely harsh.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu was somewhat nervous.

The flame in his palm started to become somewhat chaotic.

This wasn’t a good thing for pill refinement.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and tried his best to adjust his state of mind.

After an unknown amount of time, the flame in Qin Yu’s palm finally began to slowly calm down.

“Clatter!”

The medicinal herbs in the pill cauldron began to withdraw their juice!

The rich medicinal juice began to condense and take shape at this moment!

“Buzz!”

As rays of light lit up, the medicinal liquid within the pill cauldron formed a circle!

“Bang!”

A loud explosion sounded from within the pill cauldron!

Then, a pill landed in Qin Yu’s hand!

This pill was the Reincarnation Pill that Qin Yu had been looking for!

“I made the right bet!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief as he held onto this Reincarnation Pill.

While fiddling with the Reincarnation Pill, Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, “This way, I will be able to step into the true half-step Martial Marquis Realm!”

He didn’t waste any time and immediately swallowed the Reincarnation Pill.

In an instant, a magical power slowly rippled within Qin Yu’s dantian!

The Consummate realm began to slowly undergo changes.

The accumulated spiritual energy in Qin Yu’s body broke through the barrier of the Consummate realm in an instant, and his realm advanced rapidly!

“Consummate realm?” The man with the mustache not far away seemed to have seen something.

He stroked his chin and said in a low voice, “This guy will either be invincible in the world, or he will die without a burial ground.”

Buzz!

Qin Yu’s body flickered with rays of resplendent light!

His body turned into a transparent jade green color once again.

This light only lasted for a moment before it slowly disappeared.

In just half an hour, Qin Yu’s body had undergone many changes.

The spiritual power in his body was also rapidly surging!

An hour later, with the ground under Qin Yu as the center, a rippling light suddenly burst out!

The light rippled in all directions and the mountain rocks it passed through were instantly cut off!
