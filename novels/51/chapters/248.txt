Chapter 249: Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s words made people feel a little confused.

Wasn’t the internal qi he displayed that of an Inner Strength Master Hands? Could it be that he was hiding his strength?

“Stop pretending, Qin Yu. Are you trying to scare us?” Someone said coldly.

“Remember, no matter how strong you are, you are only an Inner Strength Master Hands. There is a limit to your strength.”

“Beating someone above your level is already your limit. You want to challenge so many of us? Only death awaits you!”

Faced with the ridicule of the crowd, Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his head and laugh.

“Hahahaha!” Qin Yu’s laughter sounded a little crazy!

“So many people want to kill me. I’m truly honored.” Qin Yu coldly glanced at the crowd.

“All of you, come at me together. I, Qin Yu, have nothing to fear!” A loud roar sounded!

Following that, one could see Qin Yu’s internal qi rising rapidly!

His strength had leaped from an Inner Strength Master Hands to that of an Inner Strength Past Master!

His monstrous power even caused the surroundings to rumble!

The terrifying pressure caused the crowd to be filled with fear!

“Qin Yu has indeed concealed his strength.” Someone muttered.

Duan Shi, Jing Lu, and the others frowned.

Qin Yu was actually an Inner Strength Past Master?

Just as everyone was feeling uneasy, Han Yilong sneered. “So what if he’s an Inner Strength Past Master? Do you think an Inner Strength Past Master like you can fight against so many of us?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at Han Yilong while sneering and said, “Is that so? How about this?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s strength rose again!

From an Inner Strength Past Master, he became a Inner Strength Grandmaster!

Inner Strength Grandmaster level 1, Inner Strength Grandmaster level 2, Inner Strength Grandmaster level 3...

Qin Yu actually became a level 3 Inner Strength Grandmaster from an Inner Strength Master Hands!

Surging spiritual power surrounded Qin Yu’s body.

Countless plants in the deep forest were uprooted!

Sand and stones flew everywhere, as if the end of the world was coming!

This was the strength of a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster!

“Mr. Qin has actually reached the realm of a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster!” Jiang Gu was both surprised and happy!

No wonder Qin Yu was so confident! The realm of a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster was indeed practically unparallelled!

“Oh no.”

Everyone was filled with terror.

Qin Yu was able to beat Zhang Hua at the Inner Strength Master Hands level. Now that he had stepped into the realm of a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster, what kind of terrifying level of strength did his strength reach?

“Young Master, be careful.” Han Yilong’s followers quickly shielded Han Yilong behind them.

Han Yilong, extremely furious, gritted his teeth!

He never expected that Qin Yu was actually a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster!

In mid-air, Qin Yu coldly swept his gaze across this group of people.

“I said, I will kill all of you.” Qin Yu cracked into a smile.

Below, everyone held their breath. No one dared to say anything.

After feeling the surging power from Qin Yu’s body, they began to regret it.

“Humph, it’s just a bluff,” Chen Meng said in a low voice.

“In that case, you can go first,” Han Yilong said coldly.

Chen Meng’s expression immediately changed. He said awkwardly, “Young Master Han, I... Let’s go together.”

“If you don’t attack, I’ll kill you right now!” Han Yilong shouted angrily.

As soon as he said this, Han Yilong’s two followers immediately looked at Chen Meng coldly.

Chen Meng was filled with regret. If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have shown off!

“Attack!” Han Yilong said angrily.

Chen Meng had no choice. He would die anyway. He could only brace himself and stand out.

“Qin Yu, we are both Inner Strength Grandmasters. Don’t think that I’m afraid of you. Let me tell you...”

Swoosh!

Before Chen Meng could finish his words, Qin Yu’s body vanished into thin air and appeared in front of him!

Intense pain was the only thing Chen Meng felt.

He only felt waves of warmth in his chest, as if something was flowing out.

Looking down, he saw that Qin Yu’s fist had already pierced through his body.

“How... how is this possible...” Chen Meng’s face was pale as he stared at his lower abdomen!

He didn’t even have time to react. He died just like that?

The surrounding people were all dumbfounded.

Wasn’t he a little too fast?

“Oh no, we’ve been tricked...” someone whispered.

They originally thought that Qin Yu was trapped in this deep mountain, but at this moment, they realized that they were the ones trapped!

“A Inner Strength Grandmaster is only so-so,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Chen Meng’s internal qi was quickly disappearing.

His life was clearly at its end.

“If I let you die just like that, that would be a waste,” Qin Yu laughed coldly.

After saying this, he raised his hand and smacked Chen Meng’s head!

“Heaven Swallowing Technique!”

Qin Yu roared angrily! The internal qi in Chen Meng’s body flowed out from Qin Yu’s palm!

“Ah!!!”

Chen Meng almost fainted from the piercing pain!

In less than half a second, Chen Meng’s Dantian had collapsed.

His death was extremely tragic. His eyeballs bulged out and his body dried up. He looked like a mummy.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically! They couldn’t help but retreat!

What kind of technique was this? He actually absorbed the inner strength of other people?

“How comfortable.” Qin Yu felt a wave of comfort in his body. In the eyes of other people, he looked like a demon!

After that, Qin Yu looked at the others coldly.

“It’s your turn.” Qin Yu sneered.

“This kid cultivates evil!” At this moment, someone shouted!

“This kind of evil technique absolutely can’t exist in this world. Everyone, attack together and kill him!”

Sorcery!

Even the neutral group had ugly expressions on their faces.

Qin Yu wouldn’t kill them together, would he?

After all, those who cultivated sorcery were all vicious!

Just as they were in a dilemma, Han Yilong’s people attacked!

“Everyone, attack together and kill him!”

“Boom!”

In an instant, waves of terrifying internal qi erupted from the scene!

This internal qi even caused the mountains in the distance to rumble as countless rocks rolled down!

“Let’s attack together!”

Dozens of figures rushed towards Qin Yu in an instant!

Qin Yu laughed coldly as he let out an angry roar. Surging spiritual power instantly surged out like a landslide!

“You guys want to kill me? Bring it on. What do I have to be afraid of?!” Qin Yu waved his hand as surging spiritual power instantly rushed towards the crowd!

“Boom!”

This was a huge collision, and countless explosions sounded in the air!

Many kinds of lights converged in the air, and the scene was extremely chaotic!

“Young Master, retreat quickly!” The servant beside Han Yilong quickly cast a spell to shield Han Yilong within it. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But even so, Han Yilong still felt the impact!

His face turned pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Ah!”

At this moment, someone in the air couldn’t hold on any longer, and was sent flying!

Following that, countless people retreated repeatedly while spitting out mouthfuls of blood!

Everyone was dumbstruck!

Just a single palm strike was enough to repel the combined forces of ten Inner Strength Grandmasters?

What kind of strength was this? How could there be such a huge gap between two people of the same realm?
