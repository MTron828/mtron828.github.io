Chapter 82: Yan Ruoxue Gets Kidnapped Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu looked at Uncle Wu for a while and finally sat down.

He really wanted to hear what Shen Yun would say.

“Qin Yu, I really didn’t expect you to grow so fast,” Uncle Wu said politely.

Shen Yun also lamented, “Young people nowadays really surprise us.”

Qin Yu glanced at Shen Yun and said, “If you have something to say, just say it. I’m very busy. I have something to do later.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Uncle Wu frowned slightly. It was obvious that he wasn’t satisfied with Qin Yu’s attitude.

However, in this kind of situation, he couldn’t say anything. He looked at Shen Yun.

Shen Yun coughed and said, “Qin Yu, from the beginning to the end, our Shen family didn’t do anything wrong.”

“You broke my son’s arm, and I didn’t take any drastic actions. So if you think about it carefully, we don’t seem to have any unresolvable enmity, right?” Shen Yun said with a smile.

Qin Yu looked at Shen Yun and said with an insincere smile, “Director Shen, is this what you mean? If I didn’t have the Soul Nourishment Pill, would you sit down and talk with me calmly now?”

Shen Yun laughed and said, “There is no absolute in everything.”

Qin Yu sneered.

He had long promised Yan Ruoxue that even if Shen Yun begged him, he would never give him a way out.

A person like Shen Yun would definitely backstab him once he got the chance.

Uncle Wu coughed and said, “There has to be an end to this matter. Today, everyone is sitting together for my sake. How about this?”

He paused for a moment, then pointed at Shen Yun and said, “Isn’t it beneficial for your families to work together to become more powerful and profit together?”

“Yes, yes, yes, I also have the same intention! With the strength of our Shen family and the Soul Nourishment Pill in your hands, we will definitely be able to become more powerful!” Shen Yun hurriedly raised his wine cup and said.

However, Qin Yu didn’t have the intention to toast him. Instead, he kept sneering.

“Shen Yun, what qualifications do you have to cooperate with me now?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Shen Yun’s expression instantly changed. He never thought that Qin Yu would say it so straightforwardly! He also never thought that Qin Yu would be so arrogant!

“Shen Yun, to tell you the truth, I can cure your son’s arm. Moreover, when we first met, I thought of treating your son’s arm,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“But unfortunately, your arrogant attitude made me change my mind.”

“Now, I don’t plan to have anything to do with you anymore.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Shen Yun hurriedly said with a bit of urgency, “Qin Yu, is what you said true? Can you really fix my son’s arm?”

“Absolutely true,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Shen Yun immediately became a bit excited.

His Adam’s apple bobbed and he said with some pleading, “Qin Yu, if you can cure my son’s arm, I’m willing to agree to anything!”

“I can give you 10% ... No, 30% of the company’s shares!” Shen Yun said anxiously.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I said that I absolutely won’t cooperate with you.”

Shen Yun gritted his teeth and said, “Let’s put aside the matter of cooperation for now. I beg you to cure my son’s arm!”

After saying that, Shen Yun actually stood up and knelt down to Qin Yu.

This surprised Qin Yu extremely.

He never expected that a person like Shen Yun would stoop to kneel down to him!

“He really loves his son dearly.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but lament inside.

He pondered over it for a moment and said, “I can cure your son’s arm, but... it’s impossible to cooperate unless you’re willing to work for me.”

Shen Yun gritted his teeth and said, “Okay, I promise you!”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Let your son come to my house tomorrow.”

“Of course! Of course!” Shen Yun stood up and thanked him repeatedly.

Uncle Wu, who was beside him, fell into deep thought.

At this moment, his impression of Qin Yu suddenly changed.

He originally thought that Qin Yu was just a good-for-nothing. However, through tonight’s dinner, Uncle Wu realized that this Qin Yu had a sense of decency and was extremely ambitious.

Facing the olive branch that the Shen family offered, he wasn’t the slightest bit tempted. Instead, he chose to annex the other party.

It might be too cruel for ordinary people, but in the business world, it was a necessary evil.

When done by a young man who had just entered the business world, this indeed surprised Uncle Wu.

“Then let’s hope everything goes smoothly!” Uncle Wu raised his wine glass and said with a smile.

This time, Qin Yu picked up his wine glass.

Just as he was about to clink glasses, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up his cell phone and saw that the caller was actually Yan Ruoxue’s secretary.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. He put down his wine glass and said politely, “Sorry, I have to take this call first.”

As soon as the call was connected, Qin Yu heard the secretary on the other end say anxiously, “Qin Yu, Miss Yan has been kidnapped!”

“What?!” Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed drastically. A murderous aura instantly filled the entire room!

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The secretary on the other end hurriedly recounted what had happened to Qin Yu.

“I’ve already informed all personnel in Jiangcheng, but we still haven’t found any trace of her,” the secretary said with some distress.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold. Anger instantly overcame him!

To Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue was the light of his life.

Qin Yu was willing to give up everything else, but he would never allow anyone to hurt Yan Ruoxue

He took a deep breath and said, “I’ll go over right now.”

“Qin Yu, what happened?” Uncle Wu asked after Qin Yu hung up the phone.

Qin Yu didn’t have time to explain to them, so he looked at Uncle Wu and said, “Lend me your car.”

“Huh? If there’s an emergency, I’ll get someone to send you there,” Uncle Wu said.

“No need.” Qin Yu didn’t bother to explain. He picked up the keys on the table and turned to leave.

On the way, Qin Yu frantically rushed to the Yan family’s manor. He stepped on the accelerator so forcefully that it was almost broken, and he drove through countless traffic lights.

The passers-by cursed at Qin Yu and treated him as a drag racer.

After Qin Yu left, Uncle Wu received a phone call and got the news.

After he hung up the phone, Uncle Wu’s expression was extremely ugly.

“What happened?” Shen Yun asked in confusion.

Uncle Wu took a deep breath and said in a sullen voice, “Someone kidnapped Yan Ruoxue.”

“What?!” Hearing this, Shen Yun suddenly stood up!

“Who... who is so bold? Do they want to get themselves killed?” Shen Yun widened his eyes and said in shock.

Uncle Wu didn’t say anything. He just sighed and said, “I’m afraid things are going to change in Jiangcheng.”
