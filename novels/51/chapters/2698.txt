Although it had only been a day or two since he came down, it gave Qin Yu an extremely oppressive feeling in this deep underground place.

Moreover, this was filled with strong baleful aura, resentment, and the power that intersected with the dark energy. This made his body extremely uncomfortable.

At this moment, it would probably be better to find a stranger to chat with.

A roasted meat smell was emitted.

When Qin Yu entered the room, his pupils immediately became extremely terrified.

At this moment, he finally understood what the five of them meant.

A very young girl was tied up in the middle of the roof.

In front of the girl was a boy whose eyes had been dug out.

The boy let out a shriveled, miserable howl as if his vocal cords had long been rendered silent from crying.

A mournful expression appeared on the girl’s face, but the acupuncture points in her body seemed to be frozen. She couldn’t move at all.

At this moment, one of her snow-white thighs had already been cut off piece by piece.

What they said earlier was to use extreme fear as a guide to determine if the meat was more tender!

On the plate in the middle, pieces of meat made sizzling sounds.

The four men and one woman laughed ear-piercingly in the middle.

On their snow-white clothes, the dragon statues filled with righteousness seemed especially ridiculous in Qin Yu’s eyes. “Who are you? Are you new?”

A middle-aged man who was drunk asked Qin Yu.

“No, big brother. This kid is an outsider. Where did you escape from?”

One of the men had a vicious smile on his face. He took out a short blade and staggered towards Qin Yu.

“Hahaha! This woman is about to die. We can wash this kid up and play.”

When the woman saw Qin Yu, her eyes suddenly lit up.

“Hong NV, you’re too greedy. Can’t the four of us satisfy you?”

The few of them laughed and chatted, treating Qin Yu as a refugee from the mine. They met many such people every day, so they were not surprised.

“By the way, this kid’s face is very handsome. It’s just a little inferior to my brother. ”

The youth holding the broken blade staggered to Qin Yu.

“That won’t do. This mine doesn’t allow such a handsome person to exist. Fourth Bro, cut off his face!”

Chi!

A saber light slashed out, and this person was cut off at the waist.

Before his body landed on the ground, Qin Yu had already walked towards the other four people.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The strongest here was only the Dao Realm level 3. The outcome of facing Qin Yu was obvious.

In less than a few seconds, Qin Yu had cut their feet off.

“You can’t kill us. You can’t escape from this Endless Mine! We have a way to contact each node. If there’s a problem, the courtyard will immediately come to check! If you dare to kill us, you’re dead!”

The woman said mournfully.

At this moment, Qin Yu was as terrifying as a demon god in his eyes.

All along, they had been the ones who mastered the life and death of this group of miners. Now that the situation had suddenly turned around, they felt like they were living in a dream.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you.”

Qin Yu looked at them and almost squeezed out each word.

The tiger wing flashed in his hand, and the hanging woman fell to the ground.

When she fell, she let out a howl that didn’t sound like a human’s.

She rolled and pounced on the woman, then tore out her intestines and dug out her eyes.

She was like a wild beast.

“Help! I was wrong! I was wrong!”

The woman started to feel extremely twisted from the initial shock.

Especially when she met the eyes of the woman who had just been tortured, she was so scared that her face twisted.

“Just kill me!”

The woman was like a wild beast, biting off the skin of the person under her.

Qin Yu sighed and carried the boy whose eyes had been dug out.

The boy’s body was very light as if he was weightless.

Qin Yu did not know if he was scared silly, but he did not see any change in his expression.

“You’re fine. You’re fine!”

Qin Yu gently patted the boy’s back while gently covering his ears.

Shrill and terrified screams came from inside the house.

However, the cry at this moment sounded very pleasant to Qin Yu’s ears.

It was unknown how long it took for the voice inside the door to weaken and finally disappear.

Qin Yu placed the boy on the spot and slowly pushed the door.

The house was in a mess.

The ground was covered in pieces of flesh that had been bitten off. The bodies of the five people who had died were no longer complete.

As for that poor woman, she had stabbed herself in the throat.

She had already broken down and committed suicide after venting her anger.

Qin Yu gently closed her eyes, hoping that she could rest in peace.

However, the woman’s eyes still didn’t close no matter how hard he tried.

“I will take your child out of this purgatory. I won’t leave any of these scumbags behind!”

Qin Yu bent and whispered into the woman’s ear.

When Qin Yu pushed open the door and walked out, the woman’s eyes slowly closed. A line of bloody tears slowly seeped out from the corner of her eyes.

Qin Yu sighed. He picked up the little boy and continued to move forward.

It was already rare for her to persevere until she killed all five of the beasts before committing suicide.

Her child’s eyes were dug out in front of her, but she was helpless.

Qin Yu could not help but shiver when he imagined he was the woman.

In this kind of underground mine, these people were at the lowest level of the Path of Heaven Academy.

They had been stationed there for hundreds of years and their mind had probably been distorted. They could only abuse the mine slaves who were at a lower level than them.

If it were under the sun, perhaps there would not be such a distorted thing in the name of justice.

However, the evil of human nature was magnified to the extreme in this space tens of thousands of meters underground.

The boy struggled in Qin Yu’s arms. As soon as Qin Yu put him down, he ran forward.

Qin Yu was afraid that something would happen to him, so he quickly followed him.

With the appearance of this space, it was obvious that a large number of copper-gold ores had appeared around the mine ahead.

Moreover, the sound of metal knocking could be heard. A group of mine slaves appeared in front of Qin Yu.

rlX’V0 people behind the group of mine slaves, smiling at them.

Pa!

A crisp whip landed on a person’s thigh. This huge force even caused his thigh to fracture.

“Trash! You two bury him!”

He pointed using the whip in his hand at the two people beside him and shouted.

The surrounding miners seemed to have become numb to this scene. They did not even turn their heads.
