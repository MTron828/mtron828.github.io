1974 Another Storm

After hearing the news, Qin Yu could not help but knit his brow tightly.

Demon race? It had been a long time since he last heard this name.

It seemed that after coming to Holy Region, Qin Yu had never encountered a demon who had cultivated into a human form.

Qin Yu was sitting in a teahouse, quietly listening to their discussion.

!!

Ever since the incident, everyone seemed to have paid lesser attention to Qin Yu now. Almost all the people in the teahouse were talking about this matter.

“That man was young. Rumor has it that he’s only about 300 years old. He shows no mercy at all when he makes a move!”

“That’s right. Rumor has it that two heirs of the aristocratic families have died at his hands!”

“Where does the demon race come from?”

“I heard that he has a pair of wings and can fly hundreds of stars with a single flap of his arms. His speed is tremendously fast, and he’s not afraid of the aristocratic families at all!”

“Rumor also has it that this person is probably from the depths of Azure Rock Forest. Otherwise, he can’t have such terrifying strength.”

“But why did he attack the heirs of the nine great aristocratic families? It doesn’t seem to make sense.”

“Who knows? Maybe he wants to take the opportunity to mark his debut.”

Hearing what everyone said, Qin Yu was even more shocked.

Did he come out from the depths of Azure Rock Forest? Could it be that the mysterious existences living in the depths of the Azure Rock Forest had planned to come out?

Qin Yu got up and walked to the centre of the crowd. Then he asked tentatively, “My friend, do you know the name of the person who attacked?”

The other party was about to say something but kept quiet when he saw Qin Yu’s face.

“Qin Yu, you’re so lucky,” the person beside him said with a smile. “I don’t think the Si family has the time to deal with you now.”

“Oh? Why?” Qin Yu was puzzled and asked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Because the one who died was an heir of the Si family. He was an heir slightly inferior to Si Shifeng and was tremendously powerful,” the other party said.

“Sigh! I heard this young man is going to attack several Holy Sons. Now, all day they don’t dare to go out.”

Qin Yu fell silent. He didn’t know the purpose of this demon race that had attacked.

Qin Yu was not worried if they only targeted the heirs of the nine aristocratic families.

However, it would be troublesome if he attacked the young talents in the world. At that time, it would also be difficult for Qin Yu to escape.

This matter continued to ferment, and soon, it triggered the wrath of the nine aristocratic families.

Rumor had it that the nine great aristocratic families had sent out dozens of experts to kill this man!

Thus Qin Yu felt much more relaxed. The Si family probably wouldn’t have time to come to him.

On the same day, Qin Yu arrived at the largest market place in Sky City.

The people who showed up in this market place were all important people with strong backgrounds.

Qin Yu didn’t act humbly. He planned to sell more majority of the ores. As for the remaining, he planned to look for an opportunity to forge a Saint Weapon.

Qin Yu wouldn’t have to worry so much if he had a Saint Weapon with him.

The ore had quite a high value. Although everyone knew about the feud between Qin Yu and the Si family, it was sold out very quickly under such tremendous temptation.

Qin Yu had earned tens of billions of spirit coins just from selling the ores this time. Although his financial resources could not be compared with the nine great aristocratic families, ordinary small aristocratic families might not be richer than him.

After selling the ores, it was getting dark. Qin Yu did not stay and immediately returned to his accommodation.

The following day, Qin Yu didn’t rush to look for herbs. Instead, he planned to rest for a while.

With the help of Master Yun’s pills, Qin Yu’s injuries had basically already recovered. However, he would probably need to rest for a while if she wanted to return to his peak condition.

In the following days, Holy Region was in turmoil.

In mere nine days, the mysterious demon race attacked again. This time, his target was the Ni family, one of the nine great aristocratic families!

Rumor had it that the eldest son of the Ni family, Ni Rushui, had encountered this mysterious man from the demon race when he was out training. A big battle broke out between the two, and in the end, Ni Rushui was no match for him. He bled profusely and died!

As soon as this news spread, the entire Holy Region was shocked!

Although he had attacked previously, he had only killed those of the lesser-known bloodlines. Now that he had attacked the eldest son of the Ni family, it meant he didn’t care about the so-called noble bloodlines. If he encountered the Holy Son, he would also attack!

Soon, the nine great aristocratic families were in animated discussions. Some even prepared to send out True Saints to kill the mysterious demon!

Qin Yu could not help but be greatly shocked after hearing the news.

For so many years, no one had dared to challenge the prestige of the Holy Region.

Not to mention killing the Holy Son, no one didn’t even dare to attack them!

“He’s really fierce! He’s a truly fierce person!”

“This demon can’t be planning to attack the entire human race, right?”

“Who knows? Whether it’s a blessing or a curse, no one can tell.”

“If the nine great aristocratic families can’t get rid of this person as soon as possible, their prestige in the future will be impacted.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu nodded silently. Just as they had said, the demon race’s attack at least showed that the nine great aristocratic families were not invincible. They could also fall.

“Phew, you’ve indeed helped me a lot,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At the same time, Qin Yu was a little worried.

Would that mysterious person from the demon race attack Yan Ruoxue? It would be troublesome if that were the case.

“I should also take this opportunity to cultivate,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

On the same day, Qin Yu brought a huge amount of money with him to the largest auction in Sky City.

...

He had chosen auction because most real treasures emerged in auctions and gambling houses. As for the herbs of the Alchemist Association, their value could not compare with the ones found in the auction, although they were not ordinary.

“The same pill, under different materials and methods, will have completely different conditions when it’s produced,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He stood at the entrance of the auction house, thought for a moment, and then stepped in.

Sky City was the center of the Holy Region, so it would definitely enjoy the top-notch resources.

The nine great aristocratic families had reserved Sky City because, apart from the existence of Great Xia, they also wanted to control all the treasures in the world.

Therefore, this auction could be said to be full of hidden talents. Although there were only less than a hundred of them, each had an extraordinary identity.

Even Qin Yu’s entry didn’t cause any commotion. They didn’t care about the matter between Qin Yu and the Si family.

Qin Yu found himself a seat and sat down, quietly waiting for the auction to begin.

After a while, more people came in from outside. Qin Yu glanced around and found these people to have strange expressions, and fog covered their faces.

“Buzz!”

As the auction began, all the surrounding corners started to shine. Upon closer look, there were Saint Weapons one after another.
