Chapter 402: Step Into the Inner Strength Grandmaster Realm! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Light suddenly appeared in the sky, and like a sharp blade, it pointed straight at the huge pit!

When they saw this scene, everyone’s faces turned pale with shock!

“This... This is the scene of a treasure being born!” Someone exclaimed!

Even Yan Haoran couldn’t help but nod slightly. He said with admiration, “Listen well. I, Yan Haoran, will remember your great contribution!”

In the huge pit, Qin Yu completely ignored him.

He sat cross-legged in the huge pit to receive the heavenly tribulation.

To Qin Yu, this breakthrough was undoubtedly the most important thing.

As long as he stepped into the realm of an Inner Strength Grandmaster, Qin Yu would be invincible amongst those below the Martial Marquis realm.

Rumble..

Muffled thunder began to sound in the sky!

This heavenly tribulation seemed to be even stronger than before! It had the power to split the heavens and earth apart!

Normally, one would need to rely on external objects to overcome the heavenly tribulation of this kind of breakthrough.

However, Qin Yu had no intention of doing so. He revealed his upper body’s firm muscles!

He was prepared to use his physical body to forcefully resist this heavenly tribulation!

Crack!

Finally, the first heavenly tribulation descended! It landed squarely on Qin Yu’s body!

White marks appeared on Qin Yu’s body one after another!

However, Qin Yu’s expression was calm, as if he had already been prepared.

Not far away, Xiao Yu was hiding behind a rock while watching this scene in shock.

Such a scene was unprecedented!

“Boom!”

Another heavenly tribulation descended. This time, Qin Yu’s physical body was split open!

But what was shocking was that Qin Yu’s face still didn’t have the slightest change in expression!

He even stood up from the ground and spread his body open to allow the heavenly tribulation to baptize him!

One after another, muffled thunderbolts fell continuously while turning this huge pit into a sea of lightning!

Qin Yu simply laid in this sea of lightning and bathed his body in lightning!

“If I succeed in using the heavenly tribulation to forge my body, my body will be even tougher.” Qin Yu endured the pain that came from all over as he muttered in a low voice.

If others heard this, they would definitely be greatly shocked!

The heavenly tribulation was a disaster that anyone would try their best to avoid!

However, Qin Yu treated this heavenly tribulation as an opportunity to fortify his own body!

How arrogant was he?!

The heavens seemed to have heard Qin Yu’s inner thoughts as the heavenly tribulation that descended became even stronger!

Even the huge pit in the surroundings began to rumble, as if it was about to be shattered!

The heavenly tribulation’s continuous process was beyond everyone’s imagination. Countless heavenly tribulations continued endlessly and smashed into the huge pit.

The huge pit shook many times, but there were no signs of it collapsing!

“As expected of the birth of a treasure. The heavenly tribulation is actually so terrifying!” Above, Jing Shihong couldn’t help but gasp.

Yan Haoran also analyzed calmly, “That’s right. Judging from the scale of the heavenly tribulation, the treasure that was born is definitely not some ordinary item!”

His eyes revealed a hint of excitement. Such a powerful weapon was definitely like the icing on top of the cake to the Yan family!

“Have you noticed? Although the heavenly tribulation is powerful, this giant pit isn’t affected at all,” Mr. Tang said indifferently.

After his reminder, everyone finally noticed.

Looking at the intact huge pit, everyone couldn’t help but frown and say, “How could it be like this? Such a powerful heavenly tribulation is enough to destroy the world.”

“Hahaha!” Mr. Tang laughed heartily.

“I wonder if you’ve all heard of the saying, ‘His bite is worse than his bark,’ Mr. Tang said with a breezy smile and his hands behind his back.

Jing Shihong frowned and asked, “What do you mean?”

Mr. Tang pointed at the heavenly tribulation and said, “The heavenly tribulation looks mighty, but in fact, it’s just a bluff. It has no real power at all. Otherwise, this place would have been turned into ruins long ago.”

Jing Shihong was slightly surprised, then he kept nodding and said, “It makes sense!”

Although he said that, some people still didn’t believe him.

After all, this heavenly tribulation looked too terrifying. No one would believe that it didn’t have any power!

“It seems that you all don’t believe me,” Mr. Tang said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

“Then let me show it to you.”

After saying that, Mr. Tang actually took the initiative to walk toward the heavenly tribulation.

At this time, the heavenly tribulation was like a mountain peak that was inserted into the huge pit.

Mr. Tang stretched out his hand and said indifferently, “Everyone, watch carefully!”

After saying that, Mr. Tang stretched his hand into the heavenly tribulation.

“Boom!”

The moment he stretched his hand in, a shocking loud sound immediately sounded!

“Ah!!!”

In the next second, Mr. Tang’s wails could be heard!

The hand that he stretched into the heavenly tribulation turned into ashes! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“My hand!! My hand!!!” Mr. Tang laid on the ground in pain!

The crowd couldn’t help but snicker.

This fool lost his hand because of his desire to show off.

“Hehe, it seems that there’s a problem with Mr. Tang’s analysis,” Jing Shihong said with a hint of mockery.

Mr. Tang grimaced in pain. He didn’t expect the power of this heavenly tribulation to be so strong!

“It seems that the treasure that was born will shake the whole world!” The eager look in Yan Haoran’s eyes deepened!

Below, Qin Yu was bathing in the sea of lightning.

His body was almost burnt, and numerous sparkling white bones were revealed.

Every time his body was broken, it would be reconstructed in a short period of time!

Not far away, Xiao Yu had a worried look on her face, and she couldn’t bear to watch.

The heavenly tribulation had broken Qin Yu’s body countless times, and Qin Yu’s body was reconstructed again and again.

At this moment, it seemed that the Nine Transformation Golden Pill had also begun to play its role and carried out the remaining few revolutions!

Time passed minute by minute, but there was still no intention of the heavenly tribulation stopping in the huge pit.

“D*mn, it’s actually been so long,” Jing Shihong couldn’t help but curse.

Mr. Tang, who had lost his palm, still didn’t give up the opportunity to show off.

He looked at the huge pit and said indifferently, “According to my speculation, it should be ending soon. Under this huge heavenly tribulation, that kid is probably already dead.”

“If he dies, who will go down to retrieve the treasure?” Yan Haoran glanced at Mr. Tang coldly.

Mr. Tang quickly changed his words, “Of course, with that pure dark energy body accompanying him, he shouldn’t die.”

After the two mishaps, Mr. Tang’s trustworthiness in everyone’s hearts dropped rapidly.

No one believed what he said.

“Crack!!”

The last heavenly tribulation seemed to contain a long-lasting power as it smashed down fiercely!

This time, even the giant pit couldn’t withstand it!

And below, Qin Yu’s body was shattered!

“Qin Yu!” Seeing this, Xiao Yu couldn’t help but shout.

She ran to Qin Yu anxiously and said with a bit of fear, “Are you okay?”

There was a bright light in Qin Yu’s body.

Under this light, his body began to reassemble.

At this moment, the dark clouds in the sky began to dissipate.

This indicated that the heavenly tribulation was over.

“Did you guys hear someone shouting Qin Yu’s name just now?” Jing Shihong asked with a frown.
