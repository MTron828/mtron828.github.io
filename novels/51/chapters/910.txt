Chapter 911: Chapter 911, opening the secret realm! 

Gu Xinghe looked around coldly with a cold smile on his face.

“They... must be hiding here!”Gu Xinghe said in a low voice.

In the secret realm.

Qin Yu and Jiang he knew nothing about this.

They were still imparting the line formula of the nine secrets unhurriedly.

Qin Yu’s speed of comprehending the cultivation method was extremely fast. In just half a day, he had completely comprehended the last secret of the nine secrets.

Qin Yu slowly opened his eyes. He let out a long breath and said in a low voice, “With the ‘xing’formula, I can at least save my life.”

Jiang he, who was at the side, said, “Even if you have the ‘xing’formula, you might not be safe.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and asked with some confusion, “Why?”

Jiang he explained, “When you face a martial saint, if you are not careful, you might be sealed off.”

“At that time, no matter how fast you are, you will not be able to escape.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Jiang he’s words were indeed reasonable. The martial saint’s use of the space technique was already quite mature.

“Senior Jiang he, is there any way to resolve this?”Qin Yu asked.

Jiang he said in a deep voice, “We can only leave as soon as possible before they seal off the space.”

“I understand.”Qin Yu nodded.

Then, the two of them stopped talking and prepared to enter closed door cultivation to break through.

Jiang he’s talent was extremely high. It was only a matter of time before he wanted to become a martial saint.

On the other hand, Qin Yu planned to continue absorbing the Qi/spiritual energy here and bring his talent to its peak.

In the outside world.

Du Xuanyu was soon moved by this place.

“Young master Gu, what’s Wrong?”Du Xuanyu asked.

Gu Xinghe pointed at the blank space in front of him and said, “I suspect that there’s a secret realm here. Qin Yu’s internal Qi disappeared here.”

Hearing this, Du Xuanyu couldn’t help but laugh, “Impossible! I’ve investigated this place, but I didn’t find any secret realm.”

Gu Xinghe turned around and frowned, “Maybe I was careless last time?”

Du Xuanyu continued to wave his hand, “Impossible! Young Master Gu, I am very confident in my professionalism.”

Looking at du Xuanyu’s confident look, Gu Xinghe suddenly felt angry.

However, Du Xuanyu was not his subordinate, so he did not dare to act out.

Gu Xinghe took a deep breath and said, “Master Du, please investigate again. If you find anything...”

“I said, Impossible!”However, du Xuanyu rudely interrupted Gu Xinghe.

This completely infuriated Gu Xinghe!

He looked at du xuanyu coldly and said, “Du Xuanyu, don’t be so shameless...”

Hearing this, Du Xuanyu also said with some displeasure, “Gu Xinghe, pay attention to your attitude when you talk to me. I...”

“Whoosh!”

Before du Xuanyu could finish his words, Gu Xinghe grabbed du Xuanyu’s neck!

He lifted du Xuanyu up into the air and said coldly, “I know you’re sent by the higher-ups, but so what! If you force me into a corner, I can kill you at any time!”

“Wait until I kill you, then I’ll go and apologize to the higher-ups!”

The strength of Gu Xinghe’s hand grew stronger and stronger. Du Xuanyu’s face quickly turned red.

He looked at du Xuanyu in horror and struggled with both of his hands.

However, as a top-tier mystic realm master, his cultivation base was not high. It was not even worth mentioning in front of Gu Xinghe!

“Young Master Gu, forget it.”At this moment, Zhai Xing walked over.

Then, Zhai Xing glanced at du xuanyu and said, “Master Du, just listen to young master Gu’s orders. As long as you listen to him, he can let you go.”

Du Xuanyu blinked his eyes hurriedly to show his attitude.

Gu Xinghe snorted coldly and released du xuanyu.

Du Xuanyu, who had fallen to the ground, desperately breathed in the air.

Although he was very angry, he didn’t dare to flare up.

“Master Du, I’ll have to trouble you,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Du Xuanyu didn’t say anything more. He immediately stood up and continued to inspect the place according to Gu Xinghe’s request.

...

In the secret realm.

Qin Yu, who had his eyes slightly closed, was sweating profusely.

“No.”

A moment later, Qin Yu sighed.

He slowly stood up and muttered in a low voice, “With my current state of mind, even if I have qi/spiritual energy, I would not be able to increase my strength by even a little bit.”

Jiang he, who was standing at the side, also opened his eyes slightly.

He placed his hands behind his back and said quietly, “Indeed, stepping into the martial saint realm requires a long period of accumulation. It is almost impossible to achieve it in one go. This is also the reason why martial saints are so precious.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Senior Jiang he, I’ll leave this place to you. I should go out and train. It’s no longer beneficial to me.”

Jiang he did not say much about this. He only nodded and sat down again.

Qin Yu slowly walked towards the entrance of the mystery land and planned to leave.

However, at this moment, Li Yu rushed over from the side in a hurry.

“Oh no!”A trace of panic flashed across Li Yu’s face.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “What happened? Why are you so flustered?”

Li Yu trembled as he pointed towards the direction of the entrance and said anxiously, “Someone is trying to find the mystic realm! I can feel that it’s a top mystic realm master...”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly as he muttered softly, “Could it be... Du Xuanyu? !”

As he said that, the entrance in front of him suddenly flashed with a ray of light.

This ray of light immediately made Qin Yu and Li Yu take a step back. The fear on their faces also increased a little!
