Chapter 513: The True Treasure Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xia Hang merely moved his finger, and a force that was close to Qin Yu’s dantian erupted!

Qin Yu had no way of dodging since it was within a millimeter from him!

This force was powerful, and it ruthlessly smashed into Qin Yu’s dantian!

“Pu!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was instantly spat out from Qin Yu’s mouth!

The enormous force sent Qin Yu flying dozens of meters away!

His body smashed countless mountain rocks and slid all the way to the edge of the cliff!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s entire body slid down from the Dragon Vein and fell down the cliff!

Xia Hang, who was watching from afar, couldn’t help but sneer at this scene.

“President Xia, we’re just letting him run away?” Yan Yuqi couldn’t help but frown.

Xia Hang raised his eyebrows and sneered. “Run away? That power just now was enough to break his dantian. Where can he run to?”

Yan Yuqi frowned and said, “In other words... Qin Yu is now crippled?”

“That’s right. I really didn’t expect that there would be unexpected gains,” Xia Hang said indifferently.

However, Yan Yuqi snorted and said, “It’s a pity that I couldn’t kill him.”

Xia Hang glanced at Yan Yuqi.

“Alright, it’s time to see what treasures are inside,” Xia Hang said.

Everyone took out one treasure after another from the pit.

Among them, most of them were herbs, and each of these herbs was more than 1,000 years old.

There were more than eight herbs that were more than five thousand years old!

Xia Hang sized up everyone and said in a deep voice, “I want to use this opportunity to enter closed-door cultivation and strive to break through to the Martial Marquis realm in one go.”

“Break through to the Martial Marquis Realm?” Everyone couldn’t help but be stunned.

Xia Hang nodded slightly. “That’s right, I’m only a hair’s breadth away from the Martial Marquis realm, and now is the opportunity.”

He took a few herbs, then found a sacred ground and prepared to enter closed-door cultivation.

As for the others, they volunteered to protect Xia Hang.

...

Qin Yu’s body fell straight down from a mountain range of hundreds of meters!

Countless trees were broken, and in a moment, Qin Yu’s body was smashed to the ground! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Even though Qin Yu’s body was extremely tough, he still felt like his internal organs were about to be shattered from this free fall of hundreds of meters!

“F * ck...” blood dripped from the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth, and he was in extreme pain.

He reached out and touched his lower abdomen, only to see that a bloody hole had appeared in the position of his lower abdomen.

This made Qin Yu extremely uneasy. His expression was flustered as he hurriedly tried to activate the spiritual energy in his dantian.

Traces of spiritual energy burst out from his dantian.

And in his dantian, there seemed to be a golden light that shielded it from Xia Hang’s attack.

“Fortunately, My dantian isn’t damaged...” Qin Yu heaved a long sigh of relief.

He couldn’t help but fall into silence as he sat there.

“If I’m not mistaken, it’s probably my father’s technique again,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Back when he devoured the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor, his dantian almost exploded.

At that time, it was also this ray of golden light that protected him. This was the second time.

“Father, who exactly are you?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

“D*mn, what a pity for those herbs.” At this moment, Qin Yu thought of the pile of herbs hidden under the stone tablet.

“I didn’t expect you to discover it.”

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, a voice suddenly came from the side.

This gave Qin Yu a fright. He hurriedly turned around and saw the man with a mustache standing behind him with a hint of displeasure on his face.

“Why are you here?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

The man with the mustache snorted. “How could I not discover a secret that you could discover?”

“A secret?” Qin Yu was stunned.

He was about to ask, but quickly swallowed his words.

Then, Qin Yu stood up and braced himself while saying, “Of course. I’ve already discovered the secret here.”

The mustached man gave Qin Yu a thumbs up and said, “You’re really amazing. You actually found out earlier than me!”

At this point, the mustached man said with some flattery, “Then let’s make a deal. We’ll split it fifty-fifty. We can’t snatch it by force. We have to abide by the rules.”

Obviously, the mustached man thought that he was no match for Qin Yu, so he was afraid that Qin Yu would seize the “secret.”

How could Qin Yu know what the secret was? He quickly patted his chest and said, “Don’t worry, I, Qin Yu, am not that kind of person. We have to split it 50-50!”

“You’re a good buddy!” The mustached man gave Qin Yu a thumbs up.

“Then let’s set off now. Don’t waste time. If we delay, an accident might occur. I still have to go to my grandfather’s grave to visit,” the mustached man muttered.

“Alright.” Qin Yu was secretly delighted.

He followed behind the man with a mustache and strode forward.

There was a canyon beneath the mountain range. The scenery of this canyon wasn’t much different from the one above.

After advancing for several thousand meters, the man with a mustache finally stopped.

He saw that there was also a stone tablet in front of him! It was almost exactly the same as the stone tablet above!

Qin Yu hurriedly lay down in front of the stone tablet and carefully observed it.

As expected, even the words recorded on it were the same.

The only difference was that the stone tablet on it was completely white, while this stone tablet was completely black!

“So that’s how it is!”

Qin Yu’s mind spun rapidly. He seemed to have guessed something!

Then, Qin Yu reached out his hand and prepared to pull out this stone tablet.

The man with a mustache hurriedly stopped Qin Yu and shook his head. “It’s not appropriate to pull it out!”

Qin Yu stopped what he was doing.

He looked at the man with a mustache and said with a smile, “Why can’t I pull it out?”

The man with a mustache said in surprise, “If this stone tablet is pulled out, dark energy will definitely erupt! Don’t you know?!”

When Qin Yu heard this, the smile on the corner of his mouth became even wider.

“It’s just as I guessed,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

He looked at the mustached man and said, “If this stone tablet is removed, then the Dragon Vein will instantly erupt with spiritual energy, right?”

“Isn’t that obvious?!” The mustached man muttered.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the sky. Everything was clear at this moment!

This was clearly a Dragon Vein, but not a single trace of spiritual energy could be seen!

There was only one reason for this, and that was the mutual restriction of dark energy and bright energy to achieving a balance!

Above the Dragon Vein was bright energy, and below the Dragon Vein was dark energy!

Therefore, the area where the spiritual energy was supposed to be gushing out had become extremely ordinary!

If one looked down from the sky, one could even see the polar diagram in this terrain!

“This place was really created by an expert.” Qin Yu sighed slightly.

He looked at the man with the mustache and said seriously, “Thank you so much.”

“Huh?” The man with the mustache was stunned.

Before he could ask, Qin Yu had already summoned the golden light in his hand and smashed it fiercely at the stone tablet!
