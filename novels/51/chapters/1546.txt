Chapter 1547: Chapter 1,547, Divine Body 1

These two people, one old and one young, were dressed rather luxuriously. Their faces also carried a faintly discernible arrogance.

Very quickly, they walked in front of Qin Yu.

“Little friend, are you also here for the Qingyan Forest Auction?”The old man asked with a pleasant expression.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Not bad.”

The old man continued, “Looking at your clothes, you should be an itinerant cultivator. Let me introduce you. I am an elder of the beacon tower. My name is Li Feng.”

Qin Yu grunted and then asked, “What’s the matter?”

Li Feng smiled and said, “Young friend, our Beacon Tower is very interested in the green rock forest auction. However, due to our status, we are unable to enter. I wonder if you can help us find a few magical artifact? “Don’t worry, we will pay for it. After the matter is done, we will definitely reward you greatly!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu stood up and replied politely, “I’m sorry, I am also very interested in the green rock forest auction. If your sect is willing to pay for the things I like, I might consider it.”

“Kid, you are asking for too much!”The young man beside him shouted.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I only said my conditions. You guys can not agree to it. It’s just a price. Why are you angry?”

The young man opened his mouth and was about to speak, but was stopped by Li Feng.

Li Feng smiled and said, “Young friend, your conditions are indeed a little harsh. Forgive us for not agreeing, but... I’m willing to pay one million spirit coins. How about it?”

“I’m sorry, my conditions are already very clear.”Qin Yu shook his head and said.

......

“Kid, no one dares to reject my Beacon Tower!”The young man shouted again.

This time, the old man beside him didn’t stop him. He just slightly closed his eyes.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “So? What Beacon Tower? I’ve never heard of it.”

This time, even the old man couldn’t help it.

With a gloomy face, he said, “Little friend, you can refuse us, but it’s a bit too much to insult our beacon tower.”

“A person who humiliates others will always be humiliated. I think you should be clear about this principle,”Qin Yu said with a cold face.

“Little friend, we’re just unable to enter the Qingyan Forest auction due to our status. Is it so difficult to ask you for a favor?”Li Feng said with an unfriendly tone.

Qin Yu sneered, “Then why don’t you just withdraw from the Beacon Tower?”

“Brat, I think you are courting death!”The youth immediately flew into a rage, and a powerful internal Qi erupted from his body!

The old man beside him also had a sullen face and didn’t say a word. However, there was a faintly discernible killing intent from his body.

“What do you want?”Qin Yu asked.

The young man said coldly, “Today, you have to agree. If you don’t agree, you have to agree!”

Just as Qin Yu was about to get angry, an idea suddenly flashed through his mind.

Then, Qin Yu changed his expression and said with a smile, “If that’s the case, then I’ll agree to you.”

Hearing this, the two people thought that Qin Yu was afraid and immediately said, “A wise man submits to circumstances. Not bad.”

Qin Yu continued, “I wonder how much your sect plans to pay for this?”

The old man’s palm shook. He took out a card and handed it to Qin Yu.

“There are 100 million spirit coins in here. As long as it’s a magical artifact, we’ll take it,”the old man said.

“As for whether or not you can snatch it, that will depend on your ability.”

Qin Yu looked at the card and could not help but sneer in his heart.

He kept the card and nodded, “Alright, I’ll try my best.”

“That’s more like it.”The young man snorted.

The old man smiled and said, “I’ll wait for Your Good News Tomorrow.”

“Alright, no problem.”Qin Yu nodded and said.

After they left, Qin Yu played with the card and could not help but sneer.

In this day and age, there were still people who gave money away for free.

It just so happened that Qin Yu’s finances were a little tight. This was a pretty good way to earn money.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu simply stood up and asked each sect.

Qin Yu restrained his internal Qi and pretended to be a weakling.

As long as it was a domineering sect, Qin Yu didn’t let any of them go.

After one round, Qin Yu collected a total of eight hundred million spirit coins and promised them that he would do his best to fight for treasures for them.

Of course, this was all pure nonsense. Qin Yu had no intention of returning it at all.

“Eight hundred million spirit coins. I can be considered a rich man,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

With these eight hundred million spirit coins, the auction tomorrow would have some confidence.

...

The next day.

The Sky had just brightened when Qin Yu stood up and walked towards the auction.

At this time, many people had already gathered at the auction, waiting to enter.

About ten minutes later, Qin Yu finally walked into the auction house.

The decorations in the auction house were extremely ordinary. Its scale was even inferior to that of Gu City’s auction house.

However, in this auction house, Qin Yu could feel an indistinct and mysterious internal QI.

This internal Qi could not be said to be powerful, but it made people feel fear from the bottom of their hearts.

Perhaps it was because of this reason that so many sects did not dare to rashly enter.

Qin Yu found a seat and sat down, waiting for the auction to begin.

About ten minutes later, an extremely tall man appeared on the stage.

This person was at least three meters tall, and the muscles on his body were extremely thick.

Although Qin Yu could not sense the internal Qi on his body, just his appearance still shocked Qin Yu.

“Could it be that... some kind of tribe lives in the depths of the Green Rock Forest?”Qin Yu speculated in his heart.

The people on the stage clearly looked different from ordinary cultivators, and one couldn’t help but suspect their origins.

A moment later, the door slowly closed, and on the stage, three similarly tall men appeared.

They stood at the back, not saying a word, as if they were waiting for something.

A few minutes later, a woman wearing a cheongsam walked out.

This Woman’s appearance was full of charm, and her height was at least 1.75 meters. Among the women, she was considered an extremely tall person.

“Welcome to the Qingyan Forest Auction,”the woman said from above.

“I am the host of this auction. My name is Xia Ze.”

Then, Xia ze read out the rules of this auction.

For example, one could not fight among themselves in the auction. The rules were not much different from ordinary auctions.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and the doubts in his heart grew stronger.

In his heart, he even had a bold idea.

After Xia ze finished reading, he slowly retreated to the side.

The tall and strong men also carried a huge bronze box.

The box was extremely huge, like a coffin.

Although it was far away, one could still feel the internal Qi from the coffin.

“The first item is a corpse,”Xia ze said.

As soon as he said this, there was an uproar.

Everyone was stunned.

A corpse? The first item up for auction was actually a corpse?

“This corpse isn’t an ordinary body, but a divine body. Moreover, when it was alive, it was at the reversion void stage,”Xia ze said with a smile.
