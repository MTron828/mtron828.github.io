For Dong Tianhai, the Martial Arts Association’s greatest use was that it was official.

In other words, the Martial Arts Association had a certain amount of prestige among the major families. No one was willing to shed all pretense of cordiality with them.

Of course, the top aristocratic families in Jingdu were excluded.

Time flew by.

Soon, the day of the birth of the Divine Medicine arrived.

On this day, auspicious clouds floated in the sky of Bai City.

The auspicious clouds were a purple color. Although the light wasn’t strong, it was still visible to the naked eye.

Such a scene naturally attracted countless gazes.

Whether it was ordinary people or the martial artists who coveted the Divine Medicine, they all raised their heads to look at the sky.

“This is a good omen!”

“God bless Bai City!”

“I will definitely make a fortune this year!”

Many people knelt on the ground and kowtowed to the sky three times in an extremely respectful manner.

The martial artists were even more excited!

“Rumor has it that a thousand-year-old Divine Medicine can trigger a certain mind-blowing phenomenon. Seeing it today, it is indeed as impressive as we expected,” some martial artists murmured.

They didn’t dare to waste time and immediately ran in the direction where the Divine Medicine would be born.

The place where the Divine Medicine would be born was in a deep mountain.

Usually, there were few people here, but the trees were lush.

Under the nourishment of the Divine Medicine, all kinds of fierce beasts also moved around here.

But today, the area near this deep mountain was parked with luxury cars.

The license plates were of different provinces and cities. As far as the eye could see, there were at least close to a hundred people waiting.

“Yao Qing, remember to look after those herbs for me.” Before Qin Yu left, he reminded Yao Qing profusely.

Yao Qing was a little impatient. He waved his hand and said, “Alright, alright, I got it. Hurry up and go.”

Jiang Gu, who was at the side, was a little worried.

After hesitating for a while, he finally advised, “Mr. Qin, are you really going? Although the value of the Divine Medicine is high, life is more important...”

Qin Yu glanced at Jiang Gu and said with a smile, “If you’re afraid, you don’t have to go.”

Jiang Gu said with a bitter smile, “I’m not afraid. I... sigh, forget it.”

Seeing how stubborn Qin Yu was, Jiang Gu didn’t say anything else.

The car sped along and soon arrived at the entrance of this deep mountain.

Looking at the people all over the mountain, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh and say, “As expected of a thousand-year-old Divine Medicine. Normally, I can’t even see one martial artist, but today, a bunch of them have appeared.”

After saying this, Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Even the air smells nice. As expected of a Divine Medicine.” Qin Yu had a look of enjoyment.

Jiang Gu didn’t have Qin Yu’s leisurely mood. He immediately released his divine sense and looked around.

Soon, Jiang Gu’s expression darkened.

Because he discovered that among these people, there were at least ten or so Inner Strength Grandmasters, and there were countless Inner Strength Past Masters!

The strongest among them had even reached the realm of a fourth grade Inner Strength Grandmaster!

“I’m afraid we’ll be in trouble today. Mr. Qin, we’d better keep a low profile,” Jiang Gu reminded softly from the side.

“Huh? The King of Chuzhou, Qin Yu, is here too?” As soon as Jiang Gu finished speaking, someone shouted from not far away.

This shout immediately attracted countless gazes.

Almost everyone turned to look in Qin Yu’s direction.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel troubled.

This title really brought him a lot of trouble.

This didn’t conform to Qin Yu’s low-key personality.

“He is the King of Chuzhou? It’s rare to see someone called king at such a young age.”

“Yeah, I heard that Ye Qing also had this title back then.”

“Haha, comparing him to Ye Qing is a bit too far fetched. Ye Qing is a genius that appears once in a hundred years.”

Qin Yu didn’t want to reveal his strength too quickly. Otherwise, he would attract unnecessary trouble.

Therefore, Qin Yu deliberately restrained his internal qi. At a glance, he was no different from an ordinary Inner Strength Master Hands.

At this moment, a few young men walked toward Qin Yu.

They weren’t old, and appeared to be in their twenties.

Three of them were men, and one was a woman.

The men all seemed elegant, and the woman was enchanting. She was drop dead gorgeous.

“That woman is Fang Yue, who is known as the most beautiful woman in the Jiang Bei region?”

“Rumor has it that no man can resist Fang Yue’s charm. She really lives up to her reputation!”

“Tsk tsk, her sexy figure really makes people unable to control themselves.”

Everyone looked at the woman and swallowed hard.

“The four great geniuses of the Jiang Bei region? They actually came as well?” Upon seeing these four people, Jiang Gu frowned slightly.

“Oh really? The four great geniuses of the Jiang Bei region?” Qin Yu was quite interested in this title.

Jiang Gu nodded and said, “These four people are the most talented martial artists in the Jiang Bei region in recent years. The wealthy families supporting them can’t be underestimated.”

Then, Jiang Gu pointed at the young man leading the group and said, “This person is called Jing Lu. He advanced to the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm three years ago.”

After saying that, Jiang Gu pointed at the enchanting woman and said, “Among the four of them, this woman named Fang Yue is the most dangerous. Rumor has it that she doesn’t have any powerful background, but her strength is beyond imagination.”

Qin Yu nodded silently and sized up Fang Yue.

It had to be said that Fang Yue’s appearance was indeed quite attractive. She was curvy at all the right places, yet slender at the same time.

What surprised Qin Yu the most was that Fang Yue’s body had a natural charm that made it difficult for people to resist.

“Strange.” Qin Yu touched his chin.

“Fang Yue’s internal qi... is a little strange.”

At this moment, a few people had already arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“You’re Qin Yu?” Jing Lu was the first to speak.

Qin Yu nodded as a form of greeting.

“King of Chuzhou? What a lofty title! I just don’t know if you have any real abilities!” An extremely burly young man beside Jing Lu snorted coldly.

“Since you’re called King of Chuzhou, you must be quite powerful. Compared to Mr. Qin, our title as the four geniuses instantly pale in comparison,” Jing Lu said indifferently.

“Hehe, is that so? I, Duan Shi, really want to experience it!” The brawny man rubbed his fist and said coldly.

The moment they met, they were already at odds. This gave Jiang Gu a headache.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, looked calm, as if he had already expected this before.

“Sigh, Mr. Qin, don’t be angry. Duan Shi is called a genius of the present age, but even he didn’t receive the title of King. It’s only natural that he feels indignant inside. However, I guess... that Mr. Qin’s strength is definitely above that of the four of us,” Jing Lu said while pretending to be regretful.

Jing Lu seemed to be trying to mediate the fight, but in fact, he was deliberately deepening the animosity between the two of them.

In other words, Jing Lu wanted to use Duan Shi to test Qin Yu.

As expected, as soon as he said this, Duan Shi became even more unconvinced.

He clenched his fist and said, “Qin Yu, do you dare to spar with me? Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you!”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and didn’t speak for a long time.

“Mr. Duan, Qin Yu is the King of Chuzhou after all, so how can he fight just anyone?” Jing Lu saw that Qin Yu didn’t speak, so he continued to add fuel to the flames.

When he heard this, Duan Shi couldn’t hold it in anymore.

He rubbed his fist and said, “The King of Chuzhou, right? I want to see how powerful you are as the King of Chuzhou!”

After saying that, Duan Shi roared angrily and strode forward. His powerful fist came straight at Qin Yu!
