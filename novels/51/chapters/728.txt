Qin Yu picked up his phone and didn’t continue reading.

As to who would win between Blackie and Jiang He, Qin Yu didn’t know, but he was more inclined towards Jiang He.

As more and more secrets were revealed, Qin Yu slowly realized that Jiang He definitely wasn’t the strongest person in the Pyro, and neither was Ye Qing.

They were only the strongest people on the surface, but no one knew how many powerhouses were hidden in the shadows.

Just like the last time at the Han Palace, they had casually sent out a Martial Marquis, and even a Martial Marquis at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!

God knows how many powerhouses were hiding behind them!

After more than ten minutes, they boarded the plane and headed to Tang City.

Tang City was at the border, so it took them seven hours to reach Tang City.

When they arrived, it was already night.

It was winter now, but when they got off the plane, they could still feel waves of heat.

Short skirts and short sleeves could be seen everywhere on the streets. There was no winter scene at all.

“The environment of Tang City is really nice.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and felt the waves of sea breeze.

It had to be said that Tang City was indeed a holy resort.

“Xiao Yu, do you want to go to the beach to play?” Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu shook her head and said, “I’m not interested.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but glance at her.

Xiao Yu really seemed like a different person from the Xiao Yu from back then.

“Gee, there seems to be a banquet over there. Let’s go and play,” the man with the mustache said excitedly.

In the direction of the man with the mustache’s finger, sure enough, on the beach not far away, there was singing, dancing, and drumming.

“It seems that someone is holding a banquet,” said Qin Yu.

The man with the mustache muttered, “Don’t you know that this Tang City is known as a paradise for the rich? Many rich second-generation children will come here to show off their wealth.”

“Racing cars, horse races, and large-scale parties are all common here.”

“Many big stars will be invited to appear.”

Qin Yu wasn’t very interested in this.

He took out the map that Hong Yi Sect had given him and compared it carefully.

The place where the herbs would be born wasn’t far from here.

And according to the time that Ning Kun said, there was just one week left before the herbs would be born.

“Let’s go and take a look,” said Qin Yu.

The man with the mustache hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, okay. I’ll go and eat something. Damn it, I rarely get to eat when following you.”

Thus, the three of them walked towards the banquet.

This banquet was a public one and almost everyone could attend it.

The banquet venue was filled with delicious food and fine wine. Many young men and women were dancing.

Xiao Yu didn’t seem to be interested in these things. She pulled Qin Yu to find a place to sit down.

The man with the mustache even ran to dance with a young girl.

“Don’t you like racing?” Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and said with a smile.

Xiao Yu said, “That was in the past. Now, I think it’s quite childish.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but spread his hands.

That was true. If Xiao Yu really awakened her memory, racing was indeed very childish to her.

“I really suspect that the masked woman and Xiao Yu are two different people.” Qin Yu felt that something wasn’t right.

If Xiao Yu was the reincarnator of the masked woman, then her personality shouldn’t have changed. At least, the contrast wouldn’t be so great.

“It’s really strange.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Then, Qin Yu scanned the surroundings.

He released his divine sense and covered more than half of the banquet.

Soon, Qin Yu realized that something was wrong.

This banquet seemed to be filled with joy and harmony, as if everyone had integrated into this secular life.

However, Qin Yu discovered that there were many martial artists hidden in this banquet!

Among them, there were eighteen Inner Strength Grandmasters, and more than twenty Martial Marquis. There were even three people whose strength Qin Yu was unable to see through!

This was enough to prove that the three people’s strength was above Qin Yu’s!

Qin Yu retracted his divine sense, but discovered that there were several divine senses sweeping over his body.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed, and he immediately looked in a certain direction.

He saw that in front of the wine table, there was a young man coldly looking at Qin Yu.

Their gazes met, and the two of them quickly averted their gazes.

“This isn’t right.” Qin Yu frowned tightly.

How could there be so many top powerhouses in such a small banquet?

With more than twenty Martial Marquises, such strength was simply astonishing!

“It seems that someone has been eyeing that ten-thousand-year-old herbs for a long time,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Not far away, a young man was coldly looking at Qin Yu.

“Who is that person?” The young man looked at the person beside him and asked.

Another young man lowered his head and said, “Young Master Tang, that person is Qin Yu.”

“Qin Yu?” The person called Young Master Tang raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Is it that Qin Yu, who caused havoc in Jingdu?”

“Yes, Young Master.” The young man beside him bowed and said.

Young Master Tang shook the wine cup in his hand and sneered. “Interesting. Go and ask him to come over. Tell him that I will treat him to a drink.”

“Yes, Young Master.”

Young Master Tang’s attendant hurriedly walked towards Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, my Young Master invites you over,” the attendant said rather politely.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Who’s your Young Master?”

The attendant couldn’t help but say with some pride, “My Young Master is the son of the Master of Tang City, Tang Mo.”

“Tang Mo?” Qin Yu frowned.

He had never heard of this name before.

Qin Yu glanced at the attendant in front of him and was surprised to find that this attendant was also a Martial Marquis.

As for that Young Master Tang, he had stepped into the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis Realm!

“I didn’t expect that there would be such a powerhouse hidden in this small Tang City,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

After much consideration, Qin Yu agreed.

After all, ten-thousand-year-old herbs were going to be born here. It wasn’t a bad thing to befriend Tang Mo.

Qin Yu brought Xiao Yu and walked towards Tang Mo.

“Young Master Tang, Mr. Qin is here,” the attendant said.

Tang Mo waved his hand, indicating for the attendant to leave.

Then, Tang Mo looked at Qin Yu, raised his eyebrows and said, “You are Qin Yu?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded his head in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

Tang Mo handed a bottle of beer to Qin Yu, and then said indifferently, “I heard that you are quite impressive in Jingdu. You don’t even take the various aristocratic families seriously?”

Qin Yu said courteously, “That’s just a rumor. Even a rabbit will bite when it’s anxious.”

Tang Mo snorted lightly and said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu, I don’t care how powerful you are in Jingdu, but in Tang City, I have the final say. Do you understand?”

After saying this, Tang Mo pointed to the surroundings and said indifferently, “See? This banquet was organized by me! All the martial artists around are also my people!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.

Those twenty-some Martial Marquises were all members of the Tang family?

“Last year, a rich second generation son of Jingdu tried to show off to me, but I broke his legs and threw him into the sea,” Tang Mo said indifferently.

“Later, his father came to apologize with a generous gift, so I reluctantly spared him.”

Looking at Tang Mo’s condescending expression, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

Tang Mo seemed to like to show off.

However... Tang family was able to create so many Martial Marquises, so they must have some ability! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Could it be that Tang City has some secret?” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he decided to get some information from Tang Mo.

After all, Tang Mo didn’t seem to be very smart.
