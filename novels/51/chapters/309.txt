Commander Long said with a smile, “As a coach, of course you have to participate with me.”

These words made Qin Yu a little nervous, but he was more excited.

Qin Yu longed for Jingdu, but he was also a little afraid.

He had always wanted to go there, but he lacked an opportunity.

This time might be the best opportunity to go to Jingdu.

“What’s wrong?” Commander Long asked.

Before Qin Yu could speak, Mr. Wu smiled and said, “You want to take the opportunity to visit Miss Yan, right?”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said shyly, “More or less.”

“Hahaha! I’ve heard that the eldest daughter of the Yan family likes you. So it’s not a rumor.” Commander Long couldn’t help but laugh.

Qin Yu blushed.

He hurriedly got up and said, “I’ll go back first. It’s getting late. I have to get some rest.”

“Okay. Tomorrow morning, at eight o’clock, remember to come to the training ground on time,” Commander Long reminded.

Then, Qin Yu and Mr. Wu left the place together.

After returning, Qin Yu tossed and turned on the bed, but was unable to fall asleep.

As soon as he closed his eyes, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but appear in his mind.

When they met, what would the scene be like?

Would he go to the Yan family’s home openly? Or would they meet secretly?

Countless thoughts flashed through Qin Yu’s mind. With this complicated feeling, he fell into a deep sleep.

The next morning, Qin Yu got up early and prepared to head to the Chuzhou region’s training ground.

Mr. Wu had already returned from his morning jog. When he saw Qin Yu, he smiled and said, “You’re awake? Eat something first, and then let’s go.”

What surprised Qin Yu was that the breakfast was made by Xiao Yu.

She cooked four bowls of noodles, which tasted pretty good.

On the way to the training ground of Chuzhou, Mr. Wu asked, “Qin Yu, have you prepared the training plan?”

Qin Yu flipped his palm and said, “I’ve prepared it long ago. This training plan is extremely perfect and easy to understand.”

Mr. Wu nodded and said, “That’s good.”

Soon, the two of them arrived at the training ground.

The members of the Longhu team had already gathered at the training ground, and Commander Long had also waited here in advance.

After seeing Qin Yu, Commander Long walked forward and shook hands with Qin Yu.

“Since you’re already here, let’s begin,” Commander Long said with a wave of his hand.

Qin Yu nodded and walked to the front of the group. Just as he was about to speak, all the team members shouted in unison, “Hello, Officer Qin!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable with this form of address. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He coughed and waved his hand while saying, “Hello, everyone. From today onwards, I will teach everyone a new training method.”

Then, Qin Yu swept his gaze over everyone and said slowly, “This training method is extremely hard and demanding. I hope that everyone can maintain their motivation.”

“We guarantee that we will complete the mission!” Many of the team members shouted.

Qin Yu did not waste any more time. He personally demonstrated this training method for the team members.

This training method was different from ordinary body refining techniques. If one wanted to improve their physical body in a short period of time, they would have to train from the inside out.

Therefore, the postures that Qin Yu made were all extremely strange. Moreover, each of the postures had to be maintained for more than an hour.

There were a total of twelve postures. In other words, it would take at least twelve hours to complete the entire set!

In addition, while making the postures, one also had to maintain a regular breathing pattern.

Qin Yu demonstrated the twelve postures to everyone. Then, he said, “Everyone, let’s train according to this plan. The interval between each posture is ten minutes.”

“Whoever can’t do it should take the initiative to quit the Longhu team,” Qin Yu said somewhat domineeringly.

Looking at Qin Yu’s movements, everyone couldn’t help but frown.

“Officer Qin, is your plan really effective?”

“Your movements were too fast. We didn’t see them clearly at all.”

“Officer Qin, tell us the truth. Can you maintain these movements for more than an hour?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I can’t do it.”

This immediately made them speech;ess.

“If you can’t do it yourself, why are you asking us to do it?” Someone couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “I don’t need to use this plan at all.”

Everyone looked at Commander Long in unison, as if waiting for his order.

Commander Long shouted, “Qin Yu’s orders represent my orders! If anyone can’t do it, withdraw now!”

With Commander Long’s words, they could only obey the order.

“Commander Long, please make eighteen copies of this plan and give them to them,” said Qin Yu.

Commander Long nodded and said, “No problem.”

The documents were quickly copied. After receiving the plan, everyone began to train according to the movements on the plan.

Qin Yu sat there and looked at everyone quietly while correcting their movements from time to time.

After a day, almost everyone had suffered varying degrees of injuries.

Some of them couldn’t even lift their arms due to the pain.

“Qin Yu, your plan is the same as Xue Hu’s?” Commander Long frowned and asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes.”

Commander Long’s expression suddenly changed, and he hurriedly said, “Qin Yu, this is not a joke! We don’t have much time left, so we can’t be careless!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll prepare a pill for them to use as support. I won’t let them get hurt.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at the crowd and shouted, “Alright, today’s training ends here. Tomorrow morning, at five o’clock, everyone will gather at the training ground!”

“Five o’clock? Isn’t that too early?” The crowd immediately wailed.

It was already twelve o’clock in the morning. This way, they could sleep for five hours at most!

“Carry out the order.” Qin Yu waved his hand and said domineeringly.

After dispersing the crowd, Qin Yu looked at Commander Long and said, “Commander Long, their training movements are almost done. There’s no need for me to come tomorrow.”

Commander Long frowned and said, “If you don’t come, who will watch them?”

“Let Officer Xue lead the team. His experience in leading the team is better than mine,” said Qin Yu.

Since he was going to Jingdu, Qin Yu naturally had to be fully prepared.

Therefore, he couldn’t waste all his time on training.

Commander Long rolled his eyes and said, “You’re really comfortable with being a hands-off manager. It’s not fair to Xue Hu.”

“Commander Long, if there’s any honor award, I’ll give it to Xue Hu. Is that okay?” Qin Yu said helplessly.

“Okay.” Since he said that, Commander Long couldn’t say anything more. He could only nod and agree.

Qin Yu turned his head and was about to leave the military zone. At this time, he suddenly thought of something and turned around again while saying, “Oh right, Commander Long, don’t forget to send someone to get the medicine once a day.”

“Got it, got it,” Commander Long said with a wave of his hand.

...

In the Han family’s home, Han Wei still hadn’t fallen asleep late at night.

He sat cross-legged on the ground while absorbing the purest spiritual energy from his surroundings.

After more than ten minutes, Han Wei finally stood up.

“Young Master.” The butler walked forward and bowed to Han Wei.

Han Wei glanced at him and said, “What is it? Tell me.”

The butler said, “I just received news that Gu Taichu seemed to have been defeated by Qin Yu.”

“Oh really?” Han Wei raised his eyebrows.

“Isn’t Gu Taichu a fifth level Inner Strength Grandmaster? How did he lose to Qin Yu?”

The butler shook his head and said, “We’re not sure either.”

Han Wei didn’t pay much attention to it. He snickered and said, “He’s just a mere fifth-level Inner Strength Grandmaster. I can crush him to death with a raise of my hand.”

In Jiang Bei, being a fifth-level Inner Strength Grandmaster was impressive.

However, in Jingdu, a fifth-level Inner Strength Grandmaster wasn’t worth mentioning.

The butler frowned and said, “Defeating a fifth level Inner Strength Grandmaster is indeed nothing. However, what worries me is that Qin Yu has only just entered the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm, but he has already beaten people above his realm.”

“Even Ye Qing couldn’t achieve such a feat back then...”
