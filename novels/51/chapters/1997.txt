1998 Jue Wu’s Decision

The elderly man’s attack displayed his powerful strength in an instant. It instantly made Elder Si, who was originally unrestrained, quieten down.

Obviously, the elderly man was warning everyone.

Although the royal family had declined, it did not mean they could be simply bullied by others.

“I wonder what kind of explanation you elders want,” the prince said.

Elder Yao, by the side, smiled and said, “Actually, we don’t have any ill intentions toward Your Highness. It’s just that it’s the Golden Age now. Definitely, there will be endless disputes in the future. If everyone runs to Sky City to take refuge, doesn’t Sky City explode? ”

Everyone in the Great Hall laughed.

The prince had already guessed their intentions, so he said in a deep voice, “Elder Yao, say what you want to say.”

Elder Yao cleared his throat and said, “The nine great aristocratic families have always been particular about being democratic. Why don’t we do it this way? Let everyone vote to decide if we should revoke the rule of not fighting in Sky City. ”

“Is there a need to vote?” the prince laughed and said, hearing what he said.

“What does Your Highness mean? Do you think we’ve discussed this beforehand?” Elder Yao pretended to be surprised and said.

The prince didn’t reply. Instead, he asked, “If we revoke this rule, is this matter settled?”

“Of course not.” At this moment, the elder from the Yun family stood up.

He looked at the prince and said indifferently, “It’s the Golden Age now, and we must share Your Highness’s burdens. If I remember correctly, Your Highness is almost 200 years old now, right?”

The prince nodded slightly, indicating for him to continue.

“For the sake of the continuation of the royal family, I think it’s time Your Highness should consider getting married,” Elder Yun continued.

The prince’s expression instantly changed, and his eyebrows furrowed.

“After our discussion, we’ve already chosen a few suitable women for Your Highness. They are all heirs from our great aristocratic families. If the prince is willing, you can choose any of them,” Elder Yun said.

“Your Highness is the only descendant of Great Xia. We can’t let it end here,” the others echoed.

The prince slowly stood up.

“I disagree,” he said coldly, putting his hands behind his back.

“You disagree? Why?” Elder Si said with a vague smile.

“You don’t have to worry about my marriage,” the prince said coldly.

“Your Highness, we are doing this for your own good.” The atmosphere in the Great Hall turned strange again.

“I definitely disagree with this,” The prince’s attitude was tremendously firm.

He knew very well that once he gave birth to a descendant, he would probably lose his value in the future. The nine great aristocratic families would definitely kill him.

The Great Hall fell into silence. It was terrifyingly quiet.

Elder Si glanced at the two elderly men beside the prince and said, “Since Your Highness disagrees, we can’t force you. However, we have a small request.”

The prince looked at Elder Si and gestured for him to continue.

“Once the special status of Sky City is removed, there will be many disputes in the future,” Elder Si said indifferently. “To ensure Your Highness’s safety, you must come with us. The nine great aristocratic families will send people to protect you.”

Before the prince could speak, Elder Si said coldly, “This is the will of the nine family heads. There is no room for the slightest oversight.”

Seeing Elder Si’s unyielding attitude, the prince understood this matter had no room for negotiation.

He had to agree no matter what.

After a long silence, the prince finally nodded and said, “Thank you for everyone’s kind intentions. I agree.”

The people in the Great Hall heaved a sigh of relief, but the hearts of the people watching from the outside sank.

“These b*stards are probably trying to keep the spirit coins in their own hands.”

“That’s right. In this way, the position of the nine great aristocratic families will be even more unshakable.”

“How despicable! Despicable and shameless!”

Qin Yu’s brows also furrowed. No one had expected the nine great aristocratic families’ unyielding attitude.

“Alright, since this matter has been settled, let’s start voting on the rule of the Sky City,” Elder Yao stood up and said.

The result of the vote was without a doubt. Everyone voted to revoke the special status of Sky City.

“It’s unanimous. From today onward, the rule of not fighting in Sky City no longer exists,” Elder Si said indifferently.

Before he finished speaking, he turned his head to look at Qin Yu in the crowd.

Qin Yu’s heart sank, and he immediately planned to leave.

“Jue Wu, quickly run!” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

But right at this moment, Jue Wu suddenly attacked.

Like a purple meteor, she instantly appeared in front of the third princess!

Before everyone could react, Jue Wu had already grabbed the third princess by the neck and brought her out!

The sudden turn of events instantly caused the scene to become chaotic. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“How dare you! What are you trying to do?” Elder Si was the most nervous. After all, the Yan family and the Si family had a special relationship. If something happened to the third princess, he would be in hot soup!

The third princess struggled desperately in Jue Wu’s hands, but Jue Wu’s hands were tightly gripping the third princess. His slender fingers were like sharp blades, scratching the third princess’s fair neck and causing blood to flow out.

“Are you courting death? Quickly let go of me, or I’ll kill your entire family and skin you alive!” The third princess roared crazily.

Jue Wu looked at her coldly and then slapped her face.

“If you dare to talk any more nonsense, I’ll kill you now!” Jue Wu said fiercely.

After being slapped, the third princess was stunned.

...

She seemed to have realized that woman in front of her would never let her indulge in her bad habits, nor would she care about her identity as the third princess.

“What do you want? Let go of her!” Elder Si stepped forward, and the internal qi on his body exploded. His white hair fluttered in the wind, and he looked very intimidating.

However, Jue Wu was not afraid of anything. Not to mention a small elder, even if the head of the Si family came, Jue Wu would not be scared.

“Let us leave Sky City. When we reach a safe place, I will naturally let the third princess go,” Jue Wu said coldly.

Elder Si frowned and snorted, “No, I won’t be at ease with the third princess in your hands.”

Elder Yao also stood up and said, “If you release the third princess now, we can let you leave Sky City.”

“F*ck you! What’s the difference between your mouth and your anus? I don’t believe your nonsense!” Jue Wu cursed.

Elder Yao’s face darkened. He said coldly, “Then what do you want? If you hurt the third princess, even Dean Lei can’t save you!”

“Is that so? Then let’s give it a try!” Jue Wu sneered. She immediately applied more strength to her fingers, and her nails instantly pierced into the third princess’s neck.

The third princess was so frightened that her face turned ashen. She shouted crazily,” F*ck you! The one with the surname Si! If anything happens to me, my dad will definitely tear you into shreds! “
