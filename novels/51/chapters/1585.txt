Chapter 1586: Chapter 1586, Huangji Liuli 1

Not far away, the two godly monarchs narrowed their eyes and looked coldly at Qin Yu.

They were waiting, waiting for a Crazy Qin Yu, waiting for a crazy and Brainless Qin Yu.

But what surprised them was that Qin Yu stood there and did not move for a long time.

A pair of scarlet eyes were emitting an ice-cold look.

“Oh? What’s going on?”One of the godly monarchs was somewhat puzzled.

“Why is he standing there not moving? Shouldn’t the eight demon transformations be in a frenzy?”The other godly monarch was also somewhat puzzled.

At this moment, Qin Yu spoke.

He said with a nearly hoarse voice, “From today onwards... I, Qin Yu, will fight you to the death... Today... I will issue a challenge to you...”

As soon as these words were said, the two of them were immediately shocked!

It was not because of Qin Yu’s words, but because of Qin Yu’s reaction!

He had clearly used the eight demon transformations, how could he still speak? How could he still have reason?

“This... what exactly is going on!”The two godly monarchs were horrified!

Before they could react, Qin Yu had already used the power of the eight demon transformations to turn around and flee!

Under the augmentation of the eight demon transformations, Qin Yu’s speed was extremely fast. The red radiance and golden radiance interweaved like a bolt of lightning!

The two godly monarchs did not have time to think and immediately chased after him!

“This child actually wants to flee! How is this possible! Under the augmentation of the eight demon transformations, how did he manage to maintain his consciousness!”

“Is this child’s divine sense so powerful that even the eight demon transformations are unable to corrode it?”

The two of them chased while feeling shocked!

They did not dare to imagine what kind of existence a person who could still maintain his rationality under the eight demon transformations was!

Qin Yu’s speed was extremely fast, and the two godly monarchs also increased their speed to the extreme.

They chased each other along the way, but the two of them could not catch up to him no matter what.

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded in their minds.

“The master has summoned us. We must return to the northern lands immediately.”

This voice caused the two godly monarchs who were chasing to stop in their tracks.

They looked at each other and immediately frowned.

“The master actually summoned us at this moment...”their faces revealed unwillingness. Their eyes could not help but look in the direction where Qin Yu had fled.

“I really can’t accept letting him escape just like that...”

After this battle, both of them clearly knew that Qin Yu’s threat to the northern lands was much greater than they had imagined.

However, no one dared to disobey the orders of the master of the northern lands.

No matter how much unwillingness they had in their hearts, they could only temporarily return to the northern lands.

“Let him live for a few more days,”the two godly monarchs said coldly.

Following that, their bodies entered the darkness and left the South Province.

...

When Qin Yu woke up again, he had already arrived at an unfamiliar place.

In a daze, he crawled up from the ground. He only felt a pain in his head, as if he had been struck by lightning.

“This eight demon transformation really lives up to its reputation...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He shook his head vigorously and then released his divine sense, covering his surroundings.

He could not see any human figures or even any lives in the surroundings.

“Fortunately, those two people did not catch up,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He stood there with a solemn expression.

The strength of these two godly monarchs was stronger than he had imagined. No wonder they dared to run to the Cultivation Mountain to provoke the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“However, it’s also good. At least I gained some insights from them,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

This battle was extremely meaningful to Qin Yu. His understanding of the DAO technique had also made a qualitative leap.

“I’m afraid it won’t be long before I can step into the middle stage of the mighty figure realm,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Following that, Qin Yu summoned the Divine Hawk. He stood on the back of the figure and sped off in the direction of the Zhuo clan.

What he needed to do next was to gather all the materials needed for Xiao Hai’s array formation.

However, Qin Yu was not familiar with the southern region, so he could only rely on Zhuo Jing.

In the next few days, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the back of the Godly Eagle.

It had to be said that this battle had caused Qin Yu’s internal Qi to be almost exhausted. If he wanted to recover to his peak, it would probably take some time.

On the way, Qin Yu slowly absorbed his internal Qi and slowly recovered his body.

After an unknown number of days, Qin Yu finally arrived at the Zhuo family.

The Zhuo family was still the same as before. They were singing and dancing as if the war in the outside world had nothing to do with them.

Qin Yu jumped down from the back of the godly eagle and found Zhuo Jing.

At this moment, Zhuo Jing was in the medicine storehouse.

When Qin Yu found him, he was sitting cross-legged with many kinds of herbs in front of him.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu didn’t have the heart to disturb him. He turned around and planned to leave.

“Brother Qin.”

But at this moment, Zhuo Jing opened his eyes and called out to Qin Yu.

He stood up from the ground and said with a smile, “Brother Qin, aren’t you in the northern lands? Why did you suddenly come to my Zhuo Family?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said straightforwardly, “I’m here to ask for your help.”

With that, Qin Yu took out a piece of paper and handed it to Zhuo Jing.

“These materials are what senior Xiao Hai needs. With my connections and ability, I don’t know how long it will take to gather them,”said Qin Yu.

Zhuo Jing took the piece of paper and glanced at it. Then, he frowned slightly and said, “These materials... are not common.”

“HMM? Is it difficult to gather them?”Asked Qin Yu.

Zhuo jing nodded and said, “The others are fine, but this Huangji Shenli came from the Huangji Mountain...”

“Huangji Mountain?”Qin Yu was stunned.

Was it the place where the tribulation transcending stage fell?

Rumor has it that many great cultivators who had transcended the tribulation had died in the Huangji Mountain. Moreover, no one knew the specific reason.

“In places like Zhejiang, a random stone that falls is probably a supreme treasure, not to mention this Huangji Shenli,”Zhuo Jing explained.

“As far as I know, Huangji Shenli is a divine rock from the Huangji Mountain. It has been refined by many years of divine fire. Not to mention the small southern region, even in the central region, it is a treasure that is enough to make the various aristocratic families take action... “Why would Xiao Hai need this? “As the peak of the southern region, how could he not know how difficult this item is?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu frowned.

Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be. Xiao Hai shouldn’t have asked him to look for such a treasure. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Brother Zhuo, is it difficult to go to the Huangji Mountain from here?”Qin Yu asked.

Hearing this, Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but laugh.

“Brother Qin, you’re not planning to go to the Huangji Mountain, are you?”Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but laugh.

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said, “Otherwise, what else can I Do?”

Zhuo Jing silently shook his head and said, “I think Xiao Hai is trying to lure you away on purpose.”

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment before he shook his head and said, “Impossible. What he did is completely unreasonable.”

“Maybe.”Zhuo Jing did not argue with Qin Yu.

“How about this, Brother Zhuo, you gather the other materials first. As for this Huang Ji Liuli, I will think of a way,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.
