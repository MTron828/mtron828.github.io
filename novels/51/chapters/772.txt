Chapter 773: The Method to Obtain the Power of a Martial Saint Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Looking at the Pavilion Master and Jiang He’s smiles, Qin Yu suddenly guessed something.

Could it be that they called him here for this matter?

“Senior Jiang He, do you have a way?” Qin Yu instantly became anxious.

“This matter is very important to me. You know that everything I do is to save Yan Ruoxue!”

“As long as I win against Blackie, I can enter the Mystic Realm! At that time, I can see Yan Ruoxue!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jiang He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Have you ever thought that if you really enter the Mystic Realm, you might never be able to come out again?”

“What if they work together to besiege you in the Mystic Realm? What will you do then?”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “I have my own ways! As long as I can find the Mystic Realm, I will definitely have a way!”

Seeing this, Jiang He could only nod and say, “It seems that you have made up your mind. I can’t say anything more.”

After saying that, Jiang He stood up.

He put his hands behind his back and said, “You should know about the heavenly secrets, right?”

“I know.” Qin Yu nodded.

“I tried to catch the heavenly secrets once and succeeded.”

This surprised Jiang He a little.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Capturing the heavenly secrets is a very difficult thing. You... . .”

“I did manage to capture it.” Qin Yu said seriously.

Jiang He couldn’t help but smile bitterly as a trace of admiration appeared on his face.

“Recently, the heavenly secrets had predicted that a Martial Saint would appear in Pyro at the beginning of next year.” Jiang He said.

“Martial Saint?” Qin Yu appeared to be somewhat puzzled.

Jiang He hummed and continued to say, “It’s almost the new year. In other words, it’s not far from the time that a Martial Saint will appear.”

“So?” Qin Yu was even more confused.

Jiang He stared at Qin Yu and said, “Have you ever thought that the Martial Saint that the heaven’s secret has predicted is you?”

“Me?” Qin Yu pointed at his nose.

However, the current Qin Yu was still far away from becoming a Martial Saint.

“There are so many Martial Marquises at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm in the world, so how could it be me...” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“They will definitely be the first to step into the Martial Saint Realm.”

“No.” Jiang He shook his head.

“Martial Saints can no longer appear in this era. The first person to step into the Martial Saint realm will break this deadlock.”

“Therefore, many people are stuck at the Consummate stage of the Martial Marquis realm and are unable to take another step forward, regardless of their talent.”

“This is the suppression of the Heavenly Dao! It has nothing to do with talent!”

When Qin Yu heard this, his eyes immediately widened.

No wonder there were so many geniuses in this era, but none of them had stepped into the Martial Saint Realm!

It had been many years since a new Martial Saint had appeared!

“Senior Jiang He, why do you think it’s me?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

Jiang He said indifferently, “I feel it.”

“I feel the same way too,” the Pavilion Master said as well.

“Qin Yu, why don’t you focus on increasing your strength for the time being? As long as you step into the Martial Saint realm, even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will have to negotiate with you peacefully!”

“When that time comes, you can ask for her and even fight head-on with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Qin Yu frowned deeply.

If that Martial Saint was really him, then it would indeed be something to look forward to.

But... would Granny Qin give him time?

After they recovered from their injuries, they would definitely use the power of a Martial Saint to get rid of him!

“I don’t have that much time.” Qin Yu shook his head.

When Jiang He saw this, he looked at the Pavilion Master.

The Pavilion Master said in a deep voice, “If he can obtain the power of a Martial Saint, you can also obtain it, Qin Yu.”

“I can also obtain it?” Qin Yu hurriedly looked at the Pavilion Master.

The Pavilion Master nodded and said, “That’s right. As long as you can find the power left behind by a Martial Saint, you can borrow the power of a Martial Saint.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile bitterly and said, “It’s not that easy to find the power left behind by the Martial Saint...”

“Of course it’s not that easy.” The Pavilion Master smiled and said.

The Pavilion Master continued, “But it’s not that difficult.”

Qin Yu looked at the Pavilion Master eagerly and waited for her to continue.

The Pavilion Master continued, “Many of the aristocratic families will have the power left behind by a Martial Saint. Moreover, there are quite a number of such aristocratic families.”

Qin Yu quickly looked at the Pavilion Master and said, “Pavilion Master, don’t keep me in suspense. You must know where they are left behind, right?”

The Pavilion Master smiled lightly and said, “That’s right.”

After she finished speaking, the Pavilion Master took out a business card and placed it on the table.

On the business card, a name was written: Xue Yuzhi.

This name was rather unfamiliar. Qin Yu had never heard of it before.

He took the business card and frowned. “Pavilion Master, how come I’ve never heard of the Xue family?”

“Because the Xue family has long moved abroad,” said the Pavilion Master.

She pointed at the business card and said, “Xue Yuzhi is my good friend. Her father needs a kind of pill called the concentric pill.”

“This kind of pill is a genuine Divine Rank pill. Xue Yuzhi has begged me many times, but I never agreed to it because I don’t have the formula for the concentric pill at all.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu quickly understood.

“You want me to help you refine the concentric pill, right?” Qin Yu grabbed the business card and said.

The Pavilion Master nodded and said, “That’s right. If you can refine the concentric pill for the Xue family, I think they will give you the power of a Martial Saint.”

Qin Yu took the business card and stood up immediately.

Then, he said with some excitement, “Pavilion Master, thank you!”

The Pavilion Master continued, “Don’t be happy too early. The power of a Martial Saint is of great significance. They might not be willing to give it to you. Therefore, you still need to do it yourself.”

“Pavilion Master, the possibility of obtaining the power of a Martial Saint is already worth my hard work.” Qin Yu was extremely determined.

“Alright.” The Pavilion Master nodded.

“You will leave on time in three days. I will inform the Xue family to pick you up.”

Qin Yu nodded vigorously and said, “Pavilion Master, I, Qin Yu, will never forget your great kindness. I...”

“That’s enough.” The Pavilion Master did not seem to like hearing these things.

She waved her hand and said, “You can go down now.”

Qin Yu coughed dryly and then said with an embarrassed smile, “Then, Pavilion Master, please rest.”

After he had finished speaking, Qin Yu greeted Jiang He and jumped down from the Pavilion Master’s building.

After Qin Yu had left, Jiang He poured a cup of tea and said with a smile, “Do you really think Xue Yuzhi will give the power of the Martial Saint to Qin Yu?”

“I don’t know,” The Pavilion Master shook her head and said.

“Even if Xue Yuzhi really refused, it would be good for him to go out and hide.”

Jiang He couldn’t help but stroke his beard and said with a smile, “You really put in a lot of effort.”

The Pavilion Master smiled and said, “I believe in Qin Yu. He will definitely be able to obtain the power of the Martial Saint.”

“I don’t think it’s possible.” Jiang He shook his head and said.

“You should know what the power of the Martial Saint means. Not all clans can be compared to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

The Pavilion Master smiled and said, “Why don’t we make a bet?”

“What bet?” Jiang He asked.

The Pavilion Master said, “If I win, you will teach the nine secrets of Taoism to Qin Yu. How about that?”
