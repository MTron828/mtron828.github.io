1950 The Weird Third Princess

Following that, Qin Yu covered his face again and rushed to the Yan family.

Through the teleportation formation, Qin Yu arrived at the Yan family in no time.

Many people were still near the Yan family, climbing the stone stairways.

With the Yan family’s token in his hand, Qin Yu did not need to enter the Yan family through the formation.

The restriction on him wasn’t too severe under the token’s effect.

With a stomp of his feet, his body floated up. After that Qin Yu jumped up with all his might and landed at the gate of the Yan family in a while.

Although he had arrived at the Yan family, Qin Yu did not know how to enter.

It was because Qin Yu’s face had changed. It was no longer that previous ugly face.

In other words, he could no longer use the name Qin Yan.

“Don’t tell me I have to re-enter the Yan family!” Qin Yu rubbed his forehead, feeling a terrible headache.

He looked around and entered the Yan family with the token.

After passing through the gate, a massive house was in front of them. It seemed like the new members of the Yan family had to go through this place and then be distributed.

Qin Yu took out Qin Yan’s token and walked in.

“I hope they don’t discover me,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just as Qin Yu was about to enter the room, a big hand patted his shoulder. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He turned around and saw Uncle Yan standing behind him.

“Yan … Uncle Yan, what are you doing here?” Qin Yu said subconsciously.

However, he regretted it as soon as he said that because he should not know Uncle Yan with his current identity.

Just as Qin Yu regretted his action, Uncle Yan sneered and said, “Put away your little tricks. Your secret technique is useless in front of me.”

Qin Yu was instantly shocked and embarrassed.

Uncle Yan looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You’re quite bold. You actually dare to propose to Miss Yan openly. Are you crazy?”

“I had no choice. If I didn’t do this, the Si family wouldn’t let me off…” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

Uncle Yan snorted. “Luckily the Yan family did not express their stance on this. If you cause trouble for Miss Yan, I will not let you off easily.”

Qin Yu said with a smile, “I’ve thought through this. This matter might bring Ruoxue trouble, but it’s definitely not a big trouble. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have done this.”

“Is that so?” Uncle Yan snorted coldly. “You’re quite good at scheming.”

Qin Yu scratched his head, not knowing what to say.

“Why did you come to the Yan family again? What do you want this time?” Uncle Yan said unhappily.

Qin Yu sighed and immediately stated his purpose for coming.

After listening to Qin Yu’s intention, Uncle Yan frowned.

“You said you want to go to Xihuang Island?” Uncle Yan’s eyes were full of surprise and puzzle.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “It doesn’t have to be long. I only need half a month.

Uncle Yan quickly guessed Qin Yu’s intention. He squinted his eyes and said, “You want to use this opportunity to cultivate and devour the dark energy?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu knew he could not hide it from Uncle Yan, so he straightaway answered.

“Uncle Yan, can you send me to Xihuang Island?” Qin Yu said with a pleading tone.

After a moment of silence, Uncle Yan said, “No one wants to go to Xihunag Island, so it’s not difficult to send you there.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He cupped his hands and said, “Thank you very much, Uncle Yan!”

“But don’t forget Xihuang Island is the third princess’s territory,” Uncle Yan said. “Even if you go there, you may not be able to cultivate peacefully.”

“Sigh! I don’t have any other choice. I can only take one step at a time,” Qin Yu laughed bitterly.

Seeing this, Uncle Yan didn’t say anything else.

“Come with me,” he said, waving his hand.

“Thank you very much, Uncle Yan!” Qin Yu was overjoyed. He quickly followed behind Uncle Yan and rushed to Xihuang Island.

Xihuang Island was in the westernmost. Even with Uncle Yan leading the way, it still took them two whole days to reach the vicinity of the island.

“I’m sending you till here,” Uncle Yan said.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. He took off the mask on his face and said in a low voice, “I hope Third Princess can calm down a little…”

Uncle Yan looked at Qin Yu’s face in surprise.

Looking at this extremely handsome face, Uncle Yan opened his mouth and laughed, “With your current look, you might have less trouble.”

“Eh? Why?” Qin Yu was puzzled and asked.

“You’ll understand when you go to Xihuang Island,” Uncle Yan said, waving his hand.

Although Qin Yu was full of doubts, he didn’t think much about it.

“Thank you very much, Uncle Yan.” After thanking Uncle Yan again, Qin Yu rushed to Xihuang Island.

When Qin Yu arrived at Xihuang Island, he found the third princess happened to be there. In front of her, a row of people was kneeling and crawling on the ground like animals.

The third princess was holding a black divine whip in her hand, whipping from time to time.

This whip contained divine power and could even directly attack the divine sense. The people kneeling on the ground would show painful expressions each time she whipped.

The third princess seemed to be quite excited. She would whip her whip from time to time and then laugh madly.

...

“This pervert!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Just then, the third princess noticed Qin Yu, who was not far away.

She immediately stomped her feet and arrived in front of Qin Yu in an instant.

Looking at the third princess, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“You… Are you new here?” However, the third princess’s reaction was different from what Qin Yu had imagined.

Looking at Qin Yu in front of her, not only did she not make any fierce moves, but a trace of shyness even appeared on her face.

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment, then he nodded and said, “Yes, Third Princess.”

The shyness on the third princess’s face grew. She stood beside Qin Yu and said carefully, “Brother, do you want to come to my palace to have fun? I have a lot of fun things there!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly widened.

Was this the third princess who had a fiendish expression? It was as if he had changed into a different person!

“Don’t tell me… this third princess is a lovestruck fool?” Qin Yu suddenly remembered what Uncle Yan said.

...

In that case, he would have less trouble.

“No, Third Princess. I still have things to do,” Qin Yu said.

The third princess said, “Okay. Brother, if you need anything, just call out to me!”

After saying this, the third princess looked at the group of people kneeling on the ground and scolded, “You guys have to serve Brother well in the future, understand?”

“Yes, Third Princess…” the cultivators kneeling on the ground quickly said.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh in her heart. This third princess was really a weirdo. She was the princess of the Yan family, but she was actually obsessed with looks!

Although they were both from the Yan family, the third princess was not comparable to Yan Ruoxue at all!
