2492 The Temple of the Demon Race

The breathing of some demon race during their cultivation was like thunder.

Suddenly, the speed of the Heart of the Ocean was reduced to the extreme.

In front of them, a terrifying pressure permeated the air.

It was the divine beast, Azure Dragon. Its body was massive and robust. It usually took the form of a snake and was hundreds of feet long.

The body stretching out like a mountain range made people feel tremendously small.

Under the sunlight, the Azure Dragon’s scales flickered with a bright green light, emitting a mysterious and majestic internal qi.

A powerful dragon breath surrounded it as if it could destroy everything in the world.

The Heart of the Ocean passed by it, and Qin Yu felt a wave of fear.

However, under the breath control effect of this celestial artifact, it passed through smoothly in the end and did not attract the attention of the Azure Dragon.

“What a terrifying divine artifact! This Azure Dragon is the leader of the four great divine beasts, and its power of the soul is incomparably vigorous. It actually couldn’t detect our internal qi at such a close distance.”

Qin Yu was tremendously amazed.

“Only those who have reached the Tribulation Sixth Level and are in harmony with the elemental forces can sense the clues. It’s very difficult to see through the disguise of the Heart of the Ocean in the realm of the fifth level. No matter how you look at it, it’s still the power of the water element between heaven and earth.”

Gu Ning said softly.

Suddenly, Teng Zixu, who was outside Huaning Mountain, let out an angry roar.

His body paused, and he instantly turned into a stream of light and disappeared into the horizon.

“He was discovered so soon? With the power of the Heart of the Ocean, this shouldn’t be the case. If even Teng Zixu couldn’t hide, how could they hide from the demon race in the depths of the Azure Rock Forest?”

Looking in the direction Teng Zixu left, Lei Xin felt a little uneasy.

This time, the Gu family was ambushed, and all the members came to Human Race Watch.

In fact, it was a big matter in the Holy Region. Even the alliance had been discussing this matter in meetings for days.

Whereas the Gu family went all out instead, even the people in the alliance had all retreated.

Until now, after Gu Ning brought Qin Yu deep into the Azure Rock Forest, Lei Xin had always felt that Gu Ning had made some arrangements. However, he could not figure out the source.

“I hope it’s not as bad as I imagined.”

Flower Granny’s face was solemn. She added when she saw the puzzled expressions on Yan Ruoxue’s and Lei Xin’s faces.

“Gu Ning and Gu Baiyi are actually biological sisters. Gu Ning used to be someone with tremendously low talent, and the Gu family even threw her away to the tributary not long after she was born. Gu Baiyi had been protecting her for many years and even gave her an inheritance. That was how the Holy Lord of the Gu family was born. I hope Gu Baiyi’s death won’t make her go crazy.”

Even in the Holy Region, only a few people knew about this

Although cultivators would gradually weaken their feelings after a long journey of cultivation, Flower Granny could not help but worry at this moment.

“No! I have to go and take a look. If there’s any danger, I can help.”

Yan Ruoxue’s body moved, and she had already entered the depths of space.

“Hey hey hey, even if you know these secrets, don’t tell Ruoxue!”

Lei Xin held his head. Ruoxue had already opened a passage and could absorb the power of origin under the throne.

In addition, the Way of Space itself was unpredictable. Even the two of them could not stop her in time.

At this moment, they had already arrived where the demon race’s crown was being refined.

Unlike other places, this place emitted a holy aura instead.

It was a temple of the demon race, and numerous statues of their ancestors were around it.

The air in the temple was full of holy internal qi, and the statues’ gazes seemed to be able to see through people’s hearts.

Even in the Heart of the Ocean, Qin Yu seemed to feel that gaze penetrating his body.

The ancient stone steps wound their way up and well-arranged ancient trees were on both sides.

In the center of the temple placed a crown that emitted an ancient internal qi.

Its overall shape was like a phoenix spreading its wings and about to fly. It emitted an overbearing aura and pressure.

As Qin Yu’s divine sense focused, he suddenly felt a wave of dizziness.

In that instant, his soul was almost severely injured.

If not for the fact that he had only used a wisp of the soul power to come into contact with it and that his body belonged to the chaotic body, he would have suffered severe injury.

The moment the Heart of the Ocean stepped into the temple, Qin Yu felt countless divine senses land on him.

A tremendously furious and fierce cry sounded in the entire world.

The surrounding demonic beasts seemed confused about why these humans could appear here.

“I’m sorry, Qin Yu.”

Saintess Gu’s face revealed a shade of sorrow. A vast power suddenly smashed down.

It was a nine-tailed demon fox, and each part of its tail was condensed with a type of power.

There were four types of the power of the Path of Heaven and nine types of transformations.

Nine types of power suddenly gathered before him, and a black energy ball slowly took shape.

With a sweep of its nine tails, the energy sphere that contained destructive power immediately blasted in front of Qin Yu and the others.

The Heart of the Ocean suddenly released its internal power, and a spherical water curtain appeared beside them.

When the terrifying energy ball landed on it, it could not penetrate this thin water curtain.

As his strength bounced, it bounced the energy ball away.

“Boom!”

Nearly a thousand meters of land turned into a sea of fire.

Saintess Gu closed her eyes and made a complicated hand seal.

A powerful water elemental energy began to gather around her body.

At this moment, there was no need to hide anymore.

The entire space suddenly trembled, and the entire ground suddenly began cracking.

The source of water deep underground was forcefully activated by Saintess Gu.

Countless enormous water pillars shot up into the sky, and in an instant, the entire space seemed to have turned into a watery expanse.

This terrifying power belonged to the power of heaven and earth.

Saintess Gu seemed to have borrowed the power of the Heart of the Ocean. Otherwise, she could not have used such a terrifying technique.

But even so, her body was still shaking, and it seemed to be especially strenuous.

Qin Yu placed a palm on her back and injected a vast amount of chaotic power into her body.

“Fury of Sea God!”

Saintess Gu’s face revealed a ferocious expression.

In an instant, tsunamis, storms, and massive waves appeared.

The terrifying power of water in the world smashed countless demon races into meat patties.

This power was comparable to Xiao Seng’s last punch in his fight with Baiyi. The power of the Fury of Sea God was immeasurable.

After this attack, even the terrain of the entire mountain range changed.

“Boom!”

“You’re courting death!”

The sky suddenly darkened, and an enormous dragon tail swept toward them like a landslide.

The massive force compressed the water curtain to the extreme and finally broke it.

Qin Yu’s body surged with the power of the six acupoints. He pushed out his palm and received the attack.
