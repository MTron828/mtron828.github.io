Chapter 1523: Chapter 1,523, Sima Bei! 1

This was only the second heavenly tribulation, yet it had almost destroyed Qin Yu’s physical body. Who knew how many more heavenly tribulation would follow, but one thing was for sure, each heavenly tribulation would be even more terrifying.

Qin Yu’s physical body had almost been destroyed, and he looked extremely miserable. But even so, he still slowly stood up from the ground.

Besides that, his body was also slowly recovering.

Qin Yu took out a pill from his pocket and stuffed it into his mouth. The speed of his body’s recovery immediately sped up.

“If this goes on, Qin Yu will definitely die!”Li Yingying’s tone was filled with unspeakable joy.

Zhuo Jing said unhappily, “Yingying, you sound like you really want Qin Yu to die here.”

Hearing this, Li Yingying realized that she had lost her composure, but she didn’t say anything.

The third heavenly tribulation was brewing in the sky.

The power of this heavenly tribulation was ten times that of the second heavenly tribulation!

Such a terrifying power was enough to destroy everything!

Qin Yu took a deep breath and immediately activated the fifth level of the fighting word formula to prepare for the heavenly tribulation.

Although Qin Yu still had other trump cards, he could not use them.

There must be at least nine heavenly tribulation of this level. If the third heavenly tribulation had to use all of his trump cards, then this tribulation would definitely fail!

......

Looking at the heavenly tribulation condensed in the dark clouds, Qin Yu felt a trace of unease in his heart.

A large area of the world was set off by a dark blue color, as if the end of the world was coming.

“This kid is dead for sure this time!”Li Yingying shouted crazily in her heart!

The Qi energy in Qin Yu’s body exploded to the extreme, and he was prepared to resist this heavenly tribulation with all his strength!

The heavenly tribulation was brewing in the dark clouds, and its speed was extremely slow.

The longer it took for the heavenly tribulation to descend, the more worried people would be.

At the same time, Sima Bei had already brought a black-robed man and descended here.

They hid in the dark and watched all of this coldly.

“I have to say, this is really a pretty good place to transcend the Heavenly Tribulation.”Sima bei sighed.

He raised his head and looked at the dense dark clouds in the sky as well as the heavenly tribulation that was gathering. Shock flashed across his face.

“Such a large scale heavenly tribulation is really shocking.”Sima bei said in a low voice.

The black-robed man beside him also nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. In all these years, I have never seen such a terrifying heavenly tribulation. I’m afraid that this brat will die in this heavenly tribulation.”

Sima bei said with a cold smile, “Then we will send him on his way.”

“Sir, Should We Act Now?”The black-robed man beside him asked.

“No.”Sima bei shook his head. He stared in the direction of Qin Yu and said indifferently, “I really want to see how this brat will pass this heavenly tribulation.”

The black-robed man at the side also nodded slightly.

They had never seen a heavenly tribulation of this scale before!

Hence, the two of them hid and waited to observe.

In the Falling Life Valley, Qin Yu was staring at this heavenly tribulation.

He knew that it was almost impossible to pass the heavenly tribulation unscathed. He only hoped that he could protect his body as much as possible.

The Heavenly Tribulation was still gathering, but Qin Yu’s internal Qi had already erupted to the limit.

“Yingying, follow me and retreat,”Zhuo Jing pulled Li Yingying and said.

The two of them retreated hundreds of meters before they stopped.

“Brother Zhuo, why is this?”Li Yingying asked in puzzlement.

Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice, “This scale of heavenly tribulation is absolutely not something that you and I can touch. Once we encounter it, we will either die or be crippled.”

Hearing this, Li Yingying couldn’t help but be greatly shocked.

This was only the third heavenly tribulation, yet it made Zhuo Jing so cautious. This was enough to show that Qin Yu’s talent was above theirs, and not just a little bit!

“Brother Zhuo, are you willing to let such a genius step into the mighty realm?”Li Yingying said, intentionally or unintentionally.

Zhuo Jing’s face turned black, and he said coldly, “Yingying, what do you mean by this?”

Li yingying smiled and said, “Nothing, I was just saying it casually.”

Just as the two of them were talking, the muffled thunder in the sky had already condensed.

That dragon-like light tore through the sky, and like a meteorite, it directly smashed down!

This time, the surrounding canyon directly collapsed, and everything turned into nothingness!

Everyone’s vision was covered by the dazzling light, and they were unable to see even a bit of it!

In the dark, Sima bei stared at this heavenly tribulation, his face filled with shock!

“This child’s talent is probably not inferior to the sons of the aristocratic families of the Central Plains!”Sima bei sighed.

“That’s right, if we allow him to grow up, he will definitely become a great enemy of the northern lands in the future.”The black-robed man at the side also said.

“It’s a pity that such a person can not be used by me.”Sima bei could not help but sigh.

As he spoke, that heavenly tribulation was already closing in on Qin Yu!

Qin Yu let out an explosive shout and used all his trump cards and spells, closing in on that Heavenly Tribulation!

“Boom!”

The Heavenly Tribulation arrived as scheduled and collided with Qin Yu.

In just an instant, Qin Yu felt as if his body was being torn apart, and all his defenses could not withstand a single blow!

His body was constantly being torn apart, and the pain caused him to almost faint.

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and let out an angry roar. His potential was stimulated at that moment, and his physical body actually began to remodel!

The third heavenly tribulation, which was even more powerful, allowed Qin Yu to withstand it with all his might!

He was slapped onto the ground, and his hands were raised. Golden light flickered, forming a sharp contrast with the heavenly tribulation!

The two sides seemed to have a confrontation at this moment!

Zhuo Jing, who was watching from the side, couldn’t help but be dumbstruck and full of shock!

“This... This is actually going to be withstood? ! This is too unbelievable!”Zhuo Jing said in a trembling voice.

Li Yingying, who was at the side, couldn’t help but clench her teeth!

If it was carried by Qin Yu, she would never have the chance to get rid of Qin Yu in the future! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Besides the two of them, Sima Bei, who was hiding in the dark, also widened his eyes.

“This child is really extraordinary,”Sima Bei said in a low voice.

The black-robed man beside him nodded and said, “This is too unbelievable. How can a nascent soul stage cultivator be able to resist a heavenly tribulation of this scale...”

Sima bei could not help but sigh. He placed his hands behind his back and slowly said, “If this child can be used by US, the future of the northern lands...”

Before he could continue speaking, Sima Bei shook his head once again and interrupted his own thoughts.

How could a person like Qin Yu serve the northern lands?

Which genius was not an unruly and unruly person?

Who knew how many geniuses had died because of their own arrogance!

And those who were able to survive were all figures who could shake the world!

“Sir, Should We Act Now?”The black-robed person at the side asked.

Sima bei shook his head and said, “This is only the third heavenly tribulation. There are nine heavenly tribulation for mighty figures. There’s no rush.”

“Mm, I also want to see how long this kid can last.”The black-robed man beside him also said.
