Chapter 974: Chapter 974, star plucking hand 

“As expected!”Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

It was just as he had guessed! Tian Xuehong still wanted to extract the spiritual sense!

And this time, it seemed to be a large-scale extraction!

“Tian Xuehong, what on Earth are you doing!”

At this moment, someone at the scene shouted.

Tian Xuehong glanced at him and sneered, “Let’s start with you.”

Then, Tian Xuehong’s mind moved, and the speaker’s face suddenly became distorted!

Then, his spiritual sense was extracted!

The eight light pillars in the distance instantly emitted light and sucked in the spiritual sense!

The speaker’s body slowly fell down, leaving only a body that had lost its soul!

Seeing this scene, everyone panicked, and the scene became a bit chaotic. Some people even screamed!

“All of you, shut up!”Tian Xuehong shouted!

He swept his cold eyes around and said coldly, “Today, I want to borrow everyone’s strength to recover to the peak state. Everyone should have no objections, right?”

“F * ck you!”Someone couldn’t help but curse loudly!

Tian Xuehong sneered again and again. He moved his mind and seized his spiritual sense!

“We must stop him!”Someone shouted and then rushed toward the Sky Blood Rainbow!

However, before he could touch the Sky Blood Rainbow, his body was crushed by the white bones!

The Sky Blood rainbow sneered and said, “To tell you the truth, once this spell is activated, it can’t end. Even if you kill me, you can’t stop it.”

“Do you see the light pillar in the distance? They will automatically absorb the spiritual sense of the martial artists in this spell! Until all the martial artists are absorbed!”

The light pillar looked extremely far away, which meant that it covered an extremely wide area!

“Sky Blood Rainbow, can’t we avoid it too?”A martial artist in the mystic realm shouted.

Sky blood rainbow sneered, “What do you have more than them?”

“You!”

Hearing this, everyone’s faces turned extremely ugly!

Some people couldn’t help but attack Sky Blood Rainbow, but under the protection of white bones, no one could hurt Sky Blood Rainbow!

“To tell you the truth, right now, there are countless martial artists who are being absorbed.”Tian Xue Hong said indifferently.

“And you guys might become the last batch.”

“Tian Xue Hong, you’ve gone too far!”A martial saint was furious and immediately rushed towards Tian Xue Hong!

When Tian Xue Hong saw this, he could not help but sneer, “You’re overestimating yourself.”

After he finished speaking, Bai Gu took large strides forward and sent this martial saint flying with a palm strike!

Then, white bone’s large hand shook and directly smashed the martial saint’s Head!

When the crowd saw this, their expressions became even more unsightly!

Even the martial saint could not withstand a single blow, who else could stop Tian Xuehong? !

“Tian Xuehong, don’t tell me you plan to absorb us as well?”At this moment, Gu Xinghe said with an extremely gloomy expression.

Tian Xuehong glanced at Gu Xinghe and said indifferently, “You? Of course, I will spare your life. After all, you are still useful to me.”

Gu Xinghe’s brows furrowed tightly.

Under the current situation, even if he wasn’t absorbed, it would probably cause public outrage.

However, Gu Xinghe thought about it. In any case, the people here were about to die, so why bother with their thoughts?

“That’s good.”Gu Xinghe nodded and then walked to the side.

When the surrounding people saw this, they were instantly dumbfounded!

Gu Xinghe left just like that? He didn’t care about the lives of everyone?

Was this still the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?

“I won’t allow you to do this!”

At this moment, someone stood out.

The person who stood out was none other than Zhai Xing!

His tall figure seemed to have an extremely safe feeling.

And the aura that he emitted made the crowd’s internal Qi even more excited!

“What a powerful internal Qi!”Qin Yu could not help but exclaim.

“As expected of Zhai Xing. His strength is probably far above that of the other martial saints.”

“With Zhai Xing’s appearance, there might still be a chance!”

Looking at Zhai Xing who had walked out, Tian Xuehong could not help but raise his brows slightly.

“Zhai Xing, stand down. I can spare your life,”Tian Xuehong said indifferently.

Zhai Xing said coldly, “I won’t let you do whatever you want anymore.”

Tian xuehong sneered, “So, you want to try it with my white bone army?”

“Zhai Xing! Come Back!”At this time, Gu Xinghe, who was not far away, shouted.

However, this time, Zhai Xing ignored Gu Xinghe’s words.

He glared at Tian Xuehong and said, “You want to absorb the spiritual sense of all the martial artists. Such a heinous thing will definitely be punished by Heaven!”

“Hahahaha!”The Sky Blood Rainbow could not help but laugh out loud.

“Punished by the heavens? You and I are both in cultivation. How can there be punished by the heavens?”The Sky Blood Rainbow ridiculed.

Zhai Xing narrowed his eyes and said, “It’s still not too late for you to stop now.”

The Sky Blood Rainbow said with a gloomy face, “Am I not clear enough? As long as this spell is activated, it can not be stopped!”

“Then I will kill you!”Zhai Xing’s internal Qi instantly erupted to the limit as he charged towards Sky Blood Rainbow!

“You don’t know life from Death!”Sky Blood Rainbow narrowed his eyes as the white bone army instantly blocked in front of him!

Zhai Xing clenched his iron fist and ruthlessly smashed towards Sky Blood Rainbow!

“Bang!”

His fist collided with the white bone, emitting waves of terrifying buzzing sounds!

However, white bones had the body of a mighty figure and was indestructible. Even if star Seizer was incomparably powerful, he wasn’t able to injure him in the slightest!

“Don’t fight with his body!”Qin Yu hurriedly shouted.

When Star Seizer heard this, he immediately retreated.

His hands quickly moved, and rays of light condensed in his palms.

“Boom!”

As star Seizer’s hands pushed forward, that terrifying light directly approached white bones! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Bai Gu’s combat style was extremely simple, only having a steel-like fist!

A burst of radiance exploded on Bai Gu’s body, and Bai Gu was instantly forced back a few steps!

Seeing this scene, everyone present immediately became excited!

“There’s still a chance!”Someone shouted excitedly.

“Zhai Xing, come back here!”Gu Xinghe, who was not far away, shouted angrily.

However, Zhai Xing ignored him. He once again activated his radiance and blasted it towards the white bone!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

For a moment, the ground was smashed into smithereens!

Countless clouds of dust rose up, obscuring everyone’s line of sight!

Everyone looked nervously at the cloud of dust. Their eyes were filled with fear.

However, as the dust gradually dispersed, the white bone walked out once again!

Clearly, star Seizer’s moves were unable to harm these white bones!

“What a tough body...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but say in a low voice.

Star Seizer’s expression also became somewhat unsightly.

The body of a mighty figure truly lived up to its reputation!

“Hmph, overestimating yourself.”Sky Blood Rainbow waved his hand, and immediately, three more white bones walked out!

One white bone was already enough to leave star seizer in a terrible state, let alone three?

Zhai Xing’s expression gradually turned gloomy. He looked coldly at the skeleton in front of him and slowly raised his hands above his head.

Then, one could see rays of light condensing above his head.

This light looked like stars one after another!

These countless stars-like rays of light landed on Zhai Xing’s ten fingers!

“It’s star Seizer’s famous consummate skill, star seizer!”

“That’s right, it’s said that this technique is unrivalled, and star seizer got its name by relying on this technique!”
