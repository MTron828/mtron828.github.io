The linen-robed elder took the token from the first elder’s hand and could not help but frown.

He sized up the first elder and said, “First Elder, you don’t trust me.”

The first elder shook his head and said, “If I didn’t trust you, why would I give you the token? I’m just worried that things will change.”

The linen-robed old man thought about it and seemed to think that it made sense.

Therefore, he put away the token and said, “Then I’ll head back now.”

After saying that, the linen-robed old man turned around and was about to leave.

At this moment, the first elder suddenly said, “Sixth brother, go with them.”

The Man Called Sixth Brother immediately took a step forward and said, “Yes, First Elder.”

A hint of displeasure immediately appeared on the linen-robed Elder’s face.

Sixth was the Great Elder’s confidant. He had sent sixth to follow him, obviously to monitor him.

“Don’t worry. Sixth is my personal guard. With him around, I can take care of you,”said the Great Elder.

The linen-robed elder sneered in his heart, but his face remained calm.

After taking the token, the group rushed towards the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The first elder and the others continued to guard the divine capital city, waiting for Qin Yu to appear.

As time passed, Qin Yu, who was lying in the divine capital city, finally regained consciousness.

He slowly opened his eyes, and a dazzling golden light immediately entered his vision.

Qin Yu rubbed his eyes and looked at his own body. His entire arm had recovered and was once again dyed with a dark golden light.

This immediately made Qin Yu overjoyed. He hurriedly got up from the ground and looked at his own body in surprise.

As expected, the injured parts had all turned dark golden! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

His entire body looked like it had spots of dark golden color. It was extremely strange.

A relaxed expression appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

“There are still a few injuries that have not recovered. Give me a few more days and my body should turn Golden,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Currently, Qin Yu’s physical body had basically recovered. Both the strength and stiffness of his body had undergone a qualitative change.

Other than spiritual energy, Qin Yu was no different from a normal cultivator.

He tried to clench his fist, and sure enough, the strength of his body had become much denser.

“With my current state, I Won’t be too miserable if I meet that first elder again,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

“I wonder how tough my body is now.”

Qin Yu was slightly excited. He couldn’t wait to go out and fight the first elder!

However, after thinking for a moment, Qin Yu finally decided to wait until his injuries had completely recovered.

At this moment, he suddenly heard a rumbling sound coming from his stomach. He hadn’t eaten for a few days, so he felt hungry like a flood.

“F * ck, I’m starving,”Qin Yu muttered.

He took out a bunch of green bean-like pills from his spatial artifact.

These pills were left behind by Wen Wanyi. Although they were small, they could fill his stomach in an instant.

“Fortunately, I still have these things. I’ll have to store some in the future,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

After eating, Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground and basked in the sun, slowly recovering from his injuries.

Outside, the Grand Elder and the others were still waiting.

Although they didn’t need to eat, the surrounding environment was too harsh. As far as the eye could see, it was an endless desert.

The surrounding spiritual energy was extremely thin. In such an environment, they seemed to be unable to do anything.

“Grand Elder, if this Qin Yu doesn’t come out, do we have to wait for him all the time?”Someone asked.

First elder snorted, “If we don’t catch him, no one can leave this place!”

Then, first elder changed the topic and said lightly, “But you don’t have to worry too much. When Zhen Yue is brought here, he has to come out even if he doesn’t come out!”

...

The Old Man and the other two rushed toward the Heavenly Cloud sect.

On the way, the old man and the other two glanced at each other, and the two old men immediately understood something.

At this time, the three people suddenly stopped and fell from the sky.

Sixth brother, who was chasing behind them, also hurriedly followed.

He frowned and said with some displeasure, “What are you doing? Why did you suddenly stop? Don’t you know that the first elder is still waiting?”

The old man in the linen robe glanced at sixth brother and said with a faint smile, “Why? Can’t We Rest?”

Sixth brother was the first elder’s personal guard. He was used to being arrogant and despotic. In the entire Heavenly Cloud sect, not many people dared to provoke him.

Therefore, sixth brother immediately scolded, “I’m not tired, and you guys are tired? I think you guys are lazy donkeys who waste a lot of time! If you delay the first elder’s important matter, can you pay the responsibility?”

The linen-robed old man narrowed his eyes and then sneered, “We have worked for the Heavenly Cloud sect for so many years, but the first elder is so wary of us. If that’s the case, why should we work for him?”

Sixth Brother’s expression changed. He took two steps back and berated, “What do you mean! What nonsense are you spouting!”

“What do you mean?”The killing intent on the hemp-robed elder’s body grew stronger and stronger.

He took out the first elder’s token and sneered, “With this item, we can empty all the treasures of the first elder and even take the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s treasury! Does he think it’s useful to send a trash like you with us?”
