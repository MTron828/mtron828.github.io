Chapter 973: Chapter 973, the Art of the immortal slaying sect

Yan Jinyao sighed slightly and said, “The fusion of your bloodlines is really beyond my imagination.”

Qin Yu looked at Yan Jinyao coldly and said, “What do you mean?”

Yan Jinyao looked at Kong Yun and said, “Excuse me.”

“I told your mother to get lost!”Kong Yun cursed.

The relationship between the two of them was fine, but after this period of time, Kong Yun’s impression of Yan Jinyao became worse and worse, so he didn’t pamper him.

Yan Jinyao frowned slightly. Although he was a little unhappy, he didn’t argue.

He just stood there and said with a faint smile, “Do you know that normally, it’s very difficult for different people’s bloodlines to fuse together? Those who can get Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline are all blessed by Heaven.”

“But your and Yan Ruoxue’s bloodlines fused together in an extremely short period of time and displayed even more powerful power!”

“A feeling that... 1 + 1 is far greater than 2. Can you understand that?”Yan Jinyao sighed.

The displeased expression on Qin Yu’s face became even more obvious.

“I’ve obtained all the advantages of both your and Yan Ruoxue’s bloodlines. In other words, my bloodline is now the most tyrannical.”Yan Jinyao’s tone contained some pride. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“So you are a bastard?”At this moment, Kong Yun snorted.

Hearing this, Yan Jinyao’s face instantly turned extremely ugly!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but give Kong Yun a thumbs up.

He didn’t expect that the usually quiet Kong Yun would say such a golden sentence.

“Kong Yun, do you know what you are talking about?”Yan Jinyao said with a cold face.

Kong yun sneered and said, “You have two bloodlines. If you’re not a bastard, then what are you?”

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and said, “Kong Yun, I’ve tolerated you for a long time. Don’t be so Shameless.”

“I’m not afraid of You!”Kong Yun stood up immediately.

“Do you want to fight? I’ll come too!”

At this time, Chang Mang also hurried over.

Qin Yu also slowly stood up and said with a sneer, “Yan Jinyao, this battle between you and me has dragged on for a long time. Why don’t we settle this score today?”

Yan Jinyao glanced at the few people in front of him, raised his eyebrows and said, “Do you want to fight together?”

“No need. I can deal with You Alone!”Kong Yun shouted.

“I’ve Long had enough of this title of the second in a thousand years!”

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Don’t worry, I’ll give you a chance.”

“Hurry up and get lost!”Chang Mang scolded.

Yan Jinyao snorted and walked to the side without saying anything else.

“Damn, I’m not happy to see this kid,”Kong Yun couldn’t help but scold.

“I thought he was a gentleman, but I didn’t expect him to be a cunning villain. He’s full of cunning.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, he looks elegant, but he’s a villain in his bones.”

Although he said that, Qin Yu could feel that the current Yan Jinyao’s strength was beyond imagination.

Qin Yu had never felt this kind of strength among his peers.

“I’m afraid that there will be a fierce battle between him and me sooner or later,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, the few of them sat down and waited for the meeting to begin.

Not long after, another acquaintance arrived at the scene.

It was none other than Blackie, who had disappeared for many days.

He came to Qin Yu’s side and sat down at a nearby seat.

“Blackie, you’re here too,”Qin Yu greeted him.

Blackie said coldly, “Since it’s a matter handled by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, I naturally won’t be absent.”

Ever since Granny Qin’s death, Blackie’s hatred for the JINGDU martial arts association was no less than Qin Yu’s.

“Your strength... seems to have become stronger again?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel surprised when he sensed the internal Qi on Blackie’s body.

Blackie nodded and said, “En, after this period of experience, I have indeed gained some insights.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. Blackie was indeed a talent.

“Oh right, I’ll introduce you to a friend when I have time.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of immortal crane.

If he introduced Blackie to Immortal Crane’s demon city, it would probably be a great improvement for him.

Time passed by minute by minute. A moment later, the Mustache Man appeared at the scene sneakily.

Of course, he did not greet Qin Yu. Instead, he found a corner and hid.

In the blink of an eye, it was already noon.

The Sun was high in the sky. Tian Xuehong and Gu Xinghe also arrived at the scene.

“What are you going to do?”Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but ask.

Tian Xuehong put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I’m going to hold a grand and sacred ceremony.”

“Ceremony? What ceremony?”Gu Xinghe was puzzled.

Tian Xuehong didn’t answer this question. Instead, he swept his gaze across the crowd.

Relying on his powerful inner strength, he slowly opened his mouth and said, “Today, I want to show everyone a performance. A splendid performance!”

“Performance?”

The crowd instantly became restless.

Everyone discussed animatedly and were quite puzzled.

“I spent a whole month to arrange this performance. Everyone should feel honored to be able to enjoy it today,”Tian Xuehong continued.

With that, Tian Xuehong waved his hand, and dozens of white bones suddenly appeared in all directions of the martial arts hall.

That powerful pressure made it difficult for people to breathe.

Looking at the dozens of white bones, everyone had a bad premonition.

“What are they doing? Are they not letting us leave?”Chang Mang asked with a frown.

Some people realized that something was wrong and turned around to leave the venue.

However, when he reached the exit, white bones waved its hand and smashed his head!

“The performance hasn’t started yet. Why are you in such a hurry to Leave?”Tian Xuehong shook his head slightly.

Everyone’s expressions instantly became even uglier!

The atmosphere at the venue also became increasingly strange.

“Everyone, what you are about to see is a technique from ten thousand years ago. It’s a sacred and powerful technique!”

Tian Xuehong raised his hands and started mumbling!

Then, a few pillars of light suddenly erupted from the surroundings!

One, two, three... eight pillars of light!

These eight pillars of light pierced through the clouds, and waves of strange internal Qi quickly spread out!

“What... What are these?”

“What are those eight pillars of light that suddenly appeared?”

Qin Yu also felt a sense of unease.

These eight light pillars carried an extremely strange internal Qi that made people’s hair stand on end.

“The sect-raising technique of the immortal slaying sect?”At this moment, Iron Egg’s voice sounded in Qin Yu’s mind.

“Sect-raising technique? What is that?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

Iron Egg’s tone was somewhat solemn as he said, “According to records, the immortal slaying sect relied on this sect-raising technique to build an extremely powerful sect!”

“This technique is very strange. It can extract the spiritual consciousness of people on a large scale and turn it into its own use!”
