Chapter 1629: Chapter 1,629, the Xiao Brothers 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The southern region had a long and glorious history. The people who stood at the peak of the southern region were generation after generation.

And the nine holes were one of them. They stood at the peak of the southern region for several years and could be said to be unrivalled.

It was only until the appearance of the Xiao brothers that the era of the nine holes ended.

But no one had expected that the nine holes had actually attacked the heavenly cloud sect!

“The nine holes that joined hands back then... actually lost to the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect...”

“This period of history... is really unknown. I never expected that the famous nine holes back then actually disappeared because of the heavenly cloud sect...”

“They didn’t die. They were only forced to hide.”

“The seniority of the nine holes... is much older than the heavenly cloud sect. I never expected that they would actually lose!”

“The person who attacked wasn’t Xiao Sheng, but Xiao Hai.”

At this moment, another old man walked out!

This old man also had white hair, but he didn’t have the slightest bit of benevolence. Instead, his entire body was filled with a murderous aura!

“It’s... It’s old monster Hong Kui! He’s also here!”

“As expected, the people of the nine holes aren’t dead! They’re really hiding!”

Old Monster Han Yan looked at Hong Kui and said indifferently, “What do you mean?”

Hong Kui said, “Saint Xiao doesn’t have such a kind heart. The one who thought about the cultivators of the southern region must be Xiao Hai.”

When Old Monster Han Yan heard this, he could not help but sigh and said, “The two brothers of the Xiao family are really unparalleled.”

The elementalist listened with great interest. He put his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile, “So they are just a few losers. Why? Are they seeking death now?”

Old Demon Han Yan ignored the elementalist. Instead, he looked at Hong Mang and said in a deep voice, “We haven’t fought side by side for many years. Let’s have a good fight today!”

After he finished speaking, the internal Qi on the two of them climbed rapidly. The calmness on their bodies disappeared without a trace and was replaced by an indescribable horror!

“The peak of the Almighty Realm!”Someone exclaimed!

However, this did not stop. Their internal Qi continued to climb!

“Half-step reversion void stage!”The elementalist narrowed his eyes and could not help but feel a little surprised!

He looked at the two elders coldly and said, “I didn’t expect that they were actually at the half-step reversion void stage. Not bad.”

“Half-step reversion void stage... in other words, Xiao Hai already had the ability to defeat half-step reversion void stage back then!”

“No, he defeated nine half-step void return experts! Just how terrifying is Xiao Hai!”

“No wonder he was able to forcefully cross the death river and heavily injure three godly monarchs of the northern lands by himself!”

“Senior Xiao Hai...”

Everyone felt sorry for Xiao Hai. With his ability, why did he have to stay in a small southern region?

Even if he went to the central region, he would most likely be an outstanding person!

However, such a top-notch genius had given up his life for the southern region without any hesitation.

For a moment, the entire southern region was in tears.

“Then let me see so for myself how capable your southern region once was!”The elementalist said coldly.

A great battle was about to break out. Just the terrifying internal Qi emitted from their bodies caused the northern border to collapse and the Death River to tremble!

This world had turned into a battlefield, and no one was spared. The cultivators of the northern land fled through the void one after another!

Everyone stared at this scene. They were extremely nervous because this was related to the future of the southern region.

...

Artifact Refining City.

Qin Yu’s body was still being burned and reassembled. Gradually, he was also used to this kind of pain.

Xiao Cao would come to the abandoned pond almost every day to peek at Qin Yu. From what she knew, this was an extremely magical thing.

It was unheard of to temper one’s body like a divine weapon.

After several days of tempering, the temperature of the purplish-red heaven flames in the abandoned pond became lower and lower, and the effect became worse and worse.

On this day, Qin Yu finally opened his eyes.

The skin on his body had been burned red by the flames, and the combination of red and gold was quite magical.

Qin Yu walked out of the abandoned pond and touched his skin. As expected, it was much harder than before.

“The purplish-red heaven flame really lives up to its reputation,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, Xiao Cao happened to run over. When she saw Qin Yu naked, she immediately covered her eyes and screamed.

That voice was extremely ear-piercing and spread across half of the refining workshop. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“What’s Going On!”

The Brawny man heard the voice and hurriedly walked in.

Xiao Cao’s face was red as she pointed in the direction of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu also sensed the awkwardness on his body. He hurriedly covered his lower body and didn’t know what to do for a moment.

“Xiao Cao, you go out first.”The Brawny Man gently patted Xiao Cao’s shoulder.

After Xiaocao left, the strong man walked to Qin Yu and carefully examined him.

The more he looked at him, the more he liked him. In the end, he couldn’t help but praise, “Not bad, really not bad.”

Qin Yu said somewhat awkwardly, “Big Brother, What’s Wrong?”

The strong man laughed and said, “This body of yours is really a good material for refining artifacts!”

Qin Yu coughed dryly. He pointed to the abandoned pool and said, “The temperature of the flames in here is much lower than before. Big Brother, can you help me find some purple-red heaven flames?”

“Of course!”The Brawny man patted his chest.

Then, he first threw a piece of clothing to Qin Yu for him to put on, and then brought Qin Yu to Xiao Cao’s room.

At this moment, Xiao Cao was lying on the bed. Her face was as red as a ripe apple, and her heart was pounding.

She had never seen such a scene before. The scene just now kept replaying in her mind.

“Aiya!”Xiao Cao covered her face and kept turning over on the bed, as if she was ashamed of the thoughts in her heart.

At this moment, the door opened.

The Brawny Man brought Qin Yu in from outside.

Xiao Cao hurriedly sat up from the bed. She didn’t dare to look directly at Qin Yu, so she lowered her head.

“Xiao Cao, bring Qin Yu to other people’s houses later to borrow the abandoned pool,”said the Brawny Man.

Xiao Cao said somewhat anxiously, “Ah, I got it.”

After saying that, she ran out in a panic.

The Brawny man looked at the abnormal Xiao Cao and couldn’t help but mutter, “This child.”

“Big Brother, thank you very much.”Qin Yu cupped his hands to the Brawny Man.

The brawny man waved his hand and said, “It doesn’t matter. I reckon that it won’t be long before you become a celebrity in this weapon refining city.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word.

According to this rate of progress, Qin Yu would need at most three to five abandoned pools before his physical body could step into the reversion void stage.

Although his realm was still far away, once his physical body stepped into the reversion void stage, it would be very difficult for anyone to shake Qin Yu’s body.

That afternoon, Qin Yu followed Xiao Cao and left this weapon refining workshop to look for the next one.

On the way, Xiao Cao lowered her head and didn’t say a word.

When they arrived at the next workshop, Xiao Cao said in a low voice, “We... are here.”
