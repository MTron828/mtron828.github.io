Chapter 274: Invincible Physical Body! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Cheng Cai took a closer look and realized that it was really Qin Yu!

This commotion was actually caused by that Inner Strength Master Hands?

How could this be possible?!

“Swoosh!”

Just as Cheng Cai was lost in thought, a piece of gravel shot toward Cheng Cai like a bullet!

With such a fast speed, Cheng Cai was unable to dodge at all. For a moment, he was frozen in spot. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At this critical moment, a ray of light lit up and shattered the broken stone.

“Stand further away, or you’ll be killed. No one will compensate you with your life,” Jiang Gu said coldly.

Cheng Cai nodded in a daze and quickly stood to the side.

Explosions continued in the sky. The physical collision between the two had reached the max.

Qin Yu’s body was damaged in many places. His thumb and index finger cracked. Even the golden light on his body dimmed a little.

Hui Ming was also having a hard time. His chest was pierced through by Qin Yu’s punch. Fresh blood poured out, making him look extremely horrifying.

“Hahahaha!” Hui Ming became more and more excited as he fought. He had never experienced such a tough body before!

Qin Yu’s face was also flashing with excitement. The thrilling close-hand combat made Qin Yu’s battle intent reach the peak!

The chaotic body and the holy body launched a battle that was at an unprecedented level!

“As expected of the chaotic body. It’s actually on par with me.” Hui Ming licked the fresh blood on his body and sneered.

Qin Yu also shook his fist and said, “Indeed, your body has successfully aroused my interest.”

“Hehe, it’s a pity that you’re going to die here today!”

Hui Ming’s expression turned cold. He suddenly raised his head and roared. Abundant black energy suddenly attacked from all directions in the valley!

“Ah!!”

In the dungeon, those martial artists even let out painful wails!

He felt that the inner strength in his body seemed to have been absorbed, and his entire body became extremely weak!

Hui Ming’s body began to expand, and blue veins bulged in an instant. Under the sunlight, his body flickered with a dark light!

The holy body stepped into another stage in an instant!

“Qin Yu, I’ll let you experience the power of the holy body!” Hui Ming said, and then disappeared into thin air.

In the blink of an eye, Hui Ming’s fist had already arrived in front of Qin Yu!

The terrifying gust of wind from his fist shattered a small mountain behind him!

Jiang Gu, who was at the side, suffered a heavy blow, and was actually sent flying by the gust of wind from his fist!

“Ah!” Qin Yu didn’t dodge. He roared in anger again and again.

He clenched his golden fist and met the punch head-on!

“Boom!”

It was like a muffled thunder in the sky! The huge collision caused a chain effect!

The surrounding mountain rocks were shaken into grains of sand, and the Earth Fiend Valley was instantly turned into ruins!

“Whoosh!”

Under this punch, Qin Yu’s body was sent flying!

Qin Yu’s arm was broken, and he was severely injured.

“Is this really the power that a human can exert...” Cheng Cai was dumbfounded.

He swallowed hard, and couldn’t help but think of the previous contempt he felt for Qin Yu.

“Go to h*ll!” Hui Ming didn’t stop there. He jumped up and thrust several punches in the air before moving toward Qin Yu’s direction!

The ground kept sinking and dust rose dozens of feet high!

Hui Ming stood in mid-air with his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “It’s over.”

Jiang Gu’s expression was a little ugly.

He could clearly feel the terrifying amount of power!

If it was him, he would have been beaten into a pulp!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a golden light flashed!

The golden light cut through Qin Yu’s body!

“Huh? He didn’t die?” Hui Ming raised his eyebrows, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes!

“Whoosh!”

A figure shot out from the ruins!

Qin Yu’s body was wrapped in a strong golden light. Under the golden light, his body looked bigger.

“I didn’t expect that even the second level of the Saintly Body Technique couldn’t withstand it.” Qin Yu looked at his wounded body and couldn’t help but sigh.

This was the first time that the second level of the Saintly Body Technique had failed.

The holy body lived up to its reputation!

“I’m surprised that you didn’t die,” Hui Ming said with a cold smile.

However, he didn’t panic. When fighting with physical strength alone, Hui Ming didn’t need to worry about his inner strength being exhausted.

Qin Yu looked at Hui Ming coldly and said, “Thank you for letting me know that such a strong body exists in this world.”

“So what if a dying person knows?” Hui Ming said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. The internal qi on his body started to surge all over.

“Level three of the Saintly Body Technique!”

As Qin Yu roared, his physical body improved again!

Even his strength had undergone a qualitative change in that instant!

There were nine levels of the Saintly Body Technique, and each level would bring about a great increase in strength!

It was said that ordinary people who cultivated the Saintly Body Technique to the ninth level could even fight against people of all major physiques!

With the support of the third level of the Saintly Body Technique, Qin Yu’s strength had reached another level.

“You’re just putting on an act.” Hui Ming sneered.

“With my holy body, nothing is a threat!”

After saying that, Hui Ming clenched his fist again!

This time, Qin Yu didn’t confront him directly, but dodged to the side.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Three consecutive punches were easily dodged by Qin Yu!

“What, are you afraid?” Hui Ming sneered.

“Isn’t the chaotic body known as the number one constitution in the world? Now, it seems that it’s just so-so.” Hui Ming opened his mouth and revealed a mouthful of yellow teeth.

Qin Yu looked at Hui Ming coldly and said, “I don’t have much time left, so I plan to kill you as soon as possible.”

The consumption of the Saintly Body Technique was extremely great, and this strength didn’t belong to Qin Yu. If this continued to drag on, the outcome would be hard to say.

“How arrogant! If you have such outstanding ability, why bother with me?!” Hui Ming’s body gave off a murderous aura.

He seemed to be tired of it as well. He began to gather his qi energy on his fists.

Countless streams of qi energy wrapped around his fists. The overwhelming might of his fist caused a violent wind to blow.

“Go to h*ll!” Hui Ming roared furiously as he threw a punch at Qin Yu!

“Absolute Beginning... Sacred Fist!”

Qin Yu’s pupils dilated as he roared. All of the golden light gathered on his left fist!

“Boom!”

The power of this collision was unprecedented!

Strong wind blew, and light shone!

The dark clouds in the sky were all dispersed in an instant!

“How strong!” Cheng Cai swallowed hard. He couldn’t believe that this was the power that could be unleashed by a human!

“Crack!”

The moment the two fists collided, the entire fist of the holy body was shattered!

And this terrifying golden light was mountain-toppling as it smashed towards Hui Ming’s body!

“How is this possible?!”

After experiencing the shattered fist, Hui Ming’s expression instantly changed dramatically!
