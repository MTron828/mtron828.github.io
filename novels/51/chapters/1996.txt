1997 The General Meeting Begins

Looking at the elder opposite him coldly, Ain Yu couldn’t care less about his threat.

“What? Are you planning to attack me in Sky City?” Qin Yu questioned coldly.

The elder placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I will not attack you for the time being, but I’m afraid you can’t be arrogant for long.”

“I think you’re just a Semi-Saint. It won’t be easy for you to kill me.” Qin Yu mocked.

Jue Wu also came forward. If they joined forces, it would be very difficult for a Semi-Saint to defeat them.

The elder sneered and said, “Hmph! There are differences among Semi-Saints.”

Then he looked at Jue Wu and said, “I can let you off as the closed-door disciple of Dean Lei. However, if you insist on stopping me, I’ll kill you first and ask for forgiveness from Dean Lei later! ”

“You can give it a try,” Jue Wu sneered and said.

This elder did not waste any more time with Qin Yu and turned to leave.

However, this brief conflict still attracted numerous gazes. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

They had just met but already confronted each other with eyeball to eyeball. It would probably be very difficult to make peace.

The surrounding people shook their heads. Some advised Qin Yu to leave Sky City as soon as possible, while others asked Qin Yu to ask the prince for help.

After acknowledging them all, Qin Yu brought Jue Wu and left the place.

“The Strive of the Great Era” would begin the following day. People were still pouring into Sky City.

Walking on the streets, Qin Yu and Jue Wu looked indifferent on the surface but were somewhat worried.

Initially, Qin Yu had planned to change his appearance and leave Sky City. However, Qin Yu felt Jue Wu would probably be injured if he were to leave.

Wen Da had died because of Qin Yu, and he did not want any more untoward incidents to happen to the people around him.

“I wonder if the man with the mustache will be here,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

With his strength, Qin Yu could easily escape if he were to set up a spatial formation.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu failed to find traces of the man with the mustache in Sky City.

Time flew, and soon, it was the day of “The Strive of the Great Era”.

In the Great Hall of the Imperial Palace, the prince was on the throne while the representatives of the nine great aristocratic families sat on both sides.

There were immortal fruits and tea in front of them. Looking carefully, this tea was actually Enlightenment Tea.

Outside the palace, many people were watching. They wanted to see the outcome of the discussion among the nine great aristocratic families.

In the Great Hall, the prince stood up and said, smiling, “Welcome to Sky City.”

However, everyone’s attitude was rather cold, and no one responded.

The attitude of these people seemed to have foretold something.

“Looks like they’re going to fall out completely with the royal family,” someone whispered.

“Hmph! The nine great aristocratic families have been pretending for so long. I’m afraid they don’t want to pretend anymore.”

“So what if they pretend or not? Who can restrict them? Even if you’re angry, you have to endure it!”

Everyone discussed animatedly, but no one dared to say much.

The prince sat down again. He knew he was not the main character of this meeting, so he did not speak at all.

“Your Highness, Great Xia has fallen for many years. It was because of the alliance of our aristocratic families that we could preserve Sky City and your current position,” someone spoke.

The prince bowed slightly and said, “I remember the kindness of everyone.”

“However, Your Highness is rather unkind taking in the companion of that mysterious person of the demon race,” the elder of the Si family said coldly.

Qin Yu, watching from the outside, immediately felt something was wrong.

D*mn it!

These people were planning to kill two birds with one stone! They pushed the blame onto Qin Yu and, at the same time, took the opportunity to reprimand the prince and revoke the current status of Sky City!

The prince was not stupid. He naturally understood what this meant.

Therefore, he stood up and said, “That’s not true. Anyone can enter and leave Sky City. I didn’t take anyone in.

“Besides, I don’t know anything about the companion of the mysterious person of the demon race you mentioned.”

“You don’t know?” the Si family’s elder sneered and said. “Have you forgotten what happened at the auction? The mysterious person of the demon race had teamed up with Qin Yu to steal the treasure from the auction house! He is the companion of that mysterious person!”

As soon as he said that, the atmosphere instantly turned extremely cold.

Qin Yu, hiding in the dark, had an even colder expression.

Although he had guessed the intentions of these people, he was still angry when he heard them say this with his own ears.

“Qin Yu is the companion of the mysterious person of the demon race? Do you have any evidence?” the prince asked in surprise.

The elder of the Yao family snorted coldly and said, “The president of the auction house, Yang Tong, can testify!”

With that, Yang Tong walked out from the crowd.

He came to the Great Hall and bowed to everyone.

“President Yang?” The prince frowned slightly.

“Your Highness, I did see Qin Yu splitting the spoils with a mysterious person outside Sky City. He even left behind a provocative sentence in an extremely arrogant manner,” President Yang said with his hands behind his back.

With that, President Yang waved his hand, and a scene instantly appeared in front of everyone.

This scene was the words left behind by the man with the mustache.

The prince’s expression was ugly. He did not know what to say for a moment.

...

“Your Highness, we’ve kindly preserved your identity as a prince. Is this how you repay us?” Elder Yao sneered and said. “Don’t you know that demon race villain has killed many of the heirs of our nine great aristocratic families?”

The prince’s expression was somewhat ugly.

He did not expect that this group of people would actually come to question him.

“Your Highness, isn’t this rather unrighteous?” another elder said.

The prince frowned and said, “I’m afraid President Yang’s one-sided words can’t prove anything. Moreover… If Qin Yu is related to that mysterious person, why didn’t anyone help him when he fought with the Semi-Saints of the Si family?”

“Your Highness, what do you mean by that?” the elder of the Si family slammed the table and stood up. A powerful internal qi swept out, and the killing intent was directed at the prince.

At this moment, two old and withered elderly men appeared beside the prince.

They stood beside the prince, and their peaceful internal qi instantly enveloped the prince.

“What do you mean? Do you want to attack Your Highness?” one of the elderly men said slowly.

Although the speed of his speech was tremendously slow, it was incredibly intimidating!

Even the elder of the Si family felt tremendous pressure.

...

“Of course, I won’t attack Your Highness.” The Si family’s elder snorted coldly.

“But you should at least give us an explanation for this matter.”

The elderly man beside the prince waved his hand, and a powerful internal qi instantly rushed toward the elder of the Si family.

Under this internal qi, the elder of the Si family was pressed down to his seat.

“Sit down and talk,” the elderly man said indifferently.

When everyone saw this, their expressions could not help but change.

The old man’s palm strike seemed casual, but he easily pressed the elder of the Si family to the seat. Such strength caused fear among the people.
