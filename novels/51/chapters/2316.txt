2317 The Command of the Earth

“Crack!”

Soon, it extended to the entire demonic egg. In the countless cracks, a dim green light flickered from time to time.

It looked incredibly eerie.

“This demonic egg has been devouring the spiritual energy of the Sumeru ring. It has also devoured the ghostly qi I emitted when I cultivated the Soul Torment Mind Technique. What could it hatch into?”

Qin Yu’s divine sense felt like being stung by a hornet just now. He dared not continue probing.

“Hello, Jue Wu.”

Qin Yu turned his head around and could only see Jue Wu sleeping soundly on the ground.

“Huff! Huff! Huff!”

A clear breathing sound suddenly came from the demonic egg.

“Elder Guai, do you know the origin of this demonic egg?”

“I don’t know anything about this thing at all. However, from the internal qi it emits, it should be related to the ghost realm.”

Elder Guai looked at the demonic egg carefully but did not have a clue.

The masked woman had appeared to protect the demonic egg before. This demonic egg was definitely related to the masked woman. Could it be the masked woman’s previous spiritual beast?

However, this demonic egg was obtained by chance when Jue Wu cracked the stone.

The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more his head hurt. He decided to ignore it.

“Qin Yu, come out!”

Mei Li’s voice came from outside the Sumeru ring.

“Hmm?”

With a thought, Qin Yu returned to the mountain peak.

He scanned the area with his divine sense and saw dozens of cultivators holding tokens and heading in all directions.

Did a new Mystic Realm appear?

“But something important must have happened. You can use your mind to sense the command and get the information,” Mei Li explained.

Qin Yu scanned using his divine sense, and a message instantly appeared before him.

“A large number of monsters have appeared in the Azure Ridge Continent. Nearby cultivators immediately go to provide support.”

“The Azure Ridge Continent, isn’t that where Azure Firmament Sect is?”

Qin Yu took out a voice transmission talisman. There was a message asking for help from Piao Ruoyun.

Looking at the time, it was sent last night. At that time, he was studying the demonic egg in the Sumeru ring and did not see this message.

Qin Yu took out the warship from the Sumeru ring, and it started to move after he injected a stream of spirit energy into it.

“I didn’t expect you to be so concerned about these things.”

Mei Li did not board the ship. She obviously did not want to go.

Qin Yu ignored her. Piao Ruoyun had once teamed up with him, so he must help her no matter what.

Along the way, Qin increased the warship’s speed to the maximum and injected the highest amount of spiritual energy into it.

Soon, he arrived at the Azure Ridge Continent.

At this moment, the Azure Ridge Continent was filled with an endless stench of blood and severed limbs scattered all over the ground.

The grass on the ground was nearly all stained with blood.

As far as the eye could see, corpses were littered on the ground.

Along the way, Qin Yu discovered that not only cultivators but even ordinary people were killed.

Many people had been eaten, leaving only their heads randomly impaled on wooden forks.

Although the Path of Heaven was cruel and the fittest survived, this scene still made Qin Yu tremendously furious.

In a village where ordinary humans should be living…

There was almost no sign of life at this moment. A small head of a four-year-old child popped out.

She crawled out from beneath a pile of grain with difficulty.

“Mom, Mom, get up quickly. The bad guys are gone.”

On the other side, three children were sitting on the ground in a daze.

Four people were hung upside down before them. Their eyes, noses, ears, and many other parts of their bodies were hollowed out.

The organs were placed in front of the children.

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly. This was simply torture.

He scanned with his divine sense. These monsters were using almost the same method.

They killed the adults cruelly and let the children witness the process.

Some children screamed non-stop, completely crushed mentally.

“This is the monster race’s method of planting fear into the human heart. The internal qi of fear and terror is a great nourishing food that the monster race can absorb, just like the spiritual energy of cultivators.”

Elder Guai sighed. “It’s been a long time since the monster race last appeared in his galaxy’s purgatory. Now that they’re making a comeback, it looks like the chaotic era is coming.”

Qin Yu’s expression was gloomy. With a move of his body, he arrived at the entrance of the Azure Firmament Sect.

At this moment, soaring demonic qi filled the Azure Firmament Sect which was full of green mountains, clear waters, and spiritual energy.

The demonic qi contained the smell of roasted meat. It was the flesh of the people of Azure Firmament Sect.

The flesh of these cultivators was a great nourishing food for them. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Help!”

“Kill me, please!”

“Elder, save me!”

…

The sect was full of screams as countless demonic cultivators shuttled through.

Some were directly beaten to death and made into barbecued meat. Some were even more miserable. They were caught and injured directly and eaten.

At this moment, dying fast had become a luxurious wish.

The sect was full of the wails of the people of Azure Firmament Sect.

“How did one of them escape? The spiritual energy on this person’s body is so strong.”

A monster slightly taller than a human and looked similar to a human suddenly appeared beside Qin Yu.

His face was stained with blood, and a large piece of meat was at the corner of his mouth.

A stream of demonic qi clashed with Qin Yu’s divine sense. He suddenly opened his mouth and wanted to bite off Qin Yu’s head.

“Whoosh!”

Qin Yu’s body did not move at all, and the claws formed by his divine sense directly pierced through the monster’s brain.

Wherever he passed, the monsters fell to the ground.

Unlike humans, these monsters did not seem to be afraid.

Even though Qin Yu killed the monsters all the way, the blood of the monsters was even redder.

The smell of blood seemed to stimulate the fierceness of the monsters even more. They still pounced on Qin Yu one after another.

A flame burst out from Qin Yu’s body, burning dozens of monsters around him into ashes.

Qin Yu straightaway arrived in front of the main hall. He frowned.

At this moment, many monsters gathered in front of the hall.

These monsters had a massive internal qi, much stronger than the ones he encountered in the periphery.

There was an altar in the middle, and the heads of nearly 50 cultivators were placed in the middle of the altar.

Qin Yu had seen some of these people before. They were all Reversion Void Stage and True Saint cultivation realm cultivators.

In front of the altar, Piao Ruoyun and a group of elders were kneeling.

On the altar, a head was still twitching slightly, and blood was still gushing out of the corpse on the ground.

Among those demonic cultivators, a naked old man was holding a bone staff.

He chanted an incomprehensible incantation, and then, in the void, a surge of internal qi landed on his body.

Suddenly, his bones made cracking sounds, and his body expanded by more than half.
