Chapter 2034: Opening of the Chaos Grave

After Si Shiyue left, Saintess Gu looked at Yao Xi and sighed. “Brother Yao, why are you doing this? Why do you want to anger Si Shiyue?”

“Saintess Gu, once the Si family gets the chaotic body, will we still have the chance to compete with them in the future?” Yao Xi smiled faintly. “Not only does Si Shiyue have the bloodline of the Si family’s ancestors, but he also has a strong physique. This itself is unfair.”

“What about the other cultivators? What about those cultivators who did not have powerful bloodlines or special physiques? To them, our existence itself is already unfair,” Saintess Gu shook her head and said.

“Saintess Gu really cares for everyone.” Yao Xi raised his eyebrows.

!!

“There is only one Yan Tianming and one Demon Emperor in the world,” Yao Xi said.

Seeing this, the Saintess Gu did not say anything else.

The nine great aristocratic families seemed united, but in reality, undercurrents were surging.

The premise of unity was that they could check and balance each other. Once this situation was broken by one party, the peace of the nine great aristocratic families would completely end.

Another day passed, and cultivators continued to gather near the Chaos Grave.

Qin Yu watched coldly from the side, fully prepared.

“You were the one who ruined my plans that day. Today, I’ll kill you in the Chaos Grave!” someone shouted and immediately attacked.

Too many cultivators were near the Chaos Grave, and many hostile sects were fighting here.

There were also young geniuses fighting over who was better, making the Chaos Grave tremendously lively.

Qin Yu lay under the tree with his eyes closed slightly, waiting for the Chaos Grave to open.

Fortunately, no one noticed him during the entire process, and he was happy to be quiet.

“The Jiang family is here.”

At this moment, someone exclaimed.

Looking up, he saw a group of people passing through layers of barriers and arriving at the Chaos Grave.

When Qin Yu saw the leader of the Jiang family clearly, he was stunned on the spot!

It was because this person was none other than Jiang He! The elderly man who had taught Qin Yu the fighting word formula when he was on Earth!

“Senior Jiang He…” Qin Yu immediately got up. He looked at Jiang He with incomparable excitement in his heart!

When he was on Earth back then, he and Ye Qing were known as the number one people on Earth. However, after arriving at the Holy Region, they completely lost contact.

He had never expected Jiang He to go to the Jiang family!

“Jiang He, the newest member of the Jiang family’s younger generation.”

“I heard that he is called the God of War of the younger generation. Hahaha! Interesting.”

“This person has a secret technique. With his powerful secret technique, he is almost invincible among his peers.”

Back then on Earth, Jiang He was an elderly man, a senior. But after coming to the Holy Region, he could only be considered a young man.

Therefore, Jiang He’s appearance also attracted the attention of many people.

Qin Yu was tremendously excited in his heart. Back then, Jiang He had helped Qin Yu a lot and even taught Qin Yu an incredibly mysterious technique. Qin Yu naturally would not forget this kindness.

He took a deep breath and could only suppress his excitement. There was no way for him to acknowledge him.

Jiang He looked old as he was, very different from the other young Holy Sons. He looked out of the ordinary.

In the crowd, no one would have thought that he was a young cultivator less than a hundred years old.

The moment Jiang He appeared, Yan Yunfan suddenly appeared and blocked Jiang He.

“You are Jiang He?” Yan Yunfan said coldly.

“Yes, I am. Who are you?” Jiang He bowed slightly and said.

“I’m Yan Yunfan from the Yan family. I’ve long heard that your cultivation is unparalleled, and I’ve always wanted to experience it,” Yan Yunfan said coldly.

“That’s just an undeserved reputation. It’s not worth mentioning,” Jiang He cupped his hands and said.

“Whether or not it’s an undeserved reputation, I will know after we fight!” After Yan Yunfan snorted coldly, he suddenly attacked. A spear was aimed at Jiang He’s glabella!

He used a killing move the moment he attacked. The technique was incomparably fierce!

Jiang He raised his palm, and a dazzling light enveloped him, blocking this attack.

“Go to hell!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yan Yunfan would not give him a chance. After he shouted, he stabbed out 3,800 spears in the blink of an eye, and each was incredibly sharp!

The entire earth rumbled non-stop. The already chaotic dao technique erupted with a strange internal qi at this moment. The void continued to collapse, and it was incredibly terrifying!

Jiang He’s body was covered in holy light. He did not dodge or avoid as he fought with Yan Yunfan.

This battle started too suddenly, and many people did not even come to their senses.

As for those young people who were competing, they immediately stopped and looked at Jiang He and Yu Yan Yunfan.

Qin Yu was silent. He looked in the direction of Jiang He without saying a word. There was even some anticipation in his heart.

Back then, Jiang He was known as the number one genius. Therefore, his talent naturally did not need to be elaborated. Qin Yu was not worried at all.

The sky rumbled non-stop. In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged hundreds of moves.

Jiang He looked incredibly calm, but his every move was fierce. Even Yan Yunfan looked miserable.

However, Yan Yunfan was not afraid. The spear in his hand was like a true dragon. Wherever it passed, the earth trembled, and heaven shook!

The two clearly did not use their true abilities. They seemed to be testing the waters.

However, this short test was tremendously shocking!

...

“Is this the battle between the geniuses of this generation? It’s too terrifying!”

“A random wisp of internal qi that overflows is probably enough to take our lives!”

“Buzz!”

At this moment, Si Liuhe made a move and stopped the battle.

Yan Yunfan and Jiang He landed on the ground and looked at each other.

“You’re indeed quite capable. Your strength is probably not weaker than the Holy Son of your Jiang family,” Yan Yunfan said coldly.

“You’re not bad either” Jiang He bowed slightly and said.

“After the matter of the Chaos Grave is over, I will definitely fight you!” Yan Yunfan stabbed the spear in his hand into the ground. After shouting, he turned around and left.

Jiang He’s expression was calm, and no one could tell what he was thinking.

“After so many years, I wonder if Senior Jiang He’s fighting word formula has improved,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Even Qin Yu had already comprehended the fifth level of the fighting word formula. Thus he expected Jiang He to be at a higher level.

...

Although the nine great aristocratic families seemed to have a deep relationship with each other, everyone with discerning eyes knew that after the opening of the Chaos Grave, the disputes among the younger generation of the nine great aristocratic families would probably really begin. At that time, they could determine who was stronger or weaker.

“Boom!”

At this moment, the ground suddenly trembled! From the center of the Chaos Grave, tremendously terrifying primal chaos qi erupted one after another! The internal qi soared into the sky, drowning the earth and changing the dao technique. For a moment, everyone’s hearts seemed to be pressed down by a huge rock!

What followed closely was an incredibly terrifying death qi!
