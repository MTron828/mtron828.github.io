2078 I Shall Wait for You Here

Upon hearing the elderly man’s words, strange expressions flashed across everyone’s faces.

The Lord Donghuang?

Calling himself a lord in front of the Si family and demanding respect, was he crazy?

Seeing everyone’s expressions, Lord Donghuang was not only unafraid. Instead, he thought everyone was afraid of him. He continued smiling and said, “Aren’t you all disrespecting me by barging into my Donghuang?”

Si Qianjing’s expression became increasingly displeased. He looked at Lord Donghuang as if he was a fool.

“Of course, if you’re willing to apologize to me, I can understand this matter. After all…”

“Pfft!”

Before Lord Donghuang could finish his sentence, a True Saint’s eyes turned cold and directly shook him into a bloody mist!

“When the cat’s away, the mice will play!” the True Saint said coldly.

The faces of the natives of Donghuang turned tremendously ugly. Their faces were ashen, and their hearts trembled!

He was the lord they had personally chosen! He represented the most formidable power in Donghuang!

But now, he was directly shaken into a bloody mist by the other party’s gaze!

“Quickly… Run!” someone shouted, and the scene instantly turned into chaos. Countless people fled desperately!

Si Qianjing glanced at Dragon Burial Cave coldly. He raised his voice and said coldly, “Qin Yu, hand over the Traceless Immortal Scripture!”

Xiao Sheng opened his eyes.

Traceless Immortal Scripture?

Qin Yu actually obtained the Traceless Immortal Scripture?

Xiao Sheng remained silent, and his expression quickly returned to normal.

In Dragon Burial Cave, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly as if he ignored Si Qianjing. No matter how Si Qianjing shouted, Qin Yu did not show any signs of leaving Dragon Burial Cave.

“This Qin Yu is really shameless,” a cultivator from the Si family said coldly.

Si Qianjing put his hands behind his back and said coldly, “Who is willing to bring him out?”

“Supreme Elder, let me do it!” a cultivator quickly stood up and walked to Si Qianjing.

He was a powerful Semi-Saint who had been in the Si family for 500 years. His strength was unfathomable.

Si Qianjing nodded slightly and said, “Try to capture him alive. After all, only he knows where the Traceless Immortal Scripture is.”

“Supreme Elder, please be rest assured.” The Semi-Saint bowed and headed straight for Dragon Burial Cave.

In Dragon Burial Cave, Qin Yu hung the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror above his head and adjusted the internal qi on his body to the extreme.

Although Qin Yu had the natural advantage in Dragon Burial Cave, he still felt uncertain about facing the True Saint Realm.

However, when Qin Yu saw a Semi-Saint walk in, he was instantly stunned.

“Semi-Saint? Si family sent a Semi-Saint to die?” Qin Yu muttered.

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the Semi-Saint was furious. “Qin Yu, you’re so arrogant. See how I kill you!”

However, just as he took half a step into Dragon Burial Cave, his expression instantly turned tremendously ugly.

The spiritual power in his body was instantly suppressed, and his divine sense was like being roasted on fire.

Not to mention attacking, even lifting his feet became incredibly difficult!

“D*mn!” The Semi-Saint’s expression changed drastically. He turned around and wanted to escape, but it was too late!

A golden light instantly descended and smashed his head!

“Even if I’m not in Dragon Burial Cave, I’m not afraid of you.” Qin Yu sneered.

With the help of the tribulation magical artifact and the unique environment of Dragon Burial Cave, Qin Yu would not be afraid even if he were to face a True Saint, not to mention a Semi-Saint.

Outside Dragon Burial Cave, the Si family waited for a long time, but nothing happened.

“What happened?” Si Qianjing frowned and asked.

“I’ll send someone to investigate now,” the True Saint beside him stood up and said. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After that, the Si family sent people to Dragon Burial Cave again.

However, after sending several waves of people, the result was as expected. Nothing happened, and every one’s internal qi disappeared silently.

Si Qianjing’s expression grew colder. He looked in Qin Yu’s direction. Qin Yu said in a low voice, “He knew that a Semi-Saint was no match for him, but he still sent them to their deaths. What an idiot!”

None of them dared to speak. They looked at Si Qianjing, unwilling to burn their blood essence.

Si Qianjing took a deep breath and said, “Surround this place. No one is allowed to enter!”

“Yes, sir!” thousands of cultivators shouted simultaneously.

After that, Si Qianjing led the three True Saints to walk toward Dragon Burial Cave.

“I advise you guys not to enter Dragon Burial Cave.” At this moment, Si Qianjing suddenly heard a voice.

Xiao Sheng’s voice instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

If Xiao Sheng did not speak, they probably would not notice that someone was sitting there.

“Who are you?” a True Saint walked forward and asked indifferently.

Xiao Sheng did not answer the question. He pointed at Dragon Burial Cave and said, “It’s tremendously dangerous inside. Even if you’re a True Saint, you can’t withstand it because the suppression in the Dragon Burial Cave has nothing to do with the cultivation realm.”

Si Qianjing certainly had heard of Dragon Burial Cave. Rumor had it that a true dragon was sleeping there, but no one could confirm it.

However, as True Saints, they naturally had the confidence to be unafraid of anything.

“Oh? It had nothing to do with the cultivation realm! What does it have to do with then?” Si Qianjing’s interest was piqued.

“Faith,” Xiao Sheng said expressionlessly.

“In this world, only two people can remain safe and sound in the Dragon Burial Cave.”

One was Qin Yu, and the other was Xiao Hai.

Of course, Xiao Sheng did not say this out loud.

Si Qianjing narrowed his eyes, and wisps of Holy Power emanated from his body.

This Holy Power had a strong sense of oppression and it headed straight for Xiao Sheng!

The Holy Power pervaded Xiao Sheng’s body as if it wanted to suppress him forcefully.

However, Xiao Sheng’s body stood firm. He was incredibly determined.

“You have some ability,” Si Qianjing said indifferently.

“Since you know so much about Dragon Burial Cave, come with us.”

With that, they walked toward Xiao Sheng.

“F*ck, what does it have to do with others? If you want to come in, you may come in. I’ll wait for you!” In Dragon Burial Cave, Qin Yu instantly became anxious.

He had already involved Xiao Hai, so he definitely could not involve Xiao Sheng now!

Hearing Qin Yu’s voice, Si Qianjing narrowed his eyes, sneered, and said, “So, you are still alive!”

“Cut the crap. I’ll wait for you in Dragon Burial Cave. I’ve already killed the trash you sent earlier. You’re next!” Qin Yu shouted.

Before he finished speaking, a few corpses flew out of Dragon Burial Cave.

These corpses were the Semi-Saints sent by the Si family.

“You’re courting death.” Si Qianjing’s face instantly turned cold.

“Even Qin Yu can be safe and sound, so we naturally have nothing to be afraid of.” The other two True Saints also walked forward.
