Chapter 964: Chapter 964, extermination

He Teng took the document, turned around, and walked out of the office.

As soon as he walked out, he bumped into Zhai Xing.

Zhai Xing had a very bad impression of He Teng. When he saw the document in his hand, he immediately said with a sullen face, “Bring it over for me to see.”

He Teng originally wanted to refuse, but the oppressive feeling that Zhai Xing gave off made him have no choice but to comply.

Looking at the list of names on the document, Zhai Xing’s expression became even more unsightly.

He returned the document to he teng, then quickly walked into the office.

“Young master Gu, You... you want to make a move against the Jingdu aristocratic families?”Zhai Xing asked with an extremely unsightly expression.

Gu Xinghe lightly snorted, “Yes, they have no respect for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association at all. I have to do something.”

“But... isn’t exterminating a family too cruel?”Zhai Xing said in a low voice.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Cruel? I don’t think so. Besides, this was done by the Heavenly Blood Rainbow, not me!”

“What you did is no different from what the Heavenly Blood Rainbow did. Can’t those aristocratic families guess your relationship with the Heavenly Blood Rainbow? !”Zhai Xing shouted.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “That’s what I Want! If they can’t guess that it has something to do with me, then what’s the point of me doing all this? How can I Make Them Afraid of Me?”

“This way, I can make tianxue Hong take the blame and Make Them Afraid of me. Killing two birds with one stone!”

Zhai Xing was dumbfounded.

He looked at the Gu Xinghe in front of him, whom he had grown up with, and felt a little unfamiliar.

Such ruthlessness made Zhai Xing feel a little sorry for him.

“Alright, you don’t have to ask what you shouldn’t ask,”Gu Xinghe said with a sullen face.

Zhai Xing gritted his teeth, and in the end, he could only bear the pain and sigh.

...

The next day.

Qin Yu strolled on the nine pinnacles mountain every day.

He sometimes walked to the top of the mountain, and sometimes to the foot of the mountain. All he could think about was his own dao techniques.

Just as he walked to the top of the mountain, he suddenly heard a cry from the room.

Hearing the cry, Qin Yu rushed into the room.

As soon as he entered, he saw Zhuang Teng’s face was full of anger, and his face was full of tears.

He grabbed the Taihe sword and was about to rush down the mountain as if he had gone mad.

Yao Meng and the others held onto Zhuang Teng tightly and kept advising him, “Zhuang Teng, calm down!”

Zhuang teng screamed, “How can I calm down! I’m going to kill Tian Xuehong, I’m going to kill him! ! !”

Qin Yu rushed forward and frowned, “What’s going on? What Happened?”

Kong Yun handed Qin Yu his phone.

On the phone, there was an extremely bloody picture with a shocking title:

Late Last Night, the Zhuang family was exterminated. Currently, it was speculated that it was done by the Heavenly Blood Rainbow.

In the picture, dozens of people from the Zhuang family were lying in a pool of blood.

Their bodies looked almost shriveled, and their spiritual senses were drawn out. It indeed looked like it was done by the Heavenly Blood Rainbow.

Looking at this picture, Qin Yu’s heart suddenly pounded, and his expression became even more unsightly.

“How could this be...”Qin Yu muttered softly and looked at Zhuang Teng with heartache.

Zhuang Teng was an extremely hospitable person, and he had an extremely close relationship with his family.

Now that his entire family had been wiped out, how could he not be angry!

“Sob, SOB, sob...”

Zhuang Teng covered his face and knelt on the ground.

The hand that was holding the Taihe sword also unconsciously loosened.

“If it weren’t for me taking the Taihe sword away, they wouldn’t have died... They would definitely be able to protect themselves. It’s all my fault, it’s All My Fault...”Zhuang Teng collapsed on the ground, tears streaming down his face.

Qin Yu was even more upset. Waves of uncontrollable killing intent filled his heart!

Zhuang Teng had taken out the Taihe Sword in order to save himself.

Now that such a thing had happened, Qin Yu was naturally responsible as well. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Please let me go. I’m begging you. I want to go home... I want to kill Tian Xuehong...”Zhuang Teng kept sobbing, looking extremely pitiful.

“Even if you go down the mountain now, can you kill Tian Xuehong?”The people around could not help but sigh.

“We understand your feelings, but isn’t their goal to make us go down the mountain?”

Zhuang Teng raised his head and said in pain, “I want to go down the mountain to collect my parents’bodies. is that not possible?”

“I’m the only one left in the Zhuang family. If I don’t go back, their bodies will definitely be lying in the wilderness...”

Hearing this, everyone was speechless.

“I’ll go down the mountain with you.”

At this moment, Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a deep voice.

Hearing this, everyone immediately frowned.

“Qin Yu, why are you also making a fuss? You were their target to begin with. If you go down the mountain, they will not let you off!”Yao Meng said.

Qin Yu shook his head. He looked at everyone and said, “If this was really done by the Heavenly Blood Rainbow, then the Zhuang family will not be the only one.”

“Only when someone goes down the mountain can we quell this disaster. And that person can only be me,”Qin Yu said.

“I’ll go with you!”Chang Mang said hurriedly.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “There’s no need. One more person and one less person. It doesn’t make much sense.”

Then, Qin Yu looked at Zhuang Teng. He bent down and said, “Zhuang Teng, I’ll bring their corpses back to you.”

Zhuang Teng grabbed his hair and said in pain, “Okay, okay...”

Qin Yu said goodbye to everyone, then turned around and prepared to go down the mountain.

“Wait...”

At this moment, Zhuang Teng suddenly called out to Qin Yu.

He handed the Taihe Sword to Qin Yu and said in a trembling voice, “If you can kill Tian Xuehong, I hope... I hope you can use this sword to kill him...”

Qin Yu could not help but be stunned. Then, he pushed the sword back.

“Zhuang Teng, I hope you can take revenge on your own.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“If you can’t do it, I will help you do it.”

“No matter what, I will let you kill Tian Xuehong with your own hands!”

Zhuang Teng was stunned. He looked at Qin Yu in a daze and tears flowed out again.

“Good, good...”Zhuang Teng clenched his teeth.

Qin Yu did not say anything more. He turned around and walked down the mountain.

At this moment, other than feeling heartache, there was also a hidden anger in the depths of Qin Yu’s heart.

The anger was like a ferocious beast being locked in a cage, and this cage seemed to be about to be broken through.
