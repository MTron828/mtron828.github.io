Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the woman wasn’t angry.

She smiled and said, “I might be able to help you.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “I don’t need it. Besides, you can’t help me with anything.”

Seeing this, the woman took out a business card from her bag and placed it in front of Qin Yu.

“If you need help, you can contact me,” the woman said.

After putting down the business card, she stood up and left.

Qin Yu picked up the business card and took a look. He found that the woman’s name was Su Qian.

Besides her name, there was nothing else.

“Inexplicable.” Qin Yu’s hand burst into flames and burned the business card into ashes.

For the current Qin Yu, he wouldn’t easily trust others, let alone a stranger.

The sky was getting darker and darker. Many rich young masters had come to this bar and started their nightlife.

Qin Yu silently drank his wine and quietly waited for the other party to appear.

As time passed, the bar became noisier and noisier.

From time to time, one could see people arguing, playing, and even conducting indecent acts.

And here, Qin Yu also saw how ridiculous the private lives of these rich people were.

Soon, it was nine o’clock in the evening.

At this time, three people walked in from the door.

As soon as they entered the door, they attracted countless gazes. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

These rich young masters rushed over to greet them.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and a trace of coldness flashed across his face.

These three people were all in the Martial Marquis realm. Although they had restrained their internal qi, it was still unable to conceal their extraordinary strength.

“It’s the three of them,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He wasn’t in a hurry to make a move. Instead, he quietly observed in the dark.

A group of people surrounded the three of them and constantly flattered them. There were also people who wanted to acknowledge them as their mentors.

After their conversation, Qin Yu learned that the three people’s names were respectively: Guan Shan, Guan Shui, and Guan Hai.

Their names were very simple. It was said that they were given by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

They weren’t old, at most in their early thirties.

Although they were talented, without the power of their bloodline, they definitely wouldn’t be able to compete with the young masters of Jingdu.

“Brother Shan, Brother Kong has a very high evaluation of the three of you.”

“Yes, there aren’t many people in Jingdu who are your opponents right now, right?”

The eldest brother of the three, Guan Shan, smiled and said, “Other than those at the peak, we shouldn’t be afraid of anyone in the younger generation.”

“Brother Shan, tell us the news. How did the Jingdu Martial Arts Association create such powerhouses?” Someone asked.

Guan Shan didn’t hide anything. He smiled and said, “These are the resources of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will openly recruit young people. As long as you have enough talent, you will have a chance!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his fists!

A murderous aura pressed straight towards the three people!

These bastards actually treated Yan Ruoxue as their resource! How could Qin Yu endure this?!

The burst of murderous aura immediately attracted the attention of the three people.

The three people exchanged a glance, and then walked towards Qin Yu.

They sat beside Qin Yu and coldly said, “You seem to be very hostile towards us.”

Qin Yu forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart and coldly said, “So what if I am?”

“Oh yeah? How cocky,” Guan Shan narrowed his eyes and said.

Qin Yu drank a mouthful of wine and coldly said, “The people of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association are all trash. Every single one of them.”

As soon as he said this, everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

Who was this person? He actually dared to insult the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in public? Was he crazy?

The expressions of the three people instantly turned cold.

“Kid, do you know what you’re talking about?” Guan Hai said.

Qin Yu coldly said, “What, did I offend you? You’re just trash who forcefully stole someone else’s talent.”

“Are you courting death?!” Guan Shan was furious. He immediately raised his hand and pressed it on Qin Yu’s shoulder!

Qin Yu’s body suddenly shook, and a terrifying qi force instantly erupted!

Qin Yu, who had stepped into the fourth rank Martial Marquis Realm, was several times stronger than before. These three people were actually pushed back!

“You have quite some ability,” Guan Shan said coldly.

“Who exactly are you? Tell me the truth!” Guan Shui said furiously.

Qin Yu coldly swept his gaze over the three of them while releasing an icy internal qi from his body.

In the next second, Qin Yu’s palm shook, and a scarlet longsword fell into Qin Yu’s hand!

“The person who will kill you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu stepped forward while slashing his sword in the air!

The terrifying sword light instantly lit up the dim bar!

“You don’t know your place!” Guan Shan shouted loudly. His hands shook and he clenched his fists to meet the attack head-on!

“Clatter!”

The sword light cut through Guan Shan’s body while leaving a bloody scar of dozens of centimeters. His body was pushed back!

Qin Yu held a scarlet long sword in his hand. His black robe added a bit of mystery to him.

Guan Shan frowned slightly. At this moment, he realized that the black-robed man in front of him wasn’t simple!

“Martial Marquis? There aren’t many Martial Marquises in Jingdu. Who exactly are you?!” Guan Shan said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He responded with another slash!

“Boom!”

This slash was extremely fast. The entire bar was swept flat!

Those who couldn’t dodge in time were cut into two pieces in the air!

The people in the entire bar were instantly flustered. They turned around and ran because they were afraid that they would be affected!

Guan Shan roared loudly. Then, his hands condensed a ray of light and charged forward with a bang!

“Clatter!”

Qin Yu’s bronze sword actually shattered this ray of light! Then, the blade of the sword charged straight toward the three people!

“You’re courting death!”

The three people were instantly enraged and immediately activated their spells!

Countless resplendent rays of light approached Qin Yu, but Qin Yu was completely unafraid. He withstood the spells and slashed out with his sword!

The spells of the three of them landed on Qin Yu’s body, and Qin Yu’s bronze sword chopped off Guan Shan’s head!

“Hiss...”

The remaining two couldn’t help but gasp!

Guan Shan died just like that? The powerhouse of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had his head chopped off with a single slash?

Qin Yu shook the bronze sword and said coldly, “The two of you are next.”

His spiritual power surged into the bronze sword.

This bronze sword was made of the fragments of countless Mighty Realm weapons, and its power was far beyond imagination!

Even the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect had been cut off, let alone these three Martial Marquises!

Qin Yu knew that it wasn’t good to stay here for long, or else he would definitely attract the people of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Therefore, Qin Yu pulled out his sword and lifted it up to perform the Nine Taiqing Slashes!

In an instant, a sword ray that was several feet long seemed to come from the horizon.

Qin Yu held his sword with both hands and ruthlessly slashed down!
