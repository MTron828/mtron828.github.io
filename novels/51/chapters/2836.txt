Chapter 2837: The Life-and-death Game

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Chen Zhisha shook his head. At his cultivation realm, how could a few words change his mind?

“Then are we going to kneel to the Path of Heaven and let the blood of countless humans stain the land of the human race?”

Liu Bai raised his eyebrows.

“So what if it’s the time of the Supreme of Divine Land? It’s what we should do to preserve the flame under the great trend of the Path of Heaven.”

“Bullsh*t!”

Liu Bai rebuked angrily.

A magnificent Spiritual Energy Sword that pierced through the sky and earth had already descended toward Chen Zhisha.

When the Spiritual Energy Sword cut into the Miracle Sea, it seemed to have fallen into a quagmire.

It slowed down by a million times in an instant. The visible Spiritual Energy Sword stopped in front of Chen Zhisha.

“Can you stop the shouts of the human race?”

Liu Bai took a step forward. The Spiritual Energy Sword increased by a thousand times again.

It completely cut apart the Chen Zhisha and the Miracle Sea.

As countless Miracle Qi circulated, Chen Zhisha appeared again.

“Amitabha!”

He put his palms together but he didn’t fight back as if he was waiting for something.

“What a troublesome peak power!”

Liu Bai shook his head.

An evil Saint Level figure slowly appeared in the sky full of Saint Level flames.

Lucifer slowly walked out of the void. The two sides of the world began to separate.

As he walked, half of the Saint-Level world and the other half of the monster world filled with destruction and evil appeared in front of him.

The old Daoist’s expression was grim. In the blink of an eye, he had entered Lucifer’s world.

He would not allow anyone to affect Qin Yu’s advancement.

However, the old Daoist could not help but look worried in the middle of the battle.

It wasn’t just Lucifer. Those who felt this change would probably do everything they could to get rid of Qin Yu.

The current Qin Yu could only be said to be a newborn seedling. He had no chance of winning against these giants at all.

However, Lucifer’s powerful attack made him unable to divert his attention to help Qin Yu escape.

Someone had already arrived in the Eight Desolates Beast Domain.

A destructive eyeball appeared in front of Qin Yu.

As it blinked, a bolt of divine lightning struck down fiercely. In an instant, Qin Yu’s power of creation was forcefully broken.

An extremely terrifying pressure crushed Qin Yu and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

The pressure was so strong that it could even turn the air into stone.

He had just woken up, so he did not even have the chance to escape.

His fingers trembled as he tried to place them on the Soul Suppression Ring.

However, he could not move although he had used his full strength.

As Liu Bai’s body flashed, an afterimage was one step faster than him. It had blocked the space where he had attacked instantly.

Chen Zhisha’s Miracle Sea had already blocked all the spaces he could support.

At this moment, the old Daoist was also fighting with Lucifer with bloodshot eyes.

He was retreating step by step. Suddenly, Lucifer’s two worlds fell into his hands.

This power gathered at his fist and bombarded the old Daoist with angelic flames.

All things returned to the void!

In the old Daoist’s hand, all the mantras converged into one. All the mantras gathered on his sleeve instantly.

Then, he threw it at the fist. The sleeve contained the Power of Qian Kun.

Everything he passed by turned into nothingness.

However, the old Daoist’s wrist moved slightly just as the two powers were about to collide.

The sleeve was like a shooting star, smashing into Shimoji’s body.

Suddenly, the divine lightning stopped. Lucifer’s power of the two worlds also hit the old Daoist.

“Old man!”

Liu Bai roared angrily. The sword intent in his body exploded.

It pushed the Miracle Sea a few thousand meters away.

“Grandpa!”

The little girl was also anxious. She suddenly cried looking at the terrifying injury.

“What the f*ck are you doing, Lucifer!”

Shimoji was also hit hard by this attack. He looked at Lucifer angrily.

At this moment, Qin Yu finally found a gap. His index finger suddenly rested on the Soul Suppression Ring.

He felt a mysterious force pulling his soul and body towards the passage of the Nineteenth Prison immediately.

Suddenly, a pair of hands appeared in the passage.

The fair hands grabbed Qin Yu’s divine soul.

Then, a burst of Saint’s power erupted. Qin Yu’s soul was instantly filled with countless cracks.

A bloody mist that filled the sky exploded on Qin Yu’s body.

At this moment, the Saint’s power had completely sealed the entire space.

“You shouldn’t have taken this Investiture of Gods.”

With a soft sigh, Qin Yu saw a human figure.

Shadowless Divine Hand, Jue Chen! One of the Saints!

Liu Bai’s body trembled violently.

Even if his will was as strong as iron, he was so angry that he couldn’t make a sound.

The flame that they had risked their lives to preserve for the human race was blown out by their kind.

Qin Yu’s consciousness quickly dissipated as he stared at this person.

“Am I going to die here just after I’ve awakened my peak power?”

“I can’t accept this!”

He let out an angry roar.

At this moment, Qin Yu felt his chest had become extremely hot.

In the next moment, a destructive power of sealing gods blasted out from the remnant page.

“How is this possible? You can activate the power of sealing gods!”

Jue Chen’s face was twisted as disbelief flashed across his face.

Jue Chen let out a long howl. The mighty power of Saint Kingdom descended.

Facing the creepy power of the Investiture of Gods, he dare not take it easily.

In an instant, he used his strongest power.

Qin Yu disappeared when the two forces completely canceled each other out.

Jue Chen clenched his fists tightly and finally disappeared with a helpless snort.

Chen Zhisha also shook his head and left.

“Sigh.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The old Daoist sighed.

It was unknown if it was because of helplessness or some other reason.

The human race was in such an apocalypse, but they could not unite. This scene made them feel even more despair.

The position of Saint had already fallen behind the alien races. With a figure like Jue Chen, where would the human race go in the future? This was even more unimaginable to them.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body shattered.

The Dream Qi that filled the sky surged and shuttled back and forth in the Nineteenth Prison, but it still could not offset the injury.

That was the power of a Saint. At this moment, this power was crazily destroying his vitality.

Qin Yu only felt that the dancing butterflies in front of him were becoming more and more hazy. Irresistible sleepiness made him unable to control his eyelids. He wanted to fall asleep.

“Qin Yu, don’t fall asleep. Try to enter the Investiture of Gods’ space! Come on! You can do it! Think about Ruoxue! She’s still suffering in the Heavenly Sin. She’s still waiting for you!”

A soft voice sounded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.
