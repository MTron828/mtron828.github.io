2248 Artifact Refining

Wu Ji’s robe was more of an item that Senior Wu Ji had left for him. It was indeed difficult for Qin Yu to accept that it was damaged just like this.

“What if I add my spiritual fire?”

A ball of purple fire appeared on Qin Yu’s hand.

“It still won’t do. My artifact refining furnace’s temperature is only slightly lower than your purple flame.”

Suo Lin carefully felt the temperature of the flame but shook his head.

“You must go to the nearby Fire Unicorn Continent to repair this magical artifact. There is a volcano there. You can melt this robe using the lava and then mold its artifact soul.”

Suo Lin seemed to be hesitant.

“Master, are you worried about something?”

“That’s a place where master refiners often go. Although it’s usually not offending the master refiners, I must remind you of the incidents of snatching magical artifacts from time to time.

“This robe of yours is considered a supreme treasure. Once you mold its soul, it will definitely attract the attention of many people,” Suo Lin frowned and said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“But there’s no harm in going.”

Qin Yu said with determination.

“Alright. Since you’re confident, I’ll pack up and set off.”

Suo Lin nodded.

“Jue Wu, I’m going to the Fire Unicorn Continent. Do you want to come with me?”

Qin Yu voice-transmitted Jue Wu.

…

However, Jue Wu did not reply for a long time. He shook his head. It seemed that she had been fooling around.

After hesitating a moment, Qin Yu decided to go with Suo Lin.

The two first arrived at the Black Platform Continent and then were teleported to the Fire Unicorn Continent through the teleportation formation of the Black Platform Continent.

As soon as he stepped onto the Fire Unicorn Continent, Qin Yu felt a scorching heat wave surging overwhelmingly.

“The Fire Unicorn Continent is also an ancient continent. Rumor has it that a unicorn divine beast was once born here. Therefore, the temperature of this continent is tremendously high. Moreover, there are countless volcanoes.”

Suo Lin was very familiar with this continent and even greeted a few cultivators along the way.

Qin Yu nodded. Most of the cultivators here should be for artifact refinement. They were basically all in teams, and their expressions were full of vigilance.

“Master Suo Lin, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen you on the Fire Unicorn Continent. Are you here refining artifacts?”

A young man walked up to Suo Lin and said. The others also looked at the two of them with smiles.

“Yes, this young friend wants to refine a Saint Weapon,” Suo Lin said.

“It’s only a Saint Weapon. Yet he’s troubled Master Suo Lin. It seems that this young friend is very generous.”

The young man glanced at Qin Yu.

“We’ll make a move first. This time, our sect is also going to refine a treasure. If there’s a need, we’ll have to trouble Master Suo Lin.”

Seeing no response from Suo Lin, the young man said with a smile.

“Nangong Qi from the Mysterious Dark Sect is not a good person. As far as I know, he has killed and robbed people in this area at least twice.”

Seeing him walk far away, Suo Lin reminded Qin Yu softly.

“He has a strong energy of dead bodies on his body. He should also be cultivating an evil technique. However, he’d better not provoke me, or he’ll regret it.”

Nangong Qi gave him a very uncomfortable feeling.

The two chatted and spent about half a day before they arrived at the volcanoes.

The deeper they went in, the higher the temperature became.

At the center, even Return to Void Stage cultivators could not withstand the terrifying heat.

At this moment, somewhere on the Fire Unicorn Continent.

An old woman suddenly opened her eyes and revealed a furious expression.

“What’s the matter, Master?”

A charming and attractive woman asked.

“I can sense the internal qi of the Soul-hunting Bell. I want to see who dares to kill my Azure Firmament Sect’s people.”

The old woman’s face showed a cold and stern expression, and her appearance was extremely contorted.

Ouyang Tina was her favorite disciple, and she had put in a lot of effort to nurture her. She had even given the Soul-hunting Bell to her team out of fear that she would be in danger, but she had never expected her to encounter a disaster in purgatory.

“Do we want us to capture him?”

The woman bowed and asked.

“No need at the moment. Let’s wait until he leaves the Fire Unicorn Continent. There are too many master refiners here.”

The old woman said fiercely.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already arrived at a position close to the very center, and something caught his attention.

He actually bumped into Nangong Qi and his group again. They stood apart guarding, and someone was refining a magical artifact in the middle.

Seeing Suo Lin and Qin Yu still going deeper in, Nangong Qi’s face revealed a meaningful smile.

“Elder Huan, we need to use a magical artifact deep inside the volcano. What level should it be?”

The artifact-refining elder suddenly opened his eyes and said, “At the very least, it should be a tribulation divine artifact.”

“Forget it. It’s not worth offending Suo Lin for a tribulation divine artifact.”

He shook his head.

At this moment, Suo Lin was ready. He took the enormous furnace out from his spatial ring.

He quietly sat cross-legged, trying to adjust his condition to its best state.

“Qin Yu, let us come out and observe.”

Hearing Wang Feng’s voice, he released Wang Feng, Elder Guai, and the man with the mustache with a thought.

“It’s so hot!”

As soon as Wang Feng came out, he found the heat unbearable.

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and wrapped him with the chaotic qi. Only then was he able to withstand the scorching heat.

“Keep 20 spiritual essences for me. I need to replenish my spirit power when I don’t have enough.”

Suo Lin said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took out 30 spiritual essences and placed them beside Suo Lin.

“Bang!”

Suo Lin suddenly slapped the furnace, revealing a corner of the massive lid.

He took out a Saint Weapon. It was a spoon.

After that, Suo Lin took the spoon and tapped it against the lava. With a wave, a terrifying stream of molten lava was guided into the furnace of the alchemy cauldron.

“Put Wu Ji’s robe and the locust tree wood in.”

Suo Lin shouted.

Qin Yu threw the two magical artifacts in. The boiling lava poured on the magical artifacts made sizzling sounds.

Thick smoke rose from the furnace.

Fifteen minutes later, the locust tree shield slowly melted, but Wu Ji’s robe remained intact.

A bead of sweat the size of a bean rolled down Suo Lin’s face as he used the spoon as a hammer, vigorously pounding on the molten lava.

An even bigger stream of lava fell into the furnace like a waterfall, washing Wu Ji’s robe fiercely.

Countless precious ores were thrown into the furnace and refined into a pool of precious water-like matter.

Half a day had passed, and all the magical artifacts had been completely melted. However, Wu Ji’s robe still showed no signs of melting.

Suo Lin crushed a few spiritual essences, and his face began to turn pale.

Even though he tried to protect the Saint Weapon spoon in his hand with all his might, it started to melt.

“Just what kind of material is this Wu Ji’s robe? Even the lava here can’t melt it.”

Suo Lin panted heavily.

Qin Yu placed a hand on Suo Lin’s back. The chaotic force turned into spiritual power and poured into his body.

“We’re in trouble. The material of this robe is too hard. The temperature is not high enough to refine it.”

The man with the mustache frowned and said.
