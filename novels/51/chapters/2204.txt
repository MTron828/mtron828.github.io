2205 Artifact Refining Formation

“Miss, is there anyone sitting here?”

A young man with a warm smile came to Yun Qingyun’s side and sat down beside her without waiting for her reply.

Yun Qingyun had always been cultivating under the Green Spirit Tree and had an ethereal celestial aura. Coupled with her graceful figure, she attracted numerous fiery gazes from the surroundings.

“This is the largest competition in our Black Platform Continent, and my father is one of the judges. I am Xue Qingzhu.”

The young man smiled faintly and reached out to hold Yun Qingyun’s hand. He glanced at Qin Yu.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s internal qi was suppressed, and he seemed to only be at the Early-stage of the Reversion Void.

“Yun Qingyun.”

Yun Qingyun quickly pulled out her hand and subconsciously rubbed her sleeves.

“B*tch, what are you pretending?”

Xue Qingzhu cursed in his heart and signaled the attendant by the side.

“We want this seat.”

An attendant suddenly stood before Qin Yu and grabbed Qin Yu with one hand, wanting to pull him up.

However, in the next moment, it was as if he was grabbing onto a rock.

“Are you courting death? Making trouble at the venue?”

The attendant sneered and slapped Qin Yu’s head.

“Bang!”

Qin Yu did not even open his eyes. He kicked at the attendant’s dantian directly, and the person flew hundreds of meters away, and his fate remained unknown.

“A puny Reversion Void Stage cultivator isn’t very capable but has quite a temper.”

Xue Qingzhu stood before Yun Qingyun with his hands behind his back.

Yun Qingyun was speechless. He indeed felt so good about himself.

“Get lost!”

Qin Yu did not even lift his eyelids and just said a sentence.

“Brother, why can’t you talk nicely? Do you know that all the security guards here are from my Xue family?”

Xue Qingzhu sneered and said.

He placed his hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder, and a silver needle emitting black mist was sandwiched between his index finger and thumb.

“Touch my people? Die slowly and painfully.”

Xue Qingzhu thought to himself. He did not want to kill people at the venue as it would cause an uproar.

“Crack!”

The moment the silver needle touched Qin Yu’s shoulder, it broke into two.

“I’ve told you to get lost.”

Qin Yu slightly narrowed his eyes and slapped Xue Qingzhu’s face forcefully, instantly turning half of his face into a pig’s head.

“My son!”

An elderly man in the front row heard the commotion behind him and was instantly shocked.

“Take down this madman!”

The elderly man shouted angrily.

Instantly, ten people or so surrounded Qin Yu.

“Kneel!”

One of them stepped forward and kicked Qin Yu’s thigh.

“Slap!”

Qin Yu directly slapped him into a lump of meat paste.

After that, he pinched the four people who had attacked him in thin air.

Instantly, the four exploded into four balls of blood mist in the air.

“You’re courting death!”

The elderly man roared, and a flying sword appeared before him.

Then, like a bolt of lightning, it shot toward Qin Yu’s face.

Qin Yu bent his fingers and flicked the flying sword into pieces the next moment.

“Stop!”

Hei Yun roared. When he saw Qin Yu, his body and spirit trembled. He suddenly rushed over and slapped the elderly man’s face.

“City Lord Hei Yun, what are you doing?”

The old man was stunned.

“You shut up!”

Hei Yun scolded angrily.

“These people have disturbed Senior. Would you like me to take care of them?”

Hei Yun’s head almost touched the ground.

“Just tell them to get lost.”

Qin Yu really could not be bothered with these guys.

“Yes, Sir! Hurry up and get lost!”

Looking at Hei Yun’s eye expression as if he wanted to kill people, the elderly man quickly took his son and left.

Hei Yun was famous in the Black Platform Continent. Otherwise, he would not have become the City Lord of the Black Platform Continent.

If the old man still could not read from his attitude, he must be retarded.

At this moment, the competition continued.

It had already entered the finals. The remaining people were almost all formation masters.

The method of the competition was rather simple. The two masters took out the same objects and carved the formations. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After that, their magical artifacts would clash with each other, and the winner would be the victor.

A middle-aged man with a pale face and a weak internal qi attracted Qin Yu’s attention.

An ordinary saber in his hand seemed to be transforming.

Like a master refiner, he hammered the saber, and each hammering brought a slight change to the saber.

At this moment, he held his breath and used his index finger to quickly carve out one formation after another on the iron sword.

“Stacking Formation?”

Qin Yu was a little shocked.

From the formation information his father had left behind for him, he knew it was a profound method. The stacking of different formations would cause the power to multiply exponentially.

However, this method required the person who set up the formation to have an extremely high level of formation cultivation and a tremendous understanding of different formations.

Otherwise, the formation would explode at any time and backfire on the person.

“Sharp, formidable, and lightning-fast. Incredibly, three different formations are stacked together.”

Qin Yu was somewhat surprised.

“This elderly man should be a rogue cultivator from the Black Platform Continent. His name is Wang Feng, and he has a strange personality. He has always been cultivating formations in his residence and doesn’t participate in anything. He’s here this time probably for the spiritual essence.”

Yun Qingyun often came to the Black Platform Continent and seemed quite familiar with this person.

“Why is this person so down-and-out? His spiritual energy is nearly depleted, and he’s probably on the verge of death at any moment.”

Qin Yu frowned. He noticed the prominent death qi on Wang Feng.

“I’m not sure about that.”

Yun Qingyun stuck out her tongue and said.

Although the formations of the three attributes were easy to separate, it was complicated to stack them together.

The iron saber in Wang Feng’s hand emitted a pale saber light. Wang Feng’s face suddenly turned red as he spat a mouthful of blood essence on the saber.

“Let’s do it together!”

Wang Feng looked at the iron saber with a satisfied smile.

Several master refiners beside him were dissatisfied with Wang Feng’s arrogance.

The three sabers simultaneously cut through the air and crashed toward the iron saber floating in front of Wang Feng.

“Clang!”

The iron saber was motionless, but the three sabers seemed to have crashed into a mountain, and a big crack appeared.

“Break!”

Wang Feng shouted, and the iron saber in front of him trembled slightly.

The iron saber shook violently, making a clear sound of metal vibrating.

“Ding!”

With a crisp sound of metal clashing, the three sabers were cut into halves like paper.

“What bullsh*t formation master is he? He’s just a dying beggar.”

A hearty laugh rang out as a person stepped onto the stage.

The iron sword in his hand let out a sword hum, and a sword light shot out from the formation on the sword’s body. The intense sword light seemed to break through the air at any time.

“This formation is called the Blades of the Ten Directions. It has boundless killing intent, and I hope it won’t accidentally kill a beggar like you later.”

The young man laughed and said as if he was joking.

“Come on.”

Wang Feng was unafraid at all.

With a slash of the sword, Wang Feng’s flying saber emitted a muffled sound under the sword aurora.

The flying saber bent to the extreme, and the sword aurora continuously attacked Wang Feng’s flying saber.

The flying saber retreated step by step, but they were as resilient as the spring bamboo on the green mountains.

“The internal qi of this sword is so strong! Wang Feng’s iron saber probably couldn’t compare to it, right?”

Yun Qingyun exclaimed.
