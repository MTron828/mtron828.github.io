2296 The Person Who Survived Two Path of Heaven

“Moreover, his power of the Path of Heaven clearly should be weaker than Gu Ming’s. He should have comprehended it through comprehending other people’s Dao.”

A person with a powerful internal qi saw some clues and explained them to everyone.

“In other words, this person’s combined abilities have even surpassed the heavenly threshold of fifth grade. Even if he has not experienced the baptism of the power of the Path of Heaven, he is still stronger than Gu Ming. This person’s strength probably would be comparable to the evil exterminator if he breaks through to fifth grade. Everyone should either kill him today or not offend him.”

The cultivator gasped.

There was an immense gap between a fourth-grade and a fifth-grade True Saint. This gap was equivalent to a breakthrough from the Reversion Void Stage to the True Saint.

Qin Yu’s performance was equivalent to killing someone of a higher level which was indeed too shocking.

At this moment, Situ Haoyue suddenly stepped forward and loudly said.

“I told you to stop. Didn’t you hear me?”

“Who do you think you are to tell me to stop?” Qin Yu turned around and stared at Situ Haoyue indifferently.

“You’re so arrogant and naive. Don’t think that you’re invincible just because you defeated Gu Ming. Today, I’ll show you the immense gap between fourth and ninth grade.”

Situ Haoyue’s eyes flashed with killing intent.

“Situ Haoyue is about to make his move. Who do you think will win?”

“It must be Situ Haoyue. Qin Yu, a fourth grade, should have been at his limit to win against Gu Ming. Situ Haoyue is a cultivator who has lived through two lifetimes. If Qin Yu wins again, it’s heaven-defying.”

“That’s right. Situ Haoyue is proficient in two types of Path of Heaven. This Qin Yu just had a great battle. With the collision of the power of rules and the final attack might, he might only have a little spiritual energy left. How is he going to fight Mr. Situ?”

The cultivators who could come here all had sharp gazes. Qin Yu had indeed consumed a lot of chaotic qi.

“Brother, what do you think? What do you think will happen between Qin Yu and Mr. Situ?”

Some people turned to look at the cultivator who had explained to them earlier.

“It’s very difficult for him to win unless he has more trump cards. There’s a huge gap compared with the strength of a ninth-grade True Saint. I’m also a ninth-grade True Saint, but Gu Ming should be able to kill me in an instant. The evil exterminator is also a ninth-grade True Saint, and so is the masked woman. As for Situ Haoyue, he’s considered a very powerful person among the ninth grade.”

He shook his head, not optimistic about Qin Yu’s chance of winning.

The group of people discussed animatedly.

Although Situ Haoyue wanted to encourage everyone to fight Qin Yu together, Qin Yu’s performance made these people somewhat cautious.

“Qin Yu, I must admit that you’re among the top talents I’ve ever encountered. If you’re willing to apologize to me and offer the coffin as a tribute, I can let bygones be bygones.”

Situ Haoyue said softly.

“Noisy. If you’re afraid, get out of the eighth level.”

Qin Yu coldly glanced over and did not give in.

“Sigh, what a pity! Today, I’ll let you see for yourself the immense gap between a fourth-grade and a ninth-grade True Saint!”

Situ Haoyue shook his head.

He slowly walked toward Qin. With each step and each breath, the internal qi on his body was stacked up.

The cultivator who had survived two Path of Heaven exuded a terrifying sense of oppression.

Even Qin Yu felt a great sense of oppression.

“As expected, after he was controlled by the masked woman last time, he should have suffered severe injury. However, it seems that he has recovered now.”

Qin Yu thought to himself. He dared not have the slightest bit of negligence when he unleashed the Sacred Body Technique.

“Bang!”

Situ Haoyue blew lightly, and a fist-sized stone instantly turned into a stream of light and blasted toward Qin Yu.

The terrifying speed even made Qin Yu fail to react in time. The stone directly exploded on his body.

“Slap!”

Situ Haoyue clapped his hands, and sand and stones instantly filled the entire space.

His body seemed to have turned into a black hole, and the stones and sand grains suddenly crashed toward Qin Yu.

Under tremendous speed, even a grain of sand could turn into a top-notch magical artifact.

“What a dense spiritual energy! Who can fight Situ Haoyue with this kind of spiritual energy?”

A cultivator exclaimed.

Throughout the lengthy cultivation, he could gradually accumulate and refine his spiritual energy until it was compressed to its utmost limit.

The process was akin to the transformation of gas into a liquid and then into a solid, a change in quality.

The golden light on Qin Yu’s body shattered, and the Sacred Body Technique was instantly broken.

He was also shocked. He did not know that Situ Haoyue was so ferocious.

The Fire Fist!

Suo Lin’s boxing gloves emitted extreme heat. Qin Yu’s body flashed and appeared before Situ Haoyue, not giving him time to react.

The fists that melted the lava directly smashed toward Situ Haoyue’s head.

“As expected of Master Suo Lin’s masterpiece of his full effort, but it’s wasted in your hands.”

Sensing the Fire Fist’s shocking power, Situ Haoyue punched out.

The spiritual energy gathered in his fist, and the terrifying spiritual energy directly shattered the Fire Fist.

“Nine Dragons!”

Qin Yu dared not conserve his chaotic power anymore and activated Suo Lin’s boxing gloves with all his might, and all the fire energy in the eighth level accumulated in the space.

The nine giant fire dragons surrounded Situ Haoyue, and the extreme heat even evaporated all the air.

Situ Haoyue smiled and pointed at the sky.

In the sea of fire in purgatory, the tremendous power of the star descended, piercing through the sea of fire and landing on Situ Haoyue’s body directly.

His body instantly expanded dozens of times. With a casual stride, he came to the nine fiery dragons.

He then delivered a swift roundhouse kick.

A terrifying power of the star flashed past. The searing brilliance of its light almost made everyone unable to open their eyes.

Even their eyelids could not block that terrifying light. Some cultivators’ eyes directly shattered, and blood flowed out from the depths.

The nine fire dragons exploded into countless fire energy from this kick, and tiny fire sparks filled the entire space.

In that instant just now, Qin Yu sensed an extreme danger.

His body jerked backward abruptly, narrowly dodging that strike. Otherwise, his body might have been severed into halves.

“My domain power, how will you withstand it?”

Situ Haoyue continued walking toward Qin Yu.

Both his hands formed a hand seal at the same time and then gently slid down.

The power of the star suddenly descended, and the terrifying power of the Path of Heaven directly enveloped Qin Yu.

Qin Yu crossed his hands and clenched his fists. The chaotic qi in his body surged crazily.

The power of annihilation surged into his fists, and intense black flames burned to the extreme.

The moment the two powers of rules intersected, the power of annihilation seemed to have been pressed against like a hand on the throat.

Under the gradual suppression, and after a collision lasting several dozen breaths, the vast black flames dwindled to the point of being like a flickering candle on Qin Yu’s fists.

“Fighting word formula!”

Qin Yu clenched his teeth tightly and resisted the terrifying pressure. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In an instant, his strength tripled, and the black fire once again forced out a force of ten feet.

Taking advantage of this gap, Qin Yu spread his hands apart. One hand formed the line word formula, while the other unleashed the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch.

He swiftly moved away from the center of Situ Haoyue’s attack.

“Boom!”

Without Qin Yu’s support, the power of annihilation instantly shattered, and the terrifying power of the star ruthlessly bombarded Qin Yu’s body.
