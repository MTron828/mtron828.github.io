Chapter 2420 The Secret of the Ji Family

In this instant, the Heart of Thunder in Qin Yu’s head erupted with all its energy. Black Qin Yu’s soul was instantly riddled with holes.

“Boom!”

In Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness at this point, the golden Qin Yu had originally disappeared into an alternate dimension.

Accepting the power of the Evil Eye was different from the previous arrangement of having one on the left and the other on the right.

The black Qin Yu’s power had completely crushed Qin Yu and even opened up a space, wanting to suppress the golden Qin Yu’s consciousness there forever.

This kind of space was similar to the acupoints of a crystal body. He can only see what his body is doing but has no control over the body’s power.

When he saw the black Qin Yu about to kill Jue Wu, the golden Qin Yu’s soul finally erupted with energy.

He tore open the acupoints of the soul and returned to the divine sea.

“Get lost!”

The two soul power clashed wildly. With the help of the Heart of Thunder, he suppressed the black Qin Yu in that acupoint.

“Boom!”

Evil Eye’s sword energy directly brushed past Jue Wu’s body, and Qin Yu’s body was covered in cold sweat.

“That was close!”

Qin Yu said to Chang Mang and the others as he placed the unconscious Ji Yuhong into the Sumeru ring.

“Quickly pack up your things. We’ll return to Thunder Courtyard first, and talk about the rest later.”

Qin Yu knew they had a lot of questions, but now was not the time to explain.

Anything that could be left behind here was definitely a supreme treasure.

Ordinary Saint Weapon had long been destroyed in this terrifying battle. The spatial ring or magic treasures left behind were at least above the tribulation.

All the treasures in the Ji family’s mystic realm were absorbed by Qin Yu’s Northern Underworld Demonic Scripture.

With a single hand, Qin Yu grabbed the Five Emperor Coins.

It was the most important treasure of the Ji family, so he definitely could not leave it behind.

The other treasures and spatial storage items were quickly stored in everyone’s hands.

After that, Qin Yu’s Sumeru qi swept up and immediately brought everyone away.

The extermination of the Ji family would shock the Holy Region tremendously.

“Qin Yu, hurry up and tell us what the hell happened. If you don’t tell us, I’ll suffocate to death.”

Chang Mang grabbed Qin Yu’s clothes.

Qin Yu told them what had happened while controlling the Sumeru ring.

The entire Sumeru ring was dead silent. Fighting against a family alone seemed impossible, but it had happened.

“My understanding of the Traceless Immortal Scripture and the Soul Torment Mind Technique is still too shallow and weak. Originally, I could barely release Evil Eye with the Heart of Thunder, but Black Qin Yu was completely unaffected by this Evil Eye. Even the Traceless Immortal Scripture is perfectly compatible with it and has reached the second level of the Northern Underworld Demonic Technique.”

Qin Yu felt like he was living in a dream. Originally, he had gone to the Ji family preparing to die.

He did not expect this outcome.

“The Ji family mainly cultivates the Way of Soul. It’s definitely the number one family that the nine great aristocratic families don’t want to offend the most. Its various methods are unimaginable, especially the Way of Curse, which is even impossible to guard against. To be able to destroy all the bloodlines of a royal family silently, this method can only be said to be terrifying.”

Ji Yue had a lot of information about the nine great aristocratic families, so she told everyone about the situation of the Ji family.

Qin Yu nodded.

Previously, when he went to Sky City, the people of the Ji family could accurately capture his location and even use the power of the curse to attack the people of Demon-slaying Peak directly.

This kind of method was indeed impossible to guard against.

However, their path of cultivation was restrained by the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

The black Qin Yu derived from it absorbed the power of the curse like a great tonic and even devoured the evil power of Evil Eye. If the Ji family had a technique with tremendous killing power similar to the immortal scripture of Immortal Emperor Lei, Qin Yu would have died.

“Sigh, it’s just that I’ve implicated so many vengeful souls. Under the Northern Underworld Demonic Technique, almost no one in the surrounding area can escape.”

Qin Yu felt somewhat frustrated in his heart. He had never tried this before with the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

All the spiritual energy of the living beings within tens of thousands of miles was instantly absorbed. This was the original power of the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

In Wu Ji’s era, perhaps only such a method could have the heaven-defying power to resist the Immortal Emperor at the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

“Hmph, you’ll understand once you finish sorting out the Ji family’s things. Almost all the treasures of the Ji family require countless souls to refine, and Ji Yuyi’s two Saint Weapons of the sorcerer tribe require the power of hatred of young boys and girls to refine day and night to unleash their full power. Do you think the Ji family are good people?”

Ji Yue snorted coldly and spat.

“Power of hatred? What is that?” Chang Mang was puzzled.

“They raise these boys and girls. When they are six years old and have their first awakening of intelligence, they kill their parents in front of them, then refine them into human pigs and let their souls wash over the sorcerer tribe’s Saint Weapons. There were at least tens of thousands of such breeding grounds in the periphery of the Ji family. Countless families of newborn babies were plundered by them. The people in the periphery basically made a living by doing such heartless work for the Ji family. Do you still feel guilty?”

“D*mn these beasts! You did a good job!” Chang Mang cursed.

“Doesn’t anyone in the Holy Region care about such vicious methods?”

Qin Yu also frowned.

“Who cares? The Ji family has no fundamental interests to compete with them. Also, with the strength of the Ji family, who would dare to provoke them? In the previous battles, the Immortal Emperors of the Ji family had terrifying strength, making the human race laugh till the end. With strength, you are righteous. Without strength, you are bullsh*t.”

Ji Yue smiled sadly. The Jee family was not like that.

The family had given up all its strength for the human race, but in the end, the family had been exiled to the banished lands. Even his descendants had almost been wiped out.

“Forget it. Let’s not talk about this. This time, we’ve obtained almost all the things of the Ji family. Let’s see if there’s anything we can use and quickly choose them.”

Qin Yu saw that Ji Yue was a little emotional, so he quickly changed the topic. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Even though Qin Yu had absorbed everything in the treasure vault, there were still many treasures the Ji family had collected over the years among various spatial storage items.

Especially the things in the storage rooms of several Supreme Elders. It made Qin Yu a little dizzy.

“I still have to hurry up and cultivate. I realize that I can’t keep up with your footsteps now. I can’t even see your back.”

For the first time, Chang Mang realized that his strength was weak, and he felt somewhat dejected.

“Hahaha! Why not I stop and wait for you or let you use one hand.”

Qin Yu placed a hand on Chang Mang’s shoulder.

“F*ck you, just you wait! Sooner or later, I will suppress you and kick your butt!”

Chang Mang angrily pushed Qin Yu’s hand away.

Everyone began to cultivate. Qin Yu casually placed the things on the ground, and whoever found it suitable could take it away.

Everyone in the Sumeru ring was Qin Yu’s friend through thick and thin, so he did not care about these things.
