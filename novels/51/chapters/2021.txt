2022 The Sixth Level Fighting Word Formula!

Seeing Elder Ji’s starting move, some people had already seen through his technique.

“It’s the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution,” someone said coldly.

“The Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution? The Si family’s Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution?”

“That’s right. This technique is a peerless divine ability cultivated for numerous years. It’s very famous!”

“The Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution has nine stages, and the power of each stage is far greater than the previous stage. Legend has it that when the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution is unleashed to the extreme, even the thunder in the world will be moved by it and destroy the world without obstacle!”

“I haven’t seen this technique for a long time. Elder Si used it straight away. He seems to want to end this quickly.”

Everyone discussed animatedly, and their eyes filled with anticipation.

Everyone was curious about the Si family’s top-notch technique.

Qin Yu looked solemn, but he was not afraid. It was as if he was also activating some terrifying techniques.

Rays of Golden Light suddenly appeared on Qin Yu’s body. They were incredibly terrifying!

The surrounding internal qi was constantly changing. What was shocking was Qin Yu’s internal qi actually had another surge!

“Ah!”

Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, the golden light on his body suddenly flourished, and his internal qi reached an unprecedented height!

This internal qi shocked everyone. Compared to previously, Qin Yu’s strength had grown by several times!

“What happened? Is Qin Yu breaking through at this time?”

“Impossible! It’s not so easy to break through from the Middle-stage Reversion Void to the Advanced-stage Reversion Void!”

“He’s probably using some kind of mysterious technique.”

As they had guessed, Qin Yu had comprehended the sixth-level fighting word formula!

Under the support of the sixth-level fighting word formula, Qin Yu’s strength instantly soared! He was not weaker than the cultivation realm of the Advanced-stage Reversion Void!

This was the reason that he dared to challenge Elder Si! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Elder Si’s expression turned even gloomier after sensing the terrifying internal qi on Qin Yu’s body.

“I can’t let this kid live. I have to kill him as soon as possible!” Elder Si thought to himself.

If this kid was allowed to grow, he would definitely bring a destructive disaster to the Si family in the future!

Not only did Elder Si have this thought, but also the surrounding onlookers.

Especially Elder Si’s attendants. Looking coldly in Qin Yu’s direction, their eyes revealing extreme killing intent.

Qin Yu’s body emitted the Golden Light. His hair blew wildly in the wind, and his internal qi was terrifying to the extreme!

Even the Endless Killing Formation was not used, it was hard to guess the outcome of this battle!

“Qin Yu’s internal qi… is so terrifying. Is he really at the middle stage of Reversion Void?” Xiao Hai couldn’t help but think to himself.

“This internal qi is something that even I find it difficult to endure…”

Xiao Hai was secretly amazed. He kept his eyes on Qin Yu, afraid that something unexpected would happen.

Qin Yu took a step forward, and the ground instantly shattered!

Looking at Elder Si, he raised his head and shouted, “Come on! Let me know how powerful a Semi-Saint is!”

Elder Si was already furious to the extreme, and the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution in his hand had taken shape!

His eyes flashed with purple lightning, and the internal qi around him instantly condensed into a corporeal form as if he had transformed into the God of Thunder.

Elder Si put his palms together, and the surrounding space seemed to become heavy. Dark clouds covered the sky, thunder rumbled, and lightning flashed.

“Qin Yu, you have pretty good talent. It’s a pity you’ve taken the wrong path. Today is the day you die!” Elder Si shouted and immediately pushed his hands forward!

This was the first stage of the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution. Elder Si pushed with both hands, and a bolt of lightning power condensed into an enormous lightning ball that instantly smashed toward Qin Yu!

The ball of lightning tore through the air, producing deafening booms as it shot through the air incredibly fast.

This was the unique ability comprehended out of the Holy Region that could even mobilize the power of the elements of heaven and earth!

Qin Yu did not dodge or avoid. He roared repeatedly. Golden light continuously condensed on his fists like a golden mountain range standing in front of him.

He gathered all the strength in his body and punched at the enormous ball of lightning.

“Go to hell!” Qin Yu roared and punched out. Golden internal qi permeated the air as if a vajra had descended into the world. It collided fiercely with the ball of lightning.

Boom!

A powerful shockwave exploded between the two of them. Golden light and purple lightning collided violently in the air, instantly forming a dazzling halo.

Everyone watched this earth-shattering confrontation in shock. They could not imagine how terrifying the strength displayed by these two experts was.

The huge ball of lightning collapsed bit by bit under the invincible fist, turning into countless sparks that scattered in all directions.

“Qin Yu could actually withstand it!” someone shouted in shock.

“Is he really at the middle stage of Reversion Void? He actually could withstand the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution. Where did this kid come from?”

“Impossible! It’s impossible! The difference between their cultivation realms is so great! How did he manage to withstand the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution?”

Amidst everyone’s exclamations, Qin Yu took the initiative to step toward Elder Si!

A golden internal qi permeated Qin Yu’s body, and his face was full of battle intent.

These people did not know what the fighting word formula meant. This technique was incredibly mysterious. It was inherited from the ancient Earth and was one of the most mysterious arts under the starry sky!

“Little b*stard…” Elder Si’s face grew even colder, and the killing intent in his heart rose to a higher level.

“Is this your trump card technique? It seems like it’s nothing much,” Qin Yu said coldly.

...

Elder Si narrowed his eyes and sneered, “This’s only the first stage. You’ll surely die at the second stage!”

With that, Elder Si shouted and began to activate the second stage of the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution!

The surrounding air instantly became oppressive. Purple lightning surged crazily around Elder Si. The sky rumbled, and the dark clouds became even more solemn as if they were about to fall at any time!

Terrifying lightning was constantly arising in the dark clouds. The activation of this technique was tremendously similar to heavenly tribulation!

“It’s the second stage of the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution.”

“The power of the second stage far surpasses that of the first stage. Rumor has it that the second stage can truly summon heavenly lightning for its own use.”

“It has been a long time since someone could survive the second stage of the Nine Netherworld Thunder Retribution. Back then, a genius from Zhongzhou who was not inferior to Qin Yu died under this technique.”

“If Qin Yu still doesn’t activate the Endless Killing Formation, I’m afraid there won’t be any more chance!”

The discussions among the crowd did not change Qin Yu’s determination. He clenched his fists, and golden energy surged. This technique was the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch!

With the support of the sixth level of the fighting word formula, the power of the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch was even more terrifying to the extreme. Just the residual power that surged made people feel like prostrating themselves in worship.

The void was shattering, and the earth was collapsing. Just the burst of these two forces had caused the surrounding void not able to withstand it!
