Chapter 1042: Chapter 1,042, blocking the way! 

Zhai Xing saw through Qin Yu’s intentions at a glance.

Qin Yu was not in a hurry. He smiled and said, “That’s right. I do hope that you will leave the second secret realm. It would be better if you can help me.”

“I said, don’t even think about it!”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“I will either die in battle or kill you.”

Qin Yu pulled up a chair and sat down. He said indifferently, “I’m afraid it’s impossible for you to kill me unless you truly activate the Soul Bell.”

“But it’s a pity that you can’t make up your mind. Otherwise, what’s the difference between you and the Sky Blood Rainbow?”

Zhai Xing’s expression changed. He hurriedly looked at his pocket as if he was looking for a spatial artifact.

“Don’t worry, the Soul Bell is still with you,”Qin Yu said.

“I’m not interested in those spiritual artifacts that rely on others to sacrifice.”

Zhai Xing’s expression darkened and he said coldly, “Either kill me or let me go.”

“You can go, but you have to recover first,”Qin Yu said.

“No need! Stop pretending. If you have the time, you might as well think about how to deal with the Soul Bell!”

After saying this, Zhai Xing turned around and was about to leave.

A few martial saints outside the door quickly moved forward and blocked Zhai Xing’s way.

“What?”Zhai Xing turned around and glanced at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu spread out his hands and said, “Now that everyone knows that I’ve captured you alive, Will Gu Zi really believe you if you go back now?”

“Cut the crap! Don’t even think about sowing discord!”Zhai Xing said coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Are you really going to leave?”

“What do you think?”Zhai Xing said with a sullen face.

Qin Yu stood up and walked to Zhai Xing.

“I don’t know what benefits the GU family has given you to make you so willing to help the wicked,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Don’t you know how many people the GU family has harmed? Even the Warriors of the second mystic realm will be persecuted!”

“Their ideals are completely different from yours. Therefore, deep down, you also hope that someone can replace them, right?”

“It is precisely because of this reason that you have let go of Jiang he, who has a high chance of defeating the second mystic realm, and me later! Don’t you admit it?”

Zhai Xing’s expression changed greatly. He said somewhat angrily, “You’re talking nonsense! When have I ever let you go!”

“When? When I went to look for Jiang he, you pretended not to see me. Later on, you had many opportunities to kill me, but you didn’t do anything!”

“And this time, if you used the soul bell directly, I would at least be seriously injured! But you gave up again!”Qin Yu said word by word.

Zhai Xing’s expression was ugly. He didn’t know how to reply.

Qin Yu continued, “You want to be loyal to the second secret realm, but you also want them to disappear. Who doesn’t know the choice?”

“Loyalty is a dilemma. Loyalty like yours is considered stupid loyalty.”

Zhai Xing said angrily, “So what! It’s not up to a junior like you to educate me!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Of course I don’t have the right to educate you. I just hope you can make the right choice,”Qin Yu said.

“If you are willing to leave the second secret realm now, I can promise you that I will spare Gu Zizhen’s life.”

Zhai xing sneered, “You’d better kill me. I will never betray the second secret realm.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said coldly, “Well, in that case, I won’t say anything more. You can go.”

Zhai Xing snorted coldly. He pushed the two people in front of him away and turned around to leave.

Looking at his departing figure, Qin Yu couldn’t quite figure it out.

Why was Zhai Xing so loyal to Gu Zizhen? What kind of bewitching potion did gu Zizhen give him.

Qin Yu sighed slightly.

It was probably not that simple to make Zhai Xing betray him.

...

Zhai Xing left the Heaven Gate and rushed toward the martial arts association in Jingdu.

But just as he was about to arrive in jingdu, the scene in front of him suddenly began to change.

The surrounding scenery completely disappeared, and in its place was darkness.

In this darkness, two people slowly walked out.

“Who are you?”Zhai Xing said coldly.

“TSK TSK, I didn’t think that Qin Yu would actually let you go. Our trip wasn’t in vain.”The two people walked forward and said indifferently.

Zhai Xing looked at the two people and said calmly, “Who exactly are you? Did Qin Yu send you?”

“Qin Yu?”The two of them looked at each other and then sneered, “Fine, I’ll let you die with a clear death.”

After saying that, they took out a token from their waist.

There were three big words written on the token: Hong Yi sect!

“Hong Yi Sect?”Zhai Xing couldn’t help but squint his eyes.

“You bunch of bugs, you haven’t been exterminated yet?”

“Bugs?”The other party wasn’t angry. He just sneered and said, “What difference is there in the essence of what your Jingdu’s martial arts association does? You carry the flag of justice and do despicable things. You’re not even as good as us.”

Zhai xing sneered and said, “Cut the crap. What do you want to Do?”

“Nothing much. I just heard that you have a magic tool on you. It’s called the Soul Bell,”the other party said with a faint smile.

“We’re very interested in this magic tool. If you’re willing to hand it over, we can let you go.”

Zhai Xing said with a cold face, “Just the two of you?”

“Hahahaha! If you were in your peak condition, we naturally wouldn’t dare to attack you. It’s a pity that you are now heavily injured and can’t display 10% of your peak strength,”the two of them said with a gloomy tone.

“So... you’d better hand over the soul bell obediently!”
