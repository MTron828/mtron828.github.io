Chapter 1340: Chapter 1,340, the Dangerous Wen da! 1 

In the space, people kept walking out.

One, two, three... There were close to a hundred people in total!

They surrounded Qin Yu so tightly that there was no way for them to escape!

Wen Da and Wen Er’s expressions instantly became extremely unsightly. He looked anxiously at Qin Yu, he said, “Damn it, Qin Yu, we didn’t bring this here. We don’t know where these Yin Bi are hiding. We didn’t see them at all!”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Of course, I know it wasn’t you guys. It was my thoughtlessness...”

This was probably what the city lord of Gu City had done. A person who could control a city was naturally quite scheming.

The leader was a mighty figure. His strength had actually reached a terrifying late-stage mighty figure!

This was probably the strongest expert Qin Yu had ever met!

“Sending so many powerful people to capture me... you really think highly of me,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Since you were able to kill Ling Yun, you naturally have some ability. If you don’t send more people, how can I subdue you?”The leader said coldly.

He led the group forward and looked coldly at Qin Yu. “Are we going to take you away, or are you going to follow us back?”

Qin Yu curled his right fist and sneered. “Even if you take me back, I’m afraid you’ll have to pay a price.”

As he spoke, Qin Yu directly activated the fifth level of the battle word technique, preparing to fight to the death.

“HMPH, you’re so stubborn.”This late-stage mighty figure walked toward Qin Yu.

At this moment, Wen da suddenly rushed out.

He blocked in front of Qin Yu and angrily shouted, “F * CK, hurry up and get lost. Otherwise, I’ll Call My Grandfather to beat you to death!”

That late-stage mighty figure glanced at Big Wen and coldly said, “Big Wen, no one can stop today’s matter. I advise you not to bring trouble upon yourself.”

Big Wen gritted his teeth and said, “Then try to kill me!”

This almighty coldly snorted and slightly frowned.

Before he set off, the city Lord had told him that no matter what, he could not hurt Big Wen er, so he did not dare to make a move against these two people.

Big Wen er also stood out at this moment. They stood in front of Qin Yu and did not allow anyone to come any closer.

“Men!”At this time, that Almighty spoke.

“Drag these two brothers of the Wen family to the side.”

“Yes!”

A few people quickly stepped out and walked towards Wen Er. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You F * cking Dare!”The two brothers instantly became anxious.

But this time, they had made up their minds to bring Qin Yu back. Thus, the words of the two brothers didn’t stop them from taking even half a step.

“Forget it. You guys don’t need to care about this matter.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly spoke.

He dragged Wen Da and Wen er behind him and coldly said, “Let me handle this myself.”

“Qin Yu, you...”Wen Da’s expression was extremely ugly.

This group of people was indirectly brought here by them. He couldn’t help but feel a little ashamed.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “It’s fine. This is my life. Moreover, I might not die.”

“This is for the best. It saves a lot of trouble.”That almighty expert also coldly said.

Qin Yu clenched his right fist, which was shining with light.

“Let me see just how powerful you are at the later stage of the mighty existence realm!”

After Qin Yu shouted, he directly charged forward!

“You don’t know life from death.”The late stage of the mighty existence coldly snorted. He raised his palm and suddenly pressed down on Qin Yu!

In an instant, the ground collapsed, and a terrifying power directly pressed down on Qin Yu!

“Die!”Qin Yu roared repeatedly, not showing the slightest bit of fear.

The moves of the two collided violently at this moment, and a terrifying explosion swept out!

But what was shocking was that the late-stage mighty figure’s technique was actually shattered by Qin Yu’s punch!

What was even more shocking was that Qin Yu’s right fist wasn’t damaged at all!

The degree of toughness of this body had probably already exceeded the limits of a mighty figure!

The expression of the late-stage almighty didn’t look too good either. He didn’t expect Qin Yu to have such abilities.

“As expected of the person who killed Ling Yun. He’s quite capable,”the late-stage almighty said coldly.

Qin Yu was also somewhat apprehensive.

The combat abilities of a late-stage almighty and a mid-stage almighty couldn’t be compared.

Even though he had the fifth level of the fighting formula, it was still extremely taxing.

“Come and try again.”That late-stage mighty figure slowly raised his hand, and an endless aura condensed over.

This aura formed a small vortex in his palm, and the vast and mighty energy crazily revolved.

Even Qin Yu felt a hint of fear.

“Come, let me see how many more times you can last,”that mighty figure said coldly.

Qin Yu clenched his fist tightly, adjusting his aura to the extreme.

His fist shone with an extreme radiance. At this moment, it was like a small sun.

“Come!”Qin Yu gritted his teeth, preparing to take this move.

“Boom!”

That Almighty didn’t say anything else and struck out with his palm towards Qin Yu!

Endless energy erupted in an instant, pressing directly towards Qin Yu’s body!

At this moment, a figure suddenly flashed past and blocked in front of Qin Yu.

Looking down, it was actually Wen da!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to push Wen da away, but it was already too late!
