Chapter 1180: Chapter 1,180, Holy Might 

Looking at the broken longsword in his hand, Lu Yun’s face turned extremely ugly!

“How... How is this possible! You... did you hide your strength?”Lu Yun was terrified.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and ignored Lu Yun. Instead, he looked at Lu Guan who was standing on the training ground.

At this moment, Lu Guan climbed up from the training ground. His body emitted rays of light.

The rays of light interweaved on his body like a layer of armor.

This was clearly some protective dharma artifact. However, even with the Protective Dharma artifact, Lu Guan still appeared to be struggling.

Even when he was standing, his body could not help but bend downwards.

“Kid, I’m going to kill you!”Lu Guan roared angrily.

“If you have the ability, then come over. We’ll fight in the training ground!”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered, “Really?”

Lu Guan said with a cruel face, “Do you think I’m joking with you? Why, are you afraid?”

“Well, then I can only be respectful and accept your orders.”With that, Qin Yu walked step by step towards the training hall.

“I’ve fallen into a Trap!”

Seeing this scene, Lu Guan was instantly overjoyed!

The training hall was filled with powerful holy might. Even if he relied on the Protective Dharma artifact given by the Elder, it would still be difficult for him to support his body!

If Qin Yu stepped into this training hall, he would probably be crushed into meat paste in an instant!

“Kid, you will pay for your arrogance!”Lu Guan sneered repeatedly in his heart.

Very soon, Qin Yu arrived at the edge of the training hall.

“Come up, come up!”Lu Guan roared crazily in his heart.

He stared at Qin Yu with cold sweat on his forehead.

Under his gaze, Qin Yu jumped onto the training hall.

The scene of his body being crushed did not appear in his mind. On the contrary, Qin Yu looked quite relaxed.

“How... how is this possible!”Lu Guan’s expression changed drastically!

Even though the holy power in the training hall was far inferior to that of a real ancient saint, it was still not something a martial saint could resist!

“Mm, I’m afraid that ordinary people would not be able to withstand the pressure here.”Qin Yu spread out his palm and said to himself.

The veins on Lu Guan’s forehead twitched violently, and a trace of terror flashed through his heart!

Just what was the background of this brat in front of him? How could he be so terrifying?

“Haha, Qin Yu, Wait for me!”

Right at this moment, Chang Mang also shouted loudly and walked quickly towards the training hall.

When Lu Guan saw this, the corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer once again.

“It’s good to kill this strong man. At least it can save some face. I don’t believe... how is this possible!”

Before Lu Guan could finish his words, his eyes widened!

This Chang Mang had also jumped onto the training hall and was similarly unharmed!

“HM? There seems to be some pressure on the field, but it’s not a big problem,”Chang Mang muttered.

“Indeed. After all, this is not the true power of the ancient sages. It’s just a training hall.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Hearing their conversation, Lu Guan wanted to die!

Were these Aboriginals all perverts? !

“Don’t follow us. Wait for us here. With your physical bodies, you can’t withstand this pressure,”qin yu said to the disciples.

After saying this, Qin Yu looked at Lu Guan.

“Aren’t you going to fight me to the death? I’m coming up. Let’s do it.”Qin Yu walked towards Lu Guan Step by step.

Cold Sweat dripped down Lu Guan’s forehead as he complained bitterly in his heart.

At this moment, he was in a dilemma. He didn’t even know how to respond.

“Forget it. After all, this is the ancient Sage’s training hall. If we fight here, it would be disrespectful to the ancient sage,”Chang Mang said.

“That makes sense.”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

Lu Guan heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. He opened his mouth to say something to save his face, but when he met Qin Yu’s gaze, he felt as if a fishbone was stuck in his throat. He could not say a single word.

“Hurry up and take us to the ancient Sage’s treasure,”Qin Yu said as he glanced at Lu Guan.

Only then did Lu Guan come back to his senses. He patted his chest and felt a lingering fear in his heart.

Was this ancient star really a place where geniuses came from, as the elder had said?

Soon, Lu Yun followed him.

She also had a protective magic artifact on her body that could resist this pressure.

Qin Yu sniffed and said in a low voice, “The dark energy here is too thick. The spiritual power in my body seems to be suppressed.”

“Yes, it is.”Chang Mang nodded.

“But... this is a place of cultivation for me,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

Then, Qin Yu’s eyes fell on Lu Guan and Lu Yun.

“Since you can excavate the tomb of the ancient sage, you must know how to find the treasure, right?”Qin Yu asked.

Lu Guan didn’t say anything, but Lu Yun said indifferently, “Of course, but what about after you find it? How should we distribute it?”

Qin Yu and Chang Mang looked at each other and then said with a smile, “What? Do you think the two of you are qualified to negotiate?”

“Why not?”Lu Yun snorted. “If we can’t get anything, why would we risk our lives to find this so-called ancient sage treasure?”

“Because it can save your lives,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Then kill us. I’d rather die than be humiliated,”Lu Yun said coldly.

Qin Yu smiled. He glanced at Lu Guan, who was shivering, and said, “You have a backbone, but it’s hard to say about your junior brother.”

Lu Yun frowned slightly, and she hurriedly gave Lu Guan a look.

Lu Guan braced himself and said, “Me... Me Too! Either we split it equally, or you kill me!”

Qin Yu could not help but laugh coldly.

“Do you really think that I have to rely on you?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. With a thought, his glabella lit up. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The desolate God’s eye shot out a ray of light from his glabella!
