Chapter 1214: Chapter 1214: Injection of strengthening agent 

Although Qin Yu was a little curious about the strengthening agent that could improve one’s physical body, he was not surprised.

There was a record in the library of the martial arts association in Jingdu that many large cultivation families would soak their bodies in some heavenly and earthly treasures, Beast Blood, and other things, or even inject them into their bodies, in order to increase the potential of their descendants.

Another example was when the martial arts association in Jingdu absorbed Yan Ruoxue’s blood. It was actually the same reason, but everyone called it different.

However, for Qin Yu, this was indeed an opportunity.

Right now, Qin Yu’s spiritual energy was depleted, and he was unable to cultivate. The only way to increase his strength was to increase his body.

It would take four whole days and four nights to go to the laboratory. A desperate man like Qin Yu would definitely not waste a single second.

He closed his eyes slightly, intending to complete the remaining few revolutions of the Nine Transformation Golden Pill.

Last time, he had already reached the fifth revolution, but the fifth revolution had been interrupted by Qin Yu.

Now that he was circulating it again, he could only start from the sixth revolution.

The nine transformation golden pill shone in Qin Yu’s body and reconstructed his body through his meridians.

His body emitted crackling sounds like fried beans.

This sound naturally attracted a lot of people.

Almost all of the eighteen people ran over to watch.

Looking at Qin Yu’s body being continuously broken and then reassembled, they felt a chill on their backs and fear in their hearts.

“What kind of cultivation method is this? It looks so terrifying.”

“The process of the physical body being destroyed must be very painful...”

“Cultivation is really a cruel thing. No wonder Mr. Qin could have such achievements today.”

“First bitter, then Sweet.”

For a time, these eighteen people were all affected by Qin Yu’s actions.

In four days, Qin Yu’s physical body had been reconstructed three hundred times.

However, the improvement brought by these three hundred times was not as exaggerated as before.

It could only be said that the current physical body was already strong enough, and there was already a limit to how much it could improve.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground. He gently clenched his fist, and there was still an extremely dense power in his body.

The only thing that made Qin Yu feel regretful was that he was unable to find a test standard.

Ordinary spells could not harm Qin Yu at all. Even a mighty figure who burned his blood essence could only leave a wound in Qin Yu’s body.

“Those few mighty figures should be at the early-stage of the mighty figure realm.”Qin Yu thought of the mighty figure who burned his blood essence.

Speaking of which, he was looking forward to the fellow in He Teng’s body.

Although that fellow was also at the mighty figure realm, he was much stronger than that reclusive mighty figure.

The last time he saw him, Qin Yu could sense the extraordinary internal Qi in his body.

Just the Polycoria alone could be seen.

Since ancient times, those who had polycoria were all heaven’s favorites.

Soon, the ship docked near the island.

Qin Yu led everyone down from the island.

Ever since Jiang Yi got his upgrade, professor chicken had been very enthusiastic about the visitors because he wanted to find a balance point to improve his physical body.

Therefore, Qin Yu led everyone into the laboratory smoothly.

Professor Chicken saw Qin Yu and the others and immediately walked forward and said, “Are you also here to experience the strengthening agent?”

Qin Yu bowed and said, “That’s right.”

Professor chicken nodded slightly and repeated the things that he had to pay attention to.

After receiving the confirmation from everyone, professor chicken said, “Follow me.”

Nineteen people followed behind Professor Chicken and came to the laboratory.

“I’m warning you guys. Other than that pervert not long ago, no one else can withstand this strengthening agent,”professor chicken reminded them again.

“Pervert? What do you mean?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Professor Chicken waved his hand and said, “You don’t have to worry about that. Who Wants to go first?”

“I’ll go first!”

“I’ll go first!”

“Let me do it!”

These eighteen people were all carefully selected elites by ye Qing. They had an extremely strong spirit of dedication, and they were not afraid of danger.

However, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’ll go first. If anything happens to me, all of you will leave immediately.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“That won’t do. Commander ye said that you must make sure that there are no problems before you can take the injection,”someone at the side said.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. This ye Qing really valued him.

“The general is outside, so the emperor’s orders are not to be taken. Alright, all of you listen to me,”Qin Yu said.

Seeing that Qin Yu insisted, they could not say anything more and could only retreat to the side.

Qin Yu lay on the bed and said, “Don’t stop until I tell you to stop.”

Professor Chicken, who was at the side, said with some surprise, “Your words... are almost exactly the same as what that pervert said a few days ago...”

“Which pervert?”Qin Yu was even more curious.

Professor Chicken waved his hand and said, “If there is a problem, you are responsible for it.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Come on.”

Professor Chicken didn’t say any more nonsense. He picked up the strengthening agent and began to inject Qin Yu.

After one bottle, Qin Yu’s body was instantly strengthened.

This kind of strengthening process shocked even Qin Yu!

“This strengthening agent... is not inferior to the nine transformation golden pill...”Qin Yu could not help but turn pale with fright.

Seeing Qin Yu’s expression, professor chicken thought that Qin Yu could not bear it, so he said, “Come down, to be able to bear one bottle is already very good.”

Qin Yu glanced at him, shook his head and said, “Continue.”

Professor chicken frowned, but in the end, he did not say anything and continued to inject Qin Yu.

One bottle, two bottles, three bottles...

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already injected eight bottles of strengthening agent!

And his physical body had been greatly strengthened!

His body, which was originally incomparably tough, had become as tough as steel. His strength was even more powerful and unfathomable!

“Do... Do you still want to continue?”Professor Chicken turned pale with fright and broke out in cold sweat.

Qin Yu glanced at him and repeated, “Don’t stop until I say so.”

Professor Chicken said with some excitement, “You are the person who has received the most strengthening agents so far!”

Then, he did not say any more nonsense and continued to inject strengthening agents into Qin Yu.
