Chapter 2403 Take Me Away

“You truly have guts. You indeed turned a blind eye to the name of the nine great aristocratic families.”

Behind him, seven or eight people followed him in. One of the Yao family’s elders instantly recognized Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you killed my Yao family’s Holy Son. No one can protect you.”

His expression revealed terrifying killing intent.

“Noisy!”

With a touch of the green light, the pupils of the Yao family’s elder lost their demeanor.

Qin Yu’s green sword had already destroyed his soul.

The old man did not seem to notice it at all. He covered his nose and said.

“Where does that strange smell come from? How disgusting!”

“Elder Ni Yun, this is the prince of the Great Xia Royal Family. The one that his descendant has already been sent to the Ni family.”

A cultivator from the Ni family said softly from behind. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Since the descendant was already born, why wasn’t he killed? Are you keeping him to disgust people?”

Si Yun frowned deeply and retreated to the door.

“Supreme Elder, he is somehow from the royal family. Let’s see if we can interrogate him to find out any secrets of the Great Xia Royal Family.”

The Ni family cultivator said softly.

“What treasures can that trash of the Great Xia Royal Family have? In my eyes, he’s nothing more than a pig or a dog. I would have killed him if it weren’t for the fact that he can communicate with the Path of Heaven. The brat with the surname Qin, come out to die.”

Ni Yun said impatiently.

“He’s a prince of the Great Xia Royal Family. Even if he’s just an ordinary person, don’t you think using such methods is filthy?”

Qin Yu asked calmly. This was practically treating him like a beast.

He dared not imagine what Chang Mang and the others had experienced in the Skywater Prison of the Si family.

“These people are like pigs and dogs in my eyes. When my Ni family was killed by the demons, no one came out to raise flags and shout. This is the path of cultivation. Alright, that’s all for the class. You can come out and face your death now.”

“Your Highness, watch how these people die.”

Qin Yu said softly.

“Make your move, or you won’t have a chance anymore.”

“Well! Well! I’ve seen arrogant people before, but I’ve never seen a fourth-grade True Saint to be so arrogant.”

Ni Yun laughed loudly, but his expression suddenly froze.

The entire sky and earth suddenly changed. The clear and cloudless sky suddenly turned into night.

A giant full moon hung in the sky as if it could be picked at any time.

The power of the bright moon shone down from the sky, and the moonlight spread layer after layer like multicolored clouds.

Every ray of moonlight carried a tremendous force that covered Qin Yu’s body.

It was the rules of heaven and earth with a thought.

Qin Yu had only seen such a cultivation realm once, and that was when he faced Xing Xiu in Black Platform City.

It was the Tribulation Transcending Stage of the previous Path of Heaven, completely different from Yan Tianshi and Si Liuhe.

“Whoosh!”

Ni Yun revealed a smile in this vast space.

With a thought, he arrived at the moonlight behind Qin Yu and punched Qin Yu’s back with a vast amount of star power.

It was too fast. Under the domain of the rules of heavens and earth, he could reach the place where the moonlight shone with a thought. There was simply no way to hide.

Qin Yu said coldly as he struck out with his palm.

“Old fart from the previous year of the Path of Heaven, you haven’t even condensed the Soul Statue yet. You’ve only reached the Tribulation First Level and you’re so arrogant?”

Qin Yu said indifferently.

This force was slightly stronger than Yan Tianshi holding a celestial artifact in his hand. However, it could not pose a threat to Qin Yu at all.

“Alright, you’re indeed an arrogant brat. I won’t kill you immediately. I will turn you into a human-pig and slowly use some tricks on you. I’ve stayed in the ninth level of purgatory for long and have plenty of tricks to make you regret.”

Ni Yun revealed a strange smile.

At that very high point, his fist overlapped with the moonlight in the domain.

At this moment, the moonlight seemed to brighten slightly.

The terrifying power of the stars was drawn down in an instant, and a boom sounded.

The entire ground actually sank slightly, and the cultivators of the Peak of True Saint over there actually could not withstand the majestic power of the moon and their calves directly exploded into bloody mist.

“This attack is a tribulation technique in the Ni family’s immortal scriptures. It’s called the Moonlight Strike.”

Ni Yun said coldly. In the next instant, he appeared in front of Qin Yu.

The punch that was condensed with the terrifying power of the bright moon directly smashed into Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu stretched out his palm and held his wrist with her other hand.

In the blink of an eye, the vast amount of chaotic qi in his body instantly surged into his palm.

A vortex suddenly formed in his palm, and then a rune surged.

The runes were blurry and even a little crooked.

However, the moment it appeared, it absorbed all the power of the bright moon. After that, the primordial rune landed on Ni Yun’s body, and his face revealed an extremely shocked expression.

After a short moment of loss, he burst out with a violent energy, wanting to escape.

The primordial rune exploded on his body, and the spatial power flowed through his body.

Wherever it passed, his flesh and bones turned into powder. In the blink of an eye, the battle situation changed. Before the people of the nine great super aristocratic families could see what had happened, they saw Ni Yun lying on the ground like a dead dog. No one knew if he was dead or alive.

“Great stuff! It’s Black Tortoise’s soft armor. It’s a top-rated protective artifact during the tribulation. No wonder it could save your life.”

Qin Yu said with a cold smile. He raised Ni Yun.

“Qin Yu, what are you trying to do? This is the Ni family’s Supreme Elder, and he has been defending purgatory against the monster race, making great contributions to the human race. Are you going against the human race and being the enemy of the nine great aristocratic families? Let me tell you, all the Supreme Elders of the Ni family have already arrived in purgatory…”

“Boom!”

Before he could finish speaking, his head was kicked away like a football by Jue Wu, who descended from the sky.

Chang Mang landed with a sinister smile, and Si Wankong’s head was still in his hand.

“Grandpa is here. I didn’t hear what you said just now.”

“Leave no one alive.”

Qin Yu said calmly as he grabbed Ni Yun and entered the house.

“Where is the prince’s descendant?”

Qin Yu asked indifferently.

“Of course, he’s in a secret place, but he’ll be alive. After all, we still have to use him to create spiritual stones.”

Ni Yun laughed crazily as if he wasn’t afraid at all.

A wisp of soul-torment qi entered Ni Yun’s sea of consciousness. After entering the sea of consciousness, that wisp of qi turned into a ferocious ghost, biting Ni Yun’s soul crazily.

“Ah!”

Ni Yun’s face contorted, and his body instantly rolled on the ground.

Blood spurted out again from the festering wound under this movement.

Qin Yu stared coldly at Ni Yun. The Soul Torment Mind Technique had many ways to torture people and was more effective than anything else. The human body was connected to the soul, and the soul was the first medium to experience pain.

The punishment targeting the soul was the most terrifying.
