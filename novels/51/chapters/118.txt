Chapter 119: The Distraught Liu Shihui! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Everyone looked at Liu Shihui with astonished expressions, while Liu Shihui’s face was full of madness!

“I really didn’t expect that you could actually force me to this extent!” Liu Shihui clenched his teeth and said.

“I don’t care what you have experienced in the past three days, but with this move, you will definitely die!” Liu Shihui raised his head and laughed loudly.

Qin Yu looked at the knife in Liu Shihui’s hand and was a little surprised.

He asked in surprise, “What is this thing?”

Liu Shihui sneered. “This is called Inner Strength release! I condensed my Inner Strength into the palm of my hand and turned it into the shape of a knife to use as my weapon!”

“It’s very rare to be able to do this at the level of an Inner Strength Master Hands! This is condensed from pure Inner Strength, and its power is beyond your imagination!”

Hearing Liu Shihui’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but come to a realization.

“Condensing Inner Strength in the palm of your hand? So that’s a thing...” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

Liu Shihui sneered. “I know it’s hard for you to understand, but it’s okay. For a nobody like you, this is indeed beyond your imagination. After all...”

Before Liu Shihui could finish his words, his expression suddenly changed!

It was because in Qin Yu’s hand, a jade-green broadsword actually condensed!

This broadsword flickered with light, and was several times bigger than the knife in Liu Shihui’s hand!

“Is that so?” Qin Yu shook the broadsword in his hand and muttered.

“This... how the f * ck is this possible?!” Liu Shihui was filled with frustration!

He had been learning this move for several years before he successfully comprehended it. He didn’t expect Qin Yu to condense a broadsword that was far better than him in the blink of an eye!

What kind of freak was Qin Yu?!

The mouths of the audience on the spectator stand were agape! They couldn’t believe that such a freak had been in Jiangcheng all this time!

“This is quite simple,” Qin Yu muttered.

“But speaking of which, I really have to thank you, Liu Shihui. If you didn’t remind me, I really wouldn’t know that spiritual power could be used in this way.” Qin Yu looked at Liu Shihui and sneered.

“Mr. Qin... is indeed a genius...” Below the stage, Yao Qing couldn’t help but swallow hard.

Wei Ming also had a solemn expression. He shook his head and said in a low voice, “As someone highly regarded by the Yan family, he indeed isn’t that simple.”

Liu Shihui said angrily, “Impossible, this is absolutely fake, absolutely fake!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Whether it’s real or fake, you’ll know after you try it.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked towards Liu Shihui step by step.

Liu Shihui was filled with mixed feelings.

Anger, unwillingness, and doubt interweaved with each other and he was on the verge of a mental breakdown.

“Impossible, Qin Yu, this is fake!” Liu Shihui seemed to have gone mad as he rushed towards Qin Yu!

He waved the small knife in his hand and fiercely stabbed it towards Qin Yu!

However, in front of Qin Yu’s big spiritual knife, this knife was pitifully small.

Qin Yu only waved his hand lightly, and Liu Shihui’s body was sent flying before fiercely slamming into the wall!

“Phew!”

A mouthful of blood was spat out from his mouth, and the Inner Strength knife in his hand also disappeared!

“How can there be such a person in the world...” Liu Shihui’s eyes were widened. He really wanted to stand up, but he couldn’t!

“Young Master Liu... actually lost...” The astonished onlookers murmured in a low voice of disbelief!

“Sun Ying, your brother-in-law is so powerful, yet you say he’s a gigolo. You’re lying!” Chen Xin also shook Sun Ying’s arm excitedly.

Sun Ying didn’t know what to say. The Qin Yu today wasn’t the same person as the Qin Yu in her memory!

Qin Yu walked towards Liu Shihui step by step.

He looked at the struggling Liu Shihui, and there was no pity in his heart at all.

Those who bullied others would eventually get payback.

Moreover, currently, Qin Yu was no longer the wishy-washy and indecisive Qin Yu.

“Liu Shihui, you lost,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Liu Shihui gritted his teeth and said angrily, “Qin Yu, you deserve to die...”

Qin Yu said coldly, “According to the agreement, you should kneel down and apologize to my friend.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked in the direction of Yao Qing and shouted, “Yao Qing!”

Yao Qing walked in front of Qin Yu with some embarrassment and said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, why don’t we forget about it...”

“Forget about it?” Anger flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

“What? Are you afraid of people with a higher status than you? If that’s the case, don’t stay by my side. I don’t need people who bully the weak and fear the strong!” Qin Yu shouted!

Yao Qing’s expression immediately turned ugly.

He gritted his teeth and bowed. “Mr. Qin, I was wrong.”

Liu Shihui struggled to get up from the ground. He grinned and said, “He’s just a lap dog. How dare he ask me to apologize... ask him if he deserves it!”

“Slap!”

Just as Liu Shihui finished speaking, Qin Yu directly slapped him on the face.

“Kneel down,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Liu Shihui couldn’t help but be stunned, and then he said angrily, “You dared to slap my face? Qin Yu, are you f * cking crazy!”

“Slap!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and slapped his face again.

“Kneel down for me!” Qin Yu shouted angrily.

“F * ck you!” Liu Shihui shouted angrily!

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and slapped his face again!

“If you don’t kneel, I will beat you until you kneel today!” Qin Yu said coldly.

One slap, two slaps, three slaps...

A series of “slap” sounds came from the scene, and Liu Shihui’s face was swollen!

When everyone saw this scene, they felt that it was somewhat surreal.

Liu Shihui, who had always been high and mighty... was actually slapped in front of everyone?

“Brat, let go of Young Master Liu quickly!” At this moment, Liu Shihui’s henchman suddenly shouted angrily. He leaped up from the spectator stand and charged directly at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t even look at him and slapped him casually. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Before the henchman even landed, he was sent flying out again.

“Liu Shihui, no one can save you today.” Qin Yu continued to slap Liu Shihui’s face.

Finally, Liu Shihui couldn’t take it anymore.

If he continued to get slapped, he might really die here today!

“I’ll kneel! I’ll kneel!” Liu Shihui shouted in pain.

Qin Yu sneered and walked to the side to wait for Liu Shihui to kneel.

Under everyone’s eyes, Liu Shihui knelt in front of Yao Qing with a plop!

This was definitely a historic scene! The news of Liu Shihui kneeling down would probably spread throughout the entire South City and even the entire Chuzhou!

And this young man called Qin Yu would probably be infamous in an instant!

Looking at Liu Shihui kneeling on the ground, Qin Yu nodded his head.

“Liu Shihui, according to the agreement, you must give me a hundred-year-old herb king as well as this Water Dragon Cave,” Qin Yu reminded.

Liu Shihui grinned and laughed maniacally. “The herb king is at my house. Do you dare to take it?”

Qin Yu sneered. “Why wouldn’t I dare to take what belongs to me?”
