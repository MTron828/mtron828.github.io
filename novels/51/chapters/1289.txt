Chapter 1290: Chapter 1,290, looking for Qin Yu 

Zhong Wu sneered as he watched Qin Yu leave.

Meanwhile, Jing Bai and Guan Zhuang quickly chased after him.

They caught up with Qin Yu and said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, are you really going to leave?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I have to take revenge for my team leader. Jin Lun and the Heavenly Cloud sect must pay the price.”

“Oh right, I have to remind you to be careful of that Zhong Wu. I always feel that this matter is related to him.”

Jing Bai was stunned and said, “What do you suspect?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he finally shook his head and said, “Forget it. I don’t have any evidence. Everything is just a guess. In short, you should be careful.”

After saying that, Qin Yu ignored the two of them and walked toward the Green Rock Forest.

To Qin Yu, the only place he could go to now was the Green Rock Forest.

The green rock forest was extremely huge. There were mountains and trees everywhere, and demonic beasts were everywhere.

Qin Yu had already lost his spiritual energy, so it wouldn’t be that easy for him to capture Qin Yu’s figure.

After the death of the team leader, Zhong Wu successfully took over.

He quickly told this news to Ling Yun.

Ling Yun couldn’t help but sneer when he heard the news.

“This Zhong Wu is quite capable,”Ling Yun said in a low voice.

“HMPH, he’s just a treacherous villain,”the almighty beside him scolded.

Ling Yun smiled faintly. “I want this kind of person. It’s easier to control him.”

After saying that, Ling Yun stood up from the ground.

He patted the soil on his butt and said, “Let’s go.”

“Where are we going?”

“Qingyan Forest. Zhong Wu said that Qin Yu entered Qingyan Forest.”

The few of them immediately entered Qingyan Forest and prepared to capture Qin Yu.

At this moment, the wound on Qin Yu’s hand had yet to recover. Due to the loss of spiritual energy, the healing speed of Qin Yu’s wound was extremely slow.

Furthermore, this wound was on his fist, and his bones were already exposed. The slightest touch would cause a heart-wrenching pain.

“Damn, it’s too inconvenient without spiritual energy.”Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at his hands, and couldn’t help but sigh.

Qin Yu took the map and walked towards the depths of the green rock forest.

He was extremely careful along the way, and as long as he encountered demonic beasts, he would choose to avoid them.

He might as well not make a move against Qin Yu, which allowed Qin Yu’s journey to be considered smooth.

After traveling for an unknown period of time, as they ventured deeper into the green rock forest, the oppressive feeling became stronger and stronger.

In the dark, the demonic beasts were moving more and more frequently. From time to time, one could see the towering tree being snapped in half, and one could also hear the roars of the demonic beasts soaring into the sky.

Looking Up, one could see an ancient giant elephant that was several hundred meters tall flashing past. It was incomparably terrifying.

In the sky, there were giant pythons that looked like divine dragons circling around, intimidating everyone.

There was still a long way to go before such a giant appeared. No one knew just how terrifying the existence of this forbidden area was.

“Let’s rest here for a while.”Qin Yu looked at his surroundings. This place was considered safe. There were trees covering his body, so it was difficult to find him.

Qin Yu sat there cross-legged, slowly recovering from his injuries.

“Sigh, I don’t know how long it will take to recover my spiritual energy.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

As long as he recovered his spiritual energy, he wasn’t afraid of the Heavenly Cloud sect at all.

It could even be said that with Qin Yu’s ability, once he recovered his spiritual energy, he would definitely be able to step into the mighty realm!

God knows how terrifying Qin Yu was at the mighty realm.

...

At this moment, Ling Yun had also stepped into the Green Rock Forest and was looking for Qin Yu’s tracks.

Even though they were forcefully suppressing their internal QI, they were still unable to escape from the sharp-smelling demonic beasts.

Along the way, countless demonic beasts were rampaging and blocking their way.

Even though the three of them were powerful, they were still unable to do much against the attacks of the numerous demonic beasts.

“Chi!”

The treasured sword in Ling Yun’s hand sliced through the neck of a lunar eclipse wolf. Fresh blood splattered everywhere.

“These detestable beasts...”Ling Yun couldn’t help but grit his teeth.

“This is green rock forest after all, the territory of the demonic beasts. It’s better for us to be more careful,”an almighty reminded them.

Ling Yun said coldly, “Does he think that I’ll let him off just because he’s hiding here? That’s impossible! No matter what, I have to find him!”

The few of them continued to shuttle through, but Qingyan Forest was too big! It was like looking for a needle in a haystack for the three of them to find Qin Yu.

For three whole days, Ling Yun’s body was covered in wounds and blood.

Even though they were powerful, the demonic beasts they encountered became stronger as they ventured deeper into qingyan forest.

Demonic Beasts in the mighty realm could be seen everywhere. There were even demonic beasts at the peak of the mighty realm that could send the three of them flying with a casual slap.

“No, if this continues, I’m afraid we’ll die here.”Ling Yun clenched his teeth.

“Maybe that Qin Yu has already died in the Green Rock Forest.”

Ling Yun glanced at him and said coldly, “If he’s alive, we’ll see him. If he’s dead, we’ll see his corpse.”

“How about this? We can go to the hunter organization and issue a bounty. Now that Qin Yu has been expelled from the hunter organization, we can issue a bounty to find him,”a mighty figure suggested.

Ling Yun pondered for a moment before looking at one of them. “Go back and get the tracing disk. We’ll issue a bounty.”

“Alright, I’ll go back now.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The tracing disk was a mysterious magical artifact. It could be used to easily find anyone.

Of course, if one was too powerful, the tracing disk would lose its use.

However, they didn’t believe that Qin Yu’s strength was above theirs.

As for Ling Yun, he brought the remaining two people to the hunter organization.

When he saw Ling Yun walking over, Jing Bai’s face instantly darkened.

“What are you guys doing here?”Jing Bai suppressed the anger in his heart and asked coldly.

Ling Yun glanced at him and said, “I’m here to issue a bounty.”

“I’m sorry, we don’t accept it. Please leave immediately,”Jing Bai said coldly.

“That’s right, get lost!”The other hunters also shouted loudly.

“You killed our team leader and still have the face to come to the hunter organization? Get lost quickly, or don’t blame us for being impolite!”

Hearing the angry curses of the crowd, Ling Yun couldn’t help but feel a strong murderous intent in his heart.
