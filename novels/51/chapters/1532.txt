Chapter 1533: Chapter 1,533, immortal slaying Holy Sword! 1

At this moment, Qin Yu’s entire body was covered in golden light, and his internal Qi was completely different.

His skin was like Suet Jade, but it also had a rigid beauty. Under the golden light, his muscles were extremely dazzling and resplendent.

And the pressure that he emitted made people feel even more terrified.

“It’s... It’s really him!”Sima bei’s expression changed drastically!

He didn’t expect Qin Yu to possess such a terrifying aura just after stepping into the mighty realm of internal Qi!

This pressure made Sima bei feel terrified!

“I actually failed!”At this moment, Sima Bei regretted not falling. If he had known this would happen, he would have killed Zhuo Jing earlier!

Very soon, Qin Yu strode over.

Behind him, a golden light followed. Wherever it passed, it was enveloped by the light.

Sima bei grabbed Zhuo Jing’s neck with one hand. Then, he looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “I really didn’t expect that you, who has stepped into the mighty realm, would have such a powerful internal Qi.”

Qin Yu pointed at Zhuo Jing in his hand and said, “Let him go.”

Sima bei raised his eyebrows and sneered, “You want to let him go? He’s ruining my plans. I have to kill him.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Let him go and I’ll let you die a quick death.”

......

“Hahahahaha!”

Hearing this, Sima Bei couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Kid, you’re too arrogant. So what if you’ve stepped into the mighty realm? Do you think that I, Sima Bei, Will Be Afraid of You? !”Sima bei shouted with an imposing manner!

However, he was slapped in the face in less than two seconds of acting tough.

A golden light streaked past in front of him. Then, Sima Bei’s arm that was holding onto Zhuo Jing was directly cut off!

Zhuo Jing also fell into Qin Yu’s arms.

Sima bei looked at his broken arm in a daze. After a long while, he let out a painful howl!

“You...”Sima bei wished he could slap himself twice!

The moment he was distracted, he had ruined the big picture. How could Sima Bei not be angry!

Qin Yu hugged Zhuo Jing with one hand, then raised his palm and slapped Zhuo Jing’s back.

A stream of spiritual qi flowed through Qin Yu’s palm and into Zhuo Jing’s body.

Even though Qin Yu could not recover the spiritual power of others like Jue Wu, this spiritual Qi still allowed Zhuo Jing to recover more than half of it.

“Brother Qin, you...”

“No need to say more. Rest well. After I kill him, I’ll bring you back,”Qin Yu interrupted Zhuo Jing.

Not far away, Sima Bei’s expression became even colder.

Qin Yu’s speed had already exceeded his imagination, and Sima Bei had no choice but to take this seriously.

“How can a newly advanced mighty figure have such terrifying speed?”Sima bei didn’t care about his broken palm. Internal Qi was surging all over his body, and it seemed like he would explode at any moment.

A boundless radiance appeared around his body. This radiance was Sima Bei’s domain power.

“Brother Qin, be careful!”Zhuo Jing hurriedly warned.

Qin Yu coldly looked at Sima bei, his heart extremely calm.

A black domain appeared around Sima Bei’s body.

The power of this domain was extremely terrifying. It was also Sima Bei’s trump card technique.

“Kid, if an opponent like you can’t be used by the northern lands, then we have to get rid of you,”Sima Bei said coldly.

Qin Yu acted as if he didn’t hear him, and instead asked, “What exactly is the relationship between the northern lands and the immortal slaying sect?”

When he heard the words immortal slaying sect, Sima Bei’s expression suddenly changed!

“You... you know about the immortal slaying sect?”Sima Bei’s eyes widened.

Qin Yu sneered, “You guys have indeed obtained the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect. I was wondering how you guys managed to come up with so many strange and brilliant spells.”

Sima bei’s expression turned grave.

He narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “Since that’s the case, I can’t let you live anymore...”

With that, Sima bei waved his hand and thousands of black beams of light shot towards Qin Yu! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

This was the technique that had severely injured Zhuo Jing not too long ago. That black beam of light was extremely powerful, incomparably sharp, and could cut through everything!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly, and with a wave of his hand, golden light streaked across, and all the beams of light instantly shattered!

Sima bei’s expression instantly became even uglier. Although this technique was not his trump card, its power was terrifyingly powerful. Now that it had been easily neutralized by Qin Yu, how could he not be worried!

“Go to hell!”After Sima Bei’s furious roar, the domain power on his body actually directly restricted Qin Yu’s body!

Under this power, Qin Yu’s body seemed to be restricted, unable to move at all!

“Brat, this is the power obtained after comprehending the laws. It’s not something a mortal like you can understand,”Sima bei said coldly, as if victory was within his grasp.

Qin Yu, however, sneered. He clenched his fist and raised his hand to break the ten thousand spell breaking punch!

“Boom!”

A loud sound exploded, and a terrifying power poured out from this domain, shooting into the sky!

The domain, which was known as indestructible, was actually shattered by Qin Yu with a single punch!

“How is this possible!”Sima bei’s expression instantly changed greatly!

Qin Yu looked at Sima bei coldly and said, “If you were in your peak state, you might still be able to fight me. However, the current you is not stable, and I will kill you like slaughtering chickens and dogs.”Qin Yu’s internal Qi was extremely unstable

Just as Qin Yu said, Sima Bei was first heavily injured by Zhuo Jing’s Silver Spring, and then he was affected by the heavenly tribulation. His internal Qi was already in disorder and was far from his peak state!

“Tell me the secrets of the northern lands, and I will let you die a quick death,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Sima bei laughed loudly and said, “In your dreams! Even the current me can still kill you!”

“Weng!”

With that, a light suddenly flashed between Sima Bei’s brows. This inverted light pierced through the sky, and a palm-sized sword appeared between his brows!

This sword was extremely resplendent, and there was a strange sound coming from the edge of the sword!

Seeing this sword, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Although he didn’t know the origin of this sword, he felt a familiar feeling from this sword.

“Qin Yu, since you know about the immortal slaying sect, you must also know about this secret technique,”Sima Bei said coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice, “So it’s not a real sword, but the immortal slaying sect’s secret technique...”

Seeing Qin Yu’s expression, Sima bei sneered, “Of course, you can’t understand it. This is also the power of comprehending laws. Its lethality is unparalleled in the world. It’s the forbidden secret technique of the immortal slaying sect!”

“Ever since I comprehended this technique, I have never used it. I didn’t expect that I would use it on you today...”

What? ? ! Even in a sect like the immortal slaying sect, it was considered a forbidden technique?

“Qin Yu, what he said is true. This technique is called the immortal slaying Holy Sword. It was created by the third sect master. The purpose of creating this technique was to kill immortals. I didn’t expect that he had even comprehended the immortal slaying Holy Sword...”

Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s voice slowly came from the spatial magic artifact, indicating that this technique had an extraordinary origin.
