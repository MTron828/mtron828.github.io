The black-robed man didn’t dare to be negligent. He respectfully took out the Sacred Heart technique and handed it to Yong Ji.

After receiving the Sacred Heart technique, Yong Ji’s expression eased up a little.

He put away the Sacred Heart technique and coldly said, “Get lost.”

However, the black-robed man didn’t have the slightest intention of leaving. He smiled and said, “Mr. Yong Ji, then how should we deal with this matter?”

Veins popped up on Yong Ji’s forehead. He gritted his teeth and said coldly, “Don’t tell me you want me to declare war with Jue Wu!”

The black-robed man was a little embarrassed. He knew that Yong Ji cherished his feathers. It was impossible for him to declare war with Jue Wu.

“Jue Wu can’t move,”Yong Ji said coldly.

At this point, Yong Ji suddenly changed the topic and said indifferently, “But I have a way to get rid of Qin Yu, but I prefer to get Qin Yu to join us.”

The black-robed man sighed and said, “If we could get Qin Yu to join us, we would have done so long ago. It’s just that it’s too difficult.”

“Have you tried? How would you know if you don’t try?”Yong Ji frowned and said.

The black-robed man said in a deep voice, “This Qin Yu doesn’t even put the heavenly cloud sect in his eyes. It’s enough to prove that he’s an unruly and untamable person. Moreover, she has a good relationship with Jue Wu and Xiao Hai, so it’s better to give up.”

Upon hearing this, Yong Ji also felt that it made sense.

He was silent for a moment and said with some regret, “I’ve always wanted to rope in Qin Yu. It seems that there’s no chance. What a pity.”

If he joined Eternal City, it would definitely be a rare good news for Yong Ji.

“Since there’s no way to rope him in, we can only get rid of him.”The black-robed man struck while the iron was hot.

Yong Ji’s eyes were gloomy. A moment later, he shouted, “Hua Zi!”

A moment later, a young man pushed the door open and entered.

Seeing the injuries on Yong Ji’s body, hua zi hurriedly asked, “Foster father, what happened to you?”

Yong Ji did not answer this question. Instead, he asked, “There is something I need you to do now.”

Hua Zi hurriedly nodded and said, “Please instruct me, Foster Father!”

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and said, “I want to declare war with Qin Yu and get rid of him in the name of seeking advice. Are You Willing?”

Hua Zi was stunned for a moment before he excitedly said, “Of course I’m willing! Foster father, I have long disliked that Qin Yu!”

“Alright, then I’ll leave this matter to you. I hope you can give me a good result,”Yong Ji said.

Hua Zi hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Please rest assured, foster father. I will definitely do my best to kill Qin Yu!”

After saying this, Yong Ji waved his hand and asked Hua Zi to leave.

After he left, the black-robed man frowned and said, “Mr. Yong Ji, can this young man do it? Qin Yu is not simple.”

Yong ji said indifferently, “Hua Zi is one of my most outstanding foster sons. Getting rid of Qin Yu is not a problem. Isn’t killing Qin Yu What You All Want?”

The black-robed man nodded slightly. This was exactly what the first elder had requested.

“I hope it can succeed.”The black-robed man sighed.

Yong ji sneered, “The geniuses of the South Province are all under my tutelage. When the cat’s away, the mice will play.”

The black-robed man cupped his hands repeatedly and said, “Then I’ll wait for the good news from Mister Yong Ji!”

Mount Hua Ning.

Jue Wu acted as if nothing had happened. He ate and drank as usual, feeling quite comfortable.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu, who was in the cultivation room, could not calm his mind at all.

After thinking for a long time, he finally left the cultivation room and came all the way to this pavilion.

When he saw Qin Yu, Jue Wu said in surprise, “Qin Yu, what are you doing here? Have you come out of seclusion?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “You... Are You Alright?”

Jue Wu sneered and said, “What could be wrong with me? If it weren’t for you, I would have slapped them to death!”

After saying that, Jue Wu waved her little hand with a fierce look.

Qin Yu sat across from Jue Wu and said, “Do you know who did it?”

Jue Wu frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “They claim to be from the northern lands.”

“The northern lands?”Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change. He then took a deep breath and said, “It seems that senior Xiao Hai’s worries are not without reason. The people of the northern lands have already gone deep into Mount Hua Ning.”

Upon mentioning this topic, Jue Wu’s gaze also became a little cold.

“These people from the northern lands are really audacious. They actually set their sights on me!”Jue Wu said coldly.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “If a war really broke out between the southern region and the northern lands, no one would be able to escape unscathed. Everyone would be affected.”

Jue Wu nodded and agreed with Qin Yu.

“It’s time to think of a countermeasure. If it really doesn’t work, I’ll go to the northern border as well,”Jue Wu said as he took a sip of wine.

Qin Yu felt a little uneasy. He always felt that this big battle wouldn’t take too long.

“Since you’re already here, come drink with me,”Jue Wu said casually.

Qin Yu was indeed not in the mood, so he simply accompanied Jue Wu and drank here.

The two of them drank the whole night until early morning.

The two of them were quite powerful, so they didn’t get drunk the whole night.

Meanwhile, Wen Da and Wen Er lay there and slept the whole night.

The next day, Qin Yu got up and stretched himself, then said, “I have to go into closed-door cultivation as soon as possible.”

Jue Wu waved his hand casually and said, “Go, go, go. No matter what time it is, improving your cultivation is the key.”

Qin Yu grunted and was about to go back to the cultivation room.

At this time, Jue Wu’s two disciples suddenly ran in.

“Lord Jue Wu, someone who claims to be Mister Yong Ji’s foster son is here to see you,”the two said.

Jue Wu frowned slightly and muttered, “Yong Ji’s foster son? Why is his disciple here to see me?”

“This... We don’t know either. We only heard that he requested to see Lord Jue Wu,”the two answered truthfully.

Jue Wu impatiently waved his hand and said, “Let him in.”

“Yes.”

A few minutes later.

A young man walked up from the foot of the mountain.

This person was none other than Mr. Yong Ji’s disciple, Hua Zi.

Hua Zi came all the way to the top of the mountain. He cupped his hands to jue wu and said, “Greetings, Master Jue Wu.”

Jue Wu glanced at him and said, “Tell me, what do you want from me?”

Hua Zi’s gaze immediately fell on Qin Yu.

There was a hint of hostility and a hint of contempt in his eyes.

“I’m here to look for Qin Yu,”hua zi said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu was stunned and said with a hint of surprise, “Why are you looking for me?”

Hua Zi said indifferently, “I heard that your strength is outstanding and you claim to be the number one person among the younger generation in the southern province. I, Hua Zi, want to experience it.”

After saying that, hua zi directly took out a challenge letter and threw it to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took the letter of challenge and said with some surprise, “Are you giving me a letter of Challenge?”

“What else?”Hua Zi sneered, “Qin Yu, my master said that your talent is outstanding. I, Hua Zi, am indeed not convinced. I wonder if you dare to fight with me?”
