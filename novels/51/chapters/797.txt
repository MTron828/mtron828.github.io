Chapter 798: Chapter 798, the Magic Weapon of the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Granny Qin’s face was gloomy. She had originally planned to rely on the martial saint’s weapon to forcefully bring the corpse back.

But now, for some unknown reason, when she faced Qin Yu, she actually felt some fear in her heart.

She did not know if it was because of the two corpses or because of Qin Yu himself.

After thinking over and over again, Granny Qin snorted coldly and said, “I hope you will keep your word. Otherwise, the JINGDU martial arts association will not let you off!”

After saying this, Granny Qin turned around and left.

Looking at her departing back, Qin Yu could not help but let out a cold snort.

“Come, you also possess the power of a martial saint. Let Me See who is stronger.”Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Granny Qin turned around and returned to her own residence.

She looked at Blackie, who was leaning against her body, and could not help but smile.

“The higher-ups have already agreed. They will give me the transformation pill the day after tomorrow,”Granny Qin said with a smile.

“At that time, you will still return to your human form.”

Hearing this, Blackie used his huge head to gently rub Granny Qin.

At this moment, Granny Qin sighed slightly and said in a low voice, “Ever since that Qin Yu appeared, Jingdu has become more and more restless.”

At the mention of Qin Yu’s name, Little Black’s mouth immediately spat out his tongue, and his body also trembled slightly.

An angry internal Qi wandered through the room, shaking the entire room until it buzzed.

Granny Qin comforted him, “I know you hate him. Don’t worry. When you return to your human form, I will give you a chance.”

Hearing this, Little Black’s trembling body finally eased up.

...

For the rest of the day, Qin Yu did not leave the mansion with the handlebar moustache.

On this day, Qin Yu had just taken out the power of creation from the spatial artifact when someone suddenly walked in from outside.

“Qin Yu, someone is looking for you.”The person who came was a staff member of the Martial Arts Academy.

Qin Yu glanced at him and frowned, “Someone is looking for me? Who is looking for me?”

“The Pavilion Master of the pavilion of heavenly secrets, Luo Jingyu.”

Hearing this name, Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

The Pavilion Master of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets? He came looking for him?

“I got it. I’ll go out immediately,”Qin Yu said.

He put away the power of creation and couldn’t help but smile coldly.

It seemed that the Pavilion Master of the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets was here to settle the score.

Qin Yu stood up and walked out of the martial arts academy in large strides. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At the entrance of the academy, he saw an old man and a young man standing there.

These two people were the father and son of the pavilion of heavenly secrets.

And behind them were three people.

The three people were carrying boxes of various sizes in their hands, which looked like gifts.

Qin Yu walked directly to Luo Jingyu and said with a faint smile, “Pavilion Master Luo, what business do you have with me?”

Luo Jingyu bowed and said, “A few days ago, I went out on an errand and didn’t return for a long time, so the pavilion of heavenly secrets was handed over to my son.”

“I never thought that my son would actually do such a heinous thing. After I heard about it, I immediately brought a generous gift to apologize to you.”

“Apologize?”A trace of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

This was something that Qin Yu didn’t expect.

Luo jingyu sighed and said, “My son has been pampered since he was young and doesn’t know etiquette. Mr. Qin, please forgive me.”

As the saying goes, one shouldn’t hit a smiling person.

Luo Jingyu’s attitude made it difficult for Qin Yu to flare up.

“Pavilion Master Luo is too polite,”Qin Yu replied indifferently.

Luo Jingyu sighed slightly and said, “His actions not only affected him personally, but also the entire pavilion of Heavenly Secrets! He is simply embarrassing the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets!”

After saying that, Luo Jingyun looked at Luo Yang with a cold face and berated, “Why aren’t you apologizing to Mr. Qin?”

Luo Yang quickly walked in front of Qin Yu, bowed and said, “Mr. Qin, I was rude and offended you. Please forgive me.”

Qin Yu frowned.

This was not like Luo Yang’s personality.

“No worries.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Why aren’t you thanking Mr. Qin?”Luo Jingyu berated.

Luo Yang quickly bowed and said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin, for your magnanimity!”

Then, Luo Jingyu looked at the people behind him and said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, this is a small token of appreciation. Take it as an apology. Please accept it.”

Qin Yu looked at the few boxes.

He released his spiritual sense and found that the boxes were all containing some spiritual artifacts.

Although these spiritual artifacts couldn’t be considered top-notch, they were still considered top-notch.

Qin Yu waved his hand repeatedly and said, “Pavilion Master Luo is too polite. I appreciate your apology. It’s better to take back this gift.”

Luo Jingyu said with a stern face, “That won’t do. If you do something wrong, you have to pay the price. This is what you should do!”

“Hurry up and carry the things in for Mr. Qin!”Luo Jingyu shouted.

The few of them quickly carried the box and walked into the martial arts academy.

Unfortunately, outsiders couldn’t enter at all, so they could only leave the box at the door.

Such a posture indeed surprised Qin Yu.

If Luo Jingyu really had such a posture, how could he have taught such an impolite person like Luo Yang? This was unreasonable.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “Pavilion Master Luo, is there something you want to talk to me about? If there’s something, just say it.”

“I like Mr. Qin’s temper,”Luo Jingyu said with a smile.

“Then I’ll be frank with you. You took a spatial god weapon ring from the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets, right?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Yes.”

Luo Jingyu quickly said, “That spatial god weapon is very important to me. Please return it to me, Mr. Qin. If you like it, I can give you another spatial god weapon.”

As expected, he had something to ask!

Although that was the case, that spatial artifact was snatched by Qin Yu, so returning it was not unreasonable.

“I haven’t brought that spatial artifact yet.”After thinking about it for a while, Qin Yu finally decided to think about it.

Luo Jingyu frowned slightly and said, “Mr. Qin, why don’t you go back and get it? I’ll wait for you here.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “How about this? I’ll send it to the pavilion of heavenly secrets in a few days.”

Luo jingyu frowned and said, “Mr. Qin, this thing is very important to me. You’d better go back and get it.”

“Sigh, I’ve put a lot of things in this spatial artifact. Even if I want to clean it up, it’ll take a few days. Pavilion Master Luo, why are you in such a hurry?”

Luo Jingyu opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but at this time, he changed the topic and said with a smile, “Okay, I’m not in a hurry. How about this, I’ll set up a table in the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets Tomorrow and wait for Mr. Qin to come.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

“Then I won’t bother you anymore.”Luo Jingyu bowed slightly to Qin Yu and then left with Luo Yang.

After walking far away, Luo Jingyu’s face instantly darkened.

“Dad, this kid is too arrogant! He really doesn’t want face when given face!”Luo Yang couldn’t help but scold.

Luo Jingyu glanced at Luo Yang and snorted coldly, “Let him be proud first. Wait until I get the ring back, then I’ll settle the score with him!”
