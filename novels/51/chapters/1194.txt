Chapter 1195: Chapter 1195, ancient ruins

The surroundings were pitch black and there was no light source to be seen.

Even with the desolate God’s eye, Qin Yu could only see the general outline.

Last time, Qin Yu could only reach a distance of 10,000 meters at most. His physical body could not withstand it and it was under the protection of the azure wood true body.

But this time, Qin Yu had already dived to a distance of nearly 20,000 meters with just his physical body.

He tried his best to open his desolate divine eyes and scan his surroundings.

The scene from last time appeared once again!

Under the sea, there seemed to be many palaces, and there were traces of activity on the ground. It looked like an ancient ruin.

Looking deeper, one could see spots of potholes on the ground. There were sabers, swords, and rocks everywhere. It seemed to be an ancient battlefield.

The scene was enormous, and the aura was magnificent. It was as if it had experienced a great battle.

The only strange thing was that there were no corpses or bones on the ground.

“It seems that just as I guessed, the ancient ruins have sunk to the bottom of the sea,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Moreover, judging from this enormous scene, it was definitely a world of cultivators.

“Xiao Yu once pulled out an ancient array platform from under the sea. Could it be that she already knew about the ancient ruins at the bottom of the sea?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself.

Although Qin Yu couldn’t sense the internal Qi of the ancient ruins, he was certain that there was definitely a treasure hidden in this ancient ruins.

After all, Earth was an ancient star. It had existed for many years and had given birth to countless great cultivators.

But now, no one could find any trace of them. It was as if everything existed in the legends.

Even the immortal slaying sect existed under the sea, let alone ancient cultivators.

“I really don’t know how many treasures are hidden here,”Qin Yu murmured.

He dived thousands of meters in one breath. At this time, Qin Yu was already more than 20,000 meters deep in the sea.

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that the ancient ruins were like a mirage. It was clearly close at hand, but it seemed to be far away at the horizon.

Qin Yu forcefully endured the pressure from his body and dived a few thousand meters deeper.

At this moment, the surrounding water pressure had already reached an extremely terrifying state.

Even Qin Yu’s body couldn’t withstand it anymore.

“Strange, it clearly looks very close, but why doesn’t the distance seem to have changed at all...”Qin Yu frowned deeply.

If this ancient ruin could be excavated, who knew what treasures it would have.

Moreover, this ancient ruin probably existed for hundreds of thousands of years or even more. At that time, there was no modern civilization on Earth at all.

Lu Yun had said that there were countless talents born on Earth, and every one of them was an existence that transcended the void and looked down upon the universe.

If they could obtain their inheritances and ruins, then the holy region wouldn’t be worth mentioning.

The more Qin Yu thought about it, the more excited he became. Gritting his teeth, he braced himself against the water pressure and continued swimming downstream.

By the time Qin Yu reached thirty thousand meters into the depths of the sea, his body was already unable to withstand the pressure.

He froze on the spot and lowered his head to look at his own body.

“Given my current condition, I’m afraid that if I take another step, my body will be instantly compressed into a bloody mist.”Qin Yu frowned.

The consequences of the previous trip to the Sacred Mausoleum were still vivid in his mind.

After much hesitation, Qin Yu finally decided to give up for now.

He returned to the shore in one breath, his eyes staring at the sea.

“The treasures in this ancient monument are probably not even comparable to those in the saint-level,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“When my physical body takes another step forward, I must think of a way to explore it.”

Qin Yu had a premonition in his heart.

If he could enter this ancient ruin, he would definitely be able to obtain a huge treasure trove, or even the inheritance of a great cultivator transcending the tribulation!

Such an inheritance was a priceless treasure even in the entire universe.

This also made Qin Yu somewhat worried.

If one day the people of the Holy Region discovered this underwater world, would they come to invade?

Hopefully, they will be able to discover this ancient ruin later, Qin Yu thought to himself.

In the next few days, Qin Yu hid in the first secret realm and continued to study the ‘Dou’formula.

Although the current Qin Yu was unable to use his spiritual energy, the ‘Dou’formula would not only increase his spiritual energy, but his physical body would also increase as well.

Since he was unable to use his spiritual energy now, he could only forge his physical body to the limit.

For a few days, Qin Yu didn’t leave the first secret realm.

On the other side, Ye Qing was also trying his best to find information related to Qin Yu’s mother.

Five days later.

Qin Yu, who was studying the sixth level of the Dou character manual, suddenly received a call from ye Qing.

He hurriedly picked up his phone and asked, “Commander Ye, is there any news?”

Ye Qing on the other end of the line grunted and said, “We found information related to this woman. You can come to the Jingdu Military District to get it.”

“There are too many people in the military district. I’ll go to your house to get it tonight,”Qin Yu said.

Ye Qing thought for a moment and said, “Alright, I’ll See You Tonight.”

Qin Yu hung up the phone and took a deep breath. His heart was extremely unsettled.

In this state, it was probably impossible to continue comprehending.

He simply left the first secret realm and arrived at ye Qing’s house early.

...

At this moment, on an island.

He Teng, dressed in a black robe, had his hands behind his back as he looked at the dozen or so people in front of him.

These dozen or so people were none other than the reclusive almighty realm.

“Speak, what business do you have with us?”A mighty figure asked in a cold voice.

He Teng said with a faint smile, “I plan to invite a few seniors to join me in a grand scheme of things.”

“Grand scheme of Things? Other than stepping into the Holy Region, what grand scheme is there to speak of?”A mighty figure sneered. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He Teng waved his finger and said with a faint smile, “Don’t you all want to become the number one sect in the world, the chief of the entire martial arts world?”

“Hahaha, childish! It’s just an empty title. What’s the use?”A mighty figure sneered.

“Whoever is interested stays. Anyway, I’m not interested. I’ll leave first.”There was even a mighty figure who turned around and was about to leave.

He Teng seemed to have already expected this, he said indifferently, “Have you all forgotten why Qin Yu was able to obtain a quota this time? “It’s because his heaven gate is the number one sect in the world! “Don’t you all want to obtain a quota in advance the next time you head to the Holy Region?”

Once these words were said, the many mighty figures who had originally planned to leave quickly stopped in their tracks.
