1800 Luck

Qin Yu wanted to refuse, but he changed his mind immediately and stopped Gu Sanchen.

“Brother Gu, wait a minute. Have a few more drinks with us.” Qin Yu smiled.

Gu Sanchen was a little surprised and smiled. “Sure, no problem.”

Gu Sanchen sat down again.

Qin Yu squinted his eyes as if he had a plan.

!!

“Brother Gu, Forbidden Zones are extremely dangerous. It won’t be safe to go there without anyone else, right? When those aristocratic families went there before, they brought quite a few helpers,” he said with a smile.

Gu Sanchen nodded and smiled. “Brother Qin, don’t worry. I have some friends here, so I’ll gather a group to go together.”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu was overjoyed!

“Brother Gu, do you have anyone in mind? May I know who they are?” he asked hurriedly.

Gu Sanchen shook his head. “Not yet. Why? Do you have any ideas, Brother Qin?”

Qin Yu nodded and sighed, “We don’t want anything happens on this journey, so those coming with us must be cautious and with some abilities.”

“That’s right.” Gu Sanchen nodded.

“I heard about a man called Yang Yu in Heavenly Ocean City, and people say he’s quite strong. I knew this name before I came to Heavenly Ocean City,” Qin Yu continued.

Gu Sanchen nodded and said, “You are right. Yang Yu is one of the best in Heavenly Ocean City.”

“Brother Gu, do you know him?” Qin Yu suppressed the excitement in his heart.

“We’ve met once,” Gu Sanchen said with a smile.

“I heard that he picked up a Saint Weapon near Forbidden Zone. If we can get him to bring it with us, it’ll be a plus,” Qin Yu continued. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Are you serious?” Gu Sanchen asked in surprise.

“I am!” Qin Yu said with certainty.

“Alright, I’ll pass by to see him later,” Gu Sanchen said.

“It’s a deal then, Brother Gu. I’ll see you tomorrow.” Qin Yu nodded.

Making an appointment with Gu Sanchen, Qin Yu left with Jue Wu.

After leaving the tavern for a while, Jue Wu said with disdain, “You are a professional liar, huh?”

“I had no choice.” Qin Yu sighed. “He thought that I was from Zhongzhou, and I just seized the opportunity.”

Qin Yu didn’t know how to make Yang Yu leave his residence, but he had a decent plan now.

Since Gu Sanchen was a member of one of the nine great families of Zhongzhou, no one should refuse him.

Moreover, there was a high chance of obtaining a supreme treasure in the Forbidden Zone.

“Let Gu Sanchen test the waters and see if Yang Yu has any Saint Weapons,” Qin Yu said.

Jue Wu gave Qin Yu a thumbs-up and said, “You are such a bad boy.”

“F*ck off.” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

At this time, the sky was still bright. They finally had a chance to visit Crimson Moon Continent, so they decided to take a stroll.

Heavenly Ocean City was very different from the cities in Nanzhou and East Continent, for the locals here seemed to be quite fierce and powerful.

Peddlers were everywhere on the streets. There were all kinds of divine weapons and magical artifacts on display, which were claimed to be from the Forbidden Zone. However, Qin Yu could tell they were fake right away.

Anyone with some experience could tell they were counterfeits.

After walking for a while, Qin Yu and Jue Wu noticed a shop at the same time.

This was a shop of natural ores, similar to stone gambling.

Moreover, it was the most popular one, for gambling always attracted crowds.

Like the other peddlers, this natural ore shop claimed that the goods here came from Forbidden Zone and might have all kinds of Dharma Treasure within.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu stopped at this place. Jue Wu, who was very into this kind of entertainment, even didn’t plan to leave.

She rubbed her hands, looked at Qin Yu, and said, “Shall we?”

“Sure, let’s see how lucky we are,” Qin Yu said.

The two walked forward.

After stepping into the shop, he saw a large number of natural ores inside.

These natural ores were very different from those in other areas. Whatever technique it was, each of them looked extraordinary and brilliant.

“These natural ores come from Forbidden Zone. You can feel the power of the Forbidden Zone on them, right? It’s crazy!” The shop assistant was trying his best to attract more customers.

Qin Yu did not say much and quietly activated his desolate divine eye to scan the natural ores.

Very quickly, Qin Yu discovered that his desolate divine eye didn’t work on some of the natural ores.

This surprised Qin Yu. He frowned and said in a low voice, “Maybe these natural ores really come from Forbidden Zone?”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu tried to buy a natural ore that blocked his desolate divine eye earlier.

The natural ores were pretty expensive, and any one of them cost millions of spirit coins.

The natural ore that Qin Yu bought was cut open in front of everyone.

Unfortunately, there was nothing inside. It was just a rock.

“That’s weird.” Qin Yu frowned.

He picked out a few more natural ores that his desolate divine eye couldn’t work on, but unfortunately, they were all empty.

In less than an hour, Qin Yu had already lost tens of millions of spirit coins.

Jue Wu grimaced in pain.

“You are one of the unluckiest men I know! Let me try it!” Jue Wu rolled up her sleeves.

She knocked on these natural ores as if she was buying fruit in the market. Finally, she chose a huge natural ore.

“This is it!” Jue Wu said excitedly.

Qin Yu frowned, for his desolate divine eye could scan this natural ore, which was pitch black inside without any light.

How could there be any Dharma Treasure in this natural ore?

“Not this one,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Jue Wu sneered. “You know nothing! This is it!”

“This natural ore is worth 100 million spirit coins. Are you sure about this?” the shop assistant said excitedly.

“This is it. Cut the crap!” Jue Wu shouted.

She looked at Qin Yu, waved her hand, and said, “Where’s the money?”

Qin Yu had no choice but to pay for the natural ore.

After paying, a few workers carried the natural ore and began to cut it with a secret technique.

No one expected anything from this giant natural ore. Instead, everyone looked at Jue Wu with a smile as if waiting to see Jue Wu make a fool of herself.

However, Jue Wu didn’t care about others but only stared at the natural ore.

The natural ore was slowly cut open in front of the crowd.

There was nothing after the first cut, and it was the same for the second.

However, on the thirty-eighth cut, the natural ore suddenly began to shatter, and the outer layer fell off by itself.
