1918 Something Happened to Chang Mang

Qin Yu could not help but sneer in his heart.

This Si Shiyue was good at showing.

“The Yan family did not keep you to be a good-for-nothing,” Si Shiyue said coldly.

Before he finished speaking, he suddenly waved his hand, and a quick and powerful light ruthlessly slapped Qin Yu!

!!

Qin Yu, who was caught off guard, was instantly forced back a few steps by the strike, and spat out a mouthful of blood!

The strike broke two of his ribs, and his chest was indented a few centimeters.

“What a powerful strength!” Qin Yu exclaimed in his heart.

As expected of a chaotic body, this level of strength was enough to be at the top of the young generation!

“Si Shiyue, what are you doing!” Seeing this, Yan Ruoxue was furious. She immediately stood up and blocked in front of Qin Yu.

“What’s the use of keeping such trash by your side?” Si Shiyue said coldly.

Yan Ruoxue looked at Si Shiyue coldly and said, “He’s my people. I don’t need you to interfere. I also don’t need you to teach me what to do!”

Si Shiyue furrowed his brows slightly. He stared at Yan Ruoxue and said with some displeasure, “Ruoxue, you’re angry with me for a servant?”

“Si Shiyue, you’d better not cross the line.” Yan Ruoxue’s body emitted a terrifying internal qi.

Si Shiyue’s expression became colder. Their eyes met, and their internal qi seemed to be colliding.

A moment later, Si Shiyue said with a smile, “Ruoxue, he’s just a servant. Why do you have to be like this?”

He retracted his internal qi, laughed, and said, “I was just worried that something might have happened to you. Thus I came to see you.”

“I’m fine. Nothing would happen to me,” Yan Ruoxue said expressionlessly.

Not far away, Uncle Yan waved his hand, and a table appeared in front of everyone.

The two brothers of the Si family sat at the table and picked up the tea in front of them.

“As long as you’re fine, I’ll be at ease,” Si Shiyue said with a smile.

However, Yan Ruoxue was not in the mood. She kept looking at Qin Yu from time to time as if she wanted to check on Qin Yu’s injuries.

Qin Yu was worried that he would cause trouble to Yan Ruoxue. Thus he endured the pain and quickly stood behind Yan Ruoxue.

“Miss Yan, if I remember correctly, you’ve already undergone the 28th bloodline baptism, right?” Si Shifeng suddenly asked.

Yan Ruoxue nodded slightly in response.

Si Shiyue continued the conversation and said with emotion, “I can feel your strength has improved a lot since the last time.”

“Thank you for your compliment. You’re not bad either,” Yan Ruoxue said somewhat perfunctorily.

“Brother Yue, with your current conditions, it won’t take long for you to reach the True Saint cultivation realm, right?” Si Shifeng laughed and said.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned ugly.

Once Si Shifeng entered the True Saint cultivation realm, Qin Yu would no longer have the chance to fight him.

Facing a True Saint, all techniques were useless.

“It’s not that easy to become a True Saint.” Fortunately, Si Shiyue quickly denied it.

“I’ve only cultivated for a hundred years or so,” he sighed and said. “I haven’t even touched the slightest bit of the True Saint.”

After saying this, Si Shiyue changed the subject and said with a smile, “But there’s a chance to become a Semi-Saint.”

“As expected of Brother Yue!” Si Shifeng said, pretending to be surprised.

Everyone could tell these two people were putting on an act for Yan Ruoxue to see.

Unfortunately, Yan Ruoxue did not respond. She was not surprised at all by this.

“I plan to enter the True Saint cultivation realm on the day of the Path of Heaven,” Si Shiyue said.

There was a hidden meaning behind his words. Everyone knew the chaotic body and the Yan family’s bloodline had unique compatibility. Once the two dual cultivated, it was not an empty talk about becoming a True Saint.

Si Shiyue’s eyes were looking at Yan Ruoxue, intentionally or otherwise, as if waiting for her answer.

Seeing Yan Ruoxue not responding, Si Shifeng laughed and said, “This way, the day of the Path of Heaven will give birth to two True Saints!”

“That’s right. I believe Ruoxue will be able to enter the True Saint cultivation realm on the day of the Path of Heaven as well,” Si Shiyue said with a smile.

Hearing their words, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He was even more furious.

He couldn’t help but clench his fists, wishing he could immediately tear Si Shiyue into pieces!

“Mr. Si, even if the day of the Path of Heaven descends, there might not be any outcome for us.”

Yan Ruoxue suddenly opened her mouth and said, probably to comfort Qin Yu.

Si Shiyue was not angry. He smiled and said, “The chaotic body and the Yan family’s bloodline are a match made in heaven. Moreover, it was decided by the elders. Regardless of what you think, you can’t change the outcome.”

“That might not be the case.” Yan Ruoxue snorted lightly.

A hint of anger flashed across Si Shiyue’s face. He looked coldly at Yan Ruoxue as if he was on the verge of getting angry.

When Si Shifeng saw this, he quickly changed the topic and said, “Brother Yue, another chaotic body has appeared in the Holy Region. Have you heard of it? ”

At the mention of this, Yan Ruoxue’s expression became a little unnatural.

“Yes,” Si Shiyue nodded slightly and said. “I’ve heard of him. He’s the kid who crushed the Tong family not long ago, right? ”

“That’s right, it’s him.” Si Shifeng nodded.

“I remember his name is… Qin Yu?” Si Shiyue asked.

“That’s right. His name is Qin Yu. I’ve seen him before,” Si Shifeng said with a smile.

...

“Oh?” Si Shiyue was suddenly surprised, while Yan Ruoxue’s expression became even more unnatural. There was even a trace of worry on her face.

“I didn’t expect this Si Shiyue to have heard of me,” Qin Yu, standing at the side, thought to himself.

He looked at Si Shifeng, waiting for him to continue.

“How is this kid?” Si Shiyue asked.

“Brother Yue, you don’t have to worry. He’s just a braggart with a little luck,” Si Shifeng said indifferently.

“If it wasn’t for Saintess Gu, he would have died in my hands.”

“Saintess Gu?” Si Shiyue was even more surprised.

“Mmm,” Si Shifeng responded. He then said, “Not long ago, I met him at a sanctum. Oh yes, Mr. Yan, Yan Yunfan was there too. If you don’t believe me, you can ask him. That Qin Yu isn’t even worth mentioning. He’s full of nonsense and is weak in strength. He’s not comparable to you at all, Brother Yue.”

“Of course,” Si Shiyue said with a faint smile. “Probably there are more than two chaotic bodies in this world, but I’ve never taken them seriously.”

Yan Ruoxue, who was beside him, slightly heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, this Si Shiyue didn’t have any killing intent toward Qin Yu.

...

“Speaking of which, this kid is quite interesting. He was actually traveling with a holy body,” Si Shifeng suddenly said at this moment.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Holy body? Chang Mang?

“I wanted to take him in as my disciple and give him some good fortune, but that kid didn’t know what was good for him.” Chu Shifeng shook his head.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly had a premonition! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He remembered the people Si Shifeng had planted near the Cold Moon Palace!
