Chapter 523: Han Wei’s Clamor! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Ruoxue’s words instantly infuriated Yan Yongxiu!

He raised his hand and was about to slap Yan Ruoxue!

But in the end, his hand only froze in mid-air.

“If grandfather was still here, he wouldn’t have tolerated you guys doing this,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

At the mention of Yan Yunheng, Yan Yongxiu seemed to have found another excuse.

He snorted coldly and said, “You still have the nere to mention your grandfather? Qin Yu is your grandfather’s murderer!”

“Is that so?” The corners of Yan Ruoxue’s mouth curled into a sneer.

“Father, I think you know better than me whether my grandfather is dead or not.”

Yan Yongxiu’s expression changed and he berated, “Don’t talk nonsense! Your grandfather has already passed away!”

“Is that so?” The sneer on Yan Ruoxue’s expression became more and more intense.

“Stop making excuses for your own cowardice.”

“You’re just afraid of my uncle. Even if you have doubts in your heart, you don’t dare to say it out loud, right?”

After he heard Yan Ruoxue’s words, Yan Yongxiu’s expression became extremely ugly!

“You... You’re spouting nonsense!” Yan Yongxiu turned his face to the side.

“All of you are pretentious hypocrites. On the one hand, you bow down to the stronger ones, and on the other hand, you look down on the weaker ones at the bottom.”

“I don’t know how many strengths Qin Yu has, but at least he won’t be as cowardly as you guys.”

Yan Yongxiu was so angry that his face turned ashen, but he had nothing to say.

He had always believed that his father wasn’t dead, but now, he didn’t dare to think too much about it.

He even forced himself to believe in Yan Sihai’s words.

“In short, there’s no chance between you and Qin Yu anymore,” Yan Yongxiu said coldly.

“September 9th is the day of your wedding, and also the day of Qin Yu’s death.”

After saying this, Yan Yongxiu turned his head and left.

A trace of anguish flashed across Yan Ruoxue’s fair and tender face.

Tears flowed out of the corners of her eyes.

...

On this day, Qin Yu sat in the courtyard while trying his best to find the way to step into the Martial Marquis realm.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He took the phone and saw that it was an unfamiliar number from Jingdu.

“Han Wei?” After thinking about it, Qin Yu felt that it could only be Han Wei.

Thus, he picked up the phone and sneered. “Han Wei, have you thought about how to beg for mercy in front of me?”

However, a familiar and pleasant voice came from the other end.

This voice was none other than Yan Ruoxue’s!

“Qin Yu, are you okay?”

When he heard Yan Ruoxue’s voice, Qin Yu’s heart immediately began to race!

He hurriedly got up and said anxiously, “I’m fine. Ruoxue, where are you now? Did you suffer? You...”

“Qin Yu, I don’t have much time. Listen to me,” Yan Ruoxue interrupted Qin Yu. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She said on the phone, “Qin Yu, on September 9th, you must not come to Jingdu.”

“I grew up in an aristocratic family and know their methods.”

“Whether you win or lose, they won’t let you leave Jingdu. I don’t want to see you die.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He grabbed the phone and said, “Ruoxue, I will definitely take you away from Jingdu on that day. Wait for me!”

Yan Ruoxue wanted to say something, but a rough voice came from the other end.

“Who let you make the call?” Yan Sihai’s voice came from the phone.

Before Yan Ruoxue could say anything, the phone was snatched away.

Then, Qin Yu heard a bang! It was like the sound of the phone being smashed!

“Ruoxue!”

Qin Yu immediately became anxious.

He hurriedly called back, but the sound of the phone being turned off came from the other end!

“Yan Sihai, f * ck you!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse!

It was obvious that Yan Ruoxue was suffering!

And all of this was because of Yan Sihai!

“Yan Sihai... I will definitely kill you! I will personally kill you!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and anger filled his chest.

He wanted nothing more than to immediately rush to Jingdu and personally kill Yan Sihai!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone rang again.

The caller was Han Wei this time!

After the call was connected, he heard Han Wei say over the phone, “Qin Yu, have you heard about my wedding with Ruoxue?”

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu scolded.

Han Wei wasn’t angry. He laughed out loud and said, “What, are you anxious now? Haha, that’s expected. When facing something that you are powerless to change, other than being anxious, what else can you do?”

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “Han Wei, let me tell you, Yan Ruoxue doesn’t like you at all. Also, on the 9th of September, I will definitely kill you with my own hands!”

“Hahahahaha!” Han Wei suddenly laughed out loud in a dramatic manner.

“You’re right. She doesn’t like me. So what?” Han Wei said with a sinister tone.

“Qin Yu, I also told you that after we get married, I will make her kneel in front of me every day to serve me!”

“Doesn’t she like you? Then I will break your limbs in front of her! I will lock you in a cage! I will let you see how I punish Yan Ruoxue every day!”

When he heard Han Wei’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his fists!

“Oh, I heard that you have stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm, right? And you even injured Xia Hang?” Han Wei changed the topic and said indifferently.

“For an ant, your achievements are indeed not bad, but unfortunately, you are still an ant in front of me. I can stomp you to death with just a lift of my foot.”

“As for your little achievements, in my eyes, they aren’t worth mentioning at all.”

Qin Yu roared crazily, “Han Wei! If I don’t kill you, I’m not human!”

Han Wei sneered. “Okay, I hope you can appear at my wedding with Yan Ruoxue on September 9th.”

Han Wei deliberately emphasized the word “wedding”.

After saying this, Han Wei directly hung up the phone.

Qin Yu grabbed the phone and threw it to the ground!

Qin Yu was really anxious.

He sat on the ground in dejection.

Han Wei’s words were like a thorn that stabbed into Qin Yu’s heart.

When he was talking about Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu’s heart felt as if it had been pierced by thousands of arrows.

“I will never allow such a thing to happen...”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely complicated. There was anger, pain, and more importantly, impatience.

“You’re sitting on the ground? What kind of divine technique are you practicing?”

At this moment, a familiar voice entered his ears.

Qin Yu looked up and saw a cheeky-looking man with a mustache sitting on the wall.

“Man with the mustache?” Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and took a step forward and quickly arrived in front of the man with the mustache.

He stretched out his hand and grabbed the clothes of the man with the mustache. He said coldly, “You left without saying goodbye last time. How dare you come find me today?”

“Didn’t I promise to take you to three Big Graves?” The man with the mustache muttered.
