Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This terrifying power could slowly refine the body and soul and be absorbed slowly.

Back then, his route was fighting against eight dragons. He fought against the thunder tribulation using the power of his thunder body.

But compared to Yan Ruoxue, her methods were even more terrifying.

It was a technique that could only be comprehended when one had reached the Soul Statue Reaching the Bottoms. In other words, after Yan Ruoxue broke through, her soul had already entered the sea of space and achieved the strength of the Tribulation Third Level. If she took another step forward, she could directly condense the throne of the sea of space.

“Amazing, as expected of my wife!”

Qin Yu was amazed and reached out to hold Yan Ruoxue’s hand.

Yan Ruoxue blushed. Now only did she realize so many people in the surroundings.

“Flower Granny, Dean Lei!”

She bowed to the two.

“Ruoxue, this is my Martial Uncle. You can call her Senior Martial Uncle Qianjie.”

Flower Granny softly said.

“Great! As expected of the descendant of Immortal Emperor Tianming. With such dense bloodline power, you will definitely stand at the peak of the human race in the future…

Hua Qianjie smiled like a blossoming flower as if she was staring at his daughter-in-law.

“Senior Martial Uncle, I’m flattered.

“Now, come to Flower Peak with me. I have something to tell you. This is my son, Qianjie. Both of you should be about the same age. You will get to know each other better in the future.’

At this moment, she had thrown the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes and Evil Eye to the back of her mind. If Yan Ruoxue could fuse with the Lei family’s bloodline, the Lei family was destined to stand at the peak of the human race in the future.

Even if it was just a drop of blood essence might help Lei Qingye to advance.

“Senior Martial Uncle, I have been in retreat for a long time. I want to have a long talk with Qin Yu tonight.”

Yan Ruoxue rejected her directly.

“Junior Sister Ruoxue, there’s no need to be anxious. You’ve just broken through, and Senior Brother can help you solve many problems in the Tribulation Transcending Stage. This way, you’ll be able to stabilize your cultivation realm in the future. It just so happens that I’ve also done some research on the Way of Spatial Rules, and I can discuss it with Junior Sister

Ruoxue.”

Hua Zhikong laughed out loud.

“That’s right, Ruoxue. It’s fine if you were an ordinary cultivator. Your talent has determined that you’re the top combat strength of the human race. Don’t you want to stand at the peak in the future and become one of those people who look down on the world? Moreover, during this chaotic time, choosing a Dao companion has become a major event for the entire human race. Even if you are unhappy today, you will be grateful for my advice today when you continue to break through in the future.”

Hua Qianjie chuckled again.

“That’s right! Junior Sister Ruoxue must not easily entrust yourself to some swindlers. It will drag you into an irredeemable situation!”

Hua Zhikong smiled again. Even if it was by force today, he had to control Yan Ruoxue in Flower Peak.

What was done was irreversible, and he was not afraid that this girl would not listen obediently.

Thinking of the terrifying bloodline power, Hua Zhikong could not wait to pull Yan Ruoxue into Flower Peak immediately.

Lei Qingye and the others hesitated for a while but did not stop him.

“Qin Yu, go back to Demon-slaying Peak and cultivate. I will send Lei Li and Lei Huan to Demon-slaying Peak. If you have any problems with your cultivation, feel free to ask them.’

Lei Qingye made his decision and said.

In chaotic times, one had to be decisive.

“Hahaha, Martial Uncle Lei is too good to this brat. I’m afraid that even with the guidance of the two martial uncles, it would still be difficult for this fellow to break through to the tribulation. Let’s go, Sister Ruoxue.” Hua Zhikong chuckled and reached out to grab Yan Ruoxue.

“Do you guys really think I’m dead?” Qin Yu laughed in extreme anger.

“Black saber!”

The Saber light suddenly erupted. It was the power of assassination that Qin Yu’s black saber of the Ji family had comprehended.

It contained the vague power of the(primordial rune, and in the blink of an eye, the black saber exploded on Hua Zhikong’s body.

The power of assassination the black saber comprehended and the vague power of the spatial primordial rune combined.

If Lei Huan by the side had not reacted in time and pulled Hua Zhikong, this slash would have cut Hua Zhikong into two halves. Nevertheless, he had an injury on his body.

“B*stard, you dare!”

Hua Zhikong looked at the bloody half of his body. He was so angry that he almost lost his mind.

“You’re just a piece of trash. Who are you to talk about bloodline in front of

Qin Yu pulled Yan Ruoxue over.

Yan Ruoxue was stunned. She did not expect Qin Yu to be so powerful.

The power of origin was a power that could onlv be comprehended after Tribulation Fourth Level Condensed Throne and opening up the sea of the Path of Heaven.

“So powerful!”

Looking at Yan Ruoxue’s adorable expression, Qin Yu could not help but smack her red lips.

And then he pulled her to his back.

“Stay behind me. Watch how I crush this trash.’

Qin Yu was tremendously overbearing when it came to Ruoxue.

“Yes.”

Yan Ruoxue responded like a mosquito and blushed like an apple. She never expected Qin Yu to kiss her in front of so many people.

“Sister, don’t let your imagination run wild. What do we do now?”

Looking at Ruoxue who covered her face using her hands, Chang Mang was on the verge of tears. Although he was also tremendously dissatisfied, these people before him were not to be trifled with! It was more important to find a way to leave!

“Go to hell!”

Hua Zhikong was so angry that he almost lost his mind. It was as if Qin Yu was the one who snatched Yan Ruoxue away.

Amidst the peak of summer, a spring breeze suddenly blew and the peach blossoms flourished.

All the peach blossoms in the sky suddenly turned into the most fatal killing intent.

In the sea of the Path of Heaven’s flower sea, a massive Soul Statue swallowed the terrifying power of rules and immediately surged into this peach-blossom world.

Instantly, various illusions appeared in Qin Yu’s mind as if they wanted to affect him and kill him silently.

“This illusion not only can’t affect me. With your sissy technique, what can you do if I stand still and let you do what you want?” Qin Yu laughed maniacally, and he let go of his hands.

“You’re courting death, b*stard!”

The boundless peach blossoms instantly turned into boundless killing intent and attacked from all directions like divine weapons.

The boundless peach blossom power struck Qin Yu’s body in less than a breath. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Terrifying tremors caused sand and stones to fly around the outer area of Thunder Courtyard.

“Just this? You d*mn sissy can’t even break my skin, and you’re talking about bloodline?”

Qin Yu slowly walked out from the boundless smoke and dust. The light of glass flickered on his body.

He patted the dust off his body and walked out with a faint smile.

“Don’t call me sissy!”

Hua Zhikong suddenly spat a mouthful of blood. He pointed at Qin Yu with trembling fingers.

Lei Qingye and the others sighed. They were tremendously dissatisfied with his performance.

“Why do I feel that Qin Yu is especially overbearing today?”

Chang Mang was dumbstruck.

“Maybe it’s because the old hen is protecting her chicks. Usually, this fellow doesn’t even let out a fart when bullied.” Jue Wu nodded in agreement.

On the other hand, Yan Ruoxue was still acting like a little woman. She was still covering her face.

“Foreseeings imminent disaster, one must resort to extreme measures. Qin Yu, as a member of Thunder Courtyard, you dared to attack Martial Uncle. No one can save you today.”

A Tribulation Transcending elder stepped forward..
