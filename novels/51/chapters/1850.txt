1851 Make You the Target

At this time, Qin Yu had returned to Demon-slaying Peak.

He sat in Chang Mang’s cave abode and seemed to be thinking of a countermeasure. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That group of people is a bunch of old fogeys. It’s obviously impossible for them to take action,” Chang Mang cursed.

“Brother, if it really doesn’t work, just the two of us will go. What’s there to be afraid of?” Chang Mang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said in righteous indignation.

“No,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice. “We must have a perfect plan before we move.”

“Then what do we do?” Chang Mang said with a frown.

Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said, “Demon-slaying Peak can’t take personal revenge. They can only get rid of evil people. We can make use of the rules of Demon-slaying Peak to make them take action.”

Chang Mang scratched his head. He was puzzled and said, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang and said coldly, “Since I can’t take personal revenge, I’ll turn the Tong family into evildoers!”

“Turn them into evildoers?” Chang Mang seemed to have come to a realization. His eyes lit up, and he said, “You’re quite cunning, kid!”

“I have no choice,” Qin Yu said coldly. “I can only rely on the power of Demon-slaying Peak.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang and said, “Chang Mang, I have to trouble you to look for the peak master and tell him that Qin Yu is inviting him and Jiu Xiao over as guests for a drink.”

“Alright. I’ll go now,” Chang Mang stood up and said.

After Chang Mang left, Qin Yu did what Jue Wu had done. He went into the forest, caught a few wild animals, and roasted them in Chang Mang’s cave abode.

After all, Qin Yu was an alchemist. His control of the fire naturally far surpassed Jue Wu’s.

In a short while, the fragrance of roasted meat filled the entire cave abode.

Soon, Jiu Xiao and the peak master arrived at the cave abode under Chang Mang’s invitation.

The moment he entered, the peak master sniffed and said with a smile, “What a nice smell! You guys really know how to enjoy life.”

Qin Yu stood up and greeted the peak master. He bowed and said, “Greetings, Peak Master.”

The peak master patted Qin Yu’s shoulder. He couldn’t wait to sit at the side, tore off a piece of meat, and stuffed it into his mouth.

“Mmm. Not bad, not bad. The taste is not bad!” the peak master said excitedly as he stuffed the meat into his mouth.

“I learned this from Jue Wu,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

When he mentioned Jue Wu, the atmosphere suddenly turned a bit depressing.

“Is there anything that you called us here?” Jiu Xiao asked.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. Then he nodded and said, “Yeah, there is.”

“Is it related to Jue Wu?” Jiu Xiao tried to ask.

Qin Yu didn’t hide it. He nodded and said, “Yes.”

The peak master, who was eating the meat, immediately stopped what he was doing when he heard this.

“Qin Yu, you’re not asking us to help you save her, are you?” he said with a grave expression. “If that’s the case, I’ll spit it out now.”

Upon hearing the peak master’s words, Chang Mang said in a very displeased manner, “F*ck! You’re a real coward. What are you afraid of?”

The peak master knew Chang Mang’s temper, so he didn’t argue with him. He only said in a deep voice, “This is the rule of Demon-slaying Peak. Since we are in Demon-slaying Peak, we should follow the rules.”

“Aren’t the rules still set by people? So what if you break the rules once?” Chang Mang said angrily.

“You’re right. However, the rules were set by the dean. If you’re not satisfied, you can go to the dean. If the dean agrees, we guarantee you we’ll go with you to save her without saying a word!” the peak master said unhappily.

Chang Mang opened his mouth and was about to speak when he was stopped by Qin Yu’s shout.

He looked at the peak master and said in a deep voice, “Peak Master, of course, I won’t break the rules of Demon-slaying Peak, nor will I make things difficult for you. I just want to ask you one thing today.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the peak master finally calmed down a little.

“Mmm,” he responded. “You may ask whatever you want.”

Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said, “What is considered an evildoer by Demon-slaying Peak? How to become the target of Demon-slaying Peak?”

“It’s very simple. Slaughtering living creatures unruly is considered one. However, this standard is very strict. Even Yuan Xiu of North Plains was not taken into account,” the peak master said.

Jiu Xiao seemed to have guessed Qin Yu’s intention.

He looked at Qin Yu and asked, “You want to make the Tong family the target of Demon-slaying Peak? ”

“Yes,” Qin Yu didn’t hide anything.

“This way, Demon-slaying Peak can attack the Tong family.”

The peak master was stunned. He then smacked his head and said, “That’s not a bad idea, but I’m afraid it won’t be that easy to do.”

“That’s why I want to know the qualifying criteria of evildoer at Demon-slaying Peak,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“Devouring the primordial spirits, does it count?” he asked the peak master.

“Devouring the primordial spirits… It also depends on the situation. Back then, Yuan Xiu relied on devouring primordial spirits to cultivate but he didn’t become the target of Demon-slaying Peak either,” the peak master said.

“Your idea is good, but it’s unethical,” Jiu Xiao said coldly.

“I don’t care anymore. To save Jue Wu, I will do anything,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Jiu Xiao said in a deep voice, “I know you are anxious to save Jue Wu, but it is not realistic for you to make the Tong family the target of Demon-slaying Peak in a short time. Usually, Demon-slaying Peak takes a long time to consider. The Tong family is not within the scope of consideration.”

Qin Yu frowned. As Jiu Xiao had said, this idea was indeed unrealistic.

“If… What if the targeted evildoers insisted on the Tong family?” Qin Yu raised his head and asked.

Upon hearing this, Jiu Xiao and the peak aster looked at each other, and a trace of confusion flashed in their eyes.

“This situation… It has never happened before,” the peak master frowned and said.

“That means it can be done,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He looked at Jiu Xiao and the peak master and said, “As long as it’s not clearly stated, it means there’s a possibility of success, right?”

The peak master frowned and said, “Theoretically speaking, it’s right. But… it seems to be taking advantage of a loophole.”

“I’m taking advantage of a loophole,” Qin Yu said without any hesitation.

“in short, I’m doing things according to the rules of Demon-slaying Peak. I’m not making things difficult for you, am I?” Qin Yu looked at the peak master and said.

“I’ll have to consider this matter,” the peak master said in a deep voice.

“No matter what your final answer is, I will still do it.” Qin Yu’s tone became extremely cold, and a trace of viciousness flashed through his eyes.

For a moment, the peak master was at a loss.

“Qin Yu is right,” Jiu Xiao said quietly. “As long as it’s not against the rules, it’s feasible.”

“Jue Wu was originally a member of our Demon-slaying Peak. I think this is reasonable. We can try.”

After hearing Jiu Xiao’s words, the peak master could not help but smile bitterly.

He looked at Qin Yu, sighed, and said, “I’ll try my best to help you.”
