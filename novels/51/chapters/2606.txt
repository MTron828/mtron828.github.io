Chapter 2607: Sudden Change of Circumstances

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi- Bo Studio

Light flashed across Li Yue’s hand. His expression did not change, so nothing unexpected happened.

At the same time, a distant cry and the sound of battle entered this underground passage. The tremors on the ground gradually became increasingly distinct.

“Wait a little longer. Don’t be anxious.”

Li Yue blocked Qin Yu, who was about to leap up.

He stared intensely at the chessboard in his hand, and his expression was a little ugly.

“We can’t wait any longer. These giant monsters are about to leave this place. Being here is like facing death, so we have to take action now to have a chance at survival.

At this moment, Qin Yu saw some more ogres enter, and the entire camp became a little chaotic.

If they dragged on, there would probably be more ogres here.

He immediately rushed out and slashed out with his saber, killing the three ogres in the surroundings.

After that, he charged toward another ogre. Ju Wuwei and the others followed closely behind. The nearly 20 ogres within a 50 -meter radius were instantly cleared.

“Clean up these corpses. If the giant ogres discover them, it might lead to unexpected consequences.”

Ju Wuwei said in a deep voice.

When he was fighting against the giant ogres, he realized that these giant ogres already had very high intelligence.

It might lead to many things if he left these corpses on the ground.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu suddenly thought of his Order of Rules, the giant ogre’s esophagus, and he had an idea.

The ground instantly became putrid, and the corpses slowly sank into it.

“Throw the corpses over here.”

After a while, the 50 or so ogres were all thrown in. As they did not summon the demon inside, the mental strength consumption was not that exaggerated.

He had only consumed about 10% of his mental strength. Coupled with the Spirit Recovery Pill, this consumption was still acceptable.

After dealing with these ogres, everyone went deeper in.

On the way, a few of them continued to advance cautiously, encountering some essential territories.

They recorded them using the mirror so that when they returned, it would all be military merits.

After dealing with a few giant ogres along the way, it was difficult to find any traces of these giant ogres further in.

In the distance, the shouts that attracted attention gradually faded. The soldiers who had left the city seemed to have returned.

The entire forest, which served as the habitat for the giant ogres, once again fell into a deathly silence. The only sound on the ground was the faint noise produced by their gradual movement.

However, at a distance of 30 meters, they were still considerably safe.

Suddenly, the candle in Li Yue’s hand began to tremble violently, and the flame was instantly compressed to the extreme.

A massive wave of consciousness surged over like water. When it arrived above them, the candle flame was suppressed to the extreme.

“It’s Seifer’s consciousness.”

At this moment, the consciousness stopped above as if it had discovered something was wrong. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze stared fixedly at the candle flame. At this moment, the flame was almost invisible.

“Pfft!”

Li Yue took out another candle and lit it up. After lighting the second Spirit Candle, the flame stabilized.

The internal qi of the two candles seeped into everyone’s bodies. After exhaling, everyone’s bodies more or less carried a stench.

After a few seconds, the consciousness left like flowing water.

“What a terrifying internal qi! This kind of power of the soul only needs a moment to crush us. Can we defeat this enemy?”

Liu Da said with a bitter smile.

“Moreover, there’s bad news.

Li Yue’s expression was also very ugly.

At this moment, the noise of a massive tremor came from the depths of the forest. In less than ten minutes, the sounds of battle had completely stopped.

“They must have discovered a scout team. Even the elites of the commando team can only hold on for ten minutes?”

These elites were more potent than all of them.

If even they could only hold on for such a short time, it would be difficult to escape once they were discovered. “Li Yue, how long can the candle last?”

Qin Yu asked softly.

“If that terrifying consciousness doesn’t probe again, it should be half an hour. However, if that divine sense were to sweep out again, I’m afraid the time would be compressed to less than twenty minutes.”

Li Yue looked at the candle in his hand and said again.

“In that case, we will advance at maximum speed from now on. Along the way, we will record key coordinates and arrangements of these armies. No matter what, we will return using the same way after fifteen minutes.”

Qin Yu said to everyone. “What if we encounter the giant ogre army?”

Fang Xiang asked.

“If you encounter a small necromancy army, kill them as quickly as possible. If you encounter a large necromancy army, retreat immediately. The most important thing is to return alive.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice. He also wanted to take this opportunity to obtain enough military merits. However, if he died and could not return, everything would be empty talk.

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone paid their full attention.

Qin Yu was using his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze to do his best to avoid the surrounding necromancy army.

The others also recorded the coordinates of each location.

The mirror was like a video recorder that could record all the coordinates of the surrounding scene.

Moreover, the mirror also absorbed the internal qi of countless necromancy armies. It looked a bit like Li Yue’s chessboard.

Suddenly, with the sound of another battle cry, the crowd’s expressions changed drastically.

Another team was discovered. It should be the team in the middle which had many outsiders.

“Don’t bother about it. Continue moving forward.”

Qin Yu increased his speed again.

Besides ogres and giant ogres in Seifer’s army, Qin Yu discovered another army as they went in deeper.

About 1,000 meters away from them, the burning firewood illuminated the entire sky.

The ogre’s voice kept coming from the deep forest. Qin Yu and the others walked in to observe.

The place had an overwhelming stench of decay as countless ogres dragged corpses, slowly walking into the area illuminated by the firelight.

After that, they dumped the corpses into a large dark-green pool. At this moment, the large pool was emitting sticky bubbles.

As the corpses were continuously dumped in, enormous bubbles kept popping up.

After reaching a specific level, the bubbles suddenly shattered, and a rotten black dragon appeared.

The black dragon was the size of five ogres.

“What the f*ck is there to fight!”

Fang Xiang’s face was ashen. This black dragon was enough to wipe them out.

Moreover, looking at the endless ogre army, there would probably be many black dragons..
