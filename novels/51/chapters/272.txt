Chapter 273: Chaotic Body vs Holy Body Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s words instantly angered Hui Ming.

His expression turned cold, and a murderous aura emanated.

“You shameless thing, do you really think I’m afraid of you?!” Dark energy surged around Hui Ming’s body, and rays of black light shot out from his dantian.

The entire canyon was enveloped by an ominous internal qi.

This internal qi was extremely powerful. Even Jiang Gu was a little afraid of it.

“Qin Yu, you have repeatedly spoiled the Earth Fiend Valley’s plans. If I don’t kill you today, you will become the Valley Master of the Earth Fiend Valley!”

Hui Ming roared repeatedly as the rays of light in his dantian flowed towards the corpse in the middle of the room! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Everyone, sacrifice yourselves for the revival of the Earth Fiend Valley!” Hui Ming roared again!

He raised his palm!

In an instant, the faces of the eight elders contorted, and the internal qi in their dantian was forcefully sucked out!

“You...” The elders looked at Hui Ming with great pain and difficulty.

Hui Ming laughed coldly, “It is your honor to give up your lives for the Earth Fiend Valley.”

As he spoke, the internal qi of the eight elders was completely sucked out!

At this moment, a human figure flew out from between Hui Ming’s brows!

The human figure dashed towards the holy body at an extremely fast speed!

“Mr. Qin, this is bad! We can’t let him complete the possession!” Jiang Gu shouted anxiously.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He had already seen through Hui Ming’s intentions, but it was already too late for him to make a move now.

“That body... isn’t as simple as it seems.” Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered in a low voice.

However, he didn’t feel any fear. Instead, he was excited!

Ever since he embarked on the path of cultivation, Qin Yu hadn’t met anyone stronger than him!

This holy body in front of him might be one of them!

“Come, let me experience the might of this so-called holy body.” Qin Yu’s feet shook, and waves of golden light burst out from his body!

The light enveloped him, and at a glance, he looked as if he was wearing golden armor!

The male corpse in the center of the array platform was enveloped by the black energy, and crackling sounds could be heard from within.

“Boom!”

Not long after, the center of the array platform burst out with a huge tremor!

The entire canyon was shaking so loudly that even the dungeons far away were affected by the internal qi!

“What’s going on?” Cheng Cai and Tang Ling, who were following closely behind, couldn’t help but change their expressions.

They looked into the distance and their eyes were filled with shock.

“Someone must be fighting. Quick, we mustn’t miss this opportunity!” Cheng Cai said excitedly.

...

The array platform was completely shattered by this internal qi! The darkness also disappeared in an instant!

The corpse lying in the center of the array platform slowly rose up.

An awe-inspiring aura emanated, and it made people feel a sense of worship!

This kind of pressure seemed to come from an innate sort of suppression. Even if one was powerful, they wouldn’t be able to resist it.

Even Jiang Gu’s legs trembled!

“What a powerful pressure.” Qin Yu looked at Hui Ming, who had completed the possession, and murmured in a low voice.

Hui Ming slowly walked toward Qin Yu from the center of the array.

Although there was no light covering his body, one could tell at a glance that his body was extraordinary.

“How wonderful...” Hui Ming licked his lips and lowered his head to look at his body.

Hui Ming seemed to enjoy this unprecedented power.

“I originally planned to use it to resurrect the ancestor, but now, it seems that there’s no need.” Hui Ming sneered.

He looked at Qin Yu and said with a gloomy tone, “Speaking of which, I have to thank you. It is really a pity to give such a good body to someone else.”

Qin Yu sneered. “This is the holy body? It’s so-so.”

“Hahahaha!” Hui Ming raised his head and laughed loudly.

His laughter was deafening.

“Although the holy body isn’t as good as the chaotic body, the difference isn’t big.” Hui Ming grinned and said with a cold smile.

“This body had reached the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm when it was alive. Qin Yu, how dare you toy with me?!” Hui Ming shouted, and the surging inner strength immediately forced its way over!

“Puff!”

Jiang Gu couldn’t withstand this pressure, and he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood!

Qin Yu also felt that his chest seemed to be suffocated by something, and he felt a little uncomfortable.

“This holy body is indeed extraordinary,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Fortunately, he didn’t let the stone statue fall into Hui Ming’s hands. If the ancestor was resurrected, he would be in trouble.

“Qin Yu, I can’t wait to experience this body! Hahahaha!” Hui Ming raised his head and laughed loudly. The inner strength in his entire body seemed to be boiling!

Following that, Hui Ming took a step forward, and his powerful fist headed straight for Qin Yu’s body!

“Clang!”

Qin Yu didn’t dodge. He clenched his fist to meet the fist!

“Rumble!”

The collision of the two fists caused an explosion in the air!

The entire Earth Fiend Valley couldn’t withstand it anymore and began to collapse at this moment!

“As expected of a holy body!” Qin Yu’s pupils dilated and he felt invigorated!

This was the first time Qin Yu had met someone that could face his hard steel body head-on!

Hui Ming also licked his lips and grinned. “The chaotic body is indeed worthy of its reputation. Unfortunately... you will definitely die here today!”

As he spoke, Hui Ming rushed over again!

The two sides engaged in an unprecedented melee!

The fist-to-fist combat caused a big ruckus at the scene!

The clanging sounds were incessant!

Jiang Gu, who wasn’t far away, gritted his teeth. He formed a spell with his hands in an attempt to help Qin Yu.

Countless streams of inner strength turned into raindrops and headed straight for Hui Ming.

However, what was shocking was that Jiang Gu’s attack was completely ineffective! It wasn’t even able to scrape Hui Ming’s skin!

“How is this possible?!” Jiang Gu’s expression turned extremely ugly!

Hui Ming’s physical body was actually that strong?

Qin Yu was fighting against such a powerful freak in close combat?

This was beyond Jiang Gu’s understanding!

“Boom!”

Hui Ming let out an angry roar. The force exerted by his fist increased and smashed onto Qin Yu’s chest fiercely!

Qin Yu’s body was instantly sent flying through the mountain rocks!

“Hahahaha! This is the power! This is the power!” Hui Ming shouted excitedly, and he was in an extremely good mood!

Qin Yu crawled out from the rubble. He lowered his head and looked at his fist. His face revealed a grave expression.

‘The toughness of this holy body is even stronger than mine,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

The holy body was, after all, a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster when it was alive, and its realm was much higher than Qin Yu’s.

If not for the fact that Qin Yu had tempered his body over 500 times, he might have really died here.

“Swoosh!”

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, Hui Ming charged forward again!

The two sides didn’t make any flamboyant moves, and simply exchanged punches and kicks!

“Clang! Clang!”

Every punch made the surroundings shake. No one could interfere in the battle between the two sides!

“What... What is that? How powerful...” Cheng Cai, who had rushed to the scene, couldn’t help but look at the sky in shock.

“It seems to be Qin Yu,” Tang Ling said in surprise.
