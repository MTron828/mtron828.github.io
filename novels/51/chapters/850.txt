Chapter 851: Chapter 851, the critical moment of the breakthrough

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association immediately launched a carpet-like search for Qin Yu.

At this time, Qin Yu had already been in closed-door cultivation for several days.

The internal Qi in his body was rapidly rising. After Qin Yu swallowed 48 Golden Cores, Qin Yu finally felt that he had reached the critical point of the breakthrough.

“It seems that I am about to step into the Great Circle,”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

Qin Yu did not dare to delay any longer. He closed his eyes slightly and swallowed another golden core.

Under the effect of this golden core, Qin Yu’s internal Qi began to soar! It seemed that he was only a step away from the perfect realm!

At this time, Uncle Guan had already arrived at the entrance of the secret realm.

He looked at the entrance coldly and then placed his hand in the air in front of him.

Rays of light began to light up. In front of him, an entrance slowly appeared.

“Is this the Qing City’s secret realm?”The young man beside Uncle Guan asked in puzzlement.

Uncle Guan did not say anything. He strode into the secret realm.

The young man did not dare to waste any time and hurriedly followed them in.

The moment the two of them entered the secret realm, Qin Yu noticed their figures.

“So Fast?”Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change.

He had long expected that this mystic realm would be discovered sooner or later, but he did not expect it to be so fast!

Right now was an important moment for Qin Yu’s breakthrough. He absolutely could not be disturbed.

If he was discovered, all his previous efforts would be in vain!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly, and his state of mind was also greatly disturbed.

“No, if my state of mind continues, I’m afraid I’ll fail this time!”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He took a deep breath and forced himself to stabilize his state of mind, trying his best not to let his imagination run wild.

In the outside world, Uncle Guan was already striding towards this house.

Right at this moment, Su Qian noticed Uncle Guan who had rushed over.

She hurriedly walked forward and said, “You are?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The young man beside uncle Guan immediately shouted, “This is an elder of our Hong Yi sect! Uncle Guan!”

“An elder of the Hong Yi Sect?”Su Qian’s expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

“Who are you? Why did you appear in the secret realm of the Hong Yi Sect?”The young man asked coldly.

Su Qian hurriedly replied, “I am also a member of the Hong Yi sect. I serve under Ning Kun and pay my respects to Uncle Guan.”

“A member of the Hong Yi Sect?”Uncle Guan frowned slightly. There seemed to be some doubt on his face.

Su Qian hurriedly put his hand into his bag and took out a token.

This token was the Hong Yi sect’s token.

Uncle Guan took the token and glanced at it. He said in a low voice, “It really is a member of the Hong Yi sect.”

“Didn’t Qin Yu kill all the people in the mystic realm? How are you still alive?”Uncle Guan said coldly.

Su Qian hurriedly explained, “Because I’ve only joined for a short time, I rarely step into the mystical realm.”

Uncle Guan was too lazy to talk nonsense with Su Qian. He waved his hand and said, “What About Qin Yu?”

Su Qian braced himself and said, “Uncle Guan, Qin Yu is not here...”

“Not here?”Uncle Guan frowned slightly.

“Didn’t Zheng Ke say that he was in seclusion here? Also, where is Zheng Ke?”

“AH... in answer to Uncle Guan, the news that Zheng Ke reported to you was discovered by Qin Yu, so he was killed by Qin Yu,”Su Qian braced himself and lied.

“Therefore, for the sake of safety, Qin Yu didn’t go into seclusion here. Instead, he went to the immortal slaying sect.”

Uncle Guan looked at Su Qian with suspicion. Obviously, he didn’t believe Su Qian’s words.

“Uncle Guan, if you don’t believe me, I can take you to see Zheng Ke’s body!”Su Qian said hurriedly.

“Take us there quickly!”The young man beside Uncle Guan shouted.

Su Qian did not dare to say anything. He quickly brought the two of them to Zheng Ke’s body.

Looking at Zheng Ke lying on the ground, uncle Guan could not help but say coldly, “It took the Hong family several years to nurture a mystic realm master. Qin Yu actually killed him!”

“Not only did he die, but he also let Qin Yu know that we are coming.”The young man beside Uncle Guan could not help but curse.

Su Qian quickly continued, “Uncle Guan, Zheng Ke said before he died that he wanted me to pick you up here. He asked me to tell you about Qin Yu going to the immortal slaying sect.”

Uncle Guan took a deep breath and said coldly, “Let’s go to the immortal slaying sect!”

“Yes!”

The two of them turned around and left the mystic realm.

Watching the two of them leave, Su Qian also let out a long sigh of relief.

She walked to Qin Yu’s door and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, you have to hurry up. If they can’t find anyone in the immortal slaying sect, they will definitely come back...”

In the room, Qin Yu was trying his best to break through.

The internal Qi on his body was rising rapidly, and his body was emitting light from all parts of his body.

To Qin Yu, every breakthrough was a qualitative change!

The gap between the perfect stage and the peak of the Martial Marquis realm was even greater!

Qin Yu even believed that as long as he entered the perfect stage, he would not be afraid of a half-step martial saint!

If he entered the half-step martial saint realm, then Qin Yu would not be afraid of anyone in the world!

Su Qian stood outside the door and looked at the rays of light emitting from the room. He could not help but feel secretly happy.

“This scene should be the precursor to a breakthrough!”Su Qian said in a low voice.

But at this moment, the entrance of the Mystic Realm opened again!

Turning around, he saw Uncle Guan and the young man had actually turned back!

Su Qian’s expression immediately changed, and a trace of shock flashed through his heart.

“Uncle Guan, you... Why Did you come back?”Su Qian suppressed the fear in his heart and braced himself to ask.

Uncle Guan narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu must have been there before Zheng Ke died. If that’s the case, why didn’t he kill you?”

Su Qian’s expression changed drastically! He knew something was wrong!

“Because... because Qin Yu left in a hurry, so...”Su Qian tried to explain.

But the young man beside uncle Guan interrupted Su Qian.

“Uncle Guan, Qin Yu is in this room!”The young man shouted.

Uncle Guan glanced at the light in the room and couldn’t help but look at Su Qian coldly. He said, “Do you know the consequences of betraying the Hong Family?”

Su Qian’s face instantly turned ashen, as pale as paper.

The fear in her heart made her shiver all over.

“Uncle Guan, i...”

“Bang!”

Before Su Qian could finish his sentence, Uncle Guan had already sent out a palm strike!

This palm strike landed squarely on Su Qian’s chest! The tremendous force directly shattered Su Qian’s sternum!

“Anyone who betrays the Hong Clan Must Die!”Uncle Guan said coldly.
