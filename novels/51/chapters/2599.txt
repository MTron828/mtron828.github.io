Chapter 2600: Say Thank You

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

It was equivalent to protecting his life. It did not matter if it was ten times or twenty times.

If he encountered a fatal attack, it was because the enemy’s strength was far superior to his. To be able to survive was the most important. It was equivalent to having another life besides the Seal of Heaven Returning.

However, he did not know the interval to use it the second time. Qin Yu turned the hat into transparent and felt much more comfortable.

“You’ve selected the reward. Leave the warehouse immediately and prepare for the next stage of the battle. Wait for further notice in the city.”

Seeing that Qin Yu had already chosen his reward, the soldier said coldly.

“Brother, can I ask you something?”

Qin Yu rubbed his head. It seemed to be similar to what happened in the first village.

Once he selected the reward, the people would no longer pay attention to him.

If he had known it earlier, he would have asked who was imprisoned in the dungeon of Nine Tune City.

Qin Yu took the opportunity to go around the city.

As he walked on the streets in the city, the smell of burning paper permeated through the streets and alleys.

In front of that dim doorway, an elderly woman with white hair was fervently burning joss money in front of the sick room.

A young woman was carrying the children and coaxing them softly while the children were crying hoarsely.

Someone even held the soldier’s arm and confirmed the news of death with trembling hands.

These people were the family members of the soldiers who had died this time. Qin Yu almost could not breathe as he walked along the way.

These were the living people! Even if they derived from this Saint Kingdom, they were still living people.

Just like the ancestors of the Earth and the Holy Region, who could say they were just sentient living beings that derived from there?

Almost every dead person had a family behind them.

Looking at the pairs of lifeless eyes, Qin Yu almost suffocated that he could not catch his breath.

It seems that the outsiders had affected the balance of this region. He heard some soldiers talking about it earlier, and now, he could confirm it judging from their expressions.

Two familiar figures appeared in front of him.

They were Shen Qian and Li Yu.

Shen Qian’s eyes were red and seemed to have just cried.

The disciples of the three Daoist sects emphasized emotions. She probably had witnessed the situation in the city. “Brother Qin Yu.”

Li Yu cupped his fists at Qin Yu. “Brother Qin Yu, can we help them guard this city?”

Shen Qian sobbed and said.

“I wish I could, but our strength appears insignificant in this confrontation. A spell from the monster race army nearly destroyed me outright.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

“Fortunately, we were not sent to the west gate. Otherwise, we definitely could not escape this calamity. Brother Qin Yu, I have something to tell you. You mustn’t leave this place. Otherwise, you will be shot dead immediately. Junior Brother Jiang Wu thought that not many soldiers were stationed at the west gate, and he sensed the terrifying technique fluctuations on your side. Therefore, he wanted to take advantage of the chaos to sneak away.” Li Yu reminded softly.

Qin Yu nodded. The order in this Saint Kingdom seemed to adhere to strict rules. They must be followed, or else one would undoubtedly face catastrophic consequences.

Just like the village chief, even if he had formidable strength, he still could not help when the people in his tribe were slaughtered.

However, whether it was him or Shen Qian, both felt extreme despair.

Although the scale of the battle at the north gate was not big, they could still see the dark monster race army beside them. How could this small city withstand it?

“You guys go and rest first. The next battle will be here soon.”

“Yes! No matter what, I will do my best. Even if I die, I will drag a few more demonic beasts to hell!”

Shen Qian’s gaze was much more determined instead.

When she saw those crying children, she seemed to have seen the tragic sect war in the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect. Those children who lived there were just as helpless as the children here now.

Just as they were about to part ways, the sobbing around them suddenly stopped.

The original low sobbing sounds turned into eerie silence, and the people stopped weeping. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

They looked at Qin Yu and the others expressionlessly. The pupils in their eyes had strangely disappeared. They looked tremendously terrifying.

After that, they surrounded the alleyway in unison and rushed toward Qin Yu and the others.

“Someone seemed to have controlled them.”

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and asked. Could it be that Seifer’s power could penetrate the city?

“Don’t attack!”

Qin Yu shouted at Li Yu. At this moment, a commoner rushed over and frightened Li Yu.

He directly used a short knife to chop off the arm of the commoner who had grabbed his wrist!

“Pfft!”

As the blood spurted out, Li Yu’s body disappeared into the air as if being wiped away!

Qin Yu was scared out of his wits. It was this power of order again.

Previously, this power had wiped out the village when he controlled Hua Qianjie to the limit.

“Senior Brother?”

Shen Qian called out anxiously. She still did not understand why Li Yu had suddenly disappeared.

“Don’t attack, Shen Qian! Even if these commoners are controlled, their strength is not enough to kill us. Once we attack, we will suffer a backlash.” Qin Yu hurriedly reminded her again.

“Hehehe, you’re quite smart, Kid. Unfortunately, you’re bound to die on the human race’s side. I’m afraid General Li Liefei can’t make more moves.” An old man tilted his head, his neck making the sound of bones cracking.

“It’s none of your business. Attack if you have the ability.” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Don’t be so arrogant. You were just lucky to escape last time.”

A dry and hoarse voice came from the other woman’s abdomen. The voice was a little muffled and did not come from her mouth.

“I’m giving you an option now. Submit and become an inside agent within my monster race. I can grant you power tenfold what you have now and let you master an Undead Rules. Or, face death.”

“Do you think I’m an idiot? Once I attack the people in the city, I will immediately suffer a backlash. Didn’t you want to do that just now?”

“Hehehe, you can’t even handle the simplest order. Such useless trash! If you die, you die. Since I make you backlash against the human race, I’ll naturally protect your soul. I’m sure you’ve already seen my power.”

A child walked up to Qin Yu and extended his hand.

He extended a pale bone claw in his small palm, and an obscure power fluctuated on the bone claw.

“Hold my hand, and you will receive my power. Then, say thank you.”

The child revealed a creepy smile.

“I’ll thank your mother! Go eat sh*t, old fact!” ‘

Qin Yu immediately cursed. He pulled Shen Qian aside and pushed the people in front of them away, leaving the street far away..
