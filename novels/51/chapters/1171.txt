Chapter 1172: Chapter 1,172, the worries of the higher-ups 

Even though Gu Xinghe shouted at the top of his lungs, Qin Yu no longer paid any attention to him.

He returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

At this moment, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was already in ruins.

Qin Yu carried Zhai Xing’s corpse and went to the back mountain.

He had built a tomb for Zhai Xing, and the name of Zhai Xing was engraved on the tombstone.

There was a bit of desolation on the back mountain. Qin Yu looked at Zhai Xing’s tomb and felt a myriad of emotions in his heart.

Along the way, how many people around him would leave, and how many people would make it to the end.

“Zhai Xing has never done any bad things in his life,”pavilion master said in a low voice from the side.

Qin Yu did not make a sound.

This world had never been judged by good or bad. Who knew how many evil people were unfettered in the clouds, and who knew how many kind-hearted people had died an unnatural death.

The world of cultivators was even more cruel. Perhaps today, they would drink together, and tomorrow, they would turn into a pile of dirt.

“Let’s go.”

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He turned around and returned to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Everyone was extremely curious about Qin Yu’s current combat strength.

“Qin Yu, your realm clearly hasn’t improved at all. Why is your strength...”Yao Meng was the most surprised.

“Could it be because of your special physique?”Xiao Yuan continued.

Qin Yu shook his head: “None of them.”

“It’s the blood of Miss Yan.”Yan Yongfu walked out like a dog.

At this moment, how could he still have the elegance he had when he entered the human realm? He was just like a dog licking.

Ever since he saw Qin Yu’s unparalleled combat strength, Yan Yongfu had long stopped wanting to get rid of Qin Yu. He even wanted to follow Qin Yu into the Holy Region.

The other people in the room looked at Yan Yongfu strangely. The entire room was filled with a sense of uneasiness.

“Yan Yongfu, do you know the origin of that Iron Rod?”Qin Yu suddenly remembered this matter. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yan Yongfu shook his head and said: “I don’t know, but I am sure that this is an item from Earth.”

“Such a divine weapon should have been given to the eight of us. Clearly, Gu Zizhen left it behind.”

Qin Yu took out the iron rod. The Iron Rod was still covered in rust and no longer had any internal Qi flowing through it. However, it was ridiculously hard.

According to the mustache, the painting was the mask woman’s.

Since the iron rod could activate the painting and resurrect itself, its origin must be no weaker than the painting.

However... Since even Yan Yongfu didn’t know the origin of this item, then not many people in the world would know.

“Oh right, according to the time that Tianjizi said, how long will it take for the Holy Region to open?”Qin Yu suddenly thought of it.

When Tianjizi was mentioned, Yao Meng’s expression didn’t look too good.

“What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Yao Meng sighed and said, “Tianjizi died too. He was killed by Gu Xinghe.”

This surprised Qin Yu greatly.

“Tianjizi’s divine plan, how could he not escape this calamity?”Qin Yu exclaimed.

Yao Meng shook her head and said, “To Tianjizi, everything is predestined.”

Qin Yu fell into silence.

He never thought that Gu Xinghe would actually kill Tianjizi as well.

“According to the time Tianjizi gave us, in less than ten days, there will be people from the Holy Region coming to extradite him,”Yao Meng said.

“Ten days...”

Qin Yu muttered softly.

In these ten days, Qin Yu should consider finishing the things that he couldn’t finish.

In the next few days, Qin Yu made a list of things that Qin Yu had promised others for a long time.

This list included the matters of Fang Yue, Yu Qin, and Li Yu, who had been sleeping.

These things had been delayed for too long. Before he left, he had to deal with them properly.

Three days later, Gu Xinghe and the others were officially sentenced. The lowest point was set at the martial arts school.

On this day, there were many people at the martial arts school. Many people hated Gu Xinghe to the extreme.

There were soldiers with guns and live ammunition stationed at the scene. There were also many warriors serving in the military district.

Qin Yu arrived at the scene of the martial arts school according to the agreement.

As soon as he arrived, ye Qing walked over quickly.

“Qin Yu, a seat has been prepared for you there.”Ye Qing pointed at the high platform not far away.

On the high platform, there were many men wearing Chinese tunic suits, including Mr. Zhou. Obviously, that was the position of the leader.

“I’ll just find a place.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Ye Qing said in a deep voice, “No, this is Mr. Zhou’s request.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “Alright then.”

He followed ye Qing’s request and walked to the seat next to Mr. Zhou and sat down.

“Mr. Zhou.”Qin Yu greeted him.

Mr. Zhou said with a kind expression, “Qin Yu, this matter is all thanks to you. If it weren’t for you, I don’t know how many people would have been harmed by Gu Xinghe.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “This matter started because of me.”

“Eh, you can’t say that. Neither of us can decide what others will do,”Mr. Zhou said with a smile.

Qin Yu smiled but didn’t say anything. Mr. Zhou obviously had a hidden meaning.

“I heard that you’re the number one person in the martial arts world. You’re invulnerable to all weapons. Even Gu Xinghe could only take a few moves from you,”Mr. Zhou continued.

“How is it? What are your plans next? To replace Gu Xinghe? To become the new President?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Zhou, I know what you are thinking. I believe that you don’t want me to be the sole leader.”

Hearing this, Mr. Zhou hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Qin Yu, you are thinking too much.”

Qin Yu ignored these words and continued, “My ambition is not here. I am also not interested in the president of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu. The holy region will open immediately. That is my final destination.”

“As for the President of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu, you can support a new one yourself. One... at least you can control.”

Mr. Zhou was about to speak when a shout suddenly came from below.

Looking down, he saw Gu Xinghe and Su Qi already tied up.
