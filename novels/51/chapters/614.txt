The man with the mustache held a bowl in his hand and then handed Qin Yu a pestle.

He waved his hand and said, “Let’s go, we can set off now!”

Qin Yu couldn’t wait any longer. He followed beside the man with the mustache and strode forward.

After taking a few steps forward, the man with the mustache took out a glittering golden plate. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The plate was also engraved with dense runes, making it look extremely strange and mystical.

Qin Yu asked in puzzlement, “What is this thing?”

The mustached man said with affection, “This is a divine artifact specially used for archaeology. If it weren’t for this, I wouldn’t have been able to get so many treasures.”

“An archaeology divine artifact?” Qin Yu scratched his head.

“Where did you get it?”

The man with the mustache said with some pride, “This is something I made myself. I named it the Divine Plate.”

“You made it yourself?”

This made Qin Yu somewhat surprised.

This man with the mustache was indeed not as simple as he looked!

“Alright, I won’t say much. Let’s go. Follow me closely,” said the man with the mustache.

Qin Yu knew that the man with the mustache was an expert in this area, so he didn’t dare to say anything more and followed behind the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache held the bowl in one hand and the Divine Plate in the other.

His steps were extremely slow, and he had to lower his head to look at the Divine Plate in his hand with every step he took.

There were densely packed characters on the Divine Plate, and these characters seemed to represent the direction.

The two of them took a few hundred steps forward, and suddenly, a character on the Divine Plate flickered with light.

“There really is a treasure!” The man with the mustache’s eyes instantly lit up!

He looked in the direction the Divine Plate was pointing at and pulled Qin Yu along as he strode forward.

The light on the character grew brighter and brighter until they arrived in front of a stone tablet. The mustached man stopped in his tracks.

“According to the direction indicated on the Divine Plate, this is the place,” the mustached man said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu swept his gaze over and discovered that there was nothing else in the surroundings other than this stone tablet.

And this stone tablet didn’t seem to be placed here on purpose. Instead, it seemed to be formed by a broken wall inserted into the ground by chance.

The man with the mustache looked around. He lay on the ground and sniffed, then ran to the stone tablet and looked at it carefully.

“Break this stone tablet,” the man with the mustache said.

Qin Yu nodded. He immediately threw a punch, and the stone tablet shattered.

After he shattered the stone stele, there were no changes to the scene, nor did any treasures appear.

“Not here.” The man with the mustache frowned slightly.

He lay on the ground and carefully observed it for a moment, then took out a tool and began to inscribe dao talismans on the ground.

After he busied himself for a while, no treasures appeared.

“Strange.” The man with the mustache stroked his beard while frowning slightly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask, “Is your Divine Plate reliable or not?”

The man with the mustache glared at Qin Yu and said, “You are doubting my professional ability! This Divine Plate has never made a mistake!”

After saying that, the man with the mustache took out a piece of paper from his pocket and began to carve on the ground.

A few minutes later, the man with the mustache bit his finger and took out a ball of white ash-like powder, and sprinkled it on the white paper.

“Buzz!”

The moment the ash fell, it turned into flames!

The blue flames scattered in all directions. There were nine of them.

The man with the mustache stared at the flames. After a few seconds, his expression suddenly changed.

“Oh no!” The man with the mustache’s face instantly turned pale. In the next second, he hid behind Qin Yu!

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu said with some doubt.

The mustached man said in a deep voice, “According to my experience, this is the omen of a Zombie Transformation!”

“Zombie Transformation?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel like laughing.

“I’m starting to doubt your ability now.” Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

However, before Qin Yu could say anything, he suddenly felt a gust of cold wind behind him!

Turning around, Qin Yu saw a headless brawny man smashing his fist at him!

“Boom!”

This punch was extremely powerful. Even Qin Yu was sent flying, and his nose was bleeding non-stop!

Qin Yu got up from the ground. Looking at the headless brawny man in front of him, he couldn’t help but exclaim, “What is this?”

The mustached man rolled his eyes and said, “I told you, this is the scene of a Zombie Transformation. Don’t forget where you are! This is the Immortal Slaying Sect!”

“The members of the Immortal Slaying Sect were all Mighty Realm powerhouses. Even if they die, their fleshly bodies can still be living beings.”

Looking at the headless brawny man in front of him, Qin Yu said somewhat warily, “In other words... this person is very likely to be the body of a Mighty Realm powerhouse?”

“That’s right.” The man with the mustache nodded slightly.

“The spell I used just now was used to attract treasures, but it’s also possible to summon such a thing.” The man with the mustache said as though it was a matter of fact.

Qin Yu frowned tightly.

A Mighty Realm powerhouse’s physical body? How powerful would his physical body be?

“What should we do next?” Qin Yu asked warily as he retreated.

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes. “What else can we do? Of course, it’s up to you. I don’t know how to fight and kill.”

Without waiting for Qin Yu to speak, the headless brawny man had already charged toward Qin Yu!

His speed was extremely fast, and his physical body was incomparably fierce, practically shattering the void!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He hurriedly used his Saintly Body Technique to protect his body, and then sent a direct punch forward.

“Boom!”

A wave of air exploded between the two of them!

This wave of air sent the man with the mustache flying, and Qin Yu suffered an even more devastating punch. His entire body flew back nearly a hundred meters, and the bones in his hands were even shattered!

“What a powerful body!” Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change drastically!

As expected of a Mighty Realm powerhouse’s body. Even after so many years, it was still so powerful!

One had to know that Qin Yu was known as the chaotic body with the strongest constitution!

If it had been any other Martial Marquis, this punch would probably have shattered his body!

“I’ll be relying on you from now on. I trust you.” The mustached man ran a few hundred meters in a flash and said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He looked at the headless brawny man in front of him vigilantly.

He adjusted his internal qi to the maximum, and his pair of iron fists flickered with golden light.

“A body without a soul can only rely on the body to fight.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“So... I still have a chance to win against him!”

After saying that, Qin Yu silently chanted a spell, and a golden light condensed on his fists.

Right at this moment, the headless brawny man had already charged toward Qin Yu!

Although he had already lost his soul, his speed was still extremely fast just by relying on his physical body!

“Come, let me see just how powerful a Mighty Realm powerhouse’s body is!” Qin Yu roared angrily, and then thrust both fists!

A resplendent golden light instantly charged towards the headless brawny man!
