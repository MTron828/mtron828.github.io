1926 Saint Weapon Ores

Seeing they leave, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

He looked at the mine in front of him, and a beam of golden light burst out of his eyes.

The golden light spread out and completely enveloped the entire mine.

According to the memories left behind by his father, the hidden treasure was kept underneath the mine. However, there was no so-called entrance to the mine at first glance.

!!

Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said in a low voice, “Could it be that the hidden treasure was buried underneath this mine?”

According to the memories in his mind, the area in front of him should be where the hidden treasure was.

However, under the probing of the desolate divine eye, he could not see anything at all. He could only see some worthless ores.

The slightly larger aristocratic families would not be interested in these ores, so Qin Yu naturally would not be interested in them either.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu’s body floated into the air.

His palm burst with an extremely bright light,as if a full moon had grown out of his palm.

Then Qin Yu pressed downward suddenly, and the light exploded instantly below!

“Boom!”

The deafening sound was earth-shattering, almost overturning the entire mine. A huge pit appeared on the ground, and the ores in the pit completely melted under Qin Yu’s palm strike!

The terrifying sound spread from the mine to the surroundings!

Yue Lingdong and the others, who were escaping, were instantly stunned by this loud sound.

“Chief Steward, this sound… seems to be from the mine,” someone said in a deep voice.

Yue Lingdong remained silent. His face was gloomy, and no one knew what he was thinking.

As the Yue family’s steward, his mind was naturally incredibly meticulous. Although his strength could not be considered top-notch, his control over his thoughts was exceptionally precise.

“That kid is definitely not a rogue cultivator. I’m afraid he’s from an aristocratic family,” Yue Lingdong said in a deep voice.

“This mine has been deserted for a long time. As the son of an aristocratic family, why did he suddenly appear in a place like this and mix with a bunch of worthless people?”

Everyone suddenly understood what Yue Lingdong meant. They looked at each other and said in shock, “You’re saying… There’s something he wants around the mine?”

“It must be!” Yue Lingdong said coldly.

“But… That kid doesn’t seem easy to deal with,” the cultivator beside him said with a hint of fear.

Yue Lingdong squinted his eyes and sneered. “Relying solely on our Yue family, I’m afraid we can’t touch him. But I can report the news to the City Lord. This way, at least, we can share some benefits!”

At the thought of this, Yue Lingdong immediately ordered, “You guys go back and watch him in the dark. I’ll report this news to the City Lord now.”

“Yes!”

…

Qin Yu had no idea about this. After he destroyed the mine in front of him, he finally noticed something unusual with his desolate divine eye.

An extremely gloomy light was flickering underneath the mine.

Although the light was not eye-catching, it seemed to cause the surrounding laws of heaven and earth to tremble slightly.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to take further action for fear of damaging the treasures underneath.

Therefore, he just relied on his hands and carefully watched and dug the mine in front of him.

As Qin Yu dug deeper, the treasure underneath the mine began to show up, and the dark light became even more dazzling.

Qin Yu didn’t stop his hands from digging. He continued digging downward.

Finally, with Qin Yu’s relentless efforts, the mine in front of him was completely excavated, revealing the dark light in pieces.

Qin Yu frowned. He picked up the black iron-like thing from the ground, put it in his hand, and carefully stroked it.

“This place is indeed a mine.” Qin Yu was extremely shocked.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly understood the purpose of the mine above. It was to hide the actual minerals below!

Relying on some worthless ores to interfere with the dao technique, it would not be discovered by others.

“What a good method,” Qin Yu thought to himself. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He took the black ore and looked at it carefully, but he couldn’t tell what it was.

“Strange.” Qin Yu touched her chin. “What’s the use of these ores?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt the ore in front of him possess a very familiar smell.

“These ores… seem to be similar to the treasures I obtained in the sanctum,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Could it be that these ores are used to forge Saint Weapons?” At this moment, Qin Yu was suddenly shocked!

In that case, Qin Yu could use the fragments of the Saint Weapon and the ores in front of him to forge a real Saint Weapon!

Although there was a difference to an extent between the Saint Weapon and the divine weapon used by the True Saint, it was still a genuine Saint Weapon!

“I see.” Qin Yu finally understood.

He continued to dig downward. As expected, there was a large amount of ore buried underneath!

Even Qin Yu’s Spatial Magic Artifact could not accommodate the amount of ore!

“D*mn it! if I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have opened the mine.” Qin Yu frowned.

The ores above had already been shattered by Qin Yu, so it was impossible to hide again.

“If need be, I will set up a sky-concealing formation here,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Only through this could the internal qi emitted by the ores be hidden.

...

Qin Yu’s method of setting up a formation was not superb, and he was far inferior to a real Formation Master. However, it was obviously too late to look for a so-called Formation Master now.

“It would be great if the man with the mustache were here,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

With his ability, he could either take all the ores away or hide them completely.

Qin Yu stopped thinking about it and began to look for a direction, planning to set up a formation nearby.

“Thank you, my friend, for excavating such a treasure for our Serene South City.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from nearby.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He turned around and saw several cultivators nearby the mine with a big formation.

These people’s internal qi was clearly much stronger, and their clothes were even more luxurious.

In just a while, countless people completely surrounded the mine. They held secret treasures in their hands and directly sealed off the space.

Qin Yu frowned and soon noticed Yue Lingdong in the crowd.

“So it’s you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

...

Yue Lingdong ignored Qin Yu. He cupped his hands at an elderly man and said, “General-in-Chief, this is the person who not only robbed my Yue family’s mine, and also injured our people. General-in-Chief, please help my Yue family. My Yue family is willing to hand over this mine to Serene South City!”

The elderly man, who was addressed as General-in-Chief, stroked his beard and said with a smile, “Alright. City Lord will decide on this matter.”

Then he looked at Qin Yu and said, “My friend, please come with us to meet the city lord.”
