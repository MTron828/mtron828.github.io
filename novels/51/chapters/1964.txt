1965 Unreliable

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at Jue Wu with doubt in his eyes.

“What’s the matter?” Qin Yu asked in a low voice.

Jue Wu ignored Qin Yu but looked at the two elderly men not far away.

“Answer me,” Jue Wu said with a dark face.

!!

“Lady, what do you mean by that?” the two elderly men asked with a smile.

“Stop pretending. Do you think I can’t tell?” Jue Wu’s face became colder, and she couldn’t help but exude a strong sense of oppression.

The two elderly men’s faces finally turned cold. They looked at Jue Wu and said coldly, “You’re right. It’s indeed a small-scale formation. Since you’ve seen through it, I won’t waste time with you.”

After speaking, the elderly man waved his hand, and several people walked out from the dark.

The crowd surrounded Qin Yu and Jue Wu, each with an unfriendly expression.

Qin Yu finally understood. He looked at the elderly man in front of him and said, “What is the Yao family’s intention?”

“Qin Yu, it’s true that the Yao family has intended to recruit you. However, it’s a pity you’ve offended the Si family,” the elderly man said coldly.

“It’s not worth offending the Si family for you.”

“If that’s the case, I’ll just leave,” Qin Yu sneered and said. “Why do you have to make a big fuss?”

“I’m afraid you can’t leave. Please come with us to the Yao family. As for how to deal with it, we will leave it to the head of the family,” the elderly man said coldly.

This time, Qin Yu was seriously injured and was unable to resist. Fortunately, Jue Wu was here, so Qin Yu was not worried.

He stepped back and said, “Jue Wu, I’m counting on you.”

Jue Wu rubbed her hands and said with a smile, “How should we deal with these people?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and said coldly, “Kill them.”

“Alright.” Without saying anything else, Jue Wu’s internal qi instantly erupted.

The battle was about to start, so Qin Yu stood aside and watched quietly.

Jue Wu’s strength didn’t need to be elaborated, but the Yao family’s people weren’t weak either.

They jointly controlled the formation. Even Jue Wu couldn’t quickly end the battle.

Not far away, the city lord’s expression was tremendously ugly. He had never thought things would turn out like this.

The entire city was constantly glowing with light, and a terrifying internal qi lingered in the sky above the city.

“Boom!”

Accompanied by a loud sound, a terrifying purple light burst out from Jue Wu’s body. This light shattered the Yao family’s formation and sent the spell caster flying!

Jue Wu wouldn’t give them any chance to breathe. She opened her small hand and turned one of them into a pile of meat!

Without the protection of the formation, these people were simply not Jue Wu’s match. In just a few seconds, three people had lost their lives.

“D*mn! This woman is not simple!” The elderly man from the Yao family had an unsightly expression.

“I advise you to stop, or else the Yao family will not let you off!” someone shouted, but the only response he received was a palm strike.

Soon, all the people of the Yao family died in Jue Wu’s hands.

Looking at the mess, the city lord couldn’t help but feel bitter.

“I’m afraid it’s going to be troublesome.” Qin Yu sighed.

First, he offended the Si family. Now, he offended the Yao family.

“You two should hurry up and leave. This place is very close to the Yao family. They won’t give up easily.” The city lord sighed.

Qin Yu nodded, then cupped his hands at the city lord and said, “I’ve caused you trouble,”

“What are you afraid of? I’ll kill all the people they send!” Jue Wu snorted coldly and said.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Let’s leave this place as soon as possible. The Yao family is a top aristocratic family after all. I’m afraid that they have a True Saint guarding them.”

Hearing this, Jue Wu also lost some confidence.

Facing a True Saint, even Jue Wu had no chance of resisting.

“Worts scenario, we’ll just go back to Thunder Courtyard. I don’t believe they would dare to come in to kill people,” Jue Wu muttered.

“We’re not at that stage yet. Let’s go,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Where are we going?” Jue Wu was puzzled.

“Sky City,”

No one could not fight in Sky City, even the nine great aristocratic families.

Furthermore, there were top-notch resources there. Qin Yu needed to recuperate, so he had to go to Sky City.

The two stepped into Sky City again.

Qin Yu was recognized as soon as he stepped into the city.

The crowd looked at Qin Yu’s figure and couldn’t help but discuss animatedly.

“Isn’t that Qin Yu? Why did he come back?”

“Looking at his appearance, he seems to be quite weak.”

“Hmph! I’m afraid the Si family is going after his life. He’s taken refuge in Sky City.”

Hearing the discussion in the surroundings, Jue Wu couldn’t help but curse, “What are you looking at? If you look again, I’ll dig out your eyeballs!

“Eh? Who’s that little girl? Why have I not seen her before? Could she be Qin Yu’s younger sister?”

“This little thing is quite fierce. I’ll raise one to play with later.”

By the side, Jue Wu couldn’t help but look fierce in anger. She didn’t say anything else and was ready to attack.

Qin Yu quickly stopped Jue Wu and shook his head, saying, “No one is allowed to make a move in Sky City.”

“What bullsh*t rules!” Jue Wu huffed.

“It’s due to this bullsh*t rule that I came here to take refuge. They’ve said it right,” Qin Yu said, shaking his head.

Although Jue Wu was angry, she could only endure it.

After that, bringing Jue Wu along, Qin Yu bought a house in Sky City and stayed there for the time being. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The news about Qin Yu going to Sky City spread very quickly.

Many people had come to see him out of admiration. However, they did not get to step into the courtyard, not even a half step.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged and ignored them.

He wrote down a few pills’ names on a piece of paper and handed it to Jue Wu.

“Go to the city to look for an alchemist. Help me buy these pills,” Qin Yu said.

With Qin Yu’s current injuries, self-healing was too slow. Thus he could only rely on pills.

Jue Wu took the prescription, turned around, and walked out the door.

“Quickly get out of here! What are you guys doing here? Get loss!” As soon as Jue Wu went out, she started cursing.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh, feeling somewhat worried.

It would be troublesome if Jue Wu got into a fight after she left.

Just then, a familiar figure suddenly appeared outside the door.

The man was thin and weak. Two people were supporting him.

“The Prince of Great Xia?” Qin Yu was startled. He got up hurriedly to greet him.

“The Prince of Great Xia?” Jue Wu, by his side, frowned.

“You know the Prince of Great Xia?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“No, I don’t know him, but I’ve heard of him. He used to be from a royal family in the Holy Region,” Jue Wu said.

Qin Yu suddenly realized. After all, Jue Wu was already hundreds of years old, so it was not strange for her to know about Great Xia Royal Family.

Then, Qin Yu cupped his hands and greeted the prince, “Your Highness.”

“Mr. Qin is too polite,” the prince waved his hand and said.
