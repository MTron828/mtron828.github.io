Chapter 436: You Are More Ruthless Than Before Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s words clearly carried some displeasure and even sadness.

Even though Qin Yu knew that this was Fang Yue’s right, he still couldn’t express the displeasure in his heart.

“Looks like Mr. Qin is jealous,” Fang Yue teased.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “That’s your right. He Teng is, after all, the number one person on the potential leaderboard. He’s not someone I can compare to.”

Fang Yue couldn’t help but cover her mouth and laugh lightly.

“Alright, I won’t tease you anymore. This invitation wasn’t given to He Teng by me. It was given to me by He Teng,” said Fang Yue.

“He Teng’s family background is extraordinary. He even has a powerful master backing him. He knows more about the inner core than even I do.”

“The only reason he found me was because he wanted my help.”

At this point, Fang Yue said sweetly, “In my heart, Mr. Qin is the only one.”

Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue suspiciously, and then suddenly thought of something.

“He Teng found you... so, there should be something he wants on Brightheart Island.” Qin Yu’s voice was slightly anxious.

Fang Yue nodded and said, “You can say that. I don’t know what it is exactly. But since he found me, it’s most likely because of the demonic beast inner core.”

“Demonic beast inner core...”

This term quickly flashed across Qin Yu’s mind.

Countless pieces of news regarding the demonic beast inner core were sent over.

Other than the inner core gifted by Fang Yue, there were also countless types of inner cores that contained the purest spiritual energy!

Its effect was equivalent to the Golden Core Stage among human cultivators!

Such an inner core was something that could only be encountered by chance and not sought after. Its preciousness was comparable to a ten-thousand-year-old spiritual medicine!

“Miss Fang, do you have a way to let me participate in this extravagant cruise?” Qin Yu asked anxiously.

Fang Yue shook her head and said, “Mr. Qin, forgive me for being unable to do anything. If you want to enter the cruise, you must have an invitation letter.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, and a trace of viciousness suddenly flashed in his eyes!

“I must think of a way to enter this extravagant cruise, even if it’s to snatch an invitation letter!” Qin Yu said coldly.

To Qin Yu, he didn’t have much time to begin with.

Qin Yu would never give up such an opportunity.

Even if it meant that he had to be an evil person who killed people and stole their goods!

“I believe that you can think of a way.” Fang Yue snickered.

After saying that, Fang Yue stood up and prepared to leave.

“Wait.” Qin Yu called out to Fang Yue.

He took out the folding fan from his Spatial Magic Artifactand handed it to Fang Yue.

“This is a gift for you,” said Qin Yu.

After she took the folding fan, Fang Yue’s eyes couldn’t help but flash with astonishment.

“This is... a magic artifact?” Fang Yue asked in surprise.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “It should be. I don’t know either.”

Fang Yue was overwhelmed with joy. She bowed and said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin.”

After saying goodbye to Fang Yue, Qin Yu went straight to the vicinity of Brightheart Island.

There were many mansions here, and the people who lived here were the people who would participate in the extravagant cruise tomorrow.

Qin Yu hid in the dark and coldly watched the people coming and going.

“In order to raise my cultivation level as soon as possible, I can only resort to shady means.” A trace of viciousness flashed in Qin Yu’s eyes.

From the beginning to the end, Qin Yu had never hurt innocent people, but this time, he probably had to.

Time passed by minute by minute, and soon, it was midnight.

There were dozens of people participating in the extravagant cruise, and Qin Yu didn’t know who to attack for a moment.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly saw a familiar figure.

“Old Mister Yan?” Seeing this figure, Qin Yu was a little surprised. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

With a quick step, he instantly arrived in front of Old Mister Yan.

“Old Mister Yan, why are you here?” Qin Yu’s tone was full of surprise and joy.

Old Mister Yan also said in surprise, “Qin Yu? Why did you come to Sea City?”

Qin Yu quickly told Old Mister Yan about what had happened.

After hearing it, Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but stroke his beard and smile. “You want to go to Brightheart Island?”

“That’s right,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“This trip to Brightheart Island is very important to me, so I have to go,” Qin Yu took a deep breath and said.

Old Mister Yan laughed and said, “That’s easy. I’ll just give you my invitation letter.”

After saying that, Old Mister Yan took out the invitation letter and handed it to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Um... I’m afraid it’s not suitable.”

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “What’s unsuitable about it? People like us go to Brightheart Island just to travel. It’s not important.”

Qin Yu took the invitation and still felt a little guilty.

But he had to admit that what Old Mister Yan said was indeed reasonable.

“Bang!”

At this moment, the villa’s door was suddenly kicked open.

Then, a middle-aged man in a suit walked in with three to five strong men.

When he saw this middle-aged man, a trace of displeasure flashed across Old Mister Yan’s face.

“Lou Cheng, what are you doing here?” Old Mister Yan asked coldly.

The man called Lou Cheng sat on the sofa smugly. He lit a cigar and took a deep breath.

“You didn’t understand what I said at the party just now, did you?” Lou Cheng sized up Old Mister Yan and said.

Old Mister Yan frowned slightly and said with a cold expression, “Lou Cheng, you’d better not make things difficult for yourself.”

“Make things difficult for myself? Hahaha!” Lou Cheng couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“This is Sea City! I can crush you to death easily!” Lou Cheng looked at Old Mister Yan coldly.

As he spoke, the few martial artists beside him also immediately took a step forward with the intention to attack.

Old Mister Yan squinted his eyes and said, “Lou Cheng, what do you want?”

“What do I want?” Lou Cheng snorted.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “It’s simple. Kneel down and admit your mistake, and I will let you have a way to make a livelihood in Sea City.”

“Otherwise... I will let you die on Brightheart Island tomorrow!” Lou Cheng said with a gloomy tone.

Qin Yu glanced at Lou Cheng and asked casually, “Do you know him?”

Old Mister Yan nodded and said, “Yes, he is an overlord in the local business world. He has always been tyrannical.”

Qin Yu said, “Oh.” The next second, Qin Yu suddenly raised his hand and slapped him.

Lou Cheng’s head was smashed like a watermelon on the spot!

Even Old Mister Yan was shocked.

“Qin Yu, you... Why did you kill him?” Old Mister Yan frowned.

Qin Yu grinned and said, “If we kill him, the two of us can go to Brightheart Island.”

The few martial artists following Lou Cheng wanted to run, but Qin Yu didn’t give them a chance. He raised his hand and slapped them, turning them into meat paste.

In just a few seconds, the four living people became corpses.

Qin Yu’s palm lit up with spiritual fire and fell on the bodies of the people.

Soon, their corpses disappeared without a trace.

Old Mister Yan was silent for a moment, and then said, “Qin Yu, you are more ruthless than before.”
