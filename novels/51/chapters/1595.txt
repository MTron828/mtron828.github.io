Chapter 1596: Chapter 1,596. Once a hero leaves, he will never return Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The eyes of the two godly monarchs revealed a trace of viciousness, but behind this viciousness hid a trace of fear.

As for Sima bei beside them, he was not as optimistic as they were.

Although he also felt that what the two godly monarchs said was right, he still felt uncertain in his heart.

He had been afraid of the sect master of the Tianyun sect for too many years, and it had long become a psychological shadow.

In the Dead River, Xiao Hai was pacing with difficulty. White fog would rise up with every step he took.

“Forcefully crossing the Dead River is really unheard of,”Sima Bei said in a low voice.

The three of them quietly watched Xiao Hai cross the Dead River.

Soon, more and more people surrounded him.

They seemed to be shocked by the scene in front of them.

The banks of the Dead River were already stained with black-robed men, but Xiao Hai still did not show any fear.

It was as if he did not know pain. Despite his bones and flesh being corroded, there was no pain on his face.

This process lasted for several hours.

After a long time, Xiao Hai finally succeeded in crossing the Dead River.

Just as the godly monarch had guessed, after crossing the Dead River, Xiao Hai’s internal Qi had become much weaker. More than half of his flesh and blood had also been corroded. He looked terrible.

However, his resolute face still moved people.

“Sect master of the Tianyun sect, we meet again!”One of the godly monarchs shouted. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Last time, you killed one of us. This time, I must make you pay the price!”The other godly monarch followed closely behind.

Xiao Hai coldly swept his gaze over the two of them before laughing out loud, “I am not the sect master of the Tianyun sect.”

“Not the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? Then who are you?”Everyone was stunned.

Wasn’t the person in front of them the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? How could he have mistaken that face?

“What, after fighting for such a long time, you don’t even recognize me?”Xiao Hai coldly asked.

Everyone looked at each other and were momentarily stunned.

“You... are Xiao Hai? !”Sima bei was the first to react!

The Man in front of him, regardless of his body shape, wasn’t he Xiao Hai from across the Dead River!

“What? You are actually Xiao Hai?”The two godly monarchs also widened their eyes.

Why did Xiao Hai look exactly the same as the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? What was the relationship between these two people?

“Xiao Hai... why do you all have the same face!”Sima bei shouted.

Xiao Hai looked at him coldly and said, “Is there a need for me to explain to you?”

“Regardless of whether you are Xiao Hai or the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, you will die today if you come to my northern land!”One of the godly monarchs said coldly.

Sima bei frowned and said, “Why did you pay such a huge price to cross the Death River?”

Xiao Hai coldly said, “Of course it’s for the sake of your northern land’s master. If he wants to revive, he has to ask me if I agree!”

“You dare to have designs on the master? !”

For a moment, the crowd became restless and everyone flew into a rage!

“Xiao Hai, how dare you! Our Northern Land’s master is not someone you can lay your hands on!”

“How dare you! You’d better kneel down and apologize to the Master Right Now!”

The cultivators of the northern lands began to curse loudly, as if they wanted to swallow Xiao Hai whole.

“Hahahahaha!”

But right at this moment, Xiao Hai burst into laughter!

His heroic laughter shook the entire world. Countless mountains and rivers were shattered in an instant, and the snowflakes that fell from the sky also began to tremble violently!

Many cultivators covered their ears, as if they could not bear the laughter!

“If any of you are not convinced, feel free to come!”Xiao Hai roared, shaking the heaven and earth like a dragon’s Roar!

“Xiao Hai, let me see what you can do!”

In the crowd, a black-robed man shouted loudly, and then he directly rushed toward Xiao Hai!

Xiao Hai did not turn his head. He waved his large palm, and a sharp and pure genuine qi instantly slapped over!

That cultivator was not even able to touch a corner of Xiao Hai’s clothes before he was directly turned into meat paste!

Seeing such a terrifying method, everyone could not help but take a step back!

Sima bei and the others were also greatly shocked in their hearts.

One had to know that Xiao Hai had just crossed the death river, so his strength would definitely be damaged!

And under the Northern Land’s sky, his strength would once again be suppressed!

But even under such circumstances, Xiao Hai still had such terrifying battle strength, how could people not be shocked!

“Xiao Hai, if you are willing to submit...”

“I am not here to listen to your nonsense.”Xiao Hai coldly looked at a godly king. He did not say a single word. Stepping on the void, he instantly appeared in front of this godly King!

That godly king’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly used a spell to protect his body!

Streams of terrifying true qi surrounded his body. At the same time, Xiao Hai’s dragon-like palm suddenly slapped over!

“Boom!”

A terrifying qi energy exploded out, and a powerful shockwave shattered countless icebergs!

The Godly King was pushed back a few steps, and the true qi emitted from his body had long been shattered!

“Xiao Hai, don’t be too arrogant!”Sima bei and the other godly king also stepped over!

Xiao Hai roared, “There’s no need to talk so much nonsense, die!”

With that said, Xiao Hai’s hands slid, rapidly evolving his dao technique!

In a moment, several golden godly dragons condensed in the sky! This was a technique that Xiao Hai had evolved using spiritual power. Its power was endless!

“Die for me!”

Xiao Hai roared, and the godly dragons in the sky were like a patch of sunlight in the darkness of the northern lands, pressing down!

The three godly monarchs of the northern lands hurriedly responded, but even so, the land of the northern lands was still trembling!

This was an extremely large area of impact, and everyone was affected. Who knew how many icebergs were directly shattered!

Countless cultivators of the northern lands were directly turned into meat paste, and the white snowy ground was dyed bright red!

“Xiao Hai, aren’t you going too far!”A godly monarch roared.

“I came here today to start a massacre. All of you can go to hell!”Xiao Hai roared loudly, and a terrifying spiritual power enveloped the entire area.

The entire area seemed to be unable to bear Xiao Hai’s tall figure. He was fighting against the entire northern lands by himself!

This would definitely go down in history and be hailed as a hero by future generations.

Across the river of death, Monk Hongxi clasped his hands together as if he was praying for Xiao Hai.

His arrogant figure would forever remain in monk Hongxi’s heart.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu and Iron Egg were looking for Qu Zhu and the others.

“HMM? What kind of F * cking meat is this? It’s even dried? How come I’ve never eaten it before?”

“Eh? Isn’t this the Tiangang Silkworm? It’s actually cooked? This thing is only delicious when it’s Fried!”

Along the way, iron egg ate whatever he saw. He had been sealed for too long, and he had an incomparable thirst for the delicacies of the mortal world.

Qin Yu paid the bill for him while apologizing to the roadside stall owners.

Iron Egg had a natural murderous aura. Although the owners felt aggrieved, none of them dared to provoke him.
