Chapter 893: Chapter 893, devouring ice and snow glazed heart

Wan Gu Qiong looked down at Kong Yun with an arrogant expression. He did not put Kong Yun in his eyes at all.

“F * ck you!”

Kong Yun roared and immediately clenched his fist and charged towards Wan Gu Qiong!

However, at this moment, the two martial saints behind Wan Gu Qiong attacked.

They only raised their fingers and Kong Yun was sent flying dozens of meters away. His sternum was even shattered!

The smile on Wan Guqiong’s face grew wider. He sneered and said, “Those below the martial saint level are all ants. Kong Yun, I only raised my finger to kill you.”

“F * ck you!”Kong Yun stood up from the ground and rushed toward Wan guqiong again.

However, Zhuang Teng and the others quickly stopped Kong Yun and signaled him to calm down.

“Mr. Wan, I thought you were a gentleman. I didn’t expect you to be so despicable and disgusting. We are not the same people. Goodbye.”Zhuang Teng said coldly.

“Wan Gu Qiong, different paths lead to different strategies. Zhao Zhi will come to kill you sooner or later.”

“I hope I can kill you with my own hands next time I see you!”

Many young masters of Jingdu left the Green Moon Villa one after another.

They couldn’t change anything. All they could do was try their best not to witness this cruel scene.

For three whole days.

The Green Moon Villa had turned into a river of blood. It had truly become a hell on Earth.

If Yao Meng had not taken Zhen Yue away with her death warrant, she would have already become the prisoner’s fury of the eternal weapon.

...

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

During this month, everyone had been searching for Qin Yu’s figure, but there was no news.

Even so, these forces from the mystic realm still did not give up.

On this day, many martial saints gathered in the office of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Although they were all martial saints, there was still a huge gap between their strengths.

The most powerful one of them naturally came from the second secret realm, Zhai Xing.

He was a peak powerhouse at the advanced stage of the martial saint. Even in the second secret realm, he was an invincible existence.

Strength represented the right to speak, and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association naturally held the dominant position.

Seven Martial Saints gathered in the same office.

The person in charge of this meeting was Gu Xinghe, who had suffered two defeats.

“For a whole month, we haven’t found any useful information.”Gu Xinghe swept his gaze across the many martial saints. There was not a trace of fear on his face. On the contrary, he continued to look down on them.

“Young master Gu, I believe that the Jingdu martial arts association should have an easier way to find Qin Yu, right?”Someone said from the side.

Gu Xinghe glanced at them and said, “That’s why I called you here.”

“We have Yan Ruoxue’s blood. Through a secret method, we can accurately find her location.”

“But unfortunately, our deduction has failed many times.”

Hearing this, everyone present looked at each other in dismay.

“Failed? What do you mean?”Someone frowned.

Gu Xinghe slowly stood up and said coldly: “There is only one possibility, and that is they have entered a certain secret realm.”

“Once they have entered the secret realm, our deduction will lose its effectiveness.”

As soon as these words were said, everyone suddenly came to a sudden realization!

That’s right! They had searched through more than half of the Yan country, but they still could not find Qin Yu. The only possibility was that he had entered the secret realm to hide!

“Pyro... . . Young Master Gu, do you know where that Qin Yu Is?”A martial saint asked.

Gu xing he laughed coldly: “If I knew, why would I look for you guys?”

Everyone immediately fell silent, waiting for Gu Xing he to continue.

Gu Xing he stood up and said coldly: “According to the instructions of the eight higher ups, I am ordering all of you to use all methods to dig out all the pyro that you know of!”

“As soon as you find the figures of Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue, tell me immediately!”

“If someone conceals it and doesn’t report it... The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will take action to wipe out that secret realm!”

These words carried a strong sense of threat and instantly caused everyone to be extremely dissatisfied.

“Young master Gu, as martial saints, we may not necessarily be afraid of you,”a martial saint said coldly.

“Is that so?”Gu Xinghe could not help but laugh coldly. Then, he looked at Zhai Xing who was beside him.

Zhai Xing did not say a word. He suddenly pushed his palm forward. That destructive power instantly gushed out from his sleeve!

This power was so powerful that it almost drowned that martial saint in an instant!

“Boom!”

In just half a second, that martial saint’s physical body had turned into a bloody mist!

When everyone saw this scene, they could not help but suck in a breath of cold air!

They were both martial saints, but the gap between them was actually this big?

Gu Xinghe said with a cold face, “This time, I will only destroy your body. If there is a next time, I will make your primordial spirit dissipate!”

This move undoubtedly shocked all the martial saints in the mystic realm.

At this moment, they could clearly feel the difference in strength.

After the meeting ended, Gu Xinghe could not help but frown.

“This Qin Yu must be hiding in some secret realm.”Gu Xinghe took a deep breath.

The others had gone to look for Qin Yu for Yan Ruoxue.

However, Gu Xinghe was different. He wished that he could find Qin Yu and tear him into pieces, so that he could avenge himself!

“If Qin Yu is hiding in an uninhabited secret realm, I’m afraid no one will be able to find him,”Zhai Xing said from the side.

Gu Xinghe snorted lightly and said, “It’s alright. My father has already applied to the higher-ups. In a few days, there will be a top-tier mystic realm master to help me.”

“When that time comes, even if he is hiding in the secret realm, we can still find him!”

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was still absorbing the ice and snow glazed heart at a leisurely pace.

The ice and snow glazed heart was more difficult to swallow than Qin Yu had imagined. In an entire month, only half of the ice and snow glazed heart had been swallowed.

Qin Yu opened his eyes and looked up at the ice and snow glazed heart hanging above his head. He couldn’t help but frown.

“The absorption of the ice and snow glazed heart seems to have reached its peak,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Peak?”Yan Ruoxue’s eyes were a little surprised. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Whether it’s internal Qi, yin qi, or other auras, they will all reach their peak.”

“After reaching the peak, no matter how much you absorb, your strength will not improve by even half a step.”

Yan Ruoxue was confused, but she still nodded.

“I’ll give you this ice-snow glazed heart.”Qin Yu took the ice-snow glazed heart and handed it to Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue waved her hand and said, “No, I’m just bored and trying to cultivate. You can keep it for yourself.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Old Mister Yan said that you have the complete bloodline of the Yan family in your body. This bloodline is extremely overbearing. If you step into the cultivation path, the future is unimaginable.”

“Moreover... this ice glaze heart is useless to me.”

Seeing this, Yan Ruoxue could only accept the ice glaze heart.

After that, Qin Yu taught the heaven swallowing technique to Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue’s learning speed was extremely fast, and she quickly comprehended the heaven swallowing technique.

And when she tried to use the heaven swallowing technique to swallow the ice and snow glazed heart, a shocking scene happened.
