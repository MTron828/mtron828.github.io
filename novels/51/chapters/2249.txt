2250 Divine Artifact Refinement

He persisted for almost ten minutes, but the divine sense had not dissipated. He thus could only use other methods.

He abruptly dispelled the Spiritualization Technique, causing the soul power enveloping his tangible body to vanish.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth, once again ceasing the circulation of chaotic qi and dissolving the Saintly Body Technique.

If one were to see this, one would think Qin Yu had gone crazy.

However, Qin Yu could only disperse all the spiritual energy fluctuations at this moment. He even dared not use the power of his divine sense, only hoping the thing underground would quickly fall asleep again and not notice him.

The intense heat instantly spread throughout Qin Yu’s body. He felt as if his body was on fire.

That divine sense passed by in a trance as if it would be refined by the high temperature at any time.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth tightly, his veins bulging.

In that instant, he could almost smell roasted meat on his body.

A duration of ten seconds was the limit of his body.

The skin on Qin Yu’s body cracked open, and the veins broke.

His body was almost covered in blood and instantly roasted into a scab by the terrifying high temperature.

“This is the moment!”

He fiercely mobilized all the chaotic energy once again, exerting all his strength to rush out from the lava.

Qin Yu secretly prayed in his heart, hoping the moment all the qi fluctuations dissipated, the thing underground would divert its attention and give him a chance to escape.

“Roar!”

Almost the instant Qin Yu accelerated, an extremely loud roar spread into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

In Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, a giant fire unicorn stared at him coldly.

Divine Beast Fire Unicorn!

The rumors of the Fire Qilin Continent were actually true. There was indeed a divine beast here.

An ancient divine beast meant it was almost equivalent to existence at the peak of the Tribulation Transcending Stage. Some top-notch divine beasts were even comparable to Immortal Emperor.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s divine sense was almost unmovable at all. That feeling was like an ordinary person facing a tiger. Not to mention escaping, he could not even move a single toe.

His body slowly sank, and his divine sense also slowly became blurry.

His body slowly melted, and his soul gradually dissipated in the lava.

“Crack!”

A crisp sound rang out as the shell shattered. A crack appeared on the demonic eggshell.

At the same time, an even more sinister voice suddenly resounded throughout the entire continent.

At this moment, countless people felt their souls being watched by a terrifying and mysterious existence. Most of the cultivators’ feet trembled, and some even fainted directly.

“What is this? Did a mighty realm cultivator awaken?”

Nangong Qi’s face revealed tremendous shock. In front of this divine sense, he was like an ant.

“It should be a mighty realm cultivator from the previous era awakening. It happened before.”

“He should be falling asleep again very soon…”

The group of cultivators discussed animatedly. At that moment, a terrifying divine sense flashed past, causing their attention on Suo Lin to decrease.

That was another kind of terrifying feeling. This divine sense seemed able to see through all the secrets of the soul.

In this divine sense, all secrets and weaknesses were nowhere to hide.

That fire unicorn revealed a terrified expression and suddenly retreated from Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

In an instant, Qin Yu finally regained the ability to move. The chaotic qi wrapped around his entire body, and he was about to rush up.

A touch of coldness slid onto Qin Yu’s hand and entered through the Sumeru ring.

“The demonic egg? When did this demonic egg come out?”

Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled. Was the second divine sense repelling the fire unicorn’s divine sense the demonic egg?

He seemed to have understood something but sensed that something was wrong.

This fire unicorn seemed to be just a divine sense. Regardless of the impact just now, it was repelled by the demonic egg’s divine sense.

It would not be repelled so easily if it was a fire unicorn.

The fire unicorn was the number one ferocious beast in ancient times. Even the Divine Beast Holy Golden Dragon would not be defeated by such a blow.

“Could it be that this fire unicorn has already died? Then his body must be underneath.”

The divine thought flashed for only an instant. At this moment, even though all the defenses had been pushed to the limit. Qin Yu felt that he was on the verge of reaching his limit.

“So what if I die? If I’m so cowardly, I can never protect Ruoxue.”

He gritted his teeth and fiercely rushed into the depths.

A blood-red scene was before him, and he could not see what was ahead of him.

Qin Yu could only rely on the feeling of his body to feel around. He reached out with both hands and grabbed a fist-sized inner core.

His vision suddenly turned dark. At this moment, his eyeballs had already melted.

The hand holding the inner core had also already turned into bones, and its flesh and blood had directly melted into the lava.

Qin Yu rushed up madly. He was almost relying on his instincts to move. His divine sense had already become tremendously weak in such high temperatures, not to mention he had consumed a large amount of soul power to use the Spiritualization Technique.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s body suddenly rushed out of the lava.

“Senior Brother, someone seemed to have just jumped out of the sea of fire?”

A cultivator said with some shock.

“It seems to be the cultivator with Suo Lin.”

The people of the Mysterious Dark Sect discussed animatedly.

“This person must have some fire attribute treasures on him. Otherwise, how could he have survived in that lava?”

“But looking at his condition, he probably can’t survive.”

…

“Are you alright? Qin Yu?”

The man with the mustache and Wang Feng were shocked.

Qin Yu’s body was charred black, and his feet had completely melted.

The skin on his hands had also melted away, revealing bare and eerie white bones.

What was even more terrifying was none of his skin was intact. From his chest, one could actually see his beating heart.

He would have died long ago if his internal organs had not been baptized by the bone cultivation water.

“I’m still breathing.”

Qin Yu sent a voice transmission with difficulty.

He took the pills out and poured them into his mouth like beans, trying his best to repair his body.

“It didn’t work. This artifact’s soul is too weak. It exploded when it fused with the material of Wu Ji’s robe!”

Suo Lin said with a pale face. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Use this?”

Qin Yu handed over the unicorn’s inner core with difficulty.

Suo Lin subconsciously put the inner core on the gloves. In an instant, an enormous unicorn phantom appeared in the air.

The overwhelming pressure spread to everyone within ten thousand meters.

The volcanos shook violently, and dozens of massive streams of lava gushed out from the ground and poured onto the gloves.

The terrifyingly high temperature again instantly melted the fist that had already solidified.

“Qin Yu, this is your chance. Send a wisp of your divine sense into the glove,” Suo Lin said with a crazed expression.

Qin Yu sent his divine sense without hesitation.

“The supreme mountain previously! Do you have any other top-notch magical artifacts? I want to refine the first divine artifact of this era!”

Suo Lin shouted frantically.

Qin Yu suddenly threw the Supreme Mountain of the Five Elements and the Soul-hunting Bell into it.
