“Something’s not right. The red-haired evil spirit’s injuries are actually recovering. The evil spirit’s internal qi will grow stronger as time passes.”

Qin Yu frowned deeply. If this dragged on, as time slowly passed, no one here would be able to escape.

He subconsciously searched for the man with the mustache. The man with the mustache was definitely a leader in the research of this Mystic Realm. If he was here, the situation might be much better.

However, after searching around, there was no sign of the man with the mustache. It was unknown if he was hiding or missed the opening time of the Mystic Realm.

The red-haired evil spirit had fully recovered in just a few dozen breaths.

Qin Yu was somewhat surprised to discover that in the underground, there was massive rules chain closely connected to the red-haired evil spirit.

Moreover, after the massive amount of spiritual energy absorbed by the Mystic Realm palace entered the underground, it continued to flow into the body of the red-haired evil spirit through the rules chain.

Otherwise, even if this red-haired evil spirit had heaven-defying strength, it could not withstand everyone’s attacks.

“Huff!”

Between the breaths of the evil spirit, it exhaled scorching thick smoke.

At this moment, he appeared behind Zong Yue with a move of his body, and Zong Yue did not even react!

“You’re courting death!”

The expression of the Blood Sect’s sect master, Gu Ming, changed drastically. His right hand swelled up as if it was about to charge up. His palm covered the red-haired evil spirit like covering the entire sky as he sent the red-haired evil spirit flying with a slap.

“Whoosh!” In an instant, the red-haired evil spirit charged toward Gu Ming even faster.

A cold smile appeared on Gu Ming’s face. He suddenly rushed toward Qin Yu.

However, his speed was not fast. The red-haired evil spirit, in an instant, caught up to him and slashed out the sickle.

The cold red light directly cut his body into hundreds of pieces.

The flesh and blood suddenly exploded and turned into spiritual energy. It then dissipated.

The red-haired evil spirit then turned to look at Gu Ming.

“D*mn it! You tricked me!”

Qin Yu was furious. Gu Ming was obviously setting him up.

“So what if I tricked you?”

Gu Ming sneered and said.

Qin Yu immediately increased his speed to the limit and rushed toward him, giving him a taste of his own medicine.

However, Gu Ming split into three persons straightaway and fled in different directions.

“Well done, Dad!”

Zong Yue shouted.

A cold look appeared on Gu Ming’s face. “You killed my sect’s three great elders. Today, you, Qin Yu, must die!”

Qin Yu’s face was drenched in cold sweat at this moment. He could not care less about saving his spiritual energy now.

The nine fire dragons blasted backward, borrowing the terrifying qi energy to dodge the red-haired evil spirit’s slash. His body flashed and appeared behind Zong Yue.

“Since your father tricked me, he’ll pay back with your life.”

Qin Yu lifted Zong Yue and used him to block himself.

“Zong Yue!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Gu Ming’s eyeballs almost popped out. He roared angrily and dared not hide his strength as a peak ninth grade.

A massive palm print fiercely suppressed the red-haired evil spirit.

In just an instant, the palm print melted.

Qin Yu directly smashed Zong Yue toward the red-haired evil spirit. It scared Zong Yue out of his wits, and he almost peed his pants.

“Help! Father! I’m going to die!”

Zong Yue’s legs were kicking wildly, but he was so nervous that he did not run a step away.

The enormous pupils on the evil spirit’s face stared at Zong Yue, and the sickle that symbolized death was raised high.

“I have a way to enter this Mystic Realm provided you help me block this evil spirit!”

Gu Ming roared, his hands trembling, and the veins on his forehead twitching nervously.

“Whoosh!”

A massive talisman suddenly enveloped the palace from above. The greenish talisman almost covered the entire palace.

Numerous black ink characters flowed incessantly over the greenish runes. A tremendous and earth-shaking aura surged, and under this imposing force, the runes suddenly pressed down.

The red-haired evil spirit immediately froze. What was shocking was that the rune did not affect anyone other than the red-haired evil spirit. His control over runes had already reached a level of perfection.

Chang Ye was the one who made the move. He stared at Gu Ming and asked.

“You have a way to enter the underground, do you?”

“Yes, I do. An ancestor of my Blood Sect was lucky enough to encounter the descent of the Netherworld Mystic Realm in the early years and obtained a Netherworld Token. But there’s a limit to the number of slots, which is only ten.”

Gu Ming narrowed his eyes and said.

“Take it out!”

The evil exterminator said indifferently.

“I can take it out, but my Blood Sect must have five slots, and everyone must swear on the Path of Heaven. Otherwise, with a thought, I can destroy it netherworld item.”

Gu Ming said coldly, his aura not weak at all.

“Five slots is impossible. In the netherworld, if we don’t have enough combat strength, we might not break through this Mystic Realm.”

Chang Ye shook its head.

“The Ghost Mansion Mystic Realm once appeared on a continent. That continent failed to break through the Mystic Realm in time and caused seven or eight out of ten people on that continent to die. If the matter doesn’t resolve this time, it will also be a tremendous disaster.

“You can only have two spots at most, and not more than that, even if you destroy the token.”

The evil exterminator said indifferently. “If it weren’t for this token, you wouldn’t have a single spot.”

Seeing the evil exterminator’s unyielding attitude and because their Blood Sect could not explore this Mystic Realm on their own, Gu Ming could only grit his teeth and agree.

The evil exterminator nodded slightly.

“The others will enter based on their strength. There are dangerous places in the Netherworld Mystic Realm, but the more dangerous the place, the more opportunities there are.”

The evil exterminator said indifferently, “Whoever feels that he has the strength to enter this Mystic Realm, come forward.”

The evil exterminator, Chang Ye, Situ Haoyue, Xi Menn, and Mei Li stood at the front without hesitation. Almost no one dared to challenge them.

After that, Uncle Ling, Wu Feng, and Shui Yuan.

Another middle-aged man with a fierce expression and high cheekbones also stepped forward. This person’s strength was also tremendously terrifying. The red-haired evil spirit had attacked him several times, but he remained unharmed. He should be a cultivator with a tremendously powerful physical body and soul.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and stepped forward.

It was pretty simple. There must be unimaginable opportunities down there. Otherwise, Gu Ming would not have wanted five spots.

Moreover, when these strongest cultivators entered the Mystic Realm, who could stop the evil spirits above?

“Trash, you dare to enter the Mystic Realm?”

Zong Yue shrieked.

“This concerns the fate of the people on the entire continent. With your current strength, are you trying to take advantage of the situation? You shouldn’t have this mindset.”

Gu Ming sneered.

“A fourth-grade True Saint, don’t come out and make a fool of yourself. With your strength, do you think you can get some magical artifact by chance?”

Wu Feng also said coldly.

“Why don’t you come and train with me? Let’s see who’s the trash?”

Qin Yu sneered and said.
