Chapter 2706: Meng Jing’s Kiss

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu tried. He found that it was indeed what Meng Jing had said.

The internal qi of the entire spatial teleportation formation was completely sealed. No matter how he tried, there was no sign of it activating.

The pressure in Qin Yu’s divine soul increased again as time passed.

At this moment, Qin Yu was already feeling extremely strained. His divine soul would likely be pulled into the Nineteenth Prison soon as Meng Jing had said.

He did not dare to trust the woman, but he seemed to have no other choice. “Tell me more about the Nineteenth Prison. What do I need to do to enter it?”

“The Nineteenth Prison exists in the deepest part of the divine soul. Once you sink into that place, you will forever become a living dead. This is why the Nineteenth Prison is called the Yin Yang World. Almost every cultivator will come into contact with it briefly when they cross the tribulation. Those familiar illusions during the tribulation are your memories in that soul region.” Meng Jing hesitated for a moment as if she was trying to organize her words.

“This is a taboo of this world. Very few people talk about this place, and no one has ever been able to explore it. Just imagine how vast the Nineteenth Prison is, and how it connects to everyone’s sea of divine sense. No one knows how it was created, nor does anyone know the purpose and meaning of its existence.

The mastermind uses a part of the power of the Nineteenth Prison this time. The conspiracy behind it is unimaginable.”

Qin Yu was a little shocked. He had never thought that the Nineteenth Prison existed in his sea of consciousness. He had never come across this concept before.

Moreover, one would encounter a terrifying Nightmare of inner demons when transcending the tribulation. Therefore, it was a narrow escape every time one transcended the tribulation. Their divine souls actually entered the Nineteenth Prison.

“Then why don’t you enter it yourself? If you can enter, you should be able to break through the Nineteenth Prison with your strength, right?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and asked an important question.

“My divine soul was born from this Saint Kingdom. Once I enter, I will immediately be discovered by the person in charge of the formation. Only a weak divine soul like yours will not arouse his vigilance.”

Meng Jing said seriously.

Although she was telling the truth, she could be more tactful.

Qin Yu’s pride was hurt. He had been proud of his continuous breakthroughs from the True Consciousness Realm to the Dao Realm, but he didn’t expect to encounter such an expert as soon as he entered the core region.

“Then what do I need to do when I enter? I can’t possibly fight him to the death, right?”

Qin Yu asked carefully, not daring to leave out any details.

“Since the living being can set up such a formation, he’s not someone you can deal with even if he didn’t absorb the power within. However, your divine soul is extraordinary. It can resist the power of the Nineteenth Prison. Almost no one below the Holy Consciousness level can resist this power. Once a soul enters the Nineteenth Prison, it will forget everything and become muddleheaded like a puppet.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Meng Jing stared at Qin Yu as if she wanted to see through him.

“I want you to enter it and use your soul power to draw a Three Light Talisman. Transfer the Dao Realm power of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom into it. Then, the souls in the Nineteenth Prison will wake up. At that time, the formation will break!”

Qin Yu roughly understood Meng Jing’s thoughts. The Nineteenth Prison was a world in a dream, and the divine souls trapped had forgotten that they were in a dream.

Once the scene in the Nineteenth Prison was destroyed, the divine souls inside would naturally wake up and return to the body.

At that time, the person behind the scenes could not continue devouring the power within.

“However, I have never entered it. I don’t know what will happen after you enter. You may be like those people and never return.”

Meng Jing looked at Qin Yu and said seriously.

Qin Yu felt his chest tight. His divine soul seemed to have been devoured.

The summoning power of the Nineteenth Prison pressed down on his divine soul again.

The summoning power seemed to become stronger and stronger as time passed.

Qin Yu sighed softly. It seemed that he had no choice.

This place was already a situation where death was certain. It was better to enter and perhaps destroy the Nineteenth Prison, which could win him a chance of survival.

“One last question. What can your favor do?”

Qin Yu stared at the woman.

“I will protect your life in this Saint Kingdom, or I will do my best to help you to become the Holy Lord. However, I cannot guarantee that you will ascend to the position of Holy Lord because there are a few people whom I cannot see through.”

Meng Jing gently fiddled with a few strands of soft hair on her forehead. She thought for a moment before saying that.

Qin Yu sucked in a breath of cold air. The position of the Holy Lord!

The fact that she could say this also reflected how terrifying this woman’s strength was. It also meant that this matter was not as simple as it seemed.

“Teach me the Three Light Talisman!”

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

The young girl pointed with her finger. A cold feeling instantly rippled out from Qin Yu’s forehead.

Her figure instantly entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. She used her finger as a brush and began to draw.

A rough outline appeared on the talisman, and there were corresponding persons.

“They were the Heavenly Dipper and the Big Dipper corresponding to the Dao

Mystical Saint Kingdom. These three people were the three Holy Lords of this Saint Kingdom. Remember this well! It’s late! I can sense that the divine sense is getting stronger and stronger. Let me demonstrate it once!”

The stars and the three Holy Lords were just the most superficial outlines.

After drawing the three stars, Qin Yu had the illusion that he was in the starry sky. The power of the stars seemed to want to pull him to the talisman drawn in the void.

As for the three Holy Lords, they exuded an aura that looked down on the world. It was as if one was facing the most terrifying Fierce Beasts.

The three of them emitted an extremely powerful divine charm in this Saint Kingdom.

Qin Yu used the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze to remember the strokes drawn clearly.

“Remember what I demonstrated. The Three Light Talisman is the most powerful in this Saint Kingdom. When the time comes, you only need to demonstrate one ten-thousandth of its charm, and it will wake up many souls. At that time, the arrangement of the mastermind will lose its effect!”

The voice in his sea of consciousness was a little anxious. Meng Jing seemed to have discovered a new situation.

“Wait, I haven’t remembered it yet! Wouldn’t it be troublesome if I can’t draw

Qin Yu said anxiously. It was extremely difficult to draw Daoist talismans. Such a powerful talisman was even more tough.

At least demonstrate it a few more times! “Just recall the charm of my painting. Time’s up! ”

Meng Jing revealed an unconcealable anxiety.

She suddenly moved in front of Qin Yu and kissed his lips.

Weng!

A cold feeling resounded throughout Qin Yu’s entire body. The feeling of this divine soul kissing magnified it by a hundred times..
