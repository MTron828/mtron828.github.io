Chapter 1304: Chapter 1,304, searching for life force 

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t refuse and could only follow the two of them to the imperial palace.

All the way to the imperial palace.

It had to be said that the imperial palace of Gu City was truly resplendent and magnificent.

Although Qin Yu had seen countless top-grade manor houses, he was still shocked by the scene before him.

The entire imperial palace was shrouded in dense mist. From time to time, white cranes flew by. At a glance, it was as if one had stepped into heaven.

“This is nothing. It’s far inferior to our Wen Family!”Wen Da saw Qin Yu’s shock and immediately patted his chest.

“That’s right, that’s right. The mountain that I just booked that day is even stronger than this!”Wen Er also said.

When the city Lord heard their words, he could not help but curse loudly in his heart.

“They are just two prodigals. If it weren’t for your grandfather, you would have been ripped off ten thousand times already!”The city Lord suppressed his anger and cursed madly in his heart.

Although he thought so, he still had a pleasant expression on his face.

They brought Qin Yu to the Great Hall, where a banquet had already been set up.

The civil and military officials of Gu City were all at the side to accompany him.

This kind of etiquette was usually used to receive top-notch big shots.

But now, they were receiving two good-for-nothing prodigals.

This made the city lord extremely uncomfortable. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Why did you find so many old men?”But at this time, Big Wen was blowing his beard and glaring, his face full of displeasure.

“That’s right, that’s right. Each and every one of them looks crooked and ugly. Are you going to let us eat? Hurry up and leave!”Wen Er waved his hand impatiently.

The city Lord, who was already extremely unhappy, wanted to flip the table when he heard the Wen brothers’words.

He suppressed the anger in his heart and waved his hand, saying, “You guys can leave first.”

After chasing the civil and military officials out of the Great Hall, the city Lord asked the city lord to find a large group of beautiful women dressed in muslin clothes to dance and accompany them in drinking. It was truly a joyous occasion.

Looking at the Wen brothers, who were not in their proper line of work, the city lord gritted his teeth in hatred.

His great hall of the imperial palace had been turned into a brothel by the two of them.

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He couldn’t imagine that the descendants of an expert would live in such a state.

“Come, Brother Qin, drink. Let’s Get Drunk Today!”Wen Da said with a wine cup in his hand.

Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t refuse. He accompanied the two Wen brothers and got drunk.

At night, the three of them lay on the table and fell into a coma.

The city Lord’s face was livid as he looked at the three of them coldly.

“City Lord, what are these three people? They are unseemly!”Someone could not help but curse.

The city Lord looked at him coldly and said, “Do you think I’m Willing? These two people have a deep background. Even the Heavenly Cloud sect is unwilling to offend them, let alone us.”

Following that, the city lord waved his hand and said, “Find a room and throw the three of them in.”

“Yes.”

The three of them were thrown into a rather luxurious room and stayed there for the time being.

It was noon the next day when the three of them woke up in a daze.

Qin Yu, who had a hangover for the whole night, only felt a slight pain in his head.

Without spiritual power, his drunken state was similar to that of an ordinary person.

And the Wen brothers were not any better. Big Wen rubbed his forehead and cursed, “Damn it, I drank too much again. I Won’t drink anymore.”

“That’s right, drinking makes things worse.”Wen Er nodded repeatedly.

Then, the two brothers looked at Qin Yu and asked, “Brother Qin, how do you feel?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “It’s alright, I can endure it.”

Wen da nodded and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, you are really capable. Even that Ling Yun isn’t a match for you.”

“You can’t say that. He was injured to begin with. If he was at his peak condition, it’s hard to say who would win or lose,”Qin Yu said with some seriousness.

Qin Yu was rather fearful of the huge disk phenomenon that Ling Yun had condensed.

“By the way, do you know where there is Life Energy?”Qin Yu looked at the Wen brothers.

“Life Energy?”The two looked at each other and then frowned. “My grandfather seems to have a little stock, but it’s not much. Ask him later.”

Qin Yu waved his hand repeatedly. Life Energy was extremely precious. A person like Wen wanyi would never give it to someone else.

“Isn’t there an auction in Gu City? You Can Try Your Luck. There might be one there,”Wen da said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He had also considered this method.

Many treasures were born in the auction.

As a city that extended in all directions, the treasures in the auction were endless.

Many top-notch martial artist from other cities would come here to search for treasures.

“Let’s go take a look at it tonight. The two of US also want to play,”Wen da said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, then it’s a deal.”

The three of them traveled through the entire imperial palace for the entire day.

The originally extremely solemn imperial palace became like an amusement park because of the arrival of the two brothers.

The city lord saw this, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

At night, Wen da greeted the city lord and left the imperial palace with Qin Yu.

As he watched the three of them leave, the city Lord’s expression turned even colder.

“Go and get someone to keep an eye on the three of them. Once Qin Yu and Wen Da Wen er part ways, inform me immediately,”the city Lord said coldly.

Although he couldn’t afford to offend Wen da Wen er, he wasn’t worried at all about Qin Yu who had no background.

Wen wanyun would go crazy for his grandson and wouldn’t do anything for an outsider.

Moreover, the city Lord had just received Qin Yu. If the Tianyun sect heard about this, they would probably be punished.

It was not too late to make amends.
