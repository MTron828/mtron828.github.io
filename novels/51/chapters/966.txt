Chapter 967: Chapter 967, the ritual of the Sky Blood Rainbow

Qin Yu’s divine sense was rapidly descending towards the abyss below!

The Abyss seemed to have some sort of attraction as it was about to devour Qin Yu’s divine sense!

“Hahaha, Kid, you actually took the initiative to send yourself to death. Then I won’t be polite!”The light shouted loudly.

The light below the Abyss actually transformed into a bloody mouth!

Looking at the mouth, it was a shocking sight!

Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change drastically! He hurriedly controlled his divine sense, trying to stop the rapid descent.

However, the power of the mouth was too great. Qin Yu’s divine sense was not even worth mentioning in front of it!

“Hahahaha, your divine sense is mine!”The light burst into waves of excited laughter!

Just as Qin Yu’s spiritual sense was about to fall into that big mouth, it disappeared into thin air!

Qin Yu’s main body suddenly opened his eyes, and a trace of sweat dripped down his forehead.

“Damn, that was close! I was almost swallowed by him,”Qin Yu muttered.

He wiped the sweat off his forehead, rubbed his chin, and said, “But this is a good method...”

In any case, Qin Yu could withdraw his divine sense back to his main body at any time. As long as he saw that things were not going well, he could quickly withdraw his divine sense.

Thus, Qin Yu returned to the space artifact again.

He stood on the mouth of the Abyss and jumped down again.

This time, the light still opened its bloody mouth, trying to Swallow Qin Yu.

But at the critical moment, Qin Yu withdrew his divine sense back to his main body.

He went back and forth five times.

The light under the Abyss could no longer hold it in.

He cursed loudly, “Little Bastard, you dare to trick me!”

Qin Yu grinned and said, “Are you angry just like that? You should be happy that I asked you to help me train my divine sense.”

“Happy the F * ck! Kid, if I can leave this abyss one day, I will definitely tear you into pieces!”The Deep Abyss roared furiously!

“We’ll talk about it when you come out.”Qin Yu stretched lazily.

“F * ck, I played with a fool like you all night. I’m a little tired. I’m going to sleep,”Qin Yu muttered.

After saying this, Qin Yu pulled his spiritual sense back to his original body. Then, he lay on the bed and fell into a deep sleep. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

However, Jingdu was not peaceful that night.

After he teng received Gu Xinghe’s orders, his actions became even more unscrupulous.

In just one night, several warriors had died at He Teng’s hands!

Their inner strength had been completely absorbed by He Teng, and they fell to the ground like dry corpses.

This method was exactly the same as Qin Yu’s heaven swallowing technique.

The next day, the news of these corpses spread, but it didn’t cause too much of a stir.

This was exactly Gu Xinghe’s plan.

He wanted to let the matter slowly ferment and let him guide it, so that everyone would gradually suspect Qin Yu.

In the office.

Gu Xinghe had a cigarette in his mouth. Combined with the expression on his face, he looked extremely vicious.

“Young Master Gu, Why didn’t you just let he teng kill people on a large scale and then directly suspect Qin Yu?”Long Mei asked, puzzled.

Gu Xinghe glanced at him and snorted coldly, “A fool like you, of course you can’t think clearly.”

“The current Qin Yu is extremely popular among the martial artists. If he’s too direct, do you think anyone will believe him?”

“I want them to guess in their own Panic! At the same time, I will send a martial saint to chase after Qin Yu and not give him any chance to defend himself!”

When Long Mei heard this, he could not help but appear a little surprised.

Even he did not expect that Gu Xinghe, who had always stayed in the second mystery dimension, would have such a meticulous and vicious mind.

“One must not be a man without poison. Those who achieve great things must be ruthless.”Gu Xinghe had already regarded this as his life’s principle.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu continued to train as usual.

He kept sinking his spiritual sense into the abyss and tried to break free himself.

As long as he was about to touch that Ray of light, Qin Yu would quickly pull back his spiritual sense.

The probing at the edge of death had allowed Qin Yu to improve extremely quickly. Moreover, his state of mind had also improved rapidly.

“At this rate, I’m afraid I will be able to step into the martial saint stage very soon.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He could clearly feel that his state of mind was completely enough to step into the martial saint stage.

However, he was still not clear about the choice of path.

If he could break through to the martial saint realm, then the path of cultivation in the future would become incomparably smooth and smooth.

For a few days in a row, Qin Yu kept probing in the abyss.

In the end, the light in the Abyss even began to ignore Qin Yu.

Even if Qin Yu landed at the bottom of the Abyss and stood by his side, he could not be bothered to pay attention to him.

“TSK TSK, so this is what you look like.”Qin Yu stood by the side of the light and kept sizing it up.

“Little Bastard, you’d better not go too far,”the light said coldly.

Qin Yu grinned and said, “Why don’t you just obey me and lend me your divine sense. When the time comes, I’ll find you a powerful body.”

“Hehe, I’m not interested in anything else except your body,”the other party replied.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “Then let’s waste our time.”

In the following days, Qin Yu not only trained every day, but also gave this light a spirit stone.

As time went by, Qin Yu’s spiritual sense became more and more powerful. He could now move the spirit stone with his spiritual sense.

At the same time.

In the immortal slaying sect in the northwest, Tian Xuehong had woken up.

In front of him stood dozens of white bones!

Each of the white bones contained an even stronger power than before!

Their bodies were emitting rays of dark light, as if they were hiding some mysterious and unfathomable power.

Tian Xuehong narrowed his eyes slightly, and a trace of madness appeared on his face!

“I’ve succeeded, I’ve finally succeeded!”Tian Xuehong was so excited that he almost roared!

“As long as I activate the ritual, I can absorb the spiritual consciousness of most people for my use

“At that time, I will be invincible in the world! hahahaha!”

Tian Xuehong’s laughter reverberated in the immortal slaying sect for a long time!

A moment later, Tian Xuehong slowly stood up.

He said coldly, “Go to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association now, activate the ritual, and absorb the spiritual sense!”
