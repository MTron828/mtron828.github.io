Chapter 1484: Chapter 1,484, Rashomon 1

Along the way, Qin Yu was terrified, afraid that the eighteen gods would catch up.

Qin Yu couldn’t think of any countermeasures against such a technique.

Covered in cold sweat, Qin Yu walked towards Mount Hua Ning.

Mo Hong, who had been hiding in the dark for many days, finally discovered Qin Yu.

His eyes lit up, and then he frowned.

“He... why did he come back from outside?”Mo Hong was dumbfounded for a moment.

Wasn’t Qin Yu always on Mount Hua Ning? When did he leave?

“Oh no, could it be that my information was wrong?”Mo Hong muttered in a low voice.

Since Qin Yu had returned to Mount Hua Ning, there was no need for him to continue waiting.

After thinking about it for a long time, he finally decided to return to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

...

Qin Yu returned to Mount Hua Ning and quickly found Jue Wu.

At this moment, Jue Wu was eating and drinking. She had a chicken drumstick in one hand and a pot of fine wine in the other.

Meanwhile, Wen Da Wen er had long passed out. It was obvious that they had drunk too much.

“Qin Yu? You came at the right time. Come, come, come. Quickly drink with me,”Jue Wu said casually.

Qin Yu was not in a good mood. He sat opposite Jue Wu and said in a deep voice, “I just met the eighteen gods.”

Hearing this, Jue Wu immediately sat up.

She said nervously, “How did you meet them? Did they make a move on you?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and then told Jue Wu the whole story.

After Jue Wu heard it, his face immediately sank.

“It’s the Rashomon sect,”Jue Wu said coldly.

“Rashomon sect? What kind of spell is that?”Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

Jue Wu looked at Qin Yu, he explained, “This spell was created by the sect Master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect. It’s his great killing weapon. “However, from what you said, these eighteen gods should have only learned the basics, because if the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect were to use the Rashomon sect, he wouldn’t need to get close at all.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp when he heard this.

That was only the basics? Moreover, such a terrifying technique was actually not an inheritance, but something he created himself?

“The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect actually has this kind of ability?”Qin Yu said with some shock.

Jue Wu rolled her eyes at Qin Yu and said, “Nonsense. Since he can lead the Heavenly Cloud sect to battle all over the place, he must have extremely powerful strength.”

Only then did Qin Yu Act. He had always underestimated the strength of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master.

“Then how should we break the Luo Sheng Sect?”Qin Yu asked.

Jue Wu shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. I’ve never met it before.”

Qin Yu immediately fell into silence.

Jue Wu might not have had the chance to meet the Luo Sheng sect, but Qin Yu would definitely meet it.

There would be a battle between him and the eighteen gods sooner or later.

“Does anyone know how to break this technique?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

Jue Wu rolled his eyes and said, “How would I know? Anyway, I heard that not many people can survive this technique. As for whether it’s true or not, I don’t know.”

Qin Yu scratched his head as if he was a little anxious. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Seeing that Qin Yu was unwilling, Jue Wu waved his hand and said, “Alright, I’ll help you ask around. You stay on the mountain.”

Qin Yu quickly pulled Jue Wu back and said, “If you leave, what if the eighteen gods come?”

Jue Wu glared and said, “They dare! If they dare to come to my Hua Ning Mountain, I’ll tear them all down! You can rest assured and stay on the mountain.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only nod his head.

Jue Wu didn’t waste any time and immediately left Hua Ning mountain.

As for Qin Yu, he brought the nascent soul pills that he had prepared and went all the way to Jue Wu’s cultivation room. He planned to begin his closed-door cultivation.

He took out the one hundred nascent soul pills in his hand and said in a low voice, “I only have seventy percent of my strength now. If I recover to the peak, my strength will still increase to a certain extent.”

“If I step into the mighty realm... perhaps I won’t be afraid of the eighteen gods.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu could not help but take a deep breath.

He did not dare to waste any more time. He took out the nascent soul pill and swallowed the first one.

Endless Spiritual Qi exploded in his body and flowed through his meridians to all parts of his body.

That familiar feeling made him feel relaxed and happy. Qin Yu could not help but tremble slightly.

A nascent soul pill needed at least two days to be completely absorbed. In order to save time, Qin Yu directly took out several nascent soul pills and stuffed them into his mouth.

This feeling was undoubtedly extremely painful. Qin Yu only felt as if his Dantian was about to explode, and his abdomen was cramping.

Layers of secret sweat appeared on his forehead, and he looked extremely painful.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and hurriedly circulated his meridian circulation technique, allowing his spiritual Qi to circulate even faster.

A moment later, the feeling of abdominal pain began to slowly disappear.

Qin Yu could not help but heave a sigh of relief. However, this intense pain did not make Qin Yu shrink back. On the contrary, he picked up more pills and stuffed them into his abdomen.

As long as he could cultivate as soon as possible, this pain was nothing at all.

...

Heavenly Cloud sect.

The eighteen celestials returned to the sect, and the white-robed Daoist’s primordial spirit also returned at the same time.

First Elder rushed out hurriedly. He looked at the white-robed Daoist floating in the air, and his expression could not help but change slightly.

With a closer look, one of the eighteen celestials was actually seriously injured!

This immediately made first elder uneasy. He hurriedly asked, “What’s going on? Where’s Qin Yu?”

“He wasn’t caught,”said the white-robed Daoist.

With a gloomy face, he looked fiercely at the eighteen gods. Gritting his teeth, he said, “These eighteen gods actually want me to die, me!”

At this point, he suddenly shut his mouth again.

The white-robed Daoist suddenly realized a problem. If the first elder knew that he was captured alive by Qin Yu, he would probably be punished.

“What exactly happened? Continue!”The first elder hurriedly asked.

The white-robed Daoist snorted and said, “It’s nothing. I tried my best to escape from the primordial spirit. I’m afraid I’ll have to choose to enter seclusion like guardian Ren.”

After saying this, the white-robed Daoist turned around and left.

First Elder could only cast his gaze at the eighteen gods. However, the eighteen gods did not say a word. They completely ignored first elder.

They brought the injured gods and quickly left the place.

First Elder’s face was ashen. He could not figure out how the white-robed Daoist and the eighteen gods could fail when they attacked at the same time!

“Could it be that Qin Yu is already strong enough to take on the eighteen godly men...”first elder muttered in a low voice. He seemed to have experienced many vicissitudes.

At this moment, Mo Hong also rushed over.

The moment he saw first elder, he said impatiently, “First Elder, our information is wrong. Qin Yu is not at Mount Hua Ning at all! He just returned to Mount Hua Ning today!”

First Elder hurriedly looked at Mo Hong and said, “You saw Qin Yu? How is his condition? Is he injured?”

Mo Hong frowned and scratched his head, “I didn’t pay attention to it, but it doesn’t seem to be a problem...”
