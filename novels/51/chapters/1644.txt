Chapter 1645: Chapter 1,645, battle in three days! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu looked at Xiao Sheng and asked, “Will there be a battle between you and Me?”

Xiao Sheng said indifferently, “Perhaps.”

Qin Yu did not stay any longer. He turned around and left the cultivation mountain.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly understood that this kind of thing should not be placed on others, because no one had that obligation.

At any time, the one who should be relied on was still himself.

Qin Yu walked down from the mountain, and the deputy sect master and the others quickly surrounded him.

“How is it?”They asked impatiently.

Qin Yu glanced at the deputy sect master and said, “In short, you are safe.”

“What do you mean?”The deputy sect master was somewhat puzzled.

Qin Yu did not explain much and turned around to leave the Tianyun sect.

It was peaceful and peaceful inside the sect, but outside the sect, it was chaotic and unbearable.

This wall was like a dividing line, dividing the same world into two worlds.

Countless black-robed men occupied the nearby streets as if they were declaring their sovereignty, dividing the cultivators of the South Province into two classes.

“No matter what, we have to get the painting back immediately,”a black-robed man said coldly on the street.

He seemed to be the small leader of this group, and there was a trace of anxiety and unease on his face.

There was no other reason than that their painting had been lost.

And there was still no news of the person who stole the painting.

At this moment, a black-robed man ran over in a hurry.

He said hurriedly, “We found the painting scroll. It was stolen by a group of young people.”

Hearing this, the small leader’s pupils suddenly constricted. He hurriedly asked, “Where are they?”

“They are in that alley.”

The group did not waste any time. They hurriedly walked towards that alley.

In the alley, there were seven or eight young people who were captured here. Three of them had already lost their lives.

The leader was none other than Ding Yi.

At this moment, he was captured by two black-robed men and was unable to move.

The little leader quickly walked in front of Ding Yi and coldly said, “Where’s the painting scroll?”

Ding Yi sneered. She didn’t say anything and spat on his face!

This immediately angered the little leader. He grabbed Ding Yi’s neck and coldly said, “Do you F * cking want to die?”

Ding Yi’s face turned red and it became extremely difficult for him to breathe.

However, even under such circumstances, she still gritted her teeth and said, “The painting scroll... don’t even think about it!”

“If you don’t hand over the painting scroll, I will torture you to death!”The little leader gnashed his teeth and said.

However, Ding Yi would rather die than surrender. He gritted his teeth and didn’t say a word.

“You don’t know life from Death!”The small leader was completely enraged. Rays of black light circled around his hand. This light finally gathered at the tip of his finger. It looked extremely pure black.

“I want to see how long you can last!”The small leader said coldly.

Then, his finger pressed towards Ding Yi!

However, at this moment, a ray of golden light shot over!

Before the leader could react, his palm exploded on his wrist!

“Ah!”

The leader immediately covered his wrist and screamed in pain!

“Who is it!”

The black-robed man in the alley was shocked and looked around vigilantly.

He saw a young man slowly walking over on the street.

Upon seeing this young man, Ding Yi was instantly overjoyed! She shouted excitedly, “Qin Yu!”

Qin Yu did not say a word as he walked towards the group of black-robed men step by step.

“Qin... Qin Yu? You are Qin Yu? !”The small leader said in panic.

Qin Yu did not say a word. He raised his foot and gently shook it downwards.

“Boom!”

A golden light instantly swept out in all directions!

Before the group of black-robed men could react, they had already exploded into a bloody mist!

Upon seeing this scene, the small leader’s expression immediately turned deathly pale!

He trembled as he looked at Qin Yu. With a trembling voice, he said, “You... you...”

“Don’t worry. I Won’t kill you,”said Qin Yu indifferently.

“Go back and tell your master that I will wait for him at Mount Ying Ning in three days. Of course, if he is afraid, he can bring his people back to the northern lands now,”said Qin Yu coldly.

Hearing this, the small leader couldn’t help but laugh coldly in his heart.

“Qin Yu, you really dare to challenge our master? Do you think you are the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”The small leader couldn’t help but ridicule.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He suddenly raised his hand, and a golden light instantly shot out! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Bang Bang!”

Two crisp sounds exploded in his ears, and the arms of the leader were instantly shattered!

“Ah! ! !”

The leader roared so loudly that his lungs were torn apart, and his knees could not help but kneel on the ground.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “If you dare to talk nonsense again, I will kill you right now.”

That little leader didn’t dare to say anything more. He endured the pain and turned around to run.

After he ran far away, Ding Yi ran to Qin Yu excitedly.

“Qin Yu! I knew you wouldn’t leave!”Ding Yi’s excitement was beyond words. He stood beside Qin Yu excitedly.

Qin Yu glanced at Ding Yi and said, “Why do they want to kill you?”

Ding Yi said somewhat embarrassedly, “Because... I stole one of their paintings.”

“You stole one of their paintings?”Qin Yu was startled.

Ding Yi grunted and said, “These people thought that no one in the South Province dared to go against them, and their actions were full of loopholes, so I took the opportunity to steal one of their paintings and hide it.”

Speaking up to this point, Ding Yi said excitedly, “Let’s go, I’ll take you to get it!”

Following that, Qin Yu followed behind Ding Yi and rushed towards the location where the painting scroll was hidden.

The location where the painting scroll was hidden was extremely hidden. The two of them walked in circles for a long time before finally stopping in front of an ancient well.

“The painting scroll is hidden here?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Ding Yi grunted. She pointed at the discounted ancient well and said, “This ancient well has been there for many years. I just threw it down. I don’t know if the painting scroll is still there.”

Qin Yu did not say anything. He activated the desolate God’s eye and looked at the ancient well.

With the help of the desolate God’s eye, Qin Yu’s gaze went straight to the bottom of the well!

He saw that the painting was still at the bottom of the well, motionless.

“This painting... might be able to allow me to enter the middle stage of the mighty figure realm,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

One had to know that a person’s spiritual power and divine sense were the fastest to increase one’s cultivation level!

Therefore, Qin Yu did not think any further. He immediately jumped down and sank into the ancient well.

On the other side.

That little leader rushed to Teng men and reported this matter to the godly monarch.

In the cultivation room, the godly monarch stood beside him and said in a low voice, “Master, Qin Yu has issued a challenge to you. He has asked you to fight in Mount Ying Ning in three days.”
