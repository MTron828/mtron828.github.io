Chapter 1558: Chapter 1,558, he teng! 1

Zhong Wu’s face was filled with madness, but Qin Yu’s heart was also somewhat solemn.

He wasn’t as relaxed as he looked on the surface. After all, the white bone staff was a saint weapon. Even if it wasn’t resurrected, its power was unimaginable.

Just now, Qin Yu had relied on his sturdy body to withstand the staff, but his fist was in pain.

Zhong Wu had been sitting on the white bone staff for so long, so it was impossible for him not to have learned something.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu directly opened the fifth level of the fighting word formula.

Then, he reached out with his palm and held the iron rod in his hand.

At this moment, Qin Yu was like a god of war, extremely powerful.

The internal Qi on his body was extremely terrifying, and everything under his feet was shattered into dust. Golden Light surged out of his body.

“So this is Qin Yu’s true strength...”the surrounding crowd felt the terrifying pressure on Qin Yu and were all greatly shocked.

Zhong Wu, who was already extremely afraid, turned even paler at this moment.

Even the hand holding the white bone staff was trembling slightly.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Zhong wu and said, “Let’s end this battle quickly. Don’t waste any more time.”

Zhong Wu knew that this battle was unavoidable, so he could only brace himself and fight.

......

“Qin Yu, you’re going too far...”Zhong Wu grabbed the white bone staff with both hands, and all of his internal Qi poured into the white bone staff!

In an instant, the white bone staff flashed with light, and in the next second, strands of internal QI floated out.

This internal Qi lingered on the white bone staff, and Qin Yu actually felt a familiar scent.

“This... This actually has a hint of holy might.”Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

The internal Qi emitted from the white bone staff was indeed like a strand of holy might.

Although it was not as heavy and terrifying as a wisp of internal QI, the smell was exactly the same as what Qin Yu had felt in the sacred tomb!

“It seems that I have underestimated this white bone staff...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

He glanced at the iron staff in his hand and tried to merge his internal Qi into the staff. Unfortunately, the staff did not respond.

“Although this white bone rod has not been resurrected, it is not as silent as the iron rod in my hand,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Qin Yu, be careful!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Just as he was thinking, Zhong Wu grabbed the white bone rod and smashed it at Qin Yu!

The power of the white bone rod that was emitting light was suddenly different. It passed through the Void and came straight at Qin Yu. There was nowhere to hide!

The staff had yet to arrive, but that terrifying pressure was already coming right at him!

Qin Yu naturally did not dare to be negligent. He grabbed the iron staff in his hand and immediately went up to meet it.

“Clang!”

At the moment of contact, a deafening crisp sound was heard. The terrifying residual power was like water ripples, sweeping out in all directions!

Qin Yu only felt pain in his wrist, and the iron staff was trembling incessantly from the beating!

“As expected of being tainted with a trace of holy might...”Qin Yu was extremely shocked!

One had to know that this white bone rod was not tainted with the true holy might, it only revealed a trace of holy might!

But even so, its power was still incomparable, incomparably terrifying!

No wonder even a colossus like the Heavenly Cloud Sect was unwilling to become enemies with the hunter organization. Other than the uniqueness of the hunter organization, this white bone rod was also an extremely important reason!

“Go to hell!”

As he said this, Zhong Wu once again came with the white bone staff in his hand!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He held the iron staff with both hands and fiercely welcomed him.

Under the support of the white bone staff, this Zhong Wu was actually able to be on par with Qin Yu.

The two of them fought from the ground into the void and then fell out from the void. The terrifying explosion was like thunder coming from the void, extremely ear-piercing.

Everyone looked at the scene in front of them and was at a loss for what to do.

Qin Yu’s strength was unimaginable, and the power of the white bone club was even more unfathomable.

However, only Zhong Wu knew in his heart that if this continued, the one who would die would definitely be him!

Although he had the white bone club in his hand, it was not his own strength after all. He would only become weaker and weaker as he fought.

On the other hand, Qin Yu did not show any signs of internal Qi. On the contrary, he became more and more courageous as he fought. He was like an undefeatable god of war, extremely terrifying!

“Qin Yu, go to Hell!”

Zhong wu bared his teeth and grabbed the white bone staff and smashed it at Qin Yu.

However, in this collision, Zhong Wu did not get any benefits. On the contrary, he was forced back a few steps!

“Clang!”

Qin Yu smashed the iron staff in his hand onto the ground. His hair danced wildly as he said coldly, “Come!”

Zhong Wu’s heart was filled with terror. He could not figure out why Qin Yu was becoming more and more courageous as he fought. Why was he able to resist the holy weapon? How did he do it!

“Putting the white bone in your hand is simply a reckless waste of a god’s gift,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu understood in his heart that as long as this white bone rod emitted a wisp of true holy might, it was not something Qin Yu could resist.

Just a wisp of holy might was enough to kill Qin Yu!

But unfortunately, the white bone staff was only tainted with a trace of holy might and did not have the true holy might’s blessing.

“Qin Yu, I’ll give you the white bone staff and you can spare my life.”Zhong wu gritted his teeth and said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You’ll definitely lose. What qualifications do you have to negotiate with me!”

“Qin Yu, if you want to force me, at most we will die together!”Zhong Wu grabbed the white bone club, his face showing madness.

“Die together? Do you have the ability?”Qin Yu’s body was full of fighting spirit, and Golden Light appeared!

Everyone was convinced by Qin Yu’s aura, and Zhong Wu was even more terrified.

“Qin Yu is right. It is indeed a pity that the white bone club is in your hands...”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the dark.

In the next second, black mist floated up and a black wormhole suddenly appeared behind Zhong Wu!

Qin Yu’s expression changed and he immediately felt that something was wrong.

Without thinking, he grabbed the iron club in his hand and smashed it fiercely!

Even though Qin Yu reacted quickly, it was still too late.

A large hand reached out and grabbed Zhong Wu into the void.

“Hehe... Qin Yu, thank you for Your Gift...”

This voice was extremely familiar. Who else could it be other than he teng?

“Damn it, he teng, don’t even think about running away!”Qin Yu was instantly enraged.

He immediately activated his desolate divine eye and scanned his surroundings.

However, he Teng’s spatial spell was truly brilliant. In an instant, he disappeared without a trace.

The sudden change of events made everyone dumbfounded.

“Qin Yu, Zhong Wu... escaped?”Jing Bai quickly walked forward and asked.

Qin Yu’s face was gloomy. He shook his head and said, “The situation has become more complicated...”

“Who was that voice just now? Do You Know Him?”Guan Zhuang asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “That was a guy who was a hundred times more difficult to deal with than Zhong Wu...”

If the white bone club fell into he Teng’s hands, it would definitely be very bad news.
