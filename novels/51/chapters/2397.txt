2398 Killing Again

“Today, none of those stained with the blood of our Thunder Courtyard’s cultivators can leave!”

The blood on Qin Yu’s fist dripped onto the ground.

Thunderbolt Shocking Light Escape Technique.

The sound of electric arcs suddenly rang out. In almost a breath, the heads of the dozens of cultivators of the three families in Flower Peak instantly exploded. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Just before they died, they only saw a flash of lightning before them, and then they lost their consciousness.

After the power of lightning tempered Qin Yu’s Glazed Holy Bod, the energy that burst out from it alone had already reached the Tribulation First Level of the Way of Heaven and Earth. Coupled with Immortal Emperor Lei’s escape technique, the highest cultivation of these people was at the ninth-grade True Saint. They were almost no match for him.

“Senior Brother Qin Yu, you must avenge Senior Sister and the others!”

A little girl from Flower Peak walked over. Her eyes were red, and she had been stabbed in the chest. The blood flowing out of the wound had dyed her clothes red.

“Don’t worry. No one can leave.”

Qin Yu’s body moved, and he was already heading toward Demon-slaying Peak.

“Demon-slaying Peak Master, don’t advise me not to attack.”

On the way, the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak had already brought almost everyone to help in Flower Peak.

However, a group of people from the Jiang family suddenly appeared and stopped them. A lazy voice said.

“The three Holy Lords have gathered. You don’t think we’re just here to shop around, do you?”

“Jiang Tian!”

The peak master’s voice sounded heavy. This most talented elder of the Jiang family had already reached the peak of the ninth-grade True Saint. In just 500 years, he was also the youngest elder of the Jiang family.

He was just about to go and help but was held back by Jiang Tian.

Even if he risked his life, he could not break through Jiang Tian’s defense at all.

“Our target is Qin Yu. It has nothing to do with Thunder Courtyard.

“However, if you insist on courting death, I don’t mind sending you off.”

Jiang Tian suddenly slashed his sword behind him. A sword light as thin as a thread instantly exploded a thousand meters away.

The two cultivators madly rushing to Flower Peak were suddenly split into two in the air. In an instant, their internal organs fell to the ground.

“I’ll stop Jiang Tian. You guys rush over and share some pressure on Qin Yu.”

The peak master said in a deep voice. The kid who climbed the stairway to heaven with a severely injured body must not die in Thunder Courtyard.

“You can’t stop me and they can’t go over either.”

Jiang Tian frowned.

“Breaking Evil!”

The peak master roared like a wild beast, his fist filled with unwavering determination.

This was the unstoppable fist intent of the Demon-slaying Peak, unafraid of evil forces.

Under the condensation of this fist intent, the power of this punch rose from the ninth grade to the peak.

“Boom!”

Before the fist arrived, the wind from the fist had already blasted the entire ground apart.

“The strength is enough, but the speed is too slow.”

With a strange fluctuation of the body, Jiang Tian avoided the peak master’s locked internal qi and arrived beside him in an instant.

A green sword energy as thin as a strand of hair lit up.

The peak master’s arm, which had thrown out a punch, was suddenly chopped down.

“Whoosh!”

At the same time, Jiang Tian swung his sword at the peak master’s legs again.

The peak master’s legs separated from his body.

“Is the gap so big?”

The peak master closed his eyes in despair. He lost his balance and fell to the ground.

“Then you won’t think about helping up anymore, right? Thunder Courtyard was only so-so. Was this the strength of the peak master?”

Jiang Tian stepped on the Peak Master’s face.

“I don’t know why the family head has repeatedly stressed that we must be careful. Jiang Tian alone is enough to kill all of Demon-slaying Peak. If Qin Yu hadn’t run away quickly, he would probably have been defeated under Elder Tian’s sword.”

Jiang Tian was about to say something when his expression changed drastically in the next moment. The green sword was placed horizontally in front of him.

A scorching light flashed before his eyes, and a massive force blasted him back, causing him to vomit blood.

“Peak Master, I’m late!”

Qin Yu hugged the peak master and said with a choked voice.

“I’m fine. Are Ruoxue and the others alright?”

The peak master waved his hand, completely unconcerned about his injuries.

“We’ll talk about this later. Let me kill all these small fry first.”

Qin Yu looked at the fallen brothers and sisters of Demon-slaying Peak, and his anger rose to the extreme.

“Haha, I heard that you killed Ni Wuxiao in purgatory. But since you’ve given away your Suo Lin, I think you’re just ordinary without external things.”

Jiang Tian spat out a mouthful of blood. He licked the blood flowing out of the corner of his mouth, and a trace of madness flashed in his eyes.

He did not believe this wild kid would be stronger than him, Jiang Tian.

A force that was hard to detect with the naked eye surged from his body.

Jiang Tian’s hand moved slightly, and he slashed out thousands of swords.

Thousands of green threads arrived in an instant, forming a massive sword net. He wanted to use this sword net to grind Qin Yu into pieces straightaway.

Qin Yu looked at the sword net indifferently, allowing it to hit his body.

A cruel smile appeared on Jiang Tian’s face. This divine sword could condense all the power into the hair-thin sword energy, which allowed him to unleash the power of a half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage at the peak of the ninth grade.

“Boom!”

An enormous explosion sounded on his body. Qin Yu patted the dust off his body.

He stepped forward and instantly arrived in front of Jiang Tian. His five fingers grabbed Jiang Tian’s face.

Then, he slightly exerted force, and Jiang Tian’s head instantly exploded.

“You actually killed Elder Jiang Tian?”

The members of the Jiang family were shocked.

“This Way of the Sword is not bad. Combined with the Thunderbolt Shocking Light Escape Technique, it should be much faster in killing people.”

Qin Yu picked up the green sword from Jiang Tian’s corpse.

He formed a hand seal of the Thunderbolt Shocking Light Escape Technique, and his body moved like lightning. The escape technique that Qin Yu had just comprehended was even faster than the line word formula.

Holding the green sword in his hand, he reaped the heads of the Jiang family members like a god of death.

Many people did not even have the time to take out their protective treasures before they felt the world before their eyes turned black. In their last moments, they saw a familiar headless body, their vision turned black, and they fell into complete darkness.

In less than ten breaths, 30 members of the Jiang family or so were lying in a pool of blood. Almost all of them were cultivators above the fourth-grade True Saint.

However, facing Qin Yu, whose physical strength had reached the power of tribulation, they were like a flock of sheep.

“He has really become stronger.”

The peak master leaned against a stone wall and said in shock.

Seeing was believing. After witnessing Qin Yu’s strength, the shock was even more indescribable.

At this moment, Lei Xin, Flower Granny, Holy Lord Yao, Holy Lord Jiang, and Holy Lord Yun unleashed their real fire.

Lei Xin wielded the celestial artifact, the Thunder Staff, and as he waved it, the thunderbolts fell from the sky.

If it weren’t for the Yun family’s Heaven-sealing Ord’s amazing defensive abilities, no one could have withstood the terrifying power of the lightning.

The three had lived for many years, and the three celestial artifacts were unleashed to their limits in their hands.

Even though the three were weaker than Lei Xin and Flower Granny, they could still fight back and forth. There was nothing Lei Xin and Flower Granny could do.

“Haha, don’t be anxious. Once Yao Xi has captured Qin Yu, we will naturally retreat.”

Holy Lord Yao laughed loudly.
