Chapter 949: Chapter 949, experiencing the same pain

Following that, Gu Xinghe began his preparations.

He brought the relevant staff of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to the prison where Qin Yu was imprisoned.

Seeing these people, Qin Yu immediately had a bad premonition.

“What do you want to Do!”Qin Yu said coldly.

Gu Xinghe pointed at the equipment with his chin and sneered, “I’m going to use you to do an experiment.”

“This is all Yan Jinyao’s suggestion, right?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but grit his teeth.

Gu Xinghe said indifferently, “That’s right, but you have to thank Yan Jinyao. At least this way, your life will be saved.”

With that, the door slowly opened.

A few people swarmed forward and brought Qin Yu to the equipment.

Then, they grabbed the few tubes and covered Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu tried to struggle, but his body was extremely weak and he couldn’t break free!

He watched helplessly as the tubes were inserted into his body!

One, two, three... ! In the blink of an eye, eighteen tubes were inserted into Qin Yu’s body!

“HMM, not bad, it looks like it.”Gu Xinghe stood outside the prison and smiled faintly.

Qin Yu glared at Gu Xinghe and struggled desperately.

But at this moment, Qin Yu realized that these tubes seemed to have set some kind of spell that could restrict the spiritual power in Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu, who was already weak, was now even more powerless to resist!

“There are only two people who have used this equipment. One Is You, and the other is Yan Ruoxue.”Gu Xinghe smiled faintly.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said nothing.

He did not know what kind of pain he would face next, nor did he know what kind of Pain Yan Ruoxue had suffered in the past.

At this moment, Yan Jinyao waved his hand, indicating for the equipment to be activated.

As the equipment was activated, the eighteen tubes inserted into his body suddenly flashed with light!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s face instantly became distorted!

The pain in his body made Qin Yu Gape. It was a fate worse than death!

“Ah! ! !”

Even Qin Yu, who had suffered countless pains, could not help but scream out in pain!

This pain was indescribable, and it was even more painful than any pain qin Yu had suffered!

“AH...”

Because of the pain, Qin Yu’s entire body was convulsing!

“So... Ruoxue has been enduring this kind of torture...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, and his heart immediately became even angrier!

He had only just started, and he already couldn’t take it anymore, while Yan Ruoxue had been on this equipment for a year!

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association... I will definitely have you all killed!”Qin Yu’s eyeballs bulged out, and the veins on his forehead bulged out.

It was unknown whether it was because of pain or anger.

Soon, Qin Yu fainted from the pain.

Outside the door, Gu Xinghe couldn’t help clapping his hands and said, “It seems that the rumors are true. This thing is really painful.”

Then, he looked at the two people beside him and said, “You two stay here and guard. As long as you have enough blood, send it to me immediately.”

“Yes, Young Master Gu!”

Gu Xinghe didn’t stay any longer and turned to leave.

In the prison, many prisoners couldn’t help but sigh.

“Yan Ruoxue once suffered this kind of pain. I didn’t expect it to be Qin Yu’s turn again today,”someone whispered.

“Everyone says that we are unpardonable evil people, but in the end, the Jingdu martial arts association is even more disgusting.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Sigh, up until now, not a single person who went against them has had a good ending.”

...

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu finally woke up.

However, the intense pain that he had just woken up caused Qin Yu to almost faint again.

This kind of pain truly exceeded the limits of what humans could endure!

However, to Qin Yu, the pain in his body was far inferior to the pain in his heart.

He could not imagine how Yan Ruoxue had endured it back then!

A girl who was born into a wealthy family had to endure such pain for a year!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu’s body could not help but tremble slightly.

“Ruoxue...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

The pain in his heart had even caused Qin Yu to temporarily forget the pain in his body.

The blood in his body was still flowing out, and he did not know where it went.

Qin Yu only knew that his body was getting weaker and weaker.

...

In a no man’s land in the northwest.

This place was originally flat, but now a sect had been established.

Standing at the gate of the sect were not people, but two white bones!

“Not enough, far from enough!”

Inside the sect, Tian Xuehong suddenly opened his eyes.

He slowly stood up and said in a cold voice, “According to this progress, it will take a long time for me to recover to my peak condition!”

Tian Xuehong’s face was extremely gloomy, but there was a trace of evil mixed in it.

He was preparing a plan.

A plan to devour all the martial artists!

“I want to turn the world into an Asura Field!”Tian Xuehong said with narrowed eyes.

“When my formation is completed, all the martial artists will become my nourishment!”

But before that, Tian Xuehong had to do another thing.

In his current state, it was naturally extremely difficult for him to set up such a formation.

Thus, he wanted to use the JINGDU martial arts association to increase his strength.

...

Inside the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Tian Xuehong and Gu Xinghe were sitting opposite each other.

“What’s the matter?”Gu Xinghe asked.

Tian Xuehong knocked on the table and said, “There is indeed something I need your help with.”

“What is it?”Gu Xinghe was a little displeased.

Ever since the spirit stone mine was taken over by Tian Xuehong, Gu Xinghe was even more displeased with Tian Xuehong.

Tian Xuehong smiled faintly and said, “I heard that the Jingdu martial arts association is holding a lot of prisoners, right?”

Gu Xinghe frowned slightly and asked in a deep voice, “What do you mean?”

Tian xuehong said indifferently, “It’s a waste to hold them anyway. Why Don’t you hand them over to me? They are useful to me.”

“Are You Dreaming?”Gu Xinghe was instantly furious!

Hand the prisoners over to him? Then where would the face of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association Go?

Tian Xuehong was not in a hurry. He said with a faint smile, “Young master Gu, think carefully. I’m discussing with you now, but in a few days, it won’t be a discussion.”

“Are you threatening me?”Gu Xinghe’s face was dark.

Tian xuehong snorted lightly, “You can understand it that way.”

“Do you think I’m Scared? Do you really think I’m easy to bully!”Gu Xinghe shouted angrily.

Tian xuehong sneered, “There are only three martial saints by your side. Other than Zhai Xing, the other two are not worth mentioning at all.”

“And my skeleton army has dozens of people!”

“I gave you face, so I came to discuss with you. If I’m not happy, I can even uproot your Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”
