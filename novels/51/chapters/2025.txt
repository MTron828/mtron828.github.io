2026 Elder Si Died!

“Elder Si… really going to lose!”

“Elder Si will surely die if this palm lands!”

In the dark, Xiao Hai could not help but sigh with emotion. Even if this palm landed on his body, he would probably also die here.

“Ah!”

The entire killing formation was full of hoarse wails. The gigantic palm formed by the killing intent finally landed on Elder Si’s body, instantly pressing him into the ground. The ground instantly exploded, and cracks crisscrossed, accompanied by an earth-shattering boom!

Elder Si’s body was almost instantly crushed into shreds, and his physical body was constantly crumbling!

No one would have imagined this to be the outcome of the battle. Qin Yu had actually defeated a Semi-Saint and the Third Elder of the Si family!

“Clack!”

At this moment, a crisp sound suddenly came from within the killing formation.

Then the internal qi in the Endless Killing Formation dissipated at a speed visible to the naked eye!

The gigantic body that Qin Yu had transformed into with his killing intent also slowly disappeared without a trace!

“Thud!”

Qin Yu fell out of the killing formation. His face was ashen, his entire body trembling, and his eyeballs almost bulged. Obviously, his mental strength had been exhausted to the extreme!

“What… What’s going on?” someone asked in confusion.

“That palm was about to suppress Elder Si, but…Why did the formation suddenly collapse?”

The entire killing formation was collapsing at a speed visible to the naked eye. In just a while, the killing formation disappeared without a trace.

Following Qin Yu’s gaze, they saw that a magical artifact at a formation core had shattered.

It was unknown if the magical artifact was too weak or if the power of the formation was too strong. In the end, the magical artifact could not withstand it, causing the entire formation to collapse completely!

“Hahaha!”

Elder Si, covered in blood, stood up with difficulty. He laughed crazily and said, “Just a little bit more! Just a little bit more, and you could have killed me. Hahaha! It is the will of heaven. I shouldn’t die!”

Looking at Elder Si, who had just escaped death, Qin Yu was silent. His body swayed as if he would fall at any moment.

Even if Elder Si was lucky enough to survive, he suffered tremendously severe injuries. It was likely he could not pose a threat to Qin Yu.

“This battle… Is it considered a draw…”

“Maybe. Both of them have no combat strength left.”

“Sigh! It’s a pity that it’s so close! At this critical moment, the magical artifact of the formation core actually shattered…”

Someone walked into the killing formation and supported Elder Si up, saying, “Elder Si, hurry up and leave.”

Elder Si kept vomiting blood. Although he was severely injured, the madness in his eyes did not diminish.

“Qin Yu! You have some ability, but unfortunately, I survived!” Elder Si shouted at Qin Yu with all his might.

“We’ll meet again in the future. The Si family will definitely not let you off!”

After saying this, Elder Si turned around and was about to leave!

However, at this moment, a golden light suddenly arrived in front of Elder Si in the blink of an eye!

Looking carefully, the person who came was Qin Yu!

The last of the Golden Light emerged from his body. His thorn-like fist smashed fiercely toward Elder Si’s head!

“Clack!”

Elder Si’s pupils kept enlarging. In his horror, his head was shattered by Qin Yu’s punch!

“I didn’t say… to let you go…” Qin Yu was in a daze. He relied on his powerful willpower to deliver the final blow!

No one had expected Qin Yu to actually still make a move in such a state and even kill Elder Si!

The scene fell silent. They couldn’t believe what they saw!

Qin Yu’s body kept shaking. In the next second, he finally couldn’t hold on anymore and fell to the ground fiercely, stirring up a wave of dust.

In the crowd, someone shouted excitedly, “Qin Yu won! He really won!”

“This is unbelievable! He defeated the Third Elder of the Si family!”

“This battle will shock everyone. Qin Yu will rise and change the world!”

The surrounding crowd discussed animatedly. Their gazes were full of admiration and surprise.

Xiao Hai silently walked up to Qin Yu. He looked at Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, nearly exhausted, a trace of admiration appeared in his eyes.

“You’re really a fellow that surprises everyone,” Xiao Hai said in a low voice.

After that, he picked Qin Yu up and planned to leave.

However, at this moment, the Si family’s attendant stepped forward and blocked Xiao Hai’s path.

“Put Qin Yu down,” one of the attendants said coldly.

Xiao Hai looked at them and said calmly, “Why?”

“He killed the Third Eder of the Si family. We naturally have to bring him back to the Si family,” one of the attendants said coldly.

“This is the Si family’s business. You’d better not interfere, or you’ll get into trouble,” another attendant warned.

Xiao Hai’s expression was still calm. He hugged Qin Yu with one hand and said, “What if I disagree?”

“Then you will die here too!” the attendant shouted, his eyes revealing a crazy killing intent!

“I, Xiao Hai, have never been afraid of anyone. Come at me!” Xiao Hai laughed.

...

As soon as he finished speaking, a powerful internal qi erupted from Xiao Hai’s body!

His move was as simple and crude as ever. With a wave of his hand, a huge hand came over, covering the sky and earth!

Under everyone’s gaze, Xiao Hai slapped his palm toward everyone!

A shocking scene happened. These attendants used all their techniques, but none could stop him!

In just half a second, all these attendants were killed by Xiao Hai’s palm!

Everyone was stunned. They did not expect Xiao Hai to be so powerful!

“This Divine Fortuity City…There are really hidden dragons and crouching tigers here.” Someone sighed with emotion.

“Ever since the Chaos Grave surfaced, quite many experts were indeed hiding in Divine Fortuity City.”

They looked at Xiao Hai’s broad and tall body with strange expressions.

Xiao Hai held Qin Yu in his arms and looked at the surrounding crowd. He said quietly, “I just want to take him away from here. If anyone dares to block my way, come at me!”

However, no one dared to block Xiao Hai’s path.

...

The surroundings were silent. They looked at Xiao Hai without saying a word.

Such a shocking battle made everyone understand that Qin Yu and Xiao Hai were not to be trifled with.

The two soon disappeared from everyone’s sight. Xiao Hai’s footsteps were incredibly fast. In just a few flashes, he disappeared without a trace.

When Qin Yu woke up, he was lying on a bed.

The surroundings were silent. Following his gaze, he could see the sparkling water surface outside.

This seemed to be a wooden house, a wooden house that stood on the water.

Qin Yu rubbed his head and tried to get up. However, the moment he got up, the world in front of him began to shake. Obviously, this battle had seriously exhausted his mental strength
