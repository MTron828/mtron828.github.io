Chapter 1526: Chapter 1,526, power of the Domain 1

Azure Flame Slash was incomparably terrifying! Even Sima Bei’s face flashed with a trace of shock!

Although Zhuo Jing’s technique was far inferior to his father’s, its power still caused people to feel a trace of fear!

Seeing the sword light that was like flames approaching, Sima Bei’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Even someone as powerful as him did not dare to underestimate it.

He raised his palm slightly and his internal Qi rose rapidly. His body began to glow as if he was releasing a terrifying domain.

The void trembled as if it was a sign that this technique was divine and extraordinary.

This was indeed a divine domain power. Under Sima Bei’s display, it was as if he was in control of the laws of the world.

His body floated with a boundless radiance that surrounded his body. Each radiance carried the power to shatter the world!

The moment the azure flame slash collided with it, numerous mountains collapsed!

The originally incomparably hard rock was now as fragile as a piece of paper.

Sima bei continued to evolve his dao technique. This was the power that he had comprehended the laws of the world. It was definitely not something that ordinary spells could compare to!

Zhuo Jing, who was in the distance, also felt that something was amiss. Even though he held the Silver Spring in his hand, he still felt a huge pressure when facing Sima bei!

Sima bei was the same! Even though his cultivation and spells were far above Zhuo Jing’s, the Silver Spring in Zhuo Jing’s hand was too extraordinary. Even he did not dare to be the slightest bit negligent!

......

“Rumble...”

The two spells collided, but Thunder rumbled unceasingly in the sky. It was as if the heavenly tribulation was going to descend at any moment.

Zhuo Jing looked in Qin Yu’s direction, his heart filled with impatience.

This was only the fourth heavenly tribulation, and Qin Yu still had to face five more heavenly tribulation!

“I don’t know if I can hold on...”Zhuo Jing thought in a low voice.

The Green Flame Slash had already been turned into nothingness by Sima bei’s spells, as if nothing had happened.

Even if Zhuo Jing was holding a virtual entity sword in his hand, he still couldn’t do anything to Sima Bei!

Sima bei stood high up in the sky. His black robe seemed even more mysterious under the dark clouds.

His vulture-like eyes were coldly looking at Zhuo Jing.

“Your strength is not bad. Why Don’t you submit to the Northern Lands?”Sima bei said indifferently.

Zhuo Jing stretched out his hand and waved his long sword. He replied coldly, “Don’t even think about it!”

Sima bei sighed slightly and said, “Then I can only endure the pain and kill you.”

After saying that, Sima bei raised his hands again, and the boundless radiance on his body appeared once again!

This was an evolved dao technique, and it was extremely powerful. Once one understood the DAO technique, they would be able to evolve a myriad of Dao Techniques!

No one knew what Sima Bei would do next!

That myriad of Radiance made Zhuo Jing extremely nervous.

He took two steps back, tightly holding the silver spring in his hand.

At this moment, Zhuo Jing’s expression suddenly changed! He clearly felt that his body seemed to be restricted! He could clearly move, but he couldn’t feel anything!

“This is bad!”Zhuo Jing thought to himself!

Before he could react, Sima bei had already arrived!

He looked at Zhuo Jing coldly and said, “You are like a fish on a chopping board, how can you fight with me?”

Zhuo Jing’s expression was extremely unsightly. He mobilized the internal Qi in his entire body as if he was trying his best to restore the connection with his physical body.

This was an extremely terrifying technique. It was as if he had severed the connection between his divine sense and his physical body. It was difficult to deal with!

“How about it? Do you want to consider submitting to me? In the northern lands, I can give you what you want.”Sima bei said indifferently.

Zhuo Jing raised his head to look at Sima bei in front of him. Then, he grinned and said, “You... Dream On!”

It was at this moment that Zhuo Jing relied on his powerful willpower to recover his physical body!

At such a close distance, Zhuo Jing would not miss it. He held the Silver Spring in his hand and suddenly stabbed it into Sima Bei’s chest!

“PFFT!”

Sima Bei’s face was filled with disbelief. His mouth suddenly spat out fresh blood!

“You... you...”Sima bei lowered his head and looked at his chest, as if he couldn’t believe what was happening in front of him!

Just as Zhuo Jing was overjoyed, the Sima bei in front of him disappeared!

At a glance, Sima bei was still standing in the distance, looking at Zhuo Jing coldly.

“What... What’s going on?”Zhuo Jing’s expression changed drastically!

Sima bei said with a hint of mockery, “Do you really think you can kill me? This is the power of a domain, and you’ll never be able to comprehend it.”

Zhuo Jing’s expression became even more unsightly. This kind of technique had already exceeded his knowledge. He had no way of dealing with it!

“His body is shining with light. Everything seems to be unreal...”Zhuo Jing thought to himself.

The feeling of reality just now made Zhuo Jing not doubt it at all. He couldn’t even doubt it!

As such, Zhuo Jing didn’t even know if everything before him was real or fake!

Crack

Just as the two of them were fighting, the fourth heavenly tribulation arrived.

The terrifying heavenly tribulation drowned everything, and even Sima Bei and Zhuo Jing weren’t spared.

Seeing this, the two of them immediately shot back and escaped from the range of the heavenly tribulation.

This gave the nervous zhuo jing a bit of a breather.

The two of them looked in the direction of Qin Yu.

The heavenly tribulation was like a true dragon that was about to descend. Everything it passed through was destroyed!

This power was not something that humans could withstand. It was the true power of Heaven and earth!

Qin Yu looked up at the heavenly tribulation that was about to fall. He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “I can’t withstand it with my physical body. I Can’t wait any longer!”

All of Qin Yu’s spells were activated at this moment. He stretched out his palm, and the iron rod was in his hand! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This black iron rod was simple and unadorned. There was nothing special about it, but it made people feel that this rod had an extremely mysterious power!

“Oh? There’s a treasure?”Sima bei, who was not far away, could not help but be a little surprised when he saw this.

Qin Yu grabbed the iron rod, and his internal Qi surged to the extreme!

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have fused with the iron rod as he directly faced the heavenly tribulation!

“Boom!”

At the moment of contact, the iron rod emitted an extremely powerful radiance!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s spiritual power was an explosion of strength!

But even so, it was still insignificant in front of the heavenly tribulation!

The power of the Heavenly Tribulation Shook Qin Yu until he was forced back repeatedly, and his entire body was covered in fresh blood! His entire body was enveloped by the power of the Heavenly Tribulation, and his body was almost burnt to a crisp!

If not for the support of his strong will, Qin Yu would have been reduced to a pile of bones!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu endured the pain in his body, and his roar spread throughout the world!

“I... Can’t hold on any longer...”

Qin Yu was in extreme pain, and the power in his body had almost disappeared. He could no longer fight against a divine rank expert!

“Am I going to fail...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, his face revealing despair.

If he failed, he and Zhuo Jing would die here today!

Just as Qin Yu was about to fall, the iron rod suddenly bloomed with boundless radiance!
