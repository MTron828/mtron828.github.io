Chapter 932: Chapter 932, one step ahead of you! 

It had to be said that this guy with the handlebar moustache was indeed smart!

Before they went to the spirit stone mine, they had to quickly steal everything!

“Hurry up and leave. It’ll be troublesome if we’re discovered,”the handlebar moustache grumbled.

“After stealing, we have to find a place to hide.”

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly and followed behind the handlebar moustache.

The two of them arrived at a formation.

This formation was the one that allowed them to enter the Spirit Stone Mine!

“Through this formation and the formation I set up in the Spirit Stone Mine, we will be able to successfully enter the Spirit Stone Mine.”The moustache stroked his beard and said proudly.

Qin Yu urged, “Don’t waste any more time. Hurry up.”

The mustached man grunted and stood in front of the formation, muttering a spell.

In a short while, rays of light flashed past, and the formation opened its entrance.

“Hurry Up!”The mustached man urged.

Qin Yu grunted and didn’t waste time. He followed behind the mustached man and stepped into the formation.

With the dizziness in front of his eyes, Qin Yu only felt his body moving rapidly.

After more than ten minutes, when Qin Yu opened his eyes again, he had already fallen into a huge pit that was like a volcano!

In the deep pit, there were threads of dense qi/spiritual energy and bursts of light that were like flames.

Under this light, the bodies of the two people sizzled, as if they were about to be burned to ashes.

“Hiss, it’s still a little hot.”The handlebar mustache muttered.

Qin Yu ignored the heat on his body.

Because his gaze was attracted by the scene in front of him!

He saw that in front of the two of them, there was a dazzling light!

One by one, spirit stones that were like diamonds were placed in front of the two of them!

With such a huge amount of spirit stones, even Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer.

“I’m Rich, I’m Rich!”Qin Yu grabbed a spirit stone, extremely excited!

Any one of these spiritual stones contained extremely pure Qi/spiritual energy.

As long as he got this batch of spiritual stones, he would never have to worry about it again!

“There are more spiritual stones than I expected,”the mustached man said while stroking his beard.

“Hurry up and put these spiritual stones into the spatial artifact,”Qin Yu said excitedly.

The mustached man rolled his eyes and said, “What are you so anxious for? ! Although we’ve entered, we still need to think of a way out in advance.”

“What do you mean?”Qin Yu said with some doubt.

The moustache man said, “If they set up some kind of spell here, we might be discovered if we take away a large amount of spirit stones.”

“So... I have to step down the formation to make it easier for us to escape.”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “That makes sense. How long will it take?”

The Mustache Man counted with his fingers and said, “Normally, it will take at least five hours, but the spirit stones here can be used as materials to shorten the time...”

He calculated for a moment and then said, “Two hours.”

“Okay, then let’s hurry up,”Qin Yu hurriedly said.

The Mustache Man didn’t say anything more. He grabbed a few spirit stones and began to set up the formation.

Qin Yu looked around.

This huge pit was extremely huge. Looking Up, it looked like a volcano.

There were at least hundreds of thousands of spirit stones in the entire mine, and any one of them had effects that far exceeded the effects of five thousand years of herbs!

I really don’t know how such a huge spirit stone mine was formed, Qin Yu thought to himself.

He took a deep breath and felt the rich qi/spiritual energy that was emitted.

At the same time, Qin Yu released his spiritual sense to cover the surroundings.

Under Qin Yu’s spiritual sense, he found at least eight people.

These eight people were all in the Martial Marquis realm. They must have been left behind by the various secret realms and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to guard them.

However, Qin Yu did not care. As long as they were not martial saints, there was no need to be afraid.

At this moment, Tian Xuehong and Gu Xinghe were negotiating.

Only Tian Xuehong and Gu Xinghe were in the office.

Zhai Xing and the others were guarding outside.

About an hour later, the two of them walked out of the office.

The two of them were chatting happily and looked quite satisfied.

“I hope we can work well together,”Gu Xinghe said with a smile.

Tian Xuehong nodded slightly and said, “I hope so.”

After saying this, Tian Xuehong turned around and left.

After he left, Zhai Xing asked impatiently, “Young master Gu, what did you promise him?”

Gu Xinghe narrowed his eyes and said, “Nothing. I only promised him that the Jingdu martial arts association would not interfere in anything he did. When necessary, they would help him.”

“At the same time, I want to give him half of the spirit stone mine.”

Zhai xing frowned and said, “This person’s strength is unparalleled. No one can guarantee what he will do...”

“As long as he doesn’t affect us, that’s enough.”Gu Xinghe sneered.

However, Zhai Xing had a different attitude.

“Young master Gu, think carefully. If he really has power far above us now, why would he sit down and negotiate with us? Why would he give up half of the spiritual stone mine?”Zhai Xing said anxiously.

“If we let him grow now, he will definitely grow to an invincible state in the future. At that time, the agreement between you and him will no longer exist!”

Gu Xinghe glanced at Zhai Xing and said coldly, “You mean you want me to attack him now?”

“That’s right, think of a way to get rid of them!”Zhai Xing said.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Uncle Zhai Xing, are you stupid? Right now, our Jingdu Martial Arts Association is being attacked from both sides. And to eliminate this sky blood rainbow, regardless of whether we succeed or not, we will suffer heavy losses!”

“When that time comes, there will definitely be someone to reap the benefits!”

“But...”

“Enough, I’ve made up my mind. There’s no need to say anymore!”

Zhai Xing still wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Gu Xinghe.

“Alright, let’s go to the spirit stone mine now,”Gu Xinghe said coldly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

...

Spirit Stone mine.

The mustached man was unhurriedly setting up a formation.

Qin Yu was slightly anxious. He covered the surroundings and quietly observed.

“Done.”

At this moment, the moustache man heaved a sigh of relief.

“The spatial formation has been set up. Hurry up and collect the items!”The moustache man said excitedly.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded. He took out the spatial god tool and planned to put the spirit stone mine into it.

“Who is it!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from above!

Several Marquis Wu were standing on top, staring at the two!
