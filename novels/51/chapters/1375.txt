Chapter 1376: Chapter 1,376, Iron Egg’s suggestion 1

Looking at Qin Yu’s departing figure, the group of people muttered, “Where did this lunatic come from...”

“That person seems a little familiar. I feel like I’ve seen him somewhere before.”

“I have the same feeling. He... He seems to be that Qin Yu!”

...

After Qin Yu walked out of the restaurant, he rushed to the Heavenly Cloud sect in a hurry.

“What are you doing?”Iron Egg’s voice sounded in his mind.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Going to the Tianyun sect, I can’t implicate others.”

“What are you afraid of? There are Dao Protectors on Earth. Would the Tianyun sect dare to cause trouble? Unless they are tired of living.”Iron Egg couldn’t help but ridicule.

Hearing this, Qin Yu was instantly stunned.

That’s right. Back when Yan Ruoxue went to Earth, she was warned by the dao protectors, let alone a small Tianyun sect?

Qin Yu froze on the spot. He frowned and said, “But... My Friend is still in the Tianyun sect.”

“Your friend? Why do you care so much? You Can’t even control yourself, how can you care about others?”Tie Dan sneered.

“When you are strong enough, you can go and avenge them.”

“No.”Qin Yu rejected tie Dan without thinking.

“I can’t let others take the blame for my matters.”

“Fool.”Iron Egg laughed coldly.

“Let me tell you. The holy region is an extremely cruel place. In other words, the cultivation world is inherently cruel. The people at the top of the pyramid will always be a minority. If you want to climb up, you must do whatever it takes. Otherwise, no one will collect your corpse even if you die.”

Iron Egg’s words weren’t without reason. Unfortunately, this was different from Qin Yu’s path.

Qin Yu could show no mercy to strangers, but he could not do that to the people around him.

“How about this?”Tie Dan seemed to see through Qin Yu’s thoughts.

“You can go hide near the Tianyun sect. If the Tianyun sect really wants to attack your friend, you can make a decision.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then said, “There must be pictures of me everywhere near the Tianyun sect.”

“Isn’t that simple? Just buy a human skin mask and wear it on your face,”said tie Dan.

“There’s such a Thing?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be surprised.

Tie Dan sneered, “Of course there is. Don’t forget, this is the Holy Region! Even your Earth can find it, let alone the Holy Region.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment, and it seemed to be true.

Thus, he didn’t waste any more time and immediately turned to leave.

This time, Qin Yu’s destination was Gu City.

The only person he could ask for help now was probably sister Lin.

After rushing all the way, Qin Yu returned to Gu City once again.

The entire GU city was also covered with Qin Yu’s arrest warrant.

Fortunately, it wasn’t as strict as before, so it wasn’t difficult to sneak in.

“Are you sure the person you are looking for won’t betray you?”Tie Dan asked in his mind.

Qin Yu shook her head and said, “I don’t know. I can only try.”

At the auction. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Sister Lin had finished her day’s work and looked a little tired.

In addition to hosting the auction, she was also responsible for organizing all kinds of treasures.

Therefore, she only walked out of the auction very late at night.

She brushed the strands of hair on her forehead and let out a long sigh of relief.

At this moment, a hand suddenly reached out from the dark and helplessly opened her mouth.

A trace of panic flashed across sister Lin’s face. She struggled with all her might, but she could not break free.

Qin Yu pulled her into the dark box and whispered into her ear, “Shh, Sister Lin, it’s me, I’m Qin Yu.”

Hearing this, sister Lin, who was struggling, immediately quieted down.

Qin Yu slowly let go of sister Lin. After making sure that sister Lin wouldn’t shout, she completely let go.

Sister Lin hurriedly turned around. She looked at Qin Yu in front of her and exclaimed, “Qin Yu, why are you here? Don’t you know that people from the Heavenly Cloud sect are looking for you?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I know. That’s why I came to look for you.”

Sister Lin was silent for a moment, and then said, “You want me to help you with something, right?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I can’t find anyone else now. I can only place my hopes on you.”

“What do you want me to do?”Sister Lin didn’t waste any time and asked directly.

Qin Yu quickly said, “Two things. First, I need you to help me find a human skin mask or a spiritual artifact that can change my appearance. The better, the better.”

When sister Lin heard this, a trace of surprise flashed across her face.

“Second is the life energy. Sister Lin, please think of a way to help me find the life energy.”Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

Sister Lin said in a deep voice, “The first thing is not difficult, but the vital energy... is not something that I can find just because I want it.”

“That’s why I hope you will put in a lot of effort. After the matter is done, I will definitely give you a great reward.”Qin Yu bowed deeply.

Sister Lin had been in the auction for many years and had interacted with people who had treasures. It was probably the most suitable person to look for her.

“Okay.”Sister Lin Thought for a moment and agreed.

“When do you need it?”Qin Yu asked.

“The sooner the better,”Qin Yu said.

Sister Lin nodded and said, “How about this, give me an address. I’ll send it to you in three days.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu nodded and said, “In three days, I’ll wait for you at the location of the three stars east of the East Gate of Gu City.”
