Chapter 1143: Chapter 1,143, paying a visit to Tian Jizi 

Qin Yu and Zhai Xing looked at each other in dismay.

He stared at Yao Qing in front of him and said in a low voice, “Are you sure... You Didn’t come just now?”

“I didn’t. I even fainted. F * ck, are you guys okay?”Yao Qing rubbed his head and whispered.

Qin Yu had mixed feelings in his heart.

Since the person who just came was not Yao Qing, it meant that the person who came was really a Dao Protector! It meant that he was Qin Yu’s father!

“I sensed that something was wrong long ago, but I’m not sure.”Pavilion Master’s voice contained some hidden bitterness.

Qin Yu did not say anything. His heart was extremely complicated.

This was the first time he was face to face with his father, but he did not say a word.

“If it’s my father, that means he has already violated his principles,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

In this way, he would definitely be punished by the Heavenly Dao.

This made Qin Yu very uncomfortable.

His father, whom he had never met, seemed to be secretly watching Qin Yu’s every move.

He sat on the chair with his hand on his forehead and didn’t say anything for a long time.

“Don’t think too much,”Zhai Xing comforted him.

“Since he’s already here, it’s useless to think too much.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Actually... This isn’t the first time he helped me. If according to what you said, he would punish me every time he attacked, then I’m afraid...”

He didn’t continue, but he felt extremely uncomfortable in his heart.

“If your heart is really uncomfortable, then think of a way to increase your strength,”pavilion master said faintly.

Hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly stood up and said, “You are right. As long as my strength is strong enough, so what if I am the Heavenly Dao!”

Pavilion master frowned slightly.

The meaning of her words was that as long as she increased her strength, she could try her best to avoid troubling the dao protectors.

However, she did not expect that Qin Yu would actually attempt to go against the Heavenly Dao.

“No matter what, we have dodged this calamity. However, those eight higher-ups will definitely not give up just like that,”Zhai Xing said from the side.

Qin Yu acknowledged and rubbed his chest. There was still a trace of pain in his chest.

This was Yan Yongfu’s palm. With just one palm, he had shattered Qin Yu’s green wood true body.

The difference in strength between the two sides was self-evident.

“Has the holy region opened?”Qin Yu looked at Zhai Xing and asked.

Zhai Xing shook his head and said, “I don’t know. That ancient array platform is in the first mystic realm. If we don’t enter the first mystic realm, we won’t be able to remove the ancient array platform.”

“Let’s wait. Tian Jizi will definitely make a sound tonight,”pavilion master said.

Qin Yu nodded. This was the only thing they could do now.

...

In the first secret realm.

Eight high-level officials gathered in the hall.

Their expressions were not very good. No one had expected the Dao Guardian to suddenly appear.

“This Dao Guardian really went through a lot of trouble for his son,”a high-level official said coldly.

“That’s right. The dao guardian can not interfere in anything in the mortal world, but he seems to have violated his principles many times,”a high-level official at the side added.

Yan Yongfu glanced at them and coldly said, “So what? Do you think the few of us can do anything to him?”

“Are we just going to let that Qin Yu Go?”A higher-up coldly snorted.

Yan Yongfu lightly snorted and said, “Of course not. Qin Yu must die, and we must get rid of him.”

Yan Yongfu was the only one who made a move against Qin Yu. And that palm, in the eyes of outsiders, was just a casual slap, but in reality, it was a palm that Yan Yongfu had used all his strength to deliver.

Even those at the Almighty realm wouldn’t be unscathed by this palm strike, but Qin Yu had taken it head-on.

This was definitely not good news. If he took another step forward, he might really have the qualifications to challenge those at the Almighty Realm.

“Oh right, didn’t Tian Jizi say that the holy region is about to open?”At this moment, an almighty suddenly asked.

When this topic was brought up, everyone’s gaze couldn’t help but turn towards the ancient array platform in the distance.

This array platform was extremely large, and it was surrounded by flags. On the flags, strange runes were carved one after another. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The array platform was covered in dust. If one looked carefully, one could even see a spider web.

This was enough to show that the ancient array platform hadn’t been used for a long time.

“If the saint-level is truly activated, we might as well take the opportunity to leave this place,”someone suggested.

The pavilion near the water would gain the moon first. They would definitely be the first batch of people to enter the saint-level.

But right now, the ancient formation stage didn’t move at all. It didn’t seem to be activated at all.

“Before the saint-level is activated, we must get rid of Qin Yu.”Yan Yongfu’s eyes narrowed.

“After we kill Qin Yu, we’ll immediately flee to the holy region. That way, even his dao protectors won’t be able to do anything to us!”

This suggestion seemed to have received the approval of most of the higher-ups.

They had absorbed almost all of Earth’s cultivation resources, so there was no point in staying.

...

That night.

Tianji zi appeared on the martial arts forum.

“The Holy Region will open soon, but formation platforms are needed.”

“There are eighteen formation platforms in the world, scattered all over the world.”

Tianji Zi didn’t say when the Holy Region would open, but used the word “Recently.”.

As for where the eighteen formation platforms were, he didn’t say either.

“18 array platforms... in other words, one doesn’t have to pass through the first secret realm to go to the Holy Region.”Qin Yu rubbed his chin and said in a low voice.

At this moment, Yao Meng, Xiao Yuan, and the others walked in from outside.

Seeing the past few days, Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and asked, “Why are you guys here?”

Yao Meng smiled and said, “Qin Yu, we plan to visit Tianji Zi today and ask him about matters related to the holy region. I don’t know if you are interested.”

Hearing this, a trace of interest immediately appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

“Yes, of course.”Qin Yu nodded.

He had too many questions in his heart. He had always wanted to find someone to ask clearly, but he didn’t know who to look for.

This Tianjizi was mysterious and unfathomable. It was a good choice.
