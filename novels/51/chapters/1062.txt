Chapter 1063: Chapter 1,063, the Heavenly Blood Rainbow made his move! 

Qin Yu was extremely unwilling. He had mobilized Zhai Xing for so long, but in the end, it ended up like this!

Most importantly, if the second mystic realm was destroyed, there would be no way to step into the first mystic realm. How would he find the ancient array platform!

“Lord Zhai Xing, I’m sorry.”The two people who were escorting Zhai Xing said in a low voice.

Zhai Xing did not say a word. He only felt extremely relaxed.

When he was pulled out of it, it seemed that everything had nothing to do with him.

“You traitor.”Gu Zizhen looked at Zhai Xing coldly.

“After I kill these two, I’ll send you on your way!”

Zhai Xing did not say a word. Only a bitter smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

Then, Gu Zizhen looked at Qin Yu.

His palm was shining, and a killing intent was coming.

“Leave Gu Zizhen to me. I’ll leave the rest to you,”said Qin Yu.

The crane grunted, and a huge crane phenomenon appeared behind him. It looked like an immortal had descended.

“Kill!”Gu Zizhen shouted angrily, and the great battle instantly began!

“Boom!”

But at this moment, the second secret realm suddenly shook!

Then, eight light pillars shot up from the ground and pierced through the clouds!

The sudden change immediately attracted everyone’s attention!

The battle that should have started stopped at this moment!

Qin Yu looked at the eight light pillars and felt that they were extremely familiar.

Meanwhile, Zhai Xing, who was being imprisoned, quickly remembered something!

“The secret technique of the immortal slaying sect! This is the secret technique of the immortal slaying sect!”Zhai Xing’s expression changed drastically!

He hurriedly looked at everyone and shouted, “Run! Leave the second mystic realm immediately! Hurry!”

However, no one listened to Zhai Xing’s words. They only felt that Zhai Xing was disturbing the morale of the army.

“Run quickly!”Zhai Xing shouted at the top of his lungs. He tried to struggle, but he couldn’t break free at all!

“Why would the secret technique of the Immortal Slayer sect appear here!”Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat ugly.

At this moment, a voice sounded from all directions!

“Hahahaha! My secret technique is finally complete! All the Martial Marquis will become a part of me!”Tian Xuehong’s voice spread throughout the second mystic realm!

“Tian Xuehong!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

He swept his gaze around and shouted, “Tian Xuehong, why are you here? !”

Sky blood rainbow sneered, “I’ve been planning this for a long time. I’ve been waiting for Today!”

“I don’t believe that the masked woman will appear in the second secret realm!”

Qin Yu’s face was cold. He didn’t expect that the Sky Blood Rainbow wouldn’t give up. He even turned his eyes to the second secret realm!

“Gu Zizhen, it’s best for us to stop fighting for a while and find the Sky Blood Rainbow First,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Zhai Xing, who was beside him, also hurriedly shouted, “Realm master, quickly catch the Sky Blood Rainbow. Otherwise, all the martial marquis in the Mystic Realm will die!”

Gu Zizhen coldly glanced at Zhai Xing, then waved his hand and slapped Zhai Xing’s face!

“Don’t even think about disturbing our army’s morale,”gu Zizhen said with a cold snort.

He didn’t believe the words of Qin Yu and Zhai Xing at all!

In his opinion, this was just a scheme of Qin Yu and Zhai Xing.

“Don’t look for me. My main body isn’t in the second secret realm at all. Even if you find it, it’s useless,”Tian Xuehong sneered repeatedly.

“Qin Yu, you should be happy. If it weren’t for me, these thousands of martial marquises would have killed you.”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold.

If Tian Xuehong was allowed to recover to his peak, he would probably be even more terrifying than Gu Zizhen!

“Stop putting on an act, what bullshit secret arts of the slaughter sect, do you think I will believe it?”Gu Zizhen sneered.

“No matter what you say, both of you will die here today!”

“That’s right! Qin Yu, die!”The other Martial Marquis also roared.

“Pu!”

However, at this time, one of the Martial Marquis’s body exploded, turning into a bloody mist!

His divine sense was drawn out, entering the eight pillars of light!

“Pu!”

Following that, another martial Marquis died!

“Pu Pu Pu!”

One martial marquis after another exploded, and their divine sense was drawn out!

This immediately caused everyone to Panic!

They looked around in terror, and said in a trembling voice, “What... What’s going on! ?”

“Run! Run! Leave the second secret realm!”Zhai Xing shouted as if he had gone mad!

“This is the secret technique of the immortal slaying sect. It will absorb the divine sense of all the martial marquis. Run! !”

While they were talking, three more martial marquis exploded and died!

This time, everyone could not remain calm.

This kind of unknown fear made them extremely terrified! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Run! Run!”

Someone shouted loudly, and then ran toward the exit!

Unfortunately, in order to prevent Qin Yu from escaping, Gu Zi Zhen had long sealed the exit with a secret treasure! There was no way to escape!

“Realm master, i... I don’t want to die... Pu!”

Before he could finish speaking, his body exploded!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. Seeing one martial marquis after another die in front of him, his heart also faintly felt a bit of sorrow.

However, the most painful one was none other than Zhai Xing.

Tears flowed down his face, and his face was filled with despair.

Seeing one martial marquis after another die in front of him, his heart felt like it was being cut by a knife.

“Lord Zhai Xing, I don’t want to die...”the two martial marquis in charge of escorting Zhai Xing looked at Zhai Xing with trembling eyes.

“PFFT!”

However, as soon as they finished speaking, they immediately exploded!

“No, no! !”Zhai Xing shouted in pain. Turbid tears filled his gully-filled face.

However, his shout could not change anything.
