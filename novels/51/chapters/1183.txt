Chapter 1184: Chapter 1,184 was defeated once again 

Lu Guan sneered.

He was from the Holy Region, but he had lost face in front of Qin Yu. This was intolerable to Lu Guan!

Now that he had a chance to take revenge, he would not miss it.

Chang mang shouted, “F * ck you! Qin Yu took such a big risk to enter the Holy Mausoleum. Why should he give it to you? You want to go in by yourself!”

Lu Guan was unmoved. He said indifferently, “We agreed in advance that we would split the things we got. What, are we going back on our words now?”

“Split the things we got together? That means we only got half of the things we got together! You F * cking stood at the door and watched the show, and you want half of the things we got together? How many times do you want? !”Chang Mang clenched his fists and said angrily.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer, “To put it bluntly, he just saw that my spiritual power was exhausted and my lifespan was damaged, so he found an excuse to attack me.”

“Hahahaha!”Lu Guan couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“You’re right! Since you’ve already said it, there’s no need to talk nonsense. Hand over the thing, and I can consider leaving you with a whole corpse!”

Lu Guan took a step forward, and his aura exploded!

“Do you think I am afraid of You!”Qin Yu strode forward. Although he did not have the support of spiritual power, his physical strength was still there.

The natural strength of his physical body made Qin Yu extremely powerful without the help of spiritual power!

“If you want to fight, I will accompany you!”Chang Mang’s iron tower-like body blocked in front of Qin Yu.

His body emitted a scarlet light, giving off a menacing aura.

“You don’t know life from death.”Lu Guan snorted. Holding the green light in his hand, he arrived in front of Chang Mang with a Whoosh!

The surrounding air fluctuated, and the green light in Lu Guan’s hand turned into small snakes that burst out from his palm!

Then, the small green snakes burst out from countless angles toward Chang Mang’s body. In the blink of an eye, Chang Mang’s body was covered by the green light!

Lu Guan could not help but sneer when he saw this. He murmured, and the densely packed small green snakes began to coil around Chang Mang’s body!

Qin Yu was not worried.

Although this Lu Guan came from the holy region, his strength was not that great.

On the contrary, although Chang Mang was only at the early stage of the Martial Saint Realm, he was still a holy body, and his strength was extremely powerful.

The scarlet radiance on Chang Mang’s body was brewing. In the next second, an explosive sound was heard and the small green snake was instantly shattered into pieces!

Lu Guan’s pupils suddenly shrunk and his expression changed slightly. He was about to retreat but it was already too late.

Chang Mang, who was originally reckless, was now like a wild beast. The Scarlet Radiance outlined him like a god of death!

“Ah!”

Chang Mang roared and shot toward Lu Guan.

In Lu Guan’s view, Chang Mang was like a Mad Bull. He was unstoppable and rushed forward. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Lu Guan.

“F * ck you!”

Chang Mang’s palm, which was like a cattail leaf fan, slapped Lu Guan’s face!

The palm was even bigger than his head. Lu Guan was sent flying with one slap.

He felt his head buzzing as if he had been hit by a carriage.

Before he could react, Chang Mang had already stepped forward again.

The huge body suddenly pressed on Lu Guan’s body, followed by a rough and disorderly fist!

The iron-like fist kept hitting Lu Guan’s body.

For a moment, the sound of “Boom, Boom, Boom”was incessant.

Lu Guan, who was lying on the ground, was covered in blood. Even his protective magical artifact was cracked!

Lu Guan, who was stimulated by the pain, seemed to be at a loss. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He could not understand why there were so many inexplicable perverts on this earth, which had exhausted its spiritual qi?

In the blink of an eye, Lu Guan was covered in blood. The blood flowed from his body to Qin Yu’s feet.

However, Chang Mang had no intention of stopping. Once he started a fight, he would not rest until he was dead. His anger did not diminish in the slightest. Instead, it was like a raging fire, burning brighter and brighter.

“That’s enough.”

Chang Mang did not stop until Qin Yu spoke.

He lifted Lu Guan with one hand and shook him in the air as if he was holding a chick.

“How dare you say such arrogant words with such little ability?”Chang Mang said coldly.

Lu Guan was dumbfounded. Many of his bones had been shattered. He probably didn’t even have the ability to stand up.

“Spare his life,”Lu Yun said with a frown.

Qin Yu glanced at Lu Yun and said, “If we spare his life, who knows if you will take revenge when we go to the Holy Region?”

Lu Yun’s expression changed!

From what Qin Yu said, it seemed that he intended to kill him to silence him?

“I promise you that we will never seek revenge!”Lu Yun hurriedly said.

Qin Yu sneered, “Promise? What’s the use of your promise?”

“Qin Yu, believe me! Even if we really want to seek revenge, we have to have that condition,”Lu Yun hurriedly said.

“With your talent, even if you go to the Holy Region, you will definitely be valued by the sect!”

“Think about it, why would our sect give up two extremely talented geniuses for Lu Guan?”

What he said made some sense.

Lu Guan’s ability wasn’t even considered top-notch on Earth, let alone the Holy Region. He probably couldn’t even be compared to Zhuang Teng and the others.

“Alright, since we need your extradition to the holy region, I’ll spare his life.”Qin Yu looked at Chang Mang, signaling with his eyes.

Only then did Chang Mang throw Lu Guan away.

Lu Guan’s body pierced through the holy mausoleum and landed in front of Fang Yue and the others.

He opened his eyes and everything before him was dark. Before he could speak, he fainted.

The Disciples of Heaven Gate who were waiting outside couldn’t help but look at each other.

“What... What’s going on?”
