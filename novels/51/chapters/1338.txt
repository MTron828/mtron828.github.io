Chapter 1339: Chapter 1,339, you can’t leave! 1 

The monk seemed to have sensed the murderous aura on Qin Yu’s body.

He raised his palm, and traces of peaceful aura immediately spread out.

This peaceful aura seemed to come from the western regions. It was said that it could cleanse one’s soul, and even a demon who killed people numbly would be infected.

Under this aura, Qin Yu’s murderous aura disappeared, and a trace of compassion even appeared in his heart.

Even if he tried his best to resist, it was useless. He couldn’t make a move at all.

This made Qin Yu’s expression extremely ugly. He slowly loosened his fist, and even his expression became much friendlier.

“Young Man, don’t act too rashly,”the monk said indifferently.

Qin Yu didn’t know how to answer for a moment. This feeling made him extremely uncomfortable.

“Who exactly are you? Where did this strange power come from?”Qin Yu said coldly.

The monk didn’t explain. He just put his palms together and said, “Anyone who comes here should focus on kindness. As for whether to stay or go, it’s up to you.”

After saying this, the monk no longer paid attention to Qin Yu.

He didn’t sit down facing Qin Yu. He slowly put his hands together.

Qin Yu looked at the monk’s back and didn’t say anything for a long time.

After hesitating for a moment, out of vigilance, Qin Yu finally chose to leave this place.

After coming down from the mountain, that strange feeling disappeared without a trace.

“What a magical power,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

He didn’t dare to turn his head and hurriedly left this place.

The place he originally chose was denied, so Qin Yu had no place to go for a moment.

“There he is. I found him!”

Just as Qin Yu was at a loss, a voice suddenly broke his thoughts.

Qin Yu was shocked. Just as he was about to escape, he realized that it was none other than Wen Erxiong and Wen Erxiong.

Qin Yu patted his chest and immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

The two of them walked up quickly, and Wen Erxiong punched Qin Yu’s chest.

“Say it!”Wen Er stared at Qin Yu fiercely.

Qin Yu was puzzled and asked, “Say what?”

“Do you want to ride my wind-chasing colt and run away?”Wen Er said angrily.

Qin Yu rolled her eyes and said, “I’m not interested in your wind-chasing colt.”

“Nonsense, I don’t know how many people are coveting my wind-chasing Colt!”Wen Er muttered.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Alright, stop talking nonsense. Let’s get down to business. How did you find me?”

Wen Er pointed at the windchaser colt smugly and said, “This is my windchaser Colt. It has a 24-hour GPS system. I know where he is at all times! You want to steal it? No Way!”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization. He looked at the windchaser colt in front of him and muttered, “Damn it, it actually exposed my position...”

“If you had come back a little later, I would have been too late. By then, my grandfather would have beaten me to death,”Wen er muttered.

With that, he ran over to hug the wind-chasing foal and greeted it carefully.

“Qin Yu, you’ve been in the limelight recently. You’re even more famous than the two of us.”Wen Da patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Do you think I want to? I have nowhere to go now. Damn it.”

“Why don’t you come back with us? It just so happens that you can drink with us,”Wen da said with a big smile.

Qin Yu touched her chin and thought to herself, this is a good idea..

If she went to the Wen family, she could still ask for some information.

“Aren’t you afraid of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s Revenge?”Qin Yu frowned and asked. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Hearing this, Wen Da’s eyes widened and he said, “Who the F * ck do you look down on? The heavenly cloud sect still dares to find trouble with my grandfather? My grandfather will beat him to death!”

“That’s right, that’s right. who dares to behave atrociously with my grandfather!”Wen Er also said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “As long as it won’t cause trouble for you guys.”

“Alright, let’s go. I’ll let you see our Wen family’s super luxurious manor!”Wen Da said as he put his arm around Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“Wait.”Qin Yu shook his head and said in a deep voice, “You guys still have to help me with one more thing.”

“What is it?”Wen Da scratched his head.

Qin Yu took out the treasure that Chen Cang had given her.

“Help me send this to the auction and give it to sister Lin. Tell her that Chen Cang gave it to her,”Qin Yu said.

Chen Cang had given his life force to Qin Yu. Naturally, he didn’t dare to forget this.

“Then why don’t you go by yourself? Why do you have to trouble us?”Wen Da grumbled.

Qin Yu shook his head. “I killed Ling Yun. If I go to Gu City, I’m afraid I Won’t be able to come out.”

“Who dares to stop us? They must be tired of living!”Wen Da glared at him.

Qin Yu waved his hand. “Alright, Alright. I know how powerful you are. In any case, hurry up and go. Consider it a favor for me.”

After much persuasion, the two of them finally agreed reluctantly.

The three of them rode the wind-chasing colt and rushed towards Gu City.

They arrived near Gu City and Qin Yu jumped off the wind-chasing colt.

“I’ll wait for you here. Hurry up and go,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Okay.”This time, the two of them didn’t waste any time. They brought their belongings and entered gu city, rushing towards the auction.

However, the moment Wen Dawen stepped into Gu City, someone in the dark had already set their eyes on them.

...

Gu City, inside the imperial palace.

“City Lord, as you expected, Wen Dawen has returned to Gu City.”A man in iron armor and dressed as a general knelt down and said.

The city lord sneered and said, “Since they have returned, it means that they have found Qin Yu.”

“City Lord, should we capture them now?”The general asked.

The city Lord coldly glanced at them and said, “Are you crazy? If Wen Wanli knows that we have captured his grandson, then the entire GU city will be implicated!”

The general did not dare to say anything and quietly waited for the city Lord’s order.

A moment later, the city lord said coldly, “Continue to keep an eye on him in the dark. As long as we keep an eye on them, we will definitely be able to find Qin Yu.”

“Yes!”

...

Near Gu City, Qin Yu was waiting for Wen Dawen er in boredom.

He originally wanted to use the desolate God’s eye to probe the situation, but he was afraid that the top experts in Gu City would notice, so he chose to give up in the end.

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, a long time had passed.

About three hours later, Wen Da and Wen Er swaggered out of Gu City.

“How is it? Did you give it to him?”Qin Yu asked quickly.

Wen Da patted his chest and said, “I’m doing something, don’t worry! I gave it to him personally!”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Then hurry up and leave. I have a bad feeling.”

“I’m afraid you can’t go!”

At this time, figures broke through the space and suddenly appeared.
