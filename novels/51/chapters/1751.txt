1752 The Power of the Purple Cloud Pearl?

Hearing this clear and familiar voice, Yong Ji was stunned. He quickly looked ahead.

On Xiao Sheng’s shoulder, there was a young girl.

Her two little legs were dangling in the air, making her look like a child.

“Jue Wu?”

When he saw the person clearly, Yong Ji was stunned.

“Jue Wu, aren’t you already dead?” Yong Ji asked in surprise.

Jue Wu jumped down from Xiaosheng’s shoulder. She glared at Yong Ji and said, “I won’t die even if you die. You bastard, you’ve really joined the North Plain, you bastard!”

Yong Ji’s expression gradually turned cold. He snorted and said, “No wonder you’re with Wen Wanchong. You speak the same way.”

“Alright, stop talking nonsense!” Sima Bei, who was standing at the side, seemed to have lost his patience.

He coldly looked at Jue Wu and said, “Jue Wu, this isn’t the first time we’ve met.”

“Ah,” she said. Jue Wu looked at Sima Bei in a daze, then scratched her head. “Who are you again?”

Sima Bei was stunned. His old face darkened, and he gritted his teeth.”You have a good memory. I’m the Godly King of the North Plain…”

“Oh, I remember now!” Before Sima Bei could finish, Jue Wu clapped her hands and said with a smile, “You’re the lunatic from the north. You’re that Sima something, right? ”

Sima Bei couldn’t bear it anymore. He glared at Jue Wu and said, “Don’t be pretentious! You’re only a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator now, so you don’t have the right to stand in front of us. If you want to die, we can satisfy you!”

Yong Ji also came back to his senses. He laughed and said, “Yeah! Why didn’t I think of that? You’re just a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator now. You’ve come at the right time, I’ll kill you as well, hahaha!”

“Hehe, what’s wrong? Were you afraid you couldn’t beat me in the past?” Jue Wu said with a smile.

“Yong Ji, don’t waste your breath on her. Quickly kill her, and then get rid of Xiao Sheng.” Sima Bei said coldly.

“Leave it to me, ” Yong Ji said coldly. “I was just thinking of meeting my old rival.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After he finished speaking, a terrifying aura burst out from Yong Ji’s body. He mimicked Yuan Xiu and a ray of light lit up on his finger, which he then pointed at Jue Wu.

“Although it’s just a casual point of my finger, it should be enough to deal with a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator like you,” Yong Ji said with a faint smile.

In the distance, Wen Wanchong, who was trapped in the small world, suddenly looked extremely ugly!

“Lord… Lord Jue Wu, why is she here?!” Wen Wanchong gritted his teeth.

There was no need to elaborate on his relationship with Jue Wu. Now that he saw Jue Wu being surrounded by two Reversion Void Stage cultivators, he was naturally anxious!

“No, no!” Wen Wanchong was furious. He desperately smashed the void in front of him, but the world was extremely strong and could not be broken!

“You… You guys don’t touch Jue Wu!”

Wen Wanchong was furious, but he felt even more despair!

Yong Ji said that it was just a casual point of his finger, but that definitely contained 100% of his strength. It definitely wasn’t something Jue Wu could take!

However, just as Wen Wanchong was in despair, Jue Wu, who was not far away, flew up with a whoosh. Then, she reached out her hand and a purple light suddenly burst out!

Her small hand became extremely large. Wrapped in purple light, it was like a small mountain as it ruthlessly slapped toward Yong Ji!

“Boom!”

Before Yong Ji could even react, he was smacked to the ground by a palm!

Wen Wanchong was stunned when he saw this.

“How… How is this possible?” Wen Wanchong swallowed his saliva!

Jue Wu was only a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator, how could she have such terrifying strength? This didn’t make sense!

Even Xiao Sheng would not be able to do such a thing!

“Ah!”

Yong Ji’s furious voice came from underground.

He suddenly stood up, extremely furious!

Fresh blood dripped from his body, making him look rather tragic.

“I… I’m going to kill you!” Yong Ji was furious! He had never thought that he would be f*cking defeated again!

“Something’s not right.”

To the side, Sima Bei sensed something strange. Jue Wu’s aura was not that powerful, but when she attacked, the power was terrifying to the extreme!

And that purple light shouldn’t have belonged to Jue Wu!

He had fought with Jue Wu before, and this was definitely not Jue Wu’s method!

“Could it be someone else in disguise?” Sima Bei even guessed.

Wen Wanchong, who was not far away, seemed to have guessed something!

“It’s… It’s the power of the purple cloud pearl!” Wen Wanchong was shocked!

Could it be that Jue Wu had swallowed the power of the purple cloud pearl?

“Something’s wrong!” But soon, Wen Wanchong shook his head.

The power that this purple cloud pearl could display wasn’t any weaker than a completely revived Saint Weapon. It was obvious that Jue Wu hadn’t been able to display such battle power.

It could only be said that Jue Wu had most likely obtained a portion of the purple cloud pearl’s power!

“Yong Ji, you’re really a piece of trash. Is this all you’ve got at the Reversion Void Stage?” Jue Wu said with a smile.

“F*ck you!” Yong Ji was clearly forced to the point of collapse. He charged towards Jue Wu, his fists continuously smashing over.

However, Jue Wu’s movements were extremely light, and she easily dodged every punch.

After a while, Yong Ji was so tired that he was gasping for breath. On the other hand, Jue Wu was standing in the air, looking at Yong Ji with a mocking expression.

“Just this?” Jue Wu scratched her head. Then, she raised her palm and that purple power appeared again.

“Are you done? It’s my turn now.” Jue Wu’s face gradually turned cold.

Sima Bei, who was standing at the side, walked out in a hurry and said in a deep voice, “Be careful, this Jue Wu is a bit strange.”

“That thing from the North Plain… Sima what? You’re just in time, I’ll take care of you too.” Jue Wu muttered.

Sima Bei’s face was extremely cold. He raised his head to look at Jue Wu, extremely vigilant.

“Boom!”

At this moment, Jue Wu’s small hands exploded with two powerful forces!

These two forces once again smacked the two of them into the ground!

Wen Wanchong and Qu Zhu heaved a sigh of relief when they saw this.

“At least we don’t have to worry about Jue Wu and Xiao Sheng.” Qu Zhu said.

Wen Wanchong hummed in acknowledgment. He looked at Yuan Xiu in front of him and said in a low voice, “Next, we should worry about ourselves.”

Yuan Xiu nearby said with a faint smile, “Your Nanzhou is full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. There are many talents.”

Wen Wanchong’s face was pale, and his forehead was covered in sweat.

Neither Qu Zhu nor Wen Wanchong had the confidence to face Yuan Xiu.

“Don’t worry. After I kill you two, I’ll go and kill that Jue Wu.” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

After saying that, Yuan Xiu’s body trembled slightly and a ray of light emitted from his glabella.

The light entered the small world, and in a moment, it condensed into a terrifying figure in a black robe!

Without a doubt, this must be a mysterious existence from the Immortal Slaying Sect!
