Chapter 2653: Confrontation Between Two Great Elder

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xin Yue suddenly turned around and snapped her fingers.

The power of Qigong struck the void behind Qin Yu, and an ear-piercing scream echoed from behind him.

An overwhelming beast roar almost deafened Qin Yu, but even when he opened his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, he still couldn’t capture the beast’s tracks.

What Gu Yi summoned was an invisible magical beast.

“Gu Yi, are you truly intent on starting a war with me?” Xin Yue’s voice turned cold.

Behind her, many elders and disciples had already begun to appear, ready for battle.

“Aren’t we already at war?” Gu Yi’s voice seemed to carry a hint of laughter. There were even more people behind him.

He made another hand seal, and in an instant, a terrifying power seemed to wrap around his hand.

Order of Rules, Strong Demon Tremor Technique.

Elder Gu Yi’s power of rules, be careful!

Jing Xin loudly reminded. Her face was slightly pale.

No one had expected the two strongest elders of the Demon Sealing Valley to suddenly start fighting.

Gu Yi took a step forward and arrived in front of Xin Yue.

Fleeing Shadow.

A fist was already smashing down on Xin Yue, and the power around the fist tilted out.

Strong Demon Tremor Technique.

Jing Xin also threw a punch, and the entire space shook.

Even though the battle armor protected Qin Yu, he still felt as if all his internal organs had shifted.

What made him feel terrified was that a terrifying divine might envelop him.

This power was like the internal qi of a superior being.

Qin Yu’s soul fell silent uncontrollably after locking all the acupuncture points in his body.

It was as if he was shackled, making it difficult for him to move his body.

Chi!

A gush of fresh blood erupted, and the other outsiders were even more miserable.

Without the protection of the armor, almost everyone fell to the ground within one second.

“Don’t struggle, this is divine might, the power that only those at the True Consciousness Realm can have. The more you struggle, the more severe the injuries your divine soul will suffer.”

Ling’er’s face was also pale. She should be injured as well.

However, compared to Qin Yu, her injuries were much lighter.

Gu Yi withdrew his fist and retreated. His hand suddenly grabbed the unconscious peak master, Zhan Pu. The terrifying power even caused the peak master’s head to deform.

Even though he was unconscious, the peak master was still trembling in pain.

“Stop!”

Qin Yu’s eyes were bloodshot. He suddenly passed by Elder Xin Yue.

The black Destruction Saber was about to be used again. Xin Yue was about to stop it, but something seemed to have changed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xin Yue’s face was filled with ecstasy, while Gu Yi’s expression changed drastically.

He threw the peak master on the ground with an ugly expression and then left

with everyone.

“Jing Xin, Ling’er, you guys take them back first.”

Xin Yue left behind this sentence and led the elders behind her away.

“What happened?”

All these changes happened too quickly. Qin Yu was somewhat unable to react in time.

He had wanted to fight Gu Yi no matter what, even if he had to die.

However, he did not expect Gu Yi to abandon the peak master and leave in a hurry as if he had received some order.

“Senior Sister, what exactly happened? This is the first time I’ve seen Master and Elder Gu Yi so flustered. However, Master seems to be a little happy. Could it be…”

Ling’er looked a little excited.

“To be able to let Master and Elder Gu Yi bring so many people away at the same time, the sect master must have appeared.”

Jing Xin could not help but smile.

“Sect master has finally appeared after disappearing for so long. Someone has finally come out to take charge of the situation in this chaotic world! ”

Ling’er happily jumped on the spot a few times, like a little girl who could not grow up.

To them, this place was their everything, and they were born from this Ancient

Demon Land.

This included the Demon Sealing Valley, which was their home.

They were the ones who were most worried about the collapse of order in the Ancient Demon Land.

To outsiders like Qin Yu, perhaps this was a testing ground for them to enter the core region of the Saint Kingdom.

However, to them, this place was their everything. Everything they had since their birth was included in it.

Jing Xin brought Qin Yu and many heavily injured outsiders to a region. She first instructed Ling’er to call for a pharmacist.

Then, she said to Qin Yu, “They suffered the aftershock of Elder Gu Yi’s punch just now. Their injuries are not light now. We have to let someone take a look at them in time. Are you okay?”

“I’m fine. Thank you, Miss Jing Xin. Thank you for your protection.”

Qin Yu said solemnly.

No matter what the reason was, he was indeed protected by her faction. If it wasn’t for them, his current situation would be worse.

“This is the direction set by the sect master. Moreover, your strength might also bring us a lot of help. Everyone is just protecting each other.”

Jing Xin shook her head and continued.

“The ‘force’ that you used just now seems to involve a relatively high-level Order of Rules. With your current strength, the price to master this kind of power of rules is probably not small. I sensed that after using it, your soul seemed to have changed. Be careful not to suffer the backlash of the Order of Rules. ”

“Understood. Elder Jing Xin blocked the release of that power just now, leaving only a trace of it. I can still resist this bit of power.”

Qin Yu was secretly surprised. This calming perception was too strong.

He was able to detect the changes in his divine soul. He stared at the Destruction Saber in his sea of consciousness with some fear.

Although this power was powerful, he had sensed something unusual when he used it just now.

Once he used the Destruction Saber and completely released the Order of Rules, his divine soul would be severely affected, and he would become a plaything controlled by the natural order like Pang De.

This gave him a headache, even if it was the Destruction Saber that he had created after comprehending it.

He would still be affected by the terrifying will of the Order. Unless he completely stopped using this power, he would be affected.

If Elder Xin Yue had not cut off this power in time, he would have controlled it. At that time, he would have become the plaything of this Order of Rules.

Only after Jing Xin left did Qin Yu look into his sea of consciousness.

At this moment, most of the black tide had already receded. The remaining power crazily attacked his divine sense, wanting to assimilate it.

“If I can resist this consciousness, will I have some resistance when I release this power in the future?”

Qin Yu held onto his source as he thought silently..
