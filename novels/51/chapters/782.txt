He put away the pill formula and closed his eyes slightly, as if he was searching for something.

The next day.

The Medicine Storehouse opened on time. Many alchemists came to the Medicine Storehouse to collect the herbs, and Qin Yu was no exception.

As soon as he arrived at the Medicine Storehouse, Qin Yu met Hou Xin.

Hou Xin greeted him warmly, “Mr. Qin, are you also here to collect the herbs?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Yes, how was it? Did anything happen last night?”

Hou Xin scratched his head and said, “I don’t have the formula for the concentric pill in my hands. What could have happened?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

At this time, Hou Xin suddenly asked, “Mr. Qin, I heard that you killed Wen Sheng last night? How was it? Did you get the formula for the concentric pill?”

This voice wasn’t loud, but it could reach everyone’s ears.

As soon as these words were said, countless people immediately turned to look at Qin Yu.

Their eyes were filled with intense killing intent and greed.

Hou Xin hurriedly covered his mouth and said in a low voice, “Did... did I say something wrong?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It’s nothing.”

Hou Xin nodded and said, “Then, Mr. Qin, I’ll go in first.”

Qin Yu grunted, but he wasn’t in a hurry to follow him in.

He stood at the door and couldn’t help but glance at the crowd.

Everyone’s gaze also fell on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed, and a trace of a cold smile couldn’t help but appear on his face.

Among these people, there were only seven Martial Marquis, and the rest were all Inner Strength Grandmasters and Inner Strength Past Masters.

Other than Martial Marquises, no one dared to target Qin Yu.

Qin Yu snorted lightly, and then strode into the warehouse of herbs.

While collecting the herbs, Qin Yu swept his gaze over the crowd.

He wanted to see what herbs these people were collecting.

Soon, Qin Yu realized that something was wrong.

The herbs these people were collecting seemed to be the same.

Not only were the herbs the same, but even the quantity was almost the same.

“It really is what I guessed,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He completely confirmed his thoughts.

After receiving the herbs, Qin Yu turned around and left the herb warehouse.

That day, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to refine a pill. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the bed and closed his eyes to rest.

“You aren’t in a hurry at all,” The man with the mustache said as he leaned forward.

Qin Yu opened his eyes and said, “Do you have any ideas? Can you help me find someone?”

The man with the mustache was stunned. He frowned and said, “Find someone? I do have a spell, but I also need something, such as hair.”

“What if there’s nothing? Is there a possibility to find someone through divination?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache snickered. “You’re thinking too much. If you were at the Mighty Realm, you might be able to do it, but a Martial Marquis... It’s impossible.”

Qin Yu could only nod his head.

At night.

The sky gradually darkened.

Everyone seemed to have fallen asleep, but at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

He stood up and swept his gaze outside the window, as if waiting for someone.

Half an hour later, there was a sudden movement outside the door.

Then, waves of strange internal qi surged over.

“They’re here!” Qin Yu’s eyes burst with a bright light!

Before he could finish his words, the door of the room was suddenly shaken open by an internal qi!

Then, several people walked in with big strides!

These people were all in the Martial Marquis realm, and they held all kinds of Magic Artifacts in their hands!

Their Magic Artifacts were all extremely exquisite, and their internal qi was extraordinary.

Qin Yu swept his gaze over the crowd and said indifferently, “Everyone, why have you come to visit us so late at night?”

One of them stepped forward and said with a sneer, “Kid, don’t play dumb! Where’s the pill formula for the concentric pill?”

“That’s right! You killed Wen Sheng, so you must have the pill formula in your hands! Hand over the pill formula and we’ll spare your life!”

Qin Yu sized up the people in front of him and said with a nonchalant smile, “What if I don’t hand it over?”

“Don’t hand it over?” One of them laughed out loud.

“You’re already surrounded by us, so how can you have a choice?”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Surrounded? With just the few of you?”

As he spoke, Qin Yu suddenly raised his palm and then clenched it with his fingers. Instantly, spatial barriers appeared around him one after another!

“Have you all heard of an idiom called ‘inviting a man into a trap’?” Qin Yu raised his brows and asked. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The expressions of these people changed as they frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I deliberately released the news that the concentric pill formula was in my hands. My purpose was to trick you all into coming to our door.”

“Trick us into coming to our door?” Upon hearing this, the few of them immediately laughed out loud.

“That’s right. Of course, don’t misunderstand. I didn’t come here to obtain some secret technique from you. I just wanted to take your Golden Cores for my use.” Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile.

“Kid, you are too arrogant!” Someone stepped forward and shouted.

“Do you think that you alone are a match for the seven of us?”

Qin Yu took a sip of water and said indifferently, “You don’t even have a peak-stage Martial Marquis. How dare you come here to cause trouble?”

Before he finished his words, the water in Qin Yu’s hand was suddenly splashed out!

This water contained Qin Yu’s powerful spiritual power. Its power couldn’t be compared to even bullets!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!!”

Just a few water droplets shattered the knees of several people!

“What a powerful force!” Everyone’s expression changed drastically!

“Everyone, attack together and kill him!” One of them shouted loudly.

He held a Magic Artifact in his hand and walked towards Qin Yu!

The Magic Artifact in his hand flickered with light, and a terrifying power instantly spread out!

“Go to hell!” With the activation of the Magic Artifact, the terrifying power approached Qin Yu!

Qin Yu snorted coldly, clenched his golden fist, and threw a punch to meet it!

“Clang!”

A loud sound spread in an instant! The Magic Artifact shattered with a sound!

“How... how is this possible?!”

Before he could react, Qin Yu had already thrown a punch at him.

Just one punch had shattered his head!

Qin Yu bent down and took out the Golden Core from his dantian. Then, he wiped the blood stains with his sleeve.

“En... I have almost ten Golden Cores,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Their expressions immediately became extremely ugly! Some people even had the intention to retreat and planned to escape!

However, Qin Yu had already set up a spatial barrier, so how could he let them escape?

“Since you are here, then stay!” Qin Yu shouted coldly and immediately stepped forward!

In an instant, golden light rose up everywhere! Wails continued in the room!

In just a short ten minutes, there were seven more corpses in this room!

Qin Yu dug out their dntian and their Golden Cores.

“I already have eighteen Golden Cores.” Qin Yu had a satisfied look on his face.
