Chapter 1019: Chapter 1,019, preparing to return to the country 

Gu Xinghe’s face was full of frost.

He could not believe that this obedient dog in front of him would dare to say such outrageous words!

“Do you know what you’re doing?”Gu Xinghe’s tone was cold and threatening.

He Teng stood not far away and said in a similarly unfriendly tone, “Of course I know what I’m doing.”

“Young Master Gu, I work for you, so you have to give me some benefits.”

Gu Xinghe could not help but laugh out loud, “You’re just a dog. If I throw a bone to you, you have to take it. If you don’t throw it, you won’t even be able to eat SH * t!”

He Teng was already prepared to shed all pretenses of cordiality.

He stood not far away and said calmly, “I don’t think so.”

“Okay! He Teng, let me explain something to you.”Gu Xinghe put his hands behind his back and said calmly.

He paced around the room and said as he walked, “You should know that for a superior, it is necessary to cultivate an antagonist to clear the opponents in the dark and clear the obstacles on the road

“But once the superior clears the obstacles, the antagonist will be eliminated immediately

“In this way, the superior will not only successfully eliminate the opponent and pave the way, but also gain credibility.”

“You and Qin Yu are both such characters.”

Before he finished speaking, Zhai Xing immediately walked in from outside the door.

“He Teng, if you were obedient, I could let you live a few more days, but unfortunately, you are not smart.”Gu Xinghe said with narrowed eyes.

He Teng glanced at Gu Xinghe and then at Zhai Xing. He could not help but snort, “Gu Xinghe, you underestimate me too much. You used me. Do you think I would trust you?”

“If I did not have the ability to escape, why would I come here to shed all pretense of cordiality?”

Gu Xinghe’s expression changed, and he immediately felt uneasy.

If he teng escaped, then the truth would be revealed!

At that time, the reputation of the martial arts association of Jingdu would be completely tarnished!

“Zhai Xing, kill him!”Thinking of this, Gu Xinghe immediately gave the order!

Zhai Xing did not say much. He did not like he teng to begin with, so he immediately curled his finger and sealed the space.

However, he teng was not anxious. He sneered, “Gu Xinghe, you will pay the price for your actions today!”

With that, he Teng’s figure turned into balls of black energy and swam in different directions!

These balls of black energy actually directly passed through the spatial barrier that Zhai Xing had set up and escaped!

Seeing this scene, Gu Xinghe’s expression immediately changed drastically!

“Hurry up and catch him. We must get rid of him no matter what!”Gu Xinghe shouted with all his might!

Zhai Xing agreed and immediately chased after him!

However, he Teng’s method of escaping was unparalleled, even better than Qin Yu’s. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The balls of black energy swam in different directions. Even Zhai Xing did not know which direction to pursue.

After a round of pursuit, they ended up with nothing.

This could not help but make Gu Xinghe in the office extremely angry!

“He actually escaped. We should have gotten rid of him earlier!”Gu Xinghe said angrily.

He paced around the office with an anxious look on his face, as if he didn’t know how to deal with the situation.

“It’s not too late to make amends,”Zhai Xing said from the side.

“Young Master GU, if you take the initiative to admit your mistake, it means that you were bewitched by He Teng and did that. Maybe you can even recover some losses.”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe said furiously, “Take the initiative to admit your mistake? What mistake did I make? I’m the Young Master of the second mystic realm. I admit my mistake to them? In your dreams!”

Zhai Xing opened his mouth.

Thousands of words turned into a sigh in the end.

...

After he teng escaped, he quickly released the news on the martial arts forum.

As an unkillable cockroach, he Teng’s treachery was definitely not inferior to Gu Xinghe’s.

When the two of them worked together, he teng was already on guard.

Not only did he have recordings of the two of them, he even had videos of them when they killed!

On the same day.

He Teng spread the videos and recordings!

“A bunch of idiots. The one who really killed wasn’t Qin Yu, but I, he teng!”

“All of this was planned by Gu Xinghe who was willing to join the martial arts association of Jingdu! In order to Frame Qin Yu, he took advantage of You Idiots!”

“Unfortunately, you idiots don’t have any consciousness, let alone the ability to think independently

“Hahahaha! How ironic! A man who sacrificed many times for you idiots was chased away by you! and the real villain was worshipped as a god by you!”

Countless videos and recordings circulated in the streets.

Even if Gu Xinghe tried his best to delete the messages, he could not delete them all.

These videos seemed to have grown wings. In just one day, they had spread throughout the entire martial arts world.

“I told you that Qin Yu would definitely not do such a thing. Unfortunately, you guys didn’t believe me!”

“Yes, yes, yes. I opposed it too! But you guys didn’t listen!”

“It’s all that Gu Xinghe’s fault. We were deceived by him!”

“As the leader of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu, he actually did such a thing! He must give us an explanation!”

Looking at all the clamoring comments, Gu Xinghe’s face became almost distorted!

“This bunch of ants, how dare they demand an explanation from me!”Gu Xinghe fiercely threw his phone on the ground!

“Good, good! This bunch of ants who don’t know life from death, I’ll stomp you to death!”

“From now on, whoever dares to spread rumors, I’ll kill them!”

Thereafter, Gu Xinghe gathered all the arrangements of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

This included the black gold robe, the purple robe, and even the higher-ups.

On the same day, Gu Xinghe ordered the inspectors to kill anyone who dared to spread the news!

Zhai Xing looked at this scene and could not help but sigh.

He knew very well that this would not solve the problem and would only let the problem continue to ferment.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was commanding the Heaven Gate to attack the various sects in Sheng Kingdom!

In every battle, Qin Yu personally took action. The morale of the entire heaven gate was greatly boosted!

Qin Yu’s prestige in Sheng Kingdom could be said to have returned!

In just a short dozen days, Qin Yu led the Heaven Gate Army and took down more than ten new sects!

This was the largest scale war in the history of glory country, and the speed of reunification was even more strange!

Qin Yu also picked up the plane to cultivate his trusted aides. In a dozen days, the Heaven Gate gathered a total of nearly ten thousand subordinates!

Among them, there were four martial saints and more than thirty martial marquis!

This kind of power was enough to look down on the world!

On this day.

Qin Yu looked at the map in his hand that was filled with drawings, and a trace of a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

“It’s about time to go back.”Qin Yu put down the brush in his hand, and his eyes turned to look in the direction of the fire country’s pyro.
