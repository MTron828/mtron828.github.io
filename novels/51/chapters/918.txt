Chapter 919: Chapter 919, concealing one’s internal Qi 

Yu Qin said somewhat anxiously, “You... You’re leaving already?”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I still have things to do when I’m out.”

Yu Qin’s expression became even more unsightly.

With her naive nature, she thought that Qin Yu would stay in this small mountain village forever.

“Then... will you come back?”Yu Qin asked softly.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know. Maybe, maybe not.”

How Could Qin Yu not see the feelings Yu Qin had for him? However, Qin Yu only had Yan Ruoxue in his heart.

“Thank you very much for bringing me back from the mountain forest. In order to repay you, I have also prepared a gift for you,”Qin Yu said.

He took out a book. The book recorded some alchemy techniques.

These skills were all basic, but they all came from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

For Yu Qin, this was enough.

“I’m leaving,”Qin Yu looked at Yu Qin and said quietly.

Yu Qin pinched the corner of her clothes and didn’t speak for a long time.

Qin Yu wasn’t a soft-hearted person, so he didn’t linger. He turned around and was about to leave.

“Can you leave your phone number?”At this moment, Yu Qin suddenly shouted.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. In the end, he still turned around and wrote down his number.

After he had done all this, Qin Yu left this mountain village.

After three days of recuperation, Qin Yu’s injuries were almost healed.

These few days, the various martial saints were all near the spirit stone mine. They would not pay attention to Qin Yu. Thus, Qin Yu boarded a plane and rushed towards Jingdu.

He arrived at the pavilion of heavenly secrets in Jingdu.

Inside the pavilion of heavenly secrets.

Luo Yang was patrolling around like a young master as usual.

At this moment, Qin Yu walked behind him and patted his shoulder.

“Who the F * ck patted me... Qin... Qin!”

“Shut up!”Qin Yu coldly interrupted Luo Yang’s words.

Luo Yang hurriedly covered his mouth, but the panic and fear on his face could not be concealed.

“Where’s your father?”Qin Yu asked.

Luo Yang quickly replied, “He’s... He’s at the back.”

“Follow me to find him.”Qin Yu dragged Luo Yang and walked towards the villa behind the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

They arrived at the main hall of the villa.

When their eyes met, Luo Jingyu’s heart was filled with shock.

Everyone knew that all the martial saints were looking for Qin Yu. Qin Yu was on the verge of death.

However, the more such a person was, the more terrifying he was. No one could guarantee that he would not do something crazy.

“Mr. Qin, are you here for the sword? I have already made the sword for you. I will go get it for you now.”Luo Jingyu took the initiative to speak.

After he had finished speaking, he rushed to a room and walked out with the bronze sword in his hand.

Qin Yu took the sword and saw that the sword was already covered in a scarlet color.

When Qin Yu’s spiritual power entered the sword, rays of demonic light flashed on the sword.

“Not bad.”Qin Yu praised from the bottom of his heart. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Although you didn’t say anything good, your skill in refining artifacts is undeniable.”

Luo Jingyu smiled embarrassedly and didn’t dare to say anything more.

“I’m here today because I have another matter that I need your help with. Don’t worry, if it can be done, I will remember your favor,”said Qin Yu.

Luo Jingyu hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “I don’t dare, I don’t dare. It’s me who can serve you...”

“Alright, stop talking nonsense. I need a magical artifact to cover my face and internal Qi,”Qin Yu interrupted Luo Jingyu.

Luo Jingyu’s expression changed slightly.

He instantly understood Qin Yu’s intention.

However, Luo Jingyu was filled with hatred toward Qin Yu. How could he be willing to help?

“Mr. Qin, it’s not that I don’t want to help. I really don’t have such a spiritual artifact here because...”

“Bullsh * T.”Qin Yu interrupted Luo Jingyu again.

He slowly stood up and said coldly, “Luo Jingyu, you’re a Master Weaponsmith. The Heaven’s secret pavilion is on par with the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. How could you not have such a spiritual artifact?”

Luo Jingyu stammered and could not speak for a moment.

“What? Do you want me to die at the hands of the martial saint so that you can take revenge?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

Luo Jingyu immediately turned pale with fright and hurriedly said, “I absolutely have no such intention!”

Traces of murderous intent were emitted from Qin Yu’s body.

He looked at Luo Jingyu coldly and said, “If you hand over the magic weapon now, I will remember your favor. But if I force you to hand it over, I will kill you.”

Luo Jingyu instantly fell into silence.

After thinking for a moment, he nodded and said, “Alright, wait a moment.”

After saying that, Luo Jingyu turned around and returned to his room.

He rummaged through the boxes and cabinets.

A few minutes later, Luo Jingyu came out with a hat.

The entire hat looked extremely ordinary, but it had an internal Qi of the Great Dao flowing from it.

“This thing is called thousand faces. I got it by chance,”Luo Jingyu said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu took the hat.

The hat was somewhat similar to the one Fang Yue had given him back then, but the quality of the two was completely different.

After taking the hat, Qin Yu immediately put it on his head.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt as if the Great Dao had been disturbed, and his internal Qi had become extremely concealed.

Not only that, after wearing a thousand faces, his face would be even more concealed.

At a glance, he could only see a thin layer of fog. He wanted to see his face clearly, but he couldn’t.

“Thank you.”Qin Yu put away his hat and cupped his hands to Luo Jingyu.

Luo Jingyu was overwhelmed by the favor and quickly returned the greeting, “You’re too kind.”

Qin Yu wore a thousand faces and turned around to leave.

After Qin Yu left, Luo Yang couldn’t wait to run over.

“Dad, he has already taken a lot of things from us! Now he took thousand faces away. This is too much!”Luo Yang said angrily.

Luo Jingyu sat there and didn’t speak for a long time.

“Dad, are you going to let him go just like that!”Luo Yang said angrily.

Luo Jingyu glanced at Luo Yang and said, “Then what do you want?”

“What do I want? Hehe, I have many ways to deal with him!”Luo Yang said with a vicious face.

“I have some friendship with Gu Xinghe during this period of time. I will call him now and tell him about this!”

After saying that, Luo Yang took out his cell phone and called Gu Xinghe.
