Chapter 1011: In chapter 1,011, the martial saint’s heavenly tribulation descended 

Not far away, Qin Yu’s divine sense froze at 23 steps.

He took a step with great difficulty, as if he wanted to take the 24th step.

Unfortunately, no matter how hard Qin Yu tried, he was unable to take the 24th step.

“Looks like 23 steps is the limit.”Qin Yu sighed.

Not far away, the pavilion master could not help but say, “At this stage, let alone 23 steps, even three steps are difficult. Don’t be unsatisfied.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and sighed, “Yes, I should be satisfied too.”

After saying that, his divine sense flew back to his main body, and his eyes opened with a swoosh.

“The improvement brought by this scarlet fire leaf is really not ordinary,”said Xiang Danqing.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “En, I only obtained it by chance.”

“Should we try to transcend the Heavenly Tribulation Next?”Asked the pavilion master.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and nodded, “Yes, I don’t want to waste any more time.”

“Let’s do it here. The two of US will protect you,”said Xiang Danqing.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly, “Forget it. If we do it here, I’m afraid we will destroy your Dragon Transformation Valley.”

“It’s not that exaggerated,”said Xiang Danqing with a wave of his hand.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It’s really not that exaggerated. Senior, please help me find another place.”

Xiang Danqing did not insist anymore.

He brought Qin Yu out of the Dragon Transformation Valley and planned to find another place.

After Qin Yu’s reminder, Xiang Danqing brought Qin Yu to a place that was extremely far from the herbal field.

This place was also a valley. The scenery was pleasant, and the surroundings were even quieter.

“Let’s do it here,”Qin Yu agreed.

Although Qin Yu’s Dantian had already recovered, he still felt a little worried.

The last heavenly tribulation was still vivid in his mind.

Qin Yu had never seen such a scale before.

“I’ll have to trouble the two seniors to stay away from me.”Qin Yu bowed.

After he finished speaking, he sat down cross-legged and began the second heavenly tribulation of the martial saint!

Strands of divine sense surged into his dantian once again.

At this moment, the golden core in his Dantian also met the divine sense.

As the two fused, the heavenly tribulation of the martial saint descended once again!

Large patches of dark clouds pressed down on the top of his head. The extremely strong pressure made it difficult for him to breathe.

“The dark clouds are pressing down on the city and trying to destroy it.”Looking at the dense dark clouds in the sky, Xiang Danqing could not help but sigh.

“Crack!”

At this moment, a heavenly tribulation descended and smashed on Qin Yu’s body!

Seeing such a heavenly tribulation, Xiang Danqing’s face immediately turned pale!

“No wonder this kid told us to stay away from him. This kind of heavenly tribulation will really destroy my Dragon Transformation Valley!”Xiang Danqing said in surprise.

“This is only the first heavenly tribulation. The next heavenly tribulation will probably be even more terrifying. Let’s hide a little further away.”

The two of them shot backward and looked at Qin Yu from a distance. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After recovering his golden core, Qin Yu no longer needed to control his divine sense.

All his energy was used to welcome the heavenly tribulation. Compared to last time, this time was obviously much easier.

Qin Yu easily faced the first three heavenly tribulation.

In the blink of an eye, it was the fourth heavenly tribulation.

Crack

The Heavenly Lightning that defeated Qin Yu condensed in the dark clouds.

This time, the time it took seemed to be shorter.

Qin Yu stood up. The clothes on his body had been shattered, revealing his strong muscles.

“Come on, I won’t be easily defeated this time,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The heavenly tribulation seemed to be enraged. With a loud bang, the heavenly tribulation smashed toward Qin Yu!

Just like last time, everything it touched was instantly turned into ashes!

The huge rocks and rivers were evaporated in an instant!

Qin Yu stared at the heavenly tribulation as golden light erupted all over his body. His eyes were filled with determination!

The Heavenly Tribulation was falling towards Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed. The sizzling sound of it increased the sense of pressure!

“Come!”

Just as the heavenly tribulation was about to fall, Qin Yu let out an angry roar and his body soared into the sky. At this moment, the golden light exploded to the extreme!

“Boom!”

The Golden and blue colors collided in an instant! The two forces formed an intense collision!

The surrounding rocks were instantly shattered. The vast and mighty forces were rapidly spreading out in all directions!

“Not good! Run quickly!”Xiang Danqing cursed in his heart, and pulled the pavilion master as he turned around and left!

The shockwave formed by these two powers swept out in all directions!

Even though Qin Yu had deliberately chosen a place that was very far away from the Dragon Transformation Valley, the Dragon Transformation Valley was still not spared! It was directly destroyed by this power, and the lush and verdant medicinal herbs in the medicinal field directly withered!

“My Herbal Field!”Xiang Danqing immediately widened his eyes.

“Alright, follow me back to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. I’ll compensate you.”Pavilion master said with a frown.

The two forces were still fighting. Blue veins bulged on Qin Yu’s body. All of his golden light condensed on his fist. Then, with a furious roar, the golden light instantly soared and actually directly dispersed the Blue Heavenly Tribulation!

Qin Yu fell to the ground, in high spirits. He raised his head to look at the sky and said coldly, “There are four more. Come On!”

Perhaps it was Qin Yu’s arrogant words that angered the sky, and the dark clouds became even thicker.

Heavenly Tribulation after heavenly tribulation brewed within the dark clouds, like a shy woman stretching out her ankles. A trace of lightning power leaked out from the dark clouds.

However, this trace of lightning did not descend for a long time. Instead, it was hidden within the dark clouds and did not descend for a long time.

“What? What are you waiting for!”Qin Yu pointed at the dark clouds and shouted.

Before his voice had faded, this bolt of lightning came crashing down with a swoosh!

That speed was extremely fast. Before Qin Yu could even see it clearly, he was directly smashed onto the ground!

“What the hell is this...”just as Qin Yu was about to get up, the Lightning actually exploded on Qin Yu’s body!

In an instant, Qin Yu’s flesh and blood flew everywhere, and his body shattered!

“What the F * ck... Are You Messing with me?”Qin Yu could not help but curse.

Before his body could reassemble, the remaining three actually descended at the same time!

“F * ck... Three Heavenly Tribulation at the same time? !”Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change drastically!
