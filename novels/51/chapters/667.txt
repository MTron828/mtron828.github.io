Chapter 668: The Self-Humiliated Han Wei! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s expression was ferocious, his pupils constricted, and cold sweat kept dripping down his forehead.

“Qin Yu...” Yan Ruoxue whispered.

Looking at Qin Yu’s appearance, Yan Ruoxue felt her heart ache.

How much effort did he put in that he couldn’t even get any peace when he was unconscious...

“What are you shouting for?” Someone walked over from the side.

“You can’t fail? You’re already a prisoner.”

Qin Yu looked around, and the expression on his face gradually eased up.

“Qin Yu... are you okay?” Yan Ruoxue’s weak voice entered Qin Yu’s ears.

Qin Yu hurriedly got up. He grabbed the bars of the prison and looked at Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue...” Qin Yu opened his mouth.

Yan Ruoxue’s tears flowed down.

“I’m sorry... I’m sorry...” Yan Ruoxue shook her head as she wept.

“If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have suffered such hardship. I don’t want you to become a the cream of the crop among men. I only want you to be safe...”

Yan Ruoxue’s voice was intermittent because of her sobs.

Her tears streaked across her fair neck and wet her clothes.

Qin Yu grabbed the railing and hurriedly shook his head. “No, Ruoxue. If it weren’t for you, my life would have been meaningless.”

“You gave me all this, and I chose it myself...”

But how would Yan Ruoxue know about Qin Yu’s plan? She only knew that Qin Yu had been locked up and that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wouldn’t let him go.

At that moment, the prison’s door opened.

Then, Qu Xie walked in slowly.

He sized up Qin Yu, then glanced at Yan Ruoxue and said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu, you should thank me for allowing you to reunite with your beloved before you die.”

“Qu Xie, f * ck you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The sudden profanity stunned Qu Xie for a moment.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “You are already a prisoner. Aren’t you going to behave?”

At this point, Qu Xie changed the topic and said, “If you forcefully raise your realm, you will be unconscious for at least half a month. You woke up in just one day. I have to say, you are really a talent.”

“Qu Xie.”

Qin Yu was about to speak when Yan Ruoxue suddenly shouted.

Qu Xie turned around and walked to Yan Ruoxue. He smiled and said, “Miss Yan, what’s the matter?”

Yan Ruoxue looked at Qu Xie coldly and said, “If you let Qin Yu go, I can agree to any of your requests.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

“Ruoxue, don’t! And don’t beg him for me!” Qin Yu shouted anxiously! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xie Qu glanced at Qin Yu and then said with a nonchalant smile, “Miss Yan, do the two of you really have such a deep relationship?”

Yan Ruoxue said coldly, “People like you obviously don’t understand. You probably have never loved anyone in your life.”

“Hahaha!” Hearing that, Qu Xie couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

He put his hands behind his back and said with a nonchalant smile, “Miss Yan, what you said makes sense. I really don’t understand love.”

“Cut the crap and let Qin Yu go,” Yan Ruoxue said with a cold expression.

Qu Xie shook his head and said, “Miss Yan, the higher-ups have given the order to kill Qin Yu, no matter what the price is! So... I can’t agree to your request.”

Yan Ruoxue widened her eyes and couldn’t help but curse, “Qu Xie! Let Qin Yu go! Otherwise, I won’t spare you!”

“Hahaha!” Qu Xie laughed again.

He looked at Yan Ruoxue coldly and said with a nonchalant smile, “Miss Yan, if Old Mister Yan was still alive, I would have to think twice about what you said, but now... Hehe.”

“Qu Xie, f * ck you! I will kill you sooner or later!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse!

Qu Xie snorted. “You don’t have that chance. Once the documents are sent, we will kill you immediately!”

At this point, Qu Xie suddenly thought of something.

He patted his head and said, “Oh right, an old friend is coming to see you. I almost forgot.”

After saying that, Qu Xie turned around and walked out.

Not long after he left, the prison door opened again.

Two people stood at the door. One was Qu Xie, and the other was Han Wei!

“Young Master Han, I won’t give you much time. Ten minutes at most,” Qu Xie urged.

Han Wei bowed slightly and said, “President Qu, don’t worry. I won’t stay for long.”

Qu Xie grunted and waved his hand, indicating for the people around him to bring him in.

“By the way, President Qu, how is Qin Yu’s condition now?” Han Wei suddenly asked.

Xie Qu snorted. “He forcefully raised his realm and hasn’t recovered yet. He’s no different from an ordinary person.”

“Then I’m relieved.” A cold smile flashed across Han Wei’s face.

Then, Han Wei strode into the prison.

He walked all the way to the door of Qin Yu and said condescendingly, “Tsk, aren’t you very arrogant? Why have you become like this now?”

Qin Yu looked at Han Wei coldly and said, “What are you doing here?”

“Of course I’m here to visit you.” Han Wei narrowed his eyes and said.

“Qin Yu, do you understand now? Even if you put in all your effort, you’re still just a lowly ant! In the end, you’ll still be crushed to death by people like us!”

“So what if you have talent? Your social background predestined everything!”

The more Han Wei spoke, the crazier he became. He looked like a villain who had achieved his goal.

Qin Yu looked at Han Wei coldly and said, “To be honest, you are really pitiful now. You are like a cockroach. It seems that the last battle left a psychological scar on you.”

When this topic was brought up, Han Wei’s expression suddenly changed!

He glared at Qin Yu and said word by word, “I said before that I would step on you in front of Yan Ruoxue! Now, the opportunity has finally come!”

“Hehe, you have to rely on the Jingdu Martial Arts Association to fulfill your wish? How pitiful,” Qin Yu mocked mercilessly.

Han Wei was furious. He looked at the prison staff and said, “Open the door for me!”

“Okay.” The staff did not hesitate and immediately walked forward to open the prison door.

During this time, Han Wei glanced at Yan Ruoxue proudly and said, “Yan Ruoxue, is this the man you love? I will make him kneel in front of me today and let you know how bad your choice is!”

As he spoke, the prison’s door slowly opened.

Han Wei strode in. His aura surged and he said coldly, “Qin Yu, it’s time for you to pay the price!”

After saying that, Han Wei immediately clenched threw a punch at Qin Yu!

“Bang!”

However, the expected scene did not appear.

Not only did Qin Yu not receive the punch, but he reached out and grabbed Han Wei’s fist!

Han Wei’s expression changed, and he struggled desperately, but found that he could not break free at all!
