Chapter 2040: The Identity of a Chaotic Body!

Under the suggestion of Saintess Gu, these people temporarily dispersed and ended the discussion.

As for the Chaos Grave, the nine great aristocratic families did not forcefully occupy it. Whoever was not afraid of death could enter.

Even though the Chaos Grave revealed its terror to everyone, some people still could not resist the temptation and stepped into the Chaos Grave. In the end, they either became tomb slaves or turned into ashes.

Some powerful cultivators managed to escape, but their primordial spirits and physical bodies were appallingly and severely injured.

“I don’t believe I can’t break into this Chaos Grave!”

Suddenly, an angry roar erupted into the sky. Then a cultivator holding a Saint Weapon strode into the Chaos Grave!

He stepped into the Chaos Grave with the help of the Saint Weapon. The Saint Weapon emitted waves of terrifying Holy Power resisting the Chaos Grave!

The Saint Weapon shattered and turned into dust In less than half a second!

The cultivator turned into ashes amidst a series of miserable screams!

Seeing this scene, everyone fell silent. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Even a Saint Weapon failed to resist the Chaos Grave! This was despairing news for everyone!

“You’re courting death.” Yan Guyun sneered, seeing the scene.

Qin Yu’s expression turned even uglier.

“A complete Saint Weapon is gone in half a second…” Qin Yu murmured.

A Saint Weapon was a rare existence to any aristocratic families in the Holy Region!

However, such a noble magical artifact could not even last half a second in front of the Chaos Grave. It was too terrifying!

“Idiot! You think you can break into the Chaos Grave with a Saint Weapon?” Yan Yunfan mocked mercilessly.

Beside Qin Yu, the man with the mustache shook his head slightly and said, “These people still don’t know what it means to have a Great Success chaotic body. Although the tomb he left behind can’t compare to the tomb of an Immortal Emperor, it’s not much different.

“Unless he has a tribulation magical artifact, there’s a glimmer of hope.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Then she looked at the man with the mustache and said, “In other words, I can enter the Chaos Grave if I rely on a tribulation magical artifact?”

“It’s just a possibility,” the man with the mustache said in a deep voice.

“After all, the chaotic body isn’t an ordinary physique. It’s hard to compare it to ordinary tribulation magical artifacts.”

Qin Yu could not help but gasp. The shock in his eyes could not be any greater!

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He suddenly looked at the man with the mustache and said, “In other words, it’s very likely that the people of the nine great aristocratic families carry tribulation magical artifacts?”

“Most likely not,” The man with the mustache shook his head.

“Tribulation magical artifacts are important top-notch treasures for any aristocratic family. The same goes for the nine great aristocratic families. They won’t easily take out their tribulation magical artifacts to avoid people taking the opportunity to create trouble.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

He patted his chest and murmured, “If they bring the tribulation magical artifacts, there’s no need to think of a way out. Instead, just wait for death here.”

“Did you see those nine sanctums?” A hint of seriousness appeared on the face of the man with the mustache.

Qin Yu nodded. The nine sanctums were flashing with different scenes.

“Not many people in the world would leave behind nine sanctums,” the man with the mustache said coldly. “I only know two people.”

Qin Yu did not dare to say much. He stared at the man with the mustache and waited for him to continue.

The man with the mustache looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “One is the masked woman you are familiar with. The other is the Great Success chaotic body, Wu Ji. ”

“Wu Ji?” Qin Yu frowned. Obviously, he had never heard of this name before.

However, Qin Yu was curious about Xiao Yu.

“What does it mean to leave behind nine sanctums?” Qin Yu asked.

“Leaving behind nine sanctums means that the attainments of these two people in cultivation have already reached an unattainable cultivation realm. Each sanctum contains the true essence and wisdom of their different cultivation realms, allowing cultivators to realize, comprehend, and cultivate within,” the man with the mustache said in a deep voice.

“The nine sanctums represent their nine cultivation realms, and each cultivation realm is the peak of their cultivation. If you want to integrate all the nine cultivation realms, you’ll be reborn, and your cultivation will improve greatly.”

The man with the mustache looked at Qin Yu and said, “Everyone only has one dao technique, and they will walk on this dao technique for the rest of their lives until they reach the peak. Not to mention changing their dao minds, even if their dao mind is in disorder, they may remain stagnant eternally. Moreover, it’s nine dao minds.”

Hiss!

Hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly gasped!

Of course, he understood what dao mind meant! On the path of cultivation, the most important thing was to stabilize one’s dao mind, not to mention cultivating nine dao minds!

“Rumor has it that the Great Dao of heaven and earth has changed numerous times. It has experienced the ebb and flow of the tides and even the Degenerate Age,” the man with the mustache said.

“It has been many years since the Immortal Emperor Stage appeared. That’s why the nine great aristocratic families could maintain their stabilities. There was no lack of geniuses during this period, but if there was no Immortal Emperor for a long time, it means there was a problem with the dao technique of heaven and earth that the Immortal Emperor couldn’t appear.

“Therefore, some people with peerless talent have attained dao in an alternate path. They have cultivated many types of dao minds and integrated nine types of dao minds. Even if they don’t step into the Immortal Emperor Stage, their strength isn’t much different.”

The more Qin Yu listened to him, the more shocked he became. It was simply refreshing Qin Yu’s worldview!

To attain dao in an alternate path? It was too terrifying!

“If it’s Wu Ji’s Big Grave, it’ll be interesting.” The man with the mustache narrowed his eyes slightly, and his face revealed unprecedented excitement and seriousness.

“If you know this, don’t the people of the nine great aristocratic families know too?” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache curiously.

The man with the mustache sneered and said, “People are major or good at different fields. They might not know as much as I do. From what they have done, these people don’t know anything about it.”

“Why?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache stroked his chin and said, “If they knew, they wouldn’t have discussed it here. Once Wu Ji’s Big Grave emerges, no one can guarantee what’s inside.

“What if Wu Ji’s scriptures are inside? Does the Si family want it or not? I don’t believe they will give up Wu Ji’s scriptures and only want that corpse.

...

“In other words, if the corpse lying in the grave is Wu Ji, the other aristocratic families will be reluctant to give up Wu Ji’s corpse.”

“Based on what you said, this tomb is very likely to trigger a riot if Wu Ji is lying inside or even cause the nine great aristocratic families to fall apart…” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu, sneered, and said, “It’s very likely.”

Hearing this, a trace of a smile couldn’t help but appear on Qin Yu’s face..
