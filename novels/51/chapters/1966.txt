1967 The Secret of Spirit Coins

The Prince of Great Xia looked fascinated as if he was reminiscing about the glory of the past.

“Do you know that in the entire history of Great Xia, only the Immortal Slaying Sect had suppressed Great Xia for a short period?” the Prince of Great Xia sighed and said.

“That’s a terrifying sect. Its ruling power is very much stronger when compared to the current nine great aristocratic families.”

“Did the Immortal Slaying sect have an Immortal Emperor before?” Qin Yu was stunned before he frowned and asked.

!!

“That’s right.” The prince nodded. “Ever since the birth of the Immortal Emperor, Grand Xia began to decline. Of course, this is only the recent history of Great Xia. As for how glorious Great Xia was in the past, I have no idea.

Qin Yu had some doubts in his heart.

Since Great Xia was once so glorious, how could they not have an Immortal Emperor? Without an Immortal Emperor, how could one rule the entire Holy Region?

Could it be the Immortal Emperor cultivation realm had only been discovered in recent years?

“It’s a pity that those are all in the past.” The prince sat down again, his eye expression becoming desolate.

Qin Yu consoled him, saying, “A day will come when all the aristocratic families fall. Nothing exists forever.”

“Yes.” The prince sighed repeatedly. “I’ve indeed become the last prince.”

Seeing the prince’s expression, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think.

Had the Prince of Great Xia really given up? Was his dejection an act?

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t say it out loud. No one knew what he was thinking.

“By the way, Your Highness, I have another doubt,” Qin Yu said.

The prince nodded, signaling Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu flipped his palm and took out the card.

“I really don’t understand the use of these spirit coins. How did they become the unified currency of the Holy Region?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“If they had no value, these spirit coins were not worth anything at all. As for cultivation, who would care about a virtual number?”

A trace of pride flashed across the prince’s face again.

“It seems that Mr. Qin doesn’t know much about the history of the Holy Region,” he said, feeling rather proud.

“Indeed.” Qin Yu nodded. He had only been in the Holy Region for a few years, so he only had a superficial understanding of everything.

The prince smiled and said, “These spirit coins were born from the Great Xia Royal Family! And all the spirit coins are controlled by Great Xia!”

Qin Yu was shocked when he heard that.

“In other words… The current royal family still controls the distribution of currency?” Qin Yu said in shock.

“That’s right,” the prince nodded and said. “Even today, the spirit coins are still in our control.”

“Could this be the reason why the nine great aristocratic families still respect the royal family?” Qin Yu scratched his head. “If that’s the case, doesn’t that mean Your Highness can issue currency at will? ”

“Issue currency?” The prince was stunned. He quickly shook his head and said, “Mr. Qin, it’s not as simple. Although these spirit coins are issued by the royal family, they don’t really belong to the royal family. Or should I say… The royal family doesn’t have any ability to produce spirit coins.”

Qin Yu became even more confused.

The prince continued to explain. “These spirit coins aren’t issued by people. They were born by themselves in the depths of the royal family. Only those with royal blood can get their hands on these spirit coins.”

“They were born by themselves?” Qin Yu asked in surprise.

“That’s right. In other words, spirit coins are dao techniques. For example, in the Golden Age, more spirit coins were born,” the prince said.

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

No wonder the nine great aristocratic families didn’t dare to do anything to the prince. He was the only one who could obtain the currency.

At this moment, Qin Yu also understood why the prince never had a child. It was to ensure he was the only member of the royal family living in this world.

In this way, not only would the nine great aristocratic families not dare to harm the prince, they would even do their best to keep him alive.

“But… What’s the use of these spirit coins?” Qin Yu asked.

The prince also took out a card from his palm, and with a thought, the card emitted tiny light spots.

These light spots entered the prince’s glabella and disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu’s eyes were wide open. He got up and said, “This… What is this?”

“Dao technique, part of the rules,” the prince said.

“In other words, this thing can be used for cultivation.”

Qin Yu became nervous.

All along, Qin Yu had thought that this currency was useless. He had never expected to use it directly for cultivation. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Thinking of this, Qin Yu tried to activate the card like the prince.

True enough, the card emitted a trace of golden light, which then disappeared into Qin Yu’s glabella.

It was a pity that Qin Yu could not feel anything out of it. Instead, her mind was blank.

“With your current cultivation realm, the effect of absorbing this thing is minimal,” the prince said.

“Oh?” Qin Yu touched her chin and said,” In other words, the higher the cultivation realm, the more effective it is?”

“That’s right,” the prince said with a smile.

“If this is the case, doesn’t it mean this item is useless to ordinary cultivators?” Qin Yu scratched his head.

“That’s right. However, the experts like this item. Therefore, they have to accept spirit coins. They can only use spirit coins to exchange for treasures for cultivation. After all, most of the resources are in the hands of the experts,” the prince said.

Qin Yu finally understood.

Those experts who needed spirit coins to cultivate could unscrupulously make spirit coins the only cultivation resource.

This was also the reason why many people were willing to exchange items rather than use spirit coins.

“Thank you very much to Your Highness for clearing my doubts.” Qin Yu bowed.

“Don’t mention it. You don’t have to thank me,” the prince said with a smile.

“Your Highness, I have one more thing,” Qin Yu spoke again.

The prince nodded, signaling Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu said softly, “About the masked woman… Do many people know about it?”

“Not many, but definitely not too few either,” the prince said.

“Therefore, you have to be more careful. Now, you can use all sorts of methods to force the Si family not to attack you. However, if your relationship with the masked woman is confirmed, they will no longer abide by any principles and do their best to get rid of you,” the prince said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He quickly waved his hand and said, “I don’t know any masked woman at all. I picked up that bracelet.”

“Hahaha! That’s good,” the prince said with a smile.

“In the history books of the Great Xia, it was said that there was an organization in the universe called Satan. It seemed to be linked inextricably to the masked woman. Many books have already indirectly confirmed this.”

The prince said casually.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically as his heart filled with fright!
