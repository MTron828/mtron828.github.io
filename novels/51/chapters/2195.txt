2196 I’ll Give You a Chance

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Uncle Qun was slightly startled, his eye expression clearly showing a hint of displeasure.

He suppressed the displeasure in his heart and said indifferently, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu raised his hand, pointed at the Green Spirit Tree, and said, “Your cultivation relies too much on the Green Spirit Tree, only forcefully absorbing the spiritual energy. But in reality, absorbing too much spiritual energy won’t have any effect at all. It might even backfire.”

Then Qin Yu pointed at Yun Fengqing and Yun Qingyun, who were cultivating.

Their faces were flushed red, indicating that their bodies had reached their limits in endurance.

“Look at their conditions. This spiritual energy can’t be absorbed at all. Instead, it will become a burden. Without the support of the Meridian Circulation Technique, this spiritual energy will only bring about a burden,” Qin Yu said.

Uncle Qun naturally did not believe Qin Yu’s words. However, he was a polite person, so he did not say anything else. He only smiled faintly.

But Yun Fengqing, who was cultivating, was angered by Qin Yu’s words.

He suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Qin Yu coldly. “Who do you think you are? How dare you boast shamelessly here? My Yun family’s cultivation method has been passed down for thousands of years. How can you understand it?”

Facing Yun Fengqing’s disrespectful words, Qin Yu was not angry. He did not even feel anything.

Perhaps it was because of the change in his state of mind after becoming a True Saint, or the big difference in strength between the two, there was no fluctuation in Qin Yu’s emotions.

He just said indifferently, “I can give you the Meridian Circulation Technique. When absorbing spiritual energy, you can rely on this technique to accelerate the absorption of spiritual energy.”

“Hahaha! You’re really good at bragging!” Yun Fengqing sneered and said.

The argument between the two woke Yun Qingyun up from her cultivation. She pulled Yun Fengqing’s arm and whispered, “Brother Fengqing, perhaps what our friend said is true…” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“True my ass! Who knows what he’s up to? He? What kind of decent Meridian Circulation Technique could it be? I’m afraid it won’t bring any benefits. Instead, it will disturb our minds!” Yun Fengqing berated.

Qin Yu did not want to argue with them much. He raised his finger, and a golden light spot flickered on it.

The next moment, Qin Yu raised his finger and pointed at Yun Qingyun’s glabella.

In an instant, the Meridian Circulation Technique was transmitted into Yun Qingyun’s mind.

It was so fast that even Uncle Qun could not stop it.

Uncle Qun looked at Qin Yu in surprise, as if he had not expected his speed to be so fast.

“I obtained this Meridian Circulation Technique on Earth back then. At that time, I climbed the stairway to heaven to obtain this thing to increase my strength as soon as possible. It took me a lot of effort. Now that I’m passing it on to you, you can take it as a token of gratitude for allowing me to board the ship,” Qin Yu said.

Qin Yu obtained this Meridian Circulation Technique at the Divine Alchemist Pavilion back then. At that time, Qin Yu took a tremendous risk to obtain this technique.

“Sister Qingyun, don’t listen to his nonsense! Brat, what did you do to Sister Qingyun?”Yun Fengqing suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Qin Yu’s collar. He then exerted force wanting to lift Qin Yu into the air.

However, in the next moment, Yun Fengqing’s expression changed slightly. No matter how much strength he used, he could not move Qin Yu at all!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body trembled slightly, and Yun Fengqing’s body instantly retreated a few steps.

“You can choose to use or not to use this Meridian Circulation Technique. I’ve already given it to you, and the decision is yours,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“Of course, the advancement in the cultivation realm is definitely not relying on the accumulation of spiritual energy. It is more about comprehending the dao technique, especially when breaking through a major realm.” Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu glanced at Yun Fengqing, clearly hinting at something.

However, Yun Fengqing was blinded by anger and did not take Qin Yu’s words seriously at all.

Qin Yu did not stay any longer. He turned around and returned to his courtyard.

Uncle Qun looked at Qin Yu’s back and could not help but rub his chin. He whispered, “This person does not seem as simple as he appears to be…”

“Hmph, he’s just putting on an act!” Yun Fengqing said somewhat defiantly.

…

In the courtyard, another three days went by while Qin Yu was sitting.

He slowly opened his eyes and could not help but feel a little lonely.

“I really do not know when I can return to the Holy Region…” Qin Yu murmured.

At this moment, a loud bang suddenly came from the courtyard. Following that, the warship shook violently!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He extended his divine sense and covered the entire warship. Soon, he discovered an even larger warship besides the Yun family’s warship!

In addition, ten or so gigantic Demonic Beasts surrounded the Yun family’s warship!

“Hmm?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, rubbing his chin. He said in a low voice, “Finally, all of you have arrived…”

On the deck of the Yun family, Uncle Qun, Yun Fengqing, and Yun Qingyun were glaring at the warship opposite them.

“Hand over the Green Spirit Tree on your ship, and I might consider sparing your lives.” A burly man was standing on the dragon-shaped warship.

The burly man held two gigantic axes and looked at the Yun family with a faint smile.

Yun Qingfeng shouted, “Where did this villain come from? How dare you rob my Yun Family’s warship? I think you’re tired of living!”

With that, Yun Fengqing formed a seal with his palm. A terrifying light burst out from his hand and headed straight for the burly man!

The burly man’s face turned cold, and he said coldly, “You’re courting death.”

With a wave of his hand, the burly man wiped out that beam of light easily!

Yun Fengqing’s expression changed as he exclaimed, “How is that possible?”

Uncle Qun felt a little uneasy as he whispered, “This person’s strength is far above yours and mine. I’m afraid he’s already reached the True Saint cultivation realm.”

“True Saint!” Hearing these two words, the faces of the Yun family members instantly turned ashen, and Yun Fengqing’s face revealed a look of horror!

“Uncle Qun, what should we do now…” Yun Qingyun said helplessly.

Uncle Qun waved his hand and walked forward, bowing. “My friend, this Green Spirit Tree is the supreme treasure of my Yun family. The family head has instructed that it must never be abandoned, regardless of the circumstances. How about we negotiate for a different condition?”

But the burly man had obviously lost his patience. He looked coldly at Uncle Qun and said, “You guys talk too much nonsense. It’s better to kill you all before taking away the Green Spirit Tree.”

With that, the burly man waved his hand, and the ten or so Demonic Beasts instantly began moving restlessly!

A terrifying internal qi spread throughout the entire warship! A random wisp of it made everyone from the Yun family tremble!

The ten or so demonic beasts emitted an extremely terrifying murderous aura, and their bodies were covered in radiant light!

That radiant light was ready to be released. Once it was released, everyone from the Yun family would die without a doubt!

“What… What should we do now…” Yun Qingfeng was also panicking at this moment. He was trembling and his face was ashen.

“Boom!”

Right at this moment, the ten or so Demonic Beasts emitted an extremely terrifying light heading straight for the warship!

Uncle Qun closed his eyes slightly, clearly having given up on resisting.

However, after waiting for a long time, the warship was still safe and sound. The ten or so radiant lights had actually disappeared without a trace!

“Hmm?” Everyone frowned slightly and was instantly somewhat puzzled.

Raising their heads and looking over, they saw Qin Yu slowly walking out from the warship.

He looked at the burly man opposite him and said indifferently, “I don’t want to kill anyone. Hand over your warship, and I can spare your lives.”

The burly man was stunned for a moment before he burst into laughter and said, “Are you crazy? Spare our lives? Just you?”

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

In the face of absolute strength, the last thing one needed to do was to talk nonsense.

Qin Yu raised his palm and clenched it gently.

“Boom!”

A terrifying explosion instantly exploded the void! Those ten or so Demonic Beasts were directly crushed into a bloody mist!

All of this happened too soon. No one could even see what happened clearly!
