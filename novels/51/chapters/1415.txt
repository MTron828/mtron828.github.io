Chapter 1416: Chapter 1416, Heavenly Prison 1

Qin Yu was tied up and thrown in the middle of the hall.

It was unknown what kind of treasure he had used to make Qin Yu unable to move.

This kind of chain could restrict a person’s spiritual power to prevent the person being captured from escaping.

The sect master sat in his high hall with his eyes slightly closed. No one knew what he was thinking about.

Ten minutes later.

Many elders of the Heavenly Cloud sect came to the great hall one after another.

When they saw Qin Yu tied up, they couldn’t help but show joy on their faces. Of course, there were also some who looked at Qin Yu curiously.

“This is that Qin Yu?”

“He doesn’t look special. Does he really have such a great ability?”

“He made our heavenly cloud sect suffer many times. If he didn’t have the ability, how could he let the sect master take action personally?”

Everyone was discussing and pointing at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and couldn’t be bothered with them at all.

No one knew if he would be able to tide over this time. Even Qin Yu wasn’t confident.

He thought of countless possibilities but still couldn’t find a way to escape.

At this moment, elder Bai walked in from outside.

He looked at Qin Yu who was tied up and immediately walked forward quickly.

“Yo, Qin Yu, we meet again,”elder Bai said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu opened his eyes when he heard elder Bai’s voice.

“Elder Bai, do you know why the Young Master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect and Ling Yun died?”Qin Yu asked with a cold smile.

Elder Bai snorted. “That was your doing. How would I know?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “If it wasn’t for you, how would I have a conflict with the Heavenly Cloud Sect? How would it end up like this? How Could Ling Yun and the son of the sect leader die?”

Elder BAI’s expression changed as he hurriedly said, “Don’t spout nonsense!”

After saying that, elder Bai turned around and left, afraid that he would be talking to Qin Yu again.

All the important people of the Heavenly Cloud sect had arrived. The sect master had finally opened his eyes.

He swept his gaze across the crowd and went straight to the point. “Qin Yu has been brought back. How should we deal with him? You guys can tell me.”

“Kill him, of course!”Elder Bai was the first to shout.

His agitated attitude made people turn their heads to look at him.

Elder bai coughed dryly and said, “He caused the death of Ling Yun and young master. He has made our Tianyun sect lose all face. We must kill him!”

“That’s right.”The great elder surprisingly maintained a united front with elder Bai.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “This child must die. We must not let him live.”

“Kill him!”

The others also shouted.

The sect master’s eyes slowly looked at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, did you hear that? Everyone wants you dead,”the sect master said coldly.

Qin Yu snorted lightly and didn’t say a word.

It was useless to say anything now. He had become a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

“Then we’ll do as you say.”After a while, the sect master made the decision.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “In three days, the Heavenly Cloud sect will publicly execute you.”

“Men, take him to the Heavenly Prison!”

“Yes!”

A few people walked forward quickly. They grabbed Qin Yu and walked toward the heavenly prison.

The Sky Cloud Sect’s sky prison was underground. It was said that the sect master had personally set it up.

In this sky prison, everyone’s spiritual power would be restrained. No one could escape.

They arrived at the sky prison. The surroundings were pitch black, and the cold aura went straight to the bone marrow.

They threw Qin Yu into a sky prison, and then the door was tightly locked.

A weak light shone through the extremely narrow window. Other than that, the sun and moon could not be seen.

Qin Yu tried to struggle out of the chains, but she found that she couldn’t. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Master, is that you?”

At this moment, Di Zun’s voice came from not far away.

Qin Yu suddenly opened her eyes and frowned, “Di Zun? Did they really put you in the Heavenly Prison?”

Di zun sighed and said, “Master, I’m useless. I didn’t expect the great elder to be so heartless.”

“Where are Zhen Yue and the others?”Qin Yu asked hurriedly.

Zhen Yue said, “Mr. Qin, I’m here.”

“Are you okay?”

“Yes, I’m fine. They didn’t do anything to me.”

After knowing that everyone was fine, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

“You don’t have to worry. Their purpose of capturing you is all because of me. Now that I’m locked in the Heavenly Prison, I believe it won’t be long before you’re released,”said Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, this matter is my fault. I shouldn’t have been soft-hearted.”

At this moment, another familiar voice sounded.

This voice was none other than sister Lin.

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted as she hurriedly asked, “Sister Lin, why are you here?”

“Sigh, it’s a long story.”Sister Lin sighed slightly.

As she spoke, someone suddenly walked in from outside.

“Although you are related to the Great Elder, you can’t stay for too long. I’ll give you ten minutes at most.”

“Okay, I got it.”

The conversation between the two fell into Qin Yu’s ears.

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and instantly guessed the other party’s identity.

“Boss Zheng, how have you been?”Qin Yu’s voice came slowly from the depths of the sky prison.

Boss Zheng’s body stiffened. For a moment, he did not know how to respond.

A moment later, he said with some lack of confidence, “I said that I would tell the Great Elder. I told you to run far away. You...”

“I admit that I was caught. Why would sister Lin Be Involved? Didn’t you say that you would never involve sister Lin? !”Qin Yu could not help but Roar angrily.

“I should have listened to my brother and killed you, you bastard!”

After being scolded by Qin Yu, boss Zheng also looked very wronged.

He said in a low voice, “The great elder promised me that he wouldn’t do anything to sister Lin...”

Qin Yu opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but in the end, she gave up.

Speaking of which, it was his fault. If it weren’t for his soft heart, he wouldn’t have fallen to such a state.

Boss Zheng walked all the way to sister Lin’s cell door. Before he could say anything, sister Lin said coldly, “You can go. I don’t want to see you.”

“Sister Lin, it was the Great Elder’s guess. I. . . I. . .”Boss Zheng appeared to be quite wronged.

“I won’t blame you. You can go.”Sister Lin waved her hand, appearing to have a headache.

With that, sister Lin turned around directly. No matter how boss Zheng talked, sister Lin didn’t say anything.

Boss Zheng had no choice but to leave resentfully.

At night.

The gate of the Heavenly Prison was opened again.

An extremely slender figure walked to Qin Yu.

This person was none other than the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect.
