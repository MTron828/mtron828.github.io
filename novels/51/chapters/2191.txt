2192 Qin Wuji

Qin Yu looked at the conflicted elderly man but was not anxious.

No matter what, he had to board this warship. If the elderly man disagreed, he could only kill him.

“Uncle Qun, what’s the matter?” At this moment, a young girl appeared on the deck.

The girl was dressed in a light blue dress, and her long hair fell over her shoulders like a breeze. Her face was beautiful, and her skin was fair. A hint of agility and intelligence flickered in her eyes.

Her eyes were like bright stars, clear and sparkling, revealing a pure internal qi. The corners of her mouth curled up slightly with a hint of confidence and a bright smile. It was like a blooming flower, exuding a warmth akin to sunlight.

The girl’s figure was slender and graceful, standing on the deck like an elf. Her internal qi was pure and fresh, exuding a unique life force.

And there’s a young man following her around.

The young man was dressed in a long black robe and had a tall and sturdy figure. He had short black hair that was slightly messy, revealing a trace of unruly and handsome internal qi.

His facial features were sharp, and his eyes were deep, revealing a sharp and cold light.

The elderly man, addressed as Uncle Qun, hurriedly bowed and greeted the young girl. He then told her what had happened.

“Uncle Qun, this cultivator doesn’t seem to have any ill intentions, so why do you feel suspicious?” the young girl said softly. Her voice was like a spring breeze, gentle and moving.

“Moreover, he will probably die here if we don’t give him a ride in this vast and endless starry sky.”

After hearing this, Uncle Qun could only nod and signal Qin Yu to board the ship.

“Wait a moment.”

However, at this moment, the young man beside the young girl shouted.

He looked at the girl and whispered, “Qingyun, you’re too kind. In this vast starry sky, who can guarantee whether he’s good or evil?”

He then deliberately glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Moreover, this person doesn’t look like a good person.”

Qingyun smiled and said, “I don’t think he’s an evildoer. Brother Fengqing, you don’t have to worry so much. Besides, even if he’s really an evildoer, we’re not afraid of him. His cultivation isn’t strong.”

Fengqing knew he could not convince Qingyun, so he looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Where did you come from? Where do you plan to go?”

“I’m from the Holy Region,” Qin Yu said calmly. “I’m planning to go to Earth. I wonder if you’ve heard of these two places.”

“Never heard of it.” Fengqing snorted coldly and continued, “How long have you been wandering in this starry sky?”

“I don’t know the exact time, but it’s been about half a year,” Qin Yu thought for a moment and said.

“About half a year? Bragging! Even a True Saint can only wander in the starry sky for a year at most, not to mention you!” Fengqing shouted.

Qin Yu could not help but frown.

He did not expect even a True Saint to only stay for a year at most.

“I had a secret treasure with me, so I was fortunate enough to have survived,” Qin Yu said casually.

“Nonsense! What secret treasure is it? Tell us, and show us!” Fengqing shouted.

Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

He was gradually losing his patience.

He did not have to go through so much effort if he wanted to obtain this ship. He could just kill them all with a single palm strike.

“Alright, Brother Fengqing. Since we’re outside, we help whenever we can,” Qingyun suddenly said at this moment.

After hearing this, Feng Qing reluctantly agreed.

The killing intent in Qin Yu’s heart also quietly disappeared at this moment.

Qingyun’s kindness had unintentionally saved their lives.

“I can let you come on board, but you better abide by the rules. If I discover you’re up to no good…” Fengqing did not finish his sentence. His palm shook slightly, and a sharp blade filled with coldness appeared in his hand.

Before Qin Yu could speak, Qingyun quickly said, “Alright, hurry up and get on the ship.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. Then, his figure flashed, and he landed on the warship.

His gaze swept across the warship, and he quietly released his divine sense to envelop the entire warship. Everything inside and outside of the warship fell into Qin Yu’s gaze.

The interior of the warship was spacious and filled with a mysterious internal qi.

A bright light illuminated the entire cabin, reflecting the various ancient formations and mysterious runes hanging on the walls.

A spacious cultivation area was in the middle of the cabin. Smooth stone bricks paved the floor, emanating a faint fragrance.

The cultivation area was surrounded by meticulously carved bookshelves and cabinets which displayed various ancient books and cultivation techniques.

The books on the bookshelves were yellowish. They recorded many precious cultivation experiences and historical inheritances.

All kinds of medicinal herbs and pills were displayed in the cabinets. They were colorful and looked like a treasure trove.

There was a small medicinal herb garden on one side of the cabin. It had all kinds of treasures, spiritual herbs, immortal fruits, and precious herbs. The fragrance of the medicinal herb garden assailed his nostrils, making him feel relaxed and happy.

On the other side of the cabin was a sealed storage room. All kinds of treasure chests and containers were neatly placed in the room.

The treasure chests were filled with precious ores, gems, and rare materials, while the containers were filled with pure white refined pills and refining materials.

A massive dazzling star was hanging at the top of the cabin, emitting a dreamy light.

It was a planet model composed of countless mysterious gemstones and spiritual stones, representing the wellspring of energy within the cabin.

The entire cabin was filled with mysterious and dense spiritual energy, making people feel the endless possibilities of cultivation and the existence of miracles.

The cabin was filled with an ancient and solemn atmosphere as if every corner was imbued with the sweat and wisdom of cultivators.

This warship was like a mobile Holy Land of Cultivation, providing various resources and environments for cultivation.

Cultivators could cultivate, refine pills, forge weapons, read ancient books, and explore endless cultivation paths here.

Apart from that, there were meticulously decorated rooms on the warship and wild beasts kept in captivity. In the backyard, there was a display of fine wine.

One could see that this warship was quite luxurious, and the Yun family’s foundation was not bad.

As for Yun Qingyun, her talent and strength were impressive, but it was evident that she grew up in a well-protected environment. Otherwise, she would not lack such caution and vigilance.

“By the way, what’s your name?” Yun Qingyun suddenly asked. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu pondered for a moment and said, “Qin Wuji.”
