Chapter 325: Ye Qing’s Intentions Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Pang Ding swallowed hard. He could clearly feel that the sweat on his face had been turned into steam by this gust of wind from his fist.

“What... What a terrifying punch...” Pang Ding’s body went limp and he nearly fell to the ground.

He had no doubt that if this punch landed on his body, even if he didn’t die, his bones and tendons would be shattered!

“I lost.” At this moment, Qin Yu took the initiative to admit defeat and turned to walk down the stage.

The entire stadium was in an uproar. Why did he suddenly admit defeat?

Most of the audience present didn’t know martial arts, so they didn’t know who won or lost.

The host coughed awkwardly and said, “Since Mr. Qin has already admitted defeat, then this time’s champion will be...”

“Wait!”

Just as the host was about to announce the result, Pang Ding suddenly shouted.

He rushed to the stage, grabbed the microphone, and said coldly, “I lost. Qin Yu, thank you for showing mercy and for your guidance.”

After saying that, Pang Ding turned around and left.

Although Pang Ding didn’t want to admit defeat, it didn’t mean that he couldn’t afford to lose.

He would rather not have such a victory.

Qin Yu looked at Pang Ding’s back as he left and was deep in thought.

“Then... The champion of this year is the Chuzhou region!” The host shouted!

The crowd was in an uproar, and countless people congratulated Commander Long one after another.

Commander Long’s expression didn’t look good. He was even a little afraid that Ye Qing would blame him.

After Qin Yu left the stage, Commander Long broke through the crowd and ran to Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, didn’t I say that we can only get second place?!” Commander Long said angrily.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “I have already admitted defeat, but the host insisted on giving me the championship. What can I do?”

“You...” Commander Long was immediately speechless.

“Sigh, the Jingdu Military District has always been number one, and Pang Ding is Commander Ye’s personal disciple. If you beat him, it’s equivalent to humiliating Commander Ye!” Commander Long said with a worried expression.

Qin Yu didn’t think it was that serious.

He smiled and said, “Since Ye Qing is revered as a War God, how could he be so petty? Commander Long, I think you’re worrying too much.”

Commander Long sighed and said, “I hope so.”

This also allowed Qin Yu to see a problem.

A person like Commander Long had many concerns.

Everyone seemed to be playing various roles. They were polite to their superiors, but stern to their subordinates.

After the competition ended, Commander Long brought Qin Yu along to collect the trophy.

Although the trophy wasn’t made of any precious materials, it represented honor.

No one would have thought that the Chuzhou region would suddenly go from being the last to defeating the Jingdu Military District.

After leaving the Jingdu Military District, everyone planned to go back.

At this moment, Pang Ding jogged over.

“Greetings, Commander Long.” Pang Ding took the lead to salute Commander Long.

Then, Pang Ding looked at Qin Yu and said, “Commander Ye wants to see you.”

“He wants to see me?” This surprised Qin Yu a little.

Pang Ding nodded and said, “Please.”

Qin Yu nodded. He followed behind Pang Ding and came to a car.

Ye Qing didn’t sit in the car. Instead, he stood in front of the car and waited quietly.

“Greetings, Commander Ye.” Qin Yu saluted Ye Qing.

Ye Qing said with some admiration, “Your performance today was really mind-blowing. I wonder who your mentor is?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t have a mentor.”

Ye Qing’s eyes lit up and he asked, “Really?”

“I won’t dare to hide it.” Qin Yu said in a tone that was neither servile nor overbearing.

Ye Qing nodded his head and then said, “I have an idea. I would like to take you in as my disciple. What do you think?”

The faces of the surrounding people immediately turned pale with fright!

Ye Qing actually wanted to take Qin Yu in as his disciple? What powerful background did he have?

Once he became a disciple of Ye Qing, then in the entire country, few people would dare to go against Qin Yu.

Even the Hans have to think twice!

Qin Yu fell into silence and didn’t speak for a long time.

For a time, everyone was waiting for Qin Yu’s answer.

After a moment, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Thank you for your kindness, but I am used to having my freedom. I can’t be your disciple.”

Ye Qing seemed to have already expected this and he nodded his head as he said, “Alright, if you are unwilling, I won’t force you. But, I must warn you of one thing.”

Qin Yu, waiting for Ye Qing to continue, didn’t say a word.

“You’re talented, but if one day, you become an enemy of the country, I won’t hesitate to kill you.” Ye Qing said in a low voice.

Ye Qing’s voice suddenly turned icy cold.

The terrifying pressure made Qin Yu break out in a cold sweat.

“Please rest assured, Commander Ye.” Qin Yu saluted.

Ye Qing didn’t say another word. He nodded and turned to return to the car.

At that moment, Commander Long ran over from not too far away.

He asked tentatively, “Qin Yu, Commander Ye didn’t say anything, did he?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “He wants to take me as his disciple.”

“What?!” Commander Long was instantly overjoyed.

He said excitedly, “Qin Yu, you’re so lucky! Commander Ye’s disciples are all the bigwigs in the Military District! As long as you become Commander Ye’s disciple, your future will be bright!”

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “I refused.”

Commander Long was stunned and said anxiously, “Are you crazy? Why did you refuse such a good opportunity?”

Qin Yu shook his head and didn’t explain.

Everyone had their own aspirations.

If he became Ye Qing’s disciple, there would naturally be benefits, but his future actions would be restricted.

Moreover, Qin Yu didn’t want to join the Military District.

After that, everyone planned to return to Chuzhou.

The news that Ye Qing wanted to take Qin Yu as a disciple spread quickly.

In the Han family, Han Wei was calculating the time.

Since the Han family was on good terms with Yan Sihai, the Han family knew every movement of the Yan family like the back of their hand.

“Qin Yu... how dare he enter the Yan family?! He even played chess with Old Mister Yan!” Han Wei’s expression was ashen!

He couldn’t wait for Old Mister Yan to die! This way, he would have nothing to worry about!

“This old fart can only live for another half a year at most. When you die, I definitely won’t let Yan Ruoxue off!” Han Wei gnashed his teeth, and the pen in his hand was crushed into pieces by him. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this time, the butler walked in warily from outside the door.

“Young Master, there is bad news.” The butler stood at the side and said softly.

Han Wei looked at him coldly. “Speak!”

The butler said in a low voice, “There is news that Ye Qing is interested in taking Qin Yu as a disciple.”
