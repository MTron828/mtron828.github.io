Chapter 909: Chapter 909, the clash erupted 

The abundant power brought about by the ‘Dou’formula instantly pulled the Dying Qin Yu Back!

His eyes erupted with a brilliant light, and the internal Qi from his body surged to the extreme! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Boom!”

A Ray of golden light shot out from the Black Fog, splitting the black ball into two!

The soaring light was incomparably dazzling, and all the black fog disappeared in an instant!

Qin Yu walked out of the black ball, and the wounds on his body were healing bit by bit!

Puff

The surrounding Black Qi slowly disappeared, and he teng’s figure appeared in front of everyone again!

He spat out a mouthful of blood, and his internal Qi became somewhat chaotic.

“What kind of spell is this? !”He Teng looked at Qin Yu, and his eyes were full of shock.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Nine secrets, fighting formula!”

“Nine secrets!”The hoarse voice from He Teng’s body came out, and there was shock in his voice!

He Teng’s face was also extremely ugly. He wiped the corner of his mouth and said coldly, “The nine secrets of Taoism... indeed lives up to its reputation...”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Stop talking nonsense, I will kill you right now!”

After saying that, Qin Yu stepped on the ground and shrunk into an inch, charging towards he teng!

However, at this moment, he teng wanted to temporarily dodge the attack. He turned into a black fog and hurriedly retreated!

“Retreat. The nine secrets is the most mysterious spell in Taoism. You Can’t beat him.”That hoarse voice sounded in he Teng’s mind.

A trace of unwillingness flashed across He Teng’s face. He gritted his teeth and cursed, “Damn it... just a little bit, just a little bit!”

“There are plenty of opportunities... Let’s retreat.”

He Teng had no choice. His body turned into a cloud of black fog and dispersed in all directions.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He hurriedly cast a spatial spell to seal off the surroundings.

Unfortunately, the spatial spell that Qin Yu cast was merely a few spatial barriers. It was too far from the martial saint’s internal Qi. It could not stop the flow of Qi at all.

In the blink of an eye, the black fog had disappeared in front of the two of them.

“We let him escape again.”Qin Yu could not help but feel a little angry!

This was already the third time he had escaped from his hands!

“If that’s the case, I’m afraid your position will be exposed,”Jiang he reminded from the side.

Qin Yu nodded. He quickly looked at Jiang he and said, “Senior Jiang He, hurry up and teach me the line formula. We don’t have much time.”

Jiang he did not waste any time. He sat cross-legged on the ground and began to teach Qin Yu the last secret of the nine secrets, the line formula.

On the other side.

He Teng sped toward the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

On the way, he teng took out his phone and dialed Gu Xinghe’s number.

After the call was connected, Gu Xinghe said with some amusement, “How was it? Did you catch Jiang he?”

“No.”He Teng did not hide anything.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Didn’t you boast? Why, is this the result you gave me?”

He teng sneered, “It’s true that I didn’t catch Jiang he, but I have more important news to tell you.”

“Oh?”Gu Xinghe raised an eyebrow.

He Teng said coldly, “I met Qin Yu. He is at Jiang he’s residence.”

“What! ?”Gu Xinghe was shocked!

He teng continued, “I fought with him. If it wasn’t for Jiang he, I would have caught him!”

“Also, Qin Yu’s residence wasn’t a short while, because Qin Yu learned Jiang he’s nine secrets.”

“As for why Master Zhai Xing didn’t meet him, I’m not sure.”

After saying this, he teng hung up the phone.

Gu Xinghe’s expression was somewhat cold.

If what he Teng said was true, then it was enough to prove that Zhai Xing had really let Qin Yu and Jiang he go on purpose.

Thinking of this, Gu Xinghe’s expression became even colder.

“Go, Call Zhai Xing over,”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Not long after, Zhai Xing brought the two martial saints to Gu Xinghe’s office.

“Young master Gu.”Zhai Xing bowed slightly.

Gu Xinghe looked at Zhai Xing coldly and said, “Uncle Zhai Xing, I understand your intention to let Jiang he off, but why did you let Qin Yu Off?”

Zhai Xing’s expression changed slightly. He frowned and said, “I didn’t. I didn’t meet Qin Yu at all.”

Gu Xinghe snorted coldly and said, “Then why did Gu Xinghe say that Qin Yu was at Jiang He’s residence? How are you going to explain it to me?”

“He’s lying,”Zhai Xing said expressionlessly.

Gu Xinghe was angry and anxious, but there was nothing he could do to Zhai Xing.

“Alright, I believe you.”Gu Xinghe stood up.

“Come with me now and find Jiang He!”

“This time, I want to see you kill him with your own hands!”

...

On the other side.

Jiang he was teaching Qin Yu the Xing character Mantra.

However, both of them were not in a good state of mind, so Qin Yu’s speed of comprehending the ‘xing’character formula was much slower.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu and Jiang he opened their eyes at the same time.

“No,”Jiang he shook his head and said.

“Both of us are in a state of anxiety, so we can’t comprehend it at all.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I’ve also realized it.”

At this point, Qin Yu stood up and said, “Senior Jiang he, let’s go somewhere else.”

“Go somewhere else? Where to?”Jiang he asked in confusion.

“A secret realm.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“I’ve found a secret realm. I’ve been hiding in that secret realm all this time.”

“Also... the Qi/spiritual energy in that secret realm is beyond imagination! Senior Jiang he, with your talent, you can enter the martial saint realm in that secret realm!”

Jiang he’s state of mind could be said to be extremely strong. Not many people in this world could be compared to him!

What he lacked was just enough resources! This was also the reason why the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was afraid of him!

“Is what you said true?”Jiang he asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s absolutely true.”

Jiang he stroked his beard and said, “Indeed, I should step into the martial saint realm as soon as possible. Sooner or later, conflicts will erupt between the current world and the secret realm. Without the martial saint, the martial artists in this world will slowly lose the right to speak.”

“Senior Jiang he, let’s hurry up and leave. Don’t waste any more time.”Qin Yu urged.

Jiang he did not say anything more. He immediately followed behind Qin Yu and left this place.

Just as Jiang he had guessed, the conflicts between the martial artists of this world and the martial artists in the Mystic Realm were increasing.

And the number of disciples that came out from the various mystic realms was also increasing.

Right at this place, in the martial arts academy in Jingdu.

Zhuang Teng and Chu Heng had a conflict with the three disciples from the secret realms.

“Why should I give up my house to You?”Zhuang Teng looked coldly at the youth in front of him.

The youth sneered, “Because I like it. Isn’t this reason enough?”

“You’re courting death!”As a young master of Jingdu, he had never suffered this kind of anger!

A great battle immediately broke out between the two sides, but several disciples from the secret realms rushed forward and severely injured Zhuang Teng and Chu Heng!

This matter quickly spread, and everyone from the martial arts academy came when they heard the news.

The many young masters of Jingdu and the disciples from the secret realm formed a confrontation between two factions.

The two sides looked at each other, and a great battle was about to break out.
