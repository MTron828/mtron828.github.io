Chapter 1657: Chapter 1,657, taboo spells of elementalists! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

His long hair was as black as ink, and his body was covered by a black aura. Even though it was just an image, it still made people feel like he was the ruler of the world!

The aura that he emitted caused everyone to feel a chill in their internal Qi!

At this moment, countless people could not help but kneel down, as if they were worshipping a god!

Even Qin Yu felt an extreme sense of oppression!

Just what kind of character was this! They were both using the four symbols technique, but why was it so different!

Did all the divine beasts in that scene die in his hands! !

A trace of solemnity appeared on Xiao Sheng’s face.

Even he felt that this scene was extraordinary.

Terrifying, too terrifying!

Qin Yu coldly looked at that figure. Although that oppressive feeling was extremely uncomfortable, Qin Yu’s face still didn’t show the slightest bit of fear!

“It must be the immortal slaying sect’s secret technique,”Qin Yu said coldly.

At this moment, Heavenly Blood Rainbow, who was in the spatial magic artifact, suddenly said with a trembling voice, “No, this... This is someone from the immortal slaying sect. He’s an important figure of the immortal slaying sect!”

“A member of the immortal slaying sect?”Qin Yu was stunned.

Even though he had an indomitable belief, he still felt shocked!

The immortal slaying sect was a legendary sect. The person in this scene was actually a person that spanned through the ages? !

“What kind of secret technique is this? He actually summoned such an existence...”heavenly blood rainbow seemed to be trembling. It was terrifying to the extreme!

“Qin Yu, run. Even a strand of his internal Qi can crush you into dust. Run!”Heavenly Blood Rainbow hurriedly shouted.

Qin Yu knew that this figure wasn’t ordinary, but he still didn’t have the slightest intention of leaving.

On the contrary, the battle intent on his body grew stronger and stronger, and even his blood began to boil!

This was a terrifying battle intent, an invincible belief!

Even when facing a figure that spanned across the ages, Qin Yu was not afraid at all!

“Let’s Fight!”

Qin Yu let out an angry roar, and golden internal Qi gushed out once again!

He clenched his Golden Fist and rushed towards the elementalist at high speed!

The elementalist’s expression was extremely cold. At this moment, he no longer looked like the main character. Instead, it was that mysterious man who dominated this world!

Qin Yu’s Golden Fist rushed straight towards him, and at this moment, a Great Dao appeared!

The elementalist did not even blink his eyes. He only stared coldly at Qin Yu.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the mysterious man made his move!

He raised his palm and looked down from above, suppressing his opponent!

It was as though a casual move of his was pulling the Great Dao. It was extremely terrifying!

“Boom!”

The Moment Qin Yu’s fist touched the ground, he was sent flying and his entire body sank into the ground!

Hiss!

Everyone gasped!

Just raising his palm casually was already so terrifying? ! Who exactly was this person? !

Even Xiao Sheng’s face revealed a trace of seriousness.

No matter what kind of spell this elementalist used, he was indeed a legendary top-notch person that spanned across the ages!

Under this palm strike, cracks appeared on Qin Yu’s body!

His body, which was almost invincible just a moment ago, now appeared extremely weak!

Qin Yu crawled up from the ground. The injuries on his body were slowly healing.

It had to be said that this palm strike had indeed broken through Qin Yu’s physical defense, but it did not cause any substantial damage.

“It’s useless, Qin Yu. This is no longer a fight or no fight. This is no longer a fight between the two of you. Run!”Heavenly Blood Rainbow roared crazily!

However, how could Qin Yu be the one running away? He stared coldly at the figure and said coldly, “This isn’t a real person’s awakening. It’s just a spell. What do I have to fear? !”

After saying that, Qin Yu stepped on the line word formula and charged at the elementalist again!

“You don’t know whether you’re Dead or alive.”The elementalist sneered. The figure in the scene also quickly attacked and suppressed the elementalist again!

His movements looked extremely slow, but his power could be said to be endless! The entire sky was directly trampled into pieces, and the sound of explosions could be heard endlessly!

The Great Dao was rumbling. He was like an immortal, looking down on all living things from above!

“Pa!”

It was as if countless vines had struck Qin Yu’s body, sending him flying for the second time!

This time, the situation was even more serious. Streaks of blood appeared on Qin Yu’s body, and fresh blood gushed out like a fountain!

These were not ordinary wounds. Even if Qin Yu used the meridian circulation technique, he would not be able to heal them in a short period of time!

This was evident from the immortal slaying sect’s methods!

“Xiao Sheng, this technique was originally used to deal with you. I didn’t expect it to come in handy.”The Elementalist’s eyes shot towards Xiao Sheng’s direction.

“But it doesn’t matter. Even if you know about it, there’s nothing you can do about it. This technique has already exceeded the limits of our understanding. It’s a true supreme secret technique!”The elementalist raised his head and laughed loudly!

At this moment, everyone felt despair!

Qin Yu, who was brave and invincible just a moment ago, appeared to be extremely weak under this technique!

Countless people turned their gazes towards Xiao Sheng.

They seemed to be waiting for Xiao Sheng to make a move. But unfortunately, Xiao Sheng did not show any signs of doing so!

“Qin Yu is no match for the elementalist. Who else can beat him!”

“If Qin Yu loses today, it means that our southern region has lost. It means that all of us have lost!”

“Hahahahahaha!”The elementalist laughed out loud. He was extremely arrogant!

Qin Yu’s body was already covered in blood. Even Qin Yu’s physical body was unable to resist the secret technique that was unleashed!

“Hahahahaha!”The elementalist looked at Qin Yu coldly and said condescendingly, “Qin Yu, you are still a junior. Do you think you can resist a God?”

After saying that, the mysterious person in the scene struck again. His huge palm was like a dark cloud that blotted out the sky as it struck ruthlessly at Qin Yu!

“Bang!”

The ground was completely reduced to ruins. Smoke and dust rose up and covered the entire area!

Everyone clenched their fists. Their Hearts were hanging in the air, and their faces were extremely nervous.

The power of this palm was too strong. It almost caused the entire ground to collapse! No one knew if Qin Yu could hold on or not!

Countless pairs of eyes stared in Qin Yu’s direction. As the dust slowly dispersed, Qin Yu staggered to his feet.

His body was covered in bloody scars, but the golden radiance was like the rising sun of hope. It did not diminish in the slightest!

Qin Yu stood up, but even if he stood up, it was useless! If he could not find a way to counterattack, the final outcome would still be defeat! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“You will definitely lose!”The elementalist said coldly.

Qin Yu, who was standing in the middle of the arena, remained silent.

He lowered his head. His long hair covered his face. No one knew what kind of expression he had at this moment.

“Ha... hehe... Hahaha, hahahahahaha!”

Just when everyone thought that he was going to give up, his hair was scattered, and he raised his head and laughed!
