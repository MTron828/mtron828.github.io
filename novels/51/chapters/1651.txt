Chapter 1652: Chapter 1,652, return to void Pill 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At the foot of the Cultivation Mountain.

The deputy sect master kept shouting at the cultivation mountain, but there was not the slightest movement inside.

After a long while, the deputy sect master gradually gave up.

He cleared his somewhat hoarse throat and then said mockingly, “Sect master, Qin Yu just beheaded a godly king. Furthermore, he will be fighting elementalists on Mount Yingning three days later.”

“TSK TSK, look at him, and then look at you. He dares to challenge the Lord of the northern lands, unlike you, who hides on a mountain every day and never leaves the main gate. TSK TSK.”

After a round of sarcasm, the deputy sect master turned around and was about to leave.

But at this moment, a path lit up on the cultivation mountain.

The deputy sect master was stunned. Before he could recover from his shock, the sect master had already walked over.

In the blink of an eye, he had arrived in front of the deputy sect master.

This made the deputy sect master extremely nervous. He swallowed his saliva and braced himself to say, “What... What are you doing? Don’t tell me you’re going to kill me? Since you don’t dare to attack the people of the northern lands, are you going to vent your anger on your own people?”

A faint smile hung on the sect master’s face.

It was very obvious that he did not take the deputy sect master’s words to heart.

“Three days later, Ying Ning Mountain?”The sect master inquired.

The deputy sect master nodded and said, “That’s right. Why? Do you want to go too?”

The sect master placed his hands behind his back and said with a sigh, “Let’s go and take a look. I have nothing to do anyway.”

When the deputy sect master heard that, he was immediately overjoyed!

He hurriedly said, “Alright, then I’ll make the arrangements! When the time comes, I’ll go with you!”

The news of Qin Yu beheading a godly monarch of the northern lands spread like wildfire throughout the entire southern province.

For a moment, almost everyone was discussing this matter.

They had been sullen for too long. Faced with the powerful northern lands, they had practically no means of resisting.

Now that someone had stepped forward and beheaded a godly monarch, it was undoubtedly a shot in the arm.

However, Qin Yu was the only one who was filled with worry.

He came to wind bamboo mountain and sat where Qu Zhu used to be.

Qu Zhu’s wine flask and a flute were also placed here.

Qin Yu reached out to caress his wine flask and said with a sigh, “Three maniacs, three ultimate, did he really die just like that?”

Facing the powerful Northern Land Lord, qu Zhu’s chances of victory were indeed very small.

However, existences like them would definitely have their own means of self-protection.

“If you really die, I will set up a tombstone for you,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

After saying this, he took out the painting from the spatial magic artifact.

Looking at the painting in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel somewhat vexed.

“Unfortunately, I was unable to get anything out of that godly king’s mouth,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

He had tried many methods, but he was unable to get anything out of the painting.

It was likely that the scroll had used some sort of sealing technique.

After putting away the scroll, Qin Yu stood up and left wind bamboo mountain.

Qin Yu wasn’t confident in facing the powerful lord of the northern lands. He had to be fully prepared.

Thus, Qin Yu stood up and rushed towards the hunter organization.

He wanted to take the iron rod away in case he needed it.

In front of Xiao Hai’s grave.

Xiao Sheng stood there and poured a pot of wine in front of Xiao Hai’s grave.

“Qin Yu killed a godly king. He is about to face the Lord of the northern lands,”Xiao Sheng said indifferently.

“It seems that there is still someone willing to inherit your will.”

Xiao Sheng could not help but sigh. Although his path was different from Xiao Hai’s, he was still filled with admiration for Xiao Hai’s dedication.

“It was the right decision not to kill him back then.”Xiao Sheng’s brows turned cold, and then slowly relaxed.

“Speaking of which, in my heart, the one who wants to fight the most is not the northern land’s master.”

Xiao Sheng did not continue with the rest of his words, but his meaning was very clear.

He sat in front of the grave for a long time and did not have any intention of leaving.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng sensed an aura approaching from the dark. It was an internal Qi.

“Eh?”

Xiao Sheng frowned slightly. His body flashed and he immediately hid.

A moment later, a man whose face was covered hurried to the tombstone.

This person’s face was covered by the fog, and no one could see through it.

A faint black energy lingered around his body.

This aura was completely different from the black energy of the northern lands. It was like the internal Qi of death.

Xiao Sheng hid in the dark and did not make a sound. He just looked at him quietly as if he wanted to see what he was going to do. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, the mysterious person stood in front of the grave for a long time. He did not say a word and just stood there quietly.

A moment later, the mysterious person turned around and left.

Xiao Sheng, who was hiding in the dark, frowned slightly. He immediately stood up and planned to chase after him.

However, in a short moment, that mysterious person had already disappeared without a trace.

This kind of movement technique could not help but make Xiao Sheng feel a little surprised.

“He actually escaped under my eyes...”Xiao Sheng muttered in a low voice.

In the entire South Province, there were very few people who could achieve such a level.

Xiao Sheng looked at his departing figure, and no one knew what he was thinking about.

...

Green Rock Forest, Hunter organization.

Because this place was close to Green Rock Forest, the disaster in the South Province didn’t have much impact on them.

Seeing Qin Yu rush back, Jing Bai quickly walked up to him.

“Qin Yu, Why Are You Back?”Jing Bai said in surprise.

A hunter beside him smiled and said, “Qin Yu, did you bring back the white bone staff for us?”

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said, “I’ve disappointed all of you. I’m afraid we won’t be able to get the white bone staff back anytime soon.”

“Haha, We Were Just Joking. You Can’t be blamed for this matter.”The hunter at the side patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and laughed heartily.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying, “In three days’time, I will be fighting with the elementalists at Ying Ning Mountain. So... I’m afraid I’ll have to take the iron staff with me for now.”

“Battle with the Northern Lord?”Everyone could not help but feel a little surprised when they heard this.

Many hunters surrounded them one after another.

“Qin Yu, the northern Lord is far more powerful than the three maniacs and three uniques.”

“That’s right. Even the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is hiding. You...”

“Nine holes died at his hands. Why do you have to fight with him?”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Of course I know that elementalists are very strong, but someone has to face him.”

“If everyone wants to protect themselves, then the destruction of the southern region is inevitable. Xiao Hai’s death is meaningless.”

Jing Bai said in a deep voice, “I support your idea. You... be careful.”

Qin Yu smiled and patted his shoulder without saying anything.

Then, he went to the array eye and took out the iron rod.

“I hope you can help...”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

After taking the iron rod, Qin Yu planned to leave the hunter organization.

At this moment, the Pekingese suddenly appeared behind Qin Yu.

In his hand was a pill.

The fragrance of this pill was extremely rich and emitted a magical glow.

“What is this?”Qin Yu asked suspiciously.

Jing Bai said in a deep voice, “This is the pill left behind by the group leader.”

“Pill? What Pill?”

“Void return pill.”
