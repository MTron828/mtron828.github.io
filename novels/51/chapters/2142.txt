2143 Straight to Astral Mountain

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes were filled with worry when she saw Qin Yu return. She knew that the price Qin Yu paid this time was not small when he forcefully activated the seventh or even eighth level of the fighting word formula. This made her even more worried.

“Are you alright?” Yan Ruoxue asked nervously.

“I’m fine.” Qin Yu forcefully supported his body, but his face was fatigued. He smiled, and a hint of stubbornness flashed in his eyes.” There is still unfinished business. How can I fall so easily?”

Gratitude and worry filled Yan Ruoxue’s eyes, looking at him. She knew very well that Qin Yu’s inner body had probably suffered severe injuries.

“Hurry up and leave…” Qin Yu waved his hand. His tension began to dissipate, and his internal qi rapidly disappeared.

Shortly, Qin Yu collapsed onto the ground, looking much more tired.

Yan Ruoxue wanted to transmit her internal qi to Qin Yu, but Qin Yu interrupted her.

“Hurry up and leave… Otherwise, the Yan family will catch up, and we can’t escape…” Qin Yu said with difficulty.

Yan Ruoxue gritted her teeth. She could only get up and started the ancient ship, shooting toward Astral Mountain.

The ancient ship was like a shooting star, drawing a brilliant trajectory in the starry sky, speeding toward the direction of Astral Mountain. Although Yan Ruoxue was deeply worried about Qin Yu’s injuries, the current situation did not allow her to get distracted. She could only focus on navigating the ancient ship to ensure they could escape from this dangerous area as soon as possible.

On the deck of the ancient ship, Qin Yu was lying weakly on it. His face was pale, and his eyes were closed. His internal qi was like a candlelight in the wind, flickering.

The forceful activation of the two techniques undoubtedly caused immense damage to him.

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to be on the verge of collapse. However, he still gritted his teeth and did not utter a sound. He knew that he could not fall so easily. If he fell, Yan Ruoxue would worry about him, and her attention would be distracted. This was undoubtedly fatal to them.

Qin Yu took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and slowly adjusted his internal qi.

On the other end, where the Path of Heaven descended.

The place was still incomparably lively. Everyone congratulated Teng Zixu, and the aristocratic families were no exception. They even offered treasures and were willing to befriend him.

The chosen one by heaven meant Teng Zixu would smoothly enter the Tribulation Stage. It was a great temptation for anyone!

Although there was no shortage of geniuses in the Golden Age, it was precisely due to this that geniuses were easier to die.

No matter how monstrous they were, they were not worth mentioning before they grew up and developed. Even if they had a profound background, they very likely would disappear without a trace under this great sandstorm.

Teng Zixu was quite humble in the face of everyone’s flattery. He thanked them one by one and then toasted with them.

“Since the day of the Path of Heaven has ended, it’s time to settle some scores.” At this moment, Si Liuhe’s body burst out with a battle intent heading straight for the demon race.

After Si Liuhe’s shout, many True Saints of the human race stood up.

Full of battle intent and Holy Might, they were ready to attack at any moment!

The demon race had solemn expressions seeing this scene. They knew this was the time when the human race was riding a wave of popularity and exuding unwavering confidence. Furthermore, under the illumination of the chosen one, Teng Zixu, the morale of the human race was also greatly boosted

At this moment, the human race no longer feared the demon race. Instead, they were determined to fight the demon race to gain status and rights for the human race.

For a moment, the atmosphere where the Path of Heaven descended suddenly became tense. Many people could feel a great battle seem to break out at any time.

Xiao Sheng was the first to stand up. His body was bursting with terrifying battle intent. He was not afraid at all. The terrifying battle intent was heading straight to the Si family and Si Liuhe!

Xiao Sheng’s arrogance made Si Liuhe feel dissatisfied. He understood Xiao Hai, and so he did not want to waste his breath on Xiao Sheng.

His figure flashed and appeared in front of Xiao Sheng.

Xiao Sheng was tall and slender. He was not at a disadvantage even when compared to the demon race’s Immortal Crane. Therefore, he was more imposing than Si Liuhe.

However, Si Liuhe still assumed a condescending posture and looked down at Xiao Sheng coldly.

“You want to attack me, do you?” Si Liuhe said coldly.

The dao technique on Xiao Sheng surged as he said coldly, “I’ll attack the entire Si family.”

“Then I’ll use you as a sacrifice to raise my banner!” Si Liuhe shouted. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I’m afraid it’s inappropriate for a Supreme Elder of the Si family to attack a junior.” At this moment, the turtle-shaped elderly man stood out.

His body was tremendously hunched, but his internal qi was terrifyingly powerful!

Standing in front of Xiao Sheng, his small body contained a terrifying aura.

Si Liuhe sneered and said, “It is said that the depths of Azure Rock Forest are incredibly mysterious. Since you came out of Azure Rock Forest, you must be quite powerful. I, Si Liuhe, would like o see it for myself.”

“I’m also quite interested in the chosen one like you,” the turtle-shaped elderly man said indifferently.

At this moment, Yan Tianshi suddenly stepped forward.

He stood in front of Si Liuhe and said, “Brother Liuhe, we seem to have more important things to do.”

After Yan Tianshi’s reminder, Si Liuhe and the Si family members came to their senses.

“Today is the big day for my Si family and the Yan family. After the engagement is over, we will come and deal with you,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

He was not afraid the demons would leave because many True Saints of the human race had already walked over and stared at the demon race like tigers eyeing their prey.

Soon, Si Shiyue walked over. He looked dignified, like a rare genius in the world.

“Ruoxue, come over,” Yan Tianshi called out.

However, the scene was rather quiet. There was no sign of Yan Ruoxue at all.

Yan Tianshi frowned slightly and shouted again, “Ruoxue, it’s time.”

However, the scene was still in silence. After a while, the crowd began to discuss among themselves softly.

Yan Tianshi and Si Liuhe frowned almost at the same time. They seemed to realize something was wrong.

Si Liuhe was the first to react. His divine sense covered the majority of the mountain, but he could not find Yan Ruoxue!

“Holy Lord Yan, Saintess Yan seemed she didn’t come at all, “Si Liuhe narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

“Impossible!” Yan Tianshi frowned. With a wave of his hand, he directly brought Uncle Yan to him and said coldly, “Where is Ruoxue?”
