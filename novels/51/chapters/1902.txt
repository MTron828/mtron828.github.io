1903 The Legend of the Cold Moon Palace

The scenery of the Cold Moon Palace was especially beautiful at night. The celestial aura was also more abundant.

In the distance, a quiet river was flowing slowly, and its sound resembled beautiful music.

Qin Yu walked up to the bridge. In the dark, he could vaguely see a rather beautiful figure by the railing of the bridge.

“Mr. Qin is still not asleep?”

!!

Before Qin Yu could speak, Saintess Gu asked.

“Saintess Gu?” Qin Yu asked in surprise. “Why are you here so late at night?”

“Just like you. It’s hard for me to fall asleep,” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

Qin Yu walked to her side.

Both of them looked like the spirits in the night, looking a little lonely.

“Saintess Gu, I have a few questions to ask you. Please forgive me if you’re offended,” Qin Yu said as he bowed.

“Let’s chat while we walk,” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

“Alright.” Qin Yu agreed.

Thus, led by Saintess Gu, the two walked toward the massive Osmanthus tree.

Their pace wasn’t fast. It was even a little slow.

Qin Yu looked at the Osmanthus tree in the distance and said, “Saintess Gu, how old is that Osmanthus tree?”

Saint Gu didn’t seem surprised by Qin Yu’s question. Everyone who came to the Cold Moon Palace seemed interested in the tree.

“It was left behind by my ancestral granny. It has been around for more than 5,000 years. It has witnessed the rise and fall of a generation,” Saintess Gu said.

“Pardon me for asking. Is the name of the Gu family’s granny Chang’e?” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

“No,” Saintess Gu shook her head and said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

It seemed that all of this was just a coincidence.

“However, Granny’s name carried the words “Chang’e”. Back then, some people called her Enchanted Fairy too.”

The last sentence of Saintess Gu made Qin Yu’s eyes widen!

“This is definitely not a coincidence!” Qin Yu said in shock.

“What’s wrong? Why is Mr. Qin asking about this?” Saintess Gu asked.

Qin Yu ignored what Saintess Gu said but continued, “Saintess Gu, who is the father of your granny?”

Saintess Gu’s expression became unnatural at the mention of this.

“Ignore me if it’s not convenient to tell.” Seeing her expression, Qin Yu waved his hand.

“It’s not really inconvenient,” Saintess Gu smiled and said. It’s just a little strange to mention the name of the ancient emperor in the Cold Moon Palace.

Ancient emperor?

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

The father of Enchanted Fairy was probably the source of the Gu family’s bloodline!

“Mr. Qin, why are you so interested in the past of my Gu family?” Saintess Gu said in surprise.

Qin Yu shook his head, smiled, and said, “This is the first time I entered the nine great aristocratic families. I’m naturally curious about your past.”

Saintess Gu didn’t doubt anything. She just chuckled and said, “We’re just the lucky ones who were blessed by our ancestors.”

Qin Yu didn’t dare to ask any more questions. There were too many legends about the Immortal Emperor, and their existence was tremendously mysterious. Even though they had died long ago, people were still afraid.

“Mr. Qin, I also have a few questions to ask you,” Saintess Gu suddenly said.

Qin Yu bowed slightly, indicating Saintess Gu to continue.

“Why do you want to enter the Yan family?” Saintess Gu smiled and asked.

Qin Yu’s body became stiff slightly, and he said with an unnatural expression, “I’m… I’m also curious about the Yan family.”

“Just out of curiosity?” Saintess Gu raised her brows. Her beautiful eyes filled with an indescribable hue. People were afraid to look at her directly for fear that they would be seen through.

“Yeah, I’m just curious,” Qin Yu said with his head lowered.

“Really? It’s not because of the bloodline of the saintess of the Yan family?” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu’s heart was suddenly in turmoil!

Even though he tried his best to restrain himself, his expression was still somewhat unnatural!

“Of course not.” Qin Yu took a deep breath and tried to keep calm.

Saintess Gu smiled without saying anything. She looked at the Osmanthus tree in the distance and said, “Rumor has it that the Yan family’s bloodline is a perfect match made in heaven with the chaotic body. Once they dual cultivate, the effects are beyond imagination. I thought Mr. Qin was aiming at the bloodline.”

Qin Yu was stunned secretly.

He didn’t expect Saintess Gu to know about Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline. It seemed like this matter was no longer a secret in the Holy Region.

“Of course not. I’m not qualified to get close to the Yan family’s saintess,” Qin Yu could only lie.

Saintess Gu looked at Qin Yu and said with a smile, “You might not be doing this for Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline, but will the Yan family believe you? Would Si Shiyue believe it? If you step into the Yan family, what’s the difference from a lamb in a tiger’s den?”

After being reminded by Sanintess Gu, Qin Yu suddenly understood.

He frowned and looked at Saintess Gu, saying, “‘Saintess Gu is right… Then what should I do?”

“Must you go?” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

...

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Alright,” Saint Gu said with a smile. “You can use a secret technique to hide your internal qi so that others won’t be able to detect your physique.”

“Secret technique…” Qin Yu murmured.

“Saintess Gu, do you have such a secret technique?” Qin Yu tried to ask.

“The Gu family doesn’t need such a secret technique to hide our internal qi,” Saintess Gu shook her head.

This caused Qin Yu trouble.

It seemed that he could only go back and search his memory.

“But… This secret technique is not rare. If you want it, it shouldn’t be too difficult,” Saintess Gu said.

“Zhongzhou is so big. There’s nothing that you can’t find.”

Qin Yu agreed after thinking.

There were some secret techniques that could conceal one’s internal qi. But Qin Yu would not simply look for a secret technique and comprehend it.

...

After all, it was the Yan family. If he were seen through, he would be in big trouble.

“Of course, I suggest that you cover your face as well so that no one can recognize you,” Saintess Gu continued.

“Thank you for your reminder, Saintess Gu,” Qin Yu nodded and said with a smile.

It was not difficult to change one’s appearance. Back then, when he was still on Erath, Fang Yue had been able to do it, let alone in the Holy Region.

While they were talking, the two of them arrived under the Osmanthus tree.

Standing under the tree, Qin Yu felt an incredibly strange feeling. It was as if he could feel the vicissitudes and past of the tree by merely standing there.

Looking over, not far away from the Osmanthus tree, many trees and flowers were flickering.

These trees and flowers were all extraordinary, shining with mysterious hues in the darkness.

Saintees Gu waved her hand and tapped lightly toward the direction in front of her. A ray of light landed on an empty space.

“I’ll place the seed of the Bodhi ancient tree there. What do you think? ” Saintess Gu smiled and asked.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
