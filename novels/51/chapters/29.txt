After he started refining his cultivation methods, Qin Yu’s sense of hearing had improved tremendously.

Although the two men outside his room spoke in a low voice, Qin Yu could hear them clearly.

Uncle Wu’s subordinate looked at Uncle Wu expectantly. He seemed to be waiting for his answer.

Uncle Wu looked in the direction of Qin Yu’s room and did not say a word.

After a long time, Uncle Wu waved his hand and said, “Let’s return to Chuzhou.”

After this incident, Uncle Wu’s impression of Qin Yu had changed.

But he also had his suspicions.

”Mr. Wu, you can’t just let this slide. How about I secretly help Shen Tian?” Uncle Wu’s subordinate suggested.

Uncle Wu remained quiet for a moment before waving his hand.

”From now on, I won’t interfere in what happens between Qin Yu and Shen Tian,” Uncle Wu said with a sigh.

”But Mr. Wu...”

”Say no more.” Uncle Wu waved his hand and cut him off.

...

When Uncle Wu departed, Qin Yu began formulating his plan.

Right now, the most important thing was to earn money because he could not be dependent on Yan Ruoxue for everything.

As he sat in the room, he began to concoct the Soul Nourishment Pill.

Although it was easy to make this kind of pill, it had tremendous benefits for the human body.

Nowadays, many people’s health are deteriorated by alcohol and sex. Although they may seem physically fit, they were actually unhealthy inside.

The Soul Nourishment Pill was the perfect remedy for the body.

It took Qin Yu the entire day to make the pill.

Aside from the Soul Nourishment Pill, Qin Yu also concocted a special Aqua Rhyme Pill for Yan Ruoxue.

This Aqua Rhyme Pill alone took Qin Yu three hours to make.

The herbs used to make the Aqua Rhyme Pill were carefully selected by Qin Yu, who chose the best ones from the batch of herbs he had.

”I’ve never given a gift to Miss Yan, so this will be my small token of appreciation,” Qin Yu thought.

He headed to the dollar store and bought a wooden box to put the Aqua Rhyme Pill in.

Afterwards, Qin Yu grabbed the Aqua Rhyme Pill and rushed towards the Yan family’s manor.

When he arrived at Yan Ruoxue’s house, Yan Ruoxue was on the phone.

When she saw Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue hung up immediately and said with surprise, “Qin Yu, what are you doing here?”

Qin Yu grinned wryly and said, “I’m here to apologize.”

”Apologize? Apologize for what?” Astonishment was visible in Yan Ruoxue’s beautiful eyes.

Qin Yu replied sheepishly, “I shouldn’t have ignored your request this morning...”

When she heard this, Yan Ruoxue let out a snort of laughter.

She rolled her eyes and said, “Idiot, why would I blame you for that? Instead, if you didn’t stand up for yourself, then I really would have despised you.”

”Really?” Qin Yu said in astonishment. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

”Absolutely,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

”Qin Yu, I much prefer it when you act like yourself instead of putting up with others because you are too concerned about what they think.” Yan Ruoxue said earnestly.

Qin Yu became increasingly smitten with Yan Ruoxue.

He did not know if it was because of his social class, but Qin Yu had never met a girl like Yan Ruoxue before.

”Alright!” Qin Yu nodded eagerly.

Just as he was about to take out his Aqua Rhyme Pill, the sudden rumbling of an engine caught his attention.

When he glanced over his shoulder, he saw a Lamborghini sports car parked outside.

A tall young man with bleached hair stepped out of the car.

The young man was 6 feet tall with a muscular body. He wore a crisp, clean suit that made him look like a handsome man straight out of a TV show.

In comparison, Qin Yu seemed a little dwarfed.

This young man was none other than Shen Tian from Chuzhou.

Shen Tian walked into the house and quickly made his way to Yan Ruoxue.

”Miss Yan, why didn’t you tell me you were in Chuzhou?” Shen Tian said with a passionate look on his face.

”Why would I tell you?” Yan Ruoxue, however, did not show any interest in him.

Her response made Shen Tian feel awkward.

He let out a cough before saying, “I heard that you’ve been getting close to a young man named Qin Yu recently. To be honest, I’m curious as to what kind of a man he is for him to catch Miss Yan’s eye.”

”I am Qin Yu.” Qin Yu stepped forward.

Shen Tian sized up Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Really? You are Qin Yu?”

”It’s true,” Qin Yu responded with an impassive expression on his face.

Shen Tian could barely suppress his urge to laugh.

This short guy in front of him was his rival?

Despite his condescending thoughts, Shen Tian still politely extended his hand and said, “Hello.”

Qin Yu immediately extended his hand to shake his.

”Hello,” Qin Yu greeted impassively.

The moment their hands touched, Qin Yu felt an immense force pressing squeezing his hand. Shen Tian had a taunting look on his face.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed. He smirked coldly in response.

In the next moment, Shen Tian’s expression began to change. From amusement, it swiftly became one of astonishment, rage, and panic.

Shen Tian felt as if his hand was grabbed by an iron vise. He feared that his bones were about to break.
