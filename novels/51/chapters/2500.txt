2501 Joint Probing

In the sky, endless phantoms suddenly condensed.

When Si Shiyue broke through the Thunder Tribulation, these forces from the other realms in the past were summoned.

The heavens and earth began to change violently, and vortices and cracks appeared in the sky.

“If a human cultivator can break through successfully, the cosmic luck of the human race’s Path of Heaven will be strengthened. But why does it look like the human race’s Path of Heaven is determined to kill Si Shiyue?”

A handsome young man among the crowd from the four sects and four schools asked.

He was Yan Wenxuan, the son of the Heavenly Divination Sect whom Yan Ruoxue had previously encountered. Even the four sects and four schools rarely saw such a thunder tribulation scene.

“Perhaps this person has truly caused the Path of Heaven to sense danger, which is why we have to kill him even if we have to use the power of the alien race. Let’s see how capable he is.”

The person who spoke had an enormous sword on his back. He was a famous cultivator from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, one of the four sects, and his name was Jian Feishuang.

He seemed to be one of the top few among this group of people. As he spoke, the people around him looked cautious, and their voices subconsciously lowered.

These phenomena surrounded Si Shiyue, releasing powerful pressure and power.

When the number of alien race experts reached a shocking level, they attacked at the same time.

In the blink of an eye, these strange phenomena suddenly transformed into the terrifying power of thunder and lightning.

The thunder and lightning interweaved like a dense net, surging over like an army.

Almost at the same time, behind this attack…

The entire space might have been distorted, and a spatial rift as massive as an abyss suddenly formed.

A gust of strong wind suddenly blew out, accompanied by a series of mournful shrieks. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It seemed to be the shrill sound caused by the friction between the vigorous winds and space.

Even Chang Mang and Jue Wu, in their cultivation realm, could not help but feel goosebumps. It was as if countless evil ghosts were surging from the endless abyss.

As the vigorous wind blew out, the final power of the thunder tribulation erupted like a spark igniting a prairie.

In an instant, the entire heaven and earth turned pale.

Even Qin Yu was incomparably shocked at the power of this final strike.

Even if he went all out, he was unsure if he could withstand the power of this thunder tribulation.

“Boom!”

Amidst the tremendous shock, all the divine senses were blocked by the lightning that permeated the sky.

No matter how powerful one’s power of divine sense was, one could only see a vast expanse of whiteness.

After a few breaths, the entire heaven and earth returned to normal.

Si Shiyue was half-kneeling on the ground. At this moment, he was unconscious, but he had taken the Nine Dragons Thunder Tribulation.

“Great! Great! Great”

Si Liuhe roared and rushed to Si Shiyue’s side to protect him.

The only person who could make Si Liuhe, the genius, be so excited was indeed Si Shiyue.

He could comprehend the power of the five elements and resist such a powerful heavenly tribulation as soon as he came out of seclusion.

Si Shiyue’s future achievements would be unimaginable.

At this moment, Si Shiyue, who had received the thunder tribulation, had a terrifying internal qi.

After the final blow, he had suffered considerable injuries.

However, facing the power of heaven and earth at such a close distance was a rare breakthrough in comprehension.

His body emitted a dazzling light with the brightness that could illuminate the entire sky.

It gave off a solemn and sacred feeling. The light probably contained powerful energy that could illuminate and purify everything in the surroundings.

“After watching the small kid’s tricks, it’s our turn. Since we’re already here, how can we not give me a big gift?”

Immortal Crane laughed heartily. “You guys watch closely. I will only attack once.”

He tapped his finger lightly, and a vortex appeared between the fingertips.

Following that, an enormous world exploded between his fingers.

Almost everyone felt an invincible suction force. It was the terrifying suction force of another world.

This kind of power was like the attraction between the stars, the suction force between his fingertips.

It even wanted to suck the Holy Region.

Revered Qi’s huge figure suddenly appeared before him, and he threw a punch.

The two terrifying forces instantly disappeared. Qin Yu frowned.

He somehow felt that Immortal Crane did not use its full strength.

Just a casual attack, Revered Qi took two steps backward before he could stabilize his body.

“Since you’re here, let’s be a good guest at the end of the human race today.”

Revered Qi said indifferently.

“That’s what I was thinking.”

In the spatial vortex, a figure suddenly appeared beside Immortal Crane.

With his appearance, the entire Holy Region became several dozen times colder.

“Ksitigarbha! Has the passage between the ghost realm and the Holy Region been opened?”

Revered Qi’s expression changed drastically.

A dignified and compassionate Bodhisattva chuckled softly. He had long hair draping over his shoulders, held a six-word mantra in his hand, and wore a crown on his head.

The left hand held a precious pearl symbolizing wisdom, while the right hand wielded a vajra symbolizing strength.

At this moment, even Revered Qi’s heart sank.

“I shouldn’t have arrived yet, but the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation just now tore a crack, allowing a portion of my power to descend here.”

Ksitigarbha chuckled softly and said bluntly.

Hearing this, almost all the human race experts could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

If his true form descended into the Holy Region, it would probably be a nightmare for anyone.

“I came here today only to take back the things of my ghost race. I have no other plans.”

Ksitigarbha smiled and his gaze suddenly fell on Qin Yu.

“Back then, a human race expert used his power of reincarnation to save your life. Today, I’m here to take it back.”

Qin Yu’s heart twitched. So it was Jun Yixian who had saved him that day.

That scholar was stranded in love for numerous cycles of reincarnation. Qin Yu suddenly thought of the person who led the way.

He must be Jun Yixian. He had thought that the one who had saved him in the end was Xiao Hai, and he did not expect him to be Jun Yixian, whom he had only met twice.

At this moment, even Qin Yu could not figure out the source of it.

“Ksitigarbha, if your true body were here, perhaps it would be fine to say such arrogant words. But with this portion of your power, it seems you don’t take the human race seriously.”

A middle-aged man with well-defined facial features stepped on a sword. He looked at Ksitigarbha with his sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes.

Almost at the same time, a beam of sword energy completely annihilated that space into nothingness.

“Projection fellow, stop embarrassing yourself again.”

“Su Xinghe of Kunlun, you’re still so hot-tempered. If you have the guts, you can come to my ghost realm and be a guest.”
