Chapter 947: Chapter 947, Saint Slayer! 

The dazzling golden light made it difficult for people to open their eyes for a short period of time, and even made the sun and moon lose their color!

Sweat broke out on Gu Xinghe’s face, as if he was shocked by this move!

Even Zhai Xing widened his eyes and stared at the scene in front of him!

“Go to hell!”Qin Yu’s voice was close to a roar, and he fiercely smashed toward Zeng Ji!

The two axes hanging above Zeng Ji’s head also carried rolling power as they slashed toward Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

The moment the two axes collided, the surrounding area turned into white flames!

Everyone subconsciously covered their eyes. Some people even temporarily lost their sight!

“Crack!”

With a crisp sound, the sealed space also began to collapse!

Rolling power surged out like a flood!

Zhai Xing hurriedly waved his hand to stop this power from leaking out!

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on that piece of space as if they were waiting for the result.

“Hahahahahaha!”

At this moment, a wild laughter came from within!

This voice was none other than Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s figure floated into the air. His clothes were tattered and his body was covered in blood. It was almost impossible to see his true appearance!

However, the madness in his eyes did not diminish at all!

“Hahahaha! A martial saint is only so-so!”Qin Yu shouted loudly.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically!

Could it be that Qin Yu really did it?

Did Qin Yu really slaughter a half-step martial saint? !

As the dust gradually settled, they saw Zeng Ji lying limply on the ground. His body was almost shattered!

Many of the bones in his body had turned into powder. It was a tragic sight! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ah...”Zeng Ji raised his hand with great difficulty. The injuries on his body had almost made him unable to stand up!

“How is this possible!”Gu Xinghe’s expression changed drastically!

Qin Yu had defeated a martial saint with the strength of a martial marquis?

This... had never been recorded in history!

“You’re not dead yet, are you...”Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.

Although his internal Qi was almost depleted, his frenzied stance displayed his desperate fighting style.

“Today, I, Qin Yu, will slaughter the Saint!”Qin Yu roared. In an instant, a violent wind blew in all directions, and his messy hair danced wildly in the air!

Golden Light appeared all over his body once again! Endless power surged toward his right fist!

“Come, let me see if you can take my second punch!”Qin Yu roared crazily!

Zeng Ji’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to dodge, but he could no longer stand up!

This punch would probably Smash Zeng Ji’s physical body and primordial spirit into pieces!

“Go to Hell!”

Accompanied by Qin Yu’s furious roar, that golden light that soared to the sky poured down once again!

Zeng ji stared at this scene with a death stare. He was so terrified that he almost fainted!

“Boom!”

A loud sound rang out!

Everyone’s vision was once again blocked!

“How is it, how is it? Did Qin Yu really kill the Martial Saint?”

“If this kid becomes a martial saint, he will definitely be invincible in the world!”

“Everyone says that the martial marquis and the martial saint are an insurmountable chasm, but Qin Yu has created history time and time again!”

Just as everyone was discussing, the dust gradually settled down.

They saw a person standing in front of Zeng Ji.

He raised his hands and blocked Qin Yu’s punch.

This person was none other than Zhai Xing.

Zhai Xing looked in Qin Yu’s direction, but no expression could be seen on his face.

Qin Yu, who had thrown two punches, had completely lost his strength.

He looked at Zhai Xing shakily and said with a grin, “It’s a pity... he was saved...”

Zhai Xing did not say anything. He just looked at Qin Yu quietly.

Qin Yu’s body swayed. He could not hold on any longer.

He fell from the sky and smashed the ground into pieces.

“Quick, quickly catch him!”Gu Xinghe said anxiously.

Zhai Xing nodded. He walked to Qin Yu’s side and held him in his hand.

“Hehe...”Qin Yu grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

He stared at Gu Xinghe and said with a cruel smile, “Gu Xinghe... be careful...”

It was unknown whether it was Qin Yu’s gaze that was too terrifying or his performance that made Gu Xinghe feel afraid.

In short, Gu Xinghe subconsciously turned his face to the side and said with some panic, “Hurry up and take him away!”

The few of them did not say anything more. The other martial saint grabbed Zeng Ji and turned around to leave.

Although Gu Xinghe had left, the surrounding crowd could not help but start discussing.

“If it wasn’t for Zhai Xing, that martial saint would have really died at the hands of Qin Yu.”

“Terrifying... too terrifying. There’s actually such a terrifying young man in this world.”

“A saint slayer... Such a feat is enough to be recorded in the annals of History!”

At the entrance of the pavilion of heavenly secrets, Luo Jingyu’s face was also filled with shock.

He knew that Qin Yu was very strong, but he did not expect him to be this strong.

He had defeated a martial saint at the half-step martial saint stage and had almost taken his life.

“That’s great. We’ve finally captured him.”Luo Yang, who was at the side, let out a sigh of relief.

Luo Jingyu glanced at Luo Yang and said coldly, “It was you who informed Gu Xinghe?”

“That’s right,”Luo Yang said with a slightly smug expression.

Luo Jingyu opened his mouth and couldn’t help but sigh in the end.

“If Qin Yu doesn’t die, we’ll definitely suffer a calamity...”Luo Jingyu muttered in a low voice.

Luo yang sneered and said, “Dad, What are you thinking? How can he not die? The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely not let him off.”

Luo Jingyu waved his hand and said no more.

...

This matter quickly swept through the entire martial arts world.

Almost everyone heard the news at the first moment.

“What? Qin Yu actually defeated the martial saint? Damn, he’s giving us face!”Zhuang Teng slapped the table and said excitedly.

“That young man with the hat is Qin Yu,”Kong Yun said with a frown.

Although Kong Yun didn’t want to admit that he was inferior to Qin Yu, he was completely convinced by Qin Yu’s heroic deed today.

“No Wonder.”Chang Mang suddenly stood up.

He took a deep breath and said, “Qin Yu saved my life. Now that he is caught, I can not ignore it!”

“Brother Chang, this matter can not be conflicted. Let us discuss it,”Yao Meng said.

Chang man gritted his teeth and could only sit down unwillingly.

In the Yan family, Yan Jinyao looked at the content on his phone and could not help but tremble.

“This Qin Yu...”Yan Jinyao’s face was extremely gloomy.
