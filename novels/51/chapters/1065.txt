Chapter 1066: Chapter 1,066, Gu Zizhen showed his might 

Qin Yu fighting against Gu Zizhen was definitely an exciting event!

Gu Zizhen glanced around and said through gritted teeth, “Little Bastard, what exactly do you want to do by tricking me to come here? !”

Qin Yu said coldly, “I just want to kill you. I don’t have any other intentions.”

“Do you think you have what it takes to say such arrogant words? !”Gu Zizhen shouted angrily, causing the air to buzz!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly turned into a golden light and sped off into the distance!

“Little Bastard, do you want to run? In your dreams!”Gu Zizhen shouted angrily and quickly chased after him.

The surrounding crowd also followed behind him, wanting to watch this great battle.

Qin Yu came to a place along the way. This place was empty and there were no signs of human habitation. There were also no tall buildings.

Gu Zizhen sneered and said, “Death is imminent. You think too much.”

“I’m different from you. I don’t want to implicate innocent people,”Qin Yu said coldly.

At this time, the crowd of onlookers also caught up.

They naturally understood Qin Yu’s intention, and a trace of shock flashed across their faces.

It was the style of everyone to care about others in such a big battle!

“Gu Zizhen, the glory of the second secret realm is coming to an end.”Qin Yu took a deep breath, the internal Qi in his body was surging rapidly, as if he had used some secret technique!

This secret technique came from Jiang he’s internal Qi!

Under the enhancement of internal QI, the golden glow on Qin Yu’s body grew stronger, and his aura was extremely dense, like a vast ocean!

Even Gu Zizhen was shocked! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Just now, the two of them were on par, and now that Qin Yu’s strength had soared again, how could Gu Zizhen have any chance of winning?

“Swoosh!”

Just as Gu Zizhen was shocked, Qin Yu had already arrived!

That incomparably heavy internal Qi spread out from Qin Yu’s body, pressing straight towards Gu Zizhen!

Gu Zizhen really wanted to withdraw and leave, but was held back by Qin Yu’s heavy falling space, unable to escape!

“Bang!”

The absolute beginning sacred fist appeared in an instant. The golden light was like a battleship that had come from the ancient times. It was incomparably huge, and it seemed as if it was going to collapse the entire world!

“Boom!”

At this critical moment, Gu Zizhen suddenly took out a long spear and faced Qin Yu’s fist.

“Clang!”

That clear sound was extremely ear-piercing. It was unknown how many people’s ears were directly shaken until they bled!

Looking at Gu Zizhen again, he held a long spear in his hand. The tip of the spear collided with Qin Yu’s fist, forming waves of Qi.

“Whoosh”

“Whoosh!”

The two of them pulled themselves out at the same time and retreated, standing not far away.

Gu Zizhen held this long spear, his face filled with frost.

This long spear was very extraordinary. It was unknown what kind of material it was made of, but under the sunlight, it emitted a strange black glow.

Gu Zizhen held the spear with one hand. His expression was grave, as if he was shocked by Qin Yu’s strength.

“Buzz!”

Gu Zizhen suddenly attacked. The long spear in his hand pierced through the air. In a breath’s time, there were three steps and twenty-eight spear strikes. The air was almost ignited!

That dragon-like spear light was like a thick and strong brilliance, and it was heading straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu stepped on the ‘xing’character and shot backward explosively.

Before Qin Yu could let out a sigh of relief, Gu Zizhen had stabbed out hundreds of times!

“Dang dang dang!”

In almost an instant, dozens of bloody holes appeared on Qin Yu’s body, even revealing his ghastly white bones!

When everyone saw this, they were all shocked!

The long spear in Gu Zizhen’s hand was too terrifying. It was like a divine weapon, shattering the heaven and earth wherever it touched!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely grave. If he had not used the ‘xing’character, these few strikes would have been enough to shatter his body.

“Die!”

Gu Zizhen roared again. This time, he held the spear with both hands. The tip of the spear streaked across the sky, and a rainbow-like ray of divine light slashed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu naturally would not wait for his death. His hands moved quickly, and actually condensed a mountain-like golden light!

This was the condensation of pure internal Qi. It was incomparably thick and heavy, like a golden mountain or a ball of raging fire!

“Boom!”

The golden light blocked in front of Qin Yu and withstood the mighty long spear!

However, Gu Zizhen would not give up just like that. He held the spear with both hands and suddenly stabbed out, directly piercing through the Golden Mountain!

“Be careful!”Seeing this, the immortal crane’s expression changed greatly!

He wanted to help, but it was too late!

“You’re Dead!”Gu Zizhen shouted loudly.

The long spear pierced through Qin Yu’s body, but what was shocking was that the spearhead directly penetrated into Qin Yu’s body and then went through!

“Huh?”Gu Zizhen’s face changed. He suddenly realized that something was wrong!

It was an afterimage! It was an afterimage left behind by the extreme use of the line formula!

Gu Zizhen, who had rich combat experience, quickly reacted, but it was already too late.

He only felt waves of heat crushing down from above his head, burning his clothes dry in an instant! His skin was shrinking at this moment!

Looking Up, he saw two hands dragging a terrifying golden light, smashing down like the Sun and the Moon!

“Boom!”

The spell was extremely powerful, smashing onto Gu Zizhen’s back.

His back was bent, and he spat out a mouthful of blood as his body crashed into the ground!

Cracks appeared on the ground, and soon after, large patches of the ground collapsed!

When everyone saw this, they all sucked in a breath of cold air!

Qin Yu had succeeded! The former number one person in the world, Gu Zizhen, had actually been smashed into the ground!

“Ah!”

At this moment, the spear light shot up from the ground like a spring onion, piercing straight at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu hurriedly dodged. The long spear brushed against Qin Yu’s chin and flew up into the air!

“Look above your head!”The Immortal Crane suddenly roared!

Qin Yu looked up and saw that the long spear was burning with flames. The Flames were like divine phoenixes from the ancient times, falling rapidly downwards!

“Not good!”

Qin Yu secretly felt that things were not good. If he wanted to dodge now, it was obviously too late!
