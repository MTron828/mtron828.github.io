Chapter 1412: Chapter 1412, City Lord of Divine Capital 1

Hearing this, the Great Elder’s face instantly turned red.

In the next second, he spat out a mouthful of blood and sat on the ground. His face instantly turned extremely pale.

“He... he...”the great elder opened his mouth, and his aura became even weaker.

In less than half a second, he fell to the ground and fainted.

More than half an hour later.

The sect master stood in front of the first elder and looked at the extremely weak first elder. His heart was filled with mixed feelings.

“Sect master... i... Have embarrassed the Heavenly Cloud Sect...”the first elder opened his mouth and said with great difficulty.

The sect master, who originally wanted to hold him accountable, could not help but shake his head at this moment.

He waved his hand and said, “You should rest well. This is nothing. Don’t Ruin Your Dao Heart because of this.”

Hearing this, the first elder’s eyes immediately filled with tears.

He said in a trembling voice, “Sect master, I will definitely kill Qin Yu and make up for the Heavenly Cloud Sect...”

But the sect master waved his hand and then turned around to leave.

Standing on the Cultivation Mountain.

The sect master put his hands behind his back and remained silent.

He looked at the horizon and no one knew what he was thinking.

He was once a great pioneer who conquered the entire southern province in one go.

In the end, he was a leader who ruled the entire heavenly cloud sect.

But now, he was no longer in high spirits. He even suspected that he was old and could not keep up with the times.

A moment later, the sect master sighed.

He said in a low voice, “Let me handle this matter personally.”

...

The news of the first elder being chased away by Qin Yu spread once again.

Although the Heavenly Cloud sect tried their best to suppress the news, the news spread throughout the entire South Province as if it had grown wings.

“Did you hear? The first Elder was beaten severely by Qin Yu!”

“Yes, the first elder fled in a sorry state. Haha, not long ago, he was beaten away by Wen Wentong and today, he was beaten back by Qin Yu. The first elder lost all his face.”

“It is said that Qin Yu won by means of sneak attacks. It is an unfair victory.”

Everyone knew that Qin Yu won the great elder by means of sneak attacks. Therefore, there were different opinions in the South Province.

Some people felt that Qin Yu won by means of despicable means.

Some people also felt that they were not challenging each other, but enemies. Therefore, everything was based on winning. There was no problem with any means.

In short, the first elder’s reputation had been completely lost. He had even obtained a title because of this: the number one long leg of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

There was no other reason. It was because the first elder had been defeated twice in a row.

When the first elder, who was lying on the bed, heard this title, he fainted from anger once again.

...

Divine capital city.

Qin Yu looked at the divine inscription formation that had appeared here and could not help but feel puzzled.

“How long can this formation last?”Qin Yu mumbled.

Back then, before Qin Yu had the chance to ask, tie Dan had already fainted.

“Forget it, let’s just ignore him.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

With his current state, there weren’t many people in the entire South Prefecture who could kill him.

Even the first elder was unable to break through Qin Yu’s defense, let alone others.

A few days later, Qin Yu got up and planned to head to Yang City to look for the last bit of life force.

But just as he was about to leave, a tall man suddenly came from outside.

This man was travel-worn and had an extraordinary aura.

He looked up at the three big words on the divine capital city and said in a low voice, “Divine capital city... This Is it.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He walked to the door and said in a deep voice, “Someone from the Tianyun Sect?”

The other party shook his head and immediately asked, “Are you Qin Yu?”

Qin Yu looked at the other party suspiciously with a hint of vigilance in his eyes.

When the other party saw this, he hurriedly said, “I have been put on the list of fugitives by the Tianyun sect. I heard that this divine capital city can resist the Tianyun sect, so I wanted to take refuge here. I wonder if brother Qin can agree.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Qin Yu could not help but feel a little surprised. He had never expected that there would actually be someone who would seek refuge with him, or rather, seek refuge with the divine capital city.

In a short moment, there were people who rushed here again.

And their goal was to avoid the pursuit of the Tianyun sect.

Qin Yu could not refuse, so he welcomed all of them into the divine capital city.

In the next few days.

More and more people came to seek refuge.

Most of these people wanted to seek protection because they had offended the heavenly cloud sect.

In just a few days, the originally desolate divine capital became prosperous in the blink of an eye.

They were all cultivators after all. It was not a problem to rebuild a city with the abilities of a cultivator.

Under the joint efforts of everyone, the divine capital gradually erected buildings, and this deserted divine capital seemed to be on the verge of rising again.

Qin Yu stood on top of the tall attic, looking at the slowly rising divine capital city. His heart was filled with mixed feelings.

This was something he had never expected. The enemies of the Heavenly Cloud sect had all become citizens of the divine capital city.

A few more days passed.

Qin Yu did not waste any more time. He left the divine capital city on a flying exotic beast. He planned to head to Yang City to find the last bit of life force.

The divine capital was very far from Yang City. Qin Yu would need to spend several days.

On this day.

Qin Yu passed by an extremely prosperous city. He hadn’t eaten for a long time, so he landed in this city.
