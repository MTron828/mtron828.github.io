Chapter 898: Chapter 898, decision 

Li Yu stood guard here until the two of them were far away. Only then did he quickly walk to the vicinity of the mystic realm.

After hurriedly opening the mystic realm, Li Yu worriedly entered.

Inside the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu was teaching Yan ruoxue cultivation techniques.

He deliberately found a few cultivation techniques suitable for Yan Ruoxue from his inherited memories.

These cultivation techniques were quite beautiful and extremely powerful, but unfortunately, these cultivation techniques were very rare.

At this moment, Li Yu walked over from not far away in a hurry.

When they saw Li Yu, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue stood up at the same time and looked over.

“Not good.”After Li Yu saw them, he hurriedly said.

“What’s Wrong?”Qin Yu asked. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Li Yu said in a low voice, “Tomorrow, Du Xuanyu will come to check this place. With his ability, it’s not a problem for him to open the mystic realm.”

Then, Li Yu told Qin Yu what had happened.

After saying that, Qin Yu’s expression instantly became extremely ugly.

“That is to say... in front of him, it’s impossible for us to escape?”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Li Yu nodded and said, “Basically, so... we’d better leave this place as soon as possible.”

“Once he finds this mystic realm, we’ll definitely die.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “But even if we leave the secret realm, there’s no way to escape.”

With the martial saint’s ability, it was not difficult to find the two of them.

Most importantly, the JINGDU martial arts association had Yan Ruoxue’s blood.

This allowed them to easily find Yan Ruoxue’s location using the secret method.

“Let’s think about what to do.”Li Yu sighed slightly.

Qin Yu did not say anything. He sat there for a long time and his mind was filled with thoughts of how to deal with it.

The sky gradually darkened. Qin Yu sat under the starry sky and held his chin, his face full of worry.

“How about... We split up temporarily? At least one person can escape.”Yan Ruoxue suggested.

Qin Yu immediately waved his hand and said, “No, absolutely not.”

“Alright, at worst, let them take me away. They won’t kill me anyway.”Yan Ruoxue pinched Qin Yu’s shoulder and said with a smile.

“As long as I don’t die, isn’t that enough? When you become stronger in the future, you can save me again.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He grabbed Yan Ruoxue’s shoulder and said in a cold voice, “I absolutely won’t allow you to suffer that kind of suffering again. I absolutely won’t allow it!”

Yan Ruoxue was about to say something when Qin Yu suddenly stood up and said, “I already have an idea.”

“What Idea?”Yan Ruoxue asked.

Qin Yu glanced around and said, “This area is very big. I’ll think of a way to conceal your internal Qi. You’re Only a martial grandmaster, so it’s not difficult to conceal your internal Qi.”

“And then?”Yan Ruoxue suddenly had a bad feeling.

Qin Yu said coldly, “If they really find out, just let them take me away.”

“No!”Yan Ruoxue hurriedly shook her head.

“Have you ever thought that if I’m taken away, at most I’ll be absorbed by their blood, but my life won’t be in Danger?”

“But you’re different. If you’re taken away, they won’t let you go. I definitely won’t agree to your idea!”

“If you insist, I will go out now and let them take me away!”

Looking at Yan Ruoxue’s determined expression, Qin Yu scratched his head and said with a smile, “What you said seems to make sense. Then I will listen to you.”

Only then did Yan Ruoxue let out a sigh of relief. She gently leaned against Qin Yu’s side and said in a low voice, “As long as we are alive, we have hope...”

Before she finished speaking, Yan Ruoxue suddenly felt a bout of blackness in front of her eyes. In a moment, she fainted.

Qin Yu gently hugged Yan Ruoxue and said in a low voice, “I can’t let you suffer that kind of pain anymore, so... I can only risk it.”

Li Yu, who was beside her, said in a deep voice, “But what if du Xuanyu wants to search the entire mystic realm? By then, we won’t be able to escape.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and grinned. “So... I plan to leave the mystic realm before tomorrow to attract their attention.”

“I’ll leave this mystic realm to you.”Qin Yu looked at Li Yu.

Li Yu frowned and said, “If you’re discovered, you’ll be dead for sure.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything.

Not everything in this world could be controlled by oneself. Those who couldn’t be controlled were the ones who had to make a choice.

Qin Yu gently hugged Yan ruoxue and covered the internal Qi on her body.

She was only a martial grandmaster. With Qin Yu’s technique, he could cover 99% of her internal Qi. Even a martial saint might not be able to detect it.

However, this was not the most important thing. The most important thing was to attract everyone’s attention.

“If possible, I will take the opportunity to kill that master Du,”Qin Yu said coldly.

As long as they killed this mystic realm master, they would not be able to find this mystic realm!

At night, Qin Yu quietly hugged Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue was sleeping soundly in his arms.

Qin Yu lowered his head and looked at the side of Yan Ruoxue’s face. A trace of reluctance flashed in his eyes.

“I don’t know if I can survive this time. If I’m lucky enough to survive, I’ll definitely accompany you every day...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. His eyes were filled with tenderness.
