Chapter 2645: Killing Intent of Another Holy Lord

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Different from Qin Yu’s force, his mastery of the Order of Rules was complete.

“The Great Expansion Divine Technique truly is the source of the Path of Heaven rules within this Saint Kingdom. In that case, who could stop me here?”

When Hua Tian witnessed the transformation, he finally couldn’t contain himself and burst into loud laughter.

“The Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique!”

A fist of cosmic luck suddenly extended from his back and slammed into a small mountain.

Upon impact with the mountainside, the fist produced a tremendous vibration, leaving behind a visibly large fist imprint.

If Qin Yu were to witness this, he would undoubtedly feel a chill down his spine.

It was worth noting that Qin Yu’s previous eighty percent power Chasing Sun

Arrow had merely left a slightly larger hole in the ground. However, now that Hua Tian had mastered the power of rules, his strength had increased by more than a hundredfold.

Moreover, he could now perceive the cosmic luck filling the sky even more clearly, and he could even faintly discern some dangerous killing intent.

Such was the power of the Great Expansion Divine Technique, and the Way of Cosmic Luck was indeed fearsome.

Even when he was waiting in purgatory, Hua Tian could still see the cosmic luck that filled the sky.

And finally, he waited for the change in the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect. He obtained divine flame runes and came to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, where he found the source of the Way of Rules that belonged to him.

“Hahaha, what can these tiny killing intents do compared to the cosmic luck that fills the sky?”

Hua Tian laughed heartily, but he hesitated for a moment and muttered to himself.

“Although the Demon Sealing Valley doesn’t pose much of a threat to me, it still exists. I’ll look for a few ancient demons to hunt and plunder their Saint Power, strengthening myself to the extreme before reentering.”

Hua Tian patted his belly and set off towards another section of the Ancient Demon Land.

In the place where the Ancient Demon Wu Tian resides, Pang De frowned and asked.

“Buddha Wu Tian, I sense that this person’s mind is uneasy. Did you give him the Black Lotus?”

“No matter…” Wu Tian replied, a mysterious smile gracing his lips.

“The black lotus is an extension of my power and essence. Even if bestowed upon another, it matters not. What I seek is the life of that man, Qin Yu.”

“Buddha Wu Tian, but why? Even if he possesses the Heart of Saint Kingdom, is it truly necessary for you to expend such effort in dealing with him? Furthermore, I sense no connection between him and us. Could it be that he poses a fatal threat to us?”

Pang De remained puzzled. The fact that Wu Tian would employ his cherished

black lotus to eliminate a single individual seemed excessive, despite the individual’s purported talent. After a brief pause, Wu Tian continued.

“He arrived.”

Before Wu Tian’s eye, an old woman with a human head and a Serpent’s body appeared out of thin air.

The Serpent-like pupils between her eyes looked extremely eerie.

With her arrival, the mist here was instantly dispersed.

The moment Pang De sensed her internal qi, his body shook violently, and his internal organs were nearly torn apart.

“Emerald Serpent, it’s been so long, yet you’re still so irritable?” Wu Tian blocked her internal and saved Pang De.

Pang De was astonished. It was none other than the Emerald Serpent Witch, and she came in the form of an extremely powerful clone. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have sensed such terrifying holy power.

“Wu Tian, it’s been ages. You’re weak as ever. If it weren’t for the Emerald Serpents’ innate ability to remember their enemies’ internal qi, I wouldn’t have believed it was you.”

The old woman stamped her dragon-headed cane and said coldly.

“Hahaha, isn’t having your power enough? But do the other Holy Lords know you sent me here? This was the contract you all signed together back then.”

Wu Tian remained unperturbed. He engaged in familial banter with the Emerald Serpent Witch.

‘You needn’t worry about that. Remember your promise. If you don’t kill this kid, your divine soul will never find peace.”

The Emerald Serpent Witch hurled an arm at Wu Tian, then tossed it away.

The sound of countless shackles breaking echoed from the void around the arm.

The arm suddenly expanded and transformed into Wu Tian in the air.

Slowly melding with Wu Tian, his aura skyrocketed at an incredible speed.

Witnessing Wu Tian’s surging internal qi, a trace of fear flickered in the Serpent witch’s eyes.

However, driven by vengeance, she was prepared to give her all. Her offspring, Yin Lin, had been slain by Qin Yu here. Yin Lin was born directly from her blood essence, pure and unblemished, closer to her than any kin.

Therefore, she couldn’t let Qin Yu go unpunished. Otherwise, she would never find peace for the rest of her life.

They only used two hands, yet they were not afraid that Wu Tian could break through the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom and return to the world of the living to threaten them.

“Don’t worry, I’ve already arranged everything. There will be news soon.”

Wu Tian’s aura underwent a drastic change after he had completely merged with the other.

Even at this moment, the Emerald Serpent Witch felt a little afraid of him.

However, once a person reached this realm, they would not change their promise.

“Humph.”

The Emerald Serpent Witch seemed to have sensed something. Her body suddenly disappeared, leaving behind a sentence.

“I’ll wait for your news.”

“It’s the Lord of the Emerald Serpent Saint Kingdom. How dare she take the risk to enter the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom? If she’s discovered by the power of order here, I’m afraid her body will be left here.”

Pang De stared at her departing figure in horror.

A Holy Lord entering another Saint Kingdom was something that had happened before, but the outcome wasn’t very good.

Unless they had overwhelming strength, the other Holy Lord would not easily enter another Saint Kingdom.

The stronger one was, the harsher the suppression they would face in the Saint Kingdom. They might not even have 30% of their strength left. Thus, taking the risk to enter another Saint Kingdom was an extremely risky matter.

“If Chen Shuang was here, she wouldn’t dare either. But now that Chen Shuang has fallen and the power of the Saint Kingdom has been stolen, she dared to take the risk to come here. As a result, she only has one choice. She temporarily can’t enter any other places.”

Wu Tian smiled strangely.

Pang De bowed respectfully to Wu Tian. He did not expect Wu Tian to have planned all of this.

After he had given Avici Dao’s Three Sabers to control him, he did not regain consciousness until he met Wu Tian.

At this moment, he was even more convinced by Wu Tian.

Qin Yu also did not expect that a killing intent had already silently targeted him.

He began to hunt these ancient demons in this Ancient Demon Land.

Although he had only comprehended the destructive force, this power that involved the core order of the Saint Kingdom was too powerful. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu had directly raised his divine soul to the True Consciousness Realm, so his soul could withstand more Saint Power and buy time to increase his strength. This was what Qin Yu was doing now..
