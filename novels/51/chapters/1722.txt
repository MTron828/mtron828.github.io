Chapter 1723: The Battle Started Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This was an extremely fearsome aura that far exceeded that of other cultivators at Reversion Void Stage.

Everyone present was stunned by this aura, and even the Reversion Void Stage cultivators who were hiding began to feel terrified.

The Lord of North Plain was extremely terrifying.

Xiao Sheng’s expression changed slightly.

Clearly, the power of Yuan Xiu was beyond his imagination.

However, this was not enough to scare off Xiao Sheng. He glared at Yuan Xiu in front of him coldly. Without saying a word, he raised his hand and make his killing move.

The crystal-clear radiance in his palm was incomparably dazzling. It was like a huge mountain that smashed through the void and came straight at Yuan Xiu.

Xiao Sheng made the first move. It was obvious that he did not dare to hide his real strength in the face of Yuan Xiu, who was so terrifyingly strong.

“Good!” Yuan Xiu laughed heartily.

He used the dao technique and a seven-colored radiance fused into his pitch-black palm.

At the moment of collision, the entire void was shattered.

A terrifying internal qi shot up into the sky, piercing through the dark clouds in the sky.

Xiao Sheng didn’t dare to be slower than Yuan Xiu. He continued to use his technique with his palm.

The dao technique merged in his palm, and marks burst out one after another.

In the blink of an eye, Xiao Sheng had actually accumulated 3000 marks.

Each mark was shining with extraordinary brilliance.

“How terrifying! He actually managed to accumulate three thousand marks in such a short time!”

“I’m afraid that no one in this world can do it other than Xiao Sheng!”

Yuan Xiu was also slightly surprised. He coldly said, “Xiao Sheng, you’re truly a chosen one. It’s a pity that you’re going to die in front of me today!”

Yuan Xiu stretched out his hand and a bronze mirror appeared in his palm.

This bronze mirror seemed to be an extremely ancient magical artifact, exuding an ancient aura.

However, someone soon realized that something was wrong.

The bronze mirror was not a real magical artifact at all. It was something that Yuan Xiu had created using his dao technique.

“Using the dao technique to create a magical artifact? Yuan Xiu is so strong!”

For a moment, everyone’s faces were filled with shock.

Although this bronze mirror was created, it still had some of its original internal qi and was extremely terrifying.

Yuan Xiu activated the bronze mirror, and a powerful internal qi instantly pressed down on Xiao Sheng.

The collision this time had completely shattered the mountain. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

With the two people’s collision as the center, cracks extended out for dozens of stars, and the entire city was about to collapse.

The two of them did not say anything and started an unprecedented battle.

In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already attacked each other hundreds of times.

That terrifying internal qi enveloped everything, and nobody else dared to move forward.

The two of them were overlords of their own territories and possessed extremely powerful combat abilities. Their techniques were also extremely powerful.

The people who were watching from afar were all shocked. It was too terrifying. Only at this moment did they realize the gap between the two sides.

Yuan Xiu relied on the bronze mirror in his hand and emitted rays of terrifying light.

Xiao Sheng’s expression didn’t change. His crystal-clear palm struck out as if he wanted to shatter everything. It seemed nothing could stop him.

However, Xiao Sheng was only a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator. In front of Yuan Xiu, his cultivation realm was too low, so he was finally in a passive position.

BOOM!

The bronze mirror shone with three thousand rays of light, one of which shot past Xiao Sheng’s body.

Although it was only a slight touch, it still pierced through Xiao Sheng’s body and shattered his bones.

BANG!

Xiao Sheng, who was known to be invincible, was forced back several steps as he spat out a mouthful of blood.

This scene made everyone feel shocked and complicated.

Ever since Xiao Sheng was known by the world, he had never been defeated. He used to be truly invincible.

He was a person who had stood at the peak for far too long, so everyone did not want him to fall.

“Don’t tell me that Xiao Sheng is going to lose.”

“Xiao Sheng is only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage. It’s already praiseworthy for him to be able to fight Yuan Xiu for such a long time.”

“It’s all because of Xiao Sheng’s arrogance. He clearly has the ability to reach the Reversion Void Stage, but he’s stuck at the half-step Reversion Void Stage. He deserves to die in battle today.”

While everyone was still in shock, some people were surprised to find that the bronze mirror in Yuan Xiu’s hand had been shattered.

“What? Is the bronze mirror actually shattered? When did Xiao Sheng do it? And how did he do that?”

“That’s weird. I didn’t see Xiao Sheng make a move at all!”

“What method did he use?”

Everyone was completely shocked.

On the other hand, Yuan Xiu put on a serious look.

He looked at the shattered bronze mirroring his palm and said coldly, “You’re truly fearsome. With just a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivation base, you managed to shatter my bronze mirror. No wonder they’re all so scared of you.”

Xiao Sheng wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. The wounds on his body glowed with a five-colored radiance and were slowly healing.

Yuan Xiu was really shocked at the sight of this technique. He shouted, “What kind of terrifying inheritance did you obtain?”

Xiao Sheng didn’t say anything and responded with a palm strike.

The palm was as big as a millstone. It directly passed through the void and approached Yuan Xiu in the blink of an eye.

Yuan Xiu snorted coldly. His body exuded an internal qi, which was similar to that of a Devil Lord, which was extremely terrifying.

He punched out and shattered the millstone.

Bang!

At this moment, Xiao Sheng’s body overgrew the void and actually became a little dim, as if he was about to become one with the void.

“Spatial spells are useless against me!”

Yuan Xiu was not afraid at all. With a furious roar, he rose from the ground and the dark clouds in the sky turned black.

“Take this!”

Yuan Xiu bellowed and stretched out his hand to grab at the sky. The next second, the dark clouds in the sky were pulled down by him like a blanket.

It was rattling.

Countless chains shot out from his palm and bound the area.

Xiao Sheng, who had disappeared into the void, was immediately restricted and had nowhere to hide!

“You should die!”

Yuan Xiu shouted angrily and quickly used his dao technique. A black blade shot out of his mouth, piercing through the void and slashing toward Xiao Sheng.

Xiao Sheng’s body, along with the void, was bound by the chains. He was unable to move at all.

Those chains were not ordinary chains. They were the chains of dao and order. It seemed to be impossible for Xiao Sheng to break free.

He would not be able to recover his mobility in a short period of time.

“Holy cr*p!”

Everyone’s expression changed drastically, and they could not help but break out in cold sweats.

At this critical moment, a black void appeared in front of Xiao Sheng.

This technique was Rashomon. The black blade entered Rashomonand and disappeared.

“What? How did Saint Xiao manage to use Rashomon? His body was clearly restrained!”

“That’s right. Does he only have to use his mind to activate his technique?”

Even Yuan Xiu was slightly surprised. Even he had not been able to see Xiao Sheng’s technique clearly.
