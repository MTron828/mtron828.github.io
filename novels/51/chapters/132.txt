Chapter 133: I Was Poisoned, But Not Completely Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Wu Hongchang’s attitude was extremely humble, and he was no longer as arrogant as before.

He sat opposite Qin Yu and handed over the pill with both hands.

“I hope that you and I can turn over a new leaf. I also hope that Mr. Qin can give me some pointers.” Wu Hongchang said courteously.

Qin Yu took a look at the pill and shook his head. “Mr. Wu, you don’t have to be so polite. You can take this pill back. As for giving pointers, we can talk to each other.”

When he heard this, Wu Hongchang hurriedly stood up and said with slight fear, “Mr. Qin, please accept this pill! Otherwise, my conscience won’t allow it!”

Qin Yu looked at the pill and contemplated it for a moment. Then, he nodded and said, “Alright, then I can only accept it.”

This pill looked quite attractive. Although it couldn’t be compared to those hundred-year-old herbs, it would definitely be helpful in increasing one’s strength.

After Qin Yu accepted the pill, the two of them began to chat.

Wu Hongchang talked about his past and how he had come this far from nothing.

This made Qin Yu empathize with him somewhat, because Wu Hongchang’s past hardships were too similar to his own.

“Mr. Qin, your future is full of potential. Yet at my age, there’s no hope anymore.” Wu Hongchang sighed.

When he heard this, Qin Yu smiled and comforted him, “Mr. Wu, you don’t have to underestimate yourself. There are very few people who can reach your level.”

Wu Hongchang forced a smile and said, “That being said, I have been stuck at the Inner Strength Master Hands level for more than ten years. I just can’t pass that level.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu contemplated it for a moment.

He walked to Wu Hongchang and said, “You might as well try to use your Inner Strength to break through the major acupoints. Maybe it will work.”

Martial arts training and spiritual cultivation were essentially the same. The only difference was that one relied on Inner Strength, while the other relied on spiritual energy.

Therefore, Qin Yu’s experience could also be used in martial arts training.

When he heard this, Wu Hongchang hurriedly closed his eyes and tried to break through the acupoints according to Qin Yu’s method.

A few minutes later, Wu Hongchang opened his eyes in surprise and said excitedly, “It really works! Mr. Qin, you’re really a genius. I have never heard of such a method before!”

“Maybe you have never seen it before.” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Wu Hongchang was extremely excited. He had been stuck at this level for many years and had never made any progress. Now that he knew of Qin Yu’s method, he was suddenly filled with hope.

“Mr. Qin, then I won’t stay any longer. I want to try to break through to the Inner Strength Past Master level. I will never forget your kindness!” Wu Hongchang stood up and said respectfully.

“You’re too courteous, Mr. Wu.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

After sending Wu Hongchang away, Yao Qing couldn’t help but say, “Wu Hongchang is a cunning villain. You helping him is pointless and it’ll never be reciprocated!”

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t explain.

After taking something from him, he naturally couldn’t take it for free.

Then, Qin Yu took out the pill that Wu Hongchang sent over.

He rubbed it in his hand for a moment and said, “This pill might benefit me substantially.”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu swallowed the pill.

After the pill entered his stomach, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly.

Yao Qing, afraid of disturbing Qin Yu, stood at the side and didn’t say a word.

A few minutes later, Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed, then he clutched his stomach and cried out in pain!

“It hurts... my stomach hurts so much. It’s like a bomb exploded...” Drops of sweat dripped down from Qin Yu’s forehead! He let out a miserable roar!

Yao Qing, who was at the side, panicked. He said anxiously, “Mr. Qin, are... are you okay? I... I’ll send you to the hospital right now!”

As soon as he said that, the door of the room was suddenly kicked open!

Then, he saw Wu Hongchang standing at the door proudly.

“Hahaha, Qin Yu, you finally fell into my hands!” Wu Hongchang couldn’t help but laugh.

“It was you!” Yao Qing was immediately enraged. He clenched his fist and rushed towards Wu Hongchang!

However, Wu Hongchang was an Inner Strength Master Hands after all. His strength definitely far surpassed Yao Qing’s.

Wu Hongchang waved his hand, and Yao Qing was instantly sent flying!

“Humph, a mere ant dares to make a ruckus in front of me?” Wu Hongchang said indifferently.

Yao Qing couldn’t help but feel angry. He gritted his teeth and said, “Mr. Qin was kind enough to help you breakthrough, but you backstabbed him. What sort of person are you?!”

Wu Hongchang didn’t care at all. Instead, he said proudly, “This is called ‘all is fair in war’. Qin Yu, you’re still too naive.”

Qin Yu held his stomach and said with difficulty, “You... what exactly is this thing...”

Wu Hongchang laughed and said, “This is a poison that I bought from an expert in the southwest when I was traveling a few years ago.”

“As long as you take this medicine, your body will be powerless and your Inner Strength will dissipate!”

“Qin Yu, currently, you’re no different from an ordinary person!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Wu Hongchang, you’re really despicable!”

Wu Hongchang sneered and said, “You deserve it. How dare a youngster try to steal my limelight? You deserve to die!”

Qin Yu held his stomach and squinted his eyes as he said, “You want to kill me because of this reason?”

“There are many reasons to kill you. I don’t like you. Does this count?” Wu Hongchang snickered.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but show anger. In the eyes of these people, were human lives that trivial?

He looked at Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground and wailing. He couldn’t help but mutter, “The seller didn’t say that this medicine would cause stomach pain. I didn’t expect it to have an unexpected effect.”

“Huh? It won’t cause stomach pain?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“But... doesn’t poison usually cause stomach pain?” Qin Yu muttered.

When he heard this, Wu Hongchang said impatiently, “How would I know? Maybe I’m wrong. In short, you’re going to die today!”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization. He took his hand away from his stomach and said with a smile, “You didn’t remember wrong. I guessed wrong.”

“What do you mean?” Wu Hongchang couldn’t help but be puzzled.

“Nothing.” Qin Yu didn’t explain anything. Instead, he stood up from the ground.

He dusted his body and grinned. “Wu Hongchang, an ungrateful person like you really makes people feel disgusted. I should have beaten you to death back then.”

Wu Hongchang wasn’t fazed. He snickered and said, “So what? You’re already powerless now. What’s the point of saying all this?”

“Yeah.” Qin Yu sighed.

“I’m already crippled now. Hurry up and do it.”

Wu Hongchang snorted coldly and said, “You don’t need to remind me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Wu Hongchang rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t dodge. He simply let his fist land on his body.

“Clang!” A loud sound was heard! Wu Hongchang felt that his fist seemed to have hit a piece of steel and his wrist was in extreme pain!

“How is that possible?!” Wu Hongchang’s expression suddenly changed.

“You... you weren’t poisoned at all?” Wu Hongchang couldn’t help but take two steps back.

Qin Yu grinned and said, “I was poisoned, but not completely.”
