Chapter 1296: Chapter 1,296, a strange change 

“So Fast?”Qin Yu frowned.

Looking at the empty bottle, Qin Yu frowned more and more.

He tried to mobilize the spiritual power in his body, but he was shocked to find that there was still no spiritual power in his body.

“How could this be?”Qin Yu’s face changed slightly.

He glanced at the bottle in his hand and said in a low voice, “Could it be that this is not the internal Qi of life at all?”

It was impossible. How could the internal Qi of life be fake?

He tried to mobilize the spiritual power in his body again, but he found that there was still no spiritual power to speak of.

Qin Yu did not say anything. He was a little annoyed in his heart.

He sat there for a long time. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something. Then, he hurriedly got up and rushed out of the cave.

Qin Yu ran all the way to the side of the small river by the cave. He lowered his head and looked at his reflection in the small river.

Looking at the mirror image in the reflection, Qin Yu was surprised to find that the white hair on his forehead was less.

The white hair on his head had a wisp of black hair now.

This was enough to prove that what Qin Yu swallowed just now was the Qi of Life!

“Could it be... that the Qi of life is not enough to restore my spiritual power?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

After thinking about it, it seemed that there was only one possibility.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground, trying to feel the difference in his body.

Soon, he noticed a slight change.

Apart from the Wisp of black hair, Qin Yu’s injuries had also recovered a lot.

Not only that, his newly-born flesh was flickering with a faintly discernible golden light.

Although this golden light was extremely dark, it was clearly visible.

Under this wisp of Golden Light, the newly born flesh seemed to have become even harder.

Compared to other parts of his body, this area seemed to be covered with a layer of armor.

“It must be the life Qi that has taken effect.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little excited!

Before this, Qin Yu had always had a worry.

That was, after his spiritual power recovered, would the changes to his physical body caused by the Twilight Qi be returned.

But now, it seemed that after the spiritual power was restored, the physical body would probably become even sturdier!

This instantly increased Qin Yu’s confidence!

“In other words, after my spiritual power is restored, my physical body will also become even more tyrannical,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

At that time, the mighty realm would probably not be worth mentioning.

Right at this moment, Qin Yu once again discovered a strange phenomenon.

A vague character seemed to have appeared on his forehead.

This character was extremely unclear. If one didn’t look carefully, they wouldn’t even be able to see it clearly.

Qin Yu Lay by the riverside and carefully examined it for a long time. He discovered that it seemed to be the shape of a cross.

“Cross?”Qin Yu scratched his head.

He wasn’t a religious person either. How could such a shape appear?

Qin Yu reached out his hand and tried to feel the words, but he did not feel anything.

He used clear water to wash it again, but it was useless.

The words seemed to be embedded in his flesh. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Strange.”Qin Yu scratched his head.

Sitting by the river and thinking for a moment, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Forget it, do whatever you want. I don’t feel anything anyway.”

No matter what, the life energy did bring him great benefits.

Although his spiritual power had not recovered, the changes in his body meant that Lu Guan was not lying.

“It seems that I need more life energy.”Qin Yu rubbed his chin and thought to himself.

Qin Yu only knew that the flying spider had life energy in its body.

I can only try my luck, Qin Yu thought to himself.

He was not a person who would give up easily. He immediately started searching in the Green Rock Forest, looking for traces of the flying spider.

However, Qin Yu spent a whole few days and still did not see a single flying spider.

“It really is something that can only be encountered by chance.”Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

He sat on the ground and panted slightly. No one knew what he was thinking about.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to leave Qingyan Forest secretly.

Even though there were demonic beasts here to protect them, Ling Yun and the rest would think of a countermeasure sooner or later.

Nanzhou was so big that Qin Yu didn’t believe that the Tianyun sect could cover the sky with one hand.

Furthermore, if he wanted to find the life force, he had to leave this place.

...

On the other side, under the care of the pharmacist, Ling Yun’s injuries were slowly recovering.

On the hospital bed, Ling Yun’s body was covered in bandages.

He sat there and coughed from time to time. His face was frighteningly pale.

“Young master, how are you feeling?”That Almighty walked over and asked.

Ling Yun glanced at him and didn’t answer this question. Instead, he said coldly, “Where’s Qin Yu? Did you let him escape?”

“Yes, at that time, the heavenly demon ape was chasing us. I had no choice but to take you away first,”the attendant replied honestly.

Ling Yun couldn’t help but clench his fists. He gritted his teeth and cursed under his breath, “Damn it...”

“Young master, the tracking device will be in place soon. Don’t worry, we will definitely find Qin Yu as soon as possible,”the Almighty said.

Ling Yun remained silent. No one knew what was on his cold face.

After a while, Ling Yun took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “I’m worried that Qin Yu will leave South Province.”

Even though the heavenly cloud sect was strong, it was limited to South Province.

In the entire Li Province, there were many sects that were stronger than the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Young master, don’t worry. We have already considered this problem,”the Almighty said with a smile.

Ling Yun glanced at him and gestured for him to continue.

“Young master, don’t forget that Qin Yu wasn’t the only one who crossed the void the last time. The people around him followed him to the holy region and are now in the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“If we really can’t find him, we can use this opportunity to force him to show himself.”
