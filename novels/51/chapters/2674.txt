Chapter 2675 - 2675: The Demon Eye of Death

Upon closer inspection, the index and middle fingers of his right hand had been scratched.

A clear pentagram was carved on his left palm.

As the last stroke fell, everyone present heard an inhuman roar and a wave of energy fluctuation came from his palm.

Then, it was released into the air. Almost at the same time, a strange blood moon appeared in the eternal pitch-black night sky of the Saint Kingdom.

Qin Yu could see this from his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

“Retreat! This is the Demon Eye of Death that Elder Gu Ying summoned. Leave quickly!”

Gu Yi’s expression changed drastically. A few of the elders who had seen this move changed their expressions instantly.

They frantically ran to the periphery, afraid that they would be affected.

When the others saw this scene, they also left one after another.

The blood moon was like a living thing, stacked on top of the blood moon.

It was as if there were many level eyelids fused. Each layer was as sharp as a blade, flickering with a cold light.

All of a sudden, the blood moon layers suddenly opened.

These eyelids opened one by one, revealing even deeper and more terrifying eyes.

A spinning pupil appeared in the sky, devouring everything around it like a

vortex.

The dark purple demon eye coldly watched the crowd below and the gaze finally landed on Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was instantly terrified, followed by a feeling of suffocation.

In just a glance, the air around him had been sucked dry.

A hundred meters away from Qin Yu, a level of fire burst into flames.

The ring of fire spread to the buildings on the ground and the giant trees on the mountain peak.

Everything turned into nothingness. Nothing could be left behind in the flames.

Even the ground had turned into a pool of jade-green liquid after the flames spread. It was burned by the terrifying flames.

Everyone in the area was instantly vaporized, unable to even scream.

“Samadhi True Fire! This is the first time I’ve seen such a large area of effect.”

Gu Tian’s voice trembled as he looked at the scene of the fire ring turning into nothingness.

Although he has some techniques, he and the others would probably be turned into ashes like the things in the ring of fire if they hadn’t run out of the fire ring in time.

“This Demon Eye of Death is also a powerful Order of Saint Kingdom. This is my first time seeing Elder Gu Ying use it.”

MO Wendao was also a little frightened. The strength of this power had already somewhat exceeded his imagination.

Qin Yu was currently in the middle of the Fire Fist, even though the flames had yet to burn his body.

However, he could already feel his skin melting. It was useless even if he used his Saint Power to repair it.

This kind of power was of the same origin as the Samadhi True Fire that Zi Xia had used to deal with the Evil Buddha. However, the Samadhi True Fire of this scale now was indeed much stronger than Zi Xia.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When the Samadhi True Fire surrounded Qin Yu, his eyes suddenly turned pitch-black.

The Destruction Saber in his sea of consciousness was activated again.

At this moment, an even more violent roar came from the sea of fire. An angry roar shot into the sky.

The Tiger Wing Saber slashed out with a magnificent beam, accompanied by the Saint Kingdom’s strongest Way of Destruction.

A vertical blade mark appeared on the Demon Eye of Death in the sky, and the flames that filled the sky stopped.

The Dusk Saber did not stop after cutting off the Demon Eye of Death. Instead, it slashed at Gu Ying again.

“Rise!”

Gu Ying’s expression changed drastically. The sense of death enveloped his heart. He took advantage of the situation and threw the Tai Chi Seal at the Dusk Saber.

As the saber and the seal clashed, the diagram formed by the Tai Chi Seal was cut into two.

The Tai Chi Seal suddenly split into two halves and fell to the ground. It could no longer emit any energy fluctuations.

The violent saber light directly slashed Gu Ying’s body, causing the entire valley to shake.

When the dust settled, Gu Ying was seen standing on the spot covered in blood.

His pupils were filled with a sinister look, and a sarira was emitting a dim light.

This sarira was a supreme defensive Dharma Treasure he had obtained in the Saint Kingdom. It was obtained by an eminent monk in the Saint Kingdom. If it sensed danger, it would automatically protect its master.

At this moment, the sarira was also emitting a dim light. This attack had consumed a lot of the sarira.

“What a terrifying fellow!”

MO Wendao couldn’t help but shiver as he watched the scene of destruction.

The other elders were also trembling. They did not expect this outsider who had just entered the Dao Consciousness to be so strong. “Master, aren’t we going to stop them?”

Ling’er looked at the crazy battle and couldn’t help but say.

“Valley Master Dan has already chosen Hua Tian. Gu Ying’s appearance has already explained his choice. Even if we go there, we still can’t change the overall situation.”

Xin Yue sighed softly. Her Meridian Circulation Technique made her feel even closer to Qin Yu.

Originally, she had wanted to use this period to strengthen Qin Yu’s cultivation again, but he did not expect Dan to be so domineering. He directly chose Hua Tian. No matter how strong Qin Yu was, he could not withstand the attack of a sect.

As disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley, they could only follow the Valley Master’s decision.

After all, he was the one who built the sect. Perhaps his view was more accurate.

Seeing that Xinyue had no choice, Ling’er and Jingxin revealed bitter expressions.

The two of them had interacted with Qin Yu for some time and had a good impression of him from the bottom of their hearts. This person was about to die in the hands of their fellow disciples now, yet they could not help. This feeling was extremely uncomfortable.

In addition, they were the ones who brought Qin Yu here. This made them feel even more guilty.

Qin Yu had already activated the power of the Seal of Heaven Returning. He returned to his previous state 30 seconds ago.

This was also the limit of his ability to reverse the situation. It just happened that he had made the move when he used the power of Saint Kingdom to attack Gu Ying.

However, his pupils turned a strange pitch-black. A crazy killing intent came from his sea of consciousness, wanting to kill everyone in front of him.

“Oh no! The consciousness of the Destruction Saber is gradually eroding my divine sense. Even the Seal of Heaven Returning can’t completely offset it!” Qin Yu suppressed the madness in his sea of consciousness.

When he was fighting Xin Yue’s combat avatar previously, she had advised him not to use the Order of Saint Kingdom too much. This order that was ranked at the top might continuously erode his consciousness.

This was especially the case when he was extremely weak just now after he had used all his strength to attack.

It also allowed the Order of the Saint Kingdom to find an opportunity to invade Qin Yu’s divine soul origin.

At this moment, a boundless killing intent filled his mind. If he were not careful, he would be completely reincarnated as a puppet of the Order of Saint Kingdom.

“What a strange power! I saw you die!”

Seeing Qin Yu appear again, Gu Ying was a little shocked..
