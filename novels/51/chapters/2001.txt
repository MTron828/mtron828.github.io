2002 Terrifying Air Current

If a house or some other special existence were found in a symmetrical position, it would prove Qin Yu’s guess was correct.

It was impossible to determine if it was a true Tai Chi Diagram with one’s eye because the mountains and rivers here had long been artificially altered, and even the general outline could not be accurately identified.

Just as Qin Yu was guessing, Jue Wu said with her eyes wide open, “Where’s the food you found? Where did it go?”

Qin Yu slapped his head. Only then did he remember his purpose for going out.

!!

“I’m sorry. I forgot…” Qin Yu scratched his head.

“Wait a moment. I’ll be back soon,” Qin Yu said hurriedly.

With that, Qin Yu left the place in a hurry and went into the forest again.

A moment later, Qin Yu finally caught a few medium-sized wild beasts and brought them back.

After roasting these wild beasts, Qin Yu didn’t take a single bite and gave them all to Jue Wu and the third princess.

This immediately made Jue Wu tremendously dissatisfied. She stared at the third princess from time to time, her eyes filled with killing intent.

“Eat again! How can you still eat? Stop f*cking eating!” In the end, Jue Wu couldn’t take it anymore.

She snatched the meat from the third princess’s hand and handed it to Qin Yu.

“D*mn it! Didn’t you see Qin Yu not taking a single bite? Are you a f*cking fool?!” Jue Wu cursed.

The third princess, who had always been arrogant and despotic, did not dare to say a word at this moment.

When facing Jue Wu, she had no temper at all and was very obedient.

Qin Yu shook his head helplessly. He handed the meat in his hand to the third princess and said, “I’m not hungry. Let her eat.”

When Jue Wu saw this, she could not help but mutter, “You’re just too kind. If I were to decide, I would throw her into the forest to feed the fish…”

The third princess by the side couldn’t help but tremble. She didn’t doubt Jue Wu’s words.

If Jue Wu were forced into a corner, she couldn’t be bothered if she was the third princess of the Yan family.

After eating, Qin Yu stood up and said, “Let’s set off.”

“Set off? Where to?” Jue Wu asked in puzzlement.

“Go there,” Qin Yu pointed to the opposite and said.

Before returning, Qin Yu had already memorized the coordinates of the house and deduced the coordinates of the symmetrical position.

As long as they arrived at the coordinates, they could confirm the authenticity of this idea.

Thus Jue Wu tied the third princess up again. Carrying the third princess, she followed behind Qin Yu.

This forest was quite enormous. Fortunately, they were nearby the river and thus did not take long to reach the river bank.

It was barren on the opposite shore, contrary to the lush greenery here.

Qin Yu looked across and said in a low voice, “If it’s what I’ve thought, the other side should be shady.”

“Tsk! Tsk! What a marvelous sight!” Jue Wu sighed with emotion and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He took the lead stepping into the river and walking toward the other side. Jue Wu and the third princess followed closely behind.

The river was not wide. Thus they did not take long to reach the other side.

The moment they stepped onto the opposite shore, the huge difference he had imagined did not appear. On the contrary, Qin Yu did not sense any abnormality.

“Could it be fake?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“What’s wrong?” Jue Wu asked.

“Did you notice anything unusual?” Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and asked.

Rubbing his chin, Qin Yu released his divine sense and covered most of the place.

A moment later, Jue Wu said excitedly, “Yes! There’s more food here than before!”

“Food?” Qin Yu was startled. He hurriedly released his divine sense, and soon, Qin Yu sensed something was wrong.

Although this place looked extremely desolate, there were many signs of life.

Although the other side looked full of flowers and plants, there were very few signs of life. However, it was the opposite here.

“Strange, it doesn’t make sense.” Qin Yu rubbed his chin and felt it strange.

He brought Jue Wu toward the coordinates, thinking of verifying his thoughts.

However, not long after they walked, several internal qis surged over.

Before Qin Yu could recover from his shock, a sharp blade pierced straight toward Qin Yu’s glabella!

“Watch out!” Jue Wu hurriedly shouted. She hurriedly shot out a purple light to block this attack, but it was too late!

That sharp blade was heading straight for Qin Yu’s glabella. The moment it pierced through, his divine sense would definitely be damaged!

At this critical moment, a golden blade flew out from Qin Yu’s glabella and collided with it!

“Clang!”

With a crisp sound, the sharp blade was easily cut into two by Qin Yu’s divine sense and disappeared without a trace. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Qin Yu was shocked, and his face was covered in sweat!

“That was close…” Qin Yu wiped the sweat off his forehead and raised her head vigilantly.

“Who is it!” Qin Yu shouted.

However, no one responded to Qin Yu. The internal qi in the dark was still approaching.

Qin Yu frowned. He looked at Jue Wu and said, “This place is somewhat strange. Be careful.”

...

“Mmm,” Jue Wu responded. After that, her body emitted a purple light and enveloped her. She was prepared to attack at any moment.

“Buzz!”

Right at this moment, streams of terrifying air current burst out from the ground. The speed was tremendously fast and even Qin Yu and Jue Wu failed to react in time!

Under this terrifying air current, the two were directly sent flying into the sky, and several of their bones were shattered!

The third princess was the most unlucky. Half of her body was shattered by the terrifying air current and her body was covered in blood. She looked incredibly terrifying!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He quickly stabilized his body using his internal qi.

The terrifying air current was still brewing underneath, and the next attack could erupt at any time!

At this moment, the third princess fell to the ground. She was so frightened that her face was ashen, and she even forgot the pain in her body.

“There’s something strange about this air current. We can’t withstand it at all. Let’s leave quickly!” Jue Wu hurriedly said.

Qin Yu naturally sensed something was wrong. Such a terrifying air current was not something they could resist at all!

“Buzz!”

...

The air current was brewing below and could erupt at any moment.

Once it erupted, it would be incredibly terrifying. The third princess below would be the one to bear the brunt!

“Hurry up and leave. Otherwise, I’m afraid we’ll die here!” Jue Wu saw that things were not looking good and hurriedly said.

Qin Yu lowered her head and looked at the third princess. He could not help but frown.

The third princess also came to her senses at this moment. She looked up at Qin Yu in horror and said in a trembling voice, “Save… Save me! Please save me…”

Qin Yu’s expression was tremendously ugly. If he were to turn around to save the third princess at this moment, it would be too late. He might become the meat paste punched by this air current!

“Forget about her! Hurry up and leave!” Jue Wu shouted from the side.

Qin Yu gritted her teeth and turned around to leave with Jue Wu. However, after taking a few steps, Qin Yu turned his head to look at the third princess.

“Jue Wu, you go first. I’ll come later,” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said.
