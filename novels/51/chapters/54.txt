Chapter 55: Lincheng’s Attitude Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In Dragon Paradise, Qin Yu didn’t sleep for an entire night.

After he swallowed two Qi Gathering Pills, the spiritual energy in his body rapidly expanded in his dantian.

It took an entire night for the spiritual energy of the two Qi Gathering Pills to be completely digested.

Nine o’clock in the morning, Qin Yu’s eyes snapped open!

His internal qi had been greatly enhanced, and even his state of mind was undergoing slight changes.

Cultivation not only heightened his physical strength, but also changed his state of mind.

It was said that a true almighty would even abandon his urges and desires.

Although Qin Yu had just entered the path of cultivation, his state of mind had undergone a huge change.

It was as if... he had become much more resilient than before.

“I advanced two levels all the way to level five of the Qi Refining Stage.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think to himself.

He felt an abundant amount of strength in his body, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a smile.

Advancing to the Foundation Establishment Stage was imminent!

At this moment, Lance suddenly came to Dragon Paradise.

“Mr. Qin.” Seeing Lance, Qin Yu had a guess.

“Why, does your master want to challenge me?” Qin Yu’s tone was somewhat indifferent.

Lance hurriedly shook his head and said, “No, no, no, my master heard about this matter, and specially set up a banquet to apologize to you.”

“Oh really?” This surprised Qin Yu a little.

Lincheng was actually that polite? Then why was his daughter so unruly and rude?

“My master also specially prepared a ten-year-old ginseng for you,” Lance continued.

After saying that, he took out a gift box from the car.

Qin Yu opened the gift box and saw that it was indeed a ten-year-old ginseng!

This made Qin Yu feel a little embarrassed.

Lincheng was a little too polite.

“Okay, when?” Qin Yu couldn’t refuse such a polite offer.

Lance said, “I’ll pick you up at seven tonight.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

...

In the Yan family’s manor, during this period of time, although Yan Ruoxue didn’t go out, she was in control of everything in Jiangcheng.

She held the Soul Nourishment Pill in her hand and said with a smile, “This pill is enough to defeat the Shen family.”

The secretary couldn’t help but say, “Miss, you are underestimating the Shen family...”

“I am not underestimating the Shen family.” Yan Ruoxue shook her head.

The Aqua Rhyme Pill that Qin Yu gave her last time blew her mind.

After taking that pill, Yan Ruoxue felt that her skin had become more elastic and smooth.

Even in Jingdu, Yan Ruoxue had never seen such a miraculous medicine.

“Right, send out all my bodyguards to protect Qin Yu’s safety,” Yan Ruoxue suddenly said.

The secretary was stunned. He asked in confusion, “Is someone trying to harm Qin Yu?”

Yan Ruoxue said with a nonchalant smile, “Desperate people do drastic things. No one knows what will happen when the Shen family collapses.”

“What about you?” The secretary asked with some worry.

But after asking, the secretary felt that it was a little unnecessary.

If anything happened to Yan Ruoxue, then Old Mister Yan would probably wipe out the entire Jiangcheng.

Then, the secretary followed Yan Ruoxue’s instructions and sent out the bodyguards who were responsible for secretly protecting Yan Ruoxue’s safety.

...

At night, Qin Yu followed Lance and arrived at the Lin family’s home on time.

The Lin family had set up a banquet in the courtyard early and was waiting for Qin Yu’s arrival.

“Dad, what do you mean?! He bullied your daughter, but you’re treating him to a meal and giving him gifts?” Lin Wan said angrily.

“And that ginseng! What are you giving it to him for? How valuable is it? Does he deserve it?!” Lin Wan said angrily.

Seeing this, Lincheng said helplessly, “We have something to ask him for help for. I have no choice.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Then I got beaten up for nothing!” Lin Wan said with a cold expression.

Lincheng thought for a moment and said, “How about this? After he finishes helping us, Dad will teach him a lesson for you, okay?”

“Then it’s a deal.” Lin Wan eased up a little.

Lincheng nodded and said, “Okay, okay, definitely!”

Soon, Qin Yu and Lance arrived at the Lin family home.

Seeing Qin Yu, Lincheng hurriedly walked forward and greeted him, “Mr. Qin, you are finally here!”

When he saw how polite Lincheng was, Qin Yu also said politely, “Mr. Lin, you are really too polite!”

“Quick, take your seat!” Lincheng enthusiastically pulled Qin Yu to the dining table and sat down.

Lin Wan glared at Qin Yu and slammed the chopsticks and bowls on the table.

“I lost my appetite when I saw a certain someone!” Lin Wan said sarcastically.

“Mr. Qin, I’m sorry. I spoil my daughter. Please don’t take offense,” Lincheng said with a smile.

Qin Yu said with a smile, “I don’t mind.”

Although he said that, Qin Yu could clearly feel that Lincheng had no intention of blaming Lin Wan.

The meal was nearing the end.

“Mr. Qin, actually, I looked for you this time to ask you for a favor,” Lincheng said with a smile.

Hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly understood.

No wonder Lincheng was so polite. It turned out that he had a favor to ask.

“Since I’ve accepted your gift Mr. Lin, feel free to ask,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

Lincheng hurriedly told Qin Yu the whole story.

After Qin Yu heard it, he said in a sullen voice, “Mr. Lin, why don’t you participate in it yourself?”

Before Lincheng could say anything, Lin Wan sneered as she said, “Do you have trouble understanding people? It’s a disciple competition. My dad can’t participate. Otherwise, why would he need you?”

Qin Yu ignored Lin Wan. He thought for a moment and said, “Okay, I promise you.”

Qin Yu naturally couldn’t take other people’s things for free.

“Thank you very much!” Lincheng raised his wine glass and said with a smile.

“Uncle Lin!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from outside.

They saw a young man in his twenties standing at the door.

This young man was tall and handsome, like a heartthrob straight out of a movie.

Seeing this young man, Lin Wan got up and ran over excitedly.

“Qi Yang, why are you here?” Lin Wan threw herself into the young man’s arms.

The young man called Qi Yang said with a smile, “I heard that Uncle Lin is going to have a martial arts competition with the Zheng family, so my dad asked me to help Uncle Lin.”

Hearing this, Lincheng immediately got up and said with a smile, “Qi Yang, I appreciate your kindness, but... the Zheng family isn’t easy to deal with. I heard that they invited an expert.”

Qi Yang said with a nonchalant smile, “Don’t worry, Uncle Lin. I already developed inner strength a month ago.”

Lincheng was stunned, and then he said excitedly, “Is what you said true?”

“Of course, I’m at inner strength level one,” Qi Yang said with some excitement.

“Oh, that’s great!” Lincheng walked forward enthusiastically and held Qi Yang’s hand.

“What a promising young man! What a promising young man! To have inner strength at the age of twenty, you’re definitely a genius!”

At this time, Lin Wan suddenly ran to Qin Yu and said arrogantly, “Qi Yang is here. We don’t need a good-for-nothing like you. You can get lost now!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He didn’t say anything but looked at Lincheng.

However, to Qin Yu’s surprise, Lincheng also smiled and said, “She is right. Since Qi Yang is here, I won’t trouble you.”
