Chapter 836: Wan Guqiong’s Intentions

The man in the portrait had a tall and straight figure, and his long hair was as black as ink. Even though it was just a portrait, it gave off an extremely oppressive feeling.

However, what was presented in the portrait was a back view.

However, it was this back view that made Qin Yu widen his eyes!

It was because this person was extremely familiar to Qin Yu. That sense of familiarity made Qin Yu nearly tremble!

He raised his head and suddenly looked at Wan Guqiong while saying, “Only the back view?”

“Yes. It’s already very rare to have a back view.” Wan Guqiong spread his hands and said.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely complicated. The shock on his face made Wan Guqiong rather puzzled.

“What’s wrong with you?” Wan Guqiong asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu shook his head and tried his best to ease his emotions while saying, “I’m fine.”

Wan Guqiong said tentatively, “If there’s a chance, you can go to my house and take a look.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu quickly nodded.

He went back to the sofa and sat down, a little absent-minded. Xiao Yuan handed Qin Yu a bottle of wine, but Qin Yu ignored him.

Qin Yu’s heart was full of shock.

The reason was because the Guardian was too similar to his father. They were too similar!

“Could it be... that the Guardian is my father?” Qin Yu muttered softly.

If that was really the case, Qin Yu didn’t know whether to be happy or sad.

He was happy that his father was still alive. He was sad that he had never come to visit him.

“It’s really lively today. Even though it’s snowing heavily, it can’t stop everyone’s enthusiasm,” Kong Yun said to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded to him and said perfunctorily, “Yes.”

Kong Yun continued, “Qin Yu, my father has something to say to you. What do you think?”

“Your father? The famous Kong Luo?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“Yes. Although I don’t know why, but my father mentioned it.” Kong Yun nodded slightly.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment.

If he wanted to officially declare war with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, he would need the support of these people.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu agreed, “Okay, but it will take some time.”

“No worries, you can decide the time.” Kong Yun waved his hand.

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded and agreed.

“The four young masters of Jingdu is here.” At this moment, Kong Yun couldn’t help but snort softly.

Looking over, he saw four beautifully dressed young men walk in.

“Who are the four young masters of Jingdu?” Qin Yu asked, somewhat puzzled.

“It’s a title a group of self-righteous second generation heirs in Jingdu gave themselves,” Kong Yun said coldly.

Kong Yun seemed to be very disgusted at the mention of the four young masters of Jingdu.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Why? Have they offended you before?”

“That’s not it. I just can’t stand their attitude,” Kong Yun said.

“These people don’t take martial artists like us seriously. If it weren’t for the law, I would have killed them long ago.”

Qin Yu smiled helplessly. He didn’t care much about these people, nor was he interested.

As long as they didn’t provoke him, he didn’t care what they thought.

As more and more people came, many martial artists also gathered at Qin Yu’s table.

Everyone was chatting fervently, and most of the discussions were related to martial arts.

Qin Yu saw that the time was right, so he said, “Everyone, do you know where you can get top-notch herbs? Or what way?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Top-notch herbs?” Yao Meng continued.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “The older the better. If it’s more than ten thousand years old, that would be the best.”

“Herbs that are more than ten thousand years old are a little difficult. Any one of them is enough to attract all the major factions,” someone said.

“That’s right. Even the major clans don’t have many of them.”

“Those are life-saving items. Any one of those ten-thousand-year-old herbs might be able to bring people back to life.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly when he heard this.

It seemed that it wasn’t so easy to find ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

“Qin Yu, you can go and try the exchange meeting,” said Wan Guqiong at this moment.

“Exchange meeting? What is that?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Wan Guqiong looked at everyone and said, “Now that the Mystic Realm is public, I have no need to hide it from everyone.”

Everyone looked at Wan Guqiong in unison, waiting for him to continue.

Wan Guqiong said, “There are many Mystic Realms in this world, and those who have Mystic Realms are mostly martial arts aristocratic families that have been around for countless years. Generally speaking, their heritage is extremely strong.”

“For the current world, ten-thousand-year-old herbs are indeed extremely rare, but for Mystic Realms, although ten-thousand-year-old herbs are equally precious, they aren’t irreplaceable.”

“If you have any top-notch treasures, perhaps you can take them to the exchange meeting and use them to exchange.”

Before Qin Yu could say anything, Xiao Yuan, who was at the side, asked, “Then where is this exchange meeting? And how should we participate?”

Wan Guqiong smiled, “I won’t lie to you. The exchange meet is organized by the aristocratic families of the various Mystic Realms, and the Wan family is one of the organizers.”

“As for the location of the exchange meet, it is naturally in a Mystic Realm.”

“After all, the exchange meet has a lot of treasures and takes place in a Mystic Realm, so there aren’t many spots. I only have four. As for how to distribute them, I haven’t thought it through.”

Xiao Yuan smiled faintly and said, “Brother Wan, there’s no need to keep us in suspense. Just tell us, how can we exchange for a spot?”

Wan Guqiong glanced at everyone and said, “I, Wan Guqiong, am not a philanthropist. If you want a spot, you naturally have to exchange it with a treasure.”

“Whoever brings enough treasures will be able to obtain a spot. Everyone will compete fairly.”

Everyone fell into silence, but they were filled with excitement.

Ever since the appearance of the Mystic Realm, the resources of the various martial families seemed to be quite scarce in comparison.

“When is the exact time?” Qin Yu asked.

Wan Guqiong smiled faintly and said, “Three days later. Three days later, we will set off.”

Upon hearing this, everyone said, “Alright. Within three days, we will definitely present the treasures.”

Qin Yu was also secretly calculating inside.

Treasures? Although he had quite a number of them, it seemed that not many of them were presentable.

And the opponents they were facing were all the top princes of the various aristocratic families. They definitely had quite a number of treasure in their hands.

“Brother Qin, can we talk in private?” At this moment, Wan Guqiong suddenly walked to Qin Yu’s side.

Qin Yu didn’t refuse. He followed behind Wan Guqiong and walked to the side.

Wan Guqiong said with a faint smile, “Brother Qin, you definitely want to get a spot, right?”

Qin Yu didn’t hide it and said with a bitter smile, “Who wouldn’t want to get a spot like this?”

Wan Guqiong said indifferently, “Actually, you have a treasure on you that is enough to attract me. As long as you are willing to take it out, not to mention a spot, I can even give you a ten-thousand-year-old herb.”

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly, and his expression instantly turned cold.

He had already guessed what Wan Guqiong wanted.
