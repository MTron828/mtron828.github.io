Chapter 1553: Chapter 1,553, the old man’s identity Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu was startled and said with some surprise, “Senior, have you heard of me?”

“No.”The old man shook his head.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

You F * cking haven’t heard of me, why are you asking.

The old man stroked his beard and looked at Qin Yu, saying indifferently, “Your alchemy skills are not bad, and your comprehension ability is also good. Such talent is enough to go to the central plains and become a top alchemist.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile, “Being an alchemist is not my wish.”

“Oh? Then what kind of person do you want to be?”The old man said with some surprise.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s eyes couldn’t help but flash with a trace of determination.

He looked into the distance and said in a low voice, “I want to become a man who can shake everything in the world. A man who can make everyone stay by my side. A man who can cross the void and defy the heavens and change fate!”

The old man could not help but laugh when he heard Qin Yu’s ambitious words.

“You want to become a great cultivator of the tribulation transcending stage? Do you know how long it has been since a great cultivator of the tribulation transcending stage appeared in the Holy Region?”The old man shook his head and said.

“Man makes things. As long as you don’t die, anything is possible,”Qin Yu said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

The old man laughed and said, “Good, not bad. I’m looking forward to the arrival of that day.”

......

At this point, the old man put away his beast spirit pill formula. He then looked at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “If you have the chance in the future, you can look for me in the Holy Region. My name is Dan Sheng.”

At this moment, Qin Yu did not know the weight of the word Dan Sheng, so he was not too surprised.

He looked at Dan Sheng, cupped his hands and said, “Good. If you have the chance in the future, I will definitely visit senior.”

The old man didn’t say anything more and turned around to leave.

Qin Yu originally wanted to ask about the nine great families, but unfortunately, the old man disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye.

“Senior?”Qin Yu looked around and called out tentatively.

Unfortunately, the surroundings were empty. Other than Qin Yu’s voice, there was nothing else.

‘He left quite quickly,’Qin Yu thought to himself.

He couldn’t help but feel a little excited. No matter what, he had obtained the Beast Spirit Pill formula, and it was a free whoring.

When the day came when the war broke out, Qin Yu could take out the beast spirit pill and supply it to all the cultivators in the South Province.

More importantly, Qin Yu could also take the Beast Spirit Pill.

His body was already strong, but after taking the Beast Spirit Pill, he didn’t know how strong he would become.

“Oh no!”

At this moment, Qin Yu slapped his head and suddenly thought of something!

That Dan Sheng was very strong, and he came from the Central Province. Most importantly, he was very likely to be a powerful alchemist!

Such a person might know how to break the curse of the Nirvana body!

“Damn it, I actually forgot about this!”Qin Yu felt extremely vexed.

However, that old man walked too fast. Qin Yu was full of questions, and before he had the chance to ask, he had already left this place.

“Sigh, I can only find another way,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He turned around and returned to the room, thinking of the bronze coffin.

Then, Qin Yu took out the bronze coffin and placed it in front of him.

The coffin was covered in rust. It was obvious that it had been there for a long time. The entire coffin was simple and unadorned. There was nothing special about it. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Then, Qin Yu placed his hand on the coffin. He tried to detect a trace of internal Qi from the coffin, trying to detect something.

Unfortunately, after Qin Yu’s repeated inspection, he did not detect anything unusual on the coffin.

“Looks like it’s just an ordinary coffin,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He originally thought that the coffin that carried the body of a divine body at the reversion void stage was not simple, but he did not expect it to be so ordinary.

Qin Yu did not think any further. He opened the coffin and a male corpse appeared in front of Qin Yu.

This male corpse had a broad and slender body. His appearance was extremely handsome. His long hair was scattered on both sides, and it was unexpectedly soft and smooth.

The entire corpse was extremely well preserved. Not a single scar could be seen on his entire body.

If Qin Yu didn’t know his origins, he would even suspect that this male corpse was still alive.

“He directly wiped out his divine sense. How terrifying,”Qin Yu sighed.

He tried to exert his strength, wanting to test the toughness of this male corpse.

As Qin Yu’s strength increased, this body also began to display his rigidity.

When Qin Yu used 80% of his strength, this male corpse was still intact.

“As expected of a divine body, it really lives up to its reputation!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

The toughness of this body was extremely terrifying. Although Qin Yu was only testing it out slightly, the toughness still shocked Qin Yu!

“I really want to compete with him,”Qin Yu said in a low voice in his heart.

This made Qin Yu start to look forward to the day when iron egg recovered.

At this time, the sky was already dark. Qin Yu didn’t want to waste any more time. He put away the bronze coffin and planned to rush to the hunter organization under the cover of the night.

Therefore, Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle and headed straight for the hunter organization.

This place was not far from the hunter organization. With the flying speed of the Divine Eagle, it would only take a few hours to reach the hunter organization.

Sitting on the back of the Godly Eagle, Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly.

In his hand, he was playing with a beast spirit pill. He really wanted to swallow this beast spirit pill and feel its power.

But in the end, Qin Yu held back and put away the Beast Spirit Pill.

At this moment, the godly eagle began to descend.

Qin Yu opened his eyes and looked down.

The hunter organization was as usual. There were people everywhere.

Many people came to this place and issued missions to the hunter organization.

Qin Yu put away the divine eagle and walked quickly toward the hunter organization.

The Hunter in charge of receiving missions couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you really came,”the hunter said in surprise.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

The hunter said in surprise, “You don’t Know?”

“Know what?”Qin Yu suddenly had a bad premonition.

The hunter sighed and said, “Not long ago, Jing Bai and his men planned to steal the white bone club and rebel against Zhong Wu. Unfortunately, they were discovered by Zhong Wu and are now locked in the dungeon.”

Qin Yu’s face changed and exclaimed, “What? Jing Bai was captured?”

“Not just Jing Bai, even Guan Zhuang has been arrested,”the hunter continued.

“Of course, there are also people who say that Zhong Wu deliberately framed him. Because Jing Bai has always looked down on Zhong Wu, and he is a more straightforward person, Zhong Wu has long wanted to get rid of him.”

At this point, the hunter moved forward and whispered, “In the hunter organization, stealing the white bone club is a serious crime, so the possibility of being framed is very high!”

Qin Yu’s face was gloomy. He looked at the hunter coldly and said, “Where are Jing Bai and the others imprisoned?”

“In the dungeon ahead.”The hunter pointed in the direction.
