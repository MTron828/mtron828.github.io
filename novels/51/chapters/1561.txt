Chapter 1562: Chapter 1,562, the furious Xiao Hai 1 

Wen Wanji had once said that he wanted to let Qin Yu’s physical body enter the reversion void stage.

Although Qin Yu’s body was already tough enough, there was still a certain gap between him and someone at the reversion void stage.

If he used this magical artifact to temper his body, it would be perfect.

“Qin Yu, are you... really okay?”Jing Bai asked from the side.

Qin Yu’s body was bleeding profusely, which made people worried.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I’m fine.”

Then, Qin Yu looked at Jing Bai and the others and said, “You’ve tried this array. It’s not difficult to protect the hunter organization. I’ll leave first.”

Jing Bai and the others still wanted to keep Qin Yu, but they knew that Qin Yu had more important things to do, so they nodded and agreed.

After saying goodbye to everyone, Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle and rushed toward the northern border.

The northern land was very far from the Green Rock Forest.

One was in the northernmost part, and the other was in the southernmost part.

Even with the Divine Eagle, Qin Yu would need at least a week to arrive.

......

High Up in the sky, Qin Yu looked down.

He saw with his own eyes the people of the northern land burning, killing, and plundering. He saw the cultivators of the southern region rise up in resistance. He also saw countless people lying in pools of blood.

Qin Yu’s expression was incomparably cold, but he did not make a move.

Because he knew very well in his heart that doing so would only be treating the symptoms and not the root cause.

Only by eliminating the northern lands could this matter be resolved from the root cause.

Qin Yu sat on the Divine Eagle with his eyes slightly closed, absorbing the threads of spiritual Qi from the sky.

Although the current Qin Yu was only at the early-stage of the mighty figure, he was not much inferior to the peak of the mighty figure.

As long as he didn’t encounter anyone at the reversion void stage, the current Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of anyone.

...

At the northern border.

This place had already been completely turned into a battlefield. Corpses littered the ground and blood flowed like a river.

Xiao Hai led everyone and fought with all their might, killing countless northern cultivators.

At this moment, Xiao Hai was coldly looking in the direction of the northern lands.

In the middle was a huge river. This river was the famous Dead Sea, and no one could cross it.

On the other side of the Dead Sea, Sima Bei was looking at Xiao Hai from afar.

And standing beside Sima Bei were Yong Ji and his many adopted sons.

“Xiao Hai, do you think that you alone can resist us?”Sima bei said coldly.

“Currently, there are already four people from the three madmen and three absolutes of the northern lands who have arrived in the northern lands. With just a legend like you, do you think you can beat a rock with an egg? !”

Xiao Hai’s expression was cold, but he knew that he was the only one supporting the entire northern border.

“Yong Ji, you despicable person,”Xiao Hai said coldly.

Yong Ji placed his hands behind his back, he smiled faintly and said, “Despicable? When it comes to cultivation, how can there be anything despicable? The northern lands has an even more powerful spell. I only made the right choice. Do I have to be like you, risking my life for a bunch of unrelated people? “In my opinion, you’re the Idiot!”

Xiao hai shouted, “Yong Ji, do you dare to fight me?”

Yong ji laughed out loud, “Xiao Hai, if you have the ability, then cross the Dead Sea. I’ll fight you!”

“Despicable scoundrel!”

Xiao Hai suddenly let out an angry roar. A terrifying qi energy directly crossed the Dead Sea and headed straight for Yong Ji!

Yong Ji couldn’t help but have a shocked expression. He hurriedly attacked and faced this dragon-like internal Qi!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, Xiao Hai’s furious roar vanished into thin air.

However, this still made Yong Ji feel shocked!

He lowered his head to look at his palm and felt a tinge of numbness on his palm.

One had to know that this was only Xiao Hai’s furious roar! If he were to face Xiao Hai directly, his chances of winning would be extremely low!

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes slightly and a trace of anger suddenly rose in his heart.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that among the legends of the three lunatics and three absolutes, no one was weaker than him!

Sima bei seemed to have seen through Yong Ji’s thoughts. He said indifferently, “No matter. After you cultivate the complete sacred heart technique, this Xiao Hai is not worth mentioning.”

Yong Ji looked at Sima bei and said, “Are you his opponent?”

Sima bei narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “In the entire South Province, I’m not afraid of anyone.”

“Then why don’t you cross the Dead Sea and kill Xiao Hai? As long as Xiao Hai dies, wouldn’t the South Province Be Yours?”Yong Ji coldly questioned.

Sima bei was not angry. He placed his hands behind his back and indifferently said, “My main body can not leave the north for the time being. My clone is unable to defeat Xiao Hai. Otherwise, why would I spend so much effort to rope you guys in?”

Yong Ji frowned slightly. He turned around and looked at the frozen snow land behind him. In the middle of the frozen snow land, there was a huge snow mountain.

And the one sleeping under the snow mountain was the master of the northern lands.

“The master of the northern lands... does he really exist?”Yong Ji took a deep breath.

The moment these words were said, SIMA BEI’s expression instantly became extremely cold.

This caused the already cold northern lands to suddenly become violent.

Yong Ji’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly explained, “I don’t have any other intentions...”

Sima bei coldly said, “No one is allowed to question the master of the northern lands.”

“En, I understand.”Yong Ji nodded.

Across the shore, Xiao Hai became even angrier.

He clenched his fists tightly, and his teeth clenched so tightly that they made cracking sounds.

“Senior Xiao Hai, when the northern lands launch the next round of attacks, I’m afraid we won’t be able to hold on any longer,”someone beside him said.

Xiao Hai’s expression was also quite grave.

The Heavenly Cloud sect had already pulled him back, and Jue Wu had also left the northern border due to her physical condition.

Right now, Xiao Hai was the only one left struggling to hold on in the vast northern border.

“I’m afraid that the northern lands will send out Yong Ji, Baro, and Feng Hai next time,”someone beside him said with a sigh.

“These three people are all top-notch in the southern region. I’m afraid that you won’t be able to hold on by yourself.”

Xiao Hai said coldly, “Just let them do what they want. I, Xiao Hai, have nothing to fear.”

After saying this, Xiao Hai turned around and returned to the room.

In the room, Xiao Hai was squinting his eyes slightly. His palm was shaking in the air. Streams of faint light moved along with his palm.

No one knew what Xiao Hai was doing. They could only see him frowning from time to time, and breaking out in cold sweat from time to time.

“Senior Xiao Hai, what are you doing?”

Finally, someone could not help but ask. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xiao Hai slowly opened his eyes. He wiped the sweat off his forehead and said, “Deducing a spell.”

“Spell?”The few of them looked at each other.

Xiao Hai did not explain further. He just closed his eyes again.

This time, he closed his eyes for three whole days.

Three days later, someone suddenly ran in anxiously from outside.

“Senior Xiao Hai, it’s bad! The people of the northern lands are here!”

Hearing this, Xiao Hai suddenly opened his eyes.

“Just as we expected, the ones who attacked this time are Yong Ji Baro, Feng Hai, and the other two!”The person at the door said anxiously.

Xiao Hai did not show any fear. He suddenly stood up and said coldly, “Just in time. Today, I will kill the three of them!”
