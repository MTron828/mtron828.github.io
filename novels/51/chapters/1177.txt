Chapter 1178: Chapter 1,178, the tomb of the saint 

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I’ve heard a little about it, but I don’t know much about it.”

Hearing this, Lu Guan realized that his chance to show off had come.

He put his hands behind his back and said proudly, “Then you’ve asked the right person. The Yan family of the Holy Region is one of the nine great aristocratic families of the holy region. It’s one of the top families in the entire Holy Region!”

“And I happen to have some friendship with them,”Lu Guan said indifferently.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Really? You... are only at the advanced stage of the Martial Saint Realm. Do you have any friendship with the top families of the Holy Region?”

When Lu Guan heard this, he immediately became unhappy.

He said with a dark face, “Although I am at the advanced stage of the Martial Saint Realm, I have a lot of connections. What can you do about it?”

Qin Yu sized up Lu Guan with a face full of suspicion. It was obvious that he did not believe him.

Lu Guan was anxious. He stared at Qin Yu and said, “You don’t believe me? Fine, I’ll tell you something that you’ve never heard of.”

“The Yan family recently found a wandering princess of the Yan family. It’s said that she’s a descendant of the Yan family who has a complete bloodline! Now, she has an extremely high position in the Yan family. She’s even been considered as a candidate for the position of family head!”

Lu Guan paused and smiled faintly. “To be honest, I have a good relationship with her.”

Qin Yu was sure that this idiot was lying.

“The person you are talking about is called Yan Ruoxue, right?”Qin Yu asked.

Lu Guan was stunned and asked in surprise, “How do you know?”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “That’s my wife.”

“Hahahaha!”

Lu Guan couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“She’s your wife? Look at you. Are you worthy of her? You’re quite a braggart,”Lu Guan sneered.

Qin Yu smiled. “It seems that you don’t know my wife. Since You’re friends with her, don’t you know where she went to the sanctum?”

“I don’t care where she went. She Won’t like you, understand?”Lu Guan snorted.

Qin Yu didn’t bother to explain to Lu Guan. After all, it had nothing to do with him.

Soon, Qin Yu and the others arrived at the square.

At this time, there were several carefully selected elites of the heaven gate standing in the square. Besides them, Qin Yu also called Chang Mang.

“They are all elites of the Heaven Gate. Now that they are working for you, you must bring them to the holy region later,”Qin Yu warned.

Lu Guan ignored Qin Yu. He walked up to them and said calmly, “It is your honor to serve me. Perform well. If you do well, I will give you a chance.”

Hearing this, everyone was overjoyed. They looked at Qin Yu gratefully.

“Okay, let’s go,”Lu Guan said.

Qin Yu led everyone to their destination.

On the way, Chang Mang asked, “Is he from the Holy Region? He doesn’t look like much. I feel like I can kill him with one punch.”

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “Who knows? Maybe he’s just a small fry from the holy region.”

Chang mang muttered, “Looking at his pretentious look, I’m full of anger.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Qin Yu patted Chang Mang’s shoulder and said, “Brother, bear with it.”

The group headed straight for the Green Earth Park.

After spending some time, they entered the Green Earth Park.

“The thing you want is here?”Qin Yu could not help but be a little surprised when he saw the Green Earth Park.

Lu Guan Glanced at Qin Yu and said, “What else? You natives have poor eyesight. Naturally, you can’t understand the mysteries of this place.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He had noticed this place a long time ago, but he hadn’t come to explore it.

He had planned to bring his handlebar mustache to take a look, but the handlebar mustache hadn’t appeared since the last time they parted.

“Okay, I’m going to start the ceremony now. Everyone, watch carefully!”Lu Guan floated in the air and chanted a spell.

The flags that were planted in several places suddenly shone brightly as if they were summoning something.

“Rumble...”

Soon, the ground began to collapse and the ground cracked as if something was about to emerge from the ground.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt an extremely strong murderous aura. This murderous aura penetrated straight into his bones and was extremely uncomfortable.

“Step back!”Qin Yu hurriedly shouted when he saw this.

He raised his palm and a ray of light gathered above everyone’s heads to block this baleful aura.

The earth was still rumbling. This seemed to be a long process.

After a full half an hour, a complete mass grave suddenly rose from the ground!

The mass grave’s scale was extremely grand. It was like a palace. The entire palace flickered with golden colored light, and threads of terrifying killing intent spread out from it.

This huge tomb extended thousands of meters into the distance, covering the entire Green Earth Park!

Facing this huge tomb, everyone felt an intense pressure!

It seemed to be a killing pit. Large pits appeared one after another on the ground, and each pit emitted extreme dark energy.

Even the experienced and knowledgeable Qin Yu was greatly shocked when he saw this huge tomb!

The scale of this huge grave was even larger than the one Qin Yu had seen in the immortal slaying sect!

Numerous Daoist halls were displayed in front of everyone. Each Daoist Hall was engraved with extremely strange characters.

“No wonder the Green Earth Park was stopped back then. With such a huge grave, it would be strange if ordinary people didn’t die,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

It was no wonder that the feng shui masters couldn’t see it. After all, even a cultivator like Qin Yu couldn’t see the complete grave here.

“Holy tomb, it is indeed the holy tomb!”Lu Guan was extremely excited and kept shouting!

He shot backward and arrived in front of Qin Yu and the others.

“What’s the origin of this tomb?”Qin Yu asked.

Lu Guan Glanced at Qin Yu and snorted, “Kid, listen carefully. This is called the holy tomb! The tomb of a Saint!”
