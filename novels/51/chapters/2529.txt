2530 Three Great Experts

After which, it ruthlessly crashed into the edge. Lava surged high up, forming a rain of fire permeating the sky, and a massive vacuum formed where Qin Yu was.

A flame hovered in the air, its immense divine thought emitting incredible emotions.

“You actually discovered me?”

“Not only discovering you, but I will also kill you completely.”

Feeling the immense power of the soul, Qin Yu did not hide the killing intent on his face.

The Flame Demon’s body in the air was frantically trying to come to the rescue but was held back by the Heart of the Ocean.

“Go to hell! God-slaying Dusk!”

Qin Yu stabbed Evil Eye into the ground, and a terrifying shockwave swept out.

The massive flame seemed to have sensed the danger and expanded thousands of times.

The violent power of flames firmly resisted the shockwave. Even though the life force of his true body was incredibly formidable, the flames were like a candle in the wind in the face of the suffocating shockwave of the power of destruction and the Yellow Springs combined.

“Buzz!”

Evil Eye touched the true body of the flame, and just as Qin Yu was about to destroy the soul of Chief of Flame completely…

The ground, where the true body of Chief of Flame was, suddenly trembled.

A tall giant suddenly appeared, and a destructive power slammed toward Evil Eye.

“You’re courting death!”

Qin Yu flew into a rage and activated the power of the God-slaying Dusk to the extreme.

Numerous wounds appeared on the giant hand, but its defensive power was tremendously shocking.

Even though the God-slaying Dusk managed to cut off the arm in the end, its power was also exhausted.

A black vortex appeared between the giant and Chief of Flame. It then pulled them in.

Qin Yu felt something and looked at a place 100,000 meters away.

The Chief of Flame and the giant appeared at that place. A man beside them attracted Qin Yu’s attention.

This person had a slender yet robust physique, a tall build, and a peculiar countenance featuring sharp eyes, a pointed chin, and slightly elongated ears. Especially striking were the two enormous black dragon wings, exuding a formidable dragon aura

He did not seem to want to fight with Qin Yu. He only glanced at Qin Yu and left with the other two monster race living beings.

“What a terrifying spatial manipulation ability. It can even take away this giant and Chief of Flame. What species within the monster race is this fellow?”

Qin Yu turned his head and asked Elder Guai.

“Deathwing Draco, the monster race’s Godly King of Death. During the previous war, this demonic dragon’s pair of draconic wings claimed countless lives, and its comprehension of the Way of Space has reached profound depths.”

Elder Guai was from the previous year of the Path of Heaven. He thus immediately recognized this infamous demonic dragon.

“What a pity! I was so close to understanding Chief of Flame!”

Qin Yu sighed. Those flame spirits would reproduce rapidly as long as the Chief of Flame was around. He was not satisfied with this battle outcome.

“No choice. The monster race has two great experts. The giant who intercepted your sword strike is Titan, the mightiest of the giant race. Both his defense and strength are terrifying.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

A Death Godly King, a Titan Giant, and the Flame Demon King. It was tough to take the Flame Demon King’s life by force. Elder Guai sighed to himself.

“That’s strange. Our visit to this area this time was impromptu. The three monster race powerhouses can’t be coincidentally nearby, right?”

A hint of vigilance flashed across Qin Yu’s heart. Could it be that they had eyed on Human Race Watch?

Otherwise, it would be hard to explain. Now, the various large factions of the human race had gone to many places to fight, and there was no lack of powerful factions among them.

For example, the alliance of eight great forces, four sects, four schools, two saints, and the alliance of the various large guilds, all of which had many powerful cultivators.

How could the alien race eye on the Human Race Watch and ignore the others?

It was indeed strange for three experts to appear here at one go.

“Sweep through the bodies of these flame spirits, extract the demonic crystals from them, and immediately retreat.”

Qin Yu quickly gave the order. The demonic crystals on these flame spirits contained formidable demonic power. Even humans could not absorb this energy.

However, it could be used as an energy supply for formations or refining weapons and medicine.

It was something that Ji Yue had specially instructed, so he could not waste it.

A transparent spirit body as graceful as a young maiden suddenly descended, and the Heart of the Ocean landed before him.

“Senior Juan Liu?”

Qin Yu cupped his fists and said. The Heart of the Ocean had saved his life several times.

At this moment, facing the artifact spirit within, Qin Yu dared not be negligent.

“Before Gu Ning passed, she casually handed me over to you. You didn’t cultivate the water cultivation method in the first place, and thus it wouldn’t benefit me. Logically speaking, I shouldn’t have appeared. But this time, I felt the aura of my long-standing enemy, so I woke up. With my current strength, it’s difficult for me to fight against Chief of Flame. If you can kill Chief of Flame, I will do my best to help you for a hundred years.”

Juan Liu said softly. After saying that, her spirit body disappeared into the Heart of the Ocean again.

“Senior, please hold on. How can I extract the source of the poison?”

Qin Yu suddenly thought of Gu Ning’s terrifying weapon in the Azure Rock Forest and quickly called the weapon spirit.

“You’re quite arrogant. Gu Ning paid a high price for it previously, so I helped her condense a small bottle of source of poison. Heaven and earth hated this poison. If you want to obtain it, show me your sincerity first.”

The descendant of the God of Water, Juan Liu, sneered and then disappeared into the Heart of the Ocean without further responding.

“How is she an artifact spirit? She’s indeed a granny, and her tone is even more arrogant than Immortal Emperor Yao in the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes!”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. He was not afraid of Flame Demon.

However, the Flame Demon was probably on its guard now. Moreover, the Spatial Godly King and the Titan were by its side. It would not be so easy to kill it.

However, when he thought of the terrifying power of the source of poison, Qin Yu’s heart still burned with passion.

Not long after, the demonic crystals on the bodies of the flame spirits were extracted.

“Qin Yu, should we continue to go deeper into this Demon Flame Forest or retreat first and find a new place to train?”

Elder Guai frowned and asked. The appearance of the Death Godly King and Giant Titan made him feel a little uneasy.

“It’s fine. We’ll continue to go deeper and wipe out all the remaining living beings of the monster race before leaving. These three shouldn’t dare to disturb us.”

Qin Yu said after hesitating for a moment.

The remaining living beings here almost posed no threat to them. They could take this opportunity to continue refining the combat coordination of this group of cultivators.

This scale of battle was relatively rare. With the strength of Gu Wanqing and the others, they should not have been in such a sorry state just now.

However, they were fighting individually. Therefore, they were suppressed when they were surrounded by flame spirits weaker than them. If it wasn’t for the joint attack of the Demon-slaying Peak, their lives would have been in danger.

The group split into nearly 20 small teams and attacked from different directions.
