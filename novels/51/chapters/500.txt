Chapter 501: Martial Marquis! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When he felt the killing intent from Gu Canghai’s body, Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly!

This was a true Martial Marquis! It was also the strongest opponent Qin Yu had ever met!

It was said that after stepping into the Martial Marquis realm, one would enter another level.

It was impossible to rely on the power of a half-step Martial Marquis to defeat a Martial Marquis!

Moreover, Qin Yu had not stepped into the true half-step Martial Marquis realm yet!

“I will cripple your dantian and let Young Master Han kill you personally!” Gu Canghai said coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression became more and more serious.

There was only one thought inside, and that was to escape!

Therefore, Qin Yu immediately used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique to escape.

However, when Qin Yu rushed to the window, he was bounced back by an extremely strong force!

“Do you think you can escape?!” Gu Canghai’s body was full of murderous intent as he laughed coldly.

“Oh no, I miscalculated!” Qin Yu’s expression immediately turned ugly!

Gu Canghai had set up a formation, so there was no way he could escape!

“F * ck!” Qin Yu cursed inside. He immediately summoned the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist and smashed it towards that level of barrier.

However, this was something that Martial Marquis had personally set up. No matter how strong Qin Yu was, he couldn’t break it!

“You can’t escape,” Gu Canghai sneered. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Qin Yu felt alarmed.

He took a deep breath and said coldly, “Gu Canghai, if you can’t kill me today, I will fight the Saint Confucian Sect to the death!”

“Hahahaha!” Gu Canghai couldn’t help but laugh.

“With just you? Do you think you have a chance to leave this place?” Gu Canghai said coldly.

As Gu Canghai spoke, he had already raised his hand!

A hollow palm rose up out of thin air and slammed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately used the Saintly Body Technique and raised his hand to meet it!

“Boom!”

However, a Martial Marquis’s strength was too powerful and it sent Qin Yu flying!

The golden light on his body was shattered, and his body suffered a violent impact!

“Serves you right!” Seeing this, Elder Qu sneered at the side.

“You want to take my life? Are you even worthy?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He struggled to get up from the ground, and the unease inside of him grew more and more intense.

Gu Canghai’s strength was beyond imagination. In front of him, Qin Yu was practically powerless!

‘If I step into the true half-step Martial Marquis realm, I might have a chance to survive,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

He gritted his teeth and golden light burst out from his entire body. His internal qi quickly rose to the limit!

At the same time, the center of Qin Yu’s brows also lit up with the light of the Divine Dragon Power!

Facing Gu Canghai, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. He used all his trump cards and planned to fight to the death!

“What? You want to resist?” Gu Canghai sneered.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Cut the crap. Everyone says that a Martial Marquis is unparallelled. Today, I also want to see how strong a Martial Marquis is.”

“Is that so?” Gu Canghai’s lips curled into a sneer.

“Okay, then I will satisfy you!”

After saying that, Gu Canghai casually raised his hand and slapped forward!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent. With a furious roar, the energy in his entire body erupted at this moment, and his Saintly Body Technique stepped into the fifth level!

A resplendent golden light illuminated the entire room!

“Ah!!!”

Qin Yu exerted all his strength to face Gu Canghai’s palm head-on!

“Boom!”

This was a huge collision, and a terrifying internal qi rippled out in all directions!

Even Elder Qu felt an extremely strong pressure at this moment, and even his breathing became labored!

“Bang!”

Under Gu Canghai’s palm strike, all the light on Qin Yu’s fist disappeared, and his body took a few steps back!

“Pu!”

The huge impact hit his internal organs.

Qin Yu tasted blood in his throat, and he spat out a mouthful of blood!

“As expected of a Martial Marquis...” Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat ugly.

Gu Canghai, who wasn’t far away, had a calm expression.

“Everyone below the Martial Marquis realm is an ant. You’re already worthy of praise for being able to survive my attack,” Gu Canghai said indifferently.

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to listen to him. His mind was on how to escape.

His eyes swept around while trying to find a blind spot.

“It’s useless.” Gu Canghai seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s intentions.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Are you going to do it yourself, or shall I cripple you with my own hands?”

“F * ck you!”

Qin Yu cursed angrily, then took the initiative to clench his fist and charge forward!

“You’re too brazen.” Gu Canghai spat out coldly. Then, with a light pat, Qin Yu was sent flying!

With this palm strike, Qin Yu’s bones were completely broken, and he fell onto the ground in unbearable pain!

“Sect master, let me personally cripple him!” Elder Qu took the initiative to ask.

Gu Canghai glanced at him and nodded. “Hurry up.”

“Sect master, don’t worry!” Elder Qu eagerly agreed.

After which, he jogged all the way to Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, you lowly maggot, you actually want to go from rags to riches?” Elder Qu sneered.

“I’ll cripple your dantian right now and kill you, you trash!”

After saying that, Elder Qu curled his palm and his sharp claws clawed at Qin Yu’s dantian ruthlessly!
