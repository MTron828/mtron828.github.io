2168 The Furious Yan Ruoxue

As he watched the figure of Yan Ruoxue recede, doubts and indiscernible emotions filled his heart.

However, Yan Tianshi did not overthink. He thought that after losing Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue was venting her emotions to them.

Therefore, Yan Tianshi closed his eyes and continued cultivating.

But after a moment, Yan Tianshi suddenly opened his eyes!

“No!” Yan Tianshi’s expression changed drastically!

He recalled Yan Ruoxue’s words and suddenly felt something not right!

Following that, Yan Tianshi dared not waste any time. He quickly left the Cultivation Mountain and headed straight for the Yao family.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue had already arrived at the main gate of the Yao family through the teleportation formation.

She stood there with a cold expression, and the killing intent that surged from her body was even more terrifying to the extreme.

“D*mned b*stard…” Yan Ruoxue gritted her teeth and strode into the Yao family.

The Yao family naturally would not stop the Yan family’s saintess, so Yan Ruoxue easily entered the Yao family.

Just as she was looking for Yao Qi, she coincidentally bumped into Yao Xi.

“Saintess Yan?” When Yao Xi saw Yan Ruoxue, he quickly walked over.

“Saintess Yan, why did you suddenly…” he said with a smile.

“Boom!”

However, Yan Ruoxue suddenly struck out with her palm before Yao Xi could finish speaking.

This palm strike was incomparably terrifying. The palm force erupted like a fierce storm, bursting forth with tremendous power, bringing endless killing intent and anger as it ruthlessly smashed toward Yao Xi.

Yao Xi felt his vision blur. He could not react in time and could only raise his arms to block this terrifying palm force.

“Boom!”

The palm force collided with Yao Xi’s defense, and the violent impact instantly spread throughout the entire Yao family’s mansion.

The defenseless Yao Xi was instantly sent flying. His body was pushed back like a spinning top, crashing into a few pillars consecutively. In the end, he fell heavily to the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood!

Everyone from the Yao family was stunned by this sudden turn of events and stared at Yan Ruoxue in disbelief.

“Yan Ruoxue, what are you doing?” Yao Xi got up from the ground and wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth as he scolded loudly.

However, there was only one thought in Yan Ruoxue’s mind at this moment, and that was to avenge Qin Yu!

She ignored Yao Xi and raised her hands to circulate her internal qi. Yan Ruoxue’s eyes turned cold and sharp. She raised her hands, and a ball of dazzling light gathered in her palms. This light emitted an extremely powerful internal qi as if it was connected to the power of heaven and earth.

“The power of the Holy Region, heed my call!” Yan Ruoxue murmured. Determination and resolve filled her voice.

She pushed her palm forward, and the ball of light instantly expanded, forming a massive ball of light that contained the power to destroy everything.

It was the secret cultivating technique of the Yan family, the Heavenly Punishment Technique!

Yan Ruoxue’s figure became blurry as the ball of light expanded. She seemed to have merged into one with heaven and earth, becoming the messenger of heaven’s punishment.

The ball of light shot toward Yao Xi at a speed that was almost impossible to react to. Yao Xi felt a fatal danger. He quickly activated his strength, attempting to dodge this fatal blow.

However, the ball of light followed Yao Xi’s movements and flashed. No matter how Yao Xi dodged, he could not escape its pursuit.

In the end, the ball of light struck Yao Xi’s body, releasing a terrifying energy shock wave that instantly enveloped Yao Xi.

“Boom!”

A massive explosion resounded throughout the Yao family’s mansion. A strong wind blew, and flames flew everywhere, instantly engulfing Yao Xi’s figure.

Everyone from the Yao family looked at this scene in horror. They could not believe the scene before them. Yan Ruoxue had actually displayed such terrifying power.

Although Yao Xi resisted with all his might, he was forced to retreat. When the light dissipated, he was covered in wounds and blood!

“Yan Ruoxue, don’t think I’m afraid of you!” Yao Xi was enraged. Yan Ruoxue’s every move was a killing technique. She was obviously here to kill him!

However, Yan Ruoxue ignored Yao Xi. She raised her hand again and began to condense an even more terrifying technique!

A terrifying internal qi burst forth from her body, and dark clouds covered the sky. Lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled as if the entire world was enveloped in darkness. The wind howled, bringing with it an internal qi of destruction. The trees swayed non-stop, and the walls of the buildings began to crack.

The earth began to tremble, and deep cracks appeared as if the gates of hell were slowly opening.

All of this was due to the power Yan Ruoxue had unleashed. She raised her hands as if a god had descended into the world. The internal qi around her became even more tremendous and reached its peak state instantly. Her gaze was as sharp as a sword and condensed with the endless destructive power.

Yao Xi’s expression changed drastically. He could clearly sense how terrifying this internal qi was. He could even smell a hint of death!

At this critical moment, a large hand suddenly stretched out and pressed in Yan Ruoxue’s direction!

In an instant, all the internal qi disappeared, and the surroundings instantly regained their tranquility.

Looking up, it was Yao Qi!

When the surrounding people saw Yao Qi, they immediately bowed and greeted him, “Holy Lord.”

Yao Qi was silent. He looked at Yan Ruoxue and said coldly, “Saintess of the Yan family, why did you come to my Yao family and cause a ruckus?”

Yan Ruoxue did not care at all. She even planned to attack Yao Qi!

But against Yao Qi, all of Yan Ruoxue’s techniques were nothing. With a flick of his finger, Yao Qi trapped Yan Ruoxue in place.

“Yan Ruoxue, don’t go too far!” Yao Xi grimaced.

Yan Ruoxue looked like she had gone insane. She stared at Yao Qi and shouted frantically, “I want to declare war on your Yao family! I will kill everyone in your Yao family!”

Yao Qi’s expression was cold. He instantly understood Yan Ruoxue’s intentions.

This trip was clearly to take revenge for Qin Yu.

“Take her away first and let her calm down,” Yao Qi said coldly.

At this moment, another figure descended from the sky.

The atmosphere became even stranger with the appearance of this person.

“Holy Lord Yan.” Yao Qi walked forward as a gesture of greeting.

Yan Tianshi waved his hand and removed the restraints on Yan Ruoxue. Then he looked at Yao Qi. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Holy Lord Yan, my Yao family helped you get rid of Qin Yu. It’s fine if you don’t thank me, but you came to my Yao family and injured my Holy Son? What logic is this?” At this moment, the two elders of the Yao family suddenly walked out.

These two persons were the two elderly men who had sent Qin Yu into the void.

Yan Tianshi frowned slightly and said, “The matter with Qin Yu… Did you do it?”

The two elders said somewhat proudly, “That’s right. It was the two of us who made the move.”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue was furious and became even more agitated!

Yan Tianshi was silent. He looked at Yao Qi and whispered, “Holy Lord Yao, can we talk in private?”
