Chapter 240: The Appeal of the Divine Medicine Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Zhang Hua and Chen Meng instantly stopped in their tracks.

Both of their faces were filled with anger.

Zhang Hua, in particular, had an intense murderous aura lingering around his body. His terrifying internal qi caused the surrounding gravel to fly around wildly! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

On the other hand, Qin Yu stood there without moving an inch, as if he wasn’t affected at all.

“Then what do you want?” Zhang Hua narrowed his eyes as he asked.

Qin Yu sneered. “It’s very simple. Let me first break your ribs and then compensate me for the damages to my house. This matter will end here.”

“Hahahaha!” Zhang Hua immediately burst into laughter.

“You’re really too big for your britches!” Then, Zhang Hua roared angrily!

This roar contained his terrifying inner strength, and it rushed toward Qin Yu!

Using sound as a carrier to release inner strength was quite extraordinary!

However, Qin Yu didn’t move at all and allowed this inner strength to reach his body.

“Clang!”

After a crisp sound, Qin Yu’s body wasn’t affected in the slightest.

That inner strength instantly dissipated and disappeared without a trace.

“You have quite some ability.” Zhang Hua’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Jiang Gu, who was at the side, couldn’t wait any longer. He anxiously walked forward, cupped his hands and said, “I apologize to you on behalf of Mr. Qin. Please let it go!”

“Jiang Gu, I have already shown you mercy. This kid is courting death!” Zhang Hua said coldly.

Just when the situation was in a deadlock, Chen Meng suddenly walked forward and said with a nonchalant smile, “Mr. Qin, we have disturbed you today. Please forgive us.”

“You and I are doing this out of respect for Jiang Gu. Even if we can’t work together, we don’t have to fall out with each other,” Chen Meng said with a smile.

When he said this, everyone was stunned.

Zhang Hua frowned and said, “Mr. Chen, what do you mean?”

Chen Meng berated, “Mr. Zhang, it was our fault in the first place! Alright, stop fooling around and let’s leave quickly!”

Although Zhang Hua didn’t understand the situation, he still nodded silently.

“Kid, you better be careful.” Before leaving, Zhang Hua said coldly.

“The same goes for you.” Qin Yu said lightly.

After walking out of Qin Yu’s house, Zhang Hua said in confusion. “Why are you stopping me? That Kid is so arrogant, he should let me slap him to death!”

Chen Meng glanced at Zhang Hua and snorted. “As you can see, Qin Yu is only an Inner Strength Master Hands. How can he defeat Jiang Gu?”

Zhang Hua frowned and asked in confusion. “What do you mean?”

“You’re such a blockhead.” Chen Meng felt a headache.

“Jiang Gu’s strength is far above Qin Yu’s, but he is willing to bow down to Qin Yu. What does this mean?” Chen Meng said with a cold expression.

Zhang Hua thought for a moment, then said in surprise. “You mean... Jiang Gu is afraid of the people supporting Qin Yu?”

“Not only afraid, but he is scared out of his wits,” Chen Meng said indifferently.

“Do you think you can safely leave Chuzhou after killing Qin Yu here?” Chen Meng said with raised eyebrows.

Zhang Hua understood.

He wiped the sweat on his forehead and couldn’t help but feel a little scared.

In this world, no one dared to say that they were at the top.

Zhang Hua had a certain amount of weight in the Jiang Bei region, but in the entire country, there were many people who were more powerful than him.

“Are we just going to endure it like this? I can’t take it!” Zhang Hua said through gritted teeth.

Chen Meng smiled nonchalantly and said, “Of course we can’t just endure it like this.”

Zhang Hua hurriedly looked at Chen Meng and waited for him to continue.

Chen Meng said with a sinister expression. “This time, the Divine Medicine will be born. Qin Yu definitely won’t miss it! After the Divine Medicine is born, it will definitely attract competition. When that time comes, we will kill him. Who will know that we did it?”

“No matter how powerful the family behind him is, it will be impossible to trace it back to us!”

“Who knows how many enemies a person like Qin Yu has!”

Zhang Hua suddenly came to a realization.

He gave Chen Meng a thumbs up and said, “Mr. Chen, you’re really smart! When the time comes, I’ll see how arrogant Qin Yu can act!”

Chen Meng had other plans.

As long as he killed Qin Yu, Chuzhou would be leaderless. At that time, the top dog in Chuzhou would definitely be Jiang Gu.

And Jiang Gu definitely wouldn’t be able to challenge the Chen family!

At that time, the Chen family would enter Chuzhou on a large scale and seize the market!

“What an unexpected gain.” The corners of Chen Meng’s mouth curled up into a sneer.

...

Looking at the ruined villa, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a sense of heartache.

“If you want to make a move, then make a move. Why did you break my house...” Qin Yu rubbed his head and muttered softly.

Jiang Gu, who was at the side, didn’t know how to react.

He said anxiously. “Mr. Qin, Chen Meng and Zhang Hua’s strength is far above mine! And with their personalities, they will never give up!”

“Well, then what should I do?” Qin Yu looked around with distress and asked casually.

Jiang Gu hurriedly said, “When the Divine Medicine is born, if they attack you, even the Yan family won’t be able to find evidence!”

“Continue.” Qin Yu didn’t care at all. He even walked to the table and drank tea nonchalantly.

Jiang Gu gritted his teeth and said, “Mr. Qin,let’s give up the Divine Medicine...”

“Give up?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. “Why should we give up?”

Jiang Gu hurriedly said, “There’s always hope! With your talent and potential, there’s no need to take such a risk!”

Qin Yu sneered.

“They can’t kill me.” Qin Yu smirked.

“Besides... I’m a vengeful person. Even if they don’t look for me, I’ll look for them,” Qin Yu said while sipping his tea.

Jiang Gu didn’t know what to say.

Jiang Gu had fought with Qin Yu before, so he knew Qin Yu’s strength very well.

Although he did lose to Qin Yu, Qin Yu didn’t win easily either. He even used a formation.

In Jiang Gu’s opinion, with Qin Yu’s strength, it was absolutely impossible for him to defeat either Chen Meng or Zhang Hua.

“Mr. Qin...” Jiang Gu opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Qin Yu with a wave of his hand.

“Get ready. We’ll set off together the day after tomorrow.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

When he saw how stubborn Qin Yu was, Jiang Gu couldn’t continue to persuade him. He could only nod and agree.

The next day, more and more people came to Bai City from all over Jiang Bei.

Even some families that were further away had received the news and rushed to Bai City.

This was the appeal of a Divine Medicine!

In the Yihe Winery.

“Master, the news has spread. Many big families have come to Bai City.” Dong Tianhai’s disciples lamented.

Dong Tianhai nodded and said, “After all, it’s a once in a thousand years Divine Medicine. Other than those top families, no one can resist the temptation of a once in a thousand years Divine Medicine.”

“Master, are those trash from the Martial Arts Association useful? Inner Strength Past Masters aren’t worth mentioning.” His disciple frowned.

Dong Tianhai smiled and shook his head. “The Martial Arts Association has other uses. Don’t worry, everything is under my control.”
