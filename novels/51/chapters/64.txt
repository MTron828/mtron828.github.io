After hanging up the phone, Jiang Tao felt extremely remorseful.

“Jiang Tao, what’s going on? Isn’t your father the deputy mayor...” Lin Wan whispered.

Jiang Tao, wishing he could kill Lin Wan, glared at her!

“Teach this woman a lesson and throw her back to the Lin Family!” Jiang Tao said with a cold expression.

“Yes, Jiang Tao.” A few people immediately went forward and dragged Lin Wan to the car.

...

At this time, the market share of the Shen family was still declining, and the capital flow was also encountering difficulties.

“Mr. Shen, our capital has encountered a huge problem.” Shen Yun’s secretary sighed.

Shen Yun, his expression cold, stood in front of the window.

He was silent for a moment and said, “It’s okay. The loan I just applied for will probably come down soon.”

“But... our market share is still declining.” The secretary sighed.

Shen Yun didn’t say anything. He held the soul nourishment pill in his hand and couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.

He had never thought that such a small pill would actually bring such a big loss to the company.

What was even more unexpected to Shen Yun was that Yan Ruoxue had already predicted that the Shen family’s funds would run out and that the loan would be approved.

That was why she had introduced Qin Yu to the president of the Chuzhou Bank.

Everything seemed to be within Yan Ruoxue’s expectations.

...

“Mr. Qin, where are we going?” At this moment, Qin Yu and Yao Qing had already arrived at the bus stop.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “To the provincial capital.”

Although Wei Jiang had suggested bringing his wife to Jiangcheng, she was still a sick person after all. She couldn’t withstand fatigue, so Qin Yu had rejected it.

Standing at the entrance of the bus station, Qin Yu and Yao Qing bought two tickets.

“Mr. Qin, why don’t you buy a car? Taking a bus is too degrading,” Yao Qing muttered in a low voice while sitting in the waiting room.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “I’m just an ordinary person. What’s so degrading about taking a bus?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I didn’t mean that,” Yao Qing explained.

“The main thing is that you don’t lack money right now. Why...” Although Yao Qing didn’t continue, his meaning was very obvious.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “I don’t lack money right now, but the money has to be spent wisely.”

Buying a car wasn’t that beneficial for Qin Yu. It was far less affordable than riding a bus.

Moreover, Qin Yu wasn’t a vain person. He didn’t need a car to make himself seem like a big shot.

After more than ten minutes, the two of them boarded a bus to the provincial capital.

As soon as they sat down, Qin Yu’s shoulder was patted by someone.

Qin Yu turned around and saw a fashionable girl looking at him.

“Are you... Qin Yu?” She asked tentatively.

Qin Yu eyed at the girl carefully and suddenly exclaimed, “You are... Song Wei?”

“Yes, it’s me, Qin Yu. I didn’t expect to meet you here!” Song Wei said with some surprise.

Song Wei was Qin Yu’s high school classmate, and she was the only one who had a good relationship with him.

It wasn’t because of anything else, but because Song Wei’s background was similar to Qin Yu’s. Both of them had been orphans since they were young, so they were ignored by people in the class.

At the last class reunion, Song Wei was also not invited.

“We haven’t seen each other for more than ten years. You’ve changed.” Qin Yu looked at Song Wei and couldn’t help but lament.

He remembered that when she was in school, Song Wei was a girl who didn’t know how to dress up and wore unfashionable clothes.

Now, she had matured into a beautiful lady.

“You too.” Song Wei said somewhat embarrassedly.

“By the way, are you also going to work in the provincial capital?” Song Wei asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said with a smile, “I’m going to treat someone.”

“Treat someone?” Song Wei was a little surprised.

“I haven’t seen you for a few years, but you’ve actually become a doctor,” Song Wei said with some surprise.

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t explain.

Song Wei was born into a poor family, so she studied hard and now had a master’s degree from a prestigious university.

As long as the work went smoothly this time, her future would be full of potential

The two of them talked all the way and didn’t stop until they arrived at the provincial capital.

Before leaving, Song Wei gave Qin Yu her cell phone number and said, “We’ll contact each other again when we have time. I’ll treat you to a meal when my job stabilizes.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Okay, it’s a promise.”

Then, Song Wei took a taxi and left the place.

Qin Yu and Yao Qing stood at the station while waiting for Wei Jiang’s car.

Ten minutes later, an Audi A6 stopped in front of the two of them.

In the car, Wei Jiang’s son, Wei Hang, frowned and said, “Dad, are you really going to let Qin Yu treat my mom’s illness?”

Wei Jiang couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

He naturally couldn’t trust Qin Yu, but Yan Ruoxue’s meaning was too obvious. Wei Jiang had no choice.

“If Qin Yu is sensible, he probably won’t interfere.” Wei Jiang sighed.

Wei Hang frowned and said, “But what if he insists on intervening?”

Wei Jiang’s expression tensed up and his face was full of worry.

“For the sake of your mother, I can only offend the Yan family.” Wei Jiang gritted his teeth, as if he had made a big decision.

Following that, Wei Jiang got out of the car and walked all the way to Qin Yu.

“Mr. Qin, please get in the car,” Wei Jiang said politely.

Qin Yu greeted Wei Jiang and then got into the car with Yao Qing.
