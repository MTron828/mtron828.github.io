At this moment, he stared at Qin Yu with his vicious eyes. His eyes flickered with an inexplicable light as if he was calculating something.

Suddenly, his right leg moved.

A violent air rumble erupted and an intense force directly kicked Qin Yu’s chest.

Qin Yu did not move, allowing the force to kick his chest.

His body did not even tremble, but the internal qi on the bald man’s body began to soar.

When he reached Dao Realm level 9, the internal qi suddenly disappeared. What appeared next was another fragile energy. As soon as this energy was emitted, Qin Yu felt a sense of danger.

This seemed to be an extraordinary energy. Qin Yu could sense that it carried a strong internal qi of rule.

Was this the peak power?

This was Qin Yu’s first time coming into contact with peak power after coming to the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. He did not dare to relax either.

“Forget it. I know this person too. We don’t get to know each other until we fight.”

A figure slowly walked out from nearby. Qin Yu turned around and saw that it was Yellow-tooth.

Yellow-tooth seemed to have a high prestige among them. The bald man retracted his power after hearing Yellow- tooth.

“Little brother, are you interested in joining us? Forget about other things, but it’s not a problem for you to be a superior person in this Lingxu City.”

Yellow-tooth man narrowed his eyes and said.

“Not interested.”

Since the bald man didn’t want to fight, Qin Yu left immediately. He had more important things to do now.

“Ju Feng, this person is only Dao Realm level 5. Why are you so polite to him?” The bald man sounded dissatisfied.

“Have you forgotten my peak power? He made me feel danger before, so it’s best not to provoke him. Moreover, we have more important things to do now. The tomb that has just appeared is the largest inheritance in the past few thousand years. This mark could be a good thing but also a fatal disaster.”

Yellow-tooth touched the mark on his chest. His sixth sense was his peak power.

He had some special senses. Once there was danger, there was a certain probability that he could sense it.

“Did you sense anything? In this land of myriad tombs, it is the same for everyone no matter how large the inheritance is. Different restrictions will restrict the power of those monsters, which is our advantage.”

The bald man was curious.

“I don’t know. I didn’t sense anything when the mark appeared, which is why I’m afraid. Perhaps it means that the tomb of sinners only appeared occasionally, or that the tomb has far exceeded my power. Even my peak power can’t detect it. Let’s go back first and see if there’s any further news. There are still quite many monsters in this Lingxu City. Perhaps they might know something.”

Yellow-tooth said solemnly.

At that moment, Yi Yun spoke respectfully to Gu Ying, one of the four leaders in the Endless Mine.

“Lord Gu Ying, I’ve sensed his internal qi. He is now in Lingxu City in the land of the myriad tombs. Moreover, some changes had happened in that place previously. It’s best to gather more people if Lord Gu Ying wants to chase after this person. ”

“Remember, don’t mention the True Spirit Gu to anyone else. This operation must be kept a secret. Lord Sui of the Path of Heaven Academy and Elder Ming of the Upper Dome are also chasing after this kid with all their might.” He slightly clenched his fists.

He would be one step closer to becoming the Holy Lord if he got the Soul Suppression Ring!

He had to be more advanced than the others. He threw out a jade bottle.

“Heaven Comprehension Pill! Thank you, my lord! If there’s anything I can do for you, I’ll do my best!”

His body started to tremble. This was a pill for Dao Realm level 9 cultivators.

One had to know that only one could cultivate peak power out of 1,000 Dao Realm level 9 cultivators.

The Heaven Comprehension Pill was a heaven-defying pill that could increase the probability of cultivating peak power by 10%.

Just a pill could be sold for a sky-high price.

Gu Ying rewarded him with such a pill just because he had injected True Spirit Gu into Qin Yu’s body. This made him tremble uncontrollably.

If this pill appeared on the market, it would cause a huge fight.

“Remember, don’t reveal a single word, even if the other three come personally. Do you understand what I mean?”

Gu Ying said lightly.

“Understood!”

Yi Yun said solemnly once again.

At this moment, Qin Yu entered Lingxu City. Someone stopped him suddenly.

He turned around and saw an old man and a young man.

The child stared at Qin Yu curiously as he ate the candied haws in his hand.

“Is there anything you need, sir?”

Qin Yu asked in a deep voice. He did not know why he could not see through this person.

No matter how he looked, the old man in front of him was just like an ordinary person.

“Let me see.”

The old man grabbed Qin Yu’s palm and examined it.

Qin Yu was greatly alarmed. He could not tell how the old man grabbed him at all.

Even Dao Realm experts who cultivated peak power couldn’t do it!

He forcefully suppressed the urge to withdraw his hand and patiently waited for the old man’s next move.

“You’re most likely the person who triggered the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. But why can’t I tell? Your string of fate seems to have reached its end long ago. Someone is forcefully extending your life in secret.”

The old man muttered to himself, but what he said sounded like thunder in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The old man was probably telling the truth when he said that his string of fate had reached its end. His soul had dissipated once upon a time.

He had been to the battlefield of gods and demons and met his father before he returned to the Saint Kingdom.

Qin Yu felt a chill down his spine. Who was this old man?

Qin Yu’s right hand was already on the Soul Suppressing Ring. If there was any danger, he would immediately escape into the passageway.

The old man stared at Qin Yu with his turbid eyes. Qin Yu felt that his gaze had penetrated his skin.

He muttered as he saw through Qin Yu’s soul.

“The appearance of the Tomb of Heavenly Sins must mean that it has smelled the killing power. Anyone who has a mark on them will not be able to escape. You’ll die if you are the person chosen by the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. Even if you cultivate the power of the Dao of Dreams and possess the Soul Suppressing Ring, it will still be the same.”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When Qin Yu heard these words, his heart was in turmoil.

The mark on his chest had such a dangerous sign.

For some reason. Oin Yu felt that he was the one who activated the Tomb of

Heavenly Sins that the old man was talking about.

If what the old man said was true, then he would die for sure.

Moreover, the old man pointed out the power he cultivated. This made Qin Yu feel even more creeped out.

“There’s no need to be vigilant. I’m just curious. I have no ill intentions towards

you..”
