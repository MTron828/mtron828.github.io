Chapter 640: Had Finally Taken the Bait! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Of course, Qin Yu knew. After all, the impact of this matter was too great.

Most importantly, there were ordinary people involved.

“Lord Pavilion Master, I... have no other way,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The Pavilion Master sighed. “Sometimes, don’t be too hasty in doing things. You’ve already done well enough, so why be so impatient?”

Qin Yu suddenly raised his head.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Pavilion Master, you don’t know what Ruoxue encountered in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! These animals are drinking her blood all the time!”

“Now, they even treat Yan Ruoxue as their own martial arts resources and use her to create some super powerhouses! They keep transferring the bloodline of Yan Ruoxue to others!”

“I can’t bear it! As long as I close my eyes, her painful expression will appear in front of me and torture me all the time!”

“I want to kill all of them, all of them!”

Qin Yu was agitated and his eyes were scarlet red. Even the Pavilion Master was somewhat shocked when she saw it.

“Qin Yu, calm down first.” The Pavilion Master patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and tried his best to calm himself down.

“Pavilion Master, I’m sorry. I lost my composure,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The Pavilion Master shook her head. She didn’t continue this topic. Instead, she asked in puzzlement, “Why did you want to crash the auction? What’s in it for you?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth. He originally wanted to tell the Pavilion Master about the male corpses.

But after thinking about it, he still didn’t say it in the end.

“In short, it’s useful to me,” Qin Yu said.

Seeing this, the Pavilion Master didn’t continue to ask.

“Qin Yu, you have to be careful. If you are captured...” the Pavilion Master didn’t continue, but her meaning was very obvious.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Don’t worry, I will be careful.”

“Stay here for the next few days for refuge,” the Pavilion Master said.

Qin Yu didn’t refuse. He nodded and agreed.

That night, Qin Yu stayed in this secret room. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

No one knew that Qin Yu appeared in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Even the pharmacists of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion knew nothing about it.

The next day, Qin Yu took out the auction items that he had snatched from the auction.

Among these auction items, there were many precious herbs that were more than a thousand years old.

Qin Yu took advantage of these few days to start refining pills and devouring them.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed, and Qin Yu had finished eating all the herbs.

However, these herbs couldn’t help Qin Yu reach the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis Realm. The higher he advanced, the more difficult it was for Qin Yu to advance.

The amount of spiritual energy he needed to cultivate was ten times or even dozens of times that of others! Therefore, he needed a large number of herbs!

Qin Yu was unable to rest.

Qin Yu sighed slightly. He took out his phone and opened the Martial Arts Forum.

On the forum, the top message was about the establishment of an academy by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

Qin Yu hurriedly opened this message and saw that it described the activation of the bloodline!

“Damn it!” Qin Yu immediately flew into a rage!

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association had actually established an academy. Was it going to suck Ruoxue’s blood dry!?!

Not only that, but this message also included the fact that there were already many students in the academy who had been baptized by the blood.

This made Qin Yu burn with rage and anger!

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association...” Qin Yu couldn’t calm down. He clenched his fists, then pushed open the door and walked out.

After pushing open the door, he bumped into the Pavilion Master.

The Pavilion Master frowned. “What’s wrong?”

Qin Yu said, “Lord Pavilion Master, I’m going to Jingdu.”

“Going to Jingdu?” The Pavilion Master frowned slightly.

“Now, they are all thinking of ways to catch you. Aren’t you sending yourself to death by going to Jingdu?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “I have to go.”

Although the Pavilion Master wanted to advise Qin Yu, she could see that Qin Yu had made up his mind to go.

Thus, she could only say, “Then be careful.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. That day, he left Qinghe town and headed straight for Jingdu.

After arriving in Jingdu, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to act. Instead, he temporarily found a place to stay and looked up information about this academy.

After investigation, Qin Yu learned that this academy was named Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.

And the first batch of students were the inner members of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, including the nine people who were killed by Qin Yu.

As for the second batch of students, they were the talented young masters of the various aristocratic families.

These young masters had yet to participate for the time being, and the exact time was yet to be determined.

“This academy... can’t be established!” Qin Yu said through gritted teeth.

Once they were successfully established, it meant that Qin Yu would go against all the aristocratic families!

At that time, Qin Yu would definitely be in a disadvantageous position.

At night, Qin Yu came to Xia Hang’s home again.

When Xia Hang returned home, Qin Yu was playing with building blocks with Xia Hang’s daughter.

“Sir, I still want to eat more.” The little girl grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said.

Qin Yu smiled. He took out a lollipop, as if he was performing a magic trick.

“This is the last lollipop. Eating too much isn’t good for your health.” Qin Yu handed the lollipop to the little girl.

“Okay!” The little girl nodded vigorously. She grabbed the lollipop and ran to the side.

Seeing this scene, Xia Hang hurried over.

He said coldly, “Qin Yu, what did you let my daughter eat?!”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Don’t be nervous. It’s just an ordinary lollipop. I bought it from a small store.”

Even though that was the case, Xia Hang was obviously worried.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “Unless you betray me, I won’t do anything to a child. After all, I’m not a beast like the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is. I haven’t lost my humanity yet.”

Xia Hang’s expression was a bit ugly. He tried his best to calm down and said, “What are you doing here?”

Qin Yu said coldly, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Academy has a few members now.”

Xia Hang immediately rejoiced.

However, he still acted aloof and said, “Three. Why?”

“Nothing much.” Qin Yu stood up and said.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is really a bunch of bastards. In order to expand their own power, they don’t care about other people’s lives.”

Xia Hang sneered. “Qin Yu, don’t be so childish. As long as the benefits are enough, one life is nothing.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

“Then how much do you plan to exchange for your daughter’s life?”

Xia Hang immediately became furious. “Qin Yu, my daughter’s life is priceless!”

“Your daughter’s life is priceless, but other people’s lives aren’t?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xia Hang was stunned and had nothing to say.

Qin Yu didn’t continue to talk nonsense with Xia Hang. He turned around and prepared to leave.

“Wait!” At this time, Xia Hang suddenly called out to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Do you still have something to say?”

“No.” Xia Hang waved his hand again.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He turned around and left.

After Qin Yu left, Xia Hang took a deep breath. His eyes emitted a chill.

“Finally, you’ve taken the bait. Qin Yu, this time, you’re dead meat for sure!”
