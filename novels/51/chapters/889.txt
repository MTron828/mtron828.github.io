Chapter 890: Chapter 890, Yan Ruoxue’s cultivation

“Mr. Qin... He’s in Jingdu...”Zhen Yue said in a daze.

Zhen Yue had no idea that Qin Yu had returned this time, so she had always thought that Qin Yu was still in Jingdu.

“Jingdu...”the martial saint could not help but frown.

He threw Zhen Yue aside and walked to Zhai Xing’s side.

“Qin Yu is in Jingdu,”he looked at Zhai Xing and said in a deep voice.

Zhai Xing couldn’t help but frown and snort coldly, “Qin Yu is in Jingdu? Go back and find him immediately!”

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was looking for Yan Ruoxue.

In front of this mystic realm was a large forest with countless trees.

After passing through this forest, there was a residential house.

The residential area was somewhat simple and crude, but it wasn’t small.

Looking at the residential area in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel somewhat surprised.

Because this residential area was similar to an ordinary residential area. It was extremely simple and crude.

“This should be a mystic realm created by a certain mighty figure,”Li Yu said from the side. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Mm, it doesn’t look like a sect.”

In the vast mystic realm, there was actually only one residence. Other than that, there were trees and forests.

“Using such a huge mystic realm as a residence is really... extravagant.”Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

Li Yu said from the side, “It is indeed extravagant, but this mystic realm can’t be considered truly huge.”

Qin Yu looked at Li Yu in surprise and said, “Not considered huge? Could it be that there are even more terrifying mystic realms?”

Li Yu sneered and said, “According to my research on Secret Realms, a top-grade secret realm can be considered a real world. It doesn’t even need to depend on the current world to exist.”

Qin Yu could not help but be secretly speechless.

Cultivation was really a long road. How terrifying was the power of a true top-grade cultivator? He did not dare to imagine!

Qin Yu shook his head. These were too far away from him. The most important thing now was to enter the martial saint realm as soon as possible.

Then, Qin Yu brought Li Yu into the room.

As soon as they entered the room, they saw Yan Ruoxue cleaning the room.

When she saw Qin Yu walking in, Yan Ruoxue walked forward quickly and asked, “Where’s The Pavilion Master?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “She... didn’t come.”

Yan Ruoxue did not ask further and only nodded.

Then, Qin Yu accompanied Yan Ruoxue to clean the room from the inside out. This way, they could be considered to have a place to stay.

After he was free, Qin Yu took a deep breath and felt the Qi/spiritual energy coming from the surrounding area.

“With this kind of environment, I think I will be able to step into the martial saint realm soon,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

As he was speaking, Qin Yu’s vision suddenly turned dark and he spat out a mouthful of blood!

When she saw the shocking blood, a trace of panic flashed across Yan Ruoxue’s snow-white face.

“You... What Happened to you? Are You Hurt?”Yan Ruoxue touched Qin Yu’s face and looked around.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and shook his head, “No, it’s a hidden disease.”

“Hidden disease? What’s going on?”Yan ruoxue frowned and looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu had no choice but to tell Yan Ruoxue what had happened.

“As long as I become a martial saint, this wound will disappear on its own,”Qin Yu said.

Although he said this, Yan Ruoxue still looked extremely worried.

After a while, Yan ruoxue suddenly said, “Can you teach me how to cultivate?”

Qin Yu was stunned, then he smiled and said, “Sure.”

Yan Ruoxue’s body had blood that made all the secret realms go crazy. If she stepped into cultivation, her future would be limitless!

And the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and Yan Jinyao had said that if Yan Ruoxue stepped into cultivation, it would be an extremely terrifying thing!

In the courtyard, Qin Yu was teaching Yan Ruoxue the breathing exercise method step by step.

In just half an hour, Yan Ruoxue had already learned this breathing exercise method.

The surrounding Qi/spiritual energy surged towards Yan Ruoxue’s body like a spring. Her Qi started to increase in an extremely short amount of time!

Qin Yu could not help but be stunned when he saw this.

Such speed was something that even he could not compare to!

“So Fast...”Qin Yu could not help but say in a low voice.

Li Yu, who was at the side, also widened his eyes and said, “Why has the Yan family never allowed her to cultivate... this... this is simply a reckless waste of a heavenly gift!”

As Yan Ruoxue breathed and breathed, her originally fair skin became even whiter. An otherworldly temperament made her look like a fairy.

A few minutes later, Yan Ruoxue opened her eyes.

She blinked her eyes and carefully asked, “Is this right?”

Qin Yu came back to his senses and quickly nodded, “Yes, that’s right...”

“You’re not allowed to lie to me,”Yan Ruoxue pouted and said.

The corner of Qin Yu’s mouth revealed a hint of bitterness.

“Let me tell you this. Your cultivation has given me a lot of pressure,”Qin Yu helplessly shook his head and said.

Li Yu, who was at the side, also gave her a thumbs up and said, “As expected of the young miss of the Yan family. Even her cultivation has such achievements!”

The praise from both of them made Yan Ruoxue feel a little embarrassed.

“Then... Should I also cultivate with you?”Yan Ruoxue suggested.

“Okay!”Qin Yu nodded hard.

After that, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time. He took out his collection from the spatial artifact and began to cultivate.

Currently, the fastest absorption speed for Qin Yu was none other than the Yin heart and the ice glaze heart.

Therefore, Qin Yu deliberately separated his position from Yan Ruoxue.

He suspended the ice glaze heart in mid-air and used the heaven devouring technique to slowly absorb the internal Qi emitted from the ice glaze heart.

...

Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Wan Gu Qiong brought two martial saints and stood on the square.

He scanned the surroundings and said indifferently, “Ask the Pavilion Master of the Medicine God Pavilion to come out and see me.”

The third elder frowned and asked, “Who are you? Why do you want to see Our Pavilion Master?”

Wan Gu Qiong glanced at him and said, “You don’t have the right to speak to me.”

The third elder opened his mouth and was about to speak when the martial saint behind Wan Gu Qiong suddenly raised his palm!

The martial saint gently pinched his finger and the third elder’s body instantly became distorted!

A tremendous force caused all the bones in the third elder’s body to Creak!

The third elder’s body quickly curled up and his internal organs were all squeezed at this moment!

“Pu!”

In just a few short seconds, the third elder’s body directly turned into a bloody mist!

When the surrounding people saw this, they immediately sucked in a breath of cold air!

Everyone took a step back and looked at the few people in front of them in horror.

Wan Gu Qiong said indifferently, “Go and call the Pavilion Master of the Medicine God Pavilion Out For me! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

“I’m afraid it’s not justifiable for you to come to my medicine God Pavilion and kill people for no reason.”

At this moment, the pavilion master slowly walked over from not far away.

When he saw the woman in front of him, a hint of lust flashed across wan gu Qiong’s face.

He could not help but lick his lips, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a wicked smile.

“I didn’t expect that the well-known Pavilion Master of the Medicine God Pavilion would actually be a little beauty.”Wan Gu Qiong said with narrowed eyes.

The pavilion master frowned slightly and said in a cold voice, “Why have you come to my medicine God Pavilion?”

Wan Gu Qiong coughed dryly and said indifferently, “I’m here to look for Qin Yu. Do you know where Qin Yu Is?”

“I don’t know. In short, he’s not in My Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”The pavilion master said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

Wan Gu Qiong laughed coldly and said, “Who doesn’t know that the Pavilion Master of Your Divine Alchemist Pavilion Favors Qin Yu? Even if he’s not in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, you must know where he is.”

“Speak, don’t force us to make a move.”

Before he finished speaking, the two martial saints behind Wan Gu Qiong immediately took a step forward.
