Returning the favor meant that Pang Ding would deliberately give way to Qin Yu.

Although Pang Ding agreed verbally, he felt defiant.

As Ye Qing’s disciple, how could he lose to a country bumpkin?

“Commander Ye, I understand,” Pang Ding said with a bow.

On the other side, Commander Ye looked at Qin Yu with a smile.

He didn’t think that Qin Yu could defeat Pang Ding at all, so his worries completely disappeared.

“Qin Yu, don’t blame me.” Commander Ye patted Qin Yu’s shoulder with a smile.

Qin Yu said, “Commander Ye, why should I blame you? As long as we can defeat Pang Ding as soon as possible, the first place will still belong to the Chuzhou region.”

Commander Ye laughed and said, “Good, good. If you can really defeat Commander Ye’s personal disciple, I’ll be impressed!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Although Qin Yu didn’t have a mentor, the inheritance left by his father was a treasure trove.

This was enough for Qin Yu to be unafraid of anyone.

“Next, let’s invite the coaches of both sides to the stage!” The host shouted.

With a shout, Pang Ding took the lead and walked to the stage.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and quickly arrived in front of Pang Ding.

Their eyes met, and tension sparked in the air.

Pang Ding was slightly angry.

His desire to prove himself made him anxious to defeat Qin Yu.

“Commander Ye said that you deliberately let us win just now. I don’t think this is true.” Pang Ding asked coldly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “If you think it’s true, then it’s true. If you think it’s false, then it’s false.”

Pang Ding sneered and said, “Commander Ye said that he wants me to give in to you in the second half to return the favor.”

“Tell me, should I follow Commander Ye’s orders?”

Qin Yu hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Don’t! I don’t want to win unjustly.”

Pang Ding laughed loudly and said, “To be honest, I don’t want to give in to you either! Commander Ye said that I’m less capable than you, then I’ll have to prove it to him!”

Before he could finish his words, the internal qi on Pang Ding’s body suddenly erupted! The entire training ground was instantly filled with gusts of wind!

A terrifying pressure rolled towards Qin Yu!

“Fourth level Inner Strength Grandmaster?” Qin Yu raised his brows, but there wasn’t the slightest hint of panic in his eyes.

This made Pang Ding extremely furious! As Ye Qing’s personal disciple, he was looked down upon by a junior who had just entered the Inner Strength Past Master realm. How could he not be angry?!

“I will use my fist to personally crush you!” Pang Ding said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t feel intimidated by Pang Ding’s warning. He calculated the time and muttered, “Just now, the Jingdu Military District used more than two hours to defeat the Longhu team. In other words, as long as I defeat you within two hours, the Chuzhou region will be number one.”

“B*stard, are you looking down on me?!” Pang Ding immediately flew into a rage!

He didn’t waste any more time. His feet suddenly shook, and a terrifying internal qi lifted him up!

His entire body was like a cannonball as it blasted towards Qin Yu!

As a soldier of the Jingdu Military District, his attack style was more inclined towards physical techniques.

Pang Ding’s powerful fist traveled towards Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed!

Qin Yu’s body was like a light swallow as he dodged back and forth between the gaps of Pang Ding’s fists.

Every punch was dodged by him at the right time.

The brilliant fighting style caused waves of cheers.

Everyone, afraid of missing any details, was watching this battle.

In the blink of an eye, Pang Ding had already thrown out hundreds of punches, but the hit rate was pitifully low, and the injuries caused to Qin Yu were almost negligible.

Pang Ding looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Do you only know how to dodge?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “You are Commander Ye’s disciple after all. I don’t want you to lose too miserably.”

“How arrogant!” Pang Ding was even more furious! This feeling of being looked down upon made him fly into a rage!

Pang Ding’s fists flickered with light, as if fog was condensing!

His arms emitted a red light, and it was as if one could see blood boiling under his skin!

“His inner strength evaporated?” Qin Yu was a bit surprised.

What kind of power was this? He turned the inner strength around his arms into mist?

“Go to h*ll!” Pang Ding shouted, and his two fists smashed toward Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu raised his fist to meet the fist. The two fists collided, and the terrifying force shook the ground under their feet before creating many cracks!

Even the officials of the various districts on the viewing platform were affected!

The smoke and dust gradually settled down. The two of them still maintained fist to fist contact, as if there was no difference in strength.

Pang Ding frowned and said coldly, “You can actually withstand this punch of mine? Impressive.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “The strength of your punch isn’t bad, but the penetrating force is slightly inferior.”

“It has brute force, but not enough brute force to be fatal. When faced with an opponent with a strong physical body, it will be powerless.”

Pang Ding’s expression changed, and he roared angrily, “I don’t need your guidance!”

Ye Qing, who was on the stage, heard this conversation clearly.

He slowly stood up and said, “Pang Ding has lost. There’s no need to continue watching.”

After saying that, Ye Qing turned around and left.

Commander Long noticed this scene and his expression changed. He muttered in a low voice, “Oh no, Commander Ye is angry...”

Pang Ding didn’t notice Ye Qing’s departure. He glared at Qin Yu and said angrily, “What right do you have to guide me?!”

After saying that, Pang Ding’s fist surged with energy again! He used almost all his strength and smashed towards Qin Yu!

In an instant, his fists seemed to be steaming! It almost tore Qin Yu’s clothes into pieces! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Qin Yu didn’t dodge and once again faced him head-on.

The second fist bump still had no result.

Qin Yu still shook his head and said, “It’s still the same problem. Although the strength is great, it’s not so great that it’s fatal. and the penetration force is almost zero.”

Pang Ding gritted his teeth and said, “Stop being so pretentious! You talk as if you have the ability to do so! If you have the ability, give me a punch!”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s exactly what I was thinking. Officer Pang, watch carefully.”

After saying that, Qin Yu stepped forward. His body leaned backward and then he suddenly threw out a punch!

The seemingly simple punch had immense power!

The powerful force moved towards Pang Ding’s body!

The terrifying gust of wind from his fist made the sand and rocks fly, and their hair flapped around wildly!

Pang Ding felt that his face was about to be torn apart by the gust of wind from his fist!

However, this punch stopped in front of Pang Ding’s face and didn’t land on his body.

“See? This is the combination of penetrating power and strength.” Qin Yu put down his fist, turned around, and left.
