2517 Unrivaled Ghosts and Gods

Si Liuhe took a deep breath, and Starled Stillness in his hand emitted the sound of unbearable strain.

The surrounding air current was as if condensed, and Starled Stillness seemed to have become Si Liuhe’s arm.

Suddenly, he took a firm step forward. His body was as stable as a mountain, and a powerful aura appeared out of thin air.

He raised his saber, and the edge flickered with cold light, as dazzling as starlight.

The saber intent soared into the sky, tearing a massive crack.

“Qin Yu, this is the most powerful slash I’ve comprehended from the Si family’s immortal scripture. It’s not too late to retreat now.”

Si Liuhe narrowed his eyes and said.

Qin Yu’s body did not move. He stared at Si Liuhe coldly.

He conveyed his attitude through his actions. Si Liuhe’s expression changed as his cold voice escaped his mouth.

“You don’t know what’s good for you!”

“Boom!”

Startled Stillness raised high as if sensing this power.

Numerous bolts of lightning suddenly appeared out of thin air and landed on the saber from all directions.

In an instant, countless shocking saber lights fell like meteors.

Each saber light landed would result in a massive tremor on the ground.

The entire Sky City suddenly turned into a scene of flying sand and rolling stones. This terrifying tremor could be distinctly felt even ten thousand miles away.

This terrifying tremor shocked many people. It was just the fall of saber intent, but it had caused such a shocking scene.

Since the alliance entered Sky City, numerous Formation Masters carved the formations.

The ground here was even harder than steel.

However, under the power of Si Liuhe’s move, the ground smashed into pieces like tofu.

Watery Purification Heart Slash!

Landslide Mountain Collapse Slash!

As thousands of saber intent descended, every saber intent falling on the ground would cause a change in heaven and earth.

The saber intent of Woodland Enchantment Vine Slash slashed onto the ground. In an instant, wild grass on the ground grew wildly, trees grew with vigor, flourishing with dense foliage, and the forest extended far into the distance.

As the Watery Purification Heart Slash landed, mist permeated the surroundings. The dense mist made everyone unable to see the scene in front of them clearly. When the mist dissipated, a huge rainbow appeared in the surroundings.

In an instant, the power of fire burned the entire world, and raging flames filled the sky. The flames danced like demons, forming a beautiful and ferocious flame sculpture that emitted a scorching temperature. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When the saber energy of the Landslide Mountain Collapse Slash landed, the saber intent changed the entire landscape instantly. The power of the earth made the ground firm and stable. The ground pressed together to form mountains that towered into the clouds, like the stretching spine of a giant.

The four saber intents had caused a change in the environment.

Each of the saber intents was tremendously terrifying.

“Is Grandmaster Ji’s strength that terrifying? Grandmaster Ji’s main cultivation is the Way of Metal, and the other saber intents are only supplementary.”

Hua Zhikong said with a frown. He also seemed to be shocked by this power.

“It’s indeed terrifying. Just relying on the power of the saber intent alone can change the environment. Even if it’s not the main path, this saber intent has reached a tremendously deep level. Every trace of sword intent is faintly comparable to the power of the Tribulation Fifth Level.”

“This is indeed the rain of thousands of saber intent…”

The people around them were also watching the battle. They did not observe Qin Yu’s battle in detail when they were in the Si family. Now, they were curious about how he would deal with it.

The terrifying rain of saber intent landed beside Qin Yu, and ripples kept appearing on his body.

It was the omnipresent saber intent that wanted to tear apart his spiritual defense.

However, it was densely packed but did not pose a threat to Qin Yu. Qin Yu suddenly felt a sense of vigilance in his heart.

In an instant, the second-level desolate divine eye appeared in his glabella.

Almost simultaneously, the Startled Stillness in Si Liuhe’s hand suddenly fell.

The surging power of the metal origin suddenly surged into his body, a force more ferocious than a hundredfold compared to others.

As it landed, the power of metal permeated the earth. From the mountains to the rivers, everything was enveloped in gold color. The mountain rock shone with a metallic light, emitting a formidable and inviolable internal qi.

More than half of the Holy Region was covered by the golden saber light almost instantly.

That shocking saber had already slashed through heaven and earth, directly descending toward Qin Yu.

Woodland Enchantment Vine Slash!

Fiery Forge Sky Incineration Slash!

Landslide Mountain Collapse Slash!

Four types of saber intent and nearly 1,000 saber lights instantly gathered on this golden saber light.

Unrivaled Ghosts and Gods!

In an instant, the golden saber light released a bright light that was ten times brighter. A terrifying saber directly slashed down.

A terrifying wave motion circulated on the ground.

As the compressed energy rushed out of the ground, the lava underground erupted instantly.

Even Sky City’s formation could not withstand this terrifying power.

Revered Qi frowned slightly and pressed his palm down slightly.

The gushing lava instantly calmed down.

When the terrifying tremor calmed down, everyone saw the two sides fighting clearly. They instantly revealed expressions of disbelief.

At this moment, Qin Yu had somehow broken through Si Liuhe’s saber light.

He grabbed Si Liuhe’s neck and lifted him.

His indifferent gaze sent chills down Si Liuhe’s spine.

“How could this be?”

His eyes filled with disbelief. The slash that he had unleashed with his full strength was actually dodged by Qin Yu just like that.

Under this attack, his spirit, force, and saber combined, firmly locking Qin Yu.

However, he still failed to hit Qin Yu. This caused his face to turn ashen instantly.

This feeling was so unbearable that it made him feel like vomiting blood. His most powerful attack was like cutting a falling leaf in the air. It was simply driving him crazy.

“Si Liuhe, this is the level the villain you look down on can reach.”

Qin Yu said softly and directly threw him to the side.

No matter how much killing intent he had, with Revered Qi around, he definitely could not kill him.

“What a strange power! In an instant, the body’s power gathered between the legs and exploded with such terrifying power. Moreover, it could break the lock of Si Liuhe’s power of origin. This power is far beyond his.”

Su Xinghe said with some surprise. He had expected Qin Yu to win, but he did not expect him to win so effortlessly.

“This kind of power seems to have the shadow of the cultivation of the monster realm. Could it be that he comprehended it during the previous battle with He Teng? If that’s the case, this little guy is a little ridiculous. Didn’t we study the cultivation methods of the monster realm before? I remember it took nearly a hundred years to sort out a clue.”
