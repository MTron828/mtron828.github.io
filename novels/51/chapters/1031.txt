Chapter 1032: Chapter 1,032. The higher-ups invited him again

Ever since the Wan family mystic realm was flattened, the disciples of the Mystic Realm had kept a low profile.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu stayed in the Green Moon Villa and re-established the mountain gate.

The mountain gate was officially renamed as the Heaven Gate.

“You won’t object to changing this place to the Heaven Gate, right?”Standing at the entrance of the mountain gate, Qin Yu looked at Zhen Yue jokingly.

Zhen Yue quickly shook her head and said, “This belongs to you. The Green Moon Villa no longer exists.”

Qin Yu didn’t care about the name of the sect.

However, if Zhen Yue continued to lead the sect, it would be very difficult to convince the chief.

On the same day, all the good friends came to the Heaven Gate to celebrate at Qin Yu’s invitation.

Among them were Jiang he, Zhuang Teng, and Gu Taichu, who they hadn’t seen for a long time.

Gu Taichu’s strength had also stepped into the realm of the Martial Marquis. However, due to his lack of talent, it would be difficult for him to improve any further.

In the Hall of the Heaven Gate, everyone gathered in front of a huge round table.

After three rounds of drinking, Gu Taichu could not help but sigh, “I really did not expect that you have grown to such a level in such a short time.”

Qin Yu bowed and said, “I was just lucky.”

“Lucky?”Everyone couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

“If it was just luck, you would have died countless times.”

Qin Yu smiled and didn’t say anything. Everyone knew that this was just Qin Yu’s humble words.

After eating, Qin Yu left Gu Taichu and the others in the Heaven Gate and became a member of the Heaven Gate.

In the afternoon.

Yao Meng, Zhuang Tengkong Yun, and the others gathered under a pavilion in the Heaven Gate.

The weather gradually became warmer and the summer wind blew across everyone’s faces. The atmosphere was quite harmonious.

“Everyone, what are your plans next?”Xiao Yuan asked with a faint smile.

Chu Hedao was the first to speak, “I plan to go into closed-door cultivation. Everyone has stepped into the martial saint realm. I Can’t wait any longer.”

“Mm, that’s what I’m thinking,”Kong Yun said.

“We can’t let Qin Yu be the only one.”

“Sigh, it’s time to try and break through. Otherwise, we’ll be crushed by the wheels of the era.”

“This is a golden age.”Someone exclaimed.

This was indeed a golden age. There were countless geniuses emerging. No one knew if there would be new geniuses emerging and slapping them on the beach.

A great pressure lingered on everyone’s head.

At this moment, Qin Yu walked over from not far away.

“What are we talking about?”Qin Yu found a seat and sat down.

“What else can we talk about? Of course we’re talking about you being awesome,”Kong Yun said half-jokingly and half-seriously.

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile and said, “Don’t make fun of me.”

“I’m not making fun of you. You went from unknown to famous in just three years. You really make others envious.”Kong Yun curled his lips and said.

Qin Yu said in a low voice, “I was just forced. If I had the same living conditions as you, who would be willing to work so hard?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Cheh.”The few of them laughed.

“Qin Yu, where is Ruoxue? Where did she go? With your current ability, you should have the ability to protect her, right?”Yao Meng suddenly asked.

At the mention of Yan Ruoxue, Qin Yu immediately fell into silence.

After a while, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “My current ability is nothing. In this world... There are many existences that we don’t know about.”

For example, the secret realm of the Yan family and the eight higher-ups of the martial arts association in Jingdu.

Based on a rough estimate, their strength was above that of mighty figures.

However, they didn’t seem to be in this world. No one knew where they actually existed.

“What are your plans next?”Xiao Yuan asked.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Attack the second secret realm.”

“Are you really going to do that?”Someone said in surprise.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I want the martial arts association of Jingdu to disappear from this world.”

“And then replace them?”Someone asked.

Qin Yu glanced at him and shook his head. “No, such a meaningless organization shouldn’t exist.”

“The second secret area... isn’t that easy to deal with,”Yao Meng said in a low voice.

“As far as I know, besides the GU family, there are many warriors in the second secret area. The number is enormous.”

Qin Yu looked at Yao Meng in surprise and said, “Miss Yao, you seem to know something?”

“I’ve only heard of it, but I don’t know the details,”Yao Meng said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything for a while.

The last time he went to the second secret area, it was only to save people. The places that Qin Yu went through were less than one-tenth of the second secret area.

Qin Yu had no idea what kind of power they had.

“It seems that I have to ask Little Qing about the situation,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, Qin Yu said jokingly, “Are you interested in going to the second secret area with me? There might be a lot of resources there.”

“I’m afraid we won’t join in the fun. It’s time for us to go into seclusion to catch up with you,”Kong Yun rolled his eyes and said.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Then I wish all of you an early step into the martial saint realm.”

“Thank you for your kind words.”Yao Meng smiled.

After this day, they left the Heaven Gate one after another and began to search for their own dao techniques.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu sent people to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and brought Little Qing to the Heaven Gate. He was ready to inquire about the second secret realm.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Xia hang.

After picking up the phone, Qin Yu smiled and said, “Why, are you here to congratulate me?”

Xia hang on the other end said in a deep voice, “The higher-ups want to see you.”

A trace of shock flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

“Want to see me? Where?”Qin Yu stood up and asked.

“In the conference room of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu,”Xia Hang said.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and continued, “Okay, I’ll go to Jingdu now.”
