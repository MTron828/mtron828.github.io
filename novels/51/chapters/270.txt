After they noticed the old man’s gaze, Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi’s expressions immediately turned ugly.

As for the others, their eyes were filled with pity.

“It should be the two of them,” one of the old men said.

“Yeah, but which one specifically?” The other old man frowned slightly.

The two of them sized up Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi, and were seemingly unable to make a decision for a moment.

However, at this moment, Xiao Mi suddenly pointed at Xiao Yu and said, “It must be her. It must be her. It has nothing to do with me. Catch her...”

When she heard Xiao Mi’s words, Xiao Yu’s pupils dilated, and disbelief was written all over her face.

She found it hard to believe that these words came out of Xiao Mi’s mouth! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Xiao Yu, just admit it on your own initiative. Yang Zhao targeted you back then. It has nothing to do with me...” Xiao Mi said with a trembling voice.

“Sir, the person you guys wanted to catch back then was Xiao Yu, not me. Don’t look for me...”

The two old men were deep in thought. After sizing up Xiao Yu, they nodded and said, “It should be her.”

After saying that, the two men walked forward and caught Xiao Yu.

However, Xiao Yu still hadn’t recovered from her shock.

She stared in Xiao Mi’s direction and couldn’t help but feel a little sad.

Updates by

Her best friend actually said such words at this moment.

It was impossible not to feel sad.

The two old men brought Xiao Yu out of the dungeon and arrived at the entrance of a cave.

After entering the cave, they saw that there were all kinds of instruments inside.

Other than that, there were countless snakes, insects, blood, and corpses.

At the very front, there was a huge formation stage!

In the center of the formation stage, there was the corpse of a young man!

Hui Ming was sitting at the side of the corpse!

Seeing this scene, Xiao Yu was scared out of her wits and was trembling non-stop.

“Sect master, I’ve brought the person.” The two old men brought Xiao Yu over.

Hui Ming’s eyes suddenly turned towards Xiao Yu!

His piercing gaze almost made Xiao Yu cry out of fear!

“Tsk Tsk, this is a pure dark energy body...” Hui Ming licked his lips and said.

“You live up to your reputation! You live up to your reputation!” Hui Ming couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

An elder beside Hui Ming said in a sullen voice, “With a pure dark energy body, reviving the ancestor shouldn’t be a problem.”

“That’s right.” Hui Ming nodded slightly.

He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “It’s a pity that the stone statue is still in Qin Yu’s hands...”

“Qin Yu? Is that the chaotic body you mentioned?” The old man beside him asked.

Hui Ming narrowed his eyes and said, “That’s right.”

“If we can use the chaotic body to revive the ancestor, then the ancestor will be invincible in this world!” Hui Ming said coldly.

At this point, anger flashed across Hui Ming’s face.

He took a deep breath and said, “Unfortunately, we can’t subdue Qin Yu for the time being, so we can only use this holy body temporarily.”

The holy body referred to the male corpse lying in the center of the array platform.

Originally, Hui Ming had prepared this corpse for himself.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t find a better body to resurrect the ancestor, so he could only bear the pain and give up this holy body.

“It’s all Qin Yu’s fault for delaying the resurrection plan for so long! If we had the stone statue, the ancestor would have been resurrected long ago!” Hui Ming said angrily.

“If the ancestor is resurrected, we won’t have to cower here in fear!”

The more Hui Ming spoke, the angrier he became. He couldn’t help but emit a terrifying internal qi.

Under this internal qi, the entire valley was buzzing!

Xiao Yu was even shaken until blood flowed out of her orifices. Her face was deathly pale.

“It doesn’t matter. After the ancestor is resurrected, we can seize Qin Yu’s body.” The elder beside him said.

Hui Ming nodded and said in a sullen voice, “This is the only way.”

“Sect master, it’s best that we don’t waste any more time in case anything unexpected might happen.” Someone beside him reminded.

Hui Ming nodded and said in a low voice, “Everyone, retreat and activate the revival formation!”

As soon as he said that, the eight elders flew up and sat in eight positions of the formation!

As for Xiao Yu, she was brought to a furnace.

The furnace was extremely cold. The moment it touched Xiao Yu, she felt like it was going to suck her body dry!

Xiao Yu only felt extreme pain, and her entire body was in excruciating pain!

The cold chill caused Xiao Yu’s consciousness to become somewhat blurry.

However, her strong desire to survive allowed her to maintain her consciousness.

“I don’t want to die...” Xiao Yu muttered in a low voice. Her lips had already turned pale. As her mouth squirmed, cold air flew out.

“Formation, rise!” Hui Ming roared angrily! The eight elders activated their spells at the same time!

The entire formation erupted with a sky-piercing radiance in an instant!

The radiance pierced through the valley and shot straight into the sky!

As the formation was activated, the dark energy in Xiao Yu’s body was rapidly extracted!

Even Qin Yu couldn’t endure such pain, let alone Xiao Yu?

“I’m in so much pain... so much pain...” Xiao Yu’s eyes were filled with tears.

She wanted to struggle, but she found that she didn’t have any strength at all.

“Qin Yu, when are you going to save me...” Xiao Yu’s face was full of despair, and her vision began to slowly darken.

“It seems... I’m really going to die here...” Xiao Yu couldn’t take it anymore. Her eyelids fluttered, and the light in her eyes began to dim.

Just as Xiao Yu was about to faint, the light of a sword rose from the sky and cut through the valley!

Under the Spiritual Energy Sword, a huge hole was created in the cave!

However, the terrifying Spiritual Energy Sword didn’t disappear! Instead, it landed on the Resurrection Formation!

“Oh no!” Hui Ming’s expression changed. He leaped into the air and quickly dodged!

The eight elders didn’t dare to be negligent. They shot to the side almost at the same time!

The formation stopped at that moment.

Hui Ming’s expression was extremely cold, and he was filled with anger!

“Who dares to ruin the Great Plan of our Earth Fiend Valley’s revival?!” Hui Ming raised his head and roared!

“Hui Ming, I didn’t expect you to hide in this kind of creepy place.” Qin Yu’s voice came from the door.

Hui Ming’s pupils dilated, and he hurriedly looked at the entrance!

Sure enough, Qin Yu and Jiang Gu were standing at the door.

“Qin Yu?” Hui Ming couldn’t help but feel stunned before he burst into laughter.

“Qin Yu, I was just worried that I wouldn’t be able to kill you. I didn’t expect you to come to my door of your own accord. Hahaha!” Hui Ming couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Qin Yu sneered. “Hui Ming, you’re about to die. How can you still be in the mood to laugh?”

“The one who will die is you!” Hui Ming said coldly.

“With your meager strength, you dare to barge into the Earth Fiend Valley?”

“Hui Ming, you almost killed my son. Today, I will make you pay with your life!” Jiang Gu’s hair flapped in the wind and he gave off a murderous aura!

Hui Ming narrowed his eyes and said, “Just the two of you? An Inner Strength Master Hands, and a newly advanced Inner Strength Grandmaster?”
