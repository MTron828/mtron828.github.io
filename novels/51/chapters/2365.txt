2366 Power beyond Limits

Qin Yu smiled and said. Chang Mang’s holy body was not simple either.

In these 80 years or so, he probably could not even cultivate, but he still had such combat strength.

When he recovered his strength to the peak, he would definitely become even more terrifying.

“D*mn it, you freak! Even if I regain my strength, I still won’t be able to beat you. But I’ll still want to fight back when the time comes.”

Chang Mang grinned and hit his fists against each other, appearing extremely confident.

“This is a bottle of Heavenly Deity Pill and a bottle of Spirit-gathering Holy Pill. You can start cultivating in the Sumeru ring now. There might be a great battle later, and I need your help when the time comes.”

Qin Yu patted Chang Mang’s shoulder.

“Isn’t it just fighting? I like it.”

Chang Mang did not act pretentious and directly took the pills from Qin Yu’s hands.

At this moment, the surrounding space fluctuated, and an enormous treasure light enveloped the entire space.

After that, a diamond-like barrier enveloped the surrounding space. Qin Yu stared coldly in a specific direction.

Over there, dozens of figures slowly landed on the ground.

They were Yan Yunfan, Si Qianjing, Ni Wuxiao, Yao Xi, Teng Zixu, Ji Ao, and the elders of the Yun and Jiang families.

There were also some other accompanying elders. These people were all powerful and emanating suffocating spiritual energy fluctuations.

“Running away, huh? Why aren’t you running anymore? Country bumpkin, you didn’t expect we could traverse space and arrive here in your place in the blink of an eye!”

A cold smile appeared on Yao Xi’s face. The Yun family’s Traversing Divine Map could instantly tear space apart.

And with Hua Tian’s information, Qin Yu had no chance of escaping at all.

“Haha, all the nine great aristocratic families are here. You truly think highly of me.”

Qin Yu laughed heartily.

The nine great aristocratic families often went on a big scale every time. Previously, they even sent a Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator to exchange his life for his.

“It is important to know your limits. Do you think a piece of trash like you can own the things left behind by the Jee family?”

Ni Wuxiao did not hide his killing intent at all. Their Ni family and Qin Yu had been in a deadly enmity.

Qin Yu’s growth speed was too fast. This time, the Holy Lord of the family had ordered to kill Qin Yu in purgatory. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“You, Ni Wuxiao, ambushed me before I left the Holy Region and almost caused me eternal damnation. The elders of the Ni Family Patriarch also stopped me and Yan Ruoxue from leaving. I must kill you, Ni Wuxiao, today.”

Qin Yu stared at Ni Wuxiao with a calm expression.

“Qin Yu, I have a question. How did you undo the divine sense restriction? Was it related to the previous will?”

Ji Ao asked calmly. He did not seem to have any killing intent toward Qin Yu, but he was curious about it.

“Kill him! Arrogant brat, you’re still very arrogant even on the verge of death.”

Ni Wuxiao was the first to burst out. His Non-immortal Sword flashed with a destructive spiritual energy fluctuation and slashed down at Qin Yu’s head.

He went all out with his first strike!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu bent his body and punched out instantly, blowing up the sword energy.

In the blink of an eye, he had appeared before Ni Wuxiao.

With one hand bringing immense fluctuations, he directly seized the entire space.

The space where Ni Wuxiao was was crushed like a piece of bread, trapping him inside.

However, an enormous cosmic form appeared on his body. It was from the Ni family’s immortal scripture, Trancedence Beyond the Sky.

The cosmic form was like a benevolent Buddha. The moment the two hands supported, they withstood the terrifying force of Qin Yu’s palm.

Qin Yu’s entire body moved effortlessly, and he raised his fist high.

Hundreds of punches landed on the cosmic form, and countless cracks instantly appeared on it.

Ni Wuxiao’s face was full of fear. Almost every punch of his had reached the power of half-step heavenly might.

In other words, Qin Yu’s near-complete Glazed Holy Body could reach this level of strength even if it was just his physical strength.

You’re courting death!”

Seeing Ni Wuxiao in a disadvantageous position, Yao Xi immediately contacted the corpse of the Celestial Saint.

He navigated the corpse of the Celestial Saint to punch fiercely at Qin Yu’s head, but in an instant, a fire dragon that was tens of thousands of feet long surrounded him.

That fire dragon emanated a terrifying power of flames that even contained a trace of the Vermillion Bird’s might. Even Yao Xi was unable to break free for a moment.

Qin Yu threw a punch at the Transcendence Realm Beyond the Sky. It was another terrifying punch.

The Transcendence Realm Beyond the Sky exploded violently. Qin Yu’s face revealed a ferocious expression as he was about to stomp on the old man’s head.

Si Qianjing and the two elders of the Yun and Jiang families attacked together. At this moment, the nine great aristocratic families still stayed united.

The three attacks all contained the utmost power. Even Qin Yu, with the Glazed Holy Body, could not withstand them head-on.

“Qin Yu, let me help you!”

Jue Wu shouted and kicked away Si Qianjing’s attack and then used her body to block the Yun family’s elder’s attack.

A massive wound appeared on her body, but it healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Chang Mang and Elder Guai also stopped the elder of the Jiang family.

Qin Yu completely ignored the attacks of the remaining elders. Those attacks landing on his body could only cause him slight injuries at most.

Qin Yu punched another two punches, and four treasures with powerful internal energy surged from Ni Wuxiao’s body.

“I’ve told you, you must die today. No one can save you, old fart!”

“Brother Qin, please show mercy!”

Teng Zixu slashed out from behind.

“I’m just waiting for you.”

Qin Yu did not stop at all. His left palm grabbed the space, preventing Ni Wuxiao from escaping.

And his right hand threw out another punch, almost at the same time.

The Spiritualization Technique was activated, and the massive palm grabbed Teng Zixu’s saber.

Teng Zixu’s arm shook, turning from a slash to a swat. In an instant, dozens of saber light afterimages struck Qin Yu’s entire body.

Under Qin Yu’s Spiritualization Technique, the terrifying Sea of Soul surged.

The two divine sense figurines also threw dozens of punches to meet Teng Zixu’s saber shadow. From the divine sense spirit bead, dozens of extreme divine lights surged into their fists, and the internal qi of the fists formed by the Spiritualization Technique surged.

It actually reached the power of half-step heavenly might and blocked Teng Zixu’s saber light.

At this moment, Ni Wuxiao’s face was full of tremendous fear.

All of his protective treasures had been destroyed. With another punch, his soul would be destroyed.

He burned his blood essence, and a shocking force surged out of his hand, trying to push Qin Yu’s hand away.

Qin Yu’s chaotic power surged throughout his body, and a tremendous force erupted from his body once again. He then steadied his hand and grabbed Ni Wuxiao.

Behind him, Teng Zixu had already drifted to the back of his head.

He knelt on the ground, and a shocking saber intent surged from his body. This saber intent instantly reached the realm of half-step heavenly might.

However, what shocked Qin Yu was that the power of the saber intent was still soaring wildly.

Soon, the saber intent far exceeded the power of the half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage.

However, the sky was cloudless, and there were no signs of backslash of the Path of Heaven at all.

“Why?”

Qin Yu’s face revealed an incomparably shocked expression.

The Path of Heaven would backslash on all sources of power that exceeded the limit. Otherwise, Yun Zhilan would not have died instantly. However, at this moment, Teng Zixu had gone beyond this restriction.
