Chapter 1493: Chapter 1,493, smallpox of all creation 1 

Upon hearing Jue Wu’s words, Qin Yu came to a sudden realization.

“Don’t forget, you are also Wen Wanye’s disciple. You have to win glory for Wen Wanye,”said Jue Wu.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and nodded. “I understand.”

“Follow me to the cultivation room,”said Jue Wu.

Therefore, Qin Yu followed behind Jue Wu and walked all the way to the cultivation room.

Sitting in the cultivation room, Jue Wu raised her tender little hand and patted Qin Yu’s back.

A warm current instantly surged into her body.

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “What are you doing?”

Jue Wu said, “I’m transferring the Spiritual Qi to you first. This thing isn’t particularly useful in my body.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned.

The Spiritual Qi in her body wasn’t particularly useful? How was this possible? One had to know that this was the foundation of a cultivator? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Just as Qin Yu was in doubt, the dense and majestic spiritual Qi had already surged into her body.

Qin Yu felt extremely comfortable. The Spiritual Qi that surged out of Jue Wu’s body seemed to have been processed. He did not feel the slightest discomfort. He only felt that his body was warm.

And the amount of spiritual Qi that Jue Wu transported was extremely huge. It surged into her body like a vast ocean.

This could not help but surprise Qin Yu. He even wanted to stop it.

However, Jue Wu did not have any intention of stopping. After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu felt that the spiritual Qi in his body was already filled to the brim and could not flow any further into his body.

“It’s about time.”Jue Wu took her hand away.

She patted her small hand and said, “This spiritual Qi should be enough to support you to use my spell. I will now begin to teach you the spell.”

“This spell is called the sky flower of all creation. I accidentally obtained it in a mystic realm. Back then, I only used three hours to comprehend this spell. As for how long it will take you, I don’t know.”

Qin Yu nodded. He knew that Jue Wu’s talent was extremely high, and her cultivation method was quite special. Therefore, Qin Yu did not find it strange that anything strange happened to her.

Then, a light flashed between Jue Wu’s eyebrows and went straight to Qin Yu’s eyebrows.

In a moment, a small figure appeared in Qin Yu’s mind. This small figure was exactly what jue Wu looked like.

Jue Wu glanced at it and then frowned.

She looked at the sleeping iron egg and muttered, “Why is there a man?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “It’s a long story. He is...”

“Ah, forget it, forget it. I’m not interested.”Jue Wu waved her hand and interrupted Qin Yu.

Then, she began to demonstrate this technique for Qin Yu.

Using divine sense to evolve this technique was also using divine sense to comprehend.

This speed was much faster.

Jue Wu was not stingy. She taught all the tricks of the all creation smallpox to Qin Yu and demonstrated it in Qin Yu’s mind.

With a shake of her hands, an extremely huge radiance flashed behind her back.

The light tiger was like a peacock spreading its tail. It was dazzling and awe-inspiring!

Compared to the phenomenon displayed by the first elder, the all creation smallpox was many times stronger!

Such a huge radiance almost covered jue Wu’s small body. At a glance, she could not even see a person!

Then, Jue Wu’s body shook violently, and the radiance slowly disappeared behind her.

“I’ll give you a simple demonstration. The rest will be up to you to comprehend,”Jue Wu said after she finished teaching.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I got it.”

Jue Wu calculated the time and said, “There are still four hours before dawn. It should be about the same. After all, you still have some talent.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I will try my best.”

After saying that, Jue Wu left Qin Yu’s mind and returned to her original body.

She stood up and glanced at Qin Yu, saying, “You have to work hard for me tomorrow. Otherwise, I will not let you off easily when I come back.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I will definitely beat him.”

Jue Wu grunted in gratitude and turned to leave.

However, she had only taken two steps when she ran back.

“Oh right, I have to tell you about Yongji,”Jue Wu said with a serious expression.

“Yongji has a spell that is not weaker than the all creation smallpox. Rumor has it that it was also obtained from a Holy Land.”

Qin Yu pricked up his ears and waited for Jue Wu’s follow-up.

“This spell is called the three elements holy palm. This palm technique is like a wave. Every time it is struck, the power will be stacked. Rumor has it that when using the three elements holy palm, it can even destroy a city,”Jue Wu said with a serious expression.

“Three elements holy palm...”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice and silently memorized this name.

“Also, the sky flower of all creation requires extremely dense spiritual qi, so you can only use it once at most. Therefore, you have to ensure that you can kill Hua Zi with this technique. Otherwise, your spiritual Qi will be depleted and you will be unable to fight anymore,”Jue Wu said.

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization. No Wonder Jue Wu had sent so much spiritual Qi to Qin Yu.

“Okay, I got it,”Qin Yu replied.

Jue Wu didn’t say anything more. He turned around and returned to the pavilion, continuing to drink.

Looking at Jue Wu’s cheerful appearance in the pavilion, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little envious.

This kind of cultivation method really made others envious.

Then, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time and began to comprehend this technique.

He first demonstrated it in his mind many times. After making sure that he had almost comprehended it, he stood up and cast this technique.

The first time he cast the technique, there was a hole behind him.

The second time he cast the technique, there was a ray of fluorescent light that was extremely weak.

The third time, the fourth time, the fifth time... When it was the eighteenth time, there was finally a ray of light that was the size of a wing behind Qin Yu.

This kind of light was far inferior to the absolute dance. It was like the difference between the bright moon and the stars.

At this time, the sky was gradually brightening. This meant that almost four hours had passed.

“The absolute dance used three hours to comprehend this technique. It’s really... abnormal.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Then, he continued to try to cast this technique.

Thirty-eight times in a row. At the thirty-ninth time, Qin Yu was finally able to cast the sky flower of all creation on a similar scale. However, compared to the absolute dance, it was still too far away.

“Damn, the gap is too big.”Qin Yu felt the flickering light behind him and could not help but feel a little annoyed.

“How is it?”

At this moment, Jue Wu also ran over.

When she saw the light behind Qin Yu, she nodded with satisfaction and said, “Not bad, you really have some talent.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Is this still considered not bad? Compared to yours, the gap is really too far...”

Jue Wu glared at Qin Yu and said, “Nonsense. This art is linked to spiritual qi. I’m in the mighty realm, and I can step into the reversion void stage at any time. You’re just a small nascent soul stage cultivator, and you’re not satisfied yet.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “In other words, I’ve comprehended this art?”

Jue Wu nodded and said, “Of course! This art is enough to fight against that Hua Zi. If it were like me, then the one fighting wouldn’t be that Hua Zi, but Yongji himself.”
