Chapter 36: This Slap Is Payback Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The crowd burst out laughing, and the villa was filled with boisterous laughter.

Shen Tian appeared to be extremely pleased with the situation.

He gave Qin Yu a provocative look and said, “Gee, it’s really hard for me to imagine that a man can live such a humiliating life!”

“Yes, to be cuckolded for three years and still having to put up with it is too pathetic.”

“Qin Yu really lives a sh*tty life and is too spineless.”

The crowd’s mocking voices continued.

Looking at Qin Yu, Su Yan only felt a burst of pleasure!

With an icy expression on his face, Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head and said, “Su Yan, instead of being ashamed of yourself, you are proud of yourself? How do you manage to be so thick-skinned?”

Su Yan let out a light snort and said, “You are the one who should be ashamed, not me, so what do I have to be afraid of?”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to talk to this kind of person.

He immediately closed his eyes and paid no more attention to them.

There was clamor from all around the room, and these voices were no doubt interfering with Qin Yu’s state of mind.

But no one imagined that at this moment, Qin Yu was actually meditating.

Faced with such taunting and not to mention humiliation, maintaining composure was proving extremely difficult. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Therefore, the spiritual energy around Qin Yu coalesced and collapsed many times before coalescing and collapsing again. Drops of sweat trickled down his forehead.

It was obvious that it was now becoming extremely taxing for Qin Yu.

“You think that if you pretend that you can’t hear us, it means it’s not happening?” Shen Tian continued to jeer, and he wasn’t the only one. Almost everyone had the same look on their face, and some even took out their cell phones and took pictures of the scene to post on the Internet.

Qin Yu forced himself to remain calm as he opened the pores of his body and breathed in the spiritual energy from his surroundings.

A few minutes later, he finally started to calm down.

It was as if he couldn’t hear the sounds around him and was immersed in his own world.

Wisps of spiritual energy slowly flowed into Qin Yu’s body as he breathed in and out.

“This fool thinks he can act deaf if his eyes are closed?” When Shen Tian saw this, he couldn’t help but snort softly.

The white-haired young man by his side frowned a little because he had the feeling that something was off with Qin Yu’s breathing and exhalation, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it at the moment.

“Mr. Shen, Mr. Qin hasn’t even talked back, so why don’t you just forget about it?” Lei Hu rose and intervened.

Shen Tian sized up Lei Hu and said with a frown, “Who are you?”

Lei Hu hurriedly said, “My name is Lei Hu. I am Concordia Realty’s CEO.”

“Lei Hu?” Shen Tian pondered for a moment. Then he suddenly said with realization, “I remember now. You’re the famous punk in Jiangcheng, right?”

“Yes, yes.” Lei Hu was delighted and chuckled as he said, “I am surprised that you know about me. Mr. Shen, please do me a favor and let him go.”

Shen Tian said with a smile as he looked at Lei Hu, “You want me to do you a favor?”

As soon as the words left his mouth, Shen Tian slapped Lei Hu’s face!

A crisp slap resounded into everyone’s ears!

“Who the h*ll are you to have the nerve to ask me for a favor? A lowlife bastard like you really considers yourself important?” Shen Tian snickered.

Lei Hu’s face blushed with embarrassment.

Zhao Gang, on the other hand, was filled with glee.

He had asked Lei Hu to beat up Qin Yu in the past, but unexpectedly, Lei Hu did not do anything even after receiving the money.

Therefore, Zhao Gang had been holding a grudge against him for this.

When he saw Lei Hu suffering, he was naturally delighted.

Shen Tian reached out to give Lei Hu a couple of pats on the cheek and said in an indifferent voice, “Even a loser has the guts to demand attention? You want a favor, right? All right, kneel down and kowtow three times. I’ll grant you a favor then!”

After saying that, Shen Tian took a couple of steps backward and gestured for Lei Hu to kneel down.

Lei Hu’s expression was extremely unpleasant, and he was naturally unwilling to kneel down in front of so many people.

But if he didn’t kneel, Shen Tian would never forgive him!

“I’ll give you ten seconds, and if you don’t kneel down, I’ll break your legs,” Shen Tian said coldly.

“Kneel! Kneel! Kneel!” The people around them started to make a commotion, and the entire place was incredibly rowdy.

Lei Hu’s face was flushed, and he clenched his fists.

He gritted his teeth and wished he could kill Shen Tian!

“Are you going to kneel?” When he saw that Lei Hu wasn’t doing anything, Shen Tian’s expression became increasingly cold.

Lei Hu took a deep breath, and he said stiffly, “Mr. Shen. I... I’ll kneel.”

“That’s more like it.” Shen Tian smiled contentedly.

He waved his hand and gestured for Lei Hu to kneel down.

Lei Hu gritted his teeth, forcibly holding back the fury he felt bubbling inside as his legs slowly knelt toward the ground.

At the very moment his knees were about to make contact with the ground, a pair of hands suddenly grabbed him by the arms.

“Kneel for you? Are you worthy of it?” Qin Yu was holding Lei Hu with one hand, while his other hand swung toward Shen Tian!

With a crisp snap, Shen Tian’s lips cracked, and his lips were stained red with blood.

“This slap is payback on behalf of Lei Hu.” Qin Yu stated coldly as he looked at Shen Tian.
