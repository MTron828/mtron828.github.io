1876 The Legend of Flower Granny

“I’ve been here for more than a year,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“That long?” Zhao Wan’er was even more surprised.

“Mmm.” Qin Yu was about to say something when he suddenly felt someone looking at him.

He followed the gaze and found that it was from Flower Granny.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “Wan’er, does this Flower Granny have some mental illness? Why does she seem so strange?”

“Don’t say that about Flower Granny. She’s a very nice person.” Zhao Wan’er hurriedly shook her head.

“She’s a lovestruck person. It’s said that she ruined her future for her Dao companion. Otherwise, with her cultivation base, she would have had the chance to break through to the Tribulation Stage.”

After hearing what Wan’er said, Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly widened.

She had the chance to break through to the Tribulation Stage? What kind of genius was she?

For the sake of her Dao companion, she gave up that realm. She was indeed an infatuated lover.

“Don’t think that Flower Granny has become an old woman now. When she was young, she was a great beauty whose name shook the Holy Region.” Zhao Wan’er said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. Although Flower Granny was extremely old now, one could still see some of her former beauty in her features.

“Let’s not talk about this. You’re not representing Demon-slaying Peak in this competition, are you?” Zhao Wan’er asked.

“You’re right,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“Ah, it seems like we’ll probably meet again.” Zhao Wan’er blinked her eyes and said.

“You’re representing Flower Peak?” asked Qin Yu in surprise.

“That’s right.” Zhao Wan’er was somewhat proud.

Qin Yu sighed slightly and said, “Then I’m sorry, I promised the peak master that I would take the first place back. I’m afraid I can’t go easy on you.

“What are you saying? Why would I ask you to go easy on me?” Zhao Wan’er glared at him. “Besides, I’m very powerful now. You might not be able to beat me.

“That would be great.” Qin Yu spread his hands.

Qin Yu didn’t care about the title of number one. If he hadn’t promised the peak master, he wouldn’t even want to participate.

“Alright, I’m just joking. I believe that you’ll definitely get first place.” Zhao Wan’er blinked her eyes and said.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately nodded, “I also think so.”

“Hey, hey, hey, you should at least be modest.” Zhao Wan’er rolled her eyes.

At this moment, Flower Granny, who was not far away, waved at Zhao Wan’er.

“Alright, I won’t talk to you anymore. I’ll go to Demon-slaying Peak to find you when I’m free.” Zhao Wan’er stuck out her tongue and quickly returned to Flower Granny’s side.

After she left, Qin Yu did not stay any longer and immediately returned to Jiu Xiao and the peak master’s side.

He could not help but look at Flower Granny again. For some reason, Qin Yu felt uncomfortable when he saw Flower Granny’s hunched back.

“Flower Granny is a famous person in Thunder Courtyard.” The peak master at the side sighed.

“If she had not made that wrong decision back then, she might have even become one of the most powerful people in the Holy Region.

Qin Yu glanced at the peak master, shook his head, and said, “How do you know that’s the wrong decision? Everyone has their own choices.”

“That’s true,” the peak master said with a bitter smile. “But I just feel that it’s a pity.”

Qin Yu didn’t say much. He didn’t think that Flower Granny had made the wrong choice.

If it were Qin Yu or Yan Ruoxue, they would have made the same decision as Flower Granny.

At this moment, a young man in white walked over.

He went straight to Jiu Xiao’s side and smiled casually, “Jiu Xiao, long time no see.”

Jiu Xiao frowned slightly and did not say anything.

“I’m really sorry for eliminating you last time,” the young man in white continued. “I wonder how your strength is this year. Have you made any progress?”

Before Jiu Xiao could speak, the peak master smiled and said, “Nangong, Jiu Xiao will not be participating this time.”

“Jiu Xiao is not participating?” The white-robed young man called Nangong couldn’t help but be surprised.

“What, are you scared of me? Hahahaha!”

Just as Jiu Xiao was about to speak with a dark face, Qin Yu beat him to it and said with a smile, “I’ll be participating this time. Brother Jiu Xiao said that our Demon-slaying Peak has a lot of combat experience, so he doesn’t need to do it himself. Let me do it, in case you say that we’re bullying people.”

Jiu Xiao was stunned. He looked at Qin Yu in surprise, as if he did not expect Qin Yu to say that.

Nangong glanced at Qin Yu and said with a frown, “Who are you? Why have I never seen you before? Are you new here?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded and smiled.

“Hmph!” Nangong snorted and said, “You’d better pray that you don’t meet me. Otherwise, you’ll die a horrible death.”

After saying this, Nangong walked to the side. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

After he left, Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask, “Who is he?”

“He’s from Ethereal Peak. He’s always been at loggerheads with Jiu Xiao. The two of them have won each other at times, so they’ve never been on good terms.” The peak master said.

“Jiu Xiao, don’t worry,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “I’ll help you beat him up later.”

“If you lose to him, I won’t let you off,” Jiu Xiao said, rolling his eyes.

Qin Yu spread out his hands. He didn’t take Nangong seriously at all.

Not long after, people from the other main peaks also arrived.

At this moment, the peak master pointed at a young man and said, “That person is the No. 1 of Thunder Courtyard in recent years. His identity is not simple either. He came from the Si family, one of the nine great aristocratic families.”

...

Hearing the words Si family, Qin Yu suddenly felt a headache.

Damn, what a coincidence.

He rubbed his head and mumbled, “It seems that I have a deep connection with the Si family.”

“What?” The peak master asked.

“It’s nothing!” Qin Yu waved his hand. “If he’s from the Si family, why would he come to Thunder Courtyard?”

“Although he’s from the Si family, it doesn’t mean that the Si family doesn’t care about the resources in Thunder Courtyard. After all, this is the former residence of Immortal Emperor Lei.” Jiang Chen said. The peak master explained.

Qin Yu could not help but rub his temples and sigh.

“The Si family will be here to watch the battle today, right?” Qin Yu asked.

“Of course.” The peak master said.

“What if I beat him up?” Qin Yu mumbled. “The Si family will definitely not let me off.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the peak master rolled his eyes and said, “Don’t talk big. You might not even have the chance to meet him.”

...

Qin Yu didn’t say a word, but his eyes unconsciously looked in the direction of the lad from the Si family.

The lad seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s gaze. He narrowed his eyes and suddenly walked toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and knew that something was wrong.

The lad quickly came to Qin Yu. He looked at Qin Yu arrogantly, then frowned and said, “Chaotic body?”
