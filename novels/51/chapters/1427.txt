Chapter 1428: Chapter 1,428, Vajra Ant 1

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I feel alright. It’s quite exciting.”

Fang Fang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and laughed out loud, “Not bad. When I first entered the Green Rock Forest, I was not as relaxed as you. Your mentality is really not something an ordinary person can compare to.”

“Yu Qin, don’t underestimate this Green Rock Forest. These few wolves are just appetizers,”someone beside him added.

Qin Yu grunted and took this opportunity to ask, “Guys, have you heard of the Flying Spider?”

“Flying Spider?”The few of them looked at each other and shook their heads. “I’ve never heard of this name.”

Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Sure enough, it was not so easy to find a demon beast that had life energy.

Then, the group continued to walk into the depths of the green rock forest.

They also had a map in their hands. As for the borders of the Green Rock Forest, they were extremely secretive, afraid that they would accidentally enter the restricted area.

At this moment, Fang, who was not stopping, suddenly stopped in his tracks.

He looked ahead, his eyes flashing with excitement.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He activated his desolate god eyes and looked ahead.

He saw an extremely huge demonic beast in front of him. This demonic beast was like an enlarged version of an ant. The black glow on its body was as if it was plated with a layer of armor.

On that arm, there were barbs that were as sharp as blades. The teeth that were exposed were as tough as black steel.

“Brothers, we have encountered a treasure.”Fang Fang licked his lips and said with some excitement.

“This beast is called the Diamond Ant. It is said that the entire body of the diamond ant is filled with treasures. Its blood can be used for medicine, and its armor can be used to refine weapons. Most importantly, its inner core. It is said that its inner core is the main ingredient for refining power-storing pills! The price is extremely expensive!”

After hearing Fang Fang’s words, the expressions of the other people also became somewhat excited.

“It seems that this trip was not in vain. I really didn’t expect to encounter such a demonic beast the moment I entered Qingyan Forest,”someone said from the side.

Fang Fang nodded slightly, and then he said in a deep voice, “But don’t be happy too early. This beast is extremely ferocious. It’s best to be careful.”

The few of them hummed in gratitude. They clearly had many team experiences, so they quickly got into position.

Qin Yu looked at the diamond ant, but his eyes didn’t show much emotion.

Although the diamond ant was indeed extraordinary, it was nothing compared to the Demon Beasts Qin Yu met.

“It’s really strange. These demon beasts are at least in the nascent soul stage, but they don’t have any intelligence,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

This kind of situation could only be seen in the green rock forest.

If it were an ordinary demon beast, it would have a mind that was no weaker than a human being when it stepped into the nascent soul stage.

“Hiss!”

At this moment, the diamond ant moved!

Its target was not Qin Yu, but Fang!

Fang’s face changed slightly. He took out his treasured blade and dashed backward in a hurry. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

His black feet, which were as sharp as blades, stabbed into the ground fiercely and then continued slashing toward Fang!

A long line of marks was immediately drawn on the ground. The extremely fast speed made Fang look extremely miserable.

Just as the black foot was about to land on his body, Fang pulled out his treasured blade and fiercely met it.

The enormous force directly forced Fang back dozens of steps!

“Quick, hurry up and make your move!”Fang shouted anxiously.

The other three didn’t dare to delay. As if they had come up with a plan, one of them took out a long hammer and threw it at the Diamond Ant!

“Dang!”

The long hammer hit the outer shell of the diamond ant and immediately produced a deafening sound!

The diamond ant that had suffered this blow was instantly enraged. It turned around and charged towards the attacker!

“Swoosh!”

In almost an instant, the vajra ant had already arrived in front of it. Its thick and strong legs lashed out fiercely!

“Bang!”

This blow was extremely powerful and directly sent it flying!

Fortunately, the sharp blade on its black feet did not cut its body. Otherwise, the attacker’s body would have been torn into two halves!

Faced with the crazed vajra ant, Fang Fang’s expression turned somewhat ugly.

The four of them struggled to face the diamond ant, looking extremely pathetic.

Whether it was the treasured blade in Fang Fang’s hand, or the long hammers and broad axes of the other three, none of them could break through the Diamond Ant’s defense!

“No, this Beast’s shell is too hard. With the weapons in our hands, we can’t hurt him at all!”Fang Fang said coldly.

“If this goes on, we won’t be able to do anything to him even if we run out of spiritual power. At that time, we’ll probably become his abdomen!”

Thinking of this, Fang Fang made a prompt decision and said coldly, “We’ll think of a way to tie him up and find an opportunity to pierce through his lower abdomen.”

Then, Fang Fang flipped his palm and a few black chains fell into his hand.

He grabbed the chains, and then suddenly rushed toward the diamond ant.

“Come on, Beast, I’m Here!”Fang roared. He swung the chains in his hand and rushed toward the diamond ant at an extremely fast speed.

But the diamond ant would not sit still and wait for death. He waved his black feet and slashed toward Fang.

Fang hurriedly turned his body, and the black feet brushed past his forehead and flew over.

“Bang!”Before Fang Fang could react, another black foot had already slapped his back.

Qin Yu, who had been watching the battle, could not help but frown.

If this continued, Fang Fang would probably die here.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu no longer watched. He immediately walked towards the Vajra Ant.
