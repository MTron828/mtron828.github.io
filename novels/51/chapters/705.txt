Chapter 706: The Conditions of the Hong Yi Sect Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The moment they stepped into the Mystic Realm, the surrounding environment suddenly changed drastically.

As the few of them stepped into the Mystic Realm at the same time, the entrance immediately began to close.

Qin Yu scanned his surroundings and discovered that the environment of this so-called Mystic Realm wasn’t much different from that of the outside world.

However, the spiritual energy in this Mystic Realm was indeed more abundant.

Besides that, Qin Yu could feel traces of an ancient and simple aura in this Mystic Realm.

Obviously, this Mystic Realm had existed for many years.

“Mr. Qin, how is it?” Ning Kun said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “It’s not quite what I imagined.”

“Let me show you around,” said Ning Kun.

Then, Ning Kun led the way and strolled around in this Mystic Realm.

This Mystic Realm wasn’t big, but the space was quite stable. It wouldn’t collapse.

As for the Mystic Realm, apart from the internal spiritual energy that had been left over from many years ago, there was also a trace of a different aura.

This kind of aura was very magical. It was a bit like the feeling brought by the Three Pure Ancient Tree.

Under the environment of the internal spiritual energy, the entire Mystic Realm’s environment was extremely beautiful.

The beautiful scenery made people look forward to it.

“To actually be able to create such a space, there must be experts in the Hong Yi Sect.” Qin Yu sighed.

To create a space for themselves, what kind of method was that?!

“Mr. Qin, you think too highly of us.” At this moment, Ning Kun shook his head.

He smiled and said, “This kind of Mystic Realm isn’t something that we can create. It’s all left behind by our ancestors.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment. That was true.

Such a stable space would probably require the help of a mighty figure.

If the Hong Yi Sect had a mighty figure, they wouldn’t need to fear the authorities.

Ning Kun brought Qin Yu to a villa.

“Mr. Qin, you can stay here for the time being,” said Ning Kun.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No need. I still have something to do. I won’t stay here for too long. I’m leaving today. Let’s discuss some serious matters.”

Ning Kun said with some surprise, “So soon? Alright then. Mr. Qin, this way please.”

The few of them came to a hall.

In the hall, there were more than ten people sitting upright.

These ten people didn’t look friendly, and there was killing intent on their bodies.

“You are Qin Yu?” At this moment, a man stood up.

Qin Yu looked at him and said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner. “Yes, what about it?”

“Do you know who I am?” The man continued to say.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “Does who you are have anything to do with me?”

“Hahahaha!” The man immediately burst into laughter.

“You have done a lot of great things using my name.” The man’s palm shook, and a long sword fell into his hand.

“Using your name?” Qin Yu frowned.

From the man’s attire, Qin Yu seemed to have guessed something. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You are Ancestor Guan?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

“That’s right!” The man stabbed the long sword into the ground and said coldly, “I am Ancestor Guan. You took my name and did something improper. Shouldn’t you apologize to me?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Ancestor Guan seemed a little strange.

According to Qin Yu’s knowledge, Ancestor Guan and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had never been on good terms.

If someone used his name to deal with his enemy, Ancestor Guan should be happy. At least, he shouldn’t be angry.

Ancestor Guan looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “What? Don’t you understand what I’m saying?”

“I’ve never said that I’m Ancestor Guan. Moreover, I don’t know you at all,” Qin Yu said quietly.

Ancestor Guan shook the long sword in his hand and then said coldly, “Good! I heard that your swordsmanship is powerful. Then let me experience it!”

Before he finished his words, Ancestor Guan held a sharp blade in his hand and came straight for Qin Yu’s glabella!

The sharp and crafty sword light stabbed ruthlessly at Qin Yu’s glabella!

Qin Yu’s expression changed. He immediately shot backwards explosively.

The sword ray missed and slashed onto the ground.

A long scar instantly appeared on the ground, and then the entire ground directly exploded!

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

“You want to kill me?” Qin Yu looked at Ancestor Guan coldly.

Ancestor Guan snorted coldly and said, “So what if I do? So what if I don’t?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He looked around.

The entire Hong Yi Sect seemed to have a strong hostility toward Qin Yu.

“Mr. Guan, Mr. Qin is our distinguished guest. You...” Su Qian hurriedly came out to smooth things over.

Ning Kun, who was beside him, also smiled and said, “Qin Yu, you have indeed caused great losses to the Hong Yi Sect, so they are unhappy. I hope you can understand.”

Qin Yu’s expression was cold and he did not say a word.

Ning Kun hurriedly smiled and said, “Take a seat.”

Qin Yu casually found a place to sit down. Then, he looked at Ning Kun and said, “Let’s get down to business.”

Ning Kun nodded and said in a deep voice, “The Hong Yi Sect has always appreciated talents. As long as you have the strength, we are willing to give you our resources.”

“Mr. Qin, if you are willing to join Hong Yi Sect, I think the Hong Yi Sect will agree to all your requests.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “It’s impossible for me to join the Hong Yi Sect. Everyone knows that the Hong Yi Sect is blacklisted by the officials. If I join you guys, I’m afraid I’ll have to go into hiding too.”

“That’s true.” Ning Kun wasn’t surprised.

He smiled nonchalantly and said, “What if Hong Yi Sect can help you save Yan Ruoxue?”

“Save Yan Ruoxue?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, and the expression on his face became somewhat unnatural.

Ning Kun nodded and said, “That’s right. I think you’ll be tempted by this condition.”

Qin Yu’s brows furrowed even more tightly.

Just as Ning Kun said, Qin Yu was indeed tempted.

Everything he did was to save Yan Ruoxue.

If the Hong Yi Sect could really save Yan Ruoxue, what reason did Qin Yu have to refuse?

After a moment of silence, Qin Yu took a deep breath, shook his head, and said, “I don’t believe that you have the ability to save Yan Ruoxue.”

“Hahaha!” Ning Kun immediately laughed when he heard that.

He stood up and said, “It’s true that we can’t save Yan Ruoxue, but if you and I cooperate, we can definitely save her!”

“Cooperate?” Qin Yu was somewhat puzzled.

“How?”

Ning Kun said with a nonchalant smile, “There is only one way to save Yan Ruoxue, and that is to enter the Mystic Realm of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. As long as we enter the Mystic Realm, we can take Yan Ruoxue away.”

“Mr. Qin, you only need to find the location of the Mystic Realm. At that time, we will send people to help you open the Mystic Realm and take her away. What do you think?”

Ning Kun’s words moved Qin Yu somewhat.

He looked at Ning Kun and frowned. “Is what you said true?”

“It’s absolutely true. As long as you can find the location of the Mystic Realm, we will be able to take her away.” Ning Kun drank a mouthful of tea and said nonchalantly.
