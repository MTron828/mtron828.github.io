Han Meng said in a deep voice, “That’s right.”

When he heard the name Ma Hai, a cold smile appeared on Han Wei’s face.

“With Mr. Ma’s help, Qin Yu will definitely die!” Han Wei said coldly.

Ma Hai’s strength was unimaginable. Not only that, but he was also extremely good at scheming.

It was said that a few decades ago, he had the opportunity to compete with Jiang He and the others. However, for some unknown reason, he suddenly chose to live in seclusion.

Now, he came out of seclusion for Qin Yu!

...

Qin Yu waited in Cangzao City for three whole days, but Gu Canghai never left the Saint Confucian Sect.

This also made Qin Yu lose the chance to go to the Spiritual Spring again.

“It seems that there is no chance to absorb the Spiritual Spring,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he decided to give up temporarily.

The Spiritual Spring was there anyway, and no one could take it away.

‘I have to think of a way to open that gap as soon as possible,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

As long as he opened that gap, Qin Yu had full confidence to step into the Martial Marquis Realm!

On the same day, Qin Yu set off and went straight back to the Green Moon Villa.

At the same time, he notified Zhen Yue and called all the people of the Green Moon Villa back to the Green Moon Villa.

Not only that, but Qin Yu also posted the address of the Green Moon Villa on the Martial Arts Forum!

“As long as you have talent, the Green Moon Villa will let you live with dignity!”

“All members of the Green Moon Villa will get a top-tier pill!”

Countless slogans were posted on the Martial Arts Forum.

“Mr. Qin, won’t the people of the Saint Confucian Sect come to us again?” Zhen Yue couldn’t help but ask.

Qin Yu glanced at Zhen Yue and said, “Yes.”

“Then... then aren’t we courting death by coming back?” Zhen Yue frowned.

Qin Yu sighed and didn’t say anything.

The Saint Confucian Sect had their eyes on Iceheart Lake, so they would come sooner or later.

This time, Qin Yu didn’t plan to leave. He was ready to face Gu Canghai.

This was the only way to make Zhen Yue feel danger. When that time came, she would tell Qin Yu the way to open the gap.

In the next few days, the quiet Green Moon Villa welcomed countless people.

These people came because of the post. In just a few days, the members of the Green Moon Villa had reached nearly a hundred!

Such speed was shocking!

Even Qin Yu didn’t expect his appeal to be so strong!

“Mr. Qin, I counted that at least fifty people came to register today!” Zhen Yue said excitedly.

Qin Yu took a sip of tea and said with a nonchalant smile, “This is just the beginning.”

Zhen Yue looked extremely excited. She had never thought that such a day would come for Beaufort Tower.

That night, Qin Yu didn’t sleep for the whole night.

He spent the whole night refining a batch of pills.

These pills were called the Divine Energy Pill. The effects of this pill were extremely powerful. It could raise the level of martial artists below the Martial Marquis realm by a small level!

The next day, Qin Yu handed the Divine Energy Pill to Zhen Yue with bloodshot eyes.

“Mr. Qin, what’s wrong with you? Why do you look so pale?” Zhen Yue exclaimed.

Qin Yu didn’t answer this question. Instead, he handed a big bag of Divine Energy Pills to Zhen Yue.

“Divide these pills among each of you. Also, tell them that there will be an endless supply of pills in the future,” Qin Yu said.

Zhen Yue took the pills, and her heart ached a little.

“Mr. Qin, thank you for your hard work. You... you should go rest now,” Zhen Yue said.

Qin Yu waved his hand. He didn’t choose to rest. Instead, he went straight to the Iceheart Lake and came to the bottom of the lake again to absorb the spiritual energy from the gap.

After the pills were distributed, the whole Green Moon Villa was in an uproar!

“Mr. Qin really didn’t lie to us!”

“Divine Energy Pill! I never thought that I would be able to obtain a Divine Energy Pill!”

“Mr. Qin is so impressive!”

Everyone shouted in unison. Not only that, but Qin Yu even invited them to head to the Iceheart Lake to cultivate.

Some people were shocked by the resources.

One had to know that the Iceheart Lake was an existence comparable to the Saint Confucian Sect’s Spiritual Spring!

The Saint Confucian Sect’s Spiritual Spring was only given to highly talented martial artists. The mediocre ones simply didn’t have the chance!

But in the Green Moon Villa, everyone was equal. Everyone could enjoy the Iceheart Lake’s spiritual energy!

For a time, this matter was being publicized on the Martial Arts Forum.

Many martial artists who chose to wait and see also began to head towards the Green Moon Villa at this moment!

There were even some who chose to leave the Saint Confucian Sect and come to the Green Moon Villa!

In just a short week, the Green Moon Villa had become extremely prosperous, with over 300 members!

Although their strength couldn’t be considered elite, their strength was still not to be underestimated!

Some were happy, while others were angry.

At this moment, Gu Canghai’s face was ashen, and he was extremely angry. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Green Moon Villa...” Gu Canghai muttered this name.

The next second, he looked at Deng Sheng and said coldly, “Go and gather all the half-step Martial Marquises and peak Inner Strength Grandmasters of the Saint Confucian Sect.”

“Spread the word that the Green Moon Villa will be given three days. If it doesn’t disband, the Saint Confucian Sect will go out and destroy the Green Moon Villa!”

Deng Sheng didn’t dare to say anything and nodded immediately, “Yes, Sect Master.”

The news of the Saint Confucian Sect spread that day.

As soon as Qin Yu walked out of the Iceheart Lake, Zhen Yue ran to Qin Yu in a hurry.

She held her phone and said, “Mr. Qin, something bad has happened!”

“What’s wrong?” Qin Yu glanced at her.

Zhen Yue handed the phone to Qin Yu and said, “The Saint Confucian Sect has spread the word that they will give us three days to disband. Otherwise... They will destroy the Green Moon Villa!”

Qin Yu didn’t show any emotion on his face. Everything was under his control.

“Green Moon Villa is in chaos now. Many people have to leave after hearing the news...” Zhen Yue bit his lips and said in a low voice.

Qin Yu spread out his hands and said, “What can we do? The Saint Confucian Sect has a Martial Marquis. We are no match for them.”

“Then... then what should we do?” Zhen Yue was at a loss.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I don’t know either. We can only take it one step at a time.”

“If we can’t... We can only disband the Green Moon Villa. We can’t let so many innocent people die,” Qin Yu said.

“Besides... The Saint Confucian Sect has always wanted the Iceheart Lake.”

At this point, Qin Yu looked at Zhen Yue and asked, “By the way, do you have any descendants?”

Zhen Yue frowned and said, “I’m not married yet. How can I have descendants...”

“Then, when you die, the Iceheart Lake will definitely fall into the hands of the Saint Confucian Sect,” Qin Yu sighed slightly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Zhen Yue’s expression was extremely ugly.

She had been immersed in excitement over the Green Moon Villa’s rise for the past few days. Now that it was disbanded, she naturally couldn’t accept it.

Moreover... Qin Yu was right.

If she died, wouldn’t the Iceheart Lake become ownerless? Wouldn’t the inheritance that she had guarded for so many years be lost in her hands?

At the thought of this, Zhen Yue’s expression became even uglier.

She bit her lips, and a trace of blood immediately flowed out from her cherry lips.

“Instead of giving the Iceheart Lake to the Saint Confucian Sect, I might as well give it to Mr. Qin.” Zhen Yue seemed to have made a difficult decision.
