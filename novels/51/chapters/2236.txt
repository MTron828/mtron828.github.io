2237 Killing

“Spiritualization Technique! The demon fox’s soul has materialized. Be careful!”

Piao Ruoyun reminded him with a pale face. She felt she was destined to be in great peril today!

The terrifying aspect of the Spiritualization Technique was that its user could launch attacks at will. As long as one had a powerful divine sense, basically, no one could escape.

Qin Yu did not dodge. Under the cosmic form, a massive palm swept out and instantly broke the demon fox’s waist. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“You’re indeed capable.”

A rather lazy voice appeared in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The giant demon fox returned to its original state in a flash, and its arm suddenly expanded to more than two times its size.

The demon fox’s giant arm struck out at Qin Yu like lightning.

“Bang!”

Qin Yu suddenly crossed both hands to block this punch, and the ground beneath his feet made a sound as it failed to bear the burden.

Within a radius of a few hundred meters, the ground collapsed several meters downward, leaving no room for Qin Yu to catch his breath.

Another ten arms grew out of the demon fox’s back. Almost at the same time, another ten punches were thrown at Qin Yu.

The ground exploded, and dust filled the air. The terrifying force directly blasted a hole that was hundreds of meters deep.

Half of Qin Yu’s cosmic form was on the verge of collapse, and the blood and qi in his body surged.

This punch was equivalent to a strike from a True Saint cultivator. Even though Qin Yu’s body was strong, he could not take it.

“Is this the Spiritualization Technique? Does the soul have such a function?”

He was tremendously shocked.

He stomped hard on the ground, and his body appeared before the giant demon fox.

“Annihilation Space!”

A space that was dozens of meters wide enveloped the demon fox. Qin Yu punched out, and countless black flames instantly appeared on the demon fox’s body.

The six-tailed demon fox let out a shrill cry and disappeared shortly.

“The Space of the Way! How did a third-grade True Saint comprehend the Space of the Way?”

Piao Ruoyun’s eyes almost fell out of their sockets. The fifth grade of True Saint was a dividing line that marked a clear distinction. Before reaching the fifth grade, it was all about personal accumulation, while after the fifth grade, it was about comprehending the way, making one a top-notch martial artist of True Saint.

“Hehe, in my spiritual space, I am invincible. Your Annihilation Space is very powerful, but it’s too slow.”

A devilish voice sounded behind Qin Yu.

A small falcon stopped outside the Annihilation Space, and then it resumed its original giant fox form.

“Qin Yu, its soul can transform into countless fractions. It can restore to its original state as long as there are remnants. We must destroy all of its clones, or else this demon fox will be immortal.”

Piao Ruoyun anxiously reminded him. Previously, the four of them had almost died from exhaustion.

Suddenly, with a thought, Qin Yu’s hands swept across his forehead, and he unleashed the desolate divine eye.

He fixed his gaze on the demon fox’s movements.

Over a hundred giant fists slowly grew from its back, and its giant arms bent slowly as it accumulated power.

In the entire Water Mirror Space that was thousands of meters wide, the sky was full of giant fists. The aura of the entire world was suppressed to the extreme as if it was the scene before a thunderstorm.

“Qin Yu, you can’t resist this attack. I’m going to withdraw the Water Mirror Space and find the six-tailed demon fox’s body. Only then will we have a chance to escape! I hope that giant ape has already left.”

Piao Ruoyun said hesitantly.

“No, you continue to hold the Water Mirror Space. I can deal with this six-tailed fox.”

Qin Yu frowned and stared at the six-tailed fox.

Piao Ruoyun wanted to say something, but the six-tailed fox’s attack had already arrived.

“Boom!”

Fists fell like raindrops, and each strike made an explosion.

The ground shook even more intensely. The massive shock wave caused the giant ape outside the Water Mirror Space to be angry.

It let out an angry roar but kept turning around and could not find the exact location of the battle.

The Annihilation Space exploded in an instant.

Even the Space of the Way had a limit on how much power it could withstand.

In an instant, the locust tree shield was already blocking him.

The fists fell almost nonstop, one punch after another.

The locust tree shield was broken.

The cosmic form shattered.

The Saintly Body Technique shattered.

Qin Yu spat a large mouthful of blood. He stabilized the last of his Saintly Body Technique with all his might, and the desolate divine eye on his forehead stared at the giant demon fox.

The circulation of his divine sense and the usage of the sea of the soul slowly became clear in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“Go to hell, human cultivator!”

The six-tailed demon fox roared with a sinister smile.

Another seven or eight punches landed on the left side of Qin Yu’s body. His body was almost torn apart, and his internal organs and bones could be vaguely seen.

“Do you think I can never find your true body?”

Qin Yu said coldly. His body suddenly appeared in the front of a void, and the Fist of Destruction had already blasted out mercilessly.

“Screech!”

The six-tailed demon fox let out a shrill roar. The giant phantom in the sky disappeared and left only its enormous body rolling.

“This demon fox’s body is indeed weak!”

Qin Yu did not waste time and reached out directly to take out the demon fox’s inner core.

The pink inner core was full of spiritual power, and its quality was higher than that of ordinary six-tailed demon foxes.

“Qin Yu, quickly prepare to retreat! The demon ape outside has gone crazy and is breaking my Water Mirror Space!”

Piao Ruoyun’s face turned pale as she spat a mouthful of blood.

“To gain great rewards, one must be willing to endure difficulties and uncertainties! Wait for me for a while.”

Qin Yu suppressed his injuries and controlled the spatial energy in the Sumeru ring, sucking the bone cultivation water madly.

It was obvious how powerful this demon fox was. It possessed a large amount of bone cultivation water.

The bone cultivation water was even more than the amount Qin Yu had collected in a few days.

“I can’t hold on anymore!”

Piao Ruoyun’s face was ashen as she maintained the Water Mirror Space with all her might.

The Water Mirror Space trembled violently. Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he no longer dared to be greedy.

“Let’s go!”

Qin Yu pulled Piao Ruoyun over and stepped on the line word formula, turning into a stream of light and retreating toward the entrance of the seventh level.

The demon ape’s furious roar came from behind. Qin Yu seemed to be able to feel the terrifying shock coming from the air 10,000 meters away.

“That was close!”

After returning to the sixth floor, Qin Yu sat on the ground, his face pale.

He was severely injured this time. The cosmic form, the locust sree Shield, and the Saintly Body Technique were all shattered. If the demon fox weren’t too weak, he probably could not walk out of the seventh level of purgatory today.

“You still have the nerve to say that. If not because you were greedy, how did you get into such danger?”

Piao Ruoyun said as she panted heavily. Her long hair was wet, and sweat was dripping down continuously.

She was on the verge of collapse from maintaining such a massive Water Mirror Space.

“Your inner core!”

Qin Yu threw the inner core of the six-tailed demon fox to Piao Ruoyun.

“Hahaha, with this inner core, my cultivation will definitely advance! I still have to thank you!

Piao Ruoyun saw the inner core and felt the power of the soul contained within it. Her expression immediately turned overjoyed.

“Little girl, to gain great rewards, one must be willing to endure difficulties and uncertainties! Do you understand?”

Qin Yu snorted lightly.
