Chapter 1200: The 1200th Chapter, Invincible Divine Power 

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the fifth pillar of light had already risen from the ground.

Although the area covered by this pillar of light was not very wide, once it was completed, it would definitely bring about extremely terrifying consequences.

Ye Qing gritted his teeth. He wanted to bypass everyone and head straight for the Sky Blood Rainbow. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, how could he teng and the others give him the chance? In an instant, tens of thousands of spells blotted out the sky and covered the earth, shocking ye Qing to the point that he kept lifting up.

Under this spell, Ye Qing’s nine dragons divine art could no longer withstand it. The light began to dim, and then it shrunk until it completely disappeared.

“Bang!”

As he teng finished, ye Qing fiercely shot out. For a moment, who knew how many mountain rocks he ran and smashed before he finally stabilized his footsteps.

“Whoosh!”

He Teng’s figure shot out explosively and grabbed ye Qing.

He held ye Qing in his hand and coldly said, “War God? That’s just Bullsh * T.”

Ye Qing opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but he already had no strength left.

On the other side.

Qin Yu was speeding over.

Without spiritual energy, he could only rely on transportation.

Along the way, Qin Yu’s speed was extremely fast, and he soon arrived near the Heaven Gate.

He slightly closed his eyes and released his divine sense, covering his surroundings. The desolate divine eye also followed.

Very soon, Qin Yu locked onto the position of He Teng and the others.

He looked at ye Qing, who was on the verge of death, and his expression could not help but change.

“Whoosh!”

His body suddenly shot out. This huge impact left a huge crater on the ground.

At this time, he didn’t use any spiritual power at all, only relying on the power of his physical body.

He Teng grabbed ye Qing’s neck and slowly exerted strength in his hand, preparing to forcefully break ye Qing’s neck.

At this moment, a figure descended from the sky and crashed onto the ground like a meteorite!

This huge commotion naturally attracted everyone’s attention.

Turning around, they saw a man with a hat suddenly appearing in front of everyone.

“HM?”He Teng’s brows twitched.

He sized up the man in front of him and asked, “Who are you?”

“He Teng, I’ve been looking for you so hard. You Bunch of lowlifes have really gotten together again.”Qin Yu’s icy cold voice entered everyone’s ears.

He Teng’s expression changed drastically!

He was too familiar with this voice! To He Teng, this voice was like a nightmare!

“Qin... Qin Yu!”He Teng’s pupils shrank, his expression extremely ugly!

Qin Yu took off the hat on his head and threw it forward.

The pure strength of his body brought about a speed that almost surpassed the speed of sound!

The hat left a mark in the air and instantly closed in on he teng!

He Teng naturally didn’t dare to be negligent. He threw ye Qing aside and hurriedly shot backward!

At this moment, he Teng’s heart was already in a panic.

He couldn’t figure out why Qin Yu would suddenly appear here when he was already at the saint-level?

He Teng’s breathing was extremely irregular. Anyone could see his panic.

“You... You Didn’t go to the holy region at all!”He Teng said somewhat fearfully.

Qin Yu sneered, “If I had gone to the holy region, how could I have stopped you guys here today?”

Stopped Here?

One person surrounded more than twenty people? And there were more than twenty mighty figures among them?

These words were too arrogant!

“What are you afraid of him for? He’s only one person. Can he beat us?”A mighty figure sneered.

“That’s right. Right now, he, Qin Yu, is only one person. He’s not even worth mentioning.”

“The reason why we weren’t able to go to the holy region was all because of this kid. I was just thinking of seeking revenge on him!”

Qin Yu coldly swept his gaze over everyone and sneered, “Just based on a bunch of trash like you? When I was slaying the Tian sect, you guys also hid in the shadows to peek, right?”

“So what if we are, so what if we aren’t! We Won’t talk about moral rules with you.”A powerful existence sneered.

“That’s right! If the two of US attack together, killing you will be like slaughtering a dog!”

Only He Teng remained silent.

He was very clear in his heart that Qin Yu’s strength was even more terrifying than he had imagined!

Back then, Gu Xinghe had absorbed the strength of eight mighty figures, and in the end, he had lost to Qin Yu!

Moreover, those eight mighty figures were not reclusive mighty figures, but ordinary peak mighty figures!

“Everyone, please join forces and get rid of him!”He Teng shouted loudly.

He was fanning the flames by the side, but he didn’t want to make a move at all.

“I’ve long wanted to experience it.”A mighty figure walked over and raised his hand, using the void art from earlier!

He sealed Qin Yu within a narrow space, then once again used the void explosion art!

Boom

The Space Qin Yu was in instantly exploded! The smoke obscured everyone’s vision.

But when the smoke dispersed, that almighty expert’s expression changed.

The clothes on Qin Yu’s body had already been torn apart, revealing his jade-like physical body.

His body was spotlessly white. This void explosion technique actually didn’t even leave a white scar on his body!

“His physical body... seems to have become stronger again!”He Teng’s expression became extremely ugly!

The almighty expert who had attacked had his brows tightly knitted together.

Although he had expected that this technique wouldn’t be able to harm Qin Yu, he hadn’t expected that it wouldn’t even leave a single mark!

Just as everyone was shocked, Qin Yu suddenly stretched out his fist. “Bang Bang”, two fists smashed out at an extremely fast speed.

The sealed space directly collapsed, falling down like broken glass.

“If you don’t want to die too quickly, you’d better burn your blood essence. Blame me for not warning you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Yellow-mouthed child, don’t be so arrogant!”A mighty figure stepped out and raised his hand to cast the spell just now.

Pure spiritual power condensed on his fist, then poured out and headed straight for Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. After a sneer, he threw out two more punches at an extremely fast speed.

These two punches didn’t have the slightest spiritual power fluctuation. Except for the extremely fast speed, they were no different from ordinary people!

But it was these two extremely ordinary punches that directly pierced through that Almighty’s spell!
