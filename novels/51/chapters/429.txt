After Taozi sent the message, she didn’t receive any response.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that this was the first time Taozi sent a message to the Pavilion Master.

Because the Pavilion Master seemed too cold and distant, even if they knew her phone number, they didn’t dare to contact her.

Now, for the sake of Qin Yu, Taozi braced herself and sent a message.

Qin Yu didn’t know anything about this.

After he returned to his room, he couldn’t wait to open the Martial Arts Forum.

Sure enough, the Martial Arts Forum already had a video of Qin Yu fighting.

In this video, Qin Yu no longer seemed as invincible as before. Instead, he was retreating in defeat.

“He can’t even deal with three sixth level Inner Strength Grandmasters. Looks like Qin Yu is really injured.”

“This kind of hidden trauma is very difficult to get rid of. Even if he is lucky enough to recover, it will still affect his foundation.”

“It looks like the genius of the generation is about to fall.”

Countless comments flooded in like a tidal wave.

Qin Yu silently turned off his phone.

He laid on the bed as the corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

... . .

In a deep mountain valley in Pyro.

In an ordinary civilian house, there was a white haired old man who was currently recuperating.

“Master, Qin Yu’s dantian seems to have been damaged, and his power has been greatly reduced.” A disciple walked up to the old man.

The old man was none other than the famous Jiang He.

Shock flashed across Jiang He’s face, and it was even tinged with grief.

“Such a genius has fallen just like that. It’s truly a pity.” Jiang He sighed.

His disciple said from the side, “From ancient times until now, there have been many geniuses. However, after they understood the current situation, they all chose to act wisely to protect themselves.”

“However, Qin Yu doesn’t know how to restrain himself. He has repeatedly provoked the aristocratic families. With such actions, it would be strange if he didn’t fall.”

Jiang He glanced at his disciple. He stroked his beard and lamented, “It is precisely because everyone has chosen to protect themselves that the aristocratic families have become more and more powerful. Qin Yu’s arrogance is exactly what is lacking at the moment.”

When his disciple heard this, he was shocked.

He didn’t expect his master to value Qin Yu so much.

“Master, Qin Yu has a person by his side called Yao Qing. He pretended to be your disciple many times,” his disciple continued.

“Do you want me to warn him?”

Jiang He waved his hand and said, “I’m sorry that I can’t help him myself. It might be a good thing if it can indirectly help him.”

The disciple was confused.

He frowned and said, “Master, you don’t know Qin Yu. Why do you think so highly of him?”

Jiang He was silent for a moment.

Then he waved his hand and said, “I said that Qin Yu has something that society needs. Every time I see news about him, I will feel ashamed of my seclusion.”

His disciple opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Jiang He with a wave of his hand.

...

The news that Qin Yu was defeated by the three level six Inner Strength Grandmasters caused a great uproar.

Han Wei couldn’t stop laughing at this.

He immediately called Qin Yu and sneered. “Qin Yu, I heard that your dantian has been seriously injured and you can’t cultivate anymore?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “What does it have to do with you?”

Han Wei sneered. “It doesn’t have anything to do with me. It seems that I won’t be able to see you in three months.”

“That might not be the case,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“In three months, I will appear at the Han family on time.”

“Hahahaha!” Han Wei burst into laughter.

“Do you want to die? To be trampled under my feet in front of the woman you love? I really want to see this comical scene,” Han Wei said with a sneer.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any more time with him and immediately hung up the phone.

Jingdu, Yan family.

During this period of time, Yan Ruoxue had been placed under house arrest. Her people were all taken away. She could only read books and garden every day.

Those accompanying her were a pet dog named “Xiao Hua” and a group of servants who were responsible for serving her.

Other than that, there was no one else.

“Xiao Hua, do you want to eat too?”

Yan Ruoxue personally cooked a table full of dishes.

What was surprising was that all the servants were eating at the same table while eating the dishes personally cooked by the eldest daughter of the Yan family.

Only Xiao Hua, who was standing beside them, had its mouth open in anticipation. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yan Ruoxue smiled. She gently picked up Xiao Hua and said, “Since we can’t finish eating anyway, we’ll give you some.”

At this moment, the door of the Yan family was opened.

Not long after, Yan Sihai, who was wearing a coat, entered.

“The food is pretty good,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Hearing Yan Sihai’s voice, all the servants hurriedly stood up from the table. Their faces were filled with nervousness.

“Who told you guys to eat at the table?” Yan Sihai coldly glanced at the servants and said coldly.

“Mr. ... Mr. Yan, we... We know we’re wrong,” everyone said nervously.

Yan Sihai said coldly, “Why? Don’t you guys know your place?”

“I asked them to eat together,” Yan Ruoxue said from the side.

Yan Sihai glanced at Yan Ruoxue and snickered. “Just because she asked you guys to eat, you guys ate with her? Do you guys really think you’re human?”

“They are human to begin with,” Yan Ruoxue said with a displeased expression.

“Uncle, if you belittle others like this, sooner or later, you will also be belittled by others.”

Yan Sihai laughed and said, “Ruoxue, you are really naive.”

Yan Ruoxue wasn’t willing to negotiate with Yan Sihai, so she asked directly, “What’s the matter?”

“If not, I can’t come to see you?” Yan Sihai said with a nonchalant smile.

“As long as you appear, you will definitely bring bad news,” Yan Ruoxue said mercilessly.

Yan Sihai couldn’t help but laugh. He sat next to Yan Ruoxue, picked up the chopsticks and started eating.

“That bowl belongs to Xiao Hua,” Yan Ruoxue reminded him.

“Who is Xiao Hua?” Yan Sihai frowned slightly.

Yan Ruoxue immediately pointed at the dog barking beside her.

Yan Sihai’s expression instantly turned cold.

He threw his chopsticks to the side and said coldly, “You guessed it right. I came here to tell you bad news.”

“Qin Yu’s dantian has been damaged and he has become a cripple. Don’t expect him to come and take you away,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“Impossible,” Yan Ruoxue said without hesitation.

She didn’t believe Yan Sihai’s words at all.

Yan Sihai said indifferently, “I knew you wouldn’t believe me, so I have prepared evidence for you.”

After saying that, Yan Sihai took out his phone.

On the screen was the scene of Qin Yu battling the three Inner Strength Grandmasters and getting defeated.

Apart from that, Yan Sihai also opened the Martial Arts Forum and handed it to Yan Ruoxue.

“Did you see that? Do you think I control the entire Martial Arts Forum?” Yan Sihai lit a cigar and said indifferently.
