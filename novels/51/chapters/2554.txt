Chapter 2555 Heavenly Soul Jade in Hand

At this point, only Qin Yu’s body could absorb the energy of the Saint’s Seal of Heaven Returning.

He only slowly stopped after a long time.

At this moment, he looked in Chen Shuang’s direction with gratitude.

Although he had not recovered to his peak state, the Saint’s Seal of Heaven Returning had already unlocked the shackles that bound his body.

This shackle was the curse power after using the life and death brush.

The life force that he had been unable to replenish previously could now enter his body at this point. It was no longer isolated.

“The Judge’s Brush is a supreme treasure of the ghost race. It’s a miracle that you could survive after using it this time. Don’t use this treasure again unless you’ve reached the sixth level.”

Chen Shuang said softly, sitting on the futon.

A Heavenly Soul Jade appeared in his hand and then slowly landed on Qin Yu’s hand.

“This is the reward I promised you before.”

“Thank you, Sect Master Chen Shuang.”

Qin Yu cupped his fists and bowed, feeling somewhat touched.

Although he could not fully sense the Saint’s internal qi at the moment, it was obvious that after condensing the Seal of Heaven Returning, Sect Master Chen Shuang’s internal qi diminished significantly.

One could imagine how much resources he had spent on the Seal of Heaven Returning.

Qin Yu’s throat moved slightly. He still had many questions to ask.

However, seeing that aged figure, he could not say a single word.

“If you are interested, you can try to comprehend the sword intent in the Sword Sect before you leave. Your current strength is far from enough…”

A strand of divine sense entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. He left the hall, and Qin Yu hesitated for a while before returning to the previous peak.

At this moment, Shen Qian and the others were still waiting for him. Even if he was going to leave, he had to say goodbye to them first.

“Did Sect Master Chen Shuang make things difficult for you?”

“He gave me the Heavenly Soul Jade and helped me alleviate the aftereffects of using the Judge’s Brush.”

Shen Rou smiled bitterly and said. She seemed to have already received some news.

“Qin Yu, take good care… It’s time to return to the sect to report. We should be back soon.”

Zhang Xiang and Li Yang also cupped their fists.

“Why do I feel they’re hiding something from me, including Sect Master Chen Shuang? They seem to have many secrets they don’t want to tell me.”

Qin Yu carefully recalled what Sect Master Chen Shuang had said and suddenly felt he was making arrangements after his passing. This feeling made Qin Yu feel somewhat unsettled.

“Quickly give me the Heavenly Soul Jade!”

Suddenly, a hurried voice interrupted Qin Yu’s chaotic thoughts.

“Remember our agreement.”

Qin Yu placed the Heavenly Soul Jade into his body and the Heavenly Soul Jade turned into a stream of energy that landed on Immortal Emperor Yao’s hand.

Immortal Emperor Yao directly crushed this piece of Heavenly Soul Jade, and the internal qi within entered his soul. His soul became more substantial with a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Don’t worry… If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I seem to have recalled a lot of things after this soul condensed.”

Immortal Emperor Yao let out a hearty laugh. This Heavenly Soul Jade was too rare.

He did not see much of it, even at his peak. Now that he had obtained this soul’s supreme treasure, it would allow his soul to survive for a little longer.

Qin Yu again focused on the Seal of Returning Heaven in his body. This time, the Seal of Returning Heaven seemed to have formed an energy cycle in his body, giving him a sense of direct understanding toward Dao.

This balance encompassed the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects, allowing one to experience harmony and tranquility of both body and mind.

He felt a rare sense of balance in his mind. He delved into numerous classics and also embraced a portion of Daoist teachings.

Qin Yu carefully recalled the Daoist cultivation path he had browsed through before.

Daoism had always been a lineage dedicated to cultivation, attracting quite many cultivators.

The cultivators of the supreme dao techniques had already surpassed the limitations of mere cultivators, merging into the order and righteousness of the universe.

Regardless of their realm or power, they had surpassed the restraints of the mortal world. They possessed extraordinary wisdom and insight, and they could comprehend the mysteries and truths of the universe.

It was also the root of Zi Yang’s death. He saw too far and saw that dark Path of Heaven.

The Dao he believed in made him destroy the human race he protected.

Under such a huge blow, his dao mind was destroyed completely, and he was lost in the Misty Forest forever.

In the Misty Forest, the Path of Heaven of the human race and the monster race joined forces to kill Zi Yang of the human race. Was what he saw true?

Or was it because the human race’s Path of Heaven had declined and was suppressed by the power of the Path of Heaven of the other three races, which gave Zi Yang a false impression?

Qin Yu hesitated a while before throwing his question to Immortal Emperor Yao.

“It’s hard to say. With my current strength, not to mention the Path of Heaven, I can’t even spy on a Saint. The cosmic luck of the Path of Heaven changes rapidly, and both possibilities exist. However, judging from the current weak situation of the human race, these two possibilities are possible. If it’s the former, I suggest you join the other three races as soon as possible to give yourself a chance of survival.”

Immortal Emperor Yao laughed heartily as though he did not care about the life and death of the human race.

“You used to be the Immortal Emperor of the human race. Why didn’t you have any feelings for the survival of the human race?”

“Immortal Emperor has already jumped out of the five elements. Emotions are just a burden to us. Emotions are often obstacles to cultivation. Take this little guy for example. If he didn’t get too involved in the matters of the human race, he would probably overcome this knot in his heart and condense the divinity. Moreover, the current me, my soul has already lost most of its emotions. How to survive is what I’m thinking about now.”

“In that case, what’s the difference between you and a walking corpse?”

After a long time, Qin Yu muttered.

” In addition, I give you a suggestion. Leave this place as soon as possible.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Immortal Emperor Yao smiled strangely.

“Why?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“The price of one question.”

“Forget it then…”

He could only ask ten questions for the Heavenly Soul Jade he had risked his life to obtain. Every answer meant one less question, so he had to use it sparingly.

Suddenly, the entire Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect changed. A surge of power suddenly soared into the sky.

In the blink of an eye, a boundless light screen condensed and formed like silver ripples appeared in the air. This barrier was like an enormous round shield, emitting a gentle and persistent internal qi. It enveloped the entire mountain range of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect and isolated it from the outside world.

When the barrier took shape, the world suddenly became silent. All living things seemed to be holding their breaths in awe.

Ancient runes slowly appeared on the barrier. They flickered with a mysterious light like stars shining in the night sky.
