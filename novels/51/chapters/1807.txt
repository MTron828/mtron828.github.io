1808 The Ancient Divine Weapon

“It’s… the primordial spirit!” Qin Yu gasped!

How did Yang Yu collect so many primordial spirits?

Could it be he and Qin Yu were jackals of the same lair? And he also needed other people’s primordial spirits to cultivate?

Jue Wu and Qin Yu looked at each other, and Jue Wu said excitedly, “Aren’t you making a fortune now? With this, you no longer have to find that primordial spirits!”

Although she said so, Qin Yu was still a little worried.

Yang Yu was listed as one of the evildoers by Thunder Courtyard. Probably it was because of the primordial spirits he had collected.

From the method used, Yang Yu’s was absolutely superb and hard to detect.

Then how did Thunder Courtyard find out? And how did they list him as an evildoer?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu felt a chill down his spine!

“No,” Qin Yu’s face turned cold.

He couldn’t stay in Thunder Courtyard for long!

Even Yang Yu, who was far away in the Crimson Moon Continent, could not escape their eyes, let alone Qin Yu.

“After I find a way to get the Meridian Circulation Technique, I must leave Thunder Courtyard,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

If it was discovered by Thunder Courtyard, they would surely die.

“Let’s quickly leave,” Qin Yu said to Jue Wu.

Following that, Qin Yu put the magical artifact into his bag and quickly left Heavenly Ocean City with Jue Wu.

The night was dark, and it was pitch black.

Qin Yu hid the primordial spirits in the depths of the Spatial Magic Artifact to avoid being detected.

The two of them soon came to nearby the teleportation formation. As soon as they stepped into the formation, a bright light lit up and brought them back to the teleportation platform of Thunder Courtyard.

The entire process took less than ten minutes. When they opened their eyes again, they were already on the platform.

“Let’s go back to the cave abode and hide this magical artifact,” Qin Yu said to Jue Wu.

Jue Wu nodded and whispered, “You must not tell anyone about this, but you also don’t worry too much. Maybe Yang Yu being listed as an evildoer has nothing to do with his primordial spirit.”

“I hope so.” Qin Yu sighed.

The two of them returned to the cave abode. Fortunately, this cave abode was extremely large. It took Qin Yu and Jue Wu a lot of time to put away the magical artifact that carried the primordial spirits.

When they were done, the sky had started to slightly brighten up.

“If that’s the case, the points are still not enough.”

Jue Wu muttered as she sat on a big rock in the cave abode.

Qin Yu took out the token.

It was 89 points adding up the points in Jue Wu’s and Qin Yu’s tokens. It was only 11 points away from 100 points.

He only needed to go for one last mission to get the matter done.

“I hope the next mission will come soon,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Another day passed.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu decided to pay a visit to the dean to find out about the Glided Rake in Jue Wu’s hands.

The power of this Glided Rake was extremely terrifying. As no one knew about its origin, they could only seek the dean’s help.

However, Qin Yu felt a little uncertain about meeting the dean. He seemed to have a guilty conscience.

“Should I go by myself?” Jue Wu suggested.

“No, we’ll go together,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Sooner or later, he would have to face the dean. Moreover, he didn’t notice anything the last time.

That day, Qin Yu and Jue Wu came to the first main peak together.

The two men who blocked Qin Yu’s way previously showed up again.

They stopped Qin Yu and said in surprise, “You again?”

“Seniors, we’re here to visit the dean,” Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

“You want to see the dean?” The two of them looked at each other. “Why do you want to see the dean?”

“We need the dean to clear some doubts,” Qin Yu said.

“Then you guys wait for a while,” one of them said.

Then, his body directly disappeared into the void.

After about 10 minutes, he suddenly appeared again and stood in front of Qin Yu.

“Go in now. The dean is in the quiet room up there,” he said expressionlessly.

“Thank you,” Qin Yu bowed slightly and said.

Thus the two followed his guidance and came to the quiet room.

The quiet room was just like its name. It was extremely quiet.

There were wisps of green smoke floating at the door. When looking up, it was as if being in the clouds, like a fairyland.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu stepped into the quiet room. As soon as they entered, they saw the dean meditating.

His body was partly hidden and partly visible as if he was about to merge with the surrounding void. It was an extremely wondrous sight.

“Dean,” Qin Yu cupped his hands and greeted the dean.

Jue Wu also followed suit.

The dean opened his eyes slightly. He glanced at Qin Yu, and then his gaze fell on Jue Wu.

“Why are you looking for me?” The dean asked with a smile.

“Of course, it’s an important matter.” Jue Wu didn’t have the idea of respecting the elders. Even when facing the dean, she still had the same attitude.

She swaggered to the front of the dean and said mysteriously, “I got a treasure, a good treasure! I’m here today to show you!”

When Dean Lei heard this, he stroked his beard and laughed out loud.

With adoration in his eyes, he said, “Come over. Let me see what treasure it is.”

“I’ll show it to you, but you can’t snatch it from me,” Jue Wu muttered.

The dean was lost for words, and Qin Yu was also a little helpless.

“Don’t worry. Your things will always be yours,” Dean Lei laughed and said.

Jue Wu didn’t waste time and immediately took out her Glided Rake.

The moment it was taken out, a golden light flashed. There seemed to be a strange power flowing inside the Gilded Rake.

“Here it is,” Jue Wu said.

The dean took over the Glided Rake and examined it carefully.

His originally smiling eyes slowly became a little solemn. After a long time, he did not say a word.

Jue Wu frowned and said, “You don’t know what it is, do you? If you don’t, then forget it.”

Dean Lei raised his head and looked at Jue Wu. With a serious expression, he asked, “Where did you get this from?”

Jue Wu didn’t hide anything and immediately told Dean Lei everything.

Dean Lei squinted his eyes and said in a low voice, “Could it be that the rumors are true?”

“What rumors?” Jue Wu frowned and asked.

Dean Lei waved his hand. He grabbed the Glided Rake with both hands and then shook it slightly. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Glided Rake instantly turned silver, and its previous golden radiance disappeared without a trace!

Seeing this, Jue Wu was shocked.

“Where did you hide my Glided Rake? Why did you exchange it for a silver one?” Jue Wu said in shock.

Dean Lei shook his head and threw the Glided Rake to Qin Yu.

When Qin Yu took it, the Glided Rake turned black.

Such a wondrous scene was truly astonishing.

“What’s going on?” Qin Yu said with some doubt.

“You’re really lucky,” Dean Lei said with emotion. “If I’m not wrong, this is a divine weapon passed down from ancient times.
