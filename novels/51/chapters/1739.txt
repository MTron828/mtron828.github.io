Chapter 1740: Resurrection of Yuan Xiu

This day was destined to be an extraordinary day.

No one in the North Plain or Nanzhou could sleep well.

Tianyun Sect.

The Deputy Sect Master’s expression was grave. After the great change in the world, all the affairs of the Tianyun Sect, big and small, fell on his shoulders.

He was not very talented to begin with, and as a result, he had no time to cultivate. Even now, he had not been able to step into the Reversion Void Stage.

The Deputy Sect Master was a person who cared about the world. How could he sleep when Nanzhou was facing a disaster?

At this moment, an elder walked to the Deputy Sect Master’s side.

“Deputy Sect Master, it’s already so late, why aren’t you sleeping?” The elder asked.

“How can I sleep at a time like this?” The Deputy Sect Master shook his head.

“Deputy Sect Master, you look like you’re waiting for someone,” The elder asked in a probing manner.

The Deputy Sect Master glanced at him and nodded, “That’s right. I’ve sent people to the East Continent to ask for help these few days, and I’m waiting for the news now.”

“East Continent… That place is different from Nanzhou. I’m afraid that it will be very difficult to get them to take action.” The elder shook his head.

“Is there any other way?” The Deputy Sect Master sighed. “That’s the only way.”

The elder didn’t say anything more. He just stood to the side and quietly accompanied the Deputy Sect Master.

Time passed by, and it was soon the second half of the night.

It was already late at night, and the entire world was extremely quiet.

However, hidden beneath this tranquility were the restless hearts of countless people.

Just then, the door was pushed open.

A young man in a night suit quickly walked in.

Upon seeing the young man, the Deputy Sect Master hurriedly walked up to him.

“How is it?” The Deputy Sect Master asked urgently.

The young man shook his head and said in a deep voice, “I’ve visited many sects in the East Continent these days, but none of them were willing to get involved in this mess.”

The Deputy Sect Master couldn’t help but clench his teeth and say, “Didn’t you tell them the implications of this? If Nanzhou falls, the East Continent will be next!”

The elder next to him said in a deep voice, “The East Continent is not like Nanzhou. They have never had the idea of a republic. Every sect is an independent individual. Everyone’s consideration is the relationship of interests of the major sects. Moreover, they have never been willing to leave the East Continent.”

“Sigh.” The Deputy Sect Master let out a heavy sigh.

It was the same in Nanzhou back then, with various large sects and clans. It was only after the appearance of Xiao Sheng that the situation changed.

Now that no sect in the East Continent was willing to help, it would be difficult to survive this disaster.

“It’s said that Yuan Xiu will be completely resurrected tomorrow. I wonder who can resist him.” The Deputy Sect Master sighed.

No one said anything. The terrifying power that Yuan Xiu had displayed previously had already surpassed that of ordinary Reversion Void Stage cultivators.

A fully resurrected Yuan Xiu would probably be even more terrifying.

Dayue Mountain.

Qin Yu stood on the peak of the mountain, looking in the direction of the North Plain.

His expression was just as grave, but even in such a situation, there was still an inexplicable spirit in his body.

This unyielding spirit seemed to have been supporting him through one difficult situation after another.

“In fact, I don’t recommend you to participate in this matter.” Wen Wanchong suddenly appeared behind Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked at Wen Wanchong, waiting for him to continue.

Wen Wanchong continued, “This is a meaningless thing. No matter what, protecting one’s own life is always the first priority. Meaningless sacrifice has always been a stupid move.”

Qin Yu did not object to this. He had no obligation to serve Nanzhou, but there was always an inexplicable voice in his heart that drove him.

It was this voice that gave Qin Yu endless fighting spirit. If he gave up, he was afraid that she would break his own dao technique.

“I will never give up.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Wen Wanchong sighed and said nothing.

However, he silently made up his mind.

No matter what, he had to ensure Qin Yu’s safety tomorrow, even if it meant risking his life.

The North Plain glowed with a myriad of lights throughout the night.

Even in Nanzhou, one could see the speckles of light from afar.

These lights were like the stars in the sky, dazzling but not out of place.

It was the only light in the North Plain that could not be ignored.

At this moment, the sky of the North Plain was filled with a thousand rays of light. All the rays of light gathered into a single point and formed a connection with Yuan Xiu’s body.

It was like a ritual, a resurrection ritual, and it was extremely terrifying.

Yuan Xiu sitting at the foot of the snowy mountain was trembling non-stop. His aura was so concentrated and powerful that it seemed like a terrifying storm was about to set off in the entire North Plain!

Yuan Xiu’s two clones stood guard in front of his true body, in case anything happened.

Time passed by.

The sky gradually turned bright.

At this moment, all the light in the sky condensed into a beam of light that reached the sky. Then, it entered Yuan Xiu’s body!

“Boom!”

The entire North Plain began to shake!

Many people were jolted awake by this, and they all looked toward the center of the North Plain!

“Has the Lord resurrected?”

“Is the resurrection of the Lord about to be completed?”

Many people rushed in the direction of Yuan Xiu.

In a short while, countless people had gathered on the snowy mountain!

“The Lord really came back to life! He’s finally coming back to life!”

We can finally leave this damn place in the North Plain!

“That’s great, that’s great!”

Many people knelt on the ground and prostrated themselves in the direction of Yuan Xiu.

Yuan Xiu’s true body, which was sitting cross-legged on the ground finally stood up!

His aura was extremely terrifying, as if he was a Devil Lord that could make the nine Heavens and ten Hells submit to him!

A single gaze from him could sweep through everything. Just a wisp of his aura could cause the earth to collapse!

At this moment, Yuan Xiu opened his mouth and swallowed the two clones into his body!

A perfect body Yuan Xiu had been resurrected!

The true Lord of North Plain had returned to the human world!

“Welcome back to life, Lord!”

The entire North Plain let out deafening shouts in unison!

Their shouts melted the ice and caused the snow to collapse!

Yuan Xiu swept his cold gaze over the group of people without any change in his expression.

The next second, he suddenly stretched out a large hand!

This huge hand covered the sky and the earth, almost covering the entire sky of the North Plain!

Before the crowd could be shocked, the huge hand squeezed lightly, and all the cultivators in the North Plain were turned into bones in an instant. They didn’t even have the time to scream!

Their spiritual awareness and true energy turned into clouds of terrifying mist and entered Yuan Xiu’s body!

Yuan Xiu, who had been completely resurrected, had actually killed everyone in the North Plain!Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
