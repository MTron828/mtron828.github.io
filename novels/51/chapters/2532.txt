2533 Heaven-Defying Insight

The defensive techniques and healing techniques were not as complex as the offensive, especially healing techniques that provided one-on-one assistance on the battlefield, even when targeting an individual.

They could play a significant role on the battlefield if they could unleash the defensive techniques together, such as the Water Shadow Shield and Starry Sea Shield of the Gu family’s immortal scripture.

However, Qin Yu was unsure if it would work.

“You still need to work with the members of the Gu family to study this. We need to put it into practice to see if it’s feasible.”

Gu Wanqing’s eyes immediately lit up when she saw the exquisite cultivation method.

She was a member of the Gu family who was obsessed with cultivation. The deaths of the family head and the saintess had pushed her to the current position.

“If it works, the Gu family will definitely play a significant role in the future war. However, as you’ve said, there are still some issues that we need to test out together. I’m going back right now.”

Gu Wanqng’s voice was full of excitement that was hard to conceal. If this idea was feasible, the members of the Gu family could play a crucial role in the future war.

“Thank you for trusting our Gu family so much.”

Gu Wanqing disappeared from the spot after saying this.

This was indeed the trust that Saintess Gu and Senior Baiyi had exchanged with their lives.

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile. He would not pass on the complete version of the Brilliance of Stars and Moon to someone else. However, facing the newly appointed head of the Gu family, Qin Yu did not reserve anything at all.

After nearly a week, all the people of Human Race Watch were in closed-door cultivation outside Solitary Cloud City.

This time, many cultivators above the fifth-grade True Saint from the three peaks had witnessed the power of the Brilliance of Stars and Moon and began cultivating.

Qin Yu was immersed in the cultivation of this method for the past week. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

As he had taken the path of the Way of Anomaly, he did not need to leave his soul mark in the sea of the Path of Heaven, so this cultivation method did not affect him much.

The Five Emperor Coins combined with his soul, and he could clearly sense the changes when the cultivation method was activated.

At this moment, with the Unity of Will of the Meridian Circulation Technique of the Brilliance of Stars and Moon, he felt that his soul somehow seemed to be connected with countless forces.

Following that, an image that looked like the stars in the universe lit up in his sea of consciousness. Qin Yu was suddenly a little surprised.

He was keenly aware that these shadows lit up were the people cultivating the Brilliance of Stars and Moon from Human Race Watch.

To confirm his thought, he focused all his attention on a small cluster of stars.

As Qin Yu poured all of his soul power into that area, that constellation also magnified to the extreme.

In an instant, his soul seemed to have entered another space. Following that, he seemed able to “see” the people of Demon-slaying Peak that were cultivating!

“F*ck!”

It was way more awesome than surveillance, by ten thousand times.

Qin Yu could sense all of them if the scale of Human Race Watch continued expanding and the people cultivated this cultivation method.

Didn’t that mean he did not have to worry about spies entering and could expand the scale of Human Race Watch without fear?

If the number of people could grow bigger, he could borrow the power of this joint attack.

If he formed a legion similar to the monster race army, he would only need to guide it to launch a terrifying attack. It would be incomparably terrifying!

To reach the power of this level, he had to burn his soul power and use Evil Eye to release the God-slaying Dusk.

Or perhaps it could only be achieved by detonating the power of the six acupoints. If that was the case, this cultivation method was too heaven-defying.

Furthermore, Qin Yu discovered that these constellations were flickering and dimming differently. After he continued observing nearly a thousand people, he noticed a characteristic.

Their brightness did not seem to be determined by their strength. He could sense the incredibly radiant power of the constellation representing the peak master.

But he also noticed the radiant light from Xiaobai and the people from Demon-slaying Peak.

Other than Demon-slaying Peak, the other two peaks were slightly dimmer. There were also bright and murky constellations from the Jee family.

“That’s strange. Xie Yue, the disciple of Ethereal Peak, is already at the Peak of True Saint. Why is his light so dim?”

Qin Yu frowned. Xiaobai was only at the fourth-grade True Sain but was emitting such a bright stellar light. Xie Yue’s situation was a little weird.

He sent his soul power into Xie Yue’s body again.

As his soul power continuously infused Xie Yue’s body, Qin Yu felt his soul suddenly enter Xie Yue’s body after penetrating the nebula.

He could even feel the slight vibration of Xie Yue’s flow of spiritual power. Qin Yu seemed to be the master of this body.

Within a thought, he could penetrate Xie Yue’s muscles, blood vessels, meridians, and divine sense and enter his sea of consciousness, allowing him to see through the secrets of his body.

“What a mysterious cultivation method! I didn’t expect the Brilliance of Stars and Moon to have such a terrifying application!”

Qin Yu gasped. If that was the case, he could also observe the overall situation even if more people joined.

When he had time, he would sort out things his father left behind. He realized that many things his father left behind brought him the utmost surprises.

“Hmm? What is this?”

Just as Qin Yu was about to retreat, he suddenly saw a small cluster of pitch-black things.

Xie Yue cultivated the thunder technique but this power seemed very abrupt, so it should not be his cultivation power.

It was like a tiny jellyfish, grabbing in the middle of Xie Yue’s Sea of Soul.

If Qin Yu’s soul did not coincidentally pass through this place, he probably would not have noticed this strange scene from the layers of soul power.

“Desolate divine eye!

“Open!”

The power of the golden pupil technique split the pitch-black fog apart and shot directly at its core.

The demonic elemental energy!Heavenly monster!

This fellow had long been taken over by the heavenly monster!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically, and his soul suddenly returned to his true body.

After that, Qin Yu came to Xie Yue like a bolt of lightning. He stared at Xie Yue with a gaze as sharp as lightning.

“What’s the matter? Qin Yu.”

Xie Yue asked in a puzzle.

“Get out!”

Qin Yu grabbed Xie Yue’s neck with one hand. His soul power turned into five nails and nailed Xie Yue’s soul.

“Hahaha! How did you notice me?”

In an instant, Xie Yue’s body released an overwhelming demonic qi, and his face suddenly bulged like a balloon.
