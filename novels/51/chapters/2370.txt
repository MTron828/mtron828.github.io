2371 The Mixed Demonic Water

“Thank you for your help.”

However, with his escape technique just now, he should be able to escape even if Qin Yu did not make a move.

“My name is Qin Yu. May I know how to address you, master?”

Qin Yu stared at the little monk in front of him. Although he looked very young, he gave Qin Yu the feeling that he had experienced the vicissitudes of life.

“Just call me Chen Zhisha. My master and I were cultivating deep in the mountains. Having premonition of a great change in the Path of Heaven, my master let me come out to experience the mortal world.”

Chen Zhisha slightly bowed again.

“Master Chen, how did that monster race general use the power that surpassed the Path of Heaven without suffering a backlash?”

Qin Yu asked with doubts. He dared not underestimate this little monk at all. He had a similar feeling when facing the evil exterminator, Teng Zixu, and the others, which was unfathomable.

“The human world, the demon and the monster races, and the ghost race have their respective Path of Heaven. Just like the human race’s countries, they split and unite. Now, the Path of Heaven of the monster race has slowly suppressed those of the human race. Therefore, the monster race could release the power that surpassed the Path of Heaven for a brief moment after the ritual, but it would not last long.”

The little monk seemed to have a deep understanding of the power of the Path of Heaven. He answered Qin Yu’s question almost without hesitation.

“When will the Golden Path of Heaven of the human race descend?”

“Heaven’s secrets can’t be revealed. I’m not sure either.” The little monk shook his head.

“What are your plans in this chaotic world?”

He seemed unwilling to dwell on the question and turned his gaze to look elsewhere.

“I want to accomplish my things first. I might return or find a secret place to live in seclusion.”

Qin Yu said softly. Almost a hundred years had passed, and he had to fulfill his promise and bring back that silly girl.

“In chaotic times, no one can escape disasters. I see that you didn’t fuse your soul into the Path of Heaven, but you have the power of tribulation. Are you going to create your own path?”

The little monk did not look at Qin Yu and not even observe him with his divine sense, but he could tell Qin Yu’s cultivation path. This made Qin Yu feel tremendously shocked.

“To reach this point, you must have endured countless hardships, and this is the result today. The fusion of the Glazed Holy Body and the chaotic holy body should be the first in the past five years of Path of Heaven.”

The little monk exclaimed again.

As the two clashed, Qin Yu only felt like being sent flying by an unrivaled force. When he landed, he only felt the blood in his body churning.

The little monk said softly.

“Master Chen, how far will this world develop?” Qin Yu asked with a sigh. He had seen too many massacres when crossing many planes lately. Even if he thought his heart was as solid as a rock, he could not help but feel a little sad.

“The balance of the four races’ Path of Heaven has been disrupted. The human race is on the brink of extinction, and the souls have returned to the ghost realm. The demon race has obtained cosmic luck, and the chaotic killing intent of the war belongs to the monster race. Currently, it appears that the three races have joined forces.”

The little monk smiled bitterly.

“The human race has been at the top for too long and occupied most of the energy of the Path of Heaven. At its peak, ten Immortal Emperors emerged. Now that the cycle of cause and effect has started, and the human race’s cosmic luck has begun to weaken. The three races must seize this opportunity. Otherwise, they will be suppressed again when the human race recovers.”

The little monk shook his head and continued.

“Previously, the monster race couldn’t break through to the human plane due to the planar suppression. Now that the planar suppression has begun to ease, the monster race will only continue to attack and become increasingly stronger in the war.”

The little monk sighed.

“I hope I’m looking too far ahead. We’ll meet again if fate permits.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Buddha’s light enveloped him. He then disappeared from where he was.

Qin Yu only came back to his senses after a long time. His encounter with the little monk was like a dream.

What he had said was too shocking. However, to the current Qin Yu, they seemed to have nothing to do with him.

The most formidable force in the Holy Region was still plundering resources in purgatory. What could he do alone?

He recalled the physical clash with Chen Zhisha just now. Why could he fight against his holy body with his mere physical strength?

Qin Yu was somewhat confused. He felt Chen that Zhisha seemed to be reminding him, but he did not grasp that point.

After thinking for a long time, he still did not discover anything.

He put his thoughts on the general’s arm. This arm contained extremely surging magic power.

Qin Yu carefully examined the arm and discovered it to be tremendously strong. He did not know what kind of body-tempering technique it had used.

That strength should only be slightly weaker than Chang Mang’s holy body. The monster race’s cultivation path seemed to be the physical body. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Not using any techniques, the monster race general’s final attack was purely physical strength.

He grabbed the arm and circulated the Traceless Immortal Scripture again.

The arm turned into an overwhelming monster’s elemental energy surging in the air. The level of this demonic qi was many times purer than the previous monster race soldiers.

This caused Qin Yu to hesitate a little. He had lingering fear from the violent explosion when absorbing the demonic qi previously. However, with the strength of his body, even if the explosion were ten times stronger, it would only cause him severe injuries at most.

In an instant, the chaotic qi in his body surged violently.

All the veins on his head and body bulged, and the violent chaotic qi fiercely blasted toward the demonic qi.

The moment the demonic qi devoured him, an earth-shattering explosion erupted from Qin Yu’s body.

That terrifying power instantly transmitted to Qin Yu’s limbs and bones. Qin Yu stomped, and an enormous pit appeared on the ground instantly.

The terrifying explosive force surged into his arm, and Qin Yu slammed it fiercely into the sky.

In an instant, the wind and clouds changed, and the gate of the Path of Heaven slowly opened.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. This trace of power had actually surpassed the limit. He forcefully withdrew half of the strength.

Only then did the golden gate slowly disappear, and after a long time did the internal qi in his body calm down.

His ribs were covered in cracks, and the cells and blood vessels around the explosion were completely mangled.

Countless vital energy entered his body and quickly healed his injuries.

In his dantian, a drop of green and black water was floating.

It seemed to be a liquid produced by the mixture of demonic qi and chaotic vital energy. It contained a tremendously terrifying explosive power.

If this drop of mixed demonic water entered his dantian, it would definitely cause a massive explosion of power, just like previously.

However, his body might not be able to withstand that power.
