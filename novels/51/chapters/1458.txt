Chapter 1459: Chapter 1,459, Eternal Limit’s invitation 1

No one seemed to have expected that Qin Yu could actually withstand the eighteen godly men’s dragon drawing divine slash.

In the Heavenly Cloud Sect, the first Elder’s face was ashen.

“This Qin Yu is really not simple. No wonder you have suffered losses in his hands time and time again,”the deputy sect master said from the side.

The first elder, who was already furious, was even more furious when he heard this.

“Are you mocking me?”The Great Elder said with a gloomy face.

The deputy sect master laughed and said, “Of course I don’t have such intentions. If it really doesn’t work out, I’ll ask the sect master to help.”

“There’s no need!”The Great Elder rejected the deputy sect master’s suggestion without even thinking.

He said with a gloomy face, “The eighteen gods beheading him, Qin Yu, is like chopping melons and vegetables. Just wait and see.”

Outside.

The eyes of the eighteen gods became colder and colder.

They looked at Qin Yu, planning to attack again.

Facing these eighteen gods, Qin Yu couldn’t find any countermeasures at the moment.

“Matchless... Imperial Seal!”

At this moment, the eighteen gods shouted at the same time!

They attacked together, striking out an extremely powerful mark!

This mark swept across the void, as if it had crossed space and time!

The extremely powerful pressure made Qin Yu feel a little breathless.

Even if he had the limitless dharma idol, he was still unable to resist!

The eighteen gods were one of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s trump cards, so their strength naturally did not need much to be said.

As for Qin Yu, he was only a nascent soul realm cultivator. Facing the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s foundation, he quickly fell into a disadvantageous position.

Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily. His entire body glowed with golden light, attempting to resist this technique.

However, at this moment, a resplendent beam of light seemed to come from the sky and pierced straight towards the seal.

“Dang!”

A loud sound exploded beside Qin Yu’s ear! The unparalleled imperial seal was actually shattered!

“What’s Going On!”The surrounding people could not help but be greatly shocked.

With a closer look, they saw that the light was wrapped around a dagger.

This seemingly simple dagger had directly destroyed the unparalleled imperial seal!

“The Heavenly Cloud sect sent out eighteen gods to deal with a junior. Isn’t this a bit too much of a bully?”

A voice slowly came over.

Following that, several figures appeared in front of everyone.

The person in the lead was actually Mister Yongji!

Beside him were many of Yongji’s adopted sons!

“Mr. Yongji? Why is he here?”

“Could it be that Qin Yu is still in contact with Mr. Yongji?”

“D * mn, what kind of dog Sh * t luck is this kid? Other than the Heavenly Cloud sect, he knows all the big shots in the entire South Province!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Seeing Yongji suddenly arrive, Qin Yu was also somewhat surprised.

He put away his Infinity Dharma Idol and returned to normal. Then, he quickly walked toward Yongji.

“Mr. Yongji, you are...”Qin Yu looked at Yongji suspiciously.

There was not much history between the two of them. There was no reason for him to help him.

Yongji said with a faint smile, “I knew you would come to seek revenge from the Heavenly Cloud sect. But with your strength alone, how could you be a match for the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”

Qin Yu was silent. He had indeed underestimated the heavenly cloud sect.

A sect that could persevere for so many years in the South Province did indeed have some ability.

“Yong Ji! What do you mean? !”

At this moment, the shadow of the first elder suddenly appeared.

He glared angrily at Yong Ji and shouted, “Yong Ji, our Heavenly Cloud Sect and your eternal pole city have always stayed out of each other’s way. Do you want to start a war with our heavenly cloud sect? !”

Yongji smiled and said, “I don’t dare to start a war. It’s just that I like Qin Yu very much, so I stepped in to save her.”

“Nonsense!”The first elder said angrily.

“Yongji, I advise you not to meddle in this matter. Qin Yu Must Die!”

Yongji put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I will definitely meddle in today’s matter.”

The first elder and Yongji looked at each other, and the atmosphere became a bit strange.

“Yong Ji, you’d better not provoke my heavenly cloud sect,”the great elder said coldly.

Yong Ji cupped his hands and said, “Of course I won’t provoke the Heavenly Cloud sect, but I won’t stop today.”

Then, Yong Ji looked at his adopted son and said with a smile, “I have eighteen people with me. Maybe I can fight with the eighteen gods of Your Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

The great elder gritted his teeth. He didn’t expect that Yong Ji would be involved.

However, Yong Ji was powerful and had an extraordinary foundation. If the sect master didn’t come out, no one would be able to deal with him.

“Qin Yu, consider yourself lucky.”The Great Elder looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Qin Yu also sneered, “I’ll leave your dog head for you. Sooner or later, I’ll cut it off myself!”

The first elder didn’t say anything else. His figure slowly disappeared.

And the eighteen gods didn’t say any nonsense. They turned around and returned to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Yong Ji looked at Qin Yu and said, “How is it? Are You Hurt?”

Qin Yu touched the huge bloody hole in her chest and shook her head. “I’m fine. It’s just a superficial wound.”

Yong Ji grunted in gratitude and then said, “Do you want to go to the Eternal Limit City with me?”

“Forget it. I still have some matters to deal with,”Qin Yu said perfunctorily.

Although Yong Ji had saved her, for some reason, Qin Yu felt that Yong Ji was not a good person.

Yong Ji smiled and did not force her.

“I’ve invited many of the top people from the South Province to meet in eternal fortress city for half a month. You should come along,”Yong Ji suddenly said.

Before Qin Yu could reply, Yongji continued, “The unique dance that you are familiar with will also be there. Of course, Xiao Hai and the others will also be there.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu said awkwardly, “How can I be qualified to participate in such a grand event?”

Yongji laughed loudly and said, “You are one of the best in your generation. Naturally, you have the qualifications to participate. Don’t try to avoid it anymore.”

Yong Ji had just saved him, so he couldn’t avoid it too much.

Thus, Qin Yu could only nod and agree.

Yong Ji didn’t stay any longer. He turned around and left with his disciple.

After he left, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave either.

The last time he came to this city, he didn’t have the time to observe properly. This was an opportunity.

Thus, Qin Yu directly walked towards an Fenglou.

The main door of an Fenglou was tightly shut. No one dared to open the door when they heard the knocking.

“Boss Zheng, open the door,”Qin Yu shouted.

When boss Zheng in an Fenglou heard this, his body immediately trembled.

“Everyone, don’t speak...”boss Zheng said in a low voice.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s shout came from outside the door, “Open the door. Don’t worry, I Won’t do anything to you. I just want to stay here for a few days.”
