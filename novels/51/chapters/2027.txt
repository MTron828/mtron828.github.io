“You’re a direct descendant of the Si family. You were born with countless resources and advantages,” Si Liuhe said slowly.

“Your strength, wisdom, and cultivation speed are all things the Si family is most proud of. Don’t let a rogue cultivator destroy your confidence. You should know that the foundation and background of the Si family are unshakable.”

Si Shiyue seemed to have been comforted by his master’s words, but the uneasiness in his heart still did not disappear.

The renowned Holy Son of the Holy Region was like a helpless child in front of Si Liuhe.

!!

Si Liuhe put his hands behind his back and said lightly, “I will give you two choices. First, I will kill Qin Yu. This way, no one will compare you to Qin Yu.”

“Second, conquer the fear in your heart and let the world know who the number one in the Holy Region is.”

Si Shiyue did not say a thing. Numerous expressions flashed across his face.

After a while, Si Shiyue gritted his teeth and said, “Master, you don’t have to do anything. If he can defeat the Third Elder, then I’ll do something even more brilliant than him.”

Hearing Si Shiyue’s words, Si Liuhe smiled in relief.

He patted Si Shiyue’s shoulder and said, “Your cultivation has reached a bottleneck. Perhaps it’s time for you to compete with your peers.”

There were so many Holy Sons in the world. No one knew who was stronger or weaker because there rarely had opportunities to fight.

After hearing what Si Liuhe had said, Si Shiyue understood now.

“I’ll make a move now!” Si Shiyue stood up and said.

However, Si Liuhe raised his palm and pressed it on Si Si Shiyue’s shoulder.

“It’s not the time now,” Si Liuhe shook his head and said.

“The opening of the Chaos Grave is a great opportunity for you to prove yourself. You have to seize the opportunity to obtain a higher cultivation level and prove that you are the most brilliant existence of this era with unparalleled strength.”

“Yes, Master!” Si Shiyue nodded respectfully, his eyes shining with determination.

After saying that, Si Shiyue bowed to Si Liuhe and left.

Looking at Si Shiyue’s back, Si Liuhe put his hands behind his back, sighed, and said, “No matter which choice you make, Qin Yu must die. This is the family head’s order. So… fortunately, you made the right choice…”

The news from the outside world continued to ferment, and Qin Yu was pushed to the forefront.

It was no exaggeration to say that the most famous people in the entire Holy Region now were Qin Yu and that mysterious person of the demon race.

They were the only ones who dared to attack the nine great aristocratic families and defeat them.

It also made the various aristocratic families even more determined to get rid of Qin Yu and that mysterious person of the demon race. They also held a secret meeting.

…

Heavenly Heart Lake was once said to be the closest to dao techniques.

However, for some reason, Heavenly Heart Lake declined and even became a deserted place.

This place used to be a dazzling paradise, but now it had become a quiet wasteland. The lake water was as calm as a mirror and crystal clear as if it was telling the glory of the past.

However, the grass and trees by the lake had withered. The prosperity of the past no longer existed. The bustling cultivators had gradually left this place, leaving only loneliness and silence.

Once a holy land that cultivators dreamed of had now become a lonely place forgotten by the world.

However, a young man was sitting by the lake in such a place.

He held a snow-white fishing rod in his hand. The clear water rippled, giving people a sense of coolness.

The young man had a slender figure and handsome facial features. His long black hair was casually draped over his shoulders. Although the internal qi on his body seemed calm, one could see dao techniques circulating his body if one looked carefully

“Your old friend is indeed quite capable.”

At this moment, a woman’s voice sounded behind him.

The young man didn’t move and was focused on fishing.

A few minutes later, a small silver-white fish took the bait.

Holding the small fish in his hand, the young man’s eyes revealed deep affection.

However, he suddenly exerted force and crushed the fish into meat paste in the next second.

The woman behind him did not react as if she was used to it.

At this moment, the young man slowly stood up and said with a smile, “Old friend? Which old friend?”

“Qin Yu, the person you miss the most,” the woman said.

“Qin Yu?” After hearing this, a trace of surprise flashed across the young man’s face.

Then he looked into the distance as if recalling something.

“Xiao Yuan, don’t you want to see your old friend after hearing the news?” the woman continued to ask.

Xiao Yuan shook his head and said smiling. “There’s no rush. It’s not time yet. My cultivation technique has not reached great success yet.”

“It’s been three whole years. You’ve been hiding on Heavenly Heart Island. With your talent, numerous families will go after you once you enter the world. Why did you…” The woman opened her mouth, feeling puzzled.

However, Xiao Yuan interrupted her. “I don’t give a d*mn to those aristocratic families.”

“You don’t give a d*mn? You don’t give a d*mn to the nine great aristocratic families, too?” the woman snorted and said.

Xiao Yuan didn’t dwell on the topic. He looked at the woman and said, “You’re considered a favored daughter of the Yao family and have received much attention. Why do you want to follow me?”

The woman rolled her eyes at Xiao Yuan and said, “You know it yourself. Why are you still asking me?”

Xiao Yuan sighed and continued, “How long have you been following me?”

“Two and a half years,” the woman said without hesitation.

Xiao Yuan stood up and reached out to hold the woman’s face. He said in a tremendously gentle tone, “Xiaowei, you know I love you very much.”

Hearing what he said, Xiaowei’s eyes flashed with tenderness, and her face was full of shyness.

...

“I love you very much too…” Xiaoweii said softly.

Xiao Yuan sighed and continued, “But it’s still not deep enough. Xiaowei, I really need you. I really need you.”

Xiaowei seemed to have been reminded and quickly said, “I’ve been working hard. I’ll definitely make you love me from the bottom of your heart and love me forever!”

“Let’s hope that day will come sooner,” Xiao Yuan smiled and said.

As someone who came to the Holy Region from Earth, Xiao Yuan was naturally very familiar with Qin Yu. He had even fought with Qin Yu before.

As heaven’s favorites, they would meet sooner or later.

…

During this time, Qin Yu hid in this Mystic Realm to recuperate. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Xiao Hai’s Mystic Realm was incredibly beautiful. Anyone who sat here would feel relaxed and happy.

“What a wonderful Mystic Realm!” Qin Yu sighed with emotion. This Mystic Realm seemed to have some dao technique that could cleanse people’s evil thoughts. It was incomparably comfortable.

In the blink of an eye, three days went by.

...

On this day, the void in front of him trembled. After that, Xiao Hai brought Jue Wu and stepped into the Mystic Realm.
