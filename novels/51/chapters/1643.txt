Chapter 1644: Chapter 1,644, discussing Dao 1 with Xiao Sheng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Everyone was stunned when they heard Xiao Sheng’s words.

This was the first time a voice came from the cultivation mountain after a long time.

Before Qin Yu could react, the deputy sect leader had already rushed up the mountain impatiently.

However, just as his foot touched the mountain gate, he was pushed down by a gentle force.

The deputy sect master was dumbfounded. He looked at Qin Yu and then looked at the Cultivation Mountain. For a moment, he was extremely confused.

The sect master came back and did not summon the people from the sect, but he wanted to see Qin Yu? What the hell was this logic?

Qin Yu could not figure it out either. He took a deep breath and walked up the mountain with Big Steps.

“Qin Yu!”

At this moment, the deputy sect master suddenly shouted.

Qin Yu stopped and turned around to look at the deputy sect master.

The deputy sect master held it in for a long time before finally saying, “You must persuade the sect master.”

Qin Yu revealed a brilliant smile and said, “Don’t worry.”

Then, he strode up the Cultivation Mountain.

The moment he stepped into the Cultivation Mountain, the light once again enveloped the entire cultivation mountain.

Qin Yu passed through the small path on the mountain and arrived at the peak.

He saw Xiao Sheng sitting on the peak with his back facing Qin Yu. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He pressed his palms together and slowly adjusted his breathing as if he was cultivating.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Xiao Sheng, I’m here.”

Xiao Sheng gently extended his palm and a table and chair fell in front of the two of them.

Immediately after, Xiao Sheng used the blink of an eye to arrive in front of the table and chair and sit down.

“Sit down,”Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu did not stand on ceremony. He sat opposite Xiao Sheng and immediately asked impatiently, “I know that you have the ability to fight against the northern lands, but why have you been unwilling to make a move?”

Xiao Sheng seemed to have long expected this. He did not have any fluctuations in his expression. He only said indifferently, “Why do I have to make a move?”

Qin Yu said with some anger, “Xiao Hai died for the South Province! He forcefully crossed the river of death and died on the other side of the river of Death!”

“He is your blood brother. Shouldn’t you take revenge for him? !”

As soon as he said this, an extremely strange smile appeared on Xiao Sheng’s face.

Then, he looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “If that’s the case, the person I should kill first is you.”

Qin Yu was stunned and was immediately speechless.

That’s right, Qin Yu killed Xiao Sheng’s son. He should have killed him long ago.

“I will naturally take revenge for Xiao Hai, but not now,”Xiao Sheng said indifferently.

His large sleeves shone, and a cup of tea fell in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu did not have the mood to drink tea. He looked at Xiao Sheng coldly and said, “You are waiting for the Northern Land’s master to fully recover, right?”

Xiao Sheng raised his eyebrows and nodded. “Since you know, why do you ask?”

“Do you really want to wait for him to fully recover? !”Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted.

“You might as well think about it. Why would Xiao Hai forcefully cross the Death River and risk his life to stop the Northern Land Lord? It’s because he doesn’t have the confidence to defeat the fully recovered Northern Land Lord!”Qin Yu coldly berated.

“I know you’re very strong, but Xiao Hai isn’t weaker than you. You should know this clearly in your heart.”

Qin Yu’s words were indeed reasonable.

Xiao Sheng also nodded slightly and said, “You’re right.”

“It’s because Xiao Hai already realized that once the northern lord fully resurrects, no one can stop him! That’s why he sacrificed his life to buy time,”Qin Yu coldly said.

Xiao Sheng looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Then let me ask you, what should I do? Follow Xiao Hai’s example and forcefully cross the river of death and die on the other side?”

Qin Yu was stunned and was momentarily speechless.

With the attitude of an elementalist, even if he really died, it would not affect his complete resurrection.

Thinking about it this way, it seemed that there was really no other way except to forcefully cross the river of death.

Qin Yu fell silent. He could not find an answer.

“Moreover, if Xiao Hai is alive, it is not necessarily impossible for him to defeat the northern Lord,”Xiao Sheng said faintly.

Qin Yu remained silent. However, he had a feeling that Xiao Sheng had underestimated the northern lord.

“Many of the northern cultivators have already entered the southern region under the leadership of the elementalists. Who knows how many people have died at their hands.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Are you unmoved? Even the nine caves that disappeared for so many years paid the price with their lives. Your brothers are the same. What about you? Why did you do nothing? Why did you even hide?”

Xiao Sheng did not care about this question.

He asked, “Qin Yu, let me ask you, what is the most important task of a sect?”

Qin Yu was stunned and shook his head. Of course, he did not know.

The sect master continued, “Let me ask you again. As the sect master of a sect, what is the number one priority?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and immediately replied, “Is it... to protect the sect?”

“That’s right. My greatest responsibility is only to protect the heavenly cloud sect. As for the lives of others, what does it have to do with me?”Xiao Sheng asked.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was immediately speechless.

In this way, it seemed that he indeed didn’t have any responsibility, nor did he have the obligation to protect everyone.

“Qin Yu, don’t force your thoughts on others,”Xiao Sheng said slowly.

“Everyone has the right to make their own choices. Xiao Hai chose to fight for the South Province. He is a hero, and he should be admired.”

“I don’t fight for anyone, and it is also my choice. This is also my right.”

“Do you think that all the cultivators in the world should be the same in your eyes? Should they care about the world as much as you do? If all the people in the world are the same, is there still a need for this world to exist?”

Qin Yu was stumped by the question and was even persuaded.

For the first time, he felt that there was nothing wrong with Xiao Sheng’s actions.

Seeing Qin Yu’s silence, Xiao Sheng placed his palm on Qin Yu’s shoulder and said indifferently, “If you want to understand a world, you have to at least let go of your subjective thoughts. What do you think?”

Qin Yu sighed slightly.

He looked at Xiao Sheng and said with a sigh, “You’re right. I really shouldn’t force you to do anything. No one is born with the obligation to fight for others...”

“It’s the same with cultivation. Everyone has their own dao technique.”Xiao Sheng slowly paced back and forth and returned to the tree.

He slowly sat down and said, “What other doubts do you have?”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “In that case, no one can resurrect the entire northern lands on their own.”

“I think so.”Xiao Sheng nodded.

“Will you fight with him?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

“I think so.”Xiao Sheng continued to answer.

Qin Yu nodded, then cupped his hands and said, “Thank you.”

“Then what’s Your Choice?”Xiao Sheng suddenly asked.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and smiled. “As you said, everyone has their own choice. My choice is completely different from yours.”

“Okay.”Xiao Sheng did not say much. “You are a promising talent. I believe that you can defeat an elementalist when you were young.”
