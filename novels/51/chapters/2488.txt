2489 Suffering Another Severe Injury

It swept toward Gu Baiyi like a shockwave and directly smashed all the nearby living beings into fragments.

He suddenly descended, and a blade light pierced through the sky and almost descended simultaneously.

It clashed with the Immortal Crane’s casual attack, and in an instant, his saber aura shattered.

However, it also made him change his angle, and the shockwave flew upward diagonally. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Teng Zixu stared at Immortal Crane with a grave expression. He did not expect this casual attack to be even stronger than his attack with full strength.

Just what level had this demon race living being reached?

During this exchange of blows, Immortal Crane kept everyone in the Ni Temple of Heaven before he crossed over the void and left.

At this moment, Ji Yue, who was in the Sumeru ring, received the news.

“Yan Tianfeng was ambushed by 5,000 of the eight-winged monster race and died.”

When Yan Ruoxue, Lei Xin, and Flower Granny heard this news, their faces turned ashen.

Seeing that Qin Yu was somewhat at a loss, Ji Yue sighed and explained to Qin Yu.

“This person should have a combat strength comparable to Revered Qi, perhaps slightly weaker, but undoubtedly the strongest among the human race. During the previous invasion by the demon race, the demon race also had significant power to counter Yan Tianfeng.

“He’s an old ancestor cultivating in seclusion. He is also Yan Tianshi’s grandfather. His strength has already reached the peak of the fifth level in the previous Path of Heaven year and has been trying to break through to the sixth level. He did not expect the demon and the monster race to join forces this time.”

Yan Ruoxue’s face revealed a sorrowful expression. She had received guidance from this Grandmaster before.

However, little did anyone expect that today, he would become the most formidable figure in the downfall of the human race.

This time, the Gu family suffered heavy losses in the first joint attack of the demon and the monster race. The War God, Gu Baiyi, was severely injured and dropped in her cultivation realm.

Yan Tianfeng, the most formidable human race cultivator, was ambushed by the joint attack of the eight-winged monster race. Five thousand monster race warriors had joined forces for the attack.

He was in retreat and was heavily injured before they killed him.

This time, the joint attack of the monster race and the demon race was too sudden. The human race did not even have time to react.

“Perhaps there are traitors among the human race. Only the higher-ups would know where Grandmaster was cultivating. The fact that the eight-winged monster race could precisely cross the spatial coordinates to the secluded meditation place indicated they must have obtained accurate information.”

It was dead silent in the Gu family at this moment.

“Saintess Gu, my condolences.”

Qin Yu and the others walked over and said softly to Saintess Gu.

“Don’t worry, the Gu family won’t give up just like this. I didn’t expect Human Race Watch to come and help, risking their lives. It’s ridiculous that the chosen one from the human race had been watching from the beginning to the end.”

Saintess Gu burst into laughter, and tears unknowingly flowed over her face.

The people lying here were probably friends and relatives playing and laughing yesterday.

The battle today led to an eternal separation between life and death.

Qin Yu and the others helped the Gu family clean up the mess in the subsequent few days.

“Qin Yu, Holy Lord Gu hasn’t returned yet. When the Holy Lord returns, we might all head to the Human Race Watch. I hope you can accept us when the time comes.”

The Gu family’s land had almost been destroyed and was no longer suitable for living.

Flower Granny spoke up on the way back.

“Based on distance, Thunder Courtyard and the Yun family are not far away from us. They should have provided support from the beginning. No wonder Saintestt Gu felt so disappointed.”

If they could send out more top-notch martial artists, they could do their best to cause heavy losses to the demon race even if they were lured away.

“This is what the human race is like. Even at this stage, they’re still calculative of various benefits. It’s something that the human race has accumulated over the years. In fact, many people are still scheming, thinking about how to eliminate dissidents through this war and increase the strength of their families.”

Ji Yue had the clearest perspective on the conflicts among the aristocratic families.

“Furthermore, Ten Thousand Budhha Sect and Heavenly Divination Sect have emerged among the four sects and four schools. There are many experts in their sects, but they have only gathered in Solitary Cloud City and various places in purgatory. They should have their own plans. Overall, it’s disunited. In addition, the Immortal Crane of the demon race seems to be a living being born from the cosmic luck of the demon race. Its strategic plans and arrangements behind the scenes have brought huge losses to the human race.”

Lei Xin nodded.

In the overall situation, even the power of Human Race Watch was merely one of the pawns, utterly incapable of reversing the game.

This time, even though they went all out, they could only slightly reduce the Gu family’s losses.

Gu Baiyi was still heavily injured, and they could not stop it at all.

What made Qin Yu even more dissatisfied was even more higher-ups from the alliance appeared when they returned to Human Race Watch.

They seemed to have wanted to monitor the alliance more closely.

Among them were Ni Qian, Lei Huan, and others.

Without Jiang Qingyuan, Yan Minglong, and several others who were more impartial, Qin Yu and the other higher-ups would probably have turned confrontational directly.

Jiang Qingyuan secretly transmitted his voice.

A single Revered Qi was enough to level this place.

Not to mention the combat strength of the higher-ups, the alliance was enough to crush Human Race Watch.

“This time, someone recorded the words of Immortal Crane from the demon race inviting you before he left, and it was widely spread in the alliance. Also, during your battle, Evil Eye had absorbed the soul of the human race. These were all spied on by some cultivators…”

Jiang Qingyuan shook his head with a bitter smile.

“These people didn’t come to help during the battle, causing Baiyi of the Gu family to be heavily injured and drop in her cultivation realm. They were observing the situation from the side so carefully!”

Chang Mang mocked.

“If we’re not careful with someone who might betray the human race, are we going to wait for him to betray and put the human race in danger? Didn’t you see Immortal Crane had personally invited him for a drink? It seems that their relationship is not shallow.”

Hua Zhikong immediately retorted.

Many people who did not understand Qin Yu’s relationship indeed agreed with this attitude.

However, this time, Human Race Watch went all out to save the Gu family indeed opened many people’s eyes.

Nearly a month had passed.

Apart from the minor conflicts in purgatory, the Holy Region was in a dead silence. After the demon race entered the Azure Rock Forest, they strictly guarded it and did not launch any new attacks. They seemed to be afraid of the revenge of the human race.

Whenever the demon race invaded, the human race would counterattack.

However, although the human race had some gains in the Azure Rock Forest, they did not achieve great results.

Three thousand white-robed members of the Gu family suddenly appeared in front of Huaning Mountain.

“Gu Ning, the head of the Gu family, has brought her disciples to visit Human Race Watch.”
