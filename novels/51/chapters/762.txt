Chapter 763: One Punch! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A powerful force, accompanied by gusts of wind, smashed towards Qin Yu!

Wherever it passed, trees were broken, and mountain rocks were destroyed!

Even from a great distance, one could still feel that terrifying internal qi!

“What... What a powerful force...” someone exclaimed in shock.

Han Wei’s face instantly turned pale!

This force was too powerful!

“Just a raise of his hand is already so powerful...” Han Wei muttered in a low voice.

“Boom!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed Blackie’s fist!

The terrifying qi flame that erupted from Blackie’s body suddenly disappeared at this moment!

The surroundings also instantly became calm.

The Qi force on his fist seemed to have been suppressed by Qin Yu.

“How... how is this possible?” Han Wei’s eyes widened when he saw this!

Blackie’s terrifying punch was actually easily neutralized?

Was the current Qin Yu already at such a level?

“How could this be...” Han Wei wanted to die.

He knew that there was a gap between him and Qin Yu, but he didn’t expect the gap to be this big!

“Just this little bit of strength?” Qin Yu looked coldly at Blackie, who was in front of him. The golden light on his body was appearing bit by bit!

Blackie knew that things weren’t good. He quickly broke free from Qin Yu’s palm and immediately shot backward!

In just one move, both sides seemed to have tested out each other.

Blackie looked coldly in Qin Yu’s direction, and his eyes narrowed slightly. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The atmosphere instantly froze.

Everyone held their breaths.

“Qin Yu, you have indeed surprised me,” Blackie said coldly.

“Is that so? You have disappointed me,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

A dark look flashed in Blackie’s eyes. Then, the black energy on his body began to erupt bit by bit.

“Qin Yu, today is the day you die!”

With Blackie’s furious roar, his body turned into a ray of black light and rushed toward Qin Yu!

His fist carried waves of sharp energy and rushed toward Qin Yu ferociously!

Qin Yu’s body was as light as a swallow. With his hands behind his back, he relied on his extreme speed to dodge every punch.

“Swish!”

In the blink of an eye, Blackie had already thrown out hundreds of punches!

Just the residual power alone had already smashed the ground into thousands of holes. It was enough to show his strength!

However, no matter how strong his fist was, he couldn’t even touch a single corner of Qin Yu’s clothes!

After thousands of punches, Blackie couldn’t help but gasp for breath.

“What, you only know how to dodge?” Blackie said coldly.

Qin Yu mocked, “Who but you yourself can be blamed for your slow speed?”

Blackie shouted angrily, “If you are a man, then fight openly!”

After saying that, Blackie once again shot towards Qin Yu!

His body emitted rays of black light. This light blotted out the sky and the sun, as if it contained a mysterious and unfathomable power!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Fine, then I will satisfy you!”

Qin Yu clenched his fist and leaned back slightly.

In the next second, Qin Yu suddenly threw a punch!

“Clang!”

A crisp sound entered everyone’s ears!

Qin Yu’s seemingly plain and unadorned punch smashed the speeding Blackie away!

Everyone only saw a black figure shooting toward Qin Yu and flying back in the next second!

Blackie’s body was like a cannonball, shooting backwards and smashing countless mountains!

“Boom!” The sound of countless rocks rolling down from the top of the mountain could be heard!

After smashing countless rocks, Blackie barely managed to stabilize his body.

For a moment, the scene was extremely quiet, and one could even hear the sound of breathing.

“One... One punch?”

“With just one punch, he sent Blackie flying...”

“As expected of Qin Yu. He always surprises people...”

Granny Qin’s expression was also ugly.

Her wrinkled face kept shaking, and an eerie internal qi filled her body.

“Ah...”

At this moment, Blackie pushed aside the ruins and crawled out.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly, and a serious expression flashed across his face.

This punch seemed to have shattered his bones.

“What a terrifying power.” Blackie frowned slightly.

“If I didn’t have the body of the Heaven Swallowing Python, this punch would have smashed me into meat paste.”

Blackie took a deep breath. He shattered the mountain rocks and looked at Qin Yu again.

“Qin Yu, you’re really a surprising guy.” Blackie opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue.

“But unfortunately, no matter how strong you are, you are only a mortal!”

As he spoke, Blackie clenched his fists and his back was slightly hunched, as if he was erupting with some kind of powerful force!

Internal qi surged out with Blackie as the center!

Blackie’s body formed a black arc that shook slightly. After a while, it spread out in all directions with a very fast speed!

“Ah!!!”

He clenched his fists and raised his head to roar!

A terrifying internal qi gushed out and swept through the entire Qinggang Mountain!

Some people even spat out blood!

“What a terrifying power!”

“Is this Blackie’s full strength?”

“As expected of the person who fought with Jiang He!”

Even Yan Jinyao frowned slightly, as if he was shocked by Blackie’s power.

That power erupted for a long time and reverberated throughout the entire mountain.

“Qin Yu, are you afraid?” Blackie stretched out his finger and pointed at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu squinted his eyes and said, “Not bad, but in my opinion, it’s just so-so.”

Blackie sneered and said, “You’re talking nonsense! I’m afraid you haven’t seen the power of a Martial Marquis at his peak.”

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “So this is your peak. I thought you were hiding your strength.”

A hint of displeasure flashed across Blackie’s face.

He snorted. “You’re really boastful. I hope you can still be so arrogant later!”

Qin Yu sneered. “If you have any moves, just use them. Stop talking nonsense.”

Blackie didn’t say anything more. He raised his palm, and streams of internal qi flowed along his arm and gathered on his palm.

“Boom!”

After a loud sound, Blackie’s clothes were instantly shattered, revealing his dark and somewhat slippery skin!

This slightly strange skin was shining with a dazzling light under the sunlight!

And that power was still gathering towards his palm.

They saw that his palm was wrapped by a black energy.

Blackie glanced at Qin Yu, then suddenly clenched his fist!

In an instant, the wind and clouds surged, and the sky changed color!

Gusts of violent winds exploded, and a terrifying aura came from all directions!

“Pu!”

Some people couldn’t withstand this power and knelt on the ground on the spot!

Some people were even directly crushed into meat paste!

“What... What a terrifying power...”

“What kind of move is this... just the internal qi alone is enough to make our bodies tremble...”

Even Yan Jinyao and the others seemed to feel a little uncomfortable.

“Good, that’s it. Kill him!” Granny Qin shouted excitedly. She seemed to be very confident in this move!

Blackie looked down from above.

His black pupils emitted waves of strange internal qi.

“Qin Yu, it’s time to end this,” Blackie said coldly.

Before he finished speaking, he shot towards Qin Yu again!

The crackling sound was incessant, and that terrifying power was about to tear apart the void!

“Go to hell!” Blackie roared again and again!

That black and resplendent power was about to explode in front of Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

Right at this moment, Qin Yu made his move.

He used the same trick again. He clenched his fist and a golden light appeared, heading towards Blackie.

In the next second, Blackie and the black energy on his body were sent flying once again.
