Chapter 1356: Chapter 1,356, the favor of all parties 

With the strength and status of the Heavenly Cloud sect, he was naturally not afraid of Wen Wanji.

Although Wen Wanji was not someone to be trifled with, the heavenly cloud sect could still eliminate him at a certain price.

The most important reason for the sect master to give in was that he had taken a liking to Qin Yu’s potential.

Just as elder Bai had predicted, he had to not push this matter out in the end.

Everyone was discussing and commenting on this matter.

“Sigh, the Heavenly Cloud sect has also seen Qin Yu’s potential.”Zhuo Jing sighed.

“Brother Zhuo is right. However, this Qin Yu is indeed worth nurturing and worth compromising.”Li Yingying said with a smile.

As she spoke, her eyes occasionally looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

“Yingying, you seem to be interested in this Qin Yu.”Zhuo Jing said jokingly.

Li Yingying didn’t avoid him. She said with a faint smile, “Who wouldn’t like a prodigy like him?”

“Hahaha!”Zhuo Jing couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “Qin Yu and Wen Da Wen Er are friends. Do you think you have a chance?”

“So what if they are friends? I don’t like Wen Da,”Li Yingying said disapprovingly.

“Just because you think so doesn’t mean Qin Yu will think so,”Zhuo Jing shook his head and said.

Li Yingying didn’t say anything. She looked in Qin Yu’s direction and hesitated for a moment. Then, she suddenly stood up and walked toward Qin Yu.

However, Li Yingying was very smart. She came all the way to the table, but she didn’t Greet Qin Yu. Instead, she looked at Wen Da.

“Greetings, Senior Wen.”Li Yingying took the lead to bow to Wen Wanli.

Wen Wanli said with a smile, “Yingying, come, quickly sit down.”

Without saying anything, Li Yingying chose to sit between Qin Yu and Wen Da.

“Wen Da, are you busy tomorrow? I want to ask you to go shopping with me.”Li Yingying said with a smile.

Wen Da was stunned, and then he said in ecstasy, “Of course I’m fine. No problem, no problem!”

“Well, tomorrow morning, I’ll go to your house to look for you.”Li Yingying said with a smile.

“Alright, Alright!”Wen Da said hurriedly.

Li Yingying nodded with a smile and then planned to leave.

Her eyes, intentionally or unintentionally, looked at Qin Yu. Her gaze was even more seductive.

This made Qin Yu extremely uncomfortable. He really didn’t like to get involved in such matters.

“This Li Yingying is definitely not a simple woman,”Qin Yu thought in his heart.

Then, Qin Yu asked Wen da, “Wen Da, you are such a playboy. Don’t tell me you really like Li Yingying?”

Wen Da glared at Qin Yu and said, “You are wrong. I’m a playboy to others, but I’m sincere to Yingying!”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say for a moment. He could only laugh bitterly.

Li Yingying turned around and sat down in front of Zhuo Jing’s table. Someone at the side joked, “How was it? Did you succeed?”

“Success my ass. I don’t think she even talked to Qin Yu,”Zhuo Jing joked.

Li Yingying flipped her hair and said indifferently, “To deal with people like him, you need to attack from the side. Too much enthusiasm will backfire.”

“TSK TSK, Yingying, you really put in a lot of effort,”someone at the side joked.

Li Yingying said indifferently, “Let me tell you, Qin Yu, I’m determined to get it!”

...

“How long will this meeting last?”Qin Yu sat there and said somewhat bored.

Wen Da ignored Qin Yu. He was immersed in joy.

Wen er said, “It’s going to be open for three days.”

“Three days?”Qin Yu was stunned. “Why is it taking so long?”

Wen er said mysteriously, “It’s said that they want to discuss the future development of the South Province, so it will take a long time.”

Wen er smiled and said, “But we don’t have to stay for that long. We can just leave if there’s nothing else.”

Qin Yu nodded. He couldn’t stay for three days at such an occasion.

“Qin Yu, Young Master Wen.”

At this moment, the city lord of Gu City suddenly walked over from not far away.

He cupped his hands and had a warm smile on his face. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wen Er rolled his eyes at him and said, “What are you doing here?”

The city Lord found a seat and sat down. Then, he smiled and said, “What happened before was all a misunderstanding. I specially came over to apologize to the few of you, especially Qin Yu. I hope you don’t mind.”

Wen er sneered and said, “You’re really a F * cking snob. What? Seeing that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect didn’t make things difficult for Qin Yu, you immediately came over to kneel down?”

The city Lord was a little embarrassed. He coughed dryly and said, “You should also know that I’m only a part-time worker. To put it bluntly, I also have to look at the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s face, so...”

“Alright, I won’t hold a grudge against you. But we are also destined not to be friends.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

The city lord quickly smiled and said, “How would I dare to dream of becoming friends with you? I...”

“Aiya, hurry up and leave. Don’t bother us anymore, okay?”Wen Er said impatiently.

Although the city Lord was a little embarrassed, he didn’t dare to flare up.

Now that Wen Wanye and the Heavenly Cloud sect were protecting him, no one in the entire South Province dared to provoke Qin Yu.

Other than the city lord, the other sects also came to greet and Toast Qin Yu. For a time, it was extremely lively.

But Qin Yu knew in his heart that this kind of prosperity was fake. It was like a bubble that could burst at any time. Therefore, he would not lose himself because of it.
