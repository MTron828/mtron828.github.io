Chapter 1241: Chapter 1,241. He would not stop until he achieved his goal 

Qin Yu continued forward without turning back.

What he wanted to do was to climb to the highest peak.

Just like what his father said, just like what he thought in his heart.

Everything calmed down.

Yan Ruoxue also followed the two black-clothed men and left this place.

Qin Yu returned to the Heaven Gate all the way.

He sat in front of the window in his room, his eyes flickering.

This time, Qin Yu did not ask about anything related to cultivation during his meeting with the Guardian. He had to rely on himself and explore step by step.

“The Holy Region... I don’t know when it will open,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

This was not something Qin Yu could be sure of. Therefore, in addition to improving his physical body, Qin Yu also had to collect array flags as soon as possible.

The ancient planet Earth definitely had more hidden treasures, but those hidden treasures were no longer something Qin Yu could pry into.

Just like the ancient ruins under the sea, no matter how hard Qin Yu’s physical body was, he couldn’t touch them.

In the next few days, everything became extremely peaceful.

As for the eighteen array platforms, there were still no abnormal movements. It had already been more than a month since the last time the holy region came.

This made the few mighty figures start to worry. They were afraid that the saint realm would only open this time.

Qin Yu was also a little worried, but he had never been a person who waited for death. He would never rely on others if he could catch someone in his hands.

He once again issued an announcement, collecting array flags, and informing the world that he had two array flags in his hands. If he could gather eight, they could work together to open the ancient array platform.

After making the announcement, Qin Yu arrived at the first secret realm.

There was an ancient array platform here, and at the same time, it was an extremely quiet place.

It’s time for me to go into seclusion, Qin Yu thought to himself.

He took out all the treasures in his hands and placed them in front of him.

Among them were Yan Ruoxue’s blood, the power of creation, and the divine sense that the sky blood rainbow had collected.

Qin Yu was the first to try to absorb the power of creation. This power of creation could still be absorbed into his body, but there was no increase in spiritual power.

This was undoubtedly a reckless waste of a heavenly gift, so he immediately stopped absorbing the power of creation.

The power of divine sense was the same principle, so Qin Yu did not try to absorb the power of divine sense.

As such, Qin Yu’s main target was Yan Ruoxue’s blood.

This blood could be said to be freakish for Qin Yu’s body’s improvement. Compared to the strengthening agent, it was many times stronger. Therefore, Qin Yu was still looking forward to it.

According to the words left behind by the guardian, the dual cultivation of Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue would bring the greatest improvement to their strength.

However, this was obviously impossible at the moment. Qin Yu did not dare to ask for too much.

He got up and walked out of the first mystic realm. He found all the tools, including the bathtub and other things.

After settling everything, Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “It took me several days to absorb the last time, and I haven’t completely absorbed it yet. I wonder how long it will take this time.”

After thinking for a long time, Qin Yu finally told Di Zun about this matter. He planned to ask Di Zun to keep an eye on it for him in case there was any news from the holy region.

Qin Yu walked out of the first mystic realm and returned to the Heaven Gate.

As soon as he returned to the Heaven Gate, Zhen Yue ran over in a hurry.

“Sect master, someone has issued a challenge to you!”Zhen Yue said anxiously.

Qin Yu was stunned. He couldn’t help but be surprised, but he soon guessed who it was.

“Jiang Yi?”Qin Yu frowned.

“How do you know?”Zhen Yue was stunned.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh bitterly and said, “It really is him.”

Jiang Yi was an opponent that Qin Yu didn’t want to meet. He was very talented and wasn’t weaker than the young masters of the aristocratic families in Jingdu.

If it weren’t for him, he wouldn’t have left Jiang he. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

This also made Qin Yu feel a bit ashamed.

“He has already made it public on the martial arts forum. He said that he regretted coming to the Heaven Gate for three days to fight with you,”Zhen Yue said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “I understand.”

“Sect Master Qin, I heard that this Jiang Yi seems to be at the half-step mighty realm. You... you have to be careful,”Zhen Yue said with a frown.

“Half-step Mighty Realm?”This surprised Qin Yu.

In this era, no one had stepped into the half-step mighty realm!

“Yes, so you have to be careful.”Zhen Yue’s beautiful eyes were somewhat worried.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said with a wry smile, “It’s very difficult for a half-step great being to pose a threat to me.”

Jiang Yi was very talented. His current strength had probably already surpassed those hidden great beings.

However, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid at all. With his current physical body, no one could hurt him.

Looks like I’ll have to postpone my seclusion again, Qin Yu thought to himself.

He stayed at the Heaven Gate and took advantage of these three days to give di zun some pointers.

Di Zun was Qin Yu’s first true disciple, and Qin Yu was very attentive to him.

He taught almost all of his spells to Di Zun.

Di Zun’s learning speed was also extremely fast, and his improvement could be said to be godly.

Following that, Qin Yu gave all of the heavenly materials and earthly treasures in his spatial magic artifact to Di Zun.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, three days were coming.

That night.

Qin Yu and Di Zun sat in the courtyard, drinking wine in boredom. They were quite comfortable.

“Master, is that Jiang Yi the one who took the order on Deer Emperor Island last time?”Di Zun asked.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Yes, that’s him.”

“Does that kid have a grudge against you?”Di Zun frowned and asked.

Qin Yu waved his hand, not knowing how to explain.

This was a rather complicated matter. There would be a battle between the two sooner or later. Now might be a good time.
