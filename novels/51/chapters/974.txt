Chapter 975: Chapter 975, Can You Beat Him

One by one, starlight-like lights landed on his fingers.

The power of destruction condensed on his fingers.

Feeling this power, everyone couldn’t help but look shocked!

Even the Sky Blood Rainbow couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Good technique,”the Sky Blood Rainbow praised slightly.

The ten lights of star seizer were bright and mysterious. The power contained in them made people not dare to look directly at them!

“Go to hell!”

Along with Zhai Xing’s furious roar, both of his hands reached out at the same time!

The ten plus internal Qi that were like stars instantly smashed towards the three white bones!

“Boom!”

A nuclear bomb-like explosion reverberated throughout the entire discussion martial hall!

The discussion martial hall instantly collapsed, and a terrifying aura quickly spread out in all directions!

Those who were weaker were directly smashed into minced meat by this aura!

Even Qin Yu and the others felt a trace of pressure!

The entire ground was smashed into pieces, and gusts of violent wind surged up.

In an instant, sand and stones flew, and the sky turned dark!

The power of the star picking hand far exceeded one’s imagination!

Even the Sky Blood Rainbow’s expression changed, as if he was shocked by this move!

Not far away, star picking panted slightly, and a trace of sweat appeared on his forehead.

It was obvious that the pressure the star seizer had exerted on him was also extremely great.

The light dissipated, and dust fell.

The three white bones were smashed into the ground!

White spots appeared on their bodies!

This result immediately made everyone despair!

Such a powerful move of the star seizer had only left behind white spots! Just how hard was this white bone?

“It’s over, even the star plucking hand can’t hurt them...”

“The body of a mighty figure lives up to its reputation.”

“It’s over, it’s over, I don’t want to die...”

Some people even burst into tears, their faces filled with despair.

“Hahahaha!”The Heavenly Blood Rainbow couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Is that all you’ve got? Star plucking, you’re Only So-so!”

Accompanied by Tian Xuehong’s furious roar, a white skeleton instantly appeared in front of Zhai Xing!

“Bang!”

A white fist smashed into Zhai Xing’s chest, and his body was instantly sent flying!

His body slid on the ground for dozens of meters, and blood continuously dripped out of his mouth!

Tian Xuehong looked coldly at Zhai Xing and said, “You reckless thing, still trying to stop my grand plan!”

Zhai Xing was lying on the ground, looking extremely miserable.

“Tian Xuehong, Stop!”Gu Xinghe rushed forward and blocked in front of Zhai Xing.

Tian Xuehong glanced at gu xinghe and snorted, “I’ll only give you face one last time. If there’s a next time, don’t blame me for being impolite.”

Gu Xinghe grunted in gratitude. He picked up Zhai Xing and turned around to leave.

Even Zhai Xing had lost.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Zhai Xing was the strongest person at the moment. Even Jiang he might not be a match for him.

Even he had lost. Who else could stop Tian Xuehong!

“Weng!”

At this moment, a bright light flashed not far away. A martial artist’s spiritual sense was directly extracted!

“Ah! !”

The person sitting next to him immediately screamed in fear. His face was deathly pale!

This made the already frightened people even more desperate.

When misfortune fell upon them, the fear was far greater than what they had heard.

The scene became extremely chaotic. Everyone was afraid that they would be the next person to be extracted!

“Oh, I forgot to tell you. The divination of the divine sense is random,”said Tian Xuehong indifferently.

“One second, it might be thousands of miles away. The next second... It might be you!”Tian Xuehong grinned, revealing his mouth full of white teeth.

The sounds of Pain were endless. Some people couldn’t bear the psychological pressure and fainted on the spot.

“Tian... Tian Xuehong, please spare me. I’m willing to work for you!”

At this moment, some people began to surrender to Tian Xuehong, trying to save their lives.

“I... I’m willing too! I’m willing to join the Slaughter Immortal sect and work for the Slaughter Immortal sect. I only beg for My Life!”

Looking at the Warriors kneeling on the ground and begging, the Sky Blood Rainbow couldn’t help but ridicule, “Work for me? Are you even worthy?”

He swept his gaze across the crowd and coldly said, “Your greatest use is to provide me with spiritual sense.”

The atmosphere of despair pervaded the entire discussion martial hall.

Some people were so scared that they collapsed to the ground, while others were so scared that their crotches turned yellow.

“Damn it!”Kong Yun’s face was full of anger.

“We absolutely can not allow him to continue doing evil!”

“Even Zhai Xing has lost. We are even less of a match for him.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“Then what should we do? Are We just going to sit and wait for death?”

Qin Yu looked at the few light pillars not far away and said in a deep voice, “If we want to stop this spell, I’m afraid we have to cut off this light pillar.”

Even so, the light pillars were too far away, so how could he cut them off?

The light pillars became thicker and thicker, and the light became brighter and brighter.

Tian Xuehong’s face was full of excitement. He took a deep breath and said, “It won’t take long for me to recover to my peak... hahaha!”

His laughter was like a demon, echoing throughout the entire discussion martial hall!

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and said, “Tie Dan, do you have a way to cut off those light pillars? Or let me escape?”

“You’re thinking too much. These light pillars aren’t something you can cut.”At this time, Iron Egg’s voice sounded in his mind.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Can’t cut them? Why?”

Iron egg ridiculed, “I’m afraid you don’t know how terrifying this technique is. Those eight light pillars aren’t material at all. How can you cut them?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his teeth and said, “Then how should I stop this technique?”

“Didn’t he say that this technique can’t be stopped? Back then, when the immortal slaying sect used this technique, no one could stop it,”tie Dan said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inwardly, “So, we can only sit and wait for death?”

“Yes,”tie Dan muttered in a low voice.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “If I lend you my body, can you defeat those white bones?”
