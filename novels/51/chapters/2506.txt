2507 Meteor Explosion

Qin Yu stood in the air, and the violent power in his body surged wildly toward the desolate divine eye.

Under Ruoxue’s help with all her might, he seemed to be able to find some clues at his moment, but there was not enough time.

In the golden desolate divine eye, the golden power of the pupil seemed to have materialized. It transformed into countless golden chains coiling around He Teng’s body.

“Why is this power a little familiar?”

The little loli tilted her head slightly and stared at the golden pupils in a puzzle.

He Teng had almost completely recovered in just a few seconds.

“You’re courting death! Qin Yu!”

At this moment, He Teng’s pupils emitted a scarlet light.

For some reason, when the golden gaze landed on him, he felt all his secrets exposed.

It was the first time he felt tremendously threatened after he betrayed the human race’s cosmic luck and obtained the baptism of the monster race’s Path of Heaven.

At this moment, He Teng’s body instantly doubled in size.

The ground behind him suddenly emitted a groaning sound as if it could no longer bear the weight, and countless gravels turned to dust and compressed again.

After that, it sank deep into the ground, forming an enormous demonic body crater.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s golden pupil power broke free again.

He Teng’s entire body sank deep into the ground like a meteorite. Along with a violent tremor, his body disappeared instantly from Qin Yu’s divine sense.

“Meteor, explode!”

Almost instantly, He Teng’s body strangely appeared above Qin Yu.

It almost took him less than a moment after he broke free from Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye.

“D*mn it! the wings have something strange!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. The crater was merely to conceal the movement of his true body.

At this moment, He Teng’s scarlet eyes fixed on Qin Yu. He turned his body sideways and smashed down directly from the sky.

Thump!

Everyone’s eardrums seemed to vibrate violently. It was all the power that He Teng compressed into his heart.

In an instant, a shocking power erupted from He Teng’s body.

As the heart contracted and squeezed, that terrifying force surged out like water breaking through a dam.

The terrifying force squeezed out of H’s heart, surging to his enormous elbow. In that strike, he suddenly exerted all his strength and aimed to subdue Qin Yu completely.

“Boom!”

A dull sound echoed, and nearly 90% of all living beings within a kilometer of He Teng suddenly made an exaggerated noise from their necks.

A terrifying force pressed down his neck and caused it to sink in by dozens of centimeters. It was as if flattening a spring.

Before he attacked, this elbow already had such terrifying power.

He was at the heart of this strike’s storm, engulfed in relentless gusts of fierce wind.

The terrifying and fierce winds even left horrible wounds on his skin.

“Qin Yu, go to hell!”

He Teng let out a roar that did not sound like a human’s voice, and then he swung his elbow at Qin Yu’s head.

“D*mn!”

The little loli’s expression changed drastically as if sensing the power fluctuation in her body.

In an instant, Xiang Yu raised his halberd again and locked onto her.

The little loli’s hair stood on end and was furious.

However, she dared not ignore the combined strength of the 5,000 eight-winged monster race.

“Alright, let’s kill this little b*stard this way!”

Hua Zhikong, seeing this scene, felt like bursting into laughter in his heart.

The battle between Qin Yu and the Fallen Godly King had unknowingly drawn the crowd’s attention.

Hua Zhikong, who was of the same generation as Qin Yu, felt he was the sand that could be seen everywhere by the sea.

He was so ordinary that it made him angry. He probably could not catch up with this kind of comprehension his entire life.

At this moment, Qin Yu instantly judged that this was He Teng’s full-powered attack.

He Teng locked down the space around him.

The air was as if filled with molten iron, and he could not even move his fingers.

“D*mn it, I’ll fight it out!”

Qin Yu could not avoid it, and he instantly calmed down instead.

In the face of that terrifying power, everyone heard six consecutive muffled explosions.

Six acupoints!

Vitality Gate acupoint!

Yintang acupoint!

Yongquan acupoint on the left and right! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Shaofu acupoint on the left and right!

That power started from the Vitality Gate acupoint. It rushed into the glabella, then Yongquan acupoint, and finally from the left to the right.

The power of his six acupoints gathered on his right index finger.

Qin Yu’s legs pierced into the void like the roots of a thousand-year-old tree. His left hand grabbed his right wrist with all his strength.

“Boom!”

“Burst!”

The power emitted a world-shaking sound as it suddenly slanted from Qin Yu’s finger.

Even Qin Yu had to exert all his strength to control the direction of the explosion.

He had no time to analyze the use of the technique.

Even if he used less strength to control it, this power was about to explode and hurt him.

As the power of this finger blasted out, Qin Yu’s body was instantly shaken by the terrifying rebound force into a layer of blood mist.

The explosive power of the six acupoints was comparable to the God-slaying Dusk.

However, the God-slaying Dusk was centered around Evil Eye and spread like a tsunami.

At this moment, Qin Yu controlled the explosive power of the six acupoints with a finger.

Its lethality was even more powerful.

“Hahaha!”

When the elbow and finger clashed, He Teng revealed a sinister smile.

The moment the two collided, an invisible energy wave spread in all directions.

A nuclear bomb seemed to have exploded, and no more living beings were within a radius of ten thousand miles.

The supreme experts were also pushed away by the terrifying shockwave. Those who were below the fourth-grade True Saint turned into dust instantly.

If not for the fact that the battle between the two had caused the surrounding living beings to avoid them frantically…

The lethality of this attack was probably even more terrifying.

“Huff! Huff! Huff!

“D*mned b*stard! You made me use my full strength to attack and waste my monster race’s Path of Heaven’s power of the origin! You deserve to die!”

He Teng let out a distorted roar. His final blow crashed into Qin Yu’s body like a meteor.

Even if Qin Yu used the power of his six acupoints, he could not resist this terrifying power.

The power of this attack far exceeded that of the God-slaying Dusk. It could be considered an unrivaled power under the Tribulation Sixth Level.

“What a terrifying power! Is the monster race’s Path of Heaven so powerful? It created such a powerful Fallen Godly King out of thin air.”

After launching this attack, despite many fifth-level human experts…
