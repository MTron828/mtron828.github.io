Hou Xin’s expression changed slightly, and he said coldly, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you really think I’ll believe your nonsense? The dispel poison pill formula you gave me is full of loopholes. Not only is it fake, but it can even trigger the poison in his body!”

“Hou Xin, if I’m not wrong, you should have given this fake dispel poison pill formula to quite a number of people, right?”

A trace of anxiety flashed across Hou Xin’s face as he said in a panic, “Don’t talk nonsense!”

Qin Yu continued, “Your pill formula should have been obtained from Wen Sheng’s hands, right?”

Hou Xin’s face instantly turned incomparably pale!

“I really don’t know what kind of method you used to trick Wen Sheng into trusting you,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Hou Xin exclaimed, “Don’t talk nonsense! I. . . I didn’t!”

“Didn’t?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“Hou Xin, you’re really a beast. Not only did you trick Wen Sheng into giving you the pill formula, but you also deliberately set someone up to kill him!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“In order to get rid of the competitors, in the herbs warehouse, you deliberately spread the news that I have the pill formula of the concentric pill. Your purpose was also to get rid of me, right?”

At this time, Hou Xin’s forehead was already covered in dense cold sweat.

He said in a panic, “No! Don’t talk nonsense! You are slandering me!”

Qin Yu sneered. “I don’t know whether I’m slandering you or not, but I only know that the formula for the concentric pill in Wen Sheng’s hand is incomplete!”

“An incomplete formula for the concentric pill not only doesn’t have any effect, but it will cause the poison to explode in the body!”

“Hou Xin, you want to kill Old Master Xue, right?”

Hou Xin’s eyes instantly widened as he said in a trembling voice, “Wh... what? That pill formula is actually incomplete?”

The moment these words were said, Qin Yu’s face instantly revealed a trace of a playful smile.

Hou Xin also realized that he had said the wrong thing, and his face instantly turned deathly pale!

Qin Yu raised his brows and said, “What, you admitted it just like that?”

Xue Yujie, who was standing at the side, strode forward and grabbed Hou Xin’s neck. He shouted angrily, “Tell me! Is what Qin Yu said true?!”

“No... No, he... lied!” Hou Xin said with some lack of confidence.

Qin Yu sneered at the side and said, “My words are already very clear. This prescription is incomplete. If Old Master Xue takes this pill, he will die on the spot.”

Xue Yujie became anxious when he heard this. He grabbed Hou Xin’s neck and said through gritted teeth, “Is what Qin Yu said true? If anything happens to my father after consuming this pill, I will make you beg for your life!”

Hou Xin was also panicking when he heard this, and he said with a trembling voice, “Mr. ... Mr. Xue, I. . . I did snatch Wen Sheng’s pill formula, but... but I really didn’t know that the pill formula was incomplete! I also didn’t know that an incomplete pill formula would cause death!”

“Mr. Xue, I have absolutely no intention of harming Old Master Xue!”

Xue Yujie said furiously, “You motherf * cker!”

After saying that, Xue Yujie slapped Hou Xin’s face!

And the pill that Hou Xin offered was crushed by Xue Yujie!

Qin Yu immediately heaved a sigh of relief inside.

In fact, all of this was Qin Yu’s guess.

The pill formula in Wen Sheng’s hands wasn’t incomplete. It was just that Qin Yu deliberately used it to trick Hou Xin.

That day, Qin Yu successfully found the pill formula in Wen Sheng’s room.

However, Qin Yu had already guessed that Hou Xin also had the pill formula, so he deliberately said these words, causing Hou Xin to be distrusted.

In this way, only Qin Yu had the concentric pill.

“Drag him away!” Xue Yujie waved his hand and said.

A few people immediately moved forward and dragged Hou Xin out.

Only Qin Yu was left at the scene. Xue Yuzhi looked at Qin Yu with a smile and said, “Qin Yu, you should have the complete concentric pill formula, right?”

“Of course.” Qin Yu said with a faint smile.

He flipped his palm and took out the concentric pill.

Then, Qin Yu handed the pill to Xue Yuzhi.

Xue Yuzhi took the pill and observed it carefully. Then, she nodded and said, “It is indeed the concentric pill.”

“Phew, thankfully.” Xue Yujie also heaved a sigh of relief.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Follow me. When my father wakes up, the Xue family will definitely reward you.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you, Mr. Xue.”

Then, Qin Yu followed behind the three people from the Xue family and walked toward a villa.

Old Master Xue was placed in the sunlight room on the top floor of the villa.

There were many bodyguards guarding this place, and the door was made of a special material.

He pushed the door open and entered. There was only a big bed in the huge room.

The sunlight shone through the glass into the room, and it was quite comfortable.

Xue Yujie held the concentric pill and walked in front of Old Master Xue. Then, he gently placed the pill into Old Master Xue’s mouth.

Qin Yu waited quietly by the side.

Time passed by minute by minute. After about ten minutes, Old Master Xue, who was lying on the bed, finally moved.

He suddenly opened his eyes, followed by a violent cough!

“Dad!”

The three members of the Xue family quickly stepped forward and supported Old Master Xue.

“Dad, you’re finally awake!”

Old Master Xue coughed non-stop and Xue Yuzhi gently patted his back.

A few minutes later, Old Master Xue suddenly spat out a mouthful of black blood.

This blood emitted a thick fishy smell, as if there was a poison spreading in it.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed, and a wisp of spiritual fire immediately extended out of his finger.

The flame fell on the blood and instantly vaporized it.

After spitting out the blood, Old Master Xue’s condition was obviously much better.

“Dad, how do you feel now?” The three Xue siblings said nervously.

Old Master Xue looked around in a daze and said, “What’s wrong with me?”

“Dad, you’ve been in a coma for several years.” The few of them told Old Master Xue everything that had happened.

Qin Yu didn’t stay here either. He immediately turned around and walked out of the room.

“Why did you come out?” The man with the mustache asked curiously.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “The father and children are having a private moment. Why should I stay inside?”

“What about the power of the Martial Saint? Did they agree?” The man with the mustache asked hurriedly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I haven’t mentioned it yet. Don’t worry, they will come looking for me.”

There were some things that couldn’t be rushed.

After returning to their residence, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache waited quietly in the room.

When evening arrived, Xue Yuzhi came to the room personally.
