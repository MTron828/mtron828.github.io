Chapter 302: Shocked Pharmacist! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Pharmacist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?” After his identity was revealed, the crowd’s reaction immediately changed!

Almost everyone looked at this young man in shock!

“So you’re the pharmacist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. Nice to meet you!”

“I am Sun Bao of the Sun family. It is my honor to meet you!”

Everyone’s respectful attitude was enough to show the position of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion in their hearts.

The pharmacist looked at the stall owner and said, “Sir, have you made your decision?”

The stall owner stood up and said respectfully, “So you’re the pharmacist. Forgive me for not being able to welcome you from afar.”

“No worries.” The pharmacist waved his hand proudly.

He took out ten Replenishing Pills and said, “This Purple Gold Gauze Cloth should belong to me now, right?”

The stall owner smiled and said, “Of course. You’re the pharmacist, so naturally I trust you more.”

“Wait!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly called out to the two of them.

The stall owner looked at Qin Yu with puzzlement and said, “Sir, is there anything else? Even if you really have the Fasting Pill, I would be more willing to cooperate with the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.”

“Did you hear that? Sir, the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth belongs to me.” The apothecary said with a nonchalant smile.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “What if I exchange it with a Breakthrough Pill?”

“Breakthrough Pill?” The stall owner seemed to be somewhat puzzled, while the apothecary beside him was filled with shock!

It was very obvious that this apothecary had heard of Breakthrough Pills.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Breakthrough Pills can be used to break through to an Inner Strength Grandmaster.”

Upon hearing these words, everyone immediately revealed expressions of shock!

“Sir, is what you said true?”

“Do you really have a Breakthrough Pill? If that’s the case, I’m willing to pay a high price to buy it!”

Qin Yu ignored them and looked at the stall owner.

The stall owner seemed to be somewhat conflicted. Although the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s pharmacist had a prestigious status, the allure of the Breakthrough Pill was too great.

“Two.” Qin Yu extended his finger.

The stall owner immediately wavered. He hurriedly said, “Really?”

“Really.” Qin Yu nodded.

“Hehe, don’t listen to his bragging.” At this moment, the pharmacist sneered.

“Although the Breakthrough Pill isn’t considered a sacred pill, it is still considered a top-grade one. I don’t even possess it, let alone him.” The pharmacist snorted lightly.

When the stall owner heard this, he immediately frowned.

The pharmacist continued, “Let me put it this way. Even in our Divine Alchemist Pavilion, there aren’t many who can refine the Breakthrough Pill, let alone him.”

“Even the apothecaries can’t refine it?”

“Then this kid must be lying!”

“D*mn, in order to obtain this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth, he’s getting really unscrupulous.”

Qin Yu glanced at the apothecary and said, “Even if you can’t refine it, it doesn’t mean that I can’t do it.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He looked at the stall owner and waited for his reply.

The stall owner was silent for a moment and said, “If you can really take out two Breakthrough Pills, this Purple Gold Gauze Cloth will be yours.”

“Okay, wait for me for an hour.” Qin Yu nodded and said.

The pharmacist sneered and said, “Are you really going to refine pills on the spot? What are you going to use to refine them? A lighter?”

Hearing this, everyone immediately burst into laughter.

Qin Yu ignored the apothecary’s ridicule and only stretched out his palm.

A wisp of Blue Spirit Fire immediately appeared in his palm.

When he saw this Spirit Fire, the Alchemist’s expression immediately changed drastically!

“Blue Spirit Fire? How is that possible?” The alchemist swallowed hard frantically!

Even he only had Red Spirit Fire!

One had to know that as long as one could produce a Spirit Fire, one would possess the qualifications to enter the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, let alone a Blue Spirit Fire?

“Who exactly are you?” The Alchemist asked with a face full of shock.

“Qin Yu.” Qin Yu said his name indifferently.

“Qin Yu? He’s the one known as the King of Chuzhou, right?”

“I heard that he had a fight with Master Gu not long ago!”

“What’s so impressive about fighting with Master Gu? He even dares to challenge the Han family! Do you dare to? In any case, I won’t dare to!”

“It’s said that the eldest daughter of the Yan family is his wife...”

The pharmacist stared at Qin Yu and said, “So you’re Qin Yu! I have heard of the rumors about you, but I don’t believe it.”

“I don’t need you to believe it,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Then, Qin Yu took out an ordinary stove from his Spatial Magic Artifact and refined the Breakthrough Pill on the spot!

This process was extremely long, but no one was willing to leave.

They all stared at Qin Yu, as if they were waiting for the result.

Time passed minute by minute, and the pill within the stove began to slowly take shape.

“Kacha!”

With a crisp sound, the stove couldn’t withstand this enormous force and actually shattered!

“Hahaha!” This apothecary couldn’t help but laugh loudly.

“You don’t even have a vessel, so how are you going to refine a pill? This is the first time I’ve heard of using a stove to refine a pill. You are simply a layman!” The apothecary said with a cold smile.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He raised his palm and a golden light suddenly appeared!

After that, the flame was thrown into Qin Yu’s palm.

Streams of jade-green medicinal liquid were refined in Qin Yu’s palm once again!

“What? He actually used his palm as a vessel?”

“This... This is too unbelievable!”

Even the alchemist was dumbstruck! He had never seen such a technique before!

Although Qin Yu controlled the Spirit Fire, when the Spirit Fire left his body and returned to his palm, he could still feel the intense power of the Spirit Fire!

Not long after, the golden light that lingered on Qin Yu’s hand shattered! The Spirit Fire was approaching Qin Yu’s palm!

“Clang!”

After Qin Yu’s palm touched the Spirit Fire, it immediately emitted waves of thick smoke!

The intense pain was unbearable!

Qin Yu could naturally feel the pain coming from his palm, but he gritted his teeth and didn’t have the slightest intention of giving up!

This time, even the stall owner was somewhat moved!

Qin Yu was a little too desperate!

“Buzz!”

Finally, an hour later, Qin Yu’s palm shone!

The Breakthrough Pill had formed!
