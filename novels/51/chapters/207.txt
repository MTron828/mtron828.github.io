Chapter 208: The Furious Yan Ruoxue! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s expression was cold and he didn’t say a word.

His body was tied up by a few large iron chains and he couldn’t move.

Yuan Hong stared at Qin Yu and snorted coldly. “I really don’t like this unruly attitude of yours.”

Qin Yu closed his eyes and ignored Yuan Hong.

This undoubtedly infuriated Yuan Hong even more.

“Brat, remember to control your personality in your next life!” Yuan Hong shouted angrily. Then, he opened his hands, and instantly, rays of light shone from the surroundings!

This formation seemed to be similar to the formation that Qin Yu had set up back then!

However, Yuan Hong’s formation seemed to be even more powerful!

Following the activation of the formation, Yuan Hong’s body began to glow!

He stomped his feet, and his body soared into the air. Then, two huge blades condensed in his hands!

“Go to hell!” Yuan Hong roared angrily, and then he pressed down!

In an instant, the two huge blades hacked at Qin Yu fiercely from the highest altitude!

“Bang!”

The two huge blades struck Qin Yu’s chest without any deviation!

But a shocking scene happened!

The two giant blades didn’t hurt Qin Yu at all. They only left a white mark on his body!

“Huh?” Yuan Hong raised his eyebrows.

“What a tough body! As expected of the person who won against Jiang Gu!” Yuan Hong exclaimed.

Qin Yu glanced at Yuan Hong and sneered. “Are you tickling me?”

Yuan Hong laughed and said, “Don’t worry, Qin Yu, this is just the beginning!”

Then, Yuan Hong roared again, and the qi energy on his body exploded again!

Obviously, this formation could provide him with even more powerful strength!

“Qin Yu, I want to see how tough your body is!” Yuan Hong roared again and again!

There was another wave of crushing power!

Under this huge force, Qin Yu’s body couldn’t hold on any longer.

His skin cracked, and streaks of blood appeared!

The excruciating pain made Qin Yu’s forehead drip with sweat!

“Hahaha! How is it, Qin Yu? Are you comfortable?” Yuan Hong laughed crazily.

Two golden whips actually appeared in his hands!

Yuan Hong held the whips and said slowly, “This technique is called the Spirit Whip. Not only can it hurt your physical body, but it can also destroy your spirit.”

“Although the Spirit Whip in my hand is only an illusion, it still contains a trace of power.”

“Qin Yu, I will let you enjoy this pain!”

Yuan Hong held the long whip in his hand and lashed it at Qin Yu’s body!

Under this whip, a bloody scar immediately appeared on Qin Yu’s body!

Just as Yuan Hong said, this technique not only hurt the body, but also the soul!

Qin Yu felt as if his head had been struck by lightning and he felt excruciating pain!

“Slap!”

He received another whip!

As if Yuan Hong was intentionally torturing Qin Yu, the whip in his hand was continuously lashing towards Qin Yu’s body!

The repeated mental torture caused Qin Yu to feel so much pain that he wished he was dead!

His body was also covered with densely packed bloody scars!

“Ah...”

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but moan in pain under this torture!

“Hahahaha!” Yuan Hong burst into laughter.

“Qin Yu, you’ve endured 12 lashes. The highest record here is 17 lashes. I wonder how long you can last?” Yuan Hong sneered. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He tried his best to stay awake with his strong will.

“The Martial Arts Association... is actually this vicious...” Qin Yu glared at him with anger!

Who knew how many people had been tortured to death in pain!

Qin Yu was definitely not the first!

“Slap!”

Another whip came down on him!

Yuan Hong’s face was filled with madness as he waved the golden whip in his hand.

Every whip hit Qin Yu’s body firmly!

In the blink of an eye, it was the sixteenth whip!

Qin Yu’s consciousness began to blur.

His entire body was drenched in blood, and it was almost impossible to see his appearance clearly!

“You can withstand it quite well.” Yuan Hong sneered.

“Next is the seventeenth whip. I want to see if you can withstand it!” Yuan Hong shouted angrily.

The seventeenth whip fell!

Under this whip, Qin Yu’s flesh split open. He felt as if his head was about to explode!

However, what was surprising was that Qin Yu was still conscious!

He had his eyes wide open as he glared at Yuan Hong!

“Huh? Looks like you’re going to break the record.” Yuan Hong snorted coldly.

He held the long whip and whipped again!

One whip, two whips, three whips...

In the blink of an eye, another five whips fell!

And Qin Yu had already endured 22 lashes!

“You have such strong willpower.” Yuan Hong panted heavily with a drop of sweat dripping from his forehead.

He even felt a trace of fear in his heart!

A person with such willpower would definitely be able to accomplish great things in the future!

No wonder Jiang Gu wanted to get rid of Qin Yu no matter what!

“Damn it, I will definitely whip you to death today!” Thinking of this, Yuan Hong flew into a rage.

He held the whip and whipped Qin Yu with all his might.

The huge force caused Qin Yu’s body to completely collapse before revealing his sparkling white bones! It looked terrifying!

Under such torture, even the people beside him couldn’t stand it anymore!

“F * ck, how can there be such a freak in the world?!” When Yuan Hong whipped the 30th whip, his expression became even uglier!

Being able to withstand 17 lashes was already considered a freak. By 30 lashes, he was probably a monster!

“Qin Yu, I’ve played enough with you.” Yuan Hong gritted his teeth.

“This whip will smash your head!” Yuan Hong’s expression was ice-cold, and his face was filled with malice.

He activated the formation, and the whip in his hand flashed with a golden light!

Following that, Yuan Hong grabbed the whip and ruthlessly lashed it towards Qin Yu’s head!

If this whip were to land, it would probably smash Qin Yu’s head into pieces!

“Go to hell!” Yuan Hong roared crazily!

Just as the whip was about to land on Qin Yu’s head, light flashed past!

In the blink of an eye, he saw a young man dressed in black holding onto the whip with one hand!

“The Martial Arts Association is quite cruel,” the young man said coldly.

Yuan Hong’s expression changed. He tried to pull back the whip, but he couldn’t move it at all!

“Who... who are you?!” Yuan Hong was both shocked and afraid.

“I’m Yan Jiang, from Jingdu’s Yan family,” the young man spat out a few words coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking, a car sped over.

As soon as the car stopped, Yan Ruoxue walked out in a hurry.

When she saw Qin Yu, who had been beaten until he was bleeding and his consciousness was fading, Yan Ruoxue’s expression instantly became extremely cold!

Her anger caused her body to tremble slightly!

“You... how dare you treat him like this...” Yan Ruoxue’s voice trembled. Although her long hair covered her face, one could still sense her anger!

“I will never let you off the hook!” Yan Ruoxue suddenly raised her head and glared at Yuan Hong!

Yuan Hong only felt a chill on his back. An ominous premonition enveloped his entire body!
