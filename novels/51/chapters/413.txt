Cao Shan’s expression changed drastically! He glared at Xiao Cheng and shouted, “Xiao Cheng! You’re not a man of your word! How can you burn bridges?!”

Xiao Cheng sneered. “Burn bridges? Your ability determines your value. In my eyes, you no longer have any value.”

“You!” Cao Shan was so angry that he was trembling. A strong murderous aura burst out from inside him.

But he knew very well that he wasn’t Xiao Cheng’s match at all.

If they really fought, he definitely wouldn’t have the upperhand.

Therefore, at this moment, Cao Shan could only place his hopes on Qin Yu in hopes that Qin Yu wouldn’t agree to Xiao Cheng’s invitation.

“How about it? No matter what kind of conditions you demand, Hong Yi Sect will give it to you,” Xiao Cheng continued.

“With your talent, you can go overseas to study for a few years. Once you return, even the Yan family in Jingdu won’t be worth mentioning!”

Such a high evaluation was indeed shocking.

Qin Yu, who was suppressed by the divine seal, had a cold smile on his face.

“Since you betrayed Cao Shan, you will definitely betray me,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Xiao Cheng repeatedly waved his hand and said, “No, no, no. you’re different from him.”

As he spoke, Xiao Cheng glanced at Cao Shan and continued, “Cao Shan can only stay in the tiny Yunchuan City for the rest of his life. Currently, he is already at the peak of his life.”

“But you’re different, Qin Yu. you’re so young and have unlimited potential! Your special physique is filled with unlimited possibilities!”

“If you’re willing, it is possible for you to become the leader of the Hong Yi Sect in the future!”

Xiao Cheng’s offer was indeed tempting. Even Cao Shan, who was standing at the side, felt envy.

The leader of the Hong Yi Sect! The wealth that he would control wouldn’t be the slightest bit inferior to those top-tier aristocratic families!

“How about it? Qin Yu, are you willing to join the Hong Yi Sect?” Xiao Cheng asked. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu sneered. “Our pursuits are different. To me, wealth is just a worldly possession.”

“As for the leader of Hong Yi Sect, that isn’t even worth mentioning. As long as I am willing, I will definitely be able to establish an aristocratic family sect that will surpass the Hong Yi Sect in the future.”

Xiao Cheng wasn’t angry. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I know you well, Qin Yu. Your only pursuit now is the Yan family’s oldest daughter, right?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, which was a tacit agreement.

Xiao Cheng snorted coldly and said, “Big shots won’t care about a mere woman! In a hundred years, they will only be skeletons!”

“In the future, all kinds of women will kneel at your feet. Why should you care about the Yan family’s daughter?!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “That’s why I said that our pursuits are different.”

“She is my one and only. Moreover, without Yan Ruoxue, I wouldn’t be where I am today.”

“If I betray my benefactor, what would be the difference between me and a beast?”

These words made Xiao Cheng’s expression turn livid.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “So you’re determined to reject me?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu didn’t hesitate.

Hearing Qin Yu’s answer, Cao Shan, who was beside him, finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“Mr. Xiao, hurry up and kill him. There’s no need to talk nonsense with him!” Cao Shan, afraid that Qin Yu would change his mind, urged anxiously.

Xiao Cheng ignored Cao Shan. Instead, he looked coldly at Qin Yu and continued, “Have you ever thought that if you don’t agree, you will die here today?!”

“If you die, there’s no longer any need to talk about ideals!”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “I don’t think I will die.”

“Oh really?” Xiao Cheng’s expression turned completely cold.

“I admit that you’re talented, but there’s a prerequisite, which is that you can grow up. Currently, you still don’t have the capabilities to boast!”

As he spoke, Xiao Cheng had already clenched his fist and stood up!

A terrifying qi energy was approaching Qin Yu’s face!

The power of this punch far surpassed Cao Shan’s! Before the punch arrived, the gust of wind from the fist had already shattered the ground!

“Clang!”

The fist landed firmly on Qin Yu’s face, but what surprised Xiao Cheng was that it only left an inconspicuous mark on Qin Yu’s face.

Not to mention his broken bones and tendons, but even his skin couldn’t be broken!

“What a strong body!” Xiao Cheng sighed inside.

This also made him want to recruit Qin Yu even more!

“Qin Yu, are you really not considering it?” Xiao Cheng asked coldly.

“You talk too much nonsense,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Okay!” Xiao Cheng reached out his hand, and a long sword immediately appeared out of thin air!

This long sword was a treasure of the Hong Yi Sect. Although it wasn’t as good as Qin Yu’s bronze sword, it was definitely not something that an ordinary weapon could compare to!

“No matter how strong your physical body is, I can still kill you.” Xiao Cheng looked down from above and pointed his sword at the tip of Qin Yu’s nose.

A faint light burst out from his palm.

The light and the long sword fused together and instantly burst out with an extraordinary splendor!

The blade seemed to have been strengthened and became incomparably sharp!

“Let me do it!” Cao Shan volunteered!

Xiao Cheng glanced at him and then handed the sword to Cao Shan.

“Remember, don’t destroy too much skin,” Xiao Cheng reminded.

Cao Shan nodded and said, “Mr. Xiao, don’t worry!”

After saying that, he held the sword and walked towards Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, don’t you want to take revenge for Yan Jiang? Hehe, I’ll send you to see him now!” Cao Shan’s face had a sinister smile on it.

Qin Yu sized up Cao Shan and said, “Do you really think you can defeat me?”

Cao Shan laughed loudly and said, “Currently, you’re already unable to move. What can you do?”

Qin Yu’s expression was calm as he said indifferently, “Have you heard of a spell that specializes in divine sense?”

“Huh?” Cao Shan was stunned.

“Divine... Judgment!”

Before Cao Shan could react, Qin Yu’s spell had already been unleashed!

In an instant, Cao Shan’s mind felt as if it had been struck by lightning!

It was as if a golden sword had flown out from between Qin Yu’s brows and headed straight for Cao Shan’s divine sense!

“Puff!”

In the blink of an eye, Cao Shan’s divine sense had vanished into thin air!

This was Divine Judgment, the technique that Qin Yu had used to deal with Hui Ming!

No matter how strong your physical body was, it wasn’t worth mentioning before the divine judgment!

As for Qin Yu, who had stepped on the stairway to heaven, the power of his divine sense was far from what Cao Shan could compare to!

“Boom!”

Cao Shan’s corpse fell to the ground.

Xiao Cheng’s expression changed drastically! He felt even more uneasy!

“It’s your turn.” Qin Yu raised his head and sneered.
