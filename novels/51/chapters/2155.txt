2156 Peach Blossom Island

The expression on her face could not help but make one’s heart ache. Uncle Yan was silent and stood quietly by her side.

“Uncle Yan, I’ve implicated you,” Yan Ruoxue suddenly opened her mouth and said after a while.

Uncle Yan shook his head and said, “I’m afraid we’ve brought about a great disaster this time. Qin Yu… I’m afraid it would be very tough for him to overcome the ordeal this time.”

At the mention of Qin Yu, an unconcealable pain flashed across Yan Ruoxue’s face.

Of course, she knew what the failure meant. Now that the Yan family was determined to attack her, the negotiation in a few days would definitely be disadvantageous to Qin Yu.

At this moment, a tall figure suddenly appeared beside them.

Seeing this person, Uncle Yan hurriedly bowed and greeted, “Holy Lord.”

Yan Ruoxue sat there without any reaction. She did not even care about him.

“The cause of this matter is arising from your negligence,” Yan Tianshi suddenly said coldly.

Uncle Yan’s expression changed slightly, but he dared not refute it.

“If it weren’t for your negligence, what happened subsequently wouldn’t have happened,” Yan Tianshi continued.

“It’s all my fault,” Uncle Yan said in a deep voice.

Yan Tianshi slowly raised his hand and said, “Considering you have served the Yan family for many years, I will spare your life. However, you will be imprisoned in the sky prison for a hundred years from tomorrow onward.”

Uncle Yan’s expression turned ugly when he heard this, but he dared not go against the Holy Lord’s orders. He could only bow and say, “I understand.”

“If you want Uncle Yan to go to the sky prison, put me in as well,” Yan Ruoxue suddenly said coldly.

“Do you know how much trouble you’ve caused?” Yan Tianshi frowned and said. “This matter has disgraced the Yan family!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, that’s why I asked you to lock me up in the sky prison,” Yan Ruoxue sneered and said.

Yan Tianshi looked angry but could not do anything to Yan Ruoxue.

After hesitating for a while, Yan Tianshi said in a deep voice, “I can let him go, but I have a condition. You are not allowed to follow me to the negotiations tomorrow.”

Obviously, this was Yan Tianshi’s true objective.

Unfortunately, Yan Ruoxue did not buy it. She rejected it without thinking, “I disagree.”

“Then let him go to the sky prison!”

“I disagree either!”

Yan Tianshi opened his mouth but could only curse in his heart.

This little girl was a little too overbearing!

The most infuriating thing was that he could not do anything to her.

After a moment of silence, Yan Tianshi snorted and left.

After leaving Mount Donghuang, an elder walked to Yan Tianshi’s side, cupped his hands, and said, “Holy Lord, in that case, let’s bring the saintess along.”

Yan Tianshi glanced at him and said coldly, “It will definitely ruin things if I bring her along. It’s impossible at all to get rid of Qin Yu in front of her.”

The elder smiled and said, “Holy Lord, why don’t you change your way of thinking? Do you think Qin Yu will obediently give in? Dean Lei will definitely protect him if he doesn’t give in.”

Yan Tianshi frowned. He did not say anything and waited for him to continue.

The elder continued, “We can use the saintess to threaten Qin Yu into accepting all our conditions…”

Hearing this, Yan Tianshi’s expression turned cold. He immediately shouted, “What nonsense are you spouting? Do you want to use Ruoxue as a bargaining chip?”

Seeing Yan Tianshi being angry, the elder hurriedly knelt and did not say a word.

Yan Tianshi snorted coldly. Without saying anything else, he turned around and left.

Soon, it was the day of negotiations.

On this day, almost all the major sects arrived at Peach Blossom Island, and there was no lack of Holy Lords from the sects.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu followed Dean Lei and rushed to Peach Blossom Island.

Although the name Peach Blossom Island sounded beautiful, the island was surrounded by endless desolation in reality.

From time to time, a strange smell would assail the nostrils, making people feel incredibly uncomfortable.

Qin Yu stood under Peach Blossom Island and looked at the surrounding environment. He could not help but frown.

“Is the Prince of Great Xia placed in such a place…” Qin Yu muttered.

Dean Lei glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Take care of yourself first. This negotiation will not be simple.”

Qin Yu nodded and followed Dean Lei to Peach Blossom Island.

Although the surrounding environment of Peach Blossom Island was tremendously bad, the scenery on the island was beautiful.

Peach Blossom Island was like a treasure abandoned in the endless chaos. It was desolate and lonely, but the island was full of endless vitality and hope. At the center of the island stood a massive mountain range. At a glance, one could see peach blossom forests around the mountain range. They were vibrant and colorful, like a dream and an illusion.

But when Qin Yu took a closer look, he realized these flowers and plants These flowers and plants seem to be artificially planted by humans and cultivated with spiritual energy. They did not grow naturally.

It was evident that although this place looked like a paradise, it was merely a prison used to imprison and monitor the Prince of Grand Xia.

Looking up, he saw many magical artifacts scatter all over the sky. These magical artifacts emitted a tremendous mysterious internal qi as if they could deliver a fatal blow at any time.

Qin Yu’s brows furrowed even more tightly. The situation of the Prince of Great Xia was probably even more difficult than he had imagined.

As they continued to move forward, they saw several graceful figures. There were hundreds of women on the island!

These women were dressed in chiffon-like clothes and held different tools in their hands. Some were holding brushes and ink and were writing on bamboo slips by the side of the path. Every word that flowed under the brushes was filled with elegance and grace as if it was dancing.

Some were holding the pipa in their hands and playing alone in the peach blossom forest. The sound of the pipa echoed on the peach blossom island, as melodious as a clear spring. Some were holding swords in their hands and dancing. The Spiritual Energy Swords were sharp, and the peach petals were blown away by their Spiritual Energy Swords. At this moment, they were like goddesses.

Regardless of what these women were doing, they all exuded an elegant and mysterious temperament. Their skin was as fair as snow, and their long hair was like clouds. They were like fairies descending to the mortal world. However, in their eyes, there was a profound melancholy and loneliness that made one unable to resist the urge to approach them and alleviate their sorrows.

It was not exaggerating to say that these women were all extraordinary, and their bodies had a sense of charm.

Obviously, the purpose of their existence was to get pregnant with the Prince of Great Xia and to take control of the spirit coins.

“The nine great aristocratic families have indeed taken a lot of effort to get control of the spirit coins,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, the Prince of Great Xia, accompanied by two elders, arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“Dean Lei…” The prince bowed slightly to express his respect for Dean Lei.

“Your Highness, you’re too polite.”

Although Great Xia had fallen, Dean Lei still accorded him proper etiquette and decorum.
