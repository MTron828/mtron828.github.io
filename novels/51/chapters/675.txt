Chapter 676: Jumping Into the Fire Pit! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, the man with the mustache was dumbfounded.

He touched Qin Yu’s forehead and said, “Are you... crazy? Do you know what you’re talking about?”

Qin Yu stared at the fire pit with a serious look and said, “As long as this True Fire can’t kill me, I can try.”

The man with the mustache mumbled, “You’re really a madman. This is True Fire. If you’re not careful, you might turn into a pile of dust.”

Qin Yu didn’t say much, but a strong desire arose in his heart.

If he could really temper his body to the point where it was indestructible, then even if his realm wasn’t high enough, his strength would still be strong enough.

“You should go first. After a while, go to the Green Moon Villa to find me.” Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache widened his eyes and said, “Are you really going to jump into this pit of fire?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu made up his mind.

He clenched his fists and walked toward this pit of fire step by step.

“Look for me at the Green Moon Villa in about a month,” Qin Yu said seriously.

The man with the mustache kept mumbling, “What a lunatic. How can I have met a lunatic like you?”

Just as Qin Yu was about to jump in, several powerful internal qi suddenly approached the two of them!

After sensing this internal qi, Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

“Someone is coming,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The man with the mustache also nodded and said, “And the internal qi is not weak. They’re at least at the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis realm.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said in a low voice, “These people actually chased me here... It seems that they are determined to kill me.”

The man with the mustache muttered, “I won’t accompany you. See you at the Green Moon Villa in a month.”

After saying this, the man with the mustache planned to escape.

However, at this moment, three purple-robed men had already walked over!

A terrifying internal qi instantly enveloped the entire desert!

The three people coldly looked at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, do you think that you can escape death by running here?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Sure enough, you are from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association... you guys are really persistent.”

“Cut the crap. You have to die today.” One of the purple-robed men slowly raised his hand.

The man with the mustache next to him hurriedly muttered, “This has nothing to do with me. I... I’m just a passerby.”

The purple-robed man glanced at him and sneered. “You can stay too!”

Hearing this, the man with the mustache ran away! His speed was astonishing!

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but swallow hard.

This speed... was probably even faster than the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique!

The three purple-robed men looked in the direction the man with the mustache had left in and couldn’t help but snort coldly. “He actually escaped.”

The other purple-robed man said, “Forget it. He’s just a nobody. Our target is Qin Yu.”

The three of them nodded in unison and then walked towards Qin Yu sep by step.

Qin Yu stood beside the fire pit and said coldly, “Do you really want to kill me?”

“What do you think?” The purple-robed man said with a cold smile.

“Do you really think that with Ye Qing protecting you, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association won’t be able to do anything to you?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “I’ve never thought of asking others to protect me! You want to kill me? Fine, then let’s do it!”

After a fierce shout, the purple-robed men’s internal qi immediately erupted! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

They originally thought that Qin Yu was going to put up a big fight, but unexpectedly, Qin Yu turned around and jumped into the fire pit.

“If you want to kill me, then come down!” Qin Yu said coldly.

The three purple-robed men frowned slightly and immediately ran towards the fire pit.

They lowered their heads to look at the fire pit and couldn’t help but frown. “This is... True Fire?”

“This kid actually jumped into True Fire. Has he gone mad?”

The three of them looked at each other. For a moment, they seemed to be unable to make up their minds.

“Under normal circumstances, jumping into True Fire would definitely result in death. However, miracles always happen to this guy. It is better to be cautious,” one of them said coldly.

Many times, they thought that Qin Yu would definitely die this time. However, every time, Qin Yu would jump out.

Therefore, this time, they definitely wouldn’t let Qin Yu off easily.

The few of them looked at each other, and then a purple-robed man walked in front of the True Fire.

He raised his hand and reached out towards the flame.

The moment he touched the fire pit, the flame rushed over wildly and swallowed his palm!

The purple-robed man’s expression immediately changed drastically, and he hurriedly withdrew his hand.

But even so, his palm was still badly burned, revealing his white bones!

“As expected of True Fire...” the purple-robed man’s expression changed.

The pain from his palm made his face sweat profusely.

“True Fire isn’t something that one’s body can withstand. This guy will definitely die if he jumped in,” another purple-robed man said coldly.

The three of them looked at each other, not knowing what to do.

“I heard Qu Xie say that this kid is crazy. He will do anything,” another purple-robed man said.

“If he can find a way to avoid the True Fire, he will be safe and sound in this fire pit,” another purple-robed man said with a nod.

“Impossible. Even if he has a secret technique, it won’t last long.”

The three of them thought about it and finally decided to wait in front of the fire pit.

This time, they wanted to see him in person if he was alive and his corpse if he was dead!

Under the fire pit, Qin Yu’s body continued to fall. During the process of falling, his body was burnt until his skin and flesh were split open!

The flames seemed to have been angered by Qin Yu’s provocative attitude. All the flames surged wildly and tried to cling onto Qin Yu’s body with all their might!

The intense pain made Qin Yu’s expression distorted!

The sweat on his body evaporated in an instant!

“Ah...”

The intense pain made Qin Yu moan softly.

He took a look at his body. The flesh and blood on his body had begun to rot under the corrosion of the flames!

However, Qin Yu wasn’t worried. After stepping into the Golden Core Stage, his flesh and blood would regenerate.

What really worried Qin Yu was his bones!

If his bones were burned into ashes, then even if his Golden Core wasn’t damaged, he would die without a doubt!

This kind of pain was beyond imagination, but when the pain reached a certain level, it would still take a person’s life!

However, Qin Yu’s firm will made him keep his eyes wide open while maintaining his consciousness!

The more it was like this, the clearer the pain became.

Qin Yu’s body melted at a speed visible to the naked eye. Under the invasion of the flames, all his flesh and blood actually evaporated!

Very soon, sparkling white bones were revealed from Qin Yu’s body. His flesh and blood were almost burned clean!

“It depends on whether these bones can withstand it.” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said firmly.

If his bones were also burned, then Qin Yu would definitely die!

Soon, the flames covered Qin Yu’s white bones. The terrifying temperature made Qin Yu’s bones extremely painful!

The flames covered every inch of Qin Yu’s bones and began to erode them.

“Crack!”

Soon, Qin Yu’s bones couldn’t withstand it anymore and a crisp sound was heard!
