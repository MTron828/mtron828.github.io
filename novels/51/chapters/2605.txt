Chapter 2606: Change of Circumstances

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu put on the cloak and surprisingly discovered it could conceal his internal qi completely, blocking others from detecting him.

“On this trip, you must use a mirror to record everything that happened in detail. You will surely suffer severe injury if you send the information to the city.”

An officer said loudly to everyone.

“There are three secret passages leading out of the city that can reach the forest nearly a kilometer from the enemy camp. In a short while, the cavalry in the city will ride out to provoke the enemy to attract their attention. As soon as you hear the clash, move out immediately.”

The officer carefully arranged all the tasks.

Following his order, another commando team’s elites entered the various passages.

The officer looked on from the side and did not seem to force them to take any specific path.

Almost everyone subconsciously looked at Li Yue, including the two living beings of the demon race previously.

Although they did not hand over anything, they could still appreciate the power the chessboard demonstrated.

Li Yue closed his eyes and ignored the crowd.

Countless balls of light of various shapes entered the chessboard in his hands, on which various shimmering lines of different lusters flickered, but no one could understand them.

“I choose the third path.”

Qin Yu sneered and said. He ignored Li Yue and jumped into the third path straight away.

Shen Qian followed Qin Yu to jump into the pit without hesitation, followed by Ju Wuwei and Bufan.

“You all still have ten seconds.”

The officer looked at the crowd indifferently and said.

“I choose the middle path but won’t go first.”

Li Yue smiled and said.

“Ten.” “Nine.” “Two.”

“One.

Obviously, he did not want others to know which path he chose.

Most of the people chose to go down the second passage. Two people were also waiting at the entrance of the underground passage, waiting for Li Yue’s final choice.

“Zero!”

With the final call out, a crisp metallic unsheathing noise rang out.

The heads of the two flew up while Li Yue had already closed his eyes at the last call out.

He placed the chessboard horizontally in front of his neck, and with the power of the saber qi, his body forcefully rolled into the third passage.

In this narrow passage, Qin Yu and the others were slowly advancing.

The dark and damp cave exuded a foul odor, seemingly the stench of decaying bodies for many days, making one feel nauseous by merely smelling it. “Brother Qin Yu, why didn’t we wait for Li Yue’s chessboard before coming down?”

Shen Qian followed behind Qin Yu and asked in doubt.

Although he did not fully understand it, he knew that the chessboard was similar to Daoist deductions, and it could more or less provide some guidance for avoiding misfortune.

It would naturally be best if he could follow Li Yue.

“The Way of Deduction can only reveal some high-probability outcomes. Even if he could truly deduce the fate of the future, it would undoubtedly be left to Li Yue himself if there’s only a glimmer of hope and benefit. It’s better to use one’s own strength and fight for a path of survival.”

Qin Yu shook his head.

Initially, he had wanted to cooperate with Li Yue. However, when it came to the divination of the chessboard, even adding one more person would lead to a completely different outcome.

It was just like how the first path was originally the path of life, but after so many people entered the first path together, the outcome of the chessboard would definitely change.

It was similar to Qin Yu’s eight trigram deduction. Therefore, even Li Yue would not be completely sincere to others. In that case, he might as well take action himself to seize a glimmer of hope.

A few of them were wrapped in cloaks, advancing slowly.

At the same time, Qin Yu felt a barrier-like force suddenly enveloping them.

A trace of dark energy was in Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, and a ghostly energy suddenly crouched on his shoulder. Ju Wuwei also felt it and was about to slash the ghost away.

“Don’t attack. That guy is coming.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

He saw Li Yue walking over with a candle in his hand. His eyes could not see the flickering candlelight.

On the contrary, he could see the lit candle under the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, and the scene was very eerie.

“Spirit Candle. It’s the mystery item I exchanged for this time. Seifer can’t detect us within the range of this candle, but it’s hard to say if we cause a huge commotion.” Li Yue said calmly.

“But, the candle isn’t lit.’

Shen Qian asked curiously.

Qin Yu stopped Shen Qian and stared at Li Yue.

“Why did you choose this path?”

“I only choose the path with the greatest hope. It’s a losing move if I go alone and rely solely on the cloak. Using the cloak alone can’t avoid Seifer’s scrutiny.” Li Yue narrowed his eyes and said.

At this moment, as the Spirit Candle was burning, the internal qi it emitted entered their nostrils, and their bodies began to emit a foul internal qi.

“If you are sincere in cooperating, don’t play any tricks. Otherwise, I will risk my life in exchange for yours.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“I know. Only by following you guys can we make this chessboard work. I also need your guys’ protection. Let me remind you that this Spirit Candle is only effective within 100 meters. If it goes beyond 100 meters, Seifer will immediately sense it. At that time, we will be doomed. Moreover, there are only three candles in total. We need to obtain enough merit points before they burn out.”

Lu Yue was not angered by Qin Yu’s words and explained softly.

At this moment, besides Qin Yu, Ju Wuwei, Bufan, Shen Qian, and Li Yue, there were also Fang Xiang and Liu Da. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

They had also chosen this path. Seeing Li Yue choose this path in the end, the two could not help but reveal a trace of joy on their faces.

Qin Yu slowed down his pace when he was almost at the end of the road.

At this moment, they could hear the heavy footsteps of the ogres as well as the loud sounds of interaction.

Drops of mucus dripped from the soil, seeping into their hair, clothes, and even their faces.

He did not know if the mucus was their saliva or something else.

Qin Yu could not care less about feeling disgusted. There were ten ogres or so above them but without giant ogres.

His Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could now see within about 30 meters. Qin Yu walked around and confirmed that no other ogres were around before returning to his original spot.

“There are 12 ogres above. After the cavalry attacks, kill them immediately, and don’t let them utter a sound.”

Qin Yu marked the locations of the 12 ogres one by one, signaling everyone to get prepared.

“If these ogres die, will it attract Seifer’s attention?”

Ju Wuwei asked in a deep voice.

“I don’t think so. Ogres aren’t very intelligent, and there are often conflicts between groups. As long as it’s not a large-scale death, there shouldn’t be any problems.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice..
