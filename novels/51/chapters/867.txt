Chapter 868: Chapter 868, breaking through to the Martial Saint Realm?

While they were talking, waves of dark blue internal Qi suddenly drifted out from the depths of the Han palace.

This internal Qi and the heavy snow seemed to merge into one.

When they saw this scene, a trace of admiration flashed across brother song’s and Zhang Yi Jiu’s faces.

“It’s the light from the icy glazed heart,”brother song said with some envy.

Zhang Yi Jiu also nodded and said, “What a beautiful color...”

“When the palace master has successfully swallowed the ice-cold glazed heart, he will definitely step into the martial Saint Realm!”Brother Song said with some excitement. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“At that time, our cold palace will definitely become the number one sect in the world!”

Zhang Yi Jiu said in a low voice, “Brother song, does that ice-cold glazed heart really have such an effect?”

Brother song replied indifferently, “It takes tens of thousands of years to produce a single icy glaze heart. It is the most powerful weapon in the world. Its effect is far beyond imagination.”

“The palace master once said that he relied on the icy glaze heart to advance from a grandmaster to a half-step martial saint. He also created a large number of experts!”

“As long as the icy glaze heart can be successfully devoured, becoming a martial saint is not a problem at all!”

Zhang Yi Jiu also said, “Palace master will definitely become the first person to become a martial saint!”

...

The next day.

Qin Yu landed at a nearby airport.

He restrained his internal Qi and looked no different from an ordinary person.

Then, Qin Yu took out his phone and called Zhang Yi Jiu.

“Where are you?”Qin Yu said.

“Turn around,”Zhang Yi Jiu said over the phone.

Qin Yu turned around and saw Zhang Yi Jiu.

Zhang Yi Jiu looked around and said in surprise, “You came alone?”

“Or what?”Qin Yu raised her eyebrows.

Zhang Yi Jiu was delighted. She quietly released her internal Qi and swept it over Qin Yu.

“No improvement at all?”Zhang Yi Jiu could not help but laugh after feeling Qin Yu’s strength.

Judging from the internal Qi, Qin Yu did not seem to have changed much from the last time. At most, she was at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm.

With such strength, she dared to go to the Cold Palace alone? Wasn’t she courting death?

“Hey, Qin Yu, I’ll take you to the Cold Palace. You have to erase the mark in my spiritual sense,”Zhang Yi Jiu said.

Qin Yu glanced at her and smiled. “Okay. After we go to the cold palace, I’ll return your freedom.”

“Then don’t waste time. Let’s go now,”Zhang Yi Jiu said impatiently.

Qin Yu glanced at her and didn’t say anything. She followed Zhang Yi Jiu into a car.

The car sped toward the north. As the car went deeper, the weather around them became worse.

It was snowing heavily, almost blocking one’s vision. The strong wind was like a knife, cutting one’s life.

After another few kilometers, the car stopped.

“If we keep going, the car won’t be able to enter,”Zhang Yi Jiu said.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask in a low voice, “Does your Han palace live in a place like this?”

“What else?”Zhang Yi Jiu rolled his eyes.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He followed behind Zhang Yi Jiu and walked toward the Han Palace on foot.

The strong wind mixed with the snowstorm made the two of them move very slowly.

“I heard that your cold palace has a treasure called the icy glaze heart. I’m not sure if it’s true or not.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly asked.

Zhang Yi Jiu’s body trembled slightly. She raised her eyebrows and asked, “Why? Are you here for the icy Glaze Heart?”

Qin Yu did not deliberately hide it. He nodded and said, “I guess so.”

“With your cultivation base, you dare to Covet the Icy Glaze Heart? Do you know that even a half-step martial saint would die if he came?”Zhang Yi Jiu could not help but mock.

Qin Yu did not pay attention to his words. Instead, he smiled faintly and said, “It seems to be true.”

When Zhang Yi Jiu saw this, he could not help but sneer and said, “A man’s heart is not enough for a snake to swallow an elephant. Don’t blame me for not warning you. Sooner or later, you will pay the price for your arrogance.”

Qin Yu did not say anything else. He followed behind Zhang Yi Jiu and continued to move forward.

Soon, a huge palace faintly appeared in his line of sight.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks. His pupils constricted as he looked at the castle.

“That’s the Han Palace?”Qin Yu asked in a low voice.

“That’s right.”Zhang Yi Jiu nodded.

“I’ve already brought you here. According to the agreement, you have to erase the mark in my spiritual sense.”Zhang Yi Jiu urged.

Qin Yu glanced at her and said, “What’s the rush? When I’m done with this matter, I’ll naturally return you your freedom.”

“You’re not keeping your word!”Zhang Yi Jiu was suddenly a little anxious!

If he was discovered by Qin Yu, wouldn’t he be dead for sure?

“Qin Yu, are you still a man? Quickly erase the Mark!”Zhang Yi Jiu grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said anxiously.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He grabbed Zhang Yi Jiu’s arm and said coldly, “You’d better not bother me, or I’ll kill you!”

Zhang Yi Jiu’s expression could not help but change slightly when he sensed the killing intent from Qin Yu’s body.

Although she was displeased, she did not dare to say anything.

Qin Yu released Zhang Yi Jiu and released his spiritual sense to cover the surrounding area.

Soon, Qin Yu discovered several streams of powerful internal Qi.

The most powerful one was in the depths of the Han palace.

“An existence that has surpassed the half-step martial saint...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

This internal Qi was very strange. It seemed to be between a half-step martial saint and a martial saint!

“Could it be that someone is about to become a martial saint?”Qin Yu suddenly had an ominous premonition.

That internal Qi had indeed surpassed a half-step martial saint!

Just as Qin Yu was deep in thought, four black shadows suddenly appeared in this vast white snow.

“Haha, You Came To My Han Palace alone. Should I praise your confidence or call you stupid?”A voice came from the front.

Qin Yu narrowed her eyes and said in a low voice, “Four half-step martial saints?”

“It’s none of my business. I told you not to come, but you didn’t listen. You Can’t blame me for this!”Zhang Yi Jiu hurriedly waved his hand and said.

Qin Yu ignored her and looked at the four half-step martial saints coldly.

“We were just about to look for you. I didn’t expect you to come to us.”Brother song took a step forward and said with a cold smile.

“TSK tsk, a mere peak-stage martial marquis dares to come to my Han Palace to court death?”

“Kid, hand over that mask. We can consider leaving your corpse intact.”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “I’ll give the same words to you. Hand over the ice glaze heart, and I can consider letting you go.”

“You’re courting death!”Brother song was instantly furious. He didn’t waste any more words and instantly arrived in front of Qin Yu. His fist was directly aimed at Qin Yu’s glabella!

Qin Yu did not panic and raised his hand to receive it.

But at this moment, Qin Yu’s vision suddenly turned black, and his strength instantly dissipated!

“Bang!”

Qin Yu’s figure was instantly sent flying, and he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood!

“Hahahaha!”Brother song could not help but laugh loudly when he saw the situation.

“With this little ability, you dare to come to my cold palace to cause trouble?”

Qin Yu wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and could not help but curse, “Damn, this dan injury actually acted up at this time...”
