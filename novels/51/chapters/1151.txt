Chapter 1152: Chapter 1,152, sacrificing oneself for others 

Zhai Xing’s face instantly turned red as he was strangled by Gu Xinghe.

He endured the pain and said in a trembling voice, “Xinghe... The holy region is about to open. Your Vision... shouldn’t be here...”

“What Bullsh * T Holy Region!”Gu Xinghe said furiously.

“I want to be the king of this world! Whoever dares to snatch it from me, I will tear them into pieces!”

“I don’t want to go to the holy region. I want to be the king of this world!”

Gu Xinghe’s face was ferocious. His furious roars shook the entire second secret realm, causing it to rumble.

Qin Yu stood up with difficulty. He looked at Gu Xinghe and said coldly, “Gu Xinghe, let them go. I will be at your disposal.”

Gu Xinghe looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “At my disposal? Do you still have the right to bargain with me? Are You Worthy? You are just a Maggot!”

Qin Yu didn’t refute and continued, “Your enemy is me. It has nothing to do with them. Moreover, even if you want to reorganize the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, you need manpower.”

Gu Xinghe raised his brows and sneered, “What you said makes sense, but... this reason can’t move me.”

His eyes swept over everyone and said, “Everyone I see will die.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Gu Xinghe, don’t go too far. If I want to leave, I’m afraid you won’t be able to stop me.”

“Oh? Then you can try,”Gu Xinghe said with a playful tone.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any words. He directly stepped on the ‘walking’character and shot out.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu disappeared without a trace.

Gu Xinghe was instantly stunned.

He couldn’t care less about the star harvester in his hand. He quickly looked around, as if he was looking for Qin Yu.

But where was Qin Yu? Even if he released his divine sense, he couldn’t find Qin Yu.

“F * ck!”Gu Xinghe was furious!

His anger filled the entire second mystic realm, and his eyes turned red.

Gu Xinghe never thought that Qin Yu would escape right under his nose!

“Swish!”

At this moment, Qin Yu turned back.

He stood not far away and said coldly, “Did you see that? If I wanted to leave, you couldn’t stop me at all.”

Gu Xinghe hurriedly stretched out his palm and sealed Qin Yu’s space.

However, this space was the second secret realm after all, so it was extremely fragile in front of Qin Yu.

He clenched his fist and punched the space into pieces!

This time, Gu Xinghe had no idea what to do.

Qin Yu was in control of the word movement. If he wanted to escape, he really couldn’t catch up.

“You choose between them and me,”Qin Yu said coldly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Qin Yu! Hurry up and leave. Even if he lets us go today, he will still catch us tomorrow!”Chang Mang shouted at this time.

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe immediately said, “Okay, sure. I’ll trade you for them.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “You have to swear on the Heavenly Dao that you won’t bring them back.”

Gu Xinghe immediately frowned.

Of course, he didn’t plan to let these people go, but if he didn’t let them go now, he wouldn’t be able to catch Qin Yu.

After thinking for a while, Gu Xinghe snorted. He swore to the Heavenly Dao according to Qin Yu’s request that he wouldn’t bring them back.

After doing all this, Gu Xinghe looked at Qin Yu and said, “Come here by yourself.”

Qin Yu did not waste any time and strode towards Gu Xinghe.

“Qin Yu!”Chang Mang and the others’faces changed drastically.

“Mr. Qin!”Yao Qing took out his black robe and planned to pretend to be a dao protector again.

However, Gu Xinghe was not a high-ranking official and did not know much about dao protectors. As such, he lost his deterrent force.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks. He turned to look at the crowd and said with a smile, “When we get out, you must take care of your safety.”

“Qin Yu, you...”Chang Mang’s expression was extremely unsightly, and his eyes became even more moist.

This man, who was like a piece of metal, was now covered in tears.

This was already the second time Qin Yu had saved his life. This favor was something that he would never be able to repay even if he lived his entire life.

Qin Yu walked up to Gu Xinghe and closed his eyes slightly.

Gu Xinghe did not say anything. He raised his hand and broke Qin Yu’s limbs. Then, he used the same method to seal Qin Yu’s divine sense.

In this way, Qin Yu would not be able to escape even if he used the line calligraphy.

“Leave quickly!”Qin Yu looked at the crowd and shouted.

Chang Mang gritted his teeth and said, “I’m not leaving! Gu Xinghe, I’m going to fight it out with you!”

“Chang Mang, now is not the time to be a hero. If there’s still a mountain, there’s still wood to burn.”Yao Meng and the others hurriedly stepped forward to block Chang Mang’s face.

The group retreated to the second secret realm.

Only when the last person left did Qin Yu let out a long sigh of relief.

“Qin Yu, I really admire your selfless spirit,”Gu Xinghe said indifferently with his hands behind his back.

“But... People like you are more likely to bring trouble to me!”

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and said, “What do you want? Just do it. No need to talk nonsense.”

“Hahahaha!”Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but laugh.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you for the time being.”Gu Xinghe held Qin Yu with one hand.

He touched the space between Qin Yu’s brows with his palm and planted a mark between Qin Yu’s brows.

This mark was different from an ordinary mark. It could control the power of a person’s divine sense to prevent any changes.

As long as the mark was there, it was almost impossible for Qin Yu to cultivate.

Then, Gu Xinghe brought Qin Yu and walked straight to the entrance to the first secret realm.

“It’s too easy for you to die just like that. I will let you experience real pain,”Gu Xinghe said with a cold smile.
