2353 Triggering the Restriction

“It seems that your two families have some scheme. We didn’t know about such a big operation today.”

Ni Wuxiao gulped a few times but told the whole story.

At this time, it was impossible to hide anymore. However, he did hide the information about the sword.

“I’m afraid that the Jee family’s ancestor’s sword is also there.”

Teng Zixu chuckled and seemed to know a lot of information.

“I don’t know about that.”

Yao Xi struggled to get up and pretended to be puzzled.

“Qin Yu, this little scoundrel, is actually so powerful that even you, Teng Zixu, can’t do anything to him.”

Ni Wuxiao’s expression was tremendously unsightly. At this point, both parties had already become irreconcilable enemies, and seeing Qin Yu’s strength made him feel somewhat intimidated.

“This person has already cultivated the initial stage of the Glazed Holy Body. If not because of saving people just now, I might have been able to kill him. I’ve missed this opportunity and might have to wait for the Golden Great Dao to descend before I can kill him.”

Teng Zixu said with a frown. He had already used the greatest power under the current Path of Heaven.

However, he could only injure Qin Yu, but he did not take it to heart.

This time, he only used the power of the Path of Heaven. If the suppression of the Path of Heaven had been removed in the future, it would not be difficult to kill Qin Yu at that time.

“I suggest that we kill Chang Mang directly. Qin Yu and our nine great aristocratic families have become irreconcilable enemies, and there is no longer room for negotiation between the two parties. That Chang Mang is also a holy body, and once he recovers, he will be a great enemy of our nine great aristocratic families.”

Killing intent flashed across Yao Xi’s face. This time, even with the two families’ full-strength arrangements, they actually could not do anything to Qin Yu.

He had already predicted that after this incident, he, as the Holy Son, would suffer from the pressure of the family.

“You can discuss this among yourselves.”

Teng Zixu’s body moved, and he disappeared on the spot.

“Alright.”

Si Qianjing nodded and took out a token that had numerous qi of the soul.

He let out a loud howl as the divine sense restriction exploded like a knife, cutting into Chang Mang’s soul.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. He did not expect Yao Xi to be so crazy and directly trigger the restriction.

The ghostly qi in his hand erupted, and the ghostly qi from the Soul Torment Mind Technique entered Chang Mang’s divine sense.

At this moment, Chang Mang’s soul was riddled with wounds.

Qin Yu’s ghostly qi entered it, trying to grab the skeleton-like restriction.

As if sensing danger, the skeleton suddenly burrowed into the depths of Chang Mang’s soul.

“You want to break the restriction? Do you think my Si family is so easy to manipulate? Even the Holy Lord can’t break this spiritual soul restriction.”

Si Qianjing sneered and said, full of confidence.

Qin Yu was sweating profusely at this moment. He had wanted to use the Sumeru ring’s ability to protect Chang Mang.

However, he did not expect the restriction to wreak havoc on Chang Mang’s soul as long as it did not receive the token’s internal qi. Moreover, the restriction skeleton was extremely cunning. It immediately entered the depths of the soul when it sensed danger.

Qin Yu was a little overly cautious about taking action. The veins on Chang Mang’s forehead bulged and contracted like thick hemp ropes.

He suppressed himself so hard to prevent himself from uttering cries of agony.

His soul was cut bit by bit. The restriction was set up in the cruelest way to make people die most painfully. Only then could it deter the criminals in prison.

Qin Yu’s eyes turned blood-red. He knew how terrifying this pain deep to the bones was.

“D*mn, it’s really satisfying. This d*mned Si family wants me to bow, but I’m not going to bow to that jerk.”

Chang Mang spat a mouthful of blood and laughed weakly.

“Brother, send me off.”

Chang Mang suddenly said in a deep voice.

“Coffin of Nine Lifetimes!”

Qin Yu’s eyes wide open in anger, and he subconsciously thought of the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes.

The masked woman was the most terrifying among all the soul-cultivating people he had seen. The coffin might have the suppressing effect on this restriction refined from the divine sense.

Qin Yu opened the coffin and kicked Chang Mang inside. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The coffin suddenly floated in the void. As if sensing an outsider had entered, it emanated a dense ghost qi.

He was extremely nervous as he continued to circulate it according to the method of the man with the mustache. He was anxious and unsure if this method would work.

After a long time, the coffin slowly calmed down.

Chang Mang’s face was drained of blood, and he fainted. The restriction had no movement.

It seemed that Chang Mang was temporarily safe. The coffin had completely suppressed Chang Mang’s divine sense, so the restriction on his divine sense certainly could not take effect.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. He had temporarily suppressed the restriction on the divine sense.

However, Chang Mang’s soul was also suppressed, and he was now like a living corpse.

If he did not find a solution as soon as possible, Chang Mang would be constantly attacked by the ghostly qi, and he would become a puppet without divine sense even after waking up.

“The current situation is considered very good now. It’s not easy to save his life. They have already received the information and made preparations. If you’ve not cultivated the initial Glazed Holy Body, I’m afraid even leaving is an extravagant hope.”

Ji Yue walked over and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

The two soon arrived at the Azure Ridge Continent.

As soon as they stepped into the Azure Firmament Sect, Elder Guai hurried over. “Qin Yu, there have been many internal qi of cultivators here lately. They seem to be probing for information. The information about us being here has likely been leaked.”

“It’s fine. It’s impossible to conceal such a huge movement.” Qin Yu shook his head.

Under the suppression of the power of the Path of Heaven, the strongest power only carried the power of half-step heavenly might. This power could not pose a threat to him now, so he was not very worried.

Feeling the death-like silence of the coffin, Qin Yu was inexplicably terrified.

He had to think of a way to resolve Chang Mang’s matter. If this dragged on, he really did not know what would happen to Chang Mang.

“Qin Yu, it’s not that simple. The nine great aristocratic families have been using their unique soul restrictions to control criminals for two Path of Heaven years now, and no one has ever escaped.”

Now that Qin Yu was uncertain, Ji Yue reminded him.

“You quickly heal your injuries now. Regardless of negotiations or other methods in the future, strength is the foundation.”

Qin Yu sighed softly. He really could not think of any other way now.

He indeed must quickly perfect the Glazed Holy Body.

Although he had plenty of chaotic qi, Teng Zixu had already tempered his body with the Path of Heaven. Qin Yu felt that he could trigger the power of the Path of Heaven using just a little spiritual energy. Every attack was the utmost of the power under the current Path of Heaven.

If it were a battle of life and death, he was no match for Teng Zixu.
