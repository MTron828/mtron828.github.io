Chapter 1218: Chapter 1,218, the powerful sea chicken 

The sea water was already churning, and the sea chicken’s movements brought up stormy waves as it pounded on the shore.

The sea chicken was getting closer and closer, bringing up waves that were already several meters high.

However, Professor Chicken didn’t panic at all, as if he was already used to it.

He placed his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “The sea chicken is here.”

At this time, Qin Yu was full of curiosity about the equipment.

He patted the metal lump and said, “Professor Chicken, how does this thing work? Can You Give Me One?”

If he could bring this thing to the holy region, he could probably use it to summon Demon Beasts, right?

Professor chicken said indifferently, “You don’t have our professional knowledge, so you can’t use this thing. Different demon beasts have different audio frequencies.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only sigh.

If he had known earlier, he would have studied hard.

“Hurry up and go back. It’s going to be dangerous here soon,”said Professor Chicken.

Qin Yiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll be careful.”

Professor Chicken said in a low voice, “That’s good too. I’ll let yoe our equipment.”

Originally, Qin Yu didn’t believe in these weapons, but after seeing Professor Chicken’s equipment to summon Demon Beasts, Qin Yu immediately wavered.

He wanted to see if these weapons could hurt the sea chicken.

“COO COO!”

At this moment, a chicken-like cry broke the silence of the island!

The sound was extremely mournful. It cut across the sky, and the shaking seawater kept rolling!

In the next second, the sea chicken b out from under the seawater!

This sea chicken was extremely huge. It was dozens of meters tall. Its fiery red radiance, coupled with its silver-like beak, outlined its beauty! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“So Huge!”

At this moment, even professor chicken was a little shocked!

Qin Yu was not surprised. Even a baby was so huge, let alone an adult sea chicken.

“Fire, Fire!”Professor Chicken hurriedly gave the order!

With that order, cannon fire filled the sky!

Countless cannonballs shot towards the huge sea chicken!

The bullet landed on the steel-like feathers of the sea chicken, producing a metallic sound that was extremely ear-piercing.

Then, the bullet exploded on the sea chicken’s body!

What was shocking was that the flame did not leave even a trace on the sea chicken’s body!

When he saw this scene, doctor chicken’s expression changed drastically!

“How is this possible!”Doctor Chicken’s pupils dilated and he was dumbstr

He stood there, stunned for a moment.

The cannon fire did not hurt the sea chicken, but it angered the sea chicken.

Its pupils emitted a cold gaze, which was extremely shocking and made people feel a chill on their backs.

While Professor Chicken was in a daze, the sea chicken had already flapped its wings!

This pair of wings was incomparably huge, and the hurricane that blew up swept the weapons on the shore into the sea!

“Be careful!”Seeing this, Qin Yu hurriedly pulled professor chicken to prevent him from being injured by the hurricane.

Doctor Chicken finally came back to his senses and hurriedly said, “Oh no, we have underestimated the power of this adult sea chicken. Quickly go back, quickly go back!”

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The sea chicken was already furious. The feathers on its body were like steel blades, cutting through the air and shooting towards them!

The sky was filled with flying feathers, and there was nowhere to hide!

Countless mercenaries on the shore were instantly pierced through, and the feathers pierced straight into the laboratory, easily breaking through the defense of the laboratory!

Doctor Chicken’s expression changed drastically!

At this moment, he realized that he had provoked the wrong person, no, he had provoked the wrong chicken!

“Quickly... quickly escape!”Doctor Chicken said with some panic.

Not only doctor chicken, the rest of the people in the laboratory were also panicking.

“Escape? It’s just a small island, where are you going to escape to?”Qin Yook his head.

Professor Chicken’s face was filled with despair, but he quickly calmed down.

He looked at the enormous sea chicken and said, “When I came to this island, I had already thought of this day. Come!”

After saying that, professor chicken opened his arms and actually intended to die!

The sea chicken seemed to understand professor chicken’s words. Its cold eyes looked at Professor Chicken. Then, it lowered its head, and the feathers on its back shot toward Professor Chicken!

The feathers on the sea chicken were small, but in fact, they were as thick as a telephone pole! It was extremely terrifying!

The strong wind brought by the feathers blew away the skin and flesh on doctor chicken’s face.

At this moment, Qin Yood in front of doctor chicken.

He stretched out his jade-like palm and slapped forward.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already slapped out dozens of palms, knocking away all the feathers that shot towards him!

“Clang Clang Clang”

The feathers shot out in all directions in an irregular manner, finally piercing into the island and shattering all the boulders.

“So Hard.”Qin Yu looked at his own palm.

At the moment of collision, the force was extremely great, but this feather was actually not shattered by Qin Ypalm strike, it was truly rare.

Doctor Chicken, who was already prepared to die, hurriedly opened his eyes.

He looked at Qin Yu, who was standing in front of him, and could not help but say excitedly, “Is... is it the strength that the enhancer gave you! That’s great, my enhancer is really effective!”

“...”Qin Yu opened his mouth, not knowing how to explain it to him.

“What does it have to do with your enhancer? Don’t yoow, Mr. Qin is the number one person in the world!”A soldier who followed him could not help but say.

Professor chicken frowned and asked, “What is the number one person in the world?”

“Your strengthening agent is indeed useful, but it has not reached that level yet.”Another person interrupted.

“Alright, now is not the time to talk about this.”Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

He looked at the huge sea chicken in front of him with great interest. His eyes revealed a strong desire to fight.

This sea chicken’s strength was not ordinary, and its body was extremely tough and fierce.

More importantly, Qin Yu could see his cultivation base.

This sea chicken had probably reached the peak of the martial saint realm. This was almost the strongest opponent Qin Yu had encountered so far.
