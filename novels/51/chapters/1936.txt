1937 Tricked

Upon hearing Qin Yu’s words, they were so angry that their faces turned livid, and killing intent burst out unconsciously.

Qin Yu’s divine sense was extremely sharp. He soon captured this killing intent.

His eyes glanced over casually, and he sneered.

“You’re pretty fast.” Qin Yu sneered in her heart.

Facing these few people, Qin Yu was not afraid at all. In front of so many people, Qin Yu did not believe they would dare to make a move.

Not only that, but Qin Yu also became even more excited.

“Si Shiyue! I, Qin Yu, will tell you today that Yan Ruoxue belongs to me, Qin Yu, and not you!

“As the Si family’s Holy son, I don’t believe you’re afraid of me. If you are, you can tell me!

“Everyone will be my witness. If anything happens to me, it must be because I have frightened the Si family. Hahaha!”

Qin Yu’s shouts spread in all directions through the loudspeaker.

Everyone’s faces turned ashen when they heard this. Someone even cursed straightaway, “You’re really shameless! A nobody is actually shouting at Si Shiyue!”

“That’s right. Do you think coming to pursue Yan Ruoxue works? Why would the Si family care about a clown like you!”

“This person is too shameless. Isn’t he just trying to blackmail us?”

Upon hearing their words, Qin Yu felt overjoyed secretly.

This was his objective. He wanted Si Shiyue to be caught in a difficult position and could only listen to his abuse.

“I know you’re an Advanced-stage Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster, but so what? Although I’m only at the Early-stage of the Reversion Vold today, it won’t be long before I surpass you!” Qin Yu shouted.

“At that time, you will definitely not be my match!”

The few people sent by the Si family couldn’t stand it any longer. Some clenched their fists and prepared to argue with Qin Yu.

However, he had just taken a step when he was pulled back by someone, saying, “You can’t do that. The Si family’s reputation is more important. If we start a fight here, we’ll disgrace the Si family and the Holy Son!”

“D*mn it! Are we just going to let him be?” the person beside him said angrily.

“There’s no hurry. I’m afraid we’ll have to wait for the Holy Son’s orders.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Their hearts were full of worry. These people from aristocratic families all valued their reputation much.

But Qin Yu didn’t care about that. He cursed without mercy.

“D*mn it! I can’t take it anymore. Even if I can’t fight, I’m going to reason with him!” Finally, a young cultivator couldn’t take it anymore.

With a shake of his feet, he arrived in front of Qin Yu.

“Kid, shut up!” the cultivator cursed.

“What’s the matter?” Qin Yu glanced at him and asked.

“What are you doing? You’re humiliating the Si family’s Holy Son in front of so many people. Are you courting death?” he said angrily.

“Which of your ears heard me humiliating the Si family’s Holy Son?” Qin Yu sneered and said. “I’m just issuing him a challenge, can’t I? Or is he afraid of me?”

“Afraid of you? Who do you think you are? The Si family’s Holy Son can take your life with just a wave of his hand!” The veins on the cultivator’s face were bulging. It was obvious that he had reached his tolerance limit.

“Who are you?” Qin Yu sneered and said. “A member of the Si family?”

“I… I’m not. I just want to help when I see injustice!” the cultivator said without much confidence.

“Really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and asked. “What about the killing intent on you? If you’re not a member of the Si family, why are you so agitated?”

“I… ” He opened his mouth but was speechless.

“In any case, you’d better shut up immediately, or else…”

“Or else what can you do?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said provocatively.

“Or else I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of the Holy Son of the Si family!” the young cultivator shouted.

Qin Yu squinted his eyes. He took a step forward, sneered, and said, “You can try and see if I’m afraid of you! But if you’re from the Si family, I hope you can disclose your identity.”

The cultivator seemed to have been angered by Qin Yu. He glared at him and said, “So what if I’m from the Si family!”

Hearing his words, Qin Yu was overjoyed!

This idiot finally fell for it!

Qin Yu grinned and said, “You’re from the Si family! It looks like I’m right. The Si family is afraid of me!”

“Bullsh*t! Why would our Si family be afraid of you?” he said furiously.

“In that case, why are you here?” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“I… Can’t I just pass by?” he said without much confidence.

“Oh, I see.” Qin Yu pretended to be enlightened. Then, he touched the back of his head and said with a smile, “Then why didn’t you dare to admit your identity as a member of the Si family just now? Instead, you pretended to be a passerby who saw injustice?”

“I… ” The cultivator was speechless and immediately flew into a rage.

With a wave of his hand, he raised his hand and ruthlessly slapped Qin Yu with a mark!

Qin Yu sneered. He clenched his fist and raised it, throwing a fierce punch at the incoming attack!

“Clang!”

The moment the mark and the punch collided, the mark was shattered by Qin Yu’s punch! The cultivator was even forced back a few steps and almost fell to the ground!

“Don’t think I don’t know you’re here to kill me. Unfortunately, here… I’m not afraid of you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

This place belonged to the Yan family. A formation had been set up around the place, and everyone’s spiritual power was suppressed!

Although this Si family’s cultivator was powerful, he was also suppressed by the formation and couldn’t use more than one-tenth of his strength. The mark he had condensed was naturally not worth mentioning!

...

However, Qin Yu was different. Even without spiritual power, his body was extremely powerful!

“You’re courting death!” The cultivator was not convinced and charged at Qin Yu again!

But this time, it was even more embarrassing. Qin Yu waved his big hand, which was as big as a cattail leaf fan, and slapped him hard on the face. The slap made him turn 360 degrees in the air, and he fell to the ground in the end!

When he got up, half of his cheekbone had been shattered by Qin Yu!

The surrounding people exclaimed in shock!

They had never expected Qin Yu to be so powerful that he almost killed the cultivator of the Si family with a mere slap!

“Zi Xu, come back!” A few people not far away immediately shouted.

The cultivator named Zi Xu gritted his teeth, pointed at Qin Yu, and said, “Just you wait. I won’t let you off!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You’re not my match when it comes to talking. You’re also not my match when it comes to fighting. Don’t embarrass yourself by saying such harsh words.”

In fact, Qin Yu could have killed him with a slap, but he knew that it would give the Si family an excuse to make a move if he really killed the people of the Si family.

“This kid seemed to have some ability.” The people in the surroundings discussed in low voices.

...

“That’s right. I initially thought that he was just an empty vessel. I didn’t expect him to have some ability… ”

“No wonder he dared to challenge the Holy Son of the Si family!”
