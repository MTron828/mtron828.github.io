Chapter 2523 Divine Might Chasing Star

“Who knows? The battle above the Saint might be even more intense. Even if it’s just a temporary alliance, I’m afraid the direction of interests is the same. If not for this, how could the human race’s attack on the Path of Heaven fail back then?”

Immortal Emperor Yao sneered and said.

After hearing what Immortal Emperor Yao had said, everyone fell silent.

They had thought that this war was about the survival of the human race, but Immortal Emperor Yao seemed to be implying something.

It seemed to be a battle for benefit distribution. In the eyes of the Saint, their life-and-death struggle might just be the fish bumping around in a fish tank.

“Hahaha, since I’ve recovered a part of my soul, I naturally must do something to stir things up. If you want to be someone outside the fish tank in the future, you must do your best to improve yourself to the extreme. At the very least, you must be able to comprehend that shackle. Perhaps in the future, you’ll have an opportunity to break the cage and break through to the Saint Realm.

“However, you can’t exert too much force. For example, people will notice you guys when you and Si Shiyue attack with all your strength. You may suffer a huge disaster once you go beyond that limit.”

Immortal Emperor Yao laughed heartily. After speaking, he opened the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes.

“Kid, get me a blanket.”

He glared at Chang Mang and shouted.

Chang Mang’s body trembled, but he dared not say anything facing the Immortal Emperor’s pressure.

He quickly carried a golden silk quilt over and even thoughtfully covered Immortal Emperor Yao with it.

“Human race really know how to enjoy themselves. I’ve never covered myself with such a comfortable blanket before.”

Immortal Emperor Yao crossed his legs under the blanket. He seemed to have recovered some of his soul power and was in a good mood.

He hummed a song as he closed the coffin lid.

He looked as if he was going camping, leaving everyone speechless.

“Oh yes, little fellow. Your holy body is called the Divine Might Chasing Star. It is a body that needs to break through in life-and-death battles continuously. The gap between you and others will only get increasingly bigger here.”

Before the coffin lid was finally closed, a sentence drifted out.

Chang Mang was startled, and his face revealed a confused expression.

It was indeed what Immortal Emperor Yao had said. After entering purgatory, he rarely experienced life-and-death battles. The gap between his current strength and others was also getting increasingly bigger.

“Divine Might Chasing Star Chaser? I’ve never heard of this holy body before?”

Lei Xin revealed a puzzled expression. Even though he was the dean of Thunder Courtyard and was familiar with all sorts of ancient books, he had never heard of such a holy body.

Ji Yue was also puzzled.

“Perhaps there is another possibility, and that is the holy body left behind by the Supreme of Divine Land. Immortal Emperor Yao would never lie to others. If there’s a holy body I don’t know about, it is most probably left behind by the Supreme of Divine Land.”

Ji Yue thought for a moment and felt that there was only one possibility.

“Our human race has its language to record eras. The current period is known as the Era of Annihilation, symbolizing the decline of our people in this age. The four years of the Path of Heaven before that was the supreme era of the human race. The Nine Great Immortal Emperors were people of this era. At that time, many cultivation methods, holy bodies, and bloodlines were all cut off, which led to the decline of the human race today.”

Flower Granny could tell that Qin Yu and the others were confused, so she explained this history.

“If it really is, Chang Mang, your holy body is something left behind from the ancient era. Therefore, you must be on the verge of death to awaken your bloodline. Immortal Emperor Yao should not be lying.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ji Yue stared at Chang Mang as if she wanted to hear his opinion.

“Then I must stimulate this bloodline. The recent battles suffocated me. I won’t be going with you guys this time. I’ll go straight to the depths of the Azure Rock Forest and have a good fight with the demon race.”

Seeing this burly man with a head full of coarse hair, everyone could not help but feel speechless.

“Although the higher-ups of the demon race have suffered heavy injuries, the four great divine beasts, many demon kings, and sacred beasts, who can you defeat? Isn’t it courting death going to the Azure Rock Forest, an important place for the demon race?”

Qin Yu said unhappily.

“If you’ve made up your mind, I have a good place to recommend. Perhaps I can even give you some opportunities.”

Ji Yue said with a smile.

“Where?”

Chang Mang’s eyes lit up.

“The Forbidden Land of the Dragon Demon is a place occupied by the powerful dragons and monster race. It’s full of various sinister creatures and mysterious treasures but also hidden cultivation resources and opportunities. Our ancestors once fought in that place and marked out some places with opportunities. However, that place has been gradually forgotten after the family suffered a massive change.”

Ji Yue continued with a solemn expression.

“But let me remind you, it seems to have the secret inheritance of the dragon race and the monster race. That’s why the two races have been fighting there for a long time. The demonic dragon race is even more ferocious. If you go there and laugh like you do here, I’m afraid you won’t live for more than a day.”

“Don’t worry! Sister Ji Yue! I know how serious this matter is. When I go there, I won’t provoke living beings that I can’t defeat, but I definitely must make the living beings of the two races pay a price. They have killed so many of our human race’s people, if I don’t take revenge, what’s the point of becoming stronger?”

Ji Yue’s eyes flashed with admiration, but Chang Mang still maintained his simplest innocence.

“It’s good that you know what you’re doing. If the higher-ups of the demon and the monster races aren’t injured in this battle, I don’t think I will let you go. Although it’s dangerous to go now, it’s also a good opportunity to improve. To the demon and monster race, if the difference in strength is too big, they won’t take the initiative to attack unless you provoke them.”

Ji Yue explained some details to Chang Mang before handing him A scroll of ancient parchment.

It was a map drawn by the ancestors of the Jee family in the Forbidden Land of the Dragon Demon.

Although it was a tremendously ancient map, it was very likely that some inheritances, secret realms, and ancient treasures had not appeared for a long time. Moreover, the ancestors of the Jee family had truly arrived at that forbidden area, so this information was tremendously valuable.

If it were auctioned, it would definitely fetch a sky-high price.

“Thank you, Sister Ji Yue!”

Chang Mang said gratefully. He respected Ji Yue very much.

It was not only because of her Jee family’s background but also because she had done her best to work for Human Race Watch selflessly.

She also did not give special treatment to the Jee family members when distributing the spiritual stones.

“Brat, work hard. When the next stage of the war begins, you must show me a different version of yourself. If you dare to die there, I will dig out your corpse and feed it to the dogs.”

Ji Yue said fiercely.

“Alright, as you wish!”

Chang Mang laughed heartily.

“Brat, wait a few more days before you set off. I’ll refine the spirit herbs of Human Race Watch with Pavilion Master these few days, and then you can set off.”

Qin Yu handed over all the 70 or so bottles of Sacred Spirit Pills to Chang Mang.
