Chapter 2608: Unable to Kill

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“If it’s solely this black dragon, we won’t be unable to deal with it. What we fear most is Seifer. This army leader can instantly kill us.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Regardless of the ogre or this necromancy black dragon, Ju Wuwei dared to fight.

However, facing that necromancer, he really could not muster up the desire to fight.

It was like an ant facing an elephant, an insurmountable gap that could not be bridged.

At this moment, on the other end, there was also a cleared open space.

The same scene appeared here, but the bubbles that finally appeared in this swamp burst open and revealed a necromancy knight.

However, the number of these necromancy knights was much higher than the necromancy black dragon.

Rows of necromancy knights lined up neatly. Compared to the disorganized ogres, they were more like a real army.

“Are you ready, Yunfei?”

About 300 meters away, two people were standing in that area.

This area was also the extension of the second passage. At this moment, it was nearly 3,000 meters away from where Qin Yu and the others were.

The two left the team to search on their own after entering.

If Shen Xiao and the others saw them, they would recognize them as Revered Qi’s two personal disciples.

He had taken them under his wing a long time ago. After obtaining the divine flame this time, he sent the two into this Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

“Jiang Mingyue, that’s enough. Join your soul and help me look at that location.”

Jiang Mingyue suddenly pointed at Yunfei’s forehead.

At this moment, a scene as if pulling over, appeared before Yunfei. Red flames appeared in his eyes.

The flames gradually filled his entire eyeballs. The ogres around 300 meters away suddenly realized that something was wrong.

They found the swamp behind them seemed to be really boiling. The tremendous increase in temperature made their bodies feel intensely uncomfortable.

Ogre only liked to be in damp and cold forests and was unduly uncomfortable with this heat.

The core exploded.

The red light in Xiao Yunfei’s eyes suddenly exploded.

A terrifying explosion suddenly erupted from the swamp in the distance.

The explosion engulfed all the ogres within ten meters of the surroundings and turned them into minced meat.

An excessively furious voice suddenly sounded from the depths of the forest.

That terrifying consciousness spread out again. The abrupt explosion had also attracted Seifer.

“That’s enough. Destroying this swamp should earn enough merit points.”

Jiang Mingyue let out a strange cry. He put one hand on Xiao Yunfei’s shoulder and the two teleported a hundred meters away. After that, they quickly rushed toward the second cave.

At this moment, the black dragon on Qin Yu’s side also let out a roar.

Almost at the instant of the explosion, it flapped its wings and quickly flew toward the explosion location.

The ogres on this side were restless at this moment. It was not just the ogres that the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze saw from within 30 meters.

“Something’s wrong. There’s a massive tremor on the ground. It seems that a large number of ogres are rushing toward our area.”

Ju Wuwei placed his palm on the ground, his expression extremely grim.

At this moment, in the world of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, Lu Yue’s candle had been completely extinguished.

“F*ck!

Qin Yu’s punch directly blew up Li Yue’s body. It was actually transformed from a twig.

“We’ve been fooled. Prepare for battle.”

Qin Yu’s expression was tremendously ugly.

Without Liu Yue’s necromancy candle, the power of the cloak alone could not stop Seifer’s probing.

At this moment, Lu Yue once again ventured deep into the necromancy camp.

He was holding the necromancy candle and wearing the cloak. No one would notice him as long as he did not let the ogres see him.

“Just as I’ve expected, this candle will help me obtain enough merit points.” Lu Yue said softly.

He stared at the chessboard in his hand and turned around to enter a forest path.

The mirror in his hand kept recording all the information along the way.

He did not care at all and continued to advance deeper.

At this moment, that terrifying consciousness descended once again, and the expressions of a few of them turned ashen.

Their internal qi instantly became very weak, as if they had suffered a severe mental attack. However, no one died, and Qin Yu was completely fine.

The ogres near the swamp had completely surrounded them. There were nearly 60 of them.

Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he slashed out horizontally with his saber. He instantly killed the five ogres before him and then Yu waved the saber in his hand.

The ogres that were close to them were almost immediately cut into two.

After killing Yin Lin, he increased the strength of his body again. At this moment, these ogres were no longer his match, and Qin Yu could easily kill them.

After killing 20 ogres in a row, he felt his right arm starting to go numb.

Fortunately, Ju Wuwei had already gritted his teeth and stood up after taking the Spirit Recovery Pill.

He helped block the ogres that were rushing over.

At this moment, these ogres were less than a few hundred meters away from them. With their speed, they could reach them in less than four to five seconds.

“Quickly fully recover!”

Qin Yu drew the bowstring from his back.

He shot out three arrows consecutively, killing three giant ogres directly.

Ju Wuwei also slit open the throat of a giant ogre that came before him. It was much easier than previously.

‘Qin Yu, if this kind of aura attracts Seifei, won’t we be doomed?”

Ju Wuwei’s expression was somewhat solemn.

“I’ve guessed it wrong. Seifer shouldn’t be able to kill us directly. The first time I used the eye of true vision to stare at him from 500 meters away, including the necromancy Seifer cast later, did you realize that it didn’t kill any outsiders at all? It only severely injured us. It’s also the order of this kingdom. However, the army it spawns can kill us.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, judged, and said. He was too preconceived.

Including the first time he used the eye of true vision and was severely injured by Seifer, all of these made Qin Yu think that Seifer could easily crush them.

“Including the fact that he took Yin Lin under his command previously, he had actually wanted to use Yin Lin to kill us. He can appear anywhere in the city, but he can’t directly eliminate us. Moreover, his attacks should be restricted in some way, such as the number of times he can attack or something else.

Therefore, he couldn’t attack me.”

Ju Wuwei nodded. They almost felt a terrifying mental devastation just now.

In that state, Seifer could have easily killed them if he had increased his strength a little, but he did not do so..
