Chapter 1149: Chapter 1,149, a villain gets what he wants 

This sudden uneasiness made Qin Yu frown.

It was as if a bad premonition filled his heart.

Qin Yu slowly stood up and looked at the sky.

Although he didn’t have the ability to predict the future like Tian Jizi, he was still extremely sensitive to uneasiness.

“Strange.”Qin Yu frowned.

He really couldn’t figure out where this uneasiness came from.

Apart from the eight higher-ups, there seemed to be no other enemies.

“Could it be that they plan to attack a second time?”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

It shouldn’t be. They wouldn’t be able to make a comeback so quickly after being intimidated by others.

Qin Yu stood there and pondered for a long time before finally sitting down.

There was a good saying that all uneasiness stemmed from a lack of strength.

As long as one had sufficient strength, there was nothing to worry about in this world.

...

In the second mystic realm.

Eight high-ranking officials were curled up on the array platform, looking extremely pitiful.

They no longer had that arrogant posture, only anger and regret on their faces.

Standing in front of them was the dog-like Gu Xinghe.

At this moment, his body was slowly recovering, and there was an evil smile on his face.

“Do you really think that I, Gu Xinghe, will willingly become your dog?”Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Yan yongfu shouted, “Gu Xinghe! How dare you! Your strength was bestowed by US!”

“So What?”Gu Xinghe sneered, “I can remember everything you did to me.”

“Gu Xinghe, have you forgotten who made your family rich?”Another high-ranking official said coldly.

“Of course I remember!”Gu Xinghe gritted his teeth and clenched his fists.

“My father is a top expert in the world. If he hadn’t been tricked by you into joining the martial arts association in Jingdu, he wouldn’t have ended up like this!”

“You used sweet words, threats, and enticement to control my father and treat him as your servant! Do you want me to owe you a favor?”

Yan Yongfu’s expression was somewhat unsightly. He had never expected that Gu Xinghe, who had been bowing and scraping just a moment ago, would turn into such a person in the blink of an eye!

However, he didn’t give up and continued to brainwash, “Gu Xinghe, in order to let you take revenge, we gave all of our strength to you. Now that you’ve done this, aren’t you repaying kindness with enmity?”

As soon as these words were said, a trace of malevolence flashed through Gu Xinghe’s eyes!

He waved his large hand and slapped Yan Yongfu’s face!

Although the strength of this slap was not great, it was extremely insulting!

They had controlled the martial arts association in Jingdu for many years and could be considered the strongest in this world. It had been a long time since someone dared to treat them like this!

“Do you really think I don’t Know?”Gu Xinghe said darkly.

“You killed my father! You saw that my father was no match for Qin Yu, so you took over his body and tried to self-destruct!”

“Qin Yu is involved, and so are you!”

Hearing this, Yan Yongfu’s face instantly turned pale!

“What do you want?”A higher-up asked coldly.

“Hahahahaha!”Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

He turned around abruptly and shouted, “Don’t worry, I Won’t let you die like this. I’ll treat you the way you treat me!”

Then, Gu Xinghe suddenly stretched out his palm. In an instant, golden chains shot out from his palm!

A total of eight chains headed straight for the glabella of the eight higher-ups!

The chains sank into the glabella of the eight higher-ups, dragging them together!

Then, Gu Xinghe suddenly pulled with his hand. Streams of divine sense were actually forcefully pulled out by Gu Xinghe!

“Gu Xinghe, what exactly do you want!”Yan Yongfu said somewhat anxiously.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Since I said I won’t kill you, I won’t kill you.”

He used these eight chains to bind the eight higher-ups together. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t escape.

After doing all this, Gu Xinghe turned around and walked out of the door.

“When I kill Qin Yu, I’ll tell you,”Gu Xinghe said with a grin.

“Oh, right, I still have to thank you for the power you gave me. In order to repay you, I will let you live for a few more days.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After saying this, Gu Xinghe turned around and walked out.

At this moment, Gu Xinghe’s strength had already reached an unbelievable level.

This power even surpassed any of the eight high-ranking officials!

Gu Xinghe, who seemed to be wagging his tail and begging for mercy, was actually very ambitious. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have used so many despicable methods to control the JINGDU martial arts association.

“The martial arts association of Jingdu, I’ll take it back the way I lost it!”Gu Xinghe muttered coldly.

Then, he strode toward the tunnel.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was still comprehending the fighting character formula.

Jiang he used 32 days to comprehend the fifth level, while Qin Yu spent three whole days from the fourth level to the fifth level.

During these three days, Qin Yu didn’t eat or drink. He used all his energy to comprehend the fighting character formula.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a blazing light suddenly flashed in the sky!

This light enveloped the earth and covered the entire second mystic realm!

“Second mystic realm, i, Gu Xinghe, AM BACK!”

A loud shout resounded in the sky of the second mystic realm!

Many people were startled awake by this voice. They hurriedly went out and looked at the sky.

Qin Yu also heard this loud shout.

“Gu Xinghe?”Qin Yu frowned slightly and hurriedly ran out of the main hall.

He saw a young man dressed in white standing in the air. He had his hands behind his back as he looked down at everyone.
