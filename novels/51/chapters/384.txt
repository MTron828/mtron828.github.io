Chapter 385: Forcefully Climbing the Stairway to Heaven! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Elder Qin, don’t force yourself. Come down!” Everyone was shouting!

However, Qin Yu was extremely stubborn. He raised his head and looked at the big hand above him. Gritting his teeth, he said, “I will definitely climb up, definitely!”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s calf had already been broken, and the finger on his left hand had been shattered!

Under such circumstances, climbing up was equivalent to climbing up to the sky!

“Even his leg is broken, so how is he going to climb up?” Qiao Wu sneered.

On the stairway to heaven, Qin Yu lifted his leg with great difficulty and climbed up to the seventh level.

When he stepped onto the seventh level, Qin Yu’s left leg was completely broken.

On the eighth level, his right leg was shattered!

Just when everyone thought that Qin Yu was going to give up, he used his own hands to grab the stairs and climbed up!

“Why do you have to try so hard...” the Fifth Elder murmured.

Taozi even shed a few tears. She covered her face and couldn’t bear to watch any longer.

Level 9, level 10, level 11...

Qin Yu reached level 11 with his legs shattered!

Lying on the 11th level, Qin Yu was exhausted, and his body was severely injured.

Whether it was his skin or his internal organs, they all suffered a great impact.

Qin Yu laid on the eleventh level, and the world in front of him kept spinning, as if it wanted to throw Qin Yu off.

“You can’t do it. Go down.” An unfamiliar voice sounded in Qin Yu’s head!

This voice was extremely bewitching, and it affected one’s divine sense, making one involuntarily want to listen to it!

Even Qin Yu was bewitched for a moment.

His body swayed, and he had an impulse to jump down.

“Qin Yu, you can’t give up. I believe you can do it.” At this moment, another voice popped out in his mind and pulled Qin Yu back in time!

Qin Yu’s dazed eyes suddenly shone with a resolute look!

He roared angrily, “F * ck you! It’s not up to you to decide whether I can do it or not!”

In an instant, Qin Yu seemed to have gone mad. Using his bloody fingers, he grabbed the stairs and climbed up to the twelfth level with great difficulty!

Finally, Qin Yu successfully stepped onto the twelfth level!

And at this moment, Qin Yu already looked extremely ghastly.

At a glance, he was like a pile of rotten meat squirming on the stairway to heaven!

“He actually climbed to the twelfth level.” The Pavilion Master looked at this scene with surprise on her face.

Because she knew that if one wasn’t recognized, every level one climbed would be extremely painful!

Even Jiang He, who was known for being extremely tolerant of pain, only climbed to the 13th level!

“Hmph, I don’t believe that he can climb to the 13th level.” Qiao Wu couldn’t help but curse.

Although he said so, he wasn’t sure.

Because Qin Yu was like a madman!

Even if his body was shattered, he still didn’t have the slightest intention of giving up!

With such perseverance, if he didn’t die, he would definitely become a formidable enemy in the future!

On the stage, Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the thirteenth level of the stairway that kept spinning in front of him.

“There’s still eight levels left... I must endure it...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and climbed to the thirteenth level!

The thirteenth level was the highest record so far!

Everyone, afraid that they would miss out on a single detail, looked at Qin Yu nervously.

Finally, Qin Yu grabbed hold of the stairway to the thirteenth level and climbed up.

However, just as Qin Yu was about to step onto the thirteenth level, his mind felt as if it had been struck by tens of thousands of heavenly tribulation bolts. His entire divine sense felt as if it was about to be torn apart!

“Plop!”

Under this intense pain, Qin Yu’s body swayed and he fell straight down! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Qin Yu!” Below, everyone shouted in unison!

“Hahaha! He fell down.” Qiao Qu shouted even more excitedly!

But in the next second, something shocking happened!

Qin Yu grabbed the stairway to heaven with one hand! His body swayed in mid-air, but he didn’t fall down!

His fingers were already broken, and he was practically grabbing the stairway to heaven with his ghastly white bones!

The pain was unimaginable!

Even the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion turned pale!

“Ah!!!”

In the air, Qin Yu roared again and again!

He grabbed the stairway to heaven tightly, and with one hand, he successfully returned to the top of the stairway to heaven!

“Qin Yu...”

Countless people wept bitterly at this moment!

Perhaps it was because they were moved, or perhaps it was because they were excited, everyone’s eyes were filled with tears.

“I will never give up!” Qin Yu roared angrily! The divine sense in his mind burst out with an intense golden light!

At this moment, the golden light in Qin Yu’s mind that was as small as a grain of rice actually expanded to the size of a peanut!

“Huh?” A surprised look flashed in the Pavilion Master’s eyes.

Qin Yu... actually improved his divine sense under such difficult circumstances?

“How... unbelievable,” the Pavilion Master praised sincerely.

On the stairway to heaven, a bloody man was climbing with great difficulty.

Level 14, level 15!

There were only three levels left from that big hand!

“How is this possible?!” Qiao Wu’s expression was extremely ugly!

How could anyone in this world forcefully climb to level 15?!

“Rumble...”

When they reached the 15th level, the sky suddenly darkened.

Bolts of lightning that were like swimming dragons were brewing in the black clouds.

“The heavenly tribulation is about to arrive, and nothing will survive,” the Pavilion Master muttered when she saw this.

This heavenly tribulation was different from ordinary heavenly tribulation. It would shatter a person’s body and bones!

Anyone who touched it would be destroyed in terms of both body and soul!

“I don’t believe that you can survive the remaining three levels!” Qiao Wu seemed to have gone mad as he roared crazily!

“Rumble!”

The heavenly tribulation streaked across the clouds and illuminated the dark sky!

“Come, I’m not afraid of you!” Qin Yu raised his head to look at the sky and roared crazily!

The heavenly tribulation seemed to have heard Qin Yu’s words as it ruthlessly struck down!

“Ka-cha!”

This bolt of lightning struck Qin Yu’s body!

At the moment of contact, Qin Yu’s body was turned into charcoal!

Even the Purple Gold Gauze Cloth on Qin Yu’s body was turned into nothingness!

“Ah!!!” Qin Yu roared crazily. He endured this bolt of lightning and charged towards the sixteenth level!

His actions seemed to have angered the heavens!

Bolts of heavenly tribulation descended from the sky one after another, and in an instant, the surroundings turned into a sea of lightning!

These bolts of lightning formed a wall of lightning in front of Qin Yu and blocked his path!

“F * ck you, don’t even think about stopping me!” Qin Yu roared angrily and raised his fist to punch!

“Crack!”

His punch was drowned out by the sea of lightning and turned into black char. In that instant, he even lost consciousness!

Countless bolts of lightning covered Qin Yu’s body.

They passed through Qin Yu’s pores and entered Qin Yu’s body with sizzling sounds!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s brain was submerged by the sea of lightning!

His divine sense was completely enveloped by the sea of lightning!

Qin Yu’s vision turned black, and the blood on his body was almost completely burned dry.

“I... will never give up...” Qin Yu said with difficulty.

He relied on his strong and firm will to climb to the seventeenth level!
