2266 Ghost Qi Explodes

“Don’t bark. It’ll be your turn soon.” Qin Yu walked forward step by step.

At this moment, dense energy of dead bodies was emitting from Mu Yu’s and Mu Fan’s bodies. The stench of the energy of dead bodies filled the air with a layer of mist.

Their bodies began rotting, and their eyeballs suddenly exploded. Countless maggots crawled out frantically of their ears, nostrils, and eyeballs.

That scene made Qin Yu’s hair stand on end.

Within a short while, densely packed maggots were crawling on the ground.

The next moment, these maggots swept toward Mu Tian who was sitting cross-legged on the ground. They frantically drilled into his body through his mouth and nostrils.

A dense and palpable energy of dead bodies slowly rolled on his body. His body squirmed, and on both sides of his face, his visage split open, slowly giving rise to two corpse-like faces whose appearance resembled Mu Yu and Mu Fan.

“What a terrifying energy of dead bodies fluctuation! What has just happened?”

Xing Mou said in surprise.

“The Three Corpse Curse!”

Wu Feng said with a frown, “This is a tremendously cruel technique of the Mysterious Dark Sect. It uses one person as the soul and the other two as nourishment for cultivation. When it reaches a certain level of strength, the main soul can devour the spiritual energy of the two. This is the first time I’ve seen this technique.”

“Ah!”

Mu Tian let out a shrill cry. Two legs and two hands grew out of his body.

He knelt on the ground in a strange posture. In the next moment, his body leaped out with the surging energy of dead bodies.

The speed was four to five times faster than previously, and the massive force blasted on Qin Yu’s Suo Lin’s shield.

It directly smashed Suo Lin’s shield into countless spiritual power light spots.

“Hehe!”

Mu Tian let out a creepy strange laugh. His body was crawling around in space like a spider. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

As if his body could catch the energy of dead bodies, the energy of dead bodies in space was his domain. Moreover, the crawling speed was tremendously fast. Qin Yu could barely catch a shadow of it with his divine sense.

“Boom!”

In the next moment, Mu Tian’s speed exploded again, and both his feet landed on Qin Yu’s body again.

Looking at the creepy figure, Shui Yuan gasped.

Mu Tian suddenly leaped tens of thousands of feet into the sky and came crashing down like a mountain.

A massive force slammed into Qin Yu’s body, and his fists and feet fell like raindrops.

Every strike carried tremendous force and was an attack of a True Saint burning his blood essence. The terrifying force directly hit Qin Yu into the ground.

“Are you done?”

A cold voice came from underground.

In Mu Tian’s eyes, he saw a tremendously hot red wave sweeping out of the underground.

Nine fire dragons lifted Qin Yu, and the dragons spiraled out and smashed into Mu Tian from all directions. In an instant, the entire Mysterious Dark Sect turned into a sea of fire.

“Ah!”

Mu Tian let out a shrill cry as he raised his four hands.

The energy of dead bodies surged like a tide, resisting the sea of fire.

“The Fist of Annihilation!”

The fist burning with black fire landed and pierced Mu Tian’s head.

The energy of dead bodies that filled the sky suddenly disappeared, and Mu Tian turned into a charred corpse crashing onto the ground.

The surroundings were deathly silent. The three great elders of the Blood Sect were killed by Qin Yu so easily.

Some blood seeped out from Qin Yu’s skin. The fusion of the three of them also caused some injuries to him. He was slightly short of breath.

“As expected, the fire spiritual power in other continents is not as dense as in the Fire Unicorn Continent. Using Suo Lin Divine Artifact requires a lot of spiritual power.”

Although the top-notch Suo Lin Divine Artifact could draw the power of heaven and earth, the amount of spiritual power used was tremendously terrifying. The combined attack of the nine dragons just now had already consumed about a quarter of his spiritual energy.

“Whoosh!”

With a sharp whistling sound, a streak of red light suddenly shot toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s fist blasted out and landed directly on the red light.

“It’s so hard!”

That thing accelerated again and drilled into the void.

“Whoosh!”

Almost simultaneously, that thing shot out from behind Qin Yu at a terrifying speed and directly entered his sea of consciousness.

“What is this?”

Qin Yu was shocked. A nine-eyed parasite was firmly embedded on top of it.

Its body had countless tentacles, and at this moment, those tentacles were deeply embedded into Qin Yu’s divine sense.

Its mouth was full of countless barbs. At this moment, it was frantically biting Qin Yu’s divine sense.

“Haha, try my Blood Sect’s God-slaying Parasite. It’s an ancient parasite that specifically feeds on divine sense! Savor the agony of devouring the soul!”

Zong Yue laughed heartily.

“As expected of the Blood Sect. You have quite some methods!”

Qin Yu frowned, and the power of divine sense suddenly rolled up, constantly bombarding the God-slaying Parasite that had entered his divine sense. However, it seemed unaffected by the power of divine sense and became stronger instead.

“Don’t worry. It won’t come out before your soul is completely devoured.”

Zong Yue laughed sinisterly.

“D*mn it! You’re courting death. I’ll take you down, and I won’t be afraid of not finding a way to break it.”

Qin Yu was furious.

He stretched out his hand, which instantly transformed into a massive rope and wrapped around Zong Yue.

The terrifying aura stunned him. At this moment, he realized the three guardian elders beside him had all died.

“Save me! If I die, none of you can escape!”

Zong Yue let out a mournful cry.

Qin Yu grabbed Zong Yue and slapped him several times on the face, making him spit blood and shatter his teeth.

Behind Qin Yu, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted.

A domain power suddenly enveloped Qin Yu. At this moment, Xing Mou’s bow had been pulled to the limit.

Six pitch-black arrows flickering with terrifying qi fluctuations were on the bow.

This time, he no longer held back.

Although Xing Mou was only a seventh-grade True Saint, Qin Yu could sense danger from the arrow.

“You are powerful, but you are too arrogant. It’s your destiny that you can’t go far.”

Xing Mou said coldly.

“Don’t worry about it. Think about whether you can leave this place alive today.”

Qin Yu said with a cold smile. This Edgeless Team had tricked him more than once. Today, it so happened that they could settle all the scores together.

All of a sudden, Qin Yu’s divine sense sensed an extremely strange internal qi. That internal qi was in a familiar place.

“The seventh level of the purgatory.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. Could it be that the seventh level of the Mystic Realm was about to open?

This Mystic Realm involved many secrets. The man with the mustache had previously said it was a land of karma and warned him not to get involved in this Mystic Realm.

A terrifying ghostly qi suddenly erupted. Even cultivators whose divine sense was not strong could feel this terrifying ghostly qi fluctuation.
