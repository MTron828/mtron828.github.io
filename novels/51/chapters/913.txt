Chapter 914: Chapter 914, Wan family’s secret realm 

“Rumble...”

A huge hand with an aura that could flatten everything swept towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu, who had just experienced the torture of a dao injury, was unexpectedly unable to endure it.

Under this enormous force, his legs began to tremble, and his entire body trembled!

“Ah! !”

Qin Yu roared repeatedly, and the power of his fist erupted to the extreme, attempting to forcefully resist this palm strike!

But the moment all of his fist force came into contact with this large hand, it vanished into thin air! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Rumble!”

Accompanied by a monstrous explosion, that large hand ruthlessly slammed down!

The entire ground instantly stirred up a hundred thousand feet of dust, momentarily obscuring everyone’s line of sight!

Uncle Zhen was extremely confident, but Wan Guqiong was a little worried.

Because there were too many uncertainties on Qin Yu’s body! He escaped time and time again, causing people to start worrying.

The dust gradually dispersed, and Wan Guqiong’s eyes were fixed in that direction.

Qin Yu’s body was covered in blood, and the Golden Light had been shattered.

He fell to the ground like a dead dog.

Seeing this scene, Wan guqiong finally let out a sigh of relief.

He sneered, “Qin Yu, you also have this day!”

Then, Uncle Zhen walked forward and picked up Qin Yu.

“Are you still alive?”Wan guqiong asked.

Uncle Zhen nodded slightly and said, “I can feel the weak breath in his body.”

“Okay.”Wan guqiong couldn’t help but sneer.

“Bring him back to the Wan family’s secret realm immediately. I must find Yan Ruoxue’s whereabouts no matter what!”

Uncle Zhen glanced at Old Mister Yan in the room and said, “What about that old man? Should we get rid of him?”

Wan Gu Qiong was silent for a moment, then shook his head and said, “Forget it. He’s just an old man in his twilight years. There’s no need to create trouble.”

Uncle Zhen didn’t say anything more. He carried Qin Yu and the few of them turned around and left.

Along the way, Qin Yu was in a coma.

But even so, Wan guqiong was still extremely careful.

His eyes looked at Qin Yu from time to time, afraid that Qin Yu would suddenly wake up.

The three of them rushed toward the Wan family’s secret realm. Along the way, they were extremely fast, afraid that others would know that Qin Yu had fallen into their hands.

A few hours later.

The three of them arrived at the northwest border.

In a small city called West Martial City in the northwest, a car slowly drove past and finally stopped at the peak of a mountain range.

Wan Gu Qiong brought Qin Yu down from the mountain.

He lowered his head and glanced at Qin Yu, who was held in Uncle Zhen’s hand. He snorted coldly and said, “When we go to the Wan family’s secret realm, I have plenty of ways to deal with you.”

After saying that, Wan Gu Qiong walked toward the wan family’s internal Qi realm.

He placed his palm on the void in front of him and used the secret key to open the Wan family’s internal Qi realm.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who was like a dead dog, quietly opened his eyes.

He restrained his internal Qi and looked around, as if he was determining the location.

Buzz

A Ray of light lit up and the entrance of the Wan family’s internal Qi realm appeared in front of them.

“That’s enough.”Wan Gu Qiong said.

Uncle Zhen grunted in gratitude. He was about to enter the Wan family’s internal Qi realm with Qin Yu, but at this moment, Qin Yu, who was on the verge of death, suddenly broke free from Uncle Zhen’s restraint!

“Eh?”Uncle Zhen’s expression changed slightly, and he immediately took large strides forward, wanting to capture Qin Yu!

“Walking formula!”

However, Qin Yu had already been brewing for a long time, so how could he give him a chance!

With the use of the walking formula, Qin Yu’s speed instantly reached its peak!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already fled several kilometers away!

This instantly made everyone present widen their eyes!

“What’s Going On!”Wan Gu Qiong roared angrily.

Uncle Zhen frowned and said, “I’m afraid we’ve been deceived by this kid!”

“Then what the F * ck are you still standing there for? Hurry up and chase after him!”Wan Gu Qiong shouted angrily.

Uncle Zhen did not dare to say anything. The two martial saints quickly chased after Qin Yu.

Wan Gu Qiong gritted his teeth and stood there. The anger on his face made his originally vicious face even more twisted.

“F * ck... The Thing I was most worried about has happened.”Wan Gu Qiong could not help but mutter in a low voice.

“This sinister and crafty bastard...”

Wan Gu Qiong just stood there and waited quietly.

After about half an hour, uncle Zhen returned.

“Where is he?”Wan Gu Qiong asked coldly.

Uncle Zhen shook his head and said, “We didn’t catch up. This kid should have learned the nine secrets. His speed is far above ours.”

Wan Gu Qiong took a deep breath and said coldly, “Not only did we fail to catch him, but we also exposed the location of the Wan family’s secret realm... This treacherous bastard!”

“Young Master Wan, what should we do now?”Uncle Zhen asked.

Wan Gu Qiong shook his head and said, “We have already alerted him. If we want to catch him again, I’m afraid it won’t be that easy. We can slowly think of a way.”

Uncle Zhen hummed and said, “Our eyes now should be more focused on the large spirit stone mine.”

Wan Gu Qiong also nodded slightly.

The large spirit stone mine attracted almost all the aristocratic families, and the Wan family was no exception.

...

On the other side.

Qin Yu relied on the internal Qi formula to escape all the way.

Only when his aura was almost exhausted did Qin Yu fall down from the sky.

His internal Qi was completely exhausted, and his entire body crashed into a mountain forest.

Qin Yu collapsed on the ground and couldn’t help but gasp for breath.

“Pu!”

At the same time, Qin Yu felt a sweet taste in his throat, and a mouthful of blood spurted out.

“That was close...”Qin Yu muttered softly.

Uncle Zhen’s palm had indeed caused Qin Yu a great deal of damage. Although it was not fatal, it would not be so easy to recover in a short period of time.

“Fortunately, there’s the line character formula. Otherwise... the consequences would be unimaginable,”Qin Yu said softly.

He could not help but clench his teeth, and his hatred for the Wan Gu Qiong increased by another level.

Qin Yu fell to the ground and tried to get up, but he found that he had lost all his strength.

He swept his gaze around and looked at this unfamiliar environment. His vision began to darken.

In a short moment, Qin Yu fell into a coma.

...

Near the Spirit Stone Mine.

The various aristocratic families rushed here one after another.

Zhuang Teng, Chu Heng, and even Kong Yun also arrived.

Many half-step martial saints of the older generation were also waiting here.

Strands of dense qi/spiritual energy spread out from the large mine.

Although the large mine had yet to open, the internal QI within it was still mesmerizing.

“I’m afraid we won’t have the opportunity to enter the spiritual stone mine this time,”Yao Meng said in a low voice.

Zhuang Teng, who was standing at the side, said weakly, “The people from the various secret realms are all hiding in the dark. The three martial saints from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association have also arrived here early... cough cough...”

As he spoke, Zhuang Teng coughed out a mouthful of blood.

“How are you? Are You Alright?”When everyone saw this, they could not help but look worried.

Zhuang Teng waved his hand and said, “I’m fine... look at the top of the mountain...”

When they heard this, they immediately looked towards the top of the mountain.

They saw seven people standing on the top of the mountain.

These seven people were the seven martial saints!

When they gathered together, they were like the leaders of this world.
