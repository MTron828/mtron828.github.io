2274 The Emergence of the Coffin

“If this is the masked woman’s peak state, just a few of us naturally wouldn’t be able to deal with it. However, she should be in a weakened state now. Otherwise, she wouldn’t need to absorb such massive energy.”

“Encountering a monstrous being who has comprehended nine dao techniques across nine lifetimes – to be honest, merely getting a chance to meet her in person would fulfill my lifelong wish! Even if I were to die in this battle, it would still be worth it.”

Chang Ye’s aged face showed no signs of nervousness. Instead, it was full of anticipation.

As for Xi Menn, he sat cross-legged as if he was comprehending the power of the dao technique here.

It was dead silent, at this moment, like the calm before the storm.

And it was only now that everyone had the energy to scan the surroundings.

There were many treasures scattered on the ground, which seemed to be left behind by the dead cultivators.

But strangely, there was not even a single bone as if the bones had decomposed over the years.

Qin Yu suddenly unleashed the desolate divine eye. The remaining treasures emitted impressive lights of the way.

There were some colors that he had never seen before. They seemed to be the treasures left behind by several Path of Heaven previously.

“This is a jade slip of the Path of Heaven. It seems to be the way that the experts in the past few centuries cultivated.”

Gu Ming slowly approached a spot and found a jade slip in a corner with an indentation.

His face immediately lit up with excitement, turning bright red. Those who could come here must be supremely powerful individuals, and the cultivation method left behind in this jade slip must have been extraordinary.

“This long saber is just right for me.”

Wu Feng picked up a massive black saber engraved with runes of another Path of Heaven. Even if it was not of the Path of Heaven of that time, it still emitted terrifying energy fluctuations.

Upon seeing these, the others also looked for treasures in the surroundings. The more strength they had, the higher the chances of their survival.

However, Qin Yu had an intensely unsettling feeling at this moment.

If these treasures were left behind by the cultivators previously, these cultivators still died even though they were not inferior to them at all. What kind of terrifying existence would they face next?

“Boom!”

With a tremendous tremor, terrifying energy suddenly surged into the coffin.

The massive energy contained the power of spiritual energy, demonic qi, murderous qi, and other energies, and it almost solidified the air here. Qin Yu felt it was even difficult for him to move his hand.

The golden coffin suddenly opened with a bang, and a masked figure bathed in golden light slowly stood up.

Qin Yu’s heart raced. He had thought of Xiao Yu being here but again felt it impossible.

Logically speaking, this Mystic Realm was at least seven or eight Path of Heaven ago. This could be judged by the aura left behind by the treasures.

But why did Xiao Yu appear here? Wasn’t she the masked woman’s ninth reincarnation?

Qin Yu suddenly thought of a possibility. There were eleven people on the mural.

It meant the masked woman was extremely skilled in deducing the Path of Heaven. Therefore, it was not surprising this Dao Tomb was set up in advance.

But why did Xiao Yu show up here at this moment?

Qin Yu’s divine thought was as swift as lightning, yet he failed to grasp the underlying reasons behind it.

“The person of nine lifetimes, your body is stained with blood and sin. Today, I will definitely exterminate you here!”

The evil extermination said with a frown.

The masked woman slowly floated up into the air, her gaze indifferent as she stared at the crowd. Her figure appeared godlike, disdainfully overlooking the world, looking down upon the eleven individuals like ants.

The terrifying aura suppressed everyone present. If they were slightly weaker, they would probably kneel directly.

“What a terrifying power. It’s almost the aura of a peak True Saint!”

Qin Yu was shocked. It had only been such a short time, but Xiao Yu had already reached the limit of what this Path of Heaven could achieve.

Furthermore, Qin Yu had a feeling that if the masked woman was willing, she could probably break through True Saint and reach the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

The masked woman raised one hand and suddenly clawed at the air.

“Crash!”

Qin Yu felt something pierce through him. His neck seemed gripped by an irresistible force, and even the circulation of his divine sense became difficult.

He circulated the spiritual energy with difficulty to activate the desolate divine eye. At this moment, in the black-and-white world of the desolate divine eye, a massive chain of order pierced through his body and connected to his divine sense.

He felt that under the chain, everything he did and comprehended was clearly seen through.

He glanced at the others. Their bodies had also been pierced by the chain of order.

“The masked woman wants to comprehend the Path of Heaven of this life through them.”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization. Several people here were almost at the peak of this Path of Heaven, especially the evil exterminator, Situ Haoyue, and Chang Ye. Once she comprehended the way of this life through them, the masked woman would have perfected the ways of her nine lifetimes, and no one would be her match when she combined the nine into one.

A massive green talisman appeared from the void and wrapped around the masked woman.

Chang Ye suddenly attacked. This talisman represented the strongest attack of the way he had comprehended.

At the same time, Situ Haoyue also suddenly attacked. A surge of the Path of Heaven’s power of order broke through the palace and suppressed the masked woman.

This had surpassed the battle of ordinary cultivators. It was completely a direct comprehension and confrontation of the way.

“Boom!”

The masked woman grabbed the chain with one hand and struck out with her other hand.

Instantly, she destroyed the green talisman and the power of the Path of Heaven on her body with her palm.

Situ Haoyue and Chang Ye spat blood and almost fell onto the ground.

“What a terrifying power of rules.”

The two exchanged a glance, sharing a wry smile.

While their cultivation might be considered top-notch in this galaxy, they could not withstand even a single move from the masked woman.

A terrifying suction force came from the iron chain. Qin Yu felt all the chaotic qi in his body and various memories rapidly flowing away through the iron chain.

He gritted his teeth and endured the feeling of dizziness.

The masked woman in the air closed her eyes as if she was comprehending the power of the Path of Heaven in this life.

A world-destroying fluctuation slowly emitted from her body.

Xi Menn, who was on the ground, suddenly stood up. He gently placed the sword horizontally in front of his mouth.

A loud and clear sword chant suddenly sounded, and the sword energy carried an endless sea of murderous intent.

The utmost sword energy caused the iron chains binding him to tremble.

A sword light as bright as the sun and moon slashed out and landed on the masked woman’s body.

The masked woman suddenly opened her eyes and threw a punch at the sword energy.

“Boom!”

In an instant, the sword intent shattered, and the masked woman took a step back.
