1811 The Stubborn Qin Yu

Qin Yu’s heart thumped, and he suddenly felt something not good.

“Are you all here to register?” Jiu Xiao asked somewhat indifferently.

“Of course. Jiu Xiao, don’t keep us in suspense. Hurry up and choose,” someone by the side said jokingly.

Jiu Xiao indeed did not waste any time. He glanced at the crowd and finally began to select members.

One, two, three.

!!

Without exception, all of these people were outstanding figures of Demon-slaying Peak.

When Jiu Xiao was about to choose the fifth one, he suddenly stopped and said, “I have to remind you that this trip to ZhongZhou is very dangerous. The people you’re dealing with are not simple either. You’ll likely lose your lives. Do you still want to participate?”

“Jiu Xiao, since we’re here, we’re naturally prepared to die,” someone said.

Seeing this, Jiu Xiao no longer said anything and began to choose the remaining people.

The sixth, the seventh.

Soon, there was only one spot left.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s face was extremely ugly.

He stared at Jiu Xiao as if he had placed all his hope on him.

At this time, Jiu Xiao walked up to Qin Yu and paused.

His gaze fell on Qin Yu, and in the next second, he looked at Jue Wu.

“You’re the eighth,” Jiu Xiao pointed at Jue Wu and said.

Jue Wu frowned and hurriedly said, “I’ll give my spot to Qin Yu!”

A hint of anger flashed across Jiu Xiao’s face, and he said with a gloomy face, “This spot was decided by me, not by you. If you don’t want to go, I can give this spot to someone else!”

Jue Wu’s brows furrowed tightly, and she subconsciously looked at Qin Yu.

Although Qin Yu knew that Jiu Xiao would not choose him, he still felt extremely uneasy when the results were out.

“You go,” Qin Yu forced a smile and said.

Jue Wu gritted her teeth and didn’t know what to do.

If she didn’t go, Qin Yu wouldn’t get any points.

Therefore, she could only bite the bullet and agree.

“Alright, all of you may leave.” Jiu Xiao waved his hand, turned around, and returned to the chessboard.

Everyone left the cave abode. Qin Yu and Jue Wu also left.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s face was very unsightly. He clenched his fists from time to time, and his face was full of reluctance.

Even though Xiao Yu had told Qin Yu not to enter Zhongzhou before he reached the Reversion Void Stage, he was still willing to do so because her beloved was in Zhongzhou.

“Qin Yu, don’t think too much. Jiu Xiao didn’t let you go for your own good.” Someone came over to comfort him.

“Yeah. Even if we go, we might not be able to come back, let alone you,” someone else said.

Qin Yu forced out a smile with difficulty and said, “I understand, thank you.”

Qin Yu was in a bad mood after he returned to the cave abode.

Disappointment and helplessness filled his mind. For a moment, he didn’t want to do anything.

Jue Wu understood Qin Yu’s feelings, so she didn’t say much and just quietly accompanied Qin Yu.

Qin Yu sat there for the whole day in such a situation.

The sky was getting dark, and night had fallen.

Late at night, Qin Yu, who was sitting on the ground, suddenly stood up.

“What are you doing?” Jue Wu hurriedly asked.

“I want to try again,” said Qin Yu in a deep voice.

“What do you mean?” Jue Wu frowned.

I’m going to see Jiu Xiao,” Qin Yu said coldly. “I believe that opportunities are always fought for, and not given out by others.”

“You’re going to beg him?” Jue Wu was stunned.

“Of course not.” Qin Yu took a deep breath. “I’ll fight for a spot my way.”

“I’ll go with you!” Jue Wu hurriedly said.

But Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No need, I’ll go by myself. Don’t follow me, or you’ll only ruin things.”

After saying this, Qin Yu went straight to Jiu Xiao’s cave abode.

At the entrance of the cave abode, Qin Yu pushed the huge stone door hard.

“Qin Yu requests an audience.”

Although Qin Yu’s voice was not loud, it could penetrate the stone door and be heard clearly by Jiu Xiao.

A few seconds later.

The stone door slowly opened.

Without hesitation, Qin Yu strode in.

The moment he stepped into the cave abode, the door slowly closed.

Qin Yu went straight through a dark path and soon arrived in front of Jiu Xiao.

Jiu Xiao stared at the chessboard and said, “Why? Are you here to demand an explanation?”

“No.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“So you’re here to beg me?” Jiu Xiao raised his eyebrows.

“No,” Qin Yu clenched his fists, and his internal qi slowly rose.

“I want fight with you. If I win, you will let me go. How about it?” Qin Yu said.

Jiu Xiao could not help but laugh.

He slowly stood up and sneered, “Fight with me? You? A Mighty Realm cultivator? Are you here to die?”

“You and I suppress to be in the same cultivation realm,” Qin Yu said.

Jiu Xiao laughed even louder when he heard this.

But at this moment, Jiu Xiao suddenly changed the topic. He then suddenly reached out his hand, grabbed Qin Yu’s neck, and lifted him into the air.

The huge force made Qin Yu unable to move. He even had difficulty breathing.

“Do you think this mission is a game? To suppress to the same cultivation realm? Why? Do you think your enemies will also suppress their cultivation realms to the Mighty Realm for the sake of fairness? Do you think everyone will pamper you?”

Following a shout, Jiu Xiao threw Qin Yu aside.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and stood up from the ground. He clenched his fists and said, “It’s not necessary then. Just make your move!”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Jiu Xiao was shocked.

He didn’t seem to believe his ears. Thus he asked, “What did you just say? Say it again.”

“I said we’ll fight like this. If I win, you’ll let me go to Zhongzhou,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Jiu Xiao’s face turned even colder.

“If you want to die, you can die somewhere else. Don’t dirty my hands,” Jiu Xiao said coldly.

“Cut the crap!” However, the stubborn Qin Yu would not give up. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

After a shout, he raised his hand and threw the Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch that headed straight in Jiu Xiao’s direction!

In the face of Qin Yu’s sudden attack, Jiu Xiao could only raise his hand to receive it.

His palm was extremely soft and gentle. The moment it touched Qin Yu, it immediately dissolved Qin Yu’s power!

The extremely heavy force seemed to be hitting cotton!

Before Qin Yu could feel shocked, a huge force suddenly rushed over!

It was the Jiu Xiao’s palm!

He grabbed the back of Qin Yu’s neck and hit his lower abdomen with his knee!

It was just an ordinary knee strike, but its power was so terrifying that even Qin Yu’s body could not withstand it. His internal organs seemed to have suffered a huge impact!

“Pfft!”

Qin Yu spat out a mouthful of blood!
