1964 The Domineering Jue Wu

Seeing Jue Wu, Qin Yu was stunned initially, then suddenly woke up!

“Jue… Jue Wu? What are you doing here?” Qin Yu rubbed his eyes as if he couldn’t believe what was happening in front of him.

Jue Wu, gnawing on the leg of some unknown beast, put her leg down.

She hopped over to Qin Yu and said with a smile, “If I hadn’t come, you would have already died outside.”

!!

Qin Yu suddenly recalled the scene before he fainted. In the daze, he had indeed heard Jue Wu’s voice.

At that time, Qin Yu thought he was hallucinating. He didn’t expect it to be true.

“Did Dean Lei agree to you leaving Thunder Courtyard?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

Jue Wu waved her hand and said, “We’ll talk about this later. You should first take a look at that kid.”

Qin Yu looked at the city lord and saw bitterness on his face.

He said, somewhat pleading, “Mr. Qin, please explain clearly to your friend. She has killed countless people in our city. If you don’t explain it clearly, I’m afraid I’ll die too.”

Qin Yu instantly felt something was wrong. He rubbed his forehead and felt a little headache.

Jue Wu was incredibly impulsive. When she was mad, she couldn’t care less about anything.

Looking at the current situation, Qin Yu roughly understood what was happening.

Helplessly, Qin Yu could only explain it to Jue Wu.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the city lord finally heaved a sigh of relief.

“You heard that, right? It has nothing to do with me,” the city lord muttered.

Jue Wu glared at him and said, “How does it have nothing to do with you? Isn’t that d*mned guard your people?”

The city lord opened his mouth but was lost for words immediately.

“Jue Wu, tell me, how many people did you kill?” Qin Yu asked, feeling uneasy.

Jue Wu counted with her fingers but waved her hand impatiently and said at the end, “I’ve forgotten. Who would remember something like this for no reason?”

Qin Yu sighed. He looked at the city lord, who said in a low voice, “A total of 82 people. More than half of the city’s defensive forces have died.”

“Sigh! What a sin!” Qin Yu smiled bitterly, but he did not know what to say.

After all, Jue Wu had done this to save her. Thus Qin Yu couldn’t blame her.

However, those who had died were innocent.

“City Lord, I’ll have to trouble you to help me compensate their families.” Qin Yu stood up and cupped his hands.

Then, Qin Yu took out 80-odd ores and handed them to the city lord.

“I’ll have to trouble you to help me pass these ores to their families,” Qin Yu said.

The city lord did not reject. He took the ores and said, “This is the only way now.”

“Alright! Alright! You quickly go now,” Jue Wu waved her hand and said.

After these eight days, the city lord didn’t dare to offend Jue Wu at all. Thus he quickly ran out. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After he left, Jue Wu grinned and said, “You’re great, kid. You actually gave the Si family a good beating. It’s awesome!”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at Jue Wu and said, “Tell me first how you left Thunder Courtyard. Did you sneak out? ”

“Of course not!” Jue Wu said proudly, “Old Man Lei personally allowed me!

“Old Man Lei…” Qin Yu opened his mouth and was speechless.

“You can’t call Dean Lei this in public, understand?” Qin Yu warned her.

Jue Wu waved her hand, saying, “Don’t talk bulls*it to me. I’m not a child. In terms of age, you’re even too young to call me grandma.”

At this moment, Jue Wu seemed to have thought of something suddenly.

She flipped her palm and took out a Saint Weapon.

It was a fan, and each of its ribs was tremendously exquisite. Not only was it a Saint Weapon, but it was also an extraordinary one.

“Did Dean Lei give this to you?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

Upon hearing this, Jue Wu said with great pride, “Old Man Lei asked me to use my points to exchange for it. Guess what? I ran straight to Demon-slaying Peak and snatched a wave of points! Hahaha! Old Man Lei thought I would need at least half a year to leave Thunder Courtyard. He never expected me to need less than a day to accumulate enough points!”

Qin Yu was speechless.

“Don’t worry. I’ll protect you from now on. The Si family can’t do anything to you,” Jue Wu said proudly.

Qin Yu attempted to feel Jue Wu’s internal qi and found her cultivation realm didn’t advance much. It was almost the same as Qin Yu’s current cultivation realm.

However, her strength could not be measured with common sense. If she had absorbed the power of the purple cloud pearl, the cultivation realm would be useless to her.

“The Si family isn’t as simple as you think,” Qin Yu said.

Qin Yu suddenly thought of the Yao family.

Thus he hurriedly got up, found the city lord, and asked him about the matter.

After listening to him, the city lord couldn’t help but sigh, “I initially planned to go to the Yao family on the same day, but due to an unexpected incident, I planned to leave the next day. However, I didn’t expect your friend to come into the city on the same night. Therefore…”

“So the Yao family is still unaware of this matter…” Qin Yu felt a little embarrassed.

Jue Wu was a typical restless person no one could control.

“But don’t worry, I’ve already sent people to the Yao family. I believe it won’t be long before the Yao family knows about the matter,” the city lord said.

“Thank you very much,” Qin Yu said with a bow.

Therefore, Qin Yu and Jue Wu hung out together for the following few days.

...

With Jue Wu by her side, Qin Yu was much more at ease.

After all, with her current strength and the Saint Weapon in her hand, even a Semi-Saint would have to think twice before he made a move.

In the blink of an eye, three days passed by.

Early in the morning, the city lord brought two elderly men into Qin Yu’s room.

“Mr. Qin, the Yao family’s elders have arrived,” the city lord said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu quickly got up.

He saw two elderly men standing in front of him. The two elderly men’s internal qi was not weak, but they were not the two who had invited Qin Yu before.

“Pleased to meet you, Elders,” Qin Yu got up, bowed, and said.

The two elders looked at each other, then turned to Qin Yu and said, “You’re Qin Yu?”

“That’s right. The Yao family had sent someone to invite me before,” Qin Yu said.

“In that case, please come with us, Mr. Qin. We’ll bring you to the Yao family now,” the two elders said with a smile.

...

After that, they took out a token and handed it to Qin Yu.

“This is the Yao family’s token. You must bring this with you when you head to the Yao family,” one of the elderly men said.

Qin Yu didn’t think much of it. After all, the Yan family did the same.

He took over the token and was just about to put it on his body when a purple light suddenly burst out and shattered the token in Qin Yu’s hand.

Qin Yu frowned and quickly turned to Jue Wu, saying, “What are you doing?”

Jue Wu coldly snorted. “What bulls*it token is this? It’s just a small formation that can restrain spiritual power, right?”
