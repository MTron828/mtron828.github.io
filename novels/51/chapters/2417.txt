Chapter 2418 Put Down the Butcher’s Knife

What demonic technique was this?

Ha!

The Traceless Demonic Scripture had finally entered the second level. This move would be called the Northern Underworld Demonic Technique!

At this moment, the range of the violent suction force expanded further. The Northern Underworld Demonic Technique enveloped the area within a hundred thousand feet of the Ji family. In an instant, millions of people directly turned into dried corpses.

These were the outer disciples of the Ji family. They were in charge of transporting supplies to the Ji family and some chores.

At this moment, after Qin Yu unleashed the Northern Underworld Demonic Technique, the people who had lived here for thousands of years instantly turned into a pile of bones for some reason.

“Boom!” An explosion sounded in Qin Yu’s mind. Endless spiritual energy entered his body and opened another acupoint.

The power of the vitality gate acupoint rushed to the Yintang acupoint, and then the vigorous chaotic qi rushed to his left foot again.

The Yongquan acupoint in the middle of his left foot suddenly burst out, and a terrifying energy instantly entered that space.

Three apertures! Accomplished!

“Why haven’t you left yet?”

Qin Yu looked at Ji Tianming with a ferocious smile on his face.

“Do you think you can make me stay?” Ji Tianming looked calm as if he was numb to it.

Yintang! Explode!

Vitality gate! Explode!

Yongquan! Explode!

Evil Eye! Power Absorption!

An eerie smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face. The massive force exploded his body into a bloody mist that filled the sky.

The power erupted from his three acupoints already reached the Tribulation Third Level Soul Sinking. In addition, Qin Yu had absorbed Evil Eye’s underworld power. At this moment, his power had reached the Condensed Throne.

“Explode!”

A saber light suddenly exploded in front of Ji Tianming’s chest, and a terrifying power was flowing on his body.

In an instant, that terrifying power opened up a vast wound.

The black saber!

After that attack, the black saber could not withstand the massive force and instantly turned to dust.

Qin Yu did not use Evil Eye. Its sword energy was too uncontrollable and scattered.

For Ji Tianming, using the black saber to sneak attack was better than using Evil Eye.

Hehehe!

Qin Yu’s face was ashen at this moment. Even his body could not withstand erupting the power of the three acupoints and borrowing the power of Evil Eye.

At this moment, he felt a heart-wrenching pain even if he moved slightly.

However, Ji Tianming was even more miserable. With the sneak attack of the black saber, the power of the Tribulation Fourth Level had basically severely injured his body. He could not even move.

“Stop! Don’t you want to know the treasures of my Ji family for so many years?”

Ji Tianming’s expression changed drastically. At this moment, he finally felt the fear of death.

“Hahaha, don’t be anxious. I’ll stop as you said.”

Qin Yu was a little tempted, and Evil Eye slashed down.

“Evil beast! How shameless!”

Ji Tianming let out a mournful cry. He did not expect Qin Yu to be so shameless. Seeing his condition, he still ambushed him at the last moment.

“Amitabha!”

A voice came from the void, and the golden Buddha’s light struck Qin Yu’s Evil Eye.

A string of prayer beads floated on Ji Tianming’s body and enveloped him.

“Four sects, four schools, and two saints? Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect! Are you from the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect?”

Ji Tianming cried out in shock.

“Thank you for saving my life, Master. This person has killed tens of millions of people in my Ji family. He has even killed countless innocent people of the outer sect. This demon is beyond redemption.”

“Lay down the butcher’s knife and achieve Buddhahood. I am a monk named Wu Chang. Young friend, you are talented and intelligent. I don’t wish to transform you. Please cease your actions.”

That voice carried a trace of Sanskrit power, and every word exploded in Qin Yu’s mind.

This power was similar to the Ghostly Sword Evil Eye. Both were the power of transformation.

A thought could lead to the Pure Land or hell.

“This is Master Wu Chang, right? I’ve heard of this name since long ago. Who doesn’t know this name? Since Master has spoken, it makes things easy!”

The Way of Yin and Yang!

Qin Yu’s Evil Eye suddenly attacked, and two internal qi, one white and the other black, rushed out.

The Way of Yin and Yang transformed into sword energy and slashed down. Qin Yu’s body suddenly collapsed to the ground, releasing this attack.

The black saber’s attack earlier had already exhausted his strength. After this attack, he could not even lift his finger.

“Put down your butcher’s knife!”

Wu Chang grabbed the prayer beads with both hands and shouted.

A boundless Buddha’s light rushed out of his hand and clashed with the Way of Yin and Yang. In the end, both of them disappeared.

“Forget it, forget it. You bald donkey do have some skills, and I can’t defeat you. I’ll keep this stinky old man alive for the time being.”

Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Please hand over the demon saber. Countless vengeful souls are in this saber, and Fengdu’s internal qi is on it. This demon saber might bring a tremendous disaster to the human world!”

Wu Chang appeared in front of Qin Yu.

“Is it good enough if I hand over the demon saber?” Qin Yu asked with a smile.

“Please follow me to the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect and chant scriptures for the tens of millions of vengeful souls here for a hundred years.”

Wu Chang said softly.

As he spoke, he grabbed the string of prayer beads with one hand, and the phantom of Buddha’s Pure Land slowly formed.

Qin Yu seemed to have been shackled in the terrifying Buddha’s light.

His soul emitted intense smoke, and the Buddha’s light instantly melted a vast amount of soul power.

“F*ck you, bald donkey. You were merely watching the show when I was surrounded and beaten up by the Ji family. After I finished dealing with these dogs, you came out to take advantage of me. You even pretended to be righteous. Why don’t you go eat sh*t with your chicken mouth?”

Qin Yu pointed at the bald monk’s nose and cursed.

“Hahaha!”

In the sky, a tinkling laugh burst out suddenly.

“Suppress!”

Wu Chang released the prayer beads in his hand, and the Buddha’s Pure Land pressed down on Qin Yu.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s physical body was instantly squeezed, and he spat out a mouthful of blood. He could not even breathe.

This power had completely crushed him. Qin Yu probably could not resist it even was at his peak.

“Hey, Wu Chang, stinky chicken mouth, I have a gift for you.”

Qin Yu pulled open the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes’ lid and threw it out.

The Yao family’s Immortal Emperor’s corpse suddenly opened his eyes and kicked out.

The phantom of Buddha’s Pure Land instantly turned into countless cracks, and the bright Buddha’s light flowed out like water and disappeared in an instant.

Qin Yu ate a green spirit fruit and then immediately retreated.

“Boom!”

In the massive energy of dead bodies, the Immortal Emperor’s corpse was out of control, like an uncontrollable wild beast.

He pounced at the bald donkey in front of him.

Boundless Buddha’s light collided with the soaring energy of dead bodies, and the entire world changed color in an instant.

Qin Yu kept retreating, afraid that he would be affected.

“Fist of the Great Buddha!”

Wu Chang’s expression was solemn. The string of prayer beads spun and entered his body.

A giant Buddha phantom slowly formed in Wu Chang’s hand, and he punched at the Immortal Emperor’s corpse.

“Roar!”

The Immortal Emperor’s corpse also punched out and smashed the golden light.

Then, it roared and smashed toward Wu Chang like a humanoid monster.

Buddha’s Fury! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Wu Chang appeared calm. The prayer beads appeared in his hand again and exploded.
