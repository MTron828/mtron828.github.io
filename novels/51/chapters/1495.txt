Chapter 1496: Chapter 1,496, who said I’m exhausted? 1 

For a moment, everyone cried out in surprise.

Once this technique was used, it would be a devastating blow to the surroundings.

Regardless of whether it was a person or an object, they would all be destroyed!

This technique could be said to be a divine skill in a great battle. It was incomparable!

Although Qin Yu was not as powerful as the absolute dance, it was enough to deal with Hua Zi.

Under the sky flower of all creation, Hua Zi’s body was bleeding non-stop, and his body was on the verge of shattering!

He only felt that his entire body was being stirred, as if it was going to be crushed at any moment!

“Ah! ! !”

Hua Zi raised his head and roared furiously, trying his best to resist. However, the sky flower of all creation was too powerful, and no matter how much spiritual power he unleashed, he was unable to resist at all!

“Plop!”

Finally, Hua Zi could not hold on any longer. His body fell to the ground, and his internal Qi was rapidly withering!

Meanwhile, the three elements holy palm was also stacked on top of Qin Yu, as if it wanted to crush Qin Yu!

Qin Yu naturally did not dare to be negligent. He immediately summoned the venerable fifth mountain and placed it in front of him!

His extremely huge body firmly blocked qin yu behind him.

“Boom!”

The three elements sacred palm slammed into the mountain. However, the power of the three elements sacred palm was too great. The venerable fifth mountain could not withstand it at all and was sent flying!

“Pu!”

The gigantic mountain smashed into Qin Yu’s body. The three elements sacred palm also penetrated through the mountain and headed straight for Qin Yu!

Qin Yu roared in anger. His entire body shone with golden light as he conjured a spell on his hands to block the three elements sacred palm!

“Boom!”

A loud explosion sounded out as the air waves spread out in all directions, shattering the void and the mountains!

Qin Yu’s forehead was covered in sweat and he looked like he was having a hard time.

Even so, he was still unable to withstand the three elements sacred palm and was struck on his chest!

His chest instantly caved in and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Then, Qin Yu half-kneeled on the ground and slid a few meters before he managed to stabilize himself.

“Qin Yu!”

Jue Wu shouted and then shot toward Qin Yu.

She helped Qin Yu up and frowned, “How do you feel?”

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, then shook his head and said, “I’m fine.”

Jue Wu said in a deep voice, “Qin Yu, that wasn’t your real ability just now, was it?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Qin Yu was startled and said with some surprise, “You saw it?”

“Nonsense!”Jue Wu rolled her eyes and said, “Why did you hide your strength? Why didn’t you fight openly?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and sneered, “You’ll know in a while. The real big battle has just begun.”

“Real big battle? What does that mean?”Jue Wu seemed to be a little puzzled.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “You’ll know in a while.”

At a glance, Qin Yu seemed to be quite weak. He was also seriously injured by the three elements holy palm.

On the other hand, Hua Zi was even more miserable. He fell to the ground and even had some difficulty getting up.

“It seems that Qin Yu is still better,”someone said.

“Yeah, I’m afraid that no one in this generation of geniuses can suppress Qin Yu.”

“The difference between the two isn’t too big. Perhaps it’s the difference in their spells. In that case, absolute dance’s myriad heaven flower seems to be better than Mister Yong Ji’s three Yuan Sacred Palm.”

Hua Zi, who was lying on the ground, was even more furious. He desperately wanted to get up, but no matter what, he couldn’t.

“Almost... almost!”Hua Zi roared crazily in his heart!

He was so close to defeating Qin Yu! How could he accept this? !

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and walked towards the crowd with the help of Wen Dawen Er.

Some people came to congratulate Qin Yu and expressed their respect for him.

“Little Friend Qin, it’s better for you to go back and rest early and recuperate well.”

“Yes, I will visit you in the future.”

Qin Yu did not say anything. His eyes were looking at a certain place as if he was waiting for something.

“You are already here, why are you still afraid?”Qin Yu shouted towards a certain direction!

This voice contained powerful spiritual power, and it actually directly shattered that space!

From the collapsed space, several black-clothed people walked out.

Their bodies were wrapped in black robes, and it was impossible to see their faces.

“HM? Who are they? Why are they hiding here?”

“They’re all dressed in black... could they be from the northern lands?”

“What do you all want!”

The group of black-robed men looked coldly at Qin Yu and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, today is the Day You Die!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but laugh out loud, “So you’re all here for me. It seems that the northern lands are very interested in me.”

“Cut the crap. You must die here today!”Someone shouted angrily.

“With your current state, we can kill you at any time. I advise you to be more sensible.”

“What big words!”Jue Wu was instantly enraged.

She stood in front of Qin Yu and said coldly, “You guys can take a step forward and try!”

“Jue Wu! I advise you to mind your own business!”Someone shouted.

“That’s right. If you force us into a corner, you’ll die here today!”

“Screw you! I’d like to see so for myself what these maggots of the northern lands are capable of!”Jue Wu rolled up her sleeves and said furiously.

Just as she was about to make a move, Qin Yu stretched out his hand to stop her.

“There’s no need for you to make a move. I can handle these few people myself,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The black-robed man on the other side could not help but be overjoyed. They sneered and said, “I’ve always said that you like to be conceited and show off your abilities. Now that I’ve seen you today, you really live up to your reputation.”

“That’s right. You Can’t even stand properly. Your internal QI is weak and exhausted. I’m afraid that you won’t be able to display even ten percent of your strength. How dare you say such Arrogant Words?”

Qin Yu looked at the few of them coldly. A cold smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

“Who said I’m exhausted?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly.

In the next second, Qin Yu’s body burst out with an extremely powerful internal Qi! A terrifying pressure swept across the entire yin palace at this moment!

After feeling the power on Qin Yu’s body, everyone turned pale with fright!

This... Was this really the power that burst out from Qin Yu’s body? One had to know that he was only a small cultivator in the nascent soul realm!

What was even more shocking was that he had just experienced a great battle. How could he have such an internal Qi?

“Could it be that... he had been hiding his strength just now?”Someone exclaimed.

“In other words, he didn’t use his full strength when dealing with Hua Zi?”

“If that’s the case... Hua Zi and Qin Yu don’t seem to be on the same level at all...”

For a moment, everyone’s faces were filled with shock. Even Jue Wu was slightly stunned.

Hua Zi, who was lying on the ground, immediately vomited blood.

“Qin Yu, you... you dare to humiliate me...”

Hua Zi, who was already severely injured, suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

He raised his hand with difficulty and pointed at Qin Yu. His face was filled with unwillingness.

Qin Yu turned to look at hua zi and said coldly, “That’s right. I’m humiliating you. Killing you means nothing to me. But destroying your dao heart must be worse than death.”
