Chapter 774: Jiang He’s Disciple Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Upon hearing this, Jiang He immediately hesitated.

The nine secrets was Jiang He’s ultimate technique.

In the entire world, not many people knew this technique.

Even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association didn’t have any records of the nine secrets!

And the reason why Jiang He could be known as the number one person in the world was precisely because of the nine secrets!

“What, you can’t bear to?” The Pavilion Master smiled and poured a cup of tea for Jiang He.

Jiang He sighed slightly and said, “I originally planned to wait until after I die before I spread the nine secrets.”

“After death? The life and death of a person isn’t something that can be controlled by oneself.” The Pavilion Master shook his head.

Jiang He was stunned, then he laughed loudly and said, “That makes sense! Alright, then I’ll bet with you!”

“It’s a deal.”

...

At this time, Qin Yu had already jumped down from the Pavilion Master’s building.

And the man with the mustache had disappeared to who knows where.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inwardly, “If this bastard were to dig up the Pavilion Master’s ancestor’s grave, it would be troublesome!”

Helpless, Qin Yu could only release his divine sense to search for the man with the mustache.

“Qin Yu.”

At this moment, a voice came from behind Qin Yu.

Turning around, Qin Yu saw a girl standing behind him.

And she was no other than Taozi.

Taozi’s face had a hint of surprise, but underneath the surprise was a hint of shyness.

“Taozi?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little surprised.

Since the last time they parted, the two of them hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

Therefore, Qin Yu went to a pavilion with Taozi to sit down.

Taozi poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu and then asked, “Qin Yu, have you heard from Yao Qing recently?”

Qin Yu shook his head and sighed. “No.”

Speaking of which, Qin Yu really missed this guy a little.

His despicable expression always flashed in Qin Yu’s mind.

“Last time, when he left, he said that he would either die outside or become famous.” Taozi grabbed the corner of his clothes.

“Now that you have become famous, almost everyone in the world has heard of your deeds, but Yao Qing has never returned. I’m afraid...”

Qin Yu’s expression darkened.

He raised his head to look at Taozi and said, “Do you think Yao Qing is dead?”

“I’m just worried since his talent isn’t high, and he’s alone too,” Taozi said.

“Moreover, everyone knows about his relationship with you. After your accident, there were quite a number of people who came to look for him.”

Qin Yu’s expression immediately turned ugly, and for a moment, he even felt uneasy.

To Qin Yu, there weren’t many people in this world who were important to him. Yao Qing was one of them.

“Qin Yu, don’t worry too much. I’m just guessing.” Taozi saw the situation and quickly comforted him.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but stand up. He couldn’t help but curse in his heart, “I should have gone to look for him earlier.”

“You can’t find him even if you look for him. He’s determined to go out and make some achievements,” Taozi consoled.

“This is his own choice. Perhaps... Perhaps this will make him happier.”

Qin Yu was speechless.

That’s right. Everyone would choose their own path, and only the path they chose would be something they were willing to take.

“I’ll think of a way to find him,” Qin Yu said.

Taozi nodded and said, “Mm.”

After some small talk, Qin Yu learned that Taozi had also become an elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Her talent in alchemy was extremely high, and after Qin Yu’s accident, the Pavilion Master had personally taken care of her. This also allowed her alchemy skills to improve at a rapid pace.

“Qin Yu, I’ll follow you back to the Green Moon Villa in the future,” Taozi said.

Qin Yu reached out and touched Taozi’s head, saying, “Okay, I have the same intention.”

When Qin Yu, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and the various aristocratic families fought head-on, countless people would be injured. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

And Taozi would be of great use.

After parting with Taozi, Qin Yu used his divine sense to search for the man with the mustache.

Soon, Qin Yu found the man with the mustache on the back mountain of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

He saw that the man with the mustache was already filled with tools, and he was working hard to dig something out.

Qin Yu rushed over and kicked his butt from behind, causing him to fall to the ground.

“What are you doing?!” Qin Yu scolded.

The man with the mustache crawled up from the ground. He stared at him and said, “Of course I’m searching for treasures!”

“Don’t dig up the Pavilion Master’s ancestor’s grave!” Qin Yu scolded.

The man with the mustache pointed at the ground and said, “This isn’t an ancestor’s grave at all! It’s a battlefield that was once left behind! Just like the Immortal Slaying Sect!”

Qin Yu’s eyes immediately lit up.

“Is what you said true?” Qin Yu said somewhat excitedly.

The man with the mustache stroked his beard and muttered, “Of course, saying that it’s the same as the Immortal Slaying Sect is obviously a bit of an exaggeration, but there must be a treasure.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “As long as it’s not a grave, it’s fine. If the Pavilion Master blames you, you’ll be in trouble.”

“Don’t worry.” The man with the mustache waved his hand.

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu was still a little worried.

Hence, he sat here and quietly watched the man with the mustache to prevent any accidents from happening.

In the evening, a young man suddenly appeared on the back mountain.

He took steady steps and slowly walked towards Qin Yu.

This person’s body contained traces of killing intent. This killing intent was approaching Qin Yu.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and stood up to look at him.

Looking at the young man in front of him, Qin Yu felt that he was somewhat unfamiliar.

“I don’t seem to know you. Why do you want to kill me?” Qin Yu said coldly.

The young man ignored his words and said, “Everyone in the world thinks that you, Qin Yu, are a top-notch genius. Some people even call you the number one genius, but I’m not convinced.”

“So?” Qin Yu questioned.

“Before you appeared, my master once said that I was the person who could change the world,” the young man continued.

“But ever since you appeared, he changed his view.”

“Qin Yu, did you know that you took away the glory that should have belonged to me?!”

As he spoke, the young man’s eyes turned scarlet, and his internal qi erupted!

“Late-stage Martial Marquis Realm?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly when he sensed the young man’s internal qi.

The young man continued, “We are both in the late-stage Martial Marquis realm. Today, I want to see just how capable you are. Are you really like my master said you are?”

“Who is your master?” Qin Yu asked with a frown.

“You will know after I beat you up!” The young man roared angrily, and the internal qi all over his body completely exploded!

A wave of power that swept through the entire area instantly spread out, and the terrifying internal qi shook the back of the mountain until it rumbled!

Qin Yu’s expression changed again.

“This person’s strength is probably not weaker than mine,” Qin Yu said in shock.
