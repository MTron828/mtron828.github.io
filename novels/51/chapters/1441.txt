Chapter 1442: Chapter 1,442, the eve of the great battle

The first elder said those words and turned around to leave.

The many protectors looked at Qin Yu coldly, their eyes filled with intense killing intent.

The killing array that suddenly appeared in the sky made many people tremble in fear.

Qin Yu also raised his head to look at the killing array that filled the sky.

In this killing array, Qin Yu felt a clear and intense killing intent.

“No wonder the first elder is afraid,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Zhuo Jing looked at Qin Yu with a solemn expression.

“Qin Yu, we have to think of a way,”Zhuo Jing said coldly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s alright. When I recover, I’ll go out and fight.”

“Fight? Qin Yu, the first elder clearly came prepared this time. God knows what treasures he has on him,”the first elder said in a deep voice.

This made Qin Yu somewhat afraid, but he wasn’t too worried.

After all, he also had two treasures on him: The Big Iron Rod and the picture.

These two treasures were extremely mysterious, and the picture came from the masked woman. Even the spiritual artifacts of the Heavenly Cloud sect weren’t enough to be used as evidence.

“Brother Zhuo, don’t come with me later,”Qin Yu said.

Zhuo Jing shook his head and said, “The great elder has already noticed me. Whether I come with you or not, the result is almost the same.”

After saying that, Zhuo Jing pulled out the Silver Spring in his hand.

He shook the silver spring and said coldly, “With the Silver Spring in my hand, I have some confidence.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He took out the life qi and then threw it up.

After absorbing the life Qi again, Qin Yu clearly felt that the spiritual Qi in his body was soaring!

And the spiritual Qi had recovered a lot at this moment.

Qin Yu sat on the ground. He closed his eyes slightly and slowly absorbed the life qi.

“It seems that the life qi is really useful,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “Of course. You should know that it is extremely difficult to get the life qi. Its preciousness can not be compared with medicinal herbs.”

Qin Yu nodded. He slightly closed his eyes and began to absorb the surrounding spiritual Qi.

There were many people in the exchange guild trading medicinal herbs here, so the spiritual Qi here was quite dense.

That small vortex appeared once again on Qin Yu’s body. This was formed from Spiritual Qi, and it was extremely mysterious.

Such a miraculous scene also attracted many people to come and watch.

“This person is Qin Yu, right? His cultivation method is indeed terrifying.”

“Rumors say that he has already recovered his spiritual energy. Looks like it’s true.”

“How terrifying. A nascent soul stage cultivator, without spiritual energy, actually used his physical body to repel the first elder. It’s hard to imagine.”

“I really don’t know how powerful he is now...”

Not only did they not know, even Qin Yu himself didn’t know.

After recovering his spiritual energy, his physical body had improved once again, and he was able to cast spells.

Such an improvement was unimaginable. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It was currently noon. To the displacement guild, this place was like a scenic spot. Every day, they would chase away the crowd at dusk.

Hence, Qin Yu still had half a day to absorb the spiritual energy.

Although Qin Yu absorbed the spiritual energy very quickly, his body had dried up for far too long. It was definitely not something that could be completed in a few days if he wanted to return to his peak condition.

In the blink of an eye, the sky gradually darkened.

People from the displacement guild also began to slowly leave, and the number of people on this mountain also decreased.

“Brother Qin, it’s time for us to leave.”Zhuo Jing woke Qin Yu up.

Qin Yu slightly opened his eyes. He looked at the setting sun, stood up, and said, “En, it’s indeed time to leave.”

The sound of a loud bell had already sounded in the sky. This was the signal to leave.

Qin Yu stretched his muscles and bones, feeling the surging spiritual power in his body.

“Brother Qin, how do you feel?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I can only use thirty percent of my strength at most, and I can’t hold on for too long.”

It seemed that thirty percent of his strength was not much, but in fact, the increase in his combat strength was definitely not just a little bit.

If the great elder did not have the supreme treasure, it was hard to say who would win and who would lose.

Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing strode toward the door.

There were many people standing on the mountaintop around the door.

They crossed their arms and looked as if they wanted to watch the battle.

Soon, Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing arrived near the door.

Seeing Qin Yu’s figure, the Great Elder’s eyes suddenly opened.

His cold eyes were staring at Qin Yu.

“Little Bastard, let’s see where you can run to,”the first elder said coldly.

Qin Yu ignored the first elder. Instead, he looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “Brother Zhuo, you don’t have to make a move later.”

“Brother Qin, I...”

“I’m confident,”Qin Yu interrupted Zhuo Jing.

Seeing this, Zhuo Jing could only nod and say, “Then be careful.”

Qin Yu nodded and walked out of the replacement guild.

The Heavenly Cloud Sect’s protectors arrived in an instant and surrounded Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at them and sneered, “First Elder, let these trash leave.”

Anger immediately appeared on the protectors’faces when they heard this.

A monstrous anger was directed at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu, who was in the middle of the storm, was strolling leisurely, his expression unchanging.
