Chapter 797: Chapter 797, return to Jingdu! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Granny Qin hurriedly stood up and said, “Please rest assured, I will definitely complete the mission!”

At this point, Granny Qin suddenly raised her head and said, “My lords, I have another request.”

“Request? What Request?”A higher-up asked coldly.

Granny Qin gritted her teeth and said, “I want a body transformation pill...”

The higher-ups were silent for a moment, and then coldly said, “Is it for your heaven swallowing Python?”

“Yes...”Granny Qin lowered her head.

A higher-up coldly said, “Granny Qin, you’ve worked for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association for so many years. You should know that if you work here, don’t give yourself too many restrictions. Otherwise, it will affect the entire association.”

“That’s right. If you have worries in your heart, the knife in your hand will not be happy,”another higher-up said.

Granny Qin raised her head and said with a pleading tone, “I have never married for the sake of the martial arts association, and I have never left behind any descendants. The only thing that is important to me now is little black.”

“I would like to ask the high-ranking officials to give me a body transformation pill on account of my hard work!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The high-ranking officials seemed to be moved.

A moment later, a high-ranking official said, “Come back in three days to collect it.”

Granny Qin quickly bowed and said, “Thank you, Lord higher-ups!”

After leaving the meeting room, Granny Qin quickly rushed to the mansion with the handlebar mustache.

Unfortunately, there was no one in the mansion.

On the other side, Xia hang hurriedly called Qin Yu.

At this time, Qin Yu had not boarded the plane and his phone was not switched off.

After picking up the phone, Xia Hang told Qin Yu everything.

“Quickly hide that little girl and the corpse in your hands well,”Xia Hang said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin and sneered, “I had already guessed that they would do this. Don’t worry, I will make proper arrangements.”

The plane flew over the sky.

By the time Qin Yu arrived at the fire country, it was already late at night.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to hide the coffin, the pictures, and the corpse all in Jiangcheng.

It was Qin Yu’s hometown, and also the safest place.

That night, Qin Yu rushed back to Jiangcheng and hid the coffin in the courtyard of his home.

After all this was done, it was already early in the morning.

Qin Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead. He looked at his surroundings and whispered, “It’s been a long time since I’ve been back.”

There were Qin Yu’s old friends here, but Qin Yu didn’t have any time to stay.

Therefore, he didn’t inform anyone. Early in the morning, he took a car and rushed back to Jingdu Martial Arts Academy.

As soon as he returned to the manor with the handlebar mustache, he saw two purple-robed men standing at the gate of the manor.

Qin Yu walked straight forward and asked, “Purple-robed lords, What’s the matter?”

The two purple-robed men looked at each other and said, “Qin Yu, where have you been these past few days? Why didn’t you inform us beforehand?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I don’t think I need to inform you where I’m Going, right?”

The two purple-robed men said coldly, “You are now involved in an important matter. We will temporarily restrict your movements. We hope that you can cooperate.”

“Cooperate the F * ck!”Qin Yu said impatiently.

“Go back and tell Granny Qin, if you have something to say, say it. Don’t waste my time.”

After saying this, Qin Yu was about to go in.

The two purple-robed men took a step forward and blocked Qin Yu’s path.

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold, and a strong killing intent immediately erupted from his body!

After sensing this killing intent, not only the two purple-robed men, but even the mustache man’s expression couldn’t help but change!

“Hey, Hey, Hey, calm down, you two. If there’s anything, let Granny Qin come and talk.”The Mustache Man hurriedly tried to smooth things over.

These two purple robes had long been scared out of their wits. Since the mustached man had given them a way out, they naturally went down the slope.

After they had left, the mustached man could not help but frown and said, “Qin Yu, it’s time for you to restrain your killing intent.”

Qin Yu also frowned slightly.

Ever since he had obtained the power of a martial saint, this killing intent seemed to be out of control and could erupt at any time.

“If you hadn’t stopped them just now, the two of them might have really died,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The Mustache Man smiled bitterly and said, “If this continues, I’m really afraid that you’ll become the next masked woman.”

Not only the Mustache Man, Qin Yu was also a little worried.

After returning to their residence, Qin Yu and the Mustache Man tidied up briefly.

Half an hour later.

Granny Qin led several purple-robed men and Strode in.

“Surround the door!”Granny Qin said coldly.

“Yes!”The purple-robed men quickly surrounded the residence.

Granny Qin Strode into the residence.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting in the hall drinking tea, looking quite pleased with himself.

“Qin Yu, you’re finally back,”Granny Qin said coldly.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Old Bastard, you’re really lucky. I thought you were dead.”

Granny Qin’s face turned cold and she said coldly, “Where are the two corpses? Hand them over now!”

Qin Yu put down the Teacup in his hand and said, “If I hand them over, aren’t you afraid that they’ll slap you to Death?”

A trace of fear flashed across Granny Qin’s face and she even took a step back unconsciously.

It was obvious that the previous incident had left a psychological scar on Granny Qin.

Granny Qin took a deep breath and said coldly, “Qin Yu, I am here under the orders of my superiors to ask you for the corpse and the little girl.”

“This is not a personal grudge between you and me, but an order from the highest level of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

Qin Yu sneered, “What right do they have to order me? They are your superiors, not mine.”

“You want those two corpses, right? Fine, I’ll Give You Yan Ruoxue in exchange!”

Granny Qin’s expression instantly turned cold.

“Qin Yu, I advise you to not be Shameless!”Granny Qin’s body emitted a killing intent.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed, and the killing intent on his body instantly erupted!

“Are you threatening me?”Qin Yu stood up and said.

The internal Qi emitted from Qin Yu’s body was extremely powerful and instantly suppressed Granny Qin’s Aura!

Even Granny Qin’s expression could not help but change slightly.

Qin Yu glanced at the spiritual artifact in her hand and sneered, “Martial saint’s artifact? Why? Do you want to snatch it by force?”

Granny Qin opened her mouth but did not dare to speak for a moment.

For some unknown reason, she suddenly realized that Qin Yu in front of her seemed somewhat different from before.

“How about this?”The mustached man was afraid that Qin Yu would not be able to restrain his killing intent, so he quickly stood up and said.

“The victor between Qin Yu and Blacky has not been decided yet. Let’s use these two corpses as stakes.”

“If Qin Yu wins, you guys bring Qin Yu to the mystic realm where Yan Ruoxue is imprisoned. If Blacky wins, Qin Yu will hand over the two corpses. What do you think?”

Qin Yu glanced at the handlebar mustache and smiled without thinking. “Okay, I agree.”
