Chapter 2729 - 2729: The Myriad Tombs

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The protective energy around the passageway suddenly dissipated. The intense poisonous fog suddenly began to invade Qin Yu’s body.

Qin Yu’s body lit up with flames. Holy light divine flame isolated all the poisonous fog.

“Such a tomb of demonic cultivator should have disappeared long ago.”

Qin Yu showed no mercy.

At the end of the passageway, there was a small space.

There was a dried corpse kneeling on the ground with a string of prayer beads around his neck.

Even though he had been dried for many years, one could still feel his devout attitude from his wrinkles.

Five corpses were hanging above it. Their holy energy had been sucked dry and they were dried up.

A dark and cold thought suddenly pierced into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“If you want to obtain my legacy, you have to wear prayer beads and sacrifice 300 Dao Realm experts. Then you will be my disciple.”

In an instant, a figure took shape in Qin Yu’s mind.

He pointed with his finger and the prayer beads in his hand suddenly flew out.

It was as if a high-temperature red-hot iron bead had surged across the ice, instantly burning into a thick fog.

Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness was in great pain as if his brain was about to be torn apart.

“Mental attack! F*ck you!”

Qin Yu let out a cold smile. “Keep such a sinister inheritance for yourself.”

A saber light slashed out, cutting off the five people on the dried corpse.

Clang!

Qin Yu suddenly heard the sound of a red rope breaking. At this moment, a ferocious little face suddenly appeared.

It was the baby with the jade pendant just now. At this moment, it had transformed into a lifelike child.

Moreover, this baby seemed to be much bigger than the previous level 5 baby.

As it pushed out with one hand, Qin Yu felt an invincible force crush him from the inside of his body.

He suddenly turned the Soul Suppression Ring with his thumb, and the Night Qi decisively poured into it.

He returned in the next moment. There was still a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.

“What a terrifying power! I didn’t even have the strength to resist.”

Moreover, even the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze did not discover the second restriction power. It should be the five-blood restriction.

The opening of the passageway required the sacrifice of five lives.

Just as he cut off the rope on the dried corpse, he broke through this restriction and the jade carving of the baby exploded.

Qin Yu revealed a look of shock. This power seemed to have merged with the power of the Saint Kingdom’s power of order.

There were also some powers that Qin Yu could not detect. Even the Dao of Dreams could not completely divert the damage.

One had to know that the power attribute of the Dao of Dream was even higher than Meng Jing’s power. Since the power could injure it, one could imagine how terrifying it was.

What a strange place! Fortunately, he didn’t detonate two restrictive powers at the same time.

Otherwise, he would have suffered more serious injuries even with the Soul Suppression Ring.

Qin Yu raised his hand and took the prayer beads. Although he did not know how to use this thing, he could at least exchange it for some money.

At that time, he would need to buy it with holy energy ores whether it was information or anything else.

As Qin Yu picked up the prayer beads, a gust of cold wind suddenly attacked.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The dried corpse that was originally kneeling was suddenly blown into powder and dissipated in front of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s vision was also blurry. In the next second, the entire tomb dissipated and Qin Yu appeared at the entrance again.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. This Lingxu City was even more mysterious than he imagined.

As expected, this Holy Kingdom was huge. There were more things than he imagined.

“Hmm?”

Qin Yu suddenly raised his head. He moved and he had already arrived at a place beside him.

At this moment, the surroundings were filled with the smell of blood. There were four corpses on the ground. A seriously injured person was beside them.

The moment he saw Qin Yu, he revealed a terrified expression.

“Get lost.”

Qin Yu was too lazy to kill him. He appeared here mainly to plunder some wealth.

Otherwise, he would not be able to enter the city. He shook his head with a

bitter smile. He did not expect that he would become a bandit one day.

“Thank you for sparing my life, brother.”

The heavily injured man bowed repeatedly and left shakily.

Suddenly, a cold light shot out from his sleeve and instantly appeared on Qin Yu’s head.

He revealed a cold smile.

He had no problem in unleashing the power of a peak level 6 although he was severely injured. How could a person who had just appeared be more familiar with the restrictions of this place than him?

It would be even better if he could unleash the power of level 7. The blood jade would kill him immediately.

However, his expression froze in the next second. Qin Yu did not even use his holy energy.

He used the Milky Way Holy Body to catch the flying blade. With a shake of his wrist, it stabbed into the man’s head at an even more terrifying speed.

Qin Yu shook his head. The person courted death.

These people seemed to be two teams fighting here. It was probably because of the uneven distribution of the spoils.

Moreover, the distribution of strength among these people was also weird.

There were people from all levels. There was even one at the True Consciousness Realm.

However, Qin Yu had figured out something.

There were many restrictions here. When some experts set up secret realms or the inheritance tomb, they would limit the intruder’s strength.

If one tried to force their way in, it would cause a backlash. This had happened many times in the lower realm.

Thus, the True Consciousness Realm might be more useful than the Dao Realm.

After looting the eight people’s storage rings and bags, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

At least he had some ores with him now, so he could enter the city.

He would return to Lingxu City first. He was completely blank about this place now. It was useless to stay here.

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment and decided to go to the city first.

When he was in the demonic cultivator’s tomb, he did not seem to have discovered the power that made him wary.

Perhaps that power was brought about by these jade carvings.

Qin Yu thought to himself.

All of a sudden, a gentle breeze blew over.

The wind was very gentle, but Qin Yu’s body suddenly stiffened.

In front of him, the layers of fog around the myriad tombs surrounding Lingxu City seemed to have been gently wiped away.

The space affected by the myriad tombs also slowly calmed down at this moment.

The myriad tombs appeared clearly in front of everyone. Countless tombstones stood in this place that had existed for an unknown period.

Waves of different energies surrounded the entire sky. It was the first time Qin Yu had seen so many elemental energies gathering together.

The entire world was filled with distorted energy within the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

Countless people in this place were also stunned on the spot.

Lingxu City had existed for an unknown time but this was the first time such a situation appeared.

Countless restrictive red ropes were interwoven. Babies of different sizes revealed cold smiles.

As far as Qin Yu could see, countless babies were smiling strangely at him.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a chill run down his spine..
