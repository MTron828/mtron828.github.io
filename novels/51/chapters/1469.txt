Chapter 1470: Chapter 1,470, the plot of the northern lands

Everyone was shocked by Xiao Hai’s imposing manner!

These top experts from the southern region were all silent at this moment. It seemed that no one dared to oppose Xiao Hai!

The first elder, who was supposed to be the leader of this meeting, was extremely displeased at this moment. However, he did not dare to say anything and could only bite the bullet and endure it.

Xiao Hai looked at long qiao coldly and said, “Do you think you can leave?”

Long Qiao’s expression was extremely ugly. He said in a deep voice, “Xiao Hai, I have no enmity with you. Why do you have to kill me? Can’t you leave a way out for yourself?”

“Hahaha! It’s not up to you to teach me how to be a person!”Xiao Hai shouted and slapped long Qiao with his palm!

Long Qiao did not dare to be negligent. Xiao Hai’s name had long spread in the northern lands. He knew Xiao Hai’s abilities very well!

In an instant, the shadow of the palm had already arrived in front of him!

Long Qiao hurriedly used all his spells in an attempt to resist this palm.

However, his spells appeared extremely weak in front of Xiao Hai. The instant they touched, they were immediately shattered!

“Bang!”

The palm struck long Qiao’s chest, causing him to vomit blood continuously!

Long Qiao secretly felt that things were not looking good. He immediately stood up and prepared to run.

“You want to run? You Can’t Run!”Xiao Hai roared angrily. He waved his large palm, and an overwhelming palm instantly arrived, slamming long Qiao, who was trying to escape, onto the ground!

Dragon Bridge was covered in blood, and his body was almost shattered.

Although he had a protective magic artifact on him, he was still smashed into pieces by Dragon Bridge.

“Xiao Hai, don’t go too far...”dragon bridge gritted his teeth and said.

Xiao Hai looked at dragon bridge coldly and said, “If you have any ability, just use it.”

A trace of blood red appeared in Dragon Bridge’s eyes, and he said angrily, “Then let’s die together!”

With that, Long Qiao’s body began to crumble. Traces of blood-red internal Qi burst out from his eyes!

That internal Qi quickly gathered in front of everyone. In the end, it actually turned into a blood-red figure that looked like a demon!

That figure was incomparably huge, and its entire body was emitting a chill.

“With my body, I will sacrifice god...”long Qiao seemed to have used all his strength to shout this sentence.

Xiao Hai shouted, “Gods? It’s just a small skill, watch me shatter it!”

Xiao Hai’s hands moved, and a terrifying aura condensed.

The next second, Xiao Hai’s palms moved forward, slapping towards the blood-red demon.

With just a single palm, the demon actually directly shattered, disappearing into thin air under everyone’s sight!

Long Qiao’s expression instantly changed! He didn’t expect that the god that he offered sacrifice with his own body and divine sense would actually be shattered with a single palm!

It wasn’t just Dragon Bridge. Everyone present was shocked!

Just what level of strength had Xiao Hai reached? Why was he so terrifying?

Could it be that everyone had underestimated Xiao Hai’s abilities?

“Well done!”Jue Wu shouted excitedly.

Xiao Hai nodded slightly at Jue Wu as a form of greeting.

“Xiao Hai... I, the northern lands, will definitely not let you off...”Dragon Bridge spat out a mouthful of blood. Following that, his body began to dissipate, disappearing without a trace.

Qin Yu could not help but be greatly shocked.

Xiao Hai’s moves were extremely ordinary, and he did not use any spells at all. He was purely relying on his rich spiritual power and rich experience to fight!

After killing Long Qiao, Xiao Hai turned to look at the crowd and shouted, “Whoever dares to collude with the northern lands will be my enemy, and so will the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”

First Elder opened his mouth, and then snorted, saying nothing.

“Mr. Xiao, the northern lands and the southern region are getting closer and closer. If this continues, war will break out sooner or later,”Yong Ji said with a faint smile.

“Is that so? Then I look forward to this day,”Xiao Hai said coldly.

Yong Ji didn’t say anything, but a smile still hung on his face.

“HMPH!”

First Elder snorted coldly and took the lead to leave.

The others also stood up and left.

“Xiao Hai!”Jue Wu waved at Xiao Hai.

Xiao Hai withdrew the sharpness on his body and walked towards Jue Wu.

He sat at Qin Yu’s table and smiled, “Jue Wu, Qu Zhu, long time no see.”

“That’s right. Where have you been all this time?”Jue Wu asked.

Xiao Hai sighed slightly and said, “It’s all because of this bastard from the northern lands.”

“Brother Xiao, what evil deeds did the north do? Why do you hate it so much?”Qu Zhu asked.

Xiao Hai glanced at Qu Zhu and said in a deep voice, “If the north is really like what Dragon Bridge said, just for survival, we are of course willing to give it thirty miles. Let alone thirty miles, so what if it’s three hundred miles or three thousand miles!”

Qu Zhu nodded slightly and waited for him to continue.

Xiao Hai continued, “Unfortunately, according to my understanding, the northern land cultivates sorcery.”

“Three hundred years ago, there were close to one billion people in the northern land, but in these years, there are only a million people left.”Xiao Hai swept his gaze over the crowd.

“You mean... these people were killed by their own people?”Qin Yu guessed.

Xiao Hai nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. The northern land’s resources are scarce, so life is their resource.”

“These years, the people of the northern lands have repeatedly invaded the southern region because of the sudden decline in population. It is no longer enough to support their cultivation.”

Speaking up to this point, Xiao Hai paused for a moment. A trace of anger flashed across his face.

“I heard that in order to cultivate, the northern lands once gathered hundreds of thousands of women. The only thing they did every day was to give birth. They treated them as machines.”

“And the newly born lives will all become their resources!”

Qin Yu’s expression could not help but change drastically!

This was simply shocking! To do such a thing, it made people feel extremely disgusted!

“This northern lands is really inhumane.”Qin Yu’s expression was incomparably cold.

Xiao Hai nodded and said, “That’s right. If there was a chance, I really wanted to eradicate everyone in the northern lands! It’s a pity that my ability is insufficient.”

It was naturally not an easy task to eliminate the north.

The North had developed for so many years and had many experts. Among them, the top-notch martial artist even surpassed the South Province.

There was no other reason. Those who stayed in the north were all geniuses that they had carefully selected.

No one knew what kind of secret the north hid.

“They seem to only need thirty stars. In fact, these thirty stars are enough for them to devour the lives of the South Province cultivators,”Xiao Hai said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu said with some doubt, “Senior Xiao Hai, why didn’t you tell them about this just now?”

“Do you think that even if they knew, they would refuse?”Qu Zhu shook his head and said. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Xiao Hai grunted and said, “Qu Zhu is right. These people are just a bunch of petty people who only have their own interests in their eyes.”

“Sacred Heart technique... The Temptation is really big,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Xiao Hai stood up and said, “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. I have to leave quickly.”

“Where are you going?”Jue Wu asked.

Xiao Hai said, “To the northern border.”

Qu zhu sighed and said, “Brother Xiao Hai, even if you go to the border, I’m afraid it will be difficult to stop you.”
