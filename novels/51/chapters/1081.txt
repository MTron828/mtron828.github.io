Chapter 1082: Chapter 1,082, Reckless Waste of heaven’s treasures 

At this moment, Yan Jinyao had nowhere to hide. and Qin Yu’s punch was incomparably powerful, with the power to destroy everything in its path. The moment he was hit, it was very likely that he would lose his life on the spot!

Everyone cried out in shock, and one after another, they broke out in cold sweat for Yan Jinyao!

“Hong!”

With a loud sound, the surroundings were blocked by dust, and no one could see through it!

Many realm lords could not help but be shocked.

Could it be that Yan Jinyao died under Qin Yu’s Iron Fist?

Soon, the dust dispersed, and a strange scene appeared in front of everyone.

A strange scene appeared in front of Yan Jinyao. This scene was like a small world, but also like a strange vision.

It was this vision that blocked Qin Yu’s fist, avoiding this powerful attack!

Qin Yu coldly looked at the Small World in front of him and could not help but frown.

Qin Yu had seen many such spells recently, but he did not know their origins.

He had originally thought that it was taught by a mighty figure, but now, Yan Jinyao had actually used a similar spell, which made Qin Yu somewhat surprised.

Beads of sweat appeared on Yan Jinyao’s forehead. Clearly, this punch had scared him out of his wits.

His hands were supporting the vision, and his heart was beating rapidly.

“Almost...”Yan Jinyao muttered in a low voice.

The vision in his hands slowly disappeared, and soon disappeared into thin air.

Qin Yu looked at Yan Jinyao coldly and asked, “What kind of spell is this?”

Yan Jinyao did not answer. Instead, he looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You cunning villain, you actually played a trick on me.”

Qin Yu ridiculed, “Great battles are ever-changing. Many times, victory depends on the experience of great battles.”

“Yan Jinyao, you were born in a top aristocratic family. You have been protected by your family since you were young. No one dares to provoke you, and you have almost never experienced any life-and-death battles.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“But I’m different. I crawled out from a pile of dead people. I don’t know how many life-and-death battles I have experienced. How can you be my opponent?”

Yan Jinyao said coldly, “Nonsense. A great battle only needs one battle. Qin Yu, die!”

Yan Jinyao took the initiative to attack. He surrounded the purple-gold flame and transformed into a beam of light that was almost invisible to the naked eye, charging towards Qin Yu.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu flipped his hand and unleashed the seven sorrow palm. The huge golden palm print contained an undefeatable might as it rolled towards Yan Jinyao.

The golden palm slammed onto Yan Jinyao’s body, emitting a crisp sound. It was like a clap of thunder in the early morning, extremely ear-piercing!

Such a violent collision naturally caused everyone to cry out in alarm.

Yan Jinyao’s body did not suffer any injuries. He flipped his body in mid-air and slammed his palm downwards!

His eyes were crimson red and his Qi energy was thin. It was as if he wanted to slam qin Yu into the ground!

Qin Yu humphed coldly as he practiced. His golden body shook slightly, and a pair of flesh fists went up to meet it.

“Boom!”

This was the third collision. Although the two sides could not determine the victor, Yan Jinyao was forced back a few steps.

At this moment, Yan Jinyao suddenly threw his head back and let out a long howl. His internal Qi exploded to the extreme, and his Small World was once again propped up!

A power as heavy as a mountain crushed towards Qin Yu!

This seemed to be some kind of lost secret technique. At a glance, that small world seemed to be a heavenly palace, extremely mysterious!

Qin Yu’s eyes were burning, and his palm slightly trembled. He suddenly stretched out his palm and used the power of his palm to meet it!

“Swish!”

At the instant of the collision, Qin Yu’s palm became extremely huge, like a millstone that covered the sky and earth!

This golden palm grabbed the small world, and its five fingers were like sharp blades, forcefully piercing into this small world!

“Chi la!”

Accompanied by an ear-piercing sound, Qin Yu’s palm exerted force and actually forcefully tore apart the small world that Yan Jinyao had created!

Yan Jinyao’s expression changed drastically, and he secretly exclaimed that things were not good, hurriedly retreating several hundred meters.

However, Qin Yu did not give him a chance to escape. He immediately chased after him using the ‘walking’formula and released the heavy falling space at the same time, cutting off Yan Jinyao’s chance of escape!

Yan Jinyao felt the power that was wrapped around his body. His expression changed drastically, and then he opened his mouth and spat out a bright red.

This bright red instantly turned into flames, bringing with it rolling heat waves as it pounced towards Qin Yu!

This was clearly the power formed from fresh blood, and this blood did not originate from Yan Jinyao’s actual body, but the fusion of Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue’s blood. Its power was unfathomable!

Even Qin Yu felt a sense of danger at this moment, but it was already too late to retreat. He could only clench his fists and meet it head-on.

“Boom!”

A huge collision occurred at this moment, and a monstrous might spread out rapidly!

Qin Yu’s body was pierced through one after another, and his body kept falling down!

“What kind of power is this, so terrifying!”The various realm lords could not help but widen their eyes.

The bright red that Yan Jinyao spat out was not inferior to the power of several bombs exploding at the same time, shaking all directions and causing people’s hearts to tremble!

Qin Yu was smashed into the ground, and his clothes were torn to shreds, revealing his strong muscles.

Many bloody marks appeared on his body. It was obvious that Qin Yu’s body could not withstand the collision.

“Using Yan Ruoxue’s blood essence like this, it’s really a waste of God’s gift.”Qin Yu revealed the secrets of Heaven, causing Yan Jinyao’s face to be greatly shocked!

Just as Qin Yu said, although Yan Jinyao had absorbed the blood essence of Yan Ruoxue and Qin Yu, the fusion rate was extremely low. Most of it was hidden in his body, fusing into a one-time explosive power!

This power was extremely terrifying. Even Qin Yu’s body was injured!

However, this little injury was not fatal. Instead, it completely infuriated Qin Yu.

An extremely intense killing intent was emitted from his body. This killing intent swept through the world, causing everyone to shiver.

“Yan Jinyao, is this blood for you to use like this?”Qin Yu coldly stepped forward and walked towards Yan Jinyao.

Yan Jinyao’s eyelids twitched. He felt a strong sense of unease.

“The blood is on my body. How I use it has nothing to do with you!”Yan Jinyao suddenly roared. In the blink of an eye, he struck out hundreds of palm prints!

However, what was shocking was that Qin Yu’s body opened up a golden barrier. He used his body to forcefully receive the white palm prints!

The golden barrier was cracked and seeped into Qin Yu’s body, causing his body to be covered in blood.

However, this wound was only superficial. It looked like it was covered in blood, but his qi and blood became even stronger!
