Chapter 1132: Chapter 1132, seeking help from the guardian of the path 

The Heaven Gate was extremely lively that day.

From time to time, luxurious cars could be seen driving over.

The moment the cars stopped, people dressed in bright clothes could be seen getting out of the cars.

They were extraordinary people and martial artists from all over the world, and they had gathered here with only one goal, which was to find a person to protect after the opening of the Holy Region.

Qin Yu had beheaded a mighty figure, and he was already hailed as the number one person in the world. Naturally, he became everyone’s target.

At this moment, Qin Yu was sleeping soundly.

It had already been two days since he woke up.

Qin Yu groggily sat up from his bed. The first thing he did was to use his divine sense to cover the entire Heaven Gate. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“HM?”

Very quickly, Qin Yu discovered several strange auras from the internal Qi.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He hurriedly rushed out of the room and arrived at the main hall.

Looking at the people in the hall, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Greetings, Mr. Qin.”Seeing Qin Yu, everyone stood up and greeted Qin Yu.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a bit stunned. He subconsciously looked at the pavilion master.

“These people came here because of their reputation. They came to seek refuge with you,”the pavilion master said as he walked forward.

“Their goal is very simple. They want to seek your protection and ensure that they can enter the saint-level.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Enter the saint-level?

The Saint-level hadn’t been opened yet, so everything about the saint-level was unknown.

Qin Yu didn’t even dare to guarantee himself, let alone the others.

But facing everyone’s request, Qin Yu didn’t know how to refuse.

After a while, qin yu said, “If I have the ability, I will definitely bring you to the holy region. But if I can’t, I hope you won’t blame me.”

“Sir, you must be joking. With your words, we are satisfied.”Everyone bowed and said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He didn’t have much time to waste, so he looked at the pavilion master at the side.

“Pavilion Master, please arrange for them to stay temporarily,”Qin Yu said.

“Okay,”the pavilion master agreed.

Fortunately, the Heaven Gate was big enough. After all, the former was the sacred Confucian school under the Yan family, so it was not difficult to accommodate these people.

After settling them down, Qin Yu stood up and left the Heaven Gate, heading straight for Jingdu.

In the second secret realm, Zhai Xing was waiting here.

He stood in front of that crack, observing the changes in this place every day.

After a few days, this crack had become bigger and bigger, and the internal Qi leaking out of it had also become denser.

“How is it? There are still a few more days before this passage opens.”At this time, Qin Yu appeared behind Zhai Xing.

Zhai Xing glanced at Qin Yu and said, “After a few days of observation, this crack has become bigger every day. On average, it will become three to five centimeters bigger every day.”

“Three to five centimeters...”Qin Yu glanced at the crack.

At this time, the crack was as thick as a wrist. According to this situation, it would be the size of a dog hole in ten days.

“Listen.”

At this time, Zhai Xing suddenly said.

Qin Yu kept quiet and looked at the crack.

A faint sound could be heard from the crack.

This sound was like a wind chime. Although it was not loud, it indicated that the seal could not hold on for long.

“Qin Yu, do you know how to deal with the arrival of those eight upper echelons?”Zhai Xing asked.

“I don’t know.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“In these last ten days, I can only give it a try. As for whether or not I can defeat them... I don’t have any confidence.”

Zhai Xing frowned. “How confident are you?”

Qin Yu pondered for a moment, then stretched out a finger.

“At most 10% confidence,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

After all, those were eight mighty figures, and they were at their peak. It was already not bad to have 10% confidence.

Zhai Xing’s expression was somewhat unsightly. With a sullen face, he said, “What If you lose?”

“Only death.”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

This was the truth. Other than this, Qin Yu could not think of any other countermeasures.

Zhai Xing did not speak. His heart was also troubled.

Facing eight high-ranking officials, it was already good enough that he was not killed in an instant.

“Alright, let’s not talk anymore. I have to go into seclusion. Time is of the essence.”Qin Yu patted Zhai Xing’s shoulder.

“If there are any unusual movements in this seal, remember to wake me up immediately.”

Zhai Xing nodded. He did not say anything, but the expression on his face was rather complicated.

Qin Yu turned around and came to a room.

He closed his eyes slightly and prepared to comprehend the ‘Dou’formula.

Among all the spells, the ‘Dou’formula increased one’s strength the most, so Qin Yu could only place his hopes on the ‘Dou’formula.

After Qin Yu went into seclusion, Zhai Xing left the second secret realm.

He came all the way to the Heaven Gate and found the pavilion master.

Looking at Zhai Xing in front of him, the pavilion master was slightly surprised.

“Senior Zhai Xing, why are you here?”The pavilion master said politely.

Zhai Xing sat there with a gloomy face.

“It’s impossible for Qin Yu to defeat those eight higher-ups.”Zhai Xing went straight to the point.

The pavilion master frowned slightly and said, “Although his chances of winning are indeed not high, it’s not impossible.”

Zhai Xing looked at pavilion master and coldly said, “The possibility is almost zero. I know he killed Tian Zong, but Tian Zong can not be compared with that high-ranking official.”

“The reason why the eight high-ranking officials control the martial arts association of Jingdu is mainly because of the resources on Earth.”

“Who do you think uses these resources? It is those eight high-ranking officials! Earth has billions of years of history, how many treasures are there? And how many sacred cultivation objects are there? Have you ever thought about it?”

“Do you really think that the resources of the martial arts association in Jingdu are all distributed to those Young Masters in Jingdu? What they occupy is just ten thousand of them!”

Pavilion master was silent, waiting for Zhai Xing’s next words.

Zhai Xing continued, “In other words, not only are the high-ranking officials at the peak, they are even more powerful than they were back then.”

“The possibility of Qin Yu fighting against one is not high, let alone those eight.”

Pavilion master was silent for a moment and said, “Then what do you think we should do?”

Zhai Xing suddenly looked at pavilion master and said word by word, “Seek help.”

“Seek help?”Pavilion master smiled bitterly and said, “That is a mighty figure, an invincible existence in the world. Who can we seek help from?”

Zhai Xing said coldly, “The Dao Protector is also Qin Yu’s father.”
