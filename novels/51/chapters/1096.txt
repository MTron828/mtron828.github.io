Chapter 1097: Chapter 1,097, Chang Mang unleashed his power! 

Qin Yu seemed to have sensed something when he sensed waves of internal Qi coming from the surface of the sea.

However, he was not too surprised. This road was not peaceful to begin with. He was even more used to seeing people blocking his way.

“I didn’t expect a martial saint to block my way and Rob Me.”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Although he had said so, he had no intention of leaving the house.

With Chang Mang and the others around, even if a martial saint blocked their way, there was nothing to worry about.

Thus, he once again sat down cross-legged and continued to absorb the divine sense power in this jar.

At this moment, the outside was in a state of anxiety.

It was unknown what kind of secret technique that old man had used to summon a huge demonic beast!

This demonic beast looked like a shark, but it was different from a shark.

Its two shark fins had transformed into two huge arms. The fish belly was sparkling with a crystal-clear light, as if it was plated with a layer of armor.

That pair of gem-like eyes emitted a cruel and bloodthirsty light. The fangs that leaked out from the corner of its mouth were like steel knives.

Looking at this huge demonic beast, Chang Mang could not help but mutter, “What is this thing? It’s neither human nor ghost.”

The old man standing not far away put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “This is a black dragon shark, and it’s a martial saint black dragon shark.”

“Black Dragon Shark? An Advanced Level Earth Rank Demonic Beast?”Yao Meng frowned slightly.

A demonic beast of this level was on the same level as little black. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Back then, Qin Yu had spent a lot of effort to deal with little black.

“The underwater world is rarely developed. No one knows how many unknown demonic beasts are hidden under the sea,”Kong Yun said coldly from the side.

Then, he stepped forward as if he wanted to fight alongside Chang Mang.

However, Chang Mang rejected his good intentions. He shook his thick arm and said coldly, “Go to the side and make a fire. Tonight, we’ll eat the meat of this beast.”

“Chang Mang, don’t underestimate this Azure Dragon Shark. Demonic beasts are stronger than humans of the same level, not to mention that this is an Earth rank demonic beast,”Yao Meng reminded him.

Chang mang snorted coldly, “I don’t Care What Kind of demonic beast it is. I’ll tear it apart in a moment!”

The old man in the air couldn’t help but sneer, “Ignorant child, arrogant and conceited. Today, I’ll let you know the power of the Azure Dragon Shark!”

With that, the old man muttered, as if he had given some orders to this azure dragon shark.

In an instant, the Azure Dragon Shark’s arms shook, rolling up a hundred thousand feet sea wave!

Yao Meng and the others quickly used their spells to stabilize the ship, preventing it from capsizing.

Gong Tianyu and the others took this opportunity to roll into the room.

They lay on the window, shivering as they looked at the huge demonic beast outside in fear.

“What is this thing? How can there be such a monster in the world...”Gong Tianyu swallowed his saliva, no longer showing any arrogance.

“Such a big monster, only Ultraman can defeat it...”a weirdo beside him muttered.

...

Outside, Chang Mang’s entire body was emitting a blood-red light. His body that was like an iron tower appeared extremely tiny in front of the Azure Dragon Shark.

However, this seemingly tiny body contained a destructive power!

Chang Mang let out an angry roar and rose up from the ground. His body turned into a blood-red light and charged towards the azure dragon shark!

Chang Mang was born in a humble family and did not go through any advanced studies. He did not have any top-notch spells. What he relied on was his fierce physical body and that violent strength!

The blood-red fist arrived in front of the Azure Dragon Shark almost in an instant!

“Die for me!”Blue veins bulged on Chang Mang’s arms, like a cage.

The overwhelming power was unparalleled in the world, and the dazzling red light exploded on the body of the Azure Dragon Shark!

“Boom!”

With this punch, the body of the azure dragon shark suddenly shook violently, and then it fell into the sea fiercely, raising huge waves!

Yao Meng and the others couldn’t help but gape, their faces full of astonishment.

The power of this punch was too terrifying!

“This kid... is really a tiger.”Even Kong Yun could not help but sigh.

“The reputation of the holy body is indeed well-deserved,”Yao Meng said in a low voice.

Chang Mang’s physical strength alone was probably not weaker than Qin Yu!

The old man was also slightly surprised. He snorted and said, “He has some ability.”

In the next second, the azure dragon shark suddenly exploded from the bottom of the sea! Two huge arms fiercely grabbed at Chang Mang!

“F * ck you!”Chang Mang did not use too many moves and raised his hand to punch!

His fist that was the size of a casserole was not worth mentioning in front of the blue dragon shark’s huge palm.

But it was this tiny fist that directly pushed back the blue dragon shark’s arm by a few degrees!

“Die for me!”Chang Mang’s mouth roared repeatedly. His feet stepped on red light and once again charged at the Blue Dragon Shark.

Chang Mang actually planned to fight this azure dragon shark in close combat!

He jumped onto the Azure Dragon Shark’s head, clenched his fist, and swung.

For a moment, the sounds of banging rang out incessantly, causing everyone to cry out in alarm!

No one had expected that Chang Mang was actually so powerful!

After a few punches, the azure dragon shark seemed to have been enraged.

Its entire body emitted a dazzling light, and sharp spikes appeared on its body!

The spikes came too fast, and even Chang Mang didn’t have time to react.

His body was instantly pierced through by the spikes, and blood gushed out!

“F * ck you!”Chang Mang cursed angrily. He slammed his palm on the head of the Azure Dragon Shark, and his body suddenly exploded.

The azure dragon shark seized the opportunity. It opened its bloody mouth and swallowed Chang Mang!

“Chang Mang!”Seeing this, Kong Yun and the others’faces changed greatly!

“Hahaha!”From the inside, they couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“You’re Laughing Your Ass Off!”However, before he could laugh twice, he heard Chang Mang’s rude abuse.

Looking Up, he saw Chang Mang’s two arms forcefully open the black dragon shark’s mouth!

“How is this possible!”The old man’s expression couldn’t help but change when he saw this!

One had to know that the black dragon shark’s bite force was extremely strong, even a huge mountain could be crushed in an instant!

But at this moment, the black dragon shark’s mouth was actually forcefully opened by Chang Mang!

This was simply innate godly strength!

Even Yao Meng and the others were dumbstruck!

“So this is the holy body, a talent that can be seen with the naked eye.”Kong Yun couldn’t help but sigh.

Before everyone could regain their senses, Chang Mang suddenly threw a punch at the huge teeth of the azure dragon shark!

“Crack!”

The teeth that were like steel blades were instantly smashed into pieces by the punch!

“I’ll let you bite me, today I’ll break your dog teeth for you!”Chang Mang seemed to have gone mad. He hugged the teeth of the azure dragon shark and used his arms to forcefully pull out the teeth of the Azure Dragon Shark!
