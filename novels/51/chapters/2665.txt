At this moment, Jing Xin and Ling’er looked at each other. Their expressions suddenly became very ugly as if they had sensed something through the magical artifact in the sect.

At the same time, a sharp flute sound rang out in the sect.

The voice sounded faintly, bringing with it an ominous internal qi.

“It looks like we can’t suppress them anymore. We just received news that the ancient demons in the sect have broken free from the suppression. They are now completely erupting. They are wantonly slaughtering the disciples of the Demon Sealing Valley and ordinary people in the secular world. Ling’er, take Qin Yu to the Treasure Repository Pavilion. I must return to the sect immediately and unite with my fellow disciples to eliminate those ancient demons as soon as possible.”

Jing Xin’s expression was a little ugly although the Saint Power here was withdrawn.

However, there were still many powerful Demon Sealing Formations in the Demon Sealing Valley. They had originally estimated that it would take some time for the demons to break through, but they did not expect them to break through so quickly.

Ling’er nodded somewhat anxiously. She grabbed Qin Yu’s hand and suddenly leaped up.

The speed of the Wings of Clear Winds was increased to the extreme. In nearly an hour, they arrived at an ancient hall.

“Qin Yu, go in by yourself. Bear in mind what Senior Sister and I said. Don’t anger Elder MO Wen inside.”

Ling’er warned Qin Yu again with a serious expression.

“Understood. Thank you, Miss Ling’er.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and retracted the Wings of Clear Winds.

His body leaped down from the sky and slowly walked into the entrance of the seven-level-tall hall.

Just as he entered, Qin Yu felt a deathly stillness. Not even a trace of sound could be heard.

In the huge hall, countless magical artifacts were casually thrown on the ground.

In the corner, an old man with long eyebrows had his eyes closed. It was unknown whether he was dozing off or doing something.

“Elder MO, I’m here to exchange for some magical artifacts. Elder Xinyue should have mentioned this.”

Upon seeing the old man, Qin Yu hurriedly bowed slightly and said respectfully.

However, the old man did not react at all, leaving Qin Yu stunned on the spot.

Qin Yu didn’t care and maintained this posture. It was better to be polite.

After a long time, the old man’s brows twitched slightly. Then, he raised his turbid eyes and stared at Qin Yu. “They’re all here. Take your pick.”

Only then did Qin Yu begin to choose.

However, the quality was not low. Qin Yu felt that it was a little too much after just sensing them for a moment.

He sensed these weapons with his divine sense. Most of these weapons had the internal qi of a blacksmith. All kinds of descriptions and names were displayed in these internal qi. He could roughly understand them after sensing them.

The Brocade Feather Lamp had ten powerful ancient demons sealed within it. During the battle, it could light up the demonic qi of the ancient demons and extract their power to attack.

The Yin Mei Qin was embedded with four inner cores of demonic beasts. It had four different attributes. During the battle, it could activate the power of the inner cores to increase the strength of the people fighting around it. It was a divine artifact that could increase strength.

The Chaotic Star Saber was covered with formation marks that looked like stars. Its appearance was dazzling like shining stars. There were extremely powerful attack arrays carved on it. It was a saber-type weapon with extremely high attack power. However, the saber could not withstand this energy, and thus the number of uses was limited.

The names of the weapons kept appearing in Qin Yu’s mind. Although these weapons did not seem to be of much use to him, the various creative ideas of smithing magical artifacts surprised him.

These were no longer incomplete weapons from the lower realm, but truly forged magical artifacts.

Moreover, these magical artifacts should have been forged not too long ago judging from the internal qi surrounding them. Otherwise, the aura would have dissipated long ago.

However, these weapons were not of much use to him now.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. There should be more magical artifacts here. He walked around the entire hall.

Looking at the spiral staircase, there were indeed other areas.

Qin Yu was overjoyed and went up the stairs to the second floor.

The Dharma Treasures in the spcnnd floor were emitting a hotter glow They

were obviously much stronger than the magical artifacts on the first floor.

However, the magic artifacts here still did not catch Qin Yu’s eye.

It was very simple. These weapons were inferior to the Tiger Wing in his hands, so there was no need to exchange for them at all.

Unless he could increase his strength, or else it would be a waste of Elder Xinyue’s Dao points.

On the third and fourth levels, the area became narrower and narrower, and the number of magical artifacts placed on each level also decreased. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, the quality of these magical artifacts had improved visibly. There were already many weapons that shocked Qin Yu when he reached the fourth level. If he could get them, it would also improve him a little.

However, Qin Yu still wanted to continue advancing and see what else was behind them for comparison.

Based on the current situation, the quality would only get higher and higher.

The fifth level!

Qin Yu stared at this area with a burning gaze and then stepped up the stairs without hesitation.

On the ground floor, a spirit stared at the old man with a strange smile.

“Old man, you’re something. Why didn’t you tell him that he can’t go up to the fifth and sixth floors? This is a rule set by Dan himself.” “He is not a disciple of our sect. Why should I tell him?”

MO Wen said calmly.

“Haha! How cruel!”

The spirit said with a strange laugh.

At this moment, a few people suddenly stepped into the Treasure Repository Pavilion.

Gu Tian, Hua Tian, and a woman with an outstanding temperament. “Someone is in the Treasure Repository Pavilion now. Come tomorrow.”

MO Wen waved his hand, and a wave of power was already released from his sleeve, wanting to chase them out.

“Elder MO, I am Elder Gu Yi’s disciple. This is my master’s token.”

Gu Tian quickly said and handed over a token.

“Go in.”

MO Wen said indifferently when he saw the token.

He was acquainted with Gu Yi. Seeing that Gu Tian was Gu Yi’s disciple, he simply let him in.

“Elder MO, this is Hua Tian, who was personally appointed by Valley Master Dan. He was asked to enter the Treasure Repository Pavilion and pick a random artifact. Elder MO, please allow him to do so. Now that the Ancient Demon Land has completely erupted, the demons in the Demon Sealing Valley have begun to wreak havoc and slaughter our disciples.”

Seeing MO Wen’s unwillingness, Gu Tian, who knew MO Wen’s personality, quickly spoke up again.

“Elder MO, this man has killed countless ancient demons in the Ancient Demon Land. He even killed Molou Shura. That’s why the sect leader sent him to the Treasure Repository Pavilion.”

“Killed Molou Shura?”

MO Wen raised his cloudy eyes and stared at Hua Tian in confusion.

“Yes, Elder Mo. Please take a look. This is Molou Shura’s prayer beads bracelet, but it belongs to me now.”

Hua Tian laughed and took out a string of prayer beads.

Elder MO revealed a cold smile, although his face was still full of disdain..
