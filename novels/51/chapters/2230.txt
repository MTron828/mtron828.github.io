2231 Movement in the Holy Region

The bones in Qin Yu’s palm slowly grew again, and a layer of gas containing tremendous demonic qi stuck to Qin Yu’s bones. In the next moment, a new layer of skin formed.

A layer of dense green demonic qi containing tremendous vital energy circulated between the periosteum and the skin.

But soon, the demonic qi of the bone cultivation water in the medicinal cauldron was absorbed by Qin Yu.

With a single claw thrust, a sharp piercing sound tore through the air, causing the space to tremble.

With another two claw thrusts, a stream of air current gushed out from the Sumeru ring and pierced through space with just the strength of his physical body.

“This bone cultivation water really has the effect of strengthening the bones and skin!”

Qin Yu said somewhat ecstatically.

“The chaotic body is truly extraordinary. The demonic power of the Bone Cultivation River is something that human cultivators can’t accept. A long time ago, a human cultivator forcefully used bone cultivation water to refine his body. His consciousness was invaded, and he became a beast in the end.”

Looking at Qin Yu’s hand, Elder Guai exclaimed.

“I must think of a way to go to the Bone Cultivation River at the seventh level.”

Qin Yu said with his brows furrowed.

“The demonic beasts in the seventh level of purgatory have their own rules, and the strong prey on the weak. Only the strong are worthy of the Bone Cultivation River. The amount of bone cultivation water flowing out every day is fixed. The stronger the demon beasts, the more advantageous terrain they would occupy. Once human cultivators step in, they will be surrounded and attacked.”

Elder Guai had been to the seventh level of purgatory before so he knew its rule quite well.

“Is there no other way?” Qin Yu had a headache.

“Previously, there were human cultivators who entered the seventh level. They had a quick fight at the edge and used special containers to take away some bone cultivation water, but basically, it’s impossible to cultivate there.”

Elder Guai thought about it carefully for a while but still shook his head.

…

In the Si family of the Holy Region.

Si Shiyue was floating in the air, his long hair moving without wind blowing.

He completely unleashed his spiritual energy at this moment, and strands of wind force gently supported him.

And then, with the power of fire, the surrounding air seemed to have turned into fuel, and a raging fire broke out within dozens of meters.

The power of gold! He was fully focused, and suddenly, his arm transformed into a divine weapon!

Several different elements were flowing wildly, and the space occasionally exploded violently.

However, Ji Shiyu was calm and composed as if he had become the master of different elements.

…

Outside the Mystic Realm, Si Wujue and Si Liuhe exchanged a glance. They could see the shock in each other’s eyes.

“It’s indeed the Way of Five Elements! If he could comprehend the complete Way of Five Elements, practically no one would be Shiyue’s match in the future!”

Si Liuhe nodded.

“If he can comprehend the complete Way of Five Elements, coupled with my Si family’s bloodline, I think the Yan family will no longer object to the marriage of Shiyue and Yan Ruoxue.”

The family head Si Wujue clenched his fists.” With the bloodline of Immortal Emperor Tianming, a walking Tribulation Transcending Sage cultivator will be born among the younger generation of my Si family!”

Meanwhile, in Demon-slaying Peak, Dean Lei’s hair was messy, and his beard was missing by more than half.

“Stinky old man, I don’t care. I must go to the Black Platform Continent.”

Jue Wu angrily said.

This time, for the first time, Dean Lei did not reject Jue Wu. He was silent for a long time before he said.

Are you sure you want to go? Once you go, you might never come back.”

Jue Wu hesitated for a moment but quickly nodded with determination.

“Go and prepare to bid farewell to the senior and junior brothers of Demon-slaying Peak.”

Dean Lei sighed.

“Are you finally willing to let go?”

Flower Granny revealed a rare smile.

“Keeping her here is harming her. Her state of mind has been unstable lately, and her cultivation has completely stopped.”

Dean Lei smiled bitterly.

“Don’t worry. There’s still a chance to return from that land of exile.”

Flower Granny shook her head.

“It’s almost impossible to teleport here from a low-grade galaxy. The energy required is too great.” Dean Lei shook his head.

“There is a Mystic Realm in the ninth level of purgatory, and the other exit is in the Holy Region.”

Flower Granny said indifferently.

“You mean the Mystic Realm left behind by that person…”

Dean Lei’s face revealed a hint of fear. He smiled bitterly and said.

“Then I’d rather Qin Yu and the others not reach there. At least they can keep their lives.”

“Don’t underestimate this kid. He’s a person who can create miracles.”

Flower Granny left behind these words, and her body disappeared.

…

At this moment, Qin Yu had arrived at the Black Platform Continent.

When he parted ways with the man with the mustache, they had agreed on a time to gather.

The man with the mustache was very concerned about the genius who could set up the nine trigrams of destiny.

“D*mn, my friend. You’ve made me wait!”

The man with the mustache sensed the teleportation markdown he had left for Qin Yu. Not long after Qin Yu arrived at the Black Platform Continent, he appeared before him.

“Shh!”

Qin Yu felt a headache.

“There’s an incredibly powerful half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator here. My spiritual soul was almost killed by him!”

Thinking of Xing Xiu’s terrifying strength, Qin Yu still had lingering fear in his heart. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What? The Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator is going against the Path of Heaven. Once they forcefully attack, they will suffer the backlash of the Path of Heaven. He probably can only send out a True Saint clone to kill you, but you might not be able to resist it. You’re indeed a pervert!”

The man with the mustache was a little surprised.

Qin Yu suddenly understood why Xing Xiu did not kill him in the end.

It seemed that it was because he used the power of the tribulation and had caused the Path of Heaven to appear.

“F*ck, how did you know a bit of everything? Where did you come from?”

Qin Yu became even more curious about the man with the mustache.

“I am, of course, the reincarnation of an ancient mighty realm cultivator. You should respect me a little. Brat, you always think of scheming me!”

The man with the mustache stroked his beard with his fingers, looking like a master.

The two walked toward the valley where Wang Feng was. Qin Yu took the opportunity to ask him some of his doubts.

“The man with the mustache, you said the Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators are not allowed by the Path of Heaven. Does that mean the True Saint Realm is the peak of this world? Or does it mean after entering the Tribulation Transcending Stage, one could only suppress his realm? In that case, how did Immortal Emperor, Demon Emperor, and Monster Emperor derive?”

“The Path of Heaven and Great Dao are constantly changing in the Chaotic Universe. Take prior the Golden Age of the Holy Region as an example. No one could reach the True Saint Realm. It’s the same for Tribulation Transcending Stage. When the Path of Heaven descends, you can become a walking Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator of the Path of Heaven if you can seize the opportunity. Your attacks will not suffer a backlash before the rules of this Path of Heaven change.”

The man with the mustache explained in detail to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded. Regardless of Solitary Cloud City or the Black Platform Continent, those few with powerful divine senses seemed to be the Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators who had descended from the Great Dao. Even so, their formidable power still made Qin Yu’s heart palpitate.
