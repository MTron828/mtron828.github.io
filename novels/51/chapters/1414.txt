Chapter 1415: Chapter 1,415, the powerful sect master of the Tianyun sect

This voice was rather cold, as if it came from the mouth of a youth.

Zhao Feng was stunned at first, then he suddenly turned his head and looked at that man.

He saw that this man had a slender figure and a delicate face. There was a faint killing intent and a hint of maturity between his brows.

This kind of temperament was definitely not something that could be deliberately disguised. It was a temperament that was naturally emitted after killing countless people and experiencing the vicissitudes of time.

His height was about 1.9 meters, and his long robe covered his body. The coldness in his eyes caused Zhao Feng’s entire body to tremble.

“Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master!”Zhao Feng cried out in surprise. In the next second, he hurriedly bowed and said, “Greetings, Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master...”

“Sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”Upon hearing this address, everyone’s expression could not help but change drastically!

“He actually came personally?”

“Oh no, I’m afraid brother Qin won’t be able to escape this time!”

Qin Yu’s expression was also somewhat ugly. He did not expect that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect would actually come personally!

“Sect master, why didn’t you greet me when you came? I can make arrangements...”Zhao Feng lowered his head and his body trembled slightly.

The sect master looked down at Zhao Feng in front of him and continued, “Let me ask you, when did I need to give you face?”

Zhao Feng’s body trembled again and he hurriedly said, “Sect master, I was spouting nonsense just now. Please don’t mind...”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and his head spun rapidly.

“I have to escape quickly!”Qin Yu said in his heart.

He took advantage of the time when the sect master was negotiating with Zhao Feng to run away!

However, the moment he stood up, he realized that his legs seemed to be filled with lead, and he couldn’t move at all!

“Qin Yu, do you think you can escape?”The sect master looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu tried to struggle, but he found that he couldn’t escape at all.

As expected, the sect master’s strength was far above that of the first elder!

Since he couldn’t escape, Qin Yu didn’t waste any more effort.

He simply sat down again and sized the sect master up and said, “The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? This is the second time we’ve met. Oh, no, with that projection, it should be the third time.”

The sect master smiled coldly and said, “You’re quite calm.”

“So what if I’m not calm.”Qin Yu shook his head.

The sect master slowly walked towards Qin Yu. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Qin Yu.

Zhao Feng took this opportunity to run away.

The people in the room didn’t dare to stay any longer and fled.

Soon, only Qin Yu and the sect master were left in the huge restaurant.

“Qin Yu, you killed Ling Yun. I Won’t hold it against you. Not only did you not appreciate my kindness, but you also killed my son and heavily injured the Great Elder.”The sect master’s voice gradually turned cold.

“Do you really not take my Tianyun sect seriously?”

Qin Yu suppressed his anger and said, “I’m very sorry for killing your son, but he deliberately provoked me. I tolerated him time and time again, but he didn’t restrain himself and attacked me! “Furthermore, I didn’t want to kill him at all. Who knew that he was so weak?”

The sect master’s expression turned cold as he said, “In that case, do you still blame me?”

“Do you feel that you are not responsible? Why Don’t you look after your son? Also, why don’t you teach him how to respect others?”Qin Yu shouted.

“I have already guessed from the words of others. Your son usually doesn’t leave the heavenly cloud sect. It must be because of your excessive protection as a father that he doesn’t understand the outside world at all. That’s why he came to me and shouted at me.”

“Do you think you’re not responsible? Do you really think that your excessive protection is a good thing for him?”

The sect master frowned slightly. Qin Yu’s words seemed to have hit the nail on the head.

“No matter what, you killed him. You must be responsible,”the sect master said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu sneered, “How do you want me to be responsible? Do you want me to pay with my life?”

“Or what?”The sect master asked coldly.

“Obediently follow me back. It’s time to end everything.”

Qin Yu sneered, “Do you think I will just sit and wait for death?”

As she spoke, Qin Yu’s divine power surged and instantly shattered this restraint!

In the next second, Qin Yu’s hand clenched into a golden fist and headed straight for the sect master!

That powerful force blew up the sect master’s long hair, but her face remained calm. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just as Qin Yu’s fist was about to land on his body, the sect master suddenly stretched out her hand.

That seemingly ordinary palm actually grabbed Qin Yu’s fist.

What shocked Qin Yu even more was that all of his strength had been dissipated at this moment!

“How is this possible!”Qin Yu was instantly shocked!

He hurriedly retreated.

That punch just now, Qin Yu had used almost all of her strength, but it was easily dissolved by him!

Qin Yu had guessed that the sect master was extremely powerful, but he had not expected him to be this powerful!

“Something’s Wrong!”Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat ugly.

Since the sect master of the Tianyun sect had such strength, why did he have to give Wen Wanli face back then?

With the abilities he had displayed, he was clearly far above Wen Wanli! He was afraid that even absolute dance would not be able to contend against him!

“Don’t waste your energy,”the sect master said.

“If I wanted to kill you, you would have already become a corpse.”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and could not help but ask, “What level are you at exactly? Could it be that you have already stepped into the return to Void Stage?”

The sect master shook his head and said, “Don’t ask so many questions. Follow me back.”

With that said, the sect master extended his palm, and a huge force instantly bound Qin Yu.

Qin Yu knew that he couldn’t escape from the sect master’s palm, so he simply stopped struggling.

He took a deep breath and said, “It was my mistake to fall into your hands today. I admit defeat. I’ll go back with you.”

“That’s for the best. You can also suffer less,”said the sect master.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and acted as if he was at the mercy of the sect master.

The sect master didn’t say anything. He turned around and left with Qin Yu.

This place wasn’t too far from the Heavenly Cloud Sect, and the sect master was extremely fast.

In the evening of the same day, Qin Yu was brought back to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The sect master brought Qin Yu all the way to the hall. Then, he took out a dharma treasure and bound Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu has been captured!”

The entire sect quickly spread the news. Soon, many people surrounded the entrance of the main hall.

The first elder, who was lying on the bed half-dead, sat up as if he had just come back from the dead after hearing the news.

He came all the way to the main hall. When he saw Qin Yu tied up, the first elder’s face was gloomy.

“Little Bastard, you’re finally caught back.”The great elder gritted his teeth and said this.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I was indeed caught back, but the one who caught me wasn’t you. What’s wrong with having a defeated opponent like you?”

“You’re courting death!”The great elder immediately flew into a rage. However, his injuries had yet to recover, so he didn’t act rashly.

“Alright.”

At this moment, the sect master spoke.

He said coldly, “Gather everyone for a meeting.”

The great elder hurriedly nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll go right now. I’ll go right now.”
