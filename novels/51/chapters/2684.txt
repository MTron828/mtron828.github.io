Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, countless people had already noticed this change. In an instant, they took advantage of the weakening of the barrier.

It was unknown how many people had just entered the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

“What happened? How did that dwarf get in? Could it be that the Saint

Kingdom’s barrier has lost its energy?”

A huge Ox-Head noticed this scene and rushed into the place where the dwarf had just entered.

Before he could get close to the barrier, a force had turned him into nothingness.

The people around who were eager to try suddenly shivered to see this, and no one dared to continue trying.

Meanwhile, Qin Yu, who had turned into nothingness, was experiencing an extremely strange journey.

When his divine soul reached its peak, he felt his divine soul being separated.

His three souls and seven spirits were sucked in by an inexplicable force. His vision was dazzled.

prom me moment ne was Dorn, all me Images m ms memory appearea m ms 360-degree range.

As more and more images appeared, they were compressed to a very small extent.

Then, those images were deleted one by one. As these images were deleted, he seemed to have lost many important memories.

However, this kind of change could not be stopped. Even if Qin Yu did his best to raise all the power of his divine soul, he still could not stop it.

His pupils began to turn blank.

His three souls and seven spirits floated up uncontrollably after all the pictures were deleted by the force. In an instant, he had traveled through countless planes.

He saw that he was close to the edge of the Saint Kingdom. He could even see that the barrier was covered with powerful runes.

Among his three souls, the three Hearts of Saint Kingdom lit up with a dazzling light.

A huge suction force was emitted in the vast Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, wanting to pull Qin Yu’s divine soul back.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who possessed three Hearts of Saint Kingdom, was already like the Lord of a portion of the kingdom. This Saint Kingdom was destined to protect Qin Yu’s divine soul.

However, this Saint Kingdom’s power could not stop the other power for even a moment.

His divine soul was pulled out of the Saint Kingdom, and the three Hearts of Saint Kingdom slowly floated back.

Qin Yu’s three souls and seven spirits had drifted for an unknown period and passed through countless planes.

He saw 500 vast worlds of saints. This world was even bigger than he had imagined.

The eighteen divine kingdoms were located in the center of the entire Saint Realm. The power of the lower realm was absorbed into the Saint Realm and then into the Saint Kingdom, forming a cycle.

All of a sudden, he felt his divine soul tremble violently as if it were passing through a thick and huge barrier.

This barrier was so thick that Qin Yu did not know how long he had been floating around. Even his three souls and seven spirits felt an irresistible great sleepiness.

He slowly closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep. He did not know how long it took for him to wake up. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When he opened his eyes, he found that he was being pulled. Even if he tried his best, he could not resist this force at all.

Moreover, he could no longer see anything at this moment.

It was a feeling of complete nothingness. This feeling simply made him panic.

All of a sudden, a power surged in one of Qin Yu’s souls.

In the next second, an eye suddenly opened on his forehead.

As the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze opened, a huge golden light appeared in front of him.

The scene in front was reflected in Qin Yu’s eyes. It was just truly a space.

Qin Yu floated in the endless void. As his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze condensed, countless black holes of different sizes slowly rotated.

At this moment, his three souls and seven spirits had separated at some point.

He could faintly sense his soul body, but that connection was extremely weak. It was as if there was a long distance between them.

One of his souls passed through countless black holes in a second before continuing to another place.

Suddenly, he seemed to sense something.

When he turned around, he saw a huge person staring at him.

It seemed to be a statue.

Above his head, an extremely dazzling diamond-shaped divinity emitted a dazzling light.

Even though the statue did not move, Qin Yu felt an extreme fury.

Along the way, Qin Yu did not leave the boundary of this statue. It seemed that this statue directly penetrated the entire universe.

After a tremor, Qin Yu saw another god.

In this space, he found many living beings around the god.

However, these living beings were like statues. They extended into the distance in a straight line.

The three-dimensional lines of these creatures were both long and short. Some were closely spaced and some were very loose. Every one of them looked different.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze seemed to be able to absorb endless power.

He suddenly zoomed in and realized that this line was the axis of time that ran through the living being.

The end of the long line represented the end of his life.

Each picture was not motionless. However, this turbulence seemed to be stagnant in front of this huge axis.

“God’s Space?

Qin Yu muttered.

He patted his head in frustration. There was a sharp voice in his sea of consciousness.

This voice made him feel very annoyed. After an unknown period, Qin Yu fell asleep again.

He had already forgotten why he was here. He was like a newborn baby. When he was sleepy, he would sleep. When he woke up, he would look around curiously. When he was tired, he would sleep again. This cycle repeated for an unknown amount of time.

The sharp voice in his sea of consciousness that hadn’t changed was getting louder and louder. It was so loud that he couldn’t sleep.

But today, Qin Yu suddenly felt uneasy.

At the end of the universe in God’s Space, he suddenly saw a familiar yet unfamiliar person.

A familiar feeling rose in his heart. This person seemed to be him. Why was he here?

Qin Yu was at the end of this person’s time axis. He saw that pair of confused eyes.

At this moment, the figure coincidentally corresponded with him. This was the end of his path. After that, there was no longer him on the time axis.

An extreme sense of panic immediately surged into Qin Yu’s heart. It was a sense of danger that was about to be destroyed.

At this moment, he finally heard the sharp voice. It was a voice that he was extremely familiar with. It was his father’s voice.

“Qin Yu, wake up!”
