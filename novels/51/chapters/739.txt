Chapter 740: Tang Mo VS Granny Qin Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A terrifying qi energy spread out in all directions with Qin Yu as the center.

Sensing the extremely cold killing intent on Qin Yu’s body, everyone’s expressions couldn’t help but change.

“As expected of Qin Yu. He really lives up to his reputation,” someone said with a cold snort.

“To be able to give the Jingdu Martial Arts Association a headache, he is naturally not an ordinary person.”

“I would like to fight him first!” Someone snorted coldly and raised his hand to grab Qin Yu’s head!

Qin Yu glanced at him, quickly clenched his fist, and suddenly smashed it over!

Waves of golden fist light blotted out the sky and covered the sun, like a golden sun that blotted out the sky and covered the earth!

“Boom!”

The instant the fists collided, the attacking Martial Marquis was sent flying.

The bones of his hand were instantly broken, and the force of the force caused his chest to collapse!

“Pu!”

The attacker spat out a mouthful of blood. He wanted to get up, but his chest had completely shattered!

It would probably take some time for him to recover!

Seeing this, everyone couldn’t help but gasp.

Just one punch had crippled a Martial Marquis. What kind of strength was this?

“A mere early-stage Martial Marquis is naturally not worth mentioning.” Someone stood out.

This person was short in stature, but his internal qi was extremely powerful!

“Peak-stage Martial Marquis!” Qin Yu frowned after sensing the qi energy from his body.

Who knew how many peak-stage Martial Marquis were hidden among these people?

The peak-stage Martial Marquis was an existence that Qin Yu was completely unable to deal with.

“Everyone, let’s attack together.” At this time, someone suggested.

“Ten-thousand-year-old herbs can appear at any time. Don’t waste time.”

Before he finished speaking, everyone took a step forward.

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. He took a deep breath and prepared for a great battle.

“Let’s see who dares to move!”

At this moment, a familiar voice sounded!

Turning his head, he saw Tang Mo alighting from a rolls-royce.

Behind him, there were more than ten cars.

The moment the cars stopped, more than twenty people alighted from the cars.

One, two, three... there were more than twenty people, and all of them were in the Martial Marquis Realm!

Tang Mo led his men and swaggered over.

He stood beside Qin Yu, then swept his gaze across the crowd and said, “Let’s see who dares to move!”

“Young Master Tang? Isn’t the Tang family not participating in this matter?” Someone asked.

Tang Mo sneered and said, “It’s true that our family won’t participate in this matter, but my father said that we will help Qin Yu obtain this stalk of herbs.”

“Strictly speaking, we are now Qin Yu’s people.”

When the crowd saw this, they immediately gave up.

This was Tang City, and no one was willing to offend the Tang family here.

“I’m not late, am I?” Tang Mo said with a smile.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “You came at the right time.”

Everyone subconsciously took a step back. The person who had planned to make a move just now also gave up on the idea.

“No wonder this guy is so arrogant. It turns out that he received assistance from the Tang family,” Song Shan, who was not far away, couldn’t help but snort coldly.

Ancestor Guan couldn’t help but frown, and his face had a hint of unwillingness.

“Young Master Tang, is it?” At this moment, Granny Qin took a step forward.

She put her hands behind her back and said, “I am a member of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. If you are willing to leave, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely remember your favor.”

Tang Mo glared fiercely at Granny Qin and said, “Old b*stard, I am not interested in this bullsh*t ten-thousand-year-old herbs at all. My purpose here is to deal with you, this old b*stard.”

“Looking down on my family? What did you call us that day? F * ck you!”

“What Jingdu Martial Arts Association? F * ck that association. What does it have to do with me? Old b*stard, sooner or later, I’ll skin you!”

After holding back his anger for a few days, Tang Mo finally spat it out in one breath. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Granny Qin’s expression was as ugly.

She looked coldly at Tang Mo and said through gritted teeth, “Little b*stard, do you know who you are talking to?!”

“I do. I’m talking with an old b*stard who thinks she is especially powerful, an old monkey,” Tang Mo snorted lightly.

Upon hearing this, Granny Qin could no longer hold it in.

The internal qi on her body exploded without her realizing it. The internal qi of a peak-stage Martial Marquis instantly swept through the entire place!

As an important figure of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Granny Qin’s strength didn’t need to be said.

Among those of the same level, Granny Qin was almost unmatched!

After sensing Granny Qin’s internal qi, everyone’s expressions couldn’t help but change.

“As expected of someone from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.” Someone was speechless.

Granny Qin looked coldly at Tang Mo and said, “Little b*stard, so what if you are a member of the Tang family? Do you really think I’m afraid of you?!”

The more than twenty Martial Marquises around Tang Mo quickly took a step forward and stood in front of Tang Mo..

“Go ahead and try!” Tang Mo snorted coldly.

Then, Tang Mo waved his hand.

A folding fan appeared out of thin air in his hand.

This folding fan looked ordinary, but there was an internal qi lingering around it.

“Martial Saint Weapon!” When everyone saw this folding fan, they couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

The Tang family not only brought over twenty Martial Marquises, but they even brought out a Martial Saint Weapon!

Just how terrifying was the Tang family’s foundation?

Granny Qin’s expression was also somewhat unsightly.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association didn’t lack a Martial Saint Weapon, but on this trip, Granny Qin didn’t bring any at all.

“Come, see if I can beat you to death with a fan!” Tang Mo shouted.

Although Granny Qin was extremely angry, she knew that now was not a good time to make a move.

She could only blame herself for belittling the Tang family. Otherwise, this wouldn’t have happened.

“Hmph, the Tang family, right? I’ll remember it.” Granny Qin took a deep breath and turned around to leave.

Tang Mo continued to shout, “Old b*stard, you better leave Tang City quickly, or I’ll smash your face into pieces!”

Granny Qin couldn’t contain her anger. In just a short day, she had already been called an “old b*stard” by many people.

She was an important figure of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but now, she was being insulted by a few juniors. She naturally couldn’t bear it?

“Granny Qin, there’s no need to offend the Tang family,” Chou Heguang said.

“Tang Mo is here to help Qin Yu, and Qin Yu’s route is different from ours, so there’s no need to worry.”

Granny Qin nodded, and then said, “Master Chou, is there any problem with the location you deduced?”

“Of course there’s no problem!” Chou Heguang said with a nonchalant smile.

“Granny Qin, you can rest assured.”

Granny Qin nodded and said, “If we get the ten-thousand-year-old herbs this time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely hire you as a professional treasure hunter.”

Upon hearing this, Chou Heguang was immediately overjoyed and said, “Thank you, Granny Qin!”

Everyone followed beside Granny Qin, while Tang Mo stood on Qin Yu’s side.

“It’s all thanks to you this time. I will remember this favor,” Qin Yu said.

Tang Mo waved his hand and said, “Our family has always kept our word!”

Qin Yu nodded and then said, “It’s time for us to set off too.”

Tang Mo waved his hand and said, “Let’s set off!”
