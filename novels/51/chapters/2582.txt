Chapter 2583: Driving Beast Away

“I can smell your soul from far away. Are you satisfied with this gift today?”

“The dog of the Qi family head!”

Qin Yu’s eye expression instantly turned cold.

He slowly accelerated and charged toward Ji Tianming.

Based on what Ji Tianming had said, he should have added the Saint power of the souls he had killed to his nose. Therefore, his nose was very sensitive and could even capture his location.

This also explained why the 30 Lightning Leopards group assaulted him.

However, Qin Yu had yet to discover how Ji Tianming controlled these Lightning Leopards.

Qin Yu fixed his gaze on Ji Tianming.

“In that case, Ji Tianming’s combat strength is definitely not stronger than mine. This is proven by the distance between Ji Tianming and me when he appeared.”

This was the body’s combat reaction, like Faint Radiance and Demonic Flame, the two demonic cultivators.

The moment they saw him, they immediately surrounded Qin Yu. It was a completely different battle reaction.

“Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap!”

The surroundings were deadly silent, and only the crisp sound of Qin Yu stepping on the slightly soft ground could be heard.

Ji Tianming did not expect Qin Yu to come at him directly, and an imperceptible panic flashed across his face.

However, he quickly calmed down, and a fierce look flashed across his face.

Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze!

When Qin Yu was 100 meters away from Ji Tianming, he felt the ground tremble slightly.

Without hesitation, he activated the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze.

An enormous black bear’s afterimage appeared from the surroundings at some point.

This black bear was even faster than the Lightning Leopard. However, judging from its enormous body, its single claw would be enough to tear his body apart.

“Go to hell! This black bear is the demonic beast that ate three powerful outsiders from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect. Let’s see how you deal with it.”

A ferocious smile appeared on Ji Tianming’s face.

“Oh no, its speed is too fast!” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qin Yu stared at the black bear approaching him at high speed.

Just as its sharp claws were about to grab his body, the muscles on his legs suddenly changed. The Saint power he had absorbed from listening to the village chief’s dao lecture strengthened his legs without hesitation.

He stomped his foot fiercely, and his speed suddenly increased by 20%.

This difference in speed caused the black bear’s claw to miss him. The black bear’s enormous body fell onto the ground, and it let out a heaven-shaking roar.

He sped up again. This time, the missed attack seemed to have angered it.

“Crack!”

The black bear suddenly stomped its powerful hind legs, and its entire bear body suddenly charged toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu felt an unrivaled force ruthlessly slam onto his back.

With the attack, a surge of sweetness surged into Qin Yu’s throat. This clash with full strength broke countless bones, and he flew out uncontrollably.

“This bear king’s strength is not bad!”

Looking at Qin Yu fallen by his feet, Ji Tianming smiled sinisterly and said.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s internal qi was so dispirited after the impact of this clash. Even a Lightning Leopard could probably take his life now.

Fresh blood continued to seep out of the wound uncontrollably. Qin Yu felt his soul becoming dispirited continuously.

“Little b*stard! Let’s see if you can still laugh!”

Ji Tianming’s face was almost distorted as if he could already see Qin Yu being smashed into a meat patty by the black bear.

However, the next second, his smile suddenly froze.

Then, it immediately gnawed on the corpse on the ground.

Soon, the bear king directly swallowed the corpse on the ground into its stomach.

Ji Tianming did not even know why the black bear King turned around to attack him.

The bear’s fierce eyes swept over Qin Yu, and a hint of fear appeared in its pupils. It then turned around and fled.

Qin Yu held a bag that emitted a stinky smell in his hand, which he cut off from Ji Tianming’s waist.

“I guessed it right. This Ji family is good at raising poisonous parasites and has a profound understanding of the habits of these animals. Even in this Saint Kingdom, their expertise is useful. This bag should contain the feces of even more powerful creatures, which is why that black bear dare not continue attacking me. ”

Qin Yu moved his body with difficulty.

If his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze had not seen the bag on Ji Tianming’s body and he had bet correctly at the last moment, he might have died in Ji Tianming’s hands.

Qin Yu found a piece of cloth and tightened the muscles near the wound.

After slowing down the bleeding, he picked up a piece of firewood from the ground.

He let the burning flames burn on his chest to stop the bleeding wound.

Such a pain was nothing to Qin Yu. After stopping the wound from deteriorating, the continuous loss of Saint power of the soul slowly reduced.

“It seems that grasping some rules is the key to improving my strength in this kingdom.”

Ji Tianming could control 30 Lightning Leopards and a Black Bear King this time. It was probably relying on two inducements and that bag of feces.

Moreover, according to Ji Tianming, he was strengthening his sense of smell.

He could possess such power in just three days. Even if the Saint power of the soul doubled, he might not have been able to dodge the Black Bear King’s attack if he had not discovered the feces that could evade the black dragon’s attack.

Qin Yu seemed to have grasped something. The primitive living beings of the Saint Kingdom seemed to be a power they could use. It provided help to the outsiders.

With the ability the village chief displayed, he could directly enlighten the Confused Consciousness into consciousness.

His method was not something that outsiders like them could resist at all.

However, he was restricted by some kind of power and could not attack them. “Thank you, Brother, for saving our lives again.”

Seeing that the battle fluctuations gradually stopped, Hong Yu and the old man returned to the open space.

“Brother, let me bandage your wound. Grandpa said it will be difficult to heal if the wound is infected.”

Hong Yu leaned his round head over.

“It’s fine. I’ve roasted it with fire. It won’t get infected.” Qin Yu smiled and rubbed his little head.

“Brother, does it hurt much? Does Big Brother also care about someone, and that’s why you’re working so hard?”

Hong Yu asked curiously.

Qin Yu was stunned. He thought of Ruoxue, Flower Granny, the dean, and the peak master.

There were many more people. Some of them had already completely disappeared.

Some had come to this Saint Kingdom, and their fates remained unknown.

“Yeah, only by becoming stronger can you protect the people you care about.

He had been working hard, but this world did not seem to lack geniuses. There were not so many stories of one versus a thousand.

This included the decisive battle between Dao Mystical Saint Chen Shuang and Saint Zi Yang. He was also unable to turn things around..
