The two groups of people walked in different directions.

Qin Yu chose the southeast, while Granny Qin and the others chose the east.

Both sides seemed to think that the other party was an idiot, and the mockery on their faces was the same.

“Qin Yu, why are you walking in different directions with them?” At this moment, Song Shan and Ancestor Guan walked over.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “Because they are going in the wrong direction.”

When Song Shan heard this, he couldn’t help but sneer. “Do you really think that you are a divination master?”

“Believe it or not.” Qin Yu was too lazy to talk nonsense with them.

Song Shan and Ancestor Guan looked at each other and then snorted. “Qin Yu, this is an opportunity that you missed. If you can’t get the herbs, it’s none of our business. When the time comes, you can explain it to Ning Kun yourself!”

“Get out of here.” Qin Yu waved his hand impatiently.

The group continued to walk southeast.

During this time, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache were extremely nervous. They scanned their surroundings, looking for the location they had deduced.

Soon, the two of them stopped in front of a forest.

“This is the place,” the man with the mustache and Qin Yu said in unison.

Qin Yu looked around and found that the surroundings were normal and there was nothing special about the scenery.

“Normally, the place where the ten-thousand-year-old herbs were born should have a special scene,” Qin Yu said with a frown. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Either the trees grew exceptionally exuberant, or they were extremely decadent. However, this place was too normal, so normal that people wouldn’t even take a second look.

“You don’t understand,” the man with the mustache explained.

“According to my many years of experience, this kind of rare treasure is different from ordinary treasures. They seem to have gained consciousness and know how to hide themselves.

“Therefore, there won’t be any unusual phenomena. The purpose is to confuse everyone.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly, agreeing with the man with the mustache’s view.

“Then wait here,” said Qin Yu.

The group of more than twenty people waited here for the birth of the ten-thousand-year-old herbs.

On the other side, Granny Qin and the others had also reached their destination.

Looking at the surrounding environment, Granny Qin nodded slightly.

“The trees here are particularly luxuriant because of the spiritual energy brought by the ten-thousand-year-old herbs!” Chou Heguang said with a smile.

Everyone nodded and said, “The scenery here is indeed a little different from that of other places.”

“It seems that Master Chou is right. The ten-thousand-year-old herbs will be born here.”

Granny Qin was a little worried.

She wasn’t afraid of Qin Yu’s judgment, but she was afraid that the Tang family would have an expert guide them and find the place where the herbs were born.

Thinking of this, Granny Qin waved her hand and called a purple-robed man over.

“Go to Qin Yu’s place and see if there are any abnormalities,” Granny Qin said coldly.

The purple-robed man bowed and said, “Yes.”

Then, the purple-robed man released his divine sense and found Qin Yu’s location.

Time passed by minute by minute. Qin Yu and the others sat there and began to chat.

“Eh?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt a flash of internal qi.

Although it was only for an instant, it still couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s sharp divine sense.

“Looking for information?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and guessed the purpose.

Of course, Qin Yu wasn’t worried at all.

Because the scene here didn’t seem to have any special features to speak of.

The purple-robed man hid in the dark and swept across the scene. Then, he snorted lightly. “It’s strange that herbs can be found here!”

After saying this, the purple-robed man turned around and returned to Granny Qin’s side.

“Granny Qin, I’ve looked there. There’s nothing there,” said the purple-robed man.

“That scene is extremely ordinary. There’s no spiritual energy fluctuation. It doesn’t look like there are any signs of treasures.”

Hearing this, Granny Qin finally felt relieved.

“It seems that I overestimated the Tang family!” Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and said in a low voice.

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, it was noon.

“Why haven’t these ten-thousand-year-old herbs appeared yet?” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but grumble.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry. He slightly closed his eyes and quietly said, “Let’s wait a little longer.”

The man with the mustache anxiously scratched his ears and cheeks, but there was no other way.

At this moment, waves of medicinal fragrance spread out from Granny Qin’s position!

“Rumble...”

The entire ground suddenly shook! Numerous spider web-like cracks appeared in front of everyone!

“Herbs are about to be born!” Granny Qin said with some excitement.

It wasn’t just Granny Qin, but everyone’s hearts were raised!

“Boom!”

There was another rumble! Following that, a white radiance soared into the sky!

Even Qin Yu and the others could clearly see such a scene!

“Could it be that we are in the wrong direction?” The man with the mustache couldn’t help but frown slightly.

Qin Yu was also a little worried.

After all, this was his first time trying to deduce the heavenly secrets, so it wasn’t impossible for him to make a mistake!

“Boom!”

Eight lights flashed in the east! Then, they saw a bomb-like light explode in the air!

“Herbs!” Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and was overjoyed!

Seeing this, the crowd became even more excited. Some of them raised their feet and rushed towards the herbs!

Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and snorted. “The herbs are mine. No one can snatch them!”

Then, Granny Qin leaped up, followed closely by a few purple-robed men!

“Boom!”

Granny Qin waved her hand and killed a Martial Marquis who was blocking her way!

“Whoever dares to fight with me is an enemy of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!” Granny Qin warned.

Everyone’s expressions changed slightly, and some even gave up on the spot.

The eight purple-robed men quickly cast spells, and chains shook out of their palms!

These chains formed a huge net, blocking everyone’s path!

Granny Qin took the opportunity to raise her hand and grab the herbs!

The light dimmed, and a crystal clear herb appeared in Granny Qin’s hand.

Granny Qin fiddled with the herbs and said indifferently, “These herbs belong to me.”

Although everyone was unwilling, they didn’t dare to offend Granny Qin.

“Granny Qin, is my deduction correct?” Chou Heguang came forward and said with a smile.

Granny Qin praised, “You have some ability. Master Chou, Don’t worry. I will not go back on my promise.”

Chou Heguang quickly cupped his hands and said, “Then thank you, Granny Qin!”

Just as Granny Qin was excited, a Martial Marquis suddenly walked over from the side.

He looked at the herbs in Granny Qin’s hand and frowned. “Granny Qin, this doesn’t seem to be a ten-thousand-year-old herb.”

Granny Qin glanced at him and said, “What do you mean?”

That Martial Marquis said, “I also know a little about herbs. According to my experience, this isn’t a ten-thousand-year-old herb at all, but a five-thousand-year-old herb.”
