Chapter 173: Chuzhou Was Shaken Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s actions stunned everyone!

Not only did he beat up Jiang Yu, but he also wanted to take Jiang Yu away?

There was actually such a gutsy person in Chuzhou?

The entire hotel was silent. Everyone was stunned on the spot.

They only reacted after Qin Yu had left!

“This... This can’t be true...”

“Jiang Yu was actually taken away?”

“Qin Yu is too arrogant. I’m afraid the Jiang family will be furious this time!”

“Sigh, young people always do things without considering the consequences.”

“Just wait and see. There will be drama.”

As Qin Yu left, Mr. Wu stared at Qin Yu’s back with mixed feelings inside.

Wei Ming’s expression was also bitter. The development of the matter had far exceeded their imagination.

No one had expected Qin Yu to act in such a manner.

At this moment, Qin Yu had already stuffed Jiang Yu into the car and left.

On the way, Jiang Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, you are the most arrogant person I have ever met!”

Qin Yu ignored him and only focused on driving.

“Qin Yu, let me tell you, the Jiang family definitely won’t let you off! The Jiang family will definitely tear you into pieces!” Jiang Yu shouted at the top of his lungs.

Qin Yu raised his hand and slapped Jiang Yu’s mouth.

Jiang Yu’s mouth was instantly split open from the slap, and it was dripping with blood.

“If you babble any more nonsense, I will break your mouth and make you unable to speak for the rest of your life,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Jiang Yu felt as if a fishbone was stuck in his throat, and he didn’t dare to say a word.

Because he believed that the madman in front of him would really keep his word!

The car sped all the way, and Qin Yu brought Jiang Yu to a cemetery in the suburbs.

It was extremely cold, desolate, and uninhabited here. There wasn’t a single person within a radius of a few miles.

And after seeing the cemetery, Jiang Yu was frightened to the point of trembling!

“Qin... Qin Yu, don’t kill me. My family will definitely exchange herbs for my life...” Jiang Yu said in terror.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “If they don’t come, I will bury you here.”

Jiang Yu’s body trembled and he almost fainted.

A young master like him had never suffered such misery!

Qin Yu found a few ropes and tied Jiang Yu up, then ignored him. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The reason Qin Yu came to the cemetery was that he wanted to verify whether he could really rely on dark energy to cultivate his powers.

The surroundings were barren, and with the graves everywhere, the dark energy was naturally dense.

Qin Yu sat down cross-legged and tried to absorb the dark energy in the surroundings by absorbing spiritual energy.

The dark energy was like cold ice. It condensed around Qin Yu’s body, and it was bone-piercing.

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that the dark energy actually went into Qin Yu’s body!

However, very quickly, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

After the dark energy and spiritual energy collided in Qin Yu’s body, a huge collision occurred.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt bursts of pain in his lower abdomen, and his entire Dantian seemed to be on the verge of bursting!

“It hurts so much...” Qin Yu clutched his stomach and wailed in pain on the ground.

The surrounding dark energy was still surging over, and as the dark energy accumulated, Qin Yu’s pain became increasingly intense.

This pain was different from ordinary abdominal pain. It was extreme pain from ice and fire combined!

Qin Yu, trying to rely on his strong willpower to endure it, gritted his teeth.

However, the pain was too intense. Qin Yu couldn’t withstand it in the end. He fell to the ground and fainted.

Endless dark energy was still surging over. With Qin Yu as the center, it slowly condensed. Finally, a layer of frost formed on Qin Yu’s body.

“Don’t... don’t die! If you die, who will save me?!” Jiang Yu hurriedly shouted.

However, no matter how much he shouted, Qin Yu still didn’t have the slightest reaction.

This made Jiang Yu feel extremely devastated. He looked at the gloomy environment around him and couldn’t help but shiver.

At this moment, the provincial capital was already in an uproar.

It was the first time in history that Jiang Yu had been kidnapped.

The news spread throughout the entire provincial capital!

Almost everyone was discussing this matter.

“Qin Yu is too arrogant. He even dares to lay his hands on members of the Jiang Family!”

“Thatt’s normal. It’s easy to get complacent when you’re young.”

“Yeah. First, he crushed the Liu family, then he defeated the old Inner Strength Past Master Hong Wu, and now he’s the president of the Chinese Medicine Association. How can he not be arrogant with such achievements?”

“It’s a pity that he offended the wrong person this time.”

...

Hong Wu sat in the huge living room with a serious look on his face.

“Qin Yu is really gutsy.” Hong Wu took a deep breath.

“That’s the Jiang family, the top dog in the provincial capital. For so many years, who has ever dared to provoke the Jiang family?”

The people around Hong Wu also nodded slightly and said, “Mr. Hong, we’d better draw a clear line with Qin Yu as soon as possible so that we won’t get into trouble.”

Hong Wu kept silent and sighed repeatedly.

At this moment, Mr. Wu brought a generous gift to the Jiang family.

The Jiang family was the top dog in Chuzhou, so their business was naturally huge.

And their huge manor provided for countless people.

These people trained day and night and were all martial artists.

Mr. Wu brought the gift all the way to the living room.

As soon as he entered, he saw Jiang Yu’s brother, Jiang Haoran, sitting there drinking tea.

A few businessmen stood in front of him, and it looked as if they were discussing a business deal.

Jiang Haoran was different from Jiang Yu. Jiang Yu was just a playboy, while Jiang Haoran was the future successor of the Jiang family.

Not only did Jiang Haoran have outstanding business acumen, but he was also a genius in martial arts.

Rumor had it that when he was eighteen years old, he had already advanced to the Inner Strength Past Master realm, and his current strength was even more impressive.

After seeing Mr. Wu, Jiang Haoran waved his hand to indicate for them to leave.

Jiang Haoran said politely, “Mr. Wu, why are you here?”

Seeing Jiang Haoran’s attitude, Mr. Wu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

Could it be that Jiang Haoran still didn’t know about Jiang Yu’s kidnapping?

“Haoran, where’s your father?” Mr. Wu asked.

Jiang Haoran smiled and said, “My father has been in seclusion for three years. Now, I’m in charge of the Jiang family.”

Mr. Wu heaved a sigh of relief.

He smiled and said, “Haoran, I came here today to talk to you about something.”

Jiang Haoran nodded and said, “If you have something to say, just say it.”

Mr. Wu was silent for a moment, then he told Jiang Haoran what had happened.

After Jiang Haoran heard it, his expression immediately turned cold.

“You said that my brother was kidnapped?” Jiang Haoran’s tone was a little cold.

Mr. Wu quickly explained, “This is actually just a misunderstanding. Why don’t I set up a meeting and let us resolve the misunderstanding?”

Jiang Haoran sighed slightly and said, “I know my brother’s temper. This good-for-nothing only knows how to cause trouble outside every day!”

Hearing this, Mr. Wu heaved a sigh of relief inside.

He smiled and said, “Jiang Yu is still young. Don’t blame him too much.”

Jiang Haoran nodded in response. Then, he looked at Mr. Wu and changed the topic, “Who kidnapped my brother?”

Mr. Wu’s expression changed slightly, and he thought to himself, this wasn’t good.

Jiang Haoran said indifferently, “Although my brother is mischievous, he represents the entire Jiang family!”

“If someone dares to touch a member of my Jiang family, that would be challenging the Jiang family’s status and dignity! What, does the Jiang family no longer have any deterrence in Chuzhou?”
