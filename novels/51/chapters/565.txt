Chapter 566: The First Golden Core Was In His Hands Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The black light grew larger and larger while shining brightly under the sunlight.

The black light flickered, as if it was a real towering mountain

“I originally didn’t want things to be like this... but you forced me!” Gu Canghai’s mouth dripped with blood as he roared angrily!

Qin Yu sneered. “I should be the one to say this to you.”

“Go to h*ll!” Gu Canghai was already unable to listen to anything he said. He roared loudly, and the Mountain-Destroying Seal in his hand ruthlessly smashed towards Qin Yu!

“Rumble...”

The instant the light seal was thrown out, it was like a real mountain that was pressing towards Qin Yu!

The rolling might brought about waves of hurricanes in the surroundings. The surrounding people, afraid of being affected, hurriedly retreated!

The Mountain-Destroying Seal grew increasingly stronger before crushing down from high above!

In front of this Mountain-Destroying Seal, Qin Yu’s thin figure appeared extremely weak!

But his imposing demeanor intimidated people! It seemed like nothing could faze him!

“Rumble!”

The Mountain-Destroying Seal was getting closer and closer to Qin Yu. Finally, that enormous light was about to engulfe Qin Yu at this moment!

Qin Yu, who hadn’t moved at all, finally raised his hand slowly.

He slowly clenched his hand, and the golden light instantly exploded! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At this moment, that pair of iron fists seemed to contain the ability to destroy their surroundings!

“Mountain-Destroying Seal? I think it’s nothing impressive!” Qin Yu coldly spat out, then suddenly threw a punch towards the Mountain-Destroying Seal!

“Rumble!”

At the instant of the collision, there was a huge tremor!

Qin Yu’s fist contained a crushing force, and instantly pierced through that black luster!

“Boom!”

Another explosion sounded, and that extraordinary Mountain-Destroying Seal actually exploded in an instant! Then, it vanished into thin air!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s expression was calm and indifferent, as if he had done something insignificant.

Everyone was dumbstruck, and some of them even gulped.

The Mountain-Destroying Seal was destroyed with just one punch?!

One had to know that this was Gu Canghai’s trump card!

“How... how is this possible...”

At this moment, Gu Canghai was completely in despair!

Even if he gave it his all, he still couldn’t defeat Qin Yu!

The gap between the two of them had reached an irreparable state!

Qin Yu looked at Gu Canghai coldly and said, “Is this all you got? It’s only so-so.”

Gu Canghai was completely terrified. Cold sweat was dripping down his forehead and his entire body was trembling. In the end, he even kneeled in front of Qin Yu!

At this moment, Gu Canghai no longer had the slightest bit of arrogance. Instead, he was like an ordinary old man, a stark contrast from the high and mighty Sect Master of the Saint Confucian Sect.

“Qin Yu... spare me...” Gu Canghai knelt on the ground and his entire body was trembling as he wept bitterly.

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you think that’s possible?”

Gu Canghai suddenly raised his head. He thought of something and shouted, “Qin Yu, I... I have three ten-thousand-year-old herbs! I can give them to you!”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “If I kill you, those herbs will still be mine.”

Gu Canghai was extremely flustered. He was desperately thinking of a condition that could tempt Qin Yu.

“I. . . I still have hundreds of millions of family assets! I can give them to you, as long as you spare my life!” Gu Canghai said anxiously.

Qin Yu sneered. “Gu Canghai, don’t say these useless things. You’d better give me your last words.”

However, how could Gu Canghai give up? It wasn’t easy for him to climb to his current position. In order to become a Martial Marquis, he had sacrificed a lot!

“Qin Yu, don’t you have a grudge with the Yan family? I. . . I know a lot of information about the Yan family. I can provide it to you!” Gu Canghai said desperately.

“I can even... I can even be a spy! When the time comes, we can cooperate!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Gu Canghai, if I’m not mistaken, the Yan family has already given up on you, right?”

Gu Canghai’s expression suddenly changed! A trace of panic flashed through his eyes!

Qin Yu continued, “If the Yan family hadn’t given up on you, you wouldn’t have gone to look for Shen Bin.”

Gu Canghai was in despair. All his conditions were unable to tempt Qin Yu. He was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to escape death today.

“You can’t kill me...” Gu Canghai shook his head non-stop.

“It wasn’t easy for me to become a Martial Marquis. It wasn’t easy for me to become the Sect Master of the Saint Confucian Sect!” Gu Canghai roared with a hint of madness!

“In order to become a Martial Marquis, I became the slave of the Yan family. My life was worse than that of a dog! I can’t just die like this!”

Qin Yu looked at Gu Canghai coldly and didn’t say a word.

Gu Canghai seemed to have gone mad. He raised his head and roared, “Yan family, you guys are inhumane! I became the slave of the Yan family and worked hard without complaint. Now, you guys have turned against me!”

“Yan Sihai, you are a beast!”

His anguished roar spread throughout the area.

However, Qin Yu didn’t feel any sympathy in his heart.

Since he had submitted to the wealthy, he would be abandoned by the wealthy sooner or later.

He had to bear the consequences for the path he had chosen.

“Well then. If you guys want me to die, none of you will be able to live!” Gu Canghai’s face was filled with madness!

One could see that internal qi was surging rapidly in his abdomen!

A destructive energy was quietly gathering!

“Oh no, Gu Canghai wants to self-destruct!” At this moment, someone seemed to have guessed something!

As soon as he said this, everyone turned pale with fright and fled!

Qin Yu looked coldly at Gu Canghai and said, “If you want to self-destruct, I’m afraid you won’t have the chance!”

Before he finished his words, Qin Yu’s palm flashed with golden light, and his physical strength was unleashed to the extreme!

“Slap!”

A sharp slap landed on Gu Canghai’s head!

“Crack!”

With just one slap, Gu Canghai’s head was shattered!

His body instantly wilted, like a deflated rubber ball.

Gu Canghai’s pupils rapidly turned gray and no longer showed any signs of life.

The great and formidable Gu Canghai had died just like that.

The surroundings gradually calmed down. While everyone was panicking, they couldn’t help but sigh.

Who would have thought that Gu Canghai, who was still awe-inspiring a few days ago, would turn into a corpse in the blink of an eye?

“There really are talented people emerging from every generation.” Someone sighed slightly.

Qin Yu looked at Gu Canghai, who was kneeling on the ground in front of him, and a hint of excitement flashed across his face.

“It’s time to test the effect of this Golden Core,” Qin Yu whispered.

He had been looking forward to this day for too long! The Golden Core had long been nurtured in a Gu Canghai’s body since he was a Martial Marquis, and this Golden Core was very likely the fastest way to increase his cultivation realm!

Qin Yu slowly raised his hand and slapped Gu Canghai’s lower abdomen.

His lower abdomen immediately exploded! A pearl the size of a marble flickered in the dark dantian.

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and the Golden Core fell into his palm.

“Is this the Golden Core?” Qin Yu was very excited.
