Chapter 2619: Second Level’s Storage Room

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s heart froze. This ability to manipulate space with a simple gesture.

This power was beyond his capability to resist. It seemed like Cang Zhi had mastered some power of rules within the Saint Kingdom.

As Qin Yu concentrated, he instantly felt a malevolent force attacking his divine soul.

It gave him a sensation of tearing, the kind of pain that reached deep into his soul, causing involuntary spasms throughout his body.

“Though I am still under the influence of the Saint Kingdom’s order, the impact has been greatly reduced due to the shattered numerical values and Heart of

Saint Kingdom. I can, to some extent, increase the difficulty of the trial.”

Cang Zhi pointed his finger, creating ripples in the space at his fingertip.

His fingertip pierced through space, directly tapping into Qin Yu’s divine soul.

Thousands of black threads of power emanated from his fingertip, penetrating Qin Yu’s divine soul.

They began to twist, compressing Qin Yu’s divine soul into various shapes.

The Sea of Soul was cut open by these knife-like threads and then stitched back together.

“This is the most basic and brutal mental attack. The soul has its limits, and once it reaches the critical point, the soul will naturally collapse,” Cang Zhi chuckled.

Qin Yu’s divine soul was torn into pieces once again, only to be stitched together.

“How about it? Do you want to kneel and beg for mercy? However, once the trial begins, it cannot be stopped. Of course, I can control it to minimize your suffering.”

Cang Zhi wore a mocking expression.

“Stop talking nonsense. If you have any tricks, use them now.”

Qin Yu’s face turned slightly pale. He finally understood where his slim chance of survival came from compared to others.

During his encounter with a Nightmare in the ninth level of purgatory, he underwent extreme mental torment.

Yet, the mental strength his father bestowed upon him allowed him to resist such torture to the limit.

Even though the pain was akin to bone-chewing maggots, Qin Yu’s gaze remained unwavering.

“Hmph, let’s see how long you can keep your defiance. I can prolong the time until you break down and beg for mercy,” Cang Zhi sneered.

With a wave of his hand, he once again tore Qin Yu’s divine soul into countless fragments.

For three full days, Qin Yu endured this primal mental assault. His divine soul shattered repeatedly before regenerating. Eventually, even if he stood motionless, every bone in his body convulsed uncontrollably.

His soul power was in complete disarray, and at this moment, he couldn’t even control lifting a finger.

Cang Zhi’s expression became extremely grim. He hadn’t expected someone to withstand such an extreme mental assault.

Even the previously powerful demonic cultivators with formidable divine souls had their souls shattered under this challenging test. It was unexpected that Qin Yu managed to endure until the end.

“What? Is this it?” Qin Yu struggled to speak.

“Humph! It’s just passing a test. I will intervene to block Seifer. However, if you end up being killed by summoned creatures or outsiders, the outcome will be the same,” Cang Zhi snorted coldly.

As time passed, the entire space of the trial ground began to gradually shatter.

Qin Yu’s body reappeared at the entrance of the bunker after a moment of ethereality.

“Why did you come out so quickly?” Li Yue at the entrance was somewhat astonished. In his perception, Qin Yu had returned almost immediately after entering.

“Is there a time difference inside compared to outside?” He quickly grasped the situation.

Qin Yu’s current state was extremely poor. He couldn’t even maintain a standing posture.

Li Yue hadn’t deceived him. If it were anyone else, they would likely have died countless times.

Even though he had previously experienced such spiritual torture, going through it again was still immensely terrifying.

“Seifer’s threat should be temporarily resolved. The people in the bunker will block Seifer’s power, and we won’t be attacked again during the battle,” he explained. Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

Although Seifer couldn’t directly kill them, he could influence their combat capabilities through various means. In a real battle, this impact would be deadly.

“However, the necromancy army and that outsider are still significant issues,” Qin Yu sighed.

Especially the mysterious outsider who could effortlessly kill Ju Wuwei. This indicated that his strength far surpassed theirs.

Confronting this person on the battlefield raised questions about how they would handle the situation.

“It’s already a great surprise to have dealt with Seifer. Though the remaining challenges are tough, the overall situation has gained more vitality. With

Seifer’s abilities, he could have easily slaughtered most of the elite soldiers. Now that he’s taken care of, Nine Tune City’s combat strength has significantly increased.” Li Yue’s expression relaxed.

While they were talking, a terrifying energy came out of the bunker. This energy was like a long river that enveloped the entire Nine Tune City.

This should be the power that Nine Tune City had used to hold Cang Zhi back. Qin Yu was somewhat shocked. This power could even cover the entire Nine Tune City. One could imagine how powerful it was.

“Qin Yu, please ask the City Lord of Nine Tune City to protect the city wall and obtain great military merits. You can directly come to the storage room to claim your rewards. Prepare for the upcoming major battle,” one of the soldiers from the commando team addressed Qin Yu.

“Alright.” Qin Yu promptly followed the two soldiers.

With Li Yue’s report, the battle had been extended by a day and a half. There was not much time left.

To be able to increase his strength before the war began was extremely crucial to his survival.

Li Yue followed behind and went to the storage room together.

In front of them were still those common medicinal pills and mysterious items.

However, after experiencing the previous choices, Qin Yu did not dare to choose these mysteries now.

These enigmatic items had entered the Saint Kingdom from elsewhere and were now affected by the Saint Kingdom’s power.

Hence, even if some of them were extraordinary treasures, they were already damaged and could only be used a few times.

Moreover, there was a high probability of acquiring worthless items.

“If your military merits are sufficient, you can enter the next level,” the soldier behind Qin Yu suddenly spoke.

“There’s another level?”

Qin Yu was surprised. Despite slaying a black dragon, he hadn’t received the command to proceed to the next level. This indicated the high military merits required.

The wall shook vigorously, revealing a narrow secret chamber with only five items displayed.

“You can choose two items..”
