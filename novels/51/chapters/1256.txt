Chapter 1257: Chapter 1,257. Was this the saint-level 

The surroundings were filled with endless darkness. The Darkness was extremely pure, without the slightest bit of light.

After traveling for an unknown period of time, a sliver of light finally appeared in front of Qin Yu.

This sliver of light was extremely dazzling in the darkness, causing one’s eyes to water.

Swoosh

Finally, a group of people appeared on another ancient array platform.

“We’re here,”elder Bai said indifferently.

There was an indescribable excitement on everyone’s faces.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

Sure enough, the spiritual Qi here was much denser and purer!

Not only that, Qin Yu could clearly feel that his body had become much lighter at this moment.

It was as if something on Earth had been pressing on his body and had disappeared.

Qin Yu’s eyes scanned his surroundings.

The surroundings were filled with buildings.

And this ancient array platform was located on a mountain.

The scenery here was extremely beautiful. Compared to Earth, this place was like a fairyland in the human world, filled with greenery.

As he continued to look, Qin Yu seemed to see a mountain gate.

On this mountain gate were a few large words: Heavenly Cloud sect.

“It’s bad.”Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed.

The thing he was most worried about had happened! This ancient array platform was indeed within the sect!

As a result, it would be much more difficult to escape.

Qin Yu subconsciously looked at elder Bai and saw that elder Bai was also looking at him with a faint smile.

That smile hid a trace of extreme killing intent.

Zi Ru, who was beside him, could no longer hold it in. She took a step forward, pointed at Qin Yu and shouted, “Little trash, it’s time for you to pay the price for Zi He’s death!”

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He was not in a hurry to react. Instead, he used his desolate God’s eyes to scan the Tianyun sect, trying to figure out the general route.

“Do you really think that we would take a fancy to a trash like you who can’t cultivate! You must pay the price for killing Zi He!”Zi Ru continued to shout.

Elder Bai, who was at the side, said indifferently, “Brat, no one dares to behave atrociously with our heavenly cloud sect! After killing our people, I will definitely crush your bones and Scatter Your Ashes!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “F * ck your mother. Do you think that I will just sit and wait for death?”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and ran!

His feet shot out explosively, and the terrifying power even shattered the ancient array platform under his feet!

“Where do you think you’re going!”Zi Ru shouted loudly and immediately chased after him at high speed!

Qin Yu’s physical body was extremely fast, but after all, he didn’t have the support of spiritual power, so his speed was still lacking by quite a bit.

Seeing that Zi Ru was getting closer and closer to him, a cold glint flashed across Qin Yu’s eyes.

He suddenly stopped his footsteps, abruptly turned around, and punched Zi Ru in the face.

“Bang!”

This punch sent Zi Ru, who was chasing after him, flying.

Her originally handsome face was almost disfigured at this moment.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to stop and continued to flee.

This was the Tianyun sect. Once they regained their senses, there would be nowhere to run.

Seeing Qin Yu escape under everyone’s watchful eyes, elder Bai’s expression couldn’t help but turn gloomy.

“He actually let him escape. This kid is terrifyingly calm,”elder Bai said darkly.

He had never thought that Qin Yu’s thoughts would be so clear under such circumstances.

In elder Bai’s expectations, Qin Yu should have knelt down and begged for mercy.

At this moment, Zi Ru, whose face was covered in blood, said furiously, “Elder Bai, you must kill this kid no matter what! You must!”

Elder bai sneered, “Don’t worry, there’s no need to rush. I want to see where he can run to.”

The Heavenly Cloud sect was a huge entity with countless disciples.

As long as they gave the order, they could search everywhere! It was naturally not that easy to escape. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

...

Qin Yu shot all the way. Relying on his nearly indestructible divine power, he fled for an unknown period of time. Finally, he fled to a busy city and stopped.

After a long period of rapid escape, even Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp for breath.

He wiped the cold sweat off his forehead, then looked at his surroundings.

This was a bustling city. This bustling city was quite large, and it had all sorts of things to eat, drink, and play. It wasn’t much different from the mortal world.

Qin Yu had just arrived at the saint-level, so he didn’t know anything about the saint-level at all. As for the Tianyun sect, he knew nothing at all.

“F * ck, I just arrived at the Holy Region, and now I have to run away.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu didn’t think much about it. The most important thing now was to find out more about the Tianyun sect and the Holy Region, and at the same time, find some energy to recover his spiritual energy.

Thus, Qin Yu strode forward and finally stopped at a small stall.

It was a grocery store with all kinds of daily necessities on it.

“Boss, do you have a map of the Holy Region?”Qin Yu raised his head and asked.

The stall owner heard this and couldn’t help but snicker, “A map of the Holy Region? Are you still asleep? Do you know how big the Holy Region Is?”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “How Big?”

The stall owner Looked Qin Yu up and down and mercilessly mocked, “You won’t be able to finish it even if you walk for ten lifetimes!”

Qin Yu knew that the holy region was quite huge, but the stall owner’s words were a bit too exaggerated.

“But I do have a map of the Li Prefecture here. Do you want it?”The stall owner suddenly changed the topic and took out a rolled up parchment.

“Where is the Li Prefecture?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

The stall owner said somewhat impatiently, “The place we are standing on is the Li Prefecture.”

“Alright, give me a portion.”Qin Yu stretched out his hand and said.

The stall owner said with a smile, “10,000 spirit coins.”

10,000 spirit coins?

What was a spirit coin?

Qin Yu’s heart was filled with doubt. He sneaked a glance at the stall owner and saw that the stall owner’s face was filled with the craftiness of a businessman.

Qin Yu did not reveal his expression and said indifferently, “Do you think I’m very poor? It’s just 10,000 spirit coins. I’ll give it to you.”

Then, Qin Yu pretended to take the money out of his pocket.

The stall owner quickly poked his head over and looked at Qin Yu’s pocket.

Just when he let down his guard, Qin Yu suddenly reached out his hand and snatched the map, then ran away.

“I don’t have money. When I have money in the future, I’ll pay you back tenfold!”Qin Yu shouted as he ran.

“I F * ck you!”The stall owner jumped thirty feet high and shouted.
