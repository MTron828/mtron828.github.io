“This Milky Way Holy Body has a terrifying energy requirement. The energy of Saint Power is completely incompatible with qi. It’s hundreds of times stronger than the previous qi, but this kind of Saint Power can’t even fill the needs of the Milky Way Holy Body.”

Qin Yu gasped. However, the stronger the energy requirement, the stronger his holy body.

He would enter the core area first. He would consider the complete Milky Way Holy Body Body after he entered the core area.

Ling Bo!

Qin Yu’s feet paused and a powerful force erupted from his feet.

A huge force directly stepped into the air. Qin Yu’s entire body shot up like a cannonball.

After a dozen consecutive Lin Bo movement techniques, he had already landed at the entrance of the Heaven Gate.

“Oh! There seems to be another outsider who wants to enter the Heaven Gate. He seems to be at the Dao Realm level 3 or 4. Not bad. He seems to be a good worker and can be used to warm my bed.”

A beautiful woman with long hair twisted her body.

She had a perfect figure. However, one could see a face full of scars under her long bangs.

Half of her rotten face was still squirming as if some force was destroying her cheek.

I’ve been craving for food recently. This little brother isn’t that old, but his meat quality is just right.”

Another sickly and thin woman said with a smile. Her face was like an inverted triangle.

However, the ferocity in her eyes made the surrounding people not dare to speak.

“Bah! You stinky snake demon. Don’t think I won’t touch you just because you have your honey’s support. If you dare to say anything to me again, I dare you to try.”

Zui Rao coldly smiled as she stared at Xiao Qing as if her words had triggered anger in her heart.

“Everyone, this person is someone my master, Yi Yun, wants. Please respect him.”

A handsome man said to the few of them. However, what was out of place was that he was wearing a collar around his neck.

This was an extremely insulting behavior, but the man did not seem to be uncomfortable at all.

Before he could finish speaking, he was sent flying.

“You’re just a dog outsider. Don’t you have any self-awareness? It’s not your place to speak.”

Zui Rao said with a cold smile. She didn’t show him any respect. “I hope you will still be unyielding like this when my master comes.” The man spat out two broken teeth and struggled to stand up.

“I’ll wait until your master comes.”

Zui Rao grunted coldly but she did not continue speaking. It was as though she was somewhat affected by Yi Yun’s reputation.

What entered Qin Yu’s eyes was a gray flat bottom. This large open space was made of hard diamonds.

Qin Yu could not understand how such a heavy space could float ten thousand meters in the air.

Even the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could not tell the boundary of this huge space. In the middle of it was a thousands-of-meters-long staircase.

Qin Yu landed on the huge staircase.

Boom!

With a dull sound, his chest caved in slightly.

A strong astral wind of holy energy as heavy as a mountain hit his chest.

“What a powerful strength! No wonder this place can only go down but not up.

If one’s strength is insufficient, coming here is courting death.”

This holy energy astral wind power should be at Dao Realm level 2.

As Qin Yu walked up step by step, the holy energy astral wind became denser. If he was not careful, the huge force would blow him down from the stairs.

There seemed to be a strong suction force at the bottom of the stairs.

Qin Yu’s feet were sucked to the ground, unable to leave the stairs.

Moreover, every time one of his feet left the ground and was about to step onto another step, the attack of the astral winds would suddenly become more intense.

“I’d like to see what’s so amazing about this staircase to the core region.” Qin Yu wanted to test his Milky Way Holy Body.

With a violent jolt under his feet, he used the Ling Bo movement technique.

He originally could walk 1,000 meters in a single step using Ling Bo in the Demon Sealing Valley, but now he only left the ground for a short time before falling rapidly.

Moreover, when he had just left the ground, the holy energy astral wind seemed to have gone crazy.

The strength had increased tens of times, and the attack frequency was extremely high.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In less than a second, Qin Yu’s entire body was hit by no less than hundreds of attacks.

Qin Yu’s blood and qi surged the moment he landed, but he was not shocked. Instead, he was happy.

After being bombarded by this force, the energy in his newly evolved Milky Way Holy Body’s muscles and bones shattered.

The astral winds were integrated into every cell of his body. It was equivalent to tempering his body.

“Great!”

Qin Yu squatted down slightly, and a holy silver aura suddenly erupted from his body.

Following the eruption of this aura, he leaped up again and accepted the attack of the astral wind.

This step to enter the core domain of the Holy Region was only a tool for him to temper his body!

Other than the Milky Way holy bones in his spine, the strength of his other bones and muscles had been dispersed.

Furthermore, his body once again emitted a sense of hunger and desire after all the power was dispersed and fused into his body.

He didn’t even need his divine soul to trigger it.

As he leaped into the air, his body turned into a black hole.

The violent Saint Power had become a tonic for his body. The violent energy entered his body.

The energy in his skeleton slowly filled up.

After an unknown period, his body suddenly erupted with a violent silver light.

His entire body seemed to have turned into a silver sun. At this moment, the Saint Power erupted from him and was tainted with a layer of silver light.

Following the movement of his feet, Ling Bo once again directly stood him up.

At this moment, he was floating in the air. The terrifying suction force below the steps was completely ineffective against him.

His body could completely withstand this violent power.

“Brat, I think I smell a good energy. It’s the cute Fierce Beast, Chaos. Hahaha! I can fill my stomach now!”

Dagger’s crazy laughter came from Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“What? What? What?”

Qin Yu’s brain did not react for a moment. Was the dagger confused?

It took him a while to react. Could it be the huge staircase under his feet and the space from before were formed by a Fierce Beast, Chaos?

Although there were legends of the Fierce Beast, Chaos, in the lower realm, no one had ever seen its true appearance.

It is said that there is a beast in the west of Kunlun Mountain. It looked like a dog, had long hair and four feet, looked like a bear but had no claws, had eyes but couldn’t see, couldn’t walk, had two ears but couldn’t hear, some people know where it went, had an abdomen but no five internal organs, had straight intestines, and food can pass through directly.

If a man had virtue, he would resist it; If he had evil virtue, he would rely on it. When the sky is like this, it is called chaos..
