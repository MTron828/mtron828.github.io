2291 The Sumeru Qi

On the Heavenly Origin Continent, Qin Yu cultivated for ten days or so.

At this moment, Qin Yu had completely absorbed the spiritual energy in the space of this Mystic Realm.

Only the Green Spirit Tree was absorbing the nearby nature’s spiritual energy and slowly emitting it in this space.

Qin Yu put away the Green Spirit Tree and left this Mystic Realm.

If he were to cultivate under normal circumstances, even with the Traceless Immortal Scripture, he would probably take no less than three months to gather such a terrifying amount of spiritual energy.

But under this Mystic Realm of spiritual energy, coupled with the help of the Green Spirit Tree, his spiritual energy absorption speed reached the fastest.

“Qin Yu, my strength has already recovered to the True Saint Realm! The spiritual energy this time was really vigorous.”

Elder Guai’s voice sounded.

Qin Yu scanned with his divine sense. Not only had Elder Guai but Xiaoru also recovered to her peak state after absorbing an enormous amount of spiritual energy. An additional daffodil petal had even grown.

Little Fatty had also grown, but its divine sense would take a long time to recover.

Qin Yu frowned. His current strength was at the limit of the fourth-grade True Saint now, but he failed to comprehend the fifth-grade level’s realm of the rules.

The fifth-grade True Saint was a hurdle for the True Saint Realm.

The cultivators must comprehend the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth with their souls and infuse the rules of the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth into their bodies to fuse with the Path of Heaven. Only then would they enter the fifth-grade realm.

His current power of annihilation was comprehended through Wu Ji’s comprehension, not the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth.

In addition, he lacked the Path of Heaven entering his body and thus was unable to enter the fifth-grade realm for a long time.

“Elder Guai, when you broke through to fifth grade, did you encounter the same situation as me, being stuck at the peak of fourth grade and could not break through?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“We, the tree demon, have lived for a long time. Therefore, when we reach the peak of the fourth grade, we naturally enter the fifth grade. Qin Yu, you have only taken a short 70 to 80 years to progress from the first to the fourth grade, which is already considered a genius. It may be normal for you to accumulate for some time in this cultivation realm.”

Elder Guai did not encounter such a situation, so he could only console Qin Yu.

“There is another situation that is more troublesome.”

“What situation?”

“If the Path of Heaven passes through this galaxy, we’ll be in trouble! In other words, there was no way to break through to the fifth-grade realm here. We can only wait for the next wave of the Path of Heaven to descend.”

Qin Yu’s face turned ugly. The hundred-year promise between him and Si Shiyue was approaching.

If he could not break through to fifth grade, he might not be able to defeat Si Shiyue even if he could defeat some ninth-grade True Saints.

The geniuses of the aristocratic families in the Holy Region were beyond comparison with the cultivators from this galaxy.

“No, I must find a way to go back as soon as possible!”

Staying here would only be a waste of time if he could not break through.

“Qin Yu, give it another try. The place with the densest power of the Path of Heaven in this galaxy is in purgatory. You can try to comprehend the Path of Heaven there.”

Elder Guai sighed. The journey back was easier said than done. After so many years, only Chang Ye had ever stepped into the Holy Region, and this already explained many things.

Qin Yu nodded, then got up and rushed to Solitary Cloud City.

“Brother Qin Yu, you can try cultivating under the Green Spirit Tree more often. Many people in the Yun family relied on these three Green Spirit Trees to comprehend the rules of the fifth grade.”

At this moment, Yun Qingyun had finished her cultivation and spoke to Qin Yu.

“This time, I also relied on the Green Spirit Tree to cultivate but couldn’t touch that threshold. Little lass, cultivate well. Tell me when you want to leave the Sumeru ring. When the time comes, you take the Green Spirit Tree along.”

Qin Yu said softly.

“No, this is from Father. From today onward, I will cultivate well! I’ll not let anyone bully the people around me again!”

Yun Qingyun said. After going through the worst, she slowly walked out now.

“Alright, alright. We’ll talk about it later.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and did not dwell on the topic.

Qin Yu went to the teleportation formation and returned to Solitary Cloud City after putting in the spirit essence.

“It’s so expensive. It actually costs 10 pieces of spirit essence!”

Qin Yu sighed and said. Solitary Cloud City was not far away from the Heavenly Origin Continent. It should only be half a boat year’s journey, but it would cost ten pieces of spirit essence. One could imagine how much it would cost to travel from here to the Holy Region.

After returning to Solitary Cloud City, he rushed to the central square and strolled there.

He urgently needed the Sumeru qi as this Sumeru ring was very important to him.

Back on the Heavenly Origin Continent, Master Hei Yu had warned him that he needed to replenish the Sumeru qi or else the Sumeru ring would soon collapse.

However, after going around, he did not find any Sumeru qi.

“Team up, team up! A third-grade True Saint is leading the hunt for Three-Faced Spiders. Just need one more powerful support to complete the team of three! The poison pill materials will be evenly distributed by the ratio of 5:3:2!”

A person with a sneaky appearance shouted loudly.

“Oh yes! I can try this method. Usually, very few people would set up a stall for such a precious item.”

This fellow reminded Qin Yu.

“Who has Sumeru qi? Top-notch magical artifacts and pills exchange! Various treasures are available! If you have Sumeru qi, you can get anything you want!”

Qin Yu shouted.

“Isn’t this Qin Yu?”

“This guy is a ruthless person who killed Ming Yue. I heard that he moved away all the treasures of Azure Firmament Sect. There should be a lot of treasures.”

“What is this Sumeru qi? Why have I never heard of it before?”

Qin Yu’s shout attracted many people. He took out a table from the Sumeru ring displaying various pills. He even took out the silver spear he had obtained from the Fire Unicorn Continent.

Immediately, more and more people gathered to watch. After all, treasures attracted people’s attention everywhere.

“Big Brother, I don’t have Sumeru qi, but I really like this silver spear. Why don’t I accompany you for a night, and you give me this spear?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

A person with a big beard came over and said mysteriously.

“Brother, I have top-notch forging materials here. How about exchanging them for your Spirit Gathering Pill?”

A crowd of people was making noise, but not a single one had what Qin Yu needed. It caused Qin Yu to have a headache.

“Brother, let’s talk in private.”

The shriveled cultivator who shouted just now voice transmitted him.

Qin Yu was stunned. He realized that the cultivator did not come over. Instead, he was transmitting a message to him from afar.

“There’s a chance.”

Qin Yu kept away the things on the table and walked to the other side.

“We’re closing up for today! Whoever has Sumeru qi can come to the Moon Listening Pavilion to look for me.”

Qin Yu shouted and walked in the other direction.

This person did not dare to be high-profile. It was a sign that he had a treasure. Perhaps he did have Sumeru qi.
