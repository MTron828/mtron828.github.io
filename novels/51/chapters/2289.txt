2290 The Green Spirit Tree

“Clang!”

Suddenly, the tobacco pipe that Hei Yu was smoking fell onto the ground. His face seemed to have lost all its color in an instant, turning a terrifyingly pale white.

“What did you say just now? Say again.”

The muscles on Hei Yu’s face twitched. He seemed to be trying his best to suppress his emotions.

“Go to my Sumeru Space and drink tea. I have good tea there too!”

Seeing the atmosphere not right, Qin Yu quickly said as he feared someone would die.

With a wave of his sleeve, the Sumeru qi enveloped two of them and entered the Sumeru Space together.

Hei Yu’s eyes instantly lit up the moment he entered.

“What a powerful forging technique! This place seemed to have formed its own world! It was definitely the work of a master! It was definitely something that could only be created by a cultivator with the utmost spatial cultivation and a top-notch master refiner!”

Hei Yu exclaimed with a shocked expression.

“Indeed. Qin Yu, who is this?”

Elder Guai was surprised when he saw the person disclose the origin of the Sumeru ring immediately.

“This is Master Hei Yu.”

Elder Guai nodded. He had also heard of Hei Yu’s name.

“Qin Yu, the rules of space in this spatial ring are very stable. However, it seems too long, and the Sumeru qi is very thin. You must replenish it in time, or else this ring may collapse at any time.”

After studying it for a long time, Hei Yu found some clues.

“Indeed. It has been five thousand years since I got this Sumeru ring. It is indeed a long time.” Elder Guai nodded.

“Where can I find Sumeru qi?”

Qin Yu asked with a frown. The Sumeru ring was very important to him, so he naturally did not want the supreme treasure to be destroyed just like that.

“I’m not sure about that either. The Sumeru qi is usually produced in the void, but I heard it’s tremendously precious, and only a trace is produced every hundred years. The Sumeru Space can be greatly expanded if there’s sufficient Sumeru qi and can also be used as an attack method to cut through space. It’s even more terrifying than the sharpest divine weapon!”

“I’ll ask Ji Yue, the owner of Moon Listening Pavilion when I return to Solitary Cloud City.”

Qin Yu thought to himself.

After chatting for half a day, the three returned to the bamboo forest. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Alright, Master Hei Yu, I’ll be leaving first. We’ll meet again if fate permits!”

Qin Yu cupped his hands toward Hei Yu.

“Brother Qin Yu, this bracelet is for you.”

Hei Yu handed over a silver bracelet with eight silver beads on it.

“What is this?”

Qin Yu asked curiously.

“These are Spirit Storage Beads, and each can store a huge amount of spiritual energy. These were the reward a client gave me when I refined a supreme treasure. However, I don’t fight, so I don’t need them.”

Hei Yu said with a smile.

Qin Yu curiously injected one-tenth of the chaotic qi into the Spirit Storage Bead and was surprised to discover that the chaotic qi did not even fill up half of the Spirit Storage Bead!

“F*ck!”

Qin Yu could not help but curse. He had developed his body to the extreme.

Every cell and every muscle could withstand a vast amount of chaos qi. Under such circumstances, this Spirit Storage Bead could still store about two-tenth of his chaotic qi.

This could save his life at a critical moment!

“Thank you, Master Hei Yu! This magical artifact is indeed of great use to me. I’ll take it!”

Qin Yu did not act pretentious and accepted the bracelet.

He came to the Yun family’s spiritual energy Mystic Realm and took out the Green Spirit Tree.

The Green Spirit Tree’s internal qi submerged into that space, akin to a key that opened the main door.

An internal qi enveloped Qin Yu and teleported him in.

Instantly, a gentle and ethereal spiritual energy enveloped him like a tangible substance, and every cell in his body was filled with a refreshing sensation.

“What a rich spiritual energy!”

This was the first time Qin Yu had felt such abundant spiritual energy on this continent.

The Traceless Immortal Scripture!

At that moment, a sea-like surge of spiritual energy poured into his body, and the terrifying speed at which he absorbed the spiritual energy even caused a hurricane to sweep through this Mystic Realm of spiritual energy.

Three Green Spirit Trees appeared above Qin Yu’s head. These three Green Spirit Trees then fused again.

They transformed into a towering ancient tree, and numerous roots extended from the void.

Those roots expanded wildly, piercing into any space with spiritual energy within tens of thousands of feet, absorbing spiritual energy and then emitting it from the leaves.

It was indeed a supreme treasure of the Yun family. The speed at which it absorbed spiritual energy was terrifying.

Countless spiritual energy descended in the Sumeru ring.

Elder Guai, Wang Feng, and the two brats began cultivating with tacit understanding.

Qin Yu transformed into a machine that absorbed spiritual energy. Every cell and muscle of his was stuffed with terrifying chaotic qi, all the way to his meridians and dantian.

After that, he segregated the chaotic qi and injected it into the Spirit Storage Bead.

…

In the Blue Horizon Continent, Shui Yuan was staring at Nangong Qi and a smiling monk in horror.

He was grabbed by Hua Tian like a little chick. The spiritual energy in his body was completely locked, and he was unmovable.

“Nangong Qi, I treat you as my own son. How dare you collude with outsiders to harm me?”

Shui Yuan was in disbelief.

“Master, you’re old now. Before you die, why don’t you give out your luck and become a part of Master Hua Tian? When the time comes, we can kill Qin Yu to avenge you.”

Hua Tian formed a hand seal and suddenly bit Shui Yuan’s head.

Instantly, his soul emitted an extremely shrill and mournful scream. In just a moment, Shui Yuan’s head and soul were all eaten by Hua Tian.

A white mist from Shui Yuan’s body slowly entered Hua Tian’s sea of consciousness.

“Haha, as expected of the sect master of one of the three great sects. Your luck is not bad. I can now feel my luck has increased by a large margin!”

Hua Tian patted his belly, laughed heartily, and said.

He grinned hideously and said, “Go and bring in people ten by ten from the sect now. I want to devour all the luck of the Mysterious Dark Sect.”

“Yes, sir! Master Hua Tian!”

Nangong Qi chuckled and said.

“I’ve already seen it. That brat will definitely face a calamity soon. At that time, it will be my chance to make a move. After devouring that brat, the next step was the evil exterminator.”

Hua Tian sneered and said.

“Lord Hua Tian, is Qin Yu a Son of Cosmic Luck? When this person first arrived in the Holy Region, he was in a desperate situation and even became wanted by the people of the Holy Region. However, in just a short period of time, he has grown to such a terrifying level.”

Nangong Qi asked curiously.

“I can’t see this through the Primordial Heavenly Divination I cultivated. He seems to have something on him blocking my Heavenly Eye. However, from his cultivation trajectory, he must be a great Son of Cosmic Luck in the Holy Region.”

Hua Tian patted his stomach.

Back then, he was only an ordinary cultivator. However, after devouring other people’s luck, his heaven-defying luck allowed him to turn every misfortune he encountered into fortune, and his strength also rapidly grew.

With his heaven-defying luck, he could even easily break through while in seclusion. He could even see supreme treasure when he walked.

However, he was tremendously careful. He was unwilling to take any risk the moment he sensed a hint of danger.
