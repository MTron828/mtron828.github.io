1821 The Inner Demons

Seeing Qin Yu’s serious expression, Tan Liu could only nod.

The next day, Tan Liu left the place, while Qin Yu chose to stay and wait for the end of their mission.

These few days, Qin Yu did not waste time. He sat there with his legs crossed, cultivating slowly.

As for how to get the dark energy, Qin Yu planned to figure it out after he returned to Thunder Courtyard.

Another two days passed.

!!

Qin Yu’s inner demons acted up again. This time, he took out the bottle from the magical artifact without hesitation and swallowed a few primordial spirits from the bottle.

After devouring the primordial spirits, the primordial spirit in Qin Yu’s mind became even more powerful!

It was no exaggeration to say that Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was only a step away from the Reversion Void stage!

A powerful primordial spirit was the foundation of everything. Not only did Qin Yu have a powerful primordial spirit beyond his peers, but he also had a physical body that was already in the Reversion Void Stage!

Ordinary Mighty Realm or even a half-step Reversion Void Stage cultivator was not comparable to Qin Yu.

The Reversion Void Stage was invincible. It was indeed a true statement.

Time flew by quickly, and the day appointed arrived.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. He went to the station, spent a lot of spirit coins, and returned to the place where they had agreed to meet.

It was where the teleportation formation of Thunder Courtyard was located. Qin Yu stood there and waited quietly.

In the afternoon, several figures appeared not far away.

Seeing their figures, Qin Yu could not help but frown.

These people’s internal qi was extremely unstable.

When they got closer, Qin Yu’s face became even more unsightly.

All of them were covered in blood and wounds. Some even had broken arms, and half of their faces shattered.

Even Jue Wu and Jiu Xiao had multiple wounds on their bodies.

“This… What’s going on?” Qin Yu quickly went over. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jue Wu, who had always been lively, was silent this time.

Her face was gloomy as if she had suffered a blow.

“Three people died.” At this moment, someone spoke.

Qin Yu’s face turned extremely ugly in an instant!

Three people died?

These people were the elites of Demon-slaying Peak!

“My dear friend… also died.” Someone looked heartbroken and in extreme pain.

Some even squatted down and sobbed silently.

Looking at this scene, Qin Yu also felt a little uncomfortable.

Although he did not experience it personally, he could deeply feel their pain.

“Jue Wu, you… Are you alright?” Qin Yu squatted beside Jue Wu and said softly.

Jue Wu shook her head. She looked at Qin Yu and said, “All of us made concerted efforts, but three people still died. Sigh!”

“Don’t be so sad.” Qin Yu didn’t know how to comfort her, so he could only persuade her.

Jue Wu waved her hand and said, “I just don’t feel good in my heart.”

Even Jue Wu was so sad, let alone the others.

Jiu Xiao looked terribly cold. Even his internal qi was extremely unstable.

“Let’s go,” Jiu Xiao said.

“Jiu Xiao, I want to go back to bring back Eighth Brother’s body,” someone suddenly said.

Jiu Xiao glanced at him and said coldly, “What’s the use of bringing back a corpse? If you go back now, it’s the same as sending yourself to death.

“But…”

“No buts. It’s not the first time someone has died on Demon-slaying Peak,” Jiu Xiao interrupted him.

With that, he activated the formation and asked everyone to leave immediately.

Even though everyone felt uncomfortable, as Demon Hunters, they had to be rational enough.

Therefore, they still stepped into the formation in the end.

The group of them set foot on the road back to Thunder Courtyard.

Along the way, Qin Yu felt very very comfortable.

No wonder Jiu Xiao did not allow him to participate. The danger was beyond his imagination.

After a long time, everyone finally returned to Demon-slaying Peak.

This time, there was no joy or laughter like previously. Instead, everyone was lifeless. No one said much but just returned to their cave abodes.

In the cave abode, Jue Wu didn’t seem in a good mood.

Qin Yu didn’t know how to comfort her, so he could only stay by her side.

Fortunately, Jue Wu was an open person. After a while, she ate and drank as if nothing had happened. The only difference was that that night, Jue Wu drank a lot and was dead drunk, although she had a high tolerance for alcohol.

The feeling of losing a companion was definitely not good.

It was also the first time Jue Wu experienced what it meant to be a companion.

…

The following day, Jue Wu handed her token to Qin Yu.

“I’ve obtained a total of 45 points this time. I think it should be enough now,” Jue Wu said.

Qin Yu took over Jue Wu’s token. He opened his mouth and said, “Are you alright now?”

“What can happen to me?” Jue Wu lazily stretched.

“How about you? Did you get anything from your trip to Zhongzhou? ”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded and told Jue Wu about his experience.

“So you’ve seen that chaotic body?” Jue Wu touched her chin and muttered.

“Yes,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice. “He’s way much stronger than I’ve imagined. I must hurry up.”

Jue Wu agreed and said, “Then you should hurry to the first main peak. Don’t waste time.”

“Alright,” he said. Qin Yu stood up and left the cave abode, heading straight for the first main peak.

It was like previously, Qin Yu had been familiar with the process.

After arriving at the Scripture Pavilion, Qin Yu went straight to look for the Pure Heart Sutra.

To Qin Yu’s surprise, the Pure Heart Sutra was not an actual book. After the exchange, it turned into a golden light and directly entered Qin Yu’s mind.

And the Pure Heart Sutra’s true body was lying there quietly, flickering with radiance.

Qin Yu didn’t think much. It was enough for him as long as he obtained the technique.

After obtaining the Pure Heart Sutra, Qin Yu went to visit Dean Lei again. Unfortunately, Dean Lei did not see him this time.

Qin Yu had no choice but to return to Demon-slaying Peak.

“There are still quite a few points left in this token. I’ll give them all to you.” Qin Yu handed his token to Jue Wu.

“When you have time, you can go to the first main peak to exchange for the cultivation technique you need.”

This time Jue Wu didn’t reject. She transferred all the points in the token to her token.

After that, Qin Yu started his cultivation.

He closed his eyes slightly and circulated the Pure Heart Sutra in his mind.

It was an extremely strange Meridian Circulation Technique. Under the circulation of the Pure Heart Sutra, the inner demons were indeed suppressed.

Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed. As long as he could suppress his inner demons, he could devour the remaining primordial spirits without any worries.

However, Qin Yu did not know that the harder he suppressed his inner demons, the more terrifying the rebound would be.

He also did not expect these inner demons to give birth to an extremely terrifying monster. And this monster was none other than Qin Yu himself.
