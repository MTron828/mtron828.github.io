Chapter 1307: Chapter 1,307, Huangji Foyan’s auction 

“Brother Qin, I advise you not to touch this thing.”

However, at this moment, Wen Da’s words were like a bucket of cold water being poured on Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “Why?”

Wen da said, “Once this thing is born, it will definitely attract a clamor. If you don’t have enough strength, so what if you bid for it? It’s just a waste of money.”

“That’s right, that’s right. A man without sin would be guilty of having a treasure.”Wen Er nodded repeatedly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Although what they said was fine, Qin Yu still wanted to give it a try.

“Huangji Foyan, the starting price is three million spirit coins.”The auctioneer said with a smile.

“Three million, there’s still hope!”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Soon, people began to raise the price.

“I bid four million!”

“Five million!”

“Seven million!”

“Nine million!”

The price soared all the way. In a few short moments, it had reached ten million.

This made Qin Yu lose confidence. He could only find a little more than ten million from his entire body. This price was not something Qin Yu could bear at all.

Soon, the price of Huang Ji Fo Yan was raised to a total of twenty-eight million.

But even so, the enthusiasm of the crowd did not diminish.

“This bid is too boring. 35 million!”At this moment, Wen da raised his hand and shouted.

Qin Yu glanced at Wen da and whispered, “You are also interested in this Huangji Buddha Flame?”

Wen Da waved his hand and said, “I’m not interested. To me, this thing is worthless.”

“Then why did you raise the price?”Qin Yu asked.

Wen Er said from the side, “In any case, there will definitely be someone who will continue to raise the price. Just shout out a high price and show off. It will also leave a good impression in the hearts of the auctioneers.”

When Qin Yu heard this, he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

These two brothers really racked their brains in order to show off.

After a while, the price of Huangji Foyan had already been raised to 50 million.

At this price, the crowd gradually quieted down.

Even for a large aristocratic family, this was not a small amount.

“50 million is enough for this old man to drink for the rest of my life.”Wen Da ridiculed from the side.

In the end, Huangji Foyan was sold for 5,300.

The person who bought this item was an old man. His head was full of white hair and his body was hunched.

Even though he had restrained his internal Qi, he could still feel that he was extraordinary.

Qin Yu sighed in his heart. Without sufficient strength, it was simply not reliable to come to the auction to buy things.

Because no matter how much he bought, it might not be his in the end.

For the remaining time, Qin Yu was practically an escort.

He eagerly waited for the Qi of life. Unfortunately, even after the auction ended, the Qi of life did not arrive.

Many treasures had appeared in this auction, but none of them could be compared to the Huangji Buddha Flame.

“This auction ends here. Thank you for participating,”the female auctioneer said with a smile.

“Let’s go, let’s go.”Big Wen pulled Wen er and hurriedly walked backstage.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and finally followed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

They walked all the way backstage. Everyone was queuing up to comprehend the auction item.

And the person in charge of this matter was still the female auctioneer from earlier.

When it was Big Wen’s turn, he spat out a mouthful of saliva and sipped on his hair.

Following that, he put on an expression that he thought he was very handsome and walked in front of the auctioneer.

The moment she saw Big Wen, the auctioneer’s brows clearly furrowed slightly. She did not hide her disgust.

However, out of professional courtesy, she still politely said, “Sir, please take your auction item.”

Wen Da laughed lightly and casually took out a flower from the auction item.

This flower had an overflowing fragrance and extraordinary medicinal properties. Moreover, it looked extremely bewitching.

Wen Da took this flower and waved it in front of the auctioneer. He smiled faintly and said, “It’s your auction item.”

“PFFT!”

Qin Yu, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

The female auctioneer’s face was filled with frost.

She suppressed the anger in her heart and said, “Sir, please have some self-respect.”

Wen Da was a little embarrassed. Since this move had failed, he brought out his grandfather without saying a word.

“I’m Wen Wanyi’s grandson, and he dotes on me the most.”

“One of them!”Wen Er quickly added.

The expression of the auctioneer became colder and colder.

“Does it have anything to do with me? So what if he’s from one of the nine great clans? It has nothing to do with me,”the auctioneer said coldly.

Wen Da’s expression became more and more awkward, while Wen er burst into laughter.

With that said, Wen da couldn’t continue to pester him, and could only retreat to the side dejectedly.

Qin Yu seized the opportunity and quickly walked forward, cupping his hands and saying, “Hello, fellow Daoist. I wonder if your auction has any life force?”

The female auctioneer sized Qin Yu up and down, then smiled and said, “It’s hard to say. Sometimes there is, and sometimes there isn’t.”

Qin Yu bowed and said, “If it’s convenient, I would like to ask fellow Daoist for help. If there is any life force in your auction, please let me know.”

The auctioneer thought for a moment, then nodded and said, “Okay, I don’t know how to contact you?”

“Oh, I will be staying in the Ju Xian house for the time being,”Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Okay, if there is, I will definitely inform you,”the auctioneer said with a smile.
