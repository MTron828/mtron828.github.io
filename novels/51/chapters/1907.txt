1908 The Yan Family and Xihuang Island

With Qin Yu’s help, his climbing seemed a lot easier.

From chatting, Qin Yu found out his name was Nan Huaisu. He was also in the Early-stage of the Reversion Void but could no longer advance further as a rogue cultivator. Therefore, he decided to step on these stone stairways, hoping to find good fortune in the Yan family.

Qin Yu also made up a name for himself, Qin Yan, to conceal his identity.

Along the way, Qin Yu kept transmitting his faith to Nan Huaisu. Supported by the power of faith, Nan Huaisu indeed became more confident.

As for the others, they were not so fortunate. Along the way, Qin Yu saw countless white bones. It was so cruel.

In the Yan family, someone was watching the scene quietly.

They were like real gods looking down on mortals. Their faces were full of arrogance.

Standing up high, no one could see their existence. The people on the stone stairways were like ants, not worthy of their sympathy.

“Burdened” by Nan Huaisu, Qin Yu finally climbed to the top of the stone stairways on the 28th day.

There was an incredibly magnificent stone gate at the top of the stone stairways. An enormous word, “Yan”, was carved on the gate.

Clouds and mist were floating around the entrance. It very much looked like the entrance to Asgard.

Two elderly men in long robes were running their eyes over the crowd.

“I’ve finally climbed up.” Nan Huaisu looked exhausted.

Qin Yu also pretended to be tired and said, “That’s right. We’ll be considered members of the Yan family in the future.”

While talking, the two of them walked forward.

When they arrived at the stone gate, Nan Huaisu cupped his hands and said, “Greetings to the two seniors.”

The two elderly men glanced at Qin Yu and Nan Huaisu and quickly calculated their time taken to climb the stone stairways.

“28 days, barely qualified,” one of the elderly men said.

Nan Huaisu was overjoyed. The excitement on his face was undisguisable. He kept nudging Qin Yu with his hand and whispered, “There’s a chance. We’re going to enter the Yan family!”

Qin Yu, however, was a little nervous. He was afraid that the two elderly men would notice something unusual. He was also afraid that he would be driven out because of his appearance.

“What’s your name?” One of the elderly men looked at Nan Huaisu.

“My name is Nan Huaisu!” Nan Huaisu quickly said.

“You may go in.” The elderly man waved his hand.

Nan Huaisu was instantly excited. As he walked, he waved to Qin Yu and said, “I’ll wait for you inside!”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He looked at the two elderly men nervously, waiting for them to continue.

“What’s your name?” the old man asked.

“Qin Yan,” Qin Yu said.

The two elderly men looked at each other, frowned, and whispered, “Although this person has climbed up the stone stairways, isn’t his look too ugly?”

“That’s right. Such an appearance is simply a disgrace to our Yan family…” the other elderly man said. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“If not, just give him some money and pills and let him go back,” the two of them discussed and said.

Although they spoke very softly, Qin Yu could still hear them clearly.

He had a bad feeling in his heart and quickly said, “Seniors, although I am ugly, I have always wanted to enter the Yan family. If it is really difficult, you can put me in a place where no one can see me.”

The two elderly men looked at each other as if weighing the situation.

“It wasn’t easy for him to climb up, but his face is too ugly.”

“Is there any place where no one can see him?”

“Let me think about this… Eh? Xihuang Island island is lacking guards. If not, we let him go there.”

“Xihuang Island? The island in front of the third princess’s residence?”

“That’s right. However, the third princess is unruly by nature. If she were to see this face, I’m afraid this young man would have to suffer.”

Qin Yu could hear their conversation clearly, but he didn’t dare to say anything. He could only wait quietly.

“Qin Yan, can you bear the hardships?” one of the elderly men asked.

“Yes, I can!” Qin Yu quickly nodded.

“I can let you stay in the Yan family, but… I’m afraid you’ll have to endure a pain that ordinary people can’t. You’d better consider it carefully,” the other elderly man reminded him.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “Only those who endure the most difficult hardships become the most outstanding people!”

Hearing Qin Yu’s reply, the two elderly men laughed.

“Okay, then you can go to Xihuang Island. You may go in now. Someone will take you to the island later.” The two elderly men waved their hands.

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He did not dare to delay any further and quickly stepped in.

After passing through the stone gate, they arrived at the Yan family. The Yan family was indeed like Asgard. Clouds and mist were lingering everywhere.

In the clouds and mist, there seemed to be incredibly fascinating scenery. Mountains, rivers, flowers, and birds could be seen everywhere.

“Qin Yan!” Nan Huaisu waved at Qin Yu and ran to him excitedly.

“Qin Yan, you’ve finally come in. You scared me to death just now. I thought you couldn’t come in!” Nan Huaisu patted his chest and said.

“I’m lucky to be able to come in,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“It’s good that you can come in,” Nan Huaisu laughed and said. “By the way, what have they arranged for you? ”

“It sounded like Xihuang Island,” said Qin Yu.

“Xihuang Island?” Hearing this, Nan Huaisu’s expression was a little strange.

...

“That’s not a good place,” he sighed and said. “Not only the conditions are harsh, and it’s right in front of the third princess’s residence.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “The two old… old seniors also said it’s hard in Xihuang Island. What exactly is hard there?”

Nan Huaisu opened his mouth but then waved his hand and said, “You’ll know when you get there. The conditions are harsh, and the third princess is perverted. Sigh!”

Qin Yu didn’t care much. After all, he had holy meat, dragon blood, and dragon meat in his hands. They were enough for his cultivation.

“Brother Qin, if it wasn’t for you, I’m afraid I would have already died on the stone stairways. I will remember your kindness forever and never forget it in this lifetime!” Nan Huaisu cupped his hands at Qin Yu.

“It’s nothing,” Qin Yu said with a smile. “You don’t have to be so polite.”

As they were talking, two cultivators walked over from not far away. Their robes had the word “Yan” written on them.

Qin Yu glanced at them and discovered they were both Advanced-stage Reversion Void cultivators.

As expected, even the lowest level of cultivators in the Yan family was tremendously doughty.

The two cultivators took Nan Huaisu with them and left. They seemed like they were arranging a place for him to go.

Qin Yu continued to wait there. After about an hour, a cultivator finally came over.

...

This cultivator seemed to be in dire straits. His internal qi wasn’t strong, and his face looked like he had been through a lot.

“Are you Qin Yan, the one who is going to Xihuang Island?” the cultivator asked.
