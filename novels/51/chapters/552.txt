When he heard these words, Deng Sheng’s expression couldn’t help but change slightly, and he was greatly shocked!

The Saint Confucian Sect was currently trying to capture Qin Yu, but not only did Qin Yu not run away, but he even tried to snatch the Saint Confucian Sect’s Spiritual Spring?

“Qin Yu, this Spiritual Spring is the foundation of the Saint Confucian Sect’s establishment. I... I can’t bring you there.” Deng Sheng braced himself and said.

Qin Yu sneered. “Fine, then I’ll kill you. In any case, there are many people in the entire Saint Confucian Sect who will be willing to do it.”

Deng Sheng’s expression immediately changed!

He was well aware of Qin Yu’s strength. As long as Gu Canghai wasn’t around, no one in the entire Saint Confucian Sect would be his match!

Just as Qin Yu said, even if he didn’t do it, others would definitely do it!

Deng Sheng’s expression was gloomy and hesitant. After thinking for a moment, he gritted his teeth and then raised his head to ask, “Are you sure that I can become the new Sect Master of the Saint Confucian Sect?”

“I’m sure,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“When Gu Canghai dies, you will be the next Sect Master.”

Deng Sheng gritted his teeth and said, “Okay! I agree!”

Qin Yu nodded in satisfaction. He reached out and patted Deng Sheng’s shoulder while saying, “Congratulations, you have made the right choice.”

Then, Qin Yu put on a simple disguise and followed Deng Sheng out of the hall.

The two of them walked in the direction of the Spiritual Spring.

Along the way, countless people greeted Deng Sheng, and some people looked at Qin Yu twice.

Fortunately, Qin Yu covered his face and didn’t arouse too much suspicion.

After a few hundred meters, the two of them finally came to the bottom of a waterfall.

As soon as they got close, Qin Yu felt a trace of dense spiritual energy coming toward him!

Qin Yu couldn’t help but exclaim, “No wonder the Saint Confucian Sect hasn’t declined in such a long time. This Spiritual Spring is enough to feed the entire Saint Confucian Sect!”

Such dense spiritual energy made Qin Yu somewhat excited.

“Do I need to drive them away?” Deng Sheng asked.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “There’s no need. Driving them away will only arouse suspicion.”

Deng Sheng agreed and said, “Okay, then I’ll wait here.”

“Wait.” At this time, Qin Yu called Deng Sheng.

He raised his finger, and a light spot was placed between Deng Sheng’s brows.

Deng Sheng frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean by this?”

Qin Yu said indifferently, “I’ve left a mark in your divine sense. If you dare to inform Gu Canghai, I’ll take your life immediately.”

Deng Sheng’s expression suddenly changed, and he felt a bit uneasy.

But things had already come to this point, and there was no turning back. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I got it.” Deng Sheng took a deep breath and nodded in agreement.

There were more than ten people cultivating near the entire Spiritual Spring.

They were bathing in the Spiritual Spring while relying on a secret method to absorb the spiritual energy from the Spiritual Spring.

Not far away, there was a waterfall. The water here was turbulent, but it was also the place with the densest spiritual energy.

Qin Yu strode down the waterfall.

His body shook, and his clothes were torn.

Then, Qin Yu sat cross-legged under the waterfall while allowing the water to hit his body.

The water contained extremely strong spiritual energy, and its density was beyond imagination.

Not only that, but the spiritual energy in the spring seemed to be endless and inexhaustible.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He closed his eyes and began to cultivate.

The spiritual energy in the waterfall flowed out from Qin Yu’s body and stuck tightly to Qin Yu’s body.

Because Qin Yu was at the source of the spiritual energy, almost all of the spiritual energy was occupied by Qin Yu alone.

The people who came to cultivate soon realized that something was wrong.

They could clearly feel that the spiritual energy in the Spiritual Spring had become extremely thin, so thin that it was negligible.

The people looked at each other and then looked at Qin Yu, who wasn’t far away.

“How can he sit under the waterfall?”

“The Saint Confucian Sect has a clear rule that no one is allowed to cultivate under the waterfall except for the Sect Master, right?”

“Who is that guy? Does he not know the rules?”

Everyone looked at Deng Sheng in unison and said, “Elder Deng, who is that person? Why is he cultivating under the waterfall?”

“Almost all of the spiritual energy has been taken by him. How are we supposed to cultivate?”

Deng Sheng gritted his teeth.

He glanced at everyone and said indifferently, “The Sect Master asked us to do this. This kid is a genius that the Sect Master found. He is also the next Martial Marquis of the Saint Confucian Sect.”

When everyone heard this, they couldn’t help but say with some surprise, “The next Martial Marquis? A second Martial Marquis is going to appear in the Saint Confucian Sect?!”

“Even if he will become the next Martial Marquis, he can’t be so overbearing...”

“It seems that no one in the Saint Confucian Sect has ever received such treatment...”

Deng Sheng frowned and said with some displeasure, “This is the order of the Sect Master. Whoever isn’t satisfied, go ask the Sect Master yourself!”

Although everyone felt resentful, there was nothing they could do.

Almost all of the spiritual energy in this Spiritual Spring had been absorbed by Qin Yu. There wasn’t much meaning for them to stay.

Therefore, Qin Yu was soon left alone in the vicinity of this Spiritual Spring.

After everyone left, Qin Yu opened his eyes and looked at Deng Sheng. He frowned and said, “They won’t tell Gu Canghai about this, right?”

Deng Sheng shook his head and said, “No, the Saint Confucian Sect is extremely strict. Not many people can get in touch with Sect Master Gu.”

Although he said that, Qin Yu still felt a little worried.

The reason he didn’t let Deng Sheng drive them away was to keep a low profile so as to avoid arousing suspicion.

However, the current situation had become even more high profile.

“I have to hurry,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, the speed of absorbing the spiritual energy was limited after all. It wasn’t something Qin Yu could control.

Moreover, this Spiritual Spring couldn’t be taken away.

‘I have to try my best to step into the Martial Marquis realm before Gu Canghai realizes it,’ Qin Yu thought to himself.

Then, with the Three Pure Ancient Tree above his head, he circulated his Meridian Circulation Technique and continued to absorb the spiritual energy.

At the same time, Gu Canghai had already arrived at the Green Moon Villa.

Standing below the villa, Gu Canghai couldn’t help but snort coldly. “Green Moon Villa? Qin Yu, you really have some guts.”

As he spoke, Gu Canghai waved his hand and shattered the mountain gate!

Then, Gu Canghai strode into the Green Moon Villa.

He stood on the square and shouted, “Qin Yu, come out quickly and face your death!”

His voice was bellowing and spread throughout the entire villa!

However, no one responded at all.

Gu Canghai frowned slightly. He released his divine sense and found that there was no one in the Green Moon Villa!

“No one here?” Gu Canghai frowned.

His figure flashed and he immediately searched the entire Green Moon Villa.

As expected, there was no one in the Green Moon Villa!

“Qin Yu... isn’t here?” Gu Canghai’s expression turned cold.

He snorted coldly and said, “Okay, I’ll wait for you here and explore the Iceheart Lake.”

Then, Gu Canghai strode toward the Iceheart Lake.

At this moment, Gu Canghai’s phone rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Yan Sihai!

Gu Canghai didn’t dare to be negligent and quickly picked up the phone.

“President Yan,” Gu Canghai called out politely.

However, Yan Sihai cursed out loud, “Gu Canghai, you’re really an idiot! Qin Yu had already come to the door, but you’re completely unaware. Trash!”
