With the life-and-death diagram in his hand and the power of the death diagram in his right hand, Si Shiyu once again approached Qin Yu!

Qin Yu trembled violently in his heart, feeling an extreme sense of danger. This instinct made Qin Yu quickly step on the line word formula and retreat!

Si Shiyu snorted coldly. His eyes emitted a splendid radiance, making him look like a god of war. The death diagram transformed into a mark and slapped toward Qin Yu. He wanted to use this opportunity to suppress him!

This mark came from all directions and almost covered the whole of heaven and earth. No one could hide!

At this moment, Qin Yu saw an incredibly formidable and mysterious power from the mark. A pure dao technique was contained within this power!

Seeing this, the people in the surroundings exclaimed in shock.

“As expected of the Si family’s secret technique. It’s indeed terrifying,” someone exclaimed.

“Boom!”

The mark became even more intense, emitting a rumbling sound as if it was going to burst people’s eardrums.

Under the transformation by Si Shiyu, the mark became even more mysterious. All sorts of divine lights were circulating on it, making it look tremendously terrifying.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He knew that if he was not careful, he would be completely suppressed by the mark!

Thus he raised his head and chanted softly, activating the fighting word formula!

The fighting word formula was a truly supreme secret technique. It was mysterious and unpredictable. Even in the entire Holy Region, it was a top-notch existence!

With the support of the fighting word formula, the golden light on Qin Yu’s body became even brighter.

He knew well that he couldn’t dodge this mark. Thus he could only rely on the pure strength in his body to resist it.

At that moment, divine light circulated Qin Yu’s Golden Fist, and he also displayed the dao technique!

In the next second, Qin Yu roared and raised his combat strength to the extreme. He then soared into the sky and went straight for the mark!

“Boom!”

A deafening boom exploded at this moment. It was as if everything in the heavens and earth was about to be destroyed!

Qin Yu combined all his strength into one, and an incredibly powerful force emerged from his arms!

“Bang!”

At the moment of collision, the mark was shattered by Qin Yu’s punch!

Si Shiyu, holding the terrifying mark, was instantly severely injured. His body trembled, and finally, he felt something sweet in his chest and spat out a mouthful of blood!

At this moment, Qin Yu was wrapped in a golden light like a real god of war who had been awakened!

His expression was extremely cold, and his eyes were full of tremendous killing intent!

The onlookers were even more shocked when they saw this! They had never thought Qin Yu would have such a terrifying battle intent!

The onlookers in the distance had mixed feelings. Some were amazed by Qin Yu’s fearsomeness, while others were reluctant to accept the outcome.

Nangong was silent. He snorted and said, “It’s not embarrassing to lose to him.”

On the stage, the elders fixed their eyes on the battlefield.

It was undoubtedly a tremendously exciting battle. No one was willing to miss it.

“Speaking of which, Thunder Courtyard hasn’t had such an exciting battle for many years,” someone laughed and said, stroking his beard.

“That’s right. They’re evenly matched,” someone laughed and said.

Thunder Courtyard had nurtured such a talent, so the dean was naturally overjoyed and somewhat proud.

On the battlefield, Si Shiyu was still relying on the life diagram’s power to burst forth with strong vitality, slowly recovering his damaged body.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He knew he would lose this battle if he did not defeat Si Shiyu as soon as possible.

“As expected of the Si family’s disciple, you’re extraordinary,” Qin Yu said sincerely.

Si Shiyu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You’re not bad either, as expected of the chaotic body.”

“Then there’s no need to talk nonsense. Let’s fight.” Qin Yu shouted. He relied on the advancement brought by the fighting word formula to close in on Si Shiyu!

It was obvious that there would be a great battle between the two top-notch techniques.

At a glance, the two had exchanged hundreds of moves in the blink of an eye. The tremendously fast speed and powerful strength left people dumbfounded.

Qin Yu’s brandished his fist to the extreme. At a glance, it looked like a golden dragon dancing lightly and gracefully, as if it was going to break the sky.

The ground cracked, and the battlefield was reduced to ruins. Even the void shattered.

Everyone was staring at the battlefield, not daring to relax.

Qin Yu’s powerful strength was incredibly overbearing and grand. Nothing seemed to be able to stop him.

He possessed a tremendously powerful physique and incredibly terrifying strength. For a moment, Si Shiyu was in unbearable pain and kept retreating.

Even someone as formidable as Si Shiyu couldn’t withstand such pure and terrifying power.

While retreating, he used the terrifying power of the life-and-death diagram to whip Qin Yu.

However, this force was totally shattered by Qin Yu. For a moment, Si Shiyu seemed to have nowhere to escape!

Qin Yu raised his head and shouted. The powerful force in his right fist pressed down on Si Shiyu!

However, at this moment, Si Shiyu did not choose to dodge. On the contrary, he faced the attack head-on!

He opened his mouth slightly and spat out a mouthful of blood.

The blood was flowing with light, intertwining with dao techniques. In the next moment, it directly turned into divine light!

The divine light blocked Qin Yu. Before Qin Yu could react, the life-and-death diagram had left Si Shiyu’s palm!

...

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he instantly felt something was wrong!

He wanted to retreat, but it was too late!

The way interweaved by the divine light wrapped around Qin Yu, making him unable to escape.

The life-and-death diagram that separated from Si Shiyu’s palm blotted out the sky and crushed over. He wanted to suppress Qin Yu completely within the life-and-death diagram!

At a glance, the life-and-death diagram flickered with all kinds of terrifying dao techniques, displaying all sorts of magical powers. The previous terrifying rumble of the Great Dao sounded again!

“Boom!”

Finally, the life-and-death diagram fell. At that instant, Qin Yu seemed to be sucked into a terrifying space and disappeared without a trace!

“He’s been suppressed!” someone exclaimed.

“Qin Yu has been suppressed by the Si family’s life-and-death diagram.”

“In the end, the Si family is stronger!”

The Si family’s elder on the stage slammed the table in excitement and stood up. He laughed and said, “It is the Si family’s mysterious power. Si Shiyu is indeed a rare talent!”

...

Dean Lei stroked his beard, shook his head, and said, “It’s not certain yet. Don’t be anxious.”

In the life-and-death diagram, Qin Yu had been sucked into another horrible world.

Countless mysterious and strange figures intertwined with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu felt excruciating pain all over his body. Cracks appeared on his body as if he had been crushed by the powerful force of the life-and-death diagram!

A terrifying Great Dao rumbled around him. This sound struck directly at his primordial spirit as if it was going to shake Qin Yu’s divine sense!

Once it succeeded, even if he didn’t die, he would probably be deranged!
