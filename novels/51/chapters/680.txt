Chapter 681: The Masked Woman in the World!

Qin Yu felt his limbs go weak, and his buttocks fell to the ground.

“Qin Yu!” Xiao Yu ran over anxiously.

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly knitted. He tried to activate the internal qi in his body, but found that all the acupoints had been sealed, and he couldn’t move at all.

“This is the ice spirit divine needle of Han Palace. It can seal the acupoints of people,” the black-robed man said coldly.

“As long as you are hit by the Ice Spirit Needle, your internal qi will become weaker and weaker until you die.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He lay on the ground and his face quickly turned red.

However, Qin Yu wasn’t flustered at the moment. He tried his best to mobilize his internal qi in an attempt to break through the Ice Spirit Needle that had sealed the acupoints!

“What should we do with Qin Yu?” One of the black-robed men asked.

“Kill him. We can’t let this person live,” the other person said coldly.

Thus, the three of them immediately took large strides forward!

They held onto the Ice Spirit Needle in their hands and ruthlessly slammed it towards Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

The ground beneath their feet instantly collapsed! And beside Qin Yu, Xiao Yu was also affected and was directly sent flying!

This was a strike from Martial Marquises. It was definitely not something that a peak Inner Strength Grandmaster could withstand!

Under this attack, Xiao Yu’s flesh was torn apart, and his internal qi was weakened!

“Xiao Yu!” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

Gritting his teeth, he tried his best to mobilize the internal qi in his body to continue attacking his acupoints!

“He’s actually not dead.” Seeing that Qin Yu was unharmed, the three of them couldn’t help but frown.

“It’s said that this guy’s body is incomparably tough. It won’t be that easy to kill him.”

“Let’s hurry up and get the things. We can’t stay here for too long.”

Thus, a black-robed man immediately strode over.

He reached out and grabbed Xiao Yu by the neck, directly lifting her into the air.

“Speak, where’s the mask?” The black-robed man asked coldly.

Xiao Yu gritted her teeth and said word by word, “I... I won’t give it to you!”

“You won’t get a good ending for being stubborn,” the black-robed man said coldly.

The strength in his hand slowly increased, and Xiao Yu’s face immediately turned red!

She struggled desperately, but against Martial Marquises, all her strength wasn’t worth mentioning!

At this moment, Mr. Wu suddenly grabbed the kitchen knife and ruthlessly chopped the back of the black-robed man’s head!

With a bang, the kitchen knife was directly shattered!

“Let go of my daughter!” Mr. Wu roared angrily!

“Mr. Wu, hurry up and leave!” Qin Yu immediately became anxious!

Mr. Wu was just an ordinary person. He wouldn’t be able to hurt a Martial Marquises!

And a casual strike from a Martial Marquis could kill Mr. Wu!

The black-robed man slowly turned his body.

He looked at Mr. Wu coldly and said, “You don’t know your place!”

Then, the black-robed man waved his hand and slapped Mr. Wu!

Although it was just a casual slap, Mr. Wu was still sent flying!

This slap shattered Mr. Wu’s bones, and his body became limp and bloody!

Mr. Wu was lying on the ground. His body was covered in blood, and his face couldn’t be seen clearly.

“Let go of my daughter...” Mr. Wu said with difficulty, and then fainted.

His internal qi was rapidly draining away, and the aura of death appeared on his face!

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically when he saw this!

“We have to hurry up, or Mr. Wu will die for sure!” Qin Yu said anxiously!

“Hmph, a mayfly trying to shake a tree. You don’t know your place,” the black-robed man said coldly.

He raised his palm, and a ray of light condensed on his palm.

This ray of light was approaching Mr. Wu, and a terrifying power was rapidly brewing!

“Stop!” Qin Yu immediately became anxious when he saw this!

He gritted his teeth and desperately attacked the acupuncture points in his body!

But his speed was too slow, there was no time at all!

“Buzz!”

A ray of light shot out from the black-robed man’s hand and headed straight for Mr. Wu!

“Boom!”

The ground immediately collapsed!

Mr. Wu’s body was almost shattered!

“Dad!!!”

Xiao Yu’s eyes immediately widened!

She stared blankly in Mr. Wu’s direction as bean-sized tears flowed out from her eyes!

Mr. Wu opened his eyes with great difficulty. He opened his mouth, as if he wanted to say something, but the injuries on his body already made him unable to even open his mouth.

Mr. Wu’s raised palm slowly fell down. His internal qi suddenly stopped at this moment.

“Dad!!!”

Xiao Yu’s pained voice cut through the silent night!

The expression on her face slowly became ferocious!

“I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you!!” Xiao Yu screamed, and the entire house suddenly began to tremble!

“Huh?” the black-robed men immediately frowned.

“Rumble...”

The ground was trembling, as if it was shaking! It was as if something was about to rush out!

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, a loud sound suddenly rang out, and then the room collapsed!

A mask that was flickering with a dark light flew out from the room!

“Mask! It’s this mask!” The three black-robed men were overjoyed! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

They threw Xiao Yu aside and ran towards the mask!

However, the mask flew directly towards Xiao Yu and stuck tightly onto her face!

“What... What’s going on?” The three black-robed men’s expressions changed drastically!

Xiao Yu’s body slowly floated into the air. An extremely sinister aura quickly swept towards Xiao Yu!

Her figure floated in the air, and her every movement carried an icy cold killing intent!

At this moment, Xiao Yu’s face was covered by a mask, and only a pair of icy cold eyes could be seen.

Her eyes were filled with contempt, and from her condescending gaze, she seemed to be looking down on ants.

The extreme killing intent from her body made people tremble!

Qin Yu’s eyes immediately widened!

This figure was almost exactly the same as that of the masked woman that Qin Yu saw in the Immortal Slaying Sect!

“Xiao Yu and the masked woman... are indeed related!” Qin Yu exclaimed in shock!

Could it be that Xiao Yu was really the reincarnation of the masked woman? Their figures were simply too similar!

Xiao Yu looked coldly at the three black-robed men. Her ice-cold killing intent couldn’t help but make people feel uneasy.

The three black-robed men looked at Xiao Yu and frowned.

For some reason, they felt an indescribable fear in their hearts!

Even though there was no internal qi surging from Xiao Yu’s body, it still made people feel uneasy.

“What’s going on? How did the mask fly onto her face?” One of the black-robed men said in a deep voice.

“What a charlatan! I don’t care what the reason is. Let’s kill her first!” The black-robed men gritted their teeth and strode toward Xiao Yu!
