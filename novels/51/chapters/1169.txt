Chapter 1170: Chapter 1,170, the battle between a divine weapon and a divine weapon 

Half of his arm seemed to have been broken, and his waist was slightly bent as he stood there, panting heavily.

Qin Yu’s feet stepped on the ‘xing’character, and he quickly caught up.

The people of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion didn’t want to miss this moment, and they all stepped forward to follow.

Qin Yu stood in front of Gu Xinghe, and a golden chain flew out from his palm, binding Gu Xinghe.

With just two punches, Gu Xinghe couldn’t take it anymore. God knew how powerful Qin Yu’s third punch would be.

“Qin Yu... you deserve to die...”Gu Xinghe was extremely unwilling. His “Great Undertaking”was about to be completed, but it was destroyed by Qin Yu again!

He panted heavily, his eyes full of unwillingness. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Do you still want to resist?”Qin Yu asked coldly.

Gu Xinghe opened his mouth and said, “If I stop now, can I still exchange for another life?”

“No.”Qin Yu shook his head.

“You’ve killed so many people. Even if you die ten times, it’s still not enough.”

At this moment, the corners of Gu Xinghe’s mouth suddenly curled into a sneer.

He stretched out his remaining arm and suddenly grabbed towards the void.

This hand actually shattered the void!

His hand reached into the void, as if he wanted to pull out some divine weapon!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. Before he could react, Gu Xinghe had already pulled out a divine weapon!

This was a rusty iron rod. There were marks on the iron rod, as if it was telling of its proud battle achievements.

An ancient aura was emitted from the iron rod. Internal Qi was surging, and a heavy aura fell from the top, creating huge craters on the ground.

The moment the Iron Rod was pulled out, Qin Yu felt extremely uneasy!

It looked like an ordinary iron rod, but the strong holy aura made people not dare to look at it directly!

“What is this thing?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Gu Xinghe sneered, “Although I don’t know its origin, I know that this thing is indestructible. It is an ancient great cultivator’s item!”

“Qin Yu, do you really think... that I will just sit and wait for Death!”

Gu Xinghe suddenly roared. He grabbed the iron rod with one hand and swept it over!

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent and hurriedly clenched his fist to meet the attack.

However, the moment he touched it, Qin Yu felt that something was wrong.

This iron rod was too hard. Even Qin Yu’s physical body was directly swept away!

Just the hardness of the iron rod itself far surpassed Qin Yu’s current physical body!

“Hahahaha!”Gu Xinghe laughed out loud.

“My father has controlled the martial arts association of Jingdu for many years. How could he not have something in his possession!”

Su Qi, who was watching the battle from afar, furrowed her brows tightly.

This iron rod was truly extraordinary. That heavy and oppressive feeling made everyone extremely uncomfortable.

“Whoosh!”

Gu Xinghe swung his rod again. Relying on his void technique, the iron rod shuttled through space and instantly arrived in front of Qin Yu. There was nowhere to hide!

“Bang!”

This rod smashed into Qin Yu’s chest, directly shattering Qin Yu’s true body of azure wood. His physical body flew back several hundred meters, and his sternum was also shattered!

Gu Xinghe seemed to have gone mad. He held the iron rod in his hand and hacked down with force. The earth instantly collapsed, as if it was going to split the Earth’s crust into two!

“Whoosh!”

The iron rod attacked again. Qin Yu clenched his fists many times, but every time he touched it, Qin Yu’s bones were shattered!

“What on Earth is this thing! ?”Qin Yu was extremely shocked. Ever since he stepped into the cultivation path, he had never seen such a terrifying divine weapon!

“This won’t do. If this continues, I will be smacked to death by him!”

Qin Yu secretly felt that things were not good. He hurriedly took out his bronze sword and planned to use it to meet the attack.

“Swish!”

The iron rod swept across the world. This was the strength of the iron rod itself, and it could crush everything in the world!

Qin Yu held the bronze sword in his hand. His internal Qi surged as he held the sword to meet the Attack!

“Clang!”

A crisp sound rang out! Cracks appeared on the bronze sword in Qin Yu’s hand.

“Crack!”

In the next second, the bronze sword was directly shattered into pieces!

“How is this possible!”

Qin Yu looked at the bronze sword in his hand, which only had the hilt left, and felt his heart skip a beat!

What kind of background did this iron rod have? It was actually so terrifying!

“Hahahaha!”Gu Xinghe laughed excitedly. He slammed the iron rod on the ground and shouted, “I have a peerless divine weapon. Let’s see how you can defeat me!”

At this moment, Qin Yu had no idea. With the iron rod, Qin Yu was no match for Gu Xinghe!

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, Gu Xinghe’s figure suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu!

“What are you hiding for?”Gu Xinghe revealed a cruel and strange smile.

The iron rod in his hand had already struck from a few hundred meters away, aiming straight for Qin Yu’s head!

“Not good!”Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! At such a distance, there was no way he could escape!

He closed his eyes and waited for the judgment of fate.

“Weng!”

But right at this moment, Qin Yu’s spatial artifact suddenly emitted a radiance. An extremely ancient and simple landscape painting that was like a piece of parchment floated out and faced the iron rod!

“Boom!”

A violent collision spread out! The aftershock that was like the explosion of a nuclear bomb turned a radius of several hundred meters into a white blaze!

Qin Yu was directly sent flying by this aftershock, and his body started to crack!

Gu Xinghe wasn’t any better either. His iron rod broke away, and he was also sent flying!
