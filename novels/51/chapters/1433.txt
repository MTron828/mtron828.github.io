Chapter 1434: Chapter 1,434, recovery of spiritual power 1

Di Zun remained unmoved and continued to look at the great elder coldly.

With Di Zun’s current abilities, he was naturally not the great elder’s ability. However, he still did not have the slightest intention of backing down.

The Great Elder’s expression became increasingly gloomy and his entire body was emitting surging killing intent.

“Since you are seeking death, then don’t blame me!”

The Great Elder roared angrily, and his aura instantly erupted.

He walked towards Di Zun, and the people around him hurriedly stopped the great elder and said, “Great Elder, you absolutely mustn’t. The sect master has already said that you can’t kill Di Zun...”

The Great Elder’s body shook violently, and the people around him scattered.

“Whoever stops me today will die with him!”The great elder shouted angrily.

Seeing that the great elder was serious, no one dared to stop him.

The great elder directly raised the disc phenomenon behind him and charged at Di Zun!

No one expected that the great elder would use his trump card and face his own people!

“Rumble...”

The disc phenomenon was like a meteorite that came crashing down, shaking the entire heavenly cloud sect.

Di ZUN’s expression was solemn, as if he was facing a great enemy. His muscles tensed up as he unleashed his most powerful battle strength.

Even so, he was still insignificant in front of the disc phenomenon.

Although di Zun was extremely talented, he had entered cultivation too late, so how could he be a match for the Great Elder?

Before long, Di Zun was crushed by the disc phenomenon.

His body collapsed, his body cracked, blood flowed, and his life force was rapidly disappearing.

Looking at Di Zun who was lying on the ground, the people around him hurriedly walked forward and pleaded, “First Elder, stop. Di Zun will die if we continue fighting!”

First Elder’s face was cold. A moment later, the huge disc phenomenon slowly disappeared.

However, Di Zun was already lying on the ground and almost fainted.

“You don’t know whether to live or die.”First Elder walked to Di Zun and said coldly.

“I’ll only teach you a small lesson this time. If you dare to stop me again, I’ll kill you!”

Then, the first elder looked at Zhen Yue again.

He looked at Zhen Yue, who was hanging up, and a cold smile appeared on his face.

Zhen Yue was covered in blood, his aura was weak, and his body was covered in wounds.

The first elder, who had lived for a long time, didn’t know what it meant to be kind to women. He only knew that he would sacrifice everything to achieve his goal!

“Let’s start with you.”The light on the great elder’s finger lit up again.

Then, the great elder raised his finger and pointed at Zhen Yue.

Di Zun, who was lying on the ground, was stunned. He tried to get up desperately, but the wounds on his body made him unable to move.

“No! !”

Di Zun shouted with all his strength. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

But nothing could stop the great elder at this moment.

The light landed between Zhen Yue’s eyebrows, and a trace of fear flashed in Zhen Yue’s eyes. In the next second, her pupils turned gray.

“No! ! !”Di Zun’s face was full of pain, and tears kept flowing down his face.

He had promised Qin Yu that he would take good care of Zhen Yue and the others, but he didn’t expect it to end like this.

Looking at Zhen Yue’s corpse, the first elder didn’t show any emotion on his face.

“This is just the beginning. If Qin Yu doesn’t show up, everyone who is related to him will die,”the first elder said viciously.

The people around him didn’t say anything. No one dared to say anything.

...

Qin Yu, who was rushing toward the divine capital city, suddenly felt his right eyelid twitch.

This made Qin Yu, who was rushing forward, stop in his tracks.

“Eh?”Qin Yu rubbed his eyelid. He suddenly had a bad feeling.

He stood there in silence for a long time before continuing his journey.

Although he did not know what had happened, Qin Yu had a very bad feeling in his heart.

This made Qin Yu, who was already anxious, speed up again.

After spending a few days, Qin Yu finally arrived at the divine capital.

At this moment, the divine capital was like a real city.

The previous decadence was swept away, replaced by a trace of prosperity.

Qin Yu quickly stepped into the divine capital city. As soon as he entered, someone noticed Qin Yu.

“Greetings, City Lord!”Someone cupped his hands.

“City Lord Qin, you’re back!”

“City Lord, you’re finally back. We thought something happened to you.”

Everyone surrounded him. Everyone was filled with gratitude towards Qin Yu.

After Qin Yu greeted everyone, he quickly walked forward.

He rushed all the way to the back of the mountain and found a place where no one was around.

Then, Qin Yu took out the jade clear bottle.

Qin Yu did not waste any time. He opened the jade clear bottle and began to absorb the life energy.

Traces of Aura entered Qin Yu’s body through his nose. Then, it flowed through his entire body at an extremely fast speed.

As the life energy flowed into his body, Qin Yu’s body slowly changed.

This was not a long process. In just a few minutes, the life Qi in the jade clear bottle was completely absorbed.

His body slowly emitted traces of light.

This light was the golden color that he had not seen for a long time.
