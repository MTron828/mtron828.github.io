Chapter 2797: Discipline

At this moment, a person like him had appeared.

The young swordsman could not gain the slightest advantage when fighting against the ‘self’ that was derived from the Night Qi.

Although the two cultivation methods were different, the cultivation technique that Qin Yu used just now was much more profound. “This move seems to have room for change.”

Qin Yu muttered.

As he willed it, the young man in front of him changed.

The Night Qi dripped onto the ground like boiling water. Ominous crows circled around.

They let out a strange howl and their red eyes flickered with an unsettling cold light.

Dozens of crows landed on the body of the young swordsman’s Nightmare. A Nightmare appeared in his sea of consciousness.

He quietly looked at the thing he feared the most in the countless dreams.

Nothing could be concealed in the dream.

The Nightmares’ attacks suddenly became sharp. The sword force carried a power that terrified the true body.

He was completely torn into pieces. When his body was swept up again, the Nightmare tore him apart again.

The indifferent Nightmare stared at him.

It would use sword techniques to ruthlessly tear him into pieces whenever his body materialized.

Why was this power so endless?

It seemed to be able to draw upon the power of the Nineteenth Prison. How was this possible? Wasn’t this place a sealed space?

In just a breath, countless thoughts were swimming in his mind.

Many solutions surged into his sea of consciousness. He frantically deduced the Night Qi.

One had to know that the power of the Dao of Dreams was very obscure and difficult to understand. Although Qin Yu had spent a huge amount of time, he still could not make any breakthroughs.

But this time, he had a sudden epiphany for some reason.

All kinds of thoughts flooded into his sea of consciousness like a fountain.

In this state, the Night Qi gradually filled his entire body.

Then, it slowly dripped down, forming a large area of the illusory swamp. Countless crows were circling in the air. The entire scene looked very strange.

“What’s going on here? Why do I feel so much stronger?”

Qin Yu did not feel the slightest joy from the increase in strength.

Everyone had their limits. This was a person’s talent.

Different people had different boundary values, but he seemed to have increased this value countless times.

In other words, was he still him?

He originally wanted to comprehend the true body other than the Investiture of Gods as he improved.

However, this connection was weakened. “I have to think of a way to escape from here!”

An idea had just formed in Qin Yu’s mind.

A surge of energy suddenly rushed into Qin Yu’s body. That energy instantly tore his entire body apart.

Then, all the memories in his divine sense were shattered by this energy.

All his memories were crushed inch by inch.

Qin Yu had never seen such pain before.

He even bit his gums and his body twitched uncontrollably under the pain.

One had to know that his divine soul had once experienced the pain of the extreme realm when he met the Nightmare.

His divine soul’s tolerance for pain was probably stronger than those who were a few realms higher than him.

But at this moment, Qin Yu felt a deep fear under this power.

After an unknown period, Qin Yu’s arms could not help but tremble.

He did not dare to think about the question from before. He had a rough guess that the question had triggered some kind of taboo and punishment in the Investiture of Gods.

“Oh, you have walked out of the punishment so quickly! It seems that your foundation is not bad.”

As Qin Yu’s imagination ran wild, a voice came from behind him.

Qin Yu was shocked. The power of the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze condensed into a black dragon.

The person behind him was completely torn apart. A figure appeared in front of Qin Yu amidst the smoke.

He slowly sat down. He seemed to have no intention of attacking.

“Smoker Xie.”

Qin Yu’s body slowly relaxed.

Qin Yu asked after a long silence.

“How long have you been here?”

“I forgot. I’m too lazy to remember as well.”

Smoker Xie laughed at himself.

“You give me a familiar feeling. My true body must have met you before.”

He said something inexplicable.

“Can you still contact your true body?”

“I couldn’t do that for a long time, but the Investiture of Gods opened the passage when it encountered a predicament this time. It gave me a chance to sense the past. Therefore, I’m very curious about who came in. However, there wasn’t anyone that surprised me. When I violated the precepts before, I fell into a trance for nearly three months before I recovered. You actually recovered so quickly. Your strength is also very strange. I think I can observe you.” Smoker Xie said as he observed the power around Qin Yu.

While Qin Yu was still in deep thought, traces of black power appeared on his hand.

Night Qi!

Qin Yu was greatly shocked. Even the strongest Holy Lord in the outside world could not control this kind of power.

However, Smoker Xie was able to deduce a trace of power in this short period of observation.

The power within was still far from his Night Qi.

However, at least he had a clue. As long as he was given time, he might be able to master this power. “I can play for a while more.” Smoker Xie smiled.

“What level of existence are you at here?”

Qin Yu guessed that there were some terrifying things, but he did not dare to ask directly.

“Smart question. An ant in the Saint Kingdom, the sand in the lake, the grass on the planet, something like that.”

Smoker Xie showed a look of admiration.

“Has someone once… left this place?”

Qin Yu suddenly felt a sharp pain that was dozens of times more terrifying than before just when he finished speaking.

From the depths of his bone marrow, his body had already shattered into a ball of flesh that was twitching crazily in the blink of an eye.

After nearly ten days, Qin Yu’s body slowly recovered.

At this moment, his entire body was twitching and he couldn’t even stand up.

Smoker Xie hadn’t left yet. He was fighting with a Nightmare that he had created.

“Haha! You can still recover very quickly. Your divine soul is very powerful! Many people suffered from this commandment and their bodies could not recover for nearly a hundred years.”

Qin Yu revealed a self-deprecating expression. He had already roughly figured out some of the rules here.

They could not think of a way to escape from this Investiture of Gods.

Once they had this thought, they would suffer the torture from before.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

It was unknown what kind of power was used to execute this torture. It was likely that even people with boundless divine souls could not endure it..
