Chapter 2558 The Myriad Manifestations Gaze

He clasped his hands behind his back and gestured at Xuan Feng.

“Whoosh!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

A sharp sword energy, swift as the wind, was unleashed from Xuan Feng’s hand.

Demon Sealing!

Almost at the same time, Xuan Feng pointed out.

The finger grew larger instantly as he stabbed out and arrived before Xuan Xin.

The unique satin wrapping around his fingers suddenly loosened and rolled toward Xuan Xin’s body.

Dense runes and incantations were carved on them, and a powerful sealing force engulfed Xuan Xin.

This power was enough to seal someone at the Tribulation Fifth level. Xuan Lan sneered.

“Martial Uncle, get lost! I won’t remind you again.”

A streak of sword intent cut through the five strands of sealing satin and then shattered the oncoming sword energy completely.

Xuan Xin’s hand slightly moved, and a terrifying wound appeared on Xuan Feng’s chest.

He turned to look at Xuan Lan. An incredibly sharp sensation was pressing against Xuan Lan’s throat.

“Martial Nephew Xuan Xin! Don’t be rash! I was merely joking!”

Xuan Lan’s face was ashen. He quickly let go of the magic sword in his hand and explained loudly.

In an instant, his face was as pale as all his blood had been drawn. He did not underestimate his opponent at all. The Demon Sealing Finger was the ultimate sealing technique he could use. He did not expect Xuan Xin to break the Demon Sealing Finger with just sword intent.

“This guy seems to have obtained Zi Yang’s inheritance. This sword intent is very different from previously!”

a few of them.

Xuan Xin withdrew the Green Duckweed Sword and sat down expressionlessly.

Suddenly, numerous mountain peaks in the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect erupted with countless bright lights, exploding again.

Most of these magical artifacts, talismans, and elixirs were priceless supreme treasures that they might not be able to obtain in their lifetime.

At this moment, such supreme treasures filled the entire Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

“Chen Shuang, did you do all this? The monster race is about to arrive. Aren’t you weakening the strength of our Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect by doing this at this point?”

An elder with long white eyebrows roared angrily.

“That’s right, Chen Shuang. Even if you want to bring out these treasures, you should distribute them among the suitable disciples, not detonated directly, encouraging them to fight. What’s your intention in doing this?”

The other middle-aged man in a Daoist robe was also puzzled.

Chen Shuang was like a wooden statue. After a long time, he shook his head slightly and looked at the sky with a bitter smile.

“Did Zi Yang trigger these formations?”

The long brow Elder Xuan Ming’s body trembled, and his voice could

not help but tremble.

“The Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect is Zi Yang’s entanglements. As long as these entanglements are reduced, he will grow increasingly stronger. In the end, he might even kill me and raze this place to the ground.”

At this moment, the dark clouds rapidly approaching the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect seemed to have become denser as the blood continued to fall from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

Qin Yu, at this point, was completely immersed in the world of desolate divine eye. He was completely unaware of everything that was happening in the outside world.

When all the elemental energy in his body was about to be exhausted, the Seal of Heaven Returning in his body suddenly erupted with intense holy light.

The terrifying holy qi of origin entered the desolate divine eye. Qin Yu seemed to have heard the sound of an eggshell cracking.

The desolate divine eye suddenly shattered, and another completely different pupil suddenly appeared on Qin Yu’s forehead.

At this moment, his eyes shone with a deep and scorching light like the twinkling stars in the boundless starry sky. Nine rings of different colors were in the pupils like rainbows in the sky.

With the appearance of this eye, the entire world changed drastically before his eyes again.

He saw his soaring cosmic luck on the mountain. Not only his, but he could also pry the cosmic luck of almost everyone in the entire Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

At this moment, countless obscure and intricate Ways of Rules seemed to have vividly revealed the mysteries and regular patterns of its operation.

He could perceive and understand the operation of the various ways. At this moment, he was staring at that layer of the Cage of the Path of Heaven. His gaze actually slowly passed through this cage, and he saw the scene outside.
