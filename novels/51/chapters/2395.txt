2396 Tribulation Transcending Stage

Coupled with the Immortal Emperor Lei’s trial in the immortal grave, the strength of his Glazed Holy Body had been further strengthened.

Qin Yu was immersed in this kind of comprehension. His rules of thunder were also improving at a terrifying speed.

Lei Xin watched Qin Yu improve rapidly from a distance. The corner of his lips could not help but curl into a smile.

“How is it? He should have obtained the Heart of Thunder. Are you jealous?”

Flower Granny cracked a rare joke.

“I am, of course, but I also know I will remain this way for the rest of my life. There won’t be any more miracles. But Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue, Teng Zixu, and Jue Wu are different. They have greater potential, and we’re just doing our best to protect these sparks of talent.”

Lei Xin said with a smile.

The seven-colored lights had fully spread out at this moment, and the Path of Heaven suddenly fully released.

On the Flower Peak, a terrifying power descended.

Yan Ruoxue was like a butterfly. Her body shuttled through space, and a massive white lotus throne bloomed beneath her body.

“As expected of the person who obtained the most bloodline of Immortal Emperor Tianming. I only guided her a little, and she immediately understood. She should be condensing the Soul Statue at this moment. Moreover, her spatial qi should be even purer than Yan Tianshi’s.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A hint of amazement flashed in Flower Granny’s eyes.

This meant that Yan Ruoxue had comprehended a more central position in the sea of the Path of Heaven, and her comprehension of the Way of Space was deeper than Yan Tianshi’s.

In the distance, the sky of the entire Holy Region seemed to have turned gloomy. Almost everyone in Thunder Courtyard could smell the gloomy aura.

“Thunder tribulation? That seems to be the direction of the Teng family?”

Lei Xin frowned and looked at the endless thunderclouds.

“As expected of the heaven’s chosen son, Teng Zixu. He almost could break through instantly. Who can match such talent? It’s just that he’s destined not to be able to jump out of the Path of Heaven.”

Flower Granny shook her head.

“How can it not be an honor to be the number one person under the Path of Heaven? Immortal Emperors have not emerged for several years of Path of Heaven.”

Thunderclouds gradually filled the entire heaven and earth, and every part of the Holy Region was flickering with the aura of destruction.

In the Teng family, a smile appeared on the face of Teng Zixu, who was facing the world extinguishing thunder tribulation.

His body transformed into a saber and entered the thunderclouds directly.

Under the shocked gazes of countless people, Teng Zixu stopped in front of the thundercloud and gently stretched out his hand to touch it.

In an instant, the thundercloud entered Teng Zixu’s body. The sky suddenly cleared up as if everything had just happened was an illusion.

“Boom!”

In Thunder Courtyard, an enormous tribulation cloud appeared again.

Yan Ruoxue was also about to undergo her tribulation!

Even Flower Granny and Lei Xin were shocked. They did not expect Yan Ruoxue to have such a significant power reserve. She was second to Teng Zixu in transcending tribulation.

“What a terrifying girl! Her talent is not inferior to Teng Zixu. Yan Tianshi’s heart will ache for her.”

Flower Granny laughed softly.

Unlike Teng Zixu, Yan Ruoxue’s thunderclouds accumulated tremendously slowly. The thunderclouds that filled the sky moved slowly and were as heavy as a millstone weighing over ten thousand pounds.

Lei Xin and Flower Granny’s expressions suddenly changed, and they disappeared into the distance.

“Holy Lord Yao, Holy Lord Jiang, and Holy Lord Yun, what’s the matter?”

Lei Xin stared coldly at the group of people in front of him.

“We heard that Dean Lei has reached an agreement with the Yan and Si families, but what about the other families? Does Dean Lei think that the other families can be easily manipulated?”

Holy Lord Yao looked at the tribulation clouds, and a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.

The Yao family had already fallen out with Qin Yu. Since Yan Ruoxue had been expelled from the Yan family and was Qin Yu’s people, it would be best to destroy her here. Otherwise, the Yao family would have another great enemy in times to come.

“Just tell me what you want.”

Anger flashed on Lei Xin’s face, and he clenched his fists fiercely.

He had come to Thunder Courtyard to extort twice in a row. Did he really think that he could be easily manipulated?

“Qin Yu killed so many people of our family in purgatory, so he has to pay the price. We’ll be fine if he hands over the Jee family’s treasures, or else it’ll be very difficult for us to settle the matter peacefully today.”

Holy Lord Jiang’s eyes flickered as he casually glanced at the two people around him.

“Presumptuous! Thunderclaps of Hundred Directions!”

A hundred people from Thunder Courtyard attacked suddenly. An enormous pentagram was formed on the ground. The thunder dragon was swimming in the pentagram, growing increasingly bigger.

The three family heads instantly attacked. Three Emperor Weapons with world-destroying power blasted onto the formation directly.

The power of the celestial artifacts was unrivaled. Countless cracks appeared on the ground of the entire Thunder Courtyard.

Nearly a hundred people from Thunder Courtyard who set up the formation were sent flying backward. Many of them were severely injured straight away by the attack.

“You’re courting death!”

Lei Xin let out a furious roar. His body turned into a bolt of lightning and appeared among the three.

Lei Xin engaged in a fierce battle with the three family heads, and Flower Granny Hua joined in almost at the same time.

Although they were stronger than the three individually, the other party knew they were no match for two against three. They focused on fighting, and for a moment, they were actually in a stalemate.

“Thunder Courtyard’s main force is the hundred people who set up the formation. You guys charge in and kill Qin Yu. Yan Ruoxue is in her weakest state now. Go and capture her directly!”

Holy Lord Yao roared at the crowd behind him.

Cold lights flickered on his face. They did not expect the Yan and Si families to have reached an agreement with Thunder Courtyard.

The three family heads naturally had to join forces to get some benefits at least.

If possible, it would be best if they could destroy Thunder courtyard in one fell swoop and seize the things inside, as well as the treasures on Qin Yu’s body.

Yao Xi laughed sinisterly as he charged into Flower Peak.

“Yan Ruoxue, you slut! Do you want to break through? I will strip you naked and throw you to Qin Yu when you die. Let’s see his expression then!”

Thinking about how he was defeated in Qin Yu’s hands time and time again, Yao Xi had gone crazy!

He would have inner demons for the rest of his life if Qin Yu did not die and could not reach the sea of the Path of Heaven to advance to the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

“Stop! You’re not allowed to disturb Senior Sister Yan!”

Zhao Wan Er shouted angrily. The soft sword in her hand stabbed Yao Xi like a poisonous snake.

“Get lost!”

Yao Xi pushed out his hands and punched out. A big hole appeared in Zhao Wan ‘er’s chest straightaway.

Even though she was Flower Granny’s disciple, her cultivation realm was far inferior to Yao Xi’s. This attack had caused her to be on the verge of death.

“Stop!”

Jiu Xiao roared in rage. He was the first to receive the news and had rushed over from Demon-slaying Peak.

Purple Thunder Heavenly Dragon!

He formed a hand seal with both hands and lightning and thunder appeared all over the surface of his body, emitting a tremendous electric crackling sound.
