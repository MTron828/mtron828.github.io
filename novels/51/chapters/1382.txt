Chapter 1383: Chapter 1,383, legends of the Southern Region 1

Sister Lin picked up a piece of meat with her chopsticks and said, “My friend told me this news. He said that he will set off in half a month to search for the water of life.”

“I came here this time to tell you that I want you to be prepared in advance,”said sister Lin.

“Half a month...”Qin Yu whispered.

In other words, Qin Yu could go to the heavenly cloud sect again if he counted the distance.

“Okay, half a month is just right. But... is the news accurate? Is Your Friend Reliable?”Qin Yu asked.

Sister Lin rolled her eyes at Qin Yu and said, “If he was not reliable, would I have come all the way here to tell you? Little Bastard, you actually suspect me?”

Qin Yu said somewhat awkwardly, “Sorry, I was too cautious.”

Sister Lin was obviously joking. She pointed at the food on the table and said, “Hurry up and eat.”

Qin Yu did not have the mood to eat. All he could think about was the water of life.

The life energy could change the number on Qin Yu’s forehead from ten to nine, from nine to eight, and the water of life was even denser. The effect must be even more astonishing!

“If I can get the water of life, I might be able to directly recover my spirit energy,”Qin Yu thought to herself.

In Qin Yu’s current state, once she recovered her spirit energy, not only would she possess even greater strength, she could even take the opportunity to break through to the Almighty Realm!

“Phew.”Qin Yu’s heart grew increasingly excited, and her eyes were filled with anticipation.

“Are you used to being here? Did you encounter any trouble?”At this moment, sister Lin suddenly asked.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Very good. Boss Zheng has taken good care of me. By the way, what’s your relationship with boss Zheng?”

Sister Lin rolled her eyes and said, “It’s just a friendship. Why are you asking so many questions?”

Qin Yu pursed her lips and didn’t say anything more.

After eating this meal, sister Lin was ready to leave.

After the door of the private room opened, Qin Yu was surprised to find that boss Zheng was still outside the door.

When he saw sister Lin, boss Zheng hurriedly walked up.

“Sister Lin, are you done chatting?”Boss Zheng said with some anticipation.

Sister Lin smiled and said, “Yes, I’m done chatting. Thank you for your hospitality, boss Zheng.”

Boss Zheng opened his mouth to say something, but sister Lin beat him to it and said, “Boss Zheng, I have something to rush back to the auction, so I won’t stay any longer. I’ll leave my brother to you.”

Boss Zheng’s words were stuck in his throat.

He said awkwardly, “Okay, okay. No problem. Leave it to me!”

Sister Lin Glanced at Qin Yu and smiled. “Don’t forget to look for me in a few days.”

“Don’t worry,”Qin Yu agreed.

Then, Qin Yu and boss Zheng watched sister Lin leave.

Boss Zheng’s eyes looked in sister Lin’s direction, as if his mood had left with sister Lin.

Qin Yu also saw the relationship between boss Zheng and sister Lin. She could only say that licking a dog was really F * cking awesome!

“Yan Qin, are you going to the auction in a few days?”Boss Zheng patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, Sister Lin is looking for me for something.”

Boss Zheng didn’t say anything. No one knew what he was thinking about.

Then, he turned around and returned to anfeng tower.

“Water of life...”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice. She couldn’t help but look forward to it.

In two days, it would be the supply day for the Heavenly Cloud sect. Qin Yu planned to take this opportunity to look for Di Zun.

The next day.

Qin Yu planned to stroll around the Heavenly Cloud sect.

After all, this was a top-tier city with top-tier resources. It would be a pity if she didn’t take this opportunity to see it.

‘If I’m lucky, I might even be able to see life energy here,’Qin Yu thought to herself. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

At this moment, Ding Yi walked out from inside.

She sized up Qin Yu and asked, “Who was that girl yesterday?”

“My... cousin,”Qin Yu Lied.

Ding Yi snorted and said, “Another guanxi.”

“Guanxi? Have you seen Guanxi go to work?”Qin Yu rolled her eyes.

Ding Yi waved his hand impatiently. She obviously didn’t want to argue with Qin Yu about this.

“Where are you going?”Ding Yi changed the subject.

“I’m planning to go out for a walk and see if I can find any treasures.”Qin Yu didn’t hide anything.

“That’s good. I’m planning to go out too. Come with me.”Ding Yi didn’t say anything and pulled Qin Yu along.

Qin Yu frowned. “Where are you going?”

Ding Yi said, “A good place. The largest library in the entire South Province.”

“Library?”Qin Yu was startled. “You have the habit of Reading?”

“Reading changes one’s fate,”Ding Yi said. “If I wasn’t educated, I wouldn’t have had the chance to work here.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be speechless. She hadn’t expected to hear such a familiar sentence in the holy region.

“What’s in the Library?”Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

“What else can it be? It’s nothing more than recording some legends of the southern region. It’s also a public technique that everyone can learn,”Ding Yi said.

“If it wasn’t for this, I wouldn’t have stayed in this lousy place.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin. This was a good place to go.

It just so happened that Qin Yu didn’t know much about the southern region, so he might as well take this opportunity to learn about it.
