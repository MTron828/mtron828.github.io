2303 The Monster Race

“Its life force is indeed so tenacious! What’s this? It doesn’t look like a demon race either.”

“Does this thing look like a monster race?”

Elder Guai’s voice came from the Sumeru ring.

“Monster race? I don’t think I’ve seen it in this galaxy before,” Qin Yu asked curiously.

“The monster race is located in a lower-level galaxy. Previously, when the monster race invaded, it caused a monstrous slaughter. As a result, the human race and the demon race joined forces to suppress the monster race in that polar galaxy. Rightfully, the monster race should not have appeared here.”

Elder Guai’s expression was somewhat ugly.

“This should be the lowest level of the monster race. I hope I’m overthinking it. Otherwise, once the monster race descends again, I’m afraid this galaxy will become a deadly land again.”

Qin Yu did not have much of a concept of the monster race because even his father’s memories did not seem to leave any information about the monster race.

“Forget it. Let’s go back first. Xiao Yu’s current situation can’t drag on.”

Qin Yu shook his head. He would consult Elder Guai about this matter after refining the Paramita Pill.

Qin Yu returned to the place where the little girl was just now. The little girl paced back and forth on the spot, her hands clutching the corner of her clothes tightly.

“That’s great! Big Brother, you’re fine!”

Seeing Qin Yu, the little girl revealed a delighted expression.

“Of course, Big Brother is very powerful. I’ll take you home and you show me the way.”

Qin Yu smiled and patted the little girl’s head. He placed the little girl on the warship and then sailed toward the little girl’s village.

“This ship is so fast. I might have to walk for a long time!”

The little girl exclaimed.

Soon, Qin Yu brought the little girl to her village.

It was an exceptionally shabby village hidden deep in the mountains. There was an immense waterfall at the village’s entrance that covered the internal qi of the people. The village was so remote that even wild beasts might not find its location.

In the village, there were only 20 to 30 people. Most of them were ordinary people without spiritual power.

The little girl looked at Qin Yu. In her eyes, Qin Yu was an omnipotent god. She killed the wolf without even moving his body. Now that she saw Qin Yu leaving, she could not help but feel a little disappointed.

Qin Yu said after hesitating for a moment. He wanted to bring them to the Black Platform Continent, but he could not tell if it was good or bad for the 20 to 30 ordinary people of the village to go there.

To Qin Yu’s surprise, the little girl declined after thinking for a long time.

“Now, many people in the village can’t walk anymore. Here, we can still barely eat and keep ourselves warm. I’m very happy to stay together with the grandfathers and grandmothers in the village.”

“Alright!”

Qin Yu infused a strand of chaotic power into the little girl’s body and helped her open up all her meridians.

“These ten jars of pills are called Xuan Yuan Pills. Take one pill a day and start hunting after three days.”

Qin Yu said with a smile and gave the little girl a soft armor and a dagger.

If she did not provoke those high-level demonic beasts, these things should be good enough to protect the little girl’s safety.

…

He returned to the eighth level of purgatory.

“Enemies often cross each other’s path.”

Qin Yu stared at the three people with powerful internal qi opposite him.

It was Xing Mou.

There was also a giant with a height of three meters or so. His yellow bulging muscles showed that he contained an explosive internal qi.

There was also a person wrapped in black fog. Qin Yu actually could not see his appearance with a sweep of his divine sense.

“It’s you again. I forgot to introduce you. These are my new teammates, Wu Shan and Ying Zi.”

Xing Mou narrowed his eyes, and a dangerous light flashed in his pupils.

“What? Are you blocking me to fight me one-on-one?”

Qin Yu sneered and said. Now, he could defeat him just by relying on his physical strength.

“Don’t think that just because you defeated Situ Haoyue, you’re great again,” Xing Mou said coldly.

Although he was not a match for Qin Yu now, his current teammates were all cultivators who had survived in purgatory for many years.

Even Chang Ye would not easily provoke both of them.

“That’s right. You’re blocking us. Are you trying to fight us?”

As soon as he finished speaking, a punch had directly blasted toward Qin Yu.

As the fist’s howling passed, Qin Yu could only feel a surge of beast-like brute force, like a mountain crashing toward him.

Qin Yu also punched out. Under half of his strength, they actually fought to a draw.

“Holy body?”

He could sense the terrifying strength of his body. It seemed to be a kind of giant holy body.

This kind of physique had boundless energy in its body. Its body could absorb tremendous nature’s spiritual energy even without cultivating it.

“You can actually withstand my attack. Again.”

Wu Shan revealed an interested expression.

Qin Yu frowned, and his body flashed and left.

Although he was not afraid of this kind of holy body, his physical body was exceedingly strong. It would take some effort to kill him.

He had more important things to do now.

Suddenly, a dagger appeared from the mist and pressed against Qin Yu’s neck.

“Did I let you go?”

Xing Mou revealed a strange smile.

“No one can escape my fist,” Wu Shan grinned ferociously and said.

“You guys don’t know what’s good for you.”

Qin Yu was furious. He propped up his cosmic form, and his massive neck directly pushed Ying Zi’s dagger away.

“Forget it. I’ll spare your life.”

Ying Zi retracted his dagger. In an instant, his body strangely disappeared into the darkness and reappeared beside Wu Shan.

“Why didn’t you kill him?”

Xing Mou was a little unhappy. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“It will take some effort to kill him. We have more important things to do.”

Ying Zi said indifferently.

“Did you have any objections to my decision?”

“No… No, I don’t.”

Ying Zi suddenly stared at Xing Mou, and his body instantly emitted a thin aura.

“D*mn it! You’re lucky that I spared your life.”

Xing Mou shouted at Qin Yu. He was indeed a little disappointed that Ying Zi decided not to make a move.

“Don’t worry. He’s just a piece of trash with good luck. It’s just that he still has the charm to help him. It’ll be somewhat troublesome if a real fight breaks out. We’ll look for him after we kill Xi Menn.”

Ying Zi stared at Qin Yu, sneered, and said.

“Why are we going to that mountain peak? The Path of Heaven in this galaxy is so weak that it seems we can’t comprehend the Path of Heaven anymore.”

Xing Mou asked.

“Wu Shan’s body will reach Great Success after he uses the bone cultivation water to refine it. At that time, no one will be able to stop him. Moreover, the amount of spiritual energy on the peak is extremely high, so I can use this opportunity to adjust my condition to the best.”

Ying Zi sneered and said.

“Why go through so much trouble? My iron fist can directly smash him into a meat pie,” Wu Shan said in a muffled voice.
