Chapter 1712: Li Cheng’s Choice Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Li Cheng’s words made Sima Bei burst into laughter.

He somewhat said with ridicule, “Do you know that from the moment you stepped into North Plain, your strength has been suppressed?”

“Yes, I know,” Li Cheng said calmly.

Sima Bei continued, “Do you think you can defeat both of us in this kind of environment? Do you think you are Xiao Hai?”

Li Cheng did not say anything and remained silent.

Sima Bei narrowed his eyes and said, “Do you know that you will not be able to go back today?”

“There’s no need to talk nonsense with him.”

At this moment, Yong Ji’s voice came from the darkness.

Following that, they saw Yong Ji walking over.

Seeing that Yong Ji dared to show up, Sima Bei showed more ridicule on his face.

“You really show up,” Sima Bei said.

These words were said to both Li Cheng and also Yong Ji.

However, Yong Ji did not seem to understand what Sima Bei meant. He looked coldly at Li Cheng and said, “How dare you come to North Plain alone!”

Li Cheng’s slightly closed eyes finally opened slowly.

He looked at Yong Ji in front of him and said indifferently, “I’ve been waiting for you.”

“You’ve been waiting for me? Why? Do you want me to kill you personally? Hahaha!” Yong Ji laughed loudly!

However, Li Cheng did not seem to care. He smiled and said, “Today, I die in North Plain. You will never have the chance to prove that you are stronger than me.”

Yong Ji was stunned before he said angrily, “I am stronger than you. I do not need to prove myself!”

Li Cheng said coldly, “You are just deceiving yourself.”

“Nonsense!” Yong Ji was furious and a strong killing intent burst out from his body!

The quarrel between the two also attracted Qin Yu, who was hiding in the dark.

He slightly opened his eyes and activated his desolate divine eyes, looking in the direction of the snowy mountain. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

When he saw the scene at the foot of the snowy mountain, his expression instantly turned ugly.

“Li Cheng…” Qin Yu muttered.

He really showed up!

When he first saw him at the northern border, Qin Yu had already guessed his intentions.

But now, when he saw him standing at the foot of the Snow Mountain, he was still extremely shocked!

This was a path of no return. As long as he came, he would definitely die!

“Li Cheng, why must you do this…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth, feeling extremely uncomfortable.

At the foot of the snowy mountain, Yong Ji’s body was emitting an extremely cold chill.

Li Cheng was much calmer. He just looked at the two of them quietly, without a trace of fear on his face.

“Yong Ji, I’ll leave him to you.” Sima Bei’s tone carried a hint of mockery.

However, Yong Ji ignored him and strode toward Li Cheng. He sneered and said, “You should feel honored to die in my hands.”

As he spoke, the internal qi on his body rapidly increased, and his palms emitted an extremely dazzling radiance!

Li Cheng looked into the distance. It was as if he was recalling something, but at the same time bidding goodbye.

“My life has not been in vain,” Li Cheng muttered.

After saying this, the internal qi on his body started to become a little strange!

All the internal qi was rapidly gathering, and his entire body seemed to be about to explode!

Seeing this scene, Sima Bei seemed to have realized something!

His expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly said, “D*mn! This b*stard is planning to self-destruct!”

Hearing this, a hint of panic flashed across Yong Ji’s face.

“You… You lunatic!” Yong Ji couldn’t help but roar!

“Before I came over, I had never thought of going back,” Li Cheng said coldly.

His target wasn’t Yong Ji, but this snowy mountain!

The power of self-destruction of a cultivator at the Reversion Void Stage was unimaginable!

“D*mn! He wants to destroy the snowy mountain!” Sima Bei was instantly in a panic, but he didn’t know how to stop Li Cheng’s madness!

In the dark, when Qin Yu saw this scene, his expression became extremely ugly.

His body was slightly trembling. When he saw these people who would rather sacrifice themselves for Nanzhou, Qin Yu was feeling extremely unpleasant.

Qin Yu clenched his fists, feeling his eyes somewhat wet.

“Senior Li Cheng…” Qin Yu muttered and closed his eyes slightly as if he was sending Li Cheng off.

At that moment, Li Cheng’s body had undergone a drastic change.

“Goodbye.” Li Cheng’s voice echoed between heaven and earth. The next second, an explosion resounded through heaven and earth!

“Boom!”

The entire earth trembled. That area turned into a vast expanse of whiteness. Even the desolate divine eye could not see clearly.

Qin Yu closed his eyes as his heart trembled.

Li Cheng’s self-destruction meant that his physical body and divine sense would disappear from this world. There would be no chance of survival.

This was a fearless spirit. While people admired it, they would feel more pain.

A terrifying sound surrounded the place and did not dissipate for a long time.

Everyone was struck by this terrifying impact. Countless people died tragically in this explosion.

No one knew how long it had taken for heaven and earth to finally regained their calmness.

Everything was silent, making people feel a little fearful.

Qin Yu looked at the foot of the snowy mountain and saw Yong Ji’s and Sima Bei’s bodies which had been pierced through by the explosion. Their bodies were covered in blood as they lay on the ground, with pieces of flesh scattered beside them.

Their internal qi was extremely weak as if they were going to die at any moment.

“I… You…” Sima Bei opened his mouth with great difficulty. The pain caused his face to distort.

Yong Ji was in an even worse state. He was already injured, and now that he had suffered a self-destruction of this scale, he lay on the ground motionlessly. It was unknown whether he was dead or alive.

But unfortunately, the snowy mountain was not destroyed by self-destruction.

Although it was badly impacted, Yuan Xiu, who was sleeping in the depths of the snowy mountain did not die from the self-destruction.

Qin Yu’s heart was filled with pain and suffering. He squatted on the ground and fell into silence for a moment. He could not calm down his emotions for a long time.

After a while, the North Plain cultivators brought Sima Bei and Yong Ji away from the place. At the same time, they deployed a large number of people to guard the snowy mountain.

Li Cheng knew that he was definitely not a match for these two when he came to North Plain. Therefore, he chose to self-destruct to destroy the snowy mountain.

However, he underestimated Yuan Xiu. Even self-destruction at the Reversion Void Stage failed to impact Yuan Xiu in the depths of the snowy mountain.

Qin Yu sat down cross-legged. He took a deep breath and stopped thinking about it.

The only thing he could do now was to carry on the wishes of these ancestors, work hard to survive, and complete what they failed to accomplish.

Wisps of dark energy flowed into his body. At this moment, Qin Yu’s mood was extremely calm.

The next day, the news quickly spread out, and it instantly caused an uproar among the cultivators at the northern border.
