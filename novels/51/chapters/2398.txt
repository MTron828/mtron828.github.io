2399 Immortal Emperor’s Corpse

In the distance, a crisp sound of sword chant broke through the air.

“Sir, QinYu has killed Jiang Tian! The 20 or so people who were with him are all dead.”

Jiang Qingfeng’s expression changed drastically.

“What?”

The expression of the Holy Lord of the Jiang family changed drastically. They had verified that Qin Yu was seriously injured and unable to recover so soon.

Moreover, the three family heads also brought their Saint Weapons with them. It was sufficient to guarantee nothing would go wrong.

“Is Jiang Wushuang around?”

Jiang Qingfeng asked with a trembling voice.

Jiang Tian was the most talented elder of their family. He could enter the Tribulation Transcending Stage in times to come if he did not die. He was now afraid that the Holy Son might also be killed, which could jeopardize their family’s future.

“Holy Son Jiang is not around.”

The cultivator replied with a trembling voice. He had just seen Qin Yu kill dozens of cultivators of the Jiang family in an instant. He was scared out of his wits and had yet to recover from the shock.

“Great! Great! Qin Yu, you’re so great!”

Jiang Qingfeng roared, gritting his teeth.

“Qin Yu has killed Holy Son Yao Xi!”

Another person rushed out of Thunder Courtyard. His face was ashen as he said to the Yao family’s Holy Lord, Yao Shan.

“Boom!”

A figure appeared next to Lei Xin and Flower Granny.

A violent thunderous and electric arc sound burst behind him. The speed of that sound could not even catch up to Qin Yu’s figure.

“Qin Yu, you’ll surely die today. No matter what, I’ll make you die in endless pain. Today. Even Thunder Courtyard can’t protect you.”

Yao Shan roared furiously.

They were fighting with the three family heads holding celestial artifacts in their hands just now and thus could not afford to get distracted to check the situation inside.

“So what if we kill? You should think of the consequences of protecting this beast. If you still protect him today, I think there’s no need for your Thunderous Courtyard to exist.”

Yao Shan roared furiously several times. His mouth let out roars that sounded unlike humans.

Yao Xi was not only the Holy Son but also his nephew.

Now that Yao Xi was killed, it deeply offended him.

“Roar!”

The ring on Yao Shan’s hand shone with a blazing light. A person suddenly appeared in the air.

That person sat on the dragon’s corpse, and a destructive and baleful aura enveloped everyone.

The moment the figure appeared, the ferocious aura had already pressured almost everyone present to the point that they could not stand.

“The corpse of an Immortal Emperor?”

Qin Yu asked with a frown. He could vaguely sense something familiar.

It was like facing the will of Immortal Emperor Lei in the immortal grave.

“The corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor. Before he died, he sealed all his will in the corpse. The Yao family’s immortal scripture can communicate with this corpse. It’s also Yau Shan’s biggest barrier.”

Lei Xin said with a solemn expression.

With the arrival of the golden age, he was unsure what kind of terrifying power this corpse could unleash.

“Clap!”

Yao Shan clapped his hands, and his consciousness immediately connected with the corpse.

Instantly, the Immortal Emperor’s corpse stood up, his indifferent and emotionless gaze directly sweeping toward Qin Yu.

“Dean Lei, Flower Granny, let me make the move. You two keep an eye on the other two. Attack when an opportunity arises.”

Slightly bending its legs, the corpse suddenly arrived before Qin Yu.

The speed was like instantaneous movement, relying completely on the terrifying explosive power of the physical body, and no one could dodge it.

After that, he slapped his palm directly toward Qin Yu’s head. Qin Yu raised both his hands.

“Boom!”

With a loud sound, Qin Yu’s entire body was slammed into the ground tens of thousands of feet underneath the ground.

Lightning arcs sounded on his body that turned into a thunder dragon and suddenly pierced through the ground, rushing toward Yao Shan.

“Bang!”

The Immortal Emperor’s corpse blocked the punch with irresistible force.

“My Yao family’s Celestial Saint’s corpse can be activated with a thought. Are you trying to be faster than Immortal Emperor?”

Yao Shan revealed a mocking expression.

He suddenly posed a strange posture, and Lei Xin’s expression changed drastically.

He moved his Thunder Staff, and a massive force of thunder crashed down.

However, it was blocked by the Holy Lord of the Yun family, Yun Sen, activating

the Heaven-sealing Orb.

“Don’t be anxious, Dean Lei. Since the two are fighting, let’s not interfere.”

Yun Sen said with a faint smile.

The corpse of the Celestial Saint and Yao Shan made that move at the same time. Two surges of internal qi spread out from the corpse of the Celestial Saint.

A serene, bright, and joyful internal qi of god, and a destructive, restless, and ferocious demonic internal qi. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Two completely different internal qi suddenly rolled together and gathered in the sky.

“Divine and Demonic Dance!”

A punch was thrown out. The fist seemed to carry the scene of an ancient battle. Countless sounds of frenzy fighting entered Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“Retreat!”

In an instant, other than Qin Yu and Yao Shan, everyone else retreated abruptly.

An extreme sense of danger gushed into Qin Yu’s heart. The power of the Immortal Emperor’s corpse, coupled with the activation of the technique, the internal qi soared to the extreme. This internal qi made him feel an extreme sense of danger.

“Chaos, Annihilation of All Things!”

In Qin Yu’s dantian, a drop of Chaotic Demon Water exploded again.

A violent internal qi instantly exploded on his body, almost visible to the naked eye.

In Qin Yu’s emerald green body, a burst of energy exploded from his dantian and flowed into his heart.

“Boom!”

A muffled explosion sounded, the heart forcefully pushing this violent power throughout the body.

“Bang!”

The two fists clashed fiercely, and as they clashed, the entire space ignited with intense destructive flames.

The space exploded, and the entire Thunder Courtyard shook crazily.

Everyone was dumbfounded. Even the two family heads, Jiang Tian and Yun Sen, revealed expressions of disbelief.

Qin Yu was sent flying backward and smashed into an enormous mountain peak.

In an instant, the mountain peak was directly shaken into countless pieces by this terrifying power, and dust covered the entire sky.

A maniacal laughter echoed from the bottom of the peak, and countless lightning bolts struck down.

Qin Yu was covered in blood as he stepped on the lightning floating up.

“Just this? It was a pity that this Imperial Immortal’s corpse could only display such a little power.”

Qin Yu’s killing intent rose to the extreme. He secretly transmitted a message to Lei Xin.

After that, in mid-air, the last drop of Chaotic Demon Water in his body suddenly exploded.

The comprehension of the Way of Lightning had strengthened his Glazed Holy Body.

Even if he detonated the Chaotic Demon Water now, his body could slightly withstand this violent power. Previously, his body was directly injured by the violent power.

His hair instantly flew up backward. With the help of this violent power, he stomped his feet.

He was the first to attack, within the power that could destroy the world.

A dazzling spatial light appeared at the tip of Qin Yu’s fist.
