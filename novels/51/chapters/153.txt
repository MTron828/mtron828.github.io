Chapter 154: Face the Battle! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Before the fist arrived, he already felt the wind generated from the punch!

This terrifying Inner Strength was like a mountain that could topple the seas as it rushed towards Qin Yu!

A serious expression flashed across Qin Yu’s face. Strictly speaking, Qin Yu was only an Inner Strength Master Hands, and there was a huge difference between him and a Inner Strength Past Master.

Therefore, one could imagine the pressure when an Inner Strength Master Hands was against an experienced Inner Strength Past Master!

Qin Yu clenched his fist and charged forward.

The terrifying collision shook the surrounding dust into the air!

The peddlers, afraid that they would be caught in the crossfire, hurriedly retreated into the distance!

As the dust fell, Qin Yu’s fist was wrapped in a light blue light.

Under the darkness, this light looked somewhat demonic.

“Oh really?” Hong Wu raised his eyebrows.

“A mere Inner Strength Master Hands can withstand my punch?” Hong Wu was shocked. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qin Yu became more and more heavy-hearted. If this punch wasn’t wrapped by spiritual power, his bones would have been shattered!

“You’re a genius to be able to fight with me despite such a big gap,” Hong Wu said with a nonchalant smile.

“In that case, I have to kill you. Otherwise, how could you let me go after you’ve advanced?” A fierce look flashed across Hong Wu’s expression.

Qin Yu looked at Hong Wu coldly and said, “I’m afraid you don’t have the ability to kill me!”

“How arrogant! I can kill you with just a raise of my hand!” Hong Wu roared and swung his fist again!

The strength of this punch increased by several degreess. Qin Yu’s expression changed. He wanted to dodge, but there was nowhere to hide because Hong Wu was too fast!

Boom!

With this punch, the spiritual power wrapped in Qin Yu’s hand was shattered!

“How powerful.” Qin Yu frowned, and he was even more shocked.

Such a big commotion instantly attracted countless gazes.

“There are people fighting over there. Should we call the police?”

“Yeah right. They’re obviously filming a movie. Can’t you see the light on their bodies?”

“That’s true, but why can’t I see the cameras?”

“The cameras are all invisible these days. That’s why they’re so realistic.”

The group of people discussed animatedly, but some of them recognized Hong Wu.

“That guy is Hong Wu? The old Inner Strength Past Master who’s been famous for many years?”

“He hasn’t fought for many years. Why would he fight in public today?”

“Who is that young man? How could he withstand two punches from Hong Wu?”

These people took out their cell phones, as if they didn’t want to miss this scene.

Qin Yu panted and looked at Hong Wu vigilantly.

“You can withstand two punches from me, but what about the third punch?” Hong Wu asked with a flippant tone.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Hong Wu, if you turn around and leave now, I’ll owe you a favor.”

Hong Wu laughed and said, “Do I need a favor from you?”

“Are you really not leaving?” Qin Yu frowned and seemed to be in a dilemma.

Hong Wu sneered and said, “What do you think? You must die here today.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu’s expression gradually turned cold.

“Then there’s nothing I can do.” Qin Yu took a deep breath. His body suddenly shook, and his internal qi was raised to the maximum.

Hong Wu said nonchalantly, “If you know what’s good for you, you can come with me now. Maybe you’ll suffer less.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Now that things have come to this, I can only try my best to kill you.”

“Kill me? Hahaha, you’re dreaming!” Hong Wu shouted angrily.

“You’re just a child who is too big for your btirches. Today, I’ll let you know what a Inner Strength Past Master is all about!”

With that, Hong Wu clenched his fist again and charged towards Qin Yu!

This time, Qin Yu didn’t wait. A gust of wind appeared under his feet, and he retreated swiftly.

“You want to run?” Hong Wu narrowed his eyes and immediately chased after Qin Yu!

Qin Yu knew that he couldn’t escape like this, so he condensed the spiritual essence in his body into his fist and seized the opportunity to charge towards Hong Wu!

Hong Wu snorted and said, “You actually dare to attack me? You’re courting death!”

After saying that, Hong Wu casually raised his palm and met him face-on.

In his eyes, Qin Yu was only an Inner Strength Master Hands. An attack of this level couldn’t even break through his defense.

However, when Qin Yu’s fist approached, Hong Wu’s expression suddenly changed!

This terrifying momentum made him feel danger!

He even wondered if this was really an attack from an Inner Strength Master Hands?

“How is this possible?!” Hong Wu had no other choice but to brace himself and face the attack.

Boom

Under this punch, Hong Wu’s expression changed drastically!

He felt as if his fist had been hit by a train. Then, the bones in his hand bent backward with a crisp crack!

“Ah!”

He felt excruciating pain!

This was Hong Wu’s first feeling!

He took a few steps back, and his right fist revealed a ghastly white bone. It was extremely horrifying!

The onlookers in the distance were even more dumbfounded.

Hong Wu’s wrist was broken? How could this be?

“Who is that young man? How could he manage to hurt Hong Wu?”

“I remember now. He is the famous Qin Yu!”

Not far away, Qin Yu panted, and a drop of sweat dripped down his forehead.

“I only broke his wrist with my full strength.” Qin Yu’s expression became more and more serious.

Hong Wu, who wasn’t far away, was even more furious!

He held his wrist and roared, “You broke my wrist? I’m going to cut you into a thousand pieces!”

Looking at the furious Hong Wu, the onlookers stepped back again!

“Hong Wu is going crazy. I’m afraid this kid is doomed,” someone whispered.

At this moment, Hong Wu’s right hand had been broken. He could only clench his left fist and pour all of his Inner Strength into his left fist.

“I’m going to kill you!” Hong Wu shouted and punched towards Qin Yu with all his might!

A long stream of Inner Strength condensed in his fist. With a buzzing sound, the Inner Strength was like a long dragon!

This punch was so powerful that even Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

However, Qin Yu had no other choice but to face it with all his strength.

“Ah!!” Qin Yu raised his head and roared. Then, he raised both of his fists to face the punch.

The moment they collided, sand and stones flew into the air! Countless pieces of dust were stirred up and blocked everyone’s sight!

This was Hong Wu’s trump card, so he was very confident.

Even though he only used his left hand, which reduced his power greatly, it was easy for him to deal with an Inner Strength Master Hands.

“As expected, geniuses always die young.”

“What a pity.”

The people around shook their heads and prepared to leave.

However, at this moment, a person suddenly emerged from the dust!

This person was none other than Qin Yu!

His internal qi seemed to have increased again, and his entire body was enveloped by a faint golden hue. At a glance, he looked golden in color!

“How is this possible?!” Hong Wu’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly crossed his arms in front of him to defend himself!

“Dang! Dang! Dang!” Qin Yu punched Hong Wu repeatedly. Hong Wu felt his arms go numb, and his body kept retreating!
