Chapter 318: Meeting with Yan Ruoxue Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Okay, thank you,” Qin Yu said politely.

The bodyguard didn’t say anything else. One of them turned around and walked into the Yan family’s manor.

Inside the manor, Yan Ruoxue was sitting in front of the window while flipping through a document in her hand.

Yan Ruoxue had always been very concerned about the operations of the company, and Old Mister Yan was interested in preparing her.

Just then, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in.” Yan Ruoxue didn’t even raise her head.

The door slowly opened, and then she saw the butler of the Yan family standing outside the door.

“Miss, there’s a person outside called Qin Yu looking for you.” The butler bowed and said.

Hearing this name, Yan Ruoxue was obviously a little stunned.

She hurriedly looked at the butler and said, “What’s his name?”

“Qin Yu,” the butler continued.

Yan Ruoxue hurriedly threw down the document in her hand, turned her head, and ran downstairs.

She never thought that Qin Yu would come to Jingdu to look for her!

She also never thought that Qin Yu would have the courage to pay her a visit!

The Yan family’s manor was extremely large, and it required a car to drive from the villa to the entrance.

A red sports car sped through the manor.

Not long after, the sound of the car braking suddenly entered Qin Yu’s ears.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked closely in the direction of the entrance.

He was extremely excited, and his heart almost jumped out of his chest.

The door slowly opened, and then he saw a beautiful young girl appear at the entrance.

Her long black hair draped over her shoulders, while her rosy heart-shaped face and her graceful figure made Qin Yu’s heart flutter.

She looked left and right and soon discovered Qin Yu’s figure.

Yan Ruoxue instantly smiled. She walked to Qin Yu quickly, and she could barely believe that everything before her eyes was real.

“You came so quickly?” Yan Ruoxue tiptoed and patted Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu calmed down and suppressed his excitement. He smiled and said, “I can’t wait any longer.”

Yan Ruoxue smiled gently and said, “I’ve heard of your deeds. The King of Chuzhou? Very impressive.”

Qin Yu suddenly had mixed feelings. He did not expect that Yan Ruoxue had been paying attention to his every move.

“Ruoxue, I miss you so much.” Qin Yu couldn’t hide his excitement. In broad daylight, he plucked up the courage to pull Yan Ruoxue into his arms.

This was the main gate of the Yan family’s manor. His every move was monitored by the Yan family.

And it was under such circumstances that Qin Yu pulled Yan Ruoxue into his embrace.

Yan Ruoxue was a little stunned, but she soon smiled and placed her arm on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

The bodyguards of the manor couldn’t help but feel dumbstruck.

There was even someone who said angrily, “This rascal actually dared to lay his hands on Miss Yan. What a b*stard.”

Qin Yu buried his face in Yan Ruoxue’s long black hair.

Breathing in the fragrance from Yan Ruoxue’s body, Qin Yu felt mesmerized.

After hugging for a long time, Qin Yu finally let go of Yan Ruoxue reluctantly.

“I really want to hold you like this forever,” Qin Yu said with affection.

Yan Ruoxue’s face flushed and she pouted. “Be serious!”

Speaking up to this point, Yan Ruoxue suddenly said, “You didn’t come this time... just to see me, right?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I followed the Chuzhou region’s military team here to participate in the competition.”

“Participate in the competition? The annual Military District Competition?” Yan Ruoxue said with some surprise.

Qin Yu nodded vigorously and said, “I’ve always wanted to come to Jingdu to see you, but... I was afraid of bringing trouble to you.”

“Silly, you should be worried about yourself,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “As long as I can be with you, I’m not afraid of anything.”

“Ahem, that... If there’s nothing for me to do, then I’ll take my leave first,” Yao Qing muttered.

Unfortunately, the two of them were immersed in their own world, and no one paid any attention to Yao Qing.

Yao Qing felt dejected and simply turned around to leave.

“Do you want to go inside the Yan family’s home to take a look?” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue suddenly asked.

Qin Yu was stunned and quickly asked, “Can I. . . ?”

“Sure, as long as you aren’t afraid,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Of course I’m not afraid. That day will come sooner or later.”

Qin Yu also had some understanding of the Yan family’s situation.

The entire family seemed to be indestructible, but in fact, it was divided. It was just that Old Mister Yan was forcefully holding it together.

Ever since he heard the news, Qin Yu had been extremely curious about the Yan family.

It was because he was worried about Yan Ruoxue’s safety.

“Then come with me,” Yan Ruoxue said as she held Qin Yu’s hand.

“Okay!” Qin Yu nodded. He composed himself and followed Yan Ruoxue to the Yan family’s manor.

The two bodyguards looked a little awkward and gazed at Qin Yu with hostility.

To them, Yan Ruoxue was a lofty existence.

But now, there was an unfamiliar foolish-looking man holding Yan Ruoxue’s hand openly. How could they accept it?

“Get in the car.” Yan Ruoxue walked to the front of the car and said.

Qin Yu opened the car door and got in.

The car slowly drove toward the Yan family’s villa.

“You seem to have progressed a lot.” Yan Ruoxue glanced at Qin Yu and smiled.

Qin Yu said seriously, “If I don’t progress, how can you marry me?”

This sentence made Yan Ruoxue blush a little.

“Actually...” Yan Ruoxue opened her mouth, as if she wanted to say something.

But in the end, she shook her head and smiled. “It’s nothing.”

The two of them drove to the huge manor.

At this moment, on the top floor of the villa, an old man was leaning on a walking stick while silently watching everything.

This old man was none other than the head of the Yan family, Yan Yunheng.

“Master, this person is Qin Yu,” the head butler bowed and said.

“Yes,” Yan Yunheng only responded calmly.

The head butler asked tentatively, “Should we let him leave?”

Yan Yunheng shook his head and said, “There’s no need.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The head butler was silent for a moment and said, “Master, you said that Qin Yu might be your last trump card. Isn’t it inappropriate to expose him to public eye now...”

Yan Yunheng stroked his beard and sighed. “Yes, but not everything can be under your control. Sometimes, you should just let nature take its course.”

The conversation between the two seemed to be a little mysterious.

As the person in charge of the Yan family, Yan Yunheng naturally had an extremely shrewd mind and a foresight that was beyond ordinary people’s.

He had predicted the scenario of the Yan family falling apart in the future, and even predicted the situation of Yan Ruoxue’s family after his death.

Therefore, Yan Yunheng regarded Qin Yu as his last guarantee.

It was not because of anything but the fact that Qin Yu was that man’s son. This alone made it worth Old Mister Yan taking a gamble.
