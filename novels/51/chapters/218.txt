Chapter 219: The Thick-skinned Qin Yu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s spiritual sense was instantly extracted, and then it rushed into the stone statue!

The pain of the spiritual sense being extracted was unimaginable. In almost an instant, Qin Yu fainted.

His vision turned pitch-black. In the darkness, Qin Yu lowered his head to look at his hands, and found that his entire body was shining with golden light.

“This... is my spiritual sense?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter.

At this moment, a ray of light appeared not far away.

The light grew bigger and bigger until it finally transformed into a human figure!

The instant the human figure appeared, his surroundings became bone-piercing cold, and the sky-piercing dark energy immediately forced its way over!

Looking at the tall human figure in front of him, Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

“You... are you my junior? You’re finally here...” Just as Qin Yu was panicking, the human figure spoke.

There was a trace of excitement and sorrow in his voice. His loud voice made Qin Yu’s head buzz.

“I knew my junior would definitely find me!” The human figure continued to say.

Qin Yu didn’t understand the situation for a moment. He sized up the giant in front of him and didn’t dare to say a word.

“Is the Earth Fiend Valley doing well?” The person continued to ask.

When he heard the words ‘Earth Fiend Valley’, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed.

Updates by

He had heard of this sect. It was a notorious sect in the southwest region.

Rumor had it that they lived on dark energy. Countless young girls had been tricked into their cave dwellings and become nourishment.

This kind of sect had harmed countless people. It was truly an evil sect!

“Could it be... that this person is the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor?” Qin Yu suddenly guessed something.

His mind raced, and the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but curl into a cold smile.

“It’s me!” Qin Yu suddenly cried out sorrowfully.

“I’ve finally found you. You have no idea how much effort I’ve put in all these years to find you!” Qin Yu put on his best acting skills and he couldn’t stop crying.

“You have done well.” The old ancestor said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s heart was immediately filled with joy.

He had guessed it right!

“It wasn’t arduous. As long as I can find you, everything will be worth it!” Qin Yu pretended to wipe away his tears as he said with a slightly sorrowful tone.

The old ancestor nodded slightly and he turned to look at Qin Yu while saying, “Have you found a way to lift the seal?”

Lift the seal?

So this old man had been sealed!

Qin Yu’s eyes darted around as he sighed. “Not yet. I have traveled all over Pyro over the past few years but haven’t found a way to remove the seal.”

When he heard those words, the old ancestor’s expression immediately changed.

A terrifying internal qi immediately pressed down upon Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

Faced with such a powerful internal qi, Qin Yu didn’t have the slightest bit of strength to resist and with a bang, he was pressed to the ground!

In an instant, Qin Yu felt as if his divine sense was about to break!

“What a powerful force!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel shocked inside!

This old man actually attacked his own sect’s people so ruthlessly! As expected of someone from an evil sect!

“Useless trash!” The old ancestor’s voice boomed, causing Qin Yu’s ears to buzz.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inside.

Just a moment ago, he was praising him for doing a good job. Now, in the blink of an eye, he had turned against him. What an old b*stard!

“It’s not my fault. I have already thought of many ways,” Qin Yu said hurriedly.

The old man said coldly, “I don’t want to know the process. I only want the result! Since you can’t find a way to break the seal, then you can stay here and accompany me!”

When he heard this, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned pale!

This old b*stard was really ruthless! He turned hostile faster than flipping through a book!

“I have worked hard for all these years without any merit. On account of the many years of hard searching, let me go...” Qin Yu braced himself and said.

But the elder ancestor sneered. “So many years without any results? That means you’re trash. I think you should stay here.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inside. This old man was really inhumane!

However, Qin Yu didn’t have the slightest ability to resist it.

It was absolutely impossible to forcefully leave!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu’s mind spun quickly.

“Old Ancestor!” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He raised his head to look at the old ancestor of the Earth Fiend Valley and said anxiously, “Actually, if you give me a little more time, I will be able to find a way to break the seal!”

In the face of such a selfish person, it was useless for you to complain about his hard efforts. Only by letting them see hope would he be able to protect himself!

“Do you think I am stupid?” However, the old ancestor sneered again and again.

“You want to make up a lie to let me let you out? I think you’re too big for your britches!”

After an angry roar, the old ancestor’s big hand slapped down again!

This time, Qin Yu suddenly felt as if his head was about to explode!

His spiritual sense was injured, and the pain was far beyond his imagination

Qin Yu grimaced in pain!

“Old b*stard, I’ll kill you sooner or later...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and cursed secretly.

Although that was the case, he still had to think of a way to get out as soon as possible.

“Elder ancestor!” At this time, Qin Yu shouted again.

He looked at the old ancestor with grief and indignation and said in feigned anguish, “I’m telling the truth! If you give me a little more time, I’ll definitely find a way to break the seal, but...”

“But what?!” The old ancestor asked coldly.

Qin Yu sighed and murmured in a low voice, “I don’t dare to say it. I’m afraid you’ll blame me...”

“Say it quickly!” The old ancestor shouted angrily.

Qin Yu pretended to be in distress and said, “I’ve found a way, but I need some time. But now... the Earth Fiend Valley is facing the disaster of extermination and is on the verge of collapse. I. . . I really can’t think of a way...”

After hearing these words, the old ancestor was indeed filled with grief and indignation!

He said angrily, “Who is it? Who dared to harm the Earth Fiend Valley?! Unforgivable, unforgivable!”

Qin Yu had an idea as he hurriedly said, “It’s... it’s someone called Qin Yu! He said that the people of the Earth Fiend Valley are all a bunch of jerks! He wants to uproot the entire Earth Fiend Valley!”

“Ah! ! !” This old ancestor was extremely furious as he roared repeatedly! Qin Yu’s eardrums were about to burst!

“How dare he slander the Earth Fiend Valley in such a manner? I won’t let him off easily, I won’t let him off easily!” The old ancestor roared furiously.

Qin Yu struck while the iron was hot and continued, “Qin Yu is a great hero. He is too powerful. He has already reached the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm at such a young age. He is destroying the Earth Fiend Valley!”

When he said this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but blush.

D*mn, the feeling of boasting was really a little awkward. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“A mere Inner Strength Grandmaster dares to oppress the Earth Fiend Valley?!” The old ancestor looked at Qin Yu coldly.

“I’ll let you out now. Go and find a way to break the seal. I want to tear Qin Yu into pieces!” The old ancestor said coldly.

Qin Yu hurriedly shook his head and said, “It’s too late. By the time I find a way to break the seal, the Earth Fiend Valley will have been wiped out long ago!”

“Why don’t you pass on your strength to me? I’ll kill Qin Yu for you...” Qin Yu said shamelessly.
