Chapter 511: Dragon Veins! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Yuqi was ready to make a move!

Xia Hang stood in front of him and said in a deep voice, “Although Qin Yu isn’t very likable, I have to admit that he is also a genius of the younger generation. He can’t be treated like an ordinary half-step Martial Marquis.”

“Geniuses are meant to be trampled on!” Yan Yuqi shouted.

“If he, Qin Yu, can do it, so can I, Yan Yuqi!”

“Well said!” Qin Yu took a step forward, and his internal qi suddenly erupted.

He looked at Yan Yuqi coldly and said, “If you want to attack, just do it.”

“I’m not afraid of you!” Yan Yuqi shouted angrily. He was about to attack, but Xia Hang hurriedly stood in front of him and used his physical strength to forcefully block the attack.

Yan Yuqi frowned and said, “President Xia, what do you mean by this?”

Xia Hang said coldly, “Since the Martial Arts Association handed you over to me, then you have to listen to me!”

“I’m ordering you now, don’t make a move against anyone!”

A trace of unwillingness flashed across Yan Yuqi’s face.

He glanced at Qin Yu and snorted. “Consider yourself lucky!”

Qin Yu, on the other hand, found it rather interesting.

Yan Yuqi was obviously well-protected and hadn’t experienced the harshness of society.

He had a certain level of talent and was born in a noble family, so he naturally had a proud personality.

Unfortunately, he had no combat experience, so how could he be a match for Qin Yu?

Of course, this was only a small interlude and Qin Yu didn’t take it to heart at all.

He glanced at the mountain range and said in a deep voice, “It’s time to enter the Dragon Vein to take a look.”

After a long period of observation, no one noticed anything unusual.

After that, Qin Yu took the lead to walk towards this mountain range.

Xia Hang looked at Qin Yu’s back coldly and sneered. “Since you don’t know your place, then I’ll kill you today!”

After saying that, he waved his hand and said, “Let’s go.”

Everyone walked into the mountain range in a mighty manner.

This mountain range was vast, and one couldn’t see the end of it at a glance.

After stepping into the mountain range, Qin Yu still couldn’t feel any spiritual energy.

“It’s just like what I thought.” The man with the mustache kept nagging.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What exactly did you find?”

The man with the mustache hurriedly waved his hand and said, “Nothing. I was just talking nonsense.”

After saying this, the man with the mustache ran away in a flash.

Qin Yu continued to move forward.

There were rustling trees on the mountain, but the conditions of their growth weren’t very good. This was completely different from the records of the Dragon Vein.

Looking at the surrounding environment, Qin Yu even suspected that he had been deceived.

Not far away, Xia Hang and the others had the same confusion.

In the surroundings, where was there any treasure to speak of?

“Could it be that the information this time is wrong?” Xia Hang, seemingly at a loss for a moment, frowned tightly.

He took out a map in his hand.

The location marked on the map was precisely here.

Apart from this, this map also recorded relevant information.

“President Xia, if it really is the Dragon Vein, the surrounding environment wouldn’t be like this,” Yan Yuqi said in a deep voice.

Xia Hang nodded and said, “But this information was passed down from the top, so there can’t be any mistakes.”

“Let’s continue to search,” Xia Hang said.

Thus, everyone continued to move forward.

They and Qin Yu were walking on the same path.

The two sides weren’t far apart, but neither of them had alarmed the other.

This mountain range was extremely long. After moving forward for several miles, they still couldn’t see the edge.

Not only that, but Qin Yu couldn’t even feel a trace of spiritual energy.

“Huh? What is this?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly saw a monument erected in front of him.

There were lines of words written on the monument. The words weren’t big, but they could be seen clearly.

Even after experiencing the sandstorm, this tablet was still very intact.

Qin Yu bent down and prepared to read the words on this tablet carefully. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, Xia Hang and the others quickly rushed over!

“It’s here, just like what was recorded.” Xia Hang was excited.

“President Xia, what do you mean?” Yan Yuqi and the others quickly asked.

Xia Hang sneered. “The message above indicates that the treasure is hidden under a stone tablet. As long as you open this stone tablet, you will see the treasure.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

This meant that the 5,000-year-old herbs might be hidden under this stone tablet?

There were lines of words written on the stone tablet. The general meaning was that it recorded the history of cultivation.

“Golden Core Stage, Nascent Soul Stage, Emergence Stage, Splitting Stage, Merging Stage, Mahayana stage, Tribulation Stage...”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown as he silently recited these levels.

Weren’t these the levels of his cultivation path?

According to legends, cultivators at the Transitional Stage were true itinerant immortals, existences that had transcended the mortal world.

However, in the current society, no one had ever seen a cultivator at the Transitional Stage. All the ones on record were legends.

A Martial Marquis at the Golden Core Stage was already invincible in the world.

As for the peak in the current society, it might be the Nascent Soul Stage, or the Martial Saint in the martial arts world.

“Get out of the way.”

Just as Qin Yu was reading, Yan Yuqi strode forward.

Then, Xia Hang and the others followed closely behind.

Qin Yu glanced at Yan Yuqi and said, “What if I don’t?”

Yan Yuqi shouted, “Then I’ll kill you!”

“Huh?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes.

He slowly stood up and looked at Yan Yuqi coldly.

Just as the swords were about to be drawn, Xia Hang quickly walked over.

“Qin Yu, don’t you want to see what treasures are hidden underneath?” Xia Hang said coldly.

Qin Yu glanced at Xia Hang and snorted. “Fine, then I’ll see what is hidden underneath.”

The main purpose of this trip was to help him officially step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm through the five-thousand-year-old herbs.

Therefore, Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to lower himself to Yan Yuqi’s level.

Xia Hang strode forward. With a flip of his palm, several magic artifacts fell into his hands.

These magic artifacts emitted a majestic aura that made people feel a sense of awe.

“Eight Martial Marquis Weapons?” Seeing the magic artifacts in Xia Hang’s hands, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

As expected of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. They casually brought out eight Martial Marquis Weapons!

Probably only the Jingdu Martial Arts Association could be so extravagant.

Then, Xia Hang angrily urged these eight Martial Marquis weapons to fall toward the stone tablet.

“Rumble!”

The moment they touched, the stone tablet seemed to have gained an extremely powerful force!

In a short moment, the stone tablet began to shatter! A huge deep pit appeared in front of everyone!

Seeing this huge pit, everyone’s eyes instantly lit up!

Qin Yu was excited!
