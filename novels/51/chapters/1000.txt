Chapter 1001: Chapter 1,001, the Heavenly Vanilla 

“Princess?”Qin Yu frowned even more.

What era was this? There was still a princess?

“Who is the princess you speak of?”Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

The middle-aged man walked straight towards Qin Yu, but Qin Yu subconsciously stepped back.

Seeing this, the middle-aged man stopped and shook his head, “It’s Yan Ruoxue.”

“Yan Ruoxue? !”Qin Yu’s pupils dilated!

He rushed to the front of the middle-aged man and grabbed his wrist, saying anxiously, “Where is Yan Ruoxue? Is she okay now? Is she safe now? When can I see her?”

Throwing out a few questions in a row, the middle-aged man didn’t know how to answer.

“Why don’t We Sit Down and talk?”The middle-aged man said.

Qin Yu forced himself to be excited and nodded. “Okay, okay.”

The two of them sat on the house. Qin Yu looked at the middle-aged man eagerly, waiting for his next words.

The middle-aged man said, “The princess is now in the secret realm. She is living very well. You Don’t have to worry.”

“It really is the secret realm of the Yan family!”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He looked at the middle-aged man nervously and said, “Why did you take her away? Also, she doesn’t seem to be related to the people in your secret realm, right?”

“No.”The middle-aged man shook his head.

“The secret realm of the Yan family takes a fancy to the bloodline. The more the bloodline is awakened, the higher the status.”

“Like the princess, who is pure of the bloodline of the Yan family, so she has an extremely high status. She will even become the next master of the Yan family’s secret realm.”

Qin Yu could not help but take a deep breath.

As expected, it was exactly like what tie Dan and the moustache had said!

The Yan family’s Mystic Realm had its eyes on bloodline power!

“In other words, Ruoxue is doing very well now, right?”Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

“Yes.”The middle-aged man nodded.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Then why didn’t she come to see me?”

The middle-aged man spread his hands and said, “The princess has been delayed for too many years. Now that she has returned to the mystic realm, she naturally has to go into seclusion to cultivate.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization!

That’s right, Yan Ruoxue had not been cultivating all this while, so she had indeed been delayed.

“Let me ask, what is Ruoxue’s current realm?”Qin Yu asked tentatively.

The middle-aged man smiled faintly and said, “Middle stage of the nascent soul stage, which is what you call the middle stage of the Martial Saint Stage.”

Qin Yu could not help but gasp!

“This bloodline of the Yan family is indeed worthy of its reputation...”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“Of course,”the middle-aged man said with a smile.

“Of course, the resources in the secret realm of the Yan family are not something you can compare with, so you don’t need to feel too much pressure.”

Even though that was the case, the final result still depended on the cultivation result.

No one would care about the conditions of your resources.

“When can I see her?”Qin Yu asked.

The middle-aged man spread his hands and said, “It’s hard to say, but with your current realm, I’m afraid you can’t.”

“Realm?”Qin Yu frowned.

“Then what realm do I have to reach before I can see her?”

“The Almighty Realm,”the middle-aged man said with a smile.

“When you step into the Almighty Realm, I’m sure the Yan family will invite you.”

Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, “The Almighty realm... is too far away from me.”

“Right now, I’m trapped by the heavenly vanilla. Even a martial saint is unable to step into it, let alone the Almighty Realm...”

The middle-aged man laughed loudly and said, “The reason the princess sent me here is to give you the heavenly vanilla.”

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted again!

He hurriedly looked at the middle-aged man and said, “Ruoxue... asked you to bring me the Heavenly Vanilla?”

“That’s right.”The middle-aged man nodded and said.

With a flick of his palm, a sandalwood box appeared in his hand.

Qin Yu quickly took the box and opened it excitedly.

Inside the box were three colorful medicinal herbs, and an extremely strange fragrance assailed his nostrils!

This medicinal herb was none other than the heavenly vanilla!

Besides the heavenly vanilla, there was also a jade stone and a letter beside it.

The Jade Stone was the one that Qin Yu once gave to Yan Ruoxue.

After it broke, Yan Ruoxue carefully collected the pieces.

Now, she had used special methods to make this jade pendant into a keepsake again.

“The princess warned me not to use this keepsake lightly,”the middle-aged man reminded.

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and said, “I understand. Thank you!”

“You should be thanking the princess, not me,”the middle-aged man said with his hands spread out.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the middle-aged man in front of him.

Perhaps it was because of Yan Ruoxue, the rough man in front of him also looked much more pleasing to the eye.

“I have a question.”At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly said.

“What question?”The middle-aged man asked.

“Is the secret realm of the Yan family strong?”Qin Yu asked.

“Very strong.”

“How Strong?”

“Well... in short, it’s very strong. It’s much stronger than you think.”

“Then... how does it compare to the martial arts association of Jingdu?”Qin Yu asked nervously.

Hearing this, the middle-aged man couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“The Martial Arts Association of Jingdu? They don’t deserve to be compared to the secret realm of the Yan family at all!”The middle-aged man laughed out loud.

“Even their eight leaders are not worth mentioning in front of the Yan family.”

Qin Yu could not help but suck in a cold breath!

Not even those eight high-ranking officials were worth mentioning?

How powerful was this?

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “There’s still one more question. There are still many people from the Yan family in Jingdu. Why Don’t you bring them back to the Yan Family?”

The middle-aged man said in a low voice, “I’ve said it before. The Yan family values bloodlines. Bloodlines represent status.”

“Their bloodlines are negligible. Naturally, we won’t take them away.”

“In other words, even if they are the offspring of the head of the Yan family, if their bloodlines are weak, they will be expelled from the Yan family’s secret realm.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown when he heard this. “So Heartless?”

“In the world of the strong, emotions are not worth mentioning at all.”The middle-aged man shook his head.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of Yan Jinyao.

“Oh right, the Yan family also has a Yan Jinyao. His bloodline seems to have reached 80% . Why didn’t you take him away?”Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

The middle-aged man shook his head and said, “He has acquired bloodline, not innate bloodline. Acquired bloodline is not worth mentioning.”

“OH.”Qin Yu nodded.

Then, Qin Yu continued to ask, “That Jingdu martial arts association made Ruoxue suffer so much. Why didn’t you bring people to directly destroy them?”
