Chapter 522: Didn’t You Guys Force Qin Yu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In the following days, Han Wei made more and more public appearances.

His appearances not only involved martial arts, but also the business world.

In a short time, Han Wei had become a star of the younger generation.

“Mr. Han, your wedding with Miss Yan is coming up, and Qin Yu claims that he will come to stop the wedding. I wonder if you will be worried?” asked the host.

Han Wei, who was wearing a luxurious suit, said with a nonchalant smile, “Of course not. Miss Yan and I are on good terms. No one can ruin our relationship.”

“As the old saying goes, I will personally defeat Qin Yu at the wedding as a gift to my wife.”

Looking at these interview videos, Qin Yu couldn’t contain his anger.

When he kept calling her his wife, it made Qin Yu want to tear his mouth apart!

Not only that, but Han Wei’s actions became more and more high-profile.

He consecutively challenged several veteran half-step Martial Marquises, and he defeated almost all of them by a landslide!

After defeating eight half-step Martial Marquises consecutively, Han Wei turned his gaze towards a Martial Marquis!

This was an old Martial Marquis named Zhang Wuque, who had already reached the age of more than a hundred years old!

It was said that Zhang Wuque had already entered the Martial Marquis realm a few decades ago. After so many years, no one knew what level he was at.

This battle was held in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but it wasn’t publicly announced. All that was known was that Zhang Wuque was carried out on a stretcher in the afternoon, while Han Wei was unharmed!

This news had already spread, and immediately caused countless people to feel shocked!

Han Wei had actually defeated a real Martial Marquis?

Not only that, but from the looks of it, it seemed that he had won quite easily?

Could it be... that Han Wei had also stepped into the realm of Martial Marquis?

“Mr. Qin.” Yao Qing held his phone and ran in front of Qin Yu.

“Han Wei defeated an old Martial Marquis,” Yao Qing said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu glanced at his phone and showed a trace of solemnity on his face.

He was well aware of the gap between a half-step Marquis and a Martial Marquis. Even he had no chance of winning against a Martial Marquis!

“Could it be... that Han Wei has really stepped into the Martial Marquis Realm?” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Although it wasn’t that simple to step into the Martial Marquis Realm from the half-step Martial Marquis Realm, Han Wei had the best resources in the world!

It wasn’t impossible for Han Wei to step into the Martial Marquis Realm in one go!

“Mr. Qin, how about... you don’t go?” Yao Qing said from the side.

“If Han Wei really stepped into the Martial Marquis realm, then... then aren’t you going to die?”

Qin Yu glanced at Yao Qing and said coldly, “Even if it’s a dragon’s den or a tiger’s den, I will go. No one can touch Yan Ruoxue.”

Everything Qin Yu did was for Yan Ruoxue! How could he give up now?!

“Martial Marquis... So what if you’re a Martial Marquis? If you can become a Martial Marquis, I, Qin Yu, also have a chance!” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Although he said this, Qin Yu was somewhat uncertain.

Because there was too little time.

...

In Jingdu, in the Yan family’s manor.

Seeing that time was getting closer and closer, Yan Ruoxue became more and more worried.

During this period of time, she had almost been cut off from all contact, and she knew nothing about the outside world.

She didn’t know how far Qin Yu had advanced, and she also didn’t know what kind of strength Han Wei had now.

“Miss, don’t worry too much.” The nanny next to her sighed slightly.

Yan Ruoxue looked at the nanny next to her and whispered, “Aunt He, have you heard from Qin Yu recently?”

The nanny smiled bitterly and said, “Our phones were also taken away. How could there be any news from Young Master Qin...”

The worry in Yan Ruoxue’s heart deepened.

She knew very clearly what Qin Yu was up against.

At this moment, the door was pushed open.

Then, she saw Yan Yongxiu walk in.

Seeing Yan Yongxiu, Yan Ruoxue hurriedly stood up and said, “Dad!”

Yan Yongxiu’s expression darkened as he walked in front of Yan Ruoxue. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ruoxue, your wedding with Han Wei is in a few days. Are you ready?” Yan Yongxiu asked coldly.

Yan Ruoxue bit her rosy lips with her teeth. She looked up at Yan Yongxiu and said, “I won’t marry Han Wei.”

A trace of anger flashed across Yan Yongxiu’s face!

He berated loudly, “Things have already come to this. Are you still thinking about Qin Yu?!”

“Do you know how much trouble this Qin Yu has caused outside?! What’s there to like about this kind of man?!”

“Caused trouble?” Yan Ruoxue seemed to find it a little strange.

What kind of trouble could Qin Yu cause?

Yan Yongxiu said coldly, “It seems that you don’t know your sweetheart very well.”

“Okay, then I’ll tell you what Qin Yu did outside!”

“He killed dozens of people from the Saint Confucian Sect, forced the Saint Confucian Sect into a pinch, and humiliated the Yan family!”

“Not only that, but even the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association were threatened by him!”

At this point, Yan Yongxiu gritted his teeth and said, “That’s the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! What does he want to do? Is he trying to rebel?”

“Even if Qin Yu enters the Yan family, he will bring disaster to the Yan family!”

A trace of surprise flashed across Yan Ruoxue’s beautiful face.

Qin Yu... actually forced the Saint Confucian school into a pinch?

One had to know that the Saint Confucian Sect had Martial Marquises overseeing it!

In Yan Ruoxue’s impression, Qin Yu was an ordinary person. In this short period of time, even if his progress was rapid, he was at most an Inner Strength Grandmaster, right?

Yan Ruoxue raised her head and looked at Yan Yongxiu. She said deliberately, “Dad, don’t joke around. Qin Yu is only an Inner Strength Grandmaster. How could he threaten the Saint Confucian Sect, and how could he threaten the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

Yan Yongxiu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Ruoxue, are you trying to trick me into revealing more info?”

“Okay, I might as well tell you that Qin Yu does have some talent. He has already stepped into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm.”

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes immediately lit up!

“Dad, do you remember what you said back then? You said that as long as Qin Yu can...”

“Enough!”

Before Yan Ruoxue could finish her words, she was rudely interrupted by Yan Yongxiu.

He snorted coldly and said, “So what if he has talent? He doesn’t have the slightest bit of respect in his heart!”

“If the Yan family accepts him, I’m afraid that we will become enemies with the whole world! So you should give up this idea!”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression immediately turned cold.

She stared at Yan Yongxiu and said, “Didn’t you guys force Qin Yu to do this?”

“Back then, you said that he wasn’t qualified and that he was an ant at the bottom.”

“Now, you say that he is a disaster. If it weren’t for you guys forcing him, would he have become like this?”

“Don’t tell me that you want Qin Yu to face your oppression with a smile. Would you be satisfied with that?”
