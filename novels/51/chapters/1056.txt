Chapter 1057: Chapter 1,057, Yan Jinyao arrived 

The five-petaled lotus emitted an extremely holy light that attracted everyone’s attention.

Everyone looked over and were all shocked!

Qin Yu’s expression was not too good either. He could feel the terrifying internal Qi emitted by the five-petaled Lotus!

Gu Zizhen did not say anything more. He seemed to have made up his mind to keep Qin Yu in the second secret realm!

With a light flick of his finger, a lotus flower floated out of the five-petal lotus and floated towards Qin Yu!

The five-petal lotus emitted a divine light that shot into the sky and approached Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed!

Seeing that the five-petal lotus was getting closer and closer, Qin Yu had no time to dodge.

He roared angrily and raised his fist to meet it!

At the moment of the collision, endless divine power erupted and almost drowned the entire battlefield!

That piece of void seemed to have collapsed, and the second mystic realm became extremely unstable!

The remaining power spread out like water ripples, and all the martial artists that came into contact with it were turned into ashes!

And Qin Yu, who was at the center of this storm, was even more miserable to look at!

Even if he swung his fist to break ten thousand arts, he was still unable to resist this lotus petal!

“Bang Bang Bang!”

The lotus petal seemed to have exploded on Qin Yu’s body, blasting his body into pieces, and densely packed cracks appeared on his bones!

It was as if no one had realized how terrifying the lotus flower was. They turned pale with fright, and no one even dared to go up to a thousand to save him!

Qin Yu’s mouth was bleeding non-stop. His body was shattered, and it was extremely difficult for him to even stand up.

His primordial spirit was a little dim. That destructive power had almost taken his life!

“You’re not dead? Then let’s Do It Again!”Gu Zizhen could not stop laughing coldly.

Seeing that things were not going well, the immortal crane turned into a breeze and arrived in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye. It hugged the injured Qin Yu in its arms.

“Retreat.”

The Immortal Crane quietly spat out a word and then took the lead to run toward the exit.

“Run? The exit has long been sealed by me. How can you escape!”Gu Zizhen shouted loudly.

“Today, I’ll use you to sacrifice the second secret realm!”

After saying this, Gu Zizhen quickly chased after them.

However, when he arrived at the exit of the secret realm, he discovered that the sealed exit had been forcefully broken open!

The exit was still emitting waves of light-colored internal Qi.

Gu Zizhen’s expression couldn’t help but turn somewhat cold.

He held the five-petaled lotus in his hand and coldly said, “We actually let him escape.”

“Master, why don’t we seize the victory and chase after him and kill him!”Xuan Qi ran up and shouted.

Seeing Xuan Qi, Gu Zizhen was so angry that he couldn’t help but burst out.

He said coldly, “You piece of trash. I originally wanted to hand over the military power to you, but in the end, you made the second mystic realm lose face!”

In this battle, Xuan Qi was sent flying by Qin Yu before he could even use a single move.

How could such a battle result convince the masses.

Xuan Qi stood at the side and did not dare to speak. The atmosphere in his heart was also extremely tense.

He did not expect Qin Yu’s strength to be so formidable. The long spear in his hand had actually been broken by him. It was simply unheard of!

Gu Zizhen’s expression was also not very good. Qin Yu’s strength was also stronger than he had imagined.

If it was not for the spiritual artifact gifted by the higher-ups, it was really hard to say who would win today.

At this moment, a pill appeared in Gu Zizhen’s hand.

He played with the pill, and his face became increasingly gloomy.

This pill was the one Qin Yu had asked him to pass to Zhai Xing.

Gu Zizhen, who was already a little suspicious, became even more distrustful of Zhai Xing at this moment.

He took a deep breath and waved his hand. “Guard this place well. If Qin Yu dares to come, tell me immediately!”

“Yes!”Xuan Qi cupped his hands, planning to guard this entrance personally.

At this moment, the Sky Blood Rainbow on the ground raised his head and looked at this scene.

“So Awesome.”The Sky Blood Rainbow sneered continuously.

“When my secret technique is completed, all of you will become a part of me!”

...

Qin Yu was brought back to the Heaven Gate by the Immortal Crane.

His injuries were extremely serious. The power contained in that lotus flower was too terrifying.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it could destroy the world.

“How do you feel?”The crane placed Qin Yu on a chair and asked.

Qin Yu opened his eyes and shook his head. “I can still hold on.”

If he were to transform into someone else, he would probably be blasted into a bloody mist.

“What is the origin of that five-petaled Lotus?”Xu Huaigu asked in a deep voice.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know either, but it should be a magic artifact gifted by a mighty figure.”

“Each petal of the five-petaled lotus contains an energy that can destroy everything.”

Qin Yu even felt the threat of death when the Lotus approached him.

Just the residual power alone had destroyed countless lives.

“Gu Zizhen still has many secret treasures on him. If we can’t find a way to deal with him, we definitely won’t be able to take down the second secret realm,”said Jiang he.

Qin Yu nodded. He panted heavily and said, “Let me go and ask Luo Jingyu.”

Although Luo Jingyu wasn’t very strong, he had a deep understanding of magic artifacts.

At this moment, there was still the fragment of the five-petaled Lotus on Qin Yu’s body. Luo Jingyu might be able to know something.

“You’d better rest well.”The Immortal Crane reached out and held Qin Yu down.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I’m fine. I can rest assured even if I get to the bottom of it earlier.”

“If I tell you to rest, then you should rest.”Immortal Crane was extremely overbearing. With a flick of his finger, a soft light bound Qin Yu on the spot.

Following that, immortal crane said coldly, “Where is the place you said? I’ll go ask for you.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to speak when a strange voice came from outside.

“Attacking the second secret area is truly a great feat. I’m afraid you’re the first person to do this.”

He raised his head and saw a young man dressed like a noble young master appearing at the door.

Although he was trying his best to suppress his internal QI, he could still feel that dense aura.

“Yan Jinyao!”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold when he saw the newcomer! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yan Jinyao said indifferently, “Qin Yu, I’ve heard that you’re the current number one person. Now that I’ve also stepped into the martial saint realm, I really want to compete with you.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to speak when the immortal crane walked towards Yan Jinyao barefooted.

“Qin Yu is injured and needs to rest. You should go.”The immortal crane was extremely tall, one head taller than Yan Jinyao.

Its condescending attitude made Yan Jinyao extremely unhappy.

“What does his injury have to do with me?”Yan Jinyao said indifferently.

“Qin Yu, do you dare to stand up and fight with me?”

The crane narrowed its eyes and said with a somewhat cold tone, “Are you going or not?”

“Are you threatening me? Get lost. You are not qualified. Let Qin Yu Talk to me!”Yan Jinyao said coldly.
