Chapter 2695 - 2695: The Staircase of Chaos

Its body was indescribably large, and it would usually find a space to lie down for thousands of years. When there were millions of people above, it would wake up and swallow them before finding another place to lie down.

Qin Yu did not expect Chaos to form the staircase to heaven in this Saint Kingdom.

The space it was in was its domain.

It was no wonder that he was attacked so terrifyingly when his feet left the ground. This was a taboo of Chaos.

All the living beings in its mouth were its food.

Once someone left its mouth, the more intense it would attack subconsciously.

Moreover, it was rumored that this thing had once swallowed a Saint.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Sir Dagger, this won’t do! If you’re not lying to me, this thing should be the head of the Fierce Beasts!”

Qin Yu knew the nature of this dagger. The holy energy he had absorbed just now was not worth its attention.

Boom!

Before Qin Yu could continue speaking, he suddenly lost control of his body.

The silver holy bone emitted terrifying energy as he bent his knees.

A terrifying silver holy energy exploded under his feet.

His body then shot up into the sky like an arrow leaving the bow. In an instant, the entire space emitted a thunder sound.

Qin Yu only felt a terrifying sense of oppression. The entire sky that his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could see had closed!

Gulp! Gulp! Gulp!

A series of sounds like the explosion of the lightning tribulation came out, followed by a pale energy storm that swept up from Chaos’ belly.

Qin Yu’s face was pale. The surge of power was like a tsunami that came crashing towards him.

Moreover, one could still hear the sound of the sonic boom space shattering wherever the energy passed, even in Chao’s belly.

As the tsunami energy came, Qin Yu closed his eyes tightly.

After an unknown period, the energy finally subsided.

At this moment, the terrifying energy had disappeared, and the scene became calm again.

The stens on the ground were still the same. If he had not reached the ton of the entrance, Qin Yu would have felt like he was dreaming.

“Why is this Chaos using so little energy? If it wasn’t for you being too weak, I would have killed this Chaos and barely filled my stomach.” The dagger’s dissatisfied voice came from his sea of consciousness.

“Sir, don’t be rash. When I become successful in the future, I will give you enough energy!”

Qin Yu’s forehead was covered in sweat. This flight that violated the taboos of Chaos had already made him feel that he would die. He did not expect that this dagger was still not satisfied. Where did this master come from?

“Hmph! This leftover material is for you.”

The dagger shook a few times and spat out a bead.

It was a bead condensed from Ultimate Saint Power. The ultimate holy energy contained in it made Qin Yu feel even more ecstatic.

It could be said that the energy contained in this bead was several times more than the energy of the complete Milky Way Holy Body that he had just cultivated.

This bead would definitely be of great use when he needed a huge amount of Saint Power for his future cultivation.

Qin Yu was a little speechless that the dagger had ridiculed such a top-grade holy energy bead as scrap.

Qin Yu stood up. Then only he noticed the shocked faces of the surrounding crowd.

“If I’m not wrong, did he just fly up? When did the staircase to the heavens allow people to fly?”

At this moment, even Xiao Qing was filled with shock and disbelief.

“Could it be that the Chaos staircase is sleeping? Even Dao Realm level 10 couldn’t fly on it.’

Someone guessed that the dagger had devoured the energy in the instant it exploded.

Such a huge amount of energy disappeared in an instant. Even the powerful Zui Rao felt that it was a coincidence.

No matter how she looked at it, Qin Yu’s power was only at Dao Realm level 4, at most at level 5.

Zui Rao squinted her eyes. There was another possibility.

Perhaps he had some treasures on him that could absorb that terrifying energy.

Thinking of this, she could not help but feel her heart palpitate.

It had to be known that almost all those who could reach this place were outsiders. To be able to break through the barrier of the Saint Kingdom, outsiders who could enter this place either had special innate divine abilities or possessed supreme treasures.

Therefore, this area had long become the territory of many factions.

Some proud geniuses had even just come up before they were imprisoned like slaves and stripped of everything on their bodies.

The better ones would end up as mine slaves, and the worse ones would end up as living beings, suffering all kinds of abuse.

At this moment, Zui Raffs eyes moved. She had an idea.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and followed the map that Ruoyao had given him.

After climbing up the staircase to the heavens, this would be the endless mine area.

Moreover, Ruoyao had told him that this was a path all outsiders had to pass through, so many forces had gathered here.

From what the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could see, many outsiders were here.

These outsiders were like low-level pigs and dogs, wearing collars and mining.

Some of them even had rotten feet and did not even have the strength to repair their bodies. One could imagine how miserable these people were here.

Qin Yu sighed slightly. Countless people risked their lives for the Saint Level.

Perhaps many people did not expect that even if they tried their best to come here, they would only find themselves becoming the lowest slaves, treated as laughable beings.

“Hey, new kid! Do you know the rules here?”

A middle-aged man walked forward with a sinister smile.

He held a huge whip in his hand. The whip made a clear sound as he pulled it with both hands.

“Scram, or die!”

Qin Yu looked indifferently at the man being used as a tool and said rudely. “Hahaha! I, Tie Nan, haven’t met such an arrogant person in a long time.” The middle-aged man laughed loudly and his exaggerated muscles swung.

The whip lashed out in front of Qin Yu like a poisonous snake.

Terrifying power burst out immediately. The holy energy exploded in front of Qin Yu and the huge power hit him directly.

However, Qin Yu didn’t even dodge. This force hit his Milky Way Holy Body, but it was like a tickle. It couldn’t even scratch him.

“Just this?”

Qin Yu pursed his lips.

“What?”

The man was shocked. He would not have been so shocked if Qin Yu had just taken this move.

However, Qin Yu didn’t even dodge. Even Dao Realm experts at one level higher than him wouldn’t dare to do this.

At this moment, his body was covered in cold sweat. However, Zui Rao didn’t give him any instructions, so he didn’t say anything. He could only grit his teeth and continue to attack..
