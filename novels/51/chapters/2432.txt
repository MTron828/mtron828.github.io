“Attack with all your might, and you only have one chance.”

Lei Huan’s expression did not change at all. It was a disgrace to the Lei family for him to make a move.

He truly felt ashamed to fight a True Saint with his strength.

Lei Huan raised his left hand, and the sound of tidal waves crashing appeared around his hand.

The sound was sometimes near as if within arm’s reach, yet in an instant, it was far away as if at the edge of the sky.

An enormous gap suddenly opened up in the sky, and a massive tidal wave surged into Lei Huan’s hand.

A miniature mountain appeared in Lei Huan’s hand, and he casually grabbed it and carried it on his shoulder.

Emerald Sea Tide Peak!

He Teng’s eyes bulged, and his face revealed a crazed look of greed.

“What magical artifact is this?”

Yao Meng could feel the terrifying pressure of the Emerald Sea Tide Peak. Her soul power wanted to get close to the mountain peak, but she felt a strong resistance as if she would be in danger if getting closer.

“This is an ocean close to the sea of the Path of Heaven. It was once forcefully taken by Immortal Emperor Lei and refined into a mountain. This magical artifact was given to Lei Huan by Immortal Emperor Lei. It’s at least a quasi-celestial artifact and might even have surpassed ordinary celestial artifact.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Although He Teng’s eyes were full of greed, he did not have any intention of snatching it.

He was arrogant, not stupid.

“Refining the ocean into a mountain peak?” Yao Meng dared not imagine how heaven-defying this power was.

“In the sea of the Path of Heaven, the most formidable power is not the power of thunder but the power of water. The power of water can be gentle and flexible, and it can also possess immense and powerful strength. This magical artifact is perfectly compatible with the cultivation of Lei Huan.”

Jiang He nodded. The power the Emerald Sea Tide Peak in Lei Huan’s hand could unleash was unimaginable.

Yan Ruoxue stared at Qin Yu. Even though she knew she was no match, she was prepared to attack at any moment.

“Ruoxue, you should just watch with peace of mind. You will suffer the wrath of the heavens if you waste even a single drop of your blood.”

Hua Qianjie revealed a gloomy smile. There was no need to pretend anymore.

With a wave of her hand, a wave of flower energy enveloped Yan Ruoxue, Chang Mang, and Jue Wu. After that, petals fluttered in the sky, instantly pulling them into the domain.

Yan Ruoxue’s power of the Spatial Path of Heaven she had just linked up was cut off forcefully.

Floating in the sky, Qin Yu stared at Lei Huan with a solemn expression.

In the sky above Lei Huan, a phantom of a throne slowly appeared in the sea of stars that filled the sky.

It represented the power of Lei Huan, which was very close to the Tribulation Fourth Level. Coupled with the magical artifact in his hand, Qin Yu dared not imagine the power he could unleash.

“You dare not attack? Let me do it then!”

Lei Huan took down the Emerald Sea Tide Peak, and the mountain peak in his hand smashed down on Qin Yu’s head like a spiked club.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

In the enormous waves, the place where Lei Huan and Qin Yu clashed had already transformed into a world of thunder.

The space instantly turned into a black hole. The endless power of thunder and lightning spread out in all directions, devouring everything.

“Retreat! Retreat quickly!”

The enormous black hole instantly swept some weaker cultivators into it. The expressions of the onlookers instantly changed drastically.

“Qin Yu!”

Yan Ruoxue’s hands were cold, and cold sweat dripped down. She, Jue Wu, and Chang Mang stared fixedly at the figures in the terrifying thunderous lightning, not even daring to breathe.

The power of this attack was too terrifying.

Without hesitation, Qin Yu’s Glazed Holy Body emitted a loud cracking sound.

In the space where the Glazed Holy Body connected, the abundant spiritual energy in the three vast spaces surged like boiling water.

Vitality Gate acupoint exploded!

Yintang acupoint exploded!

Yongquan acupoint exploded!

In an instant, three bright suns seemed to have exploded in Qin Yu’s body. The power of each acupoint was equivalent to the power of dozens of ordinary cultivators in the Tribulation Second Level. After three consecutive acupoints exploded, Qin Yu’s strength rose to the peak of the third level.

A pitch-black and weird sword suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu. Qin Yu grabbed the hilt of the scarecrow.

In an instant, all the power poured into Evil Eye like a waterfall.

The Way of Yin and Yang, slash!

The black and white internal qi pierced through the sea of thunder blasted by the emerald sea waves like a long rainbow and counterattacked against Lei Huan.

In an instant, hell seemed to have descended in Thunder Courtyard. Countless malicious spirits of reincarnation wandered around, and there were even thousands of ghosts at the level of Tribulation shuttling through.

Qin Yu’s eyes suddenly turned pitch-black, and the backlash of Evil Eye slowly spread out in his soul.

In an instant, the Heart of Thunder and Five Great Emperors lit up simultaneously to block this power.

The black tide in Qin Yu’s eyes gradually subsided.

“Come on, Lei Huan. Let me see how extraordinary you are, the second person below Immortal Emperor Lei.”

Qin Yu’s hair suddenly turned snow-white. This time, he forcefully used the most formidable power that Evil Eye could use. As for the backlash, he could no longer be bothered.

The Way of Yin and Yang, and Yin and Yang reversed.

The terrifying power of darkness instantly transformed into the worldly power of the Yang realm. The power of Yin was the power of the ghost realm. It mainly killed the soul and was useless against people at Lei Huan’s level.

The Way of Thunder was the nemesis of dark and evil, so Qin Yu had chosen to directly turn it into the Way of Yang to fight head-on.

The power of Yin and Yang instantly merged into one, and a sword of heaven and earth pierced through like lightning and a fierce tiger.

“Interesting.”

Lei Huan revealed a solemn expression. The Emerald Sea Tide Peak in his hand expanded by dozens of times.

The thunder sea of the Path of Heaven seemed to have sensed something and suddenly surged vigorously.

An enormous lightning pool suddenly appeared above the Emerald Sea Tide

Peak.

Thunder Eight Trigrams!

Amidst the loud explosion, people could not open their eyes due to the terrifying lightning.

Even those thousands of miles away could see the falling of thunder sea that was even more terrifying than the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation.

Nearly half of the mountain peaks in Thunder Courtyard turned into dust by the violent thunder and lightning world.

It was almost the power to destroy the world. He Teng’s face was full of fear. They had just retreated 10,000 meters in an instant, and now there was a bottomless abyss in front of them.

Nearly one-third of the onlookers died from the shockwave.

Those who reacted slightly slower were swept into it. Their souls were immediately crushed by the lightning, having no strength to resist.

This kind of power was another understanding of the Path of Heaven.

Most people at the Tribulation Fourth or Fifth Level would draw the power of heaven and earth into their bodies before activating a technique or launching an attack with their physical strength.

As for Lei Huan, he could directly trigger the true ocean of the sea of the Path of Heaven and smash out directly the power of the Path of Heaven.

Qin Yu’s body was covered in massive wounds. At this moment, he felt a sharp pain all over his body, even when he breathed slightly.

Even if he used all his strength, he could not resist Lei Huan.

“He’s indeed strong. However, I don’t understand why someone with such power would do such a thing..”
