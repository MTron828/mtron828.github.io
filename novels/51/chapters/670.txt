Qin Yu’s imposing manner once made Qu Xie feel waves of fear!

And when the lever was flattened, it made people gasp!

Everyone looked at this scene in a daze and didn’t dare to speak for a moment.

No one could believe that Qin Yu’s punch had actually bent the railing!

“Forget it... forget it.” Qu Xie wiped his cold sweat and waved his hand, indicating that they should stop torturing Yan Ruoxue.

The two people quickly withdrew their spells and the tube attached to Yan Ruoxue’s body began to lose its light.

Qin Yu’s pair of extremely cold eyes stared at Qu Xie.

This gaze was too terrifying! Even Qu Xie couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat!

“No, this child must die as soon as possible!” Qu Xie roared crazily inside!

In that instant, Qu Xie seemed to sense death!

He didn’t say a word and turned around to walk out with his people.

The cold internal qi that lingered around Qin Yu slowly dissipated, but the coldness on his face still made people dare not to say anything. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After an unknown amount of time, someone said, “Your punch... was too terrifying. This is the first time the railing has been bent.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and didn’t say anything.

The anger just now almost made Qin Yu lose control.

And this anger gave him an inexplicable power.

This wasn’t the first time this feeling had appeared.

Back when he was facing Yan Jiang, there had been such an outburst.

“Ruoxue, how are you?” Qin Yu looked in the direction of Yan Ruoxue.

Yan Ruoxue shook her head and tried her best to maintain a smile. “I’m fine...”

These words were like their last words, full of sadness.

The surrounding people were also comforting Qin Yu.

“In the next life, you will still be a good man!” Everyone said.

Qin Yu thanked everyone one by one and then quietly waited for the punishment of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Ten minutes later, Qu Xie walked in with two purple-robbed men.

“Qin Yu, it’s time to say goodbye to this world,” Qu Xie said coldly.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground and looked at Qu Xie coldly. “Qu Xie, let me tell you, if she suffers, I will make you suffer a hundred or a thousand times more.”

Qu Xie wanted to mock him, but for some reason, his words were stuck in his throat.

In the end, Qu Xie just snorted coldly and waved his hand. “Take her away.”

The door of the prison opened. The two purple-robbed men grabbed Qin Yu’s shoulders and turned to walk out of the prison.

Yan Ruoxue watched Qin Yu’s back as he left. Tears kept flowing down her face.

She sobbed softly and bit her red lips, trying not to make a sound.

Just like that, Qin Yu was brought out.

Finally, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t take it anymore and began to cry loudly.

Her mournful cry moved everyone. For a moment, everyone felt a little sad. Some even had tears in their eyes.

In the square behind the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, there was a place for execution.

At this moment, two black-gold robe powerhouses brought Qin Yu to this place.

They used a secret technique to bind Qin Yu. At the same time, two Martial Saint weapons lit up in the surroundings.

These two Martial Saint weapons were aimed at the center of Qin Yu’s brows. Once released, they would directly pierce through Qin Yu’s spiritual sense!

Xia Hang stared at Qin Yu while becoming increasingly anxious.

“What exactly is his plan?!” Xia Hang roared crazily inside!

It was time for the execution, but Qin Yu still didn’t escape!

Was he really going to die here today?!

“Qin Yu, this day next year will be the anniversary of your death,” Qu Xie said coldly.

“Do you have any last words?”

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly and looked like he was going to accept punishment.

“Qu Xie, do you think you can still sleep if I don’t die today?”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly grinned, revealing his white teeth.

Qu Xie’s heart thumped. He snorted coldly and said, “You won’t live past today. Even the king can’t save you!”

Qu Xie felt extremely uneasy. He couldn’t wait for Qin Yu to die.

Thus, Qu Xie waved his hand and said, “Don’t waste time. Do it!”

“Yes.” The two purple-robed men nodded and then began to activate the two Martial Saint weapons!

Internal qi of the Martial Saint weapons flickered with traces of an ancient aura. This aura was approaching the space between Qin Yu’s eyebrows!

The light was as dazzling as the sun, and booming sounds kept coming out.

Qin Yu clenched his teeth and stared at the two Martial Saint weapons.

He was also a little nervous.

“F * ck... he’s gambling with his life!” Xia Hang couldn’t help but roar inside.

At this moment, Xia Hang no longer held any hope.

He closed his eyes slightly and said inside, “Qin Yu, I’ll take it that you did me a favor. See you in the next life.”

“Buzz...”

The Martial Saint weapon started to emit light and headed straight for Qin Yu’s glabella!

“Stop!”

At this critical moment, an extremely domineering voice suddenly came from outside!

They saw a tall and imposing man with an extraordinary aura striding in.

He wore a green military uniform and black boots. His eyes were filled with disdain!

“Ye... Ye Qing?” Qu Xie couldn’t help but frown when he saw who it was.

He walked forward and asked, “Officer Ye, why are you here?”

Ye Qing’s clothes trembled and his coat fell off his shoulders.

The entourage quickly caught the coat.

Ye Qing walked toward Qin Yu and pointed at him. “I want to take this person away.”

Qu Xie narrowed his eyes and asked, “Officer Ye, what do you mean?”

“What? Don’t you understand what I’m saying?” Ye Qing said with a cold expression.

Qu Xie snorted. “Officer Ye, although you have an extraordinary status, you can’t just casually take people away, right?”

“Qin Yu has committed a heinous crime. He must be punished!”

Ye Qing said coldly, “Qin Yu belongs to the military district. Even if you want to punish him, you should hand him over to our military district. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association doesn’t have the right.”

Qu Xie couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that. “Officer Ye, I already guessed that you would say that, but unfortunately, we have already obtained the authorization document.”

Ye Qing glanced at him and said, “What document? Show it to me.”

Qu Xie immediately ordered the people around him to go to the office to get the document.

A few minutes later, a document appeared in Qu Xie’s hand.

He handed the document to Ye Qing and said, “Please have a look, Officer Ye.”

Ye Qing took the document. Without even looking at it, he tore the document into pieces!

“Alright, now, you don’t have the authorization,” Ye Qing said expressionlessly.
