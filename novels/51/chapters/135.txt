Chapter 136: Deciding the Outcome with One Move Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Hahaha, Qin Yu, you really think highly of yourself! Ever since I met Tao Shan, he has never lost!” Liu Yi couldn’t help but burst into laughter!

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else. He took large strides forward. His punches were powerful, and with a bang, he swung them towards Tao Shan!

Tao Shan’s muscles instantly tensed up. His body was like steel, and this punch actually didn’t injure him in the slightest!

“What a tough body!” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

A cross-training Master indeed lived up to his reputation!

Tao Shan’s face was expressionless.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Besides having a tough body, my strength has also increased greatly.”

Qin Yu gave Tao Shan a heartfelt thumbs up. This body of his had indeed exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination.

“Tao Shan! Kill him immediately!” Liu Yi, afraid that something unexpected would happen, was impatient.

Tao Shan nodded. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “It’s my turn.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Tao Shan took the initiative to attack!

He took heavy steps and forcefully rushed towards Qin Yu

His burly figure didn’t affect his speed at all!

A fist the size of a casserole arrived in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye!

“Good timing!” Qin Yu wasn’t afraid at all. Instead, he was filled with a strong desire to fight!

He clenched his fist and met the attack head-on!

There was another collision of two fists!

However, the result this time was very different. Under this punch, Qin Yu’s body was sent flying and he crashed into the wall behind him!

The wall collapsed with a bang, and countless pieces of rubble pressed down on Qin Yu’s body!

Dust flew up, momentarily blocking everyone’s line of sight!

“Good, good! Hahaha!” Liu Yi couldn’t help but shout out in excitement!

“Tao Shan, I really didn’t raise you in vain!”

Tao Shan, his eyes staring straight at the ruins, didn’t make a sound.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a ray of light flashed! All the rubble was sent flying! It shot out in all directions!

Then, Qin Yu stood up from the ruins.

The clothes on his body had been torn, revealing his glistening muscles.

However, Qin Yu’s internal qi didn’t weaken at all. Instead, it became stronger.

“You’re stronger than I thought.” Qin Yu’s expression darkened.

Tao Shan’s talent wasn’t that impressive. Just like Wu Hongchang, he had been stuck at the peak of the Inner Strength Master Hands level for countless years.

The difference was that Wu Hongchang stopped there, while Tao Shan took a different path and developed a strong body!

“He didn’t die!” Liu Yi grimaced in anger.

He ordered Tao Shan anxiously, “Kill him now!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Tao Shan looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Since you know, why don’t you turn around and leave now? Don’t come to the Liu family’s home ever again.”

“Tao Shan, what are you talking about? I want you to kill him!” Not far away, Liu Yi grimaced in anxiety!

Qin Yu’s expression was calm. He looked at Tao Shan and said, “Thank you for your kindness. In order to repay you, I will spare your life.”

Tao Shan frowned slightly. The light on his huge body grew even brighter.

“Qin Yu, since this is the case, don’t blame me for being impolite.” After Tao Shan said this, the muscles on his body bulged, and his blood vessels looked like dragons!

Qin Yu was extremely calm and unfazed.

“Qin Yu, you’re dead meat.” After Tao Shan shouted angrily, the faint light on his body actually condensed on his fist!

In an instant, that huge fist became incomparably resplendent!

“It’s over!” Accompanied by Tao Shan’s loud roar, he thrust his fist forward!

Before the fist arrived, there was a gust of wind from the momentum!

In an instant, things were sent flying in the living room! The tables and chairs were directly shattered!

“How strong!” Liu Shihui, who wasn’t far away, widened his eyes.

If he were to receive this punch, he would definitely be dead!

“Good timing!” Qin Yu didn’t panic. He roared loudly, and a layer of light blue light appeared on his body!

This light seemed to have fused with Qin Yu, and his fist was wrapped in this blue light!

“If you can break it, then I’ll admit defeat!” Qin Yu roared angrily, and for the third time, he faced Tao Shan head-on!

“Boom!”

With this punch, the entire room was instantly struck by the force, and the wall collapsed!

Not far away, the Liu family’s father and son, as well as Sun Fu, were instantly sent flying!

Along with this loud bang, dust covered everyone’s line of sight!

Liu Yi climbed up from the ground, rubbed his eyes, and said anxiously, “How is it? Is Qin Yu dead?”

As soon as he said that, the dust in front of him suddenly stirred!

Then, a figure flew out!

This figure crashed into the wall and was crushed under countless stones!

At such a fast speed, no one could even see who it was!

“Is Qin Yu dead?” Liu Yi asked anxiously.

However, at this moment, a figure crawled out from under the ruins.

Tao Shan’s entire body was covered in wounds, and his face was filled with shock!

“How is this possible... how can your physical body be stronger than mine?!” Tao Shan shouted in shock as his pupils dilated!
