Chapter 891: Chapter 891, the despicable Wan Gu Qiong

Facing the two martial saints, the pavilion master was not too nervous.

With a calm expression, she continued, “I don’t know where Qin Yu is, and you shouldn’t have come to ask me.”

Wan Gu Qiong sneered, “Then do you know where Yan Ruoxue is? As far as I know, she has been with you for a long time, right?”

The pavilion master shook his head and said, “Qin Yu has already taken her away.”

“So, where did they go?”The two martial saints beside Wan Gu Qiong seemed to have lost their confidence.

“I don’t know.”The pavilion master said coldly.

“You’re courting death!”

One of the Martial Saints was instantly enraged! He released the pressure on his body and suddenly stretched out his palm!

The moment he stretched out his palm, the pavilion master’s body immediately flew towards his palm uncontrollably!

“Pa da!”

Only the sound of flesh colliding could be heard as the martial saint’s Skinny Palm grabbed onto the pavilion master’s snow-white neck!

A tremendous force spread out and the pavilion master’s face instantly turned deathly pale!

At the same time, the martial saint’s spiritual sense suddenly burst out and forcefully pressed towards the center of the Pavilion Master’s brows! It seemed like he wanted to forcefully read the pavilion master’s spiritual sense!

Naturally, the pavilion master had also noticed his actions. Thus, the pavilion master’s expression changed. He quickly closed his eyes and tried his best to control his spiritual sense to prevent it from being forcefully read.

The two forces seemed to be fighting against each other.

The pavilion master’s spiritual sense was incredibly strong. Even a martial saint was unable to forcefully break it in a short period of time!

“Damn it!”This martial saint could not help but curse inwardly.

“This woman’s consciousness is too strong. I’m afraid it won’t be easy to forcefully read it.”

Wan Gu Qiong’s eyes narrowed when he heard this.

He looked at the pavilion master coldly and said, “Why are you doing this? As long as you tell me where Qin Yu is, I’ll guarantee your safety.”

The Pavilion Master remained silent. She closed her eyes slightly and completely ignored wan gu Qiong.

Wan Gu Qiong narrowed his eyes and said, “You’re not going to tell me, right? Fine, then I’ll Kill Your Medicine Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion Until You Tell Me!”

Before she finished her words, Wan Gu Qiong waved her hand and directly slapped a medicine master to death!

Seeing this scene, the pavilion master’s heart immediately sank, but her face was still as calm as the clouds and the wind.

“I want to see if you’ll talk or Not!”Wan Gu Qiong said coldly.

The pavilion master closed her eyes, as if she didn’t want to see this cruel scene.

“You still won’t talk, right?”Wan Gu Qiong walked in front of the pavilion master.

He stretched out his hand and slowly caressed the pavilion master’s face, saying with a smile, “If you don’t say it, I will strip you naked and throw you on the bed. At that time... Hehe...”

The Pavilion Master’s expression finally changed.

She opened her eyes and said coldly, “You will pay the price.”

“Price? What price can I pay? hahahaha!”Wan Gu Qiong couldn’t help but laugh arrogantly.

“You don’t think I’m joking, do you? Let me tell you, when we get to the bed, I Promise I’ll make you beg for Death!”

The pavilion master gritted his teeth and didn’t say a word.

Wan Gu Qiong said coldly, “Fine, you forced me to do this!”

After saying that, he reached out his hand and pulled at the pavilion master’s clothes!

“Stop!”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the door.

He turned around and saw two people standing at the door.

These two people were ye Qing and Jiang He.

It was rare to see the two of them working together.

“Ye Qing? Jiang he?”Wan Gu Qiong could not help but sneer when he saw these two people.

Ye Qing pointed at the pavilion master and said, “Put her down.”

Wan Gu Qiong sneered and said, “Are you crazy? You thought it was in the past? Do you think you can defeat a martial saint?”

Ye Qing said coldly, “Of course I’m not a match for a martial saint.”

“Then get lost immediately! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”Wan Gu Qiong shouted fiercely!

At the same time, the two martial saints also turned to look at ye Qing.

Ye Qing took a puff of his cigarette and threw it on the ground to stamp it out. He said coldly, “Do you think this is the era where martial artists have the final say?”

Wan Gu Qiong frowned and said, “What do you mean?”

Ye Qing sneered and said, “If I’m not a match for the martial saint, then what about them?”

Before he finished his words, he saw a row of fully loaded warriors running in from outside!

Not only that, modern weapons were quickly piled up at the entrance! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

These cold weapons were aimed at Wan Gu Qiong and the others, and the atmosphere instantly became tense.

“You’ve forced me into a corner. I Don’t care what secret realm you have. Just destroy it with one shot!”Ye Qing shouted loudly.

Wan Gu Qiong’s expression became somewhat ugly when he saw this scene.

It was not that he was afraid of these weapons in front of him, but he did not want to face the official forces head-on.

“Young Master Wan, forget it.”A martial saint said in a low voice.

“Before we came out, the patriarch said that we should try our best to avoid conflict with the official forces.”

Although Wan Gu Qiong was unwilling, he still took a deep breath and said coldly, “Alright, Ye Qing, I’ll Give You Face!”

After saying that, he gave the master a fierce look and said, “Let me tell you, Yan Ruoxue is very important to us. I Won’t give up just like that!”

After saying that, Wan Gu Qiong turned around and left.

Ye Qing snorted. He walked quickly to the pavilion master and said, “How is it? Are You Okay?”

The pavilion master shook his head, stood up and said, “Thank you for saving me, Officer Ye.”

Ye Qing didn’t say anything, but there was a hint of worry on his face.

“It’s time for the government to create a top-notch expert,”Jiang he said in a low voice.

...

On the other side, Zhai Xing and the others were also looking for Qin Yu.

However, after spending an entire day, they still could not find Qin Yu.

“Lord Zhai Xing, that woman might be lying,”a martial saint said.

“Damn it, if we can’t find Qin Yu, we’ll start with the people around him! As long as he doesn’t appear, we’ll kill him until he appears!”Another martial saint said coldly.

Zhai Xing glanced at them and said expressionlessly, “What does it have to do with them? I don’t want to do such a despicable thing.”

“Yes, you’re noble.”The two martial saints could not help but be sarcastic.

Zhai Xing looked over coldly and said in a cold voice, “Not only will I not do it, I won’t allow you to do it either. I’m in charge now.”

After saying this, Zhai Xing turned around and left.

Although the two martial saints were unwilling, they still followed him.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

The Martial Arts Forum quickly made a statistic: in three days, a total of seven martial saints had appeared in the world, and six of them came from the secret realm!

And these martial saints had appeared because of Yan Ruoxue.

...

At this moment, in the spiritual spring secret realm, Qin Yu was slowly absorbing the ice and snow glazed heart.

His internal Qi was advancing steadily, and Yan Ruoxue was at Qin Yu’s side.

She sometimes meditated, and sometimes stood up to wipe Qin Yu’s sweat.

Perhaps it was because Yan Ruoxue was nearby, but Qin Yu’s cultivation this time was much faster than before.

Whether it was the increase of internal Qi or the speed of absorption, it was far faster than before.
