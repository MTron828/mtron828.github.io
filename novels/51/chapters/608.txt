Chapter 609: The Despicable Jingdu Martial Arts Association Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The figure slowly turned his body.

His eyes were extremely soulful, and the expression on his face was filled with coldness.

His face was chiseled, and his masculine facial features quietly looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu hurriedly got up. He reached out to hug him, but his hands went through.

“Father! Father!” Qin Yu shouted desperately.

“Where are you? Where are you? Why haven’t you come to see me?!” Qin Yu shouted desperately.

But the figure didn’t say anything. He just looked at Qin Yu quietly.

All the grievances in Qin Yu’s heart burst at this moment.

“Why haven’t you ever come to see me? You clearly have omnipotent power, so why did you abandon me?! Do you know how much I’ve suffered all these years?!” Qin Yu roared angrily.

“I’ve been bullied, humiliated, looked down upon, chased out of the house, and...” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even though Qin Yu wanted to have some dignity in front of his father, tears welled up in his eyes.

“I’m no longer the Qin Yu who allows others to bully me.” Qin Yu rubbed his eyes, but in the end, no tears fell.

Their eyes met, and Qin Yu stood up straight.

The shadow seemed to be slowly disappearing.

Qin Yu held back the longing in his heart and clenched his fists tightly.

After experiencing so much, Qin Yu had long understood that complaining wouldn’t solve any problems.

As a man, no matter what, he should be calm.

Just as the shadow was about to disappear, he suddenly raised his big hand, as if he wanted to touch Qin Yu’s head.

However, this shadow passed through Qin Yu’s body in the end and slowly disappeared.

Qin Yu clenched his fists tightly with tears welling up in his eyes once again.

“Dad...” Finally, Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in any longer. With a plop, he knelt on the ground with anguish all over his face.

A sense of fatigue spread from his entire body.

Qin Yu fell to the ground and said in a low voice, “I’m so tired, so tired...”

As he said that, his vision started to darken, and then he fainted.

...

In the outside world, Yan Guiyi had brought everyone back to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Everyone, disband,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

After saying that, Yan Guiyi hurried to Qu Xie’s office.

Qu Xie couldn’t help but frown when he saw Yan Guiyi, who had lost an arm.

“What happened?” Qu Xie asked.

Yan Guiyi gritted his teeth and said, “It was Qin Yu!”

Qu Xie was silent for a moment, then continued to ask, “Where is Qin Yu now?”

“He’s dead,” Yan Guiyi said with a cold smile.

“I locked him up in the Immortal Slaying Sect.”

Then, Yan Guiyi told Qu Xie everything that had happened.

Qu Xie narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu... is finally dead!”

Yan Guiyi said coldly, “If he doesn’t die, my arm would have been broken for nothing!”

Qu Xie didn’t seem to care about Yan Guiyi’s arm at all. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Those people at the bottom... dare to resist?”

“Yes.” A hint of anger flashed across Yan Guiyi’s face when this topic was brought up.

“Don’t worry, I’ll go kill them right away!”

Qu Xie shook his head. “You can’t attack them anymore. It’ll cause dissatisfaction from the higher-ups.”

Yan Guiyi was silent for a moment before saying, “President Qu, don’t worry. I’ve already thought of a countermeasure. Those people... shouldn’t even think about living!”

Qu Xie seemed to be quite assured with Yan Guiyi. He didn’t ask any more questions and continued to instruct, “Right, Qin Yu controls Green Moon Villa, right? Make it disappear.”

Yan Guiyi nodded and said, “Okay, I got it.”

...

Jingdu, on a desolate mountain.

Yan Guiyi, who only had one arm, was standing there, waiting for someone.

“Mr. Yan...”

Soon, a man in a black robe appeared behind Yan Guiyi.

It was none other than He Teng.

Yan Guiyi glanced at He Teng and said coldly, “I want you to kill Chang Mang and the others, leaving no one alive.”

Saying that, Yan Guiyi threw a list to He Teng.

Not only were their names on the list, but their personal details were also included.

He Teng took the list and said sinisterly, “Mr. Yan, what benefits will I get?”

Yan Guiyi said coldly, “I naturally won’t mistreat you. Just go ahead and do it.”

He Teng wasn’t stupid. He knew very well what kind of person Yan Guiyi was.

It was impossible to fool He Teng with empty promises.

Seeing that He Teng didn’t leave, Yan Guiyi said impatiently, “What do you want?”

He Teng glanced at the two black balls in Yan Guiyi’s hands.

“I want the two Black Ball Magic Artifacts,” He Teng said.

Yan Guiyi’s pupils immediately dilated!

He looked at He Teng coldly and said with a hint of warning, “Don’t be too greedy, or you’ll easily get yourself killed!”

He Teng didn’t panic. He said with a nonchalant smile, “Mr. Yan, those people are all top-notch, especially Chang Mang. His strength isn’t inferior to mine...”

“If my operation fails, it will also be a loss for you.”

“Moreover, to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, this black gold stone isn’t considered a rare item, right?”

Yan Guiyi frowned. He snorted coldly and waved his hand, then the two black balls fell into He Teng’s hands.

“Just do it. You can’t leave any evidence behind,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

“Also, don’t let people suspect the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

He Teng licked his lips and said, “Mr. Yan, don’t worry.”

...

Qin Yu was dead!

This news quickly swept through the entire martial arts world!

“Qin Yu... died just like that?”

“It’s said that he died in the Immortal Slaying Sect.”

“Immortal Slaying Sect? Is it the sect from ten thousand years ago?”

“I think there might be an inside story. Maybe Yan Guiyi took revenge. Who doesn’t know that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association sent Yan Guiyi to kill Qin Yu?”

“Qin Yu is really dead? I don’t think it’s possible...”

For a moment, rumors spread. Almost half of the people didn’t believe that Qin Yu was dead.

In the Green Moon Villa, Zhen Yue and the others were extremely schocked.

“Mr. Qin... He can’t have died just like that!”

Taozi and Yao Qing were filled with grief and indignation, but they believed that Qin Yu hadn’t died!

Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, a week had passed.

However, Qin Yu didn’t appear, which made everyone start to believe the fact that Qin Yu had died.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu finally woke up from his coma.

He walked to the front of the door and tried to break it open.

“Boom!”

However, even if Qin Yu used all his strength, he was unable to break open the door.

“What should I do?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.
