1791 The Unbearable Inner Demon

Mr. Jiang was probably extremely powerful, and no one could see through him.

“No wonder Thunder Courtyard is a unique existence in Lizhou,” thought Qin Yu.

If they were to make a move, they would probably be able to suppress the entire Lizhou very quickly.

Qin Yu closed his eyes slightly, waiting for the dao technique to descend.

!!

As this was Qin Yu’s first time attending a dao lecture, he didn’t know what it was like.

Mr. Jiang walked up to the podium, and a book of scriptures suddenly appeared in his hand.

A few large words were written on the book–Thunder Sutra!

In other words, this dao technique was created by the Immortal Emperor!

Such a treasure was a unique existence in the entire Holy Region!

Simply a wisp of the dao technique created by the Immortal Emperor could bring about an effect beyond imagination!

Just as Xiaobai had said, even a stone could cultivate and be enlightened when Immortal Emperor conducted the dao lecture.

Although Mr. Jiang had only used the Immortal Emperor’s scripture, the effect was still beyond imagination.

Everyone was silent. Each of them embraced a heart of pilgrimage.

They held their breath and closed their eyes, waiting for the dao technique to bathe them.

“Buzz!”

Soon, the four large bells in the corner emitted a loud sound.

This voice fused and resonated with the Great Dao, setting up sufficient conditions for the lecture.

After that, Mr. Jiang opened the book of scripture.

In an instant, golden light filled the entire dao lecture hall.

Wisps of light bathed everyone’s bodies. Scriptures were emitted from the book and resounded in everyone’s minds through the golden light.

It was a true dao technique that had merged with the Great Dao of heaven and earth.

Of course, everyone’s level of comprehension was different, thus the effects of the dao technique were also different.

Qin Yu was immersed in the dao technique. Every line of the scriptures made Qin Yu feel the resonance of the Great Dao of heaven and earth.

It was an extremely magical feeling. It was as if he had comprehended the true path of cultivation, and his state of mind had been greatly elevated at this moment.

After going through the dao lecture, Qin Yu realized the key to the dao lecture was to let cultivators resonate with the Great Dao and comprehend the Great Dao from it.

This was the first time Qin Yu had experienced such a magical feeling.

Under the influence of this dao technique, Qin Yu had even forgotten about the haunting inner demon.

The entire lecture didn’t last long. It was only for a short day.

Everyone was listening to the Great Dao and feeling the power that came from heaven and earth.

It was getting dark, and the day passed by quickly.

Mr. Jiang slowly kept away the scriptures, and the chimes of the four bells stopped abruptly.

Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were full of shock.

“Is… is this the cultivation method of the aristocratic families…” Qin Yu was full of emotions.

Compared with his enlightenment, the effect of listening to dao was most probably the right approach that saved effort and led to better results. For a moment, Qin Yu was still immersed in the Great Dao.

Mr. Jiang noticed the shock and yearning in Qin Yu’s eyes. He glanced at Qin Yu as if he was secretly taking note of this person.

Mr. Jiang didn’t stay for long and left after the dao lecture.

The other cultivators had also left the lecture hall, except Qin Yu who was still sitting there mesmerizing.

The lingering sound reverberated.

Although the dao lecture had ended, Qin Yu still seemed deeply immersed in it.

The dao technique was circulating in his mind. Qin Yu was hungry and thirsty, and he wanted to swallow everything.

Jue Wu accompanied him by his side. After a long time, Qin Yu finally came back to his senses.

“Is this the dao of the Immortal Emperor…” Qin Yu murmured.

Just now, Qin Yu seemed to have fallen into the dao technique of the Immortal Emperor.

He tried his best to take a look at the Immortal Emperor’s true appearance, but unfortunately, he failed.

After all, this was Qin Yu’s first time listening to the dao lecture. Thus it was certainly not easy for him to directly uncover the truth.

“Quickly go now. You’ve been here for a long time,” Jue Wu said.

Qin Yu nodded. He slowly stood up and said in a low voice, “I’m starting to look forward to the next dao lecture.”

“Isn’t it only once a month? Let’s wait,” Jue Wu said.

A month was very short. It was nothing to cultivators.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have opened the door of knowledge. His heart was full of anticipation.

After returning to the cave abode, Qin Yu did not say anything. He lay on the ground and began to recall the tao technique.

After a while, Qin Yu slowly fell asleep while reminiscing.

That night, Qin Yu slept very soundly. Even the inner demon did not disturb him.

He woke up the next day.

The feeling of glimpsing the truth yesterday had disappeared.

Qin Yu slightly closed his eyes and tried to find the Immortal Emperor’s dao technique, but unfortunately, he failed.

“It seems I can only sense this dao technique for a day at most,” thought Qin Yu.

If he could learn something from this Immortal Emperor’s dao technique, most likely it could bring about a breakthrough for Qin Yu and greatly shorten his cultivation time!

Even a strand of hair from the Immortal Emperor would have an effect that was beyond imagination, let alone an Immortal Emperor’s dao technique.

In the following few days.

Demon-slaying Peak appeared to be rather peaceful. Cao Huang also did not come to find trouble with them.

He seemed to be frightened off by Jue Wu and didn’t take any action for many days.

Unfortunately, there were no new missions assigned to Demon-slaying Peak. The entire Demon-slaying Peak was in closed-door cultivation in their respective cave abodes.

In Qin Yu’s cave abode, his expression was extremely unsightly.

The inner demon started to act up again. As long as he closed his eyes, he would see the scene of him devouring the primordial spirits.

That sense of satisfaction made Qin Yu yearn for it.

Even though he tried his best to restrain himself, it had become even more intense.

Another few days passed.

This inner demon had made Qin Yu look ferocious.

It was as if thousands of ants crawling on his body, and it was extremely itchy!

“I… I can’t take it anymore…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and rolled on the ground in pain!

He grabbed everything he could around him and smashed them on his head.

“Ah!”

Qin Yu screamed in pain, fell to the ground, and began to convulse.

Jue Wu’s heart ached when she saw this.

She gritted her teeth and said, “Qin Yu, how about… I bring you out, and we kill someone!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“No… I can’t…” Qin Yu gritted his teeth tightly. No matter how unbearable the pain was, he still had his rationality.

After a few days, Qin Yu’s dejected condition had reached its peak.

He lay on the ground, panting heavily, like a dying man.

Jue Wu’s heart ached when she saw this.

She bit her red lips as if she had made a decision.

Then Jue Wu quickly left the cave abode. Before she left, she used a secret technique to seal the cave entrance as she was afraid that others would see Qin Yu’s appearance.

Then it was the following day.

Qin Yu couldn’t hold it in anymore.

His eyes were bloodshot, and his body was covered in bloody scratches. His eyes were like those of a wild beast, extremely terrifying.

“I can’t take it anymore…” Qin Yu was gasping for air, greedily walking out of the cave.
