Chapter 2756 - 2756: Return Failure

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s divine soul was divided into nearly twenty parts. The Primal Chaos Flame had blocked all the divine beasts.

However, the Primal Chaos Flame had also ignited his body, causing him to suffer extremely serious injuries.

This kind of injury was fatal. If he delayed for another one or two seconds, the Primal Chaos Flame would have burned him to ashes.

In an instant, the 20 clones walked into the dream realm in the passageway at the same time.

Qin Yu had no time to check the brightness of the starlight in the dream realm.

He could only take advantage of this moment to forcefully enter the dream.

The remaining divine soul stood alone in the passage. This time, even the clone’s origin had been completely cut off.

In other words, each of his clones only had one-twentieth of his original strength.

After this kind of divine soul entered the dream, he simply could not maintain his original intention.

It was very easy to get lost in the dream and never return to reality.

However, Qin Yu had no other choice at this moment.

He had reached the final distance in the space he was in.

Every meter would give birth to a huge number of divine beasts.

This was an extremely powerful resentment that was enough to kill him completely.

Qin Yu was left in the passageway. His body erupted with an intense dreamy aura in an instant.

A large amount of Night Qi was continuously absorbed from the twenty starlight dreams.

One had to know that just a weak living being’s dream realm could let Qin Yu absorb enough power of the night.

At this moment, he had entered twenty dream realms. There were even powerful living beings among them.

The eruption of the Night Qi enveloped him in Dream Qi.

Qin Yu returned to the primordial forest. At this moment, his eyes were in a daze.

Different illusions flashed in front of his eyes. He could not tell if the scenes he saw were real or fake.

A raging fire that was hundreds of meters high burned on the ground. At this moment, the power of the Primal Chaos Flame was released.

Qin Yu’s body became almost transparent. He walked forward step by step in a daze.

Countless divine beasts pounced at Qin Yu crazily and then were turned into ashes by the flames.

The entire space formed a huge black storm.

Wisps of Night Qi seeped into the Primal Chaos Flame. Its power was released

again.

In the core of the fire, petals slowly fell.

There was a little green flame in the middle, which seemed to be able to cover up the brilliance of all the flames in the sky.

As the fire core appeared, a visible wave of fire erupted.

The entire space was emitting fatal heat. Cracks suddenly spread throughout the space.

A destructive power turned all the mountains and forests into dust.

Even this huge resentment was fatally injured.

The sea of fire emitted by the Primal Chaos Fire completely enveloped the resentment.

Only when the entire space had turned into nothingness did the sea of fire emitted by the Primal Chaos Flame gradually weaken.

A greedy thought lit up in the void. At this moment, the fire core slowly stopped in front of Qin Yu. The surrounding flames fluctuated continuously as if they wanted to devour Qin Yu as well.

All of a sudden, another furious thought erupted from Qin Yu’s body.

Everything turned into an ice world wherever this thought passed.

The Primal Chaos Flame was slowly wrapped around by the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth before it was brought into Qin Yu’s body.

In an instant, Qin Yu returned to the space of resentment again.

“Boss Qin Yu, you escaped from there! You’re still alive after using the Primal Chaos Flame! F*ck, you’re simply awesome!”

Fatty Situ’s eyes were filled with adoration.

However, Situ’s chubby hand could pass through Qin Yu’s body.

Countless chaotic thoughts entered his body, causing his face to instantly turn pale.

“Don’t get close to him. There’s something wrong with his current condition.” A sword light descended, cutting off Fatty Situ’s internal qi from Qin Yu.

Fatty Situ’s Guardian instantly unsheathed his sword.

“What a strange power! Is this the power of the Dao of Dreams? It’s so powerful and profound. I can’t believe it.’

It was rare for Loli Liu Si to be serious.

“Did you guys notice that the power of resentment where he was in just now disappeared? Qin Yu should have completely killed it.”

Cang Yunzi suddenly raised his head and said.

“It should be the power of the Primal Chaos Flame. Once it’s unsealed, the energy will only be retrieved after the user dies or everything is burned to ashes. I didn’t expect the Dream Qi to protect him.”

The person who had just attacked said in a deep voice. He seemed to be the strongest guardian beside Fatty Situ.

“However, the cost seems to be a little too great. His divine soul has been weakened to the extreme. He must have split his soul into dreams to absorb such powerful power of the night. I have some understanding of the Dao of Dreams. Once he enters a dream, he must rely on his powerful will to return. It will be decades of boring cultivation every time he returns. With his split soul, I’m afraid he can’t even distinguish the reality of the dream, let alone return.” Cang Yunzi shook his head.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body suddenly surged with a strong Night Qi. A pair of demonic wings slowly spread out on his back.

There were many strange and sinister illusions within. Even cultivators thousands of meters away were affected by this power.

“Don’t disturb me!”

Luo Yu’s dagger was thrown out and instantly pierced through Qin Yu before returning to his hand.

However, Qin Yu’s body seemed to be transparent. There were no wounds at all.

‘Qin Yu…’

In the space of resentment far away from Qin Yu, Xiao Sheng looked at Qin Yu with a complicated expression.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He had always had complicated feelings for Qin Yu. Qin Yu had always been his big brother’s best friend.

However, he joined the demon race after Xiao Hai died.

The two of them had practically never interacted with each other again. He did not expect they would meet in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom.

“Hmph! His current state is that his divine soul can’t return. It doesn’t mean that any trash can kill him.”

Fatty Situ said with a cold smile. He was very unhappy with Luo Yu’s sudden attack.

Boom!

With Qin Yu’s appearance, all the resentment space stopped fluctuating.

After the vortexes stopped spinning, they looked like hideous human faces.

Every face was lifelike. One could even see the tiny scars on their faces.

As these human faces slowly squirmed, they began to merge.

In an instant, everyone was so nervous that they held their breaths.

“It seems like my guess is right. There’s no way to escape this time. Heavenly Sin is about to enter the third stage.”

Cang Yunzi’s expression was grim.

If the level was the same as before, he would have wanted to gain some benefits from it.

However, Heavenly Sin’s power had descended now. It was difficult for them to

resist at all..
