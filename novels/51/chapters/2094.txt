2095 It’s Immortal Crane!

Qin Yu stood still in a daze, dumbfounded.

This person was none other than Immortal Crane!

Qin Yu had suspected it, but the thought had just flashed through his mind, and he did not think much of it.

He had never expected this person to be Immortal Crane!

As always, Immortal Crane was full of celestial aura, and a dot of light between its brows made him look even more like a fairy.

Looking at Immortal Crane’s figure, Qin Yu was tremendously excited.

He had wanted to greet him but was also a little worried.

Unlike Qin Yu, Immortal Crane had offended each and every nine great aristocratic families! He was their public enemy!

If Qin Yu were to acknowledge him, the aristocratic families would surely jointly take action to suppress them! It was not something that Qin Yu could not withstand!

Qin Yu had no choice and could only hold back for the time being.

Everyone’s expression was cold, looking at Immortal Crane’s countenance.

Teng Tian stood with his hands behind his back and said slowly, “You’re truly bold!”

The others at the scene began to discuss animatedly.

“He’s actually that mysterious person of the demon race!”

“He came from the depths of Azure Rock Forest. His strength must be formidable!”

“It’s hard to tell. Although the nine great aristocratic families have always occupied all the resources, they are still humans after all. This mysterious person is a demon race.”

“Different ethnic groups will have different thoughts.”

Qin Yu did not say a word. He was silent and did not know what to do for a moment.

Holy Son Jiang could not help but rub his chin and mutter, “This b*stard, he might attack me one day.”

“With Holy Son Jiang’s strength, you might not be afraid of him,” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

Waving his hand repeatedly, Holy Son Jiang said, “If we were to fight head-on, I might not be his match. However, this fellow’s speed is incredibly terrifying. He can simply drag me to death. It’s best to think of a way to get rid of him quickly.”

Qin Yu’s expression turned even uglier hearing their discussion.

Obviously, the nine great aristocratic families had taken Immortal Crane as a public enemy.

“Brother Qin, what’s the matter with you? Why is your expression so ugly?” At this moment, Saintess Gu noticed Qin Yu’s abnormality.

Qin Yu came back to his senses and said without confidence, “Nothing. I’m just not feeling so well.”

Fortunately, Saintess Gu did not ask much. Everyone focused on Immortal Crane.

“Since you’re here, I presume you’re not just here to give my Teng family a gift,” Teng Tian said.

Immortal Crane looked at Teng Tian, then at the crowd, and said, “Sir Teng, to be honest, I’m not here on my behalf, but Azure Rock Forest, or rather… the demon race.”

What?

The moment he said this, the crowd was in an uproar.

Everyone started discussing animatedly. It was noisy.

“Demon race? He’s the representative of the demon race!”

“How powerful is the demon race in the depths of Azure Rock Forest?”

“If this mysterious person really represents the demon race, our human race will be in trouble.”

“Are we going to have a war between humans and the demon race?”

Holy Son Jiang frowned and asked nervously, “All along, there have been numerous legends about the depths of Azure Rock Forest. Everyone has speculated that some terrifying creatures were living there, but it has never been verified. Now, it’s absolutely confirmed.”

“A creature from the depths of Azure Rock Forest has an unimaginable background. The people of our nine great aristocratic families don’t know much about the depths of Azure Rock Forest. This at least means that the True Saints can’t set foot in that land,” Saintess Gu.

If the Immortal Emperor were still around, he would naturally not be afraid of Azure Rock Forest. After all, to the Immortal Emperor, there was no place in the entire universe that they could not go to.

However, there were too few Immortal Emperors. Even the Tribulation Stage great cultivators were only a handful. Therefore, how would they know so much about Azure Rock Forest?

Qin Yu was silent. He recalled a group of people he had seen in the past.

They also came from the depths of the Azure Rock Forest. They had numerous treasures in their hands and even auctioned them off to rogue cultivators.

Now that he thought about it, that group of people was most likely from the demon race from the depths of Azure Rock Forest.

“What do you mean?” Teng Tian asked.

“So what if you came from the depths of Azure Rock Forest?” Si Qianjing said with a dark face. “What do you want to do on behalf of the depths of Azure Rock Forest? Are you going to start a war with us? Your various actions seem to be starting a war, right?”

“It’s not starting a war. It’s just that from today onward, our demon race will appear. I’ve particularly come to tell you this,” Immortal Crane said.

“Of course, as usual, you’re not allowed to enter the depths of Azure Rock Forest.”

What he said last naturally angered everyone.

“What? You can enter the place where we humans live, but we are not allowed to enter Azure Rock Forest?” Si Qianjing shouted.

At this moment, Si Qianjing was like a human race’s messenger of righteousness, resoundingly and powerfully.

Immortal Crane said quietly, “You can enter if you want to, but you’ll be responsible for your own life and death.”

“That you don’t have to worry.” Teng Tian was also somewhat displeased.

Immortal Crane did not dwell on this and nodded, “Iv delivered my words, and I’ve also delivered the gift. I’m making a move now.”

With that said Immortal Crane turned around and wanted to leave.

“What? Do you come and go as you please?” Si Qianjing roared, and the internal qi on his body soared instantly.

Following that, several True Saints jumped up and blocked Immortal Crane’s way.

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly, and he was somewhat worried.

If many True Saints attacked together, it would probably leave Immortal Crane behind the eight balls.

“Is Sir Teng planning to break your own rules?” Immortal Crane looked at Teng Tian.

Teng Tian remained silent as if not knowing what to do for a moment.

“Let him go.” At this moment, Teng Zixu, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke.

Everyone looked at Teng Zixu in unison, and Si Qianjing’s eyes were full of displeasure.

“Do you know what it means to let him go?” Si Qianjing said coldly.

Teng Zixu said with a faint smile, “My Teng family has always kept our promise. When we said you’re not allowed to fight in the Teng family, you are not allowed to fight. If anyone breaks the rules, don’t blame me for being rude.”

As he spoke, Teng Zixu’s internal qi suddenly changed tremendously as if a king had descended!

The dao technique surrounded his body, and with a wave of his hand, all the magical artifacts in the small world were mobilized!

At this moment, everyone could sense Teng Zixu’s terrifying internal qi!

“Is this Teng Zixu’s strength?” Holy Son Jiang frowned as well. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Si Qianjing and the others were also shocked deep down!

They were also True Saints, but Teng Zixu was not weaker than them at their peak!

Teng Zixu had just stepped into the True Saint cultivation realm. Back then, Si Qianjing and the others had cultivated for a long time before they reached their peak!

“How terrifying…” Countless people were amazed by this and looked at Teng Zixu with fear.
