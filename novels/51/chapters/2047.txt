Chapter 2048: Can’t Miss It

Si Shiyue looked at the Chaos Grave coldly.

“Let’s go. He won’t be out for a while,” Si Liuhe said.

Si Shiyue looked at Ji Liuhe and said, “Master, I don’t want him to die.”

“Hmm?” Si Liuhe was a little surprised.

Si Shiyue clenched his fists and said, “I must kill him personally on the day of the Path of Heaven!”

Si Liuhe understood what Si Shiyue meant. He reached out, placing his hand on Si Shiyue’s forehead, and said, “I know what you mean. I can spare his life, but I’m afraid he won’t live for long.

“You must know it’s not just our Si family who wants him to die. Moreover, the elder of the Si Family has indeed died at his hands. If the Si family doesn’t do anything about it, won’t we be laughed at by all the people?”

Hearing this, Si Shiyue slowly loosened his fists.

“You don’t have to treat him as an imaginary enemy. Qin Yu is not worth mentioning and being compared with you,” Si Liuhe said.

“I understand now, Master.” Si Shiyue bowed slightly.

In the following few days, the man with the mustache was busy with the formation while Qin Yu and Xiao Hai sat cross-legged discussing the dao.

At the same time, news of the Chaos Grave had already spread.

In just a few days, explosive news spread throughout the Holy Region.

Just as the man with the mustache had guessed, this Big Grave was indeed the grave of Wu Ji of the chaotic body!

Wu Ji was too dazzling for Holy Region. Although he had not taken the final step, everyone understood it was due to the Great Dao of heaven and earth, not because he was not talented.

And he relied on his unconventional way of realization to resound throughout the universe!

Integrating nine dao techniques and killing an Imperial Immortal outside the region, such a battle record was unprecedented!

“Wu Ji, that is such a distant existence.”

“Killing an Immortal Emperor at the Tribulation Stage is too terrifying. ”

“Although that Immortal Emperor is a withered Immortal Emperor, such a battle record is still dazzling.”

“If he could take the last step, his achievements would be comparable to the Demon Emperor and Yan Tianming.”

“How do you know Wu Xi is inferior to the two of them? He’s the only one in history who has integrated nine dao techniques, right?”

Although the masked woman had also integrated nine dao techniques, there were not many stories about her in the Holy Region.

Even the nine great aristocratic families were silent about her, and no one knew why.

Perhaps someone had deliberately blocked the news, or the masked woman really did not have much activity in the Holy Region. In short, Wu Ji was more reputable.

The heads of the nine great aristocratic families gathered to discuss the matter.

Wu Ji’s Big Grave was of great importance. It was very likely that experts from the outer region would come to search for treasures. At that time, people probably would come crossing the void.

Therefore, they had to open up the Chaos Grave as soon as possible. As for the corpse, they could not give it to the Si family as it wasn’t an ordinary chaotic body at the Tribulation Stage. It was Wu Ji, the most powerful chaotic body in history!

“I heard Wu Ji had created the Traceless Immortal Scripture that has recorded the integration of nine dao techniques.”

“Sigh! Whoever obtains the Traceless Immortal Scripture will probably become an existence that can rampage in the Holy Region.”

Everyone was attracted by this Big Grave. It was as if nothing else was rare except for the Chaos Grave.

In the Chaos Grave, the man with the mustache set up a formation.

This formation required a large number of materials and tremendously powerful techniques. Even Qin Yu had never seen it before.

Half a month had passed in the blink of an eye, and the formation of the man with the mustache was only in its embryonic form.

During this half a month, numerous people took the risk to enter the Chaos Grave to look for opportunities. However, the outcome was they died without exception.

Even if they came with Saint Weapons, they still died tragically here.

After a few more days, the man with the mustache finally set up the formation.

An array platform was in front of them. It was not big, but it emitted a tremendously mysterious internal qi.

“What is this?” Qin Yu asked doubtfully.

“As long as we have this array platform, we can come and leave the Chaos Grave as and when we like,” the man with the mustache sneered and said.

“It’s so awesome?” Qin Yu exclaimed. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Of course!” the man with the mustache said smugly. “If I didn’t rely on this ability back then, I’m afraid I would have long been slaughtered by the people from those aristocratic families!”

Qin Yu sized up the array platform and said with a frown, “But isn’t the array platform too eye-catching? If someone discovers it, it will probably be destroyed.”

“That’s right. That’s why I have to rely on my sky-concealing formation to hide it,” the man with the mustache said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu could not help but give the man with the mustache a thumbs up.

Although this kid seemed unreliable, he did have some ability.

After setting up everything, Qin Yu, Xiao Hai, and the others quickly left without hesitation.

After a while, the group was teleported to a corner of Divine Fortuity City.

“With my ability, the furthest the formation can send us is here,” the man with the mustache said.

“That’s enough,” Qin Yu nodded slightly and said. “They probably won’t expect us to appear in Divine Fortuity City.”

After that, they concealed their internal qi and found a tavern to sit down for the time being.

All the people in the Holy Region seemed to be discussing the matter of the Chaos Grave.

After Qin Yu and the others sat down, no one paid attention to them. They were all discussing the glorious deeds of Wu Ji in the past.

“By the way, I have a question for you.” At this moment, Qin Yu looked at the man with the mustache.

...

The man with the mustache rolled his eyes and said, “You can ask, but you have to give me some benefits.”

“F*ck you!” Qin Yu rolled his eyes at the man with the mustache and said thoughtfully, “Since you can deduce the heavenly secrets, then you should know how long it will be before the day of the Path of Heaven, right?”

Hearing this, the man with the mustache took a sip of wine and said, “To be honest, I have indeed deduced it.”

Qin Yu instantly asked nervously, “How long will it take?”

“I can’t deduce the exact date, but an estimated period,” the man with the mustache said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu did not dare to say much. He stared straight at the man with the mustache and waited for him to continue.

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu and said, “No more than three years at most.”

Qin Yu gasped and was instantly stressed out!

Three years was indeed too short the time for cultivators!

Comprehending a technique would possibly take three years!

“What about the earliest?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

The man with the mustache stretched out a finger and said, “One year.”

“I understand now.” Qin Yu fell into silence.

He took a deep breath and said slowly, “I have to think of a way to obtain Wu Ji’s hidden treasure. Otherwise… I have no chance of turning the tables.”

“Since you could deduce the time, you should be able to deduce who the Path of Heaven would choose, right?” Xiao Hai suddenly said..
