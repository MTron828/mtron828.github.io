Qin Yu glanced at Li Feng and couldn’t be bothered with him at all.

Li Feng’s expression was a little ugly. He hurriedly walked up to Kong Ping and said, “Director Kong, I’ll kick him out now!”

Kong Ping looked at Li Feng with a dumbfounded expression.

She frowned and said, “Kick him out?”

“Yeah, give me some time. I’ll take care of it,” Li Feng said with an embarrassed smile.

Kong Ping didn’t quite understand the situation. She frowned and said, “Mr. Qin is our boss. Why would you kick him out?”

When he heard this, Li Feng’s expression changed slightly.

He said with an embarrassed smile, “Director Kong, don’t joke around. Isn’t our boss Jiang Gu...”

“That’s right. Mr. Qin is Jiang Gu’s boss. He is our boss too,” Kong Ping said with a frown.

Li Feng’s expression changed!

He suddenly remembered the “King of Chuzhou” who had just risen recently!

Could that person be Qin Yu?

“Did you offend Mr. Qin?” At this moment, Kong Ping suddenly realized something.

“He didn’t offend me. He just told me to get out.” Qin Yu sneered.

Kong Ping’s expression immediately changed. She stood up and berated, “Li Feng! Who gave you the guts to tell the boss to get out?! I’m officially informing you now that you’re fired!”

Li Feng was completely flustered. He looked at Qin Yu, as if he was asking for help, and said, “Qin Yu, I... We’re friends. Have you forgotten that you used my pencil when you were young...”

“Now you know that you guys were friends?” Yao Qing sneered.

“Didn’t a certain someone just say that Mr. Qin isn’t on the same level as you?”

Li Feng was extremely anxious. He grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and begged bitterly, “Qin Yu, I really know that I’m wrong. You... you have to forgive me...”

However, Qin Yu pushed Li Feng’s hand away.

He looked at Li Feng coldly and said, “I don’t care whether you acknowledge me or not, but I don’t like your way of handling things.”

“Do you hear me? Hurry up and get out!” Kong Ping was a smart person. She immediately waved her hand and chased Li Feng out.

Li Feng regretted it. If he had known earlier, he would have established a good relationship with Qin Yu!

With their previous friendship, he might have been promoted!

Unfortunately, it was useless now.

After chasing Li Feng away, Qin Yu looked at Kong Ping.

“Miss Kong, I won’t disturb you for now. I hope you can finish the wall as soon as possible,” said Qin Yu.

Kong Ping quickly nodded and said, “Mr. Qin, don’t worry. I’ll arrange for someone to do it right away!”

Kong Ping had already prepared a place for Qin Yu to stay.

The surroundings were relatively quiet, and there were many abandoned houses.

After these houses had been renovated, they would be a good choice.

Qin Yu and Yao Qing temporarily stayed in this house.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He quickly took out the herbs he had prepared and prepared to refine a pill for Wei Ming.

...

At a training ground in South City, a muscular man who was like an iron tower was training with all his might.

His training method was extremely rigorous, and the muscles on his body were ridiculously big.

The most shocking thing was that his body seemed to be wrapped by a faint light.

This person was no other than Tao Shan.

Ever since he was defeated by Qin Yu, he had been training like crazy.

Not only did he successfully step into the Inner Strength Past Master realm, but his Cross-training level had also improved greatly.

In the dark, a figure was staring at Tao Shan.

“This is a precious physical body...” Greed flashed in the figure’s eyes!

“If I get this body, with my realm, no one in Chuzhou can do anything to me!”

In the next second, the figure rushed toward Tao Shan with a whoosh!

He turned into a black mist and stuck to Tao Shan’s body!

“Ah!!”

Painful wails came out from Tao Shan’s mouth!

In less than half a minute, Tao Shan fell to the ground with a bang.

A few seconds later, Tao Shan, who had fallen, stood up again.

But this time, his expression became a little sinister, and the smile on the corner of his mouth was extremely eerie.

This person was none other than the southwest Magus who had possessed Qiu Feng back in the provincial capital!

This Magus was called Hui Ming, and he was once an important figure in the southwest!

Unfortunately, his physical body was later destroyed, which was why he fell into such a situation!

Ever since Qiu Feng was defeated by Qin Yu, he had escaped to South City!

And now, he had possessed Tao Shan’s body!

“With this body, I will definitely be able to snatch back the stone statue!” Viciousness flashed in his eyes! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Tao Shan, how was your training today?”

At this moment, a young man walked over from not far away.

Hui Ming glanced at this young man and muttered in a low voice, “Peak Inner Strength Master Hands? Although a mosquito is small, it’s still meat...”

After saying that, Hui Ming raised his hand and slapped his head!

“Ah...” the young man immediately let out a painful wail.

In less than a minute, his inner strength was completely absorbed.

His body withered.

After Hui Ming absorbed this inner strength, rays of light began to stick to his body.

His body instantly became tougher!

“How comfortable. How comfortable...” Hui Ming licked his lips in satisfaction.

He looked at this body with satisfaction and couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

For Magi, their weakest point was their body.

Tao Shan just happened to make up for his weakness!

“Qin Yu, I will return the humiliation I suffered from you last time!” Hui Ming said sinisterly.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu had already finished refining the pill.

He put the pill into a box and put it aside.

“I’ll find a time to send it to Wei Ming,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After refining the pill, Qin Yu took out the stone statue.

The stone statue had an extremely dense dark energy. Even Qin Yu could feel the bone-piercing coldness.

This stone statue was definitely more mysterious than he had imagined!

“Since I can’t find any herbs, I might as well rely on the dark energy on the stone statue to cultivate for now,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He placed his hand on the stone statue, and the dark energy on the stone statue instantly surged towards Qin Yu like a spring!

“Such strong dark energy!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes!

He had absorbed it for more than an hour, but the dark energy on the stone statue still didn’t diminish at all!

“How much... how much dark energy is there in this stone statue?” Qin Yu was ecstatic!

If that was the case, wouldn’t he be able to absorb dark energy without limit to increase his strength?

“That’s great.” Qin Yu’s face was full of excitement!

This stone statue was indeed not some common object! No wonder Hui Ming had risked his life to get it!

Just as Qin Yu was excited, a strange light suddenly burst out from the stone statue.

The moment this light appeared, the golden light in Qin Yu’s mind began to surge.

“Huh? What’s going on?” Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He felt that the divine sense of power in his mind was about to be absorbed by the stone statue!

Qin Yu hurriedly wanted to move his hand away, but he realized that his palm seemed to be sucked by the stone statue!
