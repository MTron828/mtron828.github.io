Chapter 1725: Do You Think There’s No One in Nanzhou? Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Fresh blood flowed down his body. Even though Yuan Xiu looked furious, his internal qi was not as strong as before.

“Oh no, Yuan Xiu is still alive.”

“No matter what, Xiao Sheng is also alive. This is good news.”

“That may be the case, but don’t forget that Yuan Xiu is in a much better state than Xiao Sheng,”

Just as they had said, Xiao Sheng’s condition wasn’t very good. Although he was still standing there, his internal qi was slowly dissipating.

!!

If this continued, he would definitely lose.

Xiao Sheng silently chanted a spell technique, and the injuries on his body began to glow with holy light as they slowly healed.

Yuan Xiu, on the other hand, glared at Xiao Sheng. He raised his hands and said coldly, “You’re only at the half-step Reversion Void Stage, but you’re able to severely injure me to this extent. I approve of your ability, Xiao Sheng!”

“I don’t need your approval,” Xiao Sheng said coldly.

“You must still have some trump cards that you haven’t used yet. I believe you won’t dare to face me with just Rashomon.” Yuan Xiu narrowed his eyes.

“You’re right.” Xiao Sheng did not hide anything.

“If I can’t kill you with this technique, then I’ve lost this battle,” Xiao Sheng said with a sigh.

Yuan Xiu raised his head and laughed. “Xiao Sheng, do you think I’ll give you that chance?

“To tell you the truth, I know you’re strong, but your strength is beyond my imagination. I originally thought that with my cultivation realm, I could easily kill you, but even so, I didn’t underestimate you. Every technique I used was sharp and fierce!

“However, you’ve managed to survive time and time again. This has truly made me feel shocked and afraid. Therefore, I’m going to kill you today no matter what to prevent you from reaching the Reversion Void Stage.”

Hearing this, everyone’s expression changed drastically.

They thought, “What did Yuan Xiu mean by this? Was he going to get rid of Xiao Sheng without caring about his reputation?”

“Sima Bei, Yong Ji, let’s attack together and kill him!” Yuan Xiu roared.

Sima Bei and Yong Ji immediately stepped forward and stood beside Yuan Xiu.

“Despicable!”

For a moment, everyone was furious.

Yuan Xiu’s cultivation realm was already above Xiao Sheng’s, and now it was three against one.

“Yuan Xiu is so shameless!”

“He’s Lord of North Plain. It’s one thing that he didn’t dare to wait for Xiao Sheng to reach the Reversion Void Stage, but now he’s even thinking of fighting three against one!”

“This is too disgusting. How can such a person be an overlord?”

Yuan Xiu sneered when he heard the discussions around him.

“History is written by the victors. Survival is the most important thing,” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

Xiao Sheng, who was already on the verge of collapse, was now facing three Reversion Void Stage mighty figures. The situation was extremely disadvantageous for him.

Xiao Sheng’s expression turned cold. He looked at Yuan Xiu in front of him and said, “Yuan Xiu, it seems like I’ve overestimated you.”

“Hahaha!” Yuan Xiu burst into laughter.

“Xiao Sheng, I’ve lived thousands of years and witnessed countless geniuses. Do you know what I’ve been relying on to survive?”

“Shameless!” The people around them immediately started cursing.

However, they were too weak and couldn’t help at all.

Yuan Xiu, Yong Ji, and Sima Bei were all staring coldly at Xiao Sheng in front of them.

Yong Ji and Sima Bei felt a little excited.

Xiao Sheng had always been an insurmountable mountain in their hearts. Now that they were able to kill him personally, how could they not be excited?

“I didn’t think that I would have such a day!” Sima Bei said coldly as he looked at Xiao Sheng.

“Xiao Sheng, you wouldn’t be in this situation today if you had reached the Reversion Void Stage. Unfortunately, you were too arrogant!” Yong Ji also shouted.

Xiao Sheng remained silent, only coldly looking at the three in front of him.

“It’s useless even if you regret it now. You will die here today.” Yong Ji revealed a sinister smile.

“No need to talk nonsense. Let’s attack together and kill him,” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

“Alright.”

Sima Bei and Yong Ji stepped forward, their bodies exuding an extremely strong battle intent.

If Xiao Sheng was a tiger, then Sima Bei and Yong Ji were two wolves.

A tiger that had always been on the brink of death would find it difficult to hold off two wolves that were so imposing.

“Xiao Sheng, I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time. I can finally kill you with my own hands!” Yong Ji shouted coldly.

“Come on!”

Accompanied by Sima Bei’s furious roar, the two attacked at the same time, heading straight for Xiao Sheng.

“What? Do you think we don’t have anyone else in Nanzhou?”

At this moment, an explosive shout rang out from afar. A fiery red light appeared before Xiao Sheng.

The light blocked Sima Bei and Yong Ji’s paths, preventing them from getting close to Xiao Sheng.

Then, everyone saw a figure that looked like a fireball in the sky. It suddenly fell to the ground and stood in front of Xiao Sheng.

This person was none other than Wen Wanchong.

Wen Wanchong glared at Yuan Xiu and cursed, “You’re Lord of North Plain? You’re just trash. You can’t beat them, so you f*cking call for help. Bah, you’re really shameless!”

“Wen Wanchong? You meddlesome thing,” Yong Ji said coldly.

Wen Wanchong looked at Yong Ji and sneered. “B*stard, did you forget what I said last time? I’ve said it before. I’m going to kill you b*stard myself!”

Wen Wanchong’s arrival naturally eased the pressure on Xiao Sheng, and for a moment, everyone was a little excited.

Wen Wanchong stared at Xiao Sheng and said, “D*mn it. Although I don’t like you, I hate that b*stard Yong Ji. I’ll help you.”

Xiao Sheng didn’t say anything, his expression still calm.

Yong Ji sneered. “Wen Wanchong, you may have reached the Reversion Void Stage, but so what? You’re not my opponent, and even in the same cultivation realm, you’re still not my opponent.”

“What nonsense! Have I ever fought you? Why are you so confident?” Wen Wanchong cursed.

Sima Bei said indifferently, “There are only two of you but three of us. What do you have to win?”

Wen Wanchong sneered. “There’s only the two of us, but do you think we can’t beat you three b*stards to death?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Wen Wanchong, you’re looking for death!” Yong Ji said furiously.

“Three against two. You will lose without a doubt,” Sima Bei said coldly.

“Who said it’s three against two?”

At this moment, another voice was heard.

They turned around and saw a young man walking over.

This person was none other than Qu Zhu.

Qu Zhu, who had been unwilling to make a move, had finally arrived.

“Qu Zhu? You’re actually here.” Yong Ji’s eyes narrowed, and his expression was extremely cold.

Qu Zhu looked at Yong Ji and said, “Three against three. Do you still think you can win?”

Yong Ji’s mouth moved, and his expression was ugly.
