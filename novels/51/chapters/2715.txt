Yi Yun stared at Qin Yu as though he wanted to pry out some secrets from him.

Apart from his brother’s constant winking at him, he also felt that Qin Yu was very strange. That was why he pin-pointed at him.

He had been paying attention to Qin Yu ever since Xi Ming spoke.

This kid was too calm, so calm that it was a little ridiculous.

An ordinary person would probably have long defended themselves in such a situation. However, Qin Yu seemed to be an outsider. In this situation, one could only say that this person was a fool or he had some trump card on him.

Even if he guessed wrong, he would at most waste a True Spirit Gu.

Although this parasite was precious, the Guardian of Order could still afford it.

Xi Ming’s expression was extremely ugly. He once again turned his body sideways to block Qin Yu.

“Yi Yun, I swore with my dao mind that if Qin Yu had nothing to do with this matter, I would let him leave. Even if you want a test, you can use the Spirit Source Stone. Why must you use the True Spirit Gu?”

His eyes were a little red.

A look of anger flashed across Yi Yun’s face as he gripped the saber on his thigh.

Before he could do anything, a saber energy that contained the power of lightning had already slashed at Xi Ming’s chest.

“Forget it, Ximing. This has nothing to do with you. The development of this matter is no longer something you can decide. You can leave.”

In an instant, Qin Yu used his Tiger Wing to block this terrifying saber light.

The saber energy made a crisp sound when it struck the Tiger Wing. The power of lightning contained in it increased the piercing force of the saber energy by a lot.

The Tiger Wing trembled violently. After a few seconds, the saber energy that contained lightning slowly dissipated.

“What terrifying power!”

Qin Yu’s arm was a little numb. He stared at Yi Han with a solemn expression.

Being able to guard this place, this fellow was not without strength. He combined the saber energy and the power of lightning to unleash even greater power.

This could only be done if one had a deep understanding of the Dao of Saber and the power of lightning. Otherwise, it would be easy for them to backfire on him.

“He actually received Yi Han’s attack with one hand! This kind of strength is different from what we saw! It looks like we’ve got something big!” Lord Tang’s eyes flashed.

He pointed his finger in the air and the place where he pointed emitted a thunderous roar.

A strong force directly rushed over, tearing at the muscles on Qin Yu’s face.

This finger was completely only powered by his physical body, but the might was even greater than Yi Yun’s saber strike.

The power of the finger directly exploded on Qin Yu’s body.

Silver light splashed everywhere, like two pieces of red-hot iron colliding fiercely.

‘What?”

Lord Tang stood up abruptly. He didn’t expect Qin Yu to take the blow with his body.

The surrounding people were deathly silent, especially Wu Hao and the others, whose expressions revealed fear.

One had to know that three of them were genuine Dao Realm level 9 and two were Dao Realm level 8.

However, Qin Yu had taken the blows from the two of them. Moreover, it looked like he did not even use much strength!

“Looks like you’re another genius outsider. You might have become the target of our support in the past, but now you have to accept our True Spirit Gu.” Lord Tang sneered.

Whether it was on the Upper Done, Path of Heaven Academy, or the Guardian of Order, the higher-ups had given the order regarding this matter.

They had to investigate the relevant people at all costs. Therefore, they must capture this genius and accept their interrogation today no matter what.

“That depends on whether you have the ability!”

Qin Yu also had the intention to test his current strength.

A pearl appeared in Qin Yu’s hand and he crushed it.

This was the Saint Power Pearl that Sir Dagger had left for him after absorbing the energy. The Saint Power Pearl contained a vast amount of Saint Power. Its pure power was higher than ordinary Saint Power.

At this moment, the power exploded in Qin Yu’s hand.

The glaring Saint Power was almost impossible to look at but strangely, there was no fluctuation in the energy.

Every cell in Qin Yu’s body had turned into a black hole to absorb the massive amount of Saint Power.

After the Glazed Holy Body advanced to the Milky Way Holy Body, the power that his body could contain was like the ocean.

“What a terrifying body! No wonder he is so arrogant towards us.”

Hong Luan let out a crisp laugh.

“I was just trying to deceive him. It seems that the Nineteenth Prison might really be related to him.”

Yi Yun revealed a smile.

Although Qin Yu was strong, he was only at Dao Realm level 5.

Even if he crossed two levels to battle, could he pose a threat to the three of them?

Yi Yun held a large saber in his hand.

Lightning arcs were faintly emitted from the surroundings as if the lightning in the void was attracted.

“Relax. Let’s test his strength first.”

Lord Tang stopped Yi Yun as he waved his hand. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Immediately, several dozen black-robed figures from the Path of Heaven Academy surrounded Qin Yu, chanting obscure Daoist incantations.

These thirteen people’s syllables were not the same but they could be linked together.

The voice seemed to reverberate in the bottomless valley. Those who heard the bewitching incantation revealed a blank expression at this moment.

“Quickly wake up!”

The surrounding people quickly used their mental strength to wake their companions up.

The people around the thirteen people retreated.

“What a terrifying bewitching curse! Thirteen mouths join hands and launch a terrifying mental attack!”

Wu Qian’s expression was ugly. She would have been hit if Xi Ming, who was beside her, had not woken her up.

“This is most likely the Path of Heaven Academy’s Combined Attack Technique.

There are already very few spells for mental attacks, and Combined Attack Techniques are even rarer. The combined attack of these thirteen Dao Realm level 3 cultivators is enough to render a cultivator in level 7 or 8 unable to resist. Even you were hit just now, let alone Qin Yu in the middle level.” Xi Ming’s expression was also a little complicated.

He wanted to make a move, but just as Qin Yu said, it was no longer something he could interfere with since the situation had developed to this point.

At this moment, an endless swamp suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu.

Countless vines wrapped around him and pulled him into the depths of the swamp.

A faint pressure was tearing at his chest.

Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly turned pitch-black.

After devouring that huge amount of energy, the Night Qi had also recovered a little.

However, Qin Yu immediately withdrew the Night Qi. This power was extremely important to him, so he could not use it easily.

He used the Soul Torment Mind Technique, Zhou Zhuang’s Dream Butterfly, One Thought Reincarnation, and his understanding to create his Dao of Dreams.

Such a divine soul attack was already full of flaws in his eyes at this moment.

A strange smile appeared on Qin Yu’s lips. In the next moment, he was pulled

in by the vine..
