Yan Ruoxue held her phone and stared at the content on the screen.

Seeing Qin Yu being beaten until his mouth was full of blood, Yan Ruoxue felt like her heart was being cut by a knife.

Her face instantly became a little pale.

Even the hand holding the phone trembled slightly.

Yan Sihai was very satisfied with this scene.

He took a puff of his cigar and said indifferently, “Currently, Qin Yu has become a scum of the martial arts world. Everyone wants to kill him.”

“Yan Ruoxue, are you willing to watch him be attacked by a group until he dies?”

Yan Ruoxue suddenly raised her head.

She glared at Yan Sihai.

“What do you want?!” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

Yan Sihai laughed and said, “I don’t want to do anything. I’m just informing you.”

“Currently, Qin Yu is no threat to anyone. He can’t change anything.”

“Yan Ruoxue, just give up on this idea. Hahaha!”

After saying this, Yan Sihai snatched the phone and turned around to leave.

In the huge dining room, only Yan Ruoxue sat there in a daze.

She even began to wonder if her appearance had brought luck or disaster to Qin Yu.

If she hadn’t appeared, would Qin Yu have encountered such a predicament?

...

In Chuzhou, Jiang Gu found Qin Yu’s residence for him.

This place was far from the city and was a villa in the suburbs.

It was surrounded by mountains and water, and behind it was a towering mountain.

To Qin Yu, this was the best place to live.

At this moment, Qin Yu was standing at the foot of this tall mountain.

He placed his hands behind his back and raised his head to look at the towering mountain. His sensitive divine sense covered a radius of ten miles.

Soon, Qin Yu felt traces of internal qi surging over.

They belonged to a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster. His aged internal qi contained extraordinary battle strength.

“Jiang Gu?” Qin Yu raised his brows and quickly guessed the other party’s identity.

As expected, in less than ten minutes, Jiang Gu arrived at the foot of the mountain.

“Mr. Qin.” Jiang Gu bowed to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Why are you here?”

Jiang Gu said, “I know all about what happened.”

“So?” Qin Yu smiled.

Jiang Gu’s expression was ice-cold. His internal qi shook, and his clothes were immediately pulled back, revealing the tough body of the holy body.

“I will accompany you,” Jiang Gu said.

Qin Yu was speechless, and a trace of gratitude flashed in his eyes.

“Thank you,” Qin Yu said with a serious expression.

Jiang Gu waved his hand and said, “We might be able to draw with the three sixth stage Inner Strength Grandmasters.”

Although Jiang Gu was only an Inner Strength Grandmaster of the third stage, he still possessed a holy body.

Therefore, if the two of them worked together, they might really be able to win.

Time passed minute by minute.

At the foot of the mountain, a gentle breeze blew past, and the leaves rustled.

Finally, at noon, Qin Yu felt the internal qi of the three Inner Strength Grandmasters of the sixth stage. The internal qi of the three Inner Strength Grandmasters of the sixth stage was extremely strong.

“They’re here,” Qin Yu said quietly.

Hearing this, Jiang Gu quickly adjusted his internal qi to the maximum.

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Jiang Gu, thank you for your kindness, but you should go and rest.”

Jiang Gu frowned and asked in confusion, “Why?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I can handle it.”

“No,” Jiang Gu said stubbornly.

“If I leave now, I’ll be a coward. How will I face you in the future?”

Qin Yu forced a smile.

“Okay.” Qin Yu didn’t say anything more and just let it be.

The three internal qi got closer and closer to Qin Yu.

“Wow, Mr. Qin is so leisurely and sophisticated.” A sarcastic voice sounded.

The person who spoke was Xiaoru.

Xiaoru held a folding fan in her hand and covered half of her face with it.

“Are the things ready?” The other two didn’t talk nonsense like Xiaoru did.

“Don’t be too arrogant!” Jiang Gu immediately shouted, and his internal qi burst out!

“Old man, do you want to die?” Xiaoru sneered.

“You’re so old, so why don’t you go home?”

Jiang Gu said coldly, “When I, Jiang Gu, became famous, you guys were still nobodies!”

“Jiang Gu? You’re the top dog in Chuzhou?” Xiaoru’s eyes flashed with excitement.

Jiang Gu snorted. “Since you know, then get lost!”

“Hahahaha!” Xiaoru suddenly burst into laughter.

She said slyly, “Times have changed. Do you still think you’re the top dog in Chuzhou? I didn’t expect that the former top dog in Chuzhou and the current top dog in Chuzhou would be trampled under my feet! Hahaha!”

Jiang Gu was furious when he saw Xiaoru’s slyness!

His body shone with golden light as he threw a punch at Xiaoru!

Xiaoru snickered. “A mere third level Inner Strength Grandmaster wants to attack me? How brazen!”

Xiaoru put away her folding fan and her smooth hands went up to meet the punch.

“Clang!”

Under the punch, Xiaoru’s palm split open and blood dripped down!

She took a few steps back to stabilize itself!

“Huh?” Xiaoru’s expression changed slightly.

“You’re just a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster, so how can you have such strength?”

Jiang Gu coldly said, “You’d better go to h*ll and ask!”

After saying that, Jiang Gu stepped forward again!

Xiaoru coldly said, “Do you really think you’re all that impressive?”

She patted the folding fan in her hand, and a sharp force instantly erupted!

The energy was so strong that even Jiang Gu’s expression changed!

At this moment, a figure blocked in front of Jiang Gu.

He looked up and saw Qin Yu looking at Xiaoru coldly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“This has nothing to do with Jiang Gu,” Qin Yu said.

Xiaoru snorted. “You want to act like a hero at this time? Hurry up and hand over the thing!”

“That’s right. Our time is precious, and we don’t want to waste it on you,” the other two also said.

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “Will you let me go if I hand over the Meridian Circulation Technique to you?”

Xiaoru said slyly, “Oh, you’re quite smart! Hahahaha! To tell you the truth, whether you hand it over or not, you will die today!”

“That’s right, how could we let go of such a chance to become famous?” The other two looked at each other and sneered.

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and said, “Do you guys think you can defeat me?”

“Why not?” Xiaoru snorted.

“The current you is just a stray dog. It will be a piece of cake to kill you!” Xiaoru said proudly.

“Since when did a nobody like you get to point fingers at an Elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

At this moment, a domineering and charming voice came from behind.
