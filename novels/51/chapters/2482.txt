2483 The Eight Great Forces

“Is this the cultivation technique passed down by your father? No wonder it’s so exquisite.”

“With his talent, he might have seen through today’s situation. It’s not surprising that he has some backup plans.”

Lei Xin recalled that person’s appearance, and his face revealed a nostalgic expression.

“After Father protected me from the Fire Unicorn Continent, he suffered a backlash from the Path of Heaven. The current Guardian is no longer my father.”

Thinking of how his father risked his life to resist the Path of Heaven to protect him, tears could not help but well up in Qin Yu’s eyes.

“Qin Yu, you don’t have to blame yourself. Becoming a Guardian was your father’s choice, and saving you was also his choice. This is the cruelty of the path of cultivation. Who can truly let go of all fetters and become a heartless cultivation machine? This contradiction is indeed the reason the human race has been able to maintain its prosperity.”

Flower Granny gently rubbed Qin Yu’s head.

In the following days, Ji Yue was in charge of promoting the Human Race Watch.

She had been managing the Moon Listening Pavilion in purgatory for many years and handled various complicated matters in an orderly manner. The Brilliance of Stars and Moon cultivation technique was steadily promoted among those familiar with her.

However, as Dean Lei had predicted, only Reversion Void Stage cultivators were willing to cultivate this technique.

After becoming True Saint, most people would spend plenty of time and energy on their cultivation, and very few were willing to abandon their previous cultivation methods and switch to cultivating the Brilliance of Stars and Moon.

Judging from the current situation, Ji Yue planned to start imparting this cultivation technique to the Ji family and the cultivators of the Thunder Courtyard. The loyalty of the people in these two places was not a problem, and they were the mainstays of the Human Race Watch.

Moreover, Ji Yue divided the cultivation method into three parts to prevent this cultivation method from being spread to the alien race.

According to Lei Xin’s and Flower Granny’s analysis, this cultivation technique was only suitable for humans.

However, they had to prevent geniuses from the other three races from adapting it into a suitable cultivation technique. It would be a tremendous blow to the human race by that time.

In Sky City, it had become the contact point for the aristocratic families.

Especially after the Si family suffered a sneak attack from the monster race, other aristocratic families contacted each other more frequently.

Among the nine great aristocratic families, the Immortal Crane had led to the killing of the Ni family and the loss of its majority combat strength, and the Ji family had suffered huge losses due to the Ghostly Sword Evil Eye.

The corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor was in Qin Yu’s hands, and their right to speak was clearly weaker now.

The new forces had now become Yan, Ji, Yun, Teng, Gu, Jiang, and Qi, although there were still many differences among these seven forces after the fall of the three great families.

The eight forces had clearly put away their arrogance. Besides leaving behind some cultivators in purgatory, most of their strongest combat strength had returned to their families. The monster race’s subsequent sneak attacks had all failed.

The place was a sanctum with abundant spiritual energy surrounded by mountains.

According to the records of the Great Xia Royal Family in the library, this place was originally a massive mountain peak. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was once opened up by the ancestors of the Great Xia Royal Family, and the center part had been made into a sanctum.

The surroundings were formed by natural stones to absorb nature’s spiritual energy of heaven and earth. The people cultivating in the sanctum would have great benefits.

Nearly 50 people were discussing among them. These people were the true cores of the eight great strengths. Many of the major policies were being passed from here.

In the most recent monster race’s sneak attack, it was also here that the eight forces were commanded to cooperate and stop the demon attack.

Every second, countless messaging jade pendants would light up and send out new messages.

These people all emitted vast internal qi. These people were the true top-notch martial artists.

“I heard that Zhongzhou seems to have a new force called the Human Race Watch. It includes Lei Xin, Flower Granny, the traitor of the Yan family, the saintess, and others. One of them is called Qin Yu, and he has even pulled the Yao and Ji families down from their aristocratic families status. Recently, they have publicized it through various guilds and recruited many people. What do you think?”

The person who spoke was Yan Minglong, a high-ranking member of the Yan family who had once been stationed in the ninth level of purgatory.

“Currently, the three alien races are united, and the human race should stay united. Such a selfish act naturally requires us to send someone to take over. If there are any objections, we will use the power of lightning to destroy them.”

Hua Qianjie immediately responded. He was the one who had wanted to force Yan Ruoxue to become his Dao companion.

When he heard this, he was instantly furious.

“Now that the human race is in danger. Don’t simply start a war at will. There are many top-notch martial artists in the Human Race Watch, and it has only been established for a few weeks without harming the human race. Why do we use such an aggressive method? If the demon race sees this, they will think that the human race is starting an internal conflict again.”

Gu Baiyi sneered and denied Hua Qianjie’s words.

“Yes, what Baiyi said is reasonable. The urgent matter now is sending people to contact the Human Race Watch, hoping they can work together in the upcoming chaos, not suppress them without distinguishing right from wrong. Can our eight forces kill all those who form alliances? This is simply a joke.”

Jiang Qingyuan from the Jiang family also agreed with Gu Baiyi.

Hua Qianjie found it hard to maintain his composure, seeing his two suggestions being rejected by the two.

“This man is cruel and unscrupulous. Thunder Courtyard gave him the Heart of Thunder, but he instigated the disciples to rebel and take the cultivators of the two peaks away from Thunder Courtyard. He even severely injured the corpse of the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor and First Eder, who has yet to recover. Do you really think this kind of person will care about the overall situation? How ridiculous. Just wait. You will regret it!”

“I wouldn’t be worried if it were any other forces. However, this person is indeed too cruel. Many respected elders of our Ni family have died in his hands. It’s all thanks to him that our Si family has fallen.”

The person who spoke was Ni Qian, the youngest genius of the Ni family. He spoke indifferently.

Although the Ni family was no longer qualified to be ranked among the eight great forces, the family still had a certain degree of influencing power after the various powers returned.

However, their status would naturally not be the same as when they were among the nine great aristocratic families.

Gu Baiyi revealed a mocking smile.

“If Senior Baiyi says so, then Junior will have to speak from the standpoint of the human race.”

The few Supreme Elders of the Ni family behind him nodded at Ni Qian, and Ni Qian revealed a cold smile.
