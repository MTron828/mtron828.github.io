This slap was extremely powerful and extremely fast!

Before Bai Sha could even react, this slap landed heavily on his face!

Half of his face bone was directly shattered, and blood flowed down his damaged cheek and covered his entire body!

Qin Yu’s slap had undoubtedly shocked everyone!

Bai Sha was even more furious. He glared at Qin Yu and gritted his teeth. “You’re courting death! Kill him for me!”

The ten plus Martial Marquises present immediately charged at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu coldly swept his gaze across the crowd, and a trace of coldness flashed in his eyes.

In the next second, Qin Yu suddenly charged forward, and his figure suddenly disappeared!

A golden light shuttled through the crowd, and his golden fist contained the power to destroy everything!

Qin Yu wasn’t at a disadvantage in the face of these Martial Marquises.

He was full of energy, like an undefeated God of War!

With every punch, a Martial Marquis would fall to the ground!

In just a short hour, the Xue family was full of bloodshed! Several Martial Marquises collapsed to the ground, their bodies shattered!

On the other hand, Qin Yu was bathed in the blood of his enemies. The more he fought, the braver he became. He was like the grim reaper!

“Boom!”

Another golden fist directly shattered half of a Martial Marquis’ body!

Before he could react, Qin Yu had already reached into his dantian and roughly dug out his Golden Core!

Such a violent method made everyone feel terrified!

Bai Sha’s entire body trembled. He even lost the desire to fight back!

Seeing the ten Martial Marquises all fall to the ground, Bai Sha’s body completely went soft.

He looked at the young man in front of him in horror and said with a trembling voice, “Don’t... Don’t kill me...”

Qin Yu grabbed his head and lifted him up into the air.

The ice-cold killing intent almost made Bai Sha wet his pants.

“Take me to the Purple Flame Sect,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Bai Sha didn’t dare to say anything and hurriedly nodded. “Okay... okay.”

Qin Yu stuffed Bai Sha into the car with one hand and then sat on the side.

“Qin Yu, you... you have to be more careful,” Xue Yuzhi said worriedly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Auntie Xue, don’t worry.”

The car drove towards the Purple Flame Sect. A crafty look flashed across Bai Sha’s face.

“When you go to the Purple Flame Sect, I will tear you into pieces!” Bai Sha thought to himself.

This trace of craftiness didn’t escape Qin Yu’s eyes.

However, Qin Yu remained unmoved. He only closed his eyes slightly.

The people of the Xue family looked at each other in dismay.

Looking at the corpses lying on the ground in front of them, they were filled with terror.

“More than ten Martial Marquises died just like that...” Xue Yujie muttered in a low voice.

“Qin Yu... didn’t seem to have used the power of a Martial Saint just now...”

“This kid is clearly in the late stage of the Martial Marquis realm, yet he could easily crush people at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm. This is simply... unheard of!”

...

The car drove towards the Purple Flame Sect.

More than an hour later.

The car finally stopped in front of a house that looked like a castle.

“This... This is the place.” Bai Sha said in a trembling voice.

Qin Yu got down from the car.

A towering castle came into view.

High walls had been built around it. At a glance, it looked like a city.

And on the gate hung a few big words: Purple Flame Sect.

Qin Yu glanced at Bai Sha and said coldly, “Lead the way.”

Bai Sha didn’t dare to say anything and hurriedly walked forward.

The gate rumbled and slowly opened.

Bai Sha was the first to step in. As soon as he entered the gate, he immediately ran! His speed was astonishing! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Looking at his retreating figure, Qin Yu didn’t chase after him. Instead, he sneered.

He released his divine sense. His body was covered in golden light as he rose from the ground!

Following that, the golden glow on Qin Yu’s hand became increasingly resplendent. A terrifying power swept through the entire Purple Flame Sect!

In the next second, a huge golden fist suddenly condensed in the sky!

“Boom!”

This fist directly smashed down! The terrifying internal qi was like a bomb, quickly spreading in all directions!

The buildings of the Purple Flame Sect instantly collapsed! Those who couldn’t dodge in time were directly smashed into meat paste!

After the fist landed, Qin Yu strode towards the depths of the Purple Flame Sect.

“Stop, who are you?!” Someone strode forward, blocking Qin Yu’s path.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. Qin Yu raised his hand and smashed his head into pieces!

On the way, Qin Yu killed everyone he saw. No matter what cultivation level they were at, they all wanted to escape!

In a short while, more than a hundred people from the Purple Flame Sect died!

The entire Purple Flame Sect was covered in blood and corpses!

The smell of blood filled the entire Purple Flame Sect. At a glance, the Purple Flame Sect was like a bloodbath!

Such a cruel method was enough to shock the world!

However, Qin Yu didn’t feel the slightest bit of pity in his heart.

“Junior, stop!”

At this moment, an old man rushed over.

His eyes were scarlet red, and his eyes were widened as he stared at Qin Yu!

“You... you dared to kill the disciples of the Purple Flame Sect! I want you dead!” the old man roared angrily!

The entire city was shaken until it rumbled. The Purple Flame Sect, which had already been reduced to ruins, had completely collapsed at this moment!

Following the angry roar of the old man, Bai Sha also rushed out with more than ten Martial Marquises!

Qin Yu ignored Bai Sha. He looked coldly at the old man in front of him and said, “You are the sect master of the Purple Flame Sect?”

The old man clenched his teeth tightly. He didn’t pay attention to these words. Instead, he said in a somewhat dejected manner, “I have spent so much effort in order to establish the Purple Flame Sect. Now... it has been destroyed by your hands!”

“I will tear your tendons, skin you, and dismember you into thousands of pieces!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Don’t say such harsh words. If you have the ability, then use it.”

The old man glared at Qin Yu angrily. The internal qi a in his body was rising.

“Peak of the Martial Marquis Realm?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and then shook his head. “Since you dare to provoke the Xue family, which has the power of a Martial Saint, you must have a trump card. Hurry up and show it.”

The old man narrowed his eyes and said with a sinister tone, “Little b*stard, you know quite a lot! But to deal with you, I don’t need to use my trump card!”

After he finished speaking, the old man’s figure suddenly disappeared and appeared in front of Qin Yu in the next second!

His skinny body was extremely fast. His hands turned into claws and clawed at Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed!

Qin Yu kept dodging with his hands behind his back. He easily dodged every move.

“Ha!”

The old man suddenly let out a furious roar. His body suddenly burst into flames!

The flames turned into a totem and rushed towards Qin Yu!

Staring at the overwhelming totems, Qin Yu couldn’t help but snort coldly.

“Break for me!”

Qin Yu shouted. The Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist instantly rose up, and the golden fist instantly smashed towards the totem!

“Boom!”

This punch could destroy everything in its path. Its power was unimaginable! Under this punch, the totem collapsed instantly!
