Chapter 2762 - 2762: Awakening Failure

A dazzling red color seeped out from Lord Alester’s snow-white neck. A sense of confusion that she had never felt before surged into her pupils.

“How did you break through to the power of Holy Consciousness? This power has already surpassed the limits of the Saint Level!”

She muttered to herself in a daze.

“Don’t always think about limits. As long as you don’t become the number one expert in this Saint Kingdom, how will you know that you’ve reached your limits? You can only think about this when you reach that day.”

Qin Yu sneered and retracted the huge scythe into his body.

Lord Alester stood there silently. Her golden hair covered her delicate face. No one knew what she was thinking.

“Sir Dagger, I’ll borrow your strength to show off first.”

Lord Alester had just helped him, so he didn’t mind helping her in return.

One’s mind was already as calm as water at Lord Alester’s cultivation realm.

If something unexpected did not happen, it would be very difficult for her to have any fluctuations in her state of mind.

Qin Yu unleashed the Dance of Death’s power at Dao Realm level 9. It did shock her and gave her hope.

“My name is Reiya Alester. Alester is my surname. I belong to the Jiuli race.”

“My name is Qin Yu.”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Neither of them was talkative. After introducing themselves, they sat down in silence.

“Are you willing to tell me about your family?”

Qin Yu did not know much about this top-notch family, so he was a little curious.

“A family that has always been at the top. However, we have been at the top for too long. The patriarch, elder, and direct descendants have all become numb. They are killers, perverts, wanderers, and even toying with the Holy Consciousness of the entire country. The entire race is filled with the smell of blood. The bloodline power allows us to stand at the top without much cultivation. This is the Alester family, a rotten family that has fallen into hell.” Reiya did not hide any information.

“Let’s talk about you. What are your plans for the future? Are you planning to fight for the position in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom or what?” “I don’t know. Do you have any suggestions?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. He didn’t have a terrifying bloodline like Alester’s.

“I’ll first cultivate the power of the peak, then try to understand every place. Only when I see clearly with my eyes can I make a further choice.” Reiya placed her hand on Qin Yu’s forehead.

She was surprised that Qin Yu had not yet cultivated the peak power.

She thought that Qin Yu had used his peak power in the battle just now, but she did not expect that the power was Qin Yu’s physical strength.

She had never seen a person at this level who could temper his body to such a terrifying extent.

“What kind of power is the peak power? Why haven’t I felt it after I reached level

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“This was the threshold of Dao Realm level 9. Even after reaching the Holy Consciousness Realm, the peak power would follow you to the realm.

Thus, it could be said that the awakening of peak power was the biggest cultivation threshold after Dao Realm level 9.

Only by awakening the peak power can one be considered a Saint-Level expert.

Different peak powers have different characteristics. Once the peak power is awakened, even a level 10 peak power can kill a level 15 Dao Realm expert at the right time.”

Alester used her finger to draw a few patterns on the ground.

“Why is this power awakening? This is the awakening of power from your cultivation journey after you start cultivating. In other words, this power awakens from your cells and becomes real by a certain chance. This is the peak power.”

Alester’s body didn’t move at all.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt a bone-chilling chill envelop him.

The world in front of him seemed to have transformed into a world of sword intent.

He seemed out of place here. Countless substantial Spiritual Energy Sword pressed against his throat.

His Milky Way Holy Body was as fragile as paper facing the Spiritual Energy Sword.

The icy cold blade caused countless goosebumps to appear on Qin Yu’s neck.

Moreover, Qin Yu could even see the inscriptions on every sword. It was as if these swords were real.

The peak power grade could also increase as a person cultivated.

The sky in front of him suddenly crumpled like a piece of paper falling into water. Then, it slowly shrank, revealing the original world.

Then, the peak power entered Reiya Alester’s hand.

In the next moment, an unrivaled Spiritual Energy Sword shot out into the air.

Even the air seemed to have stopped. In the next moment, a huge sword scar appeared in the sky.

A violent force was sucked into the black hole. Countless houses on the mountain were sucked into it.

“This is my peak power.”

Alester put down her arm.

Qin Yu’s body turned cold. Only now did he understand how much Alester had given way during his battle with her.

He had entered the dream In the Heavenly Sin, so he did not sense how powerful Reiya’s sword was.

He could feel this power deep into his bones only when he faced it at such a close distance.

“The more focused a power is, the easier it is to awaken the peak power, and the easier it is to raise it to the limit. The members of the Alester family were born into the realm of sword intent. We cultivate sword sense since we are young. We have to bring our swords wherever we are starting from three years old, so our peak power was awakened naturally.”

Reiya Alester looked at Qin Yu and frowned slightly.

“Your cultivation system is too messy. The Dao of Dreams, the cultivation of Order in the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom, the holy body cultivated after birth, and the existence of the Heart of the Saint Kingdom. The power of your divine soul seems to have the power of the foreign race too. It’s very difficult to awaken your peak power in such a complicated internal environment.”

Qin Yu frowned. He had a headache.

The Alester family and many other families had a systematic cultivation system from the beginning.

It would subconsciously reduce the various messy systems of cultivation, reducing the different energies in the body and increasing the probability of awakening the peak power.

It was just like how some people had already seen their cultivation goals, so their cultivation would be much more efficient from the beginning.

His situation represented the majority of people. This was why many people found it difficult to awaken the peak power.

Farmer, Fisherman, and Rosacea of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom borrowed this power to awaken their powerful peak power.”

“But I don’t seem to have any such signs.”

Qin Yu was a little troubled.

“The power of your Dao of Dreams seemed to have offset the suppression of

Heavenly Sin. If I’m not wrong, you used the Dao of Dreams’ trump card, the Dream Wings. This confrontation saved you from death, but you lost an opportunity..”
