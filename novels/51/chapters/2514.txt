2515 The Hundred Year Agreement DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Revered Qi stood up and glanced around indifferently.

Instantly, the people caught in his gaze stopped arguing one after another.

The entire main hall became deathly silent again.

Revered Qi’s authority was something that even the Yan family’s Supreme Elder and the others dared not disobey.

“Qin Yu, are you dissatisfied with my arrangements?”

He said calmly, and a mountain-like pressure fell on Qin Yu.

“First of all, the supreme treasure that Ksitigarbha mentioned is the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes, not the Judge’s Brush. Secondly, all the members of Human Race Watch have joined voluntarily and acknowledged its principles. If the alliance sends people in, we can’t stop them from leaving. Thirdly, go to hell, you old fart! Go eat sh*t!”

The response to the three things was like a massive rock fell on the water.

Especially the third thing that Qin Yu found unbearable.

At this moment, the main hall was so quiet that one could even hear a needle falling to the ground.

No one had expected Qin Yu to respond to Revered Qi in such a way.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt a mountain-like pressure rushing toward him. It was the power of heaven and earth.

This casual attack was comparable to He Teng’s attack with full strength!

Qin Yu’s bones made a loud cracking sound, and in an instant, numerous cracks appeared all over his body.

If not for the Heart of the Ocean that surged at a terrifying speed throughout his body… other than his spine, everything else would have been crushed.

In less than half a width of breath, this force was directly blocked.

A sword stabbed between the two, and Su Xinghe of Kunlun descended indifferently.

“Brother Su, are you dissatisfied with my intentions?”

“It’s open to discussion. Moreover, if you use your strength to kill this junior, I will look down on you.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was instantly in a transparent cubic world.

There were green grass and white cloud and smoke rising from the chimneys. It seemed to be a real world.

Collapse of Heaven and Earth.

As Revered Qi finished his sentence, boundless energy fluctuations surged in the world as if the world was trembling. Dark clouds covered the sky, lightning interweaved, and thunder roared. It was as if the gods released their anger at this moment.

The ground began to crack, mountains and rivers collapsed, and the earth churned. Countless cracks spread in all directions, forming a terrifying scene.

The entire world became a model.

The faces of the surrounding people turned ashen. Despite the protection of the world cube, they could all feel the dreadful tremors.

“Is this the might of those at the fifth level and above?”

At that moment, almost everyone forgot what was happening around them.

They were greedily watching this rare battle. This scene was rare, even during the previous war between the two races.

There might not be many opportunities to see this, and such close-range observation might not even be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

A white light suddenly flashed from the world. The sword light tore through the air, bringing violent shock waves that spread in all directions.

All obstacles completely shattered wherever the sword passed, and no power could resist it. The sword energy instantly pierced through the mountains and rivers, flattening the mountains.

The sword came to the edge of the world in a breath.

The world was destroyed, and Spiritual Energy Sword energy fell.

The two stood facing each other.

“If you want to fight, I will accompany you.”

Su Xinghe held his sword in one hand and did not retreat at all.

At their level, their willpower was as strong as steel, and they would not change their minds easily.

Revered Qi believed that Qin Yu might cause harm to the human race in the future. Despite Qin Yu’s performance several times in a row, he still could not let go of the uneasiness in his heart. What he did was to wipe out Qin Yu directly.

Xiao Sheng, Xiao Hai, He Teng, and the masked woman were all from the human race. They had now become a formidable aid to the alien race against the human race.

And Qin Yu’s path of anomaly made him feel even more uneasy.

This uneasiness had increased rapidly, especially after Qin Yu had survived He Teng’s attack.

If given time, he might become another masked woman. This was something that the human race could not accept before the crisis.

But to Su Xinghe, he had gone too far.

He made such a judgment without any substantial evidence.

Although he could understand Revered Qi’s concerns, he did not consider the concerns of the cultivators of the human race.

“It’s very simple. Si Shiyue, don’t you want to dual cultivate with Yan Ruoxue? Then you defeat him first.”

Divine Night Sect’s loli said with a smile.

He stared at the two and spoke.

“During this chaotic time, the weak have no right to speak no matter where they are.”

“Si Shiyue, is this what you think too?”

Qin Yu ignored Revered Qi and squinted at Si Shiyue.

“Qin Yu, we originally had a hundred-year agreement. Now that you can’t defeat me, you should give up.”

Si Shiyue said softly.

“With my current cultivation realm, I feel like I’ve vaguely touched the barrier. If I can dual cultivate with Yan Ruoxue, my comprehension of the Way of Five Elements can also help her improve her Way of Space. This is a win-win situation for both of us. Your Way of Anomaly itself is not accepted by the Path of Heavenly. Even if you have some achievements now, ultimately, you belong to a different, less established path.”

Si Shiyue said indifferently.

After this breakthrough to the fourth level, he soared to new heights directly. He vaguely grasped some insights and wanted to take a step further. Hence, he strongly felt the idea of forming the Dao companion with Yan Ruoxue.

“Hahaha, Si Shiyue, you’ve secluded yourself for a hundred years only to dig deeper into a dead end. You can’t break through on your own, and now you’re seeking assistance from others. I used to consider you my greatest rival, but from today onward, you’ll be erased from that position in my mind.”

Qin Yu laughed frantically and pointed at Si Shiyue.

“I’m different from you. Ruoxue and I want to become Dao companions for no other reason. We’re both willing. She’s willing to marry me, and I’m willing to marry her. Who do you think you are, Si Shiyue? You think you can snatch Ruoxue away?”

“I’m indeed different from you in this aspect, which is why you’re destined to fail to break through to this level. My goal is to obtain the ultimate power, no matter what method or price I have to pay. When you reach my cultivation realm and touch the power of the breakthrough, you’ll understand that sense of urgency. From the perspective of righteousness, it serves the greater cause of the human race. How can it be compared to the bond between you two?”

Si Shiyue paused for a moment and then continued.

“Furthermore, if Ruoxue breaks through that tremendously difficult realm because she becomes my Dao companion, how do you know if she will still make today’s decision?”

“Si Shiyue, I didn’t expect you to not only be so shameless but also not care about your reputation anymore.”

Qin Yu sneered and said.
