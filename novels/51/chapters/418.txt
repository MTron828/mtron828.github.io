Chapter 419: Pure Physical Collision! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Elder Zhuo was filled with exasperation. He fiercely glared at Yao Qing and said coldly, “You better stop talking, or I’ll throw you into the river and feed you to the fish!”

At this point, Elder Zhuo had no other choice.

He could only take a step back and let Huang Biao show off.

Huang Biao slowly walked in front of Qin Yu. His huge figure formed a sharp contrast with Qin Yu.

“I heard that your physical body is invincible. I really want to see if it’s true today,” Huang Biao said coldly.

“Ever since I stepped into the Grandmaster realm, no one in the same realm has ever been my match. They can’t even break through my defense. As for you, I’m afraid it’s no different.”

As he spoke, the internal qi on Huang Biao’s body began to rise rapidly.

His originally strong body expanded once again at this moment!

His dark golden skin instantly flickered with radiance, as if it was plated with a layer of golden armor!

The absolute pressure caused people to exclaim in admiration!

On the other hand, Qin Yu’s body looked extremely weak.

It even made people wonder if Qin Yu could withstand Huang Biao’s punch!

“Come, let me see your physical body,” Huang Biao said coldly.

Qin Yu looked at Huang Biao and nodded. “Your physical body is quite impressive. You must have suffered a lot to train to this extent. Are you willing to die here?”

Anger flashed across Huang Biao’s face. He clenched his fist and raised it. A fist the size of a casserole came down from the sky and smashed fiercely at Qin Yu!

This was the purest physical strength! The powerful pressure caused the ground beneath Qin Yu’s feet to sink!

Just the wind from his fist was enough to send sand and rocks flying. The power of this punch was unimaginable!

“As expected of a Cross-training Grandmaster!” Even Elder Zhuo clicked his tongue in wonder!

“Boom!”

This punch landed squarely on Qin Yu’s chest.

Qin Yu retreated three steps in succession.

However, there was no expression of pain on his face.

“Not bad.” Qin Yu patted the dust on his chest and nodded slightly.

Huang Biao sneered. “Quit putting on an act. I’m afraid your internal organs have been shattered, right?”

Qin Yu sneered. “If my internal organs were shattered by this level of attack, I might as well die.”

“You dare to underestimate me?!” Huang Biao flew into a rage!

He didn’t say anything more. His huge fist smashed towards Qin Yu once again!

This time, Qin Yu didn’t take it head on. His figure was graceful as he jumped to the side.

“Boom!”

Huang Biao’s fist smashed onto the ground!

A huge pit with a diameter of several meters instantly appeared on the ground!

Countless pieces of gravel shot up like bullets!

Hiss...

When everyone saw this, they couldn’t help but gasp!

If such a terrifying power smashed onto the body, what kind of consequences would it have?

They didn’t dare to imagine it!

“Don’t even think about escaping!”

Huang Biao raised his head to look at Qin Yu. He relied solely on the strength of his physical body to shoot up into the air!

His fist was like a cannonball, bringing a bright light with it as it ruthlessly smashed towards Qin Yu!

“Not bad.” Qin Yu praised from the bottom of his heart.

Huang Biao’s physical body far surpassed Tao Shan’s!

Qin Yu no longer dodged, and clashed with Huang Biao head-on.

“Dang dang dang” the sounds of clashing rang out incessantly.

This was a clash of pure physical strength. The moment the two fists clashed, a shocking loud sound rang out!

Compared to the clash of spells, the Clash of physical strength was purer and more powerful!

Everyone was dumbfounded. With such physical strength, it was likely that they had long surpassed steel.

“The bodies of these two people are simply freaky,” someone muttered.

“Just their physical bodies alone can probably level a small mountain.” Even Elder Zhuo felt shocked.

The physical confrontation between the two sides had reached a white-hot state. Their bodies created a huge heat wave as they rubbed against each other.

The heat wave in their faces was difficult to withstand.

Huang Biao panted heavily. He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “Your physical body really lives up to its reputation.”

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and nodded slightly. “You’re not bad either. You’re the first person who can last to this extent with just your physical body.”

Huang Biao’s lips curled into a cold smile.

He restrained his internal qi and looked at Qin Yu coldly. He said, “Unfortunately, you’re still not my match.”

“Oh yeah?” Qin Yu raised his brows.

Could it be that... Huang Biao still had some trump card?

As expected, the internal qi on Huang Biao’s body began to climb along the bracelet.

Streams of white qi energy slowly gathered around his body.

The energy seemed to come from all directions and surged into every cell in Huang Biao’s body!

“Ah!!!”

Then, Huang Biao clenched his fists and roared furiously! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The skin on his body turned golden in an instant!

Even his pores turned golden!

An oppressive feeling filled the air.

Huang Biao looked at Qin Yu and sneered. “This is the vajra body protection technique that I found in Western sect books. With the support of this technique, my body will be indestructible. Even if it’s a cannonball, I can crush it with one hand!”

“Qin Yu, try again!”

Before he finished his words, Huang Biao rushed over again!

This time, his strength and physical body had undergone a qualitative change!

The qi energy seemed like it cut through the sky, and his incomparably fierce fist smashed straight towards Qin Yu!

“Good timing!” Qin Yu’s eyes were filled with battle intent!

He clenched his fist and rose up to meet it head-on!

“Dang!”

A sonic boom exploded in the air!

Everyone covered their ears at this moment!

“Whoosh!”

The incomparably powerful force sent Qin Yu flying!

His body drew a beautiful parabola in the air, and finally smashed into the ground!

On the ground, a huge pit that was several meters deep appeared!

Waves of white smoke floated up from the huge pit.

“We won?” Everyone hurriedly looked in the direction of the huge pit.

“It’s not over yet!” Huang Biao roared!

Following that, they saw his fist flickering with golden light. An incomparably fierce physical force gathered on his fist.

“Boom!”

Huang Biao spread out his fists to attack the huge pit.

One, two, three!

The indiscriminate attacks almost shattered the entire ground!

The huge pit was completely turned into ruins.

Everyone seemed to feel an earthquake, and afraid of being affected, they all cast spells to float in the air!

“Mr. Qin!” Yao Qing roared inside, and clenched his fists!

After a round of bombardment, Huang Biao finally stopped.

He looked at the huge pit coldly and sneered. “I’ve always said that my physical body is truly unparalleled in the world!”

“That’s not necessarily true.”

Just as Huang Biao was roaring, a golden figure shot out from the huge pit!
