Chapter 337: The Divine Alchemist Pavilion Wasn’t Afraid of Anyone! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with the Third Elder. In any case, he was already prepared to leave the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, so he wasn’t afraid at all.

The group of people stood under the sun while quietly waiting for the return of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s Pavilion Master.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, an hour had passed.

Under the sun, everyone was sweating profusely.

“Why isn’t the Pavilion Master back yet?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Taozi said from the side, “Who knows? Don’t these so-called big shots have to put on airs?”

Qin Yu thought that she had a point.

At this moment, a car finally appeared at the entrance of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

A Rolls-royce was glistening under the sunlight.

After the car stopped, two men quickly got out of the car and opened the back door.

Not long after, a young girl got out of the car.

The young girl looked like she was only 17 or 18 years old. Her fair skin looked creamy, and her thighs were slender and fair. She was extremely sexy.

And on her face, there was an indescribable coldness that didn’t seem to match her age.

Qin Yu muttered, “The Pavilion Master has a Daughter?”

“Don’t talk nonsense! She is the Pavilion Master!” Someone beside him scolded softly.

Qin Yu’s face was immediately filled with shock, and his mouth dropped open.

This young lady was the famous Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?

“The Pavilion Master... is actually a child?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but say.

“I told you not to spout nonsense! Pavilion Master is already over sixty years old!” The person beside him said with a glare.

This immediately shocked Qin Yu! This little girl was actually over sixty years old? How did she do maintenance?

“Welcome back, Pavilion Master!” The moment the Divine Alchemist Pavilion Master stepped in, everyone shouted in unison!

The Pavilion Master’s expression was somewhat cold.

In the face of everyone’s welcoming, she acted as if she didn’t see it.

Everyone uniformly opened a path for the Pavilion Master, and each person’s face was filled with respect.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little curious. He tried to release his divine sense to probe the Pavilion Master’s strength.

However, the moment Qin Yu’s divine sense stretched out, it was forcefully cut off!

At the same time, the Pavilion Master’s gaze also landed on Qin Yu.

The coldness on her face deepened!

Not only that, but the Pavilion Master also walked towards Qin Yu step by step.

Although she only had the appearance of a teenager, the powerful aura on her body still made people break out in cold sweat!

“Kid, you’re dead meat!” Seeing this, the Third Elder couldn’t help but sneer inside.

Soon, the Pavilion Master walked to Qin Yu.

She looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You seem to be very interested in me.”

Everyone was frightened at this moment!

“Pavilion Master, he...”

“Did I ask you?” The Fifth Elder was about to explain, but was coldly interrupted by the Pavilion Master.

The Fifth Elder, not daring to say a single word, immediately fell silent.

Despite being under such powerful pressure, Qin Yu grinned.

“Pavilion Master, I don’t think anyone would be uninterested in you, the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, right?” Qin Yu said truthfully.

“Qin Yu, be mindful of your attitude when you speak!” The Fifth Elder reminded anxiously.

Qin Yu didn’t care.

He didn’t believe that the Pavilion Master would do anything to him just because of a sentence.

“You are that newcomer, Qin Yu?” The Pavilion Master sized up Qin Yu, and a mysterious look seemed to flash in her eyes.

This couldn’t help but make Qin Yu feel a little baffled.

Because... He kept feeling that he had an indescribable special feeling towards the Pavilion Master.

“Yes, greetings, Pavilion Master.” Qin Yu didn’t think much of it and replied politely.

The Pavilion Master nodded and turned to leave.

At this moment, the Third Elder walked up quickly.

“Pavilion Master, I have something to tell you!” The Third Elder said anxiously.

The Pavilion Master glanced at him and motioned for him to continue.

The Third Elder pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Pavilion Master, Qin Yu has disregarded the rules of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion! He even beat someone up!”

“The young master of the Han family, Han Shixun, came to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion to get the medicine, but his dantian was shattered by his kick!”

Hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but gasp!

The Fifth Elder’s expression was extremely ugly! There was even a trace of sweat on his forehead.

“Pavilion Master, it was Han Shixun who provoked him first! Qin Yu refined pills for him many times, but he deliberately made things difficult for him!” Taozi hurriedly explained.

“Pavilion Master, just as Taozi said, Han Shixun indeed intended to make things difficult for Qin Yu.” The Fifth Elder also hurriedly said.

“Moreover... the one who should have done the consultation for Han Shixun should have been the Third Elder!”

“The Third Elder clearly knows that Qin Yu has a grudge with the Han family, but he deliberately let Qin Yu do the consultation for Han Shixun! All of this is tied to the Third Elder!”

The Third Elder didn’t panic at all. He said indifferently, “I didn’t know whether there is a grudge or not. I only know that he hit someone, and it wasn’t an ordinary person!”

“Pavilion Master, this is against the Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s rules!”

The Pavilion Master didn’t say a word, and the scene was silent.

The tense atmosphere made people feel suffocated.

Finally, the Pavilion Master spoke.

She turned around and glanced at the Third Elder. She said indifferently, “So you think that the pharmacist of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion should endure bullying and provocation?”

The Third Elder’s expression immediately changed when he heard these words!

What did this mean? Could it be that the Pavilion Master felt that there was no problem with Qin Yu’s actions?

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel dumbstruck! The Pavilion Master’s attitude was completely different from what he had thought!

“Pavilion Master, but... but he is after all breaking the rules that you set...” The Third Elder said with unwillingness to give up.

The Pavilion Master said coldly, “Indeed, pharmacists can’t hit people, but under the premise of mutual respect.”

“Do you expect pharmacists to bow and scrape after being humiliated in public? That’s called cowardice.”

The Pavilion Master’s attitude shocked almost everyone!

They even suspected that Qin Yu and the Pavilion Master had some special relationship! Otherwise, why would she defend Qin Yu to this extent?!

“Pavilion Master, Han Shixun is after all a member of the Han family. Since Qin Yu crippled Han Shixun, the Han family won’t let this matter rest...” The Third Elder said with a sheepish smile.

The Pavilion Master said coldly, “What, do you think the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is afraid of the Han family?”

Everyone gasped!

It seemed that the Pavilion Master was going to protect Qin Yu!

“Pavilion Master, Qin Yu is tarnishing the image of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!” The Third Elder was still unwilling to give up.

The Pavilion Master’s expression finally turned cold.

Even the others couldn’t help but secretly curse the Third Elder for being an idiot. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The Pavilion Master was clearly trying to defend Qin Yu! The Third Elder was still not giving up. Wasn’t he shooting himself in the foot?

“Han Shixun should have been received by you, but you handed this job that belongs to you to Qin Yu.”

“At the root of it, you are the culprit,” the Pavilion Master said coldly.

At this point, the Pavilion Master swept her gaze over everyone and said coldly, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion isn’t afraid of anyone. I will naturally give an explanation to the Han family.”

“As for you, from today onwards, you are no longer an elder of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. You are demoted to an ordinary alchemist.” The Pavilion Master looked coldly at the Third Elder.
