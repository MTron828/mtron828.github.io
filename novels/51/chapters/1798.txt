1799 Forbidden Zone

When Qin Yu and Jue Wu passed through the city gate, the guards didn’t check them but let them pass.

Different from the cities in East Continent and Nanzhou, this place did not look as prosperous, but their auras were more powerful. Moreover, each of them seemed to be surging with a strong battle intent.

“The natives here seem to be very warlike,” Jue Wu said in a low voice.

“Hmm.” Qin Yu nodded, but he was more concerned about how to escape from this city.

Once Yang Yu was killed, the entire city would probably be sealed.

With Qin Yu and Jue Wu’s abilities, it was impossible for them to break this city by force.

“I have to come up with a strategy,” Qin Yu said to himself.

The two followed the route and walked in the direction of Yang Yu’s house.

When they arrived near his house, Qin Yu found a tavern and sat down.

“Don’t drink too much. We have something important to do later,” Qin Yu reminded Jue Wu as soon as they sat down.

“Alas, don’t worry.” Jue Wu waved her hand.

Jue Wu asked for two bottles of wine and handed one to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked in the direction of the Yang family and noticed that their residence was extremely grand. Obviously, Yang Yu was pretty prestigious in the area.

This kind of person was most likely related to the City Lord. In this case, Qin Yu had to find a way to escape.

“This place isn’t too close to our teleportation formation. If I use the line word formula, there’s a sliver of hope,” Qin Yu thought.

As long as she could get out of this city, Qin Yu would most likely be able to escape from this place.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu knew he needed more information from the locals.

Qin Yu glanced around the tavern, found a friendly man, and walked toward him.

Qin Yu said politely after sitting down, “Sir, I’ve just arrived at Heavenly Ocean City from Zhongzhou. I heard that there are six Forbidden Zones on Crimson Moon Continent. Do you know where they are?”

The man glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Do People from Zhongzhou all have a death wish?”

“I heard that there’s some treasure there, so I don’t want to give up,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

The man snorted and said, “You people from Zhongzhou make me sick. You treat the locals as worthless cannon fodder! Because you explored the Forbidden Zone a few times before, tens of thousands of our people died. How do you dare to stay here?”

Qin Yu suddenly had a bad feeling. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was obvious people from Crimson Moon Continent didn’t have a good impression of Zhongzhou.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to say something, but the man scolded him, ” “Fu*k off, or I will kick your ass!”

Jue Wu, who was not far away, heard someone yell at Qin Yu. She slammed the table and stood up immediately.

Fortunately, Qin Yu stopped her in time, so she didn’t cause any big trouble.

Qin Yu sat down at the table, feeling somewhat frustrated.

“I shouldn’t have mentioned Zhongzhou,” Qin Yu sighed and said.

“It’s fine. We’ll just go somewhere else and ask around,” Jue Wu said.

“I guess we have no other choice then,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu immediately stood up and left the tavern.

They circled around the Yang family, planning to find a new place to gather information.

However, not long after they walked, Qin Yu and Jue Wu noticed something was wrong.

“There’s someone.” Qin Yu frowned.

“Yep,” Jue Wu said, “someone has been following us since we left that tavern.”

The two stayed calm but were ready to escape.

Soon, someone blocked their way.

This person’s luxurious outfit and elegant manner showed that he was from a decent family.

Qin Yu frowned, looked at the man vigilantly, and said, “Is there anything we can help, sir?”

The man smiled. “My friend, chill down. I just heard you came from Zhongzhou, so I want to say hi.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this.

However, the next second, Qin Yu noticed that something was wrong!

Why did this person want to talk to them? Could it be that he was also from Zhongzhou?

“Are… Are you also from Zhongzhou?” Qin Yu asked.

“I am from the Gu family of Zhongzhou. May I know your name?” The man bowed slightly and smiled.

“The Gu family of Zhongzhou… One of the nine great aristocratic families!” Jue Wu, who was next to him, frowned.

Qin Yu was stunned and said, without thinking twice, “You… You’re from one of the nine great aristocratic families?”

“You can say so.” The young man nodded.

He bowed and said, “Do I have the honor to buy you two a drink?”

Qin Yu nodded without thinking. “Alright,” he said.

He could use this opportunity to get information from him and perhaps obtain some unexpected gains.

Qin Yu followed the young man to a tavern.

After entering, the young man introduced himself, “My name is Gu Sanchen.”

“I’m Qin Yu,” Qin Yu said with a nod.

Gu Sanchen smiled. “Nice to meet you, Brother Qin. You’re from the Qin family, right?”

Qin Yu didn’t know anything about the Qin family. However, Gu Sanchen mentioned it, so he could only nod and answer, “Exactly.”

At this point, Qin Yu looked around and found Gu Sanchen had no subordinates.

This surprised Qin Yu. He frowned and asked, “Brother Gu, you’re from the Gu family, so how are you traveling alone?”

Gu Sanchen laughed. “I’m indeed a member of the Gu family, but I’m not considered a direct descendant. Besides, I’m going out this time to gain experience. There’s no need for me to bring anyone along.”

It suddenly dawned on Qin Yu that such an aristocratic family probably had countless descendants, and someone not directly related to the core members of the family might receive fewer recourses.

For example, because of Yan Ruoxue’s powerful bloodline, even the Yan family would still protect her wherever she was.

After some chit-chat, Qin Yu found that Gu Sanchen was different from other rich kids from aristocratic families. Instead, he was approachable and down-to-earth.

“Brother Qin, may I ask if you really want to go to Forbidden Zone?” Gu sanchen asked.

“Yes, what about you?” Qin Yu nodded.

“Same here.” Gu Sanchen said.

“I’ve always been curious about Forbidden Zones. For so many years, no one has ever known what’s in those six Forbidden Zones,” Gu Sanchen continued.

Qin Yu knew something was up and was about to change the topic, but Gu Sanchen immediately said, “Brother Qin, may I come with you if you don’t mind?”

“Well…” Qin Yu was in a dilemma.

Although he wanted to visit Forbidden Zone, he knew he’d better stay away from there.

“It’s a deal then. Let’s see each other here tomorrow,” Gu sanchen stood up and said before Qin Yu could say anything.
