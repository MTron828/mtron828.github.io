Chapter 2769: The Buddhist Sect Bracelet

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The gap was a little strange. It seemed to be able to correspond.

Qin Yu carefully pieced it together, only then did he discover that it could form two runes.

However, these two rune seemed to be quite ancient. He did not recognize these two words.

Moreover, it seemed impossible to determine its meaning from the shape.

“This seems to be the text of the ancient Buddhist Sect. You can’t tell its meaning just by looking at the shape.”

A voice suddenly sounded from behind him. It was the lady who had been chatting with the spaceship owner.

“Do you know what it means?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He did not like people who came uninvited.

“This involves the secret of the ancient Buddhist Sect. The sect was the most primitive inheritance and the strictest religion. The Buddhist rune even added secrets. Only by studying the Buddhist Heart Sutra and its inner meaning for a long time can one judge its meaning. These two words mean start over.”

The lady’s expression was a little fanatical as if she was interested in this kind of text from the bottom of her heart.

Start over?

Was there some special meaning behind this?

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Then what does the rune here represent?”

Qin Yu carefully examined the bracelet on the right side. It was also made up of six bones of different sizes.

They could also form two matching runes from the left to the right.

“If I’m not wrong, these two runes mean ‘new life’. Can I take a closer look?”

The lady said softly.

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment before nodding in agreement.

No matter what, this lady had given him a rough idea of what the two bracelets meant.

Seeing Qin Yu nod, she carefully touched the material on it.

Her expression was solemn and sacred as if she was holding a treasure.

She carefully put it down after a long time.

“I came up with these two words only by guessing. I can only be 80% sure.”

“Why do you know the ancient Buddhist scriptures?”

Qin Yu asked tentatively.

If he was not mistaken, the lady in front of him should be at level 5 of Dao Consciousness.

She was considered a relatively weak existence on this ship, but she could recognize the Buddhist Sect characters. Moreover, she was not someone from the Buddhist Sect from the internal qi on her body.

Thus, Qin Yu was also somewhat vigilant.

“It’s not just the ancient Buddhist Sect. I’m also quite proficient in the cultures and languages of the Daoist, Confucian, Evil Moon Clan, Jiuli Clan, Netherworld Clan, and Origin Demon Clan. My cultivation and talent are limited, but I’m more interested in this culture. This trip to Nine Nether Cliff includes the Evil Moon Clan and Jiuli Clan. I’m here to try to obtain their culture.”

“What’s your name?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

When this lady was talking, she had another kind of elegant temperament.

He had sensed this internal qi from many knowledgeable people. He could also sense it from this lady now, so she shouldn’t be lying.

“Luo Xueyi.”

“Thank you, Miss Luo Xueyi, for clearing my doubts! ”

Qin Yu cupped his fists solemnly.

“I also want to thank you for letting me come into contact with new things. Previously, I only read the relevant content from the broken scroll. This is the first time I’ve come into contact with the real thing. From a Buddhist point of view, these bones are extremely sacred things. Try not to take them off, sir.

Perhaps they will protect you at a critical moment.”

Luo Xue Yi said with a smile. She was in a good mood.

Looking at the bracelet in his hand, Qin Yu hesitated but he did not take it off.

His originally calm mood was disturbed by the appearance of the monk.

The second tribulation. The monk seemed to be aware of his Ethereal Enlightenment, which made him feel uneasy.

However, Qin Yu still judged that the monk should not have any hostility towards him for the time being.

Otherwise, the monk should be able to create some trouble for him with his ability.

Qin Yu felt a headache coming on. He could not guess it now.

Was his second tribulation related to this monk or what would happen after the monk?

“Oh right, I saw a similar bracelet in the Endless Mine. That person seemed to be from the Buddhist Sect, but he gave me a terrifying feeling. I feel that something bad will happen if I rashly approach him.” Luo Xueyi said in shock as she remembered something.

“The same? Are you sure?”

Qin Yu was greatly shocked.

“It should belong to the same Buddhist Sect culture and come from the same country as the two bracelets in your hands. However, I only took a glance at it at that time and could not tell what it meant. That person is very strong and should be far above you.” “Oh! Can you feel my strength?”

Qin Yu was curious.

“I can sense a person’s malice. For example, I dare to approach you rashly because you don’t have any bad feelings towards me. The judgment of strength comes from my intuition. This intuition seems to be innate. My master said that my judgment has always been very accurate. Remember to run away immediately if you meet that person and he has a bracelet around his neck like yours. ”

Luo Xueyi said to Qin Yu solemnly.

“I once saved the entire sect because of my intuition. Don’t underestimate me! At that time, Rosacea came to our sect and was very rude. My master wanted to teach him a lesson but I stopped him. Later only did he realize that the person was Rosacea, one of the three great Holy Consciousness. His pet had suddenly died, so he was full of hostility. However, he is good at concealing his internal qi. Even the sect’s spirit detection magical artifact couldn’t detect his strength, but I sensed that he was very dangerous!”

Luo Xue Yi seemed to think Qin Yu didn’t care about what she said, so she added angrily.

Qin Yu was a little surprised that Luo Xueyi could sense the danger of a Holy Consciousness yop-notch martial artist.

Her power was very strange then. She couldn’t sense it with her realm.

“Could it be that this is also a kind of peak power? However, her cultivation realm is far from level 9.”

Qin Yu frowned and guessed.

After talking with Luo Xue Yi, the entire spaceship shook.

“Get ready to go to Nine Nether Cliff. Everyone, get ready to disembark.

Remember to bring your belongings!”

The boss’s loud voice spread to all parts of the spaceship. “Big Brother Qin Yu, we’ll meet again if fate allows us to!”

Luo Xueyi said with a smile.

She jumped off and left with her shaking ponytail before the spaceship stopped.

“What a passionate little girl. I was as energetic as her back then!”

The boss said to Qin Yu with a smile.

Qin Yu said with a smile. He also jumped down and stepped on the ground of the Nine Nether Cliff.

Under his feet was a hard boulder covered in black moss..
