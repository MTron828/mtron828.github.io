1823 The Reason Behind the Immortal Slaying Sect’s Destruction

Dean Lei shook his head and did not explain.

“Does this young man actually have an impressive background?” the old man beside him was puzzled and asked.

No matter how he looked at Qin Yu, he didn’t look like a young master from an aristocratic family.

He was extremely puzzled by what Dean Lei had said today.

At this moment, Dean Lei said slowly, “I’ve only just found out about the kid’s identity.”

!!

“Is his father very powerful?” the old man was puzzled and asked.

Dean Lei looked at him and opened his mouth, but did not say anything in the end.

At this moment, the peak master had brought Qin Yu to the first main peak.

“I’m telling you, I’ve tried my best. But there’s a 99% chance that Dean Lei won’t agree to it,” The peak Master said in a deep voice.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “Thank you, Peak Master.”

The peak master didn’t have any hope at all because the entire Thunder Courtyard was extremely cautious about anything concerning the Immortal Emperor’s Big Grave.

Not to mention getting close to it, even mentioning it would be a great disrespect to the Immortal Emperor.

Therefore, the peak master was extremely nervous.

However, he had already agreed to it, so he could only brace himself and walk in.

“Dean Lei.” The peak master walked forward and bowed slightly to Dean Lei.

Dean Lei glanced at the peak master and said, “Is Qin Yu outside?”

The peak master nodded and said, “Yes, Dean Lei. He’s waiting outside.”

Dean Lei was silent. He squinted his eyes and looked at Qin Yu through the city wall. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After sizing him up carefully, Dean Lei frowned slightly.

He quickly retracted his gaze, looked at the peak master, and asked, “How’s Qin Yu’s recent performance?”

The peak master was taken aback. Obviously, he did not expect Dean Lei to be so concerned about Qin Yu.

“Not bad. This kid has a sense of tenacity, and he’s not afraid of anything,” the peak master answered truthfully.

The peak master then told Dean Lei about what had happened.

Dean Lei couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that.

“Not bad,” Dean Lei stroked his beard, smiled, and said.

Hearing Dean Lei’s words, the peak master was even more confused.

What was wrong with Dean Lei today? He was so generous with his praises!

“Tell me, why are you seeing me?” Dean Lei asked the peak master.

The peak master swallowed his saliva as if he didn’t dare to speak.

“Say it if you have something.” Seeing the peak master’s worry, Dean Lei said indifferently.

The peak master gritted his teeth and said, “Dean Lei, I know this is impossible, but I have promised Qin Yu. I can only come and ask you. If you disagree, please forgive me.”

“Speak out,” Dean Lei said indifferently.

The peak master took a deep breath and said, “Qin Yu… Qin Yu said he wanted to go to the Immortal Emperor’s tomb to cultivate…”

It was just a short sentence, but the peak master’s voice became softer and softer. It was enough to show how unconfident he was.

Perhaps he was afraid that the dean would be angry, so the peak master hurriedly explained, “Due to Qin Yu’s unique physique, he needs dark energy to cultivate. I know this kid is delusional, but…”

“I agree to it.”

Before the peak master could finish speaking, Dean Lei interrupted him.

“I know you would disagree… What? You… Did you say you agreed?” The peak master was stunned. His eyes were wide open as if he had heard the most outrageous thing in the world.

“Go back and tell Qin Yu I’ll personally send him to the vicinity of the tomb in a few days,” Dean Lei said indifferently.

The peak master seemed to be in a daze. He stood there dumbfounded, not saying a word.

The dean didn’t say much to him. With a wave of his hand, a gentle force sent the peak master to Qin Yu.

The peak master stood in front of Qin Yu like a statue.

His jaw almost dropped to the ground, and his brain was buzzing.

“Hey, Peak Master, are you alright?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask curiously.

The peak master finally came back to his senses. He shook his head hard and looked at Qin Yu.

“Qin… Qin Yu, what’s your background?” The peak master swallowed his saliva.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What background could I have? Peak Master, what’s going on? Did Dean Lei agree to it or not?”

The peak master sized Qin Yu up carefully. After ensuring Qin Yu did not seem to be lying, he coughed and said indifferently, “The dean has granted you permission to cultivate near the ancestral grave. Three days later, the dean will personally take you there.”

Qin Yu was overjoyed when he heard this.

“Many thanks, Peak Master!” Qin Yu said as he bowed.

“There’s no need to thank me,” the peak master laughed and said. “If you really want to thank me, fulfill your promise.”

“Definitely!” Qin Yu nodded hard.

The two didn’t stay any longer and immediately rushed from the first main peak to the eighth main peak.

Along the way, the peak master was feeling extremely uneasy.

As he had been in Demon-slaying Peak for many years, he knew what the ancestral grave of the Immortal Emperor meant.

Not to mention Qin Yu, even the people from the nine great aristocratic families could not get close to it!

It was because the Immortal Emperor’s secret treasures were buried there!

It was no exaggeration to say that such secret treasures were enough to create a prosperous sect!

But this time, Dean Lei had agreed so readily. It was enough to show that Qin Yu’s identity was indeed not simple!

“By the way, Peak Master, have you ever heard of the Immortal Slaying Sect?” Qin Yu by the side suddenly asked.

The peak master came back to his senses. He nodded and said, “Yes, I’ve heard of it. Rumor has it that it used to be a very powerful sect.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. Then he said, “Do you know anything about this Immortal Slaying Sect?”

“Not really,” the peak master said as he rubbed his chin.

“As far as I know, when the Immortal Slaying Sect was at its peak, they oppressed the nine great aristocratic families so much that they couldn’t breathe. They even retreated at a point. But subsequently, for some unknown reason, they were suddenly wiped out,” the peak master said in a deep voice.

“Suddenly wiped out?” Qin Yu was stunned. He then thought to himself,. “Could it be related to Xiao Yu?”

“I heard that they had an extremely crazy idea, and it was this idea that had caused the once prosperous sect to decline overnight.” At this time, the peak master suddenly sighed with emotion.

A crazy idea?

Qin Yu had heard that Immortal Slaying Sect was indeed an extremely crazy sect. However, he had no idea what they had done.

“Heavenly Blood Rainbow, do you know?” Qin Yu asked.

“How would I know?” Heavenly Blood Rainbow snorted coldly and said. “But what he said was right. I’ve heard of it before. Rumor has it that the Immortal Slaying Sect has been working hard for this for several generations.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and continued to ask, “Wasn’t the Immortal Slaying Sect destructed because of that masked woman?”

“She could only be one of the reasons,” Heavenly Blood Rainbow said coldly.

“Can you elaborate? What actually happened?” Qin Yu. asked.
