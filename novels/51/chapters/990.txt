Chapter 991: Chapter 991, martial saint’s Heavenly Tribulation!

Qin Yu had never expected that the Jingdu martial arts association would even find the Southern Mountain Village!

In the distance, Yu Qin’s expression was somewhat terrified.

She whispered, “You... aren’t you Qin Yu’s friends?”

“Hehe...”Zeng Ji laughed coldly. Suddenly, he waved his hand and slapped Yu Qin’s face!

Yu Qin’s delicate body was immediately sent flying!

Then, Zeng Ji’s body flew into the air.

“I’ll say it again. If I don’t see Qin Yu within three days, I’ll kill every single one of you!”

Zeng Ji’s voice contained inner strength. His loud voice shook the entire village!

Everyone went out and raised their heads to look at Zeng Ji. They seemed to be full of doubts about Zeng Ji’s appearance. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Zeng Ji’s palm shimmered with light, and then he lightly slapped down.

Boom

The ground instantly sank! The houses collapsed in an instant!

“I’m not joking with you!”Zeng Ji said coldly.

After seeing Zeng Ji’s methods, everyone’s faces couldn’t help but change drastically, and they scattered in all directions.

Zeng Ji was quite satisfied with this.

He slowly landed beside Yu Qin, then pinched her chin and said coldly, “You have a good relationship with Qin Yu. You should know where he is, right?”

Yu Qin gritted her teeth. Other than fear, there was also a hint of determination in her big eyes.

Yu Qin, who was originally weak, now had tears in her eyes.

Tears rolled down her cheeks, but she didn’t say a word.

“Haha, good, interesting!”Zeng Ji said indifferently.

“I’m not in a hurry. I’ll wait for you three days.”

“If I don’t see her in three days, I’ll slaughter the whole village!”

After saying that, Zeng Ji threw Yu Qin aside.

Qin Yu, who was hiding in the dark, couldn’t help but narrow his eyes!

“Why? is that girl very important to you?”Tie Dan asked indifferently.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “It’s not a matter of whether it’s important or not. She saved me. I Can’t watch her die.”

Tie Dan smiled faintly and said, “It’s simple. As long as you lend me your body, I’ll help you kill them.”

“But I have to tell you in advance that once I make a move, I’ll fall into a long sleep. As for when I’ll wake up, it’s hard to say.”

Qin Yu did not speak for a long time.

After a long time, Qin Yu muttered in a low voice, “There might still be time in three days.”

“Time? What do you mean?”Tie Dan asked.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said, “Since it’s so difficult to obtain the heavenly vanilla, I don’t have any hope. I Can’t stay stuck in the realm of the Martial Marquis Forever.”

“What are you doing?”Tie Dan’s voice carried a trace of shock.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I’m going to try to forcefully enter the martial saint realm. Whether I succeed or not depends on this one move.”

“Perhaps, the effect of the Dao wound is not as terrifying as I imagined.”

Tie Dan said in a deep voice, “Are you crazy? If you fail, it’s very likely that your cultivation will be completely lost and your golden core will explode!”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Do I have any other choice? Don’t tell me you’re going to find a high-grade mystic realm?”

Tie Dan instantly fell into silence.

That’s right, finding a high-grade secret realm was even more difficult than ascending to the heavens.

Moreover, people from the high-grade secret realm would not come here, let alone bring a stalk of heavenly vanilla.

Qin Yu did not say anything else. He turned around and left.

Three days was enough time for Qin Yu to try and enter the martial saint realm.

Qin Yu sped all the way and left the mountain south village quickly.

“You guys have to hold on,”Qin Yu said in his heart.

As long as he became a martial saint, Qin Yu would no longer be afraid of everyone!

It would not be too late to save them when the time came!

He ran for dozens of kilometers.

Qin Yu only stopped when he was sure that his breakthrough would not attract Zeng Ji.

Qin Yu deliberately found a canyon to prevent others from discovering him.

“This is the place.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He sat cross-legged on the ground and closed his eyes slightly.

“Qin Yu, I have to remind you that this is an extremely risky thing,”tie Dan said in a deep voice.

“If you fail, the consequences will be unimaginable.”

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I know. I have tried this kind of adventure many times. Every time, I have made the right bet. I believe that this time, I will still keep my good luck.”

Tie Dan remained silent, but a trace of admiration towards Qin Yu emerged from the bottom of his heart.

This was simply putting his life on the line.

Qin Yu did not say anything more. He closed his eyes slightly and began to try to break through to the martial saint realm.

Traces of internal Qi surged out from Qin Yu’s Dantian! They flowed throughout his body!

Following that, traces of internal Qi rushed straight to the top of his head!

Qin Yu’s divine sense transformed into a golden light and surged towards the Dantian.

At this moment, the two types of internal Qi began to try to fuse!

Traces of the power of the Great Dao spread around Qin Yu’s body!

This was the sign of stepping into the Martial Saint Realm!

The Golden Core and Qin Yu’s divine sense were rapidly fusing together. Qin Yu’s entire body began to tremble!

Because his golden core was damaged, the process of fusing the golden core and divine sense was extremely painful!

The wounds seemed to be torn apart, and the pain was all over his body!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and endured the pain.

He controlled his divine sense and tried to merge with his jindan as gently and calmly as possible!

Not only did Qin Yu suffer, even tie Dan, who was in Qin Yu’s mind, also suffered the same pain!

“F * ck...”tie Dan grimaced in pain and almost collapsed!

On the other hand, there was no expression on Qin Yu’s face.

Although cold sweat kept falling, his face was calm!

“It’s fine if you’re a F * cking lunatic, but you still want to F * cking drag me along...”tie Dan could not help but curse!

Under this kind of pain, Qin Yu was still able to control the fusion of divine sense, which could not help but make tie Dan Admire Qin Yu even more!

As the fusion continued, the pain began to intensify.

The Crack in the golden core was rapidly growing! The pain from the Dantian was unbearable!
