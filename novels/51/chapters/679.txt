Qin Yu rushed back to Chuzhou that night.

“At this time... Xiao Yu should be asleep,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

It was already midnight. Normally, Qin Yu wouldn’t disturb her.

However, Qin Yu had spent too much effort on this matter. Now that he had succeeded, Qin Yu decided to disturb her.

After getting off the plane, Qin Yu took a taxi and rushed to Xiao Yu’s house.

At this moment, the scene in Mr. Wu’s courtyard was very different from what Qin Yu had imagined.

There were three unfamiliar men standing in the courtyard. All three of them were exuding an extremely strong internal qi.

This internal qi almost enveloped the entire house.

Xiao Yu and Mr. Wu stood in front of the three of them.

“Who are you?!” Mr. Wu shouted.

The three of them didn’t say anything. They just looked at Xiao Yu coldly.

Mr. Wu shouted, “If you don’t leave now, I’ll call the police!”

Finally, the three of them spoke.

They looked at Xiao Yu quietly and said, “We’re from the Han Palace. We’re not here to hurt anyone. We’re just here to take something.”

Mr. Wu frowned and said, “Han Palace? What’s that? I’ve never heard of it. Get lost!”

The three of them ignored Mr. Wu’s shout and kept their eyes on Xiao Yu.

Xiao Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. She knew very well that the three of them must be here for the mask!

Even though Qin Yu said that no one could know about the mask, the young Xiao Yu still told her best friend the news.

“What... What do you want?” Xiao Yu asked.

“You should know,” the three people said coldly.

Xiao Yu gritted her teeth and said, “I don’t understand what you’re talking about. I don’t have what you want.”

“Little girl, we don’t want to be rough, but don’t force us,” one of the three people said coldly.

Xiao Yu gritted her teeth and suppressed the fear in her heart. Then, she took a step forward, and the aura on her body exploded at this moment!

What was surprising was that Xiao Yu had already entered the grandmaster realm!

Such speed was shocking!

Mr. Wu couldn’t help but be surprised when he felt Xiao Yu’s internal qi.

When did his daughter become so powerful?

“Little girl, are you going to fight us?” One of them asked coldly.

“You should know that you aren’t our match. As long as you hand over the thing, we won’t hurt you.”

Xiao Yu braced herself and said, “Don’t even think about it!”

The three of them narrowed their eyes, and their expressions couldn’t help but turn cold.

“If you refuse a toast, you’ll be forced to drink a forfeit,” one of them said coldly.

His internal qi also erupted at this moment!

The terrifying internal qi directly sent Mr. Wu flying!

These three people were actually in the Martial Marquis realm!

“I’m unafraid of you!” Xiao Yu shouted, and then took the initiative to clench her fists and charge over!

However, the difference in strength between the two sides was too great. Xiao Yu had no way to fight back against a Martial Marquis!

The black-robed man raised his palm and directly sent Xiao Yu flying!

Looking at Xiao Yu, who was lying on the ground, Mr. Wu immediately became anxious.

He grabbed a stick from the side and rushed over!

However, Mr. Wu, who was just an ordinary person, had no fighting strength. His stick was directly sent flying before it even touched the black-robed man!

Mr. Wu fell to the ground and fell into a coma.

“Dad!” Xiao Yu immediately became anxious.

She rushed to Mr. Wu’s side and said anxiously, “Dad, wake up!”

“Little girl, hand over the thing. I guarantee that you’ll be fine. Don’t bring trouble upon yourself,” the three people warned again.

Xiao Yu stood up from the ground. She gritted her silver teeth and said, “Don’t even think about it! I won’t hand it over to you even if I die!”

“You don’t know what’s good for you!” The three of them were completely enraged!

They took large strides forward and stretched out their palms. A palm that looked like a shriveled claw directly grabbed towards Xiao Yu!

All of Xiao Yu’s cultivation was not worth mentioning at this moment! Facing these three people, she had no way of retaliating at all!

Right at this moment, a golden fist stretched out!

The fist went straight for the palm, and a loud sound immediately rang out!

“Boom!”

With the loud sound, the black-robed man retreated three steps in succession!

“Xiao Yu, are you alright?” Qin Yu looked at Xiao Yu and asked.

Xiao Yu shook her head and said anxiously, “Qin Yu, quickly save my father. He...”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Wu will be fine,” Qin Yu comforted.

He walked to Mr. Wu and bent down.

Then, he injected a trace of spiritual energy into Mr. Wu’s body. After a while, Mr. Wu slowly woke up. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Qin Yu, what’s going on?” Mr. Wu asked anxiously when he saw Qin Yu.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Wu, it’s okay. Go back to your room first. I’ll take care of this.”

Mr. Wu nodded with some worry. He warned, “Qin Yu, be careful.”

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. Then, he stood up and looked at the three black-robed men.

“It seems that the news has been leaked,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The three men narrowed their eyes and said, “Qin Yu, we only came for the mask. We don’t want to be enemies with you.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “You came here to steal something, yet you say you don’t want to be enemies with me? Do I have to thank you guys?”

“Qin Yu, I know you have a little reputation and your strength isn’t weak, but I advise you to mind your own business. Otherwise, you will get into trouble!” The three of them said coldly.

“Then let’s give it a try,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He strode forward and the aura on his body exploded!

The three people looked at each other and immediately took a step back!

Obviously, they didn’t want to fight Qin Yu head-on!

“Let’s end this quickly. We can’t stay here for long,” one of the black-robed men said coldly.

The three people looked at each other and then nodded.

They stretched out their palms and an icy blue light appeared in their palms at the same time.

This light was incomparably cold and extremely strange. Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Buzz!”

Accompanied by a light, the three palms pressed forward!

Following that, the three icy blue lights seemed to have transformed into a rain of light as they pierced towards Qin Yu’s body with crackling sounds!

Qin Yu shouted loudly, and golden light immediately burst forth from his entire body! His tough and fierce body intended to resist this light head on!

“Pu!”

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that these light rays that were like rain actually directly passed through Qin Yu’s skin and entered his body!

“What is this thing?” Qin Yu’s brows instantly furrowed tightly.

The three of them didn’t make a sound. Instead, they stood not far away and muttered softly, as if they were silently chanting some spell.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body instantly felt a trace of abnormality!

He only felt that his meridians seemed to be blocked and were unable to flow!

The next second, Qin Yu’s body went limp, and he directly fell to the ground!
