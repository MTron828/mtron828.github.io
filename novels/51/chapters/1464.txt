Chapter 1465: Chapter 1,465, killing Mo Haoyan! 1

What? This Qin Yu actually didn’t use his full strength? Only used 50% of his strength? How was this possible? If he were to use his full strength, what kind of battle strength would he have?

Mo Haoyan was also shocked in his heart, but he quickly recovered.

“Keep bragging.”Mo Haoyan sneered.

“I see that you are already exhausted, so you want to use this method to scare me off, right?”

Qin Yu could not help but laugh out loud when he heard that, “Mo Haoyan, I admit that you have some ability, but it’s only a little.”

“Since you are bent on death, then I won’t waste any more words.”

After saying that, the internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body began to rapidly climb, and the surrounding aura field was undergoing extreme changes!

In just a short instant, Qin Yu’s strength had already become so powerful that it was suffocating!

“Fighting word formula, level five, open!”

Qin Yu shouted loudly, revealing all his trump cards!

His entire body was bathed in golden light. The afterglow of the setting sun shone on his body, making him look like a god.

The surrounding people were all shocked by Qin Yu’s internal Qi! Even the surrounding space seemed to be somewhat distorted!

“This... This is his full strength!”

“I originally thought that he was on par with Mo Haoyan. From the looks of it, it’s just a game of cat and mouse.”

Mo Haoyan’s expression changed drastically! In his heart, he quickly had the intention to retreat!

However, if he wanted to escape now, there was no time left!

Qin Yu looked coldly at Mo Haoyan and said, “You are able to deduce the Great Dao at such a young age. In time, you might be able to compete with all the talents in the world. It’s a pity that you came here to die.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took a step forward, and a terrifying internal Qi instantly exploded!

Originally, Qin Yu did not want to reveal his true strength, but he sensed that someone was rapidly approaching.

This person’s internal Qi was even stronger than Mo Haoyan’s. Without a doubt, the person who came was definitely the clan leader of the Mo clan, Mo Hong.

Therefore, Qin Yu wanted to kill Mo Haoyan before he arrived!

“Qin Yu, I’m not afraid of You!”Mo Haoyan gritted his teeth and roared. Then, he rushed toward qin yu like a moth flying toward a flame!

This time, he condensed the Great Dao into his fists, as if he wanted to fight Qin Yu to the death.

Looking at Mo Haoyan who was rushing toward him, Qin Yu didn’t show any emotion on his face. He only clenched his fists at this moment.

“Absolute beginning Sacred Fist!”

Qin Yu roared angrily and raised his hand to form the golden absolute beginning sacred fist!

“No!”

It was also at this moment that Mo Hong rushed to the scene!

He shouted at the top of his lungs and threw out a secret treasure in his hand, trying to save Mo Haoyan’s life! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Unfortunately, it was too late. Qin Yu stretched out his fist and shattered the void. It was as if he had traveled through the ages. The golden light blotted out the sky and the Sun as he swung his fist toward Mo Haoyan with a crushing force!

“Boom!”

It was as if the planet had exploded. This punch shattered all of Mo Haoyan’s spells. The ocean-like fist smashed into Mo Haoyan’s entire body.

His body was shattered in the blink of an eye. His bones were shattered into pieces, and his body was directly vaporized into a bloody mist!

The surroundings fell silent. In the void, there was nothing but Qin Yu’s figure.

Mo Haoyan didn’t even leave a corpse behind.

This was Qin Yu’s punch, the punch that made everyone break out in cold sweat!

“Haoyan! ! !”Mo Hong plopped down on the ground, his voice hoarse as he wailed in pain.

The onlookers sucked in a breath of cold air. After seeing so for Myself Qin Yu’s true strength, a sense of helplessness rose in their hearts.

Even a genius like Mo Haoyan had died so easily at the hands of Qin Yu, let alone others? Who else had the courage to compete with Qin Yu?

Qin Yu looked coldly in the direction of Mo Hong. Although his voice was Earth City, it pierced through the eardrums.

“You sent someone to kill Fang Fang, and I killed your son as a punishment. How about it?”Qin Yu looked at Mo Hong and said coldly.

Mo Hong raised his head and glared at Qin Yu. He gnashed his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, you’ve already killed one of my sons, and now you’ve killed my beloved son. How Do You Want to settle this score? !”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “That’s your son courting death. If it weren’t for his repeated provocations, how could I have killed him in the Qingyan Forest?”

“Of course, you can come and avenge your son. I’ll stand here!”

Qin Yu roared like a God descending from heaven.

That invincible Aura was invincible, making people not dare to look directly at it.

Mo Hong’s heart was filled with incomparable anger, but he did not make a move for a long time.

After a while, Mo Hong stood up from the ground.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “My mo family is unlucky. Qin Yu, the debt between us is settled.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I also hope that you can keep your word.”

Keep your word? is that possible?

Everyone knew that Mo Hong was just temporarily avoiding the sharp edge.

The death of two of his most outstanding sons was like a bolt from the blue to Mo Hong.

However, he also knew in his heart that Qin Yu was not someone he could afford to offend.

Putting aside Qin Yu’s strength, just the few people standing behind him were not people his Mo family could offend.

Mo Hong did not stay any longer. He endured his grief and left.

Qin Yu looked at Mo Hong’s back. He knew that Mo Hong would not let this matter rest.

However, with the Mo family’s strength, if they really wanted to fight to the death, it was hard to say who would win.

If the Tianyun sect took the opportunity to enter, it would be troublesome.

Mo Hong left, but the crowd around him did not disperse.

Qin Yu did not stay any longer. He turned around and walked towards the Green Rock Forest.

He erected a tombstone for Fang Fang. After everything was settled, Qin Yu rushed towards the hunter organization.

Qin Yu had yet to take revenge for the death of his team leader.

Jin Lun and Zhong Wu were both people who deserved to die.

He came all the way to the hunter organization.

The hunter organization was the same as before. However, Zhong Wu’s trusted aides had been replaced from top to bottom.

He had almost dominated the hunter organization by relying on the white bone staff.

The white bone staff was a holy weapon. Although it had not been resurrected, it was not to be underestimated.

Seeing Qin Yu walking over, the hunter in charge of issuing orders could not help but frown.

“Qin Yu? You...”this person knew Qin Yu, so he could not help but feel puzzled.

Qin Yu went straight to the point, “Where’s Jing Bai? Why isn’t he here?”

“Jing Bai hasn’t been here for a long time. He’s just an ordinary hunter now,”the other party said.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What about Guan Zhuang?”

“They’ve gone to Green Rock Forest. They’ll probably be back in eight or nine days.”

Qin Yu acknowledged. He released his divine sense and covered more than half of the hunter organization. As expected, he didn’t find any traces of Guan Zhuang and Jing Bai.

“Is Zhong Wu Here?”Qin Yu continued to ask.

“No. The team leader has gone out. Rumor has it that he has something important to do,”the other party continued.

Qin Yu frowned. “Where did he go?”

“I think he went to eternal city. Rumor has it that Mr. Eternal City invited him to a banquet.”
