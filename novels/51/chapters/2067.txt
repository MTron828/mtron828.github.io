2068 Qin Wuji

Tens of thousands of ideas were constantly attacking the faith that Qin Yu had always maintained in his heart. It was incredibly terrifying. His dao mind might be destroyed if he was not careful, and he would never recover!

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground and resisted with all his might. His body was constantly trembling, and his eyes filled with panic!

“Cut off all thoughts!” Qin Yu roared crazily in his mind. He seemed to have transformed into a sharp blade that continuously cut off the vine-like thought!

“Ah!”

Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily. His internal qi burst forth. The power of his faith was unleashed to the extreme, shattering everything in the collision!

Qin Yu’s faith in his mind was like a newly born, shining with golden light and dazzling! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At this moment, everything calmed down. Qin Yu’s trembling body also slowly stabilized.

He closed his eyes tightly as if he was sensing something.

After some time, Qin Yu stood up from the ground. His eye expression became even more determined, and he seemed to have been reborn!

“The impact of the chaotic qi is truly terrifying,” Qin Yu whispered to himself.

Even though he had overcome this obstacle, he still felt a lingering fear.

There was no time to waste. Qin Yu stood up and continued to walk into the depths.

Finally, the true appearance of the Chaos Grave was presented in front of Qin Yu.

An enormous green coffin was placed in the depths. All the internal qi seemed to have come from this coffin.

Qin Yu quickly walked forward and saw two stone statues on both sides of the coffin.

These stone statues looked simple and unadorned, but they made Qin Yu feel a trace of familiarity.

He couldn’t care less about the two stone statues. Instead, he bowed to the coffin to express his respect for Wu Ji.

Then Qin Yu mobilized the internal qi in his body and raised his hands, intending to open the coffin.

However, the coffin was incredibly heavy. Even if Qin Yu had powerful strength, he could not move the coffin at all!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, a ray of light suddenly appeared. It was unknown where it came from!

He gripped the supreme bone tightly, afraid that something unexpected would happen!

Countless rays of light entered the two stone statues. Following that, flesh and blood slowly appeared on the stone statues as if they had been reborn!

“This… This!”

Qin Yu was so shocked that he stepped back several steps and sat on the ground with a thud!

Soon, the two stone statues were completely revived. They looked incredibly old but dignified. When Qin Yu saw these two people, he was so nervous that he could not even say a word!

Without even thinking, these two stone statues must be guarding the coffin. The terrifying level of their strength was unknown!

“Guardian?”

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something!

Supreme bone!

The nine great aristocratic families had speculated that the Big Graves were built by those two attendants. Most probably the two stone statues in front of him were the two attendants!

Thinking of this, Qin Yu hurriedly took out two skeletons and placed them respectfully there.

After that, Qin Yu bent his body and dared not even breathe loudly. The internal qi on the bodies of these two elders was too terrifying!

It was no exaggeration to say that a single glance from them could crush Qin Yu!

After some time, a voice sounded leisurely.

“Looks like… someone has broken in,” an elderly man said. His voice seemed to come from afar, but it also seemed right in front of him.

“It’s also a chaotic body. It has the same physique as Lord Wu Ji…” the other elderly man said slowly.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and hurriedly explained, “Seniors, the Chaos Grave was unintentionally excavated. Now, everyone wants to obtain Lord Wu Ji’s inheritance. Everyone is working hard for this. I… I was lucky enough to have reached here…”

“Young man, raise your head,” one of the elderly men said.

Qin Yu slowly raised his head, and his eyes filled with respect.

When the two elderly men saw Qin Yu, they were slightly shocked.

“They look alike, very much alike,” an elderly man said.

“Yes, but at the same time, it seems like something is missing,” the other elderly man said.

Qin Yu looked at them at a loss and said in confusion, “May I ask the two seniors? Who are you referring to…”

“Try to make your eye expression fierce,” the elderly man ignored what Qin Yu said and continued talking.

Qin Yu was stunned.

A fierce eye expression?

Was this a joke? Who dared to be fierce facing two cultivators who had almost reached the end of their cultivation path?

Not to mention being fierce, it was good enough that he was not scared to pee!

“Phew.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath. Nonetheless, he still wanted to give it a try.

He closed his eyes slightly and imagined himself to be incredibly well-built.

After a while, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s gaze became incomparably fierce. He was like looking down on all living beings and everything!

“They look alike, very much alike…” The two elderly men said this almost at the same time.

“Seniors, what are you talking about? Why can’t I understand?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“You resemble Lord Wu Ji very much when he was young…” an elderly man said.

“Could it be that reincarnation really exists in this world? Lord Wu Ji… Did he really reincarnate…”

At this moment, the other elderly man asked, “Young man, what era is it now?”

Qin Yu scratched his head.

Qin Yu did not know. After all, he knew nothing about the era of the Holy Region.

“Seniors, I don’t know exactly what era it is because I came from the outer region. I only know that it’s the Golden Age now…” Qin Yu answered truthfully.

“Golden Age…” After hearing these words, the eyes of the two elderly men became hazy.

“Before Lord Wu Ji left, he tried to find a way to reincarnate. Could it be that he really did it…” The other elderly man’s eyes filled with tears, and his body trembled slightly. He did not have the aura of an expert at all.

Qin Yu was confused and stood there, not knowing what to do.

“Young man, what is your name?” an elderly man asked at this moment.

“Senior, my name is Qin Yu,” Qin Yu hurriedly replied.

“Qin Yu… Do you have your own Daoist name?” the other elderly man asked.

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said, “I was born like an ant. How would I have a Daoist name…”

“If we were to bestow you with a Daoist name, would you be willing?” the elderly man said.

Qin Yu was stunned. Then he hurriedly said, “It’s my honor!”

“Alright,” the two elderly men spoke at the same time. It was as if they had become one person. Their words and actions became incredibly unified.

“From today onward, your Daoist name will be… Qin Wuji!”
