2470 The Gestation Ground

Qin Yu and the others entered respectively. It was a narrow and incomparably long passageway.

The moment they stepped into this place, they were as if arriving in a primitive forest.

This place was full of mountains that seemed taller than clouds, stacking on each other.

The endless trees were like an ocean drowning the ground.

“I can sense many people in these mountains. The scent of the monster race seemed to mix among them. Let’s go and take a look.”

Qin Yu frowned. Had the human race here already surrendered and become vassals of the monster race?

Otherwise, why would the two internal qi be mixed?

The internal qi of the few of them surged to the extreme, and they entered through the cave entrance of one of the highest mountains.

A foul internal qi filled the entire space. The excrement of the human and monster races was all carried out in it.

Caught off guard, Jue Wu inhaled the stench and started retching.

Qin Yu also frowned slightly, and they slowly walked in.

Almost everyone’s body trembled to see the scene inside.

Countless prisons were in the mountain peak where the sun was unseen.

Countless human race women had their hands and feet tied while the monster race wreaked havoc on their bodies.

These human race women did not even scream. Their expressions were indifferent, and no one knew how long they had been imprisoned.

At a glance, hundreds of thousands of human race women were imprisoned in this mountain peak alone.

There were also a large number of pregnant women here, and several hundreds of them were with bulging bellies. They seemed to have been shaken by Qin Yu and the others. Suddenly, some of the human race women screamed in pain as half of their bodies were sliced open by a sharp claw.

A young dark green monster race crawled out of the womb, and in the next moment, he pounced on his mother and began to devour her voraciously.

This scene was thousands of times more terrifying than hell.

As for the young monster race who had eaten their mothers, they crawled to an enormous open space again.

Tens of thousands of skeletons were burning with green flames surrounding them.

This power of the Path of Heaven landed directly on the heads of these young monster races. In an instant, their bodies suddenly changed.

The bone spikes spread out one after another.

Within dozens of seconds, these young monster races’s heights skyrocketed from about 1.5 meters at birth to more than three meters.

As the power of the Path of Heaven continued to fall, they roared and let out earth-shattering roars.

“Whoosh!”

As the dark green skin on his back cracked open, two enormous demonic wings spread out from inside.

“So this is how the two-winged and four-winged monster race we saw were born. No wonder they were so orderly.”

Chang Mang gritted his teeth and enunciated each word.

His entire body smashed into these two-winged monster race like a massive rock, tearing them into pieces wherever he passed.

Lei Xin, Flower Granny, and Jue Wu gritted their teeth and suddenly attacked.

Qin Yu had never been so furious before. He thought of the monster race army he had encountered before. If most of them were born from human race women, then how many human race women would be imprisoned here?

These human race women were ravaged by the monster race in the dark cave. In the end, after giving birth to the monster race descendants, they were eaten as food on the spot. Just the thought of it made him shudder.

In the blink of an eye, almost all the monster races here had been killed by Chang Mang and the others.

The priests were all killed on the spot, and Chang Mang’s body was covered in green blood.

As for the dazed human race women, they finally revealed some changes in their expressions.

“Kill me, please.”

A woman stumbled toward Qin Yu and the others. There was no desire to live in her eyes.

Suddenly, she crashed into the stone wall beside her and died on the spot.

As if realizing that what they saw before their eyes was real, these human race women started to have a little shock.

Before this, they did not even have the right to commit suicide. After these priests died, they only had this thought after the restrictions on their bodies ended.

In an instant, many people who had long broken down committed suicide, while some people stood in place in a daze, not knowing where they would go next.

Qin Yu wanted to say something but stopped several times. In the end, he was unable to say something to comfort them.

At this moment, he felt that no matter how much he comforted them would be useless. Even if he stopped these people who had long broken down, they would only be like walking corpses. Perhaps leaving like this was the best choice for them. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu took out hundreds of bottles of pills from his Sumeru ring and placed them on the ground.

“Monster race, go to hell!”

Chang Mang’s voice was full of killing intent.

At the entrance of the cave, waves of demonic qi that could destroy the heavens and earth rapidly approached and surrounded them.

When they walked out of the cave, even Lei Xin Lei and Flower Granny, who had experienced real battles, could not help but gasp.

Outside, it had long been surrounded by the densely packed monster race army.

Besides the four-winged monster race that Qin Yu and the others had seen before, there were even about a thousand six-winged monster races.

These six-winged monster races were shining with a pitch-black metallic luster, and their bodies were smaller than the four-winged monster race.

“These six-winged monster races are all above the Tribulation Transcending Stage. Chang Mang, Jue Wu, and Elder Guai, you must avoid head-on attacks if they are also proficient in joint attacks like the four-winged monster race.”

Lei Xin said with a solemn expression.

The True Saint and Tribulation Transcending Stage were two completely different levels of power. When they were dealing with the four-winged monster race, their combined power was enough to resist the power of Lei Xin, not to mention the six-winged monster race before their eyes.

Qin Yu also raised his power to the limit. He had never expected the plane they had entered this time to have been conquered by the monster race.

The monster race actually gathered countless human race women here to breed their offspring.

This place must have been heavily guarded by elites. Other than these monster races, there must be monster races watching them in the dark.

“Kill them!”

Without any delay, the six-winged monster race led the four-winged monster race to start charging at them almost the moment they saw Qin Yu and the others.

Ninth Heaven Divine Thunder!

In the sky, three layers of thunderclouds condensed.

The divine lightning was nurtured within, and as Lei Xin’s hand seal moved, the endless power of lightning suddenly bombarded the monster race army.
