Chapter 1696: Chapter 1,696 was indeed at the reversion void stage Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu had already expected that he would not give up so easily, so he was not surprised. He only replied coldly, “It’s just a fair competition between us.”

“Fair competition? hahahahaha, do you have the right to compete with me on a fair basis?”The voice sounded again.

“Let me tell you, not only can you not keep Satan’s token, you can not keep your dragon blood either.”

After saying this, the voice disappeared.

Qin Yu knew that this young man was extremely dangerous, so he did not dare to stay any longer. He hurriedly got up and went backstage to exchange for the token.

Not far away, the young man coldly looked at Qin Yu’s back and then said to the old man beside him, “Follow him.”

“Yes, Young Master.”The old man bowed slightly and then quickly followed.

Backstage, Qin Yu used a small bottle of dragon blood to get the token of Satan. Then, he hurriedly walked out.

As soon as he walked out of the door, the young girl who pulled Qin Yu into the room greeted him warmly, “How is it? Young Master Qin, did you get anything?”

Qin Yu hurriedly nodded at her. Then, he directly used the line word formula and shot into the distance.

He didn’t know his goal, but he just wanted to get as far away from this place as possible.

In the blink of an eye, Qin Yu had already shot out for several hundred Li, but even so, Qin Yu didn’t dare to stop at all.

“There’s no need to escape. You can’t escape.”

At this moment, the young man’s voice exploded in Qin Yu’s mind!

This caused Qin Yu’s expression to immediately change! He stopped in his tracks and looked around nervously.

Not long after, the young man and the old man walked out.

The two of them stood in front of Qin Yu with playful smiles on their faces.

Their eyes were like a cat catching a mouse, making people extremely uncomfortable.

“Do you think you can escape?”The young man said indifferently. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s brows were tightly furrowed, and his heart was incomparably shocked!

Along the way, Qin Yu did not stop at all. With the support of the line word formula, his speed was even faster to the extreme.

But even so, they still caught up silently!

“Run, keep running,”the young man said with a sneer.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He looked at the two people in front of him vigilantly, and the internal Qi on his body was quickly adjusted to the extreme.

“Young man, don’t waste your energy. With Your Realm, you have no chance of fighting back in front of us. You’d better hand over the thing obediently,”the old man said with a smile.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Hand over the thing. Will you let me go?”

“Hehe, of course not. But we will consider leaving you a complete corpse.”The old man said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Then why are you wasting your breath with me? Do It.”

“I’ve said it. In front of us, you have no room to resist.”The old man shook his head and said.

Qin Yu sneered, “How would we know if we don’t try?”

“Sigh.”The old man sighed slightly, and then said, “Since you are so stubborn, then don’t blame me for being impolite.”

After saying that, the old man suddenly stretched out a palm and gently cut through the air.

In an instant, the DAO technique appeared, and a radiance that was like a steel knife directly approached Qin Yu’s face!

This internal Qi was incomparably terrifying, and it shattered the void, leaving behind one clear mark after another in the air!

Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t be negligent. Golden light erupted from his entire body, and his right fist was raised. He clenched his dao technique, and with a single punch, he crushed everything in his way!

Boom

An enormous radiance exploded at this moment, and swept out in all directions!

The old man’s mark actually shattered under Qin Yu’s Golden Fist!

A terrifying aftershock swept out in all directions, and Qin Yu was forced back a few steps.

On the other hand, the old man was quite relaxed, but his face was full of surprise!

“Oh? You have some ability…”the old man said in surprise.

The young man beside him also snorted coldly. “No Wonder You Dare to challenge us. So you have some ability, but unfortunately, you will still die today.”

Qin Yu’s face was somewhat cold. The internal Qi on his body continued to increase and soon reached its limit!

In the next second, the old man suddenly disappeared. His palm pierced through the air and directly grabbed at Qin Yu’s head!

Such a fast speed made it impossible for Qin Yu to dodge in time. He could only quickly turn his head to the side and Dodge this fatal attack!

The old man’s palm fiercely slapped onto Qin Yu’s shoulder, instantly emitting an explosive sound like steel clashing!

“Eh?”

The old man was instantly even more surprised. He lowered his head to look at his palm, only to feel that his palm was shaken until it was in pain!

“What’s Wrong?”The youth at the side asked.

“What a tough body,”the old man said with a frown.

He glanced at Qin Yu and said, “I’m afraid this boy’s body is not weaker than the reversion void stage. In fact, it’s even tougher than the ordinary reversion void stage.”

The young man sneered and said, “I’m afraid it’s because of the effect of the dragon’s blood.”

The old man nodded slightly and said, “Maybe.”

“Well, don’t waste time with him. Father said not to stir up trouble outside. Kill him quickly and get the thing,”the young man urged.

The old man nodded slightly, and then looked at Qin Yu coldly.

At this moment, his internal Qi had exploded to the extreme, and a terrifying sense of oppression assaulted his face!

Reversion Void Stage!

Qin Yu’s expression changed greatly! As expected, this old man was a genuine reversion void stage!

In front of a reversion void stage, Qin Yu didn’t have any power to resist!

“What, are you afraid?”The old man noticed Qin Yu’s strange behavior and sneered.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. Since things had come to this, even if he couldn’t win, he still had to give it a try.

Qin Yu’s body suddenly shook, and the fighting word formula was instantly activated!

At the same time, he flipped his palm and took out the return to void pill!

Once he saw that things weren’t going well, he immediately swallowed the return to void pill!

“Weng!”

At this moment, the old man had already formed a seal!

Tens of thousands of lights gathered in his palm like a bouquet of flowers. A terrifying pressure spread rapidly in all directions, and everything in the surroundings seemed to be shattered!

This kind of internal Qi was probably even more powerful than Zhao Jing’s!

“Brat, you can go and die now,”the old man said coldly.

After he finished speaking, he flipped his palm and pressed down in Qin Yu’s direction!

In an instant, tens of thousands of rays of light closed in on Qin Yu. That space was instantly shattered, revealing a pitch-black void!

Under this powerful pressure, Qin Yu felt as if his entire body weighed tens of thousands of Jin. He was completely unable to resist!

He gritted his teeth and raised his head to roar furiously. The golden light erupted to the extreme, and he planned to fight to the death!

But even so, Qin Yu’s strength was still insignificant! There was no way to resist!

At this critical moment, a black void suddenly appeared in front of Qin Yu!

The void was like a huge door, swallowing the thousands of rays of light!

Everything in the surroundings instantly fell silent, as if nothing had happened.
