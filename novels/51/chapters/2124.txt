2125 The Day of the Path of Heaven’s Secret

His eyes emitted the killing intent, but after a few seconds, he did not say anything sitting opposite Dean Lei.

Although this simple confrontation could not derive the result of the intense battle between the two parties, it proved Dean Lei’s unfathomable strength. Even Si Liuhe also admired him.

“Dean Lei, you should know I’m not the only one who wants the Traceless Immortal Scripture,” Si Liuhe said coldly.

“And… I must obtain the Traceless Immortal Scripture, regardless of the price I have to pay.”

Dean Lei said, looking at Si Liuhe, “Are you threatening me?”

“You can understand it this way.” Si Liuhe did not hide anything.

Dean Lei snorted coldly and said, “Qin Yu is in my Thunder Courtyard. If you guys want to do so, go ahead. I, Lei, am waiting for you guys!”

Upon hearing this, Si Liuhe stood up instantly.

He looked at Dean Lei and said coldly, “Do you want to become enemies with the world for a mere Qin Yu?”

“The world? Can your Si family represent the world?” Dean Lei sneered and said.

“Indeed, my Si family cannot represent the world, but we can bring everyone in the world together!” Si Liuhe said coldly.

“Qin Yu monopolized the Traceless Immortal Scripture, but not my Si family. Once it’s in my hands, all the great aristocratic families will share it!

“No matter how strong your Thunder Courtyard is, how many people can you resist? In such a great era, True Saints will only become more! When the time comes, Thunder Courtyard will become the target of public criticism!”

Hearing Si Liuhe’s words, Dean Lei said coldly, “Come over then. I’m here waiting for you guys!”

“Alright, I hope Dean Lei won’t regret it!” Si Liuhe shouted coldly.

After saying this, Si Liuhe stood up and left.

The onlookers in Thunder Courtyard made way for Si Liuhe. No one dared to stop him.

Qin Yu clearly heard the conversation between the two.

He frowned and felt tremendously uneasy.

Qin Yu knew very well that Si Liuhe was right. Once all the True Saints attacked together, Dean Lei definitely could not resist.

He slowly came to Dean Lei’s reception room. Looking at the rather indifferent Dean Lei in front of him, Qin Yu felt even more uncomfortable in his heart.

After hesitating for a while, he suddenly stood up and said, “Dean Lei, I plan to leave Thunder Courtyard for the time being.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but Dean Lei waved his hand and said, “Just cultivate in peace. The rest has nothing to do with you.”

“I don’t want to cause trouble to anyone. On this path of cultivation, I’ve already troubled many people,” Qin Yu sighed and said.

Dean Lei understood Qin Yu’s thoughts. He stood up and walked up to Qin Yu, saying, “Don’t worry, Thunder Courtyard isn’t that weak. Moreover, your father won’t let anything happen to you.”

Qin Yu had no choice and could only nod and say, “Alright, I understand now. Thank you, Dean Lei.”

In the following period of time, there was a brief period of peace and quiet in the Holy Region.

Everyone knew Si Liuhe had gone to Thunder Courtyard, but the outcome was still a mystery.

However, this peace did not last long because the day of the Path of Heaven was about to come.

For a while, terrifying visions appeared in the sky from time to time. These visions indicated that the day of the Path of Heaven was about to come.

Almost all the sects were waiting for this day, including Qin Yu.

Sitting in the cultivation room, his eyes slightly narrowed as he felt the increasingly vigorous dao techniques.

“The chosen one will be born on the day of the Path of Heaven. What exactly is the so-called chosen one?” Qin Yu whispered to himself. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this moment, Dean Lei walked in from outside.

He sat opposite Qin Yu and said, “One’s future cultivation will be smooth sailing upon being chosen by the Path of Heaven. At the very least, one can enter the Tribulation Stage.”

“What kind of rule is this exactly? Why is the so-called Path of Heaven becoming more and more like a living being with human emotions?” Qin Yu sighed with emotion and said.

Dean Lei glanced at Qin Yu and said, “You seem to have some thoughts.”

“I have a tremendously strong premonition, and it coincides with my previous speculation.”

“Oh?” Dean Lei was a little surprised.

Qin Yu continued, “Dean Lei, I caught a glimpse of it in Wu Ji’s immortal scripture. Wu Ji had also looked up the so-called chosen one.”

Dean Lei was silent as he waited for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu continued, “From the history that he pried into, there are a total of 18 so-called chosen ones. However, among these 18 people, only one has stepped into the Immortal Emperor Realm. Moreover, the information about that Immortal Emperor has gone missing.

“Does this mean if one is chosen by the Path of Heaven, one can only cultivate under the Path of Heaven? Stepping into the Immortal Emperor Realm was equivalent to breaking the rules of the current dao technique, thus can’t be selected?”

Qin Yu’s thoughts indeed surprised Dean Lei.

“Dean Lei, do you know who these 18 chosen ones are? Have you ever investigated?” Qin Yu asked.

Dean Lei shook his head, indicating he did not know.

“Do you have a candidate in mind?” Dean Lei asked.

Qin Yu nodded. He looked up at the sky and said in a low voice, “That person is most likely to be Teng Zixu.”

“Teng Zixu?” Dean Lei was even more surprised.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “Teng Zixu is a rare genius. His comprehension of dao techniques is tremendously fast. He doesn’t even need to go through any experience.”

“Moreover, the Teng family has always been known for its mysteriousness. Even the great aristocratic families don’t know much about it. I’m now very suspicious about how the Teng family emerged!”

After saying this, lightning flashed, thunder rumbled in the sky, and a storm raged!

Large patches of dark clouds gathered above Qin Yu’s head, and lightning was brewing faintly within them as if it was about to tear the sky apart.

Qin Yu and Dean Lei raised their heads simultaneously and looked at the sky densely covered with thunderclouds.

“Could it be this is the revelation of the heavenly secrets?” Qin Yu slowly stood up and said coldly.

The vision did not last long and disappeared very quickly. It was unknown whether it was because of the vision condensed by the day of the Path of Heaven or because Qin Yu had really revealed the heavenly secrets.

After the vision in the sky dissipated, Dean Lei frowned slightly, and a hint of contemplation flashed in his eyes. “Qin Yu, your premonition might not be completely unreasonable. No matter what, the day of the Path of Heaven is approaching. We can only wait.”

Qin Yu nodded. He knew what Dean Lei said was true. However, his guess about Teng Zixu still made him feel uneasy.

He didn’t say anything else. After bidding farewell, he returned to his cultivation room and continued cultivating.
