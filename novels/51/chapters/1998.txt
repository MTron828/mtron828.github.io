1999 Fight to the Death

The third princess was throwing a tantrum, and Elder Si couldn’t do anything.

Since she came on behalf of the Yan family, she represented the Yan family. Thus Elder Si had to be responsible for this!

Elder Si looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Qin Yu, you claimed to be pursuing the Yan family’s saintess, but now you’re attacking the Yan family. Have you considered the consequences? If you kidnap the third princess of the Yan family, do you still have hope to be with Yan Ruoxue?”

“Are you trying to brainwash me?” Qin Yu sneered and said. “Are you even qualified? If I die, I won’t have a chance. Cut the crap. I’ll only count to three. If you disagree, I’ll kill the third princess now. At most, we’ll fight to the death!”

!!

With that, Qin Yu stepped forward and placed his hand on the third princess’s head.

A ray of Golden Light appeared on Qin Yu’s palm. The third princess’s head would explode if he exerted a little force.

“Don’t!” Seeing this, Elder Si panicked.

He hurriedly stretched out his hand and said anxiously, “Let go of the third princess, and everything will be fine!”

However, Qin Yu ignored him and only said coldly, “One!”

Elder Si’s expression was tremendously ugly. He gritted his teeth and said, “Alright, I agree with you. But you must not hurt the third princess!”

“Don’t worry. When I reach a safe place, I’ll surely let her go,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Although Elder Si was reluctant, he had no choice but to bite the bullet and say, “Everyone, step aside!”

Qin Yu looked at Elder Si coldly and said, “You’ve stationed your people outside. I’m afraid we’ll have to trouble you to accompany us.”

After saying this, Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu, indicating for her to leave with the third princess.

A group of them walked toward the outside of Sky City. On the way, numerous people saw this scene.

Elder Si followed behind them gloomily. He gritted his teeth and wished he could immediately tear Qin Yu and Jue Wu into pieces!

Soon, they were outside of Sky City. Just as Qin Yu had said, people had been stationed here.

Seeing Qin Yu leave, several people immediately surrounded him.

“Elder Si, we have to rely on you now,” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Elder Si’s face darkened as he shouted coldly, “Step aside!”

Under Elder Si’s command, everyone made way for him.

Qin Yu looked at Elder Si and said coldly, “Elder Si, it’s best not to send anyone to follow us. If I find out, I promise I’ll kill the third princess gradually.”

After saying this, Qin Yu and Jue Wu hurriedly fled.

The scene was chaotic, and Elder Si’s expression was tremendously ugly.

“Elder, what should we do now?” someone walked over and asked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Elder Si gritted his teeth and said, “Follow them secretly! No matter what, don’t let them detect us!”

“Yes!”

After receiving this order, a group of people immediately secretly ran in Qin Yu’s direction.

Of course, Elder Si wouldn’t stay idle. He was the key person responsible for this matter.

Therefore, he quietly followed behind, wanting to take the opportunity to save the third princess.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu fled hundreds of stars away in one breath. Being captured by Jue Wu, the third princess was so frightened that tears flowed down her face.

“Quickly let me go. I guarantee they will spare you. Boohoo…” the third princess said shakily.

Unfortunately, the third princess only received a slap from Jue Wu.

After advancing another few hundred stars, Qin Yu suddenly stopped in his tracks.

“What’s wrong?” Jue Wu frowned.

Qin Yu looked around coldly and said, “Elder Si will definitely send people to follow us.”

Although their methods were incredibly superb that even Jue Wu couldn’t detect them, Qin Yu was certain Elder Si wouldn’t let this matter go so easily.

After saying that, Qin Yu looked around and said coldly, “Elder Si, it seems you didn’t hear clearly what I said.”

The expression of Elder Si, who was chasing after them relentlessly in the dark, instantly changed.

Had he been discovered? It shouldn’t be!

“Elder Si, since you refused to listen to me, don’t blame me for being rude,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Immediately after, Qin Yu walked up to the third princess. He reached out his hand and broke the third princess’s finger!

“Ah!”

The intense pain instantly caused the third princess to let out a miserable cry!

This cry made Elder Ji’s expression change drastically!

He hurriedly showed up and walked with an ashen face.

“Qin… Qin Yu, don’t hurt the third princess…” Elder Si was sweating profusely, and his heart was filled with panic.

If the third princess died, the Si family would definitely kill him to apologize to the Yan family!

“What? Didn’t I make myself clear enough?” Qin Yu raised his hand and gestured to break the third princess’s legs.

Elder Si was terrified. Panicking, he actually knelt on the ground!

“Don’t… Don’t! I promise! I promise I’ll leave immediately and won’t follow you anymore!” Elder Si said in horror.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly, looked at Elder Si, and said coldly, “I’ll give you one last chance. If you do it again, I won’t show mercy!”

“Alright, alright!” Elder Si dared not say anything else. He nodded his head like a chick pecking at rice crazily.

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He immediately brought the third princess along and continued fleeing.

...

Elder Si, kneeling on the ground, did not dare to move at all.

It was not after Qin Yu and others had gone far away that someone came out of the dark to help Elder Si up.

“Elder, should we continue chasing?” the Si family’s people asked.

Elder Si shook his head and said weakly, “Don’t chase anymore…”

“Do we just let them escape like this?” The cultivator of the Si Family seemed to be reluctant to accept this.

Elder Si let out a long sigh and said, “This is the only way… Let’s wait. May the heavens bless the third princess so that nothing happens to her…”

…

At the other end, Qin Yu and Jue Wu fled for three days and three nights, directly escaping from Zhongzhou.

In the end, they stopped at a barren mountain.

Qin Yu’s internal qi had dispirited due to many days of rushing.

“Let’s rest here for a few days,” he said as he scanned the surroundings.

...

“Mmm,” Jue Wu responded. She took a long golden chain from the Spatial Magic Artifact and tied up the third princess.

“Let me tell you. It’s best not to think of struggling because the harder you struggle, the tighter the rope will become. It will pierce into your skin and flesh and break your bones!” Jue Wu said fiercely.

The third princess did not dare to be arrogant this time. She nodded repeatedly and did not dare to say a word. Her eyes were full of tears.

Qin Yu glanced at the third princess and could not help but sneer. “Aren’t you quite arrogant, and you like to make others submit to you, and treat everyone as slaves? Let me tell you, this is retribution to you. I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of those who suffered in your hands.”

With that, Qin Yu walked toward the third princess step by step.
