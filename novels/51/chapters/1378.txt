Chapter 1379: Chapter 1,379. Goodbye, elder Bai

“Remember, restrain your killing intent,”iron egg reminded him again.

Qin Yu agreed and looked at elder Bai’s seat naturally and generously.

Elder Bai was now beaming with pride. His face was full of smiles, which made people feel resentful.

“Elder Bai, please come to the second floor. How many people are there today?”The waiter asked.

Elder Bai walked straight to the second floor. As he walked, he said, “Eight people. Bring me all your good wine and dishes.”

“Okay!”The waiter ran to the kitchen eagerly.

Seeing elder Bai living so comfortably, Qin Yu felt an indescribable anger in her heart.

At this moment, a middle-aged man with a big belly and well-dressed walked out.

This man was shining with jewels, covered in gold, and exuded the aura of a local tycoon.

He was none other than the owner of an Fenglou, boss Zheng.

Boss Zheng came all the way to Qin Yu and frowned. “You want to work here?”

Qin Yu quickly took out sister Lin’s letter and handed it to boss Zheng. Then she said, “Sister Lin asked me to come.”

“Sister Lin? Sister Lin from the GU city auction?”Boss Zheng took the map.

“That’s right.”Qin Yu nodded.

Hearing this, boss Zheng’s face immediately softened.

He smiled and said, “What’s your relationship with sister Lin?”

“Well... She’s one of my sisters,”Qin Yu Lied.

When boss Zheng heard that, he quickly pulled Qin Yu’s hand and said, “Then we’re a family. Are You Hungry? I’ll ask the kitchen to cook something for You?”

Qin Yu waved her hand and said, “No need, boss Zheng. I’m here to work. Please arrange a job for me.”

“No problem. What kind of job do you want to Do? Just tell me!”Boss Zheng patted his chest and said.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and then tactfully hinted, “I like freedom, and I don’t like being locked in the same place all day. I think a job like being a waiter is definitely not suitable for me.”

Boss Zheng rolled his eyes and said, “Do you like going out?”

“Yes, I’m too playful, so sister Lin introduced me to a job,”Qin Yu said calmly.

Boss Zheng pulled Qin Yu to the backyard of an Fenglou.

He pointed at the Tianyun sect and asked, “Have you been there?”

Qin Yu was immediately overjoyed.

He suppressed his excitement and pretended to be shocked. “Is that the Heavenly Palace?”

Boss zheng laughed and said, “Yes, that’s the Heavenly Palace! How about it? Do you want to go in?”

“Yes! I’ve never seen such a building before!”Qin Yu nodded repeatedly. His excitement was beyond words.

Boss Zheng patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “I’ll arrange it for you in a while! You can take a look around first.”

“Thank you, boss Zheng,”Qin Yu cupped her hands and said.

Boss Zheng gave Qin Yu a punch and winked at her, saying, “Call me boss Zheng. We don’t know each other. Call me brother Zheng!”

“... Okay, brother Zheng,”Qin Yu said with a smile. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It seemed that sister Lin was very strong. Otherwise, boss Zheng wouldn’t have such an attitude toward Qin Yu.

After he left, Qin Yu couldn’t help but think about elder Bai.

At this time, the waiter was about to serve the dishes when Qin Yu hurriedly stopped him.

“Let me do it. I’m new here. Do more work,”Qin Yu said.

The waiter looked at Qin Yu and said, “The young man is not bad. He has good eyesight. Here you go.”

Qin Yu didn’t waste time. He took the dishes and walked to the second floor.

Looking at the food in his hand, Qin Yu became angrier the more he thought about it.

“Ha... Pfft!”Qin Yu spat a mouthful of thick phlegm into the food and then stirred it with his hand.

“I’ll let you eat! I’ll let you eat!”Qin Yu cursed while stirring.

“You’re so F * cking disgusting,”iron egg couldn’t help but say.

Qin Yu snorted and said, “It’s just that I don’t have enough time. Otherwise, I’d have to add some SH * T into it.”

“Shut up, I’m going to throw up!”Iron Egg cursed.

Qin Yu carried the food all the way to the second floor and found elder Bai’s room.

After entering the door, he saw nine people in the room.

Elder Bai sat on the main seat and seemed to be bragging.

“Elder Bai, I’ll have to ask you to take care of me in the future.”Someone cupped his hands to elder Bai.

Elder Bai waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry.”

“Did you catch Qin Yu?”Someone asked.

Elder Bai shook his head and said, “This Qin Yu is extremely cunning. It Won’t be easy to find him.”

“Didn’t the Heavenly Cloud sect release the news? If he doesn’t show up, they will kill his friends? Is this Qin Yu really not going to show up?”Someone continued to ask.

Elder Bai snorted lightly and said, “We did have this intention, but unfortunately, Di zun protected us, so we haven’t made a move yet. Otherwise, we would have killed those people and exposed them to the public.”

When Qin Yu heard this, he couldn’t help but sigh in relief.

It could be seen that Di Zun’s position in the Heavenly Cloud sect was very high.

“TSK tsk, looks like the sect master values di zun very much.”Someone beside him sighed.

Elder Bai nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. Di Zun is the most talented person in the entire heavenly cloud sect since its establishment. The sect master has said that he will become one of the strongest people in this world in the future.”
