Chapter 355: Who Do You Think You Are?! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The group of people rushed to the warehouse in a mighty manner.

Such a large group attracted the attention of countless people.

In the car, Feng Chong squatted on the ground like a prisoner.

Although his calf was in extreme pain, he could only endure it. No one would treat him.

At the entrance of the warehouse, Li Wenqiang swaggered over.

“He has been locked up for a day. He should be obedient by now,” Li Wenqiang said with a smile.

Mr. Zeng said in a low voice, “Wenqiang, Mr. Feng just called and asked if we kidnapped someone.”

“Gee, who cares? He always asks.” Li Wenqiang didn’t take it seriously.

“Open the door.” Then, Li Wenqiang pointed at the door and said.

Mr. Zeng didn’t say anything and hurriedly opened the door.

“Pick a few powerful ones for me and accompany me in,” Li Wenqiang said.

He knew that Qin Yu was quite skilled, so he didn’t dare to go in rashly.

Mr. Zeng also knew this. He immediately picked three Inner Strength Grandmasters and followed Li Wenqiang into the warehouse.

The lights of the warehouse suddenly lit up.

Li Wenqiang strolled to the front of Qin Yu and the others.

“How is it? Do you know how powerful I am now?” Li Wenqiang snorted.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “You’re really a prodigal. Your uncle is really unlucky to have a nephew like you.”

“You dare to talk back?” Li Wenqiang glared and kicked at Qin Yu.

However, Li Wenqiang was only an ordinary person, while Qin Yu’s body was incomparably strong.

This kick caused Li Wenqiang’s foot to shake until it hurt.

“D*mn it, it’s like kicking a rock!” Li Wenqiang covered his foot and said in some pain.

“You two, beat him up!” Li Wenqiang pointed at the two Inner Strength Grandmasters beside him and said.

At this time, Old Mister Yan said indifferently, “Young man, if you stop now, perhaps it’s not too late. At least you can keep your life.”

“Tsk, old fart, how dare you try to intimidate me.” Li Wenqiang snorted coldly.

“Let me tell you, your son called me! I told him to come and pick you up in three days!”

“But unfortunately, your son’s attitude wasn’t very good, so I changed my mind. I’m prepared to... lock you up here until you die here!”

Old Mister Yan didn’t panic, but there was a faint smile on his face.

Li Wenqiang grinned and said, “Of course, if you want to go out, it’s not impossible.”

After saying that, Li Wenqiang looked at Yan Ruoxue with lecherous eyes.

He swallowed hard and said, “As long as you let her sleep with me for one night, I’ll let you go immediately!”

“Do you want to die?” Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned extremely cold.

Li Wenqiang snorted lightly and said, “My uncle is the king of the North Province Island! It is her fortune to be able to be with me!”

“Of course, even if you don’t agree, it’s useless.” Li Wenqiang changed the topic. He licked his lips and walked towards Yan Ruoxue step by step.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body suddenly erupted with golden light!

A terrifying power helped him break free from the iron rope!

“Bang!”

A golden light flashed, and Li Wenqiang was sent flying!

“D*mn it, how dare you hit me? Kill him!” Li Wenqiang roared crazily.

The three Inner Strength Grandmasters immediately walked forward.

Their internal qi was fluctuating, and a terrifying pressure slowly spread out.

Qin Yu’s expression was cold, and he quickly adjusted his internal qi to the maximum.

“Brat, you’re dead meat today!” One of the Inner Strength Grandmasters took the lead and walked over!

His fists erupted with a terrifying force, and it was aimed at Qin Yu’s face! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The power of a rank 3 Inner Strength Grandmaster caused the entire warehouse to buzz!

Qin Yu didn’t dodge, and his fierce fists brought with them a golden light as he faced it head-on!

“Clang!”

A loud sound rang out! As Qin Yu destroyed everything in his path, he erupted with incomparable strength!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The Inner Strength Grandmaster was pushed back a few meters, and his wrist was instantly broken!

“How is this possible!?” The Inner Strength Grandmaster’s expression changed!

Before he could regain his senses, Qin Yu walked over!

A golden light slowly expanded in his pupils! It was so bright that it almost blinded his eyes!

“Boom!”

This punch contained immense destruction power!

That Inner Strength Grandmaster didn’t even have time to react before his head was blown off by Qin Yu’s punch!

A third level Inner Strength Grandmaster was dead!

Old Mister Yan, who was sitting on the ground, couldn’t help but reveal a surprised expression.

Although he wasn’t a martial artist, he knew the difference between the strength levels!

A relieved smile appeared on Yan Ruoxue’s lips.

Unknowingly, Qin Yu seemed to have grown into a man who could take care of himself!

“You’re courting death!” The other two Inner Strength Grandmasters were instantly enraged!

Light swirled in their palms, and terrifying cultivation techniques pressed down on Qin Yu!

When they looked up, they saw that there seemed to be a huge sword hanging above Qin Yu’s head!

This sword’s aura was like a rainbow. The violent qi energy even shook the ground!

Qin Yu’s expression turned cold. He waved his hand, and a wave of qi energy protected Old Mister Yan and Yan Ruoxue!

Then, he held his other hand and activated the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist to meet the attack!

“I don’t care what move you have. I just need to smash it with one punch!” Qin Yu roared repeatedly!

The golden light illuminated the entire warehouse!

His fist ruthlessly smashed towards the huge sword!

“Kacha!”

A loud sound rang out!

The huge sword that was activated was smashed into pieces!

As for the two Inner Strength Grandmasters, they were even affected by the backlash of the qi energy and vomited blood non-stop!

Qin Yu’s body was covered in golden light as his eyes swept over them coldly.

His domineering aura made the two Inner Strength Grandmasters dare not to move for a moment.

Li Wenqiang, who was lying on the ground, was even more terrified.

He anxiously shouted at the door, “Mr. Zeng! Mr. Zeng!”

“Swoosh!”

Under Mr. Zeng’s lead, seven to eight Inner Strength Grandmasters stepped into the warehouse.

Looking at the corpses on the ground, Mr. Zeng couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

“You have quite some skill,” Mr. Zeng said with narrowed eyes.

“Do you know what the consequences will be if you kill our people?”

Qin Yu sneered. “I’ll kill you next!”

“Hahaha! How brazen!” Mr. Zeng said coldly.

Mr. Zeng was an eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster. It was indeed difficult to deal with him.

Even Qin Yu might not be his match.

“Mr. Zeng, kill them all!” Li Wenqiang shouted angrily.

Mr. Zeng glanced at Qin Yu. He slowly raised his hands and sneered. “You are only an Inner Strength Past Master. I will kill you as easily as squashing an ant!”

“An ant dares to speak so arrogantly?” At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the door.

Looking over, he saw Yan Sihai standing at the door.

Mr. Zeng frowned slightly and said coldly, “Who are you?”

Yan Sihai took off his coat. In the next second, his figure suddenly disappeared!

Mr. Zeng didn’t even have time to react before his dantian was shattered by Yan Sihai’s kick!

“My name is Yan Sihai. Have you heard of me?” Yan Sihai said coldly.
