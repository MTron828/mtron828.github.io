2455 Immortal Emperor’s Guidance

“Yes!”

Qin Yu’s eyes turned red as he shouted.

“Stand up and give Xiao Hai a toast.”

Everyone drank the wine in their bowls in one gulp, including Yan Ruoxue, who disliked drinking.

“Xiao Hai is indeed too tired. He has too many things on his mind. It was the same thing when he was in Nanzhou. If he sets aside these burdens this time, his strength will probably elevate to an unknown cultivation realm in the future, which is not a good thing for the human race but for him.”

After finishing the wine in one gulp, Wen Wanchong patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Hearing Wen Wanchong’s words, Qin Yu’s conflicted emotions finally cleared up.

What he needed to do now was to cultivate and cherish his life. It was another rebirth Xiao Hai had given to him.

“Actually, there are no geniuses or supreme experts. Those who survive until the end are due to countless individuals sacrificing their lives. Looking back, the path beneath is strewn with the blood and flesh of the most fervent, and this is the journey of cultivation.”

Immortal Emperor Yao silently listened to their conversation and suddenly sighed.

Qin Yu was silent. Immortal Emperor Yao was indeed telling the truth.

After drinking numerous pots of wine, Qin Yu could no longer hold on.

Feeling his head spinning, he simply lay on the ground and stared blankly at the starry sky.

It was one person after another.

His mother who gave him life, and his father had always been concerned about him, even after so many years.

Furthermore, a master like his father, Dean Lei, Flower Granny, his brothers and sisters from Demon-slaying Peak, Elder Guai, and Ruoxue who had been waiting for him.

And many more …

His breathing gradually became heavy, and he slowly fell asleep.

Ji Yuhong gently walked to Qin Yu’s side, her delicate finger gently striking Qin Yu’s cheek.

“This path is indeed very tough, and his father has always wanted him to live a simple life…”

Since Qin Yu left Zhongzhou, the Pavilion Master had been inquiring about him and naturally knew how tough his life was.

“You’re a good girl. Fortunately, you two can make it to the end. Qin Yu’s mother can rest in peace in the afterlife.”

The Pavilion Master muttered.

For the entire night, everyone drank without restraint and did not care about anything else.

In the end, only Ruoxue and the Pavilion Master remained sober. The others were all drunk.

“In the human race, the current two geniuses, Xiao Hai and Xiao Shen definitely have a place among the human race. Now, one has entered the ghost realm, and the other the demon race. I feel that the cosmic luck of the human race is gradually declining. Ruoxue, you and Qin Yu must work hard.”

The Pavilion Master sat beside Yan Ruoxue.

Although she had been in the Alchemist Association, she had been collecting this sensitive information. Whether a race’s aura was strong or not did not solely depend on the power of the cultivators in the past years of the Path of Heaven.

It also depended on the talent and potential of the current generation at the same time. These were the foundation of a race in the future.

“Yes! To me, I’ve overcome the biggest difficulty.”

Yan Ruoxue smiled gently and poked Qin Yu’s nose with her delicate and cold fingers.

Back on Earth, because of the power of her bloodline, she was once the source of blood for others. That was a nightmare that she would never forget.

Even after coming to the Holy Region, she was under strict supervision.

She had initially hoped to break free of this shackle with her own efforts and be together with Qin Yu.

However, she did not expect an idiot to be even more desperate than her and took her away. Therefore, what was there for her to be afraid now?

“I really don’t know what kind of luck this brat has that he can find such a good girl.”

Ji Yuhong was stunned. She seemed to see a reflection of herself in Yan Ruoxue.

That night, Qin Yu slept very soundly. In his dream, many people were smiling at him…

He only slowly sobered up when the sun was about to set the following day.

The others had already woken up. Wen Wanchong was conducting the dao lecture to the family members of Ji Yue, Xiaoru, and Little Fatty.

These people had been living in purgatory all this while. Therefore, their understanding of cultivation was still much inferior to that of the Holy Region.

At this moment, they were listening to Wen Wanchong’s dao lecture with rapt attention.

“The Holy Region has recently received news that almost all the passageways between purgatory and the monster race have opened. Without the suppression of the planes, the powerful monster race can enter purgatory without fear. As a result, the situation in purgatory has been tremendously bad recently, and the human race has suffered heavy casualties. Sooner or later, this turmoil will spread to the Holy Region. Everyone has to cultivate with all their might and try their best to improve their cultivation.”

Wen Wanchong said to everyone solemnly. His strength was at Tribulation Second Level at the moment and had condensed a statue in the sea of the Path of Heaven. Therefore, he was more than qualified to guide these people.

What surprised Qin Yu was that Wen Er had also broken through to the Tribulation Transcendence realm.

He and Wen Da were both tremendously intelligent, but he was unwilling to immerse himself in cultivation. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After Wen Da died, his personality suddenly changed.

At this moment, he was quietly sitting cross-legged on the peak of a mountain, cultivating and comprehending the power of the heavenly sea.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground. His current soul power was powerful enough.

He could forcefully summon the power of rules with his soul like the heavenly sea. but compared to cultivators whose souls had fused with the sea of the Path of Heaven

However, compared to cultivators whose souls had fused with the sea of the Path of Heaven, the price he had to pay for using the soul power was much heavier.

The difference was naturally not noticeable if comparing him to an ordinary person.

However, if he encountered someone with Lei Qingye’s cultivation, he would soon be at a disadvantage if a winner could not be determined within a short time.

Moreover, his current cultivation techniques were too messy, and he did not have a main point of cultivation. He had to find his own direction.

“Your current cultivation path is special, so it’s not good for me to give you pointers. However, if your soul power wants to use the power of the sea of the Path of Heaven, you should be able to reach the Third Level Soul Sinking.”

As if it knew what Qin Yu was thinking about, a consciousness transmitted from his sea of consciousness.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, how did you see it?”

“I discovered that all your three sword moves require a tremendous amount of soul power to activate. You need to reserve at least 70% of your soul power to activate the power of the true body to the maximum. You can use about 30% of the power of the sea of the Path of Heaven to unleash the greatest offensive power.”

Qin Yu was shocked. He quietly deduced the split of power that Immortal Emperor Yao.

“If I had activated Soul Ferry that time, I might have been able to kill King Qin Guang. You wasted half of your soul power to pry into the power of origin, and in the end, your soul also fused into the heavenly sea. If you had only drawn upon the power of the Third Level Soul Sinking and then used 70% of your strength to execute the sword move, not only would your soul power not be destroyed, but it would also draw upon even greater power.”

Immortal Emperor Yao seemed to have wanted to guide Qin Yu and analyze all the details clearly.

When releasing the moves, it was not fighting against the power of the Path of Heaven.
