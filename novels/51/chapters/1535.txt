Chapter 1536: Chapter 1,536, battling the Heavenly Cloud sect! 1

Qin Yu didn’t want to wait for even a minute for the heavenly cloud sect.

After stepping into the mighty realm, Qin Yu’s strength had increased by quite a bit. Even if it was someone like Sima Bei who dared to provoke the three madmen and three uniques, Qin Yu didn’t fear them at all, let alone the first elder, vice sect master, and the others.

“Are you in such a hurry?”Wen Da and Wen Er instantly sobered up.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “Wait for me at Mount Hua Ning. It’s best if you don’t go anywhere. I’ll come back after I’m done.”

“Okay, you be careful.”

Wen Da and Wen Er knew that they couldn’t be of much help, so they didn’t say too much nonsense.

After bidding farewell to the Wen Brothers, Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle and headed straight for the Heavenly Cloud sect.

At this moment, the Heavenly Cloud sect had already experienced several waves of great battles.

Even with the help of the northern lands, it was still difficult for Yong Ji to take down the Heavenly Cloud sect.

For a moment, they were in a stalemate. Yong Ji was fighting against the eighteen gods, and it was difficult to determine the victor. As for the people from the northern lands, they were fighting against the deputy sect master and First Elder.

In addition, the Heavenly Cloud sect had endless magic treasures, which made it impossible for them to take down the heavenly cloud sect.

After a whole few days, they couldn’t advance even half a step further.

The crowd hiding in the dark didn’t make a move either.

......

They weren’t willing to take the risk before there was an obvious outcome.

In the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s conference room, a group of people were discussing something.

“As long as we can hold on until the sect master comes out of seclusion, everything can end,”the deputy sect master said in a deep voice.

The first elder said with extreme displeasure, “We shouldn’t have let you take over this position in the first place. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have fallen to such a state.”

The vice sect master glanced at the first elder and said coldly, “If we go according to your plan, I’m afraid that our heavenly cloud sect will be stabbed in the back and scolded!”

“So What?”The first Elder’s face became colder and colder.

The vice sect master opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but he knew that this wasn’t the time to argue, so he didn’t say anything more.

“Yong Ji and the others are here again!”

At this moment, someone suddenly ran in to report.

The vice sect master immediately stood up and said coldly, “Then let’s fight. I believe that it won’t be long before the sect master comes out of seclusion.”

The group of people left the meeting room and once again faced Yong Ji and the people of the northern lands!

“Yong Ji, if you can’t take down the Heavenly Cloud Sect, why do you have to force us?”First Elder raised his head and shouted at Yong Ji.

At this moment, Yong Ji had also shed all pretenses of cordiality. He coldly looked at first elder and said, “If we can’t take down the Heavenly Cloud sect, once sect master comes out of seclusion, the person who will die will be me.”

“Yong Ji, if you leave now, I guarantee that the Heavenly Cloud sect will not find trouble with you in the future,”the vice sect master said from the side.

Yong ji sneered and said, “Stop Dreaming. You Don’t even believe such words. No matter what, you will all die today!”

“Then let’s fight. No more nonsense!”The vice sect master shouted.

They still had the same strategy. The eighteen gods who had merged would fight against Yong Ji. The vice sect master and the first elder would fight against the people of the northern lands.

This was Yong Ji’s eighth attack, but there was still no progress.

“The Heavenly Cloud sect really lives up to its reputation. Even the people of Yong Ji and the northern lands are fighting so hard.”

“That’s right. You have to know that the chief of the Heavenly Cloud sect hasn’t made a move yet. Otherwise, I’m afraid that Yong Ji will suffer a crushing defeat.”

“Should we make a move? If we protect the Heavenly Cloud sect now, we’ll definitely be favored by the Heavenly Cloud sect in the future.”

“No, there are too many variables in this battle. Unless the Tianyun sect shows signs of defeat, we must not attack.”

The sky flashed with light, and everything here was almost turned into dust. Such a great battle was hard to find since ancient times.

As one of the three uniques, Yong Ji’s strength was naturally not to be underestimated. However, the eighteen gods were equally powerful. Even Yong Ji could not find any flaws. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Damn it, if this continues, I will really have to hold on until the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect comes out of seclusion.”Yong Ji retreated as he fought, constantly looking for flaws in the eighteen gods.

He originally thought that this would be a crushing battle, but he did not expect it to be so difficult!

He looked towards the north, and his expression became even gloomier.

The strength of the people sent by the north this time was indeed not weak, but it was far from what he had imagined.

If Sima Bei had made a move, there might still have been a chance, but it was a pity that Sima Bei had not come at all!

This great battle had lasted from dawn to dusk, from dusk to day.

The entire heavenly cloud sect had suffered countless casualties, and blood flowed like a river.

Even the vice sect leader and the others had more or less injuries on their bodies.

They had relied on the heavenly cloud sect’s secret treasures to guard the Heavenly Cloud sect to the death, and the entire heavenly cloud sect could be said to be impregnable.

In the depths of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, light would shine from time to time. The power of each light was enough to injure a top-notch martial artist like Yong Ji!

This was also one of the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s mountain protection arrays. It was extremely shocking.

“Yong Ji, if you continue to fight, you won’t be able to win. Before long, the other top-notch martial artist of our Heavenly Cloud sect will rush back to the sect. At that time, it will be too late for you to leave!”The vice sect master shouted loudly.

Yong Ji’s expression became even uglier. He was already riding a tiger and had no way to retreat.

“Can’t your northern land send more people? !”Yong Ji looked at the leader of the northern land.

The leader dressed in black robes said in a low voice, “Lord Sima Bei said that he would rush to the battlefield as soon as possible.”

“You’re playing with me, right? where is he? !”Yong Ji suppressed his anger and said.

“I don’t know either. Lord Sima Bei has indeed promised to rush to the battlefield.”The leader of the Northern Region said.

He was Sima Bei’s trusted aide. His name was Huai Chang, and he was one of Sima Bei’s top generals. Although his strength was inferior to Sima Bei’s, he was still extremely powerful.

Yong Ji took a deep breath and said, “If Sima Bei doesn’t come, I’m afraid we won’t be able to take down the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

“Hold on. As long as we hold on until Lord Sima Bei arrives, the Heavenly Cloud sect will be ours,”Huai Chang said.

“By the time he arrives, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect will have come out of seclusion,”Yong Ji gnashed his teeth and said.

As he spoke, ten thousand rays of light had already approached Yong Ji.

Yong Ji didn’t have the time to react and was forced back several steps.

The eighteen gods in front of him were like an undefeatable war god. They couldn’t find any flaws at all.

“Yong Ji, you can’t take down the Heavenly Cloud Sect!”The deputy sect master said coldly.

First Elder said straightforwardly, “The Heavenly Cloud sect is not something you can get your hands on.”

The surrounding crowd sighed.

“I’m afraid it’s impossible to see the Heavenly Cloud sect destroyed.”

“That’s right. I think we can help the Heavenly Cloud sect now.”

“Sigh, maybe.”

Just as everyone was about to make a move, someone suddenly shouted, “Look, someone is coming from afar!”

Everyone looked into the distance.

Not far away, another huge godly eagle was approaching on the wind.

On the huge head of the godly eagle stood a young man.

The young man had his arms crossed in front of his chest. His face was delicate, but there was a trace of coldness and killing intent on his delicate face.
