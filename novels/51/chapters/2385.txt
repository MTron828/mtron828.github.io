2386 Going Home

The bloodline of the Yan family comprehended the spatial qi the most. He was confident that he had reached a certain level in the Way of Spatial Rules but had never come across this level.

In just a few breaths, almost all the chaotic qi in his body was depleted by the rune. Even the spiritual energy in his bones was about to be squeezed out.

After the blurry rune absorbed a vast amount of spiritual energy from Qin Yu’s holy body, it suddenly released a ray of light.

The light beam shot into the distance.

“Ruoxue, come up with me.”

Qin Yu said with difficulty. He pulled Ruoxue and stepped onto that passageway.

“You want to leave?”

Yan Guyun was furious. A giant hand pressed down, trying to extinguish the light beam.

However, the giant hand disappeared before the light beam.

No one knew where the energy of the giant hand had gone. It was as if being directly devoured by this space.

In the distance, another similar rune echoed.

It was a spatial passageway Qin Yu had created using the blurry primordial rune. His second form of the desolate divine eye had previously studied the spatial passageway when he returned to the Holy Region.

At this moment, with the help of the primordial rune, he created a great spatial path that led to freedom.

The two were pulled by a massive force, and their bodies disappeared from the spot at a speed that was difficult for the divine sense to detect.

“Sir Yun, don’t let them go!”

“Heaven-sealing Orb!”

Almost simultaneously, ten elders of the Yun family activated the Heaven-sealing Orb.

Under the control of the ten Yun family elders, countless lightning bolts fell like a waterfall.

The thunderbolts were like an iron chain that bound the entire space, making the air in this space feel like stone.

Under the loosening of the Path of Heaven’s suppression and coupled with its activation by the Yun family’s ten elders…

The path of the light beam to the outside world was suddenly locked.

Layers of space were destroyed and revived and then destroyed again.

Violent spatial qi shot out like a gale. The head of an eighth-grade True Saint elder of the Ji family was pierced by a gust of wind, destroying his soul.

“Break!”

Qin Yu let out a hoarse roar and squeezed the last chaotic qi in his body into the primordial rune.

“Everyone, activate the Heave-sealing Orb!”

The head of the Yun family shouted, knowing he had reached the most crucial point.

This was the full-force clash between the primordial rune and the celestial artifact!

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck the Heaven-sealing Orb.

The shocking lightning instantly broke the chains, and a loophole appeared.

The primordial rune broke through the barrier almost instantly.

The passage was instantly unobstructed.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue were suddenly teleported out, and it was too late for the Yun family to activate the Heaven-sealing Orb again.

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue, who were in the Heave-sealing Orb, had already disappeared.

“Lei Xin! You’re courting death!”

Ni Qian’s eyes were bloodshot as he smashed the mountain peak by the side into powder.

Everyone was very familiar with that bolt of lightning. It was Thunder Couryard’s celestial artifact. Otherwise, the Heaven-sealing Orb would not have revealed its flaws with just one strike.

“Lei Xin and Flower Granny Hua had attacked together. Moreover, they attacked using their celestial artifacts.”

Si Liuhe and Teng Zixu appeared in the crowd, and Si Liuhe said with an ugly expression.

When he had just become a True Saint back then, the first thing he did was kill Xuan Jizi, and then he looked for Lei Xin to talk about Dao.

Back then, he had lost by one move. He did not expect to lose another today.

The spatial passageway connected heaven and earth and stopped at a specific place.

The Demon-slaying Peak!

It was the first place Qin Yu went after stepping into Zhongzhou. It was also the place where he felt the warmth of home.

These people were like family members to him. It was the first time he felt the warmth of home.

Therefore, he almost directly set the coordinates of Demon-slaying Peak as the final destination of the passageway without thinking.

Looking at Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue, who had landed, everyone from Demon-slaying Peak fell into a deathly silence.

Everyone knew that Qin Yu had returned to the Holy Region and was besieged by the nine great aristocratic families.

Many people had proactively requested to help Qin Yu escape. However, Lei Xin rejected them and set up restrictions to prevent the people of Demon-slaying Peak from going to the Yan family.

He feared the brotherhood between them was so deep that they would go and save him. They did not expect Qin Yu to return to Demon-slaying Peak. It was like a dream.

After a long while, the peak master of Demon-slaying Peak finally broke the deathly silence.

The eyes of the fierce-looking man were well up with tears at this moment. He raised his hands high and clapped with all his might.

“Qin Yu, you didn’t embarrass us, the brothers and sisters of Demon-slaying Peak. I told them that if you died, I’d f*cking dig out your corpse and spank your buttock. It’s fine as long as you don’t embarrass us!”

The peak master came forward and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder forcefully, causing him to almost faint from the pain.

The surrounding people clapped with all their might. Jiu Xiao stopped them and said with a solemn expression.

“Alright, alright. Can’t you see that Qin Yu is already very tired? Let Yan Ruoxue take Qin Yu to the nuptial chamber!”

Yan Ruoxue blushed. She did not expect to meet these strange people from the Demon-slaying Peak as soon as she arrived. However, this feeling was quite warm.

It seemed that she could only feel this kind of atmosphere when she was with her grandfather.

“Alright, alright, stop fooling around. Qin Yu has already fainted.”

Lei Xin suddenly appeared in the crowd. Only then did the crowd realize that Qin Yu had already fainted.

With his injuries, it was already a miracle that he could still hold on and say a few words.

Lei Xin rubbed Qin Yu’s head and could not help but smile.

“What an amazing kid…”

“He is indeed amazing. I thought he would die, and I didn’t expect him to tear open a hole with his strength, giving the dean and Flower Granny a chance to get him out. He indeed faced the nine great aristocratic families with his strength alone.”

The peak master was also a little emotional.

It was the first time in the past few hundred years that the Holy Region activated its peak power. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although the suppression of the Path of Heaven did help, this battle achievement was indeed unprecedented.

Late at night, Flowe Granny and the peak master sat on a stone bench.

Hot water was boiling and bubbling in front of them, and the tea leaves emitted a seductive fragrance.

“The Golden Path of Heaven has descended, and it’s about to enter the golden age of the Path of Heaven. The world will no longer be suppressed by the Path of Heaven. All the powerful figures have come out of seclusion. These people are fighting for mystic realms everywhere and even killing each other for their treasures. Meanwhile, the Immortal Crane of the demon race has returned to the depths of the Azure Rock Forest and taken the four divine beasts of purgatory under his command. The various powerful demon races in the depths of the Azure Rock Forest are now united as one. Flower Granny, what do you think?”

Lei Xin sighed.
