At this point, Luo Jingyu let out a sigh of relief.

“Judging from Qin Yu’s performance, he probably didn’t discover the secret inside the ring. This can be considered a blessing in disguise,”Luo Jingyu said in a low voice.

Luo Yang, who was at the side, said worriedly, “What if he discovered it in the past two days? As far as I know, the handlebar mustache beside him seems to know something.”

Hearing this, Luo Jingyu’s expression changed slightly.

His brows were tightly furrowed, and his face was filled with intense worry.

“If it really can’t be done, why don’t we look for the people from the JINGDU martial arts association to pressure him?”Luo Yang suggested.

Luo Jingyu shook his head and said coldly, “I’ve already looked, but the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association said that Qin Yu doesn’t care about them at all.”

“Dad, then what should we do?”Luo Yang looked worried.

Luo Jingyu sighed and said in a low voice, “We can only take it one step at a time.”

...

On the other side, after Qin Yu went back, he rummaged through the cabinets and found this ring.

He played with the ring and said in a low voice, “The pavilion of Heavenly Secrets has brought so many Babe just to exchange for this ring, which means that this ring must be of higher value.”

Although that was the case, this thing was stolen after all. To Qin Yu, it seemed like it was only right to return it.

“Yo, where did you get so many Babe?”At this time, the mustached man walked in from outside.

Qin Yu told the mustached man the whole story.

When the mustached man heard that, a trace of surprise flashed across his face.

He frowned and said, “As far as I know, this Luo Jingyu is not a good guy. He can’t do such an apology thing.”

“Mm, otherwise, how could he have such a character like Luo Yang?”Qin Yu nodded slightly.

He handed the ring to the handlebar mustache and said, “Can you see any secrets in this ring?”

The handlebar mustache said, “Maybe there is a treasure hidden in it?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu tried to probe into it with his spiritual sense.

But the moment that spiritual sense fell into it, a mist rushed toward him.

The surroundings instantly became pitch-black, and he couldn’t see his direction.

Qin Yu’s spiritual sense instantly lost its use in the spatial divine artifact.

Qin Yu hurriedly withdrew his spiritual sense, and he couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“I’m afraid there really is some treasure in this ring,”Qin Yu said while stroking his chin.

“But this ring is someone else’s after all. It doesn’t seem reasonable for me to forcefully occupy it.”

The mustached man at the side sneered, “What if you return the ring and Luo Jingyu turns hostile and refuses to acknowledge you? At that time, you’ll probably die of anger.”

“That’s true.”Qin Yu felt that it made sense.

After thinking over and over again, the corners of his mouth curled up into a smile.

The next day.

Qin Yu went to the pavilion of heavenly secrets again according to the agreement.

In his hand was a brocade box.

And inside the brocade box was the ring.

As soon as Qin Yu entered the door, the members of the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets on both sides hurriedly bowed and said, “Mr. Qin, Our Pavilion Master has been waiting for you for a long time. Please follow me.”

With that said, the two of them led the way in front and stepped through the hall of the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

Behind this pitch-black house was a towering mountain.

On this tall mountain, a few words were written by someone: Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

“Truly magnificent.”Seeing this, Qin Yu sighed from the bottom of his heart.

He released his spiritual sense and was surprised to discover that the pavilion of heavenly secrets actually had many martial marquises hidden within.

Apart from this, there were also several unknown powers.

“It seems that the pavilion of heavenly secrets is not as simple as it seems on the surface.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

To be able to develop to such a scale, it must have a strong foundation, and the pavilion of Heavenly Secrets was no exception.

Under the lead of the two, Qin Yu began to climb the mountain.

The peak of the mountain seemed to have been flattened by someone. It was a large plain.

And on that plain, a huge villa was located there.

“Mr. Qin, please come in,”the two bowed and said.

Qin Yu Strode into it. The first thing he saw was a huge cabinet. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

There were many spiritual artifacts on the cabinet, and they were all top-notch!

Even the divine dragon blade in Luo Yang’s hand was placed on the wall.

“Mr. Qin, you’re finally here.”At this moment, Luo Jingyu walked out.

He warmly shook hands with Qin Yu and said, “Quick, hurry up and serve the table.”

However, Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “There’s no rush.”

He sized up the magic artifacts on the cabinet and said with a smile, “These magic artifacts are not ordinary. They should be more precious than those outside, right?”

Luo Jingyu said with a faint smile, “Good eyesight. The magic artifacts here are indeed more precious. They are a one-in-a-million Babe.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu said with some doubt, “Pavilion Master Luo, that ring is so important to you. Why did you put it in the hall outside?”

Luo Jingyu sighed slightly and said, “I had something important to do that day. Before I had time to deal with it, I put it on the iron platform. Unexpectedly, something like this happened.”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization. He glanced at the spiritual artifact on the cabinet and said, “This divine dragon blade is not bad.”

Luo Jingyu’s eyes rolled. He immediately took the divine dragon blade and stuffed it into Qin Yu’s hands.

“If Mr. Qin wants it, just take it! Just treat it as a friend!”Luo Jingyu said with a smile.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony and immediately put away the Divine Dragon Blade.

“This horsetail whisk seems to be not bad. Is It a heaven rank magic weapon?”Qin Yu’s gaze fell on another horsetail whisk.

Seeing this horsetail whisk, Luo Jingyu’s mouth twitched.

He braced himself and said, “You can take it if you like!”

“Then thank you very much, pavilion master Luo.”Qin Yu also kept the horsetail whisk.

Following that, Qin Yu picked out several heaven rank magic weapons in succession.

What was surprising was that Luo Jingyu actually agreed to all of them!

One had to know that heaven rank magic weapons were extremely precious. Even for the pavilion of heavenly secrets, there weren’t many of them.

And Qin Yu had taken four or five of them. Even the pavilion of heavenly secrets couldn’t bear it.

The most puzzling thing was that Luo Jingyu had actually agreed!

“Mr. Qin, Let’s go. Let’s hurry up and take our seats,”Luo Jingyu said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay. Today, I still have to thank pavilion master Luo for his gift.”

With that, the two of them walked upstairs.

A banquet had already been set up upstairs. Besides Luo Yang, there was also a group of beautiful women in Cheongsam standing at the side.

These women had curvaceous figures and were extremely seductive. Anyone who looked at them would be unable to resist.

“Pavilion Master Luo, what does this mean?”Qin Yu said in surprise.

Luo Jingyu laughed out loud and said, “We are all men. Men only have that little hobby. Don’t stand on ceremony!”

After saying that, Luo Jingyu clapped his hands, and the more than ten beauties in cheongsam all surrounded Qin Yu.

Their graceful bodies were tightly pressed against Qin Yu’s body, and their palms were slowly moving on Qin Yu’s chest.
