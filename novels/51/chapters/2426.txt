Chapter 2427 - 2427: Negotiations at Flower Peak

“Senior, you are right. I’m willing to hand over all the Ji family’s gains to Thunder Courtyard.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before saying softly.

Lei Xin and Flower Granny had done Qin Yu a great favor, so he did not want to make things difficult for them.

He could also take out 70% to 80% of what he had obtained. When he was plundering, only he, Jue Wu, Chang Mang, and the others were around.

The people of Thunder Courtyard would not be aware even if he kept some of the things behind.

As for Dean Lei Xin, he would not expose him.

” Not bad, kid. Thunder Courtyard’s efforts in nurturing you have not been in vain.”

Seeing Qin Yu’s attitude, Lei Huan’s expression eased slightly.

Thunder Courtyard was different from the aristocratic family. Besides the Lei and Hua families’ bloodline, there were also many outer sect disciples.

These people also made tremendous contributions to Thunder Courtyard. In the previous year of the Path of Heaven, an outer sect disciple killed hundreds of people from the ghost race while training in a mystic realm in Thunder Courtyard.

He had protected numerous disciples of Thunder Courtyard, including many close blood relatives, with his life.

“I heard that the most famous item of the Ji family is their celestial artifact, the Five Emperor Coins. The Five Emperor Coins is almost unrivaled in heavenly secret divination. It can also protect one from all kinds of evil qi. If the alien races invade in the future, I think the Five Emperor Coins can tremendously benefit Thunder Courtyard.”

Hua Zhikong said casually.

Even Lei Huan frowned slightly when he heard this.

Qin Yu, being able to take out all the spiritual stones and magical artifacts of the Ji family, had already exceeded his expectations.

After all, the extermination of the Ji family did not involve any of Thunder Courtyard’s forces.

If they were to force Qin Yu to hand over the Five Emperor Coins, the reputation of Thunder Courtyard would be impacted tremendously if this news spread, not to mention making a genius like Qin Yu leave.

Being able to exterminate a long-standing aristocratic family single-handedly had been enough to prove Qin Yu’s ability, regardless of the method he used.

“Martial Uncle, the Five Emperor Coins have been protecting the Ji family for a long time. The backlash of the Ji family’s Way of Sorcerer Tribe has infected the Five Emperor Coins. Even I don’t dare to activate this thing.”

Lei Xin explained to the three with a bitter smile.

Qin Yu nodded and manifested the Five Emperor Coins in his hand. Seeing the backlash of the Way of Sorcerer Tribe, even Lei Qingye, with a long brow, could not help but disclose his fear.

Everything in the Path of Heaven was balanced.

The stronger the power, the more backlash of the power of karma it would suffer.

Just like the chosen one, Teng Zixu, his comprehension of the Path of Heaven was as easy as a fish swimming in the water.

However, his soul mark was almost fused with the Path of Heaven. He could not reverse the Path of Heaven and had his own thoughts. He was destined not to be able to jump out of the five elements and become an Immortal Emperor.

It was the same for the Ji family’s Way of Sorcerer Tribe. They could use the power of curses to kill from afar.

They could even exterminate a royal family without a sound. Such power would definitely have a massive backlash of karma, and the Five Emperor Coins had helped them block this backlash.

Even the most formidable Supreme Elder of the Lei family dared not take it easily.

After the ruckus, Thunder Courtyard gradually returned to peace.

Late at night, Chang Mang and Jue Wu were angrily pacing back and forth in the room and accidentally knocked each other when walking too fast.

“D*mn it, I’m so angry! I’ve never felt so aggrieved in all my years.” Chang Mang was so upset he felt like vomiting blood.

“He’s truly despicable, but we can’t defeat him.”

Jue Wu gulped down the entire pot of wine. Her small face was red, and it was unsure if it was due to her anger or if she was drunk.

These two fearless fellows dared not act recklessly this time.

They were reckless but not stupid. Even if it was the 17 people behind them, any one of them was not someone they could deal with, let alone the three big shots in the lead.

“According to Dean Lei, this should be the most chaotic time in the past few

years of the Path of Heaven. The three alien races have joined forces to kill the

human race. The situation in purgatory seems to be tremendously tragic. This

chaos will spread to the Holy Region soon or later.”

However, Qin Yu was not very angry mainly because of Dean Lei and Flower

Granny.

On the other hand, this was indeed the trend in general.

“What Qin Yu said is right. If Qin Yu had displayed such talent during the normal time, he would definitely be a treasure that the various large factions would snatch. However, winter is approaching, and we don’t know how many humans will survive. At this time, it’s understandable that they would exchange resources for strength. Moreover, at the critical moment of life and death, I think many people are more willing to hand their next generations to close blood relatives instead of people with external surnames.”

Ji Yue used to run the Moon Listening Pavilion in Solitary Cloud City, so she could see these games clearly. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

At this moment, in Flower Peak.

A group of people sat quietly and discussed in a room at the mountain peak.

Upon closer inspection, there were 30 or so people and almost all of them had the Lei and Hua bloodlines.

These people were Immortal Emperor Lei’s bloodline descendants, and they were the true masterminds of Thunder Courtyard behind the scenes.

“The Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets has appeared. In the deduction, the fate of the human race has declined, while the three alien races are shining stars. Even though we gathered many powerful fighting strengths, we only managed to come to a draw in the battle for the ninth level of purgatory three years ago. Moreover, many forces of the three alien races seemed have not appeared yet then.”

Hua Qianjie said to everyone expressionlessly.

“I didn’t expect one of the four schools, four sects, and two saints, the Pavillion of Heavenly Secret, to also appear. Last time, when the Pavilion of Heaven

Secrets appeared, the human race seemed to be on the verge of extermination.

If it wasn’t for the appearance of Immortal Emperor Tianming and many Immortal Emperors leading the human race, I’m afraid the human race might have been destroyed then. However, this time, the Immortal Emperors have already died. I wonder who can bring the human race out of this predicament.” Lei Li sighed, and there was a hint of bewilderment on his face.

This person was also a Supreme Elder in the Lei family, who was second only to the three of them. The appearance of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets also indicated that the humans were truly in danger. The various phenomena earlier were not jokes, but a true calamity that would wipe out the entire race.

“We will deal with whatever comes our way. Don’t worry too much. We, the descendants of Immortal Emperor Lei are worthy of our reputation. If these alien races dare to come, we will just kill them. Moreover, opportunity lies in danger. This might be the chance for the human race to have another Immortal

Emperor who will lead the human race to prosperity.”

Lei Huan was decisive and resolute. Many felt eased after he said this.

“However, at this time, the descendants of the Lei family must do their best to increase their strength. Only then will they have a greater chance in the upcoming chaotic times. This is also the main point of this meeting. Qin Yu might have already obtained the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan’s sword and the Evil Eye that the Ji family had planted for many years. Although this evil sword is incomparably evil, it contains all kinds of supreme treasures and Saint Weapons that the Ji family obtained over the years. It has also been tempered with sinister power all year round. If this sword falls into the hands of the alien races, I’m afraid it will cause endless trouble.’

Hua Qianjie suddenly said.

“He’s here.”

Lei Xin and Flower Granny looked at each other and saw the worry in each other’s eyes.

“Martial Uncle Hua, the sword is evil. If it is used on the righteous path, it can still defy the heavens and unleash its power..”
