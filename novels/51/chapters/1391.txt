Chapter 1392: Chapter 1392, the stubborn boss Zheng

Brother Dao’s expression turned cold as he asked, “So?”

“So... let him go,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Brother Dao didn’t say a word. He just looked at Qin Yu coldly.

Sister Lin hurriedly said, “Brother Dao, I believe boss Zheng Won’t say anything.”

After saying that, sister Lin hurriedly looked at boss Zheng and said, “You definitely won’t tell the Heavenly Cloud Sect, right?”

Boss Zheng hurriedly nodded and said, “No, definitely not!”

Brother Dao coldly swept his gaze over the few people, and the light on his hand slowly dissipated.

“You guys are so soft-hearted. Your wisdom harms others and harms yourself,”said Brother Dao coldly.

Although he said so, he didn’t have the intention to attack again.

Qin Yu walked in front of boss Zheng, cupped her hands and said, “Boss Zheng, I hope you can keep your promise. No matter what, don’t Tell on me.”

Boss Zheng hurriedly nodded and said, “Of course, of course.”

“Hurry up and leave.”Qin Yu waved her hand.

Boss Zheng glanced at sister Lin. Sister Lin’s eyes were full of anxiety.

He didn’t stay any longer and turned to run away.

When he was far away, Qin Yu could not help but sigh.

Damn, he actually softened his heart!

She did not know if it was because he thought of her, but at this moment, Qin Yu could not bear to see boss Zheng die in front of her.

“Sigh, looks like I have to change places again.”Brother Dao sighed.

Sister Lin smiled bitterly and said, “I’m really sorry, Brother Dao.”

Brother Dao waved his hand and said, “It’s fine as long as you’re not afraid of death. Anyway, I have to leave. If the Heavenly Cloud sect blames me, there will be no room for me to return.”

“Alright, let’s get down to business. You want the water of life, right?”Brother Dao looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, I urgently need the water of life. I hope Brother Dao can help me.”

Brother Dao Looked Qin Yu up and down and said, “It seems like the rumors are true. There really isn’t any spiritual energy fluctuation in your body.”

“How did you kill Ling Yun with just brute force?”Brother Dao seemed to be curious.

Qin Yu said, “It might be because I was born with supernatural powers.”

Brother Dao smiled and shook his head. Then, he said seriously, “Alright, I originally planned to leave in a week. Now that such a thing has happened, I have to leave early.”

“Come to the ghost market to find me in three days,”said Brother Dao.

Qin Yu was puzzled. “Brother Dao, where are we going?”

“To get the water of life, of course. I Can’t go to that damn place by myself,”said Brother Dao with a cold snort.

Qin Yu heard this and quickly nodded. “Okay, thank you, Brother Dao!”

Brother Dao waved his hand, indicating that Qin Yu could leave.

After Qin Yu thanked him repeatedly, she left the single horse house with sister Lin.

After leaving, Qin Yu could not help but say with some worry, “Sister Lin, this matter won’t implicate you, right? If the Heavenly Cloud sect investigates...”

“Boss Zheng shouldn’t tell,”sister Lin said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “I also believe that he won’t tell. But the great elder is his relative after all. You must know that once I recover my spiritual power, the great elder will die without a doubt.”

Sister Lin rolled her eyes at Qin Yu and said, “Do you think boss Zheng believes that you can defeat the Great Elder? That’s the Tianyun sect. Not to mention him, even I don’t believe that you can shake the Tianyun sect.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment, and it seemed to make sense.

“As long as it doesn’t implicate you, I’ll be relieved,”said Qin Yu with a smile.

“If you’re really worried about me, then recover your spiritual power as soon as possible. Speaking of which, I’m looking forward to your condition after you recover your spiritual power,”said sister Lin.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I’m looking forward to it too.”

Then, the two didn’t say anything more and parted ways here.

After Qin Yu returned to the inn, he was just about to lie down to sleep when he was shocked to find that boss Zheng didn’t leave!

He sat in the room, thinking about something. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You... Why aren’t you leaving yet?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

Boss Zheng glanced at Qin Yu and said, “Let’s talk about it tomorrow morning.”

“Aren’t you afraid that we’ll go back on our words and kill you?”Qin Yu frowned and said.

At this moment, boss Zheng said with a serious face, “Yan Qin, oh no, Qin Yu, I have to tell you. I will definitely tell the great elder about this.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and a surging killing intent immediately emerged from his body.

“Boss Zheng, do you want to die?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Although boss Zheng was a little scared, he continued, “All these years, I relied on the great elder to gain a foothold in the South Province. If I don’t tell him, am I still a human?”

Qin Yu sneered, “Are you willing to sacrifice your life to be a good person? Is It Worth It?”

Boss Zheng opened his mouth and sighed, “Qin Yu, I want to tell you that I can give you a few days to tell the great elder as late as possible.”

Qin Yu raised her eyebrows and said, “Oh? How long do you plan to give me?”

Boss Zheng said in a deep voice, “After you have enough time to leave Gu City, of course, I won’t reveal too much information, and I won’t drag sister Lin into it.”

At this point, boss Zheng paused for a moment. He pointed at Qin Yu’s face and said, “But I will tell the great elder about your face change.”
