Chapter 350: Son-in-law of the Yan Family Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Ruoxue was extremely serious.

But in the eyes of others, it was somewhat funny.

“Miss Yan, are you serious?” Mr. Xia shook his head.

“What do you think?” Yan Ruoxue asked back.

Mr. Xia forced a laugh and said, “Miss Yan, if the Yan family wants to train new people, I can understand.”

“But you say that he will stand at the top of Jingdu in the future? What kind of position is the top? Old Mister Yan’s current position?”

Yan Ruoxue thought for a moment and said, “No, he will surpass my grandfather.”

“Pfft!” Mr. Xia couldn’t hold it in anymore.

“Miss Yan, in the entire Jingdu, how many people can surpass Old Mister Yan?”

After saying this, Mr. Xia sized up Qin Yu and said, “He’s already thirty, right? As a thirty-year-old man, he’s accomplished nothing. How much room does he have for growth in the future?”

Yan Ruoxue seemed to be unwilling to argue with Mr. Xia, so she tugged at Qin Yu’s arm and said with a smile, “Let’s go over there.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

Mr. Xia was ignored, but he didn’t show any displeasure.

After listening to their conversation, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel bitter inside.

Updates by

With his achievements, he had already been called the King of Chuzhou in Chuzhou.

However, after stepping into Jingdu, he was said to have accomplished nothing.

This gap was really hard to accept.

“Don’t care about what others say. They’re just short-sighted people,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I never cared. I only care about your opinion.”

At this point, Qin Yu paused and continued, “Who is Mr. Xia?”

“He is one of the higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. His status in the martial arts world is very high,” Yan Ruoxue said.

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

No wonder his strength was so extraordinary. Just the intimidation alone made Qin Yu feel an incomparably powerful pressure.

This cocktail party was just as Yan Ruoxue had said. Everyone seemed to be connecting with each other, but in fact, they were trying to create their own social circle and solidify their status in the business world.

Qin Yu scanned the crowd. There were quite a number of top-notch martial artists participating today, but they didn’t come from any martial arts family.

On the contrary, these top-notch martial artists were the private bodyguards of these businessmen.

Although their positions weren’t low, they weren’t considered high.

It was unknown how many people had come to befriend Yan Ruoxue at the cocktail party.

There were also people who turned their attention to Qin Yu. They toasted him and handed him their business cards.

Of course, there were also quite a number of people who remained on the sidelines.

After all, they all knew that Han Wei, the Young Master of the Han family, had always been interested in Yan Ruoxue.

The marriage of a large family wasn’t something that could be decided by just one person.

The banquet didn’t end until ten o’clock in the evening. When Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue returned, Old Mister Yan had already fallen asleep.

The Yan family had already arranged a room for Qin Yu. Under the lead of a servant, Qin Yu walked into his room.

Lying on the bed, Qin Yu tossed and turned, but was unable to fall asleep.

“I probably attracted a lot of trouble by attending this cocktail party,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

...

The next morning, the news of Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue attending the cocktail party made the front page headlines!

Whether it was the Martial Arts Forum, the local news, or even various financial news, it was all reported.

“Last night, the daughter of the Yan family and a mysterious man attended a cocktail party. This man claimed to be the boyfriend of the daughter of the Yan family.”

“There are reports that a mysterious man entered the Yan family late at night. Is the daughter of the Yan family taken?”

Looking at the news, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a headache.

He had guessed that it would cause a certain amount of commotion, but he didn’t expect the impact to be so great!

Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but stroke his beard and laugh when he saw the news.

“Old Master, Qin Yu’s name will soon spread throughout Jingdu,” said the butler with a bitter smile.

Old Mister Yan put his hands behind his back and slowly said, “This is my goal. There are two sides to everything. If there are benefits, there will naturally be disadvantages.”

“That being said, aren’t we disrespecting the Han family by doing this?” The butler couldn’t help but ask.

Old Mister Yan snorted lightly and said, “Why should I respect them? What, do I have to consider the Han family for everything?”

“The Han family naturally wouldn’t dare to do anything to you, but towards Qin Yu... It’s hard to say,” the butler muttered.

Old Mister Yan said indifferently, “That’s none of my business. People have to grow up in adversity.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At this point, Old Mister Yan looked at the butler and said, “Go and find out about the Han family’s attitude.”

“Yes, Old Master.” The butler bowed and slowly left.

...

When Han Wei saw this news, he was so angry that his entire body trembled.

There were many news outlets that called Qin Yu Yan Ruoxue’s boyfriend. There were even newspaper companies that called Qin Yu “the son-in-law of the Yan family”.

How could Han Wei tolerate this?!

He tore the newspaper in front of him into pieces and said through gritted teeth, “The son-in-law of the Yan family? Does he, Qin Yu, deserve it?”

“Immediately go find the people in charge of these few news outlets! Tell them to take down the news immediately!” Han Wei said angrily.

The butler next to him didn’t dare to say anything. He quickly nodded and said, “Yes, Young Master. I will do it right away...”

At this moment, Han Meng walked in from outside the door.

When he saw Han Meng, Han Wei immediately stood up and bowed. “Father, Yan Ruoxue actually brought Qin Yu to attend the banquet in public. This is simply a slap to the Han family’s face!”

Han Meng raised his hand and slapped Han Wei’s face. He said coldly, “If you had gotten rid of him earlier, would there be such a farce?!”

“Because of you, we can’t make a move now. We can’t do nothing either. You’ve completely disgraced the Han family!”

Han Wei was also filled with regret. If he had killed Qin Yu back then, he wouldn’t have brought so much trouble upon himself.

“Dad, should the Han family respond? Otherwise... wouldn’t we be ridiculed?” Han Wei said in a low voice.

Han Meng lit a cigarette. He slowly exhaled and shook his head. “No, the Yan family’s matters should naturally be handled by the Yan family.”

“I have an appointment with Yan Sihai. He’ll be here soon.”

Han Wei quickly stood up and said, “Father, I understand!”

As he spoke, the servant downstairs called.

“Master, Mr. Yan Sihai is here.”
