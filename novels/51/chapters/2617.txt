Chapter 2618: Rejection

“As a reward for your arrival here, I’ll answer some of your questions,” the old man said.

“Ever since the Saint Kingdom appeared, it continuously gave birth to various living beings. Our existence is under the control of Order, and we also aim for the various Holy Lords to have better control over this Saint Kingdom. In other words, as long as the Holy Lord exists, no matter how powerful we are, we will be reduced to ashes with a single thought.”

Qin Yu’s mind stirred, and he made some guesses.

“In other words, now that the Saint Kingdom has lost its master, is this your chance to rise?”

“Yes and no. I, Cang Zhi have lived in this world for a long time and even peeped through the Great Dao of this Saint Kingdom. Even facing a Dao Mystical Saint, as long as he doesn’t use his Holy Lord’s power, he can’t do anything to me at all. I hid 90% of my power and became the City Lord of Nine

Tune City.”

Cang Zhi spoke to himself as if telling a long story. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I originally thought that as long as the Holy Lord didn’t sense my power, I would be able to live forever in Nine Tune City. Otherwise, I would be destroyed with a single thought. I have lived here for five Path of Heaven years and even existed before Dao Xuan became a Saint. I naturally don’t want to die just like that. ”

When these words were said, Qin Yu instantly felt a chill run down his spine.

To be able to hide his power from a Saint in this world, what kind of heaven-defying power was this?

Could such a terrifying living being be born in a country?

“But I didn’t expect the Dao Mystical Saint to die. His divine flame sent outsiders into this Saint Kingdom, and one of the divine flames discovered my power. Hence, 80% of the power in this Nine Tune City suppressed me. Even the power of Dao Profound’s subconscious, including these talismans and enchantments, were all powers derived from his subconscious power.”

“Isn’t the Dao Mystical Saint already dead? Why is there still power suppressing you?” Qin Yu asked softly. This person’s appearance was too strange.

Moreover, he did not seem to be boasting.

Qin Yu’s chest was cracking from the pressure. This kind of power was even stronger than Seifer’s.

Furthermore, the reason why Nine Tune City had been able to suppress the necromancy army was not because of Seifer’s sudden appearance, but because of the existence of the City Lord.

“Even if his soul has been completely shattered, there are still traces of him in this Saint Kingdom. Only over time will these traces gradually disappear. When his soul fragment discovered my power, it consciously wanted to erase my existence. However, his subconscious can no longer deal with my power,” Cang Zhi said with a smile.

As he lifted his head, violent waves suddenly surged in this space. Then, with a casual tearing motion, two strands of spatial qi were seized into his hands. Through these two passages, he could see the scene from another place in the void.

“Dean! Flower Granny!” Qin Yu exclaimed, his attention snapping back. Fortunately, the dean and the others had not suffered a shattered divine soul and had also arrived here with him.

“Why do you have to say so much to me? Or are you implying that anyone who enters this place will be treated the same way?” Qin Yu inquired.

“Of course not. These are outsiders who came here before you,” Cang Zhi explained with a strange smile, and nearly 50 corpses appeared on the ground.

These people had met terrifying ends, their faces frozen in twisted expressions of agony as if they had undergone horrific torture.

“That’s not right. I should be one of the first to arrive at Nine Tune City. No one can have come here before me, right?” Qin Yu suddenly realized an inconsistency. Given his speed, he should have been among the early arrivals.

Moreover, entering this place required an exorbitant amount of military merits, making it implausible for so many to enter.

“What you’ve come into contact with is only the outermost Saint Kingdom. You’ve never seen anything real. This is also why I chose Nine Tune City. The time and space here are different, and Nine Tune City will always persist. Even if it’s breached, it will recover. Do you understand?” Cang Zhi explained.

Cang Zhi said with a smile.

Qin Yu was somewhat enlightened. In other words, this place was a constantly refreshing mystic realm, somewhat akin to a reset. This explanation now made sense.

“But you outsiders won’t reset. If you die, you’ll really die. This is the second time I’ve observed this Saint Kingdom without a Lord. This world is very magical. It will obey the will of the Holy Lord, but once there’s no Holy Lord, it will constantly develop its consciousness, preventing the formation of a new Holy Lord,” Cang Zhi explained.

“I have a rough idea. In that case, what is it that you have your eyes on that is worth you spending so much time talking to me?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath, able to have such a long conversation with Cang Zhi.

Qin Yu had roughly guessed something. There was a high chance that the Heart of Saint Kingdom on his body could be of some help to Cang Zhi.

“I want you to mobilize the power of this Saint Kingdom. Every Heart of Saint Kingdom can mobilize a portion of the power, and then remove the suppression here. As compensation, I will deal with the necromancy army in this war, allowing you to continue venturing into this Saint Kingdom alive,” Cang Zhi said with a smile.

“I’m sorry, but I refuse.” Qin Yu shook his head and directly rejected Cang Zhi’s suggestion.

Cang Zhi’s face turned cold all of a sudden. He did not seem to have expected Qin Yu to reject him so straightforwardly.

“As an old monster who has lived for so long, I’m afraid that the one who doesn’t want us outsiders the most is you. Every outsider has the possibility of becoming a Holy Lord, especially those who possess the Heart of a Saint Kingdom,” Qin Yu said and shook his head.

Although he would not use the Heart of Saint Kingdom to draw in energy, once Cang Zhi’s seal was broken, dealing with this old monster would be no easy task.

“Speak of your other choice. Since I can come here, I must have an option for you to make a move. The order of this Saint Kingdom still exists.” Qin Yu deduced from their earlier conversation.

However, Canz Zhi’s dutv was still to protect this citv. Therefore, there would be an option to make a move. However, Qin Yu did not know what kind of price he would have to pay to make him take action.

“Hehe, since you’re courting death, then I’ll do as you wish. The number of people holding onto the Heart of Saint Kingdom will only increase. I’ll just wait for the next outsider.”

Cang Zhi laughed softly. The long years had already made it difficult for him to have any spiritual fluctuations.

He casually pulled, and Qin Yu entered another space just like that.

This was no longer the scene in the chaotic space basin but a huge trial ground in the depths..
