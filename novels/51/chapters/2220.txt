2221 Clueless and Ignorant

It gave Qin Yu an intensely familiar feeling. It was his other self that appeared during his tribulation.

He thought it was a dream back then, but now he was doubting it.

“If I have the chance, I must go to Satan to take a look. Otherwise, it will be difficult to know what the Soul Torment Mind Technique will bring ultimately. If I continue at this speed, the black divine sense will occupy the entire divine sense figurine sooner or later. Will he still be himself by then?”

Qin Yu’s thoughts flashed like lightning as many flashed through his mind.

“There’s nothing I can do for now. I can only try not to use the Soul Torment Mind Technique and see if I can slow down the spread of the black divine sense.”

On the second day, outside the Solitary Cloud City.

“Do I get to join your team after taking an arrow of yours?”

A young man with a steady internal qi and tanned complexion asked.

“Yes, anyone who takes an arrow will immediately sign a divine sense contract. No one will have to worry about deceiving one another.”

Xing Mou said with a smile.

“Alright, come on!”

The young man roared, and the spiritual energy in his body surged out to protect his body.

“Whoosh!”

Xing Mou did not waste time. He took the bow and pulled the bowstring.

“He’s using the air as an arrow!”

Someone exclaimed.

A ray of white light instantly pierced through the young man’s body. The young man spat blood and fell to the ground, fate unknown.

“He’s too far off. If we were to go to level eight again, this trash would only be a burden.”

Wu Feng shook his head.

“Oh yes, the physical cultivation of the kid yesterday was pretty good. I wonder if he’ll come today.”

Xing Mou suddenly said.

“If he can take an arrow, we can use him. But I don’t know if he has the guts to do it.”

Wu Feng chuckled.

Within a short while, three people had already fallen under the arrow of Xing Mou.

However, people still kept coming forward for the challenge.

“D*mn it! If I can join the Edgeless Team, I won’t have to worry about cultivation resources in the future. They often go to the seventh level of purgatory to hunt for Demonic Beast.”

“Then you have to survive this arrow.”

The surrounding people discussed animatedly. Most of them were rogue cultivators who were observing.

In this galaxy, the spiritual energy was pathetically thin.

Humans could only steal the demon cores of Demonic Beasts and refine them into spiritual energy.

Some cultivators even cultivated their entire lives and only reached the Mighty Realm.

Most of those who survived were cunning and crafty, ancient monsters that had lived for thousands of years.

Of course, there were also a small number of top-notch geniuses. However, due to the lack of the way and various restrictions, they would also be limited to a specific cultivation realm.

“Let me try.”

Another person appeared before Xing Mou. He was holding a bell and wearing a fabric hat.

After a series of chanting, a giant stone statue of a Demonic Beast appeared behind him.

“This person has already comprehended a trace of the power of rules. This is inviting god to possess him.”

Someone exclaimed. This ordinary-looking Daoist actually had such a technique.

“This person is not bad.”

Xing Mou nodded.

An arrow shot out, and the Daoist managed to barely catch it.

“Can I join now?”

The Daoist had an unconcealable joy on his face.

“Sure, sign the contract.”

Wu Feng nodded with a meaningful smile on his face.

“What?! This contract only restricts my actions, but it doesn’t restrict the three of you at all. If you want me to die, will I breach the contract if I don’t go?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Daoist angrily said.

“If you want benefits, you have to take risks. When Xing Mou joined the team, he also signed this contract.”

Wu Feng said coldly.

“Then I won’t join!”

The Daoist was exasperated.

“Do you think this is a market where you can come and go as you please? Sign the contract or die!”

Xing Mou’s eyes turned cold. He drew an arrow from his back and aimed it at the Daoist.

The Daoist’s face was ashen. Once that terrifying arrow energy was released, it would be useless no matter who he invited.

“Alright, don’t attack! I’ll sign!”

“Haha, what a domineering d*mned fellow!”

Qin Yu laughed coldly.

“Are you courting death? The trash from the Holy Region!

A cold light flashed in Xing Mou’s eyes.

He loosened his grip, and the black arrow shot out.

Like a bolt of black lightning, a crisp sonic boom echoed throughout the space.

The arrow stabbed Qin Yu’s body, and the terrifying power shook the earth and mountains. The heaven and earth shook as if there was an earthquake.

Just this?

Qin Yu patted his chest. At this moment, his Saintly Body Technique was circulating without reservation.

He didn’t even bother to block this arrow.

Xing Mou gasped, unable to hide the shock on his face.

“Not bad, Kid. Then you can join our team instead of this piece of trash.”

Wu Feng stepped forward.

“With your physical strength, it’s enough for you to do some hard labor in front. Sign this contract.”

“D*mn it, you’re lucky. I would have killed you if it weren’t for the boss’s orders. We often go to the seventh level of purgatory to hunt Demonic Beast. Our boss has even killed a fifth-grade True Saint Demonic Beast. Allowing you to join us is a good deal for you.”

Xing Mou sneered and said coldly. When the time came for them to break through the eighth level of purgatory, they would let this kid attract attention and thus have a chance to obtain that supreme treasure.

“I also have a suggestion. You guys sign this contract, and the three of you become my lapdogs. I’ll consider giving you 10% of the treasures I obtain.”

Qin Yu laughed in anger.

“Kill him.”

Wu Feng’s expression darkened. He did not expect Qin Yu to be so ungrateful.

“Don’t worry. I’ll spare your life.”

Qin Yu said with a cold smile. His divine sense had recovered 80%. Although it was not at its peak, it was more than enough to deal with these few people.

This time, Xing Mou did not hold back and pulled the bowstring to its limit.

The sound of a dragon’s roar resonated from the strings, causing the cultivators with low cultivation to feel agitated, with their blood surging and spiritual energy becoming turbulent.

“Xing Mou’s bowstring seems to be made from the tendons of a demonic dragon. This kid is going to encounter a stroke of bad luck.”

A cultivator smiled and said as if he was watching a good show.

“Whoosh!”

“Divine Dragon Strike!” Xing Mou softly said a few words, looking at Qin Yu as if he was looking at a dead person.

The black arrow instantly transformed into a black demonic dragon that crashed into Qin Yu’s body. At the same time, a massive dragon’s roar struck Qin Yu’s divine sense.

“Insect pretending to be a Divine Dragon.”

Qin Yu laughed coldly.

The cosmic form!

The gigantic palm grabbed the arrow, and the ear-piercing dragon’s roar stopped abruptly.

“Outrageous! You still dare to resist!”

Xing Mou’s eyes filled with killing intent. He grabbed backward, and three black arrows appeared in his hand.

At this moment, a commotion occurred in the depths of purgatory. It seemed like a giant wave was spreading out.

Following that, a pure qi of herbs wafted out from within.

“That ginseng is going to demonize.”

A cultivator shouted.

“It’s actually ahead of time. Did someone stimulate it?”

In an instant, the surroundings became noisy and chaotic.

The people who were watching the battle suddenly disappeared. All kinds of warships and flying treasures flew toward the sixth level.

“Brat, I’ll spare your life first.”

Wu Feng said coldly.

The three boarded a ship and left swiftly.
