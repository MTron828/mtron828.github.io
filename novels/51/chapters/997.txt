Chapter 998: Chapter 998, cats and dogs

They stared at Qin Yu, wanting to make a move, but none of them seemed to want to be the first.

“HM?”

At this moment, Qin Yu noticed a rather strange herb placed on a stall not far away.

Qin Yu walked quickly towards that stall.

When the surrounding people saw this, they hurriedly hid to the side.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to the crowd. He picked up the herb and carefully sized it up.

“Boss, how much is this herb?”Qin Yu asked.

The boss’s throat rolled as he subconsciously looked around.

Then, he braced himself and said, “No... If I don’t sell it to you, I won’t sell it to you!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Why? Don’t tell me I won’t Give You Money?”

“Who cares about your stinky money!”The stall owner mustered up his courage and cursed.

Qin Yu caressed the medicinal herb, then nodded and said, “Alright, forget it if you don’t want it.”

After saying that, Qin Yu directly put the medicinal herb into his bag, turned around and was about to leave.

“Qin Yu! Are you going to snatch it in broad daylight! ?”The surrounding people shouted loudly.

Qin Yu stopped in his footsteps and said, “Didn’t he say it himself that he doesn’t want my stinky money?”

“Qin Yu! Don’t be so arrogant! We will never let you do whatever you want!”Someone stepped forward and shouted loudly.

Qin Yu looked around coldly.

These people surrounded him in the center, afraid that he would run away.

Qin Yu put away the herbs and said coldly, “If you want to make a move, just do it. There’s no need to find any excuses.”

“Qin Yu! You Did Something Wrong First!”

“Now that you failed to transcend the tribulation, you have been punished by the heavens! Don’t you want to repent? !”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer, “I indeed failed to transcend the tribulation and my golden core was damaged. There’s no need to test me. If you want to make a move, just do it!”

After receiving Qin Yu’s definite answer, someone finally couldn’t hold it in anymore!

A martial marquis shouted and walked out from the crowd.

He pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, for the sake of you fighting against the Sky Blood Rainbow back then, I’ll let you die a quick death today!”

After saying that, he clenched his fist and rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and immediately waved his large hand, slamming a palm onto his chest!

“Whoosh!”

With just this palm, the Martial Marquis who rushed forward was directly sent flying!

He fell to the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“You... You!”Before he could finish his words, he fell to the ground and fainted.

When the surrounding people saw this, their faces changed and they took a few steps back!

“You... Are you faking it? !”Someone exclaimed.

Qin Yu said coldly, “My jindan is indeed damaged. Just my body alone is not something that any tom, Dick, or Harry can provoke.”

Tom, Dick, or Harry?

Martial Marquis was called Tom, Dick, or Harry?

Was Qin Yu’s body already so strong?

“Is there anyone else who wants to make a move? I’ll just stand here and wait,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The surrounding people looked at each other in dismay. For a moment, no one dared to make a move.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and turned to leave.

“I’ve long heard that Brother Qin is invincible under the heavens. Today, we finally have the chance to meet.”

At this moment, a young man walked out.

The young man was dressed luxuriously, and his bearing was extraordinary. He seemed to be some young master.

“It’s young master Ning!”

“Young Master Ning, kill him!”

“This Qin Yu has done so many evil things. We absolutely can not let him walk out of Ning Yang Alive!”

Hearing these people’s words, Qin Yu could not help but feel like laughing.

Back then, when the Sky Blood Rainbow attacked on a large scale, they did not even dare to fart.

Now that their golden core was damaged and they were framed, they were really capable.

Bullying the weak and fearing the strong, they showed it vividly.

Young Master Ning cupped his hands to Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “Brother Qin, I’m really sorry. I don’t want to be your enemy, but it’s really hard to go against the will of the people.”

Qin Yu glanced at him and sneered, “Do I know you? Which Hole did you come out from?”

Being humiliated in front of him, Young Master Ning’s face also became a bit ugly.

He suppressed the anger in his heart and said with a faint smile, “Brother Qin is famous in the world. Naturally, you won’t know a small character like me.”

“Of course, I, Ning, am also somewhat famous in Ning Yang. Not long ago, I just stepped into the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm and was only one step away from becoming a half-step martial saint.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “There’s no need to talk so much nonsense. Let’s do it.”

Young Master Ning pretended to be a kind person and sighed, “Brother Qin, I remember that you were also a famous figure in the past. I really don’t want to attack you.”

“How about this, you kneel down and kowtow to everyone and admit your mistake, then I’ll let you go. This way, I can at least explain to everyone, right? I believe that everyone will give me this face.”

After saying that, young master Ning looked at everyone.

Everyone around shouted, “Young Master Ning is really kind! Good, we will give young master Ning this face!”

“Young Master Ning is kind to such a villain. I really admire you!”

These words could not help but make Qin Yu feel nauseous.

The viciousness in hypocrisy was often the most disgusting.

“Brother Qin, what do you think?”Young Master Ning asked.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “I killed you in the space of three breaths.”

Young Master Ning sighed and said, “Since brother Qin is so stubborn, then I can only take action and ask for advice.”

With that, young master ning bent his fingers and rushed toward Qin Yu!

This person was full of benevolence, justice, and morality, but his methods were extremely vicious!

His hands were aimed directly at Qin Yu’s Dantian!

Qin Yu could not help but sneer. He clenched his fist and with a bang, his fist smashed onto Young Master Ning’s body!

“Whoosh!”

After taking this punch, Young Master Ning was directly sent flying, smashing countless stalls!

The surroundings were silent.

Everyone looked at each other, momentarily unable to make sense of the situation.

“Young Master Ning... Young Master Ning is really kind. He actually showed Mercy!”

“Yes, yes. Young Master Ning showed mercy. You despicable person actually killed him!”

“Shameless! Young Master Ning, kill him!”

Young Master Ning stood up from the ground in a sorry state. His eyes narrowed slightly. He suppressed his anger and said, “Brother Qin killed him. Then, I can only show my true ability.”

“You F * cking talk too much!”

Qin Yu’s feet shook, and he arrived in front of young master Ning with a Whoosh!

Such a fast speed was like a gust of wind! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Young Master Ning’s pupils shrank. Before he could even react, Qin Yu’s fist had directly penetrated his dantian!
