Chapter 1509: Chapter 1,509, the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s dilemma

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, the expressions of these black-robed men could not help but change slightly.

Just as Qin Yu had said, they did not want to make things too difficult with the heavenly cloud sect, so they relied on this method to force the Heavenly Cloud sect to cooperate.

Now that they had been exposed by Qin Yu, their faces naturally could not hang on.

“Kid, don’t talk nonsense!”The black-robed man shouted loudly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Whether it’s nonsense or not, you all know very well in your hearts. I’ll only tell you one thing. This method of yours will definitely not work.”

If they really succeeded, then how would Qin Yu go to the Heavenly Cloud sect to take revenge?

The northern lands wanted to borrow someone’s knife to kill, but Qin Yu was the same. He wanted to use the northern lands’hand to deal with the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Let’s go.”The black-robed men saw that the situation was not good and turned around to leave.

However, Qin Yu naturally would not let them go. He stepped on the line word formula and instantly blocked their path.

The black-robed men’s expressions could not help but change. They said coldly, “Kid, don’t be too ruthless!”

Qin Yu looked at them coldly and said, “You killed so many people. Do you think you can still leave?”

“You!”The black-robed man was instantly furious, but he couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu could also see that these people were just small fries from the northern lands. Otherwise, they would have long used the spatial formation to leave this place.

......

“Just a few small fries, and even the city Lord of Gu City isn’t your match...”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh when he saw this.

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s body emitted an extremely terrifying internal Qi.

Seeing that Qin Yu was about to make a move, these people didn’t waste any more words. They immediately erupted with black energy and charged towards Qin Yu!

Unfortunately, their strength wasn’t even worth mentioning in front of Qin Yu. Their golden fists crushed everything in their path, and no one could resist them. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

In just a short ten minutes, these black-robed men’s bodies were all shattered, and they fell to the ground without getting up!

Such powerful combat strength was naturally shocking.

Even the city lord of Gu City could not help but be dumbstruck.

“As expected of... the person who made the heavenly cloud sect suffer...”the city lord of Gu City thought to himself.

The remaining black-robed man stood there trembling.

He glared angrily at Qin Yu and shouted, “Qin Yu, your actions are undoubtedly offending our Northern Lands!”

Qin Yu sneered, “So what? Do you think I’m afraid of You?”

After saying that, Qin Yu stretched out a large hand and grabbed him.

The immense power made him unable to move. All of his Qi energy seemed to have been sealed and could not be used.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “I’ll give you a chance to live. I’ll ask you a few questions. As long as you answer truthfully, I’ll spare your life.”

“Don’t even think about it! I’ll never betray the Northern Lands!”The black-robed man shouted.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and muttered to himself, “That’s true. You’re just a small fry. I’m afraid you don’t know any useful information.”

When the black-robed man heard this, his pupils immediately shrank.

He wanted to say something, but Qin Yu did not give him a chance. He directly raised his hand and smashed his head.

After dealing with these black-robed men, Qin Yu looked at the city Lord of Gu City.

“Quickly activate the formation. Doesn’t Gu City have a very powerful mountain protection formation?”Qin Yu said.

The city Lord of Gu City came back to his senses and quickly nodded. “Okay, okay. I’ll do it right away.”

Qin Yu grunted and turned to leave.

At this moment, the city Lord of Gu City suddenly pulled Qin Yu back.

He said somewhat embarrassedly, “Qin Yu, thank... Thank you.”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Take care of sister Lin for me.”

After saying this, Qin Yu left.

He wasn’t in a hurry to find the dark energy grave. Instead, he temporarily returned to Mount Hua Ning.

Following that, he asked Jue Wu’s two attendants to send out invitations to Qu Zhu, Zhuo Jing, and the others, inviting them to come to Mount Hua Ning for a chat.

Besides them, Qin Yu also invited all the major sects and sects to discuss big plans with them.

With so many people invited, it naturally couldn’t be done in one go. Qin Yu could only wait for them at Mount Hua Ning.

“These people are very arrogant. Do you think they will come?”Wen Da held a piece of foie gras in his hand and asked as he ate.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “If someone doesn’t come, someone will. In short, as many as possible.”

Wen Er patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Little brother, you overestimate your appeal.”

This was the truth. Although the current Qin Yu could be considered famous in the South Province, his appeal was very weak.

Many sects did not take Qin Yu seriously at all, let alone accept his invitation.

In the next few days.

The news came from all over again. Many black-robed men had appeared in the South Province.

Their methods were exactly the same as in Gu City. Countless people had died in their hands.

For a time, many cultivators were terrified. They lived in fear all day long.

...

Heavenly Cloud sect.

The vice sect master sat in the position of the former sect master. His face became colder and colder.

Many elders had already taken their seats. All the famous people of the Heavenly Cloud sect had arrived. Only the first elder was missing.

“Vice sect leader, the northern lands have been making a lot of moves recently. They’re obviously taking revenge on us,”someone said.

“That’s right. We’ve sent people to the northern lands. The northern lands will naturally retaliate.”

“If this continues, who knows how many people in the South Province will be affected.”

The vice sect leader naturally understood. This made his expression even uglier.

If they didn’t send people to the northern lands, then the northern lands would definitely become more and more rampant. Sooner or later, they would also reach this stage.

However, if they sent people to the northern lands, everyone would probably blame it on the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“I suggest that we withdraw our people and negotiate peacefully with the northern lands,”someone suggested.

“No!”The deputy sect leader directly rejected this request without even thinking.

“We absolutely can not allow the northern lands to continue to be arrogant.”

At this moment, elder Bai suddenly opened his mouth and said, “If those lowlifes die, so be it. However, our people have all gone to the border. What if the northern lands suddenly attack the Heavenly Cloud Sect? What should we do then?”

“That’s right. If the Heavenly Cloud Sect Falls, wouldn’t that be even more troublesome?”

“I still suggest that we withdraw our people and let Xiao Hai Jue Wu and the others stay at the border.”

This suggestion seemed to have received the approval of most people.

However, the deputy sect leader slammed the table and stood up. He angrily berated, “I said, no! Resisting the northern land is the responsibility of the Heavenly Cloud sect. As for the various large cities in the southern region, I will send people to reinforce them.”

“Hahaha! Didn’t you just get hit by the Northern Lands’boxing gloves? Get everyone out. Are we going to wait for death here?”Elder Bai snorted lightly.

“Vice sect master, you are only temporarily replacing the sect master. You are not the sect master yet.”

As he said this, the first elder suddenly walked out shakily.

Seeing the first elder, everyone immediately became confident.

They all looked at the first elder, waiting for the first elder to speak.
