Chapter 181: Yan Ruoxue’s Text Message Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

After hearing Qiu Feng’s words, everyone at the venue was indeed much quieter.

The crowd that was still filled with excitement just now all took a step back.

This was enough to show the Jiang family’s status in the provincial capital.

Even though there were so many wealthy people, none of them was willing to go against the Jiang family.

Qiu Feng looked at Qin Yu proudly and sneered. “Qin Yu, what other tricks do you have up your sleeve?”

Qin Yu frowned. He really couldn’t think of any ideas.

He glanced at the crowd, but no one was willing to meet Qin Yu’s eyes.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and frowned. “Do I have to give up like this, or... kill people to take the goods?”

Qin Yu never thought that he would be a person who killed people and took their goods.

“Well, the time is almost up.” Qiu Feng looked at his watch.

Then he said proudly, “The thing belongs to me!”

After saying that, Qiu Feng strode towards the stone statue.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He clench his fists, as if he was unwilling to accept it.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

Updates by

He picked up the phone and saw a text message appear on the screen.

“Dear User, your last name is XXXX Card XX and your bank income is 500,000,000.00 yuan. Your balance is 500,001,234.10 yuan. The other party’s name is Yan XX.”

Qin Yu’s pupils dilated when he saw this text message!

This... This is the money that Yan Ruoxue transferred over?

Before Qin Yu could think about it, another unfamiliar text message came over:

The Jiang family will become your second test. Do your best, I’ll be waiting for you in Jingdu.

Excitement flashed across Qin Yu’s face. He had even forgotten about the stone statue.

Qin Yu hurriedly called back, but he found that the other party’s phone was already switched off.

This made Qin Yu’s heart skip a beat at this moment!

“Ruoxue...” Qin Yu held the phone and muttered softly.

Yan Ruoxue must have been secretly observing him!

This instantly filled Qin Yu with a sense of vigor!

Then, Qin Yu quickly walked to the front of the stone statue stall owner.

At this time, Qiu Feng’s hand had already reached for the stone statue.

Just when Qiu Feng was about to touch the stone statue, Qin Yu reached out and grabbed Qiu Feng’s wrist.

Qiu Feng frowned at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Qin Yu, what do you want to do?”

Qin Yu ignored Qiu Feng and handed the bank card to the stall owner.

“Here’s 250 million. I want it,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qiu Feng sneered. “Don’t listen to his nonsense. He doesn’t have any money in his card!”

The stall owner was also a bit suspicious.

He had just witnessed everything with his own eyes. Qin Yu obviously didn’t earn a single cent.

“You’ll know if it’s there or not after you swipe it,” Qin Yu reminded.

The stall owner nodded. He took the bank card suspiciously and tried to enter the amount.

“It’s really in the account!” Not long after, the stall owner shouted excitedly!

Qin Yu took back the bank card and said indifferently, “According to the agreement, this stone statue belongs to me.”

“Of course! Of course!” The vendor nodded repeatedly.

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony. He immediately put the stone statue into his pocket.

Qiu Feng’s expression was extremely cold. He gritted his teeth and glared at Qin Yu as a terrifying murderous aura surged towards him!

Qin Yu frowned.

From the strength of this internal qi, Qiu Feng was at least an Inner Strength Past Master!

“You’ve ruined my plans time and time again. Brat, I’m going to kill you!” Qiu Feng’s internal qi was getting stronger and stronger, as if he was going to make a move at any moment!

Qin Yu looked at Qiu Feng coldly and said, “You finally can’t take it anymore. Go ahead and try!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s internal qi suddenly soared!

The collision of the two internal qi immediately caused a breeze!

The crowd was impacted by the shockwaves from the collision of internal qi, and they retreated a couple of steps.

“Buzz”

At this moment, an extremely peaceful internal qi suddenly spread out!

This peaceful internal qi carried immense majesty, and it actually dissolved Qin Yu and Qiu Feng’s internal qi!

“No one is allowed to make a move in the venue.” A voice came from all directions!

This made Qin Yu turn pale with terror!

“He actually suppressed my internal qi!” Qin Yu’s eyes scanned his surroundings!

What kind of person was the owner of this venue?!

His strength probably far exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

“Qin Yu, I’ll spare your life for now.” Qiu Feng’s eyes were ice-cold as he said.

With that, Qiu Feng turned around and left.

“Mr. Qiu!” Wei Jiang hurriedly shouted.

However, Qiu Feng didn’t even turn around and strode out of the venue.

“What... What’s going on?” Wei Jiang, who didn’t know what was going on, felt troubled.

Both of them were his friends, so how could Wei Jiang not feel conflicted?

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He glanced at Wei Jiang and said seriously, “Mr. Wei, are you sure Qiu Feng is your old friend?”

Wei Jiang nodded hard and said, “That’s right. I’ve known him for almost twenty years. He has a gentle personality and a mild temper. He’s never acted like he did today!”

“That means he’s not Qiu Feng.” Qin Yu had already guessed it. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What do you mean?” Wei Jiang asked in puzzlement.

Qin Yu didn’t explain, but said, “I’ll send you back.”

The few of them strode out of the venue.

The moment they came out of the venue, the suppressive power on Qin Yu’s body vanished into thin air.

Qin Yu turned his head to look at the venue. He said in a low voice, “Formation Master?”

To be able to easily suppress a martial artist’s inner strength and spiritual power, there was only one possibility.

That was that some kind of huge formation had been set up here!

“How surprising.” Qin Yu sighed.

As he experienced more and more things, Qin Yu’s understanding of the world was also quietly changing.

Many things that he had never come into contact with before began to appear in front of him bit by bit.

If he hadn’t set foot on the path of cultivation, Qin Yu would probably never have known that there were so many amazing people in the world.

“Let’s go. I’ll send you back.” Qin Yu looked at Wei Jiang and Wei Ming.

Although the two of them felt a little baffled, they still nodded in agreement when they saw Qin Yu’s serious look.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, a woman suddenly ran out of the venue.

This woman was wearing sunglasses in the middle of the night, and her mouth was tightly wrapped by a scarf.

“Doctor Qin, may I ask if the three times you mentioned before still count?” The woman said in a low voice.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “As long as you pay, it will always count.”

The woman glanced around. After making sure that no one was around, she handed Qin Yu a cell phone number.

“Doctor Qin, please give me a call tomorrow. We can talk in detail then.”

After saying this, the woman ran away quickly.

Qin Yu held the cell phone number and forced a smile. “This woman is really cautious. Is the Jiang family really that scary?”
