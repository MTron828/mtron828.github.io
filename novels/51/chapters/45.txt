Hearing Shen Yun’s words, Zhao Gang hurriedly nodded.

Zhao Gang, wanting to cooperate with Lei Hu and obtain the rights to represent the Soul Nourishment Pill, had gone to look for Lei Hu before this.

But he didn’t expect that not only did Lei Hu not agree, but he even got someone to throw him out.

So, in a fit of anger, Zhao Gang, wanting Shen Yun to punish Lei Hu, told Shen Yun this matter.

“Yes, why does Lei Hu deserve to have the Soul Nourishment Pill?!” Zhao Gang nodded repeatedly.

Shen Yun snorted lightly and said, “Looks like I have to find time to talk to Lei Hu.”

When Zhao Gang heard this, he got an idea, and then he said slyly, “President Shen, Lei Hu values the Soul Nourishment Pill more than his own life. I feel that it would be difficult for him to hand it over to you.”

Shen Yun glanced at him and sneered as he said, “He only has two options. Either hand over the Soul Nourishment Pill or die. Which one do you think he will choose?”

Zhao Gang was immediately overjoyed. An expression of having succeeded in his evil scheme appeared on his face.

“President Shen, on account of me telling you the news, can you give me a proxy when the time comes?” Zhao Gang rubbed his hands and said with an embarrassed smile.

“As long as you are obedient, that won’t be a problem,” Shen Yun said nonchalantly.

Although the Shen family was prominent, their foundation was still in the provincial capital.

Now that they had come to Jiangcheng, they indeed needed a few henchmen.

Zhao Gang was the right candidate.

“Thank you, President Shen!” Zhao Gang was overjoyed and thanked him repeatedly.

After Zhao Gang left, Shen Yun made a phone call and was ready to find Lei Hu.

On the other hand, Qin Yu was sitting in the courtyard of the villa while basking in the sun.

He was waiting for the Soul Nourishment Pill to take the entire Jiangcheng by storm.

“Things will change in Jiangcheng very soon.” Qin Yu’s lips curled into a smile.

...

With the help of Qin Yu, Du Hengsheng obtained the Yan family’s project.

These few days, Du Hengsheng spent almost all his time eating with his superiors.

Today was no exception.

At the dinner party, everyone was drunk.

At this moment, the mayor of Jiangcheng suddenly said, “I don’t know if you’ve heard, but recently, a medicine called the Soul Nourishment Pill has been released in Jiangcheng. Everyone is scrambling to buy it.”

Du Hengsheng smiled and said, “Mayor Li, I’ve also heard a little about it. By the way, what exactly is this Soul Nourishment Pill?”

Mayor Li immediately said, “This Soul Nourishment Pill is really miraculous. One pill can strengthen one’s health. If taken for a long period of time, it can prolong one’s life!”

“That’s right. Now, almost everyone affluent in Jiangcheng has one pill,” the others echoed.

“Sigh, it’s a pity that this kind of medicine is too rare. It’s gone now.”

“Lei Hu used this Soul Nourishment Pill to transform himself. He went from a lowlife to a high-class businessman. God knows how many companies are begging him for the rights to act as an agent.”

Du Hengsheng was also interested.

Even the mayor of Jiangcheng was bragging about this Soul Nourishment Pill. It seemed that it wasn’t groundless. Who knew how much wealth it would create in the future?

If he could get a share of the profits, he might be able to make a windfall.

Thinking of this, Du Hengsheng asked tentatively, “Who has a Soul Nourishment Pill? I’m willing to pay a high price to buy one!”

Hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but roll their eyes. “Mr. Du, do you think you can buy it just because you have money? There’s no telling how many people can’t buy it even for a million!”

“Exactly, if there really is one, who will give it to you?”

Hearing this, Du Hengsheng was even more surprised.

The Soul Nourishment Pill was actually that popular?

At this moment, Mayor Li suddenly said mysteriously, “To tell you the truth, I still have one, but I have to keep it for my own use.”

“Mayor Li, I’ll give you two million to sell it to me!” Someone next to him joked.

Mayor Li rolled his eyes. “Even if you offer five million, I won’t sell it!”

At this point, he changed the topic and smiled. “But... I can let you smell it.”

After saying that, Mayor Li took out the Soul Nourishment Pill and said with a slightly ostentatious tone, “I’ll let you see it, but I’m telling you, you can only smell it! If anyone dares to eat it, I won’t let him off the hook!”

“Mayor Li, don’t worry,” everyone said one after another.

Du Hengsheng also hurriedly stood up and looked at the Soul Nourishment Pill.

But when he saw the appearance of the Soul Nourishment Pill clearly, his expression suddenly changed!

“Mayor Li, please let me take a look!” Du Hengsheng said somewhat anxiously.

Before Mayor Li could agree, Du Hengsheng snatched the Soul Nourishment Pill. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

When he saw the pill in his hand, Du Hengsheng’s expression became more and more unsightly.

Wasn’t this the same pill that Qin Yu had taken out a few days ago? At that time, Qin Yu had even said that he would be the agent, but unfortunately, he had rejected it!
