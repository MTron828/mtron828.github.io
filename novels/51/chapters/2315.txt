2316 Farewell

In addition to this close to 100 years, Jue Wu probably did not have much time left…

Jue Wu, who was eating meat, did not seem to think about this problem at all. Her mouth was full as she said ambiguously.

“Hurry up, Qin Yu, pour some wine for me. This retreat starved me. I won’t go into retreat next time!”

After eating and drinking to her heart’s content, Jue Wu had already drunk too much and was starting to get drunk.

Xiao Yu sat beside the bonfire and looked at it in a daze. Her eyes were red as she looked at Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu, can we still return to Earth? I miss Dad and Ruoxue. I felt like having a very long dream.”

“Surely we can. I’ll definitely bring you back.”

Qin Yu stroked Xiao Yu’s hair and said softly.

“Hey, Old Qin, let me show you something.”

The man with the mustache perched wretchedly on Qin Yu’s neck. The breath he exhaled when he spoke gave Qin Yu countless goosebumps.

“Just f*cking talk and stay away from me.”

Qin Yu felt a chill run down his spine.

“This matter is of great importance. Of course, we have to speak softly. I’ve resolved the method of using this coffin, but it’s not fully resolved yet.”

“Don’t beat around the bush. Just let it out if you have something to say.” Qin Yu frowned.

“This coffin is actually a magical artifact. The method to activate it is through the most ancient technique, offering.”

The man with the mustache stuck a talisman on each of the four sides of the coffin.

“This is a talisman. I can’t refine this coffin, so I can only use talismans to provide spiritual energy.”

He chanted an ancient incantation, and in an instant, a corner of the coffin slowly opened.

The man with the mustache grabbed seven or eight demonic beasts Qin Yu had raised from the side and placed them on one of the altar patterns.

And those demonic beasts seemed to have suddenly lost their life force and were pulled into the coffin by a force.

In an instant, a surge of primordial power transformed into a qi energy and suddenly burst forth.

With a bang, the space of the Sumeru ring trembled violently. After the coffin made this attack, it seemed to have exhausted its spiritual energy and slowly fell to the ground.

“If you offer something of the fourth or fifth-grade True Saint or something of a higher level, the attack from this coffin will be even more terrifying.”

The man with the mustache was also shocked.

The ring had become incomparably sturdy after absorbing a vast amount of Sumeru qi. He could barely shake the space even if he attacked with all his might. He did not expect a casual attack from the coffin would have such power.

Qin Yu was secretly shocked. Moreover, the power of rules emitted by the coffin seemed similar to the power of the initial Path of Heaven that he had comprehended previously.

“If that’s the case, I’ll observe it a few more times. Perhaps I can take the opportunity to comprehend the initial rules of the primordial world.”

Qin Yu had almost comprehended the masked woman’s initial rules in the Netherworld Mystic Realm but was interrupted by Situ Haoyue at the last step.

He did not expect the coffin in the netherworld he obtained to contain the power of Path of Heaven! Could it be that this coffin was an Emperor Weapon?

Qin Yu had read in the artifact records his father had left for him that the artifacts refined by the powerful master refiner had their own artifact souls. The magical artifacts would be engraved with formations and had their own rules, like the internal organs of a person,

Qin Yu’s Suo Lin Divine Artifact, for example, contained the ultimate rules of fire.

“Qin Yu, didn’t I ask for a drop of your blood essence previously? Logically speaking, it could be used to refine this magical artifact. However, this magical artifact directly repelled it when I used your blood essence to refine it.”

The man with the mustache said solemnly.

“What does that mean?”

The man with the mustache said it mysteriously, and Qin Yu could not understand what he was trying to say for a moment.

“That means the masked woman is still alive! That was why this magical artifact could not be refined!”

The man with the mustache said with a gloomy expression.

“What?!”

Qin Yu could not help but feel a bit horrified as well. He took the coffin, so would she come looking for him?

The masked woman had fought against eleven people at that time and had easily severely injured everyone.

“I can roughly guess what the masked woman is doing. In her previous eight lifetimes, the masked woman had already comprehended eight perfected Great Daos. She was just short of the current Consummate Inner Strength Grandmaster Great Dao to achieve the Nine Paths Convergence and step into the Tribulation Transcending Stage. At that time, under the golden age, at the very least, she would be another Wu Ji.”

The man with the mustache seemed to have analyzed something and said in shock.

“But why didn’t the masked woman use Xiao Yu’s body to continue comprehending the Path of Heaven? Why did she have to do this?”

Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

The man with the mustache stroked his beard.

“Qin Yu.”

The man with the mustache stared at him with a solemn expression.

“What?”

Qin Yu was baffled.

“Recently, I’ve deduced a great burial about to emerge, so I must part with you. I’ve gained a lot from this trip to purgatory and obtained a lot of new information. Goodbye, and I think we’ll meet again soon.”

The man with the mustache man laughed heartily.

“Alright, I’ll see you again.”

Qin Yu did not act pretentious and sent the man with the mustache out of the Sumeru ring.

He guessed the man with the mustache was returning to the Holy Region, but he had clearly refused to bring him back. Qin Yu could understand.

Qin Yu was lying on the lawn when a face suddenly came close to his, frightening him.

“F*ck, can you make some noise when you walk? You scared me to death.”

Jue Wu stared at Qin Yu in a daze and slowly got closer and closer. Suddenly, her throat gulped.

“Are you going to vomit?”

Qin Yu quickly ran away.

“Qin Yu, I feel something is summoning me.”

Jue Wu pulled Qin Yu in a daze and walked toward a specific place.

They came to an open space where Qin Yu stored his things. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

With a thought, he removed the enchanting Illusion formation. Jue Wu staggered and came to the front of the demonic egg.

A deep part of the crack of the demonic egg emitted a pale green light.

Jue Wu looked especially weird in front of the light.

“It seems that this demonic egg is summoning me?”

Jue Wu said in a daze.

“Could it be that this demonic egg is about to hatch?”

Qin Yu’s divine sense went deep into the demonic egg. In that instant…

He felt an extreme sense of danger, and his soul trembled uncontrollably.

This feeling was similar to an ordinary person facing a wild beast.
