Chapter 1227: Chapter 1,227, ignoring poison? 

“Even Jian Huang lost. Do We... Do We Still Have Hope?”The fifth contestant’s face was as dark as water.

“The most important thing is... Jian Huang shattered its body, and its blood contains poison. This undoubtedly increases our difficulty.”The sixth contestant took a deep breath.

The person in charge frowned and said, “Alright, it’s your turn for the fifth contestant.”

The fifth contestant was about to speak when deer emperor suddenly stood up from the high platform and said indifferently, “All of you are here for the reward, but you have also seen the purple jade origin snake’s ability.”

“I’m in a good mood today, so I’ll give all of you a chance. The remaining contestants, if you want to withdraw now, it’s still not too late.”

As soon as these words were said, the fifth contestant immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Without even thinking, he shouted, “I’m withdrawing!”

“I’m withdrawing too!”The sixth contestant hurriedly followed.

Deer Emperor magnanimously waved his hand and said, “Alright, you can leave now.”

Without turning their heads, the two turned around and jumped off the platform.

“I’m withdrawing too.”The eighth contestant, who was ranked behind Qin Yu, also turned around and left after confirming that what Deer Emperor said was true.

Deer emperor smiled and said, “Okay, if you want to quit, quit.”

Seeing that only Qin Yu was left on the stage, Deer Emperor’s eyes fell on Qin Yu.

He seemed to be waiting for Qin Yu to speak, but to his surprise, Qin Yu didn’t say a word.

“What? You Don’t want to quit?”Deer Emperor said in surprise.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I don’t want to quit. I’m here to kill the purple jade primordial snake.”

Deer Emperor was stunned. Then, he laughed and said, “Young man, think carefully. Even Jian Huang has lost.”

Qin Yu laughed and said, “Even if he loses, it doesn’t mean that I will lose.”

“Hahahaha!”Deer Emperor could not help but laugh out loud.

The audience could not help but discamong themselves.

“Who is this kid? He really doesn’t know what’s good for him.”

“Yeah, even Jian Huang lost, and he still doesn’t want to withdraw?”

“A snake swallowing an elephant when its heart is not enough.”

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to the discons of the crowd.

Deer Emperor returned to his seat and sat down. He said indifferently, “Well, since there are still contestants who haven’t withdrawn, let’s continue.”

“It’s your turn,”the person in charge said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He jumped down from the participant stands and arrived in front of purple jade essence snake.

Looking at the extremely calm Qin Yu, the audience was once again in an uproar.

“Could it be that this kid has some special method to subdue purple jade essence snake? Otherwise, how could he be so calm?”

“Yeah, there might be a big battle coming up!”

“I’d like to see this kid’s methods.”

For a moment, everyone was filled with anticipation.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the purple jade origin snake and said, “I don’t want to kill you. I only want your three fangs. What do you think?”

The purple jade origin snake’s eyes revealed an eerie coldness.

Regardless of whether it understood or not, it would not agree to Qin Yreq.

“Sigh, since that’s the case, I can only endure the pain and kill you,”Qin Yid in a low voice.

Then, Qin Yu beckoned at the Purple Jade origin snake and said, “Come, I’ll let you make the first move.”

The purple jade origin snake’s black pupils suddenly constricted, and its snake tail suddenly shot toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yew that this purple jade garden snake’s entire body was covered in poison, so he didn’t dare to take it head-on. Instead, he leaped deep and jumped to the side.

The tyrannical physical body naturally brought Qin Yu extremely fast speed.

Just by relying on the speed of his body, Qin Yu had already surpassed the Purple Jade origin snake!

This made the purple jade origin snake quite surprised. It did not seem to believe it. It waved its snake tail again and lashed at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu dodged again and kept jumping in the air.

In the blink of an eye, the purple jade origin snake had lashed out dozens of times, but it could not touch Qin Yu.

“What a fast speed,”Lu Huang on the stage said with slight surprise.

The audience didn’t buy it. They cd, “F * ck, what’s the point of you hiding all the time!”

“Exactly! I thought it would be a big battle, but you jumped up and down like a monkey! !”

“Hurry up and get off the stage! Don’t waste our time!”

Qin Yu was also a little annoyed.

This purple jade origin snake was covered in poison. He didn’t dare to touch it.

As a result, Qin Yu was unable to make a move.

“Looks like I still have to use a weapon,”Qin Yu muttered softly.

He thought of Gu Xinghe’s iron rod.

That iron rod was indestructible and was the hardest object qin Yu had ever seen.

Compared to that iron rod, the purple jade origin snake’s physical body was nothing.

Just as Qin Yu was about to pull out the iron rod, the Purple Jade origin snake suddenly opened its big mouth. The venom brought with it a fishy smell as it shot towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu did not even think before he dodged again.

However, what Qin Yu did not expect was that the venom actually exploded in the air, turning into mist and directly pouncing onto Qin Ybody!

“Hahahaha!”

Upon seeing this scene, Lu Huang who was on the stage stood up excitedly.

“Although you are fast, you did not expect my purple jade origin snake to have such a move!”Lu Huang could not stop laughing.

“This kid has already been poisoned by the Purple Jade origin snake. It’s over,”said someone below the stage.

“Yeah, as long as he touches the skin of the purple jade origin snake, he will definitely die, let alone the venom.”

“Sigh, this battle is really boring.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He lowered his head to look at his own body. Sure enough, his body was already covered in the venom of the Purple Jade origin snake.

Everyone was staring at Qin Yu, waiting for him to fester.

Even Qin Yu looked at his body with some worry, not knowing what to do for a moment.

But time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, several minutes had passed.

The scene of his body festering did not appear in his imagination. The venom had evaporated completely under the sun, but Qin Ybody was still intact.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
