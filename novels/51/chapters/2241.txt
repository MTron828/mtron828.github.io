2242 The Gale Resistance Boot

However, he did not expect Qin Yu to recognize this supreme treasure. At this moment, the dwarf only felt his hands and feet go cold, and all his hopes shattered.

Qin Yu put on the Gale Resistance Boot and stepped forward as if stepping on the wind.

He walked forward as if he was riding the wind.

That speed was even close to when he used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique. Qin Yu gasped.

At this moment, he was like a golden-winged roc. The dwarf was indeed a master refiner. He had completely retained the characteristics of a golden-winged roc. Moreover, the materials fused with the boots and the formation carved after the refinement were all perfectly compatible with the Gale Resistance Boot.

Outside of Solitary Cloud City, the spiritual energy in Qin Yu’s body surged into his boots, and he instantly turned into a flying sword.

The terrifying speed uprooted the towering trees when he passed by.

The line word formula!

With a thought, Qin Yu stepped on the line word formula, and his body let out a sharp whistle.

His entire body turned into a golden light, and he was already 10,000 meters away n the blink of an eye.

As his body arrived, the tremendous sonic boom only reached a few seconds later.

Qin Yu wanted to experiment again, but the tremendous sonic boom had already attracted the attention of many people.

He hesitated for a moment and decided to go back first.

Soon, Qin Yu returned to the central square.

The dwarf squatted in front of the stall, looking like he was about to die.

“Master, don’t be so dispirited. What’s a Gale Resistance Boot? In the future, you’ll definitely refine a treasure even more powerful than these boots.”

Qin Yu quickly cheered the dwarf up. He still had to refine treasure for him, so he could not have this mentality.

“Alright then.”

The dwarf said weakly.

“Master, you’re a demon race, right? I’ll give you some good stuff,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

The Sumeru energy wrapped around the bone cultivation water and was poured into a container of the dwarf.

“Bone cultivation water! Give me more!”

The dwarf stood up abruptly and regained some of his spirit.

Qin Yu had used one-third of it previously and one-third to help Elder Guai recover. Now, there was only one portion left.

After hesitating for a moment, he gave half of the remaining.

“No more. I almost lost my life for this bone cultivation water, Master.”

Qin Yu looked miserable.

“Wow, you’re not simple, Kid. Ordinary people can’t bring out this bone cultivation water. Once you use it, you’ll be hunted down by all the demonic beasts. The bone cultivation water contains a massive amount of demonic qi. If it was used to forge divine weapons, it might have unexpected effects.”

The dwarf said with some amazement,

“That’s right. Master, you should adjust your condition. When you have refined this locust tree wood, I will go to the seventh level again. I will bring you more bone cultivation water when the time comes.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said.

“Alright, I need to prepare some materials first before we can start.”

The dwarf finally had some motivation.

“Qin Yu, are you still in Solitary Cloud City?”

Suddenly, Ji Yue’s voice was heard from the voice transmission talisman.

“What’s the matter?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu, wearing the Gale Resistance Boot, was extremely fast and soon appeared in the Moon Listening Pavilion.

“Let me tell you a piece of good news. We’ve found Wang Feng’s location. Your friend’s luck isn’t bad. He was not taken to the sect.”

Ji Yue said with a smile.

“Where is he?”

Qin Yu was ecstatic.

“This one is 50 spiritual essence.”

Ji Yue said calmly.

“Why don’t you go and rob?”

Qin Yu’s eyeballs almost fell out.

“You must know the risk of this intelligence. This is the Blood Sect, one of the four great sects. Our losses will be disastrous if the Blood Sect discovers the information was leaked by our Moon Listening Pavilion.”

Ji Yue said seriously.

“And let me remind you, his condition is very bad.”

“Deal.”

Qin Yu did not talk nonsense and directly took out 50 spiritual essences.

“In the seventh level of purgatory. The exact location is here.”

Ji Yue immediately transmitted the location to Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“Qin Yu, you have to vow that if you are caught, you are not allowed to expose my Moon Listening Pavilion.”

“Alright.”

Qin Yu did not waste any words.

“Qin Yu, let me remind you. There are three Blood Sect elders beside Wang Feng. One of them is already beyond the fifth grade and is tremendously powerful. And it’s unknown how many people are around.”

Ji Yue hesitated for a moment and reminded him.

Qin Yu nodded, turned around, and headed toward the seventh level.

With the help of the Gale Resistance Boot, Qin Yu practically turned into a stream of light and rushed toward the seventh level.

He had already arrived at the seventh level in less than half a day.

Before this, he would need about three days to travel from Solitary Cloud City to the seventh level of purgatory.

Qin Yu exchanged a portion of the spiritual power in his body for demonic qi with beads and walked to the coordinates given by Ji Yue.

However, there was nothing there.

“Did the Moon Listening Pavilion make a mistake?”

Qin Yu frowned.

He activated the desolate divine eye.

The world in front of him suddenly turned black and white. A massive formation appeared before Qin Yu’s eyes.

A massive formation covering about a thousand meters covered all the internal qi inside.

He followed the formation door and entered the formation.

He saw before him three gray-robed elders. One of them was holding a chain that was tied to Wang Feng’s collarbone.

Wang Feng was in a miserable state. There was not a single piece of intact skin on his body. Obviously, he had suffered inhuman torture.

“I’ll give you half a day to calculate the coordinates of the entrance to the next level!”

An elderly man with several scars on his face said gloomily.

“Elder Hui Yin, is the location that this guy calculates accurate? If it is wrong, there will be no chance of survival.”

Another elderly man frowned and asked.

“This kid has some skill. I’ve sent people to scout the first three levels. Nothing was wrong.”

Hui Yin said softly.

“If you miscalculate, I will definitely let you taste my Blood Sect’s Bone Devouring Punishment.”

He stepped forward and directly stepped on Wang Feng’s foot with a crack.

“Ah!”

Wang Feng’s body fell to the ground, and the intense pain made him roll crazily.

Qin Yu’s eyes were red. God knew how much inhuman torture Wang Feng had suffered?

Qin Yu remembered he only helped this kind man who only focused on studying formation a little, and he had used his life to help him deduce nine trigrams of destiny.

Wang Feng had indeed saved his life, but at this moment, this man was tortured to the point where he did not even look like a human. A monstrous anger erupted.

“You guys are courting death!”

Qin Yu’s voice was as cold as ice.

“Who is it?”

An elderly man shouted and struck out with his palm like a thunderbolt.

The explosive palm print slammed into Qin Yu’s chest. In the next moment, the afterimage dissipated.

Qin Yu instantly arrived in front of the elderly man and slapped down with a palm filled with anger.

“Crack!”

The elderly man turned into a pile of mud, and even his inner core was directly smashed into pieces.

“What a tremendous speed!”

Hui Yin’s pupils contracted.

Another elderly man formed a hand seal, and countless blood mists spread out from his body.
