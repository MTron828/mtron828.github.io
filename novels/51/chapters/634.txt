Chapter 635: Another Battle With Yan Guiyi! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The three of them were all in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm!

Even though Yan Guiyi only had one arm left, his imposing aura didn’t diminish.

Looking at Yan Guiyi, Qin Yu suddenly felt a strong killing intent in his heart!

“Yan Guiyi...” Qin Yu muttered the name in a low voice.

Then, the sword in his hand buzzed, and the blood-red internal qi became denser.

“Black-robed man, are you stupid? There are so many people in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, yet you still dared to come to the auction to die,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

“No one has dared to provoke our Jingdu Martial Arts Association like this,” the black-gold-robed man next to him sneered.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and sneered. “I want this thing today.”

“Oh really? How cocky,” Yan Guiyi said with narrowed eyes.

“Don’t think I don’t know who you are!”

Qin Yu’s heart tightened.

Could it be... that he had been exposed?

“Ancestor Guan, do you think you can hide the stench on your body by hiding in the black robe?” Just when Qin Yu was panicking, Yan Guiyi suddenly sneered.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

What Ancestor Guan? Qin Yu had never heard of him.

“Ancestor Guan, are you coming with us, or shall we kill you on the spot?” Yan Guiyi said with a cold smile.

The long sword in Qin Yu’s hand trembled slightly. He was actually looking forward to it!

“I wonder if the bronze sword can break his black-gold armor,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

As long as he didn’t have the protection of the black-gold armor, Yan Guiyi wasn’t worth mentioning at all!

Sensing the killing intent from Qin Yu, Yan Guiyi couldn’t help but snort. “It seems that you made the wrong choice!”

As he spoke, his internal qi began to surge rapidly, and a black-gold light surrounded his body!

Qin Yu’s expression was cold. He shook the longsword in his hand, and a stream of spiritual power was injected into it.

At this moment, the bronze sword seemed to have become Qin Yu’s right-hand man!

“I originally only wanted to snatch the thing, but I didn’t expect to have an unexpected harvest,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“I’ll take the lives of you three bastards!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu’s figure suddenly shot up, and his sword slashed down from the sky!

Yan Guiyi snorted coldly. He immediately raised one hand, then a black and gold light condensed in his hand and collided with Qin Yu’s bronze sword!

“Buzz!”

The entire venue suddenly erupted with a burst of dazzling light!

Countless people were sent flying by this internal qi, and the venue became even more chaotic!

The bronze sword penetrated the black-gold light and shook on Yan Guiyi’s palm!

Yan Guiyi felt waves of soreness on his palm, and a white scar appeared on his black-gold armor!

This made Yan Guiyi’s expression change slightly. He glanced at the two people beside him and said coldly, “Let’s attack together and kill him!”

The two people didn’t say anything and strode forward!

They were, after all, in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis realm, and their strength couldn’t be underestimated. Even Qin Yu didn’t dare to neglect them.

Qin Yu held the bronze sword in his hand and slashed out!

“Swoosh!”

The sword ray was several feet long and slashed towards the three of them!

The three of them immediately activated their spells and a huge hand appeared in front of them!

This huge hand actually grabbed Qin Yu’s bronze sword!

The three of them seemed to be able to use the same spell and their strength suddenly increased explosively!

“Boom!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At this moment, a huge hand condensed above the three of them!

The huge hand clenched into a fist and smashed at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu couldn’t dodge in time and was instantly hit in the chest. His body was sent flying out!

“You don’t know your place!” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

The three people walked over together. Above their heads, there were two huge hands.

This technique was inherited from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. It could only be used by three people at the same time!

Qin Yu climbed up from the ground and looked coldly at the three people. He couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“I can’t stay for long. I have to finish this battle as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he took a few steps back and held his sword with both hands. The first slash of the Nine Taiqing Slashes was formed!

“Buzz!”

A terrifying sword light rose from the bronze sword. The bright light almost made people unable to open their eyes!

Yan Guiyi’s expression changed slightly and he said coldly, “This technique is dangerous. Be careful!”

Then, the three of them worked together to activate the big hand!

The big hand resisted the sword light!

“Hiss!”

The Nine Taiqing Slashes were all-conquering, and the sharp sword light slashed at the two big hands!

The two big hands that were formed were actually slashed apart the moment they touched! They couldn’t even block the sword light at all!

“Oh no!” Yan Guiyi’s expression changed drastically, but the sword light was already falling toward the three of them!

“Boom!”

The ground beneath the three of them was shattered! The smoke and dust blocked everyone’s line of sight at this moment!

“Nine Taiqing Slashes?”

Below the stage, the Pavilion Master seemed to have seen through this technique.

“Could it be that the black-robed man is Qin Yu?” The Pavilion Master frowned slightly.

Above them, Qin Yu looked coldly in the direction of the three people.

As the dust settled, they saw a platinum shield in front of them!

This shield blocked the three people behind them, blocking the first slash of the Nine Taiqing Slashes!

But even so, the white shield still left a mark!

“They actually survived.” Qin Yu sneered repeatedly.

The longsword in his hand swayed slightly, and an extremely terrifying internal qi gathered on the bronze sword!

“If you can withstand the first strike, then what about the second strike?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Sensing the terrifying internal qi on the bronze sword, the three people’s expressions turned extremely ugly!

“Oh no. This strike is probably several times stronger than the previous strike!” Yan Guiyi cried out in alarm!

The other two naturally felt this dangerous internal qi as well!

Qin Yu said coldly, “Die.”

The sword light slowly condensed, and the second slash of the Nine Taiqing Slashes took shape.

An extremely strong pressure made the three people’s expressions suddenly change drastically!

Cold sweat flowed down their foreheads, and fear overcame them!

Yan Guiyi gritted his teeth and reached out his hand to activate the black gold ball.

But it was only then that he remembered that the black gold ball had long disappeared!

“Go to hell!” At this moment, Qin Yu roared and the sword in his hand fell down fiercely!

The sword ray, which was several feet wide, almost covered the entire venue!

Everyone was impacted at this moment. Although they weren’t the target, they were still shaken until they vomited blood. Some ordinary people were even crushed into meat paste on the spot!

“Ah!!”

Under the sword ray, a series of angry roars could be heard.

They activated their spells, and the white shield was above their heads!

“Buzz!”

However, this slash was too powerful. The white shield was slashed into two! It fell straight down.

“Crack!”

The ground beneath their feet turned into ruins. A sword scar that was dozens of meters long appeared across the ground.

Half a second later, the underground sword mark issued a series of loud sounds!
