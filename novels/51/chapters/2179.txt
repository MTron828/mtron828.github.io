2180 Not That Great!

Qin Yu looked up at the hideous sky, and with a hearty laugh, he said, “What a bullsh*t heavenly tribulation! Do you think you can make me perish here? It’s just a dream!”

As soon as he said that, the clouds in the sky started to gather and became even more hideous and terrifying.

Qin Yu adjusted her internal qi and prepared for the arrival of the third heavenly tribulation.

The Golden Light burst out from his entire body, and his internal qi was extremely powerful.

When the third heavenly tribulation descended, the dark clouds in the sky rolled endlessly, emitting a suffocating dark internal qi. The demons’ roars echoed in the void as if they were rejoicing at the impending destruction.

Qin Yu looked determined as ever, and the Golden Light on his body became even more dazzling. He stood in the void, welcoming the heavenly tribulation, firmly rooted like an indestructible mountain peak.

The dark clouds in the sky gradually gathered into a massive vortex filled with the energy of darkness and death. An enormous bolt of dark lightning began to take shape, emitting a terrifying destructive power.

This dark lightning resembled the demon’s blade, brandishing in the sky. Terrifying energy fluctuations burst forth from the lightning, distorting the surrounding space.

Qin Yu fixed his gaze on the dark lightning, filled with determination and courage deep down. He gathered his true essence, and a powerful force surged in his body. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

A powerful golden light emanated from Qin Yu’s body, forming an indestructible shield. The radiance emanated from the golden shield was a stark contrast with the dark lightning.

Qin Yu waved his palm, releasing an incredible attack. A golden energy ball formed in his hand, emanating a dazzling light.

Aiming his attacks at the dark lightning, he prepared to use a powerful force to defeat this heavenly tribulation.

The energy ball let out an explosive sound, and its tremendous speed was unfathomable. It contained all of Qin Yu’s strength and determination and was ready to break through the shackles of the dark lightning.

The dark lightning roared and attacked Qin Yu, releasing a power capable of destroying everything. Its speed was as fast as lightning, and its power was incomparably terrifying.

However, Qin Yu was unafraid at all. He condensed his true essence, and all of his strength erupted. His attack hit the dark lightning with a loud bang, releasing a dazzling light.

The golden energy collided with the dark lightning, resulting in a deafening explosion.

Energy fluctuations raged, and the spatial rift began to expand. The dark lightning began to tremble and collapse!

Qin Yu’s attacks became increasingly fierce. Every strike carried an indestructible power, attempting to tear the dark lightning apart.

His body was enveloped in golden light, exuding incomparable majesty and power. Each time he punched, it was like a god descending, attempting to force the dark lightning to retreat.

However, the power of this third heavenly tribulation was incomparably terrifying. It defeated Qin Yu’s punch gradually. That heavenly tribulation seemed to have given a new life. It carried a death-like internal qi and continuously forced Qin Yu back!

“The third heavenly tribulation has finally shown some decent skills.” Qin Yu’s tone carried a hint of mockery.

As soon as he said that, several more streaks of power appeared from the dark cloud, each turned into a pitch-black light that almost fused with the void. It was incomparably terrifying!

They were like demons born from the Path of Heaven, carrying the most primitive and pure terrifying power!

Qin Yu felt the terrifying pressure of those dark forces, but he did not back down.

He took a deep breath and adjusted his condition. He gathered his true essence and circulated all of his strength.

Qin Yu’s eyes flickered with unwavering determination. He had a clear goal in mind and was determined to face this third heavenly tribulation.

He raised his fist and unleashed a strike with all his might without hesitation.

An unparalleled power gathered in Qin Yu’s fist and formed a powerful golden air current.

This golden air current was full of Qin Yu’s determination and perseverance, and it contained his challenge and fearlessness toward the heavenly tribulation.

Qin Yu’s fist resembled a cannonball, blasting toward the dark forces.

“Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch!” Qin Yu roared and raised his hand to use his trump card!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s fist turned into a dazzling golden sun as if it wanted to illuminate everything!

It was the power of the true essence at its peak, pure and terrifying. The golden light lit a ray of radiance in the endless void, like a brightly-lit lamp that suddenly appeared in the long night!

The surrounding void was constantly trembling. Even the third heavenly tribulation seemed to feel the terrifying power of this punch!

“Come on, watch me shatter you!” Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily. His golden fist ruthlessly smashed toward the demons condensed from the heavenly tribulation!

As Qin Yu’s Ten Thousand Spell Breaking Punch punched toward the demons condensed from heavenly tribulation, the entire space seemed to tremble.

The golden fist carried a destructive aura. Like a meteorite, its speed was unfathomable.

In an instant, the demons’ bodies were instantly enveloped by the golden light as if they had been thrown into purgatory. They roared and tried to resist Qin Yu’s attack but failed to resist the boundless power brought by the shadows of the golden fist!

“Rumble!”

The golden fist crushed the demons’ bodies, shattering them into countless fragments, turning into pitch-black dust and dissipating!

The golden energy fluctuations spread and tore the void apart, illuminating the world!

The dark bolts of lightning in the heavenly tribulation were instantly defeated and turned into nothingness!

The dark clouds in the air started rolling, and the demons’ roars halted abruptly, plunging the entire scene into silence.

But Qin Yu did not stop. He continued to sprint forward, exerting his strength to the extreme.

His fist pierced through the void, and streams of golden energy burst out like meteors streaking across the sky.

Every strike carried destructive power, shattering the demon’s body and making it completely dissipate in the golden light.

The world seemed trembling for Qin Yu’s power, filled with praise and reverence.

A powerful golden light illuminated every corner, bringing hope and revival.

The surrounding void began to tremble, with energy fluctuations raging as if the heavens and earth trembled in response.

Qin Yu’s body flickered in the light. He stood in the void like a golden giant, invincible.

Under Qin Yu’s powerful punch, those dark forces were utterly obliterated, with no chance of escape.

Once again, tranquility returned to the world, and Qin Yu’s figure remained resolute, with eyes ablaze like torches.

He raised his head and looked at the strange and terrifying sky, his eyes filled with ridicule.

“The first three heavenly tribulations are not worth mentioning,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

In this void, Qin Yu’s strength had been greatly improved. Although he was still in the Semi-Saint Realm, his strength was no longer the same!

Perhaps it was due to the power brought by the chaotic qi or the torture by the chaotic qi that had improved his state of mind. In short, at this moment, Qin Yu’s strength and confidence had reached their peaks!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s battle intent surged, unafraid of anything!
