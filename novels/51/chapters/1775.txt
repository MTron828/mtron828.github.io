The surrounding people were discussing spiritedly. They seemed to be rather curious about these three strangers.

“I think I know who those people are,” someone said softly.

“The tallest and fairest should be Xiao Sheng from Nanzhou. He is known as the number one person in Nanzhou.”

“Xiao Sheng? Is he very strong?”

!!

“Yes, he is. He almost wiped out the entire Lizhou but was stopped by the dead river. This doesn’t make sense. Why would he come to Thunder Courtyard?”

“Who’s that short little girl beside him? Is she also going to join Demon-Slaying Peak?”

“I don’t know. That little one is so cute. Is she here to be a cute pet?”

The crowd was in a heated discussion. Among the three, Qin Yu’s appearance was the most ordinary. Thus no one paid any attention to him.

“Peak Master, I have a question,” Qin Yu suddenly said.

The peak master nodded and said, “If you have anything to ask, just ask.”

“Do you have many opportunities to go out of Demon-slaying Peak? How many demon-slaying operations have there been?” Qin Yu said with a frown.

If it was too rare, there was no need for Qin Yu to take the risk.

“We’ll issue many missions. As for how many, it depends on you. Demon-slaying Peak never forces anyone,” the peak master said indifferently.

“Of course, if you don’t accept a mission for more than a month, you will be automatically expelled from Demon-slaying Peak.”

Qin Yu thought to himself, “It seems there are many missions here. Just like Hunter back then.”

Following that, Qin Yu asked, “Are there any missions to Zhongzhou?”

The peak master was startled. He frowned and asked, “Why are you asking this?”

“I’m looking forward to going to Zhongzhou,” Qin Yu said casually.

The peak master smiled and said, “Yes, of course, there are. But no one here is willing to take on the missions to Zhongzhou because the missions there are the most dangerous. Likely, they won’t be able to return.”

Qin Yu was overjoyed. He quickly asked, ” Do we go to Zhongzhou through teleportation formation? ”

“Aren’t you talking nonsense?” the peak master rolled his eyes and said.

Qin Yu took a deep breath after he obtained the information.

He looked at the formation in front of him and said, “Alright, activate the formation.”

The peak master didn’t talk any nonsense. With a wave of his hand, he adjusted the internal qi of heaven and earth and chanted something.

Following that, eight array flags flew out from his palm and landed in eight corners of the formation. In a short while, the formation exploded with an extremely bright light!

The powerful sense of oppression was extremely terrifying. Even from a distance, one could feel it deeply.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sweat on his forehead.

It was impossible to say that he was not nervous. With Qin Yu’s current state, it was really difficult for him to pass through this formation.

“Why don’t we just forget about it?” At this moment, Xiao Sheng suddenly looked at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu shook his head, gritted his teeth, and said, “If it’s to devour the primordial spirit, I can give up. But this is the only place I can go to Zhongzhou. No matter what, I have to try.”

After saying that, Qin Yu strode with heavy steps and walked toward the formation!

The moment he stepped into the formation, Qin Yu felt as if there was a great force pressing down on his body!

Even though his physical body was extremely powerful, he didn’t have the slightest bit of power at this moment.

Qin Yu tried to mobilize the power in his body, but the pain immediately followed. In an instant, Qin Yu’s vision turned black, and he almost fell!

Seeing Qin Yu’s shaky posture, the onlookers couldn’t help but laugh. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“This is probably the weakest I’ve ever seen.”

“That’s right. When I first passed this formation, it was not very but pretty easy.”

“In such a state, why do you want to join my Demon-slaying Peak?”

Hearing everyone’s comments, Jue Wu couldn’t help but be angry. She clenched her small fists and fiercely glared at those people.

Xiao Sheng patted her on the shoulder, signaling her not to cause any trouble.

The peak master’s brows furrowed slightly.

“So weak? Why did the dean agree to let him enter Thunder Courtyard…” The peak master frowned.

In the formation, Qin Yu gritted his teeth and endured the pain, walking forward step by step with difficulty.

As he walked further away, the pressure on his body also became greater!

And the burst of Qin Yu’s strength made the pain even more intense!

Under such pain, Qin Yu’s vision had almost turned black as if he would fall at any time!

His body was swaying left and right, and he looked extremely weak.

Seeing this, the peak master couldn’t help but shake his head and say in a low voice, “It seems like this kid will have a hard time passing through. He’s not even halfway through. How should he proceed?”

Qin Yu, who was in the middle of the formation, gritted his teeth tightly.

Even though his vision was getting blurrier and the pain was getting more intense, he still gritted his teeth and did not have the slightest intention of giving up!

Qin Yu’s clothes were already soaking wet with sweat, and his legs were trembling.

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have lost his sense of direction.

“Plop!”

Finally, Qin Yu couldn’t bear the pain anymore.

He knelt on the ground with one knee, and the huge pressure almost smacked him to the ground!

“Tsk! Tsk! He failed as expected.” When everyone saw this, they all sighed.

The peak master also waved his hand, intending to close the formation.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu stood up again, trembling!

He supported his body and walked forward again!

This time, the pain was even more intense!

The pain alone was enough to make one go into a coma!

“It’s meaningless for you to do this,” the peak master said coldly.

However, Qin Yu ignored him. He growled like a wild beast about to go crazy!

He supported his body and walked forward step by step. Under the huge pressure, it seemed that he could fall at any time!

During this period, Qin Yu’s body was constantly being crushed, but he stood up again and again!

“Your spirit is commendable, but you are too weak.” Seeing this, everyone shook their heads.

“If this continues, you might die here. The pressure ahead is much stronger than now!” the peak Master berated.

How could Qin Yu give up? Even if there were thousands of obstacles in front of him, it couldn’t stop him from moving forward!

Jue Wu, who was watching from the side, was extremely distressed. She bit her red lips and quietly stretched out a wisp of internal qi from her palm, intending to help Qin Yu.

However, the moment that wisp of internal qi reached out, it was ruthlessly cut off by the peak master.

He coldly looked at Jue Wu and coldly said in her mind, ” “If you try to cheat again, I will disqualify him directly.”

Jue Wu had no choice but to watch Qin Yu walk forward with difficulty.

Finally, Qin Yu came to the end of the formation.

Just as the peak master had said, the pressure here was far exceeding the total pressure of the entire road!

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have completely lost the ability to resist.

The intense pain and pressure caused him to fall to the ground, and it was total endless darkness before his eyes.
