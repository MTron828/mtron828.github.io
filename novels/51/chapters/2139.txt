2140 Waiting for an Opportunity to Act

At this breathtaking moment, all eyes were focused on the fading light. Everyone’s heart was filled with nervousness and anticipation, anticipating the figure to appear after the light faded.

At this moment, the golden light gradually dissipated. Everyone’s eyes were fixed on that figure. As the light dimmed, the figure became increasingly clearer. Finally, the figure was completely revealed before everyone when the light completely faded

It was a young man. He stood at the peak of the mountain. His face was handsome, and his eye expression was firm. It was as if he was the center of the world at this moment.

This person was the chosen one!

Looking at this person, Qin Yu’s eyes moved slightly, and then he sneered.

“As expected,” Qin Yu said coldly. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The young man at the center of the light appeared radiant, and his cold expression soon vanished. It was replaced by a smile as refreshing as a spring breeze.

“Teng Zixu, it’s Teng Zixu!”

“This… This was too inconceivable. No wonder Teng Zixu had a smooth journey, and his cultivation speed was so fast that it was astonishing. It turned out that he was the chosen one!”

“The first True Saint of the younger generation is indeed worthy of his reputation!”

Everyone was shocked, but they also felt everything was reasonable.

The people from the nine great aristocratic families were silent. No one knew what those Holy Lords were thinking.

Soon, Teng Zixu’s side was full of people. Whether it was the people from the nine great aristocratic families or the various rogue cultivators, it seemed that none wanted to miss this opportunity to befriend the Teng family.

They all walked forward to congratulate Teng Zixu.

“Congratulations on becoming the chosen one by heaven, Brother Teng. I hope Brother Teng will take care of me in the future.”

“Brother Teng’s talent is indeed outstanding. It’s indeed our honor that you’re the chosen one.”

Saintess Gu and the others also came forward to congratulate Teng Zixu. Even the various Holy Lords also came before Teng Zixu. Smiles were on their faces, and there was no arrogance in their tone. For a moment, Teng Zixu was like a bright star in the sky, attracting everyone’s attention.

Upon closer inspection, Teng Zixu seemed surrounded by a mysterious radiance. It seemed to be the dao technique of the Path of Heaven.

After becoming the chosen one by heaven, Teng Zixu’s strength became unfathomable. In the same realm, it would be difficult for anyone to compete with him. Even a powerful True Saint like Si Liuhe might not be able to fight him.

“Brother Si, I had thought the one chosen by heaven would be you. I didn’t expect it to be Teng Zixu,” a cultivator walked over and said.

Si Shiyue glanced at him and snorted, “So what if I am the chosen one? Without the so-called chosen one, I can still step into the Tribulation Transcending Stage.”

After saying this, Si Shiyue walked to the side.

Everyone from the major sects had paid attention to Teng Zixu, and even Yan Tianshi was no exception. He personally walked to Teng Zixu’s side to congratulate him, and thus Yan Ruoxue could catch her breath for a short while.

Qin Yu concealed his internal qi and quickly walked to Yan Ruoxue’s side. Then, he grabbed Yan Ruoxue’s arm.

“Quickly leave,” Qin Yu whispered.

Yan Ruoxue’s eyes flashed with surprise when she saw Qin Yu rushing over. She had already prepared for this. After hearing Qin Yu’s words, she immediately turned around and left.

The two tiptoed and carefully walked toward the border.

At this moment, there was still a barrier lingering around the border, but this barrier could not block Qin Yu’s way.

Soon, Qin Yu held Yan Ruoxue’s hand and arrived at the barrier at the border.

Qin Yu mobilized the internal qi in his body and planned to break this barrier forcefully.

However, just as he was about to make a move, Yan Ruoxue stopped Qin Yu and shook her head. “No, if you forcefully break it, it will definitely attract attention.”

“There’s no other way now.” Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

“Look at me,” Yan Ruoxue said with a hint of cunning.

Then, she took out a talisman from her bosom.

The paper of this talisman seemed to be somewhat old. It was in faint yellow and covered with complicated patterns. It looked like a maze of intersecting geometric patterns and looked tremendously mysterious.

Yan Ruoxue carefully placed the talisman on the barrier. The moment it came into contact with the barrier, layers of ripple-like radiance spread out on the barrier, and a big gap appeared before them.

While Qin Yu was still in a daze, Yan Ruoxue grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said, “Stop watching and leave quickly!”

Qin Yu came to his senses. He did not waste time and quickly walked out with Yan Ruoxue.

“Follow me.” Qin Yu grabbed Yan Ruoxue’s fair arm and pulled her into his arms. In the next moment, Qin Yu stepped on the line word formula and shot out at a tremendous speed!

“Where are we going now?” Yan Ruoxue asked in Qin Yu’s arms.

“Astral Mountain,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Yan Ruoxue could not help but say, “This place is too far away from Astral Mountain. If we walk, it will take a long time to reach. Let’s go to Emerald Cloud County now. I have arranged an ancient ship there.”

Qin Yu could not help but be surprised.

It seemed that during this period of time, Yan Ruoxue had also paved the way in advance.

Emerald Cloud County was not far from here. If they had a carriage or a warship, their speed would be much faster!

Therefore, Qin Yu followed Yan Ruoxue’s instructions and brought her speeding toward Emerald Cloud County.

Their speed was tremendous, and they had already flown many li in an instant. In a very short time, the two arrived at Emerald Cloud County.

Following Yan Ruoxue’s directions, they arrived in a valley in Emerald Cloud County.

This place was quite calm and empty. Other than the whistling of the mountain wind, there was nothing else.

Yan Ruoxue broke free from Qin Yu’s embrace and came to a specific location. She raised her finger, and spots appeared on her palm. In a moment, a gigantic ancient ship appeared in front of them.

“This is…”

“Sky-concealing formation,” Yan Ruoxue said.

“Of course, I only set up a corner.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. He did not expect Yan Ruoxue’s attainments in formations to be so profound after such a long time. The sky-concealing formation was one of the most difficult formations to set up. Even the man with the mustache could only set up one foot.

After that, Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the gigantic ancient ship. This ancient ship was tall and majestic. It was several thousand feet long and like an enormous floating island in the air.

The wood on the hull looked ancient and timeworn. Various mysterious totems were engraved on it, and they were as if telling some ancient and mysterious stories.
