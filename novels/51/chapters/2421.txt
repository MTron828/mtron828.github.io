Chapter 2422 The Sign of Chaotic Times

Lei Xin glanced at Qin Yu. It was hard to tell from his expression whether he was happy or worried.

“What you’ve done has stirred up a massive storm. I reckon your name has already spread in the Holy Region. However, this matter isn’t simple.”

Lei Xin sighed.

“Dean Lei, are you talking about Wu Chang?”

“Yes, you killed the Buddhist disciple, Wu Chang, from the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect of the four schools and four Sects. This is a major problem. The other aristocratic families and the Teng family are starting to understand the threat you pose. We can’t relax.”

Lei Xin was happy for Qin Yu’s growth on the one hand, but on the other, he felt the pressure Qin Yu was facing was too great.

“There’s nothing we can do when trouble comes knocking on our door. Let’s not bother about this for the time being. Oh yes, Dean Lei. Has Ruoxue broken through?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

“Not yet, but it’s a good thing for Ruoxue. The longer she accumulates, it means the longer she can roam in the sea of the Path of Heaven. After she breaks through, her foundation will probably be much stronger than the others.”

Flower Granny looked at the dense tribulation clouds and nodded instead.

The final level of the tribulation power was to use the power of roaming in the sea of space to temper the body and soul, allowing one to reach the best state after advancing to the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

Si Shiyue had been in retreat since 70 years ago and started to break through after the golden age descended. He also had not completed his tribulation yet. Therefore, many people thought that he would be the first person to enter the tribulation in the Holy Region in the future.

During this period, countless people had already broken through in the Holy Region, like Flower Granny, Dean Lei, Yan Tianshi, Si Liuhe, and others. They had accumulated enough time, and breaking through was a matter of course when everything was in place.

Numerous rogue cultivators, people from sects, and families had also broken through.

Although the human race’s prosperous Path of Heaven was later than the other three races, it was still flourishing. Powerful people came out of seclusion one after another.

“Dean Lei, which sects do the four sects, four schools, and two saints belong to? Why haven’t I heard of them before?”

“The four schools, four sects, and two saints are all major sects that have established independent spaces. They are different from the nine great aristocratic families. Their sects rarely appear in the secular world, and they are the Heavenly Divination Sect, the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, the Thousand Buddha Sect, and the Heavenly Demon Sect. The four schools are the Divine Will School, the Clear Wind School, the Spiritual Beast School, and the Divine School. The two saints are the two sacred lands, Kunlun and Shenxiao.”

Lei Xin spoke slowly and deliberately. He did not seem to want to talk about these sects.

It was because once these sects appeared, chaotic times would definitely descend. Only then would these sects send their disciples to come out and roam the mountains.

The appearance of the disciple of the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect at this time indeed meant that chaotic times were bound to descend.

“When Wu Chang appeared, a little girl was with him. She had two red braids tied up and was barefoot. She seemed to be a drunkard and was drunk.”

Qin Yu suddenly thought of the strange girl earlier, and now was the time to ask Dean Lei.

“Qin Yu, she didn’t attack you, did she?”

Flower Granny and Lei Xin’s expressions changed drastically simultaneously.

“No, she directly took away Ghostly Sword Evil Eye, and Evil Eye’s power couldn’t impact her at all. I felt her strength is probably even more terrifying than the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect’s Wu Chang.”

“The people of that sect don’t like others to talk about them, so we don’t have to say much. Qin Yu, you must not offend her if you meet her again.”

Flower Granny’s expression was unusually solemn.

After that, Qin Yu told them everything that had happened on Peach Blossom Island.

Even though the two had received some news in advance, they were still so shocked that they were speechless for a long time.

“What a pity for the Great Xia Royal Family. In the past few Path of Heaven years, many have felt it strange that a royal family could become so weak. However, the Ji family is far too secretive, and no one discovered their setup. Back then, several people with powerful souls went to investigate, but they all died in an accident in the end. Now, it seems that it’s the Ji family’s doing.”

Lei Xin took a deep breath.

He was not confident that he could take them on if the Ji family used these methods to deal with Thunder Courtyard.

“The Ji family’s Way of Sorcerer Tribe is too mysterious. Therefore, for many years, even the most powerful aristocratic family turned a blind eye to some of the Ji family’s inhumane acts. I didn’t expect them to be so crazy.”

Flower Granny also sighed when she heard that. They also knew about the information Ji Yue had told them.

“Forget it. Let’s not talk about this anymore.”

Qin Yu moved his hand and pulled the two into the Sumeru ring, letting them see a few things. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Dean Lei and Flower Granny, these things were obtained from the Ji family. You can take them away and help the people of Thunder Courtyard increase their strength as soon as possible.”

With a move of his hands, Qin Yu handed all the items to Lei Xin. Thunder Courtyard had a large population, so the demand for these pills and treasures was even greater. If a Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivator could obtain a treasure, his strength would increase by at least 30%.

Moreover, with the spiritual river in the Sumeru ring now, the Green Spirit Tree could absorb the nearby spiritual energy.

As it had already formed a good cycle, the demand for these pills was not very high.

“Qin Yu, I won’t reject. I’ll take half of these things, and you can keep the rest.”

Lei Xin did not mince words with Qin Yu. He pushed half of the pills and herbs back.

After another round of selection, he chose ten tribulation divine artifacts and did not take the others.

“These are the more suitable magical artifacts. I don’t need the rest.”

“This Evil Eye can use the power of the ghost realm, and the sword body seems to have the will of Emperor Fengdu. Fortunately, you obtained the Five Emperor Coins of the Ji family. Otherwise, I’m afraid this thing isn’t a good thing. This sword might be coveted by many people, including the four sects and four schools. If you have sufficient methods for resolution, try not to use this thing.”

Flower Granny stared at Evil Eye with a grave expression.

She just came into contact with it through consciousness but already felt the boundless power of darkness about to assimilate her soul. If she continued to come into contact with it, her mind would probably collapse.

Qin Yu circulated the power of the Five Emperors, and a burst of righteous and noble energy was injected into Flower Granny’s body.

Only then did Flower Granny break free. The stronger a person was, the harder it would be to counter Evil Eye’s power.

“Flower Granny, what level is this ghostly sword? Such a powerful thing must be at the Peak of Tribulation Transcending, right?” Ji Yue asked curiously.

Flower Granny and Lei Xin knew Ji Yue’s identity.

Back then, Thunder Courtyard had put in a lot of effort to protect the Jee family’s bloodline, which was why they could send their remaining bloodlines to purgatory. Therefore, Ji Yue respected the two of them very much.

“If an ordinary human were to use this ghostly sword, it would suppress their strength instead. Qin Yu could use it because of his other dark divine sense, the Five Emperor Coins, and the Heart of Thunder. If a living being in the ghost realm gets this ghostly sword, it can even be considered a powerful celestial artifact. Its power depends on whether it can be unleashed.”
