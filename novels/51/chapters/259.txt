Chapter 260: The Origin of the Hong Yi Sect Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Facing Qin Yu’s question, Xing Hongtao said with a nonchalant smile, “Mr. Qin, you can understand it that way, but we don’t have to go to such an extent.”

“As long as you agree to join us, we will definitely give you abundant resources,” Xing Hongtao said patiently.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Why? Don’t you understand what I said?”

Seeing Qin Yu’s unyielding attitude, Xing Hongtao knew that it was almost impossible to recruit Qin Yu.

Therefore, he said with a nonchalant smile, “Alright, Qin Yu, let’s pretend that we never came.”

After saying this, Xing Hongtao turned around and left with the young man.

However, at this moment, Xing Hongtao suddenly felt a chill behind his back!

“Oh no!” Xing Hongtao cursed inwardly. He was about to turn around, but it was already too late!

Qin Yu’s fist smashed onto his back!

This punch shattered Xing Hongtao’s bones! His body was sent flying!

“Qin Yu, you actually dared to make a move?” The young man immediately shouted.

Qin Yu raised his hand and smashed his head.

In the distance, Xing Hongtao crawled up from the ground.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Qin Yu, if you kill us, the Hong Yi Sect definitely won’t spare you!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Since we have already formed an enmity, why should I let you guys go?”

Xing Hongtao’s expression immediately changed!

He was filled with regret. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have spoken in such absolute terms!

Qin Yu walked toward Xing Hongtao step by step, and a towering murderous aura surged toward him!

Xing Hongtao was a Inner Strength Past Master realm martial artist at his pinnacle, so his strength wasn’t to be underestimated.

Facing Qin Yu’s murderous aura, Xing Hongtao didn’t wait for his death. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He spat out a mouthful of silver needles, and they shot toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu frowned slightly. These silver needles were too small, so Qin Yu didn’t guard against them at all.

The silver needles entered the space between Qin Yu’s eyebrows.

A drop of blood flowed down the bridge of his nose.

Qin Yu touched the blood on his nose, and his expression became even gloomier.

Xing Hongtao laughed out loud and said, “Qin Yu, you have already been hit by my Hong Yi Divine Needle. You will definitely die within three days! If you admit your mistake now and hand over the formula of the Nine Transformation Golden Pill, I might be able to give you the antidote!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Three days, right? This is enough for me to kill you ten thousand times before.”

Xing Hongtao immediately panicked and said with some fear, “Qin Yu, you... don’t you want to live anymore?!”

“I’d rather die than be threatened by a person like you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

He raised his big hand and slapped Xing Hongtao’s head.

“Heaven Swallowing Technique!”

After an explosive shout, Xing Hongtao’s expression immediately became distorted.

The pain made him shout nonstop!

In a short while, Xing Hongtao became a dried corpse. He fell to the ground dead.

Qin Yu looked at Xing Hongtao’s corpse and reached out to grab it, then threw it into the yard.

After returning home, Qin Yu was surprised to find that Yao Qing was lying motionlessly on the bed.

“Yao Qing!” Qin Yu was a little anxious.

He hurried over to check his injuries.

Fortunately, Yao Qing was only unconscious and didn’t suffer any fatal injuries.

Qin Yu transferred spiritual energy to him. A moment later, Yao Qing slowly opened his eyes.

“Mr. Qin, there was an old man just now...”

“I know everything. Rest well,” Qin Yu interrupted Yao Qing.

Then, he turned around and returned to his room to sit cross-legged.

Qin Yu was somewhat worried about Xing Hongtao’s needle shot.

He didn’t dare to neglect it. He immediately closed his eyes and summoned his divine sense.

He saw a small black dot in his divine sense.

And this black dot was spreading at an extremely slow speed.

“Not good,” Qin Yu murmured.

He tried to use his divine sense to erase this black dot, but he found that the black dot seemed to be embedded in his divine sense. It couldn’t be erased at all.

This made Qin Yu extremely uneasy. Although he didn’t know what consequences the black dot would bring, if he didn’t deal with it, there would definitely be consequences.

That night, Qin Yu tried almost all methods, but he couldn’t erase the black dot. He could only stabilize it temporarily and try not to let it spread in his divine sense.

When he woke up, it was already the second day.

“I was careless and got screwed by him.” Qin Yu took a deep breath, and a serious expression flashed across his face.

At this moment, the sky was already bright.

There was only one day left until the time mentioned by Gu Taichu.

“Mr. Wu will probably take me to the military district today,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He didn’t have much time left, so Qin Yu hurriedly began to set up a formation.

He could feel that the power left behind by the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor was already dissipating.

It wouldn’t be long before Qin Yu would return to his original form.

This formation wasn’t difficult for Qin Yu, but this place was a peaceful place and didn’t have any dark energy to support it.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu suddenly thought of the stone statue!

The stone statue contained endless dark energy. If it was used as the formation core, this problem would naturally be solved!

“I’m really a genius!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Of course, using the stone statue as a formation core also had a hidden danger.

If it was discovered, it would very likely be destroyed.

Then the formation would also collapse in an instant.

Qin Yu found a relatively hidden place and placed the stone statue inside.

After checking a few times and confirming that there was no problem, Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief.

It was also at this time that Mr. Wu brought Xiao Yu to the door.

As soon as they got out of the car, Xiao Yu ran towards Qin Yu excitedly.

“Qin Yu, I have something important to look for you for. You have to help me no matter what!” Xiao Yu said impatiently.

Qin Yu said helplessly, “What is it this time?”

Xiao Yu said, “It’s about Yang Zhao. He said that he wants to run a lap with you.”

“Run a lap?” Qin Yu frowned.

Without thinking, he refused, “I’m not interested.”

“Gee, if you don’t go, he will definitely make things difficult for me...” Xiao Yu muttered softly.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “I have a lot of things to do. I don’t have time to play with you kids.”

Mr. Wu also berated her, “Xiao Yu, stop fooling around. I have something important to discuss with Qin Yu today.”

Although Xiao Yu was a little unwilling, she still obediently ran to the side.

Mr. Wu walked forward. He pointed at the corpses in the courtyard and frowned, “What’s going on?”

Qin Yu said, “These people came from the Hong Yi Sect. They attacked me last night and were killed by me.”

“Hong Yi Sect?!” Mr. Wu’s expression changed and a grave expression appeared on his face.

“Mr. Wu, you know about the Hong Yi Sect?” Qin Yu asked.

Mr. Wu nodded slightly and said in a low voice, “A few years ago, the Hong Yi Sect used their power to swindle, kill, and plunder, and they were very powerful. Rumor had it that there were people who surpassed the Inner Strength Grandmaster level among them.”

“It was only a few years ago, when Ye Qing made a move, that they were driven out of Pyro.”

“They have been doing well overseas and have countless martial artists working for them.”

Qin Yu nodded his head. Now, he had a general understanding of the Hong Yi Sect.

“How did you get yourself into trouble with such an organization?” Mr. Wu asked with a frown.
