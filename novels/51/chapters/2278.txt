2279 Capturing the Great Dao

Even in the long years of exile in purgatory, those who could comprehend the dao techniques of rules and broke through fifth grade were only close to a hundred.

Therefore, this moment was the greatest gain of this journey!

At this moment, a tremendous fluctuation awakened Chang Ye, Situ Haoyue, and Gu Ming. The few cultivators who had cultivated for a very long time instantly comprehended the spatial dao technique. They immediately sat in meditation.

At this moment, Qin Yu no longer hesitated to use his chaotic qi. His desolate divine eye activated to the extreme, and those dao techniques of rules expanded to their utmost extent within the world of the desolate divine eye.

Hundreds of spiritual essence in the Sumeru ring were crushed by him in an instant. They turned into a stream of spiritual energy river and flowed into the desolate divine eye.

However, this was still not enough. The desolate divine eye consumed a massive amount of terrifying spiritual energy every second.

It also consumed a massive amount of spiritual energy stored in the Sumeru ring, which was the precious demonic qi that Xiaoru and Little Fatty usually released, as well as the enormous amount of spiritual energy that they had stored while cultivating in the Fire Unicorn Continent.

At this moment, all of them activated instantly, immersing themselves into Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye, sustaining the form of the desolate divine eye.

There was a continuous vibration in Qin Yu’s hand, following the gradual unfolding of the spatial dao techniques.”

Waves of fluctuations rippled from his hands as if resonating with these rules.

“What a terrifying comprehension!”

Mei Li seemed to have sensed the way’s fluctuations on Qin Yu’s body. She looked at Qin Yu in shock, then silently immersed herself in cultivation.

“No, it’s too messy!”

Qin Yu was drenched in sweat. The twelve types of dao techniques intertwined like dragons, and the display of the rules of Path of Heaven was incomparably chaotic. In this situation, focusing on just one type was impossible, and attempting to comprehend too many resulted in utter confusion, ultimately leading to nothing.

A tremendous way suddenly unfolded before Qin Yu. That way carried a massive ancient internal qi.

This dao technique was the way of the masked woman’s first lifetime and the source of her power for her nine lifetimes.

That way carried a terrifying internal qi of primordial violence. The moment the desolate divine eye beheld it, it seemed brought to that era, feeling the ancient bleak and desolate atmosphere of the primordial continent nine lifetimes ago.

Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye stared fixedly at this Primordial Way, locking onto it like a divine sense.

“Whoosh!”

That way instantly disappeared into the void again. Qin Yu’s desolate divine eye also penetrated the space in an instant and entered the void comprehending the Primordial Way.

The desolate divine eye had pushed to its utmost limit with bloodshot veins covering its surface.

In just dozens of breaths, Qin Yu’s face had been covered in blood.

However, the fluctuations on his body grew increasingly formidable, and a primordial internal qi was gradually taking shape.

“What a terrifying talent! He had grasped one of the ways in such a short period and comprehended it extremely deeply.”

Chang Ye exclaimed. Even though he had lived for a long time, he had rarely seen a cultivator with such talent.

Even the tremendously talented Xi Menn opened his eyes and looked at Qin Yu.

“The aristocratic families of the Holy Region are extremely wary of this kid. It seems there’s a valid reason.”

Uncle Ling frowned and said. His expression showed a hint of struggle as if he was hesitating.

“Transmit the spiritual energy to Qin Yu with all your might!”

Elder Guai had broken through to the fifth-grade realm and was a True Saint cultivator who had comprehended the rules. He knew Qin Yu was at a critical moment.

In the Sumeru ring, almost all the spiritual essence he had collected recently had been completely depleted.

He collected these spiritual essences by ransacking the Azure Firmament Sect and killing the Blood Sect elders.

Under normal circumstances, it would have been enough for many True Saints to cultivate for a few years.

However, all the spiritual essence had been crushed in a short instant. Elder Guai, Wang Feng, Xiaoru, and Little Fatty were all out to release their spirit energy, hoping to help Qin Yu withstand this terrifying consumption of spirit energy.

At this moment, that way leaped again and shuttled into another void.

Qin Yu roared, and his desolate eye tore apart the chaotic lines in space and followed the way again.

Fresh blood flowed out from the desolate divine eye. The vision of the desolate divine eye was starting to blur, and the way before his eyes was getting chaotic.

“Fatty, let’s help Brother Qin Yu! Brother is a good person!”

Xiaoru held Little Fatty’s fleshy hand.

“Alright, Sister. I’ll listen to you. Whenever Brother cultivates, he will give us a lot of spiritual energy. Moreover, Sister has said that Brother has saved my life. I want to repay him.”

Little Fatty nodded obediently.

The two of them held hands and appeared in their true bodies. Xiaoru pinched off a petal while Little Fatty pulled off the thickest part of his ginseng trunk.

The ten-thousand-year-old daffodil and the ten-thousand-year-old ginseng suddenly transformed into vigorous spiritual energy in space.

“A shiver of coolness slowly flowed through Qin Yu’s soul, revitalizing his spirit.

The rich and substantial medicinal aroma repaired the damage the desolate divine eye brought and also provided an abundant supply of energy.

“Thank you.”

Qin Yu felt his eye sockets becoming warm, and he had probably guessed what had happened in the Sumeru ring.

However, this was not the time for him to be emotional. He frantically analyzed that way, and his sea of consciousness began to deduce crazily again.

A tremendous aura emanated from Qin Yu’s body, his hair dancing wildly as the primordial internal qi surged like a ferocious ancient beast. That aura built up in layers upon layers.

“Just a little bit more time!”

Qin Yu was screaming crazily in his heart. At this moment, he was already close to completely grasping the power of rules.

“Boom!

Gu Ming, by the side, sneered and suddenly slapped his palm forward.

Xi Menn snorted coldly, and suddenly, a sword light shattered the palm.

“What do you mean?”

Gu Ming roared with a contorted expression. He really wanted to interrupt Qin Yu’s cultivation.

Xi Menn ignored him and closed his eyes again.

“This person has just taken away the woman of nine lifetimes. If we allow him to continue cultivating, we can’t kill the woman of nine lifetimes!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Gu Ming shouted at them.

Now that his son was dead, the culprit was the woman of the nine lifetimes. He must kill her.

Moreover, the kid before him also had a blood feud with his son. He would not let Qin Yu off.

“This…”

Both Uncle Ling and Mei Li somewhat hesitated.

This was a grand opportunity that a cultivator might not encounter even once in his lifetime. It would become an enduring vendetta without end if it were really interrupted.
