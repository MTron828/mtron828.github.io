Chapter 1681: Chapter 1,681, preparing for closed-door cultivation Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu frowned slightly and asked, “Master, what is this eastern wastelands curse?”

Wen Wanji sat down cross-legged, as if he was recalling something.

A few minutes later.., wen wanji sighed and said, “The eastern wastelands used to be known as the most prosperous area, the land of the rising dragon. There were countless great cultivators. Rumor has it that the Heavenly Dao later placed a curse on them, causing everyone in the eastern wastelands to die prematurely, no matter how strong they were.”

“As far as I know, many great cultivators at the tribulation stage don’t have long lifespans. They only live for one to two thousand years.”

“You should know that normally, great cultivators at the tribulation stage can live for ten thousand years.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

For great cultivators at the Tribulation Stage, one to two thousand years was indeed too short. It was far from their cultivation and realm.

“But their cultivation doesn’t seem to be affected,”Zhuo Jing asked from the side.

Qin Yu nodded as well. This curse probably didn’t target their cultivation level.

Wen Wanji glanced at Qin Yu and nodded, “That’s right. It doesn’t affect their cultivation level, but I have to tell you a fact.”

“Grand cultivators at the tribulation stage who come from the east barren are generally weaker than other cultivators at the same realm.”

Hearing this, zhuo jing hurriedly said, “No wonder my father died in battle...”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He tried to mobilize the spiritual power in his body and found nothing unusual.

Wen wanyi seemed to have sensed Qin Yu’s thoughts. He knocked on Qin Yu’s head and said, “This kind of thing must be progressing slowly in your body. How could you notice it in an instant?”

Qin Yu’s face immediately became a bit ugly.

If he went to the central plains, wouldn’t he suffer a great loss when competing with his peers?

“Zhuo Jing, how long did it take for your father to fight with others?”Qin Yu asked.

Zhuo Jing thought for a moment and said, “About ten years.”

“Ten Years...”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

In other words, ten years had already had an impact.

For ordinary people, more than ten years was not a short time, but for cultivators, more than ten years was just a snap of the fingers. They could not even cross a realm.

“Is there any way to break it?”Qin Yu looked at Wen Wanyi.

Wen wanyi shook his head and said, “I don’t know about that. I heard this news from others.”

“Forget it. Let’s not think about that. Anyway, we have already been there.”Zhuo Jing suddenly smiled.

Hearing Zhuo Jing’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but let out a bitter laugh.

This guy had followed him to the east continent. It was fine if he didn’t blame him, but he actually comforted him instead.

“Let’s not think about that.”Qin Yu also waved his hand.

He took out more than ten jars of dragon blood from the spatial magic artifact and placed them in front of everyone.

“What is this thing?”Wen wanyi asked.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Dragon Blood. Dragon blood obtained from the Dragon Burial Cave.”

Wen Wanyun’s jaw dropped when he heard this!

He gulped and said, “Dragon Blood? Dragon burial cave? You’ve been to the Dragon Burial Cave?”

Qin Yu nodded and then waved his hand. “Now is not the time to talk about this. In short, this is the blood from the Dragon God’s body.”

Then, Qin Yu took out six jars and handed them to zhuo jing, saying, “This is yours.”

Qin Yu took out three more jars of the remaining six jars and handed them to Wen Wenzi.

“Master, these three jars are for you, but the body of an ordinary person can’t bear it. It will take many years for the three jars to be used up, so you can share one of these three jars of dragon blood,”said Qin Yu.

Wen wanyi stared at the dragon blood in front of him, not knowing what to do for a moment. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Oh right, I have to remind you that you can’t take this thing directly. Otherwise, that powerful force will cause your body to explode and you’ll die. It’s best if you use it to refine pills,”said Qin Yu.

They didn’t have a strong physique like Qin Yu, so it was impossible for them to withstand the dragon blood.

After dividing the Dragon Blood, Qin Yu continued, “I still have a dragon eye in my hand, but I don’t know how to use it yet, so I’ll keep it with me for now. I’ll share it with all of you in the future.”

“Kid, you’re really awesome. You even brought out your eyeballs.”Wen wanyi could not help but sigh.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. After dividing the dragon blood, he planned to go into seclusion.

Qin Yu did not choose the great Yue Mountain as the location of his closed-door cultivation was likely to bring trouble to Wen Wanji.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to go to the divine capital.

The array patterns of the divine capital could not be forcefully broken by even those at the reversion void stage. It was considered the safest place.

Qin Yu did not stay any longer and brought Zhuo Jing to the divine capital on the same day.

The divine capital.

This place had become exceptionally prosperous.

Many people who had offended people outside ran to the divine capital to seek refuge.

And this place had also imperceptibly set a rule that as long as one stepped into the divine capital, no one was allowed to make a move inside the city.

“This is the divine capital.”Zhuo Jing raised his head to look at the faint array pattern and could not help but sigh.

“Who was the one who set up this array pattern?”

Qin Yu did not say anything. This array pattern was probably set up by a top formation master many years ago. Currently, there was probably not a single person in the entire South Province.

The two of them arrived at the foot of the city. Just as they reached the door, they were stopped by two people.

“Register,”the two people said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu said with some surprise, “Now that we are entering the divine capital, we still have to register?”

The guard glanced at Qin Yu and said, “In order to prevent people from fighting, all people who enter the divine capital must register.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu was even more surprised.

He didn’t expect that the divine capital had developed so perfectly during the time he left the divine capital!

“I am Qin Yu.”Qin Yu walked forward and said his name.

The guard did not say much and immediately began to register Qin Yu.

This made Qin Yu a little curious.

“I said I am Qin Yu. Don’t you feel surprised?”Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

The guard sneered and said, “There are many people with the same name. What’s there to be surprised about?”

“The same name? He doesn’t have the same name. He is the Qin Yu who built the divine capital,”Zhuo Jing said with a smile.

The guard said impatiently, “Our city lord is in seclusion in the divine capital. Don’t talk nonsense. Do you want to go in or not?”

Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing looked at each other and frowned slightly.

The city lord was in seclusion in the city? This was a bit too ridiculous.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He obediently registered according to the guard’s request. Then, he walked into the divine capital with Zhuo Jing.

“He said you were in seclusion in the city. What’s going on? is someone claiming to be in seclusion?”Zhuo Jing said in a deep voice.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know. Let’s go in and take a look first.”

After not returning for a few days, the construction of the entire divine capital was extremely complete. However, the spiritual Qi was still scarce, causing the people here to be unable to cultivate.
