Chapter 1228: Chapter 1,228, I’m Tougher Than You! 

This scene undoubtedly shocked everyone!

Even Qin Yu was rather surprised.

He looked at his own body and repeatedly confirmed that, as expected, his body was not affected in the slightest.

“This poison... doesn’t seem to be of any use to me,”Qin Yid in a low voice.

Could it be that his chaotic body constitution was immune to the poison?

“It is indeed useless.”Qin Yook his arm, his body completely unharmed.

“That’s easy to say.”Qin Yu raised his head to look at the purple jade origin snake, the corners of his mouth curling into a sneer.

The audience below the stage had long been in an uproar!

Since the start of this competition, countless people had died under the poison of the Purple Jade origin snake, but Qin Yu was not affected at all!

“This kid... There’s something wrong,”deer emperor muttered on the stage.

But he wasn’t worried because the poison was only one of the purple jade origin snake’s tricks. Even if he was immune to the poison, it was impossible to defeat the Purple Jade origin snake.

Not to mention anything else, just the purple jade origin snake’s armor-like scales weren’t something he could deal with.

Of co, this was only deer emperor’s own thoughts.

Qin Yu looked at the Purple Jade origin snake in front of him and gave up on the idea of taking out the iron rod.

“Little Guy, let me play with you properly.”Qin Yu grinned.

The next second, Qin Yddenly clenched his fist and shot toward the Purple Jade origin snake!

His divine power was incomparably vast, and with the addition of a few pieces of speed, his fist smashed onto the purple jade origin snake’s body in the blink of an eye!

“Clang!”

The loud sound was deafening, and some people’s eardrwere even shattered!

“It’s useless.”Deer Emperor could not help but shake his head when he saw this.

“The toughness of these scales is comparable to... F * ck!”

Before Deer Emperor could finish his words, his eyes widened!

The scales that were strby Qin Yfist fell down like broken glass! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Not only that, the powerful penetrating force contained in Qin Ypunch even caused the flesh beneath the scales to collapse!

“Hiss...”

The Purple Jade origin snake felt the pain and let out a strange cry.

Qin Yu landed on the ground. He looked at the Purple Jade origin snake in front of him and sneered, “This is only the beginning. Yoould enjoy it.”

The purple jade essence snake naturally would not sit still and wait for death. He could see that Qin Yu was not ordinary and immediately swung his snake tail at Qin Yu!

The snake tail was incomparably huge. Wherever it passed, huge rocks would be rolled up, causing the air to vibrate with a buzzing sound!

“Swoosh!”

The snake tail came straight at Qin Yu! However, Qin Yu did not panic at all.

Blue veins popped up on his arms. His hands suddenly stretched out and grabbed the purple jade essence snake’s snake tail!

The vast divine power was clearly displayed. The purple jade origin snake tried to struggle but found that it could not break free!

This caused everyone’s expression to change drastically!

The Purple Jade origin snake had three ultimate moves. One was poison, and it had twenty bodies. The most powerful one was the power of its tail!

But at this moment, the snake’s tail was actually grabbed by Qin Yu and could not move at all!

Even Lu Huang, who was on the stage, could no longer maintain his composure. He stood up abruptly and glared at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu grabbed the snake’s tail and sneered, “Little Fellow, your strength isn’t enough!”

With that, Qin Yu exerted strength with both his arms and roared furiously!

He grabbed the snake’s tail and forcefully threw the huge body of the purple jade origin snake into the air!

Such power was shocking!

The purple jade origin snake’s body fell to the ground, stirring up waves of dust!

Everyone stared at this scene, their jaws almost dropping!

At this moment, Deer Emperor was a little nervous.

He regarded the Purple Jade origin snake as his pet, so he naturally didn’t want anyone to defeat it!

“There’s still hope, there’s still one last move!”Deer Emperor thought crazily in his heart.

Under the dust, the Purple Jade origin snake rose up from the ground.

Its small dark pupils were exuding extreme anger!

“What, are you angry?”Qin Yid with a faint smile.

“Hiss!”

After the Purple Jade origin snake let out a shrill cry, it suddenly shot toward Qin Yu!

It coiled around Qin Ybody at an extremely fast speed!

Its huge body made Qin Yu tremble tightly, making him unable to move!

The most powerful strength of a python like this was the power of entanglement!

Not to mention the purple jade origin snake, which had the bloodline of an ancient mutated beast, even an ordinary Python could easily crush a person’s bones!

“Success!”On the stage, Lu Huang immediately heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this.

He was very clear about the power of entanglement of the purple jade origin snake. That power was definitely not something that a human could withstand.

Even the body of a mighty figure would be crushed into pieces, let alone this Qin Yu!

Qin Yu, who was entangled in the middle, felt the coldness from the purple jade origin snake’s body. This feeling made him feel quite comfortable from the heat.

“Is this the ultimate move?”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

The Purple Jade origin snake crazily curled up its body and kept shrinking the space, wanting to completely crush Qin Yu!

Qin Yeered and said in a low voice, “I’ll just use you to test my body.”

The strength of this purple jade origin snake was beyond imagination. It was not an exaggeration to say that it was the strongest strength Qin Yu had ever seen!

It was the most suitable to be used as an experiment!

The Purple Jade origin snake was still crazily coiled its body and quickly shrthe space to the limit.

There was no longer any space left in Qin Ybody. If he continued rolling, the pressure on his abdomen would surge, and he would be the first to explode!

But at this moment, the purple jade origin snake realized that no matter how hard it tried, the space could not shrink any further!

Qin Yu, who was trapped in the middle, was like a piece of metal, extremely hard!
