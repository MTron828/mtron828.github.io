Chapter 264: Xiao Yu’s Accident Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The old man on the mountain had his hands behind his back, and a cold light shone in his eyes.

Meanwhile, Yang Zhao was driving fast on the road.

Looking at the two beauties in the car, Yang Zhao couldn’t help but swallow hard.

Xiao Yu’s figure and facial features were simply irresistible.

“Forget it, having Xiao Mi is enough...” Yang Zhao thought to himself.

“Yang Zhao, this doesn’t seem to be the way to the hospital, right?” Xiao Mi frowned.

Yang Zhao said with a lecherous look, “Don’t worry. I have a friend who is an amazing doctor. He’s much better than those in the hospital!”

Xiao Mi frowned even more deeply.

She felt that Yang Zhao was lying.

Moreover, his gaze unsettled her.

The further they drove on this road, the darker it became. Soon, there were almost no signs of human habitation in the surroundings.

“Let’s go to the hospital,” Xiao Mi said with some fear.

Yang Zhao smiled evilly. “We’re almost there. What are you afraid of? Don’t worry. You’ll be happy soon...”

Hearing this, Xiao Mi became even more afraid.

She shook the car door, but found that it was locked.

“Put us down quickly. I’m not going!” Xiao Mi said anxiously.

But Yang Zhao didn’t listen at all. He drove all the way to the foot of the mountain.

“We’re here.” Yang Zhao stepped on the brakes and stopped the car in front of the old man.

When she saw the surrounding environment, Xiao Mi’s expression was extremely ugly, and she panicked!

She opened the car door and turned around to run, but Yang Zhao grabbed her hair!

“B*tch, you want to run now? It’s too late!” Yang Zhao said fiercely.

Xiao Mi struggled desperately, but she was just an ordinary girl. How could she be a match for Yang Zhao?

Yang Zhao raised his hand and slapped Xiao Mi’s face. He cursed fiercely, “You’d better behave yourself! Otherwise, I’ll kill you!”

Xiao Mi was so scared that her face paled, and she couldn’t help but cry.

Her whole body trembled, and her lips quivered as she said, “Yang Zhao, you... what do you want to do...”

“Hehe, Little sl*t, what do you think I want to do? You dared to scold me?” Yang Zhao gnashed his teeth and said.

At this moment, the old man said indifferently, “Not bad, there are unexpected gains.”

“Huh?” Yang Zhao was stunned.

The old man raised his finger, and a powerful force immediately pressed towards Xiao Mi.

In an instant, Xiao Mi fainted. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Then, the old man waved his hand, and Xiao Mi was grabbed by the old man.

Upon seeing the old man’s move, Yang Zhao was dumbstruck.

He had never seen something so magical!

For a moment, Yang Zhao thought this old man was a living immortal!

“Good, she’s actually a virgin. Well done.” The old man nodded with satisfaction.

Yang Zhao’s expression changed, and he said boldly, “Sir, this girl is mine. Can you give her to me...”

The old man narrowed his eyes and looked at Yang Zhao coldly.

Yang Zhao instantly felt a chill and cold sweat flowed down his back!

He hurriedly knelt down and begged for mercy. “Sir, I was wrong. This girl is yours...”

The old man snorted coldly and said indifferently, “From today onwards, you will be in charge of finding me women. Remember, only virgins, and the younger the better.”

Yang Zhao was stunned. He smiled sheepishly and said, “Sir, I didn’t expect you to have such a fetish...”

When the old man heard this, he immediately raised his hand and pressed down!

The terrifying qi energy made Yang Zhao kneel on the ground and he couldn’t get up!

“Sir, I was wrong...” Yang Zhao hurriedly said.

The old man then withdrew his qi energy and snorted coldly. “Remember, in the future, find me three virgins every month. The younger the better, understand?”

“Yes, yes...” Yang Zhao nodded desperately.

“Don’t worry, there will be no lack of benefits for you.” With that, the old man flicked his finger, and a pill fell into Yang Zhao’s hand.

Yang Zhao took the pill, and he couldn’t help but feel a little puzzled.

“This pill came from the hands of an Earth Fiend Valley elder. It is a holy pill. It will have a magical effect on you,” the old man said indifferently.

Yang Zhao hurriedly nodded and said, “Thank you, sir!”

In the next second, the old man reached out and grabbed Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi before disappearing into the night.

Yang Zhao wiped his sweat while feeling lingering fear.

This old man’s tricks looked too scary...

He carefully put away the pill, then drove home.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu was speeding toward the race track.

But when he arrived at the race track, he found that Yang Zhao had long disappeared.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at the people on the track and asked coldly, “Where’s Yang Zhao?”

A few young men sized up Qin Yu and said impatiently, “Who are you?”

“I’m asking you where Yang Zhao is,” Qin Yu said coldly.

The young man waved his hand and said, “How would I know? Get lost!”

After saying that, the young man reached out and pushed Qin Yu’s chest.

Qin Yu immediately grabbed his wrist and suddenly exerted force. The young man immediately grimaced in pain and shouted.

“I’m asking you, where is Yang Zhao?” Qin Yu said coldly.

The young man hurriedly said, “Something happened to Yang Zhao just now. He took a girl named Xiao Yu to the hospital...”

“Hospital?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Can you let go first...” the young man said in pain.

Qin Yu let go of his hand, and the young man immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

“What exactly happened?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

The young man smiled bitterly and said, “Yang Zhao said that he wanted to hook up with that girl named Xiao Yu, so he made a bet with her on car racing.”

“But for some reason, Yang Zhao deliberately stopped the car during the race. Xiao Yu’s car flipped, and she fell into a coma...”

“Later on, he took Xiao Yu and her friend called Xiao Mi to the hospital...”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned extremely cold.

He didn’t say anything else and turned around to walk out of the door.

After he walked out of the door, Mr. Wu’s call came in.

“Qin Yu, why hasn’t Xiao Yu returned home yet?” Mr. Wu muttered.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “I was just about to tell you about this.”

“Huh?” Mr. Wu was stunned.

“Isn’t Xiao Yu with you?”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “No...”

Then, Qin Yu told Mr. Wu the whole story.

After Mr. Wu heard it, he was furious!

“Yang Zhao... how dare he try to defile my daughter? I will never forgive him!” Mr. Wu roared angrily.

“Mr. Wu, the most important thing right now is to find Xiao Yu first,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“How about this? Find out which hospital Xiao Yu is in. I’ll go find Yang Zhao. Let’s split up,” Qin Yu said.

“Okay, okay. I’ll go find someone to ask!” Mr. Wu said quickly.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu turned around and returned to the racing field. He grabbed a random young man and rushed to Yang Zhao’s house.
