1835 The Suffering Jue Wu

Ever since the fall of North Plain, Li Yingying had disappeared.

But she didn’t give up. A person blinded by desire and distorted her mind couldn’t tell right from wrong.

As she had initially set her sights on Tianyun Sect, she had been active around the sect.

However, before she could take action, the Tong family arrived and brought a destructive disaster to Tianyun Sect.

It made Li Yingying quickly turn her attention to the Tong family, and she also took the opportunity to curry favor with them.

!!

Now, Li Yingying had succeeded in taking a position in the Tong family. As she was talented, to begin with, being nurtured by the Tong family, her strength had improved by leaps and bounds. She also learned many powerful cultivation techniques.

With such a background, Li Yingying had become the Tong family’s lackey through and through. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

At the Tong family, Li Yingying’s body was covered in a sparkling white armor. She held a silver spear in her right hand and two colored balls in her left.

These two colored balls were the supreme treasures given to her by the Tong family. Although they were not as good as Saint Weapons, they were not too far off.

Tong Guangqing looked at Li Yingying in front of him and said quietly, “From today onward, Lizhou is handed over to you. I hope you can give me a satisfactory response.”

Li Yingying, who had finally managed to get to her position, hurriedly nodded and said, “Don’t worry. I will!”

“Do you know what I want?” Tong Guangqing squinted his eyes and asked.

“The absolute rule,” Li Yingying quickly replied.

“Hahaha!” Tong Guangqing could not help but laugh out loud.

“I’m indeed very interested in Nanzhou. I believe that there must be a supreme treasure hidden in Nanzhou, but no one has discovered it yet,” Tong Guangqing said indifferently.

At this point, Uncle Guan suddenly said, “What else?”

“Find Qin Yu and force him to show up,” Li Yingying said with a bow.

“That’s right.” Uncle Guan’s face revealed a smile.

At this moment, Uncle Guan raised his hand slightly, and two people walked in from outside.

The two of them were dragging a girl who looked very young girl.

And this girl was none other than Jue Wu.

At this moment, Jue Wu had already been tortured to the point that she was unrecognizable. The Tong family had noticed a supreme treasure hidden within Jue Wu’s body and had thought of all ways to get the purple cloud pearl out. Unfortunately, they failed to do so in the end.

It was also due to this that Jue Wu was severely injured and suffered inhuman torture.

“Take her with you. Hang her on the city wall as a deterrent,” Tong Guangqing said indifferently.

Li Yingying felt an indescribable perverted pleasure in her heart as she looked at Jue Wu.

Li Yingying was born in Nanzhou. Thus she naturally knew what Ju Wu symbolized.

She was one of the three lunatics of Nanzhou who stood at the peak of Nanzhou!

It was no exaggeration to say that she was only second to the Xiao brothers!

However, it was precisely the pleasure of having in her hands this kind of person who was once out of her reach that made Li Yingying feel exceptionally excited!

“Yes, sir!” Li Yingying hurriedly bowed and said.

At this moment, she abruptly changed the subject and continued, “But… Jue Wu has a close friend in Nanzhou named Wen Wanchong. I’m afraid he will… fight for Jue Wu.”

Tong Guangqing snorted and said, “I’ve said it before. I want absolute rule! These unstable people must be eliminated!”

After saying this, Tong Guangqing looked at Uncle Guan.

“Understood, Young Master,” Uncle Guan immediately bowed and replied.

The following day, the Tong family sent people to attack Dayue Mountain.

Even though Wen Wanchong was powerful, he was still weak against the Tong family.

After the great battle, Wen Wanchong took Wen Da and Wen Er and fled from Nanzhou.

Not only Wen Wanchong but everyone who posed a threat was killed by the Tong family.

With the Tong family paving the way for her, Li Yingying had nothing to fear.

She had chosen the former Tianyun Sect as her city.

And Jue Wu was brought back to Nanzhou in this way.

At Tianyun Sect, Li Yingying sat on the seat that used to be Xiao Sheng’s. Her heart was full of an indescribable sense of satisfaction.

Looking at the half-dead Jue Wu in front of her, she was even more excited and couldn’t help laughing.

“Jue Wu, I never thought that I, Li Yingying, could persecute you one day,” Li Yingying said indifferently.

Jue Wu, lying on the ground, raised her head with difficulty.

She looked at Li Yingying in front of her and couldn’t help but curse, “What d*mned thing are you? I remember now. You are the famous… b*tch in Nanzhou. Hahaha!”

Upon hearing this, Li Yingying constricted her pupils.

She suddenly moved forward and grabbed Jue Wu’s neck. She gritted her teeth and said, “Say that again! Do you believe I’ll kill you?”

“Come on! Do you dare… You’re just a dog of the Tong family.” Jue Wu wasn’t afraid.

Li Yingying’s eyes flashed with a trace of viciousness. She grabbed the spear and suddenly stabbed it into Jue Wu’s chest!

“Strip her naked and hang her on the city wall!” Li Yingying roared madly.

The people around her immediately stepped forward and wanted to do the shameless thing to Jue Wu.

“If you dare, I’ll kill myself immediately!” Jue Wu coldly said.

Li Yingying’s expression changed slightly.

If the Tong family didn’t want Jue Wu to die, she wouldn’t dare to let anything happen to her.

Li Yingying knew very well that Jue Wu would do what she said.

“Alright! I’ll let you off for now,” Li Yingying said reluctantly.

“Don’t worry,” she said with squinted eyes. “After Qin Yu shows up, I’ll definitely cripple your cultivation, break your limbs, and throw you into a brothel!”

After saying this, Li Yingying waved her hand and ordered her men to hang Jue Wu on the city wall of Tianyun Sect.

The people from Nanzhou looked at Jue Wu on the city wall and couldn’t help feeling emotional.

“It’s really fate that makes a fool out of people. The once-great Jue Wu has actually fallen to such a state,” someone sighed and said.

Those who were soft-hearted prayed for Jue Wu below the city wall. And those who hated her would curse at her.

Seeing this, Li Yingying felt even more proud.

On the same day, she ordered that anyone who passed by the city wall must spit.

News about such a vicious woman quickly spread in Nanzhou.

…

At Demon-slaying Peak, the carefree Chang Mang soon mingled with the group after the previous incident.

Chang Mang personally visited and apologized to Jiu Xiao for fighting with him that day due to a misunderstanding.

In addition, due to Chang Mang’s outstanding performance in carrying out the missions, he gradually built prestige in Demon-slaying Peak.

“Chang Mang, with your talent, I believe you will surpass Jiu Xiao sooner or later.”

“That’s right. Speaking of which, it’s still that kid Qin Yu who’s really capable. The friends he made are all extraordinary.”

Chang Mang glared at them and scolded them, “Nonsense! You know nothing. Qin Yu is much stronger than me. His strength is beyond mine, and his future achievements will definitely exceed mine!”
