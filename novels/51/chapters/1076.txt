Chapter 1077: Chapter 1,077, the origin of the handlebar mustache 

The two of them each had their own ulterior motives as they walked towards the Yan family.

Yan Jinyao never thought that he would one day fall into collusion with he teng.

In a certain room of the Yan family.

Yan Jinyao and he teng sat opposite each other. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Tell me, what do you have in mind?”Yan Jinyao asked directly.

He Teng said indifferently, “You and I will join hands and get rid of Qin Yu. It’s that simple.”

Yan Jinyao’s face darkened and he said coldly, “Then where will my face go?”

“Don’t worry, I have already thought of it for you.”He Teng said with a faint smile.

“He, Qin Yu, is occupying the second mystic realm. This is a great temptation. Who knows how many people in the world are coveting it.”

“As long as you and I use the excuse of asking Qin Yu to withdraw from the second mystic realm as an excuse, it will be considered as a well-known accomplishment.”

After saying this, he teng leaned against Yan Jinyao’s ear and whispered something.

After Yan Jinyao heard this, he immediately laid down on the chair and fell into silence.

A moment later, Yan Jinyao’s eyes flickered with a sharp light as he coldly said, “Alright, we’ll do as you say!”

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was sitting in the second secret realm, flipping through the relevant documents of the martial arts association of Jingdu.

These documents involved most of the resources hidden by the martial arts association of Jingdu. And now, these resources had all fallen into Qin Yu’s hands, which was the key to cultivation.

As for the battle with Yan Jinyao, Qin Yu didn’t take it seriously at all.

As one of the most powerful physiques in the world, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of anyone of the same level.

Even though he, Yan Jinyao, had the Yan family and his own bloodline, the Yan family did not take a fancy to him at all. This meant that the effect of this bloodline on Yan Jinyao was not as powerful as he had imagined.

“Many of the resources recorded in this document are undeveloped,”Qin Yu said in a low voice as he flipped through the documents.

Many of the resources were only suspected to be the battlefield of the past, but no one knew whether they were real or fake.

Qin Yu put away the documents and said in a low voice, “When I have time, I have to go and explore it.”

“TSK TSK, how is my purple-gold calabash? Is it damaged?”

At this moment, the voice of the moustache entered his ears.

Qin Yu looked up at the moustache, took out the purple-gold calabash, and threw it back to the moustache.

“I was just about to look for you.”Qin Yu waved his hand, and a chair fell under the butt of the handlebar mustache.

“Look for me? Why?”The handlebar mustache muttered.

Qin Yu stretched lazily and said, “How much do you know about the first mystic realm? Also, how much do you know about the ancient array platform in the first mystic realm?”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, the mustache man’s expression changed slightly.

“What are you talking about? Why don’t I Understand?”The Mustache Man muttered.

Qin Yu snorted lightly and said, “Mustache Man, I treat you as a friend. Do you really treat me as a fool?”

The Mustache Man’s expression changed slightly. He braced himself and said, “What are you talking about? Do you have a fever?”

Qin Yu slowly stood up and said coldly, “I don’t want to see a war between us. How many things are you hiding from me?”

The Mustache Man scratched his head. He looked a little flustered.

“Tell me. Why did you come close to me?”Qin Yu questioned coldly.

The Mustache Man saw that he couldn’t hide it and could only sigh slightly.

“Alright, what do you want to know?”The Mustache Man sat opposite Qin Yu like a deflated balloon.

Qin Yu did not make things difficult for the Mustache Man. He said indifferently, “Everyone has their own privacy. Don’t worry, I won’t make things difficult for you. I just want to ask you a few irrelevant questions.”

“First, it’s the ancient array platform of the first mystical realm. Where will it send people?”

“Second, where is the world being teleported to? What’s the difference between it and us?”Qin Yu said quietly.

The mustached man raised his head and looked at Qin Yu with an unprecedentedly serious expression.

“You even know about the ancient array platform. I really underestimated you,”the mustached man said with a laugh.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly.

This mustached man really knew something!

“The ancient array platform is indeed in the first secret realm, and just as you said, it’s a passage to another world,”said the handlebar mustache.

“To be precise, it’s not another world, but another star field. For cultivators, that is a wider world, with more abundant resources and more top-notch experts.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but slightly frown. “Strange. According to what you said, those top-notch people recorded in the history books of the Martial Arts Association of Jingdu are nothing in that star field?”

“For example, the masked woman you are extremely afraid of, and the entire sect of the immortal slaying sect. They are not qualified to enter that star field? Can they only hide on earth?”

The mustached man waved his finger and said, “You are wrong. Since they are top-notch experts, crossing the Void is nothing to them.”

“For example, the masked woman has crossed the void many times and traveled almost the entire universe, but she stayed on Earth in her later years.”

“Not only the masked woman, but many top-notch great cultivators who have transcended the tribulation have also descended to Earth. I know that there are more than ten great cultivators who have discussed the Dao on the five mountains Supreme Mountain.”

“It’s not an exaggeration to say that almost every top-notch great cultivator has descended to earth, but I don’t know why.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be even more surprised.

He suddenly realized that he seemed to know nothing about this world!

As expected, the more he knew, the easier it was for him to realize his ignorance.

This was the current state of Qin Yu.

“If I’m not wrong, your little girlfriend’s people have stepped onto Earth many times, right?”At this moment, the handlebar mustache suddenly said.
