Chapter 2660: Trying

It was like a dream, yet not quite. Reality and dreams kept intertwining.

The luster of the glass became increasingly hazy and magnificent. Qin Yu’s eyelids felt unbearably heavy.

Despite his efforts to resist, he couldn’t fend off the overwhelming drowsiness. His eyelids suddenly closed.

In the next moment, a sense of alarm flooded his mind, jolting him awake. Not far from him, Xin Yue stood, her body unscathed as if untouched by the recent events. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“How is this possible?” Qin Yu’s mind reeled. What had transpired seemed like only a brief moment.

From the moment his eyelids shut to when they opened again, everything had changed so drastically.

Soaring Wind Slash!

Xin Yue’s formidable battle intent surged once more, seizing hold of Qin Yu’s internal qi.

In almost an instant, she appeared before him, delivering a powerful punch.

Ethereal Movement Technique!

Qin Yu instinctively employed the Ethereal Movement Technique.

Yet, despite his efforts, the overwhelming force remained unyielding.

A terrifying power surged into his body, causing Qin Yu to spit out copious amounts of blood uncontrollably.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Amidst the heavy footsteps, Xin Yue’s face contorted with ferocious battle intent.

As her right hand trembled slightly, she once again assumed the starting stance for Soaring Wind Slash.

“Stop! Isn’t this embarrassment enough?” a stern voice reprimanded. Before the combat clone could react, it dissolved like ice in a blazing inferno.

In an instant, it vanished, leaving no trace.

Countless tiny flames flickered in the sky, their glow gradually dimming as they dissipated.

When the flames finally subsided, Qin Yu found himself back in the Dao lecture hall.

Before him stood Xin Yue and Jing Xin, both wearing expressions of mixed emotions.

“I can’t fathom how you managed to comprehend the terrifying Order of the Saint Kingdom. Moreover, your body seems to possess the power of resurrection. If I’m not mistaken, it must be linked to the Heart of the Saint Kingdom. The fusion of these two powers has enabled you to break free from the control of the Order of the Saint Kingdom,” Jing Xin remarked, filled with astonishment.

When the Order of Destruction emerged, even though he wasn’t directly within its power, he felt his consciousness being overwhelmed by the terrifying awareness of the Dusk Saber. One can only imagine how formidable this power was.

“Yes, it was a stroke of luck. At that moment, I relied on this power to comprehend the Order of the Saint Kingdom. It believed I would surely perish, but it didn’t anticipate that I possessed the Heart of the Saint Kingdom and the ability to revive,” Qin Yu nodded.

“This could be considered fate. All powers are meant for my use. Capturing such power already proves your exceptional ability. However, let me remind you, that the consciousness at the pinnacle of the Order of the Saint Kingdom is even more cunning than you realize. While you may seek to probe it, it will also constantly seek to probe you. Such power does not submit to anyone. As long as you remain uncontrolled by it, you must maintain utmost vigilance against it and try to minimize its usage,” Xin Yue said sternly.

Qin Yu was taken aback. He hadn’t anticipated the cunning nature of the Order of the Saint Kingdom. Were it not for Xin Yue’s reminder, he wouldn’t have discerned this aspect of it.

“Since I’ve lost, I will honor my promise.”

“Elder Xin Yue, you haven’t lost. It’s me who lost.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“When I employed the Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly, it signified my defeat. This power transcends that of a mere combat clone. Had I not utilized the strength of my true body, my clone would likely have been obliterated by your saber.” Xin Yue shook her head.

‘Qin Yu, please don’t refuse. Before this great upheaval, everyone had to make their own choices. Otherwise, what purpose do these accumulated merits serve?” Jing Xin nodded in agreement.

Indeed, everything would have proceeded smoothly. However, with the seal of the Ancient Demon Land now shattered, and the uncertain fate of the Demon Sealing Valley post-battle, the urgent task was to exchange these merit points for immediate combat prowess.

“Elder Xin Yue, I have a request. I would like you to demonstrate Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly Technique,” Qin Yu said earnestly.

“Do you wish to master this technique? It’s likely quite difficult. It can only be performed after my Meridian Circulation Technique and Dao of Nature cultivation have reached their peak and merged with nature. The cultivation of the Dao of Nature is extremelv slow, even for those with exceptional talent,’ Xin Yue shook her head.

“Elder Xin Yue, I have my reasons, but I may need you to demonstrate it a few more times. It’s crucial to me,” Qin Yu said earnestly.

He wanted to test the power of his other Heart of Saint Kingdom. The Demon Sealing Valley’s movement technique was sealed within the vessel.

To the Heart of the Saint Kingdom, this power was too weak.

If he sealed this power, it wouldn’t provide much of an improvement in his later battles.

Moreover, after continuously using this movement technique, he had already vaguely grasped its circulation power. Now, he could roughly execute it.

If he could replace the vessel skill with Elder Xin Yue’s Zhuang Zhou’s Dream Butterfly, it would greatly enhance his subsequent battles.

This was nearly a god-level life-saving skill. Its dream-like transformation allowed him to traverse between dreams and reality.

“Alright, but this power consumes a significant amount of soul power. Being able to use it once a day is already the limit,” Xin Yue agreed.

In the following days, Qin Yu would diligently seek out Elder Xin Yue to carefully study the intricacies of this power.

“Sister Jing Xin, what do you think Brother Qin Yu wants to achieve? Could he want to comprehend Master’s technique?” Linger asked with curiosity.

“I’m not certain, but Qin Yu is not an arrogant person. To defeat Master’s battle clone, there must be some deeper intention behind his actions,” Jing Xin shook her head, answering Ling’er’s question with closed eyes.

“Sister Jing Xin, do you think he might receive so many benefits from Master and still betray Master?” Ling’er queried again.

Jing Xin’s eyebrows twitched imperceptibly. After a long pause, she softly replied, “In this world, the human heart is the hardest to fathom. If even Master, who cultivates the Dao of Nature, is mistaken, then we can only attribute it to fate…”

After failing eight times in a row, Qin Yu’s expression turned somewhat bitter..
