Chapter 1395: Chapter 1,395, Information Leak? 1

Looking at the silver waterfall in the sky, Qin Yu was so excited that he almost jumped up!

With so much water of life, recovering spiritual energy was not a problem at all!

Qin Yu could even rely on the water of life to constantly absorb the twilight energy and continuously improve his physical body! He could really let his physical body enter the return to void stage!

Qin Yu sniffed hard, but he found that the aura just now had disappeared.

“En?”Qin Yu frowned slightly. He looked at brother Dao and said, “Brother Dao, why is there no aura in this water of life?”

Brother Dao glanced at Qin Yu and said with slight ridicule, “Do you think that waterfall is the water of life? Are you not awake yet, or is your brain not good? If the water of life is like this, then you and I still have a share?”

Qin Yu was stunned and said awkwardly, “So this is not the water of life...”

“Nonsense!”Brother Dao snorted.

He pointed at the waterfall and said, “If you want to get the water of life, you have to go through this waterfall and enter the karst cave behind the waterfall.”

“But let me tell you, this waterfall came from somewhere. Every drop of water is like a knife cutting. Without a protective dharma artifact, your body will be torn apart in an instant.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “My body should be fine.”

Brother Dao didn’t say anything. He spread out his palm, and a ray of light exploded from his palm.

This ray of light was like a barrier, wrapping the two of them up.

“Let’s go. Let’s go in and hug my waist,”said Brother Dao.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. He stretched out his hand and tightly wrapped it around Brother Dao’s waist. His face was attached to Brother Dao’s back.

Brother Dao’s figure flashed, and he shot towards the waterfall.

This sound, which was already like thunder, grew louder as the two of them approached. It could be said to be deafening.

Even Qin Yu felt his head buzzing.

When their bodies sank into the waterfall, the layer of barrier outside immediately emitted a crackling sound, as if it was about to be torn apart.

“Not good!”

At this moment, Brother Dao suddenly cried out in alarm. Immediately after, the magic artifact in his palm exploded! The barrier outside also disappeared in an instant!

The blade-like water current was approaching the two people’s bodies!

“Brother Dao!”Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent. He hurriedly spread out his body, wanting to protect Brother Dao beneath him.

Although Qin Yu’s speed was very fast, he was still a step too late. The water current fell on Brother Dao’s chest, instantly pulling out a large hole in his chest!

Qin Yu grabbed Brother Dao as if he was in his arms and used all his strength to protect him under his body.

Then, he relied on his surging divine power to quickly pass through the waterfall.

Even though Qin Yu used all his strength to protect Brother Dao under his body, his body was limited after all. A large number of wounds still appeared on Brother Dao’s body.

Fresh blood flowed out, looking extremely miserable.

“Brother Dao, are you alright?”Qin Yu asked hurriedly.

Brother Dao stood up and looked at the wounds all over his body. His brows were tightly knitted together. In some places, even his bones were injured.

He looked at Qin Yu subconsciously and said with a faint smile, “No wonder you were able to kill Ling Yun. Your body is really terrifying.”

There weren’t any wounds on Qin Yu’s body. There were only white marks left.

“Let’s go. The water of life is just ahead.”Brother Dao stood up from the ground.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “Is the water of life just ahead?”

“Thirty stars ahead,”Brother Dao said.

Qin Yu raised her head to look at the huge karst cave, only to see that water droplets were constantly falling down from the karst cave.

This karst cave seemed to have been around for some time. Countless sharp stones were falling down and embedded into the ground.

The entire cave shone with a strange radiance, making the entire cave look quite beautiful.

It would take at least half a day for two people to walk at the speed of thirty stars.

In addition, Brother Dao’s body was injured, so his speed was also restricted.

However, Qin Yu was not in a hurry. Since they had already arrived, the water of life would be in their hands sooner or later. There was no hurry.

At this moment, boss Zheng had arrived at the Tianyun sect.

He was carrying the goods and was standing in the warehouse to hand them over.

“Boss Zheng, why are you here today?”Someone joked.

Boss Zheng said perfunctorily, “I just came out for a walk.”

After handing over the goods, boss Zheng walked straight to the great elder’s cultivation room.

Coincidentally, the Great Elder was preaching to Di Zun. When he saw boss Zheng walk in, the great elder could not help but frown.

“Why are you here?”The great elder stood up and asked.

Boss Zheng waved at the great elder and said, “I have something to tell you.”

As he spoke, he deliberately glanced at Di Zun.

The great elder waved his hand and said, “It doesn’t matter. He is not an outsider. Just say what you want to say.”

Seeing this, boss Zheng told the great elder about Qin Yu’s transformation.

After the great elder heard it, his expression changed and he hurriedly pulled boss Zheng out. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Didn’t you say that he wasn’t an outsider?”Boss Zheng frowned.

The great elder said coldly, “When it comes to Qin Yu, you must not let him know.”

Then, the great elder returned to the main topic, “How did you know?”

Boss Zheng stammered, “I... I went to Gu City and accidentally found out.”

“Accidentally found out?”The great elder narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Is it related to sister Lin from the auction?”
