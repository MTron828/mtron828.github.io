2311 The Strongest Defense

The enormous body supported by the cosmic form suddenly held on against the giant shield, and he unleashed his enormous divine sense without reservation.

The terrifying power of divine sense transformed into a hard shield, and hundreds of giant hard shields appeared before him.

Almost as soon as he did that, the corpse’s palm had already landed.

The palm containing the power of heaven and earth suddenly slapped in front of Qin Yu.

In an instant, a brilliant light as bright as the stars burst forth from the corpse’s palm. The dazzling and radiant light made it impossible to keep one’s eyes open.

There seemed to be a faint trace of heavenly might within that qi energy!

This was the unique dignity of a Tribulation Transcending cultivator. In other words, this corpse must have been a Tribulation Transcending cultivator when he was alive.

At this moment, the Path of Heaven suppressed him, so he could only unleash a trace of heavenly might.

“This corpse can actually cast technique? What is going on? We have been on this battlefield for nearly 10,000 years but have never seen this corpse move. Could it be that it has been tainted by the internal qi of the demon race’s great emperor and has developed a new consciousness?”

Gu Baiyi said with a frown.

“Moreover, the consciousness level of this living being is definitely not low. Its technique contains heavenly might! We don’t even dare to use techniques that exceed the power of True Saint. What’s going on?”

Yan Minglong slapped his thigh, his face filled with shock.

However, almost to all cultivators, this was already suppressing the cultivation realm.

The hundreds of giant shields formed by Qin Yu’s Spiritualization Technique shattered one by one. In just a few breaths, all the giant shields formed by divine sense collapsed.

However, they had also withstood the sharpness of this technique! Qin Yu’s divine sense had already reached a tremendously terrifying realm.

The power of the giant shields formed by the Spiritualization Technique had increased hundreds and thousands of times.

However, it was far from enough against a technique containing heavenly might.

As for Suo Lin’s shield in Qin Yu’s hand, it seemed to have sensed danger.

The ancient and bright light on the giant shield kept flashing. This divine artifact that had fused with Wu Ji’s divine robe, the Venerable Fifth Mountain, and various top-grade materials suddenly erupted with the strongest defense since its emergence.

Qin Yu did not even use his chaotic power. All the chaotic qi in his body was instantly drawn into Suo Lin’s shield.

“Senior Wu Ji!”

Wu Ji’s hands unleashed the dao technique and suddenly pushed it horizontally with both his hands.

Immediately after, another word emerged from the shield. It was the word “summit”.

As soon as the word “summit” appeared, it transformed into a mountain peak that carried the weight of the rivers and mountains. Even from tens of thousands of miles away, one could feel the weight of the mountain peak.

“Boom!”

Countless lightning bolts instantly exploded at the point where the two sides met. The dao technique’ visions that were transformed by “Ji” and “summit” intertwined with the technique.

The earth-shattering force swept through the space of several thousand meters. In just an instant, space shattered and reformed countless times.

After a long time, the power finally dissipated.

The power of the aftershock transmitted to Qin Yu’s body, and his Saintly Body Technique instantly shattered.

Even though it was just the aftershock, it almost killed him.

And that corpse also seemed unable to withstand the terrifying backlash and directly turned into countless pieces.

“F*ck, he withstood it?”

Jiang Qingyuan patted Yan Minglong’s thigh with an expression of bewilderment and unease.

“D*mn it, let me pinch you to see if you’re dreaming.”

Yan Minglong immediately pinched Jiang Qingyuan’s thigh.

“This kid seemed to have unimaginable cosmic luck! He seemed to have a supreme treasure with him, and his divine sense was far superior to that of an ordinary ninth-grade True Saint!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Gu Baiyi also stood up.

No one expected Qin Yu to withstand such a terrifying attack. The three could not help but stand up and carefully observe Qin Yu on the battlefield.

Qin Yu’s legs were broken, and he frantically absorbed the medicinal qi in the Sumeru ring to restore his body.

“Please, don’t let another strange creature come. May Buddha bless, may Jesus bless, may Grand Ancestor bless…”

Qin Yu was extremely nervous at this moment. Any strange thing that appeared at this time could take his life.

A few dozen breaths of time seemed to have passed by like a few years. Qin Yu could clearly hear the sound of his own breathing.

“Tap!”

A light footstep sounded from his back.

Qin Yu’s body stiffened, and he turned his head in disbelief.

Yan Ruoxue dressed in white, stood before him with a smile.

“Qin Yu, I’m here.”

She hugged Qin Yu, and a strange smile appeared on the corners of her lips.

“Qin Yu, I miss you so much. The combined pressure from the Yan family and the Si family is too great. They want me to marry Si Shiyue. I’m so tired, Qin Yu.”

Yan Ruoxue whispered into his ear.

“I’m so lonely. Uncle Yan has been sent to prison, and I don’t have anyone to talk to. Everyone in the Yan family thinks I’m an anomaly who never thinks for the family.

“Qin Yu, I can’t even commit suicide now. Perhaps I was wrong from the beginning.

“Qin Yu, I seem to be drifting further and further away from you.

“Qin Yu, please give up on me, okay?”

That poignant and beautiful face rubbed gently against Qin Yu’s face, but her gentle voice broke Qin Yu’s heart.

Although he knew this Yan Ruoxue was a fake, what she said was the truth.

Ruoxue was truly tired!

On Earth, in Nanzhou and Zongzhou, he had done his best.

However, with the power of Path of Heaven, he was completely powerless against the two elders of the Ni family. Yan Ruoxue was forced to self-behead twice and used the Destiny Reincarnation Technique.

What “Yan Ruoxue’” said was right. The gap between them was continuously widening.

His pursuit and his promise were especially laughable.

There were things in this world that could not be accomplished with just hard work or determination.

“Hahaha!”

Qin Yu laughed maniacally as tears flowed uncontrollably.

His existence would only bring more and more pain to the person in his heart.

“What’s wrong with this kid? Was his divine sense severely injured just now? Why did he suddenly go crazy?”

Jiang Qingyuan frowned and said.

“It doesn’t seem like it. He should only be severely injured physically. Could it be that his inner demon has erupted?” Yan Minglong was also puzzled.

In their line of sight, they did not Yan Ruoxue at all. They only saw Qin Yu venting his emotions crazily.

Gu Baiyi frowned. Her expression changed slightly.

Her hands formed a hand seal, and she touched her eyes. Instantly, a hint of gray light shot out from her gaze.

The mist before her was gradually dispelled by the light, and the true appearance slowly revealed.

Gu Baiyi stood up in her fluttering long dress and took a few steps forward.
