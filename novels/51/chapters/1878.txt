1879 Si Shiyu Taking Action!

All the Golden Light condensed on Qin Yu’s right arm, making him look remarkably dazzling!

The terrifying power that emerged from his body made everyone’s expression change drastically!

Even the people from the aristocratic families on the stage widened their eyes in shock!

“What terrifying power!” someone exclaimed.

Even the Si family’s elder couldn’t help but squint his eyes and say, “As expected of someone with the same physique as my family’s young master. Not bad.”

“Haha! If there’s a chance, bring him into our family. Maybe we can cultivate a second Si Shiyue!” the people from the other aristocratic families said.

Many aristocratic families had the same thought. The strength that Qin Yu had displayed was indeed full of temptation!

However, Nangong, in the middle of the battlefield, did not have the luxury to do so.

His spear had been forcefully broken by Qin Yu. The power surging out from Qin Yu at this moment terrified him even more!

“D*mn it!”

Nangong cursed in his heart. This competition didn’t allow escape. Otherwise, he would have turned around and run away!

However, if he allowed this power to pour down on him, he would be severely injured even if he didn’t die!

Nangong gritted his teeth when he saw Qin Yu’s punch coming.

“I admit defeat!” he suddenly shouted.

As soon as he said that, there was an uproar at the scene!

Admitting defeat? This Nangong was so scared that he admitted defeat?

This had never happened before in the previous competitions!

It was indeed embarrassing to admit defeat after being frightened by the upcoming move.

However, Nangong couldn’t care less. Survival was the most important thing.

After hearing Nangong’s voice, the golden light on Qin Yu’s right arm slowly dissipated.

He looked in Nangong’s direction, grinned, and said, “You’re admitting defeat just like that?”

“Hmph!” Nangong snorted coldly and said, “You’re worthy of having the chaotic body. You do have some skills. But if it’s a life-and-death battle, you might not be able to defeat me.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Don’t brag. If it was a life-and-death battle, you would have died long ago.”

Now that he had lost, Nangong knew he could not say anything. If he continued, he would only be laughed at.

Therefore, he just turned around and left the battlefield.

“Tsk! Tsk! It’s over just like that. What a waste,” someone on the stage sighed and said.

“Yeah, I still want to see what kind of power this punch has.”

“Maybe he’s just bragging.”

Qin Yu was too lazy to be bothered by him. He turned around and returned to Jiu Xiao and the others.

“How is it? I didn’t embarrass you, did I?” Qin Yu looked at Jiu Xiao and the peak master and said half-jokingly, half-seriously.

“Not bad!” Jiu Xiao rolled his eyes and said, “You’ve made such a proud person like Nangong admit defeat.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Proud? I don’t think so. If he’s really a proud person, his dao mind will be destroyed once he admits defeat.”

It was indeed true. Many people couldn’t accept defeat and be unable to recover after the setback.

For example, Han Wei in Hingdu back then. He lost the glory of a genius after that battle.

The match that followed was between two unknown kids. Qin Yu didn’t pay much attention to it. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Sitting there, his eyes looking in Si Shiyu’s direction from time to time.

“How is Si Shiyu compared to Nangong?” Qin Yu asked.

“I don’t know. I’ve never fought with Si Shiyu before,” Jiu Xiao said.

“Don’t tell me you don’t even have a chance to meet him?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Jiu Xiao glanced at Qin Yu and said, “He only participated in the last three years. I didn’t meet him three years ago.”

Qin Yu thought to himself, “It seems I’ll have to take a good look at Si Shiyu’s abilities later.”

As he spoke, Zhao Wan Er once again ran over.

She sat next to Qin Yu and said, “Are your injuries alright?”

Qin Yu looked at his body, shook his head, and said, “This is nothing.”

Seeing that Qin Yu was fine, Zhao Wan Er smiled and said, “You actually made Nangong admit defeat. You indeed didn’t let me down.”

“I’m afraid we’ll fight soon,” Qin Yu sighed and said.

“That’s not certain. Maybe you’ll fight against Si Shiyu,” Zhao Wan Er smiled and said.

“That would be the best,” Qin Yu nodded slightly and said.

As long as he won against Si Shiyu, Zhao Wan Er should not be a problem.

Although she was Flower Granny’s personal disciple, she had not cultivated for long and received the true inheritance of Flower Ganny.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu was even more curious about Flower Granny.

Flower Granny had hunched back and looked extremely old. It was impossible to guess her age.

“How old is Flower Granny?” Qin Yu asked Zhao Wan Er.

Zhao Wan Er shook her head and said, “I don’t know either. I only know that Flower Granny is more senior than the dean. People call her the living fossil of Holy Region.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded and didn’t continue.

Looking at her appearance, she was probably a few thousand years old.

As the two conversed, the third battle had ended.

It was Si Shiyu’s turn in the upcoming battle.

Although Si Shiyu had only participated in the competition for three years, he was extremely popular in Thunder Courtyard.

Before he even stepped onto the battlefield, everyone was already looking forward to it.

“Si Shiyu, the number one of the previous batch. I wonder what kind of amazing performance he’ll have this time.”

“That’s right. Whoever encounters Si Shiyu is unlucky.”

The crowd was abuzz with discussion, and Qin Yu could not help but look at Si Shiyu.

In his heart, he was looking forward to fighting with Si Shiyu.

Although this young man’s status in the Si family wasn’t low, he was definitely not as good as Si Shiyue.

If he couldn’t even defeat Si Shiyu, probably he couldn’t fight back when he encountered Si Shiyue one day.

Soon, Si Shiyu appeared on the battlefield.

His opponent also quickly walked over.

The opponent bowed slightly to Si Shiyu and said very politely, “Brother Si, please show mercy.”

Si Shiyu looked at him coldly without saying a word.

In the following second, the young man did not say anything else and activated a technique directed toward Si Shiyu!

The technique obviously originated from Thunder Courtyard. His every move was accompanied by the faint movement of thunder in his palms!

The sky also changed at this moment, and countless bolts of lightning gathered on his body!

This young man actually directly drew upon the power of lightning!

“I’m sorry to offend you!”

With a furious roar, thousands of lightning bolts shot toward Si Shiyu!

A look of contempt flashed across Chu Shiyu’s eyes. He sneered and suddenly reached out his palm!

A terrifying internal qi instantly gushed out from his palm!

All the power of lightning disappeared in an instant!

As for the young man with the lightning, he was sent flying, fell to the ground, and never stood up again!

It was a victory with a strike!

The scene fell deadly silent as if no one had expected such an outcome!
