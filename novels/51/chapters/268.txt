Chapter 269: The Formation of the Earth Fiend Valley Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

A terrifying internal qi spread out in an instant!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu clenched his golden fist and smashed it towards the so-called Heaven Gate with a crushing force!

Under this punch, the Heaven Gate seemed to have suffered a heavy blow! Countless cracks spread out like ripples of water!

Following that, the entire barrier was shattered by Qin Yu’s punch!

The stone tablet at the side also exploded in an instant!

“What b*llshit Heaven Gate? It’s just a man-made formation,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Tang Ling and Cheng Cai were dumbstruck as they watched from the side.

The Heaven Gate was actually shattered by Qin Yu’s punch?

“You... How dare you?!” The two guards shouted with some fear.

Then, they looked at Cheng Cai and Tang Ling and scolded, “Get out. The ancient tower doesn’t welcome you guys!”

Cheng Cai’s expression changed and he hurriedly said, “This has nothing to do with us. We don’t even know each other!”

The guard said coldly, “Cut the crap! How dare you barge into the Heaven Gate? This is a great disrespect to the heavens! Get lost!”

Cheng Cai was instantly enraged. He glared at Qin Yu and berated, “It’s all your fault! Now we can’t enter! How can you be so selfish?!”

Qin Yu ignored Cheng Cai. He strode towards the stone stairs.

Although the two guards were afraid, they still braced themselves and walked forward.

“I said, you... You can’t go in!” One of the guards said.

Qin Yu looked at him coldly and said, “Get lost.”

After meeting Qin Yu’s eyes, the guard immediately felt a strong sense of danger!

But even so, he still didn’t move his body.

Qin Yu didn’t have time to waste with him. He immediately waved his hand and smashed the guard’s head.

“Ah!!” Tang Ling couldn’t help but scream out of fear.

Cheng Cai, who was at the side, was also pale and nervous.

He killed a person just like that? Who was Qin Yu?

Qin Yu and Jiang Gu strode toward the stone stairs.

The two of them were extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, they had reached the top of the mountain.

“Are we still going?” Tang Ling asked cautiously.

Cheng Cai gritted his teeth and said, “It’s not easy to come here. We can’t let go of this opportunity!”

Thus, Cheng Cai braced himself and followed.

...

On the mountain top, there were two old men sitting cross-legged.

They were dressed like sages. At a glance, they looked like deities.

In front of them stood many young men and women.

Some were asking for medicine, while others were making wishes.

Qin Yu pushed aside the crowd and walked in front of the two people.

“Go and queue up,” the old man said without even lifting his head.

The people in line behind him also scolded, “Hurry up and queue up. Don’t you have any manners?!”

Qin Yu ignored them. He reached out with his big hand and pinched the old man’s head before forcefully lifting him up!

His actions immediately made the old man furious!

He immediately activated a spell, and rays of pitch-black light burst out from his chest before coming straight for Qin Yu’s face.

“Clang!”

But when the light touched Qin Yu’s body, it shattered!

The old man’s expression suddenly changed! He tried to struggle, but found that Qin Yu was very powerful, and he couldn’t break free at all!

“You... What do you want to do?!” The old man was shocked and angry.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Take me to the Earth Fiend Valley.”

When he heard the words ‘Earth Fiend Valley’, the old man’s expression became even uglier!

“Who exactly are you?!” The old man said vigilantly.

Qin Yu didn’t answer this question, but repeated, “Take me to the Earth Fiend Valley, or I will crush your head.”

As he spoke, the strength in Qin Yu’s hand increased by a few degrees!

The old man instantly felt as if his head was about to be torn apart. The intense pain made his vision go black. Fear made his entire body tremble.

“Don’t... Don’t kill me... I’ll take you there. I’ll take you there!” The old man said in fear.

Qin Yu snorted. He released his fingers and the old man fell to the ground.

He got up from the ground and patted the soil on his body. He said in a sly tone, “Sir, please follow me...”

His sudden change made the tourists dumbfounded.

What was going on? What was the Earth Fiend Valley?

The old man led Qin Yu and Jiang Gu to the back of the mountain.

Behind the mountain, there was a big canyon.

The terrain here was complicated, and the roads were winding.

The entire canyon was barren, and not even a tree could be seen.

From the sky, the place looked gloomy and desolate!

The Earth Fiend Valley was in the center of this Grand Canyon.

The old man led Qin Yu and Jiang Gu around the Grand Canyon, and in the blink of an eye, they had walked for nearly half an hour.

“How much longer will it take?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

The old man hurriedly said, “We’ll be there soon...”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “You’d better not play any tricks on me. Just take me to the Earth Fiend Valley obediently, and I might spare your life.”

The old man’s expression changed, and his body trembled.

“Yes, yes...” the old man answered repeatedly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Mr. Qin, the Earth Fiend Valley is sinister and vicious. It’s full of shadiness. You must be more careful,” Jiang Gu reminded from the side.

Qin Yu sneered. “If I were afraid, I wouldn’t have come.”

They continued to move forward. The dark energy in their surroundings became denser, and even the mountain rocks showed a faint dark color.

“Six Dark Divine Formation, activate!”

Right at this moment, the old man suddenly shouted!

Following that, the surrounding dark energy gushed out like a spring before attacking from all directions!

And the old man’s body disappeared into this dark energy!

The pitch-black dark energy covered almost half of the valley!

What was more terrifying was that in this dark energy, densely-packed parasites could be seen!

Such a scene filled Jiang Gu with alarm!

He could clearly feel that the inner strength in his body had disappeared without a trace in an instant!

“Mr. Qin, this is bad!” Jiang Gu shouted in alarm.

“You dared to barge into the Earth Fiend Valley? You’re too brazen!” The old man’s voice seemed to come from all directions!

“As long as you step into the Earth Fiend Valley, you will either be exploited by me or die here!”

Qin Yu looked ahead and said coldly, “It seems that you have given up your last chance to live.”

The old man sneered. “Potty-mouthed child, don’t be too arrogant! Here, even the king will die!”

Following the old man’s loud roar, a fierce wind blew in the valley!

These parasites carried terrifying dark energy and attacked Qin Yu and Jiang Gu!

Jiang Gu’s expression changed drastically. He tried to resist, but there were too many parasites and his inner strength was suppressed. Soon, Jiang Gu was pressed to the ground by these parasites!

These parasites tore at Jiang Gu’s body wantonly. Even an Inner Strength Grandmaster wouldn’t be able to withstand a single blow from these parasites!

Qin Yu’s condition wasn’t any better. His entire body was wrapped in dark energy, and tens of thousands of parasites covered his body, preventing him from moving!

“Hehe, these parasites will not only absorb your flesh and blood, but they will also absorb your divine sense!” The old man laughed coldly.

“So what if you guys are Inner Strength Grandmasters? In front of the Six Dark Divine Formation, they aren’t worth mentioning!”

The old man’s crazy laughter echoed in the valley!

Right at this moment, a blue light suddenly burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

The moment the light appeared, these parasites immediately fell from his body with a crackling sound!

The parasites dispersed, and Qin Yu’s body was wrapped in a faint blue flame.

All the parasites didn’t dare to take even half a step forward!
