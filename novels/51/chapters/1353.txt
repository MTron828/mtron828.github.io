Chapter 1354: Chapter 1354, the overbearing Wen wanyi 

Wen wanyi snorted lightly and said, “Don’t worry. I believe he won’t act Rashly.”

Even though he said so, Wen Wanyi’s eyes were fixed in the direction of the sect master.

...

Qin Yu brought Jue Wu all the way to the foot of the mountain.

“I’ll send you here. You can go back by yourself.”Qin Yu said while panting heavily.

Jue Wu jumped down from Qin Yu’s shoulder. She wrinkled her small nose and said in a deep voice, “The people from the Heavenly Cloud sect are here. I Can’t help you. Be careful.”

Qin Yu was stunned. He was too anxious just now and didn’t notice the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Okay, I got it,”Qin Yu nodded and said.

Jue Wu nodded and didn’t say anything more. Then, she turned around and left.

It wasn’t until Jue Wu was far away that Qin Yu looked up at the great Yue Mountain.

“Heavenly Cloud Sect...”Qin Yu took a deep breath and strode up the mountain.

At the top of the mountain.

Many people were surrounding the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, as if they wanted to get acquainted with him.

Even some young people walked over to greet the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect, expressing their admiration for him.

Of course, there were also many people watching coldly. Some people in the crowd had long been dissatisfied with the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at the top of the mountain.

“Qin Yu!”Wen Da hurriedly waved at Qin Yu and then ran over quickly.

“The people from the Heavenly Cloud sect are here,”Wen da said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I know.”

Wen da said seriously, “From now on, Don’t leave my grandfather’s side. Do you understand?”

As he spoke, Wen Wanji also walked over from the side.

He pulled Qin Yu to the table and then put his hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“Don’t worry. I’ll announce to everyone that I’ll take you as my disciple in a while,”Wen Wanji said with an overbearing expression.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. His gaze would occasionally look at the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect not far away.

“Where’s Aunt Jue Wu?”At this moment, Wen Da looked at Qin Yu’s side.

“She’s back at Mount Hua Ning. She said that she’s about to break through and is going into seclusion,”Qin Yu said.

Wen Da couldn’t help but curse, “Damn it, she’s actually going into seclusion at this time.”

“That’s right, that’s right. She can’t be afraid of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, right?”Wen Er also said.

Wen Wanli glared at them and said, “Don’t talk nonsense. I’ve never seen absolute dance afraid of anyone.”

As he said this, someone suddenly walked over to this table.

This person was a deacon of the Heavenly Cloud sect and had an extremely high position in the Heavenly Cloud sect.

He walked all the way to Qin Yu and said expressionlessly, “Which one is Qin Yu?”

Hearing this, Wen wanji immediately said coldly, “Are you blind? Don’t F * cking ask even though you know the answer.”

Although the deacon was a little unhappy, he still didn’t say anything.

He looked at Qin Yu and said, “Our sect master invites you over.”

Qin Yu grunted and was about to get up when Wen Wanji grabbed Qin Yu and shook his head, “Don’t go.”

The Deacon said with a dark face, “Wen Wanji, what do you mean?”

Wen Wanji slammed the table and stood up. He said coldly, “How dare you talk to me like that? You are just a dog of the Tianyun sect. Do You Want to die? If you dare to compete again, I will slap you to death. Do you believe me?”

“You!”The deacon opened his mouth. He wanted to refute, but when he met Wen Wanji’s fierce gaze, he swallowed the rest of his words.

Wen Wanyi was too lazy to talk nonsense with him. He pulled Qin Yu and said, “Follow me.”

“AH? Where to?”Qin Yu was stunned.

Wen wanyi ignored him. He pulled Qin Yu and walked to the front.

“There’s a good show to watch.”Seeing this scene, the corners of the mouths of the surrounding people curled up into a smile.

“Wen Wanyi is famous for his hot temper. He will definitely not give in to anyone.”

“That’s right. There aren’t many people from the Heavenly Cloud sect today. If the two sides fight, it’s hard to say who will win.”

As he spoke, Wen Wanji pulled Qin Yu to the front.

This was a high platform made of jade. Standing here, almost everyone could see it.

Wen Wanji pulled Qin Yu. His gaze swept down and then cleared his throat. A wave of energy rolled in his chest. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In the next second, Wen Wanji said coldly, “Today is the ten thousand sect gathering that comes once every ten years. I, Wen Wanji, will also take this opportunity to announce a piece of good news and share the joy with everyone.”

His voice was like a loud bell, like a tiger roaring through the mountains and forests. It shook the entire great Yue Mountain and caused it to buzz.

Everyone looked at Wen Wanji, including the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“Just a few days ago, I, Wen Wanji, took in a disciple. That person is none other than Qin Yu, who is by my side!”Wen wanji shouted.

When he said this, the expressions of the people around him changed slightly.

Everyone knew that Qin Yu was the enemy of the Heavenly Cloud sect, but this Wen Wanji announced in front of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect that he had taken in Qin Yu as a disciple? Wasn’t this deliberately slapping the face of the Heavenly Cloud Sect?

Even if this Wen Wenti wanted to protect Qin Yu, he shouldn’t have slapped the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s face in front of so many people, right?

Could it be that Wen Wenti really wanted to shed all pretense of cordiality with the Heavenly Cloud Sect?

But they never expected that Wen Wenti’s next words would make people even more shocked.
