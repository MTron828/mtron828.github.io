Chapter 778: The Panicked Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This was Luo Yang’s territory.

And the strength of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets was clearly much stronger than he had imagined.

Qin Yu looked coldly at Luo Yang and said, “We are here to buy things, but you want to rob us by force. Who would dare to come to the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets in the future?”

Luo Yang sneered and said, “Qin Yu, don’t tell me you think that the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets relies on buying things to earn money? Could it be that the Divine Alchemist Pavilion relies on selling medicine to earn money?”

“Gee, Young Master Luo, I was wrong about that gourd. It’s a fake. I threw it away a long time ago.” The man with the mustache quickly jumped out to smooth things over.

Luo Yang sneered and said, “Do you take me for a fool? Cut the crap. Hand over the thing and I’ll spare your lives!”

The surrounding people quickly surrounded him. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In order to please Luo Yang, many people shouted one after another, “Young Master Luo, do you need our help?”

At a glance, dozens of people from the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets were standing by Luo Yang’s side.

Luo Yang became even more proud.

He said indifferently, “Qin Yu, as long as I say the word, I can let you die here!”

“Qin Yu?” When they heard this name, the expressions of the people around changed.

Some people even retreated one after another.

Qin Yu looked at Luo Yang coldly and said, “Calling you Young Master Luo is a show of respect. If I don’t do so, you’re nothing.”

“Qin Yu, this is the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets!” The man with the mustache suddenly became anxious and gently pulled Qin Yu.

Qin Yu ignored him. He looked at Luo Yang coldly and said, “Luo Yang, I’ll give you one last piece of advice. I’m here to buy things, not to find trouble.”

Luo Yang said with a cold look, “You’ve already angered me. Qin Yu, I’m afraid this matter will be difficult to settle today.”

After saying this, Luo Yang took a step back.

More than ten people immediately strode towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s expression became colder and colder, and the internal qi on his body also erupted.

“Do it!” Luo Yang shouted.

As soon as he gave the order, someone immediately took the lead and rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu waved his hand, and golden light rose in all directions. He sent him flying with a slap!

When the others saw this, their expressions changed drastically!

He sent a middle-stage Martial Marquis flying with a slap. What kind of strength was this?

“Attack! Attack together!” Luo Yang shouted in exasperation.

These ten over people gritted their teeth and then rushed towards Qin Yu with large strides.

In an instant, spells rose in all directions, and light burst forth!

Countless spells rushed towards Qin Yu! They held the weapons gifted by the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets and were approaching Qin Yu’s vital point!

Qin Yu wasn’t afraid at all. His moves were big, and his undefeatable stance was terrifying!

His moves were simple and neat. He relied on his incomparably fierce fist.

And this fist contained an undefeatable might. With each punch, one person died!

Qin Yu fought against ten people alone. He wasn’t at a disadvantage at all. His steel-like body forced back several people!

“Boom!”

An Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist smashed out and directly shattered a person’s body!

In just half an hour, these ten people all fell to the ground. Some were dead, while some were injured. Almost no one could stop Qin Yu’s footsteps!

The surrounding people were dumbstruck. They had only heard about Qin Yu’s strength. After seeing it with their own eyes today, they were greatly shocked!

Luo Yang’s face was filled with exasperation. He said angrily, “A bunch of trash! A bunch of trash!”

After saying that, he glared at Qin Yu and shouted, “Qin Yu, don’t be arrogant. If my father didn’t have something else to attend to, he wouldn’t let you be so arrogant!”

Qin Yu glanced at Luo Yang coldly, and suddenly slapped Luo Yang’s face!

Luo Yang’s strength wasn’t weak, but compared to Qin Yu, he was dwarfed!

Qin Yu’s slap caused Luo Yang’s head to buzz, and he started to see stars.

“You... you dare to hit me?!” Luo Yang immediately flew into a rage!

Qin Yu said coldly, “You uneducated thing, today, I will teach you a lesson for free on behalf of your father!”

After saying that, Qin Yu slapped Luo Yang’s face again.

This slap was full of force, and it sent Luo Yang flying.

The surrounding people didn’t dare to make a sound.

“Qin Yu, you... You’re finished!” Luo Yang said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with Luo Yang anymore.

He walked straight to an iron platform and examined it carefully.

There were many magic artifacts and weapons placed on this iron platform, and they all looked extremely exquisite.

Some of the spiritual artifacts seemed rusty, but one could still feel that they were extraordinary.

Qin Yu casually picked up a Spatial Magic Artifact that looked like a ring and put it on his finger.

“I originally planned to buy a Spatial Magic Artifact, but your attitude made me very unhappy. This Spatial Magic Artifact will be taken as an apology from the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Luo Yang was flustered and exasperated, but there was nothing he could do.

“Qin Yu, you’re finished!” Luo Yang could only sit on the ground and fly into a rage.

After Qin Yu took the Spatial Magic Artifact, he turned around and left the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

Only after he walked out of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets’ door did the man with the mustache mutter, “To come to the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets to snatch something, you’re really aggressive.”

Qin Yu snorted coldly. “Doesn’t he have to pay the price for attacking me? This Spatial Magic Artifact is the price.”

After saying this, Qin Yu returned to the Martial Arts Academy with the man with the mustache.

Then, Qin Yu put the power of creation, coffin, and other items into the Spatial Magic Artifact.

“This picture will probably be targeted,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The video of the battle with Blackie that day had long been leaked out. There must be someone who knew the value of it.

And a person who could recognize this item must be very powerful.

“This is also good. I was just worried about not getting a Golden Core,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

According to the time, they should set off tomorrow.

Qin Yu and the man with the mustache rushed to the airport that night.

On the other side, in the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets.

In the evening, as soon as the Pavilion Master of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets, Luo Jingyu, returned to the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets, Luo Yang ran over crying.

“Dad, someone broke into the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets and injured our people! I also got two slaps on my face!” Luo Yang pointed at his own face and said with a face full of grief and indignation.

Luo Jingyu glanced at Luo Yang and said, “What did you do this time?”

“It’s not me who caused trouble! It’s Qin Yu who is arrogant and conceited! He doesn’t take the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets seriously! He even wants to steal our things!” Luo Yang said angrily.

Luo Jingyu obviously didn’t believe it at all. He poured a cup of tea and said indifferently, “If you don’t tell the truth, I won’t intervene.”

Luo Yang had no choice but to bite the bullet and tell him the whole story.

After Luo Jingyu heard it, he couldn’t help but snort. “You don’t have much ability, yet you still want to rob others? You deserve it!”

“Dad, you can’t blame me for this. With Qin Yu’s strength, even Yan Jinyao might not be his match, let alone me...” Luo Yang muttered in a low voice.

Luo Jingyu glanced at Luo Yang and changed the topic while snorting coldly. “He came to the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets to fight. Isn’t he looking down on me?”

“Yes, yes, yes! And Qin Yu also snatched a Spatial Magic Artifact from our iron platform!” Luo Yang hurriedly said.

Luo Jingyu’s expression immediately changed!

He hurriedly looked at Luo Yang and said, “Which Spatial Magic Artifact?”

“It’s the ring that was placed in the iron platform...” Luo Yang whispered.

“You... you said he took that ring?!” Luo Jingyu instantly looked as if he had lost his parents, and his face was extremely pale!
