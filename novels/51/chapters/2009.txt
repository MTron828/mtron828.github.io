2010 The Relationship Between the Demonic Egg and Xiao Yu

The strange death made the several black-robed men feel uneasy.

Qin Yu frowned as well. He was also unsure of the method Xiao Yu had used to take his life!

“This woman is strange. Everyone be careful!” a black-robed man hurriedly shouted.

At this moment, Xiao Yu attacked again.

Densely packed black chains emerged from her body, each carrying a sinister and icy aura. They were incredibly terrifying.

The black-robed men’s faces instantly turned solemn. They mobilized their internal qis and were ready to counterattack at any time.

“Rattle!”

The chains moved, making a terrifying rattling sound!

This sound seemed to come from the depths of hell. It was tremendously terrifying and caused people to fear from the bottom of their hearts!

“Swoosh!”

Soon, these chains shot toward them!

Each chain was incredibly fast. Although it did not seem to have any special internal qi, it made people shudder!

The black-robed men naturally did not dare to be negligent. They erupted with extremely terrifying internal qi and extended their palms simultaneously to receive the chain!

However, something terrifying happened. The chains pierced through their palms and followed by their arms!

The sound of bones crushing was heard endlessly!

Their arms were pierced into pieces!

However, this was not the end yet. The chains pierced through their arms and headed straight for their heads!

These black-robed men naturally would not sit still and wait for death. They immediately took out their treasures to protect their heads.

However, these chains were made of unknown materials. It seemed that nothing could stop them. The moment the magical artifact came into contact with them, it shattered!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The chains pierced through their heads as expected, and their heads exploded!

At the end of the chain, there was a trace of light.

If one looked closely, one would know this light was a primordial spirit!

Not only did Xiao Yu take their lives, but she also took their souls!

Qin Yu’s expression was tremendously ugly. Even though the woman opposite him was an old friend, Qin Yu was still scared.

Xiao Yu had become so scary now. He could not feel any warmth from her. She was like a cold and ruthless killing machine. No one could stop her! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“You … Don’t come over, or I’ll kill him!” The black-robed man who had captured Qin Yu panicked. He did not expect Xiao Yu’s strength to be so terrifying that they could not retaliate at all!

The black-robed man used Qin Yu to block in front of him and said in a trembling voice, “If you dare to come over, I will kill this kid. I guarantee…”

“Pfft!”

However, before he could finish speaking, the chain had already pierced Qin Yu’s chest and entered the black-robed man’s body!

Fresh blood flowed down his chest. Qin Yu bent down to look at his body that had been pierced through. For a moment, he could not believe it.

Xiao Yu had actually hurt him! He remembered what the man with the mustache had said back then!

Once Xiao Yu grew up, she would definitely disown all her relatives and friends and bring disaster to the world!

“Swoosh!”

The chains crushed the black-robed man’s body into pieces and mercilessly dragged out his primordial spirit.

The chain slowly pulled out, but it stopped when it reached Qin Yu’s chest.

Qin Yu was nervous, and he looked at Xiao Yu coldly and said, “Do you want to kill me?”

At this moment, Qin Yu calmed down, and the fear in his heart disappeared without a trace.

He stared at Xiao Yu, waiting for her next move.

The chain just stayed for a split second before it finally pulled out from Qin Yu’s chest.

Xiao Yu did not stay and turned to leave.

“What does that demonic egg have to do with you?” Qin Yu shouted.

However, Xiao Yu did not respond. As she walked further away, the dark clouds in the sky dissipated.

“If you don’t tell me, I’ll destroy that demonic egg immediately!” Qin Yu roared.

Xiao Yu finally stopped in her tracks.

She turned around and looked at Qin Yu.

Through the mask, Qin Yu could see her cold eyes.

The once innocent gaze was gone, replaced by endless coldness.

Just this gaze alone, probably not many people could withstand it.

However, Qin Yu was not afraid at all. He looked straight at Xiao Yu and waited for her answer.

“You wouldn’t do that.”

After a long time, a cold voice finally came out of Xiao Yu’s mouth.

After saying this, Xiao Yu ignored Qin Yu and turned to leave.

Her steps were extremely weird. Unlike other people’s techniques, her feet did not rely on stepping on the main road when walking. On the contrary, every step she took was very messy.

...

Her body would disappear into the darkness at times, and at times, she would appear from the void.

In just a few short moments, she disappeared without a trace.

Qin Yu bent down to look at his chest and said in a low voice, “Looks like she still has a trace of humanity.”

Without humanity, Qin Yu would have died long ago.

Qin Yu bandaged his wound and then fell into deep thought.

What realm had Xiao Yu reached? She could actually kill these black-robed men easily?

Even if the strength of those black-robed men was not a match for Yan Yunfan, the difference should not be too big!

However, facing Xiao Yu, they could not even fight back!

Could it be that Xiao Yu had already recovered to her peak?

Qin Yu thought as he walked back.

From their conversation just now, Qin Yu knew it was not that no one coveted the demonic egg. It was just that before they could get close, Xiao Yu had already killed them.

...

Due to this, the demonic egg had been safe and sound.

“If that demonic egg really has something to do with Xiao Yu, then why didn’t she take the demonic egg away and leave it to Jue Wu instead?” Qin Yu could not figure it out.

Qin Yu did not sleep the whole night.

He looked at the demonic egg in Jue Wu’s arms. The demonic egg was incredibly quiet in the dark, just like an ordinary stone.

“When I have the chance, I have to go to Thunder Courtyard and ask,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

In the following few days, Qin Yu did not leave Jue Wu.

After confirming the people from the Yao family would not rush over, Qin Yu put his worries to rest now and planned to go and find a treasure that could conceal Jue Wu’s internal qi.

Before leaving, Qin Yu glanced at the demonic egg in Jue Wu’s hand and reminded her, “If you encounter any trouble, use this demonic egg to block in front of you, understand?”

Jue Wu glared at Qin Yu and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? This egg is my big treasure now. I can’t bear to part with it!”

Qin Yu laughed bitterly. “Don’t worry. Just use this demonic egg to block in front of you. The demonic egg will definitely be safe and sound.”
