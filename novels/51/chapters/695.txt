Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Su Qian immediately fell into silence.

“Forget it if you can’t do it,” Qin Yu stood up and said.

“I also hope that your Hong Yi Sect will never bother me again from now on. We will not interfere with each other’s business.”

After saying this, Qin Yu was about to leave.

However, Su Qian stopped him.

She said in a deep voice, “Okay, I’ll agree to it.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “If you can find Yan Ruoxue, I’ll agree.”

Su Qian smiled and said, “To get Mr. Qin’s recognition, we will do our best.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything else and turned around to leave.

At this moment, Su Qian stopped Qin Yu again.

“What’s the matter? Is there anything else?” Qin Yu asked.

Su Qian smiled faintly and said, “If I’m not wrong, you’re currently worrying about how to deal with Jingdu Martial Arts Association because you can’t find a place to hide, right?”

“Yes,” Qin Yu nodded.

Su Qian continued, “I can give you a suggestion.”

Qin Yu stared at Su Qian, waiting for her to continue.

Su Qian said, “Move the entire sect and go to the Immortal Slaying Sect.”

Qin Yu was stunned.

This was a good idea.

The gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect could not be opened at all. Moreover, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association was also quite afraid of the Immortal Slaying Sect. It was indeed a good place to hide.

However, Qin Yu quickly rejected this idea.

He shook his head and said, “First, the gate of the Immortal Slaying Sect has been closed. I can’t enter.

“Second, the Immortal Slaying Sect is at the bottom of the sea. It’s full of killing intent and danger. I can withstand it, but it doesn’t mean that everyone can.”

Su Qian smiled and said, “It’s precisely because of this that you can take this opportunity to settle down.

“As for how to get in, I might be able to help you think of a way. Of course, that’s after we work together.”

Qin Yu sneered. He ignored Su Qian and turned around to leave.

The next day was the appointment that Qin Yu and the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had agreed on.

In the early morning, Qin Yu called Xia Hang to probe for information.

Xia Hang on the other end said in a deep voice, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s attitude is very firm. They will not let Yan Ruoxue go.”

Qin Yu heard this and sneered, “Okay, then I’ll give them a big gift.”

After saying that, Qin Yu directly hung up the phone.

Although he had guessed earlier that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association wouldn’t agree, he still couldn’t bear the anger in his heart at this moment.

“Then let’s fight to the death,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu turned around and walked toward the basement.

He raised his hand and grabbed the cage in which Qu Xie was locked up and stuffed it into the car.

At the same time, he asked Burly and Robust to escort him personally to prevent Qu Xie from escaping.

“What are you doing!” Qu Xie was terrified.

Qin Yu glanced at Qu Xie and sneered, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association has already given up on you. It’s time for me to fulfill my promise.”

Qu Xie’s expression changed drastically! He said anxiously, “Qin Yu, don’t act rashly. I think we can talk!”

“There’s nothing to talk about,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile as he started the car.

Qu Xie was completely flustered. Facing death, no one was not afraid!

His mind spun crazily as if he was thinking of a countermeasure.

“Qin Yu, I know many secrets of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! If you are willing to let me go, I can tell you everything!” Qu Xie roared crazily!

Hearing this, Qin Yu was somewhat interested.

As the president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association for many years, Qu Xie naturally knew more than Xia Hang.

Therefore, Qin Yu parked his car to the side and said with a smile, “I have to say, your words have moved me.”

Hearing this, Qu Xie immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Then, Qu Xie said, “What do you want to ask? As long as I know, I will tell you everything.”

Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie and said in a deep voice, “Who are the higher-ups behind you? What are their cultivation levels?”

Qu Xie shook his head and said, “I really don’t know. They have existed since I joined.”

“So, they have existed for many years? That is to say, they are not younger than you,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

Qu Xie quickly nodded and said, “That’s right. According to my judgment, these eight higher-ups have not changed for so many years.”

“If we are talking about cultivation, their cultivation is definitely above mine. It is very likely that they have already entered the Martial Saint realm.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association indeed had Martial Saint.

“These people might be from the previous era,” Qu Xie continued.

Qin Yu was silent for a moment before he continued, “Is the Jingdu Martial Arts Association really holding a Martial Saint?”

“That’s right!” Qu Xie did not hide anything!

When Qin Yu heard this, he could not help but sneer. “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association is so powerful, why do you still bow down to Yan Sihai?”

Qu Xie smiled bitterly. “You said it yourself, I’m just a pawn. Moreover, in this era, martial artists have long been forgotten.

“Otherwise, do you think those eight higher-ups are willing to hide in the dark? I don’t think anyone is willing to hide in the dark for decades or even centuries.”

Qin Yu nodded silently.

This was the truth. Martial artists were a small group after all. There might not be a single martial artist among tens of thousands of people.

There was no other reason. It was only because martial artists’ cultivation requirements were higher.

In the current era, there were very few cultivation resources, so they needed to rely on top-notch herbs to cultivate.

And every top-notch herb was expensive. It was not something that ordinary people could afford. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“There’s another issue,” Qin Yu continued.

“I remember that I don’t have any grudges with your Jingdu Martial Arts Association. But why do you want to kill me again and again?” Qin Yu looked coldly at Qu Xie.

When this topic was brought up, Qu Xie couldn’t help but fall into silence.

He thought for a moment and said, “This is also an order from the higher-ups. It is said that... They are afraid you will become a threat to the association.”

“Bullsh*t. At that time, I was just a nobody and didn’t deserve the attention of the higher-ups,” Qin Yu snorted.

Qu Xie nodded and said, “You are right. Not to mention the higher-ups, even I didn’t think highly of you at that time.

“But I don’t know why the higher-ups are extremely cautious when dealing with you. It’s said that you’re a bit like a person from some decades ago.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “A person from some decades ago?”

Qu Xie grunted and said, “I heard that there was a big battle back then. That person killed dozens of Martial Saints from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Killed dozens of Martial Saints?” Qin Yu could not help but suck in a breath of cold air.

Qu Xie said, “Yes, but that’s only a legend. I’ve never seen it with my own eyes.”

Qin Yu did not say a word, but his heart sank into deep thought.

Could it be... that person was Qin Yu’s father?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu quickly looked at Qu Xie and asked anxiously, “How did that person look like? And what did he end up with?”
