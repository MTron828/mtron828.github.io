Chapter 155: Easily Destroyed Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The fierce punches kept landing on Hong Wu’s body. Facing Qin Yu’s attacks, Hong Wu found it hard to bear for a moment!

Not far away, exclamations sounded. They were all shocked by Qin Yu’s speed!

“Did you see that? Hong Wu was beaten back again and again!”

“D*mn, Qin Yu is only an Inner Strength Master Hands. How could he have such strength?!”

“Is Hong Wu going to lose?!”

With a calm expression, Qin Yu punched at Hong Wu aggressively.

“Enough!”

Finally, Hong Wu couldn’t take it anymore.

With an angry roar, his Inner Strength burst out and knocked Qin Yu back several steps! At last, he was able to catch his breath.

Standing not far away, Qin Yu looked at Hong Wu coldly.

Hong Wu gritted his teeth and said, “Why did your strength suddenly improve by leaps and bounds? Were you just pretending?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Hong Wu, do you know that cultivation techniques are equally important as realms?”

Hong Wu was stunned. He didn’t know any cultivation techniques.

Although Hong Wu was indeed a big shot in the provincial capital, he had never come into contact with any top-tier cultivation techniques.

He had figured out all the techniques he knew by himself, and he was just using his Inner Strength to fight.

Qin Yu looked down at the faint golden color around him and said slowly, “This is called the Saintly Body Technique.”

This was the Saintly Body Technique that Qin Yu had just learned, and it was only the lowest-tier cultivation technique in the inheritance.

Even Qin Yu himself didn’t expect that the Saintly Body Technique would be so powerful.

“Saintly Body Technique?” Hong Wu narrowed his eyes as he suddenly thought of something. Then, he laughed and said, “Qin Yu, your Saintly Body Technique can’t last for long, right?”

Everyone was shocked!

Just as Hong Wu said, the Saintly Body Technique couldn’t last for long, and it consumed a lot of spiritual energy!

With Qin Yu’s current cultivation base, he could last for half an hour at most.

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded. “So what? I can beat you in this short amount of time.”

“Hahaha, you’re bluffing! Qin Yu, as long as I can hold on for a while, you’ll be beaten back to your original state!” Hong Wu sneered.

“You’ve consumed a lot of energy just now. How long can you hold on?” Hong Wu narrowed his eyes and said.

The people around him also nodded.

That’s right. Qin Yu had used up more than half of his energy to withstand Hong Wu’s three punches. How long could he last?

However, Qin Yu didn’t panic at all. Instead, the corners of his mouth curled up into a smile.

Qin Yu took out a few pill pills from his pocket and stuffed them into his mouth.

The moment the pills entered his mouth, Qin Yu felt the qi and energy in his body recover to its peak! The spiritual energy in his dantian also became abundant!

“Hong Wu, I’m afraid you don’t know that I’m also an alchemist, an apothecary, and a doctor,” Qin Yu sneered.

Hong Wu’s expression suddenly changed!

Of course, he knew that Qin Yu was an apothecary because he had heard from Zhou Tong that Qin Yu was going to participate in the Chinese Medical Conference.

However, Hong Wu didn’t expect that Qin Yu would be able to refine such a freaky thing!

“Bring it on, Hong Wu. It’s time to end this,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hong Wu gritted his teeth and said coldly, “So what if you have the Saintly Body Technique? I don’t believe that you can defeat me, an Inner Strength Past Master!”

Qin Yu glanced at the time and said in a low voice, “It’s getting late. If I don’t rest now, I might not be able to recover to my peak condition.”

“Hong Wu, let’s decide the winner as soon as possible,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, the faint golden color on Qin Yu’s body slowly disappeared. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Seeing this, Hong Wu was overjoyed!

Was it going to be over so soon?

“Hahaha, Qin Yu, I knew you were bragging! You can’t even last five minutes!” Hong Wu laughed crazily.

“Really?”

However, the next second, Hong Wu’s smile froze.

The faint golden light on Qin Yu’s body condensed in one spot, which was Qin Yu’s fist!

At this moment, Qin Yu’s fist was as scorching as the sun!

“What... What is this?” Hong Wu couldn’t help but show a hint of fear on his face.

He never expected that a veteran Inner Strength Past Master like him would be afraid at this moment!

“This is called the Holy Fist. When cultivated to its peak, it can destroy even the sun and the moon,” Qin Yu said nonchalantly.

“Bullsh * t! You’ve read too many novels. Destroy the sun and moon?!” Hong Wu couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu shook his head. He knew that this was hard to understand, but it was recorded in the inheritance.

“Hong Wu, you’ll definitely die from this punch,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Hahaha, you’re bluffing! I want to see how powerful you are!” Hong Wu took a deep breath and quickly adjusted his internal qi. Then, he looked at Qin Yu with a serious expression.

“Whoosh!”

In the next second, Qin Yu suddenly disappeared and appeared in front of Hong Wu almost instantly!

Then, his fist, which was as bright as the sun and the moon, drew an arc in the air and smashed towards Hong Wu!

Boom!

At this moment, it was as if a bomb had exploded! The ground under Hong Wu’s feet collapsed directly!

The dust obstructed their vision, and everyone was eagerly watching in order to find out the result.

“Hong Wu should be able to withstand it, right?”

“Of course. Hong Wu is a veteran Inner Strength Past Master. He is very well established in Chuzhou.”

“That’s right. Although that Qin Yu is quite strong, he is too young and doesn’t have much experience.”

Everyone had different opinions, but everyone was more optimistic about Hong Wu.

Finally, the dust slowly fell.

A blurry figure came into view.

“Who is it? Is it Hong Wu?”

“No, that doesn’t look like Hong Wu’s figure!”

“It’s Qin Yu! I see him. It’s that young man called Qin Yu!”

Under the dust, Hong Wu’s clothes were torn and his body was covered in wounds.

He fell to the ground with fear written all over his face.

Qin Yu stood coldly in front of Hong Wu.

“You actually didn’t die.” Qin Yu frowned slightly, as if he was dissatisfied with the result.

Hong Wu opened his mouth and said with difficulty, “Spare... spare me. I don’t want to die...”

“Spare you? You should have known the consequences before you tried to kill me,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hong Wu said in anguish, “I... I can give you a Ganoderma... a top-grade Ganoderma...”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. “But I can get it even if I kill you.”

“Don’t kill me... Please...” Hong Wu’s face was full of fear!

Qin Yu looked at Hong Wu, as if he was thinking it over.

“Okay, I’ll spare your life.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Remember to send the Ganoderma to me personally,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Hong Wu immediately nodded with relief, as if he had been pardoned.

Qin Yu didn’t stay any longer. He turned around and left in a taxi.

Once he got into the taxi, Qin Yu couldn’t hold on any longer. He collapsed on the seat and felt that he didn’t even have the strength to move.

“If it weren’t for the side effects of the Saintly Body Technique, how could I have spared you?!” Qin Yu murmured coldly.

He didn’t have the ability to kill Hong Wu just now, so he just took advantage of the situation.
