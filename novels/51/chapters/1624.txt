It was obvious that this brawny man was already used to such a scene.

Wen Wanyi was about to open his mouth when Qin Yu beat him to it. “Hello, I want to ask you about something. Is it convenient?”

“Not convenient.”The Brawny Man rejected Qin Yu without even thinking.

Qin Yu said somewhat awkwardly, “It won’t take much of your time. I’m willing to pay.”

After hearing that he was going to pay, the Brawny man finally stopped what he was doing.

He glanced at Qin Yu, then at Wen Wenzi, and then said, “If you want to ask about people, don’t open your mouth. I don’t know anyone.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Of course not. I just want to ask you, what period is this purple-red volcano in now?”

The Brawny man glanced at the volcano not far away, then pointed at the flames in front of him and said, “It is the period of insurrection, and it is also the time we use it to fuse weapons.”

Hearing this, Wen Wanyi immediately sighed.

He put his hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Kid, it seems that your luck is not good.”

Qin Yu could not help but frown slightly.

He glanced at the containers of the refining workshop, which were all filled with liquid like molten iron.

Even the divine artifact had been melted, let alone Qin Yu’s body?

“How long will the riot last?”Qin Yu asked.

“From a hundred days to hundreds of days,”the Brawny man said in a deep voice.

“So Long?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Qin Yu couldn’t afford to wait for such a long time.

“Forget it. Let’s find another way.”Wen wentu hooked his arm around Qin Yu’s shoulder and turned to leave.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Master, I still want to try.”

“Try my ass!”Wen Wentu cursed.

“The purple-red heavenly fire during the riot period will melt even divine weapons, let alone your body. I’m afraid it will be melted into dregs in an instant,”Wen Wentu muttered.

Qin Yu was still unwilling to accept this.

If he used such a flame to temper his body, the effect would definitely be beyond imagination!

“Wait.”

At this moment, the brawny man behind them suddenly called out to Qin Yu and Wen Wentu.

Only then did Qin Yu remember that he had forgotten to pay.

Therefore, he turned around and said apologetically, “Sorry, I’ll pay you now.”

However, the Brawny man waved his hand and said, “What did you say just now? You want to use this purple-red heaven flame to temper your body?”

Qin Yu was stunned, then nodded and said, “I do have such an idea.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Brawny Man Couldn’t help but laugh and said, “Kid, this is the purple-red heaven flame. It’s used to refine artifacts, not to temper your body!”

“Let alone the purple-red heaven flame during the riot period, even the purple-red heaven flame during the calm period is not something that the body can touch!”

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said, “I know it’s a difficult thing, but I still want to give it a try.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu looked at the Brawny man full of anticipation and said, “Big Brother, can you lend me this purple-red Heavenly Fire?”

The Brawny man lowered his head to look at the dancing flames in his bucket and then sneered, “No, this is too crazy. If anything happens to you, I don’t want to take responsibility.”

Qin Yu hurriedly pleaded, “Big Brother, please. If anything happens to me, I deserve it. It has absolutely nothing to do with you. I can swear it!”

The Brawny man frowned tightly and didn’t say anything for a moment.

Qin Yu continued to plead. Under his pleas, the Brawny Man finally relented.

He looked at the girl next to him and said, “Xiao Cao, take him to the abandoned pond in the backyard.”

The girl called Xiao Cao hurriedly nodded and said in a low voice, “Please follow me.”

Qin Yu was a little puzzled and asked, “Big Brother, what is this abandoned pond?”

The Brawny man pointed at the metal bucket in front of him and said, “The temperature of the heavenly fire we have used up is not enough to melt the divine artifact, so it will be thrown into the abandoned pond. In comparison, the temperature of the heavenly fire in the abandoned pond is much lower.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu was immediately overjoyed and said, “Big Brother, thank you!”

“Don’t be happy too early. Although it is an abandoned heavenly fire, it is not something that a physical body can withstand,”the brawny man said coldly.

“If anything happens to me, I will not be responsible.”

In the end, the brawny man added another sentence.

Qin Yu bowed and said, “Big Brother, don’t worry. Anything that happens has nothing to do with you.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Xiao Cao.

Xiao Cao quickly turned around and led Qin Yu to the backyard.

Along the way, they passed through the workshop. On the way, Qin Yu saw a lot of sharpened tools. These sharpened tools were surrounded by magical artifacts. Each magical artifact seemed to be prepared for the refining of divine weapons.

“Father doesn’t like others to look at him,”Xiao Cao reminded him in a low voice.

Qin Yu quickly retracted his gaze and said apologetically, “I’m sorry.”

He followed Xiao Cao to the backyard. The closer they were to the backyard, the higher the temperature.

A layer of sweat appeared on Xiao Cao’s fair skin. She couldn’t help but reach out to gently wipe it off.

“Damn, it’s too hot. I Can’t take it anymore,”Wen Wanyi couldn’t help but curse.

Qin Yu glanced at Wen wentu and said, “Master, even little grass can take it. Aren’t you afraid of losing face if you complain?”

Hearing this, Wen Wentu muttered in a low voice, “I’m just naturally afraid of the Heat...”

While they were talking, the three of them had already arrived at the disposal pond.

Purple Flames were dancing in the disposal pond. Compared to the flames in the bucket outside, the light in the disposal pond was obviously dimmer.

It was unknown what kind of material was used around the abandoned pond, but it was currently emitting a faint glow.

The material that could withstand the purple-red heaven fire must be extraordinary.

“This is the abandoned pond,”Xiao Cao said.

Qin Yu bowed slightly and said, “Thank you.”

Wen Wan was sweating profusely. Xiao Cao didn’t dare to go near the abandoned pond for fear of being swallowed by the flames.

A few meters away, Qin Yu could feel the heat that was about to melt him.

He took a deep breath, and his body emitted a faint layer of golden light. Then, he walked toward the pool.

The closer he was to the pool, the stronger the heat became. Even Qin Yu could feel the stinging pain on his body.

Outside the door.

The Brawny man put down what he was doing and turned his head to look in Qin Yu’s direction.

He seemed to be very curious as to whether Qin Yu could withstand the flames.

Qin Yu was getting closer and closer to the heavenly fire by the side of the abandoned pond. At this moment, his face was flushed red and all his clothes were burnt, revealing his strong muscles.

“Within five meters, no one can withstand the purple-red heavenly fire.”The burly man stood at the door and looked at Qin Yu. He couldn’t help but say coldly.

Although he said so, there seemed to be some expectation in his eyes.

In so many years in the refining city, no one had been able to withstand the purple-red heaven flame with their body. Even when they were five meters away from the abandoned pool, no one had ever done it
