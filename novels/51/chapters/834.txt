Chapter 835: Portrait of the Guardian

The man with the mustache cleared his throat and said, “Places with strong dark energy are usually battlefields, but what is the most likely place to appear on the battlefields? That is naturally the treasure left behind!”

“As long as there is a treasure, there will definitely be people who will snatch it. This will also result in the resources of dark energy being reduced to a certain extent.”

Qin Yu said somewhat anxiously, “Don’t say such nonsense. Speak simply.”

The man with the mustache glanced at Qin Yu and said mysteriously, “I know of a few large-scale battlefields. Because the dark energy there is too strong, it has been sealed up. No one dares to go there.”

“Where?” Qin Yu hurriedly asked.

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “Don’t think about it. Even Martial Saints can’t go to such a place.”

“It’s said that there was once a Martial Saint who stepped into that place. In the end, the moment he stepped in, he turned into ashes.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp when he heard this.

The little bit of hope that had just risen instantly disappeared.

“Even a Martial Saint turned into ashes in an instant?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Yes.” The man with the mustache nodded.

“Moreover, because those few large battlefields have been sealed, the specific locations have also been lost.”

Qin Yu said dejectedly, “Isn’t that a waste of time...”

The man with the mustache spread his hands and said, “If cultivation is that simple, then it wouldn’t be worth much.”

Speaking of which, the most scarce resource in this era was the spiritual energy.

Most of the resources were controlled by the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. The remaining resources were like the flesh of a fly, extremely few.

“Qin Yu, the real resources are still in the hands of the various aristocratic families.” At this moment, the man with the mustache changed the topic.

“If you’re looking for me, you might as well look for those top aristocratic families. They definitely know more than me.”

Qin Yu grunted. He looked at the man with the mustache and said in a low voice, “In that case, we still have to go to Jingdu.”

“Oh no.” The man with the mustache nodded in praise.

Then, Qin Yu asked, “Where do you plan to go next? With me? Or...”

“I’m not going with you.” The man with the mustache rolled his eyes at Qin Yu.

“You have enemies on all sides. I don’t want to get involved with you.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Seriously, what are your plans?”

“Continue traveling and carry out my archaeological activities,” the man with the mustache said with a smile.

Qin Yu patted the man with the mustache’s shoulder and said, “Don’t forget me if you have any benefits. I only want dark energy, and the rest is yours.”

“Okay.” The man with the mustache didn’t stand on ceremony. He also needed a strong fighter.

After saying goodbye to the man with the mustache, Qin Yu headed straight to Jingdu.

It was already the new year, and the weather was getting colder and colder.

And in Jingdu, there was a rare heavy snowfall.

Qin Yu strolled through the heavy snow while listening to the noisy sounds around him.

The children were having snowball fights and building snowmen, and the adults on the way were cursing and swearing because of traffic jams or rear-end collisions.

For a moment, Qin Yu felt a sense of yearning.

“If I hadn’t stepped onto the path of cultivation, what kind of life would I be living now?” Qin Yu had a sudden realization.

His state of mind had also improved at this moment.

This surprised Qin Yu.

“No wonder those powerhouses would choose to enter the human realm when they encounter a bottleneck,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Life was full of vitality.

Just as Qin Yu was thinking, his phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Zhuang Teng.

He smiled on the phone and said, “Brother Qin, we’re having a dinner party. Do you want to join in the fun?”

“Dinner party?” Qin Yu thought for a moment and agreed, “Okay, where is it?”

Zhuang Teng smiled and said, “It’s at my house. I’ll send a car to pick you up later!”

“That’s not necessary. Just tell me the address,” Qin Yu agreed.

Seeing this, Zhuang Teng didn’t insist. After giving Qin Yu the address, he hung up the phone.

Qin Yu was about to ask these top aristocratic families for resources, but he didn’t expect Zhuang Teng to call.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu called a car and rushed to the Zhuang family.

By the time Qin Yu arrived at the Zhuang family, the place was already packed with people.

It had to be said that the Zhuang family was very large. The open-air plaza already had a feast set up.

The entrance was filled with luxury cars. It was very obvious that other than the martial arts circle’s aristocratic children, the rich heirs in Jingdu had also received an invitation.

“Brother Qin.” At this moment, Chu Heng walked forward and greeted Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded to him and said with a smile, “Things are really lively today.”

Chu Heng smiled and said, “Yes, today is Zhuang Teng’s birthday. Every year, he will hold a big banquet on his birthday.”

“Birthday? This... I didn’t have the time to prepare any gifts.” Qin Yu was a little embarrassed.

Chu Heng smiled and said, “It’s okay. As long as you are here, it’s enough.”

As they spoke, Chu Heng brought Qin Yu to the sofa and sat down.

The people sitting here were almost all the people that Qin Yu was familiar with.

“Brother Qin, take a seat first. I’ll go help Zhuang Teng,” said Chu Heng.

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded slightly.

After he left, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh and say, “Zhuang Teng is really an expert at socializing.”

Kong Yun, who was at the side, nodded and said, “Mm, this person’s cultivation isn’t that great, but he loves socializing and has a wide network.”

As he spoke, Yao Meng and Wan Guqiong walked over from not far away.

“Qin Yu, what a coincidence. You’re here too.” Wan Guqiong smiled.

Qin Yu nodded at him as a form of greeting. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Following that, Wan Guqiong greeted everyone present before his gaze finally landed on Qin Yu.

“Brother Qin, can I have a word with you?” Wan Guqiong asked.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. He immediately stood up and followed Wan Guqiong to the side.

The two of them came to a deserted place. Wan Guqiong said, “Qin Yu, didn’t you want to look at the portrait of the Guardian? I took it.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. A trace of interest flashed in his eyes.

Wan Guqiong took out his phone and took out a photo.

Then, he handed the phone to Qin Yu and said, “This is the photo of the Guardian.”

Qin Yu took the phone and looked at the portrait on the phone. A trace of shock flashed across Qin Yu’s face.
