Chapter 1235: Chapter 1,235, Ruoxue, will you come back 

Listening to the beeping on the other end of the phone, Qin Yu’s heart was filled with mixed feelings.

He was not too surprised. Old Mister Yan was about to die, but he did not expect it to be so soon.

“A person’s life is too short. To an ordinary person, it is just a few decades in a hurry.”Qin Yu sighed slightly.

Towards old Mister Yan, his feelings were extremely complicated.

As the saying goes, love the house and the Crow. No matter how much Qin Yu loved Yan Ruoxue, he would love her family.

Moreover, when Qin Yu had just started his cultivation journey, Old Mister Yan had also given Qin Yu a lot of help.

“Return to the Yan country.”Qin Yu stood up and said in a cold pyro.

Old Mister Yan’s time was approaching and he probably would not be able to hold on for too long. Hence, Qin Yu did not dare to waste a single second.

On the same day, Qin Yu rushed back to Jingdu from Luhuang Island. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yan family manor.

It was an extremely lively day.

Many luxury cars were parked at the entrance. Most of the important people in Jingdu had already arrived.

They surrounded the hall as if they were waiting for old Mister Yan’s funeral.

Seeing Qin Yu Walk in, everyone in the hall stood up one after another.

The way they looked at Qin Yu was extremely strange. There was worry and fear in their eyes. There was even a hint of fear in the depths of some people’s eyes.

Among them was none other than Yan Sihai.

He slowly stood up and gestured for everyone to sit down.

As for himself, he walked in front of Qin Yu.

“You came quite quickly.”There was no emotion in Yan Sihai’s voice.

Qin Yu said with a faint smile, “Old Mister Yan passed away. You should be the happiest, right?”

Yan Sihai snorted and didn’t say anything.

“Which room is old Mister Yan in?”Qin Yu asked.

Yan Sihai said, “Follow me.”

Qin Yu followed Old Mister Yan and came to a room on the second floor.

Old Mister Yan was lying on the bed. His life was in danger and he looked extremely old.

Even the young body that Qin Yu found for him looked old.

A few brothers from the Yan family were surrounding old Mister Yan.

Some covered their faces, some cried, and some held old Mister Yan’s hand reluctantly.

“Old Mister Yan.”Qin Yu walked quickly to Old Mister Yan.

Old Mister Yan smiled and said, “Qin Yu, you’re here...”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Old Mister Yan, how do you feel now?”

Old Mister Yan did not seem to want to continue this topic. He waved his hand and said, “Since everyone is here, it’s time for me to say my last words.”

Hearing this, everyone in the room was a little nervous.

Among them, Yan Sihai’s expression clearly became a little unnatural. He lit a cigarette and kept smoking, as if he wanted to dispel the nervousness in his heart.

Qin Yu knew in his heart that what they were nervous about was the position of the Patriarch of the Yan family.

Old Mister Yan naturally knew better. His pair of eyes that were like an ancient pond swept over everyone before finally landing on Qin Yu.

“I know. All of you want to know who will inherit the position of the head of the Yan family after I leave...”old Mister Yan said slowly.

Once these words were said, the people in the room became even more nervous.

Old Mister Yan let out a long sigh and said, “To be honest, I initially wanted to leave the position of the head of the family to Ruoxue, but I didn’t expect Ruoxue to disappear without a Trace...”

Yan Sihai’s expression suddenly changed, and a trace of anger flashed in his eyes.

He opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he endured it.

“Since Ruoxue isn’t here, the position of family head should be handed over to Qin Yu...”Old Mister Yan said in a low voice.

“Old Mister Yan, I’m not interested in the position of family head.”Qin Yu frowned and said.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry, I haven’t finished speaking...”

“In my expectations, the position of family head of the Yan family should indeed be handed over to Ruoxue or Qin Yu... but plans often can’t keep up with changes. I think that for Qin Yu, property is nothing.”

Yan Sihai patted his chest and clearly heaved a sigh of relief.

“I know my own body best. I had long expected that I would not live for long, so during this period of time, I have been thinking about the issue of the successor,”Old Mister Yan continued.

At this moment, his gaze fell on Yan Sihai.

“I have thought about it for a long time, and in the end, I feel that this position... is the most suitable for Sihai,”old Mister Yan said.

Hearing this, Yan Sihai was instantly overjoyed!

He hurriedly walked in front of old Mister Yan and said excitedly, “Dad, you’ve finally thought it through. The position of the Patriarch of the Yan family should be taken by me!”

At this moment, Qin Yu shot a cold glance at Yan Sihai.

Only then did Yan Sihai realize that he had lost his composure and quickly retreated to the side.

“Sihai, I hope that you will treat your brothers well. They are all your flesh and blood,”old Mister Yan waved his hand and said.

Yan Sihai said excitedly, “Dad, don’t worry! I guarantee that they will be rich and prosperous for the rest of their lives!”

Old Mister Yan did not say anything more. He waved his hand and said, “You guys go out first. Qin Yu, you stay here.”

After chasing everyone out of the room, only Qin Yu and old Mister Yan were left in the room.

“Old Mister Yan, if you have anything to say, just say it.”Qin Yu half-knelt in front of old Mister Yan and said.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “The one I can not rest assured about is ruoxue. You...”

“You don’t have to worry.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“I will definitely take good care of her.”

Old Mister Yan seemed to have a stomach full of words to say, but in the end, he did not say anything. He just waved his hand and said, “You go out first. I want to be alone.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth. He wanted to say something, but was interrupted by Old Mister Yan with a wave of his hand.

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only sigh slightly and walk out of the room.

A group of people stood at the door of old Mister Yan’s room.

And the famous people of Jingdu who had come to visit were waiting in the hall on the first floor.

“It’s strange. Just a moment ago, my father was in a critical state, but now he suddenly seems to have recovered,”Yan Sihai muttered.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Why? Are you impatient?”

“No. To be honest, I’ve done so many bad things. I really didn’t expect my father to give me the position,”Yan Sihai sighed.

Qin Yu snorted lightly and couldn’t be bothered with Yan Sihai.

Everyone waited from day to night, but the dying old Mister Yan still showed no signs of passing away.

Qin Yu knew that he still had a breath in his heart. He still had a care in his heart.

That Care was Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue, will you come back?”Qin Yu looked at the sky outside the window and whispered.
