Chapter 1425: Chapter 1,425, working for the Heavenly Cloud Sect? 1

That palm arrived in an instant, giving no time for anyone to think.

Just as the three of them were about to stand up, they were smashed into meat paste, unable to even send out their spiritual senses.

The people on the side all clapped and cheered, while Qin Yu’s heart was filled with shock!

What kind of method was this! Facing three existences that were even stronger than the first elder, he killed them in an instant!

“This Xiao Hai is probably even stronger than Jue Wu!”Qin Yu was secretly shocked in her heart.

As expected of being called a legend, his strength was indeed not to be underestimated!

With this kind of strength, it was probably enough to contend against the Tianyun sect!

“You deserve to die.”Xiao Hai looked at the three corpses and said coldly.

Then, he extended his palm, and a ray of light fell on the three people’s bodies.

The bodies of the three people instantly disappeared without a trace.

“Thank you, master Xiao Hai, for saving us!”Someone wanted to kneel down, but was supported by Xiao Hai’s spiritual energy.

He looked at the crowd, and the cold aura disappeared, replaced by an indescribable warmth, as if he was the neighbor next door.

He cupped his hands to the crowd and said, “This is what I should do, no need to be polite.”

Looking at Xiao Hai fighting with everyone, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be secretly shocked.

What kind of person was this? Not only did he have extraordinary abilities, but he also had a mentality that ordinary people couldn’t compare to.

It was likely that this person’s strength was even stronger than imagined.

“Why is this Xiao Hai wearing a mask?”Qin Yu asked the person beside him.

“How would I know? Anyway, since he came to the South Province, he has always been wearing a mask. Wherever there are people who oppress the common people, there will be traces of hero Xiao Hai!”The other party laughed.

Qin Yu grunted in gratitude. Towards such a hero, Qin Yu naturally had some admiration in her heart.

It was not an exaggeration to say that which man had not thought of becoming a hero who saved the suffering and saved the suffering.

Qin Yu did not stay any longer. Although she really wanted to go over and say hello to Xiao Hai, her identity was still sensitive, so in the end, she still chose to continue moving forward.

There was still some distance to Qingyan Forest from here.

Just as Zhuo Jing had said, there were many people who went to Qingyan Forest.

A few dozen stars away from Qingyan Forest, there were relay stations, tea houses, and other places.

Many people were drinking tea and chatting in the tea house. Among these people, there were young people dressed in beautiful clothes, and there were also strong men dressed in ragged clothes.

These young people were mostly young masters from aristocratic families who came here to train.

As for those strong men, they were mostly here to earn a living.

Qin Yu found a teahouse and ordered a cup of tea. He also intended to take a break.

He deliberately found a relatively quiet teahouse and sat down to avoid being recognized.

However, not long after Qin Yu sat down, there was a commotion outside.

He turned his head and saw a man wearing a mask walking in.

This man was none other than Xiao Hai.

His appearance naturally attracted countless people.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He immediately put the money on the table and planned to leave.

But at this moment, Xiao Hai discovered Qin Yu.

He sized up Qin Yu and said, “Little brother, we meet again.”

Qin Yu was shocked. He immediately cupped his hands to Xiao Hai and said, “Greetings, hero Xiao.”

Xiao Hai raised his hand to Pat Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “Since we can meet, it must be fate. Shall we sit down and have a drink together?”

Qin Yu sighed slightly in her heart.

It was very obvious that this Xiao Hai had recognized her and heard about the matter between her and the Heavenly Cloud sect. Otherwise, how could he remember it after just one meeting.

“Then I will respectfully accept your request.”Qin Yu bowed and immediately sat at Xiao Hai’s side.

Whether it was a blessing or a curse, he could not avoid it. Qin Yu did not think too much about it. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After all, facing someone like Xiao Hai, even if Qin Yu had great abilities, he would not be able to escape.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu let go of his guard.

He took the initiative to ask, “Hero Xiao, who were those three people just now?”

Hearing this, Xiao Hai could not help but sigh and said, “Most likely they came from the north.”

“The northern lands?”Qin Yu frowned. “The northern lands are very far from the southern region. How did they come here?”

Xiao Hai said, “People like them most likely committed important crimes in the northern lands and moved around to commit crimes. That’s why they came to the Southern Region.”

“Of course, I can’t guarantee that they were not sent by the Master of the Northern Lands.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Aren’t the southern region and the northern lands supposed to stay out of each other’s Way?”

“No, you’re wrong.”Xiao Hai shook his head. “On the surface, it looks like that, but in reality, there are endless conflicts in the dark. Everyone wants to annex each other.”

“But... between the southern prefecture and the northern lands, there should also be obstructions, right? Just like the Southern Prefecture and the western ridge,”Qin Yu guessed.

Xiao Hai smiled and said, “You know quite a lot. That’s right. There are also obstructions between the southern prefecture and the northern lands, but it is said that the obstructions between the five regions over the years are slowly becoming smaller. Sooner or later, they will completely overlap.”

“When that time comes, I’m afraid that no one other than the Thunder Academy will be able to escape,”Xiao Hai said.

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization. This concept was quite similar to the concept of a country on earth.

“In that case... you are considered to be working for the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”Qin Yu suddenly came back to her senses.
