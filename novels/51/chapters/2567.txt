Chapter 2568: Powerful

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Even at the Advanced-stage Fifth level, Ruoxue and the dean also nearly died.

Moreover, as these people perished, Zi Yang’s internal qi had become as scorching as the sun, making people unable to breathe.

Primordial Chaos!

Qin Yu’s pupils turned blood-red as the devil’s elemental energy, demonic elemental energy, and chaotic elemental energy erupted from his body. The destructive energy exploded from his body as he stomped his feet.

He charged at the figure like a cannonball.

“Boom!”

Within the terrifying power, the space within 10,000 meters of where Zi Yang shattered.

Qin Yu’s punch, which he had gathered all his strength, landed squarely on Zi Yang’s chest.

His expression did not change at all. After that, he passed through Qin Yu’s body. It was just like a mosquito had touched him.

As that figure pierced through, Qin Yu felt a destructive force detonate within his body.

It was the most basic form of attack, akin to a crude street brawl punch.

However, this level of holy energy was completely out of their cultivation realm. Therefore, they could not stop it at all.

The ultimate strength of the fifth level seemed extremely laughable to the Saint.

Even though it was merely his clone, it still made Qin Yu feel powerless.

The Seal of Heaven Returning in Qin Yu’s dantian suddenly emitted an intense light.

A strong recovery power exploded in Qin Yu’s body, resisting Zi Yang’s internal qi and squeezing his destructive holy energy out of his body bit by bit.

His body, which had initially begun to shatter, slowly started to restore, and the burning flames gradually subsided.

“So Chen Shuang had condensed the Seal of Heaven Returning for you. I thought he had condensed it for Xuan Xin.”

Zi Yang turned around, and his gaze landed on Qin Yu.

In an instant, Qin Yu felt that gaze had seen through all his life threads, and exposed all his secrets.

“This Seal of Heaven Returning not only condenses the Saint’s qi but also involves an inheritance that even a Saint can’t resist. It’s a pity to give this to you. I don’t know why Chen Shuang has chosen you.”

He shook his head, seemingly puzzled.

His gaze fell on the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, and his left hand pointed far into the space.

Amidst the impenetrable clouds in the sky, the sun suddenly set, and a little dusk appeared.

The clouds slowly retreated, and a fist-sized lotus descended toward the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

Blazing Sun Red Lotus.

The red lotus, which descended upon the mountaintops of the vast canyon of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, suddenly released thousands of blazing yellow threads.

Following that, the threads expanded dozens of times, and a terrifying bloody hole appeared in the bodies of everyone who had been pierced.

The bodies instantly turned into charcoal. In the following moment, the fire lotus completely exploded.

The entire Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect instantly vaporized. Everyone fighting in the sect completely vaporized into liquid.

The entire mountain range was completely melted by the flames. After the flames burned out, the Mysterious Sky Sword Sect turned into a bottomless canyon.

This kind of power, regardless of the monster race or the human race, all were suddenly stunned.

No matter how powerful a person was, they could not resist at all. It was no longer the power of the world.

“How terrifying! Is this the strength of the Tribulation Sixth Level?”

The Asura Godly King’s voice trembled slightly.

Even Xiang Yu’s eyes were full of shock. Although rumors had it that he slew Saint Yan Tianfeng alongside the eight-winged monster race, everyone knew he only killed a mortal body.

The root cause was the spirit of his divine kingdom being schemed against by the other Saints and was destroyed completely.

However, he also understood that they could not possess such Saint’s power with their own strength. They would not have a chance to enter the Kingdom of Saint unless they could accomplish monumental achievements.

At this moment, a hint of reluctance flashed across his eyes.

Being in close contact with Zi Yang’s Saint’s power made all living beings realize how small they were.

“I feel much better now. It’s your turn.”

Zi Yang came before Qin Yu once again. Qin Yu could not detect any emotional fluctuations from him.

Even though he was facing the sect where he had grown up and his fellow disciples…

He was only killing precisely, just to cut off all the restraints that bound him.

After the destruction of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect, the internal qi on his body pressured Qin Yu to the point that he could not even breathe.

Individual being possessed like him was even scarier.

Kingdom of Soul!

Only by erupting the power of Primordial Chaos could Qin Yu activate the Ghostly Sword Evil Eye.

In this battle, all the souls that were absorbed into the ghostly swords were completely ignited.

The overwhelming expanse of the soul instantly formed around Qin Yu, creating a world of souls by his side.

Countless vortexes appeared around Zi Yang, and a terrifying soul-suction force raged out.

The power of the Primordial Chaos strike just now made Qin Yu understand that conventional means would not suffice to go against Zi Yang. He must rely on his most potent soul attack.

The howls of the ghosts instantly resounded throughout heaven and earth.

Even the several great Godly Kings extremely far away could feel that terrifying soul-suction force.

“This guy has grown to this extent! He has advanced further after fighting with me! D*mn it!”

He Teng revealed a ferocious expression.

He suddenly slapped his own face hard, leaving five deep claw marks. “You trash! It’s been so long, yet you’re still at where you are!”

His face disclosed two completely different expressions. Qin Yu’s appearance seemed to have stimulated the appearance of another soul.

Looking at the possessed He Teng, the other monster race living beings seemed unfazed, showing no signs of surprise as though it was a usual occurrence for them.

However, this terrifying soul attack was completely useless against Zi Yang.

“The Seal of Heaven Returning can only save you once. This thing shouldn’t be in your hands.”

He stretched out his palm, and a tiny Blazing Sun Red Lotus slowly spun on it.

In its crystal-like petals, one could vaguely see the holy fire that had been compressed to the extreme.

A ray of light suddenly shot out, just like the explosion at the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect previously.

Suddenly, a flaming light shot toward Qin Yu.

“Freeze!”

The fiery lotus as beautiful as fireworks seemed to be frozen.

It did not explode completely. Before the fire lotus, a giant green bubble surrounded it.

Inside the bubble, everything was frozen, and everything stopped moving.

All the living beings seemed to have turned into statues. They stood still on the spot, and even their internal qi had disappeared.

The wind stopped, and so did the clouds. Even the water stopped flowing.

Even the fiery light from the fire lotus suddenly stopped in mid-air.

“The power of misfortune! This power will cause you to be cursed, erasing all traces of you living in the present moment..”
