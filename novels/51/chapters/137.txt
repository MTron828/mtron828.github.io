Chapter 138: Yan Ruoxue’s Worries Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Ruoxue blushed and said petulantly, “Grandpa, what nonsense are you talking about?!”

“Hahaha.”

“I watched you grow up. How could I not know what you’re thinking?” Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but stroke his beard and laugh.

Yan Ruoxue instantly blushed to the root of her neck. She covered the notebook and changed the topic, “Grandpa, is there something wrong?”

Old Mister Yan sat on the sofa in the bedroom and slowly said, “I’m here to tell you about Qin Yu.”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue immediately stood up.

She quickly sat beside Old Mister Yan and said with a somewhat anxious tone, “Grandpa, how is Qin Yu now?”

Old Mister Yan didn’t answer, but kept her guessing. “What do you think?”

Yan Ruoxue thought for a moment and said, “When I left, Qin Yu happened to have a feud with the Liu family. Now... Qin Yu should be thinking of a way to deal with the Liu family.”

“Yep.” Old Mister Yan nodded slightly to indicate for Yan Ruoxue to continue.

Yan Ruoxue thought for a moment and said, “The Liu family has Liu Shihui and Tao Shan. According to what I know, Tao Shan isn’t simple to deal with. If I were Qin Yu... I would use the Yan family’s reputation to protect myself. At least my life won’t be in danger and I will be able to slowly develop.”

Old Mister Yan seemed to have guessed what Yan Ruoxue would say. He shook his head and said, “It’s a pity that I have sent people to say that the Yan family will never interfere in Qin Yu’s matters, let alone care about his life or death.”

Yan Ruoxue’s expression immediately turned extremely ugly!

She stood up in a flash and said somewhat angrily, “Grandfather, aren’t you harming Qin Yu!?”

“Hahaha.” Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“If Qin Yu always has the Yan family’s protection, does he still have the chance to grow?” Old Mister Yan shook his head.

How could Yan Ruoxue still listen to him? She said anxiously, ” Tell me how Qin Yu is now!”

“The Liu family has lost, and they have lost thoroughly.” Old Mister Yan said with a nonchalant smile.

Yan Ruoxue was stunned. She hurriedly asked, “Grandfather, is what you said true?”

“Of course.” Old Mister Yan said with a nonchalant smile.

“Not only that, but not long ago, Qin Yu personally killed an Inner Strength Past Master from overseas.”

This time, Yan Ruoxue was even more shocked!

Before she left, Qin Yu was only at stage five of Inner Strength. How could he develop to such a level in such a short time?

“I have already said that the son of that man isn’t an ordinary person,” Old Mister Yan said with a nonchalant smile.

A hint of relief appeared on Yan Ruoxue’s face. She said in a low voice, “I knew that Qin Yu wouldn’t let me down.”

Even Old Mister Yan sighed and said, “Yes, in fact, my prediction is similar to yours, but Qin Yu has exceeded my imagination.”

“Of course!” Yan Ruoxue’s tone sounded a little proud.

Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but force a laugh. Back then, he was afraid that Yan Ruoxue would look down on Qin Yu, but he didn’t expect Yan Ruoxue to fall for him herself.

“Don’t be happy too early. Although Chuzhou is only a small place, there are still a few big families who reign over it,” Old Mister Yan said slowly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Of course, Yan Ruoxue already knew. Because of Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue had a clear understanding of Chuzhou.

In Chuzhou, the truly top-tier families were still in the provincial capital.

And among them, the Jiang family was the most respected. Rumor had it that the Jiang family kept a low profile, but their assets were distributed throughout the entire Chuzhou province, and their liquid capital amounted to ten billion!

Not only that, but the Jiang family was also a martial arts blue-blood family. They had nearly ten Inner Strength Past Masters, and it was rumored that the head of the Jiang family was even a peak Inner Strength Past Master!

This might not be considered impressive in the eyes of the Yan family, but in Chuzhou, it was enough to run amok!

“Qin Yu isn’t stupid. Why would he take the initiative to provoke them?” Yan Ruoxue said softly.

Old Mister Yan had a different opinion. He shook his head and said, “People cut down the tall poppy. There are some things that can’t be avoided as you wish.”

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but bite her rosy lips.

She knew very well that with Qin Yu’s current abilities, it was absolutely impossible for him to go against the Jiang family, a top-notch family in Chuzhou.

“Grandfather...” Thinking of this, Yan Ruoxue couldn’t help but look at Old Mister Yan affectionately.

Old Mister Yan couldn’t help but force a smile.

He had been in Jingdu for decades and had always been known for his decisive and ruthless tactics.

But when it came to his granddaughter, he could never keep a straight face.

Every time Yan Ruoxue showed affection, Old Mister Yan wouldn’t even know how to reject her.

“Don’t worry, I’ll keep him alive,” Old Mister Yan said with a forced smile.

“Really?” Yan Ruoxue’s eyes lit up.

Old Mister Yan rolled his eyes. “If he really dies, won’t you hold a grudge against me for the rest of your life?”

Yan Ruoxue’s pretty face blushed again, and she whispered, “Grandpa, don’t talk nonsense...”

...

Yao Qing sped all the way back to Jiangcheng’s territory.

“Mr. Qin, did something happen in Jiangcheng? Why are there people from the military district everywhere?” Yao Qing looked out of the car window and couldn’t help but frown slightly.

The entire Jiangcheng seemed to be in a state of martial law. There were armed soldiers patrolling and guarding everywhere.

Qin Yu also felt that it was a little strange, but this had nothing to do with him, so he didn’t think too much about it.

The car soon returned to Dragon Paradise.

After Qin Yu arrived at Dragon Paradise, the first thing Qin Yu planned to do was to go to the factory to look for Mr. Yang and ask about the Chinese Medicine Conference.

However, just as Qin Yu took out his phone, it rang.

The caller was actually Su Yan.

Seeing her phone number, Qin Yu frowned.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu hung up the phone.

However, not long after, the phone rang again.

Qin Yu frowned. He picked up the phone and said with some annoyance, “What’s the matter?”

On the other end, Su Yan was immediately furious, but when she thought of Zhao Gang’s death last time, she felt a little intimidated.

“You... do you think I actually want to call you? Let me tell you, it’s my grandpa who wants to see you. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have called you!” Su Yan braced herself and said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately fell into silence.

A moment later, Qin Yu said, “I have already made it clear to Grandpa last time. I have already severed all ties with the Su family. There’s no need to see me.”
