Chapter 1033: Chapter 1,033: No Reconciliation!

After he hung up the phone, Qin Yu rushed towards Jingdu.

He rushed all the way to Jingdu. At this moment, the entrance of the martial arts association in Jingdu was already showing signs of decline.

Two Martial Saints were stationed at the entrance. They were sent by the second secret realm to protect and prevent anyone from taking the opportunity to cause trouble.

Qin Yu walked straight forward. These two martial saints immediately raised their hands to stop Qin Yu.

“Who are you?”One of the Martial Saints asked.

“Qin Yu.”

The two of them looked at each other. A trace of killing intent was clearly revealed in their eyes.

However, despite this, they still made way.

Qin Yu looked at these two people, but he did not leave for a long time.

He said coldly, “Do you want to kill me?”

The two people’s faces turned cold and they did not say a word.

At this moment, the internal Qi on Qin Yu’s body suddenly exploded!

A terrifying pressure instantly spread out!

Both of them were at the early-stage of the martial saint realm, but the difference in strength between them was like a horizontal ditch!

Just the pressure that Qin Yu released made the two of them break out in cold sweat!

They only felt as if they were carrying a huge mountain on their shoulders. This huge mountain kept pressing down on their bodies!

Very quickly, their originally tall and straight bodies slowly bent down.

Even though they tried their best to resist, it was still difficult for them to stop their bodies from sinking.

At this moment, Qin Yu withdrew the pressure on his body.

He said coldly, “It’s best to restrain the killing intent on your bodies. The next time I discover it, it won’t be so simple anymore.”

The two of them were both shocked and afraid! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

For the first time, they had their own understanding of Qin Yu’s strength.

Qin Yu Strode into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Xia hang was already waiting at the door of the meeting room.

Seeing Qin Yu walking over, Xia Hang gave Qin Yu a look, indicating for him to be careful.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He pushed open the door and swaggered in.

When he came to the meeting room for the second time, Qin Yu seemed to have sensed a strange internal Qi.

Qin Yu could sense a trace of internal Qi that did not belong to this world from those eight high-ranking officials.

Perhaps it was because of the power of his divine sense, or perhaps it was because Qin Yu had become a martial saint.

In short, when he came last time, Qin Yu did not sense this trace of internal Qi.

Qin Yu casually found a seat and sat down. He put his feet on the table and said indifferently, “Tell me, what do you want from me?”

Seeing Qin Yu’s disrespectful attitude, although they were a bit displeased, they didn’t say anything.

“Qin Yu, you are a talent, so young...”

“This kind of nonsense, there’s no need to say it,”Qin Yu interrupted them.

“Okay, then let’s get straight to the point,”one of the higher-ups said.

“The development of the situation has already exceeded our imagination. Your talent is even more powerful than we imagined.”

“If it continues to develop, it will be disadvantageous to both of us. Why Don’t we reconcile? You can put forward any conditions.”

When Qin Yu heard this, a hint of ridicule flashed across his face.

Before he came here, Qin Yu had already guessed what kind of fart they were going to say, so he was not surprised at all.

Qin Yu slowly sat up straight and sneered, “Reconcile? Do you think that’s possible?”

“There is nothing impossible in this world,”one of the higher-ups said.

Qin Yu sneered, “You hurt my woman and chased me to the ends of the Earth. I struggled to survive in the crevices and barely managed to survive until today.”

“Now that I’ve entered the Martial Saint Realm, do you think you can’t kill me and want to reconcile with me? Dream On!”

The scene fell into a short silence.

A few seconds later, a higher-up said, “We can give you the martial arts association of Jingdu, and you can control it.”

“We can guarantee that your authority is higher than any other president, whether it’s Granny Qin or Gu Xinghe.”

Qin Yu sneered, “If I remember correctly, this is the second time you’ve asked for peace with me, right?”

“It’s different. This time, we’re sincere,”a higher-up said.

“With your talent, the martial saint and even this world are not your final destination.”

“With our help, it’s possible for you to step into the almighty realm or even higher.”

Qin Yu sneered, “You want to reconcile? Fine, put tubes in your bodies and drain all your blood, how about that?”

“Qin Yu, don’t say such words that don’t show,”a higher-up said coldly.

“At least Yan Ruoxue isn’t dead. She’s still alive, isn’t She?”

“No matter what we did, it didn’t cause any serious consequences.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu was instantly furious!

He smashed the table in front of him with one punch and said with his eyes wide open, “F * ck you! Didn’t cause any serious consequences? According to what you said, as long as people didn’t die, there wouldn’t be any consequences, right? F * ck your mother!”

“Let me tell you eight animals, as long as I, Qin Yu, am still alive, I will definitely tear you into pieces!”

“I know, you are not in this world, right? No matter if you are in the first secret realm or any other world, I will definitely drag you out and kill you personally!”

Before they could finish their words, they had already fallen into a stalemate.

The voices of those eight higher-ups gradually turned cold.

“Just because we are having a good talk with you does not mean that we are afraid of you,”one of the higher-ups said coldly.

“You are only a martial saint. Although your strength is indeed far superior to an ordinary martial saint, we still have a way to kill you!”

Qin Yu looked at the few of them coldly and said, “You have already said this many times. I am looking forward to it.”

“Also, let me tell you, I will soon start a war against the second secret area.”

“After I have taken down the second secret area, my next target will be the first secret area! The eight of you, wait for me!”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

“Don’t you want to Know About Yan Ruoxue?”

At this moment, a voice entered Qin Yu’s ears.
