Chapter 707: Yan Ruoxue’s Purpose Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Ning Kun’s words had indeed tempted Qin Yu.

Even if he found the Mystic Realm, he didn’t know how to take Yan Ruoxue away.

More importantly, Qin Yu had already failed many times.

Facing the powerful Jingdu Martial Arts Association, no matter how hard Qin Yu worked, it would be difficult for him to rely on himself to save her.

Unless the Jingdu Martial Arts Association disappeared from this world.

However, that was a long process. Before he became a Martial Saint, there was no chance at all.

“Mr. Qin, what do you think?” Ning Kun continued to ask.

Qin Yu raised his head and said in a deep voice, “Then what do you hope to get from me?”

Ning Kun drank a mouthful of water and said with a nonchalant smile, “Our goal is very simple. We want to be on good terms with Mr. Qin, because we see great potential in you.”

This answer made Qin Yu not know what to do for a moment.

Ning Kun looked quite sincere, but Qin Yu felt that something wasn’t right, as if there was some hidden conspiracy.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Okay, as long as you can save Yan Ruoxue, I can promise you anything.”

“Hahaha!” Ning Kun was immediately overjoyed.

He stood up and walked to Qin Yu. He shook hands with Qin Yu and said, “Then I wish us a happy cooperation!”

“Wait.” At this moment, Qin Yu changed the topic.

“Hong Yi Sect has always emphasized that they will give me resources, right?” Qin Yu asked.

Ning Kun nodded and said, “Of course.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu nodded.

“I urgently need a 10,000-year-old herb right now. I don’t think the Hong Yi Sect will refuse me, right?” Qin Yu smiled and said.

When he heard this, Ning Kun’s expression couldn’t help but darken.

Ancestor Guan sneered. “10,000-year-old herbs? Do you know what a 10,000-year-old herb means? The appearance of such a herb is enough to attract the attention of all the aristocratic families! Now, you’re asking for 10,000-year-old herbs?”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said, “Then what are the resources you’re talking about? What exactly can you bring me?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

One sentence instantly made Ancestor Guan speechless.

“Mr. Ning, if you can’t do it, then forget it,” said Qin Yu.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

At this time, Ning Kun’s body flashed and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

He smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, just as Ancestor Guan said, these ten-thousand-year-old herbs are of extraordinary significance. Even for the Hong Yi Sect, there is a lot of pressure. I’m afraid I have to apply to the higher-ups. Why don’t you wait for my news?”

“Sure.” Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and looked relaxed.

“Then in three days, I’ll ask Su Qian to bring you the news,” said Ning Kun.

“Okay, I’ll wait for your good news.” Qin Yu nodded.

Then, Qin Yu turned around and walked out of the hall.

The resources in this Mystic Realm were probably all emptied out by the Hong Yi Sect. Qin Yu walked around and didn’t get anything.

Therefore, there was no need for Qin Yu to stay, so he left the Mystic Realm.

After Qin Yu left, Ning Kun’s expression instantly darkened.

“Mr. Ning, do you really think that Qin Yu will work for us?” Ancestor Guan said coldly.

“I also think it’s unlikely. Qin Yu is rebellious. He will never become one of us,” the others said coldly.

Ning Kun snorted and said, “No need to say anything. I have my own plans.”

After saying this, Ning Kun turned around and left the hall.

A man in a black robe was sitting in his room.

The man’s face seemed to be concealed by some kind of spell. At a glance, there was only a black hole.

“How is it? Did he agree?” The black-robed man asked coldly.

Ning Kun nodded and said, “He has agreed, but he has a condition. He wants a 10,000-year-old herb.”

“10,000-year-old herbs... Hmph, 10,000-year-old herbs. the Hong Yi Sect doesn’t have many of them,” the black-robed man said coldly.

Ning Kun frowned and said, “Then what should we do? If we can’t get this 10,000-year-old herb, Qin Yu will change his mind at any time.”

The black runner was silent for a moment, then said, “We can’t take out ten-thousand-year-old herbs, but we can tell him where to find ten-thousand-year-old herbs.”

“As for whether he can get it or not, it depends on his own luck.”

Ning Kun nodded slightly, then said with some confusion, “Is it really worth paying so much for Qin Yu?”

“You should know that if we really help him save Yan Ruoxue, then we will have completely offended the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

“Moreover... Qin Yu might betray us at any time.”

The black-robed man sneered. “Do you really think that we are doing this to help him?”

Ning Kun said with some confusion, “Or else?”

The black-robed man snorted lightly, “We are doing this to snatch Yan Ruoxue from the hands of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

“Snatch Yan Ruoxue away?” Ning Kun was even more confused.

The black-robed man said indifferently, “Yan Ruoxue is in the hands of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. We have no chance to take action, nor do we know where Yan Ruoxue is being held. Only through Qin Yu can we find Yan Ruoxue.”

Ning Kun frowned, “Didn’t you say that Yan Ruoxue is being held in a Mystic Realm?”

“That’s right, but the Jingdu Martial Arts Association controls too many Mystic Realms. We can’t search them one by one,” said the black-robed man.

“And we don’t even know where the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s Mystic Realm is!”

“As long as we bring Yan Ruoxue out of the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu will lose his value.”

As soon as he said this, Ning Kun immediately understood.

He said with some surprise, “Then you said that Yan Ruoxue was locked in the Mystic Realm because...”

“I guessed,” the black-robed man said lightly.

“The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely bring her into the Mystic Realm because it’s the safest place.”

Ning Kun couldn’t help but be shocked. He couldn’t help but mutter, “What kind of identity does Yan Ruoxue have that she’s worth us going through so much trouble?”

The black-robed man smiled nonchalantly and said, “Let me put it this way. As long as we get Yan Ruoxue, the Hong Yi Sect will no longer need to hide overseas.”

This made Ning Kun even more shocked!

A woman who had never cultivated before actually had such a great effect?

It was really hard to imagine!

...

After leaving this Mystic Realm, Su Qian said with a slightly apologetic tone, “Mr. Qin, you won’t take the matter of Guan Zu to heart, right? The Hong Yi Sect is still looking forward to your joining.”

Qin Yu smiled nonchalantly and said, “Of course I won’t mind. Moreover, I’ve killed so many people from the Hong Yi Sect. Their attitude naturally won’t be any better.”

“On the contrary, if their attitude is too humble, it will instead make me feel strange.”

Su Qian nodded and said with a smile, “That’s good.”

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave Qing City. Instead, he planned to wait for Ning Kun’s news.

If he could really obtain a stalk of ten-thousand-year-old herbs, then this trip wouldn’t have been in vain.

At night, Qin Yu sat alone on a mountain range in Qing City.

His body was bathed in white light, and the internal qi in his body was slowly surging.

“In my current state, I am enough to step into the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but think as he sensed the internal qi in his body.

However, he wasn’t in a hurry to break through. Instead, he continued to suppress his internal qi.

Stepping into the intermediate stage of the Martial Marquis realm too quickly would be detrimental to Qin Yu’s subsequent breakthrough.

He planned to wait for an opportunity, an opportunity to directly step into the advanced stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.
