Chapter 913: Chapter 913, the battle with the martial saint 

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned ugly.

The Cautious Qin Yu had already checked his surroundings before he arrived.

However, he never expected that the martial saint’s technique was far beyond Qin Yu’s imagination.

They had concealed their internal Qi so that Qin Yu could not detect them at all.

Qin Yu took two steps back as a trace of solemnity flashed across his face.

“Qin Yu, this...”

“Old Mister Yan, please stay in the room.”Old Mister Yan was about to speak when he was interrupted by Qin Yu.

Wan guqiong sneered, “At this time, do you still care about others?”

Qin Yu said with a cold face, “Wan guqiong, how do you know my relationship with Old Mister Yan?”

Wan guqiong said sarcastically, “Do you think I’m like those idiots, doing useless work every day like a headless fly? I’ve long investigated your social history.”

Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Wan guqiong’s treachery was beyond imagination.

“Let me ask you. You killed all the people in the Green Moon Villa, right?”Qin Yu said coldly.

Wan guqiong clenched his nails and said indifferently, “Not bad. TSK TSK. They’ve tried all kinds of ways to die.”

“You’re really a beast,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Wan guqiong narrowed his eyes and said, “They died because of you. Compared to us, you’re not much stronger.”

At this point, Wan Guqiong changed the topic and said with a faint smile, “Tell me where Yan Ruoxue is, and I may spare your life.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Yan Ruoxue is no longer with me. As for where she went, even I don’t know.”

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have thought of something.

He changed his words, “Oh, I heard that Yan Ruoxue went to the secret realm of the Yan family. You can go and take a look.”

“The secret realm of the Yan Family?”Wan guqiong frowned slightly and a trace of confusion flashed across his face.

It was obvious that Wan Guqiong knew nothing about the secret realm of the Yan family.

“Are You F * cking kidding me?”Wan guqiong’s face turned cold.

“The Yan family is a family in the secular world. How could there be a secret realm? !”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be secretly surprised when he saw this.

Even Wan Guqiong didn’t know about the Yan family’s secret realm? Then what exactly was the Yan family’s secret realm? Or, did they exist or not?

“Qin Yu, I don’t want to talk nonsense with you anymore. I’ll ask you slowly after I beat you into a cripple.”Wan guqiong’s face turned cold.

After he had finished speaking, Wan Gu Qiong took a step back and said with a sinister tone, “Qin Yu, today is the day you must die!”

The two martial saints immediately took a step forward and a wave of killing intent rippled out.

Although their internal Qi did not appear to be very strong, that invisible pressure made it difficult for people to resist.

Qin Yu looked at the two of them with a face full of vigilance. All of his trump cards were revealed in an instant.

This was because Qin Yu knew very well that if he did not treat this martial saint seriously, he would not even have the chance to live.

“Do you still need us to Act?”These two martial saints questioned coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said with a smile, “Of course not. I am willing to go back with you guys.”

“This kid is sinister and cunning. Let’s cripple him first.”Wan Gu Qiong said coldly from the side.

The two martial saints did not say anything else. One of them stepped forward.

Qin Yu had seen this person before. Previously, he had attacked Qin Yu at the exchange meet.

New and old grudges erupted at this moment.

“Qin Yu, last time, you used your Yin Heart to gain all the limelight. You made us lose all our face. This time, I want you to pay back a hundredfold!”This martial saint said coldly.

“Uncle Zhen, don’t waste your breath on him. Get Rid of him immediately!”Wan Gu Qiong urged.

The martial saint who was called Uncle Zhen did not say anything else. He took large strides forward and his huge palm covered Qin Yu! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This palm contained immense power and was like a towering mountain that crushed towards Qin Yu!

Before the palm had arrived, the power had arrived first!

That power made one’s hair stand on end. It was like a raging wave that caused the ground under Qin Yu’s feet to directly shatter!

“One punch to break ten thousand arts!”

Qin Yu did not dare to be negligent in the slightest! With a furious roar, golden light surged out from his entire body along his arm!

All the power was concentrated on a single point on his fist, and then it surged like a tidal wave!

“Bang!”

A brilliant and brilliant golden light, like a blazing pillar of light, ruthlessly smashed towards that palm!

An earth-shattering power erupted in an instant!

Under Qin Yu’s one punch, the palm was actually knocked back repeatedly!

“Ah! ! !”

Qin Yu roared repeatedly as blue veins bulged on his forehead. It was as if he was channeling all the Qi force in his body!

“Boom!”

Finally, that palm that had been condensed by a martial saint was shattered by a single punch!

When Wan Gu Qiong saw this scene, his eyelids twitched and his face turned solemn.

A trace of surprise flashed across Uncle Zhen’s face.

It must be known that an ant below the martial saint stage would be like a completely different world as long as it did not step into the martial saint stage.

However, this ant before him had shattered his palm. How could he not be shocked!

“You have some ability.”Uncle Zhen raised his eyebrows and said with some admiration.

Qin Yu panted heavily, and bean-sized sweat kept dripping down his face.

On the other hand, Uncle Zhen was calm and didn’t seem to be injured at all.

“Uncle Zhen, quickly cripple this child!”Wan Gu Qiong urged again.

Uncle Zhen nodded. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “I have to say, you do have some ability, but the current you is still too weak.”

Qin Yu was not in the mood to listen to his nonsense. He quickly mobilized his internal Qi and prepared to receive the next attack.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu spat out another mouthful of blood from his mouth. The world in front of his eyes was spinning as he sat on the ground.

“Damn, the DAO injury actually acted up at this time...”Qin Yu could not help but curse in his heart.

He wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and got up from the ground.

Qin Yu looked at the martial saint who was not far away with vigilance. He could not help but take two steps back.

Uncle Zhen’s palm moved slightly. Waves of internal Qi surged in his palm like a swimming dragon.

His every move seemed to contain the power to overturn rivers and seas. His majestic moves could be completed in a breath’s time!

This was the martial saint’s ability. It completely surpassed the Martial Marquis’ability!

“Just now, I only used 50% of my strength. This time, I used 80% . Can you still hold on?”Uncle Zhen grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.
