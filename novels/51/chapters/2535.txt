2536 Invitation

“May I know who you are?”

Qin Yu asked in a puzzle.

“Shen Qian of Divine Will Sect.”

She smiled and introduced the mirror to Qin Yu.

“This is the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror, the supreme treasure of our Divine Will Sect. It can conceal the secrets of heaven and even distort space and time. Even a Saint can’t track our location. This is also why you couldn’t sense us when we approached you. But of course, there are limitations. This treasure can only accommodate seven persons. Therefore, we would like you to come with us.”

“It’s not that easy to hide from the prying eyes of the Saint with just a treasure.”

Qin Yu shook his head. He had just entered the Saint’s world and knew how terrifying the power of the Saint was.

If they truly explore this area, even with this heaven-defying treasure, they probably could not escape from the probing of a sixth-level Saint.”

“Just say it if you don’t dare. Why are you talking so much nonsense? Don’t waste time here.”

A slightly sharp voice sounded. A young man from the Heavenly Divination Sect sneered and said.

“Zhang Xiang shut up. Have you forgotten our mission?”

Another person from the Heavenly Divination Sect, Li Yang, frowned and scolded.

Only now did Qin Yu have the time to comprehend these people’s cultivation. There were four at the fifth level and two at the peak of the fourth level.

Moreover, by checking their soul fluctuations, these people had tremendously formidable cultivation. They should all be core disciples in the sect.

“I’m sorry, friends, please leave. We’re meeting for the first time, and I’m unfamiliar with any of you. Regarding the invitation, as Brother Xiang has said, I’m afraid I dare not accept it.”

Qin Yu said with a smile. Even if he were to go alone, he was unwilling to act with these people.

The reason was simple. When it came to a life-or-death battle, he could not afford to trust these newly acquainted individuals.

Moreover, Brother Xiang had potent attack power. There was no way he would travel alongside someone so narrow-minded.

“It’s indeed as you said. A single magical artifact might not be able to resist the prying of the Saint. However, the human race experts are also taking action in different regions. When the higher-ups of the alien race are injured, they will return empty-handed in the worst case. If you’re worried that we will betray you, we can all swear in our dao minds that once we enter the Misty Forest, everyone will advance and retreat together. Otherwise, our cultivation will no longer advance in our lives.”

Xuan Xin said after a moment of silence.

“Why must you drag me along?”

Qin Yu still had a good impression of this person from the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

“We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity on this trip. We’ve planned this move for many years. Youngest Martial Uncle Jian Feishuang has initially wanted to travel with us. However, the Youngest Martial Uncle was severely injured in the battle of the Holy Region and the alien race. This trip requires someone to replace Youngest Martial Uncle’s position. Therefore, I implore my friend Qin Yu to travel with us.”

“Hey, Xuan Xin, you’ve gone too far. Why are you explaining such a confidential matter to this fellow so clearly?”

Zhang Xiang obviously looked a little unhappy.

“Shut up!”

Li Yang could not take it anymore. A shroud on his back flew with a whoosh into the air and turned into the size of a sanitary napkin, sticking to Zhang Xiang’s mouth.

“Moreover, after settling this matter, I can give my friend a piece of Heavenly Soul Jade!”

Xuan Xin hesitated for a moment before saying softly.

Upon hearing “Heavenly Soul Jade,” the surrounding individuals immediately revealed expressions of astonishment and disbelief.

Although Qin Yu did not know what it was, from the expressions of the people before him, it should be something extraordinary.

“Agree to his request!”

A loud shout suddenly exploded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, almost scaring Qin Yu into peeing his pants.

Immortal Emperor Yao panted heavily. At this moment, he stared at Xuan Xin as if looking at a beauty about to undress herself.

“Quickly agree! If you get the Heavenly Soul Jade, I’ll help you solve three problems, no, ten!”

Qin Yu gasped. What exactly was it that could make an immortal emperor value it so much?

“The Heavenly Soul Jade is a gem refined from the soul of a Saint when he dies. It contains endless soul energy. Holding the Heavenly Soul Jade can quickly restore and strengthen the soul. The center of its power contains endless divine power and wisdom, which can completely restore the damaged soul and increase the extraordinary strength of the soul.”

Shen Qian seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s doubts and explained with a smile.

“Furthermore, according to the records of the Divine Will Sect, there are nine pieces of Heavenly Soul Jades in the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes in your hand. The Coffin of Nine Lifetimes was created with this as the foundation.”

“This time, apart from killing the alien race as much as possible, our three sects also have our respective missions. The Misty Forest is the closest to the monster race’s Path of Heaven. There are many supreme treasures in it, but there is also dangerous murderous intent. I must tell you these in advance. Even with our strength, we might still be in danger of dying.”

Xuan Xin explained again, telling Qin Yu some of the truth.

“Alright, I agree.”

Qin Yu finally understood the urgency of Immortal Emperor Yao. Perhaps Immortal Emperor Yao could survive in this world longer with Heavenly Soul Jade. No wonder he was so anxious.

“Alright, please settle some of your things and try not to let too many people know about your departure. You must keep this trip confidential. We’ll set off together tomorrow at this time.”

Xuan Xin cupped his fists and said.

Qin Yu nodded and watched the group of six leave.

“I guess this trip is probably not simple. To make four fifth-level experts with supreme treasure recruit me to make them feel safe, what area is this Misty Forest?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and kept pondering. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

There were a few reasons why he agreed. One was because the Heavenly Soul Jade was something that Immortal Emperor Yao urgently needed.

Moreover, his power of the curse of the sorcerer tribe had also discovered that Flame Demon was currently in the coordinates of this Misty Forest.

If he could borrow the Primordial Sky Concealing Mirror and their strength, he might be able to kill Flame Demon in one fell swoop. At that time, he could get Juan Liu’s help to condense the source of poison.

Thirdly, as Xuan Xin had said, it could weaken the power of the alien race to the greatest extent.

If a war was unavoidable in the future, then this battle was necessary.

It might solve the three major problems he was facing now. However, he felt a faint sense of unease.

“Elder Guai, Wanqing, Peak Master, come over for a moment. I have something to discuss with you.”

Qin Yu shook his head and discarded the messy thoughts out of his mind.

He told the three of them about it and let them temporarily manage Human Race Watch.

He did not know how long he would be away this time, so he had to settle these things first. Otherwise, there would definitely be chaos.

“Don’t worry. With the three of us here, there won’t be any chaos. With our strength, we can lead Human Race Watch to gain experience. You have to be careful. The Misty Forest isn’t a good place.”

When Gu Wanqing heard about the Misty Forest, her expression turned solemn instantly.
