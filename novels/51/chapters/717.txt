The promise made by the man with the mustache made Qin Yu more worried.

“In other words, he has the advantage in terms of physique,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

The man with the mustache waved his hand and said, “That’s not true. The special physique of human cultivators isn’t inferior to that of the Heaven Swallowing Python.”

“Take you for example. If you two were at the same level, who knows what would happen.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “There’s no need to be at the same level. As long as I step into the late stage of the Marquis Realm, I Won’t be afraid of his Heaven Swallowing Python.”

“I don’t refute that.” The man with the mustache spread his hands and said.

“Let’s not talk about this.” Qin Yu changed the topic and continued to ask, “Do you know how to open the Mystic Realm?”

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “If I knew how to open the Mystic Realm, I wouldn’t need to come here.”

Qin Yu frowned.

He didn’t expect that even the man with the mustache didn’t know about the Mystic Realm.

“Alright, Don’t Talk to me if you have nothing to do these few days. I don’t want to be implicated,” the man with the mustache muttered.

After saying this, he walked away happily.

After taking two steps, the man with the mustache suddenly stopped and said, “Where’s the little girl by your side?”

“Little girl?” Qin Yu was stunned.

“Are you talking about Xiao Yu?”

The man with the mustache nodded and said, “That’s right. The people of the Han Palace have their eyes on her. Why didn’t you bring her here?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment.

The man with the mustache’s words were indeed reasonable. After all, this was the territory of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. It was likely that the Han Palace wouldn’t dare to come and act impudently.

“I’ll go back and pick her up now,” Qin Yu said.

Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, a voice suddenly came from within the academy.

The voice seemed to be transmitted through some kind of spell and came from all directions.

“Everyone, go to the square.”

The person only said a few words.

Qin Yu immediately walked towards the square.

The square was already filled with people.

Xia Hang and Granny Qin were already standing in front of them.

“Why are they suddenly calling us to gather?” Chang Mang frowned.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m not sure.”

After about ten minutes, Granny Qin finally spoke.

She glanced at the crowd and said nonchalantly, “I believe that everyone has heard about the Mystic Realm. As the leader of the martial arts world, we will announce the Mystic Realm that we control to the public.”

Hearing this, almost everyone present became excited.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and waited for Granny Qin to continue.

Granny Qin continued, “The first opening of the Mystic Realm will be in half a month’s time. I hope that everyone will arrive on time.”

“Half a month? That long?” Chang Mang couldn’t help but frown.

It wasn’t just Chang Mang. Almost everyone couldn’t help but complain.

“Half a month? That’s too long.”

“Didn’t they say it was just these few days?”

“Why did the timeline have to be extended for so long?”

Everyone complained, but Qin Yu remained silent.

“Half a month?”

Qin Yu frowned.

This number seemed somewhat familiar.

A moment later, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He took out his phone and calculated the time.

As expected, half a month later was the day that the ten-thousand-year-old divine herb was born! It just happened to clash with the Mystic Realm’s time!

Qin Yu looked up at Granny Qin and suddenly had some doubts in his heart.

Could it be... that Granny Qin also got the news? So she deliberately opened the Mystic Realm half a month later?

One had to know that a stalk of ten-thousand-year-old herbs had extraordinary significance. Even the Mystic Realm couldn’t be compared to it.

Once a herb reached 10,000 years old, it would step into another level.

Even a 9,999-year-old herb would be worlds apart from a 10,000-year-old herb.

“Is it a coincidence, or is it intentional?” Qin Yu frowned.

He looked at Granny Qin and shouted, “Are you going to lead the team to the Mystic Realm?”

Granny Qin glanced at Qin Yu coldly and said, “President Xia and three purple-robed men will lead the team.”

“What about you?” Qin Yu continued to ask.

Granny Qin looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Do I need to report to you what I do?”

After saying this, Granny Qin snorted coldly and ignored Qin Yu. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu touched his chin and said in a low voice, “This... doesn’t seem like a coincidence.”

This put Qin Yu in a dilemma for a moment.

Qin Yu was filled with curiosity towards the Mystic Realm.

Although he had been to the Mystic Realm of the Hong Yi Sect last time, the resources of that Mystic Realm had long been exhausted.

However, the temptation of these 10,000-year-old herbs were even greater to Qin Yu!

As long as he obtained this 10,000-year-old herb, Qin Yu would be able to step into the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm, even to the peak!

Once he stepped into the peak stage, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would be like entering an uninhabited realm to Qin Yu!

Qin Yu also planned to attack the Jingdu Martial Arts Association after he stepped into the late-stage of the Martial Marquis realm and save people!

“Forget it.” After hesitating over and over again, Qin Yu finally decided to give up on this trip to the Mystic Realm and focus on the ten-thousand-year-old medicinal herbs that would be born.

After the meeting ended, Qin Yu found the man with the mustache.

He grabbed the man with the mustache, who wanted to escape, and said in a deep voice, “You don’t have to be so nervous. With your ability, I believe that the Heaven Swallowing Python can’t do anything to you.”

The man with the mustache muttered, “You can’t say that. I know nothing except for archaeology.”

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to argue with him. Instead, he said in a cold voice, “Let me ask you, is there any way to resurrect the two male corpses?”

The man with the mustache widened his eyes and said, “Are you crazy? You think too highly of me! Last time, I spent a lot of effort to help you!”

“Is there really no way?” Qin Yu frowned and said.

The man with the mustache shook his head and said, “There’s no way. If we continue to forcefully resurrect them, those two male corpses will very likely develop their own consciousness.”

“When that time comes, it will be a disaster for the entire world.”

Qin Yu fell silent.

If two mighty figure corpses were to develop their own consciousness, it would really be a disaster.

Not to mention martial artists, even modern weapons couldn’t do anything to them.

“Looks like I can only rely on myself,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The man with the mustache pulled Qin Yu’s arm and said, “Are you thinking of bad ideas?”

Qin Yu sized up the man with the mustache and said with a smile, “Let me discuss something seriously with you. If you can find a way to open the Mystic Realm, I can tell you a secret. How about it?”

“A way to open the Mystic Realm?” The man with the mustache touched his chin, as if he was weighing the pros and cons.

“It seems that this man with the mustache really has a way to open the Mystic Realm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

The man with the mustache opened his mouth and was about to speak when a figure walked toward the two of them.

Seeing this figure, the man with the mustache hurriedly took two steps back and ran away.
