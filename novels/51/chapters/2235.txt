2236 The Six-Tailed Fox King

Piao Ruoyun whispered to Qin Yu.

Piao Ruoyun led Qin Yu to the edge and slowly searched. She seemed to be quite experienced.

After a day, they only found two six-tailed demon foxes.

“This is too inefficient.”

Qin Yu said with a frown. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Nonsense. Only idiots would dare to act recklessly in this seventh level. Using divine sense to search is equivalent to seeking death. This rate is considered acceptable.”

Piao Ruoyun rolled her eyes. She had never thought that Qin Yu did that the last time.

The number of six-tailed foxes was relatively small. In addition, they had many hiding methods, so it was hard to find them.

Along the way, the two collaborated and killed quite several demonic beasts at the edge.

“Wait, I want to collect this bone cultivation water!”

After clearing the demonic beasts in the area, there happened to be a small hole filled with blood-red bone cultivation water.

“No, the demon kings are all monitoring the water at this place. We’ll be in danger if they notice us.”

Piao Ruoyun frowned and said.

“I came here for bone cultivation water. If you can’t accept it, then we’ll part ways.”

Qin Yu shook his head. His purpose was bone cultivation water.

At the moment, he did not have a great need for the inner cores of these demonic beasts.

“This bone cultivation water is tremendously useful to the demon race, but humans can only absorb spiritual power after refining it. Unless you have a special method, it’s easy for it to backfire on you.”

Piao Ruoyun looked at Qin Yu with a puzzled expression. Seeing Qin Yu’s determined look, she hesitated for a moment before continuing.

“If you must collect bone cultivation water, you must listen to my commands. You can only take one-third of the water from each pool, and you can only take it from the edges. The bone cultivation water in the middle is occupied by powerful demon kings. Once surrounded, it will be very difficult to escape.”

“Alright, I’ll listen to you.”

Qin Yu nodded. Although this little girl was careless, she was quite honest.

“Water Mirror Space.”

A ripple appeared near Piao Ruoyun. Under Piao Ruoyun’s control, the power of her soul formed a mirror space.

The nearby demonic beasts walked over and did not discover the two people inside at all.

“Hurry up!”

Piao Ruoyun urged anxiously.

Qin Yu suppressed the joy in his heart. The energy of the Sumeru ring in his mind wrapped around the river, and the bone cultivation water poured into the Sumeru Space. Soon, one-third of the bone cultivation water was sucked into the Sumeru Space.

“F*ck, it’s awesome. Previously, for a cauldron of bone cultivation water, I was almost hammered to death by that giant ape!”

Qin Yu was ecstatic deep down.

“Let’s go to the next place.”

Qin Yu suppressed the ecstasy in her heart and said.

“Hmph, I’m at a losing end. I’ve only taken a few six-tailed fox inner cores so far.”

Piao Ruoyun said angrily.

“Haha, maybe we’ll meet more demon foxes later.”

Qin Yu was in a good mood.

The two slowly swept over along the edge. This time, it was really as Qin Yu had said. They encountered five demon foxes. With the cooperation of the two of them, they soon hunted the five demon foxes.

Piao Ruoyun obtained the inner cores and was much happier. This time, a sizable river appeared before Qin Yu.

“Hurry up, we’re already close to the central region. I’m afraid my Water Mirror Space can’t confuse the demon kings.”

Piao Ruoyun urged.

Qin Yu did not talk nonsense. He frantically filled the Sumeru Space with bone cultivation water.

“Boom!”

The Water Mirror Space suddenly cracked. A mammoth-sized giant elephant, several hundred meters tall, broke through the Water Mirror Space and appeared before them.

“D*mn it!”

Piao Ruoyun’s expression changed drastically.

“Moo!”

The mammoth-sized gian elephant raised its legs and swung its huge front legs down, causing a terrifying shockwave to spread from the ground.

The terrifying shockwave caused the ground to churn like waves, and the hard ground instantly turned into countless pieces of gravel.

Qin Yu’s expression changed. Under the cosmic form, a giant foot stepped on it.

The terrifying force directly neutralized the shock wave.

“How dare you kill the people of my demon fox clan and steal the blood water of Bone Cultivation River!”

The mammoth-sized giant elephant s pupils were pale as if it had no pupils. It looked tremendously eerie.

“D*mn it! It’s the six-tailed fox demon king! It controlled the mammoth-sized giant elephant.”

Piao Ruoyun’s expression changed drastically.

“Get ready to retreat!”

Piao Ruoyun’s dagger let out a sharp whistle and suddenly turned into a golden light, instantly splitting the mammoth into halves.

“Hmm? Why does it smell so familiar?”

Xuan Yuan, who was cultivating in the Bone Cultivation Water, frowned.

Almost at the same time, four mammoth-sized giant elephants stepped into the Water Mirror Space and surrounded them.

The surrounding demonic beasts with powerful internal qi seemed to have sensed the commotion here and were attracted over.

“Boom!”

The four mammoth-sized giant elephants stomped down, and four massive shockwaves blasted toward Piao Ruoyun.

A massive shockwave erupted from the center. Qin Yu pulled Piao Ruoyun over and stomped on the shockwave to extinguish it.

A giant white ape suddenly landed not far from them as if it had smelled the fluctuations here.

“D*mn it! This white ape is the king of the seventh level! I’m going to use the Water Mirror Space to confuse it. You have to protect me, or we’ll be doomed!”

Piao Ruoyun’s expression changed drastically. She bit her finger and spat a mouthful of blood essence onto the power of his soul.

In an instant, countless massive mirrors appeared within a radius of a thousand meters.

Qin Yu did not dare to hold back at this moment. He punched in the air, and the massive force directly blew up the heads of the four mammoth-sized giant elephants.

“You’re quite capable.”

An enormous demon fox slowly appeared before Qin Yu and Piao Ruoyun. Its body gradually became clear as if it had been here for a long time.

“Demon Fox King!”

Piao Ruoyun’s face was ashen. She would still have a chance to escape even if she could not fight it if it were just a single Demon Fox King.

However, the king of the seventh level, the white ape, was outside the Water Mirror Space. She had to fully control the Water Mirror Space.

“You control the Water Mirror Space. I will deal with this demon fox.”

Qin Yu said coldly.

“Hahaha!”

The six-tailed demon fox laughed wildly.

A massive power of the soul surged from its sea of consciousness. The dark green soul power turned into seawater and surged into the sky. The terrifying fluctuation was like the rolling dark clouds of the thunder tribulation.

If Piao Ruoyun did not set up the Water Mirror Space with all her might, all the demonic beasts on the seventh level would have been drawn over.

“What a terrifying power of divine sense! As expected of a soul-cultivating demonic beast.”

Qin Yu frowned.

“Fist of Destruction!”

Qin Yu threw a punch. The wind from the fist that was burning with black fire landed on the six-tailed fox’s body but only burned a phantom.

The power of the soul surged violently and formed a massive demon fox figure tens of thousands of feet tall.

The giant demon fox suddenly raised its fist and punched Qin Yu.
