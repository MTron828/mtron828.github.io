Chapter 454: Heaven Rank Cultivation Technique! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

As the huge hand crushed down, the dust on the ground began to stir up.

The large area of the ground completely collapsed before turning into a huge pit!

Qin Yu’s body was also continuously sinking down.

The endless pressure caused Qin Yu’s body to begin to creak!

Qin Yu raised his head to look at the huge hand, and a trace of desire actually appeared in his eyes.

It was the desire for power! It was the desire for victory!

“Half-step Martial Marquis...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice. Following that, his battle intent rose, and golden light erupted once again. He raised both of his hands to confront it!

“Rumble...”

However, Qin Yu’s power only slowed down the crushing force of the huge hand by half a second, and then it continued to descend!

“Ah!!!”

Qin Yu raised his head and roared. Due to the enormous strength, blood flowed out of Qin Yu’s seven orifices, and even his pores were covered in blood!

This strength was too strong. The gap between a half-step Martial Marquis and an Inner Strength Grandmaster was astonishing!

“Boom!”

Finally, the giant palm slammed down fiercely.

The entire ground had turned into ruins.

Countless dust-covered everyone’s vision and made it impossible for them to see through it.

Meng Wuxiong snorted coldly and said, “He’s just so-so. It seems that I can report to Mr. He.”

After saying that, Meng Wuxiong waved his hand and casually said, “Go and see if he has been smashed into meat paste.”

“Yes, Mr. Meng.” The Inner Strength Grandmaster beside him withstood the enormous pressure and walked towards the huge pit.

“Bang!”

However, just as he walked forward, a golden palm reached out and grabbed his neck before lifting him into the air!

“Huh...”

The Inner Strength Grandmaster immediately let out a painful wail. Before he could struggle, Qin Yu’s palm had already covered him.

In a short while, the Inner Strength Grandmaster turned into a pile of dry bones.

“Huh? He didn’t die?” Meng Wuxiong narrowed his eyes, and the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but reveal a playful smirk.

As the dust fell, Qin Yu’s figure finally appeared. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

One could see that his blood was boiling, and his killing intent was seething. A strange internal qi swept through the entire manor.

His eyes turned fiery red, and the killing intent in his eyes was unconcealed!

“This is... the power of the Divine Dragon?” Meng Wuxiong seemed to have guessed something.

He Teng had once said that the effect of the power of the Divine Dragon was beyond imagination, and it could even allow one to fight against opponents of a higher level!

Because this was the purest power in the world in the current era!

“Impressive.” Meng Wuxiong rubbed his fists while showing no fear at all!

“I really want to see what’s so special about the Divine Dragon power that Mr. He thinks so highly of!”

Qin Yu slowly walked out from the dust.

At first glance, he seemed to have changed into a different person. His otherworldly temperament made him look like an immortal.

However, the murderous internal qi all over his body made him look like a devil.

Then, Qin Yu extended his palm, and the Venerable Fifth Mountain hung above Qin Yu’s head.

“Hehe, keep putting on a pretense.” Meng Wuxiong didn’t take Qin Yu seriously at all.

After all, the gap between an Inner Strength Grandmaster and a half-step Martial Marquis was too difficult to make up for.

“Come, let me see the full strength of a half-step Martial Marquis,” Qin Yu said quietly.

These words infuriated Meng Wuxiong. He narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Do you think you’re qualified to see the full strength of a half-step Martial Marquis?”

Qin Yu put his hands behind his back and no longer paid attention to Meng Wuxiong’s incessant chatter.

He even closed his eyes and put his hands behind his back.

“Ha... hahahaha!” Meng Wuxiong couldn’t help but burst into laughter when he saw this!

He pointed at Qin Yu and sneered. “You really know how to act. Do you think that you can compete with a half-step Martial Marquis after you possess the power of the Divine Dragon? How naive!”

“You talk too much nonsense,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Meng Wuxiong was completely enraged. He stomped his feet and rushed toward Qin Yu!

It was the same punch again! His fist was surging with inner strength!

“Crack!”

However, this incomparably fierce fist was easily caught by Qin Yu!

“Huh?” Meng Wuxiong’s expression changed. His huge body suddenly shook and he struggled free.

Then, Meng Wuxiong took a few steps back and said with narrowed eyes, “The power of the Divine Dragon... is quite interesting. No wonder Mr. He thinks so highly of it.”

Qin Yu looked at Meng Wuxiong coldly and said, “If you don’t use all of your strength, I’m afraid you won’t have a chance.”

Meng Wuxiong sneered and said, “You actually saw through it... well, then I’ll let you experience the true ability of a half-step Martial Marquis!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he saw Meng Wuxiong raise both of his hands.

In an instant, there seemed to be traces of dao patterns resonating in the air!

It was shocking and mind-blowing.

Then, Meng Wuxiong casually smacked him.

In an instant, it seemed as if thousands of troops and horses were charging over!

It was just a casual strike, but it was extremely powerful! It made it impossible for anyone to escape!

Qin Yu’s expression was cold as he raised his hand and used the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

Qin Yu, who had activated the power of the Divine Dragon, had a qualitative change in his strength.

This punch instantly shattered this huge hand!

However, Meng Wuxiong wasn’t surprised. He snorted lightly and said, “This is just an appetizer. Qin Yu, watch carefully!”

After he finished speaking, Meng Wuxiong’s body began to shake. In front of him, a huge runic diagram actually appeared!

This runic diagram flickered with a dark light. No one dared to look at this extraordinary internal qi!

“Thousand Revolution Seal!”

Following Meng Wuxiong’s loud shout, this runic diagram rapidly pressed down!

“Swoosh!”

Countless runic lines made it impossible for anyone to dodge.

Its terrifying power was almost able to cut through the void!

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn. He didn’t dare to conceal his internal qi anymore. He immediately adjusted his internal qi and muttered in a low voice, “I have no choice but to use that move.”

This move was originally reserved for Han Wei, but at this moment, Qin Yu had no other choice.

He used all his strength.

Strands of strange internal qi gathered on his hands.

Following that, purple flames wrapped around his hands!

Qin Yu’s dantian’s internal qi was circulating at an extremely fast speed.

In an instant, the spiritual energy in his body was actually depleted, and it was all recorded on his palms!

“This technique is called the Spiritual Fire Seal. Only those with spiritual fire can use it, but its power is invincible,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Come, let me see the power of a half-step Martial Marquis!”

Following Qin Yu’s angry roar, the Spiritual Fire Seal in front of him was formed!

It was a purple portrait that seemed to have been passed down from ancient times!

The portrait that was formed from the most powerful purple spiritual fire in the world was burning on Qin Yu’s palm!

“Go, Spiritual Fire Seal.”

Qin Yu only pulled his palm lightly, but the power that could destroy the world exploded at this moment!
