Chapter 827: Portrait of the Guardian

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Teng Hui was dragged into the toilet by Qin Yu.

Even though Teng Hui struggled with all his might, it was to no avail.

Everyone was also delighted to see this and had a mocking smile on their faces.

A few minutes later.

A pig-like wail came from the toilet.

“Qin Yu, I will definitely kill you!!!” Teng Hui’s hoarse roar spread throughout the entire Jingdu Martial Arts Association. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Qin Yu clapped his hands and walked straight to the door.

“Brother Qin, did you really let him eat sh*t?” Zhuang Teng asked with some doubt.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “As a man, I naturally have to keep my word.”

He walked all the way to the door.

At the door, he met a young man.

This young man was none other than Gu Xinghe.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, I’m here to give you an ultimatum.”

“If you have something to say, just say it,” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Gu Xinghe said indifferently, “Hand over Yan Ruoxue and I can spare you. I can even let you enter the second Mystic Realm. What do you think?”

Qin Yu grinned and said, “Hand over your mother and I can spare your dog life. But you have to ask your father if he agrees.”

“You!” Gu Xinghe’s face suddenly turned red and his whole body trembled with anger.

Qin Yu sneered. “You’re just a retard, so don’t come looking for trouble.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Gu Xinghe was so angry that his entire body trembled. He glared in Qin Yu’s direction, and a vicious look flashed across his eyes.

“When will Qin Yu’s Martial Saint’s power disappear?” He asked the old man beside him.

The old man said, “Qin Yu’s Martial Saint’s power will disappear in half a month.”

“Okay!” Gu Xinghe’s expression was vicious.

“Let him be arrogant for a few days. After his Martial Saint’s power disappears, I will kill him myself!”

...

Qin Yu said goodbye to everyone, then got into the Yao family’s car and rushed towards the Yao family.

On the way, Yao Meng smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, have you noticed that ever since Gu Xinghe appeared, the conflict between the aristocratic families and ordinary martial artists seems to have decreased a lot?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, this is the transfer of the conflict, but this is also temporary. Deep down in your bones, you also look down on ordinary people.”

Yao Meng sighed slightly and said, “The difference in living environment will naturally create a difference in mentality. In fact, it is hard to avoid this.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu looked at Yao Meng and sneered. “Yan Ruoxue isn’t like this. This is also the difference between her and you.”

Yao Meng was stunned and was immediately speechless.

Although she and Yan Ruoxue were friends, if she were to ask herself, Yao Meng would definitely not choose the ordinary Qin Yu like Yan Ruoxue did.

She didn’t have the courage and boldness.

The car drove all the way to the Yao family.

The residence of the Yao family looked quite ordinary. It was a villa in Yan City.

Although it was also a mansion, it was much shabby compared to the manor of other families.

Yao Meng invited Qin Yu to a round table in the courtyard and sat down. At this time, there was already a person waiting at the round table.

This person was none other than Wan Guqiong.

“Brother Qin, we meet again,” Wan Guqiong said with a smile.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “If you want to talk to me about Yan Ruoxue, I advise you not to speak.”

Wan Guqiong shook his head helplessly and said, “Are you that cautious? Yan Ruoxue...”

“I told you to shut up!”

Before Wan Guqiong could finish his words, Qin Yu’s body emitted a strong murderous aura!

After feeling this murderous aura, Wan Guqiong couldn’t help but frown slightly.

“Guqiong, don’t say anything more.” Yao Meng shook her head.

Wan Guqiong took a deep breath and had no choice but to shut up.

Yao Meng held a cup of tea and poured a cup for the two of them. Then, she smiled and said, “Mr. Qin, please have some tea.”

“Miss Yao, everyone is very busy. Let’s get straight to the point,” Qin Yu said.

Yao Meng nodded and said with a smile, “I do know a little bit about the Guardian.”

“It’s said that the Guardian signed a contract with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and requested that the Martial Saint not be born. Since then, there has been no Martial Saint in the world.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “But what I don’t understand is, why is it that no one in the world can step into the Martial Saint Realm?”

At this moment, Wan Guqiong, who was at the side, added, “It’s nothing more than the restrictions of the natural environment.”

“Natural environment?” Qin Yu glanced at him. “Then why are the people in the Mystic Realm unable to step into the Martial Saint Realm?”

Wan Guqiong smiled faintly and said, “Qin Yu, do you really think that the Mystic Realm is another world? To put it bluntly, it’s just a home built by the strong.”

“Home?” Qin Yu frowned.

Wan Guqiong said, “It’s like someone living in a villa and someone living in a shanty town. But they’re still in this world.”

“The Mystic Realm is just a space created by oneself. This space isn’t stable. Compared to the real world, the difference is like heaven and earth.”

“If you are strong enough, you can shatter a Mystic Realm.”

Qin Yu suddenly understood.

“Then who is this guardian? What kind of strength does he have?” Qin Yu was puzzled.

Yao Meng smiled and said, “According to rumors, a guardian is someone who protects a world. Those who can become a guardian are all top-notch people. Their strength is unimaginable.”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said with puzzlement, “Then who is the person who chose the Guardian?”

Yao Meng and Wan Guqiong pointed at the sky at the same time.

“The Heavenly Dao?” Qin Yu said in surprise.

“That’s right.” Wan Guqiong nodded.

“Of course, these are all rumors. There’s another saying that the Guardian is only powerful because he has the responsibility to protect a world. That’s why he’s called the Guardian.”

“That’s right. After all, the stronger you are, the greater the responsibility.” Yao Meng also nodded.

Qin Yu fell into silence, not saying anything for a long time.

“The two of you, do you know who this guardian is?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Yao Meng didn’t say anything, but looked at Wan Guqiong.

Wan Guqiong smiled and said, “I do have a portrait of the Guardian at home. If you want to see it, I can take you to see it.”

“Really?” Qin Yu hurriedly stood up.

Wan Guqiong nodded and said, “Of course. If you are willing, we can leave now.”

“To the Mystic Realm?” Qin Yu asked.

“That’s right.” Wan Guqiong nodded slightly.

Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Qin Yu knew nothing about the Mystic Realm that Wan Guqiong mentioned.

No one knew if there was a Martial Saint in this Mystic Realm.

More importantly, Qin Yu didn’t know Wan Guqiong’s intentions. If he went, he probably wouldn’t be able to return.

“Mr. Wan, why don’t you bring this portrait out?” Qin Yu smiled.
