Chapter 1129: Chapter 1,129, the furious Tian Zong 

A Mighty Almighty had originally thought that he would be dealt a dimensional reduction blow, but unexpectedly, he was beaten into hiding in the void.

Not only Tian Zong, but even his disciple was the same.

“Weng!”

At this moment, rays of light shot out in all directions, and a burst of killing intent shot out from above Qin Yu!

The one who attacked was naturally Tian Zong. His skinny palm ruthlessly slapped onto Qin Yu’s head!

A huge force pressed down on Qin Yu and shot down explosively. His body directly plunged into the soil!

Without waiting for Qin Yu to make a move, Tian Zong once again escaped into the void.

Not far away, Chang Mang’s situation was similar to Qin Yu’s. Tian Zong and Qin Yu seemed to have used the same tactic.

Qin Yu rubbed his head. He felt a little pain.

“Playing dirty?”Qin Yu could not help but sneer.

Chang Mang, who was not far away, went crazy. His blood-red fist kept smashing around, shaking the space until it was rumbling.

However, all of this was useless. How could the two people hiding in the air be hit by Chang Mang’s fist.

Qin Yu shot out from the soil, looking around quietly.

“Swoosh!”

Another sharp blade came out from the void, only piercing into Qin Yu’s glabella!

In such a short distance, Qin Yu’s head was sliced open as he easily dodged it!

“How is this possible!”

Tian Zong, who was hiding in the void, had a drastic change in expression!

At such a close distance, even a mighty figure would not be able to dodge it, unless he had predicted his actions beforehand!

Tian Zong did not believe it. He once again approached Qin Yu and grabbed at the location of Qin Yu’s Dantian from such a close distance.

“Swoosh!”

However, just as he stretched out his hand, Qin Yu shot backward explosively.

This caused Tian Zong to miss again!

“Huh?”Tian Zong’s expression changed drastically, and he had a faint ominous premonition in his heart!

One could be said to be lucky, but to dodge it twice in a row, this was not something that could be explained by luck!

“Could it be... that he can see me?”Tian Zong was somewhat shocked.

He did not believe it, so he raised his hands and conjured a spell. A streak of light tore through the air and slashed at Qin Yu once more!

But this time, Qin Yu still managed to dodge it!

“Not good, this brat can definitely see me!”Tian Zong’s face changed drastically!

To Dodge it three times in a row, this was definitely not luck!

“I have waited for a thousand years before the opening of the Saint Realm. I can not allow any accidents to happen at this moment!”Tian Zong’s thoughts spun wildly in his mind, and cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

Not far away, Yun Long was still playing with Chang Mang.

But at this moment, Tian Zong couldn’t care less about Yun long. Without even thinking, he turned around and was about to run!

“What? A Mighty Almighty is actually hiding in the air and planning to escape?”

Qin Yu’s voice entered Tian Zong’s ears!

This made Tian Zong even more determined! Qin Yu could see him!

“F * ck you!”

Tian Zong cursed in his heart. He increased his speed to the maximum and planned to leave.

At this time, he did not care about his reputation anymore. Nothing was more important than his life!

“Swoosh!”

But at this moment, Qin Yu stepped on the ‘xing’word formula and instantly caught up!

Tian Zong did not dare to think too much and tried his best to escape.

Qin Yu sneered again and again. He slowly clenched his fist and threw out a punch that could break all laws!

Then, he saw Qin Yu clench his fist and ruthlessly smash it in a certain direction!

That terrifying fist force instantly exploded in the air! It was like a bomb that came from the sky!

The destructive power shook all directions and no one could stop it!

Even the Void was trembling. A powerful force pierced through the void and smashed onto Tian Zong’s body!

Tian Zong, who only cared about escaping, had no strength to resist at all. This punch ruthlessly smashed onto his body! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The void seemed to have been shattered. Tian Zong, who was hiding in the void, immediately fell out and spat out blood non-stop!

When everyone saw this, they were all shocked!

Qin Yu’s punch actually directly shook Tian Zong out! And it injured him!

“The Almighty realm seems to be just so-so!”Someone thought to himself.

“Bullsh * t, that’s because the person who attacked is Qin Yu! Go Up and try, I Won’t beat your head to pieces!”

Everyone was shocked by Tian Zong’s decline, but they were more shocked by Qin Yu’s strength!

It was unheard of for Qin Yu, who was at the middle stage of the martial saint realm, to be able to fight against an Almighty!

“You... how did you do it!”Tian Zong wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said somewhat unwillingly.

Qin Yu pointed at his glabella and said, “Not long ago, I just obtained a treasure called the desolate divine eye.”

“Desolate divine eye? !”Tian Zong’s expression changed as he exclaimed, “It’s the eye of the legendary ancient god?”

“You know quite a lot,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Tian Zong wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He looked at his body and found that there were cracks in many parts of his body, and his ribs were exposed in his chest.

“The holy region is about to open. You and I are both from Earth. We will inevitably support each other in the future,”Tian Zong said coldly.

“I don’t want this strange flower. Just treat it as a gift for you and let me go. How about it?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I have already given you a chance, but you didn’t cherish it.”

Tian Zong immediately became furious and said, “Qin Yu, don’t go too far!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “When you wanted to wipe out the entire Heaven Gate, did you ever think of going too far? When you wanted to use me to refine pills, and then kill me after using me, did you ever think of going too far?”

Tian Zong clenched his teeth. He had never thought that he would encounter such a predicament when he had just been born!

“Qin Yu, I have the honor to get acquainted with a big shot in the holy region. If you are willing to let me go, I can recommend you to get acquainted with him!”Tian Zong continued to throw out his conditions.

Qin Yu sneered, “Do you think I need it!”

Tian Zong said furiously, “Don’t think that I am really afraid of You! If I Burn My Blood Essence, I will definitely be able to recover to the peak state. At that time, you will definitely die!”
