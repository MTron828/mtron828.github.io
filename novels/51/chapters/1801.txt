1802 Chaotic Body Shi Shiyue

“I just feel that it’s better to have him around. After all, he has a Saint Weapon,” Qin Yu said awkwardly.

Gu Sanchen smiled without saying anything and took Qin Yu to a seat in the tavern.

His reaction made Qin Yu somewhat nervous and even a little worried.

If he was exposed, all his previous efforts would be in vain.

Just then, Gu Sanchen said as if he knew some secrets, “Brother Qin, you have good connections. Yang Yu does have a Saint Weapon.”

!!

After Qin Yu heard these words, his heart sank.

Did he seriously have a Saint Weapon? This was the end, right? How was he going to kill him?

“Is that so? That’s… that’s awesome,” Qin Yu said.

“That’s true. If we have a Saint Weapon, our chances of survival will be much higher.” Gu Sanchen nodded

Qin Yu never considered entering Forbidden Zone, which was the graveyard for many True Saints.

Gu Sanchen came from the nine great aristocratic families, unlike Qin Yu, who was an imposter.

“Brother Qin, get ready. We will set off tomorrow,” Gu Sanchen said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, I got it. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After that, Gu Sanchen asked for tea and started chatting with Qin Yu.

Of course, Qin Yu would not miss this opportunity to gather some information. “Hey, who is the strongest among Zhongzhou’s nine great aristocratic families?” he asked.

Gu Sanchen laughed. “Nobody is the strongest. We’re all families under the protection of our ancestors. In terms of heritage, I think all of us are at the same level.”

Qin Yu nodded and continued to ask, “I heard that the princess of the Yan family is going to marry a chaotic body. Who is that? ”

“You don’t even know who the chaotic body is?” Gu Sanchen asked in surprise.

“I’ve heard of him but don’t know much,” Qin Yu said as if he didn’t care.

Gu Sanchen sipped his tea and said, “He’s the most sought-after cultivator in Holy Region. That man is the chosen one.”

“He was only forty years old when he reached Reversion Void Stage. I believe that if not for the restrictions of this world, he would have made it even earlier.”

Qin Yu’s face suddenly looked a bit uncomfortable.

Such talent was indeed stunning.

Xiao Sheng had said that even the most talented prodigy in history had spent three hundred years before reaching Reversion Void Stage.

“What’s even crazier is that he’s almost defeated everyone after reaching Reversion Void Stage,” Gu Sanchen continued.

“He killed more than ten Peak of Return To Void Stage Cultivators right after entering the early stage. Now, he’s already reached the intermediate Reversion Void Stage, and I heard that he’s currently in retreat to attempt to the advanced stage.”

“At this point, maybe he will soon become a True Saint.”

After Qin Yu heard Gu Sanchen’s words, his face turned ashen.

That man was f*cking insane!

It had only been a few months since Great Upheaval, and he was already on the verge of breaking through to the final stage of the Reversion Void Stage. Was he a human?

Once he became a True Saint, Qin Yu would have no more chances.

“I guess Si Shiyue is one of the most powerful youngsters in this era,” Gu Sanchen said.

Qin Yu had mixed feelings in her heart.

He knew that his opponent must be a powerful person, but he didn’t expect such a level.

“What about Yan Ruoxue? How is she now?” Qin Yu asked anxiously.

Gu Sanchen laughed. “I can only say that Yan ruoxue’s as talented as Si Shiyue, so they are a perfect match.”

“Fu*king bulls*it!” Qin Yu slammed the table and stood up immediately!

The table was smashed into pieces in an instant!

His furious expression was somewhat strange.

“Brother Qin, what are you doing?” Gu Sanchen frowned.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and realized that he had lost his composure, so he suppressed the anger in his heart and said, “I’m sorry, I was too emotional. I… I have a crush on Miss Yan.”

“Hahahaha!” Gu Sanchen burst into laughter.

“Brother Qin, who isn’t dreaming of such a talented woman? However, she will only be in our daydreams. With her status, who deserves her other than a genius like Si Shiyue?” Gu Sanchen said, shaking his head.

Qin Yu was silent, but the rage in his heart was burning.

He didn’t know if it was because of his inner demon or anger.

In short, Qin Yu was about to lose his mind.

Jue Wu noticed Qin Yu’s bizarre reaction, so she quickly came forward and said, “We are leaving tomorrow, right? Shall we see each other here tomorrow?”

“Outside the city should be better. This place is quite far from Forbidden Zone,” Gu Sanchen said.

“Alright, see you tomorrow. We have to leave now. See you tomorrow,” Jue Wu said.

After saying this, Jue Wu pulled Qin Yu and quickly left.

The two returned to their residence, but Qin Yu’s face still looked livid.

Jue Wu sat next to Qin Yu and said, “Are you afraid?”

Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu and said with a cold face, “Of course not.”

“Then what are you angry at? Have you ever thought about how Si Shiyue grew up?” Jue Wu muttered.

“I think this might be good news,” Jue Wu said.

Qin Yu looked at Jue Wu in confusion, waiting for her to continue.

Jue Wu said, “Think about it. Si Shiyue already defeated everyone else in Reversion Void Stage right after reaching it. You also have a chaotic body, which means you can do it too!

“Once you reach Reversion Void Stage, who can be more powerful than you?”

Qin Yu was stunned when he heard this.

That made sense!

If Si Shiyue could do it, then he could as well!

Thinking back to Xiaoyu’s words, he realized that it was possible!

She allowed Qin Yu to head to Zhongzhou after he reached Reversion Void Stage, so it meant that he had the ability to protect himself here!

After Jue Wu’s pep talk, Qin Yu was more relaxed.

“I have to devour Huangji Buddha Flame as soon as possible,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Jue Wu clenched her fists and nodded. “Yes! When you step into Reversion Void Stage, kick Si Shiyue’s ass! I’ll help you beat him up!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “Thank you,” he looked at Jue Wu and nodded, and said.

Jue Wu was a carefree person and could always cheer Qin Yu up.

He was grateful to have such a friend.

“Take some rest. We’ll find a way to kill Yang Yu tomorrow,” Jue Wu said.

“I am not as smart as you, so I can’t come up with any strategy. I’ll leave this matter to you,” Jue Wu said, turned around, and left.

Qin Yu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He lay on the floor, lost in his thoughts.

At this moment, Qin Yu did not care about the consequences of devouring the primordial spirit. Instead, he only wanted to break through as soon as possible, no matter the price.
