Chapter 492: Facing Ten Half-step Martial Marquises! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Someone who could make Yan Sihai and the others so nervous was definitely not an ordinary person.

Xia Hang walked forward quickly and said with an embarrassed smile, “Grand Secretary, why are you here...”

The man who was called the Grand Secretary glanced at Xia Hang and said coldly, “Does the Jingdu Martial Arts Association really think that they are the officials?”

Xia Hang’s expression changed, and he hurriedly said, “I absolutely don’t have that intention. You’ve misunderstood...”

The Grand Secretary immediately slapped the table fiercely and berated, “Who told you to go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

Xia Hang smiled embarrassedly and said, “It wasn’t us who did it. It was the Saint Confucian Sect. It has nothing to do with us...”

The Grand Secretary frowned slightly and said coldly, “The higher-ups have always been more lenient with the matters that concerned martial arts, but I warn you guys, don’t take yourselves too seriously.”

“Yes, yes...” Xia Hang hurriedly nodded.

The Grand Secretary snickered. “Ji Yuhong is being held here, right?”

“Yes... Yes, we’re afraid that the Saint Confucian Sect will hurt her...” Xia Hang said.

The Grand Secretary glanced at him and said, “I don’t care about the Saint Confucian Sect. That’s between you guys.”

“But I’m telling you guys, if Ji Yuhong loses a hair, you guys know the consequences!”

Xia Hang hurriedly said, “Don’t worry, I promise to let her enjoy her time here...”

The Grand Secretary snorted lightly. He didn’t stay any longer and turned around to leave.

It was not until he walked far away that everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

“Fortunately, we didn’t touch her...” Han Meng said in a low voice.

Yan Sihai’s brows also furrowed.

“It seems that the higher-ups value Ji Yuhong very much...” Yan Sihai gritted his teeth.

Xia Hang patted Yan Sihai’s shoulder and said, “That’s enough. It’s already good enough that we captured her.”

Yan Sihai snorted coldly and said, “I’ll find someone who can replace her sooner or later!”

...

After Qin Yu walked out of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, he stood on the street for a long time without moving.

The few internal qis that were lurking in the dark couldn’t escape Qin Yu’s eyes.

“Come out,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Before he finished speaking, ten half-step Martial Marquises walked out from the dark.

They surrounded Qin Yu in the middle and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, you are finally willing to come out.”

Qin Yu glanced at them and said with a sneer, “It seems that you have waited for a long time and are quite patient.”

The hooked-nose man sneered. “The Hong Yi Sect has given a death order to bring you back.”

Qin Yu sized up the man with the hooked nose and said with a smile, “I’m a little curious. When the Pavilion Master was besieged, why didn’t you take the opportunity to break into the Divine Alchemist Pavilion?”

“Also... After the Pavilion Master was taken away, why didn’t you take any measures?”

The man with the hooked nose snorted coldly. “We had an agreement with the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. She said that you would come out in a month. I believed her.”

Qin Yu raised his brows and said, “You guys are quite trustworthy. You’re much better than those bastards from the Saint Confucian Sect.”

The man with the hooked nose said indifferently, “Do you want to leave with us, or do you want us to take you back?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “On account that you guys didn’t add insult to injury, go back. I will spare your lives.”

When the man with the hooked nose heard this, he immediately laughed out loud.

“Qin Yu, do you know what you’re saying?!” The man with the hooked nose shouted angrily.

“We are ten half-step Martial Marquises! How can you be so arrogant?”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “Half-step Martial Marquises aren’t worth mentioning. The ten of you aren’t my match.”

“Nonsense!” The man with the hooked nose was furious!

His internal qi exploded at this moment! The other nine followed closely behind!

“I’ll either bring you back or kill you today. It’s your choice!” The man with the hooked nose coldly said.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “I gave you all a chance. Since you don’t know how to cherish it, then don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

As he spoke, the golden light on Qin Yu’s body began to spread throughout his entire body.

A terrifying internal qi slowly spread out! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

A great battle was about to break out at any moment!

“Attack!”

The few of them looked at each other and took the lead to charge towards Qin Yu!

“Boom!”

The three of them summoned their internal qi at the same time and headed straight for Qin Yu!

“You’re too brazen!” Qin Yu coldly spat out a few words. Then, he suddenly clenched his fist and raised his hand to confront the incoming attack!

“Boom!”

This was the collision of four rays of light! A terrifying golden light erupted at this moment!

Almost at the instant of the collision, these three people were sent flying!

“How is this possible?” A trace of terror instantly flashed across their faces!

Qin Yu’s entire body was shining with golden light, and his internal qi was powerful.

“I will only give you one chance, but you have already missed it,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Qin Yu walked over!

These ten people didn’t dare to be negligent and hurriedly reacted.

In an instant, several rays of light headed straight for Qin Yu’s blind spots!

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was unflustered. His body was incomparably tough, and the sound of endless banging could be heard!

Qin Yu fought against ten people alone, and the more he fought, the braver he became. His entire body was full of flames, and his hair flapped wildly, as if he was an undefeatable war god!

Buzz!

Hong Yi Sect took out his magic artifact at this moment. This magic artifact rippled with unparalleled might, and it came pressing down with surging power!

“Not worth mentioning!”

Qin Yu was stunned. He quickly used the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist, and then smashed it with a bang!

Kacha!

The instant it came into contact, the magic artifact was shattered!

“Oh no!” The man with the hooked nose suddenly felt that things were wrong!

The young man in front of him seemed to be a little abnormal!

“Go to h*ll!”

Before the man with the hooked nose could react, Qin Yu had already arrived with the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique. His fist landed cleanly on the man with the hooked nose’s chest!

The man with the hooked nose’s expression changed drastically! At such a close distance, there was no way he could dodge!

At this critical moment, a silver light lit up on the man with the hooked nose’s chest!

This was the Protective Magic Artifact of the Hong Yi Sect, and it was indestructible!

“Boom!”

But when Qin Yu’s fist came smashing over, the Protective Magic Artifact was actually shattered!

The extremely powerful penetrating force instantly shook the man’s internal organs!

“Phew!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was suddenly spat out!

“How can he be so strong?!” The man’s expression changed drastically!

No wonder the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had made them wait for a month!

“Puchi!”

At this moment, a sharp blade slashed towards Qin Yu’s back before leaving a bloody scar a few centimeters long!

Qin Yu turned around and looked over coldly.

He saw a man whose palm had transformed into a long claw standing there.

The moment he was stared at by Qin Yu, the long-clawed man’s heart thumped!

This feeling... was as if he was being stared at by a ferocious tiger!

“Go... Go to h*ll!” The long-clawed man roared crazily in fear. He swung his large hand and the long claw came straight for Qin Yu’s head!

“Kacha!!”

Qin Yu stretched out his golden palm and grabbed the long claw!

“Oh no!” The long-clawed man’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

He tried to pull back the long claw, but he realized that he couldn’t grab it at all!

“You actually hurt me. Your technique isn’t bad,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu exerted some force with his hand, and the long-clawed man was instantly pulled over by Qin Yu!
