Chapter 135: Tao Shan of the Liu Family! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When they sensed Qin Yu’s killing intent, the Liu family’s father and son instantly looked extremely apprehensive. In the depths of their hearts, an intense sense of fear even surfaced!

“Qin Yu, I don’t think there is any grudge between us. Why don’t we sit down and have a good talk?” Liu Yi actually gave in!

After hearing his words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “Sure. Kneel down and apologize to me first. Then we can talk.”

Liu Yi gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, is this your attitude? Don’t you think it’s out of line to ask us to kneel down?”

“Out of line?” Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

He looked at Liu Yi coldly and said, “When you asked someone to kill me, did you think it was out of line? Now, I just want you to kneel down and apologize. Do you think that’s unfair?”

Liu Yi was instantly speechless. He had nothing to say.

“Qin Yu.” Liu Yi took a deep breath.

“I really want to talk to you. Do you have to be so ruthless?” Liu Yi roared.

When he heard this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“Liu Yi, don’t you think it’s funny to say this? If Wu Hongchang killed me, would I still be standing here? Or rather, I’m just an unarmed ordinary person, would you still try to talk thins out with me?” Qin Yu’s voice was sonorous.

Liu Yi immediately fell into silence.

After a moment of silence, he said, “I’ve already given you the Water Dragon Cave. You can raise other conditions.”

“I only want you two to kneel down and admit your mistakes,” Qin Yu pointed to the ground and said.

Liu Yi sighed and slowly said, “I’m already so old. Do you think it’s appropriate for me to kneel down? Let’s sit down and have a chat first. Is that okay?”

Liu Yi looked sincere, but a hint of craftiness flashed in his eyes.

Although it was only a flash, it still couldn’t avoid Qin Yu’s eyes.

“Mr. Liu, the same move will lose its effect after being used twice.” Qin Yu sneered repeatedly.

Liu Yi’s expression changed. He pretended to be puzzled and said, “What do you mean?”

“You’re stalling for time and waiting for Tao Shan, right?” Qin Yu said coldly.

Liu Yi’s expression changed again! He never expected that his thoughts would be seen through by Qin Yu!

“Alright, I will give you this opportunity. Coincidentally, I also want to see what abilities Tao Shan has,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

As soon as he finished speaking, he saw an extremely burly man walk in from the door!

The burly man was more than two meters tall, like a small mountain!

“Tao Shan, you’re finally here!” Liu Yi was immediately overjoyed. Without saying anything, he ran in Tao Shan’s direction.

Tao Shan swayed his huge body and bowed slightly. “Mr. Liu, sorry for my tardiness.”

“No. You came just at the right time!” Liu Yi couldn’t help but look smug.

He looked at Qin Yu with a crafty expression and said with a wicked smile, “You’re still too naive. You want me to apologize to you? Are you even worthy of it?”

When he heard Liu Yi’s words, Qin Yu couldn’t help but shake his head slightly.

Liu Yi was really sly.

“Tao Shan, there’s no need to talk nonsense with him. Kill him immediately!” Liu Yi pointed at Qin Yu and ordered.

Tao Shan didn’t say anything. He rubbed his huge fist and walked towards Qin Yu.

The two of them looked at each other. One was tall while the other was short, forming a sharp contrast.

However, there wasn’t the slightest hint of panic on Qin Yu’s face. On the contrary, he was extremely calm.

“Qin Yu, you’re very courageous. To be honest, I admire you a little.” At this moment, Tao Shan suddenly said.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. “Oh really?”

Tao Shan sighed. “To go against a prominent family on my own is something that I have thought of but never dared to do. That is why I admire you.”

“Cut the crap. D*mn it, kill him immediately!” Liu Yi couldn’t help but roar.

Tao Shan continued, “Unfortunately, I am indebted to the Liu family, so I have to work for the Liu family. Let’s do it.”

Tao Shan was quite high-minded. He took two steps back, as if waiting for Qin Yu to make a move.

“Then I will have to make the first move.” Qin Yu immediately conjured his spiritual power and rushed towards Tao Shan!

Tao Shan wasn’t in a hurry. He raised his fist that was the size of a casserole and smashed it down!

“Boom!” A loud sound was heard! Tao Shan’s huge body was actually pushed back three to four steps!

On the other hand, Qin Yu was also pushed back a few steps. His wrist was even in pain from the impact!

“What a tough body!” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with a hint of surprise.

Tao Shan also exclaimed, “As expected of the person who killed Wu Hongchang.”

“Tao Shan, are you trying to mess with me?! Kill him quickly!” Liu Yi couldn’t help but curse.

Tao Shan ignored Liu Yi. He fixed his eyes on Qin Yu and said slowly, “Qin Yu, I am indebted to them and work for them, so I can only kill you today.”

After saying this, Tao Shan took off his clothes to reveal his strong muscles.

Tao Shan’s muscles appeared like pieces of hard stones attached to his body. Under the light, they were even glistening!

“What a strong body!” Qin Yu was even more surprised!

Unlike ordinary muscular men, Tao Shan’s muscles really looked like a suit of armor!

“I don’t have any other hobbies and I’m obsessed with martial arts. Although I’m only an Inner Strength Master Hands, I’m also a Cross-training Master,” Tao Shan said as he shook his huge body.

“Cross-training Master?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

Qin Yu had heard of Cross-training Masters. They specialized in body training, and they polished the body to be as hard as a stone!

Rumor had it that even a bullet couldn’t penetrate a top-notch cross-training master!

Qin Yu said with some anticipation, “I heard that the body of the cross-training master is like steel. I wonder if it’s true or not.”

Compared to Tao Shan, Wu Hongchang simply wasn’t worth mentioning!

Tao Shan said in a deep voice, “You’ll know when you try.”

After saying that, Tao Shan roared angrily, and the muscles on his body actually expanded a few times!

Not only that, but his body seemed to have a golden hue that looked extremely dazzling!

“I combined my Inner Strength with Cross-training. My body has already reached an indestructible level. I’m not even afraid of an Inner Strength Past Master,” Tao Shan said coldly.

“How powerful!” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“I have to say, with Tao Shan around, Lu Shuming is really no match for the Liu family,” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Not far away, Liu Yi sneered and said, “Of course. If it weren’t for Tao Shan’s principle of not killing the old and the young, Wu Hongchang would have died long ago!”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. At this time, he suddenly changed the topic and said coldly, “It’s a pity that the Liu family offended someone they shouldn’t have offended.”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
