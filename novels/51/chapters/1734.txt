Chapter 1735: The Dispirited Xiao Sheng Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xihuang was huge, and it was not easy to find the city.

Fortunately, hard work paid off. After several days, Qin Yu finally saw the legendary Ancient Tomb City.

Ancient Tomb City was just like the legends. Looking down from above, it was actually filled with ancient tombs.

These ancient tombs exuded a cold chill, which was obviously caused by dark energy.

This surprised Qin Yu, because after the great change of heaven and earth, most of the dark energy had been affected, but this place was obviously not.

!!

“Could it be that this Ancient Tomb City also has some terrifying existence? ” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He didn’t waste any time and rushed to Ancient Tomb City.

The history of Ancient Tomb City was very special. Many people were born to cultivate evil, and they relied on dark energy.

It was for this reason that a group of people gathered in Ancient Tomb City.

Qin Yu arrived at the city gate. As soon as he stepped in, he felt a gloomy aura.

He released his divine sense, which covered more than half of the city.

Soon, Qin Yu found a large group of people in Ancient Tomb City.

However, what made Qin Yu feel strange was that the strength of the people in Ancient Tomb City was not strong. There was not even a single one in the Reversion Void Stage.

“It seems like the great change in the world isn’t good news for these people.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He walked cautiously into Ancient Tomb City, afraid that he would meet people like the two Chao brothers again.

Fortunately, no one noticed Qin Yu along the way, which made him feel a little relieved.

All he could see were tombs.

There were no names carved on the tombs, but there were tombstones erected one after another.

All the dark energy in Ancient Tomb City came from these tombstones. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu could not help but feel a little strange. He stopped one of the men and asked politely, “Brother, where did these tombstones come from? Why is there such cold dark energy?”

The man looked at Qin Yu up and down, then said, “I don’t know either. I heard that this place used to be an ancient battlefield and many people died here. As for these tombstones, I heard that they were set up by their descendants.”

“Their descendants? Then why isn’t there a name?” Qin Yu asked, a little confused.

The other party laughed and said, “Who said there’s no name? It’s just that it’s been too long and they have long been erased by time. Look carefully, there are still some words left on some of the tombstones.”

Qin Yu took a closer look. There were indeed some marks, but they were no longer visible.

Not only that, but many tombstones seemed to have been weathered, breaking into pieces.

“Many thanks.” Qin Yu slightly bowed to him as a greeting.

Qin Yu didn’t want to provoke anyone in Ancient Tomb City. He just wanted to focus on his cultivation.

Thus, he found a desolate place and sat down cross-legged, beginning to absorb the dark energy from this place.

Qin Yu’s heart was not calm.

Too many unknown risks flashed through his mind.

The chaotic body in Zhongzhou would probably cultivate in the same way as Qin Yu, so there would be competition in the future.

However, he had a strong background, and Qin Yu would be at a disadvantage.

“Sigh.” Qin Yu sighed slightly and stopped thinking about it. He could only take one step at a time.

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.

It was getting closer and closer to the resurrection of Yuan Xiu.

In this half a month, it was as if Xiao Sheng had vanished from the face of the earth, and no one could find him.

The entire Tianyun Sect was extremely anxious. They had received news that Yuan Xiu was about to recover. If Xiao Sheng could not reach the Reversion Void Stage before that, the consequences would be unimaginable.

“In the last battle, the sect master was seriously injured. I’m afraid it won’t be easy for him to recover in a short time.” The Deputy Sect Master sighed.

“That’s right. If you want to break through to the Reversion Void Stage, you have to at least ensure that your body is in a state of complete recovery. Otherwise, you’ll probably die under the heavenly tribulation.

Everyone discussed and was worried.

In the North Plain.

Yuan Xiu divided the North Plain into several teams.

One team was to search for Xiao Sheng, while the other team was in charge of collecting the divine sense and strength of cultivators.

Everything was proceeding in an orderly manner. However, Xiao Sheng had not been found yet, which gave Yuan Xiu a bad premonition.

A few more days passed.

The aura of Yuan Xiu’s true body, which was sitting at the foot of the snowy mountain, became increasingly powerful.

Compared to the true body, Yuan Xiu’s clone seemed insignificant.

“Lord, at this rate, how long will it take?” Sima Bei asked.

Yuan Xiu clasped his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Five days at most.”

“Five days…” Sima Bei muttered in a low voice, then said, “That Xiao Sheng shouldn’t be able to cause any major waves in five days.”

“As long as Xiao Sheng is dead, no one in Lizhou will be able to stop me!” Yuan Xiu said coldly.

“That being said, don’t forget what happened in Xihuang last time.” Sima Bei could not help but remind him.

Ever since the incident in Xihuang, there had been rumors that there was a living Ancient Saint in Lizhou.

The more the news spread, the more true it became. Some people even said that the living Ancient Saint was the owner of the white bone stick.

“There can’t be any living Ancient Saints in Lizhou.” Yuan Xiu was extremely confident in this.

Seeing this, Sima Bei did not say anything more and could only nod silently.

Ancient Tomb City.

The dark energy here was extremely dense, enough for Qin Yu’s cultivation.

In a few days, Qin Yu had absorbed more than half of the dark energy in the Ancient Tomb City. His cultivation seemed to be about to reach the Peak of Mighty Realm.

“if I return to Nanzhou now, I’m afraid I’ll have to come back again.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, if he continued to stay, the dark energy here would not be enough to support Qin Yu to enter the half-step Reversion Void Stage.

After thinking about it again and again, Qin Yu finally decided to return to Nanzhou for the time being.

So, Qin Yu got up and left Ancient Tomb City. He summoned the Divine Eagle and went straight to Nanzhou.

After two or three days, Qin Yu returned to the border of Nanzhou.

As soon as he stepped into Nanzhou, Qin Yu sensed a familiar aura.

He activated his desolate divine eye and looked in a certain direction.

Three hundred stars away, Xiao Sheng was sitting cross-legged, slowly recovering his aura.

When Qin Yu’s gaze fell on him, he opened his eyes slightly and a golden light shot straight at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He looked around. This was the border between Nanzhou and Xihuang.

Why would Xiao Sheng appear here?

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it. He immediately dashed toward Xiao Sheng.

When Qin Yu arrived, he was surprised to find that Xiao Sheng was no longer there.

“Strange.” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Just as he was about to activate his desolate divine eye, Xiao Sheng suddenly appeared behind Qin Yu.

He put a hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder and said in a low voice, “Oh, it’s you.”

Qin Yu was stunned, and he quickly turned around to look at Xiao Sheng.

At this moment, Xiao Sheng’s aura was somewhat dispirited, and it was quite different from his peak state.
