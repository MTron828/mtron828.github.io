Chapter 1506: Chapter 1506, Dark Energy Grave 1

First Elder tried his best, but he couldn’t say a word.

The deputy sect master saw this and quickly waved his hand, “Alright, let’s Go and rest.”

A few people immediately carried first elder in. Looking at their backs as they left, the deputy sect master let out a long sigh.

“Now... This sect should be able to be represented by me,”the deputy sect master thought to himself.

He had long disliked the first elder’s actions, but he had no right to interrupt.

Now that the first elder was seriously injured, as long as the sect master did not step out, the position could only be taken by him.

In the next few days, the vice sect master made a bold and decisive move. First, he sent the eighteen gods to the border to resist the people of the northern lands.

Later on, the vice sect master sent more and more people to the border.

Such actions were naturally well-received. Even Qin Yu, who was far away in the Hua Ning mountain area, couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

“It seems that the Heavenly Cloud sect isn’t all useless,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

This made Qin Yu even more confused. The deputy sect master was many times more capable than the first elder. Why would the sect master hand over the position to the first elder? Could it be that he wanted him to destroy the sect?

If the vice sect master sends everyone to the border, would I have the chance to attack the first elder? Qin Yu thought to himself.

If that was the case, then it would be good news.

......

It was just that Qin Yu did not understand the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s foundation. Such a sect had probably set up all sorts of formation taboos long ago.

With Qin Yu’s ability, it wouldn’t be easy for him to break in.

I can only place my hopes on Yongji, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Yongji’s actions had already shown his hostility toward the Heavenly Cloud sect. Now that the sect master was in seclusion, Yongji could take advantage of this opportunity to attack.

When he broke into the Heavenly Cloud sect, Qin Yu could wait for an opportunity to kill the first elder and take revenge for Zhen Yue.

The next day.

Qin Yu left Mount Hua Ning and arrived at Zhuo Jing’s residence.

Coincidentally, when Qin Yu arrived at the Zhuo family residence, he happened to meet Li Yingying and the others.

They sat cross-legged under the arbor pavilion, drinking and having fun. It was quite comfortable.

Seeing Qin Yu suddenly appear, everyone couldn’t help but be shocked.

“Brother Qin?”Zhuo Jing was the first to regain his senses. He immediately put down the wine cup in his hand and walked quickly towards Qin Yu.

Li Yingying, on the other hand, appeared extremely unnatural.

“Brother Zhuo.”Qin Yu nodded slightly at Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo jing smiled and said, “Brother Qin, why are you here?”

“I have something important to ask you,”Qin Yu went straight to the point.

Zhuo Jing pulled Qin Yu and said, “Brother Qin, please take your seat. Let’s sit down and have a chat.”

Qin Yu glanced at Li Yingying and then said, “Forget it. I just want to ask you a few words and then leave.”

“Brother Qin, you’d better take a seat quickly. We really admire your big moves recently.”Someone at the table waved his hand.

“Yeah. Brother Qin, come and have a drink. Don’t tell me you won’t give us some face.”The others also shouted.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t refuse.

Moreover, this matter couldn’t be solved in a short time. No one knew whether Zhuo Jing had any channels or news.

Therefore, Qin Yu sat down with Zhuo Jing.

Before Qin Yu could speak, Li Yingying rolled her eyes and raised her wine glass. “Brother Qin, long time no see. We miss you so much.”

Qin Yu glanced at Li Yingying, mocking her in his heart.

“Miss Li, forget it. Maybe one day I will cause trouble. Don’t drag you into it.”Qin Yu sneered.

Li Yingying immediately became even more embarrassed, but she was a little angry in her heart.

“Brother Qin, I heard that your foster son who fought in the eternal pole not long ago killed many guest elders of the Heavenly Cloud sect. I wonder if it’s true?”Someone at the side hurriedly came forward to mediate the situation.

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and nodded. “It’s true.”

Although everyone had heard about this long ago, they couldn’t help but be surprised when they heard Qin Yu admit it personally.

“Brother Qin’s abilities really impressed us.”

“Yes, in the entire South Province, Brother Qin should be the number one person.”

“That’s right. Brother Qin killed Ling Yun, who was known as the number one genius of the South Province when he first came to the South Province. Now, even the guest elder of the Heavenly Cloud sect is no match for you. It really makes us feel ashamed.”

Qin Yu smiled as he replied one by one. Then, he raised his cup and drank.

The group of people drank and had fun. They were rather happy.

“Have you heard? The border seems to be in turmoil recently.”At this moment, someone suddenly spoke up.

“Yes, the people of the northern lands have been doing this repeatedly. They have killed countless clansmen of our southern region. It’s infuriating.”

“That’s not the point.”At this moment, a young man shook his head.

He shook the wine cup in his hand and said with a solemn expression, “The northern lands have mastered the spatial spell. A large number of people have already arrived at our southern region. We don’t know when they will make a move. When that time comes, it will definitely be a great disaster!”

“That’s right.”Another young man also agreed.

“Our Southern Region has suffered a great loss. There is a huge dead river between the southern region and the northern region. Without the formation, we would not be able to enter the northern region at all. Meanwhile, the people of the northern region can freely enter and exit our Southern Region.”

“Sigh, don’t tell me that our southern region doesn’t have a teleportation formation?”Someone asked.

Zhuo Jing shook his head and said, “The southern province is a large teleportation formation, and the cost is extremely high. We can’t send small batches of people to the north to die, right?”

Hearing this, someone on the table immediately slammed the table and stood up. He said angrily, “Then our southern province will just passively defend? If this continues, the southern province will sooner or later be eaten up by them!”

“I don’t know, I don’t know.”The people on the table shook their heads one after another.

Qin Yu also frowned. He didn’t expect that they had already fallen into such a situation.

On the surface, the South Province seemed calm and peaceful, but no one knew when they would make a move, how they would make a move, or what they would do to the South Province.

“The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of the common man. Fortunately, the Heavenly Cloud sect has finally made a move,”someone sighed.

At this point, Zhuo Jing looked at Qin Yu.

“Brother Qin, I heard that Lord Jue Wu also went to the northern border. Is that true?”Zhuo Jing asked.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes, it’s true. A few days ago, she left Mount Hua Ning with senior Xiao Hai.”

“Sigh, it’s a pity that we were born like ants. We’re insignificant,”a young man beside him lamented.

“Let’s not talk about these sad topics.”Someone waved his hand.

Then, Zhuo Jing looked at Qin Yu and asked, “Brother Qin, why are you looking for me this time?”

Qin Yu glanced at the people on the table. Out of vigilance, Qin Yu pulled Zhuo Jing to the side.

“Brother Zhuo, do you know where the dark energy grave is in the South Province?”Qin Yu asked.

Zhuo Jing was a little surprised and said, “Dark energy grave? Why are you looking for that?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and then said, “I need dark energy.”
