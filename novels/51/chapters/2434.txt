“Honey, quickly take us away!”

“Sister Ruoxue, quickly run!” Jue Wu also shouted.

Seeing that she had cleared the biggest threat to Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue forcefully suppressed the great joy in her heart. With a slight movement of her hands, the spatial qi turned into a long river and swept up. She then brought everyone along and disappeared from the spot.

In the outer region, Yao Meng, Jiang He, and He Teng also disappeared instantly upon seeing this.

It was no secret that Yao Meng and Jiang He had gone to Demon-slaying Peak to meet Qin Yu.

Later, when Lei Qingye came back to his senses, it would be a disaster for them.

The Yao family’s Immortal Emperor stood in the air with an indifferent expression.

At this moment, the 18 ancestors of the Lei family who could stand up dared not even breathe loudly.

Other than Lei Qingye, everyone else would be killed instantly by Immortal Emperor Yao. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Therefore, Lei Qingye dared not make a move at all unless he wanted to exchange all of the Lei family’s bloodline for Qin Yu’s life.

He was tremendously regretful now. If he had directly killed Qin Yu just now, there would not have been so much trouble now.

This kid had endless methods. In the end, he actually activated the corpse of the Yao family’s Celestial Saint.

He even recovered a wisp of the Immortal Emperor’s soul. This unbelievably absurd situation was simply on the verge of breaking his defense.

During the several years of the Path of Heaven, the Yao family only relied on the family’s immortal scriptures to communicate with the corpse and use it as a magical artifact to attack. But Qin Yu was heaven-defying to this extent.

Seeing that Qin Yu had gone far away, Immortal Emperor Yao turned around, entered the void, and slowly left.

No one dared to imagine Qin Yu would end up like this.

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue was controlling her spatial qi to fly through the air currents. Everyone felt their positions flickering nonstop.

No one knew where they were in a short span of tens of breaths.

What a terrifying spatial manipulation power. For such a method, other than using his power of origin to cast a technique, Qin Yu’s speed was much slower than Yan Ruoxue’s.

As expected of someone who could trigger the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation, her talent and strength were indeed strong.

Qin Yu stared at Yan Ruoxue’s beautiful face and could not help but pinch it.

Yan Ruoxue blushed, and she almost plunged into the endless void with everybody. Everyone was so scared that they shivered.

“Big Brother, don’t do anything rash. If there’s anything, you can talk to Sister-in-law at home. We’re floating in the void now.”

Chang Mang quickly pulled Qin Yu to his side.

An hour later, as Yan Ruoxue felt that they couldn’t track her down, she landed somewhere in Nanzhou.

The moment they appeared on the ground, something seemed to be spying on them. The Five Great Emperors in the Sumeru ring suddenly opened their eyes. They slowly raised their heads and looked in a specific direction coincidentally.

“D*mn! You guys enter the Sumeru ring first.”

Qin Yu’s expression was incomparably ugly. The qi of the Sumeru ring spread out, and everyone was sucked into the Sumeru ring and then entered the space again.

At that moment, he sensed that a consciousness seemed to have locked onto him the moment they appeared.

Qin Yu told everyone about his discovery.

“The sea of the Path of Heaven encircles the entire universe. No matter where we are, we are surrounded by the sea of space. What you’ve sensed should be Lei Qingye using the power of the sea of thunder to deduce our location. This power has gone beyond the Tribulation Fifth Level. However, this kind of deduction consumes too much spiritual energy. Even Lei Qingye can only deduce for a short while.’

Yan Ruoxue pondered for a moment and guessed the overall situation.

“If that’s the case, we’re not safe no matter where we are. If Lei Qingye discovers us, he’ll be near us soon with his speed.”

Qin Yu frowned. Lei Qingye should not be able to spy on them in the Sumeru Realm, but they could not stay there forever.

“This time, the Lei family has completely shed all pretense of cordiality with us. Other than Dean Lei and Flower Granny, I’m afraid the others will not let go of us until the day we die. I’m afraid Lei Qingye will keep deducing our location whenever he has the time. However, with Immortal Emperor Yao here, he wouldn’t attack.”

Qin Yu analyzed, telling everyone not to worry too much.

A figure suddenly appeared in the Sumeru ring.

Speak of the devil, it was the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor!

“Thank you, Immortal Emperor, for saving our lives.”

Qin Yu cupped his hands toward him. Although it was an exchange of benefits, he had indeed left Thunder Courtyard because of Immortal Emperor Yao. It was indeed a big favor.

“The three-attack agreement has been fulfilled.”

A quiet sound of divine sense voice transmitted into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Wasn’t it only twice?

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He then suddenly realized.

The first time was when he attacked Lei Huan, and the second time was when he intimidated Lei Qingye.

Adding on the previous attack, it was indeed a three-attack agreement.

Ji Yue secretly wrote a line of words on Qin Yu’s arm.

In front of the Immortal Emperor’s corpse, she even dared not use divine sense for voice transmission.

If Immortal Emperor Yao were to leave now, they would be equivalent to courting death.

Qin Yu shook his head slightly. If he went back on his words with the corpse of the Immortal Emperor, he would probably be tired of living.

He had to keep his promise and plan for the rest.

The Sumeru ring suddenly stopped, and Qin Yu carefully sensed it.

Seeing the Five Great Emperors not respond, he heaved a sigh of relief.

With a divine thought, he controlled the space in the Sumeru ring to rotate. The Coffin of Nine Lifetimes and the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor appeared in the two furthest locations in the north and the south.

“You must not go beyond the range of ten meters from the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes. If Immortal Emperor Yao attacks, this thing will be the last trump card.

Qin Yu reminded them before appearing in front of Immortal Emperor Yao.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, you’ve saved our lives, and I’ll certainly use the Soul Torment Mind Technique to help you recover. However, you must promise not to attack us after your recovery.”

Qin Yu sent out a divine sense.

He did not have any confidence at all at this moment. If he allowed Immortal Emperor Yao to recover a soul, he had no idea how much his strength would increase.

With his current strength, Qin Yu could not resist at all. If he could get the assurance from the Immortal Emperor, he would be slightly more assured.

After receiving an affirmative answer, Qin Yu no longer hesitated.

His divine sense turned into a golden light and shot into the Yao family’s Immortal Emperor’s divine sense. Like previously, it triggered the deathly silent land to circulate the Soul Torment Mind Technique.

This time, even though Qin Yu triggered a trace of soul power in that deathly silent place of the soul, the effect this time was far inferior to the last time.

After circulating it for 10 hours, it only increased the power of the Immortal Emperor’s soul by a little.

He did not gain anything else, let alone recover his other soul and two spirits.

If this continued, it would be useless even if it were to operate for another year and a half..
