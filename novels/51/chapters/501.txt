Chapter 502: Tricked! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Elder Qu’s eagle-like palm contained sharp inner strength and was heading straight for Qin Yu’s dantian!

He was extremely vicious. He wanted to cripple Qin Yu! At that time, Han Wei would publicly execute Qin Yu at the wedding!

“Clang!”

However, when Elder Qu’s palm landed on Qin Yu’s lower abdomen, his expression couldn’t help but change!

He felt his finger being shaken until it was in pain. On the other hand, Qin Yu was completely uninjured!

“What a tough body!” Elder Qu’s expression couldn’t help but change.

While he was feeling shocked, Qin Yu had already slapped him.

This slap sent Elder Qu flying!

Gu Canghai glanced at Elder Qu coldly and snorted. “What a trash.”

Elder Qu hurriedly got up from the ground and said awkwardly, “Sect master, this kid’s body is too strong. I can’t do anything to him...”

Gu Canghai ignored Elder Qu. He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Do you still want to resist?”

Qin Yu stood up from the ground. He took a deep breath and said, “As I said before, if you can’t kill me today, I will definitely make the Saint Confucian Sect disappear from this world.”

“How arrogant!” Gu Canghai was furious. His palm turned into a fist and smashed toward Qin Yu!

Qin Yu dodged the punch!

Gu Canghai’s fist smashed on the wall behind him, causing the entire wall to shake!

Qin Yu glanced at the wall and seemed to have thought of something.

“Your speed is quite fast, but do you think you can dodge the second punch?” Gu Canghai said coldly.

As he spoke, Gu Canghai threw another punch!

This punch was extremely fast, but it was still dodged by Qin Yu!

Gu Canghai’s expression became even gloomier.

The two misses made Gu Canghai feel a little embarrassed.

“You don’t know your place,” Gu Canghai said coldly.

The qi energy on his body surged, and a terrifying pressure spread out!

Even Qin Yu’s face flashed with a trace of solemnity.

Facing Gu Canghai’s fist, Qin Yu didn’t dare to be negligent.

He immediately executed the Saintly Body Technique, and at the same time, he suspended the Venerable Fifth Mountain above his head.

“Go to h*ll!”

Gu Canghai roared, and the terrifying fist force smashed towards Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed!

With such speed, even Qin Yu was unable to dodge!

The gap between their realms was too big, and it was impossible to make up for it!

“Bang!”

This punch smashed onto Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu’s body was shooting out like a cannonball!

“Crash!”

The walls of the clubhouse collapsed under this punch! The formation was also shattered by Gu Canghai at this moment!

Dust flew up and blocked everyone’s vision.

In front of them, there was a pile of ruins.

Gu Canghai put his hands behind his back and sneered.

“Sect... sect master, did you kill him with this punch?” Elder Qu was a little worried.

The power of that punch was too strong. Just the power of the punch had made Elder Qu’s mouth bleed!

Gu Canghai was also a little uncertain. He said coldly, “Go take a look. It’s better if he’s not dead.”

Elder Qu hurriedly nodded. He quickly ran into the ruins and began to search for Qin Yu.

However, a few minutes later, Elder Qu’s expression changed drastically!

“Sect... sect master! Qin Yu is missing!” Elder Qu shouted in alarm!

Gu Canghai frowned. He hurriedly stepped forward and stood at Elder Qu’s side.

Sure enough, there was only a pool of blood on the ground. Where was Qin Yu?

“Oh no, he escaped!” Elder Qu cried out in alarm.

Gu Canghai’s expression turned even gloomier!

He suddenly understood something!

“Qin Yu... actually tricked me!” Gu Canghai flew into a rage!

Qin Yu couldn’t break the barrier by himself, so he used his own body to take Gu Canghai’s attack head-on!

He used his own body as a cannonball and forcefully smashed open the barrier!

“How is this possible? He didn’t die from that punch?!” Elder Qu’s face was filled with lingering fear.

Gu Canghai, who was beside him, also gritted his teeth and said coldly, “He can’t be understood with common sense. No matter what, we have to kill him quickly!”

At this moment, Gu Canghai actually felt fear!

He was able to withstand this punch of his at the half-step Martial Marquis Realm. If he truly advanced further, he wouldn’t dare to imagine his power!

“Chase after him!” Gu Canghai said coldly.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was trying his best to escape!

His entire body was covered in blood, and his bones were broken in many places. It was a tragic sight!

“D*mn it, a Martial Marquis indeed lives up to his reputation!” Qin Yu’s internal qi was weak.

Just this punch had already heavily injured Qin Yu!

“If it wasn’t for the Venerable Fifth Mountain, I’m afraid I really would have died there.” Qin Yu’s expression was unsightly.

His internal qi was extremely weak, but he didn’t dare to stop.

If he was caught by Gu Canghai, he would definitely die today!

“Gu Canghai... you will pay the price!” Qin Yu gritted his teeth and said coldly.

He escaped for dozens of miles in one breath and arrived in a forest in the blink of an eye.

Qin Yu concealed his internal qi and hid in a cave for the time being.

He sat cross-legged on the ground while slowly recovering his internal qi.

On the other side, Gu Canghai searched for dozens of miles in one breath, but still couldn’t find Qin Yu.

“Sect master, this kid ran too fast. We can’t find him at all,” Elder Qu said while panting.

Gu Canghai’s expression was extremely ugly!

Today was too heavy of a loss for him.

Not only did he fail to capture Qin Yu, but he had also offended the Teng family of Sea City!

More importantly, Qin Yu was still alive!

This was definitely a disaster for the Saint Confucian Sect! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

If Qin Yu were to launch a heavy retaliation, then the Saint Confucian Sect might really fall into decline!

“Sect master, what do we do now?” Elder Qu asked.

Gu Canghai said coldly, “Let’s go back first and use all our connections to find Qin Yu!”

“At the same time, tell the Saint Confucian Sect that from today onwards, no one is allowed to go out!”

Gu Canghai was truly afraid. He was afraid that everyone in the Saint Confucian Sect would be killed by Qin Yu!

If that was the case, the Saint Confucian Sect would really have nothing left.

In the blink of an eye, three days passed.

The news of the Saint Confucian Sect closing the mountain gate quickly spread.

“Did you guys hear? The Saint Confucian Sect closed the mountain gate!”

“Haha, I heard that they were scared by Qin Yu!”

“That’s right, I heard it too. The Saint Confucian Sect’s people are all afraid of being caught by Qin Yu and killed!”

“I have to admire Qin Yu. He actually forced the Saint Confucian Sect to close the entire mountain gate! This is the first time in history, right?”

Countless comments continued to appear on the Martial Arts Forum. Even the Jingdu Martial Arts Association couldn’t delete them.

“F * ck!” Seeing these messages, Yan Sihai turned livid with anger.

He took out his cell phone and called Gu Canghai.

“You piece of trash, you have completely humiliated the Saint Confucian Sect!” As soon as he picked up the phone, Yan Sihai cursed!

On the other end, Gu Canghai didn’t dare to say anything. Although he was a Martial Marquis, he still didn’t dare to act up in front of the Yan family.

“I’ll give you three days. If you can’t handle this matter well, you can die!” After saying this, Yan Sihai hung up the phone.

Just as Yan Sihai hung up the phone, Yan Sihai’s phone rang again.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was Sea City’s Teng Gong.
