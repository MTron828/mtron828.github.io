Chapter 512: Activating the Power of the Dragon Vein! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The stone tablet shattered layer by layer before turning into ruins in the blink of an eye!

And beneath the stone tablet, there was indeed a treasure hidden!

At a glance, there were several thousand-year-old herbs, a long-standing Magic Artifact, and a cultivation technique!

Any one of them could be considered top-notch! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“There are indeed herbs!” Qin Yu was somewhat excited!

As long as he obtained these five thousand years old herbs, Qin Yu would be able to refine the Reincarnation Pill and step into the true half-step Martial Marquis realm!

Qin Yu was extremely confident in himself. He believed that after stepping into the half-step Martial Marquis realm, no half-step Martial Marquis in the world could be compared to him!

Even when facing a Martial Marquis, Qin Yu would have the strength to fight!

He had a chaotic body, the number one constitution in the world!

“There really are treasures!” Yan Yuqi and the others were even more excited!

As expected, this trip wasn’t in vain!

The only strange thing was that even after herbs thousands of years old were unearthed, they still couldn’t feel any spiritual energy!

“This is really strange.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After the treasures were unearthed, the atmosphere at the scene became a little strange.

“I only want a stalk of 5,000-year-old herbs. As for the rest, I won’t touch them.” Qin Yu was the first to break the stiff atmosphere.

When Xia Hang heard this, he smiled and said, “A stalk of 5,000-year-old herbs? Your tone is quite nonchalant.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “What do you mean?”

Xia Hang narrowed his eyes and said, “Who do you think you are?! You want a stalk of 5,000-year-old herbs? Why don’t you get a look in the mirror!”

“Qin Yu, you are just a lowly ant that Miss Yan has taken a fancy to. No matter how high an ant climbs, it’s just a plaything for us upper-class people!”

“You want herbs? Fine, kneel down and beg me. Maybe I can consider giving you some scraps!”

Xia Hang’s sudden change in attitude made him dumbfounded.

Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

He said coldly, “What if I insist on taking it?”

“You can try!” Xia Hang said coldly.

Qin Yu snorted. He immediately stretched out his hand and was ready to take the herbs.

At this time, a terrifying internal qi was coming toward Qin Yu’s palm!

Qin Yu’s expression changed when he felt this internal qi.

He hurriedly withdrew his hand, and that internal qi brushed past Qin Yu’s palm!

What was shocking was that this internal qi actually left a bloody mark on Qin Yu’s hand!

It was just an ordinary internal qi, but it actually cut through Qin Yu’s indestructible body!

What kind of power was this?!

One had to know that it was very difficult for an ordinary half-step Martial Marquis to hurt Qin Yu now!

Xia Hang narrowed his eyes and said, “The Jingdu Martial Arts Association always plans things flawlessly. We have predicted all possible problems, including you!”

“Guess why the Jingdu Martial Arts Association would let a half-step Martial Marquis like me lead the team?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but there was a trace of unease in his heart.

“That’s because... I can activate the power of nature!” Xia Hang roared!

He pointed at the broken stone tablet and said coldly, “After this stone tablet was broken, the power of the Dragon Vein was released!”

“The power of the Dragon Vein can even fight against Martial Marquises. Qin Yu, do you think you’re a match?!”

Qin Yu’s expression became more and more unsightly.

If he had known this would happen, he would have killed Xia Hang in the beginning!

“Qin Yu, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has always viewed you as an eye sore. They were just about to look for you, but they didn’t expect you to come knocking on their door,” Xia Hang said sinisterly.

“Since that’s the case, I’ll take this opportunity to kill you today!”

As he spoke, Xia Hang’s palm shook, and a terrifying force appeared out of thin air!

“Boom!”

This force was extremely fast and arrived in front of Qin Yu in the blink of an eye!

With such a fast speed, it was too late even if he used Shrinking Ground Into An Inch!

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!”

In a moment of desperation, Qin Yu could only clench his fist and face it head on!

“Boom!”

A huge force exploded on Qin Yu’s fist!

A horrifying scene appeared. That force actually shattered Qin Yu’s fist and even his arm was damaged!

“How could this be...” Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly!

He knew that this force was formidable, but he didn’t expect it to be so powerful!

“I said, the power of the Dragon Vein is enough to fight against a Martial Marquis.” Xia Hang sneered.

“You are only a half-step Martial Marquis. Killing you is a piece of cake!”

Qin Yu’s expression became more and more serious.

He took a look at the herbs in the pit and couldn’t help but grit his teeth.

This herb was too important to Qin Yu. He was unwilling to give up just like that!

“I can only fight to the death.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He immediately activated the Divine Dragon Power and prepared to fight Xia Hang to the death.

“You don’t know your place.” Xia Hang sneered at this.

He raised his finger and stuck close to Qin Yu’s side, then a terrifying energy burst out!

“Bang!”

Qin Yu retreated dozens of steps, and the golden light of his body was pierced through!

“Oh no.” Qin Yu seemed to have guessed something.

On this Dragon Vein, Xia Hang had immense power.

This power came out of thin air and could be born from Qin Yu’s side. There was no way to hide!

“Everyone says that your physical body is strong, but today, it seems that it’s just so-so.” Xia Hang sneered.

“F * ck you!”

Qin Yu roared, he used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch while taking the initiative to attack!

However, Xia Hang only raised his finger and a powerful force sent Qin Yu flying!

This wasn’t Xia Hang’s power, but the power of the Dragon Bloodline!

This force was simply not something that ordinary people could resist.

Even if Qin Yu’s body was extremely tough, it still couldn’t resist it!

“If you’re too greedy, you’ll get yourself killed.” Xia Hang sneered.

“To be honest, from the first time I saw you, I found you very unpleasant.”

“You’re clearly a bottom-level person with nothing, but the way you look at me wasn’t the slightest bit fearful! Where did your confidence come from!?”

“You rebellious ant!”

Along with Xia Hang’s angry roar, another wave of violent power came over!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu was smashed into the ground by this slap!

Traces of cracks appeared on his body, and traces of blood seeped out of his pores!

“Such... Such powerful strength...” Qin Yu gritted his teeth while feeling as if all the bones in his body were about to shatter!

Then, Xia Hang walked toward Qin Yu step by step.

He looked down at Qin Yu and sneered. “Can’t you just be a good-for-nothing? Why do you have to get involved in such complicated matters?”

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to listen to him. All he could think of was how to escape.

“Since you don’t want to be a good-for-nothing, then I’ll turn you into a good-for-nothing,” Xia Hang sneered.

As he spoke, he raised his finger again and aimed at Qin Yu’s dantian.
