2488 The Gu Family’s Battle Armor

“Get lost.”

Xiao Sheng’s body floated up and arrived in front of Gu Baiyi.

Immortal Crane smiled and shook his head. The Vermilion Bird and Azure Dragon immediately retreated.

But they did not stay idle and attacked the others again.

In an instant, Xiao Sheng launched an attack on Gu Baiyi.

“I’ll go and help. Martial Uncle is no match for Xiao Sheng.”

Many people could tell from the exchange of their fists.

Likewise, Gu Baiyi took the aggressive path.

With a punch, it triggered the most ferocious power of the tsunami of the Rules of Water. Her chest shook violently when it met Xiao Sheng’s fist.

While her arms were shaking, Xiao Sheng seemed to be fine.

“You’re my opponent!”

The Vermilion Bird’s wings slashed downward like steel blades, almost cutting Saintess Gu into halves.

Qin Yu, Yan Ruoxue, Flower Granny Hua, and Lei Xin wanted to help.

However, they were blocked by Black Tortoise, Nightmare, White Tiger, and Unicorn.

Besides them, there were even nine-tailed foxes, sky-connecting giant apes, thunderbirds, black dragons, and others circling, blocking their route of providing support.

These were the kings of various races. At this moment, their strength had reached the Tribulation Fifth Level.

Even if the four used all their strength, along with Chang Mang, Jue Wu, and Elder Guai, they could not break through the multiple defenses.

Qin Yu and the others did not hold back at all, coupled with Chang Ye, Mei Li, and others who came out from purgatory.

There were also the newly joined powerful rogue cultivators. They could be considered to have gone all out.

However, on this vast battlefield, it was soldiers against soldiers and generals against generals.

As long as there were human race cultivators or powerful individuals among the demon race killing a few people, it was bound to attract the attention of the other side. They would not simply allow you the chance to crush and slaughter.

As the attack of the demon race was sudden, only Human Race Watch, being the closest, rushed over.

Only a handful of others came to render support. The human race had a slight advantage in number compared with the demon race.

However, they were completely dominated and suppressed in terms of high-end combat power.

The battle only lasted less than 15 minutes, but the Gu family cultivators suffered heavy losses while the Human Race Watch hundreds of casualties.

“Boom!”

Gu Baiyi was punched by Xiao Sheng onto the ground. Her face had a strange shade of red. She had gone all out.

“Why aren’t you attacking? Are you waiting for Martial Uncle to be killed?”

Saintess Gu roared at Teng Zixu.

“Revered Qi wants me to keep an eye on Qin Yu.”

Teng Zixu sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, and his body did not move at all.

“Come on, I, Gu Baiyi, am not that weak to need help.”

Gu Baiyi revealed a cold smile as her face turned abnormally red.

The heaven and earth seemed to have a trace of celestial music of rain. They were the sound of pouring rain, the ebb and flow of tides, the roaring waves of oceans and lakes, the gentle flow of mountain springs, and even the tidal rhythms between the stars.

At this moment, under the guidance of the techniques in Gu Baiyi’s hands, they gathered on her body.

Using the power of the origin of the Path of Heaven, she guided the power of water in the world to her soul.

In the air, countless rivers formed veins and blood vessels, and countless waterfalls formed muscles.

The vast interstellar tidal force became the dragon’s head, and the boundless water of the ocean gathered into its internal organs.

A pale and translucent water dragon appeared in the void, its body gurgling.

Each scale shimmered with the radiant brilliance of the sun, its body slender and agile, adorned with water patterns, emitting drifting mists from its surface from time to time.

The water dragon seemed to have a life of its own. Its eyes were either dark blue or emerald green, flickering with a mysterious light.

It formed a huge wave and the power of the vast water. Almost everyone felt a mountain-like force falling on their bodies.

In an instant, even the battle between Qin Yu and the others and the demon race divine beasts temporarily stopped.

Both sides simultaneously looked up at the fierce battle unfolding in the sky.

“Ah!”

Gu Baiyi’s eyes suddenly turned blood-red, and a shocking amount of blood seeped out from her pupils.

This power had exceeded her limit.

It was as if a youngster swinging a hundred-pound hammer.

Even if he picked it up, it would cause tremendous damage to his body.

“Water Dragon’s Roar!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The water dragon let out a mighty roar.

After a deafening dragon’s roar that shook the heavens and the earth, even the Azure Dragon seemed to feel a tremor from the soul as if a true dragon of heaven.

“As expected of the Bai family’s battle armor. It’s a pity that the battle armor will no longer exist after today.”

Immortal Crane sat on a recliner, watching the battle in the sky leisurely.

Xiao Sheng’s body shot into the sky like an arrow released from a bow, disappearing into the end of the sky.

In everyone’s shocked expression, the entire sky, or perhaps the entire universe, seemed to have started changing.

As Xiao Sheng raised his fist, heaven and earth seemed to have entered his body like a vortex.

Unity of Heaven and Earth.

When the punch landed, the universe was as if descending.

The fist clashed with the water dragon.

Everyone lost their divine senses. In these few seconds, even Qin Yu could not sense anything.

It was as if everything in the surrounding area had turned into nothingness as the two clashed.

After a while, that strange sensation finally returned to normal.

A white figure was lying on the ground, fate unknown. Xiao Sheng stood on the ground with a pale face.

“Martial Uncle!”

Saintess Gu let out a shrill scream. Her body emanated a tremendously condensed internal qi.

She actually burned her blood essence and began to fight desperately.

The demon race was also frantically blocking. Both sides began to fight with all their might.

In that instant, the number of dead living beings surpassed all the previous numbers.

The demon race wanted Gu Baiyi to die, but the human race wanted to keep her alive.

In the air, a giant hand suddenly reached out and grabbed Xiao Sheng.

“You finally couldn’t help but attack, Revered Qi?”

Immortal Crane smiled faintly.

A demonic cloud suddenly seized the giant hand, pulling Xiao Sheng back to their side.

After the giant hand made its move, it seemed to have realized that it could not get what it wanted and thus completely disappeared.

All of a sudden, almost all the Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators sensed an unusual spatial fluctuation. It was as if a powerful person had torn open space.

Subsequently, an earth-shattering tremor came, and a terrifying earthquake seemed to have occurred in the Gu family’s land.

Along the way, mountain torrents erupted and volcanoes spewed out. It was a scene of the end of the world.

“Phew, they’re finally here.”

Immortal Crane stood up and stretched.

A tremendously furious voice came from the depths of the void.

The furious sound wave even distorted the space.

“That’s the direction of the Yan family! We’ve been tricked!”

Yan Ruoxue’s face turned ashen.

“Qin Yu, come visit the demon race when you’re available. We want to retreat now.”

Immortal Crane smiled at Qin Yu and then casually clapped.

With this wave, the air seemed to have turned into a flowing river.
