After posting this comment, Qin Yu tried to post a clarification.

However, he soon discovered that the post would be immediately deleted!

As long as it was related to Yan Ruoxue or the Yan family, it was impossible to post it!

The media was completely controlled by the Han family. Qin Yu had to bear the blame, no matter what.

“The Han family is really shameless.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel angry.

At this moment, Han Wei called.

When he picked up the phone, he heard Han Wei laughing loudly. “Qin Yu, how is it? Did your previous publicity stunt work? As long as I use some tricks, I can distort the truth!”

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “You can control it for a while, but you can’t control it for a lifetime.”

“Really?” Han Wei sneered.

“Han Wei, four months later, I hope you can still be as confident as you are now,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Han Wei sneered and said, “It seems that you don’t know the difference between an Inner Strength Grandmaster and a half-step Martial Marquis.”

Qin Yu also sneered and said, “If you don’t want to die, you’d better think of a way to step into the Martial Marquis realm.”

After saying this, Qin Yu directly hung up the phone.

Originally, Qin Yu was indeed confident that he could defeat Han Wei. After all, the chaotic body wasn’t afraid of anyone at the same level.

But now that Han Wei had stepped into the realm of half-step Martial Marquis, it indeed gave Qin Yu great pressure.

“It seems that I have to change the plan temporarily.” Qin Yu thought inside.

He had originally planned to use these four months to expand his own power, but now, it seemed like he didn’t have the time.

Qin Yu didn’t sleep the whole night.

After the Han family controlled the media, everyone treated Qin Yu as an ungrateful wretch.

Therefore, on the Martial Arts Forum, there was a wave of abuse towards Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu knew very well that these rumors weren’t the root cause.

The root cause was because Qin Yu had the Meridian Circulation Technique to break through the stairway to heaven. Those rumors only gave them an excuse to condemn Qin Yu.

“I hope you guys can come in time.” Qin Yu’s expression was cold as he whispered.

It was just as Qin Yu thought.

At this moment, there were indeed a few people who were ready to take the opportunity to kill him.

And among these people, there were all kinds of organizations.

There were aristocratic families, experts, and even people from the Martial Arts Forum.

Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to leave. He was waiting for these people to arrive.

On this day, there were more than ten people gathered by the riverbank of Yunchuan City.

These people came from all over the world. Without exception, they were all at the peak of the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm!

Some of them hadn’t appeared in the world for many years, and now, they were also participating.

As more and more people came, the internal qi by the river also began to become more dense.

At this moment, a figure stepped on the river water and walked over!

“Traveling by river ? What a good trick!” Someone exclaimed!

Soon, an old man with white hair stood in front of the crowd.

“Elder Zhuo? I didn’t expect you to come!” Someone recognized this old man!

“It’s Elder Zhuo? It was rumored that you entered a secret realm and died. I didn’t expect you to still be alive!”

The old man called Elder Zhuo put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I almost died ten years ago, but it was a blessing in disguise. After ten years of recuperation, my strength has improved again.”

“You’ve entered the realm of Martial Marquis?” Someone asked in surprise.

Elder Zhuo shook his head and said, “I’m only one step away from the half-step Martial Marquis realm.”

Just as everyone was lamenting, another man with a sturdy back and a thick waist walked over from not far away!

This man was tall and big, his muscles were cowardly, and his skin was like a layer of iron armor that wrapped around his entire body!

“Cross-training Grandmaster, Huang Biao!”

“It is said that Huang Biao’s physical body has long surpassed the limits of human beings. Back then, he even withstood a cannonball!”

“Mr. Huang, I didn’t expect you to come as well!”

Huang Biao said indifferently, “I, Huang Biao, have trained my entire life and have never met an opponent. Now that I’ve heard of a sharp-tongued brat claiming to have an unparalleled physical body, I, Huang Biao, would like to see him.”

“Mr. Huang, your physical body is truly unparalleled in the world!” Everyone praised him.

At this moment, a young man with a green hat on his head also sneaked in.

He had his hands behind his back and he looked like a top-notch martial artist.

However, the internal qi on his body was extremely low, as if he was only at the Inner Strength Past Master realm.

“This man is?” Someone knocked on his head and asked.

The other party coughed and said indifferently, “I am Jiang He’s disciple. My name is Qing Yao.”

“Jiang He’s disciple?” Hearing this title, everyone gasped!

He was someone that was ranked first on par with Ye Qing!

“How is Old Mister Jiang?” Everyone asked one after another.

“I didn’t expect Old Mister Jiang to actually send someone here!”

“With your participation, Qin Yu will definitely die!”

Qing Yao placed his hands behind her back and said indifferently, “Of course. My master is very interested in this Meridian Circulation Technique, so he sent me here.”

“That’s right. Back then, Old Mister Jiang seemed to have failed to break through the stairway to heaven,” someone said.

Qing Yao raised his hand and slapped his face. He cursed, “How dare you?! Are you insulting my master?!”

The beaten Inner Strength Grandmaster hurriedly waved his hand and said, “No... I don’t dare to. I’m just saying casually.”

“Mr. Qing, as Old Mister Jiang’s disciple, why are you only in the Inner Strength Past Master realm?” Someone asked in puzzlement.

Qing Yao widened his eyes and slapped him again!

“My master didn’t want me to be too high-profile, so he used a secret technique to cover up my internal qi.” Qing Yao cursed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The other party was naturally unhappy after being slapped.

However, thinking of his identity as “Jiang He’s disciple,” he still suppressed his anger.

“Alright, stop talking nonsense. You all have to listen to my arrangements, understand?” Qing Yao said smugly.

Everyone looked at each other and their eyes were filled with doubt.

Qing Yao... seemed a bit off.

As Jiang He’s disciple, how could he be so rude?

Jiang He had always been humble and polite. How could he have taught such an arrogant disciple?

Although they thought so, they didn’t dare to ask.

After all, if he really was Jiang He’s disciple, it would be troublesome.

At this time, another person walked over from not far away.

This person’s expression was calm, making it hard for others to figure out his identity.

“Who are you?” Someone took a step forward and asked first.

The other party glanced at him and said coldly, “Sea City’s Formation Master, Li Zinan.”

“Formation Master?”

“I heard Qin Yu also knows a lot about formation.”

“But... we all know the famous Formation Masters. Why haven’t we heard of your name?”

Li Zinan glanced at him and coldly said, “Are you doubting my ability? To be honest, I have already set up a killing formation here. Do you want to give it a try?”

The other party also said with some displeasure, “Oh really? Is that so? I really want to give it a try.”

“Okay.” Li Zinan didn’t say anything. He just gently waved his hand.

In an instant, the other party’s body directly exploded into a cloud of blood mist!

“This is the formation,” Li Zinan said coldly.

This made everyone’s expressions change!

They didn’t even know how Li Zinan killed him!

“Mr. Li is indeed powerful!” Everyone cupped their hands and said politely.

“Everyone, let’s just leave today. Three days later, I will inform everyone of the time and place,” Elder Zhuo said.

“Okay! See you in three days!”

Everyone left one after another, and the riverside returned to its calm state.

After everyone left, Qing Yao took off his hat and revealed Yao Qing’s face.

“D*mn, that was close. I was scared to death.” Yao Qing patted his chest and said in a low voice.
