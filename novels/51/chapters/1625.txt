Chapter 1626: Chapter 1,626, the Lord of the northern lands descends Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Back then, there was a body refinement master who wanted to use the purple-red heaven flame to refine his body. Unfortunately, when he was five meters away from the abandoned pool, he melted into ashes.

This was the end of a generation of masters.

From then on, no one dared to have any designs on the purple-red heaven flame. Qin Yu was the second.

The Brawny man put down the work in his hands and looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

Qin Yu suddenly stopped when he was ten meters away from the abandoned pool.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was already emitting a golden color, and layers of secret sweat kept pouring out.

Seeing this, the Brawny man couldn’t help but sneer, “At least this kid is tactful. If he gets any closer, I’m afraid he will be burnt to Ashes.”

After saying this, the burly man turned around and was about to leave.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who had stopped, took another step forward.

Compared to before, Qin Yu this time appeared more calm and unhurried.

“HM?”Seeing this scene, the burly man, who was about to leave, immediately stopped.

He frowned slightly and stared at Qin Yu.

Nine meters, eight meters, seven meters, six meters...

Soon, Qin Yu had reached the five-meter boundary.

At this moment, the Burly Man’s heart couldn’t help but hang in the air.

Beside him, Xiao Cao also gently covered her mouth to hide the nervousness in her heart.

In the next second, Qin Yu directly crossed the five-meter boundary and walked toward the activation pool at an even faster speed.

In less than a second, Qin Yu arrived at the side of the activation pool.

“How is this possible!”Seeing this, the brawny man immediately widened his eyes.

Xiao Cao’s beautiful eyes were even more surprised. As the daughter of a refiner, she knew what this purple-red heaven fire meant!

However, this did not stop. Qin Yu took a step forward and directly stepped into the activation pool!

The purple flames instantly enveloped Qin Yu! However, Qin Yu’s body was emitting an even more resplendent golden radiance!

The two kinds of radiance reflected each other, making it seem extremely mysterious!

“This... how is this possible!”The Brawny Man stood up straight, his eyes filled with shock!

In the activation pool, Qin Yu was resisting the purple-red heaven flames.

He was not as relaxed as he looked on the surface. The power of the purple-red heaven fire was beyond imagination, and the pain was unbearable!

Qin Yu endured the pain and muttered in a low voice, “As expected of the purple-red heaven fire. This is only a discarded heaven fire. If it were the flames in the purple-red volcano, I’m afraid it would be burnt to ashes in an instant...”

Thinking of this, Qin Yu waved his hand in the direction of the brawny man and said, “Big Brother, thank you!”

“AH.”The Brawny man came back to his senses and said somewhat embarrassedly, “It’s... It’s fine.”

With that, the Brawny man quickly walked to Wen Wanyun’s side.

“Who exactly is this young man?”The Brawny Man Couldn’t help but ask.

Wen wanyun glanced at him and said somewhat proudly, “My disciple, Qin Yu!”

“Qin Yu? He’s that Qin Yu? !”The eyes of the Brawny Man and Xiao Cao revealed a look of shock.

“That’s right, and I am the famous Wen Wanye!”Wen wanye said proudly.

However, the muscular man and Xiao Cao did not pay any attention to Wen wanye. They stared at Qin Yu who was bathing in the purple-red heaven flame and whispered, “No wonder, this Qin Yu really lives up to his reputation...”

In the abandoned pool, Qin Yu was enduring this heart-wrenching pain.

Even though his physical body was incomparably strong, he was still in extreme pain when faced with this flame.

The flame was eroding his skin, melting his physical body inch by inch.

The pain was unimaginable. The destruction of his physical body made Qin Yu’s life worse than death.

He circulated the meridian circulation technique, allowing his physical body to slowly regenerate.

At Qin Yu’s realm, even if his physical body was destroyed, he would slowly regenerate, but the process was very slow.

Therefore, he had to rely on the meridian circulation technique to force his body to be constantly destroyed and reconstructed.

Although it was more efficient, it would definitely be more painful.

Xiao Cao and the muscular man were dumbfounded. They had been born in the refining city for so long, but this was the first time they had seen such a scene!

“He really uses his body as a divine weapon to temper himself...”the muscular man murmured.

“This is too crazy...”Xiao Cao could not help but whisper.

In the next few days, Qin Yu did not leave this abandoned pool.

He sat cross-legged in the abandoned pool, allowing the Flames to burn his body and then reconstruct it.

...

Just as Qin Yu was in seclusion to temper his body, the young lord of the northern lands had already quietly entered the realm.

He disguised himself as an elementalist and roamed around the major cities of the southern region.

That day, the elementalist arrived above the sky cloud sect.

He was dressed in a white robe that was as white as snow. He looked down from above and shouted, “The master of the northern lands, an elementalist, has come to pay a visit. Please fight with the sect master of the Sky Cloud Sect!”

With a loud shout, the entire Sky Cloud sect collapsed in an instant! His powerful true energy caused all the buildings to cease to exist!

The strength of an elementalist was evident!

The deputy sect master and the rest rushed out of the door and raised their heads to look at the elementalist.

“Who is the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect?”The elementalist asked coldly.

The deputy sect master looked at the elementalist and frowned. “Are you the Master of the Northern Lands?”

“I’m asking, who is the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect? !”The elementalist shouted again!

Under this shout, the deputy sect master was immediately shocked until he vomited blood and took a few steps back!

“Deputy Sect Master!”

The surrounding people quickly supported the deputy sect master.

The deputy sect master stood up from the ground. He endured the pain and said, “My sect master is not here. Please come again another day.”

Yuan Xiu sneered, “Everyone says that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect is invincible in the world. Why? Are you going to be a coward today? I think that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect is just an empty title!”

The deputy sect master was furious, but he knew that he was no match for the Elementalist, so he suppressed his anger.

“I’ll go and inform my sect master now. Please wait for a few days, senior,”said the deputy sect master.

The elementalist looked at the crowd and said coldly, “The southern region is just a bunch of trash. I’ll wait for him for a few days. If he doesn’t show up, the Southern Region will change its surname!”

After saying this, the elementalist instantly disappeared without a trace.

After he left, the surrounding people surrounded him. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“He... He’s the master of the Northern Region...”

“I didn’t expect the master of the northern region to come personally. This... what should we do...”

“The legendary Master of the Northern Region is actually a youth?”

Everyone in the Heavenly Cloud sect seemed to be panicking.

They knew clearly that the first to bear the brunt was definitely the heavenly cloud sect.

Only the vice sect leader at this moment was terrifyingly calm.

Not only was he not panicking in the slightest, he even revealed a smile.

This smile became more and more intense, and in the end, he even laughed out loud.

“Vice sect leader, you... you actually still have the mood to laugh?”

“AI, it’s over. The vice sect leader might have been scared silly. The Heavenly Cloud sect is going to be finished...”

The deputy sect leader glanced at them and sneered, “What do you know! Since the Northern Land’s leader is here, I believe that the sect leader should also make a move.”
