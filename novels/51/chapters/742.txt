Chapter 743: The Herb Is Mine! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu understood the meaning of the man with the mustache.

The birth of ten-thousand-year-old herb was different from the birth of other treasures.

Not only would it not reveal any earth-shaking phenomena in advance, but it would also be extremely low profile in order to cover its tracks.

Qin Yu sat there and waited quietly. He released his divine sense to cover his surroundings, afraid that he would miss any movement.

More than twenty Martial Marquises brought by Tang Mo guarded the surroundings, preventing anyone from coming to snatch it.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, two hours had passed.

At this time, the sky had gradually darkened, but the ten-thousand-year-old herb still showed no signs of coming into being.

“Could it really be that there’s something wrong with your deduction?” At this time, even Tang Mo couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “It shouldn’t be. We’ve been waiting for so long. It’s not too late now.”

Tang Mo spread out his hands and said, “Alright, I’ll wait with you.”

“Boom!”

Before Tang Mo’s voice had faded, thunder suddenly descended from the sky!

This bolt of lightning could be said to be earth-shattering. It directly smashed in front of everyone!

The powerful force even sent everyone flying!

“Get ready. The herb is about to be born.” Qin Yu hurriedly stood up and stared at this bolt of lightning.

He looked up and saw dark clouds in the sky. Rays of azure light were brewing in the dark clouds.

“Rumble.”

At this moment, the ground also began to make sounds, as if something was about to be unearthed.

Qin Yu suppressed the excitement in his heart. His eyes didn’t move.

He slightly clenched his fist, and his internal qi surrounded his body, ready to catch the herb at any time.

On the other side.

Granny Qin and the others were planning to leave Tang City and return to Jingdu.

In the airport restaurant, Granny Qin was eating.

Chou Heguang followed by her side, constantly flattering her.

At this moment, a heaven-shaking thunder suddenly flashed outside!

The loud sound even caused the airport to buzz!

“Is it going to rain?” Chou Heguang asked in surprise.

Before he could finish his words, a voice came from the airport. It said that due to the weather, the flight would be delayed, and the exact time would be announced.

Hearing this, Granny Qin frowned even more.

“The weather is fine, so why is there suddenly thunder?” Granny Qin put down the chopsticks in her hand and looked at the sky.

“Sigh, the weather in Tang City is just like this.” Chou Heguang disagreed.

Granny Qin remained silent. She turned around and walked out of the airport. She raised her head and looked in the direction where the Heavenly Thunder had exploded.

“That direction. seems to be the direction where Qin Yu is.” Granny Qin frowned tightly. She suddenly had a bad premonition in her heart.

“Granny Qin, you’re worrying too much. This is just a normal change in the weather.” Chou Heguang still didn’t realize anything.

“Boom!”

Another bolt of lightning struck down!

Following that, the dark cloud turned into seven colors. It was extremely dazzling!

For a moment, everyone took out their phones and wanted to take pictures of this strange scene!

“Seven-colored auspicious cloud. the sign of the birth of a treasure! Oh no!” Granny Qin suddenly realized something!

Chou Heguang’s deduction might really have been wrong!

“Granny Qin, this isn’t a seven-colored auspicious cloud.” Chou Heguang also realized that something was wrong and quickly explained.

Granny Qin glanced at Chou Heguang coldly and said, “I’ll settle the score with you later!”

After saying this, Granny Qin looked at the many purple-robed men and shouted, “Everyone, follow me back!”

The group of people left the airport in a hurry and rushed towards Qin Yu’s direction!

Granny Qin wasn’t the only one. The other Martial Marquises also noticed this strange phenomenon.

“Granny Qin should have already left Tang City. I might have a chance!” Some Martial Marquises thought to themselves.

Thus, many Martial Marquises rushed towards Qin Yu’s direction!

.

At this moment, Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the seven-colored auspicious cloud.

“Oh no, this kind of abnormal phenomenon will definitely attract the attention of martial artists and they will fight over it.” Qin Yu said with a frown.

The man with the mustache wasn’t very worried. He said with a smile, “Don’t worry, the emergence of ten-thousand-year-old herb is extremely fast. It won’t be brewing for too long. I believe that before they rush over, we will be able to obtain this medicinal herb.”

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu was still a little worried.

If there was a top-tier Martial Marquis nearby, a great battle would inevitably occur.

“Young Master Tang, it’s all up to you,” Qin Yu said.

Tang Mo patted his chest and said, “Don’t worry!”

At this moment, an extremely dazzling light suddenly flashed in the air!

Then, one could faintly see the emergence of herb within the light!

“This is it!” Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste time. He immediately stomped his feet and shot towards the herb!

“This ten-thousand-year-old herb belongs to me!”

At this moment, several figures suddenly shot out from the darkness! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

And their target was also the ten-thousand-year-old herb!

“Oh no!”

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed!

He never expected that there were actually so many people hiding nearby!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to dwell on it. He immediately charged towards the herb!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, someone suddenly attacked Qin Yu!

A huge palm seemed to suddenly appear from the void and grabbed towards Qin Yu!

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!”

Qin Yu shouted loudly and immediately threw a punch!

Thatpalm was instantly shattered by Qin Yu’s palm!

“Hmph, this herb is mine!” At this moment, another ray of light shot towards Qin Yu explosively!

This ray of light was extremely resplendent and contained the might of a Martial Saint!

“Oh no! It’s a Martial Saint’s weapon!” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

At this critical moment, Tang Mo walked over with a folding fan in his hand!

He waved the folding fan in his hand and directly dispersed the might of this Martial Saint weapon!

At the same time, the man with the mustache also rushed forward! Even Xiao Yu joined the battle!

“Qin Yu, go and get the herb. Leave the rest to us,” said Tang Mo.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you!”

With the help of everyone, Qin Yu instantly had much less pressure.

He used all his strength and shot towards the herb!

“Swoosh!”

Under Qin Yu’s feet, several rays of light that looked like tentacles suddenly burst out and wrapped around Qin Yu’s calves!

“Chi la!”

At this moment, a sharp blade suddenly appeared in the man with the mustache’s hand and directly cut off these tentacles!

Tang Mo even ordered more than twenty Martial Marquises to do their best to stop the crowd from taking the first step!

Qin Yu stared fixedly at the ray of light. He stretched out his palm and grabbed it anxiously.

He was only five steps away, three steps, one step...

“I got it!”

Just as Qin Yu’s hand reached out, a huge hand suddenly appeared and grabbed the ten-thousand-year-old herb!

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed. He looked up and saw a man in a black robe standing in front of him!

His figure seemed to have suddenly appeared. Clearly, he had used some spatial spell!

“It’s you!” When he saw the person in front of him, Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed.
