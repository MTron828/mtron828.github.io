2277 The Masked Woman? Xiao Yu?

Qin Yu moved at a terrifying speed and arrived behind the evil exterminator.

The Soul Torment Mind Technique wildly surged with frantic vitality, and the overwhelmingly vast divine sense surged out like a spring.

The Spiritualization Technique arrived first. His soul turned into a form entwined on the dragon’s head like a demon god hibernating on the fire dragon’s body. Looking into the distance, a demon god thousands of feet tall stood above the fiery and dark dragons.

The combination of the Spiritualization Technique and the Soul Torment Mind Technique made this attack even more ferocious.

It was the most powerful attack Qin Yu could use at the moment. A shocking attack suddenly slashed toward the evil exterminator’s head.

“Dodge!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically.

Although he knew Xiao Yu, she, at this moment, was no longer herself.

Before him was the masked woman of the nine lifetimes who had killed people like flies, and Qin Yu, also a human, could not accept her massacre in purgatory.

Although he did not have a good impression of the evil exterminator, he did not want him to die because of him.

“Have you forgotten? This is my body!”

Qin Yu’s cold voice echoed from the depths of divine sense. The black divine sense controlling Qin Yu’s body suddenly faltered. The fear that penetrated deep in his soul gave Qin Yu a slight chance to catch his breath. It was a seed that he had bet his life on previously to suppress the black divine sense.

The seed that he had planted previously finally took effect. His divine sense suddenly leaped and seized some control of his body.

The veins on Qin Yu’s face bulged. His teeth were deeply embedded in his gums. He was completely unaware that blood was seeping out. The moment the fire dragon was about to hit the evil exterminator, it suddenly turned and collided with Chang Ye’s talisman.

At this moment, the masked woman’s fist and the Evil Extermination Sword collided.

The two shattered almost at the same time. The Evil Extermination Sword emitted a loud sword chant, and the position between the sword and the fist tip trembled frantically.

One black line after another appeared on the Evil Extermination Sword and the masked woman’s fist. After that, the black lines spread out like a spider web.

The Evil Extermination Sword shattered, and the black lines on the masked woman’s body suddenly exploded.

A cloud of blood mist exploded between the two of them. Qin Yu could only vaguely see a body crash to the ground.

Following that, the space began to tremble violently.

Under this terrifying attack, a massive black hole appeared in the middle.

Qin Yu’s hair swayed wildly. He tried to stabilize his body with all his might, but even with his full strength, he could not stabilize his feet. In the next moment, Qin Yu’s body was swept off the ground by the violent suction force of the black hole. His body flew up uncontrollably.

At that moment, even if they possessed extraordinary cultivation, they had no idea where they would be drifting along with the black hole.

Mei Li raised both her hands and shook them. A blood river broke through the void and fell into the black hole like a waterfall. In an instant, the vast blood river blocked most of the suction force.

The suction force suddenly decreased. Only then could Qin Yu stabilize his body.

Amid the chaos, Qin Yu felt his Sumeru ring become restless. He felt an internal qi crash into his body and swiftly entered the Sumeru ring like a swimming dragon.

Even when Qin Yu used chaotic power, he could not resist this internal qi. However, at this moment, he could not divert his attention to examine this aura.

The black hole lasted for a quarter-hour before it slowly dissipated. Mei Li’s blood river also helped the others block it for a quarter-hour before it retracted. She sat on the ground with a pale face as if she had consumed too much spiritual energy.

At this moment, the evil exterminator was sitting cross-legged on the ground, covered in blood. His hands were broken, and most of his shoulders shattered. He sat cross-legged on the ground, and his expression did not change at all as if he was not the one injured.

Chang Ye, Situ Haoyue, and Gu Ming were also unconscious.

Wu Feng and Zong Yue had already died on the spot as they were swept into the air currents during the battle. The terrifying shockwaves tore them apart into pieces.

Only Uncle Ling, Mei Li, Xi Menn, and Qin Yu could still stand at this moment.

Even though the battle had ended in this sealed space, dense black lightning bolts were continuously shooting out from the void above them. The massive lightning bolts seemed to have flattened the place.

Qin Yu moved like lightning to the masked woman’s side. He used his divine sense to probe into Xiao Yu’s body.

At this moment, there was no trace of ghostly qi in Xiao Yu’s body. There was only normal spiritual energy fluctuation.

That feeling was the same as the Xiao Yu that Qin Yu knew before. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Xiao Yu?”

Qin Yu tentatively called out to Xiao Yu in his divine sense.

Her beautiful eyes moved a few times as if she was responding to Qin Yu. However, she did not wake up, perhaps because of exhaustion.

“It’s indeed Xiao Yu. Where’s the masked woman? Where did the masked woman’s divine sense go? Could it be that the masked woman of the ninth lifetime died just like that?”

Many doubts surged in Qin Yu’s mind. Everything seemed a little unreal.

With a thought, the Sumeru qi wrapped around Xiao Yu and sent her into the Sumeru Space.

“Boom!”

A terrifying soul suction force came behind him, shattering the Sumeru qi.

“The woman of nine lifetimes must die!”

“The woman of nine lifetimes has already been exterminated. She’s just a little girl who knows nothing.”

Qin Yu stood up and said.

“Outrageous! Even if she were an ordinary person, she is still culpable being the vessel bearing the soul of the woman of nine lifetimes.”

Uncle Ling’s killing intent was overflowing.

“Bullsh*t! The masked woman’s soul has shattered. I don’t believe you didn’t see it. This little girl is my friend. If you want to touch her, ask me first!”

Qin Yu was furious. It was good enough that he could survive the evil exterminator. He would not take someone like Uncle Ling seriously.

“Soul Vortex!”

Uncle Ling suddenly attacked.

“Fire Fist!”

The giant fist of flames shattered the vortex directly. Uncle Ling took a few steps back, and his face flushed red.

He was a soul cultivator, and his soul cultivation might have already reached ninth grade.

However, facing Qin Yu, who cultivated the Soul Torment Mind Technique and had experienced the path of reincarnation, coupled with the fact that he had exhausted himself in the battle just now, his soul cultivation methods had very limited effect on Qin Yu.

“Do you really want to protect her? This will make you the target of everyone. You must know that about two-thirds of the cultivators outside were killed by this woman. Are you sure you can withstand the resentment of those who died?”
