2241 The Intrigues and Power Struggles with the Master Refiner

“Unfortunately, these two magical artifacts have lost their artifact souls. Even after the repair, they can only display the power of Saint Weapon at most.”

Seeing the key, the dwarf sighed.

“There’s no way to repair these artifact souls?”

Qin Yu frowned. The two magical artifacts had resisted Xing Xiu’s last attack, and he did not expect them to be so severely damaged.

“The creation of the artifact soul requires the user to refine it for thousands of years, or refine a suitable soul and seal in it before the two magical artifacts can be used again.”

The dwarf shook his head. It was no longer something that could be recovered with just skills.

“A suitable soul?”

Qin Yu suddenly thought of Demon King Xuan Yuan. It was a demonic beast with defensive attributes and had inherited the black tortoise bloodline.

If he could obtain its soul and refine it into the Supreme Mountain of the Five Elements, he might be able to unleash the effects of this magical artifact again.

“Brother, how’s your skill? Can you forge magical artifact?”

Qin Yu suddenly remembered the hardwood that Elder Guai had given him. Elder Guai had refined that piece of wood for thousands of years, and its hardness had already surpassed most materials. Its grade should not be low if it could be forged into a magical artifact.

“Nonsense, as long as you can afford to pay, there’s no magical artifact that I can’t forge.”

The dwarf shouted impatiently as if he was dissatisfied with Qin Yu’s doubts.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and took out the locust tree shield.

“Can you modify this wooden block?”

“You have quite a lot of good stuff on you. It’s the wood of a locust tree, right? It’s rare to see such a hard locust tree. Even an ordinary defensive Saint Weapon can’t compare to this piece of wood.”

The dwarf looked surprised. He picked up a sharp knife beside him and slashed at the locust tree shield.

After the sound ended, not even a mark was left on the shield.

“This locust tree wood has been refined for a long time, and its artifact soul has already formed inside. If you want to forge it into a handy magical artifact, I need to add materials like Nine Heavens Profound Iron, refined steel stone, gold crystal stone, and meteorite stone. Furthermore, these materials are not cheap. I want a hundred spirit essences.”

The dwarf stared at Qin Yu and said, watching his reaction to the bid.

“Too expensive”

Qin Yu shook his head. A piece of spiritual essence was equivalent to more than 100 million spiritual senses. This dwarf was simply asking for an exorbitant price.

“I have another idea. You can listen and see.”

The dwarf revealed a crafty expression.

“Let’s hear it out first.”

Qin Yu said warily.

“Your robe has already lost its artifact soul. You can try to dissolve the material of this robe and mix it with my material on this locust tree. It might have a stunning effect. I can charge you a 50% discount for the modification fee.”

“But…” the dwarf said in a deep voice. “It may fail, and all the magical artifacts will be scrapped.”

“Bullsh*t, you d*mn stinky shorty. You fooled people like this previously. I gave you two supreme treasures, and you still want to fool people here!”

A middle-aged man nearby shouted with a flushed face. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hide in Solitary Cloud City for the rest of your life if you have the ability. I’ll chop you into 18 pieces when you get out. F*ck you!”

“In the refining process, there are always successes and failures. You only see the failures before you, but you don’t see the relentless efforts I put in behind the scenes. It’s not right to judge based solely on what you see.”

The dwarf tried to argue cunningly without blushing.

“Bullsh*t, you’re just a bullsh*t master refiner. You used our magical artifacts for your practice. You said you could increase their grades. I was really blind to believe your nonsense.”

Another person came over, and his saliva nearly spilled on Qin Yu’s face.

“Brother, don’t listen to them. I’m not here to practice. I’ll give you the best price of 30% off.”

When the dwarf saw so many people sabotage him, he became anxious.

Qin Yu ignored the dwarf. He looked at the magical artifacts on his table.

Qin Yu quietly unleashed his desolate divine eye, and the world before him suddenly turned black and white.

A pair of inconspicuous boots was casually placed in the corner of the table.

Countless white lines connected to the lines of the way.

To be able to resonate with the way of space was something that could only be done with a top-notch Saint Weapon.

Furthermore, there were so many lines of the way that Qin Yu had never discovered on any Saint Weapon.

“Brother, your suggestion is not bad, but it’s a little risky for me. How about this? I don’t want you to give me a discount.”

Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Alright, I knew it! Big Brother has an imposing appearance. Only you have such courage. I will definitely do my very best, and maybe I can refine a Tribulation Transcending magical artifact for you!”

The dwarf was overjoyed.

“But… I want to pick three of your treasures.”

Qin Yu pointed at the treasures on the stall and said with a smile.

“No, at most one. These treasures were all carefully refined by me. They all contain my blood and tears…”

The dwarf shook his head like a rattle drum.

“Alright. Sigh, I’m taking such a big risk. I feel like I’ve suffered a loss just by taking one. Forget it then…”

Qin Yu looked troubled.

“Okay, okay, okay! How can we forget about it when we’ve agreed on it? You said it yourself! Hahaha, let’s quickly make a vow!”

The dwarf jumped out of the stall and grabbed Qin Yu’s thigh, afraid that he would go back on his word.

Magical artifacts in this remote galaxy were tremendously precious. If a master refiner wanted to craft a weapon, besides preparing precious raw materials, he would also spend a lot of time.

Even for an experienced master refiner, a success rate of 30% to 40% was impressive enough.

Therefore, it was extremely rare to be able to refine other people’s top-notch magical artifacts.

“Alright, seeing you’re so enthusiastic…”

Qin Yu signed the vow with great reluctance.

Making a vow by the Path of Heavenly, other than the old antique who had descended from the previous Path of Heaven, no one else dared to break the vow.

“Then I’ll take this pair of boots. It just so happens that there’s a hole in the boots!”

Qin Yu grabbed the shoe in the corner.

The dwarf’s eyes widened. “Why…why…why do you want this? Look, there’re plenty of excellent treasures on the stall. This fire bead seals a volcano in it. Once unleashed, it can turn an area of a hundred meters into a lifeless wasteland! There’s also this overturning mountain seal.”

“Haha, no need, no need. I just want this.”

Qin Yu laughed loudly and stopped pretending.

With a thought, he unleashed his divine sense on the shoes.

After that, with a flick of his consciousness, the boots were already on his feet.

“Brother, what are these shoes called?”

Qin Yu was in a good mood.

“Gale Resistance Boots.”

The dwarf said through gritted teeth.

This boot was made from the complete skin of an ancient Golden-winged roc. After dissolving the materials, numerous precious ores were added. After the refining process, he spent decades carving dozens of gale formations on the boots. To avoid attracting attention, he had specially engraved formations to conceal its wind’s internal qi.
