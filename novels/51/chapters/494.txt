Chapter 495: Four Martial Marquis Weapons! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu stepped on the corpses like a war god and instantly arrived in the Great Hall!

When he saw Qin Yu’s crazy expression, Elder Qu’s expression also became slightly unsightly.

Even though there were Martial Marquis Weapons in the Great Hall, Qin Yu still made Elder Qu tremble with fear.

He took a deep breath and suppressed the fear inside. He said coldly, “Qin Yu, do you know where this is? This is the Saint Confucian Sect! It’s not a place where you can go on a rampage!”

Qin Yu clenched his teeth and fists. He glared at Elder Qu and said word by word, “The Pavilion Master was taken away by you, right?”

Elder Qu’s heart tensed up and his expression couldn’t help but change slightly.

“So what if... so what if I did?!” Elder Qu snorted coldly.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Then I will kill you and cut you into pieces!”

As Qin Yu spoke, the qi energy on Qin Yu’s body exploded once again!

The entire hall was instantly blown up. After he felt the power on Qin Yu’s body, Elder Qu’s face instantly turned pale.

“Qin Yu, you dare to trespass into the Saint Confucian Sect? That is a capital offense!” Elder Qu said through gritted teeth.

“Go to h*ll!” Qin Yu didn’t say anything else and threw a punch!

Elder Qu didn’t dare to take it head-on and hurriedly dodged to the side.

However, the powerful force sent Elder Qu flying, and traces of blood dripped from the corner of his mouth.

He felt a sharp pain in his chest, as if his internal organs had been greatly impacted.

“It’s impossible for a half-step Martial Marquis to possess such power...” Elder Qu’s expression was extremely unsightly.

“If I don’t use this Martial Marquis Weapon, this kid will probably tear down the Saint Confucian Sect!”

Thinking of this, Elder Qu crawled up from the ground.

He took a deep breath, looked coldly at Qin Yu, and said, “Qin Yu, you forced me to do this. The authority of the Saint Confucian Sect can’t be challenged!”

Qin Yu looked coldly at Elder Qu, as if he was looking at a person who was about to die.

This made Elder Qu extremely terrified. He didn’t dare to delay any longer and hurriedly took two steps back before starting to activate his Martial Marquis Weapon!

The four corners of the Great Hall instantly lit up with light.

Along with the appearance of these four rays of light, a majestic aura spread throughout the Great Hall.

A terrifying pressure rolled over as the four rays of energy that contained intense murderous internal qi slowly condensed.

Even Qin Yu had noticed these streams of energy.

He raised his head to look at the four corners and said coldly, “Looks like the Saint Confucian Sect has a treasure hidden somewhere.”

Elder Qu laughed coldly and said, “This is a Martial Marquis Weapon. It’s a personal magic weapon of a Martial Marquis. Although it can’t be compared to a true Martial Marquis, it can unleash the power of a Martial Marquis. Its power isn’t weaker than a true Martial Marquis’!”

“Qin Yu, no matter how strong you are, can you be stronger than a Martial Marquis? Under this attack, you will definitely die!”

Qin Yu’s expression was ice-cold. His entire body was glowing with golden light, and his eyes were coldly looking towards the four directions. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Go to h*ll!” Elder Qu shouted and immediately summoned the Martial Marquis Weapon!

In an instant, four terrifying waves of internal qi shot over!

“Boom!”

A huge force poured down on Qin Yu’s body!

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body was sent flying out of the main hall!

The golden light on his body was shattered and he fell to the ground without getting up for a long time!

“Hahaha!” Elder Qu couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“You deserve it. Qin Yu, serves you right!”

However, just as Elder Qu was laughing, Qin Yu, who had fallen to the ground, suddenly crawled up slowly.

Four bloody holes appeared on his body, but his internal qi didn’t decrease at all. Instead, he was full of fighting spirit!

“How... how could this be?!” Elder Qu’s expression immediately changed drastically!

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said coldly, “Today, I will cripple this Martial Marquis Weapon of yours.”

Qin Yu’s eyes slowly turned red.

And a mark appeared between his brows.

The power of the Divine Dragon!

This was the power of the Divine Dragon that Qin Yu possessed!

Following that, the golden light on Qin Yu’s body exploded once again! His internal qi instantly became a few times stronger!

“Oh no!” Elder Qu suddenly felt that something was wrong!

Just now, Qin Yu was able to easily crush those people. Now that his strength had soared again, how could he deal with him?

Elder Qu subconsciously took two steps back. At this moment, he was really afraid!

He gritted his teeth and said angrily, “I don’t believe that you can break my Martial Marquis Weapon!”

After saying that, Elder Qu activated it again, and the four corners immediately lit up with a bright light!

This was an extremely oppressive force, causing the entire hall to tremble slightly!

“I don’t believe that this Martial Marquis Weapon can’t kill Qin Yu!” Beads of sweat dripped down Elder Qu’s forehead.

The Martial Marquis Weapon was his final trump card. If this couldn’t kill Qin Yu, then who in the world could stop Qin Yu?

Without the Martial Marquis Weapon, Qin Yu would truly be an invincible existence!

“Go to h*ll!” Elder Qu roared, and the Martial Marquis Weapon erupted once again!

Four extremely powerful forces were approaching Qin Yu’s vital point!

“What bullsh*t Martial Marquis Weapon? So what even if it’s a real Martial Marquis?!” Qin Yu raised his head and roared angrily, and a golden power wrapped around his fist!

At a glance, his golden fist looked like the round sun!

“Watch me smash you to pieces!”

Green veins popped up all over Qin Yu’s body, and he punched forward fiercely!
