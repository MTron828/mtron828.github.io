Chapter 942: Chapter 942, Uncle Niu came with them 

“You Little Brat, you really have a lot of tricks up your sleeve.”Qin Yu could not help but mutter under his breath.

“That’s called being smart, what do you know?”The handlebar moustache rolled his eyes and said.

Hence, Qin Yu put on his hat and brought Uncle Niu into the fire country’s borders.

“Where are we going next?”The handlebar moustache asked.

Qin Yu thought about it and said: “To the Jade Moon Villa, I have a secret realm there.”

“You have a secret realm?”Uncle Niu couldn’t help but be a little surprised when he heard that.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I got it by chance.”

“When the hell did you get a secret realm?”The mustached man couldn’t help but say in surprise. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to him. He leaned against his seat and closed his eyes slightly.

The three of them soon arrived at the Green Moon Villa.

The current Green Moon Villa no longer had the prosperous scene of the past. Instead, it was in an incomparable decline.

“This... What Happened?”The mustached man looked at the scene in front of him, and a trace of shock flashed across his face.

Qin Yu said coldly, “It was done by Wan Gu Qiong.”

“How F * cking cruel.”Uncle Niu couldn’t help but Snort coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He brought the three people to the vicinity of the mystic realm.

“Go and buy some food.”Qin Yu looked at the mustached man.

The handlebar mustache muttered, “Why should I go?”

“Didn’t you want to treat Uncle Niu to a meal? Don’t talk nonsense. Hurry up and go.”Qin Yu kicked the butt of the handlebar mustache.

Although the handlebar mustache was somewhat unwilling, he still agreed.

Qin Yu slowly opened the mystic realm in front of him, cupped his hands and said, “Uncle Niu, please.”

Uncle Niu grunted and followed him into the mystic realm.

The moment they stepped into the mystic realm, a wave of Qi/spiritual energy assaulted their faces.

“What a dense amount of Qi/spiritual energy.”Uncle Niu could not help but say in surprise.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Uncle Niu, if you are willing, you can stay.”

However, Uncle Niu waved his hand and said, “Wherever Lord Xianhe is, I will be there.”

Qin Yu did not say much. After he entered the mystic realm, he realized that Jiang he was no longer in the mystic realm.

“Where is senior Jiang he?”Qin Yu could not help but frown as he looked at Li Yu.

Li Yu said, “Senior Jiang he left the secret realm some time ago.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Has he entered the Martial Saint Realm?”

“No.”Li Yu shook his head.

Qin Yu was a little puzzled. Could it be that even Jiang he needed experience to enter the martial saint realm?

“Forget it.”Qin Yu waved his hand.

He brought Uncle Niu to the private house and found a place to sit down.

“Uncle Niu, please wait for a moment. The handlebar mustache will be back soon,”Qin Yu said politely.

Uncle Niu nodded and then closed his eyes slightly.

After about an hour, the handlebar mustache returned to the secret realm.

He was carrying a large pile of food and a pot of fine wine.

“Damn it, it cost me several hundred. I have to find Qin Yu to reimburse him,”the handlebar mustache could not help but mutter.

Then, the handlebar mustache waited near the mystic realm for Qin Yu to open it.

After another ten minutes, a ray of light slowly flashed in front of him.

The handlebar mustache did not think much and strode into the mystic realm.

However, the handlebar mustache did not know that he had been targeted.

After the handlebar mustache entered the secret realm, a figure slowly walked out from the darkness.

He looked at the scene in front of him coldly, then took out his cell phone and dialed a number.

“Young Master Wan, as you expected, that kid is indeed related to Qin Yu,”he said in a deep voice.

On the other end, wan gu qiong sneered, “How is it? Have you found Qin Yu?”

“Qin Yu might be hiding in a secret realm. That secret realm is in the Green Moon Villa. Master du has also come to investigate.”

Wan Gu Qiong narrowed his eyes and sneered, “Alright, you stay there and guard. I’ll be there soon.”

After he hung up the phone, Wan Gu Qiong immediately brought the two martial saints of the Wan family and rushed to the Green Moon Villa.

...

In the secret realm.

The handlebar mustache placed the dishes in front of Uncle Niu:

A plate of pork head, a plate of vegetables, a plate of peanuts, and three stir-fried vegetables.

In addition, there was a pot of unknown white wine on the table.

“Uncle Niu, eat freely. It’s my treat!”The handlebar mustache patted his chest and said.

Uncle Niu drank a mouthful of white wine and couldn’t help but frown. “It’s so F * cking terrible. Do you usually drink this?”

“AH? This is the best wine we have here!”The Mustache Man said shamelessly.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but pull the mustache man aside and frowned. “You’re treating him to this?”

“So What? Isn’t this a delicacy? Besides, it’s already pretty good to be able to buy these in the wilderness,”the mustache man muttered.

“You’re so F * cking stingy,”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

Even though that was the case, the dishes had already been bought, so this was the only way.

After a meal, Uncle Niu patted his stomach and stood up. “Alright, thank you for your hospitality. I should go back.”

“Are you in such a hurry?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

“Uncle Niu, you can stay for a few more days. I’ll bring you to Jingdu. There are real delicacies there,”Qin Yu said.

Uncle Niu waved his hand and said, “I’ve been out for a long time. It’s time to go back.”

Seeing that Uncle Niu had made up his mind, Qin Yu couldn’t say anything else. He could only nod and say, “Alright then. If you have time, remember to come and play with me.”

“Okay.”Uncle Niu nodded slightly.

Then, Qin Yu led Uncle Niu to the exit of the secret realm.

After he opened the mystic realm, the three of them walked out of the mystic realm.

“Uncle Niu, remember to greet the immortal crane for me when you go back.”Qin Yu cupped his hands and said.

Uncle Niu grunted and said, “I got it. If you have time, you can come to our place to play.”

“Definitely!”Qin Yu nodded repeatedly.

“TSK tsk, Qin Yu, I didn’t expect you to really find a mystic realm.”

At this moment, a voice came from the dark.

Then, he saw Wan Gu Qiong strolling out.

Behind him were two martial saints.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically!

He had been discovered!

“I knew there wouldn’t be a problem with my guess.”The Mustache Man hurriedly hid behind Uncle Niu.

Qin Yu looked at Wan Gu Qiong with a cold gaze. He took a deep breath and said, “Wan Gu Qiong, to be discovered by you, you really have some skills.”

Wan Gu Qiong put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Do you think I’m the same as those idiots? I let you escape last time, let’s see where you can run to this time!”

After he finished speaking, the two martial saints waved their big hands and directly sealed this space.

“Do you want to go with me, or do you want me to Cripple You First and then bring you back?”Wan Gu Qiong said with a cold smile.

Before Qin Yu could speak, Uncle Niu frowned and asked, “Who are these people?”

The mustached man hurriedly said, “Uncle Niu, they aren’t good people. They kill demonic beasts every day as delicacies. Last time, he wanted to kill us just because we couldn’t stand to talk about him. They are simply animals!”
