Chapter 356: Yan Sihai’s Thoughts Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yan Sihai was famous in Jingdu!

When Mr. Zeng heard this name, his expression immediately changed!

“Mister... Mister Yan, why are you here...” Although Mr. Zeng had guessed it, he still had some glimmer of hope in his heart.

Yan Sihai pointed at Old Mister Yan and said coldly, “You kidnapped my father. You have quite some guts.”

Yan Sihai’s father was Old Mister Yan!

He was the infamous Emperor Yan, who was the top dog in Jingdu!

“Mister Yan, it was him... it was him who made me do it!” Mr. Zeng panicked and hurriedly pointed at Li Wenqiang’s position.

At this time, he couldn’t care less about Feng Chong anymore. Protecting his own life was the most important thing!

“As long as you lay your hands on the Yan family’s members, you will die. As for who made you do this, what does it have to do with me?” Yan Sihai sneered.

As soon as he finished speaking, Yan Sihai’s rough palm struck out!

“Kacha!”

Mr. Zeng’s head was smashed apart by a single slap!

An eighth grade Inner Strength Grandmaster had died just like that!

Qin Yu stood at the side, and he couldn’t help but feel a little terrified.

He never thought that Yan Sihai would actually have such prowress!

His strength had probably exceeded Qin Yu’s imagination!

“It’s your turn.” Yan Sihai turned around and looked at Li Wenqiang. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Li Wenqiang braced himself and said, “Don’t touch me. My uncle Is Feng Chong. He... He will definitely save me!”

“Your uncle? Who does he think he is?” Yan Sihai sneered.

After saying that, Yan Sihai waved his hand and a person who was tortured beyond recognition was thrown over.

This man was the king of the North Province Island, Feng Chong!

“Uncle... Uncle, save me!” Li Wenqiang shouted anxiously.

Feng Chong raised his head and looked at Li Wenqiang fiercely while saying, “You b*stard... You screwed me over!”

At this moment, Feng Chong couldn’t care less about whether he had a nephew or not.

He looked at Yan Sihai and said with difficulty, “President Yan, what he did... has nothing to do with me. Even if you kill him, he deserves it...”

“Feng Chong! You actually left me to die. I... I will tell my sister!” Li Wenqiang said in exasperation.

Yan Sihai couldn’t help but sneer.

“I thought it was some big shot who dared to touch my father. It turns out he’s a useless prodigal who doesn’t know anything about the world.” A trace of contempt flashed in Yan Sihai’s eyes.

Then, Yan Sihai waved his hand, and the two people next to him immediately walked toward Li Wenqiang.

“Throw him into the sea to feed the fish,” Yan Sihai said coldly.

“Yes, Mr. Yan.” The two Inner Strength Grandmasters dragged Li Wenqiang out like they were grabbing a chicken.

Yan Sihai quickly walked in front of Old Mister Yan. As he untied him, he said, “Dad, are you okay?”

Old Mister Yan stood up from the ground. He waved his hand and said, “What can happen to me?”

Qin Yu also hurriedly walked to Yan Ruoxue’s side and untied the rope on her body.

“Qin Yu, why didn’t you keep an eye on my father?” At this moment, Yan Sihai said coldly.

Qin Yu lowered his head and said somewhat apologetically, “I’m sorry, Mr. Yan. It’s my fault.”

“It has nothing to do with him. I was the one who insisted on not letting him do it.” Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said.

“Qin Yu has already done very well.” Yan Ruoxue also said with a smile.

Yan Sihai, looking extremely displeased, snorted coldly.

He wanted to flare up, but he didn’t dare to. He could only vent his anger on Feng Chong.

“Feng Chong, it seems that the security measures of the North Province Island aren’t up to standards.” Yan Sihai’s tone was cold, and there was a hidden meaning in his words.

Feng Chong wasn’t stupid. Of course, he understood what Yan Sihai meant.

Therefore, Feng Chong hurriedly said, “President Yan, I am willing to give the North Province Island to the Yan family! I only hope that the Yan family can protect the North Province Island!”

“Give it to me? Do I need it?” Yan Sihai sneered.

“Feng Chong, watch your back.”

After saying this, Yan Sihai looked at Old Mister Yan and said, “Dad, let’s go.”

Everyone left the North Province Island together.

On the way back, Yan Sihai pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Follow me.”

“Uncle, what do you want to do?” Yan Ruoxue stood in front of Qin Yu.

Yan Sihai smiled and said, “Ruoxue, what are you afraid of? As if I’ll eat him? I just want to talk to him.”

“It’s okay. Mr. Yan won’t do anything to me.” Qin Yu smiled and said.

Yan Ruoxue was still a little worried. Only when Old Mister Yan spoke did Yan Ruoxue finally relax.

The two of them boarded the helicopter and prepared to return to the Yan family manor.

The helicopter flew high in the sky. Looking down from above, one could overlook more than half of the North Province Island.

“How is the North Province Island?” Yan Sihai asked casually.

Qin Yu bowed and said, “It’s very beautiful and is developing very well.”

“Yes.” Yan Sihai nodded and said.

“Even a powerful island like the North Province Island is trifling in front of the Yan family.”

“With just a word from me, I can ban the North Province Island.”

Yan Sihai’s words were clearly a warning to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu wasn’t stupid. Of course, he understood what Yan Sihai meant.

“You’re quite lucky. You actually didn’t die last time,” Yan Sihai said indifferently.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I hope Mr. Yan can send two decent people to kill me next time. Those kinds of people aren’t a match against me.”

“Oh really? So you killed them?” Yan Sihai said with some surprise.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Yes.”

“Hahaha!” Yan Sihai couldn’t help but laugh.

“No wonder my father thinks highly of you. Tsk. In time, you might become an remarkable person,” Yan Sihai said.

Qin Yu was delighted.

Could it be that things were about to turn for the better? Did Yan Sihai agree to let Yan Ruoxue marry him?

However, Yan Sihai’s next words made Qin Yu feel as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.

“A few years ago, there was a young man with similar talent as you. Many families felt that he would become the next Ye Qing,” Yan Sihai said slowly.

“But unfortunately, he was killed by my son. Do you know why?” Yan Sihai stared at Qin Yu and said.

Qin Yu frowned and didn’t say anything.

Yan Sihai snorted. “Because he pretentiously refused the Yan family’s invitation! So I killed him!”

Qin Yu immediately felt a chill.

Yan Sihai was too overbearing!

“I want him to serve the Yan family, but he always wants to be someone who is on the same level as me. Don’t you think it’s laughable?” Yan Sihai stared at Qin Yu and asked.

“So what if he’s talented? He’s just a martial artist. To be able to serve the Yan family is already a blessing.”

“He was just like the current you. You’re just a commoner, yet you still want to be the son-in-law of the Yan family? Isn’t that laughable?”

“As for people like you, no matter how strong you are, you can only be a slave. You’ll just be a slightly higher class slave.”
