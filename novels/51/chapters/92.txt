“Bang!”

When this punch landed, Yan Jiang was actually sent flying!

His entire body crashed into the wall, and instantly, spider-like cracks appeared on the wall!

Qin Yu’s entire body was covered in blood, and his face could barely be seen.

However, his mouth still had a smile on it. At this moment, his smile was extremely terrifying!

“Hehe...” Qin Yu swayed unsteadily and was about to fall at any moment.

“You... You’re courting death!” Yan Jiang climbed up from the ground. His face was bright red. It was obvious that he had even been injured by this punch!

“Young man, as long as you fall, everything will be over. Why struggle?” Yan Yong Xiu looked at Qin Yu coldly and said.

Qin Yu struggled to support his body. He sneered and said, “Mr. Yan, if you don’t agree, then please kill me...”

To Qin Yu, life without Yan Ruoxue would be worse than death.

When Yan Yong Xiu heard this, he couldn’t help but feel startled.

He frowned slightly, then put his hands behind his back and snorted lightly.

“Bang!”

At this time, Yan Jiang had already rushed over. He punched Qin Yu and sent him flying!

Yan Jiang clearly increased the force of this punch! And Yan Jiang was also fully confident that he could knock Qin Yu out with it.

“It’s finally over,” Yan Jiang panted and said coldly.

Yan Yong Xiu waved his hand and said, “Let’s go.”

But at this moment, Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, actually let out a muffled groan.

Then, Qin Yu pressed his arm against the ground and struggled to support his body to stand up again. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Once, twice, three times...

Qin Yu tried a total of nine times, but was unable to get up! His injuries were too serious. If it were anyone else, they would have died long ago!

But even so, Qin Yu still didn’t have the intention to give up! He still wanted to try for the tenth time!

A look of astonishment flashed across Yan Yong Xiu’s face.

He stood there and pondered for a moment, then walked in front of Qin Yu.

“Your name is Qin Yu, right?” Yan Yong Xiu took a deep breath.

“I can give you a year’s time, but you have to remember that there’s only one year. If you don’t meet the requirements after one year, then even if you die, I won’t agree,” Yan Yong Xiu said coldly.

“Mr. Yan!” When the two bodyguards heard this, their expressions immediately changed!

Yan Yong Xiu... actually agreed?

Yan Yong Xiu waved his hand to indicate for the two of them not to speak.

Qin Yu, who was on the ground, finally collapsed on the ground and couldn’t stand up anymore.

He used all his strength and muttered in a low voice, “Mr. Yan... Thank you...”

Yan Yong Xiu didn’t say anything else and turned around to leave the hotel.

...

At this time, Yan Ruoxue had already woken up from her sleep.

Because she felt uneasy.

When she saw that Yan Yong Xiu wasn’t in the hotel, the uneasy feeling intensified.

Soon, Yan Yong Xiu returned to the hotel.

“Where did you go?” Before the lights were turned on, Yan Ruoxue’s airy voice was heard.

Yan Yong Xiu’s body trembled. He said somewhat awkwardly, “Ruoxue, you... you haven’t slept yet?”

“Have you gone to look for Qin Yu?” Yan Ruoxue’s voice instantly increased by a few notches.

Yan Yong Xiu couldn’t help but force a smile.

Facing his own daughter, he was completely helpless.

“Ruoxue, I promise you that nothing has happened to Qin Yu!” Yan Yong Xiu was like a child as he raised his finger and swore.

Yan Ruoxue stared at Yan Yong Xiu, as if she wanted to determine if he was lying.

After a while, Yan Ruoxue said coldly, “Dad, I never joke. As long as I say something, I will do it.”

Yan Yong Xiu wiped the sweat on his forehead and said with a sheepish smile, “Yes, yes, Ruoxue, go to bed. It’s late...”

Yan Yong Xiu heaved a sigh of relief after Yan Ruoxue returned to her room.

“Phew, I really don’t know how Qin Yu won over Ruoxue...” Yan Yong Xiu couldn’t help but mutter.

“Mr. Yan, do you really intend to let Miss Yan marry Qin Yu?” Yan Jiang couldn’t help but frown.

Yan Yong Xiu said with a nonchalant smile, “When did I agree? I only said that I would give him a year’s time. It’s just a year. I can afford to wait.”

“But...” Yan Jiang frowned. “What if after a year, he really accomplished something?”

Yan Yong Xiu glanced at Yan Jiang and said, “If Qin Yu really goes to Jingdu, he would know what he faces. Those young masters in Jingdu definitely won’t let him off easily.”

At this point, Yan Yong Xiu paused for a moment and continued, “Of course, if Qin Yu really does surpass those young masters, then Ruoxue won’t be at a loss by marrying him.”

When Yan Jiang heard that, he couldn’t help but force a smile and said, “It’s easier said than done... . . Qin Yu started from nothing and wants to rival the young masters of the various aristocratic families in Jingdu? That’s simply impossible.”

Yan Yong Xiu shook his head and said, “That might not necessarily be the case. It’s not like there aren’t people who can hold their own against the various aristocratic families all by themselves.”

“Like Ye Qing, like Jiang He.”

Upon hearing those words, Yan Jiang muttered softly, “Ye Qing is now a highly important figure at the top of the military regions, and Jiang He is o known as the guardian of Pyro. If you are comparing Qin Yu to them, aren’t you thinking too highly of him... . .”

Yan Yong Xiu didn’t answer that question.

Others might not know, but Yan Yong Xiu knew very clearly.

If Qin Yu was really the son of that person, then no one knew what level Qin Yu would reach in the future.

One must know... . . that figure was someone that all the great aristocratic families had to defer to!
