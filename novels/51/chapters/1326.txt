Chapter 1327: Chapter 1327, do you know Ling Yun 

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I’ve got it.”

“Where is it? Take it out and take a look!”Ah San said anxiously.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Let’s leave this place first. I have a bad feeling about this.”

Although this feeling wasn’t strong, Qin Yu was extremely sensitive to danger.

Wan ‘er also nodded and said, “Yes, Young Master Qin is right. This place is filled with danger. It’s better to leave quickly.”

Thus, the group of three got up and prepared to leave this mountain range.

The surrounding fog became increasingly dense. That heavy feeling also made people’s chests feel extremely uncomfortable.

Fortunately, there was no danger along the way. The three of them walked out of the fog safely.

The moment they walked out, a dense group of figures appeared in the fog.

Their bodies were emitting a jade-green light as they looked coldly at Qin Yu and the others.

...

“Phew, we finally left that damned place.”Ah San panted as he tried his best to feel the spirit energy in his body.

After the spirit energy recovered, ah San’s injuries also gradually began to recover.

Qin Yu and Wan ‘er were even more excited. This vital energy was extremely important to the two of them. They had been impatient for a long time.

Then, the three of them walked down the mountain and returned to Yang City.

The Chen family.

Chen Cang’s face was gloomy.

He raised his head from time to time and looked up. There seemed to be some worry in his heart.

At this moment, Qin Yu, Wan ‘er, and the others pushed open the door and entered.

Looking at the three people who had returned, Chen Cang hurriedly stood up.

He sized up the wound on Qin Yu’s body and frowned. “Did you see that thing?”

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “Yes, I saw it.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Not only did I see it, Young Master Qin also beheaded a lot of people,”wan ‘er said softly from the side.

Chen Cang’s eyes were immediately filled with shock, as if he did not dare to believe Wan ‘ER’s words.

Qin Yu didn’t want to explain too much. He smiled and said, “Old Mister Chen, thank you very much.”

Wan ‘er and AH San took off their armor and returned it to Chen Cang.

“Old Mister Chen, I’m really sorry for damaging your armor.”Wan ‘er bowed and said.

After saying that, she took out a card and handed it to Chen Cang.

“There is some money in here. Take it as compensation for you,”Wan ‘er said.

Chen Cang waved his hand and said, “As long as you can come back, it’s good. One or two pieces of armor is nothing.”

Qin Yu could also see that Chen Cang was a good person.

He even treated strangers like this, let alone people who were close to him.

Then, they exchanged a few pleasantries with Chen Cang and returned to the room.

Wan ‘er and Ah San couldn’t wait any longer. They looked at Qin Yu eagerly, waiting for the life Qi in Qin Yu’s hand.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He took it out from the spatial magic artifact.

“The life qi is in here?”Wan ‘er asked in surprise.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Look for a container. I’ll give you half.”

Wan ‘er immediately bowed and said, “Thank you, Young Master Qin.”

She had already made preparations and immediately took out the container.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any more words. He opened the container in his hand and wisps of jade-green life Qi slowly flowed out.

Qin Yu gave half of the life Qi in his hand to Wan ‘Er. To Wan ‘er, this was a great favor.

“Young Master Qin, I will never forget your great kindness,”Wan ‘er said with some excitement.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “There’s no need to say such words. Hurry up and heal your body.”

Wan ‘ER’s symptoms were much more serious than Qin Yu’s. However, the life force she needed was not as huge as Qin Yu’s.

After receiving the life force, wan ‘er did not leave Qin Yu’s room. Instead, she immediately sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the life force.

Qin Yu looked at Wan ‘er with some curiosity. He also wanted to know what level Wan ‘Er was at to be praised by Ah San so much.

Wan ‘er held the life Qi in her hand and muttered softly, “After enduring for so long, I can finally recover my spiritual power...”

She did not say anything more and began to absorb the life qi.

This was not a very long process, so Qin Yu simply stood at the side, intending to witness this scene with his own eyes.

Wan ‘er was the first person Qin Yu had met who had absorbed the Twilight Qi, so Qin Yu was also filled with curiosity.

As traces of life Qi entered, Wan ‘ER’s originally pale face began to slowly become rosy.

There were traces of spiritual Qi circulating in her body.

Qin Yu stood at the side, watching with his blood boiling, incomparably excited.

“This life qi is really useful!”Qin Yu clenched his fists.

However, he couldn’t figure out why his spiritual power hadn’t recovered even though he had also absorbed the life Qi!

“Great, Great!”Ah San was even more excited and shouted.

The spiritual power was slowly recovering in Wan ‘Er’s internal Qi, and a powerful aura surged out of her body.

Qin Yu could even feel the powerful pressure from her body!

This pressure wasn’t any weaker than Ling Yun’s!

This wan ‘er... is really not weak, Qin Yu thought to himself.

A few minutes later, wan ‘er slowly opened her eyes.

The person in front of her clearly hadn’t changed much, but it felt like she was a different person.

“This internal Qi... is really not weak,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Although Qin Yu couldn’t sense her realm, the pressure was clearly visible.

“Miss Wan ‘er, how do you feel now?”Ah San asked hurriedly.

Wan ‘er nodded slightly and said with a smile, “My body has recovered.”

“Completely recovered?”Qin Yu also asked.

Wan ‘er repeatedly nodded and said, “That’s right, Young Master Qin. Thank you for your help. I will always remember this favor.”

However, Qin Yu frowned tightly.

He couldn’t figure out why he couldn’t be like Wan ‘er and quickly recover his strength?

“Young Master Qin?”Wan ‘er seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s strange behavior.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “It’s fine. Miss Wan ‘Er’s strength is really not ordinary. You should be at the mighty realm, right?”

“Miss Wan ‘er is in the mid-stage of the Mighty Realm!”Ah San said proudly.

Qin Yu was even more surprised.

This Wan ‘er was not old, but she had already stepped into the mid-stage of the mighty realm?

One had to know that the current Qin Yu only had a nascent soul.

“AH SAN!”Wan ‘er was slightly displeased and scolded.

“Miss Wan ‘er, when we go back, we will definitely teach those who bullied you a lesson!”Ah San said excitedly.

Although Wan ‘Er didn’t say much, she was obviously looking forward to it.

“Miss Wan ‘er, do you know Ling Yun?”Qin Yu suddenly asked.
