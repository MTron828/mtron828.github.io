Chapter 955: Chapter 955, Tian Xuehong’s methods!

“The masked woman is still alive, and I’ve seen her before,”Qin Yu whispered mysteriously into his ear.

Hearing this, Tian Xuehong immediately took a few steps back, his face filled with fear!

Even his body was trembling!

“What’s Wrong?”Gu Xinghe hurriedly walked forward and asked.

Tian Xuehong didn’t say anything, but the sweat on his forehead kept flowing down.

“You... you’re talking nonsense!”Tian Xuehong’s voice was trembling!

Qin Yu laughed, “What I said is true! Why would I lie to You?”

“Nonsense! She has been dead for more than 10,000 years!”Tian Xuehong roared angrily.

Qin Yu sneered, “Don’t you know that she has resurrected again? and more than once.”

How could Tian Xuehong not know! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Of course, he knew the masked woman’s methods!

However, most of the masked woman’s resurrections failed and didn’t cause any trouble.

The number of complete resurrections was very few!

“You want to scare me, right? Do you think I’ll believe you?”Tian Xuehong said coldly.

Qin Yu spread his hands and said, “It’s up to you. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.”

“I told you, this guy is sinister and cunning. Stay away from him!”Gu Xinghe shouted.

Tian Xuehong didn’t say anything for a long time.

He waved his hand and walked to the side as if he was trying to calm himself down.

After an unknown amount of time, Tian Xuehong finally calmed down slightly.

He walked back and sneered, “Qin Yu, I, Tian Xuehong, am not scared to death. I Won’t believe a word you say.”

“I said, whether you believe it or not is your own business,”Qin Yu sneered.

The Sky Blood Rainbow narrowed his eyes and said, “I heard that you are a chaotic body. Your spiritual sense must be very powerful, right? I will feel it properly later.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s expression changed immediately!

Could it be as he had guessed?

“You can start now.”The Sky Blood Rainbow looked at Gu Xinghe.

Gu Xinghe acknowledged him and retreated to the side.

Then, Tian xuehong walked to the center of the prison.

He swept his gaze across the prisoners and said coldly, “It’s your honor to serve me. Remember This!”

The prisoners were dumbfounded. They did not understand Tian Xuehong’s words at all.

Qin Yu had a bad feeling! He hurriedly shouted, “Tian Xuehong, what are you trying to do? !”

Tian Xuehong ignored Qin Yu’s words, but his body emitted waves of strange internal Qi.

These internal Qi were black in color, and in the end, they transformed into the appearance of an evil ghost in the air!

The evil ghost had a large bloody mouth, and it charged towards a nearby criminal!

At the instant of the collision, the large hand of the evil ghost slapped the criminal’s head. Then, the criminal’s spiritual sense was forcefully pulled out by the evil ghost, and it was directly swallowed into the large bloody mouth!

His spiritual sense was absorbed just like that! The internal Qi in his body was also rapidly dissipating!

Upon seeing this scene, the expressions of all the criminals changed drastically!

“Comfortable, it’s really comfortable,”said Tian Xuehong with narrowed eyes.

His hands shook, and several more evil spirits flew out!

These evil spirits charged towards the criminals and began to devour their spiritual sense!

The prisoners immediately panicked! They tried to resist, but found that they couldn’t hurt this evil spirit at all!

For a moment, the entire prison was wailing incessantly, and the screams were incessant!

Every prisoner’s face was covered with terror!

“Hahahaha, hahahahaha!”Tian Xuehong kept laughing loudly.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely unsightly. He grabbed the railing and roared angrily, “Tian Xuehong, F * cking stop right now!”

Tian xuehong sneered, “Stop? Don’t worry, it’ll be your turn soon!”

Looking at the prisoners around him who were wailing incessantly, Qin Yu’s heart felt as if it was being cut by a knife!

He glared angrily at Gu Xinghe and couldn’t help but curse, “Gu Xinghe, as a member of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, you actually did such a vicious thing!”

However, gu xinghe snorted lightly, “They’re just a bunch of ants. Do you think I Care?”

One by one, the prisoners fell. Their faces were filled with fear. Before they died, their faces were even more twisted.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu was extremely furious!

However, his body was too weak. He had no strength to stop them!

“Damn it!”Qin Yu slammed his palm on the railing!

“Tian Xuehong, stop right now. I can give you a treasure!”Qin Yu hurriedly shouted.

Sky Blood Rainbow Glanced at Qin Yu and sneered, “I won’t believe anything you say.”

“You!”Qin Yu was instantly angry, but there was nothing he could do!

The surrounding prisoners fell one after another, and Qin Yu was in a mental breakdown!

“Damn it!”

At this moment, Qin Yu thought of the divine sense in the interspatial divine artifact!

“I’m going to fight you to the death!”Qin Yu roared. Then, he sent his divine sense into the spatial artifact and found the trace of light.

“I agree to your request. Come out immediately and accept my body!”Qin Yu shouted anxiously.

A voice slowly came from the depths of the abyss.

“You finally agreed, but in my current condition, I’m still unable to leave this place,”the other party said indifferently.

Qin Yu’s pupils constricted, and he anxiously asked, “Why?”

“I’m too weak. I still need a large amount of spirit stones.”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly became extremely unsightly!

How could he still have the time to deal with this F * cking urgent matter?

“F * ck, it’s nothing!”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse and hurriedly left this place.

In this short period of time, nearly half of the prisoners had died.

“Tian Xuehong, stop the F * ck Now!”Qin Yu shouted angrily.

Qin Yu had a good relationship with these prisoners. Seeing them die in front of him, Qin Yu couldn’t bear it at all!

Tian Xuehong glanced at Qin Yu and sneered, “Looks like you’re in a hurry.”

Gu Xinghe said, “Hurry up and kill him so that he doesn’t talk nonsense here!”

The sky blood rainbow nodded slightly, “Alright, since you’re in such a hurry, I’ll send you on your way in advance!”

With that, an evil spirit pounced towards Qin Yu!
