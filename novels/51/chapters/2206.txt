2207 Crisis Arrives

“However, if you try to pry into destiny with your Destiny Divination, you will suffer the backlash from the way. This divination of yours will at least cause your future to be more bumpy.”

Qin Yu said with a bitter smile. He did not expect Wang Feng to be able to comprehend the eight trigrams of destiny from the formation. This almost involved the power above the Saint Realm. Wang Feng’s attainments in formations were indeed tremendously terrifying.

In the Holy Region, this was called Master of Path of Heaven. Back in the Chaotic Mystic Realm, there were two Masters of Path of Heaven who had been deducing the correct path.

“Haha, Big Brother, don’t panic. Provided I can study the formation, I’ll be satisfied even if I die tomorrow. Moreover, if it weren’t for my tough body because of you, how would I give you this divination?

Wang Feng laughed heartily. He did not care at all.

With a flick of his divine sense, Qin Yu transmitted all the information about the formation that his father had left him into Wang Feng’s mind.

He then took out a bottle with hundreds of pills in it.

“With your talent, these pills are enough to help you reach the Reversion Void Stage. As for how far you can go subsequently, it depends on yourself.”

“Mr. Qin…”

Wang Feng felt the various ancient formation transmitted by Qin Yu’s divine sense. For a moment, he did not know how to express the emotions in his heart.

This information could not even be bought at a sky-high price.

It was the foundation of an aristocratic family, and now, this person in front of him was giving him this information.

“Cultivate well.”

Qin Yu smiled and shook his head. For a moment, he saw his shadow in Wang Feng.

Moreover, the road of cultivation was long, and he could not multitask. Giving this information to the person in front of him was indeed making the best use of it. Moreover, the divination he had done for him with his life was indeed a great kindness!

It seemed that all of this was related to karma. If Qin Yu had not saved Wang Feng, there would not have been this divination.

“Certainly. Mr. Qin, it’s time for you to leave. Remember, the gate of life for this divination lies in the scene you saw at the end.”

Wang Feng urged.

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

The danger this time was probably not simple. Perhaps only the Peak of True Saint could make him feel such a suffocating sharpness.

Qin Yu activated the line word formula, and his body turned into a stream of light as rushing toward the Yun family’s warship.

Suddenly, in the Black Platform Continent, an aura of spiritual energy permeated the surroundings. Within ten thousand feet, the spiritual energy formed a translucent phantom that opened its eyes wide, resembling an oceanic expanse.

“Haha, you actually attempted to pry into the secrets of the heavens.”

The voice sounded a little lazy as if he had just woken up.

Following that, a bolt of lightning flashed in the sky. Before the lightning extinguished, the divine sense had already rushed toward Qin Yu with a terrifying energy that could annihilate heaven and earth.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body was enveloped in a ten-thousand-year-old ice cave. A layer of ice that was as hard as ten-thousand-year-old dark iron instantly froze him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Yu’s expression changed. At this moment, the sun shone brightly, and in an instant, this place was covered in ice and snow.

“Shatter!”

With a palm strike, the ice shattered into countless pieces.

With the reminder of the nine trigrams of destiny, his body glowed with golden light, and the Saintly Body Technique instantly circulated to the limit.

The ice fragments in the air slowly spun. In the next moment, they turned into chilling and menacing flying daggers.

Each flying dagger carried a terrifying force as it attacked Qin Yu from all directions.

“Great!”

Qin Yu crossed his arms and shook his body violently, shattering the countless flying daggers into countless pieces.

“An Early-stage True Saint already has such strength. No wonder the people from the Holy Region resorted to seeking my assistance with magical artifacts using personal connections.”

A black pupil appeared in front of Qin Yu and said with interest.

“It’s those trash from the Holy Region again!”

Qin Yu laughed coldly.

“I don’t know if they’re trash, but I know you’re going to die here today.”

A lazy voice came from the black pupil.

“A scoundrel who doesn’t even dare to show his true body. Show me if you have any methods. I, Qin Yu, will take them all!”

Qin Yu shouted. After breaking through to the True Saint Realm, he wanted to engage in a fierce battle and enjoy it to the fullest.

“Oh, try this move then.”

The voice sounded somewhat playful, like a cat playing with a mouse.

The flying dagger fragments trembled violently, suddenly melted, and turned into countless water droplets.

The water droplets fell to the ground, and there were the sounds of rain, water, and waves. The sky started a downpour.

Terrifying rainwater poured down like an inverted reservoir. The immense tsunami directly turned into a water dragon and rushed toward Qin Yu.

Countless ordinary people and even cultivators below the mighty realm were crushed by the terrifying power of heaven and earth.

They fought within a range of a hundred thousand feet and instantly killed everyone.

Hearing the pleas of the commoners and the cries of the children, Qin Yu shouted coldly.

“Aren’t you afraid the tribulation inner demons will turn you into ashes for committing such bloodshed?”

“They’re just a bunch of ants.”

A lazy voice sounded.

“Even ants can make waves in the sea!”

Qin Yu was tremendously furious.

“Star Seal!”

The Star Seal, powered by the True Saint, turned into a massive star and smashed toward the tsunami.

The enormous tsunami was split into two, and its power was greatly reduced. The terrifying aftershock slapped Qin Yu.

“Venerable Fifth Mountain!”

“Bang!”

Qin Yu felt a sweetness in his mouth. A mouthful of blood came into his mouth, and he instantly swallowed it.

“Star Seal? I can sense some smell of the way. It’s a cultivation technique left behind by a Guardian, right?”

The black pupil asked in confusion.

“Die!”

Qin Yu activated the fighting word formula and punched the eyeball.

“I won’t die until the Path of Heaven dies. Interesting. A Peak True Saint’s attack can only injure you. It seems you have quite a number of treasures.”

In front of Qin Yu, the black pupil formed again.

One after another, tall mountains rose from the ground, and countless sprouts surged out of the water, turning into giant trees in the blink of an eye.

The giant mountain continued rising, and in the end, it actually passed through the clouds.

“You’ve seen a tsunami. Let’s try a landslide.”

The black pupil spoke again and yawned.

Countless giant mountains collapsed along with the sound, and massive rocks collapsed from the sky.

It was the power of a landslide!

It was dozens of times more terrifying than the tsunami just now.

Qin Yu gasped. It was the power of the way of the Tribulation Stage!

The laws of heaven and earth were changed at will!

“Come on. I’ll let you see the strength of an ant!”

Qin Yu laughed wildly.

He clenched his fist and slowly extended it forward as if holding a sharp sword.

It was slow but unstoppable.

When the mountain-sized object landed before him, it was struck by an inexplicable force and suddenly turned into dust.

The entire space was covered in sand rain, covering the sky.

A gray light spread out from Qin Yu’s fist, forming a space of several hundred feet.

Each mountain contained the purest power of heaven and earth.

The force of each rock falling was like a Peak True Saint cultivator hitting Qin Yu.

And the massive rock, when approaching Qin Yu, turned into dust.

“Traceless Annihilation!”

Qin Yu said expressionlessly.
