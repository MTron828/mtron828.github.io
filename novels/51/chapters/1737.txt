Chapter 1738: Purple Cloud Pearl and Jue Wu Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yong Ji, Sima Bei, and He Teng looked at the Divine Capital City in front of them with complicated expressions.

While they were excited to find Xiao Sheng, they were also feeling a slight headache over the Divine Inscription Formation.

“Don’t waste any more time. Whether we succeed or not, we have to try.” Sima Bei was the first to speak.

With that, he reached out his palm and held a ray of light. Then, he approached Divine Capital City!

Countless rays of light pounced toward Divine Capital City. Just as they were about to make contact, the Divine Inscription Formation automatically came to life. The dense divine inscriptions shattered these countless rays of light!

!!

Seeing this, Sima Bei could not help but frown.

“This formation truly lives up to its name.” Sima Bei said coldly.

“Qin Yu was hiding here to avoid Tianyun Sect’s pursuit,” Yong Ji scoffed coldly.

With that, he also raised his palm and struck at the Divine Capital City.

Unfortunately, the result was the same as Sima Bei’s. There was no way to break the Divine Inscription Formation.

After which, the three of them attacked together. They spared no effort in trying to break this Divine Inscription Formation. However, the results were far from satisfactory.

The Divine Inscription Formation was so powerful that even the three of them couldn’t shake it at all!

Within the city, Xiao Sheng had naturally sensed the terrifying sound. He quickly noticed the three people outside.

As such, Xiao Sheng could not help but raise his head to look at the Divine Inscription Formation that was densely covering the sky.

Even though he trusted Qin Yu, he was still worried about the Divine Inscription Formation.

After making sure that the Divine Inscription Formation wouldn’t be broken by the three of them, he closed his eyes.

Outside, the three of them looked a little disheveled.

They had used all of their techniques, but they were still unable to do anything to the Divine Inscription Formation.

“Try using your White Bone Club.” At this moment, Yong Ji looked at He Teng.

He Teng’s brows furrowed slightly. Although he was somewhat unwilling, he still took out the White Bone Club in the end.

The White Bone Club was the only confirmed Saint Weapon in the entire Nanzhou. even though it had not been resurrected, it was still the number one divine weapon in Nanzhou.

Holding the White Bone Club in his hand, He Teng’s aura instantly became extremely powerful.

He grabbed the White Bone Club with both hands and with a loud roar, he smashed the White Bone Club towards the Divine Capital City!

“Boom!”

A terrifying sound rang out as a Divine Inscription Formation instantly appeared, blocking the incoming attack! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The entire city was rumbling, but what was terrifying was that the Divine Inscription Formation was still intact and unaffected!

“Even the White Bone Club is useless?” Yong Ji couldn’t help but frown.

“You have not reached the Reversion Void Stage yet,” Sima Bei said coldly. “The power you can use is limited. Give me the White Bone Club.”

“Do you think that’s possible?” He Teng sneered.

“What? ” Sima Bei’s face turned cold. “Do you think I’ll take your White Bone Club for myself? ”

“It’s hard to say,” He Teng snorted.

“If I wanted this item, I could have just snatched it directly. Why would I need to discuss it with you?” Sima Bei said with a cold face.

“I’m afraid you don’t have the ability,” He Teng said sarcastically.

Sima Bei’s face turned cold as he rebuked, “He Teng, if you let Xiao Sheng escape, you won’t be able to bear the responsibility!”

“Why should I take responsibility? Sima Bei, no matter what you say, I will never give you this White Bone Club. Just give up.” He Teng said coldly.

Sima Bei could not help but clench his fists.

He looked at He Teng coldly. Although he was furious, he suppressed it in the end.

“We’ll think of another way.” Yong Ji tried to smooth things over.

The three of them stayed near the Divine Capital City for the time being and slowly discussed countermeasures.

On the other side, Qin Yu had arrived at Dayue Mountain.

This time, Wen Wanchong and the two Wen brothers surprisingly didn’t get drunk.

They were sitting cross-legged on the peak of Dayue Mountain, and Wen Wanchong seemed to be giving them a lecture.

“In such a Golden Age, no one can protect you. Besides, I can’t guarantee how long I can live.” Wen Wanchong said coldly.

“So you must have the ability to protect yourself.”

“Don’t we still have Qin Yu? ” Wen Da said reluctantly. “I believe he can protect us when the time comes.”

“Can you guarantee that Qin Yu will live to the end? In such a Golden Age, no matter how talented you are, you might die young!” Wen Wanchong scolded.

Although Wen Da and Wen Er were unwilling, they could only sit there and listen to Wen Wanchong’s lecture under Wen Wanchong’s coercion.

Just then, Qin Yu walked over from not far away.

When they saw Qin Yu, the two brothers ran over excitedly as if they had found a life-saving straw.

“Qin Yu, you’ve come at the right time. Quick, take us out of here.” Wen Da said anxiously.

Qin Yu glanced at Wen Da and said, “I have something to discuss with master.”

“That’s even better. You guys can discuss it. We’ll be leaving first.” the two brothers said excitedly.

After saying this, the two of them turned around and ran.

Looking at the two running down the mountain, Wen Wanchong could not help but sigh.

“I really can’t do anything to these two little bastards.” Wen Wanchong sighed.

Of course, Qin Yu knew Wen Wanchong’s intention. He said in a deep voice, “Master, don’t worry. I will do my best to ensure their safety.”

Wen Wanchong glanced at Qin Yu and said, “It’s good enough that you can guarantee your own safety.”

Qin Yu was speechless. he could not help but sigh in his heart.

“Tell me, what’s the matter?” Wen Wanchong changed the topic.

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and immediately told Wen Wanchong his intention.

Wen Wanchong agreed without hesitation. He sighed and said, “Even if you don’t say it, I will definitely do it, but… I’m afraid that we won’t be able to resist the North Plain with our own strength.”

At this point, Wen Wanchong couldn’t help but sigh, “If only Jue Wu was still alive…”

“Jue Wu isn’t dead yet. There’s still hope to break her curse.” Qin Yu forced a smile.

Then, Qin Yu took out Jue Wu from the Spatial Magic Artifact.

Jue Wu lay quietly in front of the two, looking extremely beautiful.

Compared to the usual Jue Wu, the Jue Wu at this moment was a bit more gentle and quiet, and had a different flavor.

“Sigh, if Jue Wu was fine, I think she would have reached the Reversion Void Stage by now. With her help, I’m more confident. With just a few of us, I’m afraid we won’t be able to return.” Wen Wanchong let out a long sigh.

“Don’t be so pessimistic, master. I have a plan,” said Qin Yu quickly.

“You have a way? What’s your plan?” Wen Wanchong rolled his eyes at him.

Qin Yu immediately took out the purple cloud pearl. The purple cloud pearl was shining with a coquettish light, and it was obvious that it was not an ordinary item.

“I’m afraid this item is even more terrifying than a Saint Weapon.” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Even more terrifying than a Saint Weapon? Are you joking?” Wen Wanchong laughed.

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to demonstrate it once. At this time, the purple cloud pearl floated up from Qin Yu’s palm on its own!

Qin Yu was stunned. Just as he was about to reach out to grab the purple cloud pearl, Jue Wu’s body also began to flash!
