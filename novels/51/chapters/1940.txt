1941 The Temple Fair in Sky City

After getting the confirmation, Qin Yu was even more rest assured the f*cking cultivator just now was not his imagination. He did exist.

The method he had used to hide from the eyes of others remained unknown, but it was sure that his power was beyond imagination.

“What is going on?” Qin Yu frowned.

He suddenly remembered the strange feeling he had after he went to Donghuang. It was as if someone was watching him in the dark.

Qin Yu was still under the curse, but he just didn’t know if the pair of eyes in the dark had anything to do with the curse.

“When does the temple fair start?” Qin Yu asked the cultivator beside him.

“Three days later,” the cultivator said in an unpleasant tone.

He didn’t seem to want to deal with Qin Yu much, so he got up and left.

Qin Yu closed her eyes slightly and tried to use his subtle divine sense to feel the surrounding gazes.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu failed as too many people were watching him now. Countless pairs of eyes were watching him in the dark. No one knew if they were the ones who wanted to stand up for the Si family or if they were tremendously mysterious existences.

“To attend the temple fair…” Qin Yu thought to himself. Then he got up and found a place to stay for the time being.

In Sky City, Great Xia Royal Family was still the most sublime.

Although they had lost their actual strength, they were still the faith of many people. Some even tried to restore Great Xia, but the current king of Great Xia had long lost that ambition.

Qin Yu knew nothing about the Great Xia Royal Family, nor did he know the glorious history they once had.

However, since Great Xia could rule the entire Holy Region, it was needless to say much about their abilities.

In the following few days, Qin Yu pondered the words of that f*cking cultivator repeatedly.

Ever since he talked to the cultivator, Qin Yu felt like he had been enlightened on something.

Especially the lines “I like all the women in the world, yet I don’t like any of them.”

This sentence seemed very simple and not profound, but such simple and contradictory words usually contained even more dao techniques.

On the other end, Si Shiyue and Si Shifeng had already arrived at Sky City.

“Sky City is still as prosperous as ever,” the elderly man beside them sighed.

“The nine great aristocratic families called them the royal family out of respect. Otherwise, they would have been wiped out long ago,” Si Shifeng laughed and said.

“You can’t say that.” The elderly man shook his head. “Although the Great Xia Royal Family has fallen, they’re not so bad.”

Si Shiyue nodded, sneered, and said, “If it weren’t for the fact that they were afraid of the hidden trump cards of the Great Xia Royal Family, the eight great aristocratic families wouldn’t have kept them alive until now. It’s better to keep them like pets and use them for our own purposes.”

“What Brother Yue said makes sense,” Si Shifeng hurriedly bowed and said.

Si Shiyue’s appearance soon attracted the attention of countless people, and it didn’t take long for the news to spread.

“Si Shiyue has also come to Sky City! I don’t know if he’s here for the temple fair or Qin Yu!”

“It could be for both! However, most likely they won’t start a conflict in Sky City.”

“Tsk! Tsk! I’m looking forward to seeing them meet.”

Besides Si Shiyue, many famous people arrived in Sky City in the following days.

For example the heirs of other aristocratic families and many experts of the older generation.

Of course, they weren’t as high-profile as Si Shiyue, so they didn’t cause too much of a stir.

In the inn, Qin Yu stood by the window, looking at the bustling Sky City.

There was only one day left before the temple fair. Qin Yu squinted his eyes, feeling he was already on the verge of a breakthrough, but he seemed to have missed something.

It was like there was a layer of window paper, and he couldn’t break through if he couldn’t pierce through it.

Qin Yu thought hard but still couldn’t step out.

He let out a long sigh and said in a low voice, “The f*cking cultivator yesterday said that cultivation is not about the length of time, but enlightenment.”

As long as one could successfully comprehend the dao, coupled with sufficient resources, cultivation would no longer be so difficult.

Qin Yu pushed the door open and walked out of the inn.

He walked on the streets of Sky City, and everyone seemed like looking at him.

Qin Yu frowned. This feeling made him extremely uncomfortable.

“Kid, you still dare to appear on the streets?” Just as Qin Yu was feeling puzzled, someone suddenly walked out and blocked his way.

He was a burly man, and four or five people were behind him. Each of them was quite intrepid.

“Why? Why wouldn’t I dare?” Qin Yu asked.

“Haha, you still don’t know yet, do you? The Holy Son of the Si family has already arrived at Sky City. You can’t be arrogant for long!” the cultivators behind the man shouted.

This somewhat surprised Qin Yu. He touched his chin and muttered, “Si Shiyue has actually come!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Speaking of which, Qin Yu had never faced Si Shiyue before.

In any case, this was Sky City. Thus Si Shiyue would not make a move. Qin Yu could take this opportunity to see Si Shiyue’s attitude.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu grinned, and his eyes filled with anticipation.

Seeing this, the burly man immediately frowned.

“Kid, the Si family’s Holy Son is here. How can you still laugh?” the cultivator shouted.

“Why can’t I?” Qin Yu laughed and said. “Get lost, don’t be a hindrance here.”

“Great! You have guts! I’d like to see if you can still be so unyielding when you see the Si family’s Holy Son!” the cultivator shouted.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to respond to him and strode forward.

...

Time flew. A day passed in the blink of an eye.

In the past few days, the internal qi of Sky City had changed greatly. If one looked closely, one could even see the changes in the dao technique.

This indicated many top-notch masters of great accomplishment had come to Sky City. Their arrival changed the atmosphere of the entire city.

Soon, it was the day of the temple fair.

That night, many people gathered in the temple.

The entire temple was bustling and lively. All kinds of lanterns were displayed on the streets. In the middle, people were playing with Demonic Beast causing a burst of cheers.

Walking in the temple, Qin Yu quietly released his divine sense and covered most of the temple fair.

Soon, Qin Yu sensed several extremely powerful internal qi at the temple fair. It was vague and faintly discernible, but extremely powerful.

“I’m afraid many experts were hiding in this temple fair,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“My friend, we meet again.”

A familiar voice rang in Qin Yu’s ears.

...

When he turned around, he saw that the person was none other than a member of the Si family. The one who spoke was Si Shifeng.
