Hearing Liu Shihui agree, Qin Yu smirked.

“Young Master Liu, you won’t go back on your words in front of so many people, right?” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Liu Shihui sneered and said, “I, Liu Shihui, am a man of my word! But you... you don’t actually think you can win, do you?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He stood there and beckoned Liu Shihui.

Liu Shihui’s expression turned cold as he said coldly, “I’ll teach you a good lesson right now, you insolent b*stard!”

With that said, Liu Shihui clenched his fist and instantly appeared in front of Qin Yu!

“How fast!” The surrounding people couldn’t help but exclaim!

“As expected of Young Master Liu. I didn’t even see this punch clearly!”

“He’s too fast. He’s really too fast!”

Sun Ying, Yao Qing, and the others’ expressions also changed. This was because the strength that Liu Shihui displayed was beyond their understanding!

Everyone was shocked, but only Qin Yu’s expression was calm.

He didn’t dodge. He clenched his fist and faced it head-on!

“You dare to exchange punches with me? You’re courting death!” An unhinged look flashed in Liu Shihui’s eyes!

He roared again and again, and their two fists collided with each other!

Updates by

In an instant, a huge force rippled between the two fists!

With a loud bang, Liu Shihui actually took three steps back!

On the other hand, Qin Yu stood where he was without moving at all!

“Just as I guessed.” Qin Yu thought inside.

The so-called Inner Strength Master Hand wasn’t worth mentioning at all!

“How is that possible?!” Liu Shihui’s expression was a bit ugly. Although he didn’t use his full strength in this punch, it was impossible for it to be repelled by someone at his level!

The venue was even more silent. No one dared to believe this scene.

“Young Master Liu is actually... at a disadvantage?”

“That guy called Qin Yu... is quite capable.”

The crowd discussed animatedly. This undoubtedly made Liu Shihui furious!

“Looks like I underestimated you.” Liu Shihui looked at Qin Yu coldly and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He only looked at Liu Shihui with amusement.

Liu Shihui shouted angrily, “It’s a pity that I only used 50% of my strength just now! And now... I want to kill you quickly!”

After saying that, Liu Shihui charged towards Qin Yu once again.

His speed was practically unrivaled. His punches were unbelievably quick and powerful!

Meanwhile, Qin Yu had his hands behind his back. His agile figure easily dodged every punch from Liu Shihui!

After more than ten punches, Liu Shihui still couldn’t touch Qin Yu!

“How is this possible?!” Liu Shihui couldn’t help but feel a little anxious inside.

He clearly saw with his own eyes that Qin Yu was easily beaten up by the old servant. How could he improve so much in just three days?!

“That’s all you’ve got?” Qin Yu sneered.

Liu Shihui panted heavily. He gritted his teeth and said, “You only know how to hide! All you do is hide behind a woman, and now you want to continue hiding, right?!”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered. “If I fight back, I’m afraid you will never have the chance to attack again.”

“You’re too arrogant!” Liu Shihui roared again and again! He had never suffered such humiliation!

With a roar, he immediately launched a second round of attacks!

Under the support of his Inner Strength, his physical strength was practically boundless. Even after dozens of punches, he still didn’t feel tired!

Qin Yu stepped back while sizing up the Inner Strength displayed by Liu Shihui.

Unlike ordinary punches, Liu Shihui’s entire body was enveloped by the Inner Strength.

This not only reduced the consumption of his physical strength, but also ensured that his body wouldn’t be easily injured.

“So this is how Inner Strength is used.” Qin Yu seemed to have understood something.

He roared angrily and instantly released the spiritual power in his body!

The surging spiritual power quickly wrapped around Qin Yu, and in an instant, Qin Yu felt his body become even lighter!

“So this is how you use it.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little pleasantly surprised.

“You’re courting death!” Liu Shihui, who wasn’t far away, roared loudly and fiercely threw a punch towards Qin Yu’s face!

This time, Qin Yu didn’t dodge, and allowed his fist to punch him!

“Bang!” A loud sound was heard! The fist smashed onto Qin Yu’s face!

“Mr. Qin!” Yao Qing couldn’t help but roar!

He stared at Qin Yu with worry.

Liu Shihui, on the other hand, laughed out loud.

“Qin Yu, do you see this? This is the power of an Inner Strength Master Hand!” Liu Shihui said proudly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Inner Strength Master Hand... is this all you have? I’m a little disappointed.” At this moment, Qin Yu’s voice came from behind.

Liu Shihui’s expression changed. He hurriedly turned around and saw Qin Yu standing unharmed on the spot! A calm smile was on his face!

“How... how is this possible?!”

This time, Liu Shihui wasn’t the only one who was shocked! Wei Ming and the others on the spectator stand were also dumbfounded!

Liu Shihui’s fist... couldn’t hurt Qin Yu?

Qin Yu wiped the dust off his face and sneered. “It’s my turn now.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu arrived in front of Liu Shihui!

Before Liu Shihui could even react, his lower abdomen was punched by Qin Yu’s fist!

The intense pain made him instantly cower into fetal position, and a mouthful of fresh blood suddenly spurted out of his mouth!

Qin Yu didn’t stop there. He hit Liu Shihui’s back with his elbow!

“Ah! !”

It was extremely painful!

Liu Shihui only felt extreme pain! The Inner Strength wrapped around him seemed to have been directly smashed through! His body fell to the ground with a bang!

Everyone couldn’t help but gape at this scene.

He... was completely on a different level! Liu Shihui was basically being beaten up!

Qin Yu looked at Liu Shihui coldly and said, “Liu Shihui, it’s over. It’s time for you to fulfill your promise.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and looked at Yao Qing, who wasn’t far away.

“I haven’t lost yet!” Liu Shihui shouted and actually stood up from the ground again!

He opened his palm, and a faint light actually appeared in his palm.

This light was like a dagger, and traces of a dangerous internal qi spread out instantly!

“What’s going on? Why is Young Master Liu’s hand flashing?”

“Is it a special effect? D*mn, this is the first time I’ve seen a special effect on the spot!”

“He looks so cool! Young Master Liu, you can do it!”

The crowd clamored. They didn’t understand the situation, and thought that Liu Shihui had used some special effect.

Yet the many martial arts experts on the guest stand were all shocked!

“Young Master Liu is really a genius. He can actually release Inner Strength.” Someone exclaimed.

“Yeah, even I didn’t realize that Young Master Liu had mastered it so skillfully at such a young age.”

“I’m afraid Qin Yu is going to be in trouble. However, it’s already very impressive for him to hold his own against Young Master Liu.”

The crowd discussed animatedly. They were all shocked by Liu Shihui’s skills.

Wei Ming was silent. It was very difficult for an Inner Strength Master Hand to release his Inner Strength. It was indeed shocking that Liu Shihui was able to do it.

“Liu Shihui has actually reached such a level...” The worry on Yao Qing’s face became even more intense.
