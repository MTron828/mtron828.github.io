Qin Yu didn’t speak for a long time, and Jiang Gu didn’t dare to say anything.

After a long time, Qin Yu slowly sighed.

“Mr. Qin, what... is wrong?” Jiang Gu couldn’t hold it in anymore.

Qin Yu shook his head and smiled. “Nothing.”

He clenched his fist. As expected, he had returned to the realm of a Inner Strength Grandmaster.

Originally, he didn’t want to borrow this ancestor’s strength, but unexpectedly, he insisted on sending it over.

Then he had no other choice. He could only ‘be forced’ to borrow the power of the Earth Fiend Valley to get rid of the Earth Fiend Valley.

Chuzhou was very far from Yunzhou, so the plane stopped at an airport midway.

After the stop, a few people boarded the plane.

Originally, there was no one at Qin Yu’s side, but after the stop this time, a girl boarded the plane.

This girl was about twenty years old, and she was dressed very cutely.

And there was a young man beside her. The young man was dressed in a tight suit, and his internal qi was extraordinary.

Qin Yu looked closely and found that this young man was actually at the peak of the Inner Strength Master Hands realm.

This made Qin Yu somewhat surprised.

“I didn’t expect to meet an Inner Strength Master Hands on the plane...” Qin Yu touched his chin and thought to himself.

At this moment, the girl took out a pile of snacks from her bag and handed a bag to Qin Yu politely.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I don’t want to eat it.”

The girl put the snacks aside and said with a smile, “Are you going to Yunzhou too?”

Qin Yu didn’t want to chat, so he just nodded.

However, the girl was quite friendly. She introduced herself, “My name is Tang Ling, and that’s my friend Cheng Cai.”

Qin Yu nodded and didn’t say anything. Instead, he closed his eyes.

At this time, Cheng Cai frowned and said, “Why are you so rude?”

“Gee, it’s okay.” Tang Ling quickly waved her hand.

Then, Tang Ling began to eat snacks on the plane.

Meanwhile, Cheng Cai’s gaze fell on Jiang Gu.

He stared at Jiang Gu for a long time, then leaned forward and whispered, “Are you a martial artist?”

Jiang Gu glanced at him without saying anything.

Cheng Cai wasn’t angry. He said excitedly, “From your internal qi, you are at least an Inner Strength Grandmaster, right?”

Jiang Gu frowned and asked, “What’s the matter?”

Cheng Cai quickly waved his hand and said, “Nothing, nothing. I’m just curious... you’re a master, right?”

“A first level Inner Strength Grandmaster,” Jiang Gu said indifferently.

When he heard these words, Cheng Cai’s eyes instantly lit up!

He excitedly said, “Greetings, senior! I didn’t expect to actually meet an Inner Strength Grandmaster like you on the plane!”

After that, Cheng Cai started chattering non-stop while continuously expressing his respect.

Jiang Gu was so annoyed that his face turned ashen. He couldn’t help but say, “Do you have anything else to say? If there’s nothing else, I want to rest.”

Cheng Cai hurriedly said, “please rest first.”

The surroundings finally quieted down. Jiang Gu closed his eyes and restrained the internal qi on his body.

The plane passed by in the high sky and sped toward Yunzhou.

At this time, Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi had already been brought to the Earth Fiend Valley.

On the way to the Earth Fiend Valley, the old man fed Xiao Yu a pill.

After taking the pill, Xiao Yu unexpectedly woke up.

Even the wounds on her body were slowly healing.

At this moment, Xiao Yu and Xiao Mi were imprisoned in a dungeon.

This dungeon was specially used to lock up young girls who were virgins. At a glance, there were at least hundreds of people in the dungeon.

Every young girl’s face was filled with fear.

They were shouting desperately, but no one could come to save them.

“Xiao Yu, what should we do now...” Xiao Mi grabbed Xiao Yu’s arm in fear while her whole body trembled non-stop.

Xiao Yu was also afraid and her pretty face was filled with fear.

After looking at the surrounding environment, Xiao Yu was on the verge of breaking down.

But at this moment, Qin Yu’s figure flashed through her mind.

Whenever she thought of Qin Yu, Xiao Yu was filled with a sense of security.

“Don’t be afraid. We’ll be fine.” Looking at the crying Xiao Mi, Xiao Yu held back her fear and comforted her.

However, Xiao Mi couldn’t suppress the fear in her heart.

She was a city girl, so how could she have ever seen such a scene?

To Xiao Mi, this dungeon was a living h*ll!

“I don’t want to die. Xiao Mi, I don’t want to die...” Xiao Mi was so scared that her tears flowed down her face, and her pupils dilated.

“It’s all Qin Yu’s fault. If it weren’t for him, we wouldn’t have been caught and brought here...” Xiao Mi said with despair.

Hearing this, Xiao Mi said with exasperation, “Wasn’t it Yang Zhao who harmed us? You don’t blame Yang Zhao, but you blame Qin Yu?”

“If it wasn’t because Qin Yu rejected his challenge, we wouldn’t have fallen for Yang Zhao’s trick...” Xiao Mi said with a trembling voice.

Xiao Yu was instantly speechless and didn’t say anything more.

She glanced at her surroundings. The entire dungeon was filled with helpless young girls. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“When I get out, I’ll definitely get my dad to eradicate this place!” Xiao Yu muttered.

“You want to get out of here? Dream on,” someone next to her snorted.

“If you come here, you can forget about leaving.”

Hearing this, Xiao Mi became even more desperate. She couldn’t help but burst into tears in the dungeon.

A hint of fear flashed across Xiao Yu’s face.

She was only a teenager. If she were to be locked up here for the rest of her life, that would be worse than death!

At such a critical moment, for some reason, Qin Yu’s figure flashed across Xiao Yu’s mind.

“Qin Yu...” Xiao Yu looked at the glimmer of light outside and couldn’t help but mutter softly.

...

The plane flew high in the sky for seven hours before landing.

At this time, the sky had brightened.

Qin Yu looked at his watch. It was five o’clock in the morning.

“I hope Xiao Yu is okay...” Qin Yu clenched his teeth and fist.

“where are you going?” On the other side, Cheng Cai was still following Jiang Gu closely.

Jiang Gu glanced at him and said coldly, “An ancient tower.”

“What a coincidence!” Cheng Cai’s eyes lit up.

He hurriedly said, “We’re also going to an ancient tower! Can we go together?”

“There’s no need to go together,” Qin Yu said with an impassive expression.

Cheng Cai glared at Qin Yu and berated, “Did I ask you? Who wants to go with you?”

After saying that, Cheng Cai looked at Jiang Gu with a sheepish smile.

“Let’s go together. We can take care of each other on the way...”

Jiang Gu snorted lightly. He ignored Cheng Cai and walked to Qin Yu. He bowed and said, “Mr. Qin, I will arrange a car now. Please wait a moment.”
