Chapter 390: One Against Three! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The collision of the two forces caused a huge impact!

Yao Qing and Taozi were sent flying dozens of meters by the impact!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu used his physical strength to forcefully shatter the force!

The rippling force was like pieces of debris that spread out in all directions.

Qiao Wu’s expression was livid. The corners of his mouth twitched, and anger filled him.

“I want to see how long you can last!” Qiao Wu roared. His hands moved quickly, and the waves of power quickly gathered!

Level 1, level 2, level 3! A total of nine levels of power was brewing in his hands!

“Rumble...”

The intense power made it difficult for Qiao Wu to control it. His hands were trembling non-stop, as if he could lose control of it at any time!

“Go to h*ll!” Followed by Qiao Wu’s furious roar, this power was ruthlessly thrown out!

A huge energy ball suddenly smashed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn, and his eyes were filled with intense belligerence!

“Good timing!” Qin Yu’s feet suddenly shook, and beams of resplendent golden light came down from above before wrapping around his fist.

A fierce force erupted at this moment!

“I don’t believe that your fist can be this powerful!” Qiao Wu roared crazily!

He stared at Qin Yu to see Qin Yu being shattered by the energy!

But at this moment, Qiao Wu’s pupils suddenly dilated, and his face instantly turned extremely pale!

Because Qin Yu, who was standing in front of him, had suddenly disappeared!

“Oh no!” Qiao Wu quickly regained his senses, but it was already too late!

“Who told you that I’m going to take it head on?” Qin Yu’s voice sounded from behind Qiao Wu.

Qiao Wu’s heart suddenly thumped! Just as he was about to turn around, Qin Yu’s fist had already smashed into his back!

“Boom!”

This powerful force smashed onto Qiao Wu’s body firmly!

Qiao Wu’s entire body was sent flying, his back was shattered beyond recognition, and his spine suffered a huge impact!

“Wah!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out from Qiao Wu’s mouth!

“You... are shameless!” Qiao Wu said in pain.

Qin Yu sneered. “You’re too stupid. The Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique sn’t just for escaping.”

As he spoke, rays of light had already condensed in Qin Yu’s palm.

Just as this ray of light was about to fall, the two Inner Strength Grandmasters finally made their move!

They pincer attacked from both sides and arrived in front of Qin Yu at the same time!

“Heavy Falling Space!”

Just as the two of them approached, Qin Yu coldly spat out these few words!

The movements of the two of them instantly seemed to be restricted, and their speed instantly became much slower!

“Slap!”

Before they reacted, a golden palm had already slapped their faces!

Qin Yu’s strength was extremely great, and under the support of the magical force, he shattered the faces of the two of them!

“How is this possible!?” These two people’s expressions were extremely unsightly!

One had to know that they were genuine peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters! Right now, they were completely no match for an Inner Strength Past Master!

“Attack together and kill him!” Qiao Wu hurriedly shouted from the ground.

The two people didn’t dare to be negligent and immediately unleashed their spells. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The atmosphere was filled with belligerence. The extremely dazzling spells even brightened the surroundings!

On the other hand, Qin Yu didn’t have any flashy spells. All he had was an extremely powerful fist!

“Boom!”

There were explosive sounds sounding nonstop. Qin Yu was fighting one against two, but he wasn’t at a disadvantage at all. He even forced the two of them into retreat!

“If this continues, I’m afraid we’ll die here,” Qiao Wu said coldly.

He immediately mobilized the internal qi in his body and chanted the spell silently.

“Clang!”

Following the completion of the spell, rays of golden light actually emerged from the bodies of the three people!

The golden light condensed in the sky above Qin Yu and finally turned into a golden tower!

This golden tower carried a majestic aura, as if it was a sacred object!

“To be able to force us to this extent, Qin Yu, you’re impressive enough,” Qiao Wu said coldly.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the huge golden tower. There was no emotion in his indifferent eyes.

“What is this thing?” A moment later, Qin Yu pointed at the golden tower and asked.

Qiao Wu sneered and said, “This technique is called the Three Directions Divine Tower! As long as the realm of the suppressed person is lower than the spellcaster, they will be trapped in the divine tower forever until they become nothingness!”

“Qin Yu, die!”

With the activation of the technique, this huge golden tower was pressing towards Qin Yu in an imposing manner!

Qin Yu hurriedly used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and fled to the side.

But what was shocking was that no matter how fast Qin Yu was, this golden tower would still be hanging above Qin Yu’s head!

“It’s useless! You can’t escape!” Qiao Wu roared crazily!

“Boom!”

Finally, this golden tower came down from the top and ruthlessly pressed down on him!

The entire ground was instantly shaken and a cloud of dust rose. The surroundings also slowly quieted down.

“Mr. Qin!” Yao Qing couldn’t help but shout out in worry!

Unfortunately, the golden tower was completely silent.

The two Inner Strength Grandmasters quickly walked in front of Qiao Wu and helped him up.

“You guys can go back and report your duty.” Qiao Wu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said with some pain.

The two of them nodded and then looked at Yao Qing and Taozi.

“What about the two of them?” One of the Inner Strength Grandmasters asked.

Qiao Wu glanced at them and said coldly, “They are just ants. I’ll kill them.”

“Okay.” One of the Inner Strength Grandmasters nodded and then walked towards the two of them.

Yao Qing and Taozi weren’t very strong. They weren’t able to fight back against the two Inner Strength Grandmasters.

However, at this moment, Yao Qing bravely shielded Taozi behind him and said in a low voice, “I will protect you.”

Although the two of them knew that this was like an egg hitting a rock, Taozi’s eyes still showed a trace of gratitude.

Taozi gritted her teeth. She suddenly opened her palm and a red spiritual fire instantly flew towards the Inner Strength Grandmaster!

“Bang!”

Although the spiritual fire could devour everything, Taozi’s strength was too weak. The Inner Strength Grandmaster merely raised his hand and smashed the spiritual fire into ashes.

“Humph, you’re too big for your britches,” the Inner Strength Grandmaster said coldly.

He raised his palm and a powerful internal qi condensed.

“Dong!”

Just as the Inner Strength Grandmaster was about to attack, a muffled sound suddenly came from the golden tower not far away!

“Dong!”

Before he could regain his senses, another muffled sound came from the golden tower!

“Dong! Dong! Dong!”

One muffled sound after another came from the golden tower! The entire golden tower was shaking non-stop!

Qiao Wu’s expression was a little ugly. He stared at the golden tower and said in a trembling voice, “How... How is this possible!? No one can escape from this golden tower!”

“Crack!”

As soon as he finished speaking, cracks appeared on the golden tower one after another!

“Rumble!” Finally, the golden tower couldn’t bear it anymore! Dense cracks covered the entire golden tower. In the next second, it exploded!

Rays of golden light shot out in all directions like glass shards!

“This golden tower of yours seems a little fragile.” Qin Yu said coldly.
