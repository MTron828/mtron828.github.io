Chapter 2443 - 2443: The Person Who Leads the Way

All of a sudden, Qin Yu’s soul became sluggish. Two identical blood-red moons suddenly appeared in his pupils.

His eyes were as if filled with bloodthirstiness directly feedback to his eye expressions from the soul.

Even if he closed his eyes and turned off all his divine senses, he still could not stop the blood moon from appearing in front of him.

The Yellow Springs Mark suddenly lit up, and then an enormous mental ability bubble popped up in his soul.

“You’re courting death!”

Qin Yu was instantly furious. This was too much of a bully, often taking advantage.

With such a vast amount of spirit energy being absorbed, he would soon become a walking corpse.

“Come back here! Northern Underworld Demonic Technique!”

Qin Yu suddenly stretched out his hand, and a terrifying suction force sucked back the bubble that was about to leave his body.

However, the instant the bubble burst, some tiny bubbles turned into mist and instantly fused into the air.

This portion of power would dissipate forever and could not be recovered.

“He actually dares to go against the ghost moon. As long as we can kill him, we will obtain rewarding merit points! If we can exchange for the Path of Heaven, we can break through the Ghost Soldier Realm!”

Suddenly, faint voices of dozens of ghost races sounded in Qin Yu’s ears.

“Boom!”

Qin Yu’s expression was cold, and the Soul-shattering Golden Sword slashed out.

It was a soul cultivation method that he had comprehended in the Azure

Firmament Sect Mystic Realm. It had been a long time since he last used it.

With a slash, these dozens of people completely could not resist. Their souls were wiped out by the slash.

A few mental ability bubbles appeared on the spot and then slowly disappeared.

As for their bodies, they were directly blacked out, turning into a ghostly power that Qin Yu was familiar with and dissipating in the air.

“Could it be that the bodies of the ghost race were condensed from ghostly power? Otherwise, their bodies wouldn’t have returned to such pure ghostly power so quickly.”

As the dozens of people died, Qin Yu’s Yellow Springs Mark lit up with the light of dusk again.

The light this time was even brighter than previously.

Qin Yu felt tremendously horrified, afraid that this mark would activate again.

The last time he activated it, despite all his might, there was still a little mental ability he could not absorb back.

If activated so frequently, it would be very troublesome to gather these traces of power.

However, the number “17” slowly appeared on the wooden frame constructed by the three-layered wood of Yellow Springs. The original number was “100”. After the two numbers fused together, they added up to “118”.

After that, the light from the Yellow Springs Mark dimmed.

“What the hell is this?”

For the first time, Qin Yu felt that his brain was not enough for use.

“‘118’, I can exchange it for a portion of my mental ability!”

A True Saint ghost race cultivator lightly landed behind Qin Yu. With a grab of his hand, a phantom of a ghost claw appeared. The ghost claw stretched into Qin Yu’s soul power, trying to capture his origin.

“Tell me, what is mental ability?”

Qin Yu’s soul power grabbed the ghost claw, his expression gloomy.

Just as the ghost race wanted to struggle, a wisp of the sorcerer tribe’s power of curse drifted to the ghost race’s soul through the ghost hand.

He let out a shrill scream. This was the power of the curse of the sorcerer tribe, and the pain of this power was immensely terrifying.

The ghost race frantically grabbed his own body on the ground, and soon, it tore apart, turning into ghostly qi that filled the sky.

In an instant, his soul had already been corroded by the qi of the sorcerer tribe and was riddled with holes.

In less than a few breaths, the soul could no longer withstand the power of the sorcerer tribe’s curse and directly shattered into countless soul fragments.

The moment the ghost race died, another number appeared on the wooden frame of the Yellow Springs with Qin Yu’s soul power.

The number “2” slowly appeared and overlapped with the original 118, becoming “120”.

“You’d rather have your soul scattered than to explain these things?

“And do you think I have no other way?” Qin Yu sneered.

Under the use of the Northern Underworld Demonic Technique, the soul power of the ghost race was directly absorbed into his soul.

After that, the Soul Torment Mind Technique completely refined it, restoring all the minute memories.

These two cultivation techniques were very compatible. The Northern Underworld Demonic Technique could absorb the power of the soul, while the Soul Torment Mind Technique could completely refine the soul. When combined, even some tremendously minute memories could be obtained.

After some time, Qin Yu frowned slightly.

In this memory, mental ability was just as he had guessed, the most precious power extended from the origin of the soul.

It was also the most basic power that formed the soul. Whether it was the human race, ghost race, or demon race, the main composition of the three souls and seven spirits was mental ability.

This kind of soul power contained the talent to comprehend the Path of Heaven, the cosmic luck of the true body, and some core memories.

What was the most precious memory? The companionship of one’s parents, the path of one’s partner, or the people and things that were deeply involved with the fate of a cultivator. These were the keys to the fate of a cultivator. These were the core memories.

As for those fleeting things, they were all hidden in the periphery of the soul.

At this moment, Qin Yu had refined that portion of memory from the periphery of his soul.

In this ghost realm, as long as one was under the cover of the ghost moon…

Every once in a while, the origin of the soul would segregate its mental ability.

As time passed by, the amount of mental ability that was segregated would increase until the origin completely dissipated. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

By then, the living beings would have lost all their memories, and their souls would drift around with the pulling power of the ghost realm.

They would either completely dissipate or enter the cycle of reincarnation.

These memories were somewhat fragmented, but they had given Qin Yu a general understanding.

In other words, once one entered the ghost realm, everything was beyond one’s control. The soul’s power of the origin would be continuously stripped away over time.

Qin Yu still had doubts but could not find the answer from these memories.

For example, what was the use of this number of merit points, and how to obtain them?

Qin Yu had a vague judgment that the merit points should be by adding the number of ghost races killed.

He killed 17 people just now, and he killed another one.

After deducting his own 100 points, it added up to “20”.

Perhaps this number would change according to the strength of the ghost race.

Suddenly, a violent roar came from in front.

In front of Qin Yu was a mountain range filled with ghostly qi.

The mountain range was endless, and one could not even see the end at a glance.

Moreover, it was filled with dense ghostly qi. This place was similar to the seventh or eighth level of purgatory, or some of the blessed heavens and earth in the Holy Region.

Furthermore, Qin Yu could clearly tell that the ghost race here was much stronger than previously.

It seemed that as this path extended, the ghost race he encountered had become stronger and stronger.
