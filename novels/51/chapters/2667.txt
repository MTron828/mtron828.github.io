Chapter 2668: Prajna’s Master

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“This spear is one of the top three magical artifacts on the fifth level, yet it was defeated by this person.”

Gu Tian and the other two had already arrived at the fifth level. He frowned and said.

However, he didn’t dare to stop him. Qin Yu’s Dusk Saber strike had left a deep impression on him. This guy was also a fierce god that wasn’t to be trifled with.

“They are just some weapons with incomplete artifact spirits. It isn’t worth mentioning. If that is all, I will be disappointed.”

Hua Tian patted his stomach. He stared at Qin Yu with a murderous look in his eyes, but he quickly restrained himself.

Putting Gu Tian aside for now, the people who came with him gave him a

mysterious feeling.

Although they did not have any killing intent towards him, this feeling still made him a little afraid.

Qin Yu stared coldly at Hua Tian.

He felt another force attack him along with the spear intent from the Dragon’s Roar Spear. Now, it seemed that it was this Hua Tian.

Moreover, what shocked Qin Yu was that Hua Tian’s body was emitting a

powerful divine might power at this moment.

It was very obvious that his cultivation realm was already above his.

Previously, his cultivation technique was already very difficult to deal with. Now that his cultivation realm was above Qin Yu’s strength, Qin Yu could not help but feel wary.

Moreover, he had a faint feeling that the oppressive feeling of his luck being blocked was probably given to him by this monk.

“Amitabha!”

The kasaya on Hua Tian’s body swirled, and countless tadpole-like runes swirled around his body.

The scripture was chanted from his mouth.

“Therefore, all sentient beings have no self-appearance, human appearance, sentient beings appearance, longevity appearance; There is no such thing as an appearance, and there is no such thing as an illegal appearance.”

After these Buddhist scriptures were chanted by Hua Tian, they formed smoke and dust in the air, finally turning into ancient runes one after another.

With the appearance of these runes, there seemed to be an explosion of thunder.

On the jade platform, a purple sword was unsheathed.

The sword contained a vast amount of the Buddhist Sect’s holy energy and was shaped like a budding lotus flower.

The moment it was unsheathed, the shocking Buddhist Sect’s holy energy suddenly turned into Sword Energy and burst out from the Treasure Repository Pavilion.

As for the other magical artifacts, they were intimidated by the Buddhist Sect’s Sword Energy and let out a terrified buzzing sound.

“Hahaha! It’s indeed the Buddhist Sect’s holy sword, Prajna. Since this sword has chosen its master, then I won’t stand on ceremony.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Hua Tian laughed.

“Prajna Sword?”

Qin Yu was confused. He rarely came into contact with the Buddhist Sect.

He did not know much about the Buddhist artifacts either, but the Prajna Sword was already very powerful.

“This is the holy sword of Buddhism, at least the pinnacle of saint-level artifacts. It’s named ‘Prajna’ and symbolizes the great wisdom of realizing the abstract theory. The sword contains the holy energy of the great Buddhist Sect and is shaped like a budding lotus. The purple sword is like a blooming lotus when it’s unsheathed, emitting the incomparable power of a pure saint. Moreover, it’s rumored that the mighty figures of the Buddhist Sect who have fused with this sword will trigger their powerful life-bound martial techniques when they use it.”

As if sensing Qin Yu’s thoughts, Immortal Emperor Yao suddenly spoke in the sea of consciousness.

“However, this little monk seems to have good luck. His cultivation technique shares the same origin as the Prajna Sword. That’s why this treasured sword can automatically choose its master. With this Buddhist holy sword, his strength can increase by at least 30%.”

Immortal Emperor Yao laughed strangely.

As the two of them communicated, Gu Tian also chose a weapon.

“Qin Yu, enjoy your final moments. This Saint Kingdom will eventually belong to me.”

Hua Tian’s pupils flashed, and the derivative hexagram of the Great Expansion Divine Technique flashed.

As the divination flashed past, Qin Yu suddenly felt his aura disappear a little, as if it had been captured.

“I have locked on your aura. Don’t even think about escaping.”

Hua Tian revealed a sinister smile. He didn’t wait for Qin Yu’s reply and left the Treasure Repository Pavilion with a big laugh.

No matter how many Dao points there were in the Treasure Repository Pavilion, one could only get one item every hundred years. Therefore, it was enough for him to get his perfect match- Prajna.

Moreover, he couldn’t see through the old man downstairs. Otherwise, he wouldn’t mind making a move here.

“The most urgent thing now is to familiarize myself with Prajna and increase my strength again. Now, it seems that Qin Yu’s cultivation realm is only at the early stage of Dao Consciousness. He might not have reached the complete Dao Consciousness Realm. Be it in terms of the strength of his divine soul or his physical body, he’s far inferior to me.”

Hua Tian sneered.

“Hahaha! Being targeted by the strongest outsider here is not good news.” Immortal Emperor Yao spoke again in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“This battle will come sooner or later. I am the person Chen Shuang entrusted the Seal of Heaven Returning. Whereas Hua Tian has been scheming for many years. His luck has led him to this Saint Kingdom. The sooner this battle comes, the better it will be for me.”

Qin Yu shook her head. Hua Tian had slaughtered the people from the Heavenly Cloud Continent.

Now that Hua Tian’s cultivation realm was already ahead of him, he might still have some chance.

However, this gap would probably widen as time passed.

Since there was no way to avoid it, they would fight here.

Qin Yu cast his gaze on the two magical artifacts here. He looked a little hesitant.

Why these two magical artifacts? This was because when Hua Tian activated Prajna, only these two magical artifacts did not emit any fluctuations.

The other weapons were all buzzing under the suppression of the terrifying Buddhist Sect’s holy energy. Therefore, these two magical artifacts should not be inferior to Prajna.

However, he did not dare to try them rashly. The Dragon’s Roar Spear just now had already made him use the lowest level of the Dusk Saber.

If these two magical artifacts were of a higher level than the Dragon’s Roar Spear, he would probably have to perform the full power of Dusk Saber to suppress them.

“The Heavenly Wave Sword is made of five-colored crystal essence and is owned by Su Huanzhen. This sword is blue with a hint of green, and its material is as light and clear as jade. In addition, the blood of the daughter of the god has sharpened it, so it is filled with holiness and spirituality. The abundant Heaven Yang Righteousness Energy emitted by the sword is the key to destroying the Imperial Dragon True Energy.”upda@te by new novel.

“The Nine Heavens Startling Rainbow Sword is a divine artifact forged by Jin Ziling, a swordsmith, with Yin and Yang Double Kirin Iron and forty-nine thunderbolts. The ‘Nine Heavens’ refers to the Nine Heavens. It means its power shakes the world. However, the forging process of the sword was hindered by Lord Siwu by delaying the celestial phenomena, resulting in the loss of the timing and it was not born naturally. Therefore, the display of the

Nine Heavens Startling Rainbow Sword is just a glimpse.”

The woman, who had been silent all this while, suddenly said softly.

“What do you want to choose? An outsider with two Hearts of Saint Kingdom.”

The mysterious woman stared at Qin Yu and suddenly said.

When she said that, Qin Yu instantly became vigilant.

This person’s internal qi must be a native of this place, but she can sense his Heart of Saint Kingdom.. Who is she?
