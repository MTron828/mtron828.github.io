1970 Things Remain the Same, but People Have Changed

Seeing Jue Wu falling out, Qin Yu hurried forward and helped her up.

At this moment, Jue Wu looked quite miserable. A bloody hole was in her chest and many wounds were on her body.

“Hmph! You’re lucky to have survived,” the elderly man at the side mocked.

“She’s just struggling on the verge of death,” another elderly man said.

!!

However, at this moment, another person fell out, and his condition was even more miserable. His entire body was stained red with blood, and his hand was holding onto a broken magical artifact.

“Old b*stard, you didn’t die!” Jue Wu cursed and was about to give him another kick.

Qin Yu quickly stopped Jue Wu and shook her head, “Do not fight within the Sky City.”

Jue Wu snorted and retreated to the side.

“How are you? Are you okay?” Qin Yu asked.

Jue Wu waved her hand. “It’s just a minor injury. It doesn’t matter!”

The two elderly men’s expressions were extremely ugly.

“How could this be…” one of the elderly men gritted his teeth and said.

“This little b*stard is only at the middle stage of the Reversion Void. How could she have defeated a Semi-Saint?” The other elderly man was even more shocked!

“Let’s not talk about this now. Take him away first.”

The two of them quickly walked forward and wanted to take the elderly man away.

However, when they got close, the elderly man had stopped breathing.

“Hahaha! He’s dead in the end!” Jue Wu laughed in excitement.

“Little b*stard, you’re courting death!” The two were instantly enraged, and they began to walk forward!

Fortunately, the prince appeared in time to block them.

“I’m sorry. You can’t fight in Sky City,” the prince said.

The two elderly men gritted their teeth with nowhere to vent their anger.

“Hurry up and leave.” Yao Meng urged.

The two had no choice but to leave this place with hatred.

After they left, Qin Yu looked at the prince and said, “I’ll have to trouble Your Highness to take Jue Wu for treatment.”

“Certainly,” the prince replied.

Then he waved his hand, and two people walked forward and brought Jue Wu with them.

After they left, Qin Yu looked at Yao Meng.

“You… are from the Yao family?” Qin Yu said while suppressing the shock in his heart.

Yao Meng didn’t hide anything and nodded her head, admitting to it.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh. “How terrifying! Among several people from Earth, you all have a background. Yan Ruoxue is from the Yan family, and you’re from the Yao family.”

Yao Meng sighed and said, “I don’t have a good fortune Yan Ruoxue has, nor do I have the powerful status she has. Although I’m a member of the Yao family, I’m from an extremely remote branch.”

“You saw it just now. They didn’t really obey my instructions.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. That was true.

The two were merely Semi-Saints. If it were Yan Ruoxue, they wouldn’t dare to say even a word.

After that, Qin Yu’s gaze swept across Yao Meng. To his surprise, he discovered Yao Meng’s internal qi was extremely weak. She was only a cultivator at the Early-stage of the Reversion Void!

After all, she arrived a year earlier than Qin Yu! She even entered the Yao family and had access to resources. With her talent, she shouldn’t be in this cultivation realm only.

“Your cultivation…” Qin Yu opened his mouth, and his face was full of confusion.

A trace of sadness flashed across Yao Meng’s face.

She smiled bitterly and said, “I’ve encountered a lot of things in the past few years since I came to the Holy Region. I even lost the ability to cultivate…”

“What?” Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

She lost the ability to cultivate! When Yao Meng was on Earth, her talent was no less than anyone else’s! Even Qin Yu did not dare to say he was above Yao Meng!

“This… What happened?” Qin Yu felt an unspeakable sadness in his heart.

“Let’s not talk about this,” Yao Meng shook her head and said.

Following that, there was a long silence.

Yao Meng no longer had the charm of the past. That peerless beauty of a young girl seemed to have experienced the vicissitudes of life, making people’s hearts ache.

“By the way… How did you find me?” Qin Yu asked.

“I heard about your battle with Si Shifeng in Sky City,” Yao Meng said. “After that, I immediately rushed over to Sky City.”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded, not knowing what else to say.

“By the way, do you have any news about the others?” Qin Yu asked again.

“No, it’s as if they’ve disappeared. There’s no news of them,” Yao Meng said.

“I tried to look for them, but to no avail.”

Qin Yu sighed. After so long, no one knew if those old acquaintances were still in this world.

“Thank you so much for your help this time,” Qin Yu sighed and said.

“Are you serious? Do you have to be so polite with me?” Yao Meng said jokingly.

...

Qin Yu sighed with emotion. Things indeed remained the same, but people had changed.

Just as the two were reminiscing, the prince returned with Jue Wu.

“How is it?” Qin Yu quickly got up and asked.

Without waiting for Jue Wu to speak, the prince beside her said with emotion, “Mr. Qin really has many hidden dragons and crouching tigers by your side. Master Yun said Jue Wu only needs to rest for a few days before she recovers.”

“How am I? I’ve told you I’m fine,” Jue Wu said proudly.

Qin Yu then remembered whenever Jue Wu was injured, she would recover after taking a big meal.

“Thank you very much, Your Highness,” Qin Yu said as he bowed.

“Mmm,” the prince responded. “How did you provoke the Yao family?”

It’s a long story,” Qin Yu shook his head and didn’t want to continue.

Seeing this, the prince did not say anything else. He said goodbye to Qin Yu and left.

“Yao Meng, have you ever looked for the Pavillion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavillion? She might be able to help you…” Qin Yu suddenly thought of something and asked in a hurry.

...

“I couldn’t see her,” Yao Meng shook her head and said.

“You couldn’t see her? Why is that so?” Qin Yu was even more confused.

“The place is tremendously strict. Even the Yao family would find it difficult to enter, let alone ordinary people,” Yao Meng said with a bitter smile.

“I once asked an alchemist, and he said that only a ninth-grade alchemist could help me.”

Qin Yu scratched his head.

Ninth-grade? Master Yun only seemed to be a seventh-grade alchemist.

“Don’t be so discouraged. Don’t forget I’m also an alchemist.” Qin Yu comforted her.

“When I become a ninth-grade alchemist, I will definitely help you.”

“Thank you, Brother Qin,” Yao Meng said with a smile.

Seeing Yao Meng’s lack of confidence, Qin Yu felt incredibly uncomfortable.

She was once a girl favored by the heavens, like a star in the sky. Now that she had fallen into such a state, this enormous psychological gap must be hard to fill.

…

It was late at night. Qin Yu went to Master Yun’s residence by himself.
