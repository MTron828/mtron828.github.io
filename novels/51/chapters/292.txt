Dong Tianhai’s expression changed when he saw Qin Yu!

He stood up and berated, “Qin Yu? Why are you here?”

Qin Yu sneered. “What do you think?”

Dong Tianhai said angrily, “How dare you eat my ginseng? How dare you be so rude in front of Master Gu? You are simply too insolent!”

“It’s alright. I was going to give this ginseng to Qin Yu anyway,” Gu Taichu said indifferently.

After saying that, he looked at Qin Yu and asked with concern, “Qin Yu, can you rest for just a little bit?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Master Gu, I’m in a very good condition now.”

Dong Tianhai was instantly stunned.

Didn’t Qin Yu and Gu Taichu have a deep hatred? How could they be together?

Just as Dong Tianhai was stunned, a murderous aura came straight at him!

Dong Tianhai’s heart thumped, and a hint of nervousness flashed across his face!

“Dong Tianhai, you really know how to distort the truth,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Back then, you tried to lie to me about the Nine Transformation Golden Pill, but you missed it because you were ignorant.

“Now, you are slandering me! Are you worthy of being called the Medicine King?”

Updates by

Dong Tianhai’s face was stiff and he was extremely nervous.

“The news of the Nine Transformation Golden Pill was also leaked by you, right? Could it be that you have some connection with the Hong Yi Sect?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

“You... Don’t talk nonsense!” Dong Tianhai hurriedly shouted.

“I’m talking nonsense?” Qin Yu’s expression turned cold, and his body suddenly appeared in front of Dong Tianhai!

A big hand grabbed Dong Tianhai’s neck and forcefully lifted him up!

“I have no enmity with you, yet you want to harm me! And now, you want to kill me!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“People like you should just die.”

Qin Yu’s strength slowly increased, and Dong Tianhai was suddenly unable to breathe!

Dong Tianhai was unable to retaliate against Qin Yu!

“Forget it, Qin Yu. Dong Tianhai is the Medicine King of a generation after all. Give him another chance,” Gu Taichu said slowly.

Qin Yu glanced at Gu Taichu, and then released his hand.

Dong Tianhai laid on the ground while desperately breathing in the fresh air.

This feeling of being on the verge of death made him both angry and terrified.

“Since Master Gu has pleaded for you, I’ll give you another chance,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

“In three days, send me ten herbs that are more than 500 years old, and I’ll spare your life,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

When he said this, everyone was shocked!

Even Gu Taichu widened his eyes!

Ten stalks of five-hundred-year-old herbs? This was simply too much!

“Qin Yu, aren’t you going a little too far? Where am I going to find ten stalks for you?!” Dong Tianhai said angrily.

Qin Yu sneered. “That has nothing to do with me. You can think of a way yourself.”

“Aren’t you a little too greedy?! Do you think that five-hundred-year-old herbs are as abundant as cabbages by the roadside?!” Dong Tianhai said angrily.

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered. “What? Your life isn’t even worth ten herbs?”

“You!” Dong Tianhai was instantly speechless.

He stood up from the ground, turned around, and was about to leave.

“Remember, if I don’t see the herbs in three days, I will visit you,” Qin Yu said coldly.

When he heard this, Dong Tianhai’s body stiffened. Then, he turned around and left without looking back.

After Dong Tianhai left, Gu Taichu couldn’t help but say, “Qin Yu, ten stalks of herbs is indeed too many.”

“Is it too many? I don’t think so,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Gu Taichu said in a deep voice, “Don’t forget Dong Tianhai’s identity. He is the Medicine King!”

“Over the years, he has accumulated countless connections! Ten stalks of herbs are enough to tempt anyone!”

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “That’s really a little troublesome.”

Of course, although Qin Yu said so, he didn’t take it to heart.

Now, Qin Yu had learned the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique. Even if he really couldn’t beat him, he could at most run away.

Then, Qin Yu swallowed this five-hundred-year-old ginseng.

After eating this herb, Qin Yu could clearly feel that he was about to break through, but he couldn’t reach that step.

“This is really strange.” Qin Yu shook his head helplessly.

He tried to absorb the spiritual energy around him, but unfortunately, he was still unable to break through.

The next day, before Qin Yu and Gu Taichu could wake up, a thunderous roar came from outside!

“Qin Yu, come out and accept your death!”

The voice came from all directions and made the house vibrate!

This explosive roar contained inner strength, and it spread across almost half of the city!

For a moment, everyone was startled by this shout!

“Qin Yu, come out and face your death!” There was another angry roar!

The successive sounds attracted countless people to come and watch!

“It’s Chi Feng! Master Gu’s personal disciple!”

“What happened?”

“Qin Yu? Isn’t he the King of Chuzhou who killed Gu Jinhong not long ago?”

For a moment, the onlookers were confused about the situation.

Wasn’t Chi Feng Gu Taichu’s disciple? Wasn’t Qin Yu Gu Taichu’s enemy?

Why did they suddenly change sides?

“Qin Yu, come out and face your death!” Chi Feng roared again!

With this roar, the entire house began to collapse!

“Enough, stop shouting. You’re like a shrew. Don’t you find it annoying?” At this moment, Yao Qing muttered as he walked out.

Chi Feng sized up Yao Qing and sneered. “It’s you? What, Qin Yu doesn’t dare to come out and ask you to come out and die for him?”

“Who said I don’t dare to come out?” At this moment, Qin Yu walked out from the Gu family’s home.

He looked calm, as if he didn’t take Chi Feng seriously at all.

“It’s really the King of Chuzhou! Why is he in Master Gu’s residence?” Someone recognized Qin Yu and couldn’t help but look surprised.

Chi Feng’s lips curled into a cold smile. He took this opportunity to shout, “Qin Yu killed my senior, Gu Jinhong! And my master is afraid of Qin Yu, so he isn’t willing to avenge my junior!”

“Gu Taichu can tolerate it, but I, Chi Feng, can’t!”

“But my master expelled me from the sect because of this!”

Everyone was shocked when they heard this!

Gu Taichu was actually that cowardly? He even chased Chi Feng out?

Gu Taichu, who was not far away, was so angry that his face was ashen and his entire body was trembling!

“Chi Feng, you vile creature!” Gu Taichu could not help but gnash his teeth as he spoke.

Chi Feng immediately put on a pitiful appearance and said, “Master, we have been friends for many years. I won’t do anything to you.”

“But no matter how much you hate me, I will kill Qin Yu and avenge my junior!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

These words immediately caused waves of cheers!

“Chi Feng is justified in avenging his junior!”

“Gu Taichu’s own disciple was killed, but he was unmoved. He really doesn’t live up to his reputation as a Master!”

“Tsk tsk, I support Chi Feng!”

Gu Taichu was so angry that his vision darkened and his body trembled.

If it weren’t for Qin Yu supporting him, he would have collapsed on the spot!

“Chi Feng, you’re really a b*stard,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Chi Feng sneered. “You’re the b*stard!”

Qin Yu looked at Chi Feng coldly and said, “You betrayed Master Gu, killed everyone in the Gu family, and even threatened to get rid of Gu Taichu and take over his position!”

“And now, you’re twisting the truth!”

“The crowd can discern the truth. How could they be fooled by your words? Don’t they know Master Gu’s character?”

Qin Yu was extremely eloquent. Not only did he tell the truth, but he also rallied the group of spectators.

“That’s true. We can’t just listen to Chi Feng’s one-sided words.”

“We all know Master Gu’s character very well. He’s definitely not the kind of person that Chi Feng says he is!”

“But why would Master Gu collude with Qin Yu? It’s indeed a little strange.”

Chi Feng’s expression was a little ugly. He didn’t expect that Qin Yu would change the public’s opinion with just a few words!

“Whether it’s true or not, the crowd can discern the truth.” Chi Feng copied Qin Yu’s words.

“You all saw it. Gu Taichu and Qin Yu are standing together. This is the truth!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Chi Feng, you’re really destined to be a disciple. What? You even have to copy others when you speak? You’re too slow-witted.”

“Yeah,” Yao Qing muttered softly.

Chi Feng was so angry that his face turned ashen and he almost collapsed!

“Nonsense! Qin Yu, you’re slandering me!” Chi Feng’s defense sounded somewhat feeble and powerless.

Qin Yu sneered. “I’m afraid you don’t know that there are surveillance cameras in Master Gu’s residence, right? The scene of you killing people on that day has been recorded.”

“Bullsh*t! I destroyed the surveillance cameras in advance!” Chi Feng hurriedly said.

Qin Yu spread his hands out and didn’t say anything more. There was only a hint of amusement on his face.

Chi Feng’s expression instantly changed drastically!

Oh no, he was tricked by Qin Yu!
