2337 Descending

Qin Yu did not hesitate and grabbed the inner cores. He instantly absorbed all their spiritual energy.

“Sigh! This glazed body is indeed terrifying. At the rate it consumes spiritual energy, I’m afraid even the wealthiest aristocratic families can’t sustain it.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Qin Yu’s face was full of bitterness. Although he could feel the terrifying energy in his glass-like neck vertebrae, when would this consumption of spiritual energy end?

He had only grown a bit but had already consumed so much spiritual energy.

How much energy would it take to grow into the Glazed Holy Body?

“Be content, Kid. Since ancient times, less than a handful of people have succeeded in cultivating the Glazed Holy Body. They were all obtained by chance when their body refinement reached the utmost. If it weren’t for the fact that you’ve refined your body to the utmost and have the help of the flame of the Vermilion Bird, you probably couldn’t condense this Glazed Holy Body.”

Elder Guai said with a smile. Now that he was getting more familiar with Qin Yu, his tone was no longer as solemn as before.

“Well, though that’s true, growing to full strength will take a long time. Right now, my physical strength is completely inadequate to handle it. I can probably only unleash up to 20% of my true power at the moment.”

Other than the glazed holy bones, everything else was too weak.

He could not even endure the shock by activating his divine sense.

“Hmm?”

In the distance, a powerful fluctuation suddenly spread over.

Qin Yu frowned and explored for a while. “It seems to be the internal qi of the Black Platform Continent’s teleportation formation. It seems that some people have been teleported here, and there are quite a number of them.”

What they were unaware of was the first batch of people from the Holy Region had already entered purgatory after negotiations with many parties.

“Could it be that the Holy Region has sent cultivators here again? Every once in a while, the Holy Region would throw the sinners from there into purgatory. Perhaps new people were coming.”

Elder Guai said with a frown.

“Jue Wu, accompany me to purgatory. I want to absorb the energy of the Bone Cultivation River. My body now is too weak.”

Qin Yu faintly had a bad feeling. The energy of the teleportation formation had persisted.

It would not have taken so long if it was just sending a batch of people.

Thinking about the recent expansion of the spatial rift, Qin Yu had made a vague judgment in his heart.

“Alright, it so happens that I’m going to hunt for the inner cores of the demon beasts nearby. Don’t worry, I’ll protect you now!”

Jue Wu jumped up and sat on Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“Can you watch out your manners a little bit?”

Qin Yu was a little dissatisfied. His Sumeru qi swept up Elder Guai and the others, and they headed to the seventh level of purgatory.

“Get lost.”

When they reached the seventh level of purgatory, Jue Wu directly kicked the person in the center flying.

Seeing Jue Wu as fierce as a demon god, that cultivator dared not say a thing and immediately left dejectedly.

Qin Yu’s entire body sank into the bone cultivation water and unleashed the Traceless Immortal Scripture.

With him as the center, the Bone Cultivation River became a massive vortex.

Terrifying spiritual energy surged into his body. The glazed holy bones absorbed the utmost energy in the bone cultivation water before his muscles could absorb it.

Qin Yu had wanted to refine his other mortal bones first, but the glazed holy bones seemed to have a natural attraction to spiritual energy.

Qin Yu could not refine his other muscles and bones.

Qin Yu sighed. His strength could recover 60 to 70% if he could refine the other parts first.

From the looks of it now, he could only wait until the Glazed Holy Body succeeded before he could recover his combat strength.

Qin Yu calmed down and absorbed the vast amount of spiritual energy crazily.

…

On the Black Platform Continent.

“Are you the City Lord of Black Platform City?”

Yao Xi asked with a frown.

“Yes, please give your orders, my lord.” Hei Yun trembled in fear, not daring to raise his head.

After this group of people arrived in Black Platform City, an unremarkable aristocratic family took offense but did not expect to be completely wiped out by a single person on the same day.

Dozens of people were in front of him. He felt that any one of them could kill him effortlessly.

“Immediately inform all the sects, aristocratic families, and rogue cultivators above the True Saint in purgatory to send their strongest forces to Solitary Cloud City under my command. The deadline is ten days. Whoever does not show up in Solitary Cloud City within ten days will die!”

“My lord, the sects and aristocratic families are easy to deal with, but the rogue cultivators are too scattered, so it’s not easy to notify them individually.”

“It’s fine. We have our own ways to notify the rogue cultivators. You just need to send the information to all the aristocratic families and sects. Also, compile all the information about Qin Yu and hand over every piece of information about his arrival here. I’ll make sure you can’t even beg for death if I find even one piece of missing information.”

Yao Xi’s face was full of killing intent. “Qin Yu, I want to see how much you’ve progressed by coming here.”

“Yes, sir! Don’t worry, my lord. I won’t miss any information.”

Hei Yun had never felt so aggrieved before this but dared not even fart.

“Our first priority is to take control of all the factions and then use this time to gather all the resources. The Supreme Elder of the Si family has passed down a map that records the potential ancient realm and treasures in this ancient battlefield. All of these things must belong to the nine great aristocratic families.”

“Mmm, Holy Son Yao is very thoughtful. Furthermore, we’ve already sent people to investigate the various sects and aristocratic families. The wealth accumulated by the larger aristocratic families must also be handed over. Handling this matter properly could be a good thing for our nine great aristocratic families.”

An elder of the Ni family said.

“And this Qin Yu must die as well. I heard from the Holy Lord that the Supreme Elder has sent news that this kid has great cosmic luck in purgatory and many treasures on him. He could actually escape from the Vermilion Bird’s attack despite being a fourth-grade True Saint.”

The person who spoke was one of the people who attacked Qin Yu when he left the Holy Region. His face was full of dense killing intent.

“This kid has an irreconcilable grudge against us. Regardless of the numerous treasures he possesses or the grudge between us, our top priority is to locate and eliminate him!”

“He would be nothing if he didn’t rely on the treasures on him! Only he, Qin Yu, has treasures? This time, I want to see how he can turn the tables.”

Yao Xi’s body emitted a surge of holy qi, and the fluctuation of his internal qi was frightening. It had reached ninth grade in such a short time.

Qin Yu placed all his attention on cultivation at this time, so he was completely unaware of this information.

After cultivating for several days, the demonic qi contained in the bone cultivation water at the seventh level had become much thinner.

Once again, he and Jue Wu stepped into the eighth level of purgatory.

“Get lost!”

Jue Wu did the same. She picked up the cultivator who occupied the center and sent him flying.

That person was also fierce. He immediately formed the power of rules in his hand and attacked Jue Wu.

“You’re courting death!”

Jue Wu’s face revealed a fierce look as she clenched her fist.

She allowed the power of rules to explode in her hand, and her other hand directly smashed the cultivator’s head.
