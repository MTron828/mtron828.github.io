Chapter 458: Fear Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Hearing the name of the Han family, He Teng was a little surprised.

He said politely, “Mr. Han, why are you looking for me?”

On the other end, Han Meng asked coldly, “I heard that you issued a challenge to Qin Yu?”

He Teng sighed and said, “Yes, it’s a pity that Qin Yu hasn’t appeared yet.”

Han Meng was silent for a moment before he said coldly, “Then what do you plan to do?”

He Teng hurriedly said, “I do want to threaten him, but it’s not good to be too high-profile, so I can only wait.”

Han Meng said coldly, “Do what you want to do. As for the rest, the Han family will handle it for you.”

He Teng was instantly overjoyed!

He hurriedly asked, “Mr. Han, is what you said true?”

“Yes,” Han Meng answered. “But I hope to see Qin Yu seriously injured or crippled.”

He Teng was a smart man. He immediately understood what Han Meng meant.

“Mr. Han, please rest assured. I will definitely give you a satisfactory result,” He Teng said indifferently.

After hanging up the phone, Han Wei walked over from the side.

“Dad, why did you let him cripple Qin Yu? Do you think I’m not a match for Qin Yu?” Han Wei said with some displeasure.

Han Meng glanced at Han Wei and said in a deep voice, “In order to prevent accidents, it’s better to cripple him first. If you lose...”

“There are no ifs!” Han Wei said angrily.

“Who does Qin Yu think he is? He’s just an ant under my feet. I can stomp him to death easily!”

Han Meng said in a deep voice, “I believe in your abilities, but not only do we have to win, but we also have to win easily. Do you understand?”

“Moreover, don’t underestimate Qin Yu.”

Han Wei clenched his teeth and said nothing in the end.

...

After he received the call from the Han family, He Teng’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Since the Han family is backing me up, then I have nothing to be afraid of,” He Teng said with a cold smile.

Then, he immediately sent someone out to spread the word:

Three days later, if Qin Yu doesn’t appear, then Mr. He will make a move on the people around Qin Yu.

If he doesn’t appear, then he will kill a person each day until he appears!

This immediately shocked everyone in Chuzhou!

And the people with ties to Qin Yu were trembling!

“It seems that He Teng is very confident that he can use such a method to force Qin Yu to show up.”

“He is a half-step Martial Marquis after all. It isn’t difficult to get rid of Qin Yu.”

“Just wait and see. Let’s see if Qin Yu will show up for the people around him or continue to be a coward.”

...

Time passed by minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, two days had passed. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

There was only one day left.

However, there was no movement from Qin Yu. No one could find any trace of him.

For a time, Chuzhou was in a panic.

Some people who had ties to Qin Yu even ran away during the night out of fear!

“He Teng has already reached the door of his house, but Qin Yu hasn’t appeared. How ridiculous.”

“He has already used his friends as a threat, but he still hasn’t shown up. It seems that he is a coward.”

“Hehe, those with ties to Qin Yu will regret it.”

At this time, Taozi and Yao Qing hadn’t left Chuzhou.

Although they knew very well that the first people He Teng would look for was very likely them, the two of them weren’t willing to leave.

“What if Elder Qin really doesn’t appear?” Asked Taozi in a low voice.

Yao Qing waved his hand and said, “Impossible! He’s not the kind of person to run away at the last minute! Don’t worry. Let’s carry on as usual!”

Speaking up to this point, Yao Qing said secretively, “I just stole a goat. Tonight, we’ll roast the whole goat and eat it!”

Taozi couldn’t help but sigh and say helplessly, “You’re really trusting.”

Yao Qing rolled his eyes and said, “I already said that you don’t have to worry. Mr. Qin will definitely come back.”

...

At this moment, Qin Yu was immersed in cultivation in the Water Rhyme Tower.

This kind of immersive cultivation made Qin Yu unable to feel the passage of time.

And his strength was also silently increasing.

Qin Yu knew nothing about what was happening in the outside world.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Qin Yu’s strength had also advanced from the third level of the Enlightenment Stage to the fifth level of the Enlightenment Stage.

“According to this speed, in a week at most, I will be able to advance to the half-step Martial Marquis Realm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of anyone at the same level, not even He Teng or Han Wei.

Then, he closed his eyes again and continued to absorb the spiritual energy from the Water Rhyme Tower.

Chuzhou was already in chaos.

It was noon, and the sun was already high in the sky.

It was supposed to be a leisurely afternoon, but a piece of news made everyone anxious.

“The time is up, but Qin Yu hasn’t appeared. I will keep my promise.”

He Teng’s words spread throughout the streets!

Yao Qing, who was sleeping, was pushed up by Taozi.

“Time is up. Elder Qin hasn’t returned,” said Taozi with a frown.

Yao Qing rubbed his sleepy eyes and muttered, “Time is up so soon? It shouldn’t be...”

Taozi wasn’t in the mood to listen to his nonsense. She whispered, “Why don’t we leave Chuzhou first and lay low until Elder Qin comes back?”

Yao Qing turned over and muttered, “I’m not leaving. I don’t believe that He Teng can do anything to me...”

After saying that, Yao Qing fell into a deep sleep again.

Taozi couldn’t wait any longer. Of course, she didn’t want to leave Chuzhou, but if she continued to stay, she might die.

After thinking for a while, Taozi gritted her teeth and said, “Forget it. Let’s take it one step at a time.”

Hence, Taozi lay beside Yao Qing and also fell asleep.

At the entrance of the hotel, He Teng was standing there quietly.

“Who should I start from?” He Teng thought to himself.

“Jiang Gu? Gu Taichu? Or the four great families of Chuzhou?”

“As far as I know, there seem to be many families in Chuzhou. Qin Yu is very close to them.”

After thinking about it, He Teng decided not to touch Jiang Gu and Gu Taichu for the time being.

These two people had a certain amount of influence, so they would be kept for other purposes.

That afternoon, there was a piece of news from Chuzhou:

Wang Wu, of one of the four great families in Chuzhou, was killed by He Teng in one move!

Once this news was sent out, everyone couldn’t help but feel stunned.

He Teng didn’t go find Jiang Gu, but he actually made a move on Wang Wu?

Although the Wang family had long since submitted to Qin Yu, they weren’t close to Qin Yu, and they even rarely met!

The next day, another piece of news was sent out:

The patriarch of the Luo family, one of the four great families, was also killed in one move!

In the three consecutive days, three people from the four great families had died!

This was enough to prove that He Teng wasn’t joking!

In the Jiang family’s home, Jiang Gu stood in front of the window, staring into the distance.

At this moment, his butler Uncle Zhong suddenly walked forward and whispered, “The four family heads of the four great families have already died. I’m afraid we will be next.”

Jiang Gu remained silent and didn’t comment on this.

“Master, I’m afraid that Qin Yu won’t come back. We should hurry and run.” Uncle Zhong advised bitterly.

Jiang Gu looked at Uncle Zhong coldly and said, “Impossible. He will definitely come back.”

Uncle Zhong sighed and said, “Three people have already died. Do we have to wait for death?”

Jiang Gu opened his mouth and sighed again and again.

Yes, what was the point of staying?

“Wait a little longer.” Jiang Gu took a deep breath.

He believed that Qin Yu wasn’t a coward who avoided taking responsibility.
