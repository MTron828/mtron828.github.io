Chapter 1498: Chapter 1,498, the legend of the three madmen and three ultimate skills

Sima Bei’s expression was extremely ugly when he saw Qu Zhu rushing over.

Even though his face was covered in a black robe, one could still feel the gloominess on his face.

“Looks like we’ve underestimated you.”After a long while, Sima bei let out a long sigh.

Following that, he sneered, “Alright then, I’ll get rid of both of you together.”

Qu Zhu’s internal Qi was obviously not that stable. Even though he had killed all the people of the northern lands, it was not that easy.

Therefore, his arrival did not cause Si Ma bei to be too afraid.

Jue Wu and Qu Zhu, two top-notch martial artist, were working together. This was a rare sight.

Qin Yu stood beside Jue Wu and looked coldly at the people in front of him.

Just now, he had not used the fighting word formula. In other words, Qin Yu still had a lot of room for improvement.

“Come, let me help you recover your internal Qi.”

At this moment, Jue Wu suddenly ran behind Qu Zhu.

She raised her small hand and patted qu Zhu’s back.

Streams of spiritual Qi surged into his body.

In a moment, qu Zhu’s internal Qi slowly stabilized! The Spiritual Qi in his body also recovered rapidly!

Such a scene could not help but cause people to be greatly shocked!

Sima bei’s expression became extremely unsightly. He glared angrily at Jue Wu, his heart filled with both anger and shock!

Just what kind of freak was this! How could his body have such dense spiritual power and could actually transmit spiritual Qi to others! !

Qin Yu could not help but swallow his saliva.

Although he had already seen so for myself on Mount Hua Ning, seeing such a scene still shocked Qin Yu greatly.

No wonder the northern lands wanted to get rid of so for myself first. Her existence was really too abnormal!

“How could such a monster be born between heaven and earth...”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Cultivation did not require hard work, and the spiritual Qi in his body could be said to be endless.

What kind of existence was this!

“No, I must get rid of Jue Wu as soon as possible, no matter what price I have to pay!”Sima bei became even more determined to kill Jue Wu!

The people around him began to move, and each of their bodies emitted a thick fog.

It had to be said that their actions were very similar to He Teng’s.

If they were to join forces, it would be a good choice.

Qin Yu shook his head and quickly dispelled this thought.

If they were to join forces, it would be a disaster for Li Prefecture.

“Today, all of you will die here. Just the two of you won’t be able to escape.”Sima bei said coldly.

“What if I’m included?”

At this moment, another cold voice sounded.

Turning his head, he saw a tall figure walking over from not far away.

His footsteps were extremely steady, and every step he took seemed to shake the earth!

“Xiao Hai!”

Seeing this person, Sima bei was completely unable to remain calm! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Wasn’t he at the northern border? Why would he suddenly come here! !

“It’s Xiao Hai!”

Someone exclaimed!

“Three maniacs, three ultimate, and one legend. We actually gathered all of them today!”

Although the others didn’t come, these three people were enough to rule the entire southern region! Perhaps even the heavenly cloud sect would be afraid!

“Big Brother Xiao Hai.”Qu Zhu greeted Xiao Hai.

Xiao Hai nodded slightly and then looked coldly at Sima Bei and the others in front of him.

“How dare you barge in here.”Xiao Hai’s tone was extremely cold.

At this moment, Sima bei immediately had the intention to retreat.

The three of them working together was definitely not something that Sima bei and the others could contend against!

“Xiao Hai, why are you here?”Sima bei asked coldly.

Xiao Hai laughed loudly and said, “Do I have to tell you where I’m Going? !”

Sima bei gritted his teeth and was extremely furious in his heart!

His own plan had been completely disrupted.

“Today is your Lucky Day...”Sima Bei said coldly.

“But let me tell you, the northern lands will never give up. You better be careful...”

As they spoke, Sima Bei and the others began to disappear into the darkness.

“Where do you think you’re going!”Jue Wu was furious. Just as she was about to give chase, she was stopped by Xiao Hai.

“There’s no need to give chase. We won’t be able to catch up.”Xiao Hai shook his head.

After hearing Xiao Hai’s words, Jue Wu finally gave up.

Sima bei and the others’bodies slowly disappeared into the darkness. Very quickly, they disappeared without a trace.

“This bunch of bastards, they actually set their sights on us!”Jue Wu could not help but feel a little angry.

As someone who stood at the top-notch martial artist in the southern region, when had he ever been schemed against like this? !

Qu Zhu, who was standing at the side, said jokingly, “Alright, you should be content. The people who killed you were all top-notch martial artists from the northern lands. They were sent to look for me, and they weren’t even qualified.”

As he spoke, the few of them began to laugh.

Following that, Xiao Hai looked at the crowd, cupped his hands, and said, “Thank you all for saving us. We will definitely remember this favor.”

The surrounding crowd felt a little embarrassed, but they were also very grateful.

It was not easy for such a big shot to be so humble.

“Big Brother Xiao Hai, aren’t you at the northern border?”Qu Zhu asked.

Xiao Hai waved his hand and said, “Let’s Find a place to sit first. Let’s chat slowly.”

“Okay!”

The group of people immediately planned to leave.

Qin Yu bent down and looked at the people who were preparing to ambush him. He frowned and said, “I wonder who they are.”

Jue Wu ran forward and tore off the masks on their faces, revealing one face after another.

“Zhu Qi?”

At this moment, qu Zhu frowned slightly.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Zhu and said, “Big Brother Qu Zhu, do you know him?”

Qu Zhu grunted in gratitude and said, “This person was quite famous in the South Province back then. Later on, he went into seclusion. If I remember correctly, he should be a guest elder of the Tianyun sect now.”

“Tianyun sect? !”A trace of anger flashed across Jue Wu’s face.

Qin Yu’s eyes couldn’t help but narrow slightly.

“I didn’t expect that he was sent by the Tianyun sect.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

It seemed that he had to put an end to the relationship between him and the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“At a time like this, the Heavenly Cloud sect is still haggling over personal grudges.”Xiao Hai was also a little displeased.

“Let’s go to the heavenly cloud sect and ask them clearly!”Jue Wu said with a sullen face.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “There’s no need. This is a matter between me and the Heavenly Cloud sect. I will settle it myself.”

“Settle it yourself, my ass! They’ve already done this to this extent. There’s no need to give them any face,”Jue Wu said angrily.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Just as Big Brother Xiao Hai said, now is not the time to care about these things. As the peak of the southern region, all of you should be united against the outside world.”

“As for the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s matter, I can handle it properly myself.”

Qu Zhu, who was by the side, also nodded and said, “Qin Yu is right. If I go to the Heavenly Cloud sect, it will mean that the few of us will declare war against the Heavenly Cloud sect. The people of the northern lands would most likely want to see this scene.”
