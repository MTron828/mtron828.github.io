Chapter 950: Chapter 950, the power of blood fusion

In the face of the arrogant Tian Xuehong, Gu Xinghe could not contain his anger.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Tian Xuehong, you underestimate the Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Do you really think that with your skeleton army, you can pose a threat to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association?”

Tian xuehong laughed and said, “You want to talk about the eight higher-ups of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, Right?”

Gu Xinghe frowned slightly.

It was obvious that Tian Xuehong was right.

Tian xuehong sneered, “Don’t forget who I am, Kid. I know more things than you!”

“If those eight higher-ups could come out, how could it be your turn to strut around?”

Gu Xinghe’s expression was a little ugly, and he didn’t say anything for a while.

Tian Xuehong patted Gu Xinghe’s shoulder and said, “It’s useless to keep those prisoners anyway. Why Don’t you let me handle them? It Won’t do you any harm.”

“In return, I can give you a thousand spiritual stones.”

Gu Xinghe was silent for a moment before saying, “Give me a few days to think about it. I have to discuss such a big matter.”

Tian Xuehong nodded slightly and said, “Okay, I’ll give you a week at most.”

After saying this, Tian Xuehong turned around and walked out.

At this time, Zhai Xing walked in quickly.

He said in a deep voice, “This matter... we definitely can’t agree to it!”

Gu Xinghe glanced at Zhai Xing but didn’t say anything.

...

In the prison.

Seeing Qin Yu’s pained expression, the prisoners began to chat with Qin Yu, trying to divert their attention so as to alleviate the pain.

They talked about their past and told their own jokes.

It had to be said that it really did have some effect.

Qin Yu raised his head with difficulty and said with a smile, “Thank you, everyone...”

“No need to thank me. When Miss Yan was locked up, we also saw it with our own eyes.”

“Shut up! Don’t mention it!”Someone berated him.

The prisoner immediately covered his mouth like a child who had made a mistake.

Qin Yu looked up at the tubes. He tried to struggle but failed.

“If I can recover to my peak condition, I might be able to break free...”Qin Yu thought to himself.

However, the environment here was too terrible. It would take a long time to recover.

The next morning.

Gu Xinghe and Yan Jinyao walked in from outside.

“It’s about time,”Gu Xinghe said.

Yan Jinyao nodded slightly and said, “This blood is enough.”

Then, he raised his head to look at the extremely weak Qin Yu and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, don’t worry. If it’s really useful, I will definitely tell you.”

Although Qin Yu was angry, he couldn’t do anything to him.

The few of them took Qin Yu’s blood and then went to a room in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

Then, they put the blood into a bathtub. Yan Jinyao took off his clothes and slowly lay in it.

He opened the pores all over his body and tried his best to absorb Qin Yu’s blood.

Perhaps it was because he had Yan Ruoxue’s blood in his body, but Qin Yu’s blood was rushing into Yan Jinyao’s body.

“Sizzle...”

White gas was emitted from Yan Jinyao’s body.

The two kinds of blood seemed to merge in Yan Jinyao’s body!

“AH...”

Yan Jinyao groaned.

It was unknown whether it was pain or pleasure.

As the blood was absorbed, Yan Jinyao’s body was changing rapidly!

His body was covered with a layer of golden light in an instant, and his body became indestructible!

And the power of his bloodline was enhanced again at this moment!

“Chi la!”

At the moment when all the blood was absorbed, Yan Jinyao’s body emitted a ray of light!

This ray of light was pure white and holy, like a god, making people unable to resist worshipping it!

Even Gu Xinghe was affected, his body slightly trembling!

“Awesome... Awesome!”

Yan Jinyao roared, a terrifying power instantly emitted from his body!

Even Gu Xinghe was forced to retreat!

“Such a powerful force... This kind of pressure, what’s going on...”Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice.

He raised his head to look at Yan Jinyao and asked with a knowing tone, “Young Master Yan, how do you feel?”

Yan Jinyao glanced at Gu Xinghe and sneered, “Good, never better! I really didn’t expect that Qin Yu’s bloodline... could have such a magical effect. It seems that my guess is correct...”

At this point, Yan Jinyao looked at Gu Xinghe and said, “Young Master Gu, please find me a martial saint.”

“Martial Saint?”Gu Xinghe frowned slightly.

“Don’t tell me you want to challenge a martial saint too?”

Yan jinyao sneered, “Not a challenge, but... killing a saint! I can definitely do what Qin Yu failed to do!”

“The fusion of these two bloodlines has made my strength reach an unpredictable level. hahahaha!”

Looking at Yan Jinyao’s excited look, Gu Xinghe also made up his mind: Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

I should inject Qin Yu’s blood into my body!

After all, my body was once irrigated by Yan Ruoxue’s blood.

...

Two days later, Gu Xinghe took Qin Yu’s blood.

He imitated Yan Jinyao and started to absorb Qin Yu’s blood.

Unfortunately, Qin Yu’s blood didn’t move after he laid down.

“How could this be?”Gu Xinghe frowned immediately.

“Could there be a problem with the method?”

Long brows at the side said in a deep voice, “Could it be because of the bloodline in your body?”

“What do you mean?”Gu Xinghe frowned.

Long brows said, “Yan Jinyao and Yan Ruoxue are both members of the Yan family after all, and... Yan Jinyao’s bloodline awakening has reached 80% !”

“But your bloodline seems to be less than 30% , so you can’t fuse with Qin Yu’s Bloodline?”

Hearing this, Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but say angrily, “Isn’t that f * cking a wedding dress for Yan Jinyao! In this world, only he, Yan Jinyao, has reached 80% !”

Even so, Gu Xinghe was still unwilling.

He lay in the Bath and tried countless methods, but he still couldn’t fuse with Qin Yu’s blood.
