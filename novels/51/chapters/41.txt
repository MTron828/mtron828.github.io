Zhao Gang stared blankly at the car door that had been pulled down and couldn’t help but swallow hard.

Was he even human? He had actually pulled the car door down?

While he was still in shock, Qin Yu had already reached out and pulled him out.

“Qin... Qin Yu, take it easy. I was just joking with you...” Zhao Gang said with an embarrassed smile.

He had seen Qin Yu break Shen Tian’s arm with his own eyes!

Seeing him like this, Qin Yu sneered and said, “I won’t make things difficult for you. I’ll give you a slap as a lesson.”

After saying that, Qin Yu stretched out his hand and slapped his face.

Although Qin Yu went easy on him with the slap, it still made half of Zhao Gang’s face swell up.

“Move the car away quickly,” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

Although Zhao Gang was angry deep down, he didn’t have the guts to say anything. He could only suppress his anger and move the car to the side.

After Qin Yu left, Zhao Gang angrily scolded, “Who do you think you are? If Yan Ruoxue leaves Jiangcheng, you’ll be a laughing stock to everyone!”

Then, Zhao Gang couldn’t help but lament, “When will Yan Ruoxue leave...”

Although Yan Ruoxue had kept a low profile recently, she gave everyone immense pressure and kept them on edge.

Even the Shen family didn’t have the guts to cross her.

The car drove all the way to the Du family’s home.

As the richest family in Jiangcheng, the Du family was naturally wealthy, and the house they lived in was extremely luxurious.

However, as soon as Qin Yu entered the Du family’s front door, he felt a chilly atmosphere.

“Huh?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

The entire Du family seemed to be surrounded by an ominous aura.

“Mr. Qin, what’s wrong?” Du Yuan asked. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Nothing.”

After the car was parked, the two of them walked into the living room.

“Mr. Qin, please wait for a moment. I’ll go call my dad,” Du Yuan said politely.

He ordered a servant to pour a glass of water for Qin Yu and hurried upstairs.

A few minutes later, Du Yuan and his father, Du Hengsheng, came down.

An old man with a white beard followed them.

“Mr. Qin.” Du Hengsheng walked up quickly and shook hands with Qin Yu.

Qin Yu looked at Du Hengsheng and couldn’t help but frown.

Du Hengsheng’s expression was pale, his lips were purplish, and his temples were dark. He looked very ill.

Most importantly, Qin Yu couldn’t feel any sense of vitality from him.

“Are you not feeling well, Mr. Du?” Qin Yu asked casually.

Du Hengsheng sighed and forced a smile. “Yes, I’ve been experiencing all sorts of troubles lately.”

“Dad, Mr. Qin is also a doctor. You can ask him to examine you,” Du Yuan said quickly.

Du Hengsheng waved his hand and said, “I’m not sick...”

At this point, Du Hengsheng said apologetically, “Mr. Qin, if you’re not busy, can you wait for a moment?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s okay. You may go ahead.”

“Thank you.” Du Hengsheng nodded quickly.

Then, he looked at the old man in white beside him and said, “Lu Sr., thank you for your trouble.”

The old man who was called Lu Sr. smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I have found the problem.”

Du Hengsheng was immediately delighted and quickly said, “Please explain, Lu Sr.!”

Lu Sr. said calmly, “You have been in poor health recently. You consulted many doctors without avail. This is caused by Feng Shui.”

“Mr. Du, go to the west wall of the bedroom now and see if there are any sharp objects,” Lu Sr. continued to say.

Du Hengsheng didn’t delay and hurriedly walked in the direction that Lu Sr. had told him to.

A few minutes later, Du Hengsheng came back with a broken vase.

“There really are! This vase has been in the cabinet the whole time. I don’t know how it broke,” Du Hengsheng said with some shock.

Lu Sr. laughed and said, “This is the crux of the problem. Having a broken object in the house is a big taboo.”

Du Hengsheng reached out and held Lu Sr.’s hand. He said excitedly, “Thank you, Lu Sr.. You are indeed a Feng Shui Master!”

Lu Sr. took out some coins and handed them to Du Hengsheng. He smiled and said, “Hang this in the position just now. Remember, take it down and bury it three days later. I guarantee that your health will be restored.”

“You have enlightened me, Lu Sr.. Thank you, Lu Sr.!” Du Hengsheng looked excited.

“I don’t think this is the crux of the problem,” at this moment, Qin Yu suddenly said.

As soon as he said this, things immediately became a bit awkward.

Lu Sr.’s expression darkened. He was extremely dissatisfied with Qin Yu’s interruption.

“Mr. Qin, Lu Sr. is a famous Feng Shui master in Jiangcheng. His words are trustworthy,” Du Hengsheng hurriedly tried to smooth things over.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Lu Sr., I don’t mean to disrespect you. It’s just that... This vase is definitely not the key to the problem.”

Lu Sr. said unhappily, “Who are you?”

“Lu Sr., this is Qin Yu, Miss Yan’s man,” Du Hengsheng said quickly.

However, Lu Sr. didn’t show him any respect at all. He said coldly, “No matter who he is, he can’t just spout nonsense!”

Qin Yu shook his head helplessly and said, “Lu Sr., I’m definitely not spouting nonsense. Everything I said is true.”

Du Hengsheng was a little unhappy about this.

However, he had a favor to ask from Qin Yu, so he didn’t have the guts to lose his temper.

“Mr. Qin, you don’t know Feng Shui. Lu Sr. is the master in this aspect,” Du Hengsheng tried his best to remain polite.

Lu Sr. waved his hand. He glanced coldly at Qin Yu and said, “You said that this vase isn’t the key to the problem. Then I’d like to hear your brilliant theory!”

Qin Yu didn’t stand on ceremony. He pointed to the courtyard outside and said, “The real problem is in the courtyard.”

After saying that, Qin Yu stood up straight and strode into the courtyard.

Lu Sr. snorted and immediately followed him out.

“What’s wrong with Qin Yu?” Du Hengsheng couldn’t help but frown.

Du Yuan forced a smile and said, “Dad, maybe Mr. Qin really knows...”

“Understand my *ss! How can there be someone who is an expert in all aspects in this world?!” Du Hengsheng snorted coldly.

Even so, he still followed him out.

Qin Yu didn’t stop until he reached the center of the courtyard.

He raised his head to look at the sky, then stepped on the ground with his foot. Then he said, “The problem lies here.”

Hearing this, Lu Sr. couldn’t help but laugh. “Young man, do you know Feng Shui or not? What problem can there be here?”

“I don’t know anything about Feng Shui,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“But I do know mystical arts.”

After that, Qin Yu looked at Du Hengsheng and said, “Mr. Du, find someone to dig from here.”

Du Hengsheng said awkwardly, “Mr. Qin, I don’t think there’s a need for that, right?”

“Dig. Trust me,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

Du Hengsheng had no choice but to wave his hand and call a few people over.

“Then... how many feet should we dig?” Du Hengsheng asked tentatively.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I don’t know either. Dig until you find something.”
