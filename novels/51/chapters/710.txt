Qin Yu raised his eyebrows, and a trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.

“Is what you said true?” Qin Yu stared at Su Qian.

If Hong Yi Sect was really willing to take out a stalk of ten-thousand-year-old herbs, it would really make him feel conflicted.

Su Qian shook her head and said, “I didn’t bring the herbs, but Mr. Ning asked me to bring you a piece of news.”

“A piece of news?” Qin Yu’s frown deepened.

Su Qian continued to say, “This piece of news involves ten thousand year old herbs. One month later, a ten thousand year old herb will be born.”

As he said that, Su Qian took out her phone.

On the map on his phone, there was a location marked.

And this location was in the southwest direction of Pyro.

Qin Yu stared at the location and asked, “The ten thousand year old herbs will be born here?”

Su Qian nodded and said, “That’s right. The news hasn’t spread yet and not many people know about it.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh coldly and said, “Not many people know about it now because it is still early from the birth of the herbs. Who knows how many people have already made plans behind the scenes.”

Su Qian spread her hands and said, “This is the best that the Hong Yi Sect can afford to do.”

Qin Yu said jokingly, “It seems that the resources of the Hong Yi Sect are only so-so.”

Su Qian didn’t say anything about this.

Qin Yu silently remembered this position and said, “Alright, I should go back. As for this ten-thousand-year-old herbs, I’ll go and try it out.”

“Mr. Qin, you have to be careful. The appearance of the ten-thousand-year-old herbs will definitely attract the attention of various powers,” Su Qian reminded.

“This power isn’t limited to the aristocratic families in the country. It may also attract foreign powers and many old monsters who have yet to appear.”

Qin Yu casually said, “Since you know about it, you still want me to go and retrieve it myself? I suspect that you’re using me as a tool.”

Su Qian smiled bitterly and said, “That’s impossible, Mr. Qin. It’s just that it’s inconvenient for us to move around in the country. However, I believe that they will secretly help you.”

Qin Yu didn’t continue this topic.

He and Su Qian parted ways.

Qin Yu couldn’t completely trust the Hong Yi Sect.

After they threw out such an important piece of news, it made Qin Yu even more suspicious of the Hong Yi Sect’s goal.

When Qin Yu rushed back to the Green Moon Villa, it was already the next morning.

The first thing he did when he came back was to run into Xiao Yu’s room.

At this time, Xiao Yu was still sleeping soundly. Qin Yu’s intrusion immediately gave Xiao Yu a fright.

She hurriedly hugged the blanket and covered her chest. She cried out in alarm, “You... What are you doing? Pervert, hurry up and get out!”

Seeing that Xiao Yu was fine, Qin Yu also let out a sigh of relief.

He teased, “With your figure, even if you don’t cover it, I won’t be able to see anything.”

After saying this, Qin Yu hurriedly ran out to avoid Xiao Yu’s anger.

At this moment, in Jingdu.

For a moment, the martial arts academy had officially opened, and there were countless people who came to register.

This time, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association announced to the outside world that they didn’t select people according to their status, as long as they had talent.

This seemingly selfless display actually concealed their selfish motives.

As a result, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association only needed to pay a small amount of resources, and they could plunder most of the genius disciples in the world! They continued to expand the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s ranks!

Qin Yu could see through their intentions, and so could the higher-ups.

However, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association had existed for too many years, and it had an extremely powerful power in the martial arts world.

Thus, even the authorities weren’t willing to discipline them.

Everything was proceeding according to schedule, and the talented disciples of the various aristocratic families also began to join the academy.

At this moment, in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, a hunchbacked old woman was standing in the square in the dark.

In front of her stood a total of eighteen black-gold robe powerhouses!

“Granny Qin, why have you summoned us?” Someone asked.

A trace of viciousness flashed through the eyes of the old woman called Granny Qin.

She took a deep breath and said through gritted teeth, “My Heaven Swallowing Python was severely injured by Qin Yu and still hasn’t completely recovered...”

Granny Qin was furious when she mentioned this!

The black-gold robe powerhouses looked at each other, and a hint of awkwardness flashed in their eyes.

With their current strength, they could no longer threaten Qin Yu. Other than the purple robe powerhouses, no one dared to provoke Qin Yu.

“We... We will take revenge for the Heaven Swallowing Python.” The black-gold robe powerhouses braced themselves and said.

A hint of viciousness flashed in Granny Qin’s eyes. She narrowed her eyes and said, “Are you really willing to take revenge for the Heaven Swallowing Python?”

“Absolutely!” The eighteen people said one after another.

“Alright, then I’ll give you a chance to show off.” Granny Qin waved her hand, and the huge Heaven Swallowing Python instantly appeared behind Granny Qin!

The Heaven Swallowing Python spat out its scarlet tongue, and a pungent smell assailed their nostrils.

Its dark flesh shone brilliantly under the sunlight, and it was incomparably fierce.

However, if one looked carefully, one could see a huge wound on its body.

This wound was left by a punch.

Seeing this Heaven Swallowing Python, many of the black-gold robe powerhouses were a little afraid. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Granny Qin, what... What do you need us to do?” One of the black-gold robe powerhouses asked tentatively.

Granny Qin opened her mouth and said, “There’s no need to do anything. You just need to stand there and don’t move...”

As soon as she finished speaking, the Heaven Swallowing Python shot towards everyone!

That huge head appeared in front of everyone in the blink of an eye!

The Heaven Swallowing Python opened its mouth and swallowed the black-gold robe powerhouses one by one!

Seeing this scene, all the black-gold robe powerhouses turned pale with fright and started to run!

“You want to run?” Granny Qin sneered.

She stretched out her skinny palm and the black-gold robe powerhouses were immediately restrained and couldn’t move!

“Granny Qin, you... you actually want to kill us!”

“You vicious old woman!”

Granny Qin didn’t care at all in the face of everyone’s curses.

She sneered. “A bunch of useless trash. Becoming the food of the Heaven Swallowing Python is your final value.”

The eighteen black-gold robe powerhouses were all swallowed by the Heaven Swallowing Python!

At the same time, the enormous body of the Heaven Swallowing Python began to squirm. Internal qi was constantly brewing in its body!

In the next second, the body of the Heaven Swallowing Python suddenly burst out with a burst of extremely dazzling black light!

“Boom!”

A loud sound spread through half of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!

The body of the Heaven Swallowing Python suddenly became tougher, and its internal qi also became several times richer!

“You’ve finally broken through...” Granny Qin said with a smile and her hands behind her back.

At this moment, the Heaven Swallowing Python had officially stepped into the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm!

With such strength, as long as a Martial Saint didn’t appear, it was invincible in this world!

And the body of a demonic beast was much tougher than that of an ordinary cultivator!

“Babe, come, eat it.” Then, the old woman took out a jade-green pill from her hand.

This pill was like a night pearl, shining brightly in the old woman’s hand.

The Heaven Swallowing Python slowly stretched its head over and swallowed the pill.

“Buzz!”

As the pill entered its stomach, the body of the Heaven Swallowing Python immediately began to tremble violently!

Half a minute later, the Heaven Swallowing Python disappeared and was replaced by a young man!
