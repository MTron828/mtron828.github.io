Chapter 1016: Chapter 1,016, the current situation of Shengguo 

Then, Qin Yu looked around and said apologetically, “Senior Xiang, I’m really sorry for destroying your herbal field and valley. You can leave after I help you repair the valley.”

Xiang Danqing waved his hand and stopped Qin Yu.

He shook his head and said, “I’ve been in the mountains for too many years. I’ve lost contact with this world.”

“Ji Yuhong is right. I really couldn’t afford to lose back then, so I hid here.”

“Now, I can be considered to be relieved. So... I’ll take this opportunity to leave the Transformation Dragon Valley.”

Qin Yu and the pavilion master looked at Xiang Danqing with slight surprise.

Xiang Danqing teased, “When I go back, I’ll have to rely on the two of you to take care of me.”

“No Problem!”Qin Yu immediately patted his chest and said.

Pavilion Master could not help but laugh.

The feud between the two of them seemed to have been resolved at this moment.

“Since that’s the case, I won’t stay any longer,”Qin Yu said.

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at pavilion master and said, “I’ll take you to the Wan family’s Secret Realm Now and kill the Wan Gu Qiong first.”

Pavilion master waved her hand and stopped Qin Yu.

She shook her head and said, “Just as you said, now is not the time.”

“Although you are powerful, if you become the Public Enemy, it will be difficult for you to move forward.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “I can ignore their gazes, but I will not tolerate the harassment of the Wan Gu Qiong.”

“It doesn’t matter.”Pavilion master shook her head and said.

“He is just bluffing. He won’t cause any substantial damage to me.”

“But you are different. Your Path will never be limited to this. The future is still long. I don’t want you to be stabbed in the back.”

Qin Yu suddenly fell silent.

Pavilion master had helped him too much. Qin Yu would never forget this favor.

“I’ll listen to you.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“I believe I can’t wait too long.”

Pavilion master nodded and smiled. “I think so too.”

Thus, the three of them did not say anything more. After saying their goodbyes, they each left.

After leaving the Transformation Dragon Valley, Qin Yu went straight back to the Sheng Kingdom.

Now that he had become a martial saint, Qin Yu was no longer afraid of anyone.

Even if it was the number one person, Zhai Xing, Qin Yu was still not afraid.

At this moment, in the Sheng Kingdom, at the Heaven Gate.

Hua Zongxiong had successfully taken over the Heaven Gate and pulled all his subordinates to the Heaven Gate.

It was not an exaggeration to say that Hua Zongxiong’s arrival had made the heaven gate even more glorious.

He had reshuffled the cards of the Heaven Gate and replaced all the higher-ups with his own old generals.

What was shocking was that Hua Zongxiong had two martial saints under him! Including him, there were three martial saints!

This also made Hua Zongxiong’s position unshakable. He had even made all the new sects in Sheng country look up to him!

And Qin Yu’s escape at the critical moment was naturally criticized by people.

No one expected that not only did Qin Yu not fight back, he even chose to escape.

At the same time.

Qin Yu was on the way back.

On the plane, Qin Yu looked at the scenery outside the window, thinking about something.

A few hours later, Qin Yu successfully arrived in Shengguo.

He took a taxi from the road and went straight to the Heaven Gate.

On the way.

Qin Yu asked casually, “Master, what’s the situation in Shengguo Now? Who’s the King?”

The driver glanced at Qin Yu and said, “King? Shengguo is a place that doesn’t care about anything. How can there be a King?”

“If you want to survive here, you must have the protection of the sects. For example, our driver has the protection of the sects behind him. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to do it.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “In other words, there is no real leader in the current Sheng Kingdom?”

The driver sneered and said, “All the major sects want to be the king, but no one has the ability.”

Qin Yu pondered and said, “In other words, whoever becomes the number one among these sects can become the real leader of the Sheng Kingdom?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“More or less.”The driver waved his hand and said.

“But isn’t it important to be the king? It’s just a title. Even if one really stands at the peak, who would be willing to call themselves the king? Wouldn’t that be giving themselves trouble for Nothing?”

Qin Yu nodded slightly.

It had to be said that what the driver said made sense.

“From now on, your driver will be protected by our Heaven Gate,”Qin Yu said casually.

The driver rolled his eyes and said, “Forget it. The leader of Heaven Gate ran away that day. Who doesn’t Know?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel embarrassed.

He didn’t expect the news to spread so fast that even the driver knew about it.

The car soon arrived near Heaven Gate.

After getting off the car, the driver said, “Twenty thousand.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but open his mouth.

After chatting for a while, he didn’t expect the driver to still ask for more money.

Qin Yu didn’t argue with him. After giving him the money, he walked straight into Heaven Gate.

Inside the Heaven Gate.

Hua Zongxiong was holding a map.

This map was the map of the Sheng Kingdom.

He was drawing on the map as if he was planning his next move.

“With our current ability, it should not be too difficult to control the Sheng Kingdom,”Hua Zongxiong said in a low voice.

A martial saint beside him nodded and said, “There are not many martial saints in the Sheng Kingdom, but there are many quasi martial saints.”

“If we can seize the opportunity to take down all the major sects in the Sheng Kingdom now, this power will be enough to crush any force in the future.”

Hua zongxiong nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. Any sect needs strong new blood.”

Just as the two of them were planning, someone rushed in from outside the door.

“Sect leader, it’s bad! That... that Qin Yu is back!”

Hearing this, Hua Zongxiong couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows.

“He still dares to come back?”Hua Zongxiong’s expression was quite playful.

“That’s good too. Now is the time to establish his power. We’ll use him as a stepping stone.”

After saying this, Hua Zongxiong stood up and walked out of the hall in large strides.

On the square of the Heaven Gate, Qin Yu was standing there, quietly waiting for Hua Zongxiong.

The surrounding disciples of the Heaven Gate were all gathered around and discussing animatedly.

“Qin Yu? Didn’t he run away at the last minute? Why is he back?”

“Could it be that he still wants to take back the Heaven Gate? That Hua Zongxiong is a genuine martial saint!”

“There are three martial saints! Such strength is the best in the entire Sheng Nation!”

Qin Yu remained silent as he listened to the discussions around him. His heart did not waver at all.

He hoped that Hua Zongxiong’s fame would spread far and wide and that everyone would be afraid of him.

Because if that was the case, after Qin Yu killed Hua zongxiong, it would be easier for him to stir up a commotion and win over the hearts of the people.

“Hehe, a piece of trash who abandoned his sect and ran away actually dares to return.”

Right at this moment, Hua Zongxiong walked out with large strides.
