Chapter 248: Crushing! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When he heard this, Zhang Hua was also reminded.

The strength of Qin Yu’s physical body was indeed beyond his imagination.

Not to mention a mere second level Inner Strength Grandmaster, but even a third level Inner Strength Grandmaster wouldn’t be able to do it.

“How could this kid’s physical body be so strong to this extent?” Dong Tianhai’s expression was somewhat unsightly.

“Who knows?” The disciple didn’t think too much about it.

“Maybe he is a body refining master.”

Dong Tianhai shook his head and said in a low voice, “No matter how strong he is, he can’t be this strong. You have to know that Qin Yu is only an Inner Strength Master Hands!”

When he heard Dong Tianhai’s words, the disciple guessed something.

“Master, you mean... the Nine Transformation Golden Pill?” The disciple’s expression suddenly changed!

Dong Tianhai didn’t speak, but his meaning was very obvious.

It was very likely that Qin Yu had consumed the Nine Transformation Golden Pill and completed the first three transformations!

That was why his body was so hard to this extent!

“If that’s really the case, then I really am an idiot,” Dong Tianhai couldn’t help but think to himself.

Thinking of this, he suddenly looked at Wan Xin.

“Don’t you have a grudge with Qin Yu?” Dong Tianhai glanced at Wan Xin and said.

After seeing Qin Yu’s strength, how would Wan Xin dare to make a move?! He just wanted to escape!

But he had promised Dong Tianhai after all, so Wan Xin could only bite the bullet and say, “With so many top-notch martial artists present, there’s no need for us to make a move.”

Dong Tianhai, extremely dissatisfied with Wan Xin, snorted coldly.

“It was because I listened to your nonsense that I missed out on joining forces with Qin Yu!” Dong Tianhai said coldly.

Wan Xin opened his mouth, but was speechless.

“But it’s okay. If I really joined hands with Qin Yu, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to escape this disaster today.” When he thought of this, Dong Tianhai’s mood couldn’t help but ease a little.

Zhang Hua’s expression was ice-cold.

He didn’t dare to approach Qin Yu and could only stand hundreds of meters away.

“I’ve already seen through your move. Qin Yu, go to h*ll!” Zhang Hua gritted his teeth and said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Are you sure you’ve seen through it?”

“Cut the crap!” Zhang Hua roared angrily. His entire body surged with energy, and his mouth actually lit up with specks of light!

These specks of light were the purest form of internal qi, and the power contained within them was no less than that of a bomb!

The specks of light brewed in Zhang Hua’s mouth, and a terrifying internal qi instantly filled the entire area!

“As expected of a second level Inner Strength Grandmaster. Even with his mouth, he was able to unleash such power!” Someone in the distance couldn’t help but sigh!

“Whoosh!”

Zhang Hua spewed out with force, and in an instant, countless light spots headed straight for Qin Yu!

That terrifying internal qi caused one to feel a chill down their spine!

The people around Qin Yu, afraid that they would be caught in the crossfire, hurriedly retreated!

On the other hand, Qin Yu didn’t move at all. He just stood there and looked at Zhang Hua coldly!

“What is Qin Yu doing?” The people around couldn’t help but frown.

“He... He wants to use his physical body to resist!” Someone finally revealed Qin Yu’s intentions!

“Using his physical body to resist an Inner Strength Grandmaster’s attack? This is simply insane!”

“Bang Bang Bang!”

These densely packed light spots were like raindrops as they smashed towards Qin Yu!

However, what was shocking was that when the light spots touched Qin Yu, they were immediately shattered!

Then, they turned into a breeze and disappeared without a trace!

Only white spots were left on Qin Yu’s body! Even his skin was unscathed!

“How is this possible?!” Everyone gasped!

Even a body refining grandmaster wouldn’t be able to do such a thing!

“What a powerful body.” Fang Yue’s beautiful eyes were filled with shock!

Duan Shi, Jing Lu, and the others were even more dumbfounded!

“Mr. Qin is amazing!” Jiang Gu shouted out in excitement!

“How is this possible?!” Zhang Hua’s expression was extremely ugly, and his heart was filled with fear!

However, as an Inner Strength Grandmaster, he would never give up like this!

Just as he was preparing for the second round of attacks, Qin Yu took a step forward!

“You don’t have to pay for my house. I’ll treat it as burning paper money for you.” Qin Yu’s voice sounded terrifying, and Zhang Hua was horrified!

“Don’t let him get close!” Someone shouted!

When Zhang Hua heard this, he quickly reacted!

Wind immediately blew under his feet, and he hurriedly retreated!

Qin Yu sneered and said, “What, you want to run? Do you think you can escape?”

Qin Yu’s feet shook hard, and his body instantly shot toward Zhang Hua like a cannonball!

Zhang Hua seemed to have gone crazy as he desperately fled in the air.

Qin Yu was chasing behind him closely!

Upon seeing this chase, everyone couldn’t help but rub their eyes in disbelief.

Was this actually happening?

A second level Inner Strength Grandmaster was being chased and beaten by an Inner Strength Master Hands?

“I must be dreaming...” No one dared to believe that this was real.

In mid-air, Zhang Hua was still fleeing.

However, Qin Yu’s speed was extremely fast. If he continued to chase, Zhang Hua would definitely die!

This was because Qin Yu purely relied on the strength of his physical body, while Zhang Hua relied on his inner strength!

Once his inner strength dissipated, he would definitely be caught by Qin Yu!

“This can’t go on.” Zhang Hua thought to himself in distraught!

He looked down.

Unfortunately, no one planned to help him attack.

“These b*stards!” Zhang Hua couldn’t wait any longer!

As he fled, he used his mouth to condense his inner strength!

The terrifying inner strength almost covered Zhang Hua’s entire head.

It was obvious that Zhang Hua was planning to risk his life!

“Go to h*ll!”

At this moment, Zhang Hua suddenly roared and his mouth suddenly shot towards Qin Yu!

However, in the next second, Zhang Hua’s expression turned ashen!

Qin Yu approached him and took a step forward. His palm covered Zhang Hua’s mouth!

“It’s better for you to enjoy such a powerful spell yourself.” Qin Yu opened his mouth and sneered.

Zhang Hua was extremely terrified! He opened his eyes wide and tried to struggle, but he couldn’t break free at all!

“No... No!” Zhang Hua thought to himself in distraught!

Unfortunately, it was too late.

The huge light exploded when it touched Qin Yu’s palm!

“Okay, blow Qin Yu to death with you!” Han Yilong said through gritted teeth.

“Let’s perish together! Let’s perish together!” Han Yilong roared crazily!

“Boom!”

In the sky, it was as if a bomb had exploded.

The light that soared to the sky made it difficult for people to open their eyes for a moment.

“Is Qin Yu dead?” Someone anxiously shouted in the light.

“I don’t know.”

“Mr. Qin...” Only Jiang Gu had a worried expression!

He even forced his eyes open and looked at the sky.

Everything in the sky was peaceful.

Qin Yu’s body was already dyed red.

“Huh? What is going on?” Someone touched the corner of his mouth.

“F * ck, it’s flesh, human flesh!”

Then, countless people below vomited crazily!

Zhang Hua was blown into pieces!

Qin Yu was also slightly injured, but it wasn’t serious.

“How could Qin Yu be so powerful?!”

Han Yilong gritted his teeth!

Both of them were Inner Strength Master Hands, but they were worlds apart in terms of strength!

“Oh no!” Qin Yu, who was in the air, suddenly thought of something.

He slapped his head. He actually forgot about the Heaven Swallowing Technique!

“D*mn it, what a pity!” Qin Yu felt regretful!

Zhang Hua was a second-level Inner Strength Grandmaster. If he could swallow him, it would definitely help him advance!

“Let’s attack together and kill him!” At this moment, Han Yilong roared! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Qin Yu, so what if your physical body is strong? You’re only an Inner Strength Master Hands! Can you beat so many people?” Han Yilong said with a cold expression.

“That’s right! With just a strong physical body, it is impossible to beat us!” The others also shouted.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and a smile appeared on his face. He sneered and said, “Inner Strength Master Hands? Are you sure?”
