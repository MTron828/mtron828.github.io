Qin Yu looked at these three people in puzzlement, as if he felt that they were somewhat unfamiliar.

These three people hurriedly explained, “We all saw the process of you refining pills just now! You’re really too amazing!”

“Yeah, you even received an invitation from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. I really admire you!”

When he heard these three people’s words, Qin Yu came to a sudden realization.

Meanwhile, Dong Tianhai’s expression was stiff and extremely awkward.

Qin Yu had actually received an invitation from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion? How was this possible?

“The three of you, please deal with this kid!” Dong Tianhai said again.

The three people glanced at Dong Tianhai and said with a cold expression, “Dong Tianhai, are we very familiar with you?”

“That’s right. If you dare to talk nonsense again, we’ll deal with you first!”

“How dare you insult Mr. Qin?”

The three people knew very well that an apothecary of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was much more valuable than Dong Tianhai, a so-called King of Medicine!

“Mr. Qin, we’re sorry to disturb you. If there’s anything you need help with, please feel free to ask,” the three people said respectfully.

After saying this, the three people left together.

Qin Yu looked at Dong Tianhai with a sneer.

“Master Dong, you don’t seem that well-connected.” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

Dong Tianhai’s expression was extremely sulky. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, you’ve already taken the herbs. What else do you want?”

“Already taken?” Qin Yu snorted.

“Dong Tianhai, I’ve told you very clearly to deliver them to my door in three days! Unfortunately, you have broken your promise.”

With that, Qin Yu waved his hand and loaded all the herbs on Dong Tianhai’s stall into his Spatial Magic Artifact.

Dong Tianhai’s expression was ashen, and he was so angry that his entire body was trembling.

However, he couldn’t do anything to Qin Yu, and could only forcefully suppress his anger.

After receiving the herbs, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Looking at Qin Yu’s back, Dong Tianhai gnashed his teeth in hatred.

...

“Mr. Qin, we have really gained a lot from the Herbs Convention this time,” Yao Qing said proudly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “That’s right. It’s all thanks to Dong Tianhai. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have known about the Herbs Convention.”

This could be considered a blessing in disguise.

The Herbs Convention lasted until 12 o’clock in the evening.

Qin Yu and Yao Qing found a hotel and temporarily stayed there.

At night, Qin Yu opened his Spatial Magic Artifact and counted carefully.

There were three herbs that were five hundred years old, and ten herbs that were more than a hundred years old!

Such a huge number made Qin Yu extremely excited!

“I’m rich.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but smile.

He laid on the bed and even felt that he would probably have a beautiful dream that night.

At this moment, there was suddenly a knock on the door.

Qin Yu frowned and shouted, “Who is it?”

“Mr. Qin, it’s me.” Fang Yue’s charming voice came from outside the door.

“Fang Yue? Why is she here?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu still went over and opened the door.

Fang Yue was wearing a purple dress. Under the light, her figure looked very graceful.

“Miss Fang, why are you here?” Qin Yu asked.

Fang Yue didn’t answer this question. Instead, she said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, aren’t you going to invite me in?”

Qin Yu frowned, but in the end, he made a space for Fang Yue to come in.

Then, Qin Yu poured Fang Yue a glass of water and asked casually, “Miss Fang, why did you come to see me in the middle of the night?”

Fang Yue raised her face and looked at Qin Yu with her soul-stirring eyes.

“Can’t I come to see you if I have nothing to do?” Fang Yue blinked her eyes and said.

Qin Yu could feel the charming power emanating from her body.

And when she spoke, the power that attacked his mind was even stronger.

“Miss Fang, your seduction is useless against me,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

Fang Yue’s face flashed with surprise, because her seduction technique had never failed before!

Fang Yue was unwilling to give up. She stood up and moved her graceful body closer to Qin Yu step by step.

After sitting by Qin Yu’s side, Fang Yue leaned toward Qin Yu’s ear and said coquettishly, “Mr. Qin, are you really not tempted?”

As she spoke, Fang Yue reached out and touched Qin Yu’s chest.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu reached out and grabbed Fang Yue’s wrist.

A terrifying force erupted!

“Miss Fang, please have some self-respect. If you continue to be stubborn, don’t blame me for being impolite,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Fang Yue’s expression changed slightly. She sighed slightly and said, “Mr. Qin, you are the first one who can resist my charm.”

It was impossible to say that he was not tempted. After all, Qin Yu was also a man full of vigor and vitality.

However, deep in Qin Yu’s heart, there was someone else.

That person gave Qin Yu a strong will and the motivation to move forward bravely. It was enough to resist any temptation in the world.

“Miss Fang, if you have something to say, just say it. Otherwise, I’m going to sleep,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Seeing this, Fang Yue stopped teasing Qin Yu. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

She took out a jade-green bead from her bosom. Under the dim light, it flickered with a demonic light.

“Mr. Qin, I have a gift for you,” Fang Yue said with a smile.

Qin Yu took the bead and said in surprise, “What is this?”

“Take a guess,” Fang Yue teased with her beautiful eyes shining.

Qin Yu sized up the bead and said seriously, “If I’m not wrong, this... should be a glass marble.”

“Pfft!”

When she heard this, Fang Yue couldn’t help but laugh.

“Mr. Qin, do you think I came here in the middle of the night just to give you a glass bead?” Fang Yue said with a smile.

Of course, Qin Yu was joking. He played with the bead and asked, “What exactly is this?”

Only then did Fang Yue seriously say, “This is called an inner core. It comes from a demon beast at the bottom of the sea.”

“Inner core?” Qin Yu was stunned.

This was the first time Qin Yu heard this name.

Fang Yue nodded and said, “It is the demon beast inner core.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “You... Where did you get this?”

Speaking of this topic, Fang Yue recalled a memory.

She looked out of the window and slowly said, “Ten years ago, I was wandering on a deserted island and accidentally got it.”

“There were two pills in total, and one of them was already swallowed by me.”

When he heard this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but rub the inner core and said with a smile, “The charm on your body came from the inner core, right?”

“Mr. Qin, you’re right.” Fang Yue covered her mouth and said with a smile.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said, “This demonic beast’s inner core should be very precious, right? Why did you give it to me?”

Fang Yue said somewhat bitterly, “I’m just a woman with no powerful background. If I want to climb up, I have to rely on a man.”

“Before you, I thought of Jing Lu as the candidate, but now, I’ve changed my mind. You’re more suitable than him.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows. “Is this considered an investment? Cooperation?”

“You can think of it this way,” Fang Yue said with a smile.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly realized that Fang Yue and he were somewhat similar.

Both of them were people who wanted to change their current situation, but had no powerful background.

This was definitely a difficult path. For a woman like Fang Yue to be able to reach this point, she must have paid a huge price.

“Miss Fang, I still don’t understand,” Qin Yu said.

“If that’s the case, why didn’t you choose a young master from a large aristocratic family?”

Fang Yue raised her eyebrows and said, “Mr. Qin, even if I were to be dependent on a large aristocratic family, do you think I would be valued? In their eyes, I might just be a plaything that can be kicked out at any time.”

“Relatively speaking, investing in a potential stock is naturally a better choice. What if you become the head of a large aristocratic family in the future?”
