Chapter 1293: Chapter 1,293 had been found! 

Qin Yu had never seen the internal Qi of life before, but this aura gave him the exact opposite of the Twilight Qi!

From this, Qin Yu quickly concluded that this was the internal Qi of life!

“In other words, the flying spider has internal Qi of life...”Qin Yu suppressed the excitement in his heart as he quickly took out a container and collected all the internal Qi of life.

Qin Yu was in danger of fainting at any moment, so he could not quickly absorb the life energy, so he could only collect it temporarily.

After collecting all of the life energy in the flying spider’s body, Qin Yu was almost exhausted.

Sweat kept pouring out of his forehead, and he felt tired.

“No... I have to find a place to rest...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He quickly found a relatively safe bush and collapsed.

Qin Yu collapsed in the bush. His eyes became a little blurry and his vision became darker. He was on the verge of fainting.

However, he still forced himself to stay conscious.

At the same time.

The two hunters had already rushed back to the hunter organization.

They didn’t care about their serious injuries and quickly found Ling Yun.

“We Found Qin Yu.”The two of them didn’t waste any time and went straight to the point.

Ling Yun’s eyes lit up. He stood up and said, “Oh? Is that true?”

“It’s absolutely true! We saw him with our own eyes!”The two of them said excitedly.

Ling Yun’s eyes turned colder. He said coldly, “Bring me to him immediately.”

The two of them looked at each other as if they were worried.

“Young Master Ling, why don’t you give us the money first?”One of them asked.

Ling Yun said coldly, “When I find Qin Yu, I will naturally give you the money.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Why don’t you give it to us first?”The two of them smiled sheepishly.

Ling Yun raised his eyebrows and sneered. “Do you think I would care about a mere million?”

“A million dollars is nothing to you, but to us, it’s a huge sum of money.”The two of them refused to let go.

Ling Yun had no choice but to say, “I’ve already given the money to your hunter organization. When the matter is settled, you can go and ask them for it.”

The two of them smiled bitterly. “I’m most worried that you’ve given the money to Jing Bai. Given Jing Bai’s temper, he might withhold the money from us.”

“So... you should just give us the money directly.”

Ling Yun frowned. After hesitating for half a second, he finally took out the money and gave the two of them a million dollars.

After paying, Ling Yun said with a dark expression, “Bring me there immediately.”

“No Problem!”

After receiving the money, they didn’t waste any time. They immediately brought Ling Yun and the almighty beside him towards the Green Rock Forest.

At this moment, Qin Yu was lying in the grass, slowly recovering his divine sense.

Fortunately, this faint feeling was slowly disappearing and didn’t cause any other consequences.

After an unknown period of time, Qin Yu was finally able to move.

He stood up from the ground, rubbed his forehead, and shook his head.

“Damn, it’s still very uncomfortable,”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

“Fortunately, I got the life qi. It’s a blessing in disguise.”

Thinking of the Life Qi, Qin Yu was a little excited.

He couldn’t wait to take out the life Qi that he had collected from the spatial magic artifact, and said in a low voice, “As long as I absorb the life Qi, my lost spiritual power will come back.”

During this time without spiritual power, it was very inconvenient to do anything.

He couldn’t even use the purple spiritual fire that he was so proud of.

Just as Qin Yu was about to absorb the life force, a few figures suddenly approached him from the shadows.

They were none other than Ling Yun and his group!

“Look, Young Master Ling, Qin Yu is right there!”The two of them shouted as they pointed at Qin Yu’s figure.

Ling Yun didn’t waste any time. He snorted coldly and immediately brought his men over to Qin Yu.

Even though Qin Yu had lost his spiritual energy, he was still extremely sensitive to danger.

He turned around abruptly and looked at Ling Yun and the others.

“Qin Yu, you sure know how to hide,”Ling Yun said coldly.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically! He looked at the two hunters beside him and instantly understood.

“I saved you guys, and you guys went to inform on Me?”Qin Yu’s expression couldn’t help but turn cold.

The two of them smiled sheepishly. “Qin Yu, Don’t blame us. Young Master Ling’s price is too high. That’s a million dollars!”

“That’s right. A million dollars is an astronomical figure to us. We don’t have your abilities, so please forgive us.”

Qin Yu’s face turned even colder. He couldn’t help but sneer. “This holy region has really taught me lesson after lesson... But do you think Ling Yun will let you off?”

The two of them frowned slightly when they heard this.

“What do you mean?”They looked at Ling Yun subconsciously.

A strange smile appeared on Ling Yun’s face.

“Qin Yu, you know too much,”Ling Yun said calmly.

The two of them panicked immediately. They looked at Ling Yun in horror and asked in a trembling voice, “You... What do you mean?”

Ling Yun sneered. “What do you mean? I’m sending you on your way, of course.”

“You... You’re not a F * cking human!”The two men’s expressions changed drastically. After saying that, they turned around to run.

However, with their abilities, how could they escape from Ling Yun’s demonic claws.

Ling Yun extended his palm and a shadow instantly grabbed the two men’s heads.

“Kacha!”

After a crisp sound, the heads of the two men were crushed by Ling Yun!

“Two mere ants, and you dare to negotiate with me?”Ling Yun said with a smile that wasn’t a smile.

His hands were stained with blood, making him look like a devil.

“You’re so young, but you’re so vicious. If you really grow up, who knows how vicious you’ll Be,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Ling Yun laughed out loud. “You’re just a piece of meat on a chopping board. Do you think you have the right to spout nonsense in front of me?”

“Alright, it’s your turn now, Qin Yu.”Ling Yun looked at Qin Yu coldly as he walked over step by step.
