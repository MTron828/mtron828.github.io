2494 The Holy Lord’s Set-Up

The black thing was instantly squeezed deeper into his body, even though a vast amount of dragon blood had diluted it.

However, wherever it passed, the muscles, meridians, and body would completely wither without a single bit of life force remaining.

“What’s this thing? It’s so terrifying!”

Qin Yu felt a chill run down his spine.

“It’s the poison Holy Lord extracted from the source of life using the Heart of the Ocean. Water is the source of life for all living things, and all living beings are born from water. Gu Ning spent most of her time on her cultivation journey to extract the poison from the source. How terrifying is the poison extracted from the source!”

Saintess Gu smiled grimly. At this moment, she slightly breathed a sigh of relief.

The power of the dragon breath also destroyed the vitality in her body. Even if Qin Yu had injected a terrifying amount of medicinal qi, he could not stop it from passing.

“I’m sorry, Qin Yu. I didn’t want this to happen. I didn’t know the family head’s plan.”

Saintess Gu raised her head and looked at Qin Yu.

“Don’t say anymore. I believe you.”

“Qin Yu, do you still remember when we were in the Gu family’s sanctum? I chose to be on the same path as you. Actually, I don’t know the reason either. Maybe it’s because I’ve investigated your experience before. Qin Yu, can you hug me? I’m so cold…”

Qin Yu gently picked up her somewhat weak body, and her pale face blushed.

Saintess Gu raised her head slightly with difficulty, and her lips gently touched Qin Yu’s cheek.

The temperature of her body suddenly rose tremendously, as if this last action had exhausted all of Saintess Gu’s spiritual energy.

The dragon breath destroyed the body of Saintess Gu, who had lost her spiritual energy to resist it.

Qin Yu reached to grab her but did not catch anything.

His heart was empty as if he had lost something.

Azure Dragon’s body also smashed onto the ground at this moment.

The head of the terrifying divine beasts had already exhausted all his strength fighting against the source of the poison at this point.

Although the source of the poison did not take his life, its internal qi had become extremely bleak and failed to recover in a short period.

…

Outside the temple, Teng Zixu looked infuriated.

Xiao Sheng from the demon race was before him.

“Get out of the way. You’re not my target for this trip.”

Teng Zixu said coldly.

“You should know that I have gained something from this battle. Today, I will send you off.”

Xiao Sheng looked at Teng Zixu indifferently and did not bother to talk nonsense.

He unleashed the Heaven and Earth Fist the moment he attacked. Teng Zixu looked solemn.

They had fought several times before but among the human race.

This time, he entered the Azure Rock Forest because he discovered Qin Yu had suddenly disappeared from Human Race Watch.

Moreover, Revered Qi had previously given the highest order to keep an eye on Qin Yu’s every move.

If Qin Yu had left normally, he might not have been alerted. However, Qin Yu’s secretive departure method raised suspicions, making him wonder if Qin Yu wanted to join the demon race.

He opened his eyes slightly.

While suppressing his messy thoughts, his body burst with mountain-like saber energy and then clashed with Xiao Sheng.

…

In the depths of the temple, within the numerous streams of water.

A drop of unremarkable water vapor was constantly shuttling through them.

The water droplets sank into the underground water and evaporated into the steam in the air, becoming a part of the clouds in the sky.

It then fell into the river along with the raindrops and washed away into the distance.

“As expected of a water supreme treasure, the Heart of the Ocean. I’ve been searching so long before I found a trace of it. I would probably not have noticed if you had been more stable.”

A giant hand suddenly grabbed and seized the entire space.

A drop of water vapor slowly flowed and appeared on Gu Ning’s body.

“As expected of an existence that has surpassed the fifth level. Even though I have unleashed this celestial artifact with all my might, you can still sense it.”

Gu Ning looked indifferent, but her voice was calm as if she had already expected this.

“But this extent is enough.”

The pupils of Immortal Crane moved slightly, and the air seemed to freeze in an instant.

Gu Ning’s body could not move at all. This was the pressure of the supreme existence.

It was completely beyond imagination. Even the power of the fifth level would be tremendously small and powerless in front of this kind of strength.

The Heart of the Ocean released a massive water curtain but flattened instantly.

“The source of poison, the rain of cleansing.

“This rain is my gift to your demon race on behalf of Baiyi.”

Gu Ning put her hands together, and a black water source surged from the top of her head.

In less than a breath, a black rain fell on the demon race’s land.

Immortal Crane’s expression suddenly changed. In the rain, he smelled something that made him uneasy.

This place was the deepest place of the demon race. The rain that carried the source of the poison fell.

It would spread out, and the foundation of the demon race would suffer severe damage. This was Gu Ning’s plan to destroy the future foundation of the demon race.

Even Immortal Crane could feel some lingering fear.

If this source of poison spread from the core mountain range of the demon race, the Azure Rock Forest of the demon race would probably become a land of death.

The eyes of Immortal Crane moved, and nine halos appeared in his pupils. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In the space where his gaze reached, the speed of time and space seemed to have changed. It had changed to different rules of time.

In that space, time began to slow down, stop, and even start to reverse.

Massive black mists slowly separated from the river before rising straight into the dark clouds.

Finally, it landed on Gu Ning’s body.

He looked around, and all the flowing rivers seemed to have returned to their original clarity.

“What a terrifying poison! It can’t be removed completely even if time is reversed.”

Immortal Crane’s body moved. His movement was as light as the wind, and his actions were swift and smooth, like a dancing dragon.

In an instant, he appeared in front of Gu Ning and struck her chest with his palm.

The source of the poison directly exploded in her body, and in an instant, her body was corroded to the point where not even her soul remained.

The Holy Lord of the Gu family could not even last one round against Immortal Crane.

The Heart of the Ocean suddenly lit up, bursting with a gorgeous blue light.

In the blink of an eye, it disappeared before Immortal Crane like a stream of light.

“You’ve retained so much power of the celestial artifacts. What other tricks do you have, Holy Lord Gu?”

Immortal Crane lightly snorted and charged toward the Heart of the Ocean.

He frowned slightly. At this moment, the Heart of the Ocean still retained a dense source of poison.

It still had tremendous strength, and Gu Ning seemed still to have a part of her soul power controlling the Heart of the Ocean.

Immortal Crane did not want to come into contact with the source of the poison. Even if he came into contact with it, it would take some effort to deal with it.
