Chapter 602: The Sorrowful and Indignant Chang Mang Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The atmosphere between the two sides immediately became tense.

Chang Mang not only scolded Yan Jinyao, but almost everyone in Jingdu’s upper class.

Yan Jinyao looked coldly at Chang Mang and said, “I think you’re looking for death. Qin Yu is already dead, so what right do you have to be arrogant?”

Chang Mang shouted, “Do you think I’m afraid of you?! Number one? I think it’s just an empty title!”

“You don’t know your place!” Yan Jinyao was furious. He raised his hand and a powerful internal qi rushed toward Chang Mang!

“I’m not afraid of you!” Chang Mang wasn’t worried at all. His internal qi burst out and he met the attack head-on!

“Clang!”

A loud sound reverberated throughout the entire hall!

Chang Mang took three steps back, and his fist felt waves of pain.

“You’re quite impressive, mommy’s boy!” Chang Mang shook his fist and said coldly.

Yan Jinyao narrowed his eyes and said, “You foul-mouthed thing. If I don’t teach you a lesson, you won’t know what reverence is!”

After saying that, Yan Jinyao stepped forward again.

However, at this moment, Yan Guiyi stood between the two of them.

He said coldly. “This is the Immortal Slaying Sect. Aren’t you afraid of waking up some living beings by fighting like this?”

“You want to die, but we don’t want to die.”

Yan Jinyao glanced at Yan Guiyi and snorted. “I’ll spare your life for now.”

“Bah! Go home and find your mommy!” Chang Mang said sarcastically.

The conflict was settled for now, but Yan Guiyi knew that the two sides would definitely fight to the death.

Putting aside whether or not there would be any treasures in the hall, just the inner cores at the door were enough to drive everyone crazy.

“It’s time to get rid of these people,” Yan Guiyi said coldly.

He glanced at He Teng, and He Teng immediately understood Yan Guiyi’s meaning.

A black light suddenly appeared around He Teng and blocked in front of everyone.

“He Teng, what do you want to do?!” Chang Mang couldn’t help but frown.

He Teng narrowed his eyes and said, “Of course I want to kill you.”

“Kill me? Hahahaha, how cocky!” Chang Mang roared angrily.

He Teng snorted coldly and said, “Qin Yu is already dead. No one will come to help you anymore. Today... you must die here.”

Chang Mang narrowed his eyes and said, “He Teng, are you trying to be a lap dog for the people in Jingdu’s upper class? Do you really think that you can squeeze into their circle just by wagging your tail? Dream on!”

He Teng said calmly, “That has nothing to do with you. Everyone makes their own choices.”

Chang Mang shouted, “Fine! Do you think I’m afraid of you?! What’s more, I have so many bros by my side!”

He Teng couldn’t help but laugh loudly and say, “Chang Mang, you think too highly of them. Do you think they will fight side by side with you? What a joke!”

“Open your eyes and see. They will only watch coldly from the sidelines!”

Chang Mang swept his gaze around him. As expected, these bottom-class martial artists had no intention of attacking.

Although Chang Mang wasn’t afraid of He Teng, their numbness still made Chang Mang feel waves of anger.

“Do you really want to watch coldly from the sidelines? Let me tell you, if I die, you guys will be next!” Chang Mang said angrily.

“Do you think this is He Teng’s own idea? This is the idea of Jingdu’s upper class! They have no intention of giving you guys the treasure at all!”

Chang Mang shouted again and again, but everyone was unmoved.

Yan Guiyi couldn’t help but squint his eyes while carefully sizing up Chang Mang.

Although Chang Mang looked extremely reckless, he knew the importance of joining forces.

“Mr. Chang, this is a dispute between you and He Teng. It has nothing to do with us, right?”

“That’s right. The two of you have had enmity since the beginning. How can you make the problem about social class?”

“Mr. Chang, you have many enemies. Naturally, you’ll attract trouble. This doesn’t seem to have much to do with us.”

When he heard everyone’s words, Chang Mang’s face turned ashen.

“This is between the two of you. It has nothing to do with me,” Yan Guiyi said indifferently.

“Don’t worry. The Jingdu Martial Arts Association will protect your safety.”

Those bottom-class martial artists immediately became more certain that they were right and completely ignored Chang Mang’s words.

Chang Mang couldn’t help but feel furious. He berated angrily, “A bunch of spineless things! It’s because of your cowardice that they become more and more arrogant!”

After saying that, Chang Mang looked at He Teng and shouted, “Come, I’ll kill you right now and avenge Mr. Qin!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Chang Mang’s entire body lit up with a scarlet light as he strode towards He Teng!

However, right at this moment, an intense pain struck his mind! Chang Mang’s divine sense instantly went blank.

Although it was only for an instant, in this kind of life and death battle, it could change the outcome of the battle in an instant!

“Clang!”

He Teng seized the opportunity, and a sharp blade pierced through Chang Mang’s body! Then, his black light turned into a large palm that sent Chang Mang flying!

Chang Mang fell to the ground and his expression was distorted.

The pain made it difficult for him to get up.

“F * ck...” Chang Mang couldn’t help but curse through gritted teeth.

He tried to get up, but Yan Guiyi immediately increased the strength, and Chang Mang fell to the ground again.

Qin Yu, who was sitting on the chair, was extremely anxious. He tried to feel the bracelet, but he found that the bracelet still didn’t loosen.

“Yan Guiyi, I’ll kill you first!”

At this moment, Chang Mang suddenly charged straight at Yan Guiyi!

No one had expected this scene, and even Yan Guiyi himself didn’t have time to react!

Chang Mang’s fist landed squarely on Yan Guiyi’s face and sent him flying!

Everyone was dumbfounded. Someone even whispered. “Is Chang Mang crazy? Why does he look like a mad dog?”

Yan Guiyi stood up from the ground. He rubbed his face and said coldly. “Chang Mang, you’re courting death!”

Chang Mang struggled to support his body and sneered. “Two b*stards in cahoots. If you have the ability, take the bracelet off me. I’ll kill you!”

Yan Guiyi ignored Chang Mang and looked at He Teng coldly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He Teng immediately summoned his power again and dashed toward Chang Mang!

This spell was exactly the same as the one used against Qin Yu. The huge explosion smashed Chang Mang’s body into pieces, and he fell to the ground.

He wanted to get up, but found that he couldn’t get up at all.

On the stage, Qin Yu was extremely anxious.

If this went on, Chang Mang would definitely die here!

“Captain Yan, should we continue moving forward?” Someone asked.

Yan Guiyi didn’t say anything. He only glanced at He Teng.

He Teng nodded slightly. His body was full of murderous intent. He floated up and swept his gaze toward all the martial artists at the bottom level.

“Chang Mang is right. If he and Qin Yu die, you guys will be without a leader... Then you guys will die in my hands.” He Teng grinned and revealed a sinister smile.
