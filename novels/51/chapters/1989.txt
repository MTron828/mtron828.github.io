1990 The Terrifying Strength of the Semi-Saint

The Holy Power spread out and suppressed Qin Yu again.

Qin Yu tried to resist, but he realized he could not. He could not resist the Holy Power at all with his strong brute force!

Just a wisp of the Holy Power was enough to stop Qin Yu from moving!

Seeing this, everyone shook their heads.

!!

The price, who was watching the battle, also sighed.

“Under the suppression of the rules, no one can win,” the prince said in a low voice.

However, an elderly man beside him shook his head and said, “That’s not necessarily the case. It’s not that heaven’s favorite at the Reversion Void Stage had never killed the Semi-Saint before.”

“Oh? Why did you say so?” The prince was slightly surprised.

The elderly man said quietly, “Although Semi-Saints are called as such, they have nothing to do with the True Saint cultivation realm. Their so-called Holy Power is just an imitation. In the end, Semi-Saints are still in the realm of the Reversion Void Stage. They have only comprehended a part of the True Saint’s path. How can they be compared with the True Saint? ”

Hearing this, the prince nodded slightly. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

In history, no one in the Semi-Saint realm or the Reversion Void Stage had ever killed a True Saint.

However, even the Immortal Emperors in their youth seemed to have such abilities.

“Your Highness, if you want to keep Qin Yu for your use, it’s a good choice. He will definitely repay you,” the elderly man said indifferently.

The prince’s expression changed slightly. He turned to look at the elderly man and was about to speak to him, but the elderly man had already disappeared.

The Semi-Saint not far away raised his hand with a cold smile on his face.

Under such suppression, perhaps Qin Yu would be killed in one strike!

With his eyes closed, Qin Yu shouted and activated the cosmic form.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body expanded tremendously, and the golden light illuminated the entire heaven and earth!

The cosmic form was truly a top-notch technique. It was tremendously powerful and even helped Qin Yu escape danger many times.

With the improvement of Qin Yu’s strength, the cosmic form also became more powerful. His body was hundreds of feet tall, and he directly dispersed the so-called Holy Power!

Looking at the huge Qin Yu, the Semi-Saint couldn’t help snorting coldly.

“What kind of bullsh*t technique is this? It can actually break through Holy Power,” the Semi-Saint said coldly.

Qin Yu, on the other hand, was covered in a cold sweat. He looked at the several tiny figures and muttered to himself, “It seems the strength is sufficient. I can still break through this so-called Holy Power.”

With the support of the cosmic form and the fifth level of the fighting word formula, Qin Yu’s strength once again ushered in a surge.

The cosmic form was not just about the physical body becoming stronger, but also brought about an overall improvement.

Qin Yu did not dare to waste time because the cosmic form consumed a terrifying amount of spiritual power.

Therefore, he used the power of the cosmic form to activate the mark and suppress the Semi-Saint!

The Semi-Saint did not dodge. He looked at Qin Yu’s fist and shouted angrily. Then he released thousands of light beams, which condensed into a big hand to meet Qin Yu’s fist!

“Boom!”

The deafening sound seemed to have triggered an earthquake. The ground in the surroundings sank by several feet, turning Sky City into a high ground!

Qin Yu shouted repeatedly. He swung his fist at the Semi-Saint again.

The Semi-Saint still wanted to resist, but he was somehow relying on technique, which was different from Qin Yu’s physical body. Such consumption would definitely reduce his combat power.

Helplessly, the Semi-Saint could only hide here and there, choosing to avoid the focus of attack.

“Don’t waste any more time. Quickly take his life!” Gu Xinghe was anxious!

A Semi-Saint fighting a Reversion Void Stage cultivator didn’t require much effort, but the two were in a deadlock now!

The Semi-Saint seemed to be annoyed by Qin Yu. The veins on his forehead bulged, and the sun and moon hung on his back!

The radiance of the sun and moon enveloped the world as destructive power gathered in his palm!

“It’s the vision of the sun and moon. This elderly man has actually mastered the vision of the sun and moon,” the prince said in a low voice.

“It’s been a long time since we last saw the vision of the sun and moon,” someone chimed in. “Rumor has it that this technique can draw on the power of the sun and moon to unleash the most powerful and terrifying power.”

“That’s right. The person who created this technique once had the potential to step into the Immortal Emperor realm. Rumor has it that he was only one step away.”

Under the support of the vision of the sun and moon, the Semi-Saint’s strength instantly became so terrifying!

He could outline the Great Dao by just raising his hand. Drawing on the power of heaven and earth, he could shatter the void with a casual punch!

Although Qin Yu was supported by cosmic form, he was still forced to retreat continuously.

His huge body could not resist, and its internal qi was constantly weakening!

Qin Yu’s expression was incredibly ugly. If this continued, he would definitely lose this battle!

“Attack! Quickly capture him!” Gu Xinghe was tremendously anxious by the side. He did not want Qin Yu to continue fighting!

“No one is allowed to make a move!” However, this Semi-Saint couldn’t put down his pride. If two Semi-Saints had to work together to suppress Qin Yu, it would tarnish his reputation if the news spread.

After a loud shout, the Semi-Saint raised his head and roared. The sun and moon on his back actually left his body and hung in the air!

The sun and moon arrived with a loud bang as if they were going to destroy the entire Holy Region. Everything nearby was destroyed!

“It’s the Rising Sun and Moon! He actually used this technique to deal with Qin Yu!” the crowd of onlookers suddenly exclaimed.

The Rising Sun and Moon was a technique rarely used by the cultivators even when they fight with the cultivators of the same cultivation realm. However, he had actually used this technique to fight a Reversion Void Stage cultivator. This showed how anxious he was!

The sun and moon hovered in the air, bringing with them a destructive force that pressed down on Qin Yu fiercely!

Qin Yu raised his hands and roared like a wild beast, but he still could not resist the force!

The power of the sun and moon continued to swirl around, further compressing Qin Yu’s body.

...

The light on the cosmic form began to disappear, and Qin Yu’s figure slowly returned to its original state.

Finally, Qin Yu couldn’t bear the power of the vision of the sun and moon anymore. His body returned to its original state and was pressed to the ground.

“Boom!”

A loud explosion reverberated in the sky. The entire land turned into ashes.

Endless smoke and dust covered the sky and the earth as if they wanted to cover everything.

After a brief moment of silence, the surroundings were soon full of the sound of discussions.

On the city wall, countless people were watching this scene and began to predict Qin Yu’s current situation.

“Under the power of the sun and moon, I’m afraid Qin Yu has already turned into ashes.” Someone sighed with emotion.

“I’m not sure. After all, he has a chaotic body and the support of his special cosmic form. He should still be alive.”

The prince stared in Qin Yu’s direction without saying a thing. No one knew what he was thinking.

After a while, the smoke and dust gradually dispersed. In the huge pit, Qin Yu was lying there in ragged clothes. He was covered in blood, and his bones were all broken. It was a terrible sight.
