On the other end, after Cao Shan heard it, he immediately said, “Think of a way to keep him. I’ll bring people over immediately.”

“Yes, Mr. Cao!” Jia Gong hurriedly said.

After hanging up the phone, Jia Gong quietly waited for Qin Yu’s arrival in his office.

After only a few minutes, Qin Yu knocked on the door.

“Come in,” Jia Gong said quickly.

Qin Yu pushed the door open and entered. As soon as he entered, he said politely, “Hello, Mr. Jia. I was referred to by Miss Fang.”

Jia Gong also hurriedly stood up and said, “Oh, you’re Qin Yu? Sit down.”

As he spoke, Jia Gong personally pulled out a chair for Qin Yu.

His polite attitude surprised Qin Yu.

He thought that Fang Yue was why Jia Gong treated him with such a respectful attitude.

“Mr. Jia, I came here this time to ask for your help with something.” Qin Yu didn’t dare to waste any time and quickly revealed his intentions.

After Jia Gong heard it, he nodded and said, “What is it? Speak.”

Qin Yu said, “I want to borrow six Inner Strength Past Masters from you.”

“Six Inner Strength Past Masters?” Jia Gong thought for a moment and didn’t answer.

Qin Yu continued, “Of course, I won’t ask you to help me for nothing.”

After saying this, Qin Yu flipped his palm and a Vitality Enhancing Pill fell into Qin Yu’s hand.

“This Vitality Enhancing Pill is extremely beneficial to cultivation. It’s an Earth Rank pill,” Qin Yu introduced.

Jia Gong’s eyes immediately widened!

Wasn’t an Earth Rank pill a little too extravagant?

One must know that an Earth Rank pill was something that could cause a stir in Yunchuan City!

“Mr. Qin, you’re too polite!” Jia Gong said with a smile as he tucked the pill into his pocket.

Even though that was the case, Jia Gong was an extremely greedy person.

How could he let go of something free?

“Mr. Qin, as you know, it’s not easy to hire an Inner Strength Past Master. Sometimes, they won’t listen to you.” Jia Gong was implying something.

Qin Yu wasn’t stupid. He naturally understood what Jia Gong meant.

Therefore, Qin Yu stood up and said, “Mr. Jia, if you’re willing to hire someone to help, I can give you another stalk of herbs. Its medicinal effect lasts more than 500 years.”

Jia Gong’s eyes lit up and he hurriedly said, “Really?”

“Absolutely,” Qin Yu said.

Jia Gong couldn’t help but lick his lips.

This kid was quite rich!

“Alright then, I can consider helping,” Jia Gong said while blinking. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Without the slightest hesitation, Qin Yu immediately took out a stalk of 500-year-old herbs and handed it to Jia Gong.

Jia Gong was beyond excited. He quickly put the herbs away and said, “Mr. Qin, thank you!”

Qin Yu said, “I should be the one thanking you.”

Although a five-hundred-year-old herb was precious, it wasn’t worth mentioning when compared to Old Mister Yan’s life.

Jia Gong couldn’t help but curse inside.

He tricked this fool, but he was still thanking him!

“Mr. Jia, the matter is urgent, so let’s not waste time,” Qin Yu urged from the side.

Jia Gong’s expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly said, “Gee, it’s not that I don’t want to lend it to you, but the main thing is... they haven’t returned yet, so I have to inform them now.”

“Then I’ll have to trouble you to help me,” Qin Yu’s tone was somewhat anxious.

“Okay, okay. Please wait a moment,” said Jia Gong.

After saying this, Jia Gong walked out of the office.

He took out his cell phone and called Cao Shan.

“Mr. Cao, please hurry up. This kid is quite anxious. I’m afraid I can’t keep him,” said Jia Gong.

Cao Shan said coldly, “Don’t be anxious. I’ll be there in ten minutes.”

“Okay!” Jia Gong quickly agreed.

After he hung up the phone, he returned to his office and said with a smile, “Mr. Qin, please wait for a while. Give me ten minutes.”

“Okay.” Qin Yu agreed.

He could wait for ten minutes.

However, Qin Yu didn’t know that danger was slowly approaching him.

At this moment, Yan Sihai was waiting for Cao Shan’s news.

As long as Qin Yu was captured, then Yan Ruoxue would naturally give up her power.

Time passed minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, ten minutes had passed.

But Cao Shan still hadn’t arrived.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but ask, “Mr. Jia, is it going to take longer?”

Jia Gong was also very anxious. He hurriedly stood up and said, “Mr. Qin, don’t be anxious. He will be here soon.”

“Come, try my new tea. This is good tea.” Jia Gong changed the topic.

Qin Yu was somewhat anxious because Old Mister Yan couldn’t wait.

No one knew when Old Mister Yan’s divine sense would disappear.

Another ten minutes passed.

Qin Yu stood up and said, “Mr. Jia, can you urge him? If you can’t help, please tell me directly.”

Jia Gong rubbed his hands and said, “Don’t be anxious. He will be here soon! I. . . I still have a bottle of good wine here. Mr. Qin, why don’t we try it?”

Qin Yu was a little impatient.

He stood up and said, “Mr. Jia, I said that this matter is very urgent. I hope that you won’t delay my time.”

Jia Gong immediately appeared a little awkward. Just as he was at a loss, the office door finally opened.

Then, he saw a man around 50 years old walk in from outside the door.

There were five people following behind him.

Each of them was an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

“Mr. Cao, you’re finally here!” Jia Gong immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Qin Yu didn’t know Cao Shan’s intentions, so he politely said, “Thank you for your help.”

Cao Shan raised his eyebrows and sneered. “Help? You think I’m here to help you?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “What do you mean?”

“Fool, Mr. Cao is here to kill you! Do you really think I will help you?” Jia Gong hid behind Cao Shan and said aggressively.

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly became a little ugly.

He looked at Jia Gong coldly and said, “You’re really a despicable person.”

Jia Gong sneered. “If you want to blame someone, then blame yourself for being stupid! But the pill you gave me is not bad, so I won’t be polite.”

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to Jia Gong.

He looked at Cao Shan and said, “There doesn’t seem to be any grudges between us, right?”

Cao Shan put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Indeed, but someone wants me to kill you.”

“Someone wants to kill me?” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

He could see that Cao Shan was powerful, and Qin Yu was pressed for time, so Qin Yu suppressed his anger and said, “No matter what conditions the other party offers to kill me, I can give you an Earth Rank pill, or even a Divine Rank pill.”

“I only hope that everyone can compromise,” Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Divine Rank Pill?” Cao Shan raised his eyebrows and was immediately tempted.

A Divine Rank pill was a precious item!

Even Cao Shan had never seen it before!

“How about it? If you’re not satisfied, we can still discuss it,” said Qin Yu.

Cao Shan touched his chin and said, “The conditions you offered are indeed tempting enough, but unfortunately, the other party’s background is too powerful. I can’t afford to cross him.”

“So... you’d better die here!”
