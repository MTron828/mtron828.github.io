Yan Jiang’s expression was a little cold.

He wiped the corner of his mouth and looked coldly at Qin Yu. He said, “It’s really embarrassing to be hit by trash like you...”

At this point, Yan Jiang paused for a moment and then shouted angrily, “Unfortunately, you’re out of luck!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yan Jiang actually took the initiative to rush towards Qin Yu!

His speed was so fast that before Qin Yu could even react, his fist had already smashed into Qin Yu’s lower abdomen!

With a loud bang, Qin Yu felt as if his internal organs were about to be shattered!

The intense pain was unbearable for Qin Yu!

He clutched his stomach and collapsed onto the ground.

A mouthful of fresh blood spewed out from his mouth!

“Ouch...” Qin Yu opened his mouth and couldn’t help but moan in pain!

Yan Jiang looked at Qin Yu coldly and snickered. “As I said before, with your mediocre abilities, you aren’t worthy enough to pursue Miss Yan.”

After saying that, Yan Jiang turned to look at Yan Yongxiu.

“Mr. Yan, it’s over,” Yan Jiang said.

Yan Yongxiu looked at Qin Yu, who was struggling to get up, and couldn’t help but shake his head.

Obviously, Qin Yu had lost the ability to fight.

“Let’s go.” Yan Yongxiu waved his hand.

“Yes.” Yan Jiang and the other bodyguard nodded and then walked out of the door.

“Stop right there!” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted from behind!

After turning around, they saw that Qin Yu had already stood up!

Although he was a bit unsteady, he stood there firmly without letting himself fall down!

“It’s not over yet...” Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said coldly.

Yan Jiang couldn’t help but show a hint of displeasure on his face.

“What? Do you still want to get beaten up?” Yan Jiang said with a hint of anger.

“F * ck you!” Qin Yu roared angrily and actually rushed towards Yan Jiang!

“You’re too big for your britches.” Yan Jiang snorted coldly.

He easily dodged Qin Yu’s fist. Then, he grabbed Qin Yu’s neck and slammed his knee into Qin Yu’s lower abdomen!

“Pfft!”

His knee exerted more force, and the pain was even more intense!

Qin Yu clutched his stomach and fell to the ground in pain!

“Ouch...” This time, the pain almost made Qin Yu faint, and cold sweat broke out on his forehead!

“Mr. Yan, let’s go,” said Yan Jiang.

Yan Yongxiu frowned. Just as he was about to leave, Qin Yu stood up again!

He clutched his body tightly and glared at Yan Jiang while shouting, “It’s not over yet! I haven’t lost yet!!”

This time, Yan Jiang was completely disgruntled.

His expression became colder, and the internal qi in his body suddenly intensified.

“Do you want to die?” Yan Jiang turned around and walked towards Qin Yu step by step.

Qin Yu’s face was already covered in blood. He lowered his head and grinned. “I haven’t lost yet... Go to h*ll!”

He instantly thrust his fist towards Yan Jiang!

He once again punched Yan Jiang’s face!

However, this infuriated Yan Jiang even more!

He suddenly kicked Qin Yu’s chest and sent Qin Yu flying!

However, Qin Yu still stood up!

Even though he was heavily injured, he still supported himself against the wall and stood up again!

Yan Jiang’s expression changed and he said angrily, “Are you a lunatic?! Stay down for me!”

Following an angry roar, Yan Jiang suddenly threw a punch!

With a loud bang, Qin Yu fell to the ground again!

This time, Qin Yu fell to the ground without moving, as if he had fainted. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yan Jiang panted heavily. He wiped the sweat on his forehead, and he couldn’t help but feel a little afraid.

He wasn’t afraid of Qin Yu’s combat kills, but he was afraid that this lunatic would stand up again!

Even Yan Yongxiu stood there and waited quietly.

But as time passed, Qin Yu still didn’t respond even after they waited for a full five minutes.

“He shouldn’t be able to get up this time.” Yan Yongxiu shook his head.

“Let’s go.”

Yan Jiang let out a sigh of relief.

They had finally gotten rid of this madman.

The few of them walked towards the door. Just as they were about to step out of the room, a voice came from behind them.

“Stop right there!”

The loud shout almost made Yan Jiang lose his balance!

He couldn’t help but turn around and scream in frustration, “Do you really want to die?!”

Qin Yu forced himself to stand up. His body shook and he grinned. “I... I haven’t fallen yet. Continue... continue...”

Yan Yongxiu couldn’t help but frown, “If this continues, you will die.”

Qin Yu grinned coldly. “I... I won’t die. Before I marry Miss Yan again... I will never die...”

“D*mn it, I will kill you right now!” Yan Jiang said furiously.

He smashed his steel-like fist at Qin Yu fiercely!

However, something shocking happened!

This time, Yan Jiang’s fist actually didn’t smash at Qin Yu’s body! Instead, Qin Yu firmly grasped it in his hand!

“How... how is this possible?!” Yan Yongxiu’s mouth instantly dropped agape! He could barely believe the scene in front of him!

Yan Jiang’s pupils dilated dramatically!

How did this guy do it?!

“Hehe... you want to kill me?” Qin Yu raised his head and looked at Yan Jiang with a somewhat malevolent expression.

“I said... before marrying Miss Yan, I won’t die!!” Qin Yu raised his head and shouted!

Along with this angry roar, Qin Yu punched Yan Jiang’s face with all his might!
