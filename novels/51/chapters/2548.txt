Chapter 2549 Saint Becomes Monster

His voice was as clear and solemn as the Sanskrit calling out the Daoist name leisurely.

This voice seemed to come from the distant depths of the void, resonating like rolling golden bells echoing between heaven and earth, causing a sway in one’s spirit.

As Xuan Tian’s voice grew increasingly louder, the air seemed to freeze, and a murderous aura spread out.

The sound waves were like sharp blades, tearing through the void and cutting through all obstacles blocking their path forward.

Qin Yu felt his heart tremble. His voice seemed to ring out from the depths of his heart.

Every word was interrogating his heart.

“At the end of the journey, looking back, reflect on the original aspiration, and return to simplicity and truth.

“Looking back, reflect on the original aspiration!”

Even if he was just affected, Qin Yu strongly desired to reflect.

Did he work hard all these years? Why was he still so weak now? He could not even defeat a Saint.

“I’m guilty! I peeked at the sect’s Aunt Li bathing! I even touched with my hand!”

Zhang Xiang, whose mental strength was weaker, found it even more unbearable and cried bitterly on the ground!

“Isn’t Aunt Li almost 4,000 years old? Furthermore, her look just doesn’t make people feel nauseous, but her butt is just bigger… I didn’t expect you to have such a hobby…”

Li Yang was speechless. Shen Qian and Shen Rou also disdained him by the side.

“What a terrifying Daoist interrogation sound. Can this awaken the semi-human and semi-Saint Zi Yang?”

Qin Yu frowned as he looked at Saint Zi Yang, who was drifting in the air and felt uneasy.

“It’s definitely impossible if it’s Saint Zi Yang. However, his condition should be at the bottom of the valley now. With the half-human and half-monster fighting each other, he shouldn’t be in the sixth-level realm now. Otherwise, Lord Su Xinghe couldn’t detect his internal qi.”

The Saint’s aura was like the bright moon in the sky. It was impossible to hide it for long, regardless of the method used.

Xuan Xin dared not confirm. After all, this was a Saint. All kinds of changes were possible. He hesitated for a moment before continuing.

“After such a long time, no one has been able to detect Saint Zi Yang’s internal qi. This surely means that his cultivation realm has dropped. At this moment, his soul should be in a tremendously weak state. Perhaps Junior Brother Xuan Tian can awaken the power of humanity in Martial Uncle’s soul.”

“I hope so! I’m afraid it won’t be that smooth as Saint Zi Yang’s monster body has already occupied 80%.”

Qin Yu looked at the human-monster body with some worry. What could make a Saint lose his mind and allow the dark power to invade him in the Misty Forest?

In the void, a bolt of divine thunder suddenly struck down, and a familiar internal qi spread out from the sky. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The universe seemed to be swallowed by darkness in an instant. An indescribable dark energy surged out of the void.

This darkness was incomparably dense, like a boundless abyss. The desire to devour everything emanated from it.

Dark energy instantly filled the entire world, permeating every corner and surrounding everything.

It transcended all understanding and had no shape or mass, but it had an incomparable sense of oppression and terrifying power.

Although it was the same color as the night, everyone could feel the terrifying fluctuations.

In front of this power, the range the darkness covered was boundless and endless. Regardless of the stars or life, they were insignificant in its presence.

power of sacrifice! What an exaggerated power of sacrifice! It’s even more exaggerated than the power of sacrifice encountered in the Solitary Shadow Continent!”

Qin Yu’s body almost trembled.

Previously in the Solitary Shadow Continent, the monster race had already used about 400 million humans for sacrifices. This time, the power of sacrifice from countless planes had gathered.

This divine thunder seemed to have gathered the power of sacrifice from countless planes.

The instant the thunderbolt descended, Zi Yang’s half-rotten body began to undergo a massive change. The power of sacrifice of the monster race surged into his body.

At this moment, his wing on one side lit up with a ball of black and red flames enveloping his body.

The rotting skin and pus slowly formed scabs as the flames danced and moved.

The surrounding power of sacrifice raged around Zi Yang like a storm.

The demonic qi that contained the power of the ultimate Path of Heaven surged into Saint Zi Yang’s body from all directions, seeping into every inch of his skin.

The rotten half of his monster body rapidly expanded, with his muscles bulging and veins becoming prominent under the skin. He became as strong and terrifying as an evil spirit.

His other eye began to turn red, and his pupil expanded, showing a deep black or red color.

This monster light revealed a violent and evil internal qi, causing one’s heart to palpitate.

“Boom!”

The moment his gaze landed on Xuan Tian, he seemed to have suffered a heavy blow.

His entire body crashed heavily onto the ground, and he was on the verge of death.

On his body, a sachet suddenly shattered into pieces and fell onto the ground.

“This is the Guardian Celestial Dipper given by the Sect Master Senior Brother. It can protect against the attack at the Peak of Tribulation Transcending. With just a single glance, it destroyed this magical artifact and severely injured Xuan Tian.”

Everyone fell silent.

The six people who initially had hoped that Zi Yang could resume his human body gave up totally.

This power had surpassed the limits of what they could deal with.

“My friend Qin Yu, I’ll see if I can stall for a second or two later. Your Glazed Holy Body might have a slim chance of escaping! I’m sorry to have implicated you.”

Xuan Xin looked apologetic.

They had come here to search for the legacy Saint Zi Yang left behind and had called Qin Yu over to increase their chances of success. However, they did not expect the Saint to be still alive and had been possessed completely and could no longer be awakened at all.

Qin Yu helped Xuan Tian up. He sent a stream of pure spiritual energy from the Heart of the Ocean into his body, stabilizing his vitality.

Xuan Tian slowly opened his eyes. His gaze was extremely dim, and his lips moved a few times. In the end, he did not utter any sound.

Qin Yu sighed. This feeling was a sign of the collapse of faith.

Perhaps Saint Zi Yang was a mountain of faith in Xuan Tian’s heart.

Now that the mountain had collapsed, the impact on him was indescribable.

In just a few seconds, the indescribably massive power of the sacrifice of the monster race’s Path of Heaven had completely entered Saint Zi Yang’s body.

As he slowly stood up, the internal qi on his body shot into the sky like a blade.

The entire Misty Forest suddenly became deathly silent as if welcoming the return of the Saint.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s last trace of hope completely vanished.

The fact that the monster race’s Path of Heaven could infuse such a terrifying sacrificial power into Saint Zi Yang’s body meant that he was bound to become a monster. Otherwise, the monster race’s Path of Heaven would not have wasted such a terrifying power of sacrifice.

This surge of power of sacrifice was more than enough to refine another eight-winged monster race army. Previously, He Teng had only obtained less than a quarter of the power and became the Fallen Godly King of the monster race.
