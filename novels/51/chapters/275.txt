Chapter 276: Crushing the Earth Fiend Valley! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When they heard Qin Yu’s words, their expressions instantly changed.

“You... didn’t you say that you could spare us?” The old man said in shock.

Qin Yu sneered. “None of the surviving members of the Earth Fiend Valley can live. I was just lying to you.”

“You... you went back on your word!” The old man was on the verge of breaking down.

As if he had gone mad, he took the initiative to rush toward Qin Yu.

Qin Yu clenched his fist and pierced through his chest!

The remaining few people weren’t spared either. Qin Yu raised his hand and killed all of them!

The Earth Fiend Valley fell just like that.

Tang Ling and Cheng Cai’s eyes were filled with fear. They couldn’t help but take two steps back, as if they were afraid of Qin Yu.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “I only kill people from the Earth Fiend Valley.”

After saying that, Qin Yu walked towards Jiang Gu.

At this time, Jiang Gu had already sat up from the formation.

He looked at his own corpse beside him, and his expression immediately changed.

“Mr. Qin, what... What’s going on?” Jiang Gu said in horror.

Updates by

Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and told Jiang Gu the whole story.

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Jiang Gu was stunned.

“So... I now have a holy body?” Jiang Gu gulped.

He had seen with his own eyes that a holy body could fight Qin Yu in close combat without being at a disadvantage!

With such a body, his strength would definitely increase by a lot!

“Thank you, Mr. Qin!” Jiang Gu was extremely excited and kowtowed.

Qin Yu helped Jiang Gu up and said with a smile, “As for how you explain your identity, it’s up to you.”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Qin!” Jiang Gu clenched his fist and felt the abundant power coming from his body.

Qin Yu turned around and walked into the depths of the Earth Evil Valley.

The Earth Evil Valley occupied an extremely large area, and there were many caves in this valley.

In each cave, there were human corpses and some poisonous things.

For example, parasites, poisonous snakes, toads, and so on.

And behind the Earth Fiend Valley, there was a huge artificial stone statue.

The appearance of the stone statue was that of the Earth Fiend Valley’s ancestor.

Qin Yu raised his head and looked at the huge stone statue with an extremely cold expression.

It was this ancestor who created the Earth Fiend Valley, and it was also because of him that so many innocent people were harmed.

Qin Yu held the golden light in his hand and smashed it toward the stone statue with a loud bang.

The stone statue shattered under the tremendous force!

“Mr. Qin!”

At this moment, Jiang Gu ran over from not far away.

He exclaimed, “I found this kind of pill in the valley!”

The pill in Jiang Gu’s hand was the one that Hui Ming had been showing off earlier.

Qin Yu was instantly delighted and hurriedly asked, “How many more are there?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“At least enough to fill three snake skin pouches!” Jiang Gu said excitedly.

This pill contained pure spiritual energy. Three snake skin pouches full of it would be unimaginably valuable.

“Bring these pills with you later,” Qin Yu said.

“Yes!” Jiang Gu hurriedly nodded.

Then, Qin Yu walked towards the dungeon of the Earth Fiend Valley.

The two dungeons held young girls and martial artists respectively.

At this moment, each of their faces were filled with despair.

“I don’t want to die... I don’t want to die...” Xiao Mi repeated this sentence, as if she had gone crazy.

The other people’s conditions weren’t much better. This kind of encounter had caused great psychological trauma.

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the entrance of the dungeon.

Everyone’s expression changed abruptly, and some of them were so scared that they cried on the spot!

“Don’t kill me. Don’t kill me...”

The dungeon was filled with mournful cries, and they couldn’t help but curl backwards.

When he saw everyone’s state, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

The psychological damage caused by this kind of encounter would probably need a lifetime to be erased.

“Don’t be afraid. I’m here to save you guys.” Qin Yu held the bronze sword in his hand, and with a gentle wave, he sliced the door into two.

However, these people didn’t seem to believe Qin Yu, and no one even dared to come out.

Qin Yu felt quite helpless, and for a moment, he didn’t know what to say.

“Cousin? Why are you here?” At this moment, Tang Ling suddenly shouted in surprise!

After hearing her voice, a woman in her twenties immediately looked at Tang Ling.

“Tang... Tang Ling? Is it really you?” The woman couldn’t stop her tears.

She rushed out quickly and hugged Tang Ling. She couldn’t help but burst into tears.

“Why are you here?” Tang Ling asked in surprise.

Tang Ling’s cousin cried and said, “I heard that the divination of the ancient tower is very accurate, so I wanted to give it a try. I didn’t expect to be locked up here by them...”

Hearing this, Tang Ling couldn’t help but feel a lingering fear.

If it wasn’t for Qin Yu, she would probably be locked up here too.

At this time, Xiao Mi also recognized Qin Yu. She wiped her tears and ran out of the dungeon.

“Qin Yu, is it really you...” Xiao Mi said in a trembling voice.

“Those people are so scary. They took Xiao Yu. I...”

“They’re already dead,” Qin Yu interrupted Xiao Mi.

Tang Ling also said from the side, “Those bad guys were killed by Mr. Qin. You are safe now!”

Finally, these girls began to try to walk out of the dungeon.

After confirming that Qin Yu wasn’t a bad guy, these girls began to express their gratitude to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu didn’t have the time to listen to their heartfelt words. Instead, he turned around and walked to another dungeon.

This dungeon was full of martial artists. The difference was that many of the martial artists were already skin and bones. Dried corpses could be seen everywhere.

Qin Yu frowned.

He touched his chin, as if he had guessed something.

“Those pills... could they be refined from the inner strength of these martial artists?” Qin Yu murmured in a low voice.

Hui Ming could absorb the inner strength of others, but the capacity of his dantian was limited. It was very likely that Hui Ming had refined the extra inner strength into a pill!

“This Hui Ming really has quite some tricks up his sleeve.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

After saving the people, Qin Yu planned to leave the Earth Fiend Valley.

The few of them rushed to the airport together. On the way, Cheng Cai said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, it’s all thanks to you. Otherwise, we would definitely be locked up in that dungeon...”

Qin Yu closed his eyes and didn’t say a word.

Tang Ling said in a low voice, “Mr. Qin, can I have your phone number?”

“Mr. Qin is very tired and needs to rest. Don’t disturb him,” Jiang Gu said in a deep voice.

Tang Ling looked at Jiang Gu and said, “Sir, can you give me your phone number?”

Jiang Gu frowned slightly, but in the end, he still gave his phone number to Tang Ling.

The car sped along. Xiao Mi looked at the unconscious Xiao Yu with a guilty look on her face.

Soon, the car arrived at the airport.

Jiang Gu went to check in, then the few of them were ready to leave.

“Mr. Qin.” At this moment, Tang Ling suddenly tugged at the corner of Qin Yu’s shirt.

“Will we have the chance to meet again in the future?” Tang Ling asked softly.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Perhaps.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and walked towards the plane.

Beauties always loved heroes.

Tang Ling was naturally no exception.

The scene of Qin Yu’s heroic battle left an indelible mark in Tang Ling’s heart.

She looked in the direction of Qin Yu as her beautiful eyes shone with brilliance.

Qin Yu didn’t take her words seriously at all.

After getting on the plane, Jiang Gu teased, “That little girl called Tang Ling might have fallen in love with you.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes at Jiang Gu and said, “I’ve only met her once, so how could I like her?”

“You can’t say that. Miss Yan hasn’t known you for long,” Jiang Gu retorted.

Qin Yu was instantly speechless.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt the imprint in his mind flickering.

Then, Qin Yu’s divine sense was sucked into the stone statue.
