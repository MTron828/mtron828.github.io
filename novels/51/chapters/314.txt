Chapter 315: Ye Qing Came Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Jingdu was a special place for Qin Yu.

And this was the first time he went to Jingdu.

After returning home, Qin Yu couldn’t sleep the whole night. His feelings were somewhat mixed.

There was exhilaration, worry, and excitement.

But all of this ultimately turned into anticipation.

The next day, after Qin Yu had prepared everything, he quietly waited for the arrival of tomorrow.

After learning that Qin Yu was going to Jingdu, Yao Qing volunteered, “I’m going too!”

Qin Yu originally didn’t want to bring Yao Qing along, but he felt that this was a good opportunity to see the world, so he agreed.

The next morning, Qin Yu brought Yao Qing to the Chuzhou Military District early in the morning.

Eighteen team members had already been waiting on the training ground early in the morning.

Commander Long had personally led the team, and that was enough to show the importance he attached to this matter.

After Qin Yu arrived, the team members shouted in unison, “Hello, Mr. Qin!”

Qin Yu nodded as a greeting.

“Qin Yu, are you ready?” Commander Long asked.

Updates by

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Yes, we can set off now.”

“Okay!” Commander Long waved his hand and shouted, “Let’s go!”

Everyone got into the car. Qin Yu and Xue Hu, as the head and assistant coaches, naturally had to stay with the team members.

Ever since Qin Yu took out the training plan, these team members had a lot of respect for Qin Yu. Their respect for him even surpassed their respect for Xue Hu.

On the way, Qin Yu chatted with many of the team members.

After arriving at the airport, everyone set off on the road to Jingdu.

...

A huge training ground in Jingdu’s Military District was the location of the competition.

Many teams had already arrived here early.

Each team had eighteen members, and the competition method was very simple and crude. It was one team against one team.

At noon, Qin Yu and the others finally arrived at the Jingdu Military District.

Qin Yu stood at the entrance of the Military District while breathing in the air from Jingdu. He couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice, “Is this Jingdu?”

“Qin Yu, as the head coach, you have to lead the team. Hurry up and go in,” Commander Long reminded him.

Qin Yu nodded. Just as he was about to lead the team into the training ground, Commander Long suddenly said, “Qin Yu, don’t forget what I reminded you of.”

“I got it,” Qin Yu replied.

Then, Qin Yu and Xue Hu led the team into the training ground.

Meanwhile, Commander Long stepped onto the viewing platform.

“Mr. Long, are you guys still going to get last place this time?” As soon as they sat down, a middle-aged man next to them teased them with a smile.

This middle-aged man came from the Central Plains’ Military District. Over the years, the Chuzhou region was last place and the Central Plains region was second to last.

Therefore, whenever the two met, they would mock each other.

“Mr. Sun, I’m afraid your team will be the last this year,” Commander Long said nonchalantly.

The man called Mr. Sun suddenly laughed and said, “You’ve said that at least five times, haven’t you?”

Commander Long blushed and snorted. “This time, the Chuzhou region has produced a talent. With him as a coach, it’s no problem for us to be in the top three.”

“Hehe, what talent? How can there be any talents in Chuzhou? What’s his name? It can’t be Jiang Gu, right?” Mr. Sun said with a smile.

Commander Long was showing off. He said, “His name is Qin Yu, and he is known as the King of Chuzhou!”

“What King of Chuzhou? I’ve never heard of him,” Mr. Sun said with a smile.

Then, he pointed to his team and said, “The head coach of our team this time is a genuine Inner Strength Past Master! He is known as the genius of the Central Plains! To tell you the truth, our goal is to rank in the top five!”

“As for the last place, you should keep it for yourself,” Mr. Sun said with a smile.

Commander Long snorted and didn’t say anything else.

There were still two hours before the official match.

During this time, many officers were sitting in the stands and exchanging greetings.

As the head coach, Qin Yu was naturally responsible for lecturing everyone.

“Qin Yu, do you see that team?” At this time, Hu Xue pointed to a team not far away.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “What’s wrong?”

Xue Hu said, “They come from the Central Plains’ Military District and are our number one enemy. All these years, we have been vying for the position of second from the bottom, but we have never won.”

“We have to fight for the position of second from the bottom? Even if we get it, it doesn’t seem glorious, right?” Qin Yu said somewhat helplessly.

Hu Xue rolled his eyes. “You don’t understand. No one in this world remembers the second from the bottom, but someone will remember the first from the bottom.”

“That’s true.” Qin Yu touched his nose and whispered.

“By the way, will Ye Qing come today?” Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Hu Xue nodded. “Usually, he will come to visit.”

Qin Yu suddenly felt expectant.

What kind of person was Ye Qing, who was worshiped as a god?

As they were talking, the head coach of the Central Plains’ Military District suddenly walked toward Qin Yu.

He walked to Qin Yu and said with a nonchalant smile, “You are the head coach of the Chuzhou region?”

Qin Yu nodded and said politely, “Commander Long thinks highly of me, so he asked me to lead the team.”

The young man looked Qin Yu up and down and sneered. “You’re an Inner Strength Master Hands? Is there no one more capable in the Chuzhou region?”

Qin Yu said with a nonchalant smile, “Commander Long said that I, an Inner Strength Master Hands, am enough to deal with people like you.”

Hearing this, the young man couldn’t help but sneer. “You’re quite arrogant.”

“Nah,” said Qin Yu.

The young man narrowed his eyes and said, “But I have bad news for you. This year’s competition has added another event.”

“In addition to the fights between the members, the head coach also has to participate in the competition.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and smiled. “This is really beyond my expectations.”

The young man said, “It seems that Commander Long isn’t well-informed. The team is led by an Inner Strength Master Hands, so this year, the Chuzhou region will be the last place again.”

Qin Yu curled his lips and said, “Is this your first time leading a team?”

The young man nodded and said, “Yes, why?”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “Then you’re quite unlucky. All these years, the Military District of the Central Plains has always been ranked second to last. You have just led a team, but you guys will be ranked last.”

“Your commander probably won’t forgive you.” Qin Yu grinned and said.

The young man’s expression suddenly turned cold.

“I hope you can be as calm and assured later,” the young man said coldly.

After saying this, the young man turned around and left.

After he left, Xue Hu said, “This young man is an Inner Strength Past Master. His name is Lu Chen. He just joined the Central Plains’ Military District two years ago. I heard that the Central Plains’ Military District has high hopes for him.”

Qin Yu didn’t think much of him. He had seen through Lu Chen’s strength. At most, he was a third-level Inner Strength Past Master.

To the current Qin Yu, a mere third-level Inner Strength Past Master wasn’t even worth mentioning.

“Ye Qing is here!” At this moment, Xue Hu suddenly pointed at the grandstand in front of him and said.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
