Chapter 1571: Chapter 1571, two godly monarchs and absolute dance 1

Hearing this, Xiao Hai immediately fell into silence.

After a long time, he looked at Qin Yu and said, “Are you very curious?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I am indeed a little curious because normal people would not wear a mask on their face.”

“Do you want to see what it looks like under the mask?”At this moment, Xiao Hai spoke again.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “If you’re willing.”

“Hahahaha!”Xiao Hai could not help but laugh out loud.

He looked towards the northern lands and pointed towards the other side of the Dead River with one hand. He said, “When this battle is over, I promise you.”

“Really?”Qin Yu raised his brows.

“I, Xiao Hai, never lie.”Xiao Hai said with a faint smile.

Qin Yu cupped his hands and said, “Thank you very much.”

In the following period of time, there was still no movement from the northern lands.

In the blink of an eye, eight days had passed.

Eight days was not a long time for a cultivator, but to Qin Yu, it was truly a waste.

......

After these eight days, Qin Yu had a general understanding of the strength of the northern lands:

The Master of the northern lands was the most powerful, and his strength was unknown. Below them were the four great godly monarchs.

The strength of these four godly monarchs had already half-stepped into the reversion void stage. However, in terms of realm, they were even above Xiao Hai.

Qin Yu knew very well that once he touched upon the word ‘reversion void’, his strength would be incomparable to that of a mighty realm expert. This was also the reason why Wen Wanli wanted Qin Yu’s physical body to step into the reversion void stage.

“If I were to meet those four godly monarchs, I might not necessarily be able to win,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The current Qin Yu was, after all, just a newly advanced mighty figure. He was still too far away from the void-return.

If the current Qin Yu was a peak mighty figure, he would definitely not be afraid of any of the four godly monarchs. Even Xiao Hai would have the courage to fight him.

“Eight days have already passed. Since I have nothing to do, I might as well take the opportunity to cultivate now,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He took out the great Yue fruit and the Huangji Buddha Flame from the spatial magic artifact.

These two treasures could greatly increase one’s strength, especially the Huangji Buddha Flame. Rumor has it that after devouring this item, one’s strength would increase qualitatively.

However, all of this was just a legend. Qin Yu did not know what would happen after devouring the Huangji Buddha Flame.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally put away the Huangji Buddha Flame.

Because the current Qin Yu did not dare to guarantee when the northern lands would invade. He had to put himself in a peak state.

Hence, Qin Yu picked up the great Yue fruit and stuffed it into his mouth.

The effect of the great Yue fruit was similar to the Enlightenment tea. The moment he swallowed it, Qin Yu felt his state of mind improve.

This was an extremely strange feeling. Normally, the improvement of one’s state of mind mostly came from comprehension and came from life. This illusory feeling was difficult to describe.

Qin Yu swallowed several great Yue fruits in succession. Then, he closed his eyes slightly and began to comprehend the DAO technique, feeling the laws of heaven and earth.

On the other side.

South Prefecture.

The two godly monarchs did not leave the South Prefecture.

On the contrary, they hid in the green rock forest, recuperating while looking for news of the southern region.

Without a doubt, the previous battle had left a psychological scar on them. Towards the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master, they were afraid from the bottom of their hearts.

Especially that Rashomon sect. No matter how they resisted, they were unable to escape that powerful suction force.

“Looks like Sima Bei did not lie to us.”A godly monarch said coldly.

“Let’s wait for the master to recover. Otherwise, no one is his match.”

“A mere avatar is already so terrifying. I suspect that he has already stepped into the reversion void stage.”

The two of them could not help but have a cold expression. Although they were apprehensive, to return in defeat like this was too shameful. They had no way to explain to the master of the northern lands.

“Since we can’t get rid of the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, let’s find someone else.”One of the Godly Kings said.

“The most famous people in the southern region are only the three madmen and three absolutes. We’ll start with them,”said the other godly monarch coldly.

“Let’s start with Jue Wu. She killed thousands of our people in the northern lands. We must pay the price for this!”

The two of them looked at each other and immediately stood up, heading for Mount Hua Ning.

On Mount Hua Ning.

Jue Wu was as usual, bringing Wen da Wen er to eat, drink, and have fun every day.

It was not an exaggeration to say that this was originally a holy land of cultivation. However, under Jue Wu’s lead, this place was like a place of entertainment in the mortal world.

“I can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to drink anymore. My Body Can’t take it anymore.”Wen Da lay under the gazebo and kept complaining.

Jue Wu pinched his mouth and kept pouring wine into it. As she drank, she said, “No one will leave until you finish drinking today!”

As she said this, Jue Wu suddenly frowned and let go of Wen Da.

She quickly turned around and walked toward her cultivation room.

After arriving at the cultivation room, Jue Wu’s thin and weak body began to tremble violently.

She stared at the mirror in front of her and her face turned a little pale.

At this moment, she felt weak all over, as if she was going to fall at any moment.

The whole process lasted for more than ten minutes before the feeling slowly disappeared. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She slowly stood up from the ground and said in a low voice, “It’s longer than last time.”

Fortunately, she had a big heart, so she didn’t take it to heart. She turned around and was about to go out to continue drinking.

However, when she looked at the mirror, her little face slightly changed.

The reason was no other than a strand of white hair growing on her forehead.

Although there was only one hair, it was enough to show that the side effects of the Nirvana body were becoming more and more obvious.

“What the hell.”

She thought that the last dance party would be heartbroken. However, she muttered and casually pulled down the white hair, then turned around and walked out of the door.

All the way back to the pavilion, the last dance looked at Wen Da Wen er, who was already sleeping soundly. She couldn’t help but mutter in a low voice, “Sigh, it seems that we still have to find Qu Zhu. These two kids really have poor alcohol tolerance.”

“Master Jue Wu, master qu Zhu is in closed-door cultivation,”the two attendants at the side reminded her.

Jue Wu patted her head and said, “Forget it. We’ll go to the foot of the mountain and catch them later.”

As she said this, Jue Wu suddenly felt an internal Qi rapidly approaching her.

She was very familiar with this internal Qi. It came from a cultivator of the northern land.

Jue Wu frowned slightly. She looked at the two attendants and said, “Take them to the cultivation room.”

The two attendants naturally didn’t dare to say anything. They hurriedly dragged Wen da Wen er to the cultivation room.

Then, Jue Wu leaped and arrived at the entrance of Mount Hua Ning, quietly waiting for the arrival of these two people.

A few minutes later, the two godly monarchs arrived at Mount Hua Ning.

They looked down at Jue Wu and said indifferently, “It seems that you have long noticed us.”

Jue Wu snorted and said, “The stench on your bodies is extremely pungent even if you are separated by a thousand stars.”
