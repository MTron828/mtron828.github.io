Chapter 664: About to Fail Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s blood was burning as he raised his head and shouted angrily!

At this moment, the blood on his body seemed to have been dyed a golden color!

Geng Si’s expression was similarly crazy. The destroy spell in his hand grew stronger and stronger, as if it was about to explode!

“Go to hell!” Following that, Geng Si shouted loudly, and the destroy spell in his hand directly slapped towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s fist also swung out at this moment!

“Boom!”

The moment the two spells collided, the entire space seemed to be buzzing!

The destroy spell carried a strange power, as if it wanted to swallow Qin Yu’s fist!

And Qin Yu wasn’t willing to be outdone. The dragon’s roar in his hand was incessant, as if it wanted to shatter everything!

The destroy spell was repeatedly pushed back by Qin Yu’s fist, while Qin Yu seemed to have fallen into a state of madness, as he punched and punched non-stop!

The destroy spell became dimmer and dimmer, as if it was about to be shattered by Qin Yu!

Geng Si’s expression was slightly unsightly, and his pupils were filled with shock.

But he wasn’t flustered, because the initiative was still in his hands!

“Boom!”

Finally, under the force of Qin Yu’s fist, the destroy spell was directly penetrated!

The terrifying power dissipated and rippled in all directions!

Dark clouds rose in the sky and a violent wind swept up!

The blood on Qin Yu’s body flowed down his body and dyed the ground red!

Geng Si couldn’t help but clap his hands and sneer. “This is really shocking...”

Qin Yu was full of fighting spirit and his eyes were sharp. He strode forward like an undefeated God of War!

“Come and fight!” Qin Yu shouted loudly!

Geng Si sneered. “Fight? You can last at most half an hour. Why should I fight with you?”

As he spoke, Geng Si stepped back step by step.

He put his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile, “You are like a stubborn mouse, and I am the cat that teased you.”

“And the final outcome of the mouse is to be played to death by the cat.”

Qin Yu knew that he couldn’t last long, so he did not dare to waste time. He immediately stepped on the ground and rushed toward Geng Si! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Geng Si kept dodging. His speed was extremely fast, and he dodged Qin Yu’s fatal blow every time!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth. He waved his fist while trying to kill Geng Si with one punch!

“Boom!”

Finally, under Qin Yu’s bombardment, Geng Si’s chest was hit by a punch!

This punch made Geng Si’s chest sink, and he spat out a mouthful of blood!

“You have some ability.” Geng Si wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.

“Continue to be crazy. I’ll see how long you can be crazy for,” Geng Si said coldly.

Qin Yu raised both hands, and his feet shook. Then he shouted, “Heavy Falling Space!”

Rays of light spread out from under Qin Yu’s feet!

Qin Yu was in the middle stage of the Martial Marquis realm, so the range of Heavy Falling Space increased!

The moment Geng Si fell into space, his speed instantly decreased!

“What is this?” Geng Si frowned slightly. He shook his arm and found that his entire body had become extremely heavy.

Qin Yu did not have time to explain to him. He immediately stepped on the ground and rushed towards Geng Si!

Under the influence of the Heavy Falling Space, Geng Si’s speed slowed down a lot!

Faced with Qin Yu’s powerful attack, Geng Si looked extremely pathetic!

“Bang!”

Qin Yu’s speed was extremely fast. There were almost no fist shadows, only streaks of golden light flashing!

In the blink of an eye, Geng Si was hit several times. His body kept sinking and finally sank into the ground!

Qin Yu panted heavily and stared in Geng Si’s direction.

In the blink of an eye, twenty minutes had passed. There wasn’t much time left for Qin Yu!

Upstairs, Xia Hang was also watching this scene.

He knew very well that if Qin Yu lost, he would have to run away or he would die!

“Impressive...”

At this moment, Geng Si got up from the ground.

His body was almost shattered, and the blood dyed his whole body red!

“I really underestimated you...” Geng Si wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and his expression was a bit cold.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Stop talking nonsense. Die!”

As he spoke, Qin Yu rushed at Geng Si again!

However, at this moment, Geng Si’s speed suddenly became extremely fast! He easily dodged Qin Yu’s fist!

In the blink of an eye, Geng Si’s figure actually retreated hundreds of meters!

“How could this be?” Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed!

Geng Si’s feet shook again, and in the blink of an eye, he was in front of Qin Yu again.

“If I were defeated by you, I wouldn’t be worthy of wearing this purple robe...” Geng Si grinned and said.

Qin Yu said coldly, “How is this possible? You actually broke free from the Heavy Falling Space?!”

Geng Si said, “Heavy Falling Space? It’s indeed a good spell, but in front of the Wind Spell, it isn’t worth mentioning.”

“Wind Spell?” Qin Yu frowned!

There was the destruction spell before, and now, there was the Wind Spell. What kind of spell was this?

Geng Si seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s confusion. He smiled and said, “This is a top-notch spell. There are a total of 18 words. Each word contains a different energy.”

“In front of the Wind Spell, your Heavy Falling Space isn’t worth mentioning.”

Qin Yu was naturally unwilling to give up. He shouted loudly and clenched his Golden Fist to fight Geng Si again!

However, Geng Si’s speed was too fast. In the blink of an eye, he retreated hundreds of meters. Qin Yu couldn’t catch up!

He threw dozens of punches in a row, but they failed to touch the corner of Geng Si’s clothes!

This made Qin Yu feel extremely desperate! He panted heavily and stared in Geng Si’s direction. His face was full of unwillingness.

“How could this be...” Qin Yu’s expression was ferocious, and he was in extreme anguish!

He could clearly feel that the internal qi on his body was rapidly declining.

Obviously, the time limit of the spell was about to run out, and Qin Yu would soon turn into fish meat on the chopping board.

“I can’t give up just like that...” Qin Yu roared again and again. He seemed to have gone mad and kept smashing at Geng Si.

However, Geng Si came and went as he pleased.

“You don’t have much time left, right?” Geng Si said with his hands behind his back and a playful look on his face.

Qin Yu’s breathing became heavier and heavier, and his strength was also rapidly disappearing.

Both his speed and strength had decreased by a few points!

“How could this be?!” Qin Yu was unwilling to give up, and he kept screaming in pain!

He had calculated everything, but in the end, Geng Si had turned the tables!

His many days of hard work had turned into nothing. This pain was indescribable!

Finally, Qin Yu couldn’t bear it anymore. The internal qi on his body quickly withered, and his strength disappeared without a trace at this moment.

Qin Yu fell to the ground with a thud. He tried to get up, but he couldn’t.

Geng Si stepped forward and stepped on Qin Yu’s body.

“What? It’s over? What a pity,” Geng Si said with a cold smile.

Qin Yu’s face was full of despair. He kept mumbling, “I can’t fail... I can’t die...”

Seeing this, Geng Si couldn’t help but laugh. “I’ve seen many people who are about to die. They either beg for mercy or scream at the top of their lungs. You’re the first one who’s so indignant.”

Qin Yu couldn’t listen to anything else. He knew very well what it meant for him to fall this time.

Not only would he die, but Yan Ruoxue would also stay in prison forever.

The plan seemed to have failed.

Even Xia Hang, who was watching the battle upstairs, was ashen-faced.

“It’s time to go...” Xia Hang gritted his teeth. He turned around and picked up his daughter, preparing to escape!

However, at this moment, Xia Hang suddenly felt an even more powerful internal qi coming from downstairs!

Xia Hang was stunned. He hurriedly leaned against the window and looked outside!

He saw an old man standing on this street.

“It’s... It’s him!” Seeing this old man, Xia Hang’s eyes instantly widened!
