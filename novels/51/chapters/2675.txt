Chapter 2676: Heavily Injured

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“Is this what you rely on? The power of the other Heart of Saint Kingdom in your body. ”

He immediately realized that this was not a simple resurrection.

Qin Yu’s condition had even returned to his previous peak state. However, Gu Ying keenly felt that something seemed to have happened to Qin Yu’s body.

At this moment, his internal qi was full of violence. The holy energy in his body flowed out of every pore uncontrollably as if he had gone mad. “Elder Gu Ying, this kid’s condition doesn’t seem right.”

Gu Yi also noticed some clues and reminded him from the side.

“He suffered a backlash from that saber. How could he withstand such a powerful saber of death with his current cultivation realm?”

Gu Ying sneered. The stronger the power, the stronger the backlash.

The power of a cultivation realm that was not compatible with ownself would be like the current Qin Yu.

Only when one’s divine soul was strong enough to reach a certain cultivation realm, then only could one completely suppress this sequence of laws. Qin Yu was currently just in the early stage of the Dao Consciousness Realm. This kind of attack power had already surpassed his body realm by too much.

Strong Demon Tremor Technique!

Fist energy struck Qin Yu’s chest, and his Tiger Wing blocked it at the last moment.

In an instant, a huge vibration came from his body. This huge and terrifying vibration force almost completely shifted his internal organs.

Fleeing Shadow!

A shadow flowed out of Qin Yu’s body, forcefully pulling him away from the small area affected by the Strong Demon Tremor Technique.

“He actually knows the movement technique of our Demon Sealing Valley.”

Gu Ying was furious. The movement technique of the Demon Sealing Valley was forbidden to outsiders. This had already involved the core secrets of the sect.

“It must be Elder Xin Yue who imparted it to him. Although the valley master has given the order, it seems that Elder Xin Yue has her ideas.”

A few roars suddenly came from behind Qin Yu. The other two inner court elders did not give Qin Yu any time to catch his breath.

rlIV0 qi waves had already hit his back.

He forcefully suppressed the restlessness in his divine soul.

He used the Ethereal Movement Technique again. The huge force sent his body dozens of meters away.

A large mouthful of blood flowed out of the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth uncontrollably. These elders were all at the Dao Consciousness Realm.

In terms of the cultivation realm, the elders could completely suppress him. Even if it was just an ordinary technique, the power contained in it was still huge.

“As expected, he’s at the end of his rope!”

Gu Ying sneered.

Logically speaking, he shouldn’t have to be so cautious with his peak Dao Consciousness Realm.

It was just that Qin Yu’s Dusk Saber just now had brought him great pressure. In addition, Qin Yu had two Hearts of Saint Kingdom on him.

Even his Tai Chi Seal was broken by the saber.

Moreover, he was not sure about the power of the other Heart of Saint Kingdom. That was why he did not dare to take the risk.

Xuan De moved and appeared in front of Qin Yu.

His body was as light as a willow branch. His figure was extremely fast.

He had been injured by Qin Yu’s power of Saint Kingdom from the start. He had recovered now, completely revealing his powerful strength.

Qin Yu stood still.

Although he could lock on Xuan De now, his condition was extremely poor and he was unable to take the initiative to face the enemy.

After changing his position several times, Xuan De no longer hesitated.

His body accelerated once again. Then, he leaped into the air and slapped down with his palm.

Swoosh!

Qin Yu’s Tiger Wing slashed out once again, directly slashing at Xuan De’s palm.

Qin Yu saw through the sneak attack, but a sinister smile appeared on Xuan

De’s face.

A green talisman appeared in his palm. It blocked the tip of the Tiger Wing’s blade like a living thing.

Then, the densely packed runes around the talisman crawled toward the saber like tadpoles. In the blink of an eye, the runes had already swam to Qin Yu’s body.

The talisman was suppressed in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, followed by the eruption of poisonous mist.

It invaded Qin Yu’s body. His skin was visibly withered and aged. Even his divine soul felt dizzy, and he spat out a mouthful of black blood again.

“Poison Curse.”

Xuan De had succeeded in his attack, so he did not continue.

Instead, he retreated and gathered with Gu Ying and the other elders.

“He won’t be able to hold out much longer under my Poison Curse.”

Gu Yi also nodded slightly. This Poison Curse was an extension of the Order of Curse. Even people with a higher cultivation realm than Xuan De would find it troublesome, let alone Qin Yu.

Qin Yu’s breathing began to become difficult. Blood slowly seeped out of his body and his eyes were filled with blood.

The Saint Power in his body surged out to resist the power of the Poison Curse.

However, his divine soul was suppressed by the power of destruction. His body was also forced to retreat in the face of the power of the Poison Curse. Blood slowly flowed from all parts of his body.

In a short period, a large pool of viscous black blood had gathered on the ground.

“Hua Tian, I’m already in such a state. Don’t you dare to take my Heart of Saint Kingdom?”

Qin Yu laughed loudly. He had already seen Hua Tian.

However, he did not expect Hua Tian to be so cautious. Even with Qin Yu’s current state, he still did not make a move.

“Hahahaha! As you wish, Qin Yu.”

Hua Tian’s fat body fell to the ground.

He stared at Qin Yu with a smile. He had many tricks up his sleeve.

He even obtained the black lotus clone and the Sword of Prajna.

With the help of the Great Expansion Divine Technique, he had been appointed by Dan.

Qin Yu, who was seriously injured, was the best gift Dan could give him. He would have to take the last Heart of Saint Kingdom himself.

“Sister, who do you think will win?”

On a distant mountain peak, two women, one big and one small were looking at the Demon Sealing Valley in the distance.

If someone saw this, they would be extremely surprised. This place was extremely far from the Demon Sealing Valley, but they could see it with a single glance.

Zi Yan shook her head and did not say anything.

She was carrying a stone tablet on her back, which looked very strange.

“This monk is really bad. He took advantage of someone else who was seriously injured. Even if he won, it would be an unfair victory.”

The girl said angrily.

“Let’s go. It doesn’t matter who wins or loses. However, that person survived in the domain of Ten Directions Annihilation as a Dao Consciousness. I think he might have a chance.”

Zi Yan said with a smile.

“Sister, you’re lying. Other than Brother Feng, who else can survive in the Ten Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Directions Annihilation’s domain as a Dao Consciousness?”

The little girl stuck out her tongue, feeling that Zi Yan was lying to her.

“Haha! Let’s go. There are still many things to do. Someone has already gathered five Hearts of Saint Kingdom.”

Zi Yan glanced at Qin Yu again and did not continue the topic of the little girl.

“Sister, why should we kill people? I think some people are very good. I don’t want to kill people anymore..”
