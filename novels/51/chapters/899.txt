Chapter 900: Chapter 900, repairing the gap

Repairing the gap?

Li Yu was stunned for half a second, then he rushed to the gap.

After checking, the gap really disappeared!

This made Li Yu dumbfounded!

He repaired the gap of the arcane realm casually? And it was such a big arcane realm?

Who was this middle-aged man? ! He had such ability? !

“You... How did you do it? Who exactly are you? !”Li Yu questioned loudly.

The middle-aged man glanced at Li Yu and said indifferently, “You don’t have the qualifications to know who I am.”

“Then why did you help us?”Li Yu was even more puzzled.

The middle-aged man glanced at Yan Ruoxue in his arms, then smiled and turned around to leave.

Li Yu wanted to stop him, but he realized that the middle-aged man was extremely fast.

They were clearly very close to each other, but no matter how hard they tried, they could not get any closer.

They did not even pass through the exit before they disappeared into this secret realm.

Silence.

The surroundings were completely silent.

Only the sound of the leaves rustling could be heard.

Other than that, there was nothing else.

It was not something an ordinary person could do to repair a mystic realm.

Even a martial saint did not have such an ability.

“It’s broken.”Li Yu could not help but sigh in his heart. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He ran to Qin Yu’s side and waited quietly for him to wake up.

In the outside world.

Du Xuanyu had indeed arrived here.

However, because that mysterious middle-aged man had repaired the mystic realm, Du Xuanyu did not discover anything and turned around to leave.

In the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu only woke up in a DAZE at noon.

He rubbed his eyes and then stood up abruptly from the ground.

Qin Yu grabbed Li Yu’s shoulder and said anxiously, “Where’s Ruoxue? Where are the two people?”

Li Yu was silent for a moment and then could not help but sigh slightly.

“Hurry up and tell me!”Qin Yu shouted anxiously.

Li Yu said in a deep voice, “I can tell you, but you have to be mentally prepared.”

“Hurry up and tell me!”Qin Yu shouted angrily.

Li Yu sighed and said, “Those two people took Yan ruoxue away.”

“Damn it!”Hearing this, Qin Yu was instantly filled with anger!

He turned around and was about to leave the mystic realm.

At this time, Li Yu pulled Qin Yu and said coldly, “Where are you going?”

“I’m going to find Yan Ruoxue,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Li Yu said coldly, “I advise you to give up on this idea. The strength of those two middle-aged men is beyond your imagination.”

“So What? They are only at the martial saint stage,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Li Yu took a deep breath and said, “That middle-aged man repaired the secret realm casually. Do you still think they are martial saints?”

When he heard these words, Qin Yu, who was in a rage, was also stunned.

He knew very well what kind of strength it meant to repair the mystic realm so casually.

“Repairing the mystic realm so casually... didn’t you say that only those at the supreme level could repair the mystic realm?”Qin Yu turned around and stared at Li Yu as he said.

Li Yu nodded and said, “That is indeed the case under normal circumstances.”

“Could it be that those two people are at the supreme level?”Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes.

The Almighty realm was also known as the Soul Formation realm. In fact, their strength was far above that of a martial saint.

However, there were not many martial saints in this world, let alone the legendary Almighty Realm?

“Are you still planning to go? Even if you risk your life, you will never bring Yan Ruoxue back.”Li Yu snorted coldly.

Qin Yu instantly fell into silence.

Such a difference in strength made Qin Yu feel a deep sense of powerlessness.

Even Martial Saint Qin Yu found it difficult to enter, let alone a mighty figure?

Looking at Qin Yu’s slightly dispirited appearance, Li Yu could not help but Pat Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“Don’t think too much. Those two people might not have any ill intentions.”Li Yu consoled him.

“Since they repaired the gap in the mystic realm before they left, I’m sure they don’t have any ill intentions. Otherwise, there’s no need to do this.”Li Yu said.

Qin Yu frowned as well.

Repaired the secret realm? Why did they do this?

Moreover... If they were people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, they would definitely kill him in passing.

If a mighty figure wanted to kill a peak-stage martial marquis, perhaps they only needed a glance.

Qin Yu sat there for a long time without saying a word.

Countless doubts filled Qin Yu’s mind.

Li Yu didn’t know what to comfort him with, so he stood silently to the side.

A few hours later, Qin Yu stood up from the ground.

“Since I don’t know who took Yan Ruoxue, then I’ll look for them one by one,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“I’ll put this debt on all the forces that are targeting Yan Ruoxue! I’ll kill them all one by one!”

Yan Ruoxue’s disappearance had once again aroused the killing intent buried deep in Qin Yu’s heart.

That extremely cold killing intent made Li Yu Shiver involuntarily.

He did not waste any more time and immediately began the second round of cultivation.

After stepping into the half-step martial saint realm, Qin Yu’s strength had increased explosively.

Compared to the perfect stage of the Martial Marquis Realm, Qin Yu’s internal Qi had increased several times. In front of him, those at the same level as him were like ants.

For three whole days, Qin Yu had absorbed this yin heart. However, the increase in his cultivation base was only a tiny bit.

This could not help but make Qin Yu feel a trace of shock!

Half of the Yin Heart had only increased by so little. How many resources would it take to become a martial saint?

It was truly terrifying!

Even if a sect used the entire sect’s strength, it would still be difficult to create an advanced stage of the chaos body!

On this day, Qin Yu opened his eyes.

He took a deep breath and two rays of light shot out from his eyes.

Following that, Qin Yu walked to Li Yu’s side.

“What’s Wrong?”Li Yu asked with some doubt.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I plan to leave the mystic realm temporarily.”

“Leave the Mystic Realm?”Li Yu was stunned.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “I can’t get much improvement in the mystic realm. With my state of mind at this point, there’s no point in staying.”

“But... do you know what you will face when you go out?”Li Yu frowned and said.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Only when you are on the edge of life and Death can you improve your state of mind the fastest.”

“And... I need more resources.”
