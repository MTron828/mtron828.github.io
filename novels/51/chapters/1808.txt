1809 The Opportunity to Go to Zhongzhou

“A divine weapon left behind from ancient times?” Qin Yu and Jue Wu exclaimed at the same time.

They knew that this item was definitely extraordinary, but they didn’t expect it to have such a powerful background!

The dean nodded slightly and continued, “This item is not called Glided Rake, but it is called the Divine Nine Peak Rake. It was made from divine iced iron.

“Its original owner was the ancient Tianpeng True Saint.”

After hearing what Dean Lei had said, Qin Yu’s was shocked!

What? Divine iced iron? Tianpeng True Saint?

Could this be the nine-toothed rake that Zhu Bajie had used?

It was impossible!

Qin Yu quickly denied this thought very quickly. Although he didn’t know how it was related, Zhu Bajie was just a fictional character and didn’t exist in reality.

Furthermore, if Zhu Bajie really existed, his strength could not possibly only be that of a True Saint.

“So it’s a Saint Weapon.” Jue Wu suddenly understood.

The dean nodded slightly and continued, “There are differences between Saint Weapons. For example, the Divine Nine Peak Rake is one of the top-tier Saint Weapons. It’s not something that other Saint Weapons can compare to.”

“Dean, why did the Divine Nine Peak Rake have different colors in our hands?” Qin Yu asked hurriedly.

“It’s related to one’s strength. When a Reversed Void Stage cultivator is holding it, it’s golden in color. But their original color is silver,” Dean Lei explained.

Qin Yu was silent. In that case, they had a Saint Weapon in their hands.

If he had this Saint Weapon, wouldn’t he be able to help Xiao Sheng?

“Of course, this Saint Weapon hasn’t been resurrected yet. Thus it can’t unleash its Holy Power.” Dean Lei poured another bucket of cold water on him.

Jue Wu muttered, “Then how do we resurrect it?”

Dean Lei laughed loudly and said, “A Saint Weapon is naturally resurrected by chance. Otherwise, the Saint Weapon won’t be so precious.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He hurriedly took out the iron rod and handed it to Dean Lei.

“Dean Lei, please take a look at the origin of this iron rod,” Qin Yu said.

Dean Lei took the iron rod and examined it carefully. He said in a low voice, “The material of this item is indeed extraordinary, but I’m not sure what it is.”

“You don’t know either?” Qin Yu could not help but be stunned.

“There are only two possibilities,” Dean Lei nodded and said. “It’s either an ordinary metal rod or beyond my experience.”

Qin Yu was silent.

This iron rod was definitely not an ordinary object! It was because when Qin Yu was undergoing his tribulation, it had once displayed extremely terrifying effect. It was just like a completely resurrected Saint Weapon! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Thank you very much, Dean.” Qin Yu cupped his hands and took back the iron rod.

“Alright. Thank you. I’ll treat you to a meal some other day. We won’t disturb you any longer,” Jue Wu said with a smile.

After saying this, she pulled Qin Yu and left.

“Wait.”

At this moment, the dean suddenly called out.

Qin Yu and Jue Wu looked back at him at the same time, waiting for him to continue.

“Jue Wu, you stay back,” Dean Lei said.

Jue Wu pointed at the tip of her nose and muttered, “I stay back?”

“That’s right. It’s you.” Dean Lei nodded slightly.

Qin Yu was a tactful person. After he cupped his hands, he walked out first and waited quietly outside the door.

After more than an hour.

Jue Wu walked out from inside.

“How is it? What did the dean want from you?” Qin Yu asked.

Jue Wu scratched her head and said, “He didn’t say anything. He just raised his hand and placed it on my forehead. It lasted more than an hour.”

“On your forehead?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Jue Wu waved her hand and said, “Forget about him. He’s just a strange old man. Who knows what he’s thinking?”

Qin Yu was speechless.

Only Jue Wu would dare to call the dean of Thunder Courtyard a strange old man.

The two of them did not stay in the first main peak for long and quickly left.

After returning to the cave abode, Qin Yu took out the magical artifact he had brought back from Yang Yu’s house.

Inside the bottle, there were more than 30 primordial spirits. Each primordial spirit was like a sleeping firefly. They did not move in the magical artifact at all, but they were full of vitality.

“These primordial spirits are clearly full of vitality, but they are not moving at all. Are they alive or dead?” Qin Yu murmured.

He was a little conflicted.

What if the primordial spirits in the bottle were still alive? Should he let them go or devour them?

But this struggle only lasted for a few minutes.

It was unknown if it was due to the pressure from the chaotic body in Zhongzhou or his inner demons, but Qin Yu took out the primordial spirit and devoured it without hesitation.

The moment he devoured the primordial spirit, the little person sitting cross-legged in Qin Yu’s mind shone even brighter. It was like a big Buddha bathed in golden light.

What followed was the improvement of Qin Yu’s divine sense.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s primordial spirit had surpassed his cultivation realm, and he was only one step away from the Reversion Void Stage.

Devouring primordial spirit seemed to be able to increase the speed of cultivation tremendously.

Qin Yu’s body seemed to be out of his control. In the blink of an eye, he had devoured five primordial spirits.

After devouring the five primordial spirits, Qin Yu seemed to have fallen into madness.

He seemed to have totally lost his mind as he stared greedily at the primordial spirits in the bottle.

“Hey!”

Fortunately, at this time, Jue Wu slapped Qin Yu’s head, which made Qin Yu instantly come back to his senses.

He looked at the few primordial spirits that went missing from the bottle and felt a lingering fear.

“I felt like falling asleep just now…” Qin Yu murmured.

He even felt his body being controlled by another person.

Qin Yu shook his head hard and quickly put away the bottle of the magical artifact.

“You have to control this thing well. Otherwise, I will have to go and look out for it again,” Jue Wu muttered.

Qin Yu nodded. He took a deep breath and said, “Jue Wu, help me take care of this.”

“That’s fine,” Jue Wu agreed.

Therefore, Jue Wu kept away the bottle of the magical artifact in her Spatial Magic Artifact.

In the following few days.

Qin Yu stayed in the cave abode cultivating.

With the help of dragon blood, Qin Yu’s cultivation advanced rapidly.

With the help of the extremely powerful primordial spirits, Qin Yu feel he was being assisted by the gods.

In just a few days, Qin Yu felt he was about to step into the half-step Reversion Void Stage.

“If I have enough dark energy, I can probably step into the half-step Reversion Void Stage immediately,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just as Qin Yu was thinking of leaving Thunder Courtyard, for the time being, he heard Xiaobai’s voice coming from outside.

Qin Yu quickly stood up and walked out.

When he arrived at the entrance of the cave abode, Xiaobai said with a smile, “Qin Yu, I have good news for you.”

“What good news?” Qin Yu was puzzled.

“Didn’t you always want to go to Zhongzhou? You have an opportunity now,” Xiaobai said.
