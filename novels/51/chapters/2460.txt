2461 Four-Winged Monster Race

These flying things were very strange as if wings had grown on a monkey’s brain.

Enormous bone spikes covered the body of the monster race general.

Amid the movement of the bone spikes on the tail, the friction with the ground made a sharp sound, and the ground that came into contact with it completely turned into powder.

He reached out his massive hands and grabbed a dozen brains, swallowing them like eating apples.

With crunching sounds, he swallowed hundreds of these strange flying brains.

“It’s too weak, too weak. However, there are still a few third-level living beings. Let Cang Ming and the others destroy them. There are also a few decent humans on the Heavenly Origin Continent. Let the people around them encircle them as well…”

He said vaguely. As he spoke, his brain suddenly split into left and right.

Thousands of flying brains flew out again. The vast amount of information in these brains flashed and disappeared from the hall in the blink of an eye.

At this moment, in the Solitary Shadow Continent next to the Fire Unicorn Continent, Qin Yu and the rest were again blocked by the monster race army.

Qin Yu’s expression turned ugly after seeing the army he was facing this time clearly.

Nearly hundreds of thousands of monster race armies were before them. Moreover, they were different from the ones they had encountered earlier.

The formation of these monster race armies was so organized that it was frightening. Not only did their figures and appearance look alike, but their strength was almost all above the power of True Saint.

Hundreds of thousands of True Saint monster races gathered together, which was indeed incomparably terrifying.

“Be careful. Look at this monster race army. The ones in front of us are four-winged. Almost all of them have comprehended the domain’s fifth-grade True Saint. The two-winged monster race behind us is above True Saint. Regardless of four-winged or two- winged, their strength is ridiculously close. Even the most orderly human army would find it difficult to find such an organized army.”

When Lei Xin’s divine sense swept across this army, he looked shocked.

He discovered that not only their strength, but their demonized bodies were also almost identical, including the bone spikes on their backs.

The muscle dimension and even the size of their bodies seemed to have been completely replicated.

“These monster race armies are different from previously. They seem to have been transformed by some power. We must be more careful.”

Flower Granny also sensed danger facing these army-like True Saint monster race living beings.

Although their strength individually was far above them, it was hard to say what would happen once they charged forward.

“Screech!”

With a shrill scream, nearly 1,000 of the four-winged monster race rushed over.

Nearly a thousand of them spread their four wings, and the killing intent on their bodies merged into one.

It was as if there were thousands of soldiers charging forward.

“Kill!”

Amid the boundless killing intent, everyone’s divine sense seemed to have an illusion.

In the sea of blood, countless living beings were rotting and stinking.

A bloody battlefield appeared in everyone’s sea of consciousness, and they could smell blood.

After the domain power of these people combined, the domain materialized, turning the bloody battlefield into something material. In the face of such a condensed killing intent, only Qin Yu, Lei Xin, Flower Granny, and the others who had experienced thousands of battles were unaffected.

Was this the real battlefield?

The others were more or less shocked. Even Yan Ruoxue’s heart trembled slightly. Due to the shock, everyone’s combat strength, including Yan Ruoxue, was significantly reduced.

In the instant of shock, the thousand monster race had rushed less than a thousand meters away. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Let me do it!”

Yan Ruoxue was a little annoyed. It was indeed a little embarrassing to be intimidated just now.

This flaw would be enough to cause her to lose her life if she had encountered a more powerful opponent!

Yan Ruoxue’s face was as cold as ice. She moved her arm slightly and enlarged her sleeve hundreds of times.

Her snow-white sleeves shuttled back and forth among the nearly one thousand four-winged monster race. The ten thousand-foot- long white silk shuttled back and forth like a python, surrounding this group of monster race like a long river.

“Boom!”

A spatial storm.

The sleeve suddenly turned and shook. As the sleeve shook, countless spatial storms stirred up like hurricanes. It was a tremendous spatial storm, and even the hardest treasure would be cut in an instant.

“Sister-in-law Ruoxue is so amazing.”

Chang Mang was stunned.

It was like a blizzard in the space before them. Flesh and blood could be seen splattering inside, but the violent power did not affect them at all.

It was Yan Ruoxue’s ultimate control of the power of rules. It was incomparably precise and full of killing intent.

In an instant, the four-winged monster race in the space only left a pile of empty skeletons behind.

Nearly 200 of the four-winged monster race were heavily injured, and they suddenly retreated and gathered with the monster race army again.

Yan Ruoxue panted slightly. Such a large-scale attack had consumed a lot of her energy.

Qin Yu came to her side with a frown. He grabbed her delicate hands and injected the pure medicinal qi from the Sumeru Space into her body.

It was the fusion of the Green Spirit Tree’s fruit and the medicinal qi of Xiaoru, Little Fatty, and the others. It was tremendously effective in healing.

The clash was not as simple as it seemed. Yan Ruoxue was also injured.

“The four-winged monster race has very similar domain powers. Therefore, when they attack, a part of their power seemed to be able to link together.”

The domain power of a monster race was nothing, but the power of more than a thousand connected domains was tremendously terrifying.

Although it was not as terrifying as adding one by one, it was still a massive killing intent when it added up together. This was the terror of the battlefield.

Even if one’s strength and cultivation were at the top of the battlefield, there was still the risk of dying.

Yan Ruoxue pouted as she looked at Qin Yu, causing Qin Yu to feel heartache.

“Honey, it’s okay. I’ll deal with these b*stards later.”

“In the great war that lasted five years of the Path of Heaven, there were mighty realm cultivators among the human race who specialized in creating a joint attack technique on the battlefield. Like the monster race, they even linked the power of rules together. Now, the monster race seems to have such a prototype. This is not good.”

Lei Xin’s expression was solemn. The joint attack technique not only required the coordination of the troops but also had strict requirements on the cultivation method.

With the number of the monster race, it would not be good news for the human race if they knew this joint attack technique.

It was unknown how the monster race transmitted their orders, but they charged again in less than ten breaths.

This time, nearly 3,000 monster race soldiers were charging, 1,000 four-winged leading 2,000 two-winged monster race soldiers.

As the horn sounded, the monster race army charged again.

This time, with almost 2,000 two-winged monster race soldiers joining in, the charging strength elevated significantly.

“Lei Xin, attack together with me.”

Flower Granny frowned and said.
