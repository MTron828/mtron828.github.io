Chapter 405: Inner Strength Grandmasters Were Not Worth Mentioning Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

At this moment, Qin Yu was like an undefeatable war god. None of their methods were able to stop Qin Yu’s slaughter!

“Young Master Yan, save us quickly!”

Seeing Qin Yu rushing over, everyone panicked!

In their desperation, they could only turn to Yan Haoran!

However, Yan Haoran wasn’t like Yan Jinyao. He simply didn’t have the strength to fight against Qin Yu!

At this moment, he couldn’t even protect himself, so how could he care about them?

“Pa!”

Before he could finish shouting, a crisp sound was heard.

Qin Yu’s golden palm swung over and he smashed the other party’s head into pieces.

Fresh blood splattered for a few meters, and the scene was extremely gruesome.

In a short hour, more than ten peak Inner Strength Grandmasters had all died under Qin Yu’s hands!

As he looked at the corpses all over the ground, Yan Haoran’s expression was extremely ugly.

He had never imagined that the first time he left Jingdu, he would encounter such a bloody battle!

Qin Yu’s body had already been drenched in blood, and his pair of bright eyes were like stars hidden in a black cloud as they flickered with light.

And his shining eyes were currently looking at Yan Haoran coldly.

Feeling his cold gaze, Yan Haoran’s body couldn’t help but tense up.

Qin Yu slowly walked towards Yan Haoran.

Every step was a kind of torment to Yan Haoran.

He suppressed the fear in his heart and tried his best to speak calmly, “Qin Yu, I’m different from the two Han family members that you killed. I’m from the Yan family. If you kill me, it will definitely cause a huge uproar.”

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you think I care?”

Yan Haoran’s face instantly turned pale!

He was different from Han Wei. Although Yan Haoran had extraordinary strength, he had grown up under the protection of the family since childhood and had lived a pampered life.

He had never encountered any danger.

Now that he felt the imminent danger, it was impossible not to be afraid.

Looking at Yan Haoran’s slightly trembling body, Qin Yu raised his hand and slowly patted Yan Haoran’s shoulder.

Just from the pat on his shoulder, Yan Haoran was so scared that he staggered and fell to the ground.

“Hahahaha!”

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“The young master of an aristocratic family is just a coward,” Qin Yu sneered.

Qin Yu’s ridicule made Yan Haoran feel ashamed.

He wanted to get up from the ground, but his body wasn’t under his control.

“Don’t be afraid. After all, you are Yan Ruoxue’s younger brother, so I won’t kill you.” Qin Yu said indifferently.

“But you must remember, I spared you because of Yan Ruoxue, not because of the powerful Yan family.”

“The so-called prestige of the Yan family is worthless in front of me.”

Yan Haoran didn’t say a word. At this moment, he didn’t even dare to look at him, let alone talk to him.

“Get lost,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Yan Haoran struggled to get up from the ground. His trembling legs looked extremely comical.

“Oh right.” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly called out to Yan Haoran.

“Go back and tell Yan Sihai that if he is willing to return Ruoxue to me, I can consider letting the Yan family go,” Qin Yu said indifferently.

His words were extremely arrogant and domineering.

There was no one else in the world who was bold enough to challenge the Yan family.

Yan Haoran’s body paused, then he quickly got into the car and left.

While looking at the corpses on the ground, Qin Yu immediately searched the bodies.

Unfortunately, the treasures on these people were all broken by Qin Yu.

“Maybe I don’t need to live this kind of life anymore.” Feeling the surging power in his body, Qin Yu was full of confidence.

Although an Inner Strength Grandmaster wasn’t enough for him to go to Jingdu and challenge the Yan family, Qin Yu wasn’t afraid of the Yan family’s pursuit anymore.

“I didn’t scare you, did I?” Qin Yu walked to Xiao Yu’s side and asked with a smile.

Xiao Yu was unusually calm. She shook her head and said, “I don’t know why, but I don’t feel anything at all.”

“You don’t feel anything at all?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

This shocked him greatly!

One had to know that last time, Xiao Yu was as timid as a mouse. This time, she was so indifferent to such a gruesome scene. This was definitely not something an ordinary person could do. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Could it be that... it had something to do with that mask?

Qin Yu took out the mask from his Spatial Magic Artifact and returned it to Xiao Yu.

“Safekeep this mask,” Qin Yu said.

Xiao Yu took the mask and nodded. “I understand.”

“Let’s go. I’ll send you back,” Qin Yu said.

The two of them left the battlefield.

Qin Yu personally sent Xiao Yu home and hurried back.

He had single-handedly killed more than ten peak Inner Strength Grandmasters, and he had done it in a crushing manner.

Once this news was spread, it would definitely cause a huge commotion.

But this time, Qin Yu didn’t want to keep a low profile. He even hoped that this news would spread as quickly as possible.

...

Yan Haoran rushed back to Jingdu overnight.

When he returned home, he was covered in blood, and he was in a wretched state.

All the servants in the house were so scared that their faces turned pale and they shouted.

“Haoran, what... what happened to you?” Seeing Yan Haoran’s appearance, Yan Tianhong couldn’t help but turn pale with fright.

“Are you hurt? Call the doctor quickly!” Yan Tianhong shouted.

Yan Haoran waved his hand and said, “Dad, this is someone else’s blood.”

“What’s going on?” Yan Tianhong frowned and asked.

Yan Haoran was silent for a moment and said, “I want to see my uncle.”

“See your uncle?” Yan Tianhong looked at the time and shook his head. “He’s already asleep at this time.”

“This is a serious matter. I must see him immediately,” Yan Haoran said stubbornly.

Then, Yan Haoran drove toward Yan Sihai’s home.

When he arrived at Yan Sihai’s home, Yan Sihai’s wife, Zhang Yin, was still awake.

She was wearing a lavish nightgown and was sitting on the sofa while sipping red wine.

As Yan Sihai’s wife, her personality and Yan Sihai’s were naturally the same. Both of them were vicious and ruthless.

“Haoran, what’s wrong?” Seeing Yan Haoran covered in blood, Zhang Yin was a little shocked.

Yan Haoran quickly bowed and said, “Auntie, is my uncle asleep? I have something important to tell him.”

Zhang Yin smiled nonchalantly and said, “What’s so urgent? Your uncle has been busy for a whole day and has already rested.”

Yan Haoran gritted his teeth and said, “Auntie, this matter is very important. I have to tell my uncle as soon as possible.”

Zhang Yin sized up Yan Haoran and said, “You know your uncle’s character and temper very clearly. Who dares to disturb his sleep? If there’s anything, you can tell me. I can make the decision.”

Yan Haoran no longer hid the truth. He immediately told Zhang Yin what happened.

After Zhang Yin heard it, she couldn’t help but say coldly, “You mean... Qin Yu killed more than ten peak-stage Inner Strength Grandmasters?”

“Yes! And they didn’t even have the power to fight back!” Yan Haoran said in shock.

When she heard this, a hint of coldness flashed across Zhang Yin’s face.

“Qin Yu is a bit interesting. I want to go and meet him,” Zhang Yin said in a low voice.

Speaking up to this point, Zhang Yin looked at Yan Haoran and said, “Haoran, go back and rest first. Tomorrow, I will personally meet Qin Yu.”
