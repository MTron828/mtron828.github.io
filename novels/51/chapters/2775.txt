Chapter 2776: The Reunion with Chang Mang

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu calmed down looking at the old man’s thoughtful eyes.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s left hand was already left with the last piece of bone.

The power of ‘start again’ was used up three times.

One for the first time, one for the second time, and three for the third time.

In other words, this was his last chance.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and threw all his distracting thoughts away.

He placed all his attention on this question. What would he do if it was him?

He seemed to be able to see the child who was waiting anxiously for his father to return.

He saw the wife who supported the entire family with difficulty.

They did not give up. They were waiting for their father and the other half to return.

Even when they were bullied, they did not give up.

They still firmly believed the person they had been waiting for would eventually appear.

But da*n it! That guy went to search for his ‘ultimate Dao’.

A boundless rage surged into Qin Yu’s chest.

“F*ck you, beast! You abandoned your wife and child to pursue your Dao, you stupid idiot!”

Qin Yu kicked Bai Zizai’s chest.

Then, he slapped the old man’s face.

“The fact that you can ask this question means that you’ve thought about it more than once. You already have the answer to abandoning your wife and children. Why are you here looking for your psychological comfort?”

Qin Yu’s pupils were scarlet as he panted heavily.

His parents had not been by his side since he was young, so he could empathize with the child’s pain.

“F*ck you! Your Dao has been cultivated to your stomach! A fool like you can actually cultivate to such a realm. This is the greatest injustice of the heavens!”

Qin Yu’s rain-like fists landed on Bai Zizai’s face.

Since he couldn’t resist, he would vent his anger before he died.

“Big brother! My good brother! What are you doing?”

Chang Mang was standing behind Bai Zizai. He was so stunned that he couldn’t react in time.

Qin Yu used all his strength in every punch.

Qin Yu only sat down casually after he fought to the limit.

Blood kept flowing out of Bai Zizai’s face, but his expression was terrifyingly calm.

At this moment, he was staring at Qin Yu quietly. The atmosphere seemed to be extremely heavy.

Qin Yu’s internal qi was also rising. Since this person could instantly decide life and death, this kind of pressure could even make a person collapse directly.

“You’re right. This kind of person really deserves to die.”

After a long time, a faint voice sounded in front of him.

It was as if a century had passed. Qin Yu felt like he was about to collapse.

A voice came from Qin Yu’s front.

Bai Zizai had already gone far down the mountain. Qin Yu could no longer see him.

Only one sentence sounded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness in that space.

“The karma of the Buddhist Kingdom’s Faramita was uneasy to be received. Be prepared to bear the karma since you’ve used this power.”

Chang Mang and Aiden fell to the ground. Their faces were pale.

Aiden seemed to be weak and his face was covered in sweat.

“FöCK, I miss you Drat so much!”

Qin Yu’s fist slammed into Chang Mang’s chest.

“Master Qin Yu, I have to hand it to you. It’s the first time in years that someone dared to attack Bai Zizai. What’s even more shocking is that you survived. Da*n it! I’m not as tired as I am today even after challenging ten top-notch martial artists in a row.”

Chang Mang slumped to the ground. The shock from earlier had instantly dispersed his feelings of reunion.

Qin Yu shook his head with a bitter smile and looked at the ‘start again’ bracelet on his left hand.

After hesitating for a moment, Qin Yu still did not say it.

It would be troublesome to explain such a thing. It might even bring trouble to Chang Mang.

“F*ck! I’m also dumbfounded.”

Aiden was also terrified.

Everything that had just happened had a huge impact on him.

“You might be the only person who has survived from the hands of the number one kulapati in the past few hundred years. No one will survive if he asks questions, even those who have cultivated the peak power.”

Chang Mang said with a bitter smile.

“What kind of monster is the guy? Do you have any information about him?” Qin Yu asked with a chill.

“I don’t know. Even the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets doesn’t know where he came from. It’s as if he suddenly arrived in this Saint Kingdom and came to the Nine Nether Cliff long ago. He’s been living on the mountain peak. There are at least tens of thousands of heads in that space. I only know that he is called the number one scholar and Bai Zizai is his name.” Chang Mang said while his hair was standing on end.

“By the way, why are you here?”

Chang Mang was curious.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I received news of you in Lingxu City and thought of coming over to search for you, but I didn’t expect these things to happen.” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

The operation this time was simply soul-stirring.

Qin Yu would probably be like the pile of skeletons at the top of the mountain if the monk had not given him the two bracelets. His scolding might have accidentally touched Bai Zizai, so he left him alive.

“I didn’t expect it to be so long after the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect battle.

I wonder how the others are doing.”

Chang Mang felt a rare sense of nostalgia.

“Let’s not talk about this. I heard you’ve become one of the four leaders of the Guardian of Order.”

Qin Yu said in surprise.

“To be specific, they took the initiative to find me. Of course, I accepted it for convenience’s sake. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have known there was such a good place. However, the higher-ups of the Guardian of Order are getting harder and harder to fool recently. They’ve arranged more and more missions for me.”

Chang Mang chuckled. “It still has to be you.”

Qin Yu was speechless.

“Come! Cut the crap. Let’s see how strong you are now. Don’t disappoint me!”

Before he could finish his words, Chang Mang had already struck out with his palm.

Ethereal.

Qin Yu’s body rose up and floated.

As his strength improved, his understanding of the three movement techniques- Lin Bo, Fleeing Shadow, and Ethereal, also became more and more profound.

Chang Mang didn’t manage to do anything with this palm.

“Good!”

Chang Mang bared his teeth as purple lightning erupted from his body.

In an instant, his internal qi climbed to the peak. A purple lightning exploded in front of Qin Yu.

A terrifying force struck his chest.

What a terrifying speed! Qin Yu’s expression froze.

Silver holy energy exploded from Qin Yu’s body. Chang Mang’s palm seemed to have hit a thick piece of leather.

Pa!

Hundreds of crisp sounds of bones cracking rang out from Chang Mang’s body..
