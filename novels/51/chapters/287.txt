Gu Taichu laid on the bed and his face looked extremely weathered.

At a glance, he looked like an ordinary farmer in the fields.

Qin Yu didn’t know how to comfort Gu Taichu, although he had some regrets inside.

After all, the effects of the Enlightenment Tea were too alluring.

Moreover, different talents brought different effects to the Enlightenment Tea.

If he consumed the three pieces of the Enlightenment Tea, Qin Yu might become powerful enough to find Han Wei directly.

“Master Gu, don’t be too sad,” Qin Yu comforted him.

Gu Taichu looked at Qin Yu with some guilt in his eyes.

He put his hand on his forehead and said in a low voice, “Qin Yu, I owe you this.”

Qin Yu shook his head and smiled. “Master Gu, you can’t say that. In the face of temptation, you still kept your promise for so many years. It’s enough to make people admire you.”

Gu Taichu said with some surprise, “Do you really think so?”

Qin Yu nodded seriously and said, “What I said is true. Moreover, there were always opportunities.”

When he heard that, Gu Taichu couldn’t help but sit up from the bed.

He had a bitter smile on his face. He seemed to think that his behavior was a little ridiculous.

“I can’t just let things go like this.” Gu Taichu’s expression became a little cold.

Qin Yu frowned. “Master Gu, what do you want to do?”

Gu Taichu said coldly, “Housecleaning!”

...

In a private room, Chi Feng was lying comfortably on a rocking chair.

He had never thought that he would be able to step into this realm one day, and even surpass his master, Gu Taichu!

“With my current realm level, it’s enough for me to establish my position in Bin Province and even the Jiang Bei region,” Chi Feng said with a nonchalant smile.

Even Gu Taichu could be called a master, so why couldn’t he?

Although that was the case, he still lacked an opportunity to turn the situation around. He lacked a chance to fight.

“Who should I look for?” Chi Feng touched his chin and whispered.

If he didn’t defeat a powerful opponent, how could he rise to the top?

At this moment, a voice suddenly came from outside the door.

Chi Feng’s perception was extremely sharp, and he knew who it was almost instantly.

“Gu Taichu?” Chi Feng raised his eyebrows, and then a cold smile appeared on his face.

“I was worried about an opportunity, but I didn’t expect someone to come to my door!”

After saying that, Chi Feng arrived at the door instantly.

At the door, Gu Taichu was looking at Chi Feng coldly. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Beside him were Qin Yu and Yao Qing.

“Master, why are you here?” Chi Feng said hypocritically.

Gu Taichu clenched his fists. His anger almost made him lose his mind.

However, as a master of a generation, Gu Taichu finally suppressed his anger.

“Chi Feng, shouldn’t you give me an explanation?” Gu Taichu said in a deep voice.

When he heard this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little uncomfortable.

Even at this moment, Gu Taichu still didn’t want to believe that Chi Feng had betrayed him.

He even wanted to give him a chance.

It was obvious that Gu Taichu had treated Chi Feng as his son.

Chi Feng sneered. “Explanation? What explanation? Why can’t I understand what you’re saying?”

Gu Taichu’s anger could no longer be contained!

Yao Qing, who was standing at the side, cursed out loud, “You’re really an ingrate! If it wasn’t for Master Gu, you would probably have ended up on the streets long ago.”

“Master Gu painstakingly raised you and even taught you all his skills, yet you’ve done such a heartless thing! Were is your conscience?!”

Yao Qing was filled with anger as he cursed!

Chi Feng glanced at Yao Qing and sneered. “Where did this savage come from?”

After saying that, Chi Feng waved his sleeve and a powerful force instantly rushed towards Yao Qing!

Yao Qing’s expression changed. He wanted to dodge, but it was too late!

“Clang!”

At this moment, Qin Yu blocked in front of Yao Qing.

He crossed his arms in front of him and forcefully blocked this attack.

The terrifying qi energy shook Qin Yu’s arm until it hurt.

Wounds appeared on his arm.

“As expected of an eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster.” Qin Yu frowned.

If he didn’t have this body, this qi energy would have smashed him into pieces!

“Huh? Where did this savage come from?” Chi Feng was a bit surprised.

“You’re only in the Inner Strength Master Hands realm, but you’re able to resist my attack. You’re really impressive.”

Qin Yu looked at Chi Feng coldly and said, “I’m Qin Yu, from Chuzhou.”

When he heard this name, Chi Feng suddenly understood.

“So you’re the King of Chuzhou, Qin Yu. Today, I will kill you, the rising star.” Chi Feng sneered.

“Enough!”

At this moment, Gu Taichu shouted!

He glared at Chi Feng and said, “Chi Feng, why did you steal the Enlightenment Tea? Why did you kill your seniors and juniors?”

Chi Feng sneered. “You’re already so old. Wouldn’t it be a waste to give you the Enlightenment Tea?”

“You keep saying that you treat me as your own son, but in the end, you kept the Enlightenment Tea for yourself!”

“How could you treat your own son like that, hmm?”

Chi Feng’s words made Gu Taichu furious!

Gu Taichu was so angry that his whole body was trembling!

He forced himself to calm down and said coldly, “Then why did you kill your seniors and juniors? They are your bros who spend time with you day and night. How could you be so heartless!”

“Hehe,” Chi Feng laughed coldly.

“Gu Taichu, don’t make yourself sound like a saint. Qin Yu killed Gu Jinhong. Not only did you not take revenge, but you even colluded with him. You still have the nerve to scold me?”

Gu Taichu was speechless and didn’t know how to answer him.

“Gu Taichu, I can spare your life on account of our past friendship. Get lost,” Chi Feng said indifferently.

However, Gu Taichu’s qi energy surged and he said coldly, “Chi Feng, you’re heartless. If I don’t kill you, my cultivation would be in vain!”

“Hahahaha!” Chi Feng couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Do you think you’re my match with your current strength? I know all your moves and my realm is one level higher than yours. What ability do you have to kill me?” Chi Feng narrowed his eyes and said.

Gu Taichu gritted his teeth and said, “Even if I have to risk my life, I’ll take you to h*ll with me!”

Chi Feng’s expression became even colder, and the corners of his mouth curled into a sneer.

“Gu Taichu, I’ve given you a chance. Since you want to die, then don’t blame me.” Chi Feng’s internal qi started to slowly rise.

“I happen to need someone in order to show my power. You’re a good candidate!”
