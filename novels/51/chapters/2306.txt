2307 Absorbing the Soul

The Soul Shattering Golden Radiance!

A golden sword energy directly slashed at the red lantern. This was the strongest way of the soul attack he comprehended in the Mystic Realm of Azure Firmament Sect.

Coupled with his terrifying divine sense, even a ninth-grade True Saint could not easily withstand this sword strike.

“Ding!”

The instant it clashed with the red lantern, Qin Yu felt his divine sense collide with a giant rock.

His soul became dizzy instantly, and blood flowed out of his mouth and nose.

As for the red lantern, it only trembled slightly before it slowly disappeared.

“What the hell is this red lantern?”

Qin Yu inexplicably panicked.

Could it be other living beings were in the ninth level of purgatory? This kind of soul strength was probably a situation of complete devastation and no survivors once one came into contact with its true body.

Qin Yu withdrew his divine sense.

After absorbing the soul power of the elderly man, his soul figurine had visibly grown a size larger. Furthermore, he could penetrate a bit of massive force when he released his divine sense.

He was no longer like an ordinary person who could only see a few meters away.

Qin Yu was overjoyed. His Soul Torment Mind Technique had a restraining effect on the souls, and his soul would definitely improve further if he absorbed more souls here!

“I’m ready.”

Xi Menn stood up.

A sword intent slowly condensed on his body, and it seemed even sharper than before.

He was like a sword about to be unsheathed at any moment. The violent sword intent was sealed in his body.

Under such circumstances, both of them had made ultimate preparations.

They could instantly kill anything that appeared here.

Qin Yu also unleashed the Saintly Body Technique to elevate his defense to the utmost limit.

Before them, a blue light suddenly flickered faintly.

As the two approached for a closer look, they realized it was a burning ghostly fire.

With a boom, the ghost fire suddenly exploded and condensed into a blue human figure.

A world-destroying aura suddenly emanated from the body of that figure, and he lightly extended a claw in a grasping motion.

In an instant, even space seemed to have frozen.

Even though Qin Yu used all his might, his feet were stuck as if trapped in deep mud, unable to move.

With a thought, Suo Lin’s shield turned into a giant shield in front of them, and the chaotic qi on Qin Yu’s body surged into the shield frantically.

The giant shield shook violently, but it only shielded for a moment.

The shield was immediately torn open with a large hole, and the giant claw grasped at the two.

“Boom!”

At this instant, Xi Menn finally could draw his sword. In that split-second, Xi Menn could finally draw his sword.

It was a simple stab.

It directly met the giant claw, and countless sword shadows erupted from the point of contact. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The sword and the claw shattered at the same time and disappeared.

Qin Yu’s Fist of Annihilation suddenly blasted out in this instant, directly landing on the blue figure.

Dozens of punches were ruthlessly thrown out, directly pounding down onto that blue figure. Flames of intense black fire ignited upon the figure’s body.

However, on his body, a stream of treasure light was flowing through.

The flames of annihilation could not possibly burn his core.

“Our power of rules is suppressed here. We can’t even unleash half of it!”

Qin Yu was tremendously furious.

In that treasure light, the blue figure’s fingers danced swiftly like butterflies, and traces of destructive internal qi slowly flowed out of his body.

“D*mn it! This remnant soul even knows a cultivation method!”

Qin Yu almost cursed out loud. Their cultivation methods were definitely not simple if these were remnant souls from the ancient battlefield.

After a few moments, an energy ball had already formed above the figure’s head.

Countless tiny lightning bolts surrounded the energy ball, and traces of tribulation internal qi occasionally emitted.

“Tribulation internal qi! I’m afraid we can’t withstand this cultivation method if it’s unleashed!”

Qin Yu was horrified.

Xi Menn held his sword horizontally and charged at the blue figure.

In just an instant, his figure seemed to have turned into an afterimage as he approached the figure at a tremendously slow speed.

It was actually a tremendously fast speed, like a fan showing signs of afterimages.

His body transformed into a sword, and a massive sword chant pierced through the blue figure like a dragon.

“Ah!”

That sound emitted a piercing howl. He grabbed the energy ball with one hand and was about to smash it at Xi Menn.

Qin Yu caught up in time. He instantly arrived before this remnant soul.

He crossed his index and middle fingers, and a stream of star power entered his hands.

“Star Seal!”

Qin Yu’s enhanced Star Seal blasted out fiercely, and a terrifying star power exploded on his body.

The treasure light on the ghost’s body finally shattered. Qin Yu grabbed the remnant soul with both hands.

The Soul Soul Torment Mind Technique Technique suddenly circulated.

He slowly devoured the remnant soul into his divine sense. This wisp of soul was much stronger than the elderly man’s soul previously.

Qin Yu spent half a day before he slowly fused that soul into his divine sense.

At this moment, the two figurines in his sea of consciousness were constantly digesting the vast amount of soul power.

At this moment, he could not care less to attend to the golden divine sense. He would give it to whoever could devour it.

The two divine sense figurines grew once again in less than half a day.

When he finished digesting it, his divine sense could penetrate a range of nearly ten meters.

“Are you cultivating the monster race’s cultivation technique, devouring their divine sense for your use?”

Xi Menn asked curiously.

Qin Yu shook his head and looked at Xi Menn with some caution.

Not everyone could accept such a cultivation method. This cultivation method would definitely be judged as a sin by Demon Slaying Peak if he was in the Holy Region.

“Be careful of the backlash of the soul.”

Xi Menn said softly.

The two dared not move forward for the time being. It was just a wisp of remnant soul at the outermost layer, but they almost used up all their strength.

Qin Yu was also not confident if he did not bring his condition to its best state.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s soul had already reached ninth grade. After accommodating two remnant souls, his soul expanded further.

After the two of them had rested up, they began to advance slowly again.

In nearly two months, they destroyed nearly 10 remnant souls.

The most dangerous was when one of the ghosts had a remnant soul with consciousness.

It almost destroyed both of them. Fortunately, Qin Yu’s Suo Lin’s shield blocked most of the attacks.

Even so, the two were severely injured and only slowly recovered after resting for about 10 days or so.

“How terrifying! We almost lost our lives in less than two hundred meters. As expected of the ninth level of purgatory!”

Qin Yu said with lingering fear.

Xi Menn’s sword energy was extremely destructive. A sword attack could usually injure these wandering souls.

And then Qin Yu would harvest them. Only with the cooperation of the two could they kill so many wandering souls.

After devouring ten or so souls, each nearly equivalent to a ninth-grade True Saint, Qin Yu could feel that the power of his soul had reached its limit.

Just like how people ate until they were full, there would be a capacity.

This feeling was as if there was a treasure trove in front of him, but he could not make use of it.

The Soul Demon Torment Mind Technique was once the masked woman’s core cultivation method.
