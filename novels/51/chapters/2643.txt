It also indicated that Qin Yu might not be a real threat to Wu Tian.

He only allowed Qin Yu to leave because his power of Saint Kingdom might harm him.

“Moreover, for you who possess the Seal of Heaven Returning, if you truly wish to ascend to the position of Lord of this Saint Kingdom, you must eliminate the traitor in this region. Otherwise, the power of the Saint Kingdom will continue to dissipate. Even if only the Saint Power that can be mobilized by a single Heart of Saint Kingdom remains, the power of the Saint Kingdom has been accumulated over long years, and every drop is extremely precious.” Immortal Emperor Yao rarely spoke so much at once to Qin Yu.

“Immortal Emperor Yao, you’re not harboring any intentions of taking over my body, are you? Why suddenly divulge so much information to me?”

Qin Yu’s expression was cautious. Previously, Immortal Emperor Yao’s words were always cryptic, never this forthcoming. His thoroughness this time raised Qin Yu’s suspicions.

“Haha, if you wish, you can interpret it as such.”

Immortal Emperor Yao laughed.

“However, I hadn’t anticipated that you would break through to the True Consciousness Realm so swiftly. Though your accomplishment is owed to the mark on your body, it’s all destiny. You now have the qualification to officially vie for the position of Lord in this Saint Kingdom. Should you perish, I’ll have to expend some effort to find a new host.”

“Immortal Emperor Yao, what have you been awaiting all these years?”

Qin Yu suddenly inquired. Over the millennia, many epochs of the Path of Heaven had passed since the death of Immortal Emperors.

The only remaining soul should be Immortal Emperor Yao alone.

Given his past splendor, why would he voluntarily forge his soul into a corpse? It defied logic.

After ages of waiting, just as Qin Yu was on the brink of surrender, Immortal Emperor Yao softly spoke.

“The truth. I desire to know the truth of what occurred back then. Why did each

Immortal Emperor who broke free from the Path of Heaven meet their demise? Why is it that no new Immortal Emperors can arise in this realm? Ignorance of these matters weighs heavily on my heart.”

“What truly transpired back then?”

“I’m unable to recall many memories. My recollection is pieced together from what I’ve observed. Moreover, with your current prowess, you’re not qualified to know…”

Immortal Emperor Yao trailed off, descending into silence once more.

Observing Immortal Emperor Yao’s silence, Qin Yu felt a twinge of melancholy.

According to his former understanding, following the Tribulation Seventh Level and entry into the Divine Realm, two paths presented themselves.

One was to become a Guardian, akin to his father. The other was to transcend the five elements Path of Heaven and ascend as an Immortal Emperor.

He harbored a desire to understand his father indirectly. Yet, as Immortal Emperor Yao stated, he was still too distant from such matters.

“Buddha Wu Tian, why didn’t you slay him?”

On the previously sealed land of ancient demons, Pang De furrowed his brow and said, seeming somewhat puzzled. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“The power of the top ten Order of Saint Kingdoms is very likely to cause fatal damage to me. After such a long time, the Saint Power has already assimilated most of my arm. Moreover, I can sense a terrifying consciousness hidden within this mark. It’s very likely that it’s the power that the original Holy Lord hid in this child’s body.”

Wu Tian, dressed in a black robe, shook his head slowly.

“However, there will naturally be a better option to deal with the outsider. That is to let the outsider deal with him. His Saint Power can only be used against the natives. You can come out now.”

Wu Tian smiled as he looked at an open space in front of him. Soon, a ripple of a fist appeared in the fog of the Ancient Demon Land.

A chubby figure walked out of the crowd. He put his hands together and bowed to Wu Tian.

“To be able to see through the concealment of the Great Expansion Divine Technique, you must be the greatest cosmic luck of my trip.”

Hua Tian rubbed his round belly and said with a smile.

Previously, he did not make a move at all. In the end, after stealing the victory baptism of Nine Tune City, his Great Expansion Divine Technique leveled up again. This time, he saw the huge cosmic luck here.

Moreover, this was the first time he felt his power of cosmic luck suppressing Qin Yu. That was why he took the risk to come here.

“The power of the Great Expansion Divine Technique is within the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom. That’s why your cultivation progress is so fast. I know that you’re coveting that person’s power. This time around, I’ll give you a helping hand and help you kill that guy here and receive his cosmic luck.” A black lotus with destructive power slowly floated out of Wu Tian’s hand.

Stopping in front of Hua Tian, Hua Tian’s expression froze. This Buddhist power made him feel like an ant.

“Is this the supreme treasure of Buddhism, the Black Lotus of Annihilation?”

The Black Lotus of Annihilation, originally a supreme treasure, was transformed from the Primordial Green Lotus. It was a twelfth-grade lotus throne, and it was also the only intact twelfth-grade lotus throne in Buddhism.

Hua Tian swallowed his saliva.

“That’s right. The black lotus is also a connate numinous treasure that can suppress cosmic luck. Accepting this power meant agreeing to accept my karma, or leaving. Choose one,” he said.

Wu Tian said slowly.

“As Wu Tian closed his Heavenly Eye, the Black Lotus of Annihilation shone with a dangerous light.

Hua Tian swallowed his saliva. He calculated for a moment. He had no hope of escaping from this force.

He immediately stretched out his hand, and the black lotus turned into a string of prayer beads that landed in his palm.

“Go. The Demon Sealing Valley is the place where you will kill him…’

Wu Tian said, then waved his hand and sent Hua Tian out of the Ancient Demon Land.

“What a terrifying fellow. No wonder he was able to force the Tathagata of Buddhism into reincarnation. However, he doesn’t seem to be in his perfect form. Moreover, he seems to be afraid of something on me.”

Hua Tian rubbed his bald head.

His hands formed a hand seal, and the world in front of him began to change.

A world formed by all kinds of cosmic luck appeared in front of him. In the Demon Sealing Valley, soaring cosmic luck spiraled up. The power of cosmic luck was biased towards his internal qi.

The black lotus in Hua Tian’s hand seemed to have sensed the internal qi of the Great Expansion Divine Technique. A force entered Hua Tian’s body. Immediately, the world in front of him zoomed in again, and he could even sense many minute details.

Crack!

Hua Tian’s soul suddenly made a loud sound of shackles cracking. The holy energy he had accumulated before entered his soul again. His soul was like a hungry man who hadn’t eaten for three days. Even after swallowing all the accumulated Saint Power, he still didn’t feel full.

“Hahahaha, the True Consciousness Realm! I didn’t expect that I, Hua Tian, would be able to grasp the Order of Saint Kingdom so easily and break through to the True Consciousness Realm!”

Hua Tian was a little surprised. He had onlv been able to sense this barrier

before.

He had vaguely grasped the power of ‘force’, but he did not expect that with the help of the black lotus, he would be able to grasp the Order of Rules in one go..
