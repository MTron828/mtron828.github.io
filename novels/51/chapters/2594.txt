Chapter 2595: Guard the City

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The demonic beasts and the human race were engaged in a battle at the west gate at this point.

On the city wall, scattered monster race living beings were charging up from time to time. The scene was somewhat like a siege in primitive tribal warfare.

Countless demonic beasts charged at the city walls, but the walls faintly shone with several formation star patterns, dissipating the terrifying power. Those who retreated without permission would be beheaded!

Those who failed to resist would be beheaded!

On top of the city wall, hundreds of commando teams moved around.

With every stroke of their blades, they had already killed nearly 20 soldiers who showed signs of fear and hesitation.

“What a terrifying blade! It even cut that armor into halves.”

Qin Yu gasped. Everything in this Saint Kingdom was tremendously hard.

Under the influence of the Saint power, even their bones had a qualitative change, let alone the armor they forged.

At this moment, under the effect of the eye of true vision.

Qin Yu could clearly see at least a thousand soldiers here.

There were about nine outsiders and most of them were from the demon race. He could tell from their attire.

Those not wearing armor were outsiders, and some seemed to have arrived earlier than Qin Yu.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He did not see Shen Qian and the others among these people. It was highly likely that for those who could defend the city, the soldiers would assign them to guard specific locations based on their strength.

Moreover, the strength of these nine people was not weak. Other than the demon race living beings, there were also two human race outsiders here.

One of them was a young man from the demon race who was wearing a green robe. This made Qin Yu’s hair stand on end. To him, this battlefield seemed to be playing a game.

Facing the charging ogres, it effortlessly slew them with ease.

It was so strong that Qin Yu could not believe it. He had obtained the Heart of Saint Kingdom and then killed Ni Fei by chance to control Hua Qianjie. That was why he had his current strength.

Qin Yu vaguely speculated that most people appearing here might have similar experiences with him, reaching the peak power of the first scene, thus refreshing and arriving at this place.

In other words, these people were outstanding individuals, and this could be inferred from their current strength.

“Roar!”

A loud and coarse roar interrupted Qin Yu’s thoughts. An ogre climbed up from the city wall, and its facial features were typically rugged and savage. Its face had rough skin, large and round eyes, and a wide, thick mouth. A lot of human flesh was hanging on the two huge fangs.

“You, block it.”

A commando soldier stopped behind Qin Yu.

Qin Yu picked up a dead soldier’s saber from the ground. No matter what, it was better than the current weapon.

He then rushed toward the ogre that was almost twice his size. Using the force of the clash, he pierced through the ogre’s heart. Qin Yu then twisted the hilt 90 degrees with all his might.

“What a tough body.”

Qin Yu was a little shocked. Even though the blade had already entered its body, he spent a vast amount of effort to crush the ogre’s heart.

“Snap!”

Two palms forcefully closed Qin Yu’s saber, and a tremendous force surged from the blade.

It threw the saber down the city wall. Fortunately, Qin Yu withdrew his hand in time and was not thrown down the city wall.

Before he could catch his breath, another row of ogres rushed over.

Two of them charged at him. After killing the two ogres, Qin Yu felt his body a little heavy.

Although the ogre was not as strong as the Black Bear King, it had at least 60% to 70% of its strength. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Moreover, once the ogre was provoked, even if its heart was broken or its body shattered, it would fight until the last moment.

“Fortunately, this ogre contains a lot of holy energy.”

Three strands of holy energy entered Qin Yu’s soul, and only then did he breathe a sigh of relief.

However, half of the power entered his Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, completely out of his control.

Qin Yu’s chest heaved up and down violently, and his arms trembled slightly.

However, this battlefield did not give him any chance to breathe.

Before he could clear this row of ogres, another seven or eight had already rushed up the city wall.

Before a soldier at the city wall could react, his head was taken off and thrown into his mouth to be chewed.

The most terrifying thing was that one of them was extremely huge.

It was almost twice the size of the other ogres.

As it swept out with the staff in his hand, the three soldiers in front of him instantly turned into minced meat, and a mist of blood sprayed onto Qin Yu’s face.

He walked toward Qin Yu step by step and dealt anyone who stood in his way with a stick.

Qin Yu was scared out of his wits. Even the three Bear Kings might not be comparable to this power. If he were to attack, he would probably end up like these human race soldiers.

Qin Yu grabbed his eyes. At this moment, the power condensed by the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze was not much. However, after using it, he could use it again. Perhaps he could avoid its attack.

However, this was his last trump card.

Before he could think about tactics, the ogre had already pounced at him, raising the metal iron rod in its hand high up and smashing it down at Qin Yu.

Although its size was huge, its speed was so fast that Qin Yu did not have time to react at all.

At this moment, the commando soldiers behind Qin Yu stepped forward.

With the crisp sound of a blade, the ogre’s body was directly cut into four pieces, and the soldier retreated again, returning to the commando sequence.

“Fortunately, this isn’t a life-or-death situation. Otherwise, if that ogre had come over, I’m afraid he would end up just like those soldiers with a single blow earlier. Moreover, his Heart of Saint Kingdom and the Seal of Heaven Returning haven’t finished cooling down yet. ”

Qin Yu’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. He had already given up resisting just now. Fortunately, the commando team behind him had made a move.

“Those who retreat without permission will die!”

A cold voice sounded behind Qin Yu.

Almost without giving him any breathing room, nearly twenty more ogres charged forward.

Qin Yu could not see the scene below the city at this moment, but he could roughly guess when he saw countless corpses being pulled away from the battlefield and the seemingly endless ogres.

He once again met the two ogres charging at him.

After cutting off the legs of an ogre directly, he stabbed the other ogre’s head, but it roared and smashed the stone in its hand on Qin Yu’s chest.

A massive force forcefully pierced through Qin Yu’s body, causing his face to turn pale.

Countless bones in his chest instantly broke. Fortunately, these broken bones did not pierce into his heart.

Almost without hesitation, Qin Yu used all his Saint power to restore his body..
