Chapter 710: 10,000-year-old Herbs Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

This full room was filled with the power of creation that Sect Master Hu had absorbed.

And most of this power of creation originated from Qing City.

In other words, the prosperity that Qing City should have had was forcibly taken away by Sect Master Hu.

“What a good method.” Even Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

The world was so big that there were all kinds of strange things. If one offended such a spell master, one might be unlucky for the rest of his life.

Qin Yu picked up a bottle of spiritual energy and then took a light breath.

The spiritual energy in the bottle flowed into Qin Yu’s body.

Sure enough, after long-term storage, it was quite similar to spiritual energy, and the method of absorption was also quite similar.

“This seems to be different from ordinary spiritual energy,” said Qin Yu.

Sect Master Hu nodded and said, “It is indeed different. According to the old saying, a place with dense spiritual energy is a place with outstanding people.”

“And the two words ‘spiritual energy’ in this sentence refers to the powers of creation. It is purer than the spiritual energy that we use for cultivation.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly. This powers of creation was indeed different. Compared to ordinary spiritual energy, it was easier to absorb, and the effect it brought was better than ordinary spiritual energy.

“I’ll take these powers of creation,” Qin Yu said as he looked at the jars on the wall.

Sect Master Hu’s pupils constricted. He hurriedly shook his head and said, “No, I can only give you three bottles!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you think you have the right to negotiate with me?”

Sect Master Hu’s expression turned a bit ugly. He seemed to be reluctant to part with the powers of creation.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to waste time with Sect Master Hu. He grabbed the bottle and put it into his Spatial Magic Artifact.

In this way, Qin Yu didn’t lack things for cultivation for the time being.

For the sources of spiritual energy, he had Iceheart and the power of creation.

And dark energy relied on that coffin.

“I should have killed you, but since you’ve provided me with so much power of creation, I’ll spare your life.” Qin Yu glanced at Sect Master Hu and said.

After saying this, Qin Yu planned to leave.

At this moment, Sect Master Hu’s eyes shone brightly! A sharp blade appeared in his hand!

“Go to hell!” Sect Master Hu roared. He held the sharp blade in his hand and stabbed it fiercely at Qin Yu’s body!

“Clang!”

However, not only did the sharp blade not enter Qin Yu’s body, but it was directly split into two!

Qin Yu slowly turned his body and sneered. “You want to kill me with this thing?”

A trace of fear flashed across Sect Master Hu’s face. He hurriedly begged for mercy, “Mr. ... Mr. Qin, please spare my life. I... I know I’m wrong...”

“You want to kill me, but you want me to spare your life. Do you think that’s possible?” Qin Yu sneered.

Sect Master Hu wanted to say something, but Qin Yu didn’t give him the chance and directly smashed Sect Master Hu’s head into pieces.

After that, Qin Yu took out the Golden Core from Sect Master Hu’s body.

Including the one from Hu Feng, Qin Yu now had four Golden Cores in his hands!

If he went into seclusion, he would definitely be able to enter the middle stage of the Martial Marquis Realm.

However, Qin Yu still decided to temporarily suppress his cultivation, because it was too dangerous to break through now.

Not only would it take a very long time, but it could also lead to a fatal disaster.

The Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the various aristocratic families could send people over at any time.

“I’ll wait a little longer, and strive to enter the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm in one go,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After leaving Sect Master Hu’s place, Qin Yu returned to the tavern.

Su Qian was still sitting there, looking left and right.

Qin Yu’s departure without saying goodbye made Su Qian appear somewhat at a loss.

“What are you looking at?” Qin Yu walked directly to Su Qian’s side and sat down.

Su Qian said in surprise, “Mr. Qin, where did you go? Why did you suddenly disappear?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I went out to do something.”

Su Qian didn’t ask further and only nodded.

After dinner, Su Qian received a text message from Ning Kun, requesting her to return to the Mystic Realm immediately.

Seeing the contents of the text message, Su Qian shook his phone and smiled. “There should be news about the condition you mentioned.”

Qin Yu looked calm on the surface, but in his heart, he was growing more and more suspicious.

Could it be that this Hong Yi Sect really wanted to give him a stalk of ten-thousand-year-old herbs?

A stalk of ten-thousand-year-old herbs was a peerless treasure! Even to the various aristocratic families and sects, it was a rare holy item.

After ten-thousand years, even if it was a big tree, it would have its own intelligence, let alone a stalk of top-notch herbs.

“Mr. Qin, wait for me for now. I’ll inform you if there’s any news,” Su Qian said as she packed her things.

Qin Yu nodded.

He didn’t continue to think about it. As for what Hong Yi Sect was planning, he could only wait.

After returning to his residence, Qin Yu roughly calculated the resources in his hands:

Four Golden Cores, the remaining half of an Iceheart, and nearly 10,000 bottles of the power of creation.

Other than that, there were also some miscellaneous herbs.

“If I can get a 10,000-year-old herb, I might really be able to step into the late stage of the Martial Marquis Realm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At the moment, Qin Yu was only in the early stage of the Martial Marquis Realm. However, with his powerful physical strength, he was already able to use most of the Martial Marquis realm.

As long as he didn’t meet someone at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm, Qin Yu could basically do whatever he wanted.

“With my current strength, it’s still very difficult for me to face someone at the peak of the Martial Marquis Realm,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

The couple from the Han Palace last time almost killed Qin Yu.

There was no telling how many more people at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm were like this.

“Oh no.”

When he mentioned the Han Palace, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

Xiao Yu!

The Han Palace had already set their eyes on Xiao Yu’s mask, so they definitely wouldn’t let it go!

“No, I have to go back quickly.” Qin Yu frowned.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu put away all the herbs and other things in front of him, turned around, and prepared to leave Qing City.

He had just walked to the entrance of the hotel when he ran into Su Qian.

“Where are you going, Mr. Qin?” Su Qian asked with some surprise.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I have something to do, so I have to go back quickly.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Su Qian asked in surprise, “Are you in such a hurry?”

“Yes.” Qin Yu nodded.

Seeing this, Su Qian didn’t say anything more. She smiled and said, “I’m here to tell you some good news.”

“Good news?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

“Did you bring the ten-thousand-year-old herbs?”

Su Qian blinked and said, “Something like that.”
