Chapter 2617: Secret of the Bunker

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi- Bo Studio

“No way!”

Qin Yu was on the verge of tears. Two items in a row turned out to be worthless!

This military merit was hard-earned through life-threatening situations, and these two mysterious items had already consumed nearly half of it. There was another item, and Qin Yu felt his hands trembling.

Closing his eyes, he reached for the last black light ball.

After crushing it, a cold sensation fell into his hands.

Subsequently, Qin Yu felt a tremendous energy enveloping his palm. The energy flowed through his palm and spread across his entire arm.

What met his gaze was an extremely simple and unadorned small blade handle. It appeared to be the hilt of a dagger, but curiously, the blade of the dagger was invisible.

Qin Yu immersed his divine sense into the dagger. As expected, a wealth of information flooded into his sea of consciousness.

It was a scene of the dagger’s owner in combat. Despite their presence in the Saint Kingdom, these images had not dissipated.

Qin Yu scrutinized the battle scenes. This information was crucial for him to understand the capabilities of the dagger.

Shadowless, twenty centimeters long, the blade cast no shadow.

In one scene, the dagger’s owner confronted a demonic cultivator who had cultivated physical armor.

Six consecutive slashes left no marks on his body, but the final slash severed his entire arm.

The blade of this small knife seemed to be composed of energy. Upon closer inspection, Qin Yu noticed a subtle difference between the blade and the surrounding environment.

Perhaps due to the influence of the blade’s energy, there seemed to be a certain probability of triggering a defense-ignoring effect.

This attribute was somewhat terrifying, echoing the recorded scene where Shadowless couldn’t penetrate the demonic cultivator’s body, but the last attack directly severed his arm.

This dagger undoubtedly possessed such a heaven-defying attribute, leaving Qin Yu astonished.

This should be one of the attributes of Shadowless. Qin Yu was a little shocked.

This attribute was heaven-defying. Just imagine how desperate it was for a person with extreme body cultivation to let Shadowless break through his defense.

Moreover, this dagger, when paired with his current reflection order, would have a heaven-defying effect if he was lucky.

However, akin to the hat of the void, this dagger showed signs of damage. It was likely that the remaining power would not last for an extended period.

Qin Yu breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, out of the three mysterious items, one proved to be useful.

If all three turned out to be worthless, he truly would have been left in tears. After completely exchanging for the military merit, there was one final task at hand.

He wanted to find out who the living being in the bunker was.

Why could he master the outcome of this war?

Upon reaching the general’s residence, Li Yue had been patiently awaiting their arrival.

“What are your thoughts on the individual in the bunker?” Qin Yu inquired.

Despite his reservations about the person before him, he recognized the strategic insights offered by their chess game.

“Through regular analysis, even though both of us had reached this point with our maximum strength, the gap between the two sides shouldn’t have been so substantial. Moreover, Seifer could recruit outsiders. It could be said that our chances of winning were practically nonexistent. Therefore, I speculated that the being in the bunker might have possessed some special power or something else that could make this war less desperate…”

Li Yue tapped his forehead in contemplation.

“Let’s proceed…”

Having already made his decision, Qin Yu no longer hesitated.

Lu Yue took a deep breath and addressed Li Liefei, who was in the main hall. “General, we needed to visit the bunker in Nine Tune City to meet that person.”

“Your merit points allowed you to enter the bunker, but let me remind you that none of the people who entered before returned. Were you sure you wanted to

Li Liefei’s lips curled into a peculiar smile.

“Not me. He was going.”

Li Yue pointed at Qin Yu.

“Alright, once you’ve made your decision, follow the soldiers of the commando team. They will escort you to the bunker.”

Li Liefei waved his hand and didn’t continue to argue.

He coughed lightly, and a mouthful of blood flowed uncontrollably from the corner of his mouth.

“Li Liefei’s injuries were becoming more severe. It seemed like the backlash from breaking the altar last time was greater than I expected. In his current state, I was afraid he wouldn’t be able to hold Seifer back for long.”

Qin Yu shook his head. When he saw Li Liefei yesterday, his injuries were not that serious. It was probably the power of the necromancer that was constantly corroding his body.

Now that the battle was about to begin, the two of them followed the commando team to the bunker.

This bunker was located deep in Nine Tune City City. From the entrance, it looked like an old and gloomy prison.

Moreover, what was surprising was that Qin Yu’s Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze was unable to see the scene inside.

One had to know that the Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze could almost see through all concealment, which meant that there was powerful energy protection inside.

“You had to be careful. Even now, I still couldn’t see the ending. The black-and-white situation was constantly changing. Your thoughts in it could involve life and death.”

Li Yue’s expression was grim. He couldn’t guess what he would encounter inside.

Qin Yu nodded and pushed the door open.

When Qin Yu stepped into it, his body suddenly became light.

It was as if he had stepped into a void, and then his entire body floated just like that.

That feeling was extremely uncomfortable. His current strength was simply unable to fly in the air. This place seemed to be another space.

He was somewhat shocked. This Saint Kingdom indeed had its unique rules.

He couldn’t sense these rules now. It was very likely that the power of their divine souls was not enough.

Once the Saint power strengthened his soul to a certain extent, he should be able to begin to comprehend the power within.

Moreover, the spatial power in this Saint Kingdom was many times stronger than the next generation.

Qin Yu only felt like a small boat in a hurricane that could be destroyed in this void space at any time.

At this moment, he couldn’t control the direction he was heading in. He didn’t know how long had passed.

Qin Yu felt a weight on his body.

There were four talismans floating in the air. Powerful energy fluctuations were emitted from the four talismans.

That terrifying energy fluctuation seemed to be able to crush him at any time. This made Qin Yu feel a little frightened, and this was only used to seal the person in the middle.

Among them, an old and weathered face appeared in front of Qin Yu. His face was engraved with the lines and wrinkles of time.

What did not match it was a deep purple eye that looked at Qin Yu as if it could see through everything.

Qin Yu’s face was pale, and his entire body seemed to have been devoured.

What terrifying power! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

How could there be such a terrifying living being in this small city?
