1913 Mount Donghuang of Yan Ruoxue

Hearing this, the surrounding people quickly backed away for fear of becoming the guard of Xihuang Island.

Following that, Uncle Yan looked at the third princess and said, “Third Princess, I’ll take him away first.”

“No!” the third Princess swiftly stood in front of Uncle Yan and said with great displeasure, “I don’t care about saintess. I don’t believe my father would do anything to me for an outsider.”

Uncle Yan was not angry. He smiled and said, “Third Princess, you may have misunderstood. Although the saintess’s power is not as great as the head of the family, she is only second to him. She has the right to mobilize anyone, including you. Even your father can’t stop her.”

Although the third princess was reluctant, she had no choice in the face of the Yan family’s iron rule.

“Alright. You can take him away, but you can’t choose anyone from the group of my people to be the guard. You have to send another one,” the third princess said. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

When Uncle Yan heard this, he was slightly surprised and said, “I didn’t expect Third Princess to be so considerate to your people.”

“Considerate my a*s! I’m tired of playing with this bunch of people. Quickly find me another one, and he has to be as ugly as him,” the third princess said with an unruly expression.

Uncle Yan couldn’t do anything to her, so he could only smile bitterly and agree, “Alright. I’ll take care of this immediately.”

The third princess did not say anything else. She walked up to Qin Yu, squinted her eyes, and said, “You’re lucky. Let me tell you. Don’t think I can’t do anything to you just because you’ve gone to Mont Donghuang. I’m not bored with you yet.”

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. He didn’t want to talk to the third princess.

“Let’s go.” Uncle Yan walked up to Qin Yu.

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. He got up and followed Uncle Yan out of Xihuang Island.

However, at this moment, Qin Yu was extremely puzzled.

Why did Ruoxue specifically ask for him? His performance on the stone stairways was not outstanding, so no one would remember him.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu looked at Uncle Yan and said tentatively, “Thank you, Uncle Yan, for taking me away from Xihuang Island.”

However, Uncle Yan did not say a word as if he did not hear anything.

Qin Yu remained silent. He tried sending a wisp of his divine sense to sense Uncle Yan’s internal qi.

Soon, a look of shock flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

Although this was not the first time he met Uncle Yan, he could not come into contact with him the last time.

This time, Qin Yu was tremendously shocked by the exploration of his divine sense. Uncle Yan’s internal qi was as vigorous as the sea, and he could not detect his strength at all!

It was not overstating to say that this was the first time Qin Yu had encountered such an internal qi!

“Other than Flower Granny and Dean Lei, probably no one is more powerful than Uncle Yan,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“Don’t overthink it.” At this moment, Uncle Yan spoke.

With his back facing Qin Yu, he said quietly, “Miss Yan knew that you came to the Yan family.”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

Could it be that Yan Ruoxue had been observing him in the dark? But why hadn’t he noticed it before?

“What a terrifying concealment technique,” Qin Yu exclaimed in his heart.

However, it seemed to be a good thing. This way, Qin Yu could stay by Yan Ruoxue’s side openly.

When he arrived at Mount Donghuang, Yan Rruoxue’s territory, the Yan family probably would not notice anything.

Xihuang Island was quite far from Mount Donghuang. Even though Uncle Yan was leading the way, it would still take a long time to reach.

Along the way, neither Qin Yu nor Uncle Yan said anything.

Uncle Yan didn’t seem to have a good impression of Qin Yu. His expression was tremendously cold, and no emotions could be seen.

In Uncle Yan’s eyes, Qin Yu was a burden who might drag Yan Ruoxue into the abyss.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t ask for a snub but just followed him to Mount Donghuang.

After a long time, the two finally arrived at the vicinity of Mount Donghuang.

Compared to the desolation of Xihunag Island, this place was simply isolated. There were green mountains and clear waters, and the internal qi was exuberant. A pleasant fragrance assailed one’s nose, making one feel relaxed and happy.

Unlike the third princess’s palace, Yan Ruoxue did not have a luxurious palace. She took the ground as her bed and heaven and earth as her blanket. Everywhere she passed was her cultivation ground.

“We’ve arrived.” Uncle Yan’s voice was slightly cold and dignified, causing one to dread.

He turned around slowly, showing no intention of stepping into Mount Donghuang.

“D*mn!” Qin Yu thought. Uncle Yan probably had other intentions.

However, he remained calm and looked at uncle Yan with a smile.

Qin Yu’s ugly face, coupled with the third princess’s torture, made his smile look extremely horrifying.

Uncle Yan could not help but frown slightly. He then turned his face to the side.

“Uncle Yan, what’s the matter?” Qin Yu took the initiative to ask.

Uncle Yan snorted coldly and said, “I’ll only give you a piece of advice. Don’t drag MIss Yan down. I know your background.”

“Miss Yan is very fond of you. Indeed, I can’t do anything to you. However, if I ever find out you will bring disaster to Miss Yan one day, I will make you disappear in this world even if I have to risk my life.”

After saying this, Uncle Yan didn’t give Qin Yu a chance to speak and quickly stepped into Mount Donghuang.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to delay and quickly followed him.

Mount Donghuang was tremendously vast. It was beautiful scenery. Unknown precious trees were everywhere, and the internal qi emanating from the trees made one feel very comfortable.

Uncle Yan led Qin Yu through the mountain valleys. After passing through the forest, and finally came to the edge of a cliff.

At this moment, a woman’s back was facing the two of them. Her back was fair, glittering, and translucent, like suet Jade.

This person was none other than Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu suppressed the excitement in his heart and tried to remain calm.

...

“Miss Yan, I’ve brought him here,” Uncle Yan said as he slightly bowed.

“Alright, Uncle Yan. You may leave.”

Yan Ruoxue turned around. Her slightly cold face was breathtakingly beautiful.

Since she stepped onto the path of cultivation, Yan Ruoxue had more celestial aura now, and she was like a real fairy.

“Miss Yan, please be cautious,” Uncle Yan said in a deep voice.

After saying this, Uncle Yan retreated.

However, Qin Yu was not at ease. There was no doubt that Uncle Yan must be hiding in the dark, watching them quietly.

Seeing Qin Yu’s alert expression, Yan Ruoxue said lightly, “Don’t worry, Uncle Yan is one of us.”

Qin Yu heaved a sigh of relief. He walked forward quickly but stopped after taking two steps.

“No, my ugly face… I’m afraid I’ll frighten her,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Just as Qin Yu’s thoughts were running wild, Yan Ruoxue had already arrived in front of him.

...

Her body emitted a fragrance that assailed the sense of smell. It was so wonderful.
