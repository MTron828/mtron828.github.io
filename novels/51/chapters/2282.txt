2283 The Mystery of the Coffin

“If you think it’s expensive, you can come to my room at night. This story will be free.”

Qin Yu felt goosebumps all over his body and quickly stepped back.

“Ten pieces of spiritual essence is alright, but I will give it to you after a month.”

Qin Yu said with a frown. When Piao Ruoyun from Azure Firmament Sect gave him the monthly spiritual essence, he would no longer be in a tight spot.

“Alright. Do you know about the bone cultivation water?”

Ji Yue was not afraid that he would renege on his promise, so she began to tell.

“Of course, I know.”

Qin Yu nodded.

“Then do you know where the source of the Bone Cultivation River is? Rumor has it that the source of the Bone Refining Water was a fallen Immortal Emperor. That Immortal Emperor was in Mystic Realm in the ninth level of purgatory. The blood that seeped out from him was washed by the water of the waterfall and turned into bone cultivation water. There was a passage connecting to the Holy Region where he died, but no one could verify this.”

Ji Yue put one hand on Qin Yu’s shoulder and made flirtatious actions toward Qin Yu to her heart’s content.

“Why?”

Qin Yu quietly pulled Ji Yue’s hand away.

“Because the people who went to investigate all died on the way. Even the sect master of the Evil Extermination Sect had only been to the outer area of the ninth level of purgatory, so no one knew the situation inside. The rumors might become ridiculous as they spread. I don’t know if this is true, but you still have to pay the spiritual essence, unless…”

“Are you crazy?!”

Qin Yu jumped up like a startled chicken. It was not because he was a clean freak but because he only had Yan Ruoxue in his heart. Moreover, Ji Yue was a woman who had been together with countless men. Thinking of this, Qin Yu felt a little disgusted.

“Don’t be so fierce.”

Ji Yue said with an aggrieved look.

“I’ll definitely deliver the spiritual essence after a month.”

Qin Yu left after saying that.

Qin Yu came to the central square of Solitary Cloud City and suddenly heard the man with the mustache cursing.

Qin Yu said unhappily.

Not long after, the man with the mustache rushed over and stretched out a hand.

“What did you get in the Mystic Realm? I heard from others that you’ve taken everything in there. Don’t go back on your word.”

The man with the mustache wore an expression that said no one could fool him.

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and sent the man with the mustache into the Sumeru Space.

He was immediately captivated by the coffin and stroked the patterns on it with an intoxicated expression.

“Did you see the records here? It might be the history of the masked woman. It might even introduce her origin, but we must decipher the words first.”

The man with the mustache kept nagging Qin Yu, his eyes almost shining.

“Not bad. You brought this thing out with so many people around. Just the material alone should be top-grade.”

“Only the material of this thing is slightly usable. I used many methods to test it, but there was no reaction. It might just be a coffin,” Qin Yu shrugged and said.

“Trash, you won’t understand a thing even if you research.”

The man with the mustache took out a pile of ancient books and kept comparing them, ignoring Qin Yu.

Qin Yu backed out. He still had a lot of things to do. After interacting with Elder Guai, he knew he had no advantage now, and felt a sense of urgency!

Qin Yu rushed to the Fire Unicorn Continent without stopping. He only had 20 to 30% of the chaotic qi left after the battle.

The fastest way to recover was to cultivate on the Fire Unicorn Continent and use the unicorn’s inner core to induce the fire energy.

“The fire energy here seems not as strong as previously!”

Qin Yu frowned. Could it be the fire energy had not been restored after his previous cultivation?

He had a headache now. He needed spiritual energy urgently, but this galaxy did not have enough spiritual energy resources.

If he continued using the desolate divine eye in the future, he would need to store spiritual energy. He could not let Xiaoru and Little Fatty sacrifice themselves again.

Qin Yu walked toward the deepest part of the volcano. Many master refiners were in the process of refining there.

Master Refiners had spent their entire lives researching refining techniques. The Path of Heaven thus did not target them, allowing them to avoid a calamity.

“Stop, you are not allowed to pass through!”

Three people suddenly stood before Qin Yu and shouted.

Qin Yu sneered and said.

“The core of the volcano is right in front of us. When the time comes, can you stop a ball of lava from shooting out randomly?”

Another person said coldly.

“You don’t have to worry!”

Qin Yu walked over and placed his hands on his body.

His expression turned cold, and his shoulders trembled slightly. Instantly, the two were thrown out like sacks.

“Brother, please forgive us. We have offended you just now. Master Hei Yu is currently refining his weapon and is at a critical moment. Please wait for a moment. After my master finishes refining his weapon, he will definitely thank you with a substantial reward!”

Seeing Qin Yu not to be trifled with, the young man quickly put down his stance.

“I can’t wait too long.”

Qin Yu said coldly. The arrogant attitudes of the two brats in front of him really made him unhappy.

He extended his divine sense and indeed saw in front of him a person refining a magical artifact about to take shape.

Judging from the fluctuation of its internal qi, it was at least a magical artifact of the peak Saint Weapon or might be even beyond that.

“This Hei Yu can be considered a famous master refiner in the galaxy, but he is still a level lower than Suo Lin.”

Elder Guai explained to Qin Yu.

Besides Hei Yu, there was actually a sixth-grade True Saint protecting him.

“D*mn it! After Master finishes refining the magical artifact, I’ll definitely get the captain to teach this brat a lesson. He actually dared to attack us!”

The person sent flying just now said unhappily.

“You better shut up. He didn’t even use spiritual energy but could easily defeat both of you with just one move. If he hadn’t held back, you guys wouldn’t be standing alive here right now.”

The cultivator who spoke nicely to Qin Yu shook his head.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground with his eyes closed. Although he had not reached the core, the fire energy here was active.

With the help of the unicorn’s inner core, the fire energy quickly surged into his body, turning into surging chaotic qi.

“F*ck, isn’t he a pervert? Isn’t he afraid he will explode and die from absorbing such violent fire energy so fast?”

“Maybe he has a treasure that absorbs fire energy. Otherwise, even the captain wouldn’t dare to cultivate here. Could it be that he’s stronger than the captain?”

“That’s impossible!”

The three of them discussed.

“Oh no, he can’t be Qin Yu, right? I heard that Master Suo Lin refined a peak tribulation divine artifact and that divine artifact is with Qin Yu!”
