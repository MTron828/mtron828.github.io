Chapter 1273: Chapter 1273, first hunter 

“What are you mumbling about? Tianyun sect?”Guan Zhuang asked in surprise.

Qin Yu shook his head, indicating that he was fine.

Guan Zhuang snorted and said, “You’d better stay away from Zhong Wu that kid. He’s not a good person. He didn’t do anything bad before. I don’t know how many brothers have suffered under him.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’ve heard of it. Rumor has it that this kid often shoots people in the back to harm his own people.”

“That’s right. There was a rumor that he killed a brother in order to snatch the Demonic Beast.”Guan Zhuangzhuang said with a dark face.

Speaking of this matter, he seemed to be full of anger.

“I’ve seen through his thoughts. Don’t worry.”Qin Yu smiled and said.

Zhong Wu’s combat ability was not strong, but he had more than a million in savings.

Even an elite general like Guan Zhuangzhuang only had less than five hundred thousand in his hands.

He followed Guan Zhuang to the leader’s room and saw the leader sitting there meditating.

“Leader, Qin Yu is here,”said Guan Zhuang.

The leader slowly opened his eyes. He looked at Qin Yu and said with a faint smile, “Come, sit.”

Qin Yu did not stand on ceremony. He casually found a seat and sat down.

“Why is the leader looking for me?”Asked Qin Yu.

The team leader smiled and said, “Qin Yu, you’ve been in the limelight recently. Everyone in the Hunter organization knows about you. I reckon that when Golden Samsara comes back, they will definitely find trouble with you.”

“Golden Samsara? That Hunter?”Qin Yu frowned.

The team leader nodded slightly and said, “That’s right. Golden Samsara has a fiery temper. If he finds out that a character like you has appeared, he will definitely find trouble with you.”

Qin Yu rubbed his chin. He wasn’t worried at all. On the contrary, he was looking forward to it.

This Jin Lun was at the intermediate stage of the Almighty Realm. It was a good opportunity to use him to test out his skills. At the same time, he would also know how to deal with the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect.

The team leader slowly stood up. He took out a card and placed it in front of Qin Yu.

“What does this mean?”Qin Yu asked, puzzled.

The team leader smiled and said, “Don’t misunderstand. We just happen to need to purchase a new batch of weapons. I’ll leave this matter to you. It’s also a good time to stay out of the limelight.”

“There’s 300,000 yuan in the card. You Go with Guan Zhuang.”

Before Qin Yu could regain his senses, guan zhuang hurriedly said, “Thank you, Team Leader!”

After saying that, he even used his arm to poke Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu also came back to his senses and quickly nodded, “Thank you, Team Leader.”

“Haha, Alright, Hurry Up and go. If you don’t know anything, just ask Guan Zhuang,”said the team leader with a smile.

Qin Yu picked up the card and followed Guan Zhuang out.

After going out, Guan Zhuang said with some excitement, “Qin Yu, it seems that the team leader thinks highly of you. He actually handed this lucrative job to you.”

Qin Yu said, “Is there any market nearby?”

“Yes, of course there is. But the distance isn’t too close. It’s in Gu City,”said Guan Zhuang.

Qin Yu rubbed his chin. He had seen this Gu City on the map before.

This wasn’t a small country. Its city lord was at the peak of the mighty realm, and he was extremely powerful.

Apart from that, the entire country had eight mighty realm experts, and they also had a top-notch formation protecting the country.

Because they weren’t too far from Qingyan Forest, they had many natural treasures, as well as top-notch weapons and magic artifacts.

The only thing that made people feel regretful was that this country belonged to the Tianyun sect. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Group Leader treats you quite well. He told you to deliberately avoid the golden wheel.”Guan Zhuang patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

Qin Yu said, “Is this golden wheel very strong?”

“Since he is called the hunter king, his strength naturally doesn’t need to be said. The most important thing is that this person has a hot temper. Once he goes crazy, no one can stop him,”Guan Zhuang said in a deep voice.

After hearing Guan Zhuang’s words, Qin Yu wanted to see so for myself more and more.

“Unfortunately, I can’t meet him,”Qin Yu muttered.

“Do you still want to fight with him? Let me tell you, this kid didn’t take things lightly and has a bunch of lackeys by his side. It’s best not to provoke him,”Guan Zhuang said.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and didn’t say anything else.

This trip to Gu City was a good opportunity to see if there was any life force.

For Qin Yu, the most important thing at the moment was to find the life force and recover his spiritual power.

In his current state, if his spiritual power recovered, he wouldn’t be afraid of the mighty realm at all.

At that time, even the Tianyun sect wouldn’t have anything to fear.

The next day, the two of them planned to go to Gu city together.

At this time, Zhong Wu ran over and said with a smile, “Brother Qin, I heard that you’re going to Gu City? I wonder if you can help me bring something?”

“Bring your ass! Get lost!”Guan Zhuang shouted.

Zhong Wu looked at Guan Zhuang from the corner of his eyes and snorted, “What does it have to do with you?”

“Do you want to die?”Guan Zhuang took a step forward and his internal Qi exploded.

Zhong Wu was not afraid at all. He looked at Guan Zhuang coldly and said, “Do you think I’m afraid of You?”

Just as the two of them were about to clash, Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Alright, what do you need me to bring? Just tell me.”

When Zhong Wu saw this, a smug smile immediately appeared on his face.

“I’ll have to Trouble Brother Qin to bring me two pieces of dragon gold,”Zhong Wu said.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “What is Dragon Gold?”

“It’s just a small item. It’s not worth much,”zhong wu said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Okay, I’ll remember it.”

Then, Qin Yu and Guan Zhuang left Green Rock Forest and rushed to Gu City.

On the way, Guan Zhuang could not help but curse, “Why did you agree to him? Do you really want to have a deep relationship with him?”

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “I just lied to him for more than a million yuan. It doesn’t make sense if I don’t help him bring something.”

“You lied to him? Hehe, since I’ve known him, he’s the only one who lied to others. How could anyone lie to him?”Guan Zhuang snorted coldly.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “He mistook me for a disciple of a big aristocratic family and is now desperately trying to build a relationship with me.”

“No Wonder,”Guan Zhuang muttered.

Qin Yu had just left when Jin Lun rushed back.

“Boss, I heard that someone called Qin Yu has recently taken care of those troublesome orders. Some people say that he will become the new Hunter King.”

Two young men said beside a strong man.

This strong man did not say anything, but his face was full of coldness.

His body was extremely huge, and he wore a tiger skin coat, which made his already rough face even more frightening.

This person was the famous Jin Lun.

He did not say anything along the way, but when he returned to the Green Rock Forest, he kicked open the group leader’s door.

The group leader who was at the table was immediately shocked.

When he saw Jin Lun in front of him, the group leader chuckled and said, “Jin Lun, you’re back.”

However, Jin Lun ignored this sentence and asked coldly, “Where is that Qin Yu? Tell him to come out.”
