2054 The Growth of the Bodhi Ancient Tree

“That’s right,” Qin Yu sighed and said. “In an era where one even couldn’t reach the Reversion Void Stage, he actually stepped into that cultivation realm. I’m afraid no one in the entire universe can compete with him.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This kind of genius was undoubtedly lonely. He could not even find an opponent.

“If he was born in the Golden Age, no one knows what cultivation realm he would have stepped into,” Qin Yu sighed and said.

What was even more terrifying was that Wu Ji was a chaotic body.

Who could be compared to him if his chaotic body stepped into the Immortal Emperor Realm?

“That’s why no one is willing to give up on Wu Ji’s Big Grave,” Saintess Gu said with a smile as she poured the tea.

At this point, Saintess Gu suddenly changed the topic and continued, “Didn’t you want to know why the nine great aristocratic families haven’t made any moves?”

Qin Yu nodded and waited for Saintess Gu Gu to continue.

“I heard some news,” Saintess Gu said with a smile. “Rumor has it that the nine great aristocratic families will invite everyone in the world to participate in a grand event. And the purpose of this grand event is for the Chaos Grave.”

“Grand event?” Qin Yu frowned and said. “What’s the point of such a grand event? Are they gathering thoughts from all? Even the nine great aristocratic families can’t do anything about it. What’s the point of others participating?”

“That might not be the case,” Saintess Gu smiled and said.

“Rumor has it that many people have been invited to this grand event, including many powerful rogue cultivators.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment and said, “It seems that the nine great aristocratic families want to gather all the capable people in the world to open up this Chaos Grave.”

“Yes, just like the last time at the Chaos Grave, your friend predicted the spread of the Chaos Grave. It shows that there are many powerful and mysterious rogue cultivators in the world. Perhaps someone can predict something,” Saintess Gu said.

Qin Yu could not help but feel a little embarrassed when she mentioned the man with the mustache.

The man with the mustache and Saintess Gu were not on good terms. If Saintess Gu discovered the man with the mustache’s identity, she would probably chase Qin Yu out of the Cold Moon Palace.

“When will the grand event be held?” Qin Yu asked.

“Why? Brother Qin wants to participate too?” Saintess Gu asked with a smile. “If you were to appear at that grand event, I’m afraid you won’t be able to leave.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. He was in a dilemma if he should tell Saintess Gu or not.

But after a while, Qin Yu finally sighed and said, “I have no choice. I also want to know the secret of the Chaos Grave. You also know that I have a special reason.”

“Because of Saintess Yan?” Saintess Gu raised her eyebrows and said.

“That’s right,” Qin Yu nodded and said.

Immediately after, Qin Yu probed and asked, “Saintess Gu, I believe the nine great aristocratic families have deduced something, right?”

Hearing this, Saintess Gu couldn’t help but say coquettishly, “Mr. Qin actually wants to fish out information from me. It really saddens me!”

Then Saintess Gu said half-jokingly, “That’s not a secret, to begin with. There’s no harm telling you. It’s just that I didn’t expect Mr. Qin to treat me as an outsider. You actually used such a method to gather information from me. I actually treat you as…”

She didn’t finish her sentence, but the ambiguity was extremely obvious.

Qin Yu was not stupid. He knew Saintess Gu was teasing him on purpose.

With her status, she could find any man she wanted. Why would she take a fancy to Qin Yu?

Therefore, Qin Yu deliberately said, “What do you treat me as? Have I become the Bodhi ancient tree’s father? And you’re the Bodhi ancient tree’s mother? If that’s the case, you have to protect me well. After all, our relationship is so extraordinary.”

As expected, Saintess Gu immediately became much more serious after hearing Qin Yu’s words. She no longer dared to joke with Qin Yu.

“You women are indeed awesome.” Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

Saintess Gu coughed and continued, “Now, the nine great aristocratic families have indeed deduced something. Rumor has it that Wuji once had two attendants. After he passed away, these two attendants protected him for 20,000 years.”

The moment these words came out, Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

He suppressed the excitement in his heart and said, “20,000 years? Are those two attendants also at the Tribulation Transcendence Stage?”

“That’s right. They are Tribulation veterans who survived the previous Golden Age,” Saintess Gu said.

Qin Yu frowned a little. He looked at Saintess Gu and said, “This doesn’t seem right. Wu Ji was so powerful, so how could his lifespan be shorter than other Tribulation Stage cultivators? Moreover, those two Tribulation Stage cultivators survived from the previous era, didn’t they?”

“Mr. Qin, you’re indeed sharp. You’ve seen through the problem in an instant,” Saintess Gu chuckled.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and waited for Saintess Gu to continue.

Saintess Gu poured a cup of tea and said, “There are two rumors about this.”

“The first is that Wu Ji had violated the Path of Heaven by integrating nine dao techniques. Thus his lifespan was tremendously short. The integration of the nine dao techniques left a wound on his body, and thus he died early.”

“The second explanation is that after Wu Ji integrated nine dao techniques, he traveled to the starry sky. The Chaos Grave he left behind is one of his clones. The two explanations are constantly debated, but more people tend to believe the first.”

Qin Yu touched his chin. That was possible.

After all, as long as he did not step into the Immortal Emperor realm, he could not create his own dao technique. Violating the Path of Heaven was bound to leave behind a wound.

“In other words, if I want to enter the Chaos Grave, I need to obtain the corpses of those two attendants?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

“How did you know this?” Saintess Gu asked in surprise.

“I was just guessing,” Qin Yu said without any confidence.

Saintess Gu didn’t think too much. She nodded and said, “There’s a saying that if you want to enter the Chaos Grave, you need to obtain their supreme bones. Otherwise, even if you bring a tribulation magical artifact along, most probably you’ll die.”

When Qin Yu heard that, he was instantly incomparably excited!

Wasn’t the so-called supreme bone the two skeletons that Qin Yu was keeping?

“As long as I have the supreme bone, I can successfully obtain Wu Ji’s hidden treasure…” Qin Yu murmured.

“That’s just a guess,” Saintess Gu shook her head and said. “It’s not logical. Thus they’re holding the grand event.

“Of course, even if this guess is true, we still need the assistance of other magical artifacts.”

Qin Yu nodded repeatedly and asked impatiently, “When will the grand event be held? I want to participate too.”

“The date has yet to be decided,” Saintess Gu said. ” But I think you’ll hear about it when the time comes. After all, it’s an open grand event.”

“Alright, thank you!” Qin Yu stood up and wanted to leave.

“Mr. Qin, don’t you want to take a look at our Bodhi ancient tree?” Saintess Gu said casually.

Qin Yu said waving his hand, “What’s there to see? The Bodhi ancient tree grows incredibly slowly. I’m afraid that it hasn’t even sprouted yet.”

“That might not be the case,” Saintess Gu said indifferently.
