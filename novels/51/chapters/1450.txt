Chapter 1451: Chapter 1,451, heading to the Tianyun sect

The deputy sect master tried to shout again, but the sect master still didn’t respond. He just sat there quietly.

Seeing this situation, the deputy sect master didn’t continue to ask.

He took the initiative and temporarily took the place of the sect.

...

In the following period of time, the entire South Province seemed to be discussing this matter. It could be said that the great elder lost all face.

However, this did not affect the heavenly cloud sect’s ruling position in the South Province. It seemed that no one was willing to go against the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, more than half a month had passed.

During this period, Qin Yu had been sitting cross-legged here. There were no signs of him waking up.

Another half a month passed.

Qin Yu, who was in closed-door cultivation, finally opened his eyes slightly.

The dry spiritual energy in his body had already recovered by more than half. However, he was still some distance away from reaching the peak.

There was no other reason than Qin Yu’s special physique, which led him to need more and more spiritual power.

Qin Yu lowered his head to look at his body, which was shining with golden light. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Although he hadn’t recovered to the peak, it was enough.

Moreover, the spiritual power in Mount Hua Ning had suffered a certain loss during this period of cultivation, and the improvement brought by the spiritual power to Qin Yu wasn’t that great anymore.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. His body shook and he shot toward a residence in Mount Hua Ning.

At this moment, Jue Wu was sitting in a room drinking with the two Wen brothers. The three of them were playing with their fists, and they were quite at ease.

Seeing Qin Yu who had barged in, Wen da said in a daze, “Yo, Qin Yu, hurry up and come over. Let’s have a drink together.”

Qin Yu ignored Wen Da. He looked at Jue Wu and said, “Where’s Zhuo Jing? Did he go back?”

Jue Wu grunted and said, “He left not long after you went into seclusion.”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I plan to go down the mountain.”

“Go down the mountain?”Jue Wu frowned. “Why are you in such a hurry?”

“En, first elder should pay the price. I have to kill him,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Jue Wu looked at Qin Yu’s surging aura and said, “Why? Have you recovered?”

“Seventy percent,”Qin Yu said. “But seventy percent is enough.”

Jue Wu still said with some worry, “It’s definitely not a good choice for you to go to the Heavenly Cloud sect. The Heavenly Cloud Sect’s foundation is very powerful. The demon subduing divine lamp is just an insignificant magic artifact.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “He has a treasure, and so do I. It’s hard to say who will win.”

Seeing Qin Yu so insistent, Jue Wu didn’t say anything more.

“Oh, right, Zhuo Jing left something for you.”Jue Wu seemed to suddenly ring.

She threw a spatial god tool to Qin Yu and said, “This is an ownerless item. Zhuo Jing specifically told me to give it to you.”

Qin Yu took the space artifact. He sent a wisp of soul consciousness into it, his eyes showing a trace of surprise.

Zhuo Jing didn’t just leave the Divine Eagle to Qin Yu. There were also a lot of medicinal materials in this space artifact.

“Phew, I owe him again.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Jue Wu waved her hand and said, “Alright, if you want to leave, then leave. I don’t have so much time to accompany you.”

With that, she turned around and continued to drink.

Wen Da and Wen Er gave Qin Yu some advice before returning to the wine table.

Qin Yu took out the divine eagle from the spatial artifact. Then, he rode on the Divine Eagle and tore through the ten thousand Li High Sky, rushing towards the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Hua Ning Mountain to the Heavenly Cloud sect happened to pass through Gu City.

When she arrived above Gu City, Qin Yu thought of sister Lin.

After thinking for a while, Qin Yu finally decided to visit her.

Thus, the huge divine hawk fluttered its huge arms and slowly stopped at the entrance of the auction.

Qin Yu jumped down from the Divine Hawk and then Strode towards the auction.

At this time, the auction had just ended. In the huge open space at the entrance of the auction, Swords were drawn and bows were drawn.

Traces of killing intent enveloped more than half of the auction, ready to fight at any moment.

When they saw Qin Yu, they could not help but stop what they were doing and look in Qin Yu’s direction.

“Isn’t this Qin Yu? Why is he here?”

“Who is Qin Yu?”

“Don’t you know? He’s the young man who has been challenging the heavenly cloud sect.”

Everyone was discussing, but Qin Yu ignored them.

He passed through the crowd and walked toward the auction.

As soon as he entered the door, he was stopped by two people.

The two people said politely, “Mr. Qin, our auction house is small. It really can’t accommodate a Buddha like you. You should... Go somewhere else.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He knew that the auction house was afraid of offending the Heavenly Cloud sect, so he didn’t pester them too much.

“Please help me find sister Lin. I’ll wait for her outside,”Qin Yu said.

The two of them looked at each other and shook their heads. “Ever since sister Lin came back from the Heavenly Cloud sect, she was kicked out of the auction. She hasn’t been here for a long time.”

Qin Yu’s frown instantly became even deeper.

“Heavenly Cloud Sect...”Qin Yu’s expression was unsightly.

Unknowingly, Qin Yu had brought trouble to countless people.

“Can you tell me where sister Lin Lives?”Qin Yu asked.

These two people did not hide, immediately told Qin Yu sister Lin’s residence.
