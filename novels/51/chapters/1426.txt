Chapter 1427: Chapter 1,427, different teams 1

Qin Yu opened his mouth but didn’t know how to refute.

He thought for a moment and said, “Alright then, I’ll join you.”

The young man’s face flashed with joy and he quickly said, “I’m Liao Ya, nicknamed Fang Ya. What About You?”

“Yu Qin.”Qin Yu randomly made up a name.

Fang ya smiled and said, “Okay, Yu Qin, Welcome to join us!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu thought to himself, “I’ll just take it as doing a good deed. I don’t have anywhere else to go now anyway.”

This time, Qin Yu had only one goal in entering the green rock forest, and that was the flying spider.

As long as he could find the flying spider, there was a chance of obtaining its life force.

As for whether he could find the flying spider, Qin Yu was not confident.

There were at least dozens of small groups nearby. Some of them were equipped with luxurious equipment. Not only did they have the servants of their clans, but they also had extraordinary magical artifacts.

There were also some people who did not have anything and relied on their luck to risk their lives.

“Do you often enter the Green Rock Forest?”Qin Yu asked Fang.

Fang grunted and said, “Basically, I enter a few times a year.”

“Then why didn’t you choose to join the hunter organization? Isn’t that safer?”Qin Yu asked suspiciously.

Fang fang sighed and said, “I tried, but I didn’t pass the Hunter organization’s examination, so I could only go out and do it alone.”

Qin Yu was full of gratitude. This made sense. Qin Yu had experienced the hunter organization’s examination. He had killed a top-tier demon beast to prove himself before he had the chance to join.

With Fang Fang’s ability, it would be very difficult for him to pass the assessment.

As the night grew deeper, some powerful teams reached an agreement after a night of negotiations.

As for small teams like Fang Fang and the others, no one paid any attention to them. To be able to gather five people was already the limit.

That night, Qin Yu lay on the ground, not feeling sleepy at all.

All he could think about was how to get the life force as soon as possible.

Before he came to the Holy Region, Qin Yu had never thought that the vital energy would be so rare.

In the blink of an eye, he had been in the holy region for several months, but Qin Yu’s cultivation had not improved at all.

Even he Teng’s strength had obviously increased, but Qin Yu’s cultivation had stopped.

“If I meet Chang Mang and the others again, I’m afraid I’ll be left behind by a large margin.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

He didn’t know what kind of realm that batch of geniuses from Earth had stepped into.

...

The next day.

The Sky had just brightened when the people heading to Qingyan Forest started to take action.

“Yu Qin, hurry up and get up. We have to set off too.”Fang ya urged.

Qin Yu slowly got up from the ground. He stretched and said, “Let’s go.”

Fang ya nodded and led Qin Yu and the others toward the Green Rock Forest.

At this time, many people had already stepped into the green rock forest. Qin Yu and the others were just an inconspicuous group of people in this tide.

“Yu Qin, this is your first time entering the Green Rock Forest. You have to listen to my arrangements later. Otherwise, I can’t guarantee your safety,”Fang ya reminded Qin Yu along the way.

Qin Yu didn’t say much and only nodded in agreement.

Soon, the group of people had already entered Qingyan Forest.

Qingyan forest was extremely huge. After walking for a short while, the group of people disappeared from sight. The surroundings gradually became cold, and Fang Ya’s expression also gradually became nervous.

Qin Yu seemed to be fine. He crossed his arms behind his head and hummed a little tune.

Fang Fang frowned when he saw Qin Yu’s relaxed expression, but he didn’t say anything.

As they went deeper into the green rock forest, the aura around them gradually became a little cold.

In the dark, the low growls of wild beasts could be heard from time to time.

This made Fang Fang and the others’faces change drastically, and their hair stood on end.

Their footsteps gradually slowed down.

Fangya nervously looked around, and cold sweat continuously broke out on his forehead!

“Be careful!”At this moment, Fangya suddenly cried out in alarm.

One after another, scarlet and ice-cold gazes were fixed on Qin Yu and the others in the dark.

Fangya hurriedly took out a knife and handed it to Qin Yu.

“Yu Qin, be careful!”Fangya said nervously.

Soon, a figure slowly walked out from the darkness.

It was a dozen or so huge wolves. Their fur was like steel, standing upright and bone-chilling.

A low growl echoed in everyone’s ears, as if to warn them.

“Roar!”

Accompanied by an angry roar, the dozen or so wolves immediately pounced on everyone!

Fang Fang and the others did not dare to be negligent. They held sharp blades in their hands and started to fight with the wolves.

Qin Yu grabbed the long blades in his hands and also went up to meet them.

Fortunately, the strength of these wolf pack wasn’t considered strong. Under the joint efforts of the few of them, it didn’t take long for the dozen or so wolves to all be beheaded.

The pungent smell of blood permeated the surroundings. Fang Fang and the others’bodies were stained with blood.

They surrounded the corpses of these few wolves and examined them, but didn’t find any treasures.

“What a pity.”Someone Sighed.

Fang Fang said in a deep voice, “This is the lowest grade demonic beast. Otherwise, we would not have been able to deal with it so easily.”

After saying that, Fang Fang looked at Qin Yu and smiled, “Yu Qin, this is your first time hunting. How Do You Feel?”
