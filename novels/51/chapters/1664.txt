Chapter 1665: Chapter 1,664, East Barren Legend 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

“East Barren?”Qin Yu was stunned.

Was this the reason why Xiao Sheng asked him to go to the east barren?

It shouldn’t be. Qin Yu had not even heard of the east barren after being in the southern region for so long. If Xiao Sheng had not mentioned it, Qin Yu would not have known about this place for the rest of his life!

A Land of outstanding talents should not be without news.

Qin Yu was silent. He looked at Master Freewill and wanted to ask him something, but Freewill had already turned around and left. It was obvious that he didn’t want to continue discussing further.

With no other choice, Qin Yu could only leave for the time being.

Before he left, Qin Yu deliberately walked around the library to see if there were any Rashomon sect techniques in the library.

Unfortunately, he didn’t get anything from this round.

Therefore, Qin Yu walked out of the library and headed toward the Cultivation Mountain.

On the Cultivation Mountain.

It was still like a fairyland.

Under a huge tree, there was a wooden table. Qin Yu and Xiao Sheng were sitting opposite each other.

In front of them was a pot of tea. The fragrance of the tea permeated the air, making people forget to return.

“Have you been to the Library?”Xiao Sheng poured a cup of tea for Qin Yu and asked indifferently.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I just left there.”

“What did you find?”Xiao Sheng asked.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I found that the east barren used to be a blessed land in the southern region, a place where countless great cultivators at the tribulation stage were born.”

“What else?”Xiao Sheng continued to ask.

“Also... none of these bloodlines were left behind. As for the east barren, it became an unknown place,”Qin Yu continued.

Xiao Sheng stared at Qin Yu and said, “That’s it?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth. For a moment, he did not understand what Xiao Sheng meant.

Xiao Sheng said indifferently, “Have you ever thought about why the East Wilderness has fallen to such a state? Why none of the bloodlines of the East Wilderness have been left behind?”

“I don’t know. This is also what I am puzzled about.”Qin Yu sighed.

Xiao Sheng slowly stood up. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “I can tell you that the current East Wilderness has become a desert with no signs of human habitation. It’s truly a no-man’s land.”

“As expected...”Qin Yu murmured in a low voice. He seemed to have guessed something.

Xiao Sheng continued, “Isn’t this illogical? When these factors are combined, have you ever thought about the reason?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He held his chin and seemed to be deep in thought.

Xiao Sheng wasn’t in a hurry. He just stood aside and waited quietly.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word for several hours. He seemed to be in a meditative state.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly woke up.

He looked at Xiao Sheng and said in a deep voice, “Could it be that... those grand cultivators at the tribulation stage have exhausted all the luck in the East Continent?”

A hint of relief appeared on Xiao Sheng’s face.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Fortunately, you didn’t disappoint me.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Is it really because of this reason?”

Xiao Sheng didn’t answer this question directly, instead, he said, “Throughout the history of the Holy Region, every place has its ups and downs. Everything is like a reincarnation. Today’s east continent is a desert, and tomorrow’s Central Plains might not be the same.”

“The emergence of the heavenly tribulation in the eastern wilderness will definitely exhaust the luck of a region. In the future, the central plains might be the same,”Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu could not help but look at Xiao Sheng with a shocked expression. At this moment, he suddenly discovered Xiao Sheng’s great wisdom.

A person who was meticulous and could look at the past, he was probably even more powerful than he had imagined!

In the entire southern region, and even the entire holy region, only a handful of people could think of such things.

Everyone was desperately trying to absorb resources, so who would think of such things.

“Do you know why I asked you to go to the Eastern Wilderness?”At this moment, Xiao Sheng suddenly asked.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “It’s... What Treasure do you want me to excavate?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Xiao Sheng put his hands behind his back and said calmly, “The eastern wilderness was a land of outstanding people back then. The influx of countless experts exhausted the fate of an area. This kind of aura is difficult to recover after tens of thousands of years.”

“But it’s different now.”Xiao Sheng looked at Qin Yu.

“In this great world, it means that everything will be reshuffled. The aristocratic families and clans will all be reshuffled. Everyone has the chance to stand on the peak of the mountain and create history.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly in agreement.

Xiao Sheng continued, “Other than these aristocratic families, the fate will be the same.”

“The east continent used to be a blessed land. Today’s east continent is the same. Why do I need to go to the central continent? At least now is not an opportunity.”

Qin Yu suddenly came to a realization. He suddenly stood up with a hint of admiration on his face.

“Why did you tell me this?”Qin Yu asked curiously.

Xiao Sheng glanced at qin yu and said, “I’m willing.”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and was speechless.

“I’m still a little curious. Why Don’t you go to the East Wilderness?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Xiao Sheng put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Soon.”

Qin Yu was speechless again. Obviously, as long as he wanted to say something, he would say it even if he didn’t ask. But if he didn’t want to say it, it would be useless to ask.

“Thank you,”Qin Yu said sincerely.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and planned to leave.

“I look forward to fighting with you one day.”

At this moment, Xiao Sheng’s voice came from behind.

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said, “Me too.”

After saying that, he walked down from the Cultivation Mountain.

Qin Yu did not know when the elementalists would be fully resurrected, so he did not dare to waste time.

Before heading to the East Wilderness, Qin Yu planned to visit his old friends, such as Qu Zhu and Zhuo Jing.

It would be best if they could travel together.

When Qin Yu arrived at wind bamboo mountain, he discovered that the mountain gate was already locked, and Qu Zhu had already gone into seclusion to cultivate.

Feeling helpless, Qin Yu could only take his leave and rush towards the Zhuo family.

Zhuo family.

Different from the hustle and bustle of the past, the Zhuo family today looked rather deserted.

Qin Yu released his divine sense, covering more than half of the Zhuo family, and soon caught sight of Zhuo Jing’s figure.

Besides Zhuo Jing, there seemed to be another person standing by his side.

This person’s internal Qi wasn’t weak, and was on par with Zhuo Jing’s.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much, and walked over quickly following the internal Qi.

When Qin Yu walked up to him, he realized that the person standing beside Zhuo Jing was actually Li Yingying, whom he had not seen for a long time.

“Li Yingying...”Qin Yu frowned slightly and a trace of disgust flashed across his face.

Zhuo Jing was also rather embarrassed. He looked at Li Yingying helplessly and said, “You should leave quickly, okay? I told you, I don’t want to see you now.”

Li Yingying seemed to be a little afraid of Qin Yu. She didn’t dare to say anything and turned around to leave.

“Wait.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly called out to Li Yingying.
