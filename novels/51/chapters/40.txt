Chapter 41: The Power of the Shen Family Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yao Qing didn’t refuse. Although he had been a henchman of the Shen family, he had always looked down on the Shen family.

Therefore, Yao Qing told Qin Yu everything he knew.

“The Shen family’s main source of income is from health care products, but rich people nowadays are more or less somewhat involved in the real estate industry,” Yao Qing said.

“Health care products?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but sneer.

Wasn’t this just right for him?

Any one of Qin Yu’s pill formulas could bankrupt the Shen family!

“Mr. Qin, why don’t you let the Yan family help you with this matter?” Yao Qing asked with some puzzlement.

“The Yan family can bankrupt the Shen family at the drop of a hat.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said in a low voice, “You can’t rely on other people for everything. Only if you have the ability can you win the respect of other people.”

If he depended on Yan Ruoxue for everything, what right would Qin Yu have to go to the Yan family to propose marriage?

After living in the Su family for three years, Qin Yu knew very clearly that if they weren’t equally matched, he wouldn’t have any dignity.

“There is one more thing I want to ask you.” At this moment, Qin Yu continued.

“Who did you learn your ability from?” Qin Yu asked.

Yao Qing’s strength level was the strongest Qin Yu had ever seen.

Even Qin Yu, who was at the second level of the Qi Refining Stage, wasn’t his match.

Yao Qing was silent for a moment, then forced a smile and said, “I studied under the Southeast Sect, but unfortunately, I was too weak, so I was kicked out.”

“Too weak?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a little astonished.

Yao Qing was actually kicked out of the sect because he was considered weak, then how strong was the Southeast Sect?

Yao Qing continued to explain, “The Southeast Sect also trains Inner Strength, and my level is at most at the eighth stage of Inner Strength.”

“For the Southeast Sect, those below the master level of Inner Strength aren’t qualified.” Yao Qing’s expression was somewhat regretful.

This immediately aroused Qin Yu’s interest.

After the conversation, he learned that an Inner Strength master could only be considered a beginner in the Southeast Sect. There were also Inner Strength grandmasters and even martial grandmasters above them.

Those who were strong enough either dominated a region or went to a top-tier blue-blood family.

“In fact, Miss Yan should know more about this.” Yao Qing said.

This made Qin Yu feel a sense of crisis.

“It seems that I have to increase my strength as soon as possible,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

...

The next day, the Shen family released an important piece of news in Jiangcheng: every businessman who had dealings with Qin Yu were enemies of the Shen family!

Once this news was released, it caused a huge uproar.

In just one day, dozens of people went to visit the Shen family.

Most of these people were local businessmen in Jiangcheng. They all wanted to use this opportunity to curry favor with the Shen family.

Qin Yu didn’t care much about it. He didn’t know many businessmen to begin with, so the matter didn’t have much to do with him.

In the evening, Qin Yu suddenly received a phone call.

This phone call actually came from Du Yuan.

“Mr. Qin, my father wants to invite you to dinner. I wonder if you are free tonight?” Du Yuan said very politely over the phone. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh. “Your father? I have no ties with your father. If you have something to say, just say it.”

Du Yuan said bitterly, “I really can’t hide anything from you. My father wants to ask for your help. If it’s convenient for you, let’s meet and talk.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and agreed, “Okay.”

Ten minutes later, Du Yuan personally drove to Dragon Paradise.

Du Yuan looked a bit haggard, and he was extremely listless.

When he saw Yao Qing, his expression changed.

“Mr. Qin, why is he here?” Du Yuan said with some vigilance.

Qin Yu smiled. He reached out and patted Yao Qing’s shoulder, saying, “He’s my man now.”

Du Yuan suddenly froze, as if he couldn’t understand.

“Let’s not talk about this.” Qin Yu waved his hand. “Let’s go.”

So, Qin Yu got into Du Yuan’s car.

Du Yuan drove a Mercedes-benz G63 that was quite posh and outshone almost all the cars in the neighborhood.

Just as the car was about to drive out of the neighborhood, a car suddenly came in.

Du Yuan frowned. Just as he was about to speak, he saw Zhao Gang roll down the window.

“Yo, isn’t this Mr. Du?” Zhao Gang said slyly.

Du Yuan frowned and said, “Zhao Gang? What’s the matter?”

Zhao Gang smirked mischievously and said, “Nothing much. I just heard that your family’s situation isn’t that optimistic. I heard that your business partners have terminated their contracts with you?”

Du Yuan’s expression was ice-cold and he didn’t say anything.

Zhao Gang said proudly, “Gee, President Shen is treating us to dinner tonight. I don’t think he invited you, right?”

“It’s none of your business. Move the car!” Du Yuan berated coldly.

Zhao Gang snorted and said, “Du Yuan, why are you acting so pretentious? President Shen has already given the word that he wants your family to go bankrupt! Do you still think your family is the richest one?”

Qin Yu, who was in the car, couldn’t help but frown.

He rolled down the car window, looked at Zhao Gang coldly and said, “Move the car. I don’t want to say it a second time.”

“Oh, Qin Yu is here too?” When he saw Qin Yu, the smile on Zhao Gang’s expression grew even wider.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and directly pushed open the car door to get out.

Seeing this, Zhao Gang hurriedly climbed into the car and locked the car door.

“What? You want to hit me? Come, try hitting me,” Zhao Gang said slyly.

Qin Yu nodded. He reached out and grabbed the car door. Then, he suddenly exerted force, and the car door immediately let out a loud clatter!

In the next second, the locked car door was actually forcefully pulled down by Qin Yu!
