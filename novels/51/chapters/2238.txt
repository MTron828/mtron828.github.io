2239 The Divine Sense of the Bone Cultivation River

After looting the three of them, Qin Yu and Piao Ruoyun immediately set off for Solitary Cloud City to avoid getting into trouble.

“Qin Yu, I’m going back to the sect for a retreat. I must thank you for this time. Without you, I couldn’t obtain the inner core of this six-tailed Demon Fox King. In the future, feel free to ask for help whenever you need it. This is my messaging jade pendant.”

Piao Ruoyun giggled and said.

“Not at all. Without you, I wouldn’t have collected so much bone cultivation water. We’re just helping each other.”

Qin Yu said, waving his hand.

Piao Ruoyun’s strength was quite good. Moreover, she was a soul cultivator. If it weren’t for her Water Mirror Space, Qin Yu would be lucky even if he could obtain one-tenth of the bone cultivation water this time.

“I need to remind you of one more thing. The Soul-hunting Bell is the sect’s supreme treasure. Try not to use it, or else you’ll get into big trouble once the disciples of the Azure Firmament Sect discover it.”

Piao Ruoyun hesitated for a moment before turning around suddenly and reminding him.

“Mmm.”

Qin Yu nodded, and the two parted ways.

Qin Yu returned to his room in the Moon Listening Pavilion. After setting up a simple formation in front of the door, he entered the Sumeru ring.

The two little brats were still chasing after each other and playing wildly, and the man with the mustache was studying the blood water at the side. When he saw Qin Yu, he jumped over and said,

“F*ck, what f*cking thing is this? What a dense demonic qi. Where did you collect so much of it from?”

“It’s a secret.”

Qin Yu rolled his eyes and said.

Before Qin Yu, an enormous pit was full of bone cultivation water.

The blood water kept bubbling as if it was boiling, and strong demonic qi and killing intent filled the air.

“Qin Yu, are you planning to temper your body using this bone cultivation water?”

Elder Guai asked.

Qin Yu nodded slightly. “Absorbing this demonic qi straight away might be a disaster for others. However, to my chaotic body, it should be no different from ordinary spiritual energy. Moreover, bone cultivation water contains destructive power. It will temper my body again and make my body stronger.”

Before this, he had tested out the bone cultivation water, and its effect was tremendously shocking.

“Previously, it was just your fist. The destructive power of so much blood water is tremendous. During the process of destruction and reconstruction, you will suffer intense pain. Even some demon beasts couldn’t withstand that violent power and died. You must think twice before you act.”

Elder Guai said solemnly.

“Elder Guai, what I fear most is when the person I need to protect is in front of me, I have to hide behind her back. I won’t give up on the slightest chance of increasing my strength.”

Qin Yu’s expression did not change at all. From Earth to the Holy Region, he owed Yan Ruoxue too much.

Seeing that he could not persuade Qin Yu, Elder Guai could only nod.

“By the way, Elder Guai, is this bone cultivation water helpful in your recovery?”

Qin Yu suddenly asked.

“I’m already old. It’s too wasteful to let me use this water.” Elder Guai shook his head.

Qin Yu waved his hand and split the bone cultivation water into three portions.

“Elder Guai, this portion is for you.”

Qin Yu said. Seeing Elder Guai want to say something, he continued.

“There’s still a chance to obtain this bone cultivation water in the future. Elder Guai, you don’t have to be polite with me.”

Qin Yu immediately took a deep breath and transformed the spiritual energy in his body into demonic qi before jumping into the blood water.

“Qin Yu, protect your consciousness. Your demonic qi might be unable to fool the bone cultivation water!”

Elder Guai reminded loudly.

“Boom!”

The blood water suddenly boiled as if it had sensed something enter.

The crazy energy washed over Qin Yu’s body, instantly turning him into a bloody person.

His skin, bones, and meridians gradually melted and slowly regenerated in a short period.

The sensation was almost akin to being dismembered and dying slowly.

Boundless demonic qi surged into Qin Yu’s body madly. Qin Yu’s internal organs almost completely shattered and then recovered once again.

Qin Yu clenched his teeth tightly to preserve a trace of consciousness. If he fainted, everything would be for naught.

At this moment, he completely failed to control his body. The violent bone cultivation water was frantically washing through his body.

As his bones shattered again, his entire body sank into the blood water uncontrollably.

“F*ck, don’t drown!”

The man with the mustache glanced at him and said anxiously. He was about to pick up Qin Yu.

“Don’t move. Whether he can succeed or not depends on now. The success of tempering using bone cultivation water depends on whether he can keep an eye on the powerful demonic power attacking the divine sense. Physical pain is only one of them. The tempering of divine sense is even more crucial because it’s demon race’s bone cultivation water. Previously, many humans had wanted to use this bone cultivation water to temper their bodies, but none had succeeded.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Elder Guai stopped the man with the mustache.

“What happens if he fails?”

The man with the mustache asked nervously.

“He’ll become a lunatic.”

Elder Guai looked at the man with the mustache and said softly.

The instant the blood water entered Qin Yu’s head, he felt a terrifying divine sense enter his mind.

That terrifying divine sense directly destroyed all of his soul. The power of his soul he was proud of crushed at the foot of a gigantic mountain.

Two giant pupils stared at him indifferently, and a figure looking down on the world walked into Qin Yu’s consciousness.

“Boom!”

An angry dragon’s roar suddenly sounded from the blood pool, resounding throughout the entire Sumeru Space.

The man with the mustache and Elder Huai, closest to him, felt their souls hammer and almost fainted.

“What’s going on?”

The man with the mustache was shocked.

“Oh no, the consciousness of the bone cultivation water probably has sensed the aura of an outsider.”

Elder Guai clenched his fists tightly. With such a terrifying divine sense, disguising as demonic qi was useless.

A branch suddenly swung out and wanted to wrap Qin Yu up.

“Bang!”

The invisible force directly even turned the branch into powder before it got close to the blood pool.

Qin Yu felt his divine sense constantly dissipate, and his memories shatter bit by bit.

His soul was washed into countless fragments and could no longer be pieced together.

Under the furious gaze of the pupils, his body and soul slowly shattered.

The power of rebirth in the blood river was lost at once.

Ruoxue!

Rage filled Qin Yu’s eyes. He was unwilling to give out. In the last trace of memory, he suddenly had a thought.

He activated a stream of Divine Dragon Power, and a trace of Divine Dragon’s aura spread out from Qin Yu’s body on the verge of death.

The giant pupils revealed a puzzled expression. After hesitating for a moment, they finally disappeared.

The long-lost power of the blood river suddenly poured into Qin Yu’s body. His soul, skin, bones, and internal organs finally began to grow slowly.

The difference between life and death was as thin as a thread.

At the last moment, Qin Yu activated the Divine Dragon Power that he had not used for a long time and finally deceived the blood river divine sense.

At this moment, a layer of membrane seemed to have been added to his regenerated skin, bones, and internal organs.
