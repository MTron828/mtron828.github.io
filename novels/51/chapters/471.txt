Chapter 472: The Three Pure Ancient Tree Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Inside the Water Rhyme Tower, Qin Yu’s thoughts were the same as Elder Qu’s.

“You want the Water Rhyme Tower? Dream on!” Qin Yu snorted lightly.

During the conversation with Elder Qu just now, Qin Yu suddenly thought of a possibility.

Could there be a secret hidden under the Water Rhyme Tower?

Elder Qu’s men would need at least twelve hours to go back to Dongchuan to get reinforcements.

Qin Yu planned to use these twelve hours to try and see if the secret was hidden under the Water Rhyme Tower.

After everything was ready, Qin Yu began to work.

His palm flickered with light, and powerful spiritual energy gathered on Qin Yu’s fist.

In the next second, Qin Yu threw a punch at the ground!

“Boom!”

The entire ground shook! It was as if an earthquake had occurred!

Cracks began to appear on the ground.

“What a hard ground.” Looking at the cracks on the ground, Qin Yu couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

If it was ordinary ground, this punch would probably penetrate the entire area.

Without much time to think, Qin Yu continued to clench his fist and smash it at the ground.

“Boom!”

There was another loud sound! This time, the entire Water Rhyme Tower trembled slightly!

“D*mn it, could it be that this kid wants to destroy the Water Rhyme Tower?” Outside the door, Elder Qu’s expression changed and he couldn’t help but curse in a low voice.

“Boom!”

He punched again!

After three consecutive punches, the ground still couldn’t be shattered!

“Strange.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

What exactly was this ground made of? How could it be so sturdy?

Even if it was steel, it wouldn’t be able to withstand Qin Yu’s three punches!

“I don’t believe that I can’t break it!” Qin Yu snorted coldly. The energy in his entire body was gathered, and his fists shone with a dazzling golden light. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!”

Along with Qin Yu’s furious roar, the ground began to buzz, and the entire Water Rhyme Tower was on the verge of collapsing!

“Crash!”

The ground was like an eggshell as it fell down layer by layer!

One could see that there was another world beneath the ground!

“The secret is indeed hidden under the Water Rhyme Tower!” Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

The ground flickered with a dark light, and a strange internal qi came gushing over!

The increase in internal qi brought by the Water Rhyme Tower came from beneath the ground!

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it and immediately jumped down.

Under the Water Rhyme Tower, there was a dim dark green light.

Qin Yu followed the light and walked forward.

After a while, he found the source of the light.

He saw a palm-sized small tree in front of him.

The body of the tree was sparkling and translucent green, and it was emitting waves of internal qi that were like Enlightenment Tea.

As he approached the small tree, Qin Yu felt his state of mind suddenly become clear, and everything became lucid.

“The secret of the Water Rhyme Tower comes from this small tree.” Qin Yu gazed at the small dark green tree and couldn’t help but feel a little excited.

“As long as I take this small tree away, this Water Rhyme Tower will no longer have any value. What the Saint Confucian Sect obtains will only be an empty shell!” Qin Yu sneered to himself.

Thinking of this, he immediately stretched out his hand and prepared to take this little tree away.

However, just as Qin Yu’s hand was about to touch the little tree, a large saber appeared in mid-air!

The sharp saber light instantly forced Qin Yu back!

“No one is allowed to get close to the Three Pure Ancient Tree!” A cold voice came from not far away!

After raising his head, he saw a man wearing ancient clothing walking over.

“This is... a Guardian?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

It was said that supreme treasures would give birth to a spirit body responsible for protecting the treasure. This spirit body was known as the Guardian.

Qin Yu had heard of Guardians, but he had never seen one before.

Upon seeing one today, he was naturally shocked.

“So this is called the Three Pure Ancient Tree,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the Guardian and said in a negotiating tone, “The Three Pure Ancient Tree is very important to me. Why don’t you give it to me?”

The Guardian immediately shouted, “No one is allowed to get close to the Three Pure Ancient Tree!”

After saying that, he chopped down again from the sky!

Qin Yu hurriedly jumped to the side and muttered, “You have quite a temper...”

“Leave quickly!” The Guardian held the long saber in his hand and pointed it at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu touched his chin and said in a low voice, “It seems that I can’t take this Three Pure Ancient Tree away without defeating you.”

“Then... I have to fight you!”

Before he could finish his words, a golden light burst out from Qin Yu’s body!

“Come, let me see what you are capable of as a Guardian!” Qin Yu sneered.

“Swoosh!”

The Guardian immediately threw a steel knife towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique and easily dodged it.

In the next second, Qin Yu’s fist arrived in front of the head of the Guardian!

“Sorry!”

The golden fist smashed towards the Guardian’s head with brute force!

With a crisp cracking sound, the Guardian’s head exploded and his body fell straight down. After that, his body vanished into thin air.

“So it’s just a facade,” Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter as he looked at the fallen Guardian.

Then, Qin Yu walked quickly to the Three Pure Ancient Tree.

The moment he stretched out his hand, another steel saber appeared in the air!

This saber strike was much stronger than before! The terrifying saber light left white marks on Qin Yu’s body!

“No one is allowed to get close to the Three Pure Ancient Tree. Leave quickly!”

That familiar voice sounded again!

Qin Yu’s expression changed as the Guardian appeared once more!

“How could this be?” Qin Yu immediately cried out bitterly.

He had killed one, so why did another one appear?

Without any time to think, Qin Yu used the same trick again and smashed the Guardian’s head into pieces.

However, when Qin Yu got close to the Three Pure Ancient Tree for the third time, the Guardian was reborn!

Just like that, Qin Yu killed the Guardian eleven times in a row, but was still unable to obtain the Three Pure Ancient Tree.

“Something’s wrong.” Qin Yu panted heavily as he looked at the Guardian who had reincarnated for the twelfth time.

It seemed that every time the Guardian revived, his strength would increase by a lot.

The Guardian who had appeared for the first time couldn’t hurt Qin Yu at all. His long saber landed on Qin Yu’s body, but didn’t even leave a single white spot.

But the Guardian who had appeared for the eleventh time was able to break through Qin Yu’s bodily defense.

“Boom!”

He punched again and shattered the Guardian’s head. However, in less than half a minute, the Guardian appeared again.

“This won’t do. If this goes on, I’ll definitely be exhausted to death here!” Qin Yu’s expression was somewhat ugly.

He stared at the Three Pure Ancient Tree in the distance and muttered in a low voice, “Should I just give up? Absolutely not!”

As long as he obtained the Three Pure Ancient Tree, Qin Yu had the confidence to step into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm before September 9th!

Therefore, he had to get his hands on the Three Pure Ancient Tree no matter what!
