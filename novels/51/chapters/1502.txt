Chapter 1503: Chapter 1,503, power of the dragon vein

Qin Yu’s body flew back a few hundred meters. After sliding for an unknown amount of time, he finally stabilized his body.

He suddenly stood up from the ground, his expression somewhat unsightly.

“As expected, these eighteen gods are even more terrifying than I imagined,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

He lowered his head to look at his palm, only to see that it was covered in scars. Even if he used a ten thousand spell breaking punch, he wouldn’t be able to resist it.

“After the eighteen gods merged, they are really difficult to deal with.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

Before the merging, their weakness was their physical bodies. However, after the merging, it seemed that there were no flaws left.

This was naturally very bad news for Qin Yu.

What worried him the most was that the eighteen gods were relying on this body to activate the Luo Sheng sect.

If that was the case, Qin Yu would not be able to resist at all.

Not long after, the eighteen gods once again rushed in front of Qin Yu, and the first elder followed closely behind.

“Little Bastard, I’ll see where you can run to this time!”The first elder said coldly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly and said with a sneer, “I admit that the eighteen gods do have some ability, but you, the first elder, are nothing.”

The veins on the first elder’s forehead bulged, and he said coldly, “Do you think I can’t do anything to You?”

......

“What? You want to borrow a void-level artifact again?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

The first elder was stunned. He looked at Qin Yu fiercely and said, “Magical artifact is also a part of strength!”

Qin Yu laughed and said, “Yes, I agree with you! So I also prepared a gift for you.”

First Elder frowned slightly and said coldly, “You’re playing tricks, little bastard. Without Jue Wu, no one can save you.”

“Is that so? Why do I need to be saved!”Qin Yu shouted. Then, he leaped and stood a hundred meters away, looking at first elder coldly.

“Today, I’ll show you what the dragon vein of internal Qi is!”Qin Yu shouted loudly. Then, he raised both of his hands and a strong aura immediately rushed toward him.

In the next second, the Earth began to shake, and the entire Yin Palace seemed to be about to explode!

The sudden change made the first elder panic. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He flew up and frowned, “What... What is going on!”

“Boom!”

At this moment, two dragon vein of internal Qi shot out from the ground!

These were two extremely terrifying auras. They were condensed into reality, and their power was endless. It was as if two giant dragons were roaring at the top of their heads!

“Since you can borrow the void-returning tool, I can naturally borrow the power of heaven and Earth,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“Come, let me see so for myself!”

Following Qin Yu’s furious roar, he activated the two dragon vein of Yin and headed straight for the first elder!

The first elder’s expression changed drastically, and he hurriedly took out the void-returning tool to meet the attack.

A bright ray of light shot out from the void-returning tool and met the dragon vein of Yin!

However, that beam of light appeared brittle and invisible in front of the dragon vein of Yin. It was shattered the moment it came into contact with it. Even the virtual entity in his hand was trembling!

“How is this possible!”

Seeing this scene, the first elder’s expression changed drastically! He turned around and wanted to run away.

However, the dragon vein of Yin was an item born in heaven and earth after all. Now that it was used by Qin Yu, its power was not something the first elder could contend against!

“Boom!”

The yin-dragon vein hit the first Elder’s back and immediately smashed him into the ground!

His bones were shattered, and his internal organs were hit. He spat out a mouthful of blood!

“Eighteen gods, kill him quickly!”The first elder hurriedly roared.

After the eighteen gods received the order, they immediately looked at Qin Yu with cold eyes.

“Come, I’m waiting for you too,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The eighteen gods didn’t waste any words. They once again used their tough bodies to fight head-on with Qin Yu.

However, how could Qin Yu choose to fight head-on? With a loud shout, two dragon vein of Yin instantly coiled out.

“Go to hell!”

Qin Yu roared angrily. The dragon vein of Yin shot out from his shoulders and headed straight for the eighteen gods!

“Boom!”

At the instant of the collision, the eighteen gods were sent flying!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu was instantly overjoyed!

As expected, in front of the dragon vein of Yin, even the eighteen gods could not resist!

“Little Bastard...”first elder’s expression was extremely ugly. He did not expect Qin Yu to have such a move!

Looking at the two huge dragon vein of Yin that surrounded Qin Yu, first elder could not help but say with a cold face, “Who is this little bastard? Why is he able to draw upon the power of Heaven and earth...”

Without exquisite techniques, it was impossible for such power to be used by him!

Qin Yu was an itinerant cultivator, a small cultivator from a planet with dry spiritual qi. How could he have such a foundation? !

“That small place... could it be that there is another expert?”The first elder took a deep breath.

He had heard of the rumors about Earth. Rumor has it that many great cultivators at the tribulation stage had been born there.

But that was only a legend, because no one had tested it.

After seeing so for myself today, the first elder was indeed a little worried.

The eighteen gods got up from the ground. He looked down at the wounds on his body, but no expression could be seen on his face.

Qin Yu looked down at the eighteen gods and the first elder and said coldly, “None of you can leave today.”

“Little Bastard, do you really think that I can’t do anything to you with the help of the dragon vein?”The first elder narrowed his eyes and said.

“The Heavenly Cloud Sect’s foundation is not something that a person like you can imagine!”

Then, the first elder looked at the eighteen gods and said coldly, “Get rid of him directly.”

The eighteen gods did not say any nonsense and walked toward Qin Yu again.

“Today, I Will Cripple Your Heavenly Cloud Sect’s right-hand man!”Qin Yu roared. He activated the yin-dragon vein and headed straight for the eighteen celestials!

The eighteen celestials raised their hands and glided quickly, condensing a pitch-black void in front of him in an instant!

This technique was created by the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s sect master, the Luo Sheng Gate!

The Luo Sheng Gate was opened, and they planned to directly enter the yin-dragon vein!

“Come, let me see how your Luo Sheng Gate controls the power of Heaven and Earth!”Qin Yu roared.

The dragon vein of Yin was born from heaven and earth, and it was extremely mysterious. Only by relying on special methods could one borrow its power.

And this power was lying on the ground, unable to be moved, unable to move! Unless it was someone with great fortune, someone who could change the heaven and earth, who could shake the dragon vein of Yin!

Qin Yu did not believe that the cultivation of these eighteen gods had already reached that realm!

“Weng!”

The dragon vein entered the Luo Sheng Gate and disappeared without a trace.

Not far away, the first elder immediately laughed out loud when he saw this, “Hahahaha! So what if you can borrow the power of Heaven and earth! It’s still hard to escape death today!”

But at this moment, the first Elder’s laughter came to an abrupt end.

Luo Sheng Sect was trembling non-stop. In the next second, it actually exploded!

“Are you laughing? Why aren’t you laughing?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at the first elder coldly.

One of his hands was twining around a dragon vein. His eyes were fixed on the first elder.

“Old Dog, I’m coming to take your life right now,”Qin Yu said coldly.
