2339 Sneak Attack

The sight frightened Qin Yu. How big was the stomach of this Pi Xiu to have such a heaven-devouring effect!

Elder Guai reminded him at the side.

Qin Yu only noticed Pi Xiu’s stomach rumbling and a water blade directly cut across in the next moment.

“Whoosh!”

The nearby massive mountain forest instantly split into two, and the bone cultivation water spewed out after being compressed by Pi Xiu’s stomach.

Under immense pressure, the bone cultivation water instantly turned into a sharp divine weapon.

Even the sturdy mountains and forests of the eighth level of purgatory were cut into halves.

Jue Wu grabbed Qin Yu and jumped up, dodging the blade!

Elder Guai also took out his newly refined shield to block this attack, but his body was sent flying.

“Elder Guai, enter the Sumeru ring!”

Qin Yu pulled Elder Guai into the Sumeru ring. This Pi Xiu was not easy to deal with, and Elder Guai would only become a target if he remained outside.

He stared at Pi Xiu with a solemn expression. This demonic beast that had already condensed human nature was definitely an outstanding ninth-grade.

“No one can escape. It’s the sacred river of our demon race. When has it become a place for the human race to greedily absorb it?”

The rage showed on Pi Xiu’s face. He had been in retreat at the ninth level.

However, he noticed that the energy of the bone cultivation water had decreased significantly, and a human was absorbing the energy greedily.

“Bullsh*t! I said this Bone Cultivation River is mine.”

Jue Wu was not afraid at all and rushed forward.

“You’re courting death!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Another water blade slashed out. This time, it was tremendously fast. Jue Wu could only throw a punch on the water blade.

“Draw a knife to cut the water, and the water flows even more.”

Not only did the water blade not dissipate, but it also slashed at Jue Wu at an even more terrifying speed.

Only a deep, muffled tremor was heard, and the space was compressed to an extent visible to the naked eye.

A vast amount of spatial qi was compressed into a fist-sized crystal. Pi Xiu suddenly kicked at the spatial crystal.

The spatial crystal instantly exploded at the bottom of the river, and the river water shot out like an arrow.

The space shook violently. Even cultivators who had reached the seventh and eighth grades of True Saint could feel the tremors in the space spreading to their bodies.

Those with slightly weaker cultivation actually fainted from the shock.

The river water shot toward Jue Wu at a terrifying speed. It was so fast that even Qin Yu’s divine sense could not keep up.

Jue Wu blocked the water arrow with one hand.

“The entire river is my weapon. How do you resist?”

Pi Xiu looked at the sky. In the extremely distant high sky, a waterfall cascaded down and smashed onto Jue Wu’s body.

Qin Yu’s face was somewhat pale. He did not know if Jue Wu could withstand it.

Pi Xiu’s innate rules of space could actually compress a vast amount of gas in the air to the size of a fist.

Moreover, he could use the rules as he pleased. In the blink of an eye, the bone cultivation water was sent to the sky.

There was no way to predict such an attack.

“F*ck you!”

Jue Wu was furious. A layer of black “cloak” appeared on her body.

Upon closer inspection, it was a layer of red, almost black, fiery clothing burning to the extreme.

The bone cultivation water turned into a vast white mist and vanished before it could even get close to Jue Wu.

The waterfall descending from the high sky carried the force of a thousand pounds and crashed down like a mountain. However, it could not even approach Jue Wu within a hundred meters.

“Cloak of the Fire Phoenix.”

With a move of her body, Jue Wu suddenly charged toward Pi Xiu.

Jue Wu grabbed her Cloak of the Fire Phoenix with one hand and threw it toward Pi Xiu like a fishing net.

The Cloak of the Fire Phoenix instantly turned into a fire net that covered the sky and the earth and toward Pi Xiu.

Pi Xiu’s expression changed drastically. He took a deep breath.

“What a waste!”

Qin Yu sighed. She was just a little bit away from being able to trap that demon race.

“D*mn it! This guy has escaped. He only knows how to act tough,” Jue Wu cursed.

Qin Yu was about to say something, but his expression changed drastically. A dense power of divine sense suddenly wrapped him up like an egg.

A blade of space was stabbed into the egg formed by the Spiritualization Technique but dented by dozens of centimeters. The sharp blade was pressed against Qin Yu’s throat but grabbed by countless divine sense powers and could not advance any further.

“I’ll remember this. One day, the demonic qi in your body will return to the river of my demon race. This time, I’ll take back some of my capital first.”

A water blade suddenly slashed out from the void, cutting dozens of human cultivators into two.

The indifferent voice slowly returned to silence and then completely disappeared.

“You’re courting death! You dare to sneak attack!”

Jue Wu pulled the Cloak of the Fire Phoenix and spread it out again. However, it was still a moment behind Pi Xiu’s escape.

“D*mn it! This damned thing.”

Qin Yu’s forehead was covered in a cold sweat. This thing was proficient in the rules of space, and it was definitely not a good thing to be targeted by such a demon race.

“What a pity. If he dares to appear again, I’m confident that I can capture him. I haven’t eaten the flesh of this demon race yet.”

Jue Wu waited quietly for a moment before she walked over with a regretful expression.

“Four-sided Mirror!”

“Mountain Seal!”

In an instant, four giant mirrors appeared in Jue Wu’s front, back, left, and right.

The mirror emitted a strong and intense light, and the shadow on the ground was reflected into the four-sided mirror.

The shadow on the ground was locked down like a chain. Hundreds of talismans passed through it.

That was a Spirit Sealing Talisman!

It actually wanted to seal Jue Wu’s spiritual energy entirely. Then, a seal spiraled above Jue Wu.

The massive mountain aura completely suppressed the entire space.

Two Saint Weapons!

Two people slowly walked over. One had the appearance of a handsome scholar, while the other exuded an aura as sinister as a venomous snake.

“You didn’t use your full strength, did you? When Pi Xiu was fighting, this woman had been protecting you.”

The scholar activated the Four-sided Mirror with one hand while looking at Qin Yu.

“Hand over Suo Lin and the coffin of nine lifetimes, and we won’t make things difficult for you.”

The dark vulture cultivator walked forward and suddenly made a move.

The two had a tacit understanding and should have already discussed it earlier.

“You want to stop me with just these two broken things?”

Jue Wu instantly put on a fire cloak, and that shadow started to tremble violently.

The violent tremors were transmitted to the Four-sided Mirror. In an instant, countless fine cracks appeared on the mirror before it exploded.

She threw a punch at the seal in the sky, and it was instantly sent flying.

“D*mn it! Why is this woman’s strength so powerful? Quickly leave!”

The white-robed scholar’s expression changed drastically.
