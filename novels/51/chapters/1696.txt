“HMM? There’s another top-notch martial artist?”The old man’s face was filled with surprise when he saw this.

Qin Yu could not help but be slightly startled. He looked at the black void that was slowly disappearing in front of him and quickly recognized this technique. It was none other than Xiao Sheng’s Rashomon!

Soon, Xiao Sheng, who was dressed in long clothes and had long hair, walked over from a short distance away.

His footsteps were quite slow, and the internal Qi on his body was not strong. It was impossible to tell that he was a top expert.

“Meddling in other people’s business?”The young man said with a cold face.

Xiao Sheng did not say anything. He walked to Qin Yu’s side and stopped.

“You… Why are you here?”Qin Yu could not help but be a little surprised.

Xiao Sheng did not say anything. He just looked at the two people opposite him.

“What do you mean by this, sir?”The old man asked.

Xiao Sheng faintly smiled and said, “To save people.”

“Save people? Do you know who we are?”The old man said with a cold face.

Xiao Sheng faintly smiled and said, “No matter who you are, this is the South Province.”

“What? Do you think the South Province is your territory?”The young man said somewhat angrily.

Xiao Sheng put his hands behind his back and said, “You can say that.”

“I think you’re courting death!”

The young man shouted and charged straight at Xiao Sheng!

Xiao Sheng was unhurried and raised his palm to meet the attack.

“Boom!”

A terrifying airwave instantly spread out. The young man was actually forced back a few steps by Xiao Sheng!

The old man’s expression became even colder. He looked at Xiao Sheng in front of him and said, “Sir, do you really want to go against us? Have you considered the consequences?”

Xiao Sheng smiled and said, “I will definitely save him. You can try.”

“You!”The young man gritted his teeth, but he did not act rashly. He only sneered and said, “You will regret what you did today.”

“Perhaps.”Xiao Sheng was not flustered.

The old man narrowed his eyes and said, “You will definitely pay the price for offending us.”

After saying that, he looked at Qin Yu and sneered, “Keep the things with you for the time being. We will get them back. See You Again.”

After saying that, they turned around and left. They were very straightforward and didn’t stay for a second.

After they left, Qin Yu looked at Xiao Sheng and said, “Thank you.”

Xiao Sheng shook his head and didn’t say anything else.

Qin Yu said worriedly, “I’m afraid these two people are not from the South Province. I’m afraid they have some big background. You…”

Qin Yu didn’t finish his words, but his intention was very obvious.

If they took revenge on Xiao Sheng, it would be a disaster.

“No worries, don’t worry,”Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu smiled bitterly. He cupped his hands to Xiao Sheng and said, “I will never forget the favor of saving my life.”

Xiao Sheng glanced at Qin Yu and smiled without saying a word.

He raised his hand and gently patted Qin Yu’s shoulder. Then, he turned around and left.

Looking at Xiao Sheng’s back as he left, Qin Yu had mixed feelings.

This Xiao Sheng was really strange. No one could figure out what he was thinking.

I hope they won’t come too early, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu didn’t dare to stay any longer and hurriedly turned around to leave.

He planned to find a place to study the connection between this token and the venerable fifth mountain.

…

In the northern lands.

The Dead River became narrower and narrower. It was more than a thousand feet long at the beginning, but now it was only a few dozen meters long.

The speed of change was too fast, making it impossible for people not to worry.

Sima bei and he teng stood on the side of the Dead River and quietly looked at the other side.

“According to this progress, the Dead River will disappear very soon,”Sima Bei said quietly.

He Teng, who was by the side, said, intentionally or unintentionally, “Now that you have already stepped into the reversion void stage, I want to conquer the South region. I don’t even need the master to make a move.”

Sima bei’s expression changed slightly. He glanced at he teng and said, “I will not make a move against Saint Xiao.”

“Why? Are you afraid of Him? You are now at the reversion void stage.”He Teng smiled faintly.

Sima bei did not say anything. He naturally had the thought of challenging Xiao Sheng.

Even when he first stepped into the reversion void stage, his first thought was to go to Vietnam to fight Xiao Sheng.

But when he heard that Zhao Jing was defeated by Xiao Sheng, this thought immediately disappeared without a trace.

“How is Yongji Now?”At this time, Sima Bei suddenly changed the topic. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He teng smiled and said, “Yongji is, after all, once the top person in the southern region. His talent doesn’t need to be mentioned, and he works extremely hard. I think it won’t be long before he can step into the return to void realm.”

Sima bei did not speak, but the expression on his face was somewhat strange.

He Teng seemed to have seen through his thoughts and immediately said, “You plan to let Yongji Take Action?”

“That’s right.”Sima bei did not hide his thoughts.

“Hasn’t he always wanted to prove himself? This opportunity is given to him.”

After saying this, Sima bei turned around and left.

He Teng, however, sneered in his heart. No one knew what he was thinking.

…

Qin Yu found an inn and temporarily stayed there.

He pointed with his finger, and a ray of light fell on the door, completely sealing the room.

Following that, Qin Yu took out the divine tea token from the spatial magic artifact.

At this moment, the token was extremely quiet, but it was indeed emitting a strong dark energy.

Qin Yu sniffed hard. The purity of this dark energy was something that Qin Yu had never encountered before.

“Could it be that the ancient underworld really exists?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. Satan was a legendary figure.

There were many legends about the divine tea on earth, but the timing didn’t match at all.

The divine tea was only a figure from a few thousand years ago, and this divine tea token probably had a history of tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years.

Following that, Qin Yu took out the venerable fifth mountain.

He placed the venerable fifth mountain and the divine tea token together, and in an instant, both the token and the venerable fifth mountain began to emit light.

The two streams of light interweaved, as if forming some kind of connection, as if they were going to be resurrected on their own!

Qin Yu was instantly shocked. He sat at the side, not daring to move, quietly watching the interaction between them.

But this light continued for a long time, but there was no next step.

“What’s going on?”Qin Yu frowned slightly. He wanted to find a connection between them, but he had no clue.

Qin Yu tried to activate the token, but unfortunately, it had no effect.

“This token of Satan… how should I activate it? Why does that young man want this token so badly?”Qin Yu stroked his chin and pondered for a long time.

“Could it be… that this token is the key to the ancient underworld?”A bold idea suddenly popped up in Qin Yu’s mind!

This was because the venerable fifth mountain itself was related to the underworld, and the token of Satan could be connected to it. This made people suspicious!

This was just Qin Yu’s guess, but he was sure that Satan’s ancient underworld really existed!

As for where it was, no one knew.

“If Satan’s ancient underworld exists, then what about the ancient heavenly court? Could it be true as well?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be startled. All sorts of rumors he had heard on Earth and what the Heavenly Court should look like quickly appeared in his mind.
