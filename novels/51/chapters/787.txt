Chapter 788: Obtaining the Power of a Martial Saint! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Waves of killing intent emanated from that finger as it headed straight for Qin Yu’s chest!

However, Qin Yu didn’t move at all. His face showed a few traces of coldness.

“Chi la!”

These few rays of light directly grabbed onto Qin Yu’s chest!

However, the scene of him being gutted didn’t appear. Only a few white scars were left on Qin Yu’s chest!

Elder Zhao’s expression changed. He was about to retreat, but it was too late!

Qin Yu stretched out his hand and grabbed Elder Zhao’s head, forcefully lifting him into the air!

Elder Zhao struggled desperately, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“Elder Zhao, is there a need to fight?” Qin Yu asked.

Elder Zhao struggled desperately and roared, “The winner hasn’t been decided yet!”

Seeing this, Qin Yu could only sigh.

The strength of his hand grew stronger and stronger. Elder Zhao’s head immediately felt like it was about to split open. There were even cracking sounds!

“Ah!!” The pain caused Elder Zhao to let out a series of mournful wails!

Everyone from the Xue family was dumbstruck!

This peak-stage Martial Marquis was actually so weak in Qin Yu’s hands?!

“Alright, Qin Yu, that’s enough. Let go of Elder Zhao.” Xue Yujie quickly said.

Only then did Qin Yu let go of Elder Zhao and casually threw him to the side.

“How is it? I didn’t lie to you guys, right?” Qin Yu spread his hands and said.

The people from the Xue family couldn’t help but laugh bitterly.

Such strength was truly shocking.

“No wonder your Pavilion Master kept praising you to me and even said that you would become a Martial Saint... . .” Xue Yuzhi sighed with emotion.

“Become a Martial Saint?” Xue Yujie raised his brows.

Xue Yuzhi smiled and said, “Yes, the Pavilion Master of Pyro’s Divine Alchemist Pavilion once said that Qin Yu might become the first person to become a Martial Saint and break the deadlock.”

This immediately shocked Xue Yujie.

One must know that a Martial Saint hadn’t appeared for many years!

If he were to become a Martial Saint in this world, then it wouldn’t be too much for him to lead the entire martial arts world!

“Mr. Xue, if this Martial Saint’s power is injected into my body, it will definitely bring out the greatest effect. What do you think?” Qin Yu asked.

Xue Yujie touched his chin and said, “Once this Martial Saint’s power is used, it will be gone. What benefits will it bring if it is injected into your body?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said with a smile, “Mr. Xue, the reason why you value the Martial Saint’s power so much is also to protect the Xue family, right?”

“That’s right.” Xue Yujie nodded.

Qin Yu continued, “However, the power of the Martial Saint can only be used once. In other words, it can only protect you guys once. If you guys have enemies in the dark, then after using the power of the Martial Saint, you will attract a disaster.”

“But if you guys gift the power of the Martial Saint to me, then it will be different. I, Qin Yu, will owe you guys a big favor. As long as I am alive, I will be able to protect the Xue family forever.”

When they heard this, the Xue family members looked at each other.

Obviously, they were moved.

If it was as Xue Yuzhi said, Qin Yu would become a Martial Saint, then this deal wouldn’t be a loss.

“How about this, you go back first and let us discuss. How about it?” Xue Yujie said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Of course, no problem.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

“By the way, can you give Hou Xin to me?” Qin Yu asked.

“What do you want him for?” Xue Yujie said with some confusion.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “He’s useful to me.”

Xue Yujie didn’t ask any further. He nodded and said, “No problem. I’ll have someone send him to your room later.”

“Thank you.” Qin Yu nodded.

After Qin Yu returned, about ten minutes later, someone brought Hou Xin to the room.

Upon seeing Qin Yu, Hou Xin’s expression immediately turned extremely ugly.

“Qin... Qin Yu, what do you want to do?” Hou Xin said with some fear.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t be nervous. I’m just more interested in your spiritual fire.”

“What do you mean?!” Hou Xin suddenly felt a bad premonition.

Qin Yu said, “You have purple spiritual fire, right?”

Hou Xin took two steps back and said, “So what if I do, so what if I don’t?!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “I haven’t swallowed purple spiritual fire yet... hand over the spiritual fire yourself, and I will spare your life. How about it?”

“In your dreams!” Hou Xin was immediately dumbfounded!

“This beautiful spiritual fire is the foundation of my existence, so don’t even think about taking it away!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Do you think you have the right to refuse?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Hou Xin cracked a smile and said, “Then kill me. Even if you kill me, I won’t give you the spiritual fire!”

Qin Yu’s expression instantly turned cold.

He looked down at Hou Xin and said coldly, “I don’t necessarily want your spiritual fire. I’m giving you a chance to live.”

Hou Xin was extremely stubborn and had a determined look on his face.

“The man with the mustache, do you have any means of torturing people?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache rubbed his hands and said with a smile, “There are many ways!”

The man with the mustache stretched out his palm and a jar half the height of a man fell in front of the two people.

“This jar is called the dark prison jar. It is said that after being thrown into the dark prison jar, the body and spiritual sense will suffer a strong blow,” the man with the mustache said.

“Up to now, no one has been able to spend ten hours in this dark prison jar.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “Good stuff.”

Therefore, Qin Yu flicked his finger and broke Hou Xin’s four limbs.

Before Hou Xin could howl, Qin Yu threw him into the dark prison jar.

“Is this thing reliable?” After putting Hou Xin in, Qin Yu asked with some doubt.

The man with the mustache patted his chest and said, “Don’t worry, he will definitely beg for mercy before long!”

...

In the hall of the villa.

The members of the Xue family gathered together.

“The strength of the Purple Flame Sect is unfathomable. Qin Yu is indeed the best choice,” Xue Yujie said in a deep voice.

“Yes, if the power of a Martial Saint is injected into Elder Zhao’s body, Elder Zhao might not be able to deal with the Purple Flame Sect.”

“If we lose, we will definitely suffer inhuman torture.”

At this point, Old Master Xue said in a low voice, “Who can guarantee that Qin Yu is reliable? What if he disappears after he has obtained the power of the Martial Saint?”

“That shouldn’t be possible. After all, he was introduced by the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.” Xue Yuzhi said.

The Xue family members were relatively more at ease with regards to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

“Yuzhi, you should call the Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” Xue Yujie suggested.

Xue Yuzhi nodded. She took out her hand and called the Pavilion Master.

A few minutes later, Xue Yuzhi walked back.

She smiled and said, “The Pavilion Master of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion said that Qin Yu is 100% trustworthy. If anything happens, she is willing to bear the responsibility.”

The few of them looked at each other and seemed to have reached a consensus.

Old Master Xue slowly stood up.

He swept his gaze across the crowd and said in a deep voice, “Then inject the power of the Martial Saint into Qin Yu’s body.”
