2333 The Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique

Behind him, there was a clash of light and fire.

In his body, remnants of the Vermilion Bird’s flame madly ravaged his vitality.

Initially, he had suppressed it, relying on his divine sense.

However, as the Vermilion Bird’s strength recovered, the remnants of the fire seemed to have restored their terrifying strength and wreaked havoc within Qin Yu’s body.

…

“He actually succeeded! How did this kid do it?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jiang Qingyuan stood up abruptly, his face filled with disbelief.

A few of them looked at each other. Even Si Fei, who had been mocking Qin Yu earlier, could not hide the shock on his face.

“Even if the power of the Path of Heaven had suppressed the Vermilion Bird, it was not something this kid could deal with.”

“However, it’s also a good thing. With the removal of the curse of the Nirvana Body, no one can estimate its achievements in the future. The human race will also have an additional great combat strength.”

Gu Baiyi was delighted.

No one was optimistic that Qin Yu could come out after he entered the barrier.

Due to their responsibilities, they could not make a move. However, they did not expect the Nirvana Body to carry Qin Yu and escape at the end.

“Did you guys notice an additional internal qi inside the barrier? It seemed to be a weak demonic qi, but the Vermilion Bird actually did not attack it!”

Yan Minglong said with a frown. They had been staying on this battlefield to monitor the various forces, but this was the first time he felt such an internal qi.

Instantly, everyone realized what Yan Minglong had said.

And not long after, a young man slowly walked out. The Vermillion Bird in a fiery red dress was behind him.

The young man glanced toward Yan Minglong and the others, and a smile appeared on his face. He then led the Vermilion Bird into the depths of the mist.

“The Vermillion Bird actually left the barrier! At that time, he had signed a contract with that person to take back her tomb. How could she walk out of the barrier?”

“And something seemed wrong with the demon race young man in front of her. It seems that he has subdued the Vermilion Bird. Otherwise, the Vermilion Bird wouldn’t have come out.”

Regardless of the Vermilion Bird or the mysterious person, this change would affect the balance of power in the ninth level of purgatory.

They would only compromise if their strength was completely suppressed. This meant that this young man’s strength was not as simple as it appeared on the surface.

…

“Let’s return to Solitary Cloud City first.”

Qin Yu said tiredly.

The physical body was the carrier of the soul, and his physical body had now been completely destroyed.

When the soul moved, it required an enormous consumption of the power of the soul.

Jue Wu directly brought Qin Yu back to Solitary Cloud City.

There was a kind of internal qi in Solitary Cloud City, and no one dared to attack casually. Even the evil exterminator was a little concerned.

Therefore, Solitary Cloud City was the safest choice.

Just before she stepped into the Solitary Cloud City, a sense of danger suddenly spread throughout Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

“Jue Wu, watch out!”

Qin Yu shouted.

In that space, a ripple floated past.

And in that void came the delicate sound of abacus beads. Each sound was extremely faint, but there were countless of them.

Hundreds of millions of compass beads slowly appeared in the void, and the vibration of the countless beads echoed.

The souls of the people and demon beasts that passed by tens of thousands of meters away suddenly shattered, turning into corpses that fell onto the ground.

“The Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique!”

A monk appeared above Jue Wu. Countless Buddhist lights surged from his back and entered the compass in the void.

In the void, a fist suddenly blasted toward Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

Jue Wu looked furious, and she pulled Qin Yu to her back.

Then she threw a punch at the fist but immediately felt something not right.

As the two fists collided, they passed through each other.

Jue Wu’s fist directly passed through the Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique and landed on the ground. In an instant, the ground and mountain shook.

Not only did the Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique pass through her arms and body, but it also blasted straight at Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

This punch seemed to have come from a different dimension.

After deducing countless billions of times, the fist would definitely land on Qin Yu’s body in time to come.

After throwing out that punch, Hua Tian’s face turned pale as if he had used up all his strength, and his body slowly disappeared.

Jue Wu let out a furious roar. However, no matter what she did, she could not block this fist.

“Boom!”

The Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique finally landed on Qin Yu’s body. In an instant, this force released its original energy within his skeleton.

This energy did not destroy Qin Yu’s skeleton. Instead, it went up along his bones and exploded in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

In an instant, Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness seemed to have detonated a bomb.

Countless soul powers collapsed and dissipated one after another. Qin Yu was completely powerless in facing the power of this Great Expansion Divine Technique.

When he fought with the Vermilion Bird, he had almost exhausted the most potent power of the spirit bead.

At this moment, facing Hua Tian, who had lurked for a long time, he could only rely on himself to take this full-powered attack.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and used the remaining power of the soul in his sea of consciousness to punch at the Fist of the Great Expansion Divine Technique with all his might. The fist suddenly smashed toward the origin of Qin Yu’s divine sense at the end.

In an instant, Qin Yu directly passed out. Countless cracks appeared on the skeletons of his body.

He spat out a large mouthful of blood and fainted.

In a dense forest near Solitary Cloud City, Hua Tian’s face was ashen and revealed a trace of unwillingness.

“I can’t even kill you like this? How powerful is this guy’s soul?”

He did not expect Qin Yu’s body and soul to be so powerful. He had practiced the Three Lives Reincarnation of the scholar and experienced the terrifying torture of Nightmare. His soul was almost indestructible.

If Qin Yu’s current state were not extremely poor, Hua Tian’s Great Expansion Divine Technique might not even be able to hurt him.

“Master, do we just give up like this? I think Qin Yu probably can no longer counterattack after receiving this punch of yours.”

Nangong Qi asked. He did not know why Hua Tian had immediately retreated.

“The heavenly secret has countless variables. Although he suffered a huge blow, the Nirvana Body actually came into contact with the curse. The current Nirvana Body is tremendously terrifying. It’s irrational to fight head-on.”

Hua Tian shook his head, although Jue Wu could not withstand the Fist of Great Expansion Divine Technique just now.
