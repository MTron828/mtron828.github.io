Chapter 110: The Loyal Yao Qing Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Yao Qing’s tone made Liu Shihui very unhappy.

He looked at Yao Qing with a bit of amusement and said, “What if I insist on going in?”

Yao Qing’s expression changed. He gritted his teeth and said, “Then I won’t be polite.”

When he heard this, Liu Shihui couldn’t help but laugh and said, “A trash at the seventh stage of Inner Strength dares to act so cocky in front of me. You think too highly of yourself.”

When he heard this, Yao Qing suddenly trembled!

Liu Shihui could accurately state his level of strength, which meant that he was definitely above him!

“No need to guess.” Liu Shihui sneered.

“I am an Inner Strength Master Hands at stage two. Get lost!” Liu Shihui said in a somewhat commanding tone.

The level of an Inner Strength Master Hands and someone at the seventh stage of Inner Strength were worlds apart. Yao Qing had no chance of winning!

However, Yao Qing still braced himself and stood in front of Liu Shihui.

“Young Master Liu, I’m really sorry. Mr. Qin, he...”

“Slap!”

Before Yao Qing could finish his words, Liu Shihui slapped Yao Qing’s face!

“Who do you think you are? You’re just a lap dog. How dare you block my way?!” Liu Shihui scolded coldly.

“Get out of my way, or I’ll cripple you!” Liu Shihui was burning with murderous intent!

Yao Qing gritted his teeth and said, “Liu Shihui, I told you. Mr. Qin won’t see any guests!”

“You’re really a loyal lap dog.” Liu Shihui’s expression became colder and colder.

“Young Master Liu, let us cripple this kid!” Liu Shihui’s follower said.

Liu Shihui waved his hand and said coldly, “No, I want to personally play with him.”

After saying that, Liu Shihui looked at Yao Qing and said indifferently, “Kid, I’ll let you see the strength of an Inner Strength Master Hands Hands!”

As soon as he said that, Liu Shihui clenched his fist and rushed towards Yao Qing!

Yao Qing knew that he was no match for Liu Shihui, so he hurriedly stepped back.

“Humph, too slow.” Liu Shihui sneered. With a shake of his feet, he instantly arrived in front of Yao Qing!

Then, Liu Shihui punched Yao Qing’s chest!

Yao Qing’s body was immediately sent flying. He slid on the ground for several meters before he stabilized his body!

A mouthful of blood spurted out from his mouth!

“How strong...” Yao Qing’s expression was a bit ugly. The reputation of an Inner Strength Master Hands Hands was indeed well-deserved!

“What, is that all you’ve got?” Liu Shihui said with a bit of amusement.

With nimble steps, he soon arrived in front of Yao Qing.

“You’re just a lap dog. I’ll have some fun with you today.” Liu Shihui looked down at Yao Qing and beckoned.

Yao Qing gritted his teeth and struggled to get up from the ground.

However, just as he got up, Liu Shihui kicked him!

Yao Qing was sent flying again and crashed into the wall!

“What? You can’t even stand up?” Liu Shihui sneered.

“Liu Shihui, don’t go too far!” Yao Qing roared and jumped up from the ground!

Then, he clenched his fist and took the initiative to rush towards Liu Shihui!

“You’re too big for your britches,” Liu Shihui said coldly.

Just when Yao Qing’s fist was about to punch him, Liu Shihui suddenly reached out and grabbed Yao Qing’s fist.

“That’s all you’ve got?” Liu Shihui said with a sneer.

Yao Qing’s expression was extremely ugly!

This punch almost used up all his strength, but it was easily caught by Liu Shihui!

Yao Qing used all his strength to struggle, but he found that he couldn’t break free!

“What, don’t you have other tricks?” Liu Shihui said sinisterly.

As he spoke, he exerted more strength! Then, he pulled back forcefully, and a crisp sound came from Yao Qing’s arm!

“Ouch! ! !” Yao Qing couldn’t help but scream in pain!

His arm was forcefully broken by Liu Shihui!

“You’ve been tortured by me to this extent, yet Qin Yu still doesn’t seem to be coming out. Looks like he doesn’t really care about a lap dog like you.” Liu Shihui slowly walked over to Yao Qing.

Yao Qing’s face was filled with sweat. The intense pain made his entire body tremble, and he found it difficult to support himself!

“As a lap dog, you have to behave like a lap dog. Kneel down for me!” Liu Shihui said coldly.

“In your dreams!” Yao Qing gritted his teeth and said angrily.

Liu Shihui narrowed his eyes and sneered. “Fine, if you don’t kneel, I will force you to kneel!”

After saying that, he raised his palm and punched Yao Qing’s shoulder!

A huge force immediately pressed down on Yao Qing, who felt as if he was carrying two huge mountains on his shoulders!

Under this huge force, Yao Qing’s bones even emitted cracking sounds, as if they were going to break at any time!

But even so, Yao Qing still stubbornly stood in place without allowing his legs to go soft!

“You’re holding on quite well.” Liu Shihui said coldly.

“I want to see how long you can hold on!” After saying that, Liu Shihui raised his leg and kicked Yao Qing’s knee!

“Ouch!”

Finally, Yao Qing’s legs went soft, and with a bang, he knelt on the ground.

“Hahaha!” Liu Shihui couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“It seems that your backbone isn’t as strong as your bones,” Liu Shihui said with a playful look.

As Yao Qing kneeled on the ground, he wanted to struggle, but his legs were broken and he couldn’t stand up at all!

“Young Master Liu.” At this moment, Liu Shihui’s henchman suddenly walked over.

“What?” Liu Shihui glanced at him.

The henchman hurriedly said, “Young Master Liu, I suspect that Qin Yu is using that Chinese knotweed to enter closed-door cultivation!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

When he heard this, Liu Shihui’s expression instantly changed drastically!

“Young Master Liu, we can’t delay any longer. If we delay any further, I’m afraid we won’t be able to get that Chinese knotweed back,” the henchman said with a somewhat anxious tone.

Liu Shihui couldn’t help but fly into a rage! He looked coldly at Yao Qing and said, “How dare you waste my time! Let me tell you, if the Chinese knotweed is gone, I’ll kill you!”

After saying that, Liu Shihui hurriedly walked into the villa.

At this moment, Liu Shihui’s legs were suddenly grabbed by something, and he instantly stopped in his footsteps!

He looked down and saw that Yao Qing was tightly holding onto his calf and didn’t allow him to move!

“Mr. Qin said that he won’t see any guests...” Yao Qing said while gritting his teeth.

Liu Shihui said furiously, “Are you courting death?! Get lost!”

After saying that, Liu Shihui, wanting to kick Yao Qing away, shook his leg forcefully.

However, Yao Qing seemed to have lost his mind. He desperately clung to Liu Shihui’s leg, and Liu Shihui was unable to shake Yao Qing off!

“You’re courting death!” This completely infuriated Liu Shihui!

He raised his other leg and kicked Yao Qing’s body with all his might!

One kick, two kicks, three kicks...

Liu Shihui’s strength was extremely great. Yao Qing’s mouth kept spitting out blood, but even so, Yao Qing still didn’t have the slightest intention of letting go!

“You motherf * cker, let go of me!” Liu Shihui shouted and almost lost it.

“I... I won’t let go...” Yao Qing spat out these few words with difficulty.

Liu Shihui grimaced and said, “Okay, I will kill you now!”
