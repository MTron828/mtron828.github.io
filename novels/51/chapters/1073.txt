Chapter 1074: Chapter 1,074, the mystic realm will bear the consequences 

Everyone was stunned when they heard Qin Yu’s words.

Although they had guessed that a quarrel would break out between the two of them, they did not expect Qin Yu to be so straightforward.

Yan Jinyao’s face could not help but darken. He snorted coldly and said, “Vulgar person.”

“If you dare to talk nonsense again, do you believe that I will tear your mouth apart for you?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and sneered.

Yan Jinyao’s expression changed and he could not help but say angrily, “Qin Yu, don’t go too far. Do you think I am afraid of You!”

“Slap!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly slapped Yan Jinyao’s face.

The force of this slap was very small and it could not hurt him at all. However, it was extremely humiliating.

“I will teach you a small lesson.”Qin Yu grinned and said.

“You!”Yan Jinyao was instantly furious. He strode towards Qin Yu with the intention to attack!

“You two better stop.”

At this moment, ye Qing suddenly walked out and stopped the two of them.

Qin Yu glanced at ye Qing and said, “Give commander ye some face. I Won’t beat you up today.”

“Beat me up? Do you have the ability to do that?”Yan Jinyao said coldly.

Qin Yu said sarcastically, “Yan Jinyao, I’ll tell you a secret secretly. The Yan family has a powerful bloodline power, but the person who awakened the bloodline is not you, but my wife, Yan Ruoxue!”

“Also, the people of the Yan family came, and they told me that you are a piece of trash. The bloodline you stole is not even worth mentioning, it’s even worse than a dog.”

Yan Jinyao could not hold it in any longer. He glared at Qin Yu and said through gritted teeth, “What nonsense are you talking about!”

“What? You Don’t believe me?”Qin Yu sneered.

“Didn’t you notice that no one could find Yan Ruoxue? It was because the Yan family took her away. They even observed you and said that you are too trash. You are even worse than a piece of SH * t from the Yan family. TSK TSK.”

Yan Jinyao was so angry that his face turned red. He clenched his fists tightly and a terrifying killing intent swept through the entire room.

“Qin Yu, I want to fight you!”Yan Jinyao said with a red face.

Qin Yu sneered, “I’ve been waiting for you to say that.”

“Okay! I’ll see you in three days!”Yan Jinyao said coldly.

“There’s no need for three days. You and I can go out now,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.

He looked at his watch and said, “There are three minutes left. Three minutes is more than enough to take care of a trash like you.”

“You’re courting death!”Yan Jinyao couldn’t hold it in any longer. He clenched his fist and rushed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yu tilted his body slightly and easily dodged it.

“Your fist is soft and powerless. Are You a Sissy?”Qin Yu said with a smile.

“You... You!”Yan Jinyao was so angry that he was gasping for breath.

He was born in an aristocratic family, so he didn’t know any vulgar words. After being scolded by Qin Yu, he could only endure it.

“Come, Stomp Your Feet for me. Don’t women like to stomp their feet when they’re angry?”Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Don’t be anxious. I’ll take off your pants in three days to see if you have that thing.”

“You F * cking haven’t grown!”Yan Jinyao roared angrily.

Qin Yu sneered, “You have grown? A Bug?”

“You... pfft!”

In his anger, Yan Jinyao suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

“Interesting, you can’t take it anymore? Yan Jinyao, we have to be magnanimous,”Qin Yu said with a smile. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yan Jinyao wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said, “Just you wait... even if I die, I’ll kill you...”

Just as Qin Yu was about to mock him a little more, Mr. Zhou walked over from not far away.

“What are you talking about? You are chatting so enthusiastically,”Mr. Zhou said with a smile.

Qin Yu hurriedly said with a serious expression, “Greetings, Mr. Zhou.”

Mr. Zhou had once helped Qin Yu. If it weren’t for him, he would have been imprisoned long ago. Therefore, he still needed to have the necessary respect.

“Qin Yu, you really didn’t disappoint me.”Mr. Zhou patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said.

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Mr. Zhou, you flatter me.”

“Hahaha, alright. Since you’re all here, hurry up and go in.”Mr. Zhou waved his hand and said.

With that, everyone walked into the meeting room.

There were a total of eighteen people in the meeting room. Thirteen of them were the Realm Masters of the Mystic Realm.

Qin Yu deliberately sat next to Yan Jinyao and said with a smile, “It’s not yours. Even if you snatch it, it’s not yours.”

Yan Jinyao knew that he couldn’t win against Qin Yu, so he turned his face to the side.

“Mr. Qin, Mr. Yan has stopped talking. Please stop talking.”At this time, a middle-aged man sitting next to him said with a smile.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “Who are you?”

“I am Bai Tianhe, the Master of the mysterious realm of Heavenly River.”The middle-aged man cupped his hands and said.

“Mysterious realm of Heavenly River?”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and then sneered, “I remember now. When I became a martial saint, your people once attacked me and injured my best friend.”

“I was just looking for you. I didn’t expect you to jump out.”

Bai Tianhe’s expression changed drastically when he heard this.

He hurriedly said, “Mr. Qin, I didn’t know. This... this must be a misunderstanding!”

“You mean I’m Lying?”Qin Yu said with a dark expression.

Bai Tianhe waved his hand desperately and said, “Mr. Qin, this is definitely a misunderstanding! Even if it’s true, it’s definitely not under my command!”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “That has nothing to do with me. As long as you attack me, you will die! Your entire mysterious realm will bear the consequences.”

Bai Tianhe’s expression was extremely ugly. He wanted to stop the fight, but unexpectedly, he got into trouble.
