2534 The Guardian’s Setup?

In an instant, his body became like a bomb and he wanted to self-destruct at that moment. However, a vine slashed over.

His body was directly split into two by Elder Guai. His soul was directly blasted into powder the instant it rushed into the air.

“Why did you ambush Xie Yue?”

Someone from Ethereal Peak shouted. He instantly took out his magical artifact and aimed it at Elder Guai.

Everything happened too fast, and many people were still at a loss.

“The core of his soul has been controlled by the heavenly monster race. There’s no way to save him. If I didn’t kill him just now, he would have directly self-destructed.”

The peak master Zhan Pu’s expression was hideous. He certainly knew how terrifying this rare monster rare living being was, but he did not expect the legendary heavenly monster race would appear among them.

“Oh no, Zhan Pu is the second batch of people to learn the Brilliance of Stars and Moon Technique. He has basically learned the complete version of the cultivation method. I wonder if this technique will fall into the hands of the monster race.”

The peak master stomped his foot with frustration. He did not notice a monster race hiding right under his nose. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

If this cultivation method leaked, it would probably cause tremendous terrifying consequences for the human race.

“Why do I feel the alien race seemed to have a foresight ability? Xie Yue probably had been possessed by the heavenly monster a long time ago. Could it be that the alien race had already discovered it when Brilliance of Stars and Moon was taught to the first batch? Otherwise, they wouldn’t have sent out a few of this rare heavenly monster race to stir up trouble.”

Qin Yu frowned. A pair of eyes seemed to be staring at him in the sky. This feeling made him feel tremendously uneasy.

If there were still powerful experts in the monster race, and they casually encircled and ambushed them, the cultivators in this battle would be in danger.

“We’ll cultivate near the Solitary Cloud City for the time being. If there’s a small team that wants to fight, stay nearby, don’t be too far away.”

Qin Yu said with a frown. Before finding a solution, they could only do this.

After settling this matter, Qin Yu felt a lingering fear after coming back to his senses.

If they did not find this nail, who knew what would happen in times to come?

He activated the Brilliance of Stars and Moon again to check the nebula map.

This time, after he carefully checked, and did not find any stars that were as dim as Xie Yue’s, he let out a sigh of relief.

However, he still found some spots that were not bright.

Just as he was about to probe again, a feeling of feeling the world spinning suddenly surged.

Qin Yu’s vision went black, and his body almost fell to the ground.

At this moment, his soul power had been completely exhausted. Investigating the nebula map had actually consumed so much soul power!

Qin Yu shook his head. It was no longer realistic to continue investigating.

He could only wait for his soul power to recover. However, these stars were only a little dimmer.

It was not like what happened to Xie Yue, so Qin Yu felt slightly relieved after comparing them.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground. He carefully read the cultivation method his father left him. There was no record related to the nebula map, which made him a little depressed.

He had a speculation now. Perhaps the brightness and darkness of these stars represent the person’s degree of recognition of this cultivation method.

The more they recognized the Unity of Will of the Brilliance of Stars and Moon, the deeper they could overlap with the spirit of the crowd, and the more terrifying the combined attack power would be.

And for those who did not recognize it, it would display an abnormal color.

Qin Yu felt it highly probable, but that was his speculation. He would need to further contemplate the specific details.

“Dad, you should at least leave a detailed explanation of such a heaven-defying cultivation method!”

Qin Yu suddenly had an idea, and his body moved to the vicinity of the peak master.

“Peak M, I have something to ask you.”

Qin Yu explained the nebula map matter to the peak master, but the peak master was at a loss.

He could be considered to have fully cultivated this cultivation method and sensed the power of the stars, but the path of the nebula that Qin Yu mentioned did not appear.

“Xiaobai, come over here!”

Zhan Pu shouted, and Xiaobai’s body trembled, thinking he had done something wrong again.

After some interaction, Qin Yu realized that Xiao Bai did not experience the same thing as him.

Xiaobai was one of the earliest batch to learn the Brilliance of Stars and Moon. However, he had known Qin Yu for a long time, Qin Yu had also taught him the complete cultivation method, so his understanding of the Star and Moon Consonance was quite good.

“Perhaps it involves the power of the bloodline. You had told me before that your father, the Guardian, had left behind the cultivation method. Perhaps it requires the bloodline of your Qin family to activate the most complete power of the cultivation method.”

The peak master speculated and said.

Qin Yu was suddenly startled. The peak master’s words had triggered some memories, and an idea instantly surfaced in his sea of consciousness.

“Many thanks! Peak Master!”

He suddenly returned to where he was when he was in retreat and carefully pondered over the peak master’s words.

Perhaps what the peak master said made sense. His desolate divine eye was an eyeball he obtained by chance on Erath. However, he had fused it with his bloodline and evolved it to the second-level desolate divine eye.

Furthermore, this desolate divine eye was tremendously abnormal. It could also dissect the origin.

It allowed Qin Yu to grasp the power of rules in a short time, and it was also the key to allowing Qin Yu to embark on the path of anomaly.

“Could it be that the items left behind by father are also under surveillance? That’s why he dared not leave any more detailed explanations. In that case, what kind of existence can monitor Guardian?”

Qin Yu’s face was full of shock.

Father, was this the method you left behind?

What did you want to tell me, or did you want to leave something for me to fight against this world?

“Lord Immortal Emperor Yao, Grandpa Yao, are you awake?”

Qin Yu took out the Coffin of Nine Lifetimes and gently knocked on the coffin lid.

Now that he was here, he wanted to find all the ways to increase his strength.

The source of the poison was one of them, and so was the Brilliance of Stars and Moon.

But now, if he wanted to find the source of the poison, he would need the help of Juan Liu of the Heart of the Ocean, and the prerequisite was to kill the Chief of Flame.

However, he seemed to be under surveillance so he could only see what Immortal Emperor Yao had to do.

Otherwise, he would be blocked by both methods.

“Brat, what do you want now?”

Immortal Emperor Yao kicked the coffin lid away and asked with an unfriendly expression as if he was tremendously impatient from being woken up.

“Well, it’s just a question. Don’t be agitated. Are you hungry? Do you want me to get someone to prepare food for you?”

Qin Yu quickly adopted a more accommodating attitude and flashed a friendly smile.

“If you have something to say, just say it. I’ve given you important information twice in a row. It’s enough for me to stay here and recuperate.”

Immortal Emperor Yao looked slightly furious. Killing intent surged within his shriveled skin.

“F*ck, Lord Immortal Emperor, don’t be so agitated. I’m just asking if you have a way to avoid being monitored. After I came to purgatory, I seemed to have been targeted by the alien race, but I don’t know what method they used.”

Qin Yu hurriedly said.
