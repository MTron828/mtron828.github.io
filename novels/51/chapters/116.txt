The two of them sneered and didn’t take Qin Yu seriously at all.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I gave you a chance. If you want to take revenge for Shen Tian, I’ll wait for you at any time.”

After saying that, Qin Yu turned around and left.

“Stop!” At this time, Wei Ming shouted out loud.

He looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “You came to provoke me and then want to leave just like that?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Then what else do you want?”

Wei Ming snorted coldly and said, “Stop masquerading as a hero when you’re just hiding behind a woman. I want to know how capable you are!”

As soon as he said that, Qin Yu felt a strong sense of internal qi pressing toward him!

In an instant, Qin Yu felt as if two mountains were pressing down on his shoulders!

Wei Ming looked at Qin Yu and sneered. The internal qi of his body became stronger and stronger. He wanted to show Qin Yu his might.

Qin Yu, who was standing in front of him, frowned slightly.

At this moment, his body suddenly shook slightly, and a terrifying force immediately rushed towards Wei Ming!

“Bang!”

Wei Ming immediately took a few steps back and almost fell to the ground!

This shocked Wei Ming immensely. All of his internal qi was easily dissolved by Qin Yu!

“What’s wrong?” Liu Shihui frowned and asked.

Wei Ming’s expression became a bit solemn, but he didn’t say anything for a long time.

“If you want to find trouble, I’ll wait for you,” Qin Yu looked at Wei Ming and said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Yao Qing, who was watching from the side, was terrified.

He followed behind Qin Yu with his forehead dripping with cold sweat.

After walking a distance away, Yao Qing wiped his sweat and said, “Mr. Qin, Liu Shihui alone is hard enough to deal with. Why do you still want to provoke Wei Ming...”

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks.

He turned around and looked at Yao Qing. He shook his head and said, “I don’t know why, but when I face these two people, I feel that they’re no threat.”

This feeling was very strange. As Inner Strength Master Hands, they were supposed to be stronger than Qin Yu.

But when Qin Yu stood in front of these two people, he felt that he could easily crush them to death.

A short distance away, Wei Ming’s expression was extremely unsightly.

He suddenly had a bad premonition inside.

“Wei Ming, what’s wrong?” Liu Shihui asked in puzzlement.

Wei Ming took a deep breath. He stared at Liu Shihui and said with a grave expression, “Young Master Liu, you have to be careful later. I’m afraid Qin Yu isn’t as simple as he seems.”

Liu Shihui was stunned for a moment before he laughed out loud.

“Wei Ming, don’t joke around. He’s only at the ninth stage of Inner Strength. He’s nothing compared to you and me! I can easily kill him!” Liu Shihui didn’t take Wei Ming’s words to heart at all.

Wei Ming wanted to say something else, but he was interrupted by Liu Shihui with a wave of his hand.

“Wei Ming, just wait and see how I will avenge you.” Liu Shihui sneered.

Wei Ming didn’t say anything more.

“Maybe it’s just an illusion,” Wei Ming comforted himself inside.

Time flew by quickly. Liu Shihui didn’t treat Qin Yu as an opponent at all, so he just sat there eating, drinking, and having fun.

Qin Yu also didn’t take Liu Shihui seriously. All his thoughts were on the Water Dragon Cave.

In this short period of time, Qin Yu circled the Water Dragon Cave several times.

“The martial arts competition is about to start. Why do you keep circling around?” Sun Ying couldn’t help but grumble.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to her. His eyes were still staring at the Water Dragon Cave.

“Whose property is this Water Dragon Cave?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Sun Ying froze, then muttered, “How would I know? Besides, are you still in the mood to ask these questions in this life and death situation? Hurry up and think of a countermeasure.”

“It seems to be the Liu family’s.” At this time, Chen Xin suddenly muttered.

“The Liu family’s?” Qin Yu looked at Chen Xin and continued, “Are you sure?”

Chen Xin held her chin and pondered for a moment. Then, she clapped her hands and said, “Yes, it’s the Liu family’s property! I’ve seen it on the news before!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu narrowed his eyes slightly.

He looked at the Water Dragon Cave and said in a low voice, “We have to think of a way to get the Water Dragon Cave from him.”

“Okay, time’s up!”

At this moment, Liu Shihui suddenly shouted from a short distance away!

With his shout, the scene also quieted down.

Almost everyone’s eyes were on Liu Shihui.

“Qin Yu, you’re dead meat.” Liu Shihui grinned and said.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and walked directly in Liu Shihui’s direction.

“Mr. Qin, be careful!” Yao Qing shouted with a worried look on his face.

The two of them soon arrived at the center of the Water Dragon Cave. In an instant, a strong light shone on the two of them.

Liu Shihui looked down on them and said coldly, “Kid, it’s not too late for you to backtrack now.”

Qin Yu grinned and said, “It’s too late for you to regret.”

Liu Shihui narrowed his eyes and sneered. “You’re the most arrogant person I’ve ever seen!”

“Young Master Liu, let’s end this quickly. I’ve even prepared a celebration banquet for you!” Someone shouted from the stands.

Liu Shihui looked in that direction and then sneered. “Qin Yu, you heard that, right? In order not to waste time, I’ve decided to end this quickly!”

After saying that, the internal qi on Liu Shihui’s body suddenly soared! In an instant, it was raised to the limit!

A terrifying qi force was pressing towards Qin Yu!

“This is the strength of an Inner Strength Master Hands!” Liu Shihui looked at Qin Yu with a smug expression, as if he wanted to see fear and terror on Qin Yu’s face.

However, Qin Yu’s expression was calm. Not only did he have no reaction, but he even wanted to laugh.

“It seems like what I predicted.” Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Inner strength and spiritual power... They are indeed not on the same level. The so-called Inner Strength Master Hands are pitifully weak.” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

“I’ll let you make the first move.” Liu Shihui beckoned Qin Yu with his finger.

“Wait.” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly said.

Liu shihui sneered. “What, are you afraid?”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I want to raise the stakes.”

“Oh really?” Liu Shihui seemed to be quite interested.

Qin Yu said, “If you win, I will return you a stalk of Chinese knotweed and give you a stalk of herbs with similar herbal properties.”

“Oh really? Are you serious?” Liu Shihui’s eyes immediately lit up.

In his opinion, Qin Yu’s backer was the Yan family! He definitely didn’t lack herbs!

If he could get one more, it would undoubtedly be a blessing for Liu Shihui!

“If I win, you will kneel down and apologize to Yao Qing, and give me a hundred-year-old herb king. Besides that, I also want something else,” Qin Yu said in a sullen voice. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Liu Shihui raised his eyebrows and said, “Say it. I won’t lose anyway.”

Qin Yu pointed at the Water Dragon Cave and said, “Give this place to me.”

Liu Shihui frowned. The Water Dragon Cave provided a lot of income for the Liu family every year. He was really unwilling to give it away just like that.

However, Liu Shihui thought about it again and couldn’t help but laugh.

“Okay.” Liu Shihui nodded. In his opinion, he wouldn’t lose at all. Qin Yu was just giving him free herbs.
