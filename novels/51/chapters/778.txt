“That’s right, isn’t that just a shabby ring? Why are you so nervous...” Luo Yang muttered in a low voice.

Luo Jingyu gritted his teeth and slapped Luo Yang’s face!

“Shabby ring? Do you know that there’s a secret hidden in that artifact? You b*stard!” Luo Jingyu said through gritted teeth.

“I spent a lot of effort to get that ring, and now, it’s stolen because of you!”

Luo Yang covered his face and said in a low voice, “Then why don’t you go and get it back? Does he, Qin Yu, dare to offend the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets?”

“If he was afraid of the Pavilion of Heavenly Secrets, he wouldn’t have slapped you, you piece of trash!” Luo Jingyu said coldly.

“Let me tell you, if you can’t find that ring, I’ll break your legs!”

At this moment, Luo Yang also realized that something was wrong.

He said in a low voice, “Dad, then... then what should we do?”

Luo Jingyu took a deep breath and said, “We can only pray that he didn’t discover the secret of that artifact.”

After saying that, Luo Jingyu fell into silence.

After a moment, Luo Jingyu sighed and said, “Calm him down first and apologize to him.”

“Take a few treasures and exchange them for the ring!”

...

At this time, Qin Yu and the man with the mustache arrived at the airport early.

The Pavilion Master also sent Qin Yu the address.

Seeing this address, Qin Yu felt that it was somewhat familiar.

“Sheng Kingdom...” Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

Qin Yu had been to this country before.

Back then, in order to treat Yang Jing’s father’s illness, Qin Yu had indeed made a trip there.

“What a coincidence.” Qin Yu thought to himself.

“I’ve already informed Xue Yuzhi. Whether or not you can obtain the power of the Martial Saint is up to you.” The Pavilion Master said in the text message.

Qin Yu picked up his phone.

He took a deep breath and said in a low voice, “No matter what, I must obtain the power of the Martial Saint!”

Qin Yu bought the latest flight and the two of them rushed to the Sheng Kingdom in the early morning.

Ten hours later.

The plane successfully arrived at the Sheng Kingdom.

After he got off the plane, Qin Yu took a deep breath and couldn’t help but feel a little emotional.

“The last time I came to the Sheng Kingdom, I had just stepped into the path of cultivation. In the blink of an eye, so much time had passed.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh.

Thinking back, it had been a long time since he had seen Yang Jing.

In the past two years, Qin Yu had almost always been cultivating and had not entered the secular world for a long time.

“I’m already here. If I have time, I’ll go visit the Yang family,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this time, the mustache pointed to a car not far away and said, “That car should be here to pick us up.”

Qin Yu looked over and saw a car with Qin Yu’s name written on it.

Therefore, the two of them immediately walked toward the car.

As soon as they approached, two people got out of the car.

They walked to the back and opened the car door. Then, they saw a woman in her twenties.

“You are Qin Yu?” The woman asked straightforwardly.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Are you Miss Xue Yuzhi?”

“Miss?” The woman couldn’t help but cover her mouth and laugh.

“According to my age, you should call me Auntie.”

“Auntie?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but scratch his head.

But on second thought, since Xue Yuzhi was a friend of the Pavilion Master, she must be around the same age.

“Hello, Auntie Xue.” Qin Yu quickly changed his words.

Xue Yuzhi smiled and said, “Get in the car.”

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time and immediately got into the car with the man with the mustache.

After getting into the car, Xue Yuzhi sized up Qin Yu and sighed, “The Pavilion Master is full of praise for you. She said that your alchemy skills aren’t inferior to hers.”

Qin Yu quickly waved his hand and said, “That’s too exaggerated. How can I be compared to the Pavilion Master?”

“Don’t be too modest. She also said that you would become the first Martial Saint in the world.” Xue Yuzhi continued.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but stick out his tongue.

The first Martial Saint?

Qin Yu had heard these words one after another in the past two days.

“Oh right, do you know how to refine the concentric pill?” At this moment, Xue Yuzhi suddenly asked.

Qin Yu said, “It shouldn’t be a problem. Auntie Xue, May I ask, what is the effect of this concentric pill?”

A trace of doubt flashed across Xue Yuzhi’s face.

Qin Yu explained, “Because I came in a hurry, I didn’t make any preparations, but don’t worry. Since I’m here, I’ll definitely give you a satisfactory result.”

Seeing this, Xue Yuzhi nodded and said, “My father was poisoned a few years ago. This poison is extremely strange. It’s said that only the concentric pill can cure it.”

“Over the years, we have tried many methods, but all of them failed. So, we put all our hopes on the concentric pill.”

“Detoxification...” Qin Yu nodded silently.

Normally, detoxification shouldn’t be difficult. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

But with the Xue family’s ability, they must have tried ordinary pills.

Since it didn’t work, it was enough to show that this kind of poison wasn’t simple.

“How is it? Is it okay?” Xue Yuzhi asked.

Qin Yu quickly nodded and said, “No problem.”

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly thought of the Martial Saint’s power.

Thus, Qin Yu said, “Aunt Xue, may I ask, I heard that your family has the power of the Martial Saint. Is that true?”

Xue Yuzhi didn’t avoid this question.

She smiled and said, “That’s right. It is precisely because we have the power of a Martial Saint that our Xue family has been able to stand firm in the country.”

“Otherwise, I am afraid we would have been crushed long ago.”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “From what you said... The Sheng Kingdom is very dangerous?”

“Yes.” Xue Yuzhi nodded.

“The Sheng Kingdom isn’t very big and its government isn’t effective. That is why many organizations have been stationed here.” Xue Yuzhi explained.

Qin Yu was a little puzzled and asked, “Since it is so dangerous, why did you all come to the Sheng Kingdom? Why did you not stay in Pyro?”

Xue Yuzhi’s expression changed slightly and she said in a deep voice, “We have enemies and we had no choice but to come to the Sheng Kingdom. Otherwise, who would be willing to leave their home country?”

“In any case, don’t ask about things that you shouldn’t ask.”

Seeing that Xue Yuzhi’s tone wasn’t friendly, Qin Yu didn’t continue to ask.

The car sped along and soon arrived at the Xue family’s home.

Just like the Yang family, the Xue family also owned a manor, and this manor was even more magnificent than the Yang family’s.

The entire border was built with city walls, almost like a small city.

After arriving at the Xue family’s home, Xue Yuzhi asked someone to arrange a room for Qin Yu.

“You can stay here temporarily. I’ll inform you when I look for you,” Xue Yuzhi said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Aunt Xue, there’s no time to lose. I hope you can hurry up.”

For Qin Yu, time was of the essence.

Just as Yan Sihai said, for every minute Qin Yu delayed, Yan Ruoxue would suffer more.
