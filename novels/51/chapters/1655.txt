Chapter 1656: Chapter 1,656: Destroy the anomaly! 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The elementalist’s anomaly waved its huge palm and slammed it fiercely towards Qin Yu. Like a black moon, it fell from the sky!

Qin Yu danced wildly as he raised his head and roared furiously. The Qi and blood in his body exploded to the extreme. The golden radiance was extremely resplendent, forming a sharp contrast with the palm of the Elementalist’s anomaly!

What kind of collision was this? Billions of rays of light shook the heavens and earth. They were incomparably dazzling, making it impossible for anyone to open their eyes!

At this moment, the heavens and earth were crumbling. Everything in the square garden had turned into dust. The Ying Ning Mountain that had stood tall for so many years had been reduced to flat ground!

A shocking thing happened. Qin Yu’s Golden Fist actually directly penetrated the palm of the vision and then headed straight for the Elementalist!

Everyone gasped!

Qin Yu’s fist actually pierced through the Elementalist’s vision!

What kind of physical body was this? What kind of power was this? It was too terrifying!

The elementalist snorted and shouted, “I’ve really underestimated you!”

After saying that, the elementalist who was sitting on the ground suddenly stood up. It was as if he had become one with the vision. He controlled the huge vision and engaged in a life-and-death battle with Qin Yu’s physical body!

They were like a collision between a god and a devil master. The tall figure and the golden radiance collided non-stop at this moment. Every strike caused the world to tremble!

Xiao Sheng was rather surprised. He looked at Qin Yu’s physical body and exclaimed, “Virtual entity physical body?”

Endless killing intent was spreading on the battlefield. Many people were retreating, afraid of suffering from this terrifying impact.

“Boom!”

After a violent collision, everything became calm.

Qin Yu and the elementalist stood in a corner of the world, staring at each other coldly.

The world returned to its calm state. The only one affected was Ying Ning Mountain.

Qin Yu and the Elementalist did not move. They seemed to be staring at each other, more like they were testing each other’s true strength.

“Such a terrifying physical body is truly shocking.”

After a long while, the elementalist spoke.

His voice was like thunder, shaking the entire area.

That huge anomaly appeared behind him, looking down at everyone coldly.

“This is only the beginning. Elementalist, I will definitely kill you today!”Qin Yu did not waste any words. He clenched his fist and charged over!

The elementalist shouted, “Then let’s Fight!”

The second round of the battle began, and it was still a clash between the visions and the physical body!

Qin Yu’s physical body, which had stepped into the reversion void stage, was extremely terrifying. Even when facing the visions of the elementalists, he was not afraid at all. In fact, he was even able to suppress them by one head!

The collision between them shattered the sand and rocks into dust. The mountains and lands were instantly filled with devastation!

The more Qin Yu fought, the braver he became. His aura became more vigorous, and at one point, the visions of the elementalists were continuously shaken back!

“Ah! !”

At this moment, Qin Yu let out a furious roar. His right fist turned into a pure golden color!

It was the ten thousand spell breaking punch! Qin Yu’s strongest physical body erupted!

The elementalist also let out a series of furious roars. The black internal Qi gathered towards his fist as if he was about to engage in the final clash!

Everyone held their breaths and stared at the battlefield. They were afraid that they would miss this battle in the blink of an eye.

Xiao Sheng stood up as well. He raised his palm and transformed it into a huge green leaf, protecting everyone beneath it.

At this moment, everyone realized that something was amiss!

They were not fist-bumping at all. Instead, they were smashing at each other’s bodies!

Neither the Elementalist nor Qin Yu dodged. They gave up on their defense and planned to give each other the heaviest blow!

“Is... is this a life-and-death struggle? !”

Someone exclaimed and could not help but widen his eyes!

“That Black Shadow is merely an elementalist’s anomaly, but Qin Yu’s body is real!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Such a collision is simply unfair. What is Qin Yu Thinking? !”

“It’s his confidence in his body.”

At this moment, Xiao Sheng spoke.

He placed his hands behind his back and stared at the battlefield. He said indifferently, “A chaotic body at the reversion void stage is far more powerful than I imagined.”

Before he finished his words, the scene had already let out a huge roar!

Qin Yu’s fist directly pierced through the head of the abnormal phenomenon, and the palm of the abnormal phenomenon also fiercely slammed onto Qin Yu’s body!

“Boom!”

Under the Golden Fist, the abnormal phenomenon was directly smashed into pieces and dissipated into the world!

Under the huge impact of the abnormal phenomenon, Qin Yu also shot backward and directly smashed into the ground!

A huge hole appeared in the ground, raising a hundred thousand feet of dust!

“Qin Yu!”

Someone exclaimed and couldn’t help but look in the direction of the huge hole.

At this moment, the Elementalist’s expression was frighteningly cold.

His vision was actually destroyed by a punch from a young junior!

This was something that had never happened before. How could an elementalist who was extremely well-written not be shocked and angry!

“Whoosh!”

At this moment, Qin Yu burst out from the huge hole.

His clothes had been torn to shreds, but his body was not damaged at all. The Golden Radiance was still dazzling!

He was unharmed!

The Elementalist’s vision did not harm Qin Yu at all!

“Qin Yu... is fine!”

“It’s Qin Yu who won. That vision has been destroyed!”

“It’s not that simple. The northern Lord’s methods are endless. This is just the beginning.”

Regardless, Qin Yu had indeed won this clash!

The Elementalist’s eyes emitted a substantial radiance. It was extremely terrifying.

He looked coldly at Qin Yu. The displeasure on his face was obvious.

“I admit that I have underestimated you,”the elementalist said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Even if you conjure a phenomenon, you still won’t be able to fight against my physical body.”

“That’s right.”The elementalist nodded in a rare manner. “I really want to see how powerful your physical body is. Now, it seems that it has far exceeded my expectations.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “Then use your true spell. Don’t let the world laugh at you, the Master of the northern lands.”

“Alright.”

The Elementalist’s words were concise, but they were extremely cold.

Everyone present was shocked. Was this battle that was about to destroy the world just a test? !

Just how powerful were these two people? !

He Teng, Yong Ji, and the others had ugly expressions on their faces.

Qin Yu’s strength was ridiculous.

What made them even more desperate was that with Qin Yu’s talent, they would never be able to catch up to him!

Everything quieted down. The aura of the Elementalist’s internal Qi began to calm down.

At this moment, it was like the calm before a storm.

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the top of the Elementalist’s head emitted a holy radiance!

This radiance formed a mysterious scene. In this scene, there were divine beasts galloping and immortal qi enshrouding.

It was the four symbols technique!

See so for myself, the four symbols technique that Qin Yu had just witnessed!

“How brilliant can you be when you use the same technique?”Qin Yu said coldly.

However, before he could finish his words, all the divine beasts in the scene had turned into fresh blood and exploded like a bloody mist!

Then, a human figure appeared in the scene!
