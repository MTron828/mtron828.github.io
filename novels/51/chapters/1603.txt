Chapter 1604: Chapter 1,604, the full-scale attack of the northern lands Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The three of them had a clear division of labor. Rui Yi did not want to do this, but she knew that it was impossible for her to control the three of them. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Besides, this was their territory, so she could only let them be.

Soon, Baro and Feng Hai left the green rock sect, leaving only Yong Ji and Rui Yi standing there.

His expression was dark, and no one knew what he was thinking.

“What’s the matter? Are You Afraid?”Rui Yi walked over and asked calmly.

Yong Ji glanced at her coldly and said, “Why would I be afraid of a Junior? If I wanted to kill him, he would have died a long time ago!”

“That was before. It’s a pity that you weren’t decisive enough,”Rui Yi mocked him mercilessly.

Yong Ji remained silent. The reason why he did not attack Qin Yu was firstly because he felt that Qin Yu had some trump card. Secondly, it was because he was cautious.

Now that he was mocked by Baro and the others, he could only take the opportunity to destroy Qin Yu’s prestige.

...

On the Wind Bamboo Mountain, Qin Yu was about to leave.

He looked at Qu Zhu and said, “I have already waited for a few days. If I continue to wait like this, it would be a waste of time.”

Qu Zhu said in surprise, “What Plan do you have?”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “Currently, going into seclusion is not a good decision. But for the sake of the future, I can only make this choice.”

“That’s right.”Qu Zhu nodded.

“In the South Province, someone has to stand up.”

Qin Yu sighed in his heart. He was somewhat confused.

The sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect was so powerful, but why didn’t he have the slightest intention of making a move?

Even when his own younger brother was beheaded, he still made the slightest movement.

After this action, no one dared to place their bets on him.

Qin Yu looked at Qu Zhu and said, “Big Brother Qu Zhu, I’m afraid the southern region still has to rely on you.”

Although Qu Zhu was unwilling, he didn’t have any other choice in the current situation.

That day, Qin Yu left the wind bamboo mountain and headed straight for the Medicine Sage’s capital.

The Medicine Sage had hidden so many herbs that it would be a waste to leave them alone. Qin Yu decided to rob all of them and put them into his own pocket.

No one in the Medicine Sage’s capital dared to stop Qin Yu. They could only watch helplessly as the herbs fell into Qin Yu’s spatial magic artifact.

After the Medicine Sage City left, Qin Yu headed straight for the great Yue mountain.

This was Wen Wanyi’s former residence. The location was excellent, and it was now deserted. It was extremely secluded.

The Great Yue Mountain was once the former residence of a great cultivator at the tribulation stage. Although the remnants of the internal Qi had been exhausted by time, one could still feel the remnants of the internal Qi after tasting it carefully.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the peak of the mountain and sighed in a low voice, “If I’m not wrong, I’m afraid I still need dark energy to break through this time.”

However, Qin Yu had no other choice at the moment. He could only take it step by step.

He stretched out a strand of divine sense and inserted it into the spatial magic artifact.

This spatial magic artifact contained ye Nan’s precious collection. The herbs in it could be said to be top-notch. There were even several pieces of enlightenment tea.

“This dog. I don’t know where it got so many Babe.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse inwardly.

A strand of Qin Yu’s divine sense walked within this pitch-black spatial magic artifact. He casually picked up a magical artifact and looked at it.

This was an incomplete magical artifact. It was engraved with dense and strange talismans. Qin Yu took it out and tried to revive this magical artifact, but unfortunately, this magical artifact didn’t have any reaction.

“It seems that these magical artifacts are already useless,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Although these magical artifacts could not be used again, their materials could be said to be top-notch.

For example, the magical artifact in Qin Yu’s hand could sense the internal Qi of the ancient black iron.

“If I have the chance, I can find a master craftsman to melt all these magical artifacts. Maybe I can create a magical artifact,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He put the magical artifact back, took out the herbs, and began his seclusion.

Not long after Qin Yu entered seclusion, a large number of cultivators from the northern lands, under the instructions of the three godly monarchs, poured into the South Province.

They set up a magic array in the South Province and absorbed the spiritual power and divine sense of countless ordinary cultivators.

This method had something in common with the heavenly blood rainbow from before.

The South Province, Eternal City.

Ever since Eternal City had left, this city hadn’t been lonely. There were still many cultivators who poured into it and lived like kings.

On this day, several black-robed men descended here.

“Let’s start from here,”a black-robed man said coldly.

The others immediately shot into the sky. They held a scroll in their hands, and with a wave of the scroll, black mist instantly enveloped the entire eternal city!

“What happened? Why did the sky suddenly turn dark?”

“It’s going to rain. Hurry up and go home!”

“No, who are those black-robed men?”

Before they could figure out the situation, the bodies of the people around them began to twist rapidly!

Their bodies were constantly being squeezed. As their blood could not withstand the pressure, it directly exploded!

Rays of light floated out from their bodies, and these rays of light were actually absorbed by the painting scroll!

The sudden change of events immediately caused everyone’s expressions to change greatly!

“What... What’s going on!”

“It’s the people of the northern lands, quickly... Run!”

“Help... Help!”

The entire Yongji city instantly fell into chaos! They desperately tried to escape to their homes.

However, the people around them exploded one by one. Spiritual power and their physical bodies were all sucked into the scroll!

In just half an hour, the originally prosperous eternal limit city had turned into a river of blood and turned into a ghost city.

“Alright, let’s go to the next city,”the black-robed man said coldly as he put away the scroll.

In the next few days.

Many cities in the South Province had been attacked. A large number of cultivators had died in their hands!

It wasn’t just ordinary cultivators. Some large-scale sects had also fallen because of this.

Gu City.

These black-robed men suddenly descended from the sky.

Their figures were like the Grim Reaper, making people feel extremely terrified.

“It’s... It’s the people of the northern lands!”Someone was the first to discover them!

“It’s finally... it’s finally our turn...”

Some people who had thought things through sat there without moving. Their eyes were slightly closed, as if they were waiting for death to descend.

There were also people who had a strong desire to live, desperately fleeing and shouting.

However, all of this was nothing out of the ordinary in the eyes of the northern land cultivators.

In their eyes, these life forms were even inferior to ants. They were only nourishment for their cultivation and to support the northern land lord.

“Why have you all suddenly come to my Gu City?”

At this moment, the city lord of Gu City walked over and stood in front of these people.

These black-robed men looked at the city lord coldly and said, “You don’t have the right to talk to us.”

The city Lord’s expression changed and he said coldly, “My gu city will not allow you to be impudent!”

“That will depend on whether you have the ability!”

A black-robed man quickly attacked and headed straight for the city Lord’s glabella!

At this moment, a treasured sword shot over. A cold light flashed and the black-robed man’s arm was instantly cut off.
