2261 Plundering

The expressions of the few people in the hall changed drastically. They did not expect Qin Yu to attack just like that.

“Eighth Elder, you!”

One of them was furious.

“Now that the sect master is dead and a dozen of the sect’s most powerful elders have died, what can we do by holding on?”

The eighth elder laughed and said.

Upon hearing this, the rest had ugly expressions on their faces. What the eighth elder said did make sense.

In this strength-dominated chaotic galaxy, when one was not powerful enough, a pack of wolves would immediately target the person for any potential gains.

Seeing the four kneel before him, Qin Yu left a restriction in their divine sense.

“Alright, from now on, Piao Ruoyun will be your new sect master.”

“What? What is this little girl capable of?”

An elder’s expression changed.

“Shut up! Did I let you speak?”

Qin Yu slapped him. Instantly, no one in the hall dared to speak.

“Then will you stay here?”

A person asked nervously.

“I won’t stay here for long, but I’ll leave you with enough confidence before I leave.”

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“From today onwards, all forces distant from the Azure Ridge Continent or its vicinity shall be recalled and withdrawn back to our sect. The current Azure Firmament Sect can no longer hold on to the interests in remote areas.”

Qin Yu said in a deep voice. There were a few remote resource areas he had already memorized the locations. He could ask for them on the way.

“Qin Yu, it’s really you.”

Even though she had already received all the news, she still found it unbelievable.

Qin Yu transmitted his voice to Piao Ruoyun.

“Alright, I’ll take you to the treasure vault of Azure Firmament Sect. It’s the accumulation of Azure Firmament Sect over the years.”

Piao Ruoyun was intelligent, so she directly brought Qin Yu to the treasure vault of the Azure Firmament Sect.

Qin Yu effortlessly broke the restriction at the door, and the two entered the treasure vault.

There was a fluctuation of spiritual energy that emitted all kinds of treasures. There were also many demon cores. Although their grades were not high, there were a lot of them.

Qin Yu waved his hand and took two-thirds of the demon cores and treasures into her Sumeru ring, leaving about one-third of them behind.

“As long as Azure Firmament Sect can survive, these things will continue accumulating.”

Piao Ruoyun was full of joy. She had initially thought Qin Yu would only need to leave behind a little bit, and she never expected him to have left a third of it.

“Is there a quieter place here for cultivation?”

Qin Yu asked.

“Yes, there is. The Azure Firmament Sect itself specializes in cultivating the Way of Soul. Within the sect, there is a Mystic Realm dedicated to soul cultivation. My True Saint’s rules and Water Mirror Space were comprehended there, and so was the sect master’s comprehension of the Way of Soul.

Piao Ruoyun thought for a moment and said to Qin Yu.

“Take me there and bring the four great elders of Azure Firmament Sect along.”

Qin Yu nodded. Piao Ruoyun’s Water Mirror Space left a deep impression on Qin Yu. Without her Water Mirror Space that blocked the demon ape on the seventh level, he might not have been able to obtain so much bone cultivation water.

He could also try it if it was a Mystic Realm specializing in comprehending the soul. He might be able to comprehend something. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A few of them arrived at the Mystic Realm and entered the holy land of the Azure Firmament Sect.

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground, and the Soul Torment Mind Technique suddenly surged into motion.

A ghostly aura immediately spread throughout the entire space. One after another, inner cores floated in the air, and in an instant, the Soul Torment Mind Technique refined them into pure divine sense and spiritual power.

Several beams of divine sense’s power enveloped a few of them, and instantly, the five were overjoyed.

It was an incomparably pure power of divine sense. As long as it was absorbed into one’s divine sense, one’s cultivation of divine sense could steadily improve.

The power of divine sense alone could only be accumulated and slowly increased over the years. Even if one obtained the inner core of a demonic beast, one would need to refine all the souls for a long time before one could absorb it. They did not expect Qin Yu to be able to refine such pure power of divine sense directly.

The dissatisfaction of the few elders toward Qin Yu vanished into thin air. They all sat cross-legged on the ground and absorbed the power of divine sense.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. He realized his divine sense seemed to have reached a barrier.

With a thought, he distributed most of the refined power of divine sense into the Sumeru ring and Piao Ruoyun.

Elder Guai and the others in the Sumeru ring also began to cultivate.

…

In the Mysterious Dark Sect, Shui Yuan and a group of people were in the sect.

At this moment, almost everyone’s expression was solemn. No one in the entire Great Hall uttered a sound.

This time, only Shui Yuan and Nangong Qi had escaped risking their lives from the fire unicorn land. Both were heavily injured and needed a long time to recover their strength.

“I heard that Qin Yu has gone to Azure Firmament Sect. I think he will come to our Mysterious Dark Sect soon.”

Nangong Qi’s voice trembled. He had not expected a third-grade True Saint to be so terrifying that he killed Ming Yue, an eighth-grade Tue Saint. If Shui Yuan had not cultivated the Way of the Physical Body, he would have also died in the fire unicorn land.

That was nearly a hundred powerful cultivators, and he fought them single-handedly. If news of this spread, it would undoubtedly leave countless people astonished and in awe.

“What should we do? Perhaps we should look for a remote place? Otherwise, who among us can handle him if he comes looking for us?”

An elderly man said in a panic.

“Why are you panicking? I’m not dead yet!”

Shui Yuan coldly rebuked.

“Sigh.”

After a long time, he sighed as if he had aged a lot.

“Send a voice transmission to the sect master of the Blood Sect. Get him to help our Mysterious Dark Sect. Let him set the conditions.”

It was in the Si family’s residence in the Holy Region.

The strength of a third grade killed an eighth grade?

Si Liuhe asked with a frown.

Si Wujue nodded.

“There’s something. However, True Saints can only comprehend incomplete ways in remote galaxies. Moreover, I heard this kid has obtained a peak tribulation divine artifact. Understandably, he could kill an eighth-grade cultivator.”

Si Liuhe shook his head.

“It’s just a worldly possession, after all. There’s no need to worry. Shiyue’s comprehension of the power of the five elements is the most important thing for the family right now. Once he succeeds, we can start arranging his marriage. Our Si family must be one step ahead this time.”

Si Wujue said coldly,

At this moment, Qin Yu’s body was floating in the air of the Mystic Realm.

The surrounding clouds rolled and surged, and strange phenomena appeared one after another within the cloud.

“Soul Shattering Golden Radiance!”

Qin Yu was shocked. At that time, Piao Ruoyun had desperately used her deadly technique.
