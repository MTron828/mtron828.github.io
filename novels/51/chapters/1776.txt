1777 Can You Guys Do It?

Looking at Qin Yu who fell and no longer could get up, the peak master could not help but shake his head.

“It has been so many years that no one has joined Demon-slaying Peak. I didn’t expect to see such a character today,” the peak master sighed and said.

The surrounding crowd also couldn’t help but sneer.

In the eyes of these Devil Hunters, it was too embarrassing to fail to pass through this formation.

The peak master took a step forward and wanted to retract the formation.

However, at this moment, Xiao Sheng took a step forward and stood in front of the peak master.

“Xiao Sheng, what are you doing?” the peak master frowned and said.

“Peak Master, please give him another chance,” said Xiao Sheng in a deep voice.

“Give him another chance?” The peak Master couldn’t help but sneer.

He pointed in Qin Yu’s direction and said, ” “He’s unconscious now. How do I give him a chance? Is he going to do it again? Do you want him to die?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Then give him a little more time,” Xiao Sheng said coldly.

“Xiao Sheng, I don’t know what’s your relationship with him. Please be rational,” the peak master said with a cold expression.

“If he can pass through this formation, it means he passes the test. If he can’t, no point for me to giving him more time.”

Xiao Sheng stubbornly stood in front of the peak Master, showing no intention of giving way.

“Get out of my way,” the peak master frowned and said.

“Please give him a little more time, Peak Master. Ten minutes will do,” Xiao Sheng said coldly.

“If he doesn’t get up after ten minutes, then do as you wish.”

When the peak master opened his mouth and was about to speak, Xiao Sheng continued, “Since the dean has agreed to let him join Thunder Courtyard, he must have his reasons.”

Hearing this, the peak master instantly fell silent.

In Thunder Courtyard, Dean Lei was the faith of everyone.

He was above the entire Thunder Courtyard and even the entire Lizhou. He was truly a top-notch figure out of this world.

“Alright.” After much thought, the peak master finally agreed.

“But I’ll only give you ten minutes.”

“Many thanks,” Xiao Sheng cupped his hands and said.

Xiao Sheng then retreated to the side and looked in Qin Yu’s direction.

“What do we do now?” Jue Wu asked softly.

Xiao Sheng looked in Qin Yu’s direction and said, “Believe him. He’s like my younger brother. They’re both people who can create miracles.”

Jue Wu wasn’t as calm as Xiao Sheng. She looked in Qin Yu’s direction and kept stomping her feet.

Time passed by. In the blink of an eye, five minutes had passed.

Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, still did not reaction.

“Xiao Sheng, don’t keep insisting,” a Devil Hunter shouted not far away.

“Xiao Sheng, this doesn’t seem like your character at all. You’re actually pleading with the peak master for this brat?”

Xiao Sheng didn’t say anything. He closed his eyes slightly and waited quietly.

Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, seemed to have fallen into darkness.

it was pitch black in front of his eyes, and countless scenes kept appearing in front of him.

From Jiangcheng in the beginning to Jingdu, and then to the Holy Region.

Scene after scene of what he experienced with his many companions, and the short and happy moments he had with Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu was watching the scenes one after another as if he was in a God’s perspective.

“Qin Yu, we’ll go to the Holy Region together to vindicate our dao!”

“Qin Yu, you must live on.”

“Qin Yu, I believe you can do it. You are the hero in my heart.”

“I’m waiting for you in Zhongzhou. You can definitely do it.”

The countless images mixing with the sounds of the past were as if calling out to him.

In the darkness, there was suddenly a little light.

“I can definitely do it…” Qin Yu murmured in the dark.

His eye expression became determined again!

And those rays of light also became brighter!

“There’s only one minute left. I don’t think there’s a need to wait,” the peak master looked at Xiao Sheng and said quietly.

Xiao Sheng glanced at the peak master and said, “No one can judge the outcome before the time is up.”

The peak master snorted lightly as if he was annoyed.

“Alright, I won’t wait any longer!” Finally, the peak master couldn’t take it anymore.

He raised his hand and wanted to shut down the formation!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu, who was lying on the ground, stood up with difficulty!

Countless rays of light poured on his body, pressing down on his weak body until he could barely stand up!

No one could withstand such intense pain and terrifying pressure!

However, at this moment, Qin Yu actually stood up!

There was a faint golden glow on his body as if the sun was bathing him.

His tanned skin seemed to be full of strength!

“I… definitely can… do it!”

With a furious roar, Qin Yu stood up again!

The intense pain almost made Qin Yu breathless, but Qin Yu endured the pain and walked out of the formation step by step!

Everyone was stunned.

This kid actually stood up?

“That’s great! Qin Yu, you’re the best!” Jue Wu clapped her hands in excitement!

Even Xiao Sheng could not help but smile.

“People like you do have incredible power,” Xiao Sheng said in a low voice.

In the formation, Qin Yu’s body burst out with an extremely terrifying power!

He bore the two-fold pain and walked out of the formation step by step!

“Yay! Qin Yu did it!” Jue Wu was overjoyed and quickly ran to Qin Yu’s side to support him

At this moment, Qin Yu was nearly exhausted. However, he still stood there stubbornly.

His thin face was filled with determination and courage!

“He’s the first person to stand up again,” the peak master was shocked and said. “His spirit is indeed worthy of admiration.”

Speaking up to this point, the peak master’s tone suddenly changed as he shook his head, “Unfortunately, he’s too weak. If he passes through the formation with such difficulty, it’ll be difficult for him to participate in Devil Hunter’s moves in the future. He’s too weak.”

“Weak? He’s indeed not weak.”

At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded in the peak master’s ears.

He turned around and realized it was Dean Lei!

The peak master was shocked. He then quickly cupped his hands and greeted, “Dean Lei.”

The rest of the people also quickly bowed and greeted him loudly, “Dean Lei!”

With his hands behind his back, Dean Lei said calmly, “Qin Yu’s primordial spirit was severely damaged, but he still managed to pass through the formation. All of you here, who can do it? ”

Everyone was shocked by his words!

“What? This kid’s primordial spirit is damaged?”

“Isn’t he unable to move when his primordial spirit is damaged? But he… he actually passed through the formation under such circumstances?”

“It’s too… too abnormal…”

The peak master couldn’t help but be shocked.

“He passed through the formation with his primordial spirit damaged. This… How did he do it…” the peak master murmured in a low voice. He was extremely shocked!

“Dean, you must be joking! How could one pass through the formation with his primordial spirit damaged?” Someone asked doubtfully.
