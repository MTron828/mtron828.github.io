Si Liuhe’s face was cold as he stared at the man with the mustache.

However, the man with the mustache ignored him and continued, “I’m telling the truth. It won’t be long before the Chaos Grave spreads. By then, no one can escape!”

“I think you’re Qin Yu!” Si Liuhe didn’t listen to him at all. He shouted, “Take off the magical artifact on you! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude!”

However, the man with the mustache looked at Si Liuhe coldly and said, “You’re harming everyone.”

“You’re misleading people with rumors and deluding the people with lies. You’re courting death!” Si Liuhe shouted angrily. Then he raised his hand and slapped the man with the mustache!

This palm had the power of a raging sea and was incomparably terrifying. It almost destroyed everything, and there was nowhere to hide!

However, just as the palm was about to hit him, the man with the mustache’s body turned illusory straightaway as if he was drawn into the void. In a short while, he reappeared not far away.

Everyone present was shocked seeing this scene!

“Good move!”

“He dodged Si Liuhe’s palm so easily!”

Si Liuhe raised his eyebrows and said, “You have some ability, but that’s all.”

After saying that, Si Liuhe’s aura surged again as if he was going to give the man with the mustache a final blow.

Seeing the man with the mustache become the target, Qin Yu could not stand it anymore.

He tore off the magical artifact on him and threw it to the side. Then he said coldly, “He is not Qin Yu. I am.”

At this instant, everyone’s gazes landed on Qin Yu!

When they saw Qin Yu’s face, the crowd exclaimed in surprise!

“Qin Yu is really here!”

“Yes, it’s him. He killed the elder of the Si family not long ago!”

“I didn’t expect him to come up!”

Si Shiyue’s face turned cold. He looked in Qin Yu’s direction and could not help but emit a strong killing intent.

Si Liuhe narrowed his eyes, then said indifferently, “As expected, you’re hiding here.”

Qin Yu stepped forward, looked at Si Liuhe coldly, and said, “Si Liuhe, you’re being too overbearing. Why? Did my appearance scare your Si family?”

“Hahaha!” Si Liuhe burst into laughter. “You? I’m afraid you’re not worthy! Let me tell you. You killed our Si family’s people, so you have to die!”

“Let me do it!” Si Shiyue stepped forward, ready to attack.

But Si Liuhe stopped him and shook his head. “I’ve told you. It’s your father’s order. He must die.”

Not far away, Jiang He’s expression didn’t look good. It was unknown what Saintess Gu by the side was thinking.

“Qin Yu has indeed come,” Yao Xi said with a vague smile.

Everyone looked at the two of them. They had already become the main characters of this world.

Si Liuhe put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Qin Yu, you’ve committed a heinous crime. Today, you’ll die for sure.”

Qin Yu knew he was no match for Si Liuhe but didn’t wait to die. Instead, he quietly adjusted his internal qi to the maximum.

“Alright, you can die now,” Si Liuhe said indifferently.

After that, Si Liuhe raised his hand and casually slapped in the direction of Qin Although it was just an ordinary palm, it contained an incredibly terrifying force! It was even more powerful than the palm strike just now!

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and stared at the palm sweeping toward him!

“Boom!”

Very quickly, that palm slapped over!

The entire land collapsed instantly, raising smoke and dust high and blocking everyone’s vision!

The scene fell silent. Some people felt sorry, and some sighed as if they had predicted Qin Yu’s death.

However, at this moment, the smoke and dust dispersed. Qin Yu was still standing there firmly!

The Golden Light on his body had been shattered, and his body was covered in blood. Many of his bones were broken.

However, Qin Yu did not collapse. His internal qi did not even show the slightest hint of sluggishness!

“As expected of Si Liuhe…” Qin Yu wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth, feeling extremely shocked.

Si Liuhe was even more surprised. He laughed and said, “As expected of someone who could kill an elder of my Si family. Not bad, not bad!”

Yao Xi, Saintess Gu, and the others were also surprised. Yan Guyun, standing beside them, narrowed his eyes, thinking about something.

“It’s indeed a pity for such a talent to die just like this,” Si Liuhe shook his head and said.

As he spoke, the internal qi on his palm surged again and became even more terrifying!

“But… You’d better go to hell.” Si Liuhe’s tone instantly turned cold.

“Stop!”

At this moment, a loud shout sounded! Then he saw Xiao Hai standing beside

Qin Yu.

“Mr. Xiao?” Qin Yu’s expression changed, and he immediately panicked.

“Mr. Xiao, this matter has nothing to do with you. Leave quickly!” he urged.

However, Xiao Hai was not a coward. He looked at Si Liuhe and said coldly, “The famous Si Liuhe is bullying a junior. How despicable!”

“Who are you?” Si Liuhe was slightly surprised.

At this moment, someone recognized Xiao Hai and exclaimed, “He had a conflict with the elder of the Si family in Divine Fortuity City. He also killed several people from the Si family!

...

“His name is Xiao Hai. I’ve heard of him. He’s a genius in Nanzhou! ”

Hearing this, Si Liuhe said in surprise, “Oh? You came at the right time. I’ll kill you too.”

Si Liuhe raised his hand and looked in Xiao Hails direction.

“Si Liuhe!” Qin Yu shouted hurriedly. “This matter has nothing to do with Xiao

Hai. Come to me if there’s anything. My surname is not Qin if I’m a coward!”

However, Si Liuhe looked indifferent as he said, “It’s just two ants. I’ll stomp both of you to death together.”

Si Liuhe slapped a palm strike again after saying that.

At this moment, Xiao Hai raised both his hands. He mimicked Si Liuhe and pushed both his hands toward Si Lihue at the same time.

“Boom!”

A loud bang exploded in the void! Xiao Hai was forced back three steps!

Si Liuhe’s palm strike was easily resolved!

...

This time, everyone was stunned!

Si Liuhe had been famous for many years. He was one of the top existences in the Holy Region.

However, this Xiao Hai could actually resolve his move?

“That Xiao Hai… He seems to be using the same move as Si Liuhe!”

“How is that possible? Could it be that Xiao Hai once cultivated in the Si family?”

“Impossible! Absolutely impossible!”

“Who are you? ” Si Liuhe asked coldly. “How do you know our Si family’s palm technique?”

“I’ve just learned it, ” Xiao Hai said quietly. “I knew I was no match for you, so I pushed hard with both hands.

“Unfortunately, it seems that my hands couldn’t defeat you.”

After hearing what Xiao Hai had said, the place instantly fell terribly silent!
