Chapter 1315: Chapter 1315, kindred spirits 

Ever since Di Zun’s arrival, his talent had been developed.

The numbers on the god testing stone were not fake. His improvement could be described as godly.

At this rate, it was very likely that he would surpass Ling Yun.

Ling Yun said coldly, “Master, don’t worry. I will definitely kill that Qin Yu personally. It’s just that... he chose Yang City as his location. I’m afraid that he will take the opportunity to escape to the western ridge.”

“Escape to the western ridge? If he wanted to escape to the western ridge, he wouldn’t have chosen Yang City.”First Elder shook his head.

Ling Yun frowned. “Why?”

First Elder waved his hand and didn’t answer this question. Instead, he said, “In short, you should recover as soon as possible and head to Yang City to get rid of him. At the same time, in order to prevent any accidents, I will prepare another plan for you.”

Ling Yun nodded. With a cold expression, he said, “If Qin Yu dares to escape, I will kill all the people of Yang City!”

...

On the other side, Qin Yu was hurrying towards Yang City.

Three thousand stars was an extremely distant place.

Even Wen Er’s wind-chasing stallion needed three days.

It was impossible for the wind-chasing stallion to travel all the time. Every thousand stars, it would need to rest for a period of time.

That night, Qin Yu brought the wind-chasing horse and stopped at a small town.

“Let’s stop here for today. Rest for the night, and we’ll continue our journey tomorrow.”Qin Yu patted the wind-chasing horse’s head and asked the people in the shop to provide food for the wind-chasing horse.

Qin Yu also needed to rest. Without the support of spiritual energy, he was very much like an ordinary person in many aspects.

For example, he would be hungry, tired, and so on.

After settling the wind chasing colt down, Qin Yu went to the restaurant. He ordered a table full of dishes and began to eat like a wolf.

This place was like a courier station. Many people were in a hurry and were travel-worn.

The entire restaurant was filled with people. There were burly men and young masters who were well-dressed and well-fed.

Qin Yu ate a mouthful of food and drank a mouthful of wine. He was quite happy.

At this moment, two people suddenly came in from the door, a man and a woman.

The man had many scars on his face, revealing his fierce aura. The woman wore a veil to cover her face.

The man glanced around and finally his eyes fell on Qin Yu’s table.

He walked quickly to Qin Yu and said coldly, “Friend, can you finish this table of dishes all by yourself?”

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “What does this have to do with you?”

The Man’s face turned cold and coldly said, “The tables here are scarce, but you’re occupying so many of them by yourself!”

“What does it have to do with you? You want to care about how much I eat?”Qin Yu put down the cutlery in his hand and raised his head to look at the man.

The man no longer spoke nonsense and coldly said, “Hurry up and eat. Give up your seat.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “The speed of my eating has nothing to do with you. You Don’t have a place to eat, so what does it have to do with me?”

“Do you want to die?”This man’s body emitted a chill.

Qin Yu also coldly looked at this person and said, “You are really overbearing. Why? Do you think I am easy to bully?”

“I think you are tired of living!”This man no longer said anything. He raised his hand and grabbed at Qin Yu.

“AH SAN, stop.”

At this moment, the woman behind him, who was hiding her face, stopped him.

The man called Ah San hurriedly retreated to the side.

Then, the woman walked to Qin Yu, she said politely, “Fellow Daoist, I’m really sorry to disturb your meal. It’s just that I have a strange disease and need to eat within a certain period of time. Do you think I can share a table with you?”

Qin Yu glanced at the woman. Seeing that she was speaking politely, he waved his hand and said, “Yes, but that Ah San can’t do it.”

“You!”Ah San immediately became furious, but the woman shook her head at him. He could only give up.

“Thank you, fellow Daoist. This table is on me.”The woman bowed and said.

Then, she sat opposite Qin Yu.

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with them and only cared about eating and drinking.

Meanwhile, the woman ordered another table of dishes. What surprised Qin Yu was that the woman ordered more dishes than Qin Yu, filling up the entire table!

Even the Knowledgeable Qin Yu couldn’t help but be slightly stunned at this moment.

The woman seemed to see Qin Yu’s confusion and explained awkwardly, “Because of my health, I need to eat a lot every day. Please Don’t blame me, fellow Daoist.”

Qin Yu saw that she spoke politely, so he asked curiously, “What kind of illness are you suffering from? Why is it so Strange?”

Normally, at this level, one would already be fasting. Eating was just to satisfy one’s spiritual needs.

“What does it have to do with you? Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask!”Ah San berated.

The woman frowned and said, “AH San, don’t be rude!”

Then, the woman looked at Qin Yu and said with a bitter smile, “It’s a long story...”

Qin Yu was even more curious.

Could this woman be like him?

Thinking of this, Qin Yu asked tentatively, “Where are you going?”

The woman did not hide anything and said, “To Yang City. Where is my fellow Daoist?”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. He did not answer the woman’s question but continued, “What are you going to Yang City for? It can’t be for the vitality of life, right?”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
