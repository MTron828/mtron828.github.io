Chapter 107: A Nobody Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The car slowly left. Qin Yu watched as the Yan family’s car disappeared from his sight.

Yan Ruoxue, who was in the car, also shed a tear.

Qin Yu stood there for a long time. He clenched his fists tightly and forced himself not to shed a tear.

“I will definitely, definitely go to Jingdu as soon as possible.” Qin Yu couldn’t help but raise his head and roar.

And the people around him looked at him as if they were looking at a lunatic.

Qin Yu returned to the hotel. He packed his things and quickly left South City for Jiangcheng.

With three stalks in his hand, Qin Yu wanted to increase his strength as soon as possible and advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage.

Along the way, Qin Yu’s mood was extremely heavy and it was difficult for him to calm down.

As soon as he closed his eyes, he would see Yan Ruoxue’s figure.

“Ruoxue, wait for me,” Qin Yu muttered softly.

On the same day, the news of Yan Ruoxue’s departure swept through the entire Jiangcheng.

Countless people heaved a sigh of relief inside.

Yan Ruoxue gave everyone immense pressure and intimidation.

During this period of time, everyone restrained their actions for fear that they would accidentally provoke her highness.

“Yan Ruoxue has finally left.”

“D*mn, we’ve been walking on eggshells during this period of time.”

“If Yan Ruoxue has left, doesn’t that mean that Qin Yu doesn’t have a backer?”

“Yep, without Yan Ruoxue as a backer, Qin Yu’s days are numbered.”

” ...”

At night, Qin Yu returned to Jiangcheng.

At home, Yao Qing had been waiting for him for a long time.

“Mr. Qin.” Yao Qing made a cup of tea for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu took a sip of tea, then looked at Yao Qing and said, “During this period of time, I want you to do me a favor.”

“Mr. Qin, please go ahead.” Yao Qing hurriedly nodded.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said, “I want you to protect me for at least three days.”

“Protect you?” Yao Qing couldn’t help but be stunned.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “I’m going into closed-door cultivation. I can’t be disturbed by anyone.”

“Yao Qing, I only trust you now,” Qin Yu said seriously.

Yao Qing was immediately flattered by the favor and hurriedly said, “Don’t worry, Mr. Qin. I’ll do my best!”

Qin Yu nodded and waved his hand. “Go to rest for the night.”

After returning to his room, Qin Yu laid on the bed, but he still couldn’t fall asleep.

As long as he closed his eyes, Yan Ruoxue’s gentle face would appear in front of him.

In his mind, the words that Yan Ruoxue had said kept echoing.

Qin Yu sat up from the bed.

He took a deep breath and sat cross-legged on the bed to force himself to calm down.

For cultivation, the state of mind was important.

For the whole night, Qin Yu’s state of mind quietly changed.

He didn’t know if Yan Ruoxue’s words had played a role, but Qin Yu felt that his heart seemed to have hardened a little.

The next morning, Qin Yu walked out of the room.

There was no expression on his face, but it was tainted with a trace of ice-cold internal qi.

“Mr. Qin.” Yao Qing had already brewed tea for Qin Yu.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Call Lei Hu to come and see me.”

“Yes, Mr. Qin.” Yao Qing hurriedly nodded and said.

Half an hour later, Lei Hu brought Lance to Dragon Paradise.

In the living room, Yao Qing served tea for the few of them, while Lei Hu was filled with apprehension.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word and just quietly looked at Lei Hu.

“Lei Hu, how’s the recent earnings?” Qin Yu asked.

Lei Hu quickly said, “Mr. Qin, our market share is steadily rising. I have already opened a factory to mass produce the Soul Nourishment Pill.”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said, “Once Miss Yan leaves, I reckon many people will target me and even want to get rid of me.”

“Lei Hu, do you have such thoughts?” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and looked at Lei Hu coldly.

Lei Hu’s expression immediately changed and he hurriedly shook his head as he said, “Mr. Qin, I absolutely have no such intention! If it weren’t for you, I would be a good-for-nothing now and would have been blacklisted sooner or later...”

Qin Yu looked at Lei Hu coldly. After confirming that Lei Hu had no intention of rebelling, Qin Yu continued to ask, “Alright, I won’t mistreat you guys.”

“Thank you, Mr. Qin!” Lei Hu hurriedly nodded.

After that, Qin Yu stood up and glanced at Lance while saying, “I promised you last time that I would teach you the breathing exercise. Come and look for me in a week.”

Lance bowed and said, “Thank you, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu wouldn’t completely trust Lei Hu, so he had to bribe Lance.

After Lei Hu left Dragon Paradise, he couldn’t help but wipe the sweat off his forehead.

“D*mn it, he scared me,” Lei Hu muttered.

Lance frowned and said, “Lei Hu, don’t tell me you really have ulterior motives?”

“Nonsense!” Lei Hu scolded loudly.

“Do you think I’m as stupid as those people? Since Miss Yan has taken a fancy to Mr. Qin, then Mr. Qin definitely has something special about him!”

“I believe that Mr. Qin will definitely achieve something remarkable soon!”

...

After Lei Hu left, Qin Yu left the Dragon Paradise with Yao Qing.

“Mr. Qin, where are we going?” Yao Qing asked.

Qin Yu said, “To find a quiet place.”

This quiet place referred to Riverside Villa, which Shen Tian had stayed in.

The environment there was quiet, uninhabited, and full of spiritual energy. It was exactly the place that Qin Yu needed.

After the destruction of the Shen family, Shen Yun’s relatives took over their assets and put them up for auction online.

Qin Yu and Yao Qing soon arrived at the Riverside Villa.

Yao Qing walked forward and knocked on the door.

Soon, a man came out and opened the door.

“Who are you looking for?” The man asked.

Yao Qing quickly said, “I heard that this place is for sale, and we plan to buy it.”

The man glanced at Qin Yu and nodded. “Come in.”

The few of them walked into the Riverside Villa together. As soon as they entered, they saw four to five people sitting in the villa.

“Hey, Qin Yu.” As soon as he saw Qin Yu, a young man in the room stood up.

Qin Yu glanced at him and said, “I don’t think I know you.”

“It’s okay if you don’t know me, but I know you.” He sneered.

“I’m Liu Bu from the Liu family!” Liu Bu said with a bit of arrogance.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Liu Family? I’ve never heard of them.”

Liu Bu’s expression changed and he said angrily, “You! Fine, it’s fine if you don’t know me, but you know Lin Wan, right?”

“Oh, that unruly little girl.” Qin Yu nodded.

Liu Bu said with a cold expression, “Because of you, Lin Wan was almost sent to the coal mine! Previously, because of the Yan family, I didn’t dare to touch you. Now that Yan Ruoxue has left, I’ll see what you can do on your own!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “What do you want to say?”

Liu Bu snorted lightly. “I’ll give you a chance. Either kneel down, and I’ll make a video, or I’ll beat you until you kneel down. It’s your choice.”

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “Once Miss Yan has left, a nobody like you have the guts to stir up trouble?”
