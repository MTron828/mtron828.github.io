Chapter 1058: Chapter 1,058 led to the first secret realm 

“In the entire world, only Qin Yu is worthy of my attack!”Yan Jinyao said proudly with his hands behind his back.

When he heard this, the heavy internal Qi on the immortal Crane’s body instantly spread out.

In an instant, the entire room trembled!

Crack

The bottles and porcelain on the table were shattered!

That powerful pressure pierced straight into the bottom of his heart!

Yan Jinyao, who was closest to the immortal crane, felt it extremely deeply. His expression changed slightly as he looked at the immortal crane in surprise.

“If you want to fight with Qin Yu, I don’t have the right to interfere. However, I will come back after he recovers,”said the immortal crane coldly.

“If you doubt that you want to challenge Qin Yu Now, I can act on his behalf.”

Yan Jinyao’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Although he was a little surprised by the crane’s strength, he was extremely inflated now that he had Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue’s bloodlines.

He even believed that he was the number one person below a mighty figure! As long as he did not become a mighty figure, he was definitely not his match!

Hence, yan jinyao sneered, “Where did this blind fellow come from? Since you want to die, then I’ll Grant You Your Wish!”

After saying that, Yan Jinyao slapped the face of the crane!

That terrifying internal Qi spread out, causing the crane to dance wildly!

The crane’s face was calm. It raised its hand and casually welcomed the attack.

“Boom!”

The violent collision directly overturned the roof of the Hall!

Yan Jinyao was forced back several steps by this internal Qi before he could stabilize his body! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

That powerful force penetrated through Yan Jinyao’s body and headed straight for his internal organs!

His face turned pale, and his heart was even more shocked!

Who was this man in front of him? ! He was actually so powerful!

When did another powerhouse appear in this world? !

Yan Jinyao resisted the urge to vomit blood and pretended to be calm, “You have some ability. There are not many people in this world who can fight with me, Yan Jinyao. You are one of them.”

At this point, Yan Jinyao looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “Qin Yu, I, Yan Jinyao, don’t want to take advantage of others. I will come to find you when you are better!”

After saying this, Yan Jinyao turned around and left without looking back.

Qin Yu looked at the immortal crane and said, “How are you? Are you okay...”

The Immortal Crane shook its head and said coldly, “You should take care of yourself.”

Qin Yu laughed bitterly and said helplessly, “It’s really a case of a house falling into the rain. I didn’t expect Yan Jinyao to break through at this time...”

He was definitely a great enemy! An extremely powerful opponent!

Yan Jinyao left the Heaven Gate with quick steps. Only when he returned to the Yan family did he spit out a mouthful of blood!

His face was ferocious as he said angrily, “How is this possible! How is this possible! I’m the unrivalled one in the world! Who Is this man? We are both martial saints, how can I be inferior to him!”

At this moment, Yan Jinyao’s heart was undoubtedly on the verge of collapse. He thought that he was unrivalled in the world, but unexpectedly, besides Qin Yu, another one had appeared!

“Damn it, damn it! I must kill all of you!”Yan Jinyao was incomparably furious, and his heart was almost twisted.

...

In the next few days, Qin Yu was recuperating while thinking of countermeasures.

The five-petaled Lotus was extremely powerful. Qin Yu did not want to endure it a second time.

If he were to rely on his physical body to withstand it again, his soul would probably be shattered.

“I wonder how many more such magic artifacts there are in the second secret realm.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He flipped his palm and took out the soul bell.

The power of the soul bell should not be below the five-petaled lotus.

However, once this item was activated, it would be an indiscriminate attack. Who knew how many people would be sacrificed.

“I wonder how Zhai Xing is doing.”Qin Yu put away the soul bell and thought in his heart.

If he could make Zhai Xing betray him, that would naturally be the best.

However, if it was really not possible, Qin Yu could only activate the soul bell and fight to the death.

“No one can stop me!”Qin Yu’s tone was somewhat vicious.

At this moment, the immortal crane suddenly walked in from outside the door.

He sat beside Qin Yu and asked casually, “How is your body?”

Qin Yu nodded and said, “It’s almost recovered. When I find a way to deal with the five-petal Lotus, we will immediately take action a second time.”

At this moment, immortal crane was silent for a moment, then said, “I came to find you precisely for this matter.”

Qin Yu’s eyes carried a hint of surprise as he waited for Immortal Crane to continue.

Immortal Crane said, “You saw the result of the last battle. The second mystic realm is not stable.”

Qin Yu nodded. Just as immortal crane said, during the last battle, the second mystic realm had many cracks in the void. This was enough to prove that the second mystic realm could not withstand such a large-scale battle.

“You know why I came.”Immortal Crane stared at Qin Yu and said in a low voice.

“Yes, I didn’t forget,”Qin Yu agreed.

That was not only immortal crane’s goal, but also Qin Yu’s goal.

“So... no matter what, the second mystic realm can’t be destroyed,”immortal Crane’s voice became extremely serious.

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Then what do you mean?”

Immortal Crane stood up and said with his hands behind his back, “The second mystic realm can’t withstand so many of us fighting. If we keep fighting, the second mystic realm will be destroyed.”

“The best way is to let Gu Zizhen come out. In short, we can’t start a large-scale war in the second mystic realm. If the second mystic realm is destroyed, then it’s over.”

Qin Yu immediately frowned.

He touched his chin and said in a low voice, “It’s basically impossible to let him come out. It seems that we still have to take Gu Zizhen away...”

“Take Gu Zizhen Away?”Xianhe was a little surprised.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “The best way to avoid a large-scale battle is for me and Gu Zizhen to fight each other. However, the premise is to turn over Zhai Xing and use Gu Zizhen.”

“In this way, we can get rid of Gu Zizhen and preserve the second mystic realm.”

Originally, Qin Yu almost gave up on Zhai Xing. However, after hearing Immortal Crane’s words, he had no choice but to continue the old method.

...

The second secret realm.

Gu Zizhen played with the pill in his hand, preparing to go find star seizer.

During this period of time, his suspicion of star Seizer had become deeper and deeper. At the same time, he was also dividing the power of star seizer step by step.

“Star Seizer, you’d better not betray me, or else I definitely won’t spare you!”Gu Zizhen slowly stood up and said coldly.

Just as Gu Zizhen was about to stand up and go to find Star Seizer, a phantom suddenly descended!

Seeing this shadow, a trace of respect immediately appeared on Gu Zizhen’s face.

He hurriedly got up, bowed, and said, “Greetings to the higher-ups.”

The higher-ups looked at Gu Zizhen coldly and said, “The second mystic realm must not be lost. We must defend it at all costs. Do you understand?”

Gu Zizhen bowed and said, “Please rest assured. I will definitely defend the second mystic realm.”

The higher-ups grunted and said, “If necessary, even if the second mystic realm is destroyed, it can not fall into the hands of Qin Yu.”

“Of course, we will also help when necessary.”

Gu Zizhen hurriedly nodded and said, “Please rest assured. I understand.”

“Come here.”At this moment, the higher-ups suddenly said.

Gu Zizhen was stunned, but he still obediently walked in front of Gu Zizhen.

He raised his finger and pointed at the center of Gu Zizhen’s brows. A Ray of light entered his mind.

“Master, what is this?”Gu Zizhen asked with some confusion.

The master said coldly, “A backup plan for you. I hope you won’t need it.”

Gu Zizhen still wanted to ask something, but the master didn’t give him the chance. He turned around and left.

“Master, why does the higher-ups value the second secret realm so much?”Long Mei asked, puzzled.

Gu Zizhen glanced at long mei and said slowly, “Because... the second secret realm is the only way to the first secret realm!”
