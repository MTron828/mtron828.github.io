Chapter 1022: Chapter 1,022, three punches

In the blink of an eye, he had broken Qiao Zun’s spell. Such strength could not help but shock everyone!

Qiao ZUN’s expression naturally did not look good. He looked coldly at Qin Yu and said, “What do you mean by this, sir?”

“Nothing much. I just don’t like you,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Qiao Zun opened his mouth and was about to speak, but Qin Yu turned into a gust of wind and arrived in front of him in the blink of an eye!

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

He raised his hand and punched three times!

Each punch landed on Qiao Zun’s throat, chest, and abdomen.

These three seemingly ordinary punches actually made the arrogant Qiao Zun kneel on the ground!

A set of movements was completed in an instant.

Its speed was so fast that people couldn’t react in time!

“Wah!”

Qiao Zun’s mouth kept spitting out blood and acid, and his body curled up into a shrimp shape! He looked like he was in extreme pain!

His eyeballs enlarged, his body trembled, and his hands kept stroking his throat!

The people watching at the foot of the mountain instantly widened their eyes!

Who was this black-robed man? ! How could Qiao Zun be so vulnerable in front of him? !

“Argh...”

Qiao Zun’s face was distorted. Blue veins popped up on his forehead due to the pain.

“Who... who are you...”Qiao Zun said in pain.

Qin Yu did not answer him. Instead, he said coldly, “You dare to speak so arrogantly on the mountain of the five mountains. Is that all you have?”

“You are going too far. I... I will kill you...”Qiao Zun used all his strength and spat out a few words!

With that, Qiao Zun raised his palm again. A divine light that was like a rainbow rapidly shot out from his palm!

The incomparably heavy mountain and sea realm emitted thousands of strands of divine might of the Great Dao. It was incomparably heavy and shook the entire ground, causing it to rumble.

As Qiao Zun extended his palm forward, the mountain and sea realm surged forward in an imposing manner. It grew larger and larger, as if it wanted to Swallow Qin Yu within!

Facing the mountain and sea realm that contained the Great Dao, Qin Yu’s expression was incomparably calm.

He raised a single hand and abruptly waved his palm.

“Bang!”

An ear-splitting sound rang out, and the mountain and sea realm collapsed with a bang under this wave!

Hiss...

Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air! Their faces were filled with shock!

A casual palm had broken Qiao Zun’s secret technique? Just who was this person?

One had to know that this Qiao Zun was a martial saint! He was the representative of the unrivalled in the world!

At this moment, Qiao Zun’s face was filled with terror!

As a martial saint, he naturally knew what this level of strength meant!

Qiao Zun opened his mouth as if he wanted to beg for mercy. However, Qin Yu did not give him a chance at all. The heavy pressure spread out and instantly pressed Qiao Zun to the ground!

“Remember, don’t talk nonsense in your next life, and don’t bump into the muzzle of a gun.”Qin Yu’s cold voice was like a death sentence.

Looking at Qiao Zun who was like a stray dog, Qin Yu didn’t have the slightest bit of pity in his heart.

He slightly raised his hand, and a golden light slashed at Qiao Zun from Qin Yu’s hand like a flying knife.

“Swoosh!”

Qiao Zun’s head and nascent divinity that had just been born were instantly cut into two!

“Bang!”

As his body fell to the ground, Qiao Zun’s body completely disappeared.

There was complete silence below.

No one had expected such an ending.

Qiao Zun, who was enjoying the beautiful future just a moment ago, had turned into a corpse in the blink of an eye.

The many martial artists below looked at each other and discussed animatedly.

“Who is that black-robed man? How could he be so powerful?”

“Killing a martial saint is like slaughtering a dog. Could it be that this person is a legendary Almighty?”

“Heaven Gate? What kind of organization is this? Why haven’t I heard of it before?”

“I know, it must be Qiao Zun spouting nonsense on the Wuyue supremacy mountain and angering the gods! This black-robed man was sent by the Heavens!”

Everyone discussed animatedly. They looked at Qin Yu on the mountain peak and felt uneasy.

No one knew if this person was an enemy or a friend. Would he be the next sky blood rainbow that brought despair.

At this moment, Qin Yu, who was standing on the mountain peak, slowly turned around.

Under everyone’s gazes, Qin Yu reached out and took off the black robe on his head, slowly revealing his true appearance.

That thin figure, his cold gaze, his delicate and handsome face that carried a trace of determination, every part of it was so distinct!

“It’s... It’s Qin Yu! He’s Qin Yu!”

No one knew who was the first to shout out! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“How... How is this possible? ! How Could Qin Yu have such strength? You must have seen wrongly, right?”

“Bullsh * t, if that’s not Qin Yu, then who is it? It’s him who has returned. He must have stepped into the martial Saint Realm!”

Everyone stared at Qin Yu’s figure with incomparable excitement.

However, the martial artists from the mystic realm did not look too good.

They stood at the side and did not make a sound. However, a strong sense of unease lingered in their hearts.

“Qin Yu, you’re finally back!”

“Thank you, Mr. Qin, for standing up for us!”

Qin Yu swept his gaze across the martial artists and said coldly, “Standing up for you? Why should I stand up for you?”

Hearing those words, everyone was immediately silenced! A trace of awkwardness appeared on their faces.

Qin Yu looked at the crowd and said with a cold laugh: “All of you should go find the martial arts association in Jingdu to stand up for all of you. Once I finish what I need to do, I will immediately leave the fire country.”

After throwing out those words, Qin Yu turned around and left.
