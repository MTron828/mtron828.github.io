Chapter 1534: Chapter 1,534, Sima Bei’s true body 1

Hearing Heavenly Blood Rainbow’s words, Qin Yu wasn’t too surprised. He only asked indifferently, “Do you have any countermeasures?”

Heavenly blood rainbow replied, “Once the immortal slaughtering Saint Sword is used, nothing can survive and nothing can be destroyed. There are no good countermeasures.”

Qin Yu raised his brows and sneered, “So powerful?”

“Of course. However, his immortal slaughtering Saint Sword has clearly not reached the level of perfection,”Heavenly Blood Rainbow said.

Qin Yu did not say anything more and looked up at Sima Bei.

The immortal slaughtering saint sword had already been condensed. Before it was slashed out, the remaining power had already shattered the surrounding mountains and rivers!

The Fallen Life Valley, which was already badly damaged, had now turned into a wasteland.

Sima bei looked at Qin Yu coldly and said, “Brat, die!”

Along with his furious roar, the immortal slaying holy sword slashed towards Qin Yu. Its speed was extremely fast and its power was boundless!

Facing the immortal slaying sect’s technique, Qin Yu naturally didn’t dare to be negligent. He immediately stretched out his palm and took out an iron rod!

The Dark Iron Rod danced in Qin Yu’s hand. Even when facing the immortal slaying Holy Sword, it didn’t lose out in the slightest.

“Clang!”

Qin Yu waved the iron rod in his hand and faced the saint sword.

......

In an instant, a deafening clanging sound pierced his eardrums and blood flowed out of his seven orifices!

Under the obstruction of the iron rod, even the saint sword could not get close.

In addition to Qin Yu’s unparalleled strength, he forced the saint sword back in one move!

But at this moment, the saint sword changed its direction and chopped down at Qin Yu from above!

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. He put away the iron rod and stretched out his hand, wanting to grab the immortal slaughtering Saint Sword!

But what shocked Qin Yu was that after his hand touched the immortal slaughtering saint sword, it actually went straight through it!

“En?”Qin Yu was greatly puzzled!

The iron rod just now could clearly touch the immortal slaughtering saint sword, but why couldn’t his palm?

“The immortal slaughtering Saint Sword doesn’t have a physical body, so it can only rely on divine weapons,”heavenly blood rainbow reminded.

Qin Yu snorted coldly and said, “Then I’ll use this iron rod to smash his immortal slaughtering Saint Sword!”

After saying that, Qin Yu grabbed the iron rod, and an extremely powerful force erupted from his entire body!

This force was unprecedented, and it was extremely oppressive. Even Zhuo Jing, who was in the distance, seemed to be unable to withstand it! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“What a terrifying power!”Sima bei’s expression changed drastically!

Was this power really emitted from the body of a newly advanced mighty figure? It was simply inconceivable!

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed to have fused with the iron rod. All of the power gathered on the iron rod. For a moment, even the iron rod was buzzing, as if it was about to be resurrected!

Qin Yu’s body turned into golden light. He held the iron rod in his hand and smashed it fiercely at the Saint Sword of the Immortal Slayer!

“Boom!”

A huge explosion spread out, and the entire area was turned into nothingness.

The Saint Sword of the Immortal Slayer actually exploded under Qin Yu’s vast divine power. It was truly incomparably terrifying!

Even the Saint Sword of the Immortal Slayer could not defeat Qin Yu. Sima bei had already sensed that something was wrong.

He did not dare to think any further and immediately planned to leave.

But at this moment, Qin Yu had already stepped on the line word formula and arrived in an instant!

That pitch-black iron rod headed straight for Sima Bei!

Sima bei’s expression changed greatly. He hurriedly took out his dharma treasure in an attempt to block this iron rod.

But all the dharma treasures were not worth mentioning in front of Qin Yu’s divine power. Everything was shattered in an instant!

“Boom!”

The iron rod arrived as scheduled. It hacked down with force and ruthlessly struck Sima Bei’s body!

Sima Bei’s chest instantly exploded, and fresh blood sprayed out!

His body fiercely fell to the ground, smashing a large hole in the ground.

Qin Yu naturally would not give him the chance to escape. He immediately closed in on him.

He raised his foot and stepped on Sima Bei’s head. After that, he coldly said, “You’d better behave yourself. Otherwise, I’ll crush your head and Crush Your Divine Sense.”

Sima bei and Leng ‘er came over and looked at Qin Yu. They said, “Kid, I really didn’t expect to be defeated by you. It seems that the northern lands have underestimated you...”

“You talk too much nonsense.”Qin Yu coldly said.

He looked down at Sima bei and said, “Speak. What exactly is the relationship between the northern lands and the immortal slaying sect?”

Sima bei laughed loudly and said, “Qin Yu, don’t waste your energy. Do you think I will tell you? If you have the ability, kill me!”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered, “You still have some backbone. Alright, then I will send you on your way!”

After saying that, Qin Yu used all his strength and directly crushed Sima Bei’s head!

His head exploded and fresh blood spilled on Qin Yu’s feet.

But what surprised Qin Yu was that he did not see Sima Bei’s primordial spirit in his mind!

“HMM? How could this be?”Qin Yu could not help but widen his eyes!

At this moment, a ray of light floated out from Sima Bei’s chest.

This was a strand of Sima Bei’s divine sense. At this moment, it was standing in midair, looking coldly at Qin Yu.

“Brat, do you think you can kill me?”Sima bei said coldly.

“A strand of divine sense?”Qin Yu frowned slightly.

He looked at this body and said in a low voice, “Could it be that this isn’t Sima Bei’s original body?”

“Hahahaha! You guessed right!”Sima bei said with a cold smile.

“You’re still very young to want to kill me. Don’t worry, my northern lands will kill you sooner or later!”

Qin Yu didn’t have the mood to listen to his nonsense anymore. He immediately waved his hand and erased this strand of divine sense.

At this moment, in the freezing northern lands, a pale-haired old man opened his spectacles.

His expression was terrifyingly gloomy. His shriveled claw-like palm slowly clenched.

In an instant, the entire world seemed to sense his anger. An avalanche descended from the sky!

And this person was none other than Sima Bei’s true body!

His true body wasn’t a young man. On the contrary, it was an extremely old man!

“Lord Sima Bei!”

At this moment, someone walked in quickly.

He knelt in front of Sima bei and asked in a trembling voice, “Lord Sima Bei, what happened?”

Sima bei took a deep breath and said slowly, “My clone died.”

“What? Who Did It? Could it be that the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect has come out from closed-door cultivation?”The other party’s expression immediately changed!

Sima bei shook his head and said coldly, “It was someone called Qin Yu...”

Speaking up to this point, Sima bei slowly stood up.

He took a deep breath and said, “We must inform the king of this news as soon as possible. That Qin Yu can not be left alive!”

...

After killing Sima Bei, Qin Yu walked in front of Zhuo Jing.

He bowed slightly and carried zhuo jing up.

“Many thanks, Brother Zhuo.”Qin Yu’s tone carried a trace of gratitude.

Zhuo jing smiled bitterly, “I almost thought I was going to die... But I’m very curious, why would Sima Bei come here? Could it be a coincidence?”

Qin Yu’s expression darkened, and he said coldly, “This isn’t a place to talk. I’ll bring you back first.”
