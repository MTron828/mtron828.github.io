Chapter 1062: Chapter One Thousand and sixty-two, a desperate battle 

“Supreme sand? What is this?”Qin Yu asked.

The mustached man waved his hand and said, “It’s something used to refine artifacts. You Don’t need to know too much.”

“How do you know everything?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but mutter.

“Forget it, let’s not talk about this. You have so many Babe on you. It shouldn’t be a problem to deal with this five-petal lotus, right?”

The handlebar mustache stroked his chin and didn’t speak for a long time, as if he was weighing the pros and cons.

He walked to the side and muttered softly, “If I lend him the Babe, it might be ruined for me.”

“But if I don’t lend it to him, he might die under the five-petal lotus. I Won’t have a chance to step into the second mystic realm.”

“Damn it, if there’s nothing in the second mystic realm, won’t I be at a loss?”

Qin Yu listened to his muttering and couldn’t help but kick him in the butt from behind.

“There must be a babe in the second secret area. That is the ruler behind the Jingdu Martial Arts Association,”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse.

The mustached man glanced at Qin Yu and sighed. “Sigh, if you can’t bear to part with a child, you can’t catch a wolf. Forget it, forget it.”

After saying this, the mustached man flipped his palm, and a gourd that flickered with purple qi landed in his palm.

Seeing this gourd, Qin Yu could not help but say in surprise, “Isn’t this the purple-gold gourd? If I remember correctly, I gave you this thing, right? Damn it, you can’t even bear to lend me the thing I gave you?”

“If you gave it to me, then it’s mine. Of course, it’s up to me whether I give it or not,”the handlebar mustache muttered.

“Give it to me!”Qin Yu snatched the purple-gold gourd.

Compared to the first time he saw the purple-gold gourd, this gourd seemed to have become even more mysterious.

Internal Qi kept flowing down from it. The aura was thick and heavy. When it landed on his palm, it was like a huge pile of sand.

“Are you sure this thing can resist the five-petal Lotus?”Qin Yu asked.

The mustached man sneered, “Five-petal Lotus is nothing. It’s not even worth mentioning in front of my purple-gold gourd.”

“Okay, I’ll trust you this time.”Qin Yu picked up the purple-gold gourd.

“Let me tell you, this item means a lot to me. Don’t break it for me,”the mustached man said nervously. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll return this item to you after I conquer the second secret realm.”

Since he had the item to deal with it, Qin Yu didn’t need to go to the martial arts association in Jingdu anymore.

He stayed in the Heaven Gate and quietly waited for the arrival of time.

Time flew by, day after day.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Early in the morning, Qin Yu got up early and prepared to go to the second secret realm.

But at this time, the immortal crane followed him.

“I’ll go with you,”said the immortal crane.

Qin Yu knew he couldn’t refuse, so he nodded and said, “Okay.”

Therefore, the two of them got up and rushed toward the second secret realm.

This was the third time they had attacked the second secret realm. The difference was that Qin Yu didn’t bring a large group of people this time.

The gate of the second secret realm slowly opened, and Qin Yu and the Immortal Crane stepped into it.

“Quick, go and inform the Realm Master that Qin Yu is here!”Xuan qi shouted.

“No need.”At this moment, Gu Zizhen’s figure appeared nearby.

He floated over with his hands behind his back.

Then, a golden light floated from Gu Zizhen’s palm and landed in the direction of the exit.

This was a secret treasure given to him by the higher-ups. It could seal this secret realm to prevent Qin Yu from escaping!

Gu Zizhen glanced behind qin yu and sneered, “Just the two of you?”

“The two of us are enough,”Qin Yu said coldly.

Gu Zizhen couldn’t help but laugh out loud, “Qin Yu, are you crazy?”

Qin Yu sneered, “I don’t know if you’re crazy or not, but I’ll definitely kill you today.”

“Kill me?”Gu Zizhen narrowed his eyes slightly.

His eyes revealed a trace of strangeness and slyness.

And this look made Qin Yu feel that something was wrong.

Could it be that... Zhai Xing had informed Gu Zizhen?

“Do you really think that everything is under your control?”Gu Zizhen raised his eyebrows.

As he spoke, thousands of martial marquis surrounded him!

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu’s expression immediately became somewhat ugly!

“I knew it. You humans are unreliable,”immortal crane said coldly.

Qin Yu had nothing to say. He never thought that Zhai Xing would lie to him!

“Bring him up.”

At this moment, Gu Zizhen waved his hand.

Then, he saw Zhai Xing being brought up by two people.

His internal Qi had been exhausted to the extreme, and he was extremely weak!

“I’ve long discovered your business,”gu Zizhen snorted.

A hint of confusion flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

Didn’t they say that these people were extremely convinced of Zhai Xing? At this moment, Zhai Xing was being suppressed, so why didn’t they have the slightest reaction?

Gu Zizhen seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s confusion. He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “It seems that you still don’t understand a principle. Profit is always the first thing. As long as the profit is enough, anyone can betray you.”

As he spoke, these thousands of martial marquis erupted with Qi energy at the same time!

The dense and heavy internal Qi was approaching Qin Yu and Immortal Crane! Even the two of them felt a trace of pressure!

“It seems that we can only fight with our backs to the wall,”immortal crane said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “But... What if the second mystic realm can’t take it anymore?”

“Let’s Save Our Lives First.”Behind Immortal Crane, a strange phenomenon appeared!

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t say anything more. He adjusted his internal Qi and prepared to fight to the death.
