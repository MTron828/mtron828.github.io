Yong Ji slowly stood up from his throne. He looked at Qin Yu and said coldly, “I also long to fight with you, but unfortunately, it’s not now.”

“Don’t worry. Iron Egg will definitely not make a move,”Qin Yu said coldly.

“No one here will make a move. Only you and me. Do You Dare?”

Yong Ji said with a sneer, “I’ll let you grow for a period of time. When the time comes, I’ll fight you.”

“Grow for a period of time?”Qin Yu nearly laughed out loud.

“Yong Ji, you really think highly of yourself. Do you think I treat you as a target? “I know you don’t dare to fight me today. Then, please go back and deliver a message to the few godly monarchs in the northern lands. I’ll end them with my own hands.”

Yong Ji’s expression was ice-cold. He did not say a word as he looked at Qin Yu. No one knew what he was thinking.

And Qin Yu did not make a move. He knew that it was too difficult to stop Yong Ji now.

Soon, Yong Ji’s body disappeared into the darkness. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, he left the place.

“Why did you let him leave?”Someone seemed to be extremely puzzled.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I can’t stop him.”

“Doesn’t that mean that he can come and go as he pleases? Even if he really loses, he can still leave?”Someone asked.

“Theoretically speaking, it’s like this.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Unless we wait for the Death River to disappear and for the two plates to completely merge, but we can’t wait that long anymore.”

It was precisely because Xiao Hai had long since peered into this level that he had rashly stepped into the death river and headed to the northern lands.

“Qin Yu, do you have any ideas?”The leaders of the surrounding large sects and sects all surrounded him.

“If you need us to do anything, just say the word!”

“That’s right. As long as we can kill these bastards, we’re willing to go through fire and water!”

Unknowingly, these people had already treated Qin Yu as their sustenance.

Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “I will think of a way. Everyone, go back for now. Please find me at the Great Yue Mountain in a few days.”

Everyone did not say much and agreed one after another.

After they left, Qin Yu looked at Iron Egg. He opened his mouth and was just about to thank him, iron Egg took a step forward and said, “There’s no need to thank me. I’m not here to save you. I just want to fight with those godly monarchs.”

Qin Yu looked at iron egg and said, “Are you confident?”

“Yes,”iron egg said concisely.

Qin Yu grunted and said, “I’m afraid I’ll need your help in the future. You should get used to this body as soon as possible.”

Iron egg sneered and said, “What do I need to get used to to dealing with them?”

“Not them.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“I have a very bad premonition that there will be a great battle between the Southern Prefecture and the northern lands.”

It was likely that iron egg would not be facing the three godly monarchs, but the master of the northern lands.

“Qin Yu, what should we do next?”The deputy sect master walked forward and asked.

Qin Yu looked at the deputy sect master and said, “First, increase your strength as soon as possible. Second, deputy sect master, if you want to think of a way to find the sect master of the Tianyun sect, he must take action.”

The deputy sect leader opened his mouth and smiled bitterly, “I’m afraid this will be very difficult. I...”

“That’s why you have to think of a way.”Qin Yu interrupted the deputy sect leader.

The deputy sect leader saw this and could only nod his head, “Alright, I’ll try my best.”

After that, Qin Yu asked again, “How many days will it take to swallow the Huangji Buddha Flame?”

The deputy sect leader replied in a deep voice, “The fastest will be a year, the slowest will be a few hundred years.”

Qin Yu gasped when he heard this.

Several hundred years?

This number was a little too exaggerated.

“In that case, I’m afraid I won’t be able to devour the Huangji Buddhas Flame for the time being.”Qin Yu sighed.

It was definitely not an easy task to find a place with dense dark energy in a short period of time.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu felt that there was only one way.

That was to improve his physical body and increase the strength of his physical body as soon as possible.

Just as Wen Wanyun had thought, his physical body had reached the void-level!

Once his physical body reached the void-level, Qin Yu would definitely not be afraid when facing those few godly monarchs!

“Master, I’m afraid that I still need your help to send me to that body tempering place that you brought me to previously.”Qin Yu looked at Wen Wanyun.

However, Wen Wanyun shook his head and said, “The last time you did not succeed, it means that there is no way for your physical body to break through again.”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Master, do you have a better idea?”

A trace of coldness flashed across Wen Wanyun’s face.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “As the saying goes, if you don’t break through, you won’t succeed. I do have another place, but there’s a certain risk.”

“It’s okay. Just say it,”Qin Yu hurriedly said.

Wen wanyun said coldly, “Purple-red volcano!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Purple-red volcano? What is that place?”Qin Yu said with some surprise.

The deputy sect master next to him scolded, “Wen Wanyun, don’t come up with such a bad idea. You are trying to send him to his death!”

Wen wanyun coldly said, “Besides the purple-red volcano, do you have a better place?”

“That won’t do!”The deputy sect master shouted, “If Qin Yu dies, the South Province will have one less war general!”

Wen Wanyi opened his mouth and was about to refute, but Qin Yu quickly interrupted him and said, “What exactly is this purple-red volcano?”

The deputy sect master said with a cold face, “That is the heaven fire, the quenching fire, not the body tempering fire!”

“That’s right, the quenching fire.”Wen wanyi also nodded slightly.

He sized up Qin Yu’s body and said, “But I feel that this body of yours is not inferior to a magical artifact or divine weapon. You can give it a try.”

“Nonsense!”The deputy sect master said with his eyes wide open.

Qin Yu was silent. Of course, he knew what the quenching fire meant.

Top-tier divine weapons were almost invulnerable to all kinds of flames. It was very difficult to melt them, so they needed extremely powerful flames.

This quenching fire was enough to melt all kinds of divine weapons. It was enough to show its terrifying power.

The deputy sect master and Wen Wanzhu argued endlessly. The two of them held completely different views.

At this time, Qin Yu said in a deep voice, “Alright, stop arguing. I have my own decision.”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Wen wanyi and said, “Then where is the purple-red volcano?”

Hearing Qin Yu’s words, Wen Wanyi was instantly delighted. He said with a smile, “That’s right. Only a man who dares to take risks is a man!”

“You’re full of nonsense. Qin Yu is really unlucky to be in your hands!”The deputy sect master said somewhat exasperatedly at the side.

Wen Wanyi couldn’t be bothered with him. He said with a smile, “I’ll take you to the purple-red volcano now.”

“Not now. I still have things to do,”Qin Yu said in a deep voice.

“Let’s return to the great Yue Mountain for now.”

The deputy sect master pulled Qin Yu and said, “Qin Yu, don’t be rash. This old bastard doesn’t have any good intentions. He has disappeared for so long that I even suspect that he has gone to the northern lands!”

“F * ck your Bullsh * T! If you dare to spout nonsense again, do you believe that I will tear your mouth apart?”Wen Wan was so angry that he blew his beard and glared.
