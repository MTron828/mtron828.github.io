2269 The True Purgatory

Qin Yu saw that in an instant, all the spiritual energy and souls of the hundreds of dead people were absorbed into the underground of the palace. In a short while, those people turned into ghastly white bones.

The entire palace’s floor was made of unknown metal and carved with enormous pictures. There were statues of strange-looking people hunting the demonic beasts and people suffering various tortures.

Qin Yu kicked away a large piece of bone in the middle, and an enormous carving of several thousands of feet appeared in front of everyone.

Countless people were walking toward a demon god in the middle of a gloomy continent. The faces of those people looked incomparably numb and were expressionless.

All of a sudden, the images before his eyes began to blur. All the statues and the pillars supporting the entire palace started changing and shifting non-stop.

As it shrank and enlarged, a “person” with red hair and fangs and a bare upper body suddenly appeared. He held a chain with countless skulls, and hundreds rolled on the ground like balls, making a chilling sound.

“Whoosh!”

The iron chain suddenly lashed out. Everyone could only catch a faint cold light as the iron chain flashed past.

The many cultivators who came into contact with the chain suddenly stopped moving.

“Hey, friend, what’s wrong?”

A cultivator lightly touched the person next to him, and that person turned into countless powders and dissipated.

“What the hell is going on here? We’ll all die if this continues!”

“Evil Exterminator, quickly explain! Is this a conspiracy of your sect?!”

“Evil Exterminator, if you don’t speak, we’ll kill you first!”

Another hundred or so people died directly. No matter how calm the cultivators were, they could not help but point their fingers at Evil Extermination, who had issued the Divine Command of Execution.

Just as they spoke, that “person” swung the iron chain and launched another round of attacks, killing dozens of people on the spot!

A figure appeared behind that “person”. Chang Ye’s two fingers formed a seal, and a green rune appeared on the back of the person with red hair and fangs.

That person’s body emitted a thick green smoke. His eyes turned red from the pain, and those red eyes shone with a fiery light. Even just eye contact with that person made Qin Yu feel his soul drawing in.

The person from Satan suddenly turned around and pulled the iron chain. The iron chain was like a poisonous snake, coiling toward Chang Ye’s body.

Chang Ye’s body suddenly shattered into countless greenish spiritual energy fragments. It was actually a rune embodiment.

However, the moment he died, two identical persons with red hair and fangs suddenly appeared on the wall.

As the two persons with red hair and fangs began to attack, the people in the main hall began to let out miserable screams.

Even Qin Yu dared not simply receive the chain. He could not feel the spiritual energy fluctuations within it at all, and he did not know if he could withstand the chain.

In just a quarter-hour, about half of the cultivators in the main hall had died.

They were all veteran cultivators who had lived in this galaxy for many years. Their strength was considered top-notch, but unexpectedly, half of them were gone just like that.

Suddenly, the main hall shook violently, and an incomparably loud bell rang in the hall.

Qin Yu’s body suddenly staggered and almost fell into the pile of bones.

“Have these skeletons completely materialized?”

At this moment, Qin Yu’s feet could completely feel the icy cold touch on the bone. Some maggots that had lived for countless years were slowly squirming on it.

At this moment, the palace had completely stabilized, and everything within had fully materialized.

Outside the main hall, the palace shook violently. A giant phantom spread out and far away in an instant.

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. The materialized parts of the palace were probably between the eighth and seventh levels of purgatory. As for the areas that had spread out, it was unknown how far they had spread. Even the furthest place Qin Yu released his divine sense to was covered by this phantom.

“Something’s wrong! My spiritual energy seems to have reduced!

“No, my soul seems to have been affected. The circulation of my divine sense seems to become obscure.

“What’s going on? The domain of my rules seems to have been suppressed.”

…

The cultivators in the main hall were discussing. Most of them had panic expressions on their faces. Many people had never experienced such a thing before. The Mystic Realm this time had completely gone beyond their understanding.

Only Chang Ye, Situ Haoyue, Mei Li, and the other people with top-notch cultivation remained calm.

Qin Yu unleashed his desolate divine eye. In the black-and-white rules line world, he saw countless densely intertwined threads entwining everyone. However, the color of those threads was an entirely new shade that he had never seen before.

Qin Yu felt a moment of heart-pounding fear. What he saw with his desolate divine eye was the line of connection between the cultivators and heaven and earth after they comprehended the Path of Heaven. The more these lines of rules, the stronger the cultivator’s cultivation was.

For example, the Gale Resistance Boot he saw at Master Suo Lin’s stall. He saw with his desolate divine eye that the Gale Resistance Boot was connected to many lines of rules, and he thus knew it was a treasure.

At this moment, lines of another color covered everyone’s heads. It was definitely not the power of the Path of Heaven that they had comprehended.

It was another kind of power of rules, and this power of rules had an inexplicable suppression on everyone.

However, this inexplicable power of rules had suppressed the cultivation of many cultivators by about two-thirds. This was extremely terrifying.

“Which era’s power of the Path of Heaven is this?”

Qin Yu gasped.

Moreover, even under the phantom, the power of the Path of Heaven still existed. Many cultivators outside the purgatory were also enveloped by the power of rules. They could not avoid it.

And outside the palace, the person with red hair and fangs also appeared and chased after the human cultivators.

“Do you understand now? No one could escape it. Whenever the Ghost Mansion appears, the human race will suffer a massacre. Even the Immortal Slaying Sect could not escape such a massacre. If you continue to be scattered, it’s even more of a dead end.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The evil exterminator said coldly.

At this moment, this galaxy had become a true purgatory.
