1988 The Six Semi-Saints

Soon, Qin Yu arrived on top of the Sky City wall.

Gu Xinghe was standing in the air outside Sky City.

Two cultivators were beside him. Their internal qi was tremendously fierce, and their faces were full of ruthlessness.

At this moment, being captured and tortured by the two cultivators, Wen Da and Wen Er looked beyond recogniction.

!!

Blood stained their bodies, and their internal qi was weak. The two had weak internal qi, to begin with. Now that they had suffered such torture, they became incredibly weak.

Qin Yu, standing on the city wall, was furious seeing the scene!

“Gu Xinghe! You d*mn b*stard!” Qin Yu’s roar instantly shook the entire Sky City!

Everyone looked at the city wall. Seeing the man standing on the city wall shining with golden light, they couldn’t help but exclaim.

“That person… is Qin Yu?”

“He’s covered in golden light. He must be Qin Yu, the chaotic body.”

“What’s happening? Is this Gu Xinghe, the city lord of Serene South City?”

Soon, many people walked out of Sky City to watch the scene.

Not far away, Gu Xinghe had his hands behind his back. Being such despicable person, he certainly did not care about Qin Yu’s cursing.

“Qin Yu, you’ve finally shown up,” he said with a hint of mockery.

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and glared at Gu Xinghe, saying. “Wen Da and Wen Er are innocent. Let them go!”

“Hahaha!” Gu Xinghe could not help but laugh out loud.

“Qin Yu, you and I have known each other for so many years. You should know me well. Why are you still talking such nonsense?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s expression was incredibly unsightly. He knew Gu Xinghe would never let them go. He would not give up until he achieved his goal.

“What do you want?” Qin Yu said coldly.

“It’s very simple,” Gu Xinghe said with a smile. “I want you to walk out of Sky City.”

“Who has asked you to come?” Qin Yu took a deep breath and clenched his teeth.

Gu Xinghe sneered and said, “Qin Yu, you’ve offended so many people. You should know this in your heart!”

“You stole the Si family’s treasure, worked with the mysterious person from the demon race to poison the disciples of the nine great aristocratic families and took away the treasure at the auction. Everyone wants to skin you alive!”

Qin Yu looked at Gu Xinghe coldly and said, “These have nothing to do with me. You guys made all these up. Are you trying to frame me?”

“Whether or not I’m framing you, you know very well in your heart,” Gu Xinghe laughed evilly and said. “I don’t want to waste my breath on you. If you don’t talk out of Sky City, I’ll kill the two of them immediately!”

With that, Gu Xinghe suddenly raised his hand and placed it on Wen Da’s head.

Wen Da raised his head with tremendous difficulty. He seemed to have used the last of his strength and shouted, “Qin Yu, don’t… come out! They won’t let you off…”

“Do you want to die?” Gu Xinghe looked at Wen Da coldly.

Wen Da no longer had the strength to say anything, and his head drooped.

“I’ll count to three. If you don’t come out, I’ll kill him,” Gu Xinghe said coldly.

Following that, he cleared his throat and shouted, “One!”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but tremble.

He knew if he did not walk out of Sky City, Gu Xinghe would definitely kill the two of them!

“Two!” at this moment, Gu Xinghe shouted again.

The voice was like a death-hastening talisman, constantly stimulating Qin Yu’s nerves.

Just as Gu Xinghe was about to call out three, Qin Yu’s feet trembled, and he left Sky City.

The moment Qin Yu left Sky City, six people quickly walked out of the void!

These six people were all in the Semi-Saint realm!

The space was quickly sealed. A Semi-Saint even stood at the gate of Sky City, cutting off Qin Yu’s escape.

Seeing this, everyone in the city sighed with emotion.

“Qin Yu really cares for his friends.”

“Yes, he would rather risk his life to save his friend!”

“This kind of person is worthy of respect. I don’t believe he would do something like steal the treasure from the auction!”

Although the discussions in the city were not loud, Gu Xinghe and the others could still hear them clearly.

This instantly infuriated Gu Xinghe. His face darkened, and his expression was full of malice.

“He actually managed to win the people’s hearts…” Gu Xinghe clenched his fists tightly. The scenes that had taken place on earth kept replaying in his mind.

“So what? He’s already a dead man. The influence of a dead man is not worth mentioning,” the cultivator beside him said indifferently.

These words instantly prompted Gu Xinghe, and his anger subsided immediately.

He looked at Qin Yu not far away and said with a faint smile, “Qin Yu, you have to pay the price for your evil deeds. Today, you will surely die. Even the heavens can’t save you!”

Glancing at the six Semi-Saints around him, Qin Yu knew he was behind the eight ball today.

He took a deep breath and said, “I’m already out. Release the two of them.”

“Hahaha!” Gu Xinghe instantly laughed heartily.

Looking at Wen Da and Wen Er, who were like dead dogs, Gu Xinghe couldn’t help but mock, “You’re really willing to give up your life for two trash? Are you crazy?”

“Cut the f*cking crap! If you don’t let them go, I’ll definitely kill you!” Qin Yu’s face was ferocious, and an extremely strong killing intent burst out from his body!

...

This killing intent was cold and pure. Even though the two were far apart, it still made Gu Xinghe shiver.

“Don’t talk nonsense. Quickly kill him! We can’t give him any chance to catch his breath!” Gu Xinghe said hurriedly.

The six Semi-Saints couldn’t help but sneer. One of them stepped forward and released his pressure, looking at Qin Yu coldly.

“Follow me to the Si family with me. Maybe you can save your life,” the Semi-Saint said indifferently.

“The Si family actually did such a despicable thing!” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Despicable? Hahaha! Qin Yu, you’re the one who provoked the Si family first,” the Semi-Saint said coldly.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. There was a big gap between the Reversion Void Stage and the Semi-Saint.

Except for unique existence like Jue Wu, who had absorbed the power of treasures, no one, including heaven’s favorite, could fill the gap.

Looking at Qin Yu, the Semi-Saint couldn’t help but ridicule, “What? Do you still want to fight? You should know you’re no match for me. Instead of suffering, you might as well follow me back.”

“I know it’s hard, but I still want to try,” Qin Yu said coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Yu’s internal qi exploded! At the same time, Qin Yu directly activated the fifth level of the fighting word formula!

...

A powerful internal qi engulfed most of Sky City! In an instant, sand and stones were flying outside Sky City, and the situation changed drastically.

Even the Semi-Saints were surprised.

“As expected of the chaotic body. You do have some ability.”

“Even Young Master Feng had lost to you. It’s not an injustice.”

“We can’t keep him alive. If he grows and develops in the future, he’ll definitely be amazing!”
