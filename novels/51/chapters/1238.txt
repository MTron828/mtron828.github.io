Chapter 1239: Chapter 1,239: Meet the Dao Protector 

This person exuded an extremely mysterious internal qi and was extremely oppressive. He was like a huge mountain that could not be crossed just by standing there.

The two black-robed men looked nervous as they said in a trembling voice, “You... You’re the Dao Protector?”

Dao Protector?

Qin Yu was stunned.

This man in front of him was his father?

“There’s only one way to get to Earth. You should know this,”said the Dao Protector.

His voice was like a ringing bell, causing one’s heart to tremble.

The two black-robed men gritted their teeth and cupped their fists. “Lord Dao Protector, we have something important to do. We have no choice but to reward earth. We’ll leave now...”

“Why didn’t you pass through the ancient array platform?”asked the Dao Protector coldly.

“We...”the two black-robed men were instantly rendered speechless, as though they had something to hide.

“Since you didn’t abide by the rules, I’m afraid you’ll have to stay here,”the Dao Protector continued.

Once these words were said, everyone’s expressions instantly became tense!

“Lord Dao Protector, please show mercy. We... We guarantee that this will be the last time!”The two black-robed men hurriedly defended themselves.

However, the Dao protector sneered and said, “It’s not the first time for you.”

The two black-robed men had ugly expressions. They looked at each other, and a hint of madness flashed in their eyes.

“You plan to attack me?”The dao protector saw through their thoughts with a glance.

The two black-robed men coldly said, “This is the princess of our Yan family. No one is allowed to hurt her, not even the Dao Protector.”

“Oh? Just the two of you?”The Dao Protector said coldly.

“Whether it works or not, we’ll know after we try!”

The two black-robed men roared angrily, and a precious seal quickly appeared in their palms! ..

The two of them joined hands and slapped towards the Dao Protector!

The moment the seal was formed, the secret realm completely collapsed! A terrifying internal Qi swept through the world, uprooting all the trees in the forest, and causing large areas of space to fall off!

Such a method was shocking!

The two precious seals closed in on the Dao Protector, but the dao protector stood there as if he was unmoving.

In the next second, the Dao Protector waved his sleeve, and the two precious seals mysteriously disappeared!

Before the two black-robed men could regain their senses, a huge palm had already slapped in front of them.

“Bang, Bang.”The two black-robed men fell to the ground, no longer breathing.

Such a method was shocking!

To subdue two top-tier cultivators with a raise of his hand, what kind of method was this? !

At this moment, Qin Yu was staring at the Dao Protector. He protected Yan ruoxue behind him and then looked at his father coldly.

Facing Qin Yu’s madness, the Dao Protector, who was hiding under the internal Qi of chaos, revealed a smile.

At this moment, Qin Yu was like an angry husky in the eyes of the Dao Protector.

Although the enemy was strong, Qin Yu had no intention of retreating. This was because behind him was the woman he loved the most.

Qin Yu looked coldly at the dao protector and said, “Don’t worry, I will never ask for mercy from you. Come, let us fight!”

“Let us fight?”The Dao Protector’s voice was a little strange.

“That’s right!”Qin Yu shouted. His divine power surged, and in the next second, he charged at the Dao Protector!

This punch had almost used up all of Qin Yu’s power, but the dao protector only raised his hand and easily grabbed Qin Yu’s fist.

That vast power made Qin Yu’s face turn pale!

This feeling was like facing a vast ocean! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Even though he didn’t move at all, it still caused great waves to rise in people’s hearts!

“Greetings, Uncle Qin.”

At this moment, Yan Ruoxue walked forward and slightly bowed to the Dao Protector.

This “Uncle Qin”, not to mention Qin Yu, even the Dao protector was slightly startled.

He released Qin Yu and said indifferently, “My prediction was right. Your bloodline is stronger than I imagined.”

“Uncle Qin, you flatter me.”Yan ruoxue was graceful. She didn’t show any fear even in the face of the powerful and terrifying guardian.

The Guardian put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “You should know the consequences of forcefully barging into Earth.”

“Ruoxue is willing to be punished.”Yan ruoxue nodded slightly with a smile on her face.

The Guardian looked at Yan Ruoxue for a long time and then said with a faint smile, “Well, this is what you said.”

With that, the Dao protector flashed slightly, and instantly appeared in front of Yan Ruoxue.

Seeing this, Qin Yu’s pupils immediately shrank!

“You... Don’t touch her!”Qin Yu shouted anxiously, and then rushed toward the dao protector like a madman!

Just when he was nervous, the Dao Protector raised his hand and gently knocked on Yan Ruoxue’s forehead.

“This time, I’ll treat it as a warning to you,”The Guardian said indifferently.

Yan ruoxue smiled and said, “Thank you, Uncle Qin.”

“I can warn you.”At this moment, the Guardian changed the topic.

“Even if you’re my future daughter-in-law, you mustn’t break the rules.”

This sentence of “Future daughter-in-law”made Yan Ruoxue’s pretty face blush like a ripe apple.

Qin Yu, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but blush. He also heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.

“Damn it, you scared me,”Qin Yu muttered in his heart.

“Alright, leave quickly. Remember, this is the last time. If there is a next time, I won’t show Mercy,”The Guardian said indifferently.

Yan Ruoxue bowed again and said, “Thank you, Uncle Qin.”

After saying this, she looked at the two black-robed men and said, “Uncle Qin, they...”

“Don’t worry. They just fainted. They will wake up in five minutes,”said the Dao Protector indifferently.

Hearing this, Yan Ruoxue immediately bowed and thanked him.

The Dao Protector glanced at Qin Yu and turned to leave without saying anything.

How Could Qin Yu Miss this opportunity? He had too many questions in his heart and immediately chased after him.

With the speed of the Dao Protector, Qin Yu naturally could not compare to him. However, he seemed to have deliberately slowed down his speed, so that the distance between the two of them remained dozens of meters.
