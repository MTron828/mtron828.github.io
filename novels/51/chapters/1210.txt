Chapter 1211: Chapter 1,211, Escape to the Holy Region? 

Unfortunately, Qin Yu searched the entire palace, but could not find the fourth formation flag. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He put away the flag, but he was not in a hurry to leave triangle city. Instead, he asked around for information about the Lord.

As expected, the people of Triangle City respected the lord very much, as if he was a god.

As for the black robed man beside him, they were all his followers.

The high lord that everyone spoke of was different, but no one knew where the High Lord had gone.

It was only in the evening that Qin Yu left Triangle City.

Although he had not been able to find the high lord on this trip, he had reaped quite a bountiful harvest.

This at least showed that there must be an array flag on earth. If one wanted to go to the holy region, they did not have to rely on the people of the Holy Region.

After bringing the array flag back to the fire country, Qin Yu once again paid a visit to ye Qing, wanting him to help him retrieve the surveillance footage and locate the position of the Lord.

Ye Qing did not know who the Lord was, but he had a deep understanding of boss Bao.

“This boss Bao is the actual controller of Triangle City, and the city Lord is just a puppet that he supports.”Ye Qing said as he smoked.

Qin Yu didn’t care about this. He just wanted to find this so-called Lord and kill him to avenge his mother.

“Qin Yu, this commander Bao can’t die because this involves the establishment of diplomatic relations. If you kill him, I’m afraid that internationally...”ye Qing frowned.

As a member of the Military District, Ye Qing had to consider these issues.

“Commander Ye, do you think the impact of me slaughtering triangle city is greater or the impact of killing Commander Bao is greater?”Qin Yu’s tone was full of threat.

Ye Qing was silent for a moment. He knew that Qin Yu’s words were not false.

As long as Qin Yu wanted to, massacring triangle city was nothing at all.

“Okay, I can help you, but you have to keep it a secret,”ye Qing said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Thank you.”

After that, Qin Yu returned to the Heaven Gate.

That night, Qin Yu could not help but sigh slightly.

Although his current combat strength was not something that even mighty figures were afraid of, without the support of spiritual power, many things were extremely inconvenient to do.

He had no choice but to mobilize the people of the Heaven Gate to look for the Lord of Triangle City.

For the next few days, Qin Yu stayed in the Heaven Gate.

Three days later, ye Qing asked someone to deliver a USB drive to Qin Yu. Inside it was the surveillance footage that Qin Yu needed.

He found a computer and opened the surveillance footage.

Qin Yu carefully watched the video, afraid that he would miss a single detail.

When he finished watching the video, he couldn’t help but feel mixed emotions.

Director Bao, Old Meng, and the four black-robed men had indeed disappeared near the ancient array platform.

“Could it be that they went directly to the Holy Region?”Qin Yu couldn’t figure it out.

If they had the ability to go to the saint-level, why did they have to wait until now.

Or could it be that the ancient array formation didn’t only lead to the saint-level? It could also lead to other places?

But the ancient array formation on earth seemed to only lead to the saint-level.

“These bastards really left decisively.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but curse in his heart.

At this moment, Qin Yu didn’t know whether to be happy or sad.

The good thing was that it was now basically confirmed that there was a formation flag on Earth that connected to the holy region. In this way, he could also head to the Holy Region.

Just like Xiao Yu from before, she absolutely couldn’t rely on the people from the holy region sects to head to the Holy Region.

And the sad thing was that it was said that the holy region was extremely huge, tens of times, hundreds of times, or even thousands of times the size of earth!

With such a vast area, it was even harder to find these B * stards than ascending to the heavens.

Qin Yu could not help but grit his teeth and said in a low voice: “These few pieces of trash, you better live well.”

... . .

On a certain shore on the other shore of the fire country, there was a small boat floating in the air.

The boat looked extremely dilapidated, as if it had gone through many violent storms.

But it was just such a dilapidated boat, and there was a young man sitting cross legged on it.

His aura was surging, and every trace of his aura was fusing with the sea, as if he had absorbed the internal Qi of the sea.

After a while, the young man suddenly opened his eyes!

In an instant, streams of dragon-like internal Qi surged out of his body, creating waves that were hundreds of thousands of feet high!

The sea fish scattered all over the sky, and then fell down with crackling sounds. Countless fishermen widened their eyes.

“Is this the legendary Prince of fishing?”Someone exclaimed.

“Prince of fishing? The one who claims to be invincible in the world of fishing?”

The young man seemed to be quite dissatisfied with the title of Prince of fishing.

With a wave of his hand, the fishing boat exploded instantly, and the fishermen on the boat turned into a bloody mist.

Then, the young man snorted coldly. He stepped on the water and sped toward the Great West.

This person was none other than Jiang he’s previous disciple, Jiang Yi.

Ever since his battle with Qin Yu, he had left Jiang he’s side.

Over the past few years, he had traveled almost the entire earth and comprehended countless spells and insights. He had even developed a set of spells that belonged to him.

Now, his realm had already reached the peak of the martial saint realm. He was only a hair’s breadth away from being a half-step mighty figure!

It was not an exaggeration to say that other than those hidden mighty figures, Jiang Yi was the person with the highest cultivation!

“Qin Yu, you’d better wait for me.”Jiang Yi muttered coldly as he stepped on the surface of the sea.

He had been galloping on the surface of the sea for a few days like this. What was surprising was that he did not seem to have exhausted his internal Qi. His aura had always been at the peak!

After all, even if a mighty figure walked on the surface of the sea for a few days, his spiritual power would be exhausted. However, Jiang Yi was not affected at all!
