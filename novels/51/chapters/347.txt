“You want to bring Qin Yu into the spotlight now? Isn’t it too early?” The butler frowned.

“Qin Yu’s performance is indeed good, but it’s still not enough for him to deal with any powerful family.”

Old Mister Yan put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Even if he isn’t ready, do you think no one will target him?”

“There are some things that can’t be completely controlled, so it’s better to let nature take its course.”

Just as Old Mister Yan said, Qin Yu disrupted Old Mister Yan’s plans.

From the moment Qin Yu came to the Yan family, his name had already been remembered by others.

“Do as I say.” Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said.

The butler said, “Okay, Old Mister Yan, when will it be?”

“In three days,” Old Mister Yan said.

“Yes, Master.” The butler nodded and agreed.

At this moment, Qin Yu was cooking with Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu’s cooking skills were very good. After all, he had cooked a lot in the Su family.

But today, Yan Ruoxue didn’t let Qin Yu do it.

Qin Yu, who was bored to death, began to wander around the kitchen.

Updates by

The kitchen of the Yan family had various facilities. Most of these facilities were to ensure the freshness of the ingredients.

At this moment, Qin Yu found a Snow Lotus in a transparent glass jar.

Even though this Snow Lotus was soaked in various medicinal juices, Qin Yu could still feel that this Snow Lotus was extraordinary!

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the medicinal effects of this Snow Lotus surpassed those of all the Snow Lotuses that Qin Yu had ever seen!

“An all-year-round Snow Lotus?” Qin Yu frowned with a look of shock on his face.

Such a holy item was placed in the kitchen just like that? It was simply a reckless waste of God’s gift!

“That was given to my grandfather by someone else.” At this moment, Yan Ruoxue noticed Qin Yu’s gaze.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “A thousand-year-old Snow Lotus? It’s really hard to imagine. The one with the highest medicinal effects that I’ve ever seen is only six hundred years old.”

Yan Ruoxue blinked and said, “Do you like it?”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Who wouldn’t like something like this?”

Yan Ruoxue stepped on her tiptoes and took the Snow Lotus from the cabinet.

“If you like it, then take it.” Yan Ruoxue handed the Snow Lotus to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu was stunned. He hurriedly shook his head and said, “How can I do that? If Old Mister Yan finds out, he’ll say that I’m greedy.”

“It’s just a Snow Lotus. I can call the shots.” Yan Ruoxue stuffed the Snow Lotus into Qin Yu’s hands.

“If I tell you to take it, then take it!” Seeing Qin Yu hesitate, Yan Ruoxue pouted.

Qin Yu had no choice but to keep the Snow Lotus.

He thought to himself, ‘If there’s a chance, I’d better tell Old Mister Yan.’

Of course, if Old Mister Yan agreed, that would be the best.

To Qin Yu, the benefits of a thousand-year-old ginseng were beyond his imagination.

In a short while, the meal was ready.

Qin Yu quickly helped Yan Ruoxue to carry the food out.

“Grandpa, it’s time to eat,” Yan Ruoxue shouted upstairs.

Old Mister Yan, who had a cold expression a moment ago, immediately put on a smile.

It could be seen that Old Mister Yan only looked like an amiable old man only when he was facing Yan Ruoxue.

“Try my granddaughter’s cooking,” Old Mister Yan said with a smile.

He picked up a piece of fish and put it into his mouth. Then, he praised, “Delicious! It’s too delicious! Qin Yu, hurry up and try it!”

Qin Yu also quickly picked up a piece of fish. It had to be said that Yan Ruoxue’s cooking skills were excellent. This fish was extremely flavorful, and it retained the taste of the original ingredients.

“Delicious!” Qin Yu said sincerely.

Old Mister Yan said half-jokingly and half-seriously, “Qin Yu, I got to enjoy this because of you.”

Qin Yu coughed and said, “Old Mister Yan, don’t tease me.”

Because it was lunch, Yan Sihai and the others didn’t come back.

At the huge dining table, only three people were eating, and the atmosphere was much more harmonious.

After eating this meal, Old Mister Yan said, “Qin Yu, you can stay here for the next few days.”

“Stay here?” Qin Yu frowned slightly and said awkwardly, “Old Mister Yan, this isn’t appropriate.”

“There’s nothing inappropriate about it. You can even play chess with me when you have nothing to do,” Old Mister Yan said.

“My Grandfather wants you to stay, so you can stay,” Yan Ruoxue said with a smile.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, then I’ll be more respectful.”

After eating this meal, Qin Yu and Old Mister Yan went upstairs.

Yan Ruoxue was one of the most powerful people in the Yan family. She still had things to deal with in the afternoon, so she left the Yan family’s home early.

During Yan Ruoxue’s absence, Qin Yu took out the thousand-year Snow Lotus.

“This is a gift from Ruoxue, but it’s yours after all. I think it’s better to let you know.” Qin Yu placed the Snow Lotus on the table.

Old Mister Yan took a look, then he couldn’t help but stroke his beard and smile. “It’s just a mere Snow Lotus. If Ruoxue wants to give it to you, you can take it.”

“Really?” Qin Yu asked tentatively.

Old Mister Yan waved his hand and said, “This is nothing. I can’t give you a real treasure either.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel speechless.

This thousand-year Snow Lotus was a treasure that couldn’t even be bought on the market.

But Old Mister Yan actually gave it away so casually.

No wonder rumor had it that top-grade herbs were all collected by blue-blood families.

The difference in resources really couldn’t be made up by hard work alone.

At around three o’clock in the afternoon, Yan Ruoxue rushed back to the Yan family’s home.

“There’s a cocktail party tonight. Qin Yu, will you accompany me to attend it?” Yan Ruoxue said after she returned home.

“Cocktail party? What cocktail party?” Qin Yu asked.

Yan Ruoxue said, “It’s just an ordinary cocktail party, a place to eat, drink, and have fun.”

Although Yan Ruoxue said it very light-heartedly, Qin Yu couldn’t help but say, “It’s unsuitable for me to attend such an occasion.”

“There’s nothing unsuitable about it.” Yan Ruoxue blinked and said.

Old Mister Yan also agreed, “It’s good to widen your horizon.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It wasn’t that Qin Yu didn’t want to go, but he was afraid of bringing unnecessary trouble to the Yan family.

But since the Yan family didn’t care, then Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t refuse.

In the evening, a Maybach 62S stopped in the courtyard.

The secretary got out of the car, bowed respectfully and said, “Miss, it’s time for us to set off.”

Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue walked out from upstairs.

Seeing the secretary’s face, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

The secretary’s face also flashed with shock!

Because this secretary was none other than the secretary who accompanied Yan Ruoxue to Jiangcheng!

Qin Yu clearly remembered that this secretary had always looked down on him and had even criticized Qin Yu many times.

He had never expected that the two of them would actually meet here.
