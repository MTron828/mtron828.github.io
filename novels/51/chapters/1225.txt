Chapter 1226: Chapter 1,226, another person had fallen! 

Qin Ygaze was filled with coldness.

He could see through the Deer Emperor’s intentions. The reason why he did this was purely to have fun.

It was rumored that he was someone who had lived for more than a thond years. This kind of person had long lost interest in ordinary pleasures and treated the lives of others like dirt. That was why he would do such a thing, treating life as a joke.

“Fourth contestant, what about you?”The person in charge looked at the fourth person.

The fourth person was dressed in a black robe. His entire body was exuding an aged internal Qi, and he seemed to be extremely extraordinary.

He slowly walked forward and said in a low voice, “Since I’m here, I naturally won’t leave.”

Before he finished speaking, the black robe on his body was instantly shattered, revealing his true appearance!

This was a man with a white beard and looked rather old.

When the person in charge saw his face clearly, he could not help but exclaim in surprise, “You Are... Jian Huang?”

“What? Jian Huang?”

Upon hearing this title, everyone stood up one after another and looked at the old man.

“It’s really Jian Huang!”

“I didn’t expect Jian Huang to actually come! It’s rumored that his eighteen heaven slashes back then could split mountains and rivers, and its power was endless!”

“Jian Huang is actually interested in this purple jade origin snake too!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

Jian Huang? How come he had never heard of him before?

He began to doubt the origin of Deer Emperor Island.

How Come Qin Yu didn’t know any of the famous people here?

Jian Huang didn’t say anything. With a shake of his feet, he arrived in front of the purple jade origin snake.

He also had a treasure sword in his hand. This sword exuded a rotten aura, which was extremely strange and extraordinary.

“Jian Huang, Jian Huang!”

For a moment, countless people at the scene shouted Jian Huang’s name.

Jian Huang was not disturbed at all. With a slight shake of the sword in his hand, a ray of sword light cut through the void and slashed towards the purple jade origin snake!

Such speed shocked even Qin Yu!

The great battle was about to start, and Jian Huang lived up to his reputation. He brandished the treasured sword in his hand, leaving countless afterimages in the air.

The afterimages whizzed and strthe scales of the purple jade origin snake, emitting a melodious and pleasant sound.

The purple jade could not withstand jian Huang’s swordsmanship even if it shot far away. White marks appeared on the scales first, and then a piece of it was shattered!

Traces of blood flowed out, and everywhere the blood passed, it instantly decayed.

The blood of the purple jade origin snake actually contained a lethal poison. It was shocking!

“Hiss...”

The Purple Jade origin snake stout its tongue and looked at Jian Huang with its silver eyes.

Jian Huang knew that such an attack would not be able to kill the Purple Jade origin snake. Therefore, he no longer wasted his energy. Instead, he prepared to activate his top-tier spell, the eighteen heaven slashes!

Jian Huang held his sword with both hands and pointed it at the sky! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In an instant, light gathered on his hands. The light was extremely strange. Auspicious Beasts were galloping! The Divine Dragon and ancient Phoenix could be clearly seen!

Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled in the sky, as if it was summoned by the Sword Emperor. Bolts of lightning fell down and interweaved with his sword.

“Lightning Element?”

Qin Yu was slightly surprised.

The Sword Emperor seemed to have mastered the element of lightning. The eighteen heaven slashes were a perfect combination with the element of lightning.

Everyone was shocked by this sword technique, and everyone was shocked.

Even the Deer Emperor on the stage was impressed and nodded slightly.

“Slash!”

The Sword Emperor roared and pointed his sword at the Purple Jade origin snake!

In an instant, eighteen rays of light interweaved and overlapped. Then, they condensed into a sword and slashed at the Purple Jade origin snake!

The sound of thunder and lightning buzzed and trapped the purple jade origin snake like a cage.

Smoke and dust rose in all directions, obscuring one’s vision. The entire manor was affected.

However, just as the manor was about to collapse, several rays of light rose from the darkness and stabilized the manor that was about to collapse.

“Formation?”Qin Yu was even more shocked when he saw this.

This deer emperor was truly not simple!

Everyone was staring at the center of the explosion as if they wanted to see the results.

As the dust settled, traces of blood seeped out from the ground.

“This... This is the purple jade origin snake’s blood!”Someone exclaimed.

As expected, under the eighteen heaven slashes, the Purple Jade origin snake’s body was covered in wounds!

If one looked closely, one could see that six scales had fallen off the purple jade origin snake’s body!

The scene was completely silent. It was own whether it was because of shock or despair.

The eighteen heaven slashes had something in common with Qin Yabsolute beginning nine slashes. That was that it required a huge amount of spiritual power to support it, and it consumed a huge amount of spiritual power.

Once this technique was used, if one could not kill the enemy, it would mean that one would fall into a passive state, or even a failure.

Jian Huang’s expression was not too good either. He was still calm just a moment ago, but at this moment, he was panting heavily.

On the other hand, although the purple jade origin snake was riddled with injuries, its internal qi and blood were extremely vigorous. It was not affected at all!

“Buzz!”

At this moment, the purple jade origin snake emitted a terrifying internal Qi. Its entire body was trembling as if the earth was shaking.

In the next second, the fresh blood on the purple jade origin snake’s body was like raindrops as it shot through the void towards Jian Huang!

The purple jade origin snake had actually used fresh blood as a means of attack!

Crackling sounds rang out non-stop as drops of fresh blood fell on Jian Huang’s body!

The blood burned holes on his body one after another as the blood seeped into his body!

Jian Huang’s face turned pale and his body began to fester.

Just as everyone was hesitating, Jian Huang suddenly let out a painful roar!

In just a moment, his body began to rot from the inside out. The scene was too horrible to look at!

In just a few minutes, Jian Huang had turned into a puddle of meat. Then, he directly turned into hot air and disappeared!

Jian Huang had also lost!

This made the fifth and sixth contestants even more desperate. After all, Jian Huang was a famous existence!
