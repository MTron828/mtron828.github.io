Chapter 1485: Chapter 1,485, closed-door cultivation 1

First Elder narrowed his eyes. No one knew what he was thinking.

A moment later, first elder sneered.

“Someone must have saved him. Otherwise, even if he could win against the eighteen gods, he wouldn’t be unharmed!”First Elder sneered.

Mo Hong, who was standing by the side, said in surprise, “First Elder, what do you mean?”

First Elder ignored him. He looked at Mo Hong and said, “Go to the medicine sage city now and find out what happened there. Tell me what happened there.”

“Medicine Sage City? There...”

“Go if I tell you to. No need to say anything,”first elder interrupted Mo Hong.

Mo hong nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll go now.”

After he left, the first elder’s expression became even colder.

“Little Bastard, your life is really good...”the first elder said in a low voice.

Just as the first elder was about to turn around and leave, a black-robed man suddenly appeared behind the first elder.

The first elder narrowed his eyes, then suddenly turned around and grabbed at the black-robed man! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

That eagle-like claw directly grabbed at him!

Such a fierce palm was easily caught by the black-robed man!

“First Elder, don’t be so impulsive,”the black-robed man said indifferently.

First Elder looked at the black-robed man coldly and said, “Who are you? How dare you intrude into My Heavenly Cloud Sect? Are you tired of living?”

The black-robed man smiled faintly and said, “I’m here to tell you a good news.”

“Good News?”First Elder narrowed his eyes, then sneered, “Cut the crap! Tell me who you really are!”

“I’m from the northern lands,”the black-robed man said in a deep voice.

As soon as he said this, a hint of surprise flashed across First Elder’s face.

“Have the people of the northern lands gone deep into this place?”First Elder’s expression did not look too good.

The black-robed man laughed loudly and said, “First Elder, you have to believe in the strength of our northern lands. I can even enter the Heavenly Cloud Sect, let alone the other places in the Southern Region.”

A trace of solemnity flashed across the first Elder’s face.

He had heard of the rumors in the northern lands. Rumor has it that top-notch martial artist appeared in abundance there, and they were mysterious and unpredictable.

“What do you want to do in my Heavenly Cloud Sect?”The First Elder said darkly.

The black-robed man smiled faintly and said, “I am here to find the first elder to cooperate, and I am very sincere.”

“Impudent! How could my heavenly cloud sect cooperate with you! Get lost immediately, or don’t blame me for being impolite!”The first elder said angrily.

The black-robed man raised his eyebrows and said, “First Elder, why are you in such a hurry? Why Don’t you listen to my conditions?”

“Don’t even think about any conditions. Get lost immediately!”First Elder shouted angrily.

However, the black-robed man did not have the slightest intention of leaving. This undoubtedly infuriated first elder.

He curled his hands and a terrifying spiritual power burst out. In the next second, he directly grabbed towards first elder!

But at this moment, the black-robed man suddenly took out a book and blocked in front of him.

Seeing this book, the first elder could not help but stop.

There was no other reason. It was because there were three big words written on the book: Sacred Heart Technique!

This was the secret technique of the northern lands. Who knew how many people coveted it!

The first elder narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “What do you mean by this?”

The black-robed man said indifferently, “This is my sincerity.”

After saying this, the black-robed man actually directly stuffed the Sacred Heart technique into first elder’s hands.

Although first elder wanted to refuse, his hands did not listen to him.

He grabbed the Sacred Heart technique and hesitated for a long time, but in the end, he greedily accepted it.

“First Elder, Can We Talk Now?”The black-robed man said indifferently.

First Elder snorted coldly and said, “Spit it out if you have something to say!”

The black-robed man also did not dawdle. He smiled and said, “Our northern land is very sincere. We only want thirty stars of the South Province. Unfortunately, it was broken by Xiao Hai. Not only did he reject our good intentions, he even killed our emissary.”

“Therefore, we changed our minds and decided to take down the entire South Province!”

First Elder’s pupils shrank, and then he sneered, “You want to replace our Heavenly Cloud Sect? I think you are Dreaming!”

Then, first elder wanted to return the Sacred Heart Formula.

The black-robed man waved his hand and said, “No, no, no, First Elder, you have misunderstood. We will definitely not compete with the Heavenly Cloud sect. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be here today.”

Hearing this, the first elder’s expression softened slightly.

“If you have something to say, just say it,”the first elder said coldly.

The black-robed man smiled and said, “We want to ask the Heavenly Cloud sect to cooperate with our northern land. Don’t worry, the southern region will always belong to the Heavenly Cloud sect. We will not stay in the northern land for too long.”

“In order to repay the Heavenly Cloud sect, we will give all the ultimate arts of the northern land to the Heavenly Cloud sect! Not just the Sacred Heart technique, but everything!”The black-robed man said with some pride.

“These secret arts were created by our ancestors, and each one of them is enough to shock the entire Holy Region!”

“With the secret arts of the northern lands and the resources of your Tianyun sect, why would we have to live in a small southern region!”

The black-robed man’s words undoubtedly tempted the first elder.

But at the same time, the first elder also heard something from his words.

Since they wouldn’t be staying for long, it meant that there was something they wanted in the north.

In this way, what Xiao Hai said might be true.

But on second thought, so what if those cultivators died? In any case, it wouldn’t affect the heavenly cloud sect. On the contrary, it would save the resources of the South region. Moreover, they would be able to obtain the ultimate arts of the north. Why Not?

“Our sect master will not agree.”But very quickly, the first elder shook his head.

The black-robed man laughed loudly and said, “Of course I know, so I have to ask the first elder to put in a lot of effort. I know that your relationship with the sect master is extraordinary.”

The first elder frowned slightly, as if he was in a dilemma.

“This is something that is good for both of us. I believe that the first elder is a smart person,”the black-robed man struck while the iron was hot.

“Of course, you don’t have to answer me in a hurry. I can wait for you.”The black-robed man cupped his hands, then turned around and left.

After he left, the first elder impatiently flipped through the Sacred Heart Technique.

As expected, this was the northern land’s ultimate technique, the Sacred Heart Technique!

“That’s great. With this sacred heart technique, my cultivation might be able to advance another step, and I might even be able to step into the reversion void Stage!”For a moment, the first elder was extremely excited!

He picked up the Sacred Heart technique and turned around to return to the cultivation room.

On the other side.

Qin Yu had already swallowed a total of fifty nascent soul pills.

This made his body almost unable to bear it. Even though he circulated his cultivation technique, his face was still ashen from the pain, and cold sweat kept flowing down.

“What is this kid doing?”Wen Da couldn’t help but mutter softly when he saw Qin Yu’s appearance.

“F * ck, it can’t be dysmenorrhea, right?”Wen Er said softly.

“F * ck you, he’s a man. How could a man have menstrual cramps?”

“How can you be sure that he’s a man? Maybe a woman is pretending to be a man.”

“Do you dare to Bet? Whoever loses will drink the same 3000-year-old pure wine!”

“Let’s bet, who’s Afraid of Who!”

After saying that, the two of them walked straight towards Qin Yu.
