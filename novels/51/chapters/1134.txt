Chapter 1135: Chapter 1,135, Yao Qing? ! 

There was no top-tier magic artifact there at all.

This was the countermeasure that Zhai Xing and the pavilion master came up with.

That was to trick Qin Yu away to escape this calamity.

He knew very well that Qin Yu would never abandon them and escape alone, so he came up with this plan.

“The hidden dragon country is a backward and chaotic place. Presumably, Qin Yu will encounter a lot of trouble there,”Zhai Xing said in a deep voice.

Hearing this, pavilion master immediately frowned.

“What do you mean?”Pavilion master asked.

Zhai Xing seemed to have seen through pavilion master’s doubts, so he explained, “Don’t worry. There aren’t any top-notch martial artist there. Trouble is trouble, but no one can hurt him.”

“That’s true,”pavilion master said in a low voice.

The current Qin Yu could even kill a mighty figure, so who could hurt him.

“Qin Yu, I hope you can step into the top and stand at the highest peak of this world, or even the entire universe...”pavilion master said in a low voice.

...

The car sped toward the airport.

On the way, Qin Yu took out a map.

The country marked on the map was called Hidden Dragon Country.

This name looked extremely intimidating, as if it was hiding some magical artifact.

“Hidden dragon country... interesting.”Qin Yu picked up the map.

The car soon arrived at Jingdu Airport.

There were already people waiting for Qin Yu at the airport. The moment he got off the car, someone walked over.

“Is it Mr. Qin? The private plane has been prepared for you. Please follow me.”A woman dressed as a stewardess walked forward and said.

“This Zhai Xing is really thoughtful...”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Regarding star Seizer’s abnormal behaviour, Qin Yu did not think too much about it. After all, in a country like this, there was probably no route at all.

After boarding the plane, they headed towards the hidden dragon country.

The hidden dragon country was not too far away from the fire country, but the speed of the plane was not considered fast. Instead, it seemed like it was deliberately stalling for time.

This was not a car after all, and Qin Yu had no way to urge it, and could only wait.

After about eight hours, Qin Yu finally arrived at the Hidden Dragon Country.

“Is this the Hidden Dragon Country?”After getting off the car, Qin Yu looked at his surroundings and could not help but feel slightly surprised.

The local customs of this country seemed to be slightly backward.

Short and small buildings could be seen everywhere, and there were not even a single tall building that was hundreds of meters tall.

“Hidden Dragon Country...”Qin Yu muttered in a low voice.

He released his divine sense and covered more than half of the country.

What surprised Qin Yu was that there were not many martial artists here, but there was a half-step martial saint guarding it!

“Maybe there really is a spiritual artifact hidden here.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

The map did not indicate the exact location, so Qin Yu had to rely on himself to find it.

When he walked out of the airport, the first thing he saw was the poor and destitute people.

People in shabby clothes could be seen everywhere. Some people were even begging.

The luxurious cars that whistled past formed a sharp contrast with this scene.

Qin Yu frowned slightly and could not help but sigh, “The more backward the place is, the greater the gap between the rich and the poor.”

Most resources were controlled by a very small number of people, which would inevitably cause the gap between the rich and the poor to be too large.

Although Qin Yu felt very uncomfortable, he could not change a society by himself.

Therefore, he could only silently take out his money and give it to everyone.

After doing all this, Qin Yu released his divine sense and found the location of the half-step martial saint.

Then, Qin Yu followed the location of this half-step martial saint and was ready to find him.

However, at this moment, a car sped over and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

Qin Yu glanced at the license plate and realized that it was a rolls-royce, a top-notch luxury car.

Soon, two young men got out of the car.

These two young men were dressed in a heroic manner, but their temperament was extremely like that of a hooligan.

“Kid, you’re quite rich.”One of the young men patted Qin Yu’s shoulder. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Are you giving them money? Why? Are you a tycoon from a foreign country?”Another young man said with a strange tone.

A trace of coldness flashed across Qin Yu’s brows.

“Since you’re so rich, then take out all the money you have.”One of the young men took out a pistol and pressed it against Qin Yu’s head.

Qin Yu looked at them coldly and said, “Looking at your clothes, it doesn’t look like you’re short of money. Moreover, I’m giving them money. It doesn’t seem to be a hindrance to you, right?”

Hearing this, the two young men couldn’t help but look at each other and then burst into laughter.

“Kid, it seems that you don’t know the rules.”A young man sneered.

“If everyone is rich, doesn’t that mean that everyone is poor? I don’t have a sense of superiority, so what do I need money for?”

Qin Yu’s face turned black and he said coldly, “Who gave you the twisted logic?”

“Cut the crap! If you’re not in our circle, no one else is allowed to have money!”The young man shouted.

“Hand over the money, or I’ll shoot!”

Qin Yu’s face was cold. His body shook slightly, and a terrifying internal Qi burst out!

These two young men did not even feel pain before they were instantly turned into a bloody mist!

After killing these two people, Qin Yu did not stay any longer. He got into the car and drove towards the direction of the half-step martial saint.

After driving for less than half an hour, two cars had caught up with them.

They surrounded and blocked Qin Yu and even raised their guns.

“You don’t know death.”Qin Yu’s face could not help but turn cold. He raised his palm and pinched lightly, and those cars were instantly crushed into scrap metal!

After dealing with these few stray fish, Qin Yu increased his speed and headed straight for the position of the half-step martial saint.

Soon, Qin Yu arrived at a huge field.

According to his divine sense, that half-step martial saint was here.

Besides that half-step martial saint, there were also several martial grandmasters and two martial marquis.

Qin Yu walked forward quickly. As soon as he approached, he was stopped by the two martial grandmasters.

“Who are you looking for?”One of the martial grandmasters asked coldly.

Qin Yu pointed at the courtyard and said, “I’m looking for a half-step martial saint here.”

“Half-step martial saint?”The martial grandmaster frowned slightly. “What’s your relationship with Mr. Yao?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth and said, “I’m his friend.”

“Friend? Then... What’s Mr. Yao’s name?”The Martial Grandmaster continued to ask.

Qin Yu gradually lost his patience, and the pressure on his body was suddenly released!

Under this pressure, all the martial grandmasters were instantly unable to move!

“You... who exactly are you...”the martial grandmaster used all his strength to spit out these words.

“Quick, quickly call Mr. Yao, someone is trying to force their way in!”Someone inside shouted.

Qin Yu didn’t say a word. Just as he was about to enter the courtyard, a figure rushed over and appeared in front of Qin Yu in an instant.

“Who has the guts?”A cold voice sounded in Qin Yu’s ear.

Qin Yu raised his head and was about to speak when he froze on the spot.

“Yao... Yao Qing? !”

The person in front of him was actually Yao Qing? The young man who had first followed Qin Yu!
