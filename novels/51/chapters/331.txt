Chapter 332: A Trap Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When she saw this ball of Blue Flame, Taozi’s mouth immediately dropped open!

Ever since she gave birth to the green spiritual fire, she had always been extremely cocky!

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Taozi had never seen anyone with a spiritual fire level above hers!

It wasn’t just Taozi. Many of the alchemists present began to discuss in low voices.

“It’s actually a blue spiritual fire! No wonder he was invited by the Fifth Elder!”

“Even in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, not many people possess a blue spiritual fire.”

“I reckon that other than the First Elder and the Pavilion Master, no one else is above Qin Yu.”

Qin Yu put away the spiritual fire and said with an aloof smile. “Little girl, do you still think that I came in through the back door?”

Taozi’s expression changed again and again. Then, she cupped her hands slightly towards Qin Yu and said, “It’s my fault for being presumptuous.”

The Fifth Elder, who was standing at the side, also seemed to be quite satisfied with this. His face had a smile.

“Alright, everyone can disperse.” The Fifth Elder waved his hand.

Then, he looked at Qin Yu and Taozi and said, “The two of you, follow me.”

The two of them followed behind Fifth Elder and walked out of the hall.

Fifth Elder showed the two of them around the Divine Alchemist Pavilion and briefly introduced the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

Updates by

It included the medicinal herbs storehouse, alchemy room, and so on.

“Fifth Elder, what’s the difference between an ordinary pharmacist and a high-rank pharmacist?” Taozi asked.

Fifth Elder smiled and said, “It’s mainly because of the difference in status. A high-ranking pharmacist is the pharmacist with the highest status besides the elders and the Pavilion Master.”

“Other than that, the offerings are also different. A high-rank pharmacist’s monthly salary is 100,000 yuan. Other than that, there are also three hundred-year-old herbs.”

“As for ordinary pharmacists, their monthly salary is only 30,000 yuan, and there is also one stalk of herbs.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly when he heard this.

He didn’t care much about money. As long as he could obtain the herbs, he was even willing to pay for them.

“There are countless people who come to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion every day to ask for herbs. The two of you have just arrived, so naturally, you have to accept the corresponding tasks,” Fifth Elder said.

Then, Fifth Elder extended his finger and pointed at a small house not far away.

“That is the consultation room. Most of the people who come here to see a doctor are famous people.”

“Of course, you don’t have to be too nervous. No matter how much of a big shot a person is, they have to be humble in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion,” said Fifth Elder proudly.

Just as Fifth Elder said, a martial artist was nothing in the eyes of ordinary people.

However, an alchemist with superb medical skills would be respected by people from all walks of life.

After all, people only had one life. Everyone was afraid of death.

“The two of you can be a team for the time being,” Fifth Elder said.

Taozi hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, Fifth Elder.”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly thought of something.

He looked at Fifth Elder and said, “Fifth Elder, I might not be able to stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion forever.”

The only reason Qin Yu came to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was to get the resources.

As for the alchemy skills of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion, Qin Yu didn’t care at all.

Fifth Elder didn’t seem to be surprised. He smiled and said, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion does not have any requirements to force you to stay. However, once the Divine Alchemist Pavilion summons you, you must come back.”

At this point, Fifth Elder paused for a moment and continued. “Of course, you still have to stay in the Divine Alchemist Pavilion for a month.”

“A month?” Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“Why? Is there any difficulty?” The Fifth Elder asked.

Qin Yu forced a smile and said, “I... I might leave at any time. A month is too long for me.”

What kind of joke was this? There wasn’t much time left for Qin Yu.

Moreover, much could change in a month.

The Fifth Elder seemed to have seen through Qin Yu’s intention. He sized Qin Yu up and down and said somewhat helplessly. “I understand. You mean to come and go as you wish.”

Qin Yu blushed.

He did mean that.

“Tsk, you’re really arrogant.” Fifth Elder rolled her eyes.

“Qin Yu, let me tell you, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion has lectures every month, and they will teach you alchemy techniques.” Fifth Elder reminded.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Fifth Elder, I don’t need alchemy techniques.”

Fifth Elder sighed and said, “Qin Yu, you’re really an exception.”

He pondered for a moment, and then continued. “I can’t make the decision on this matter. When the Pavilion Master comes back, you can tell her yourself.”

Qin Yu hurriedly asked. “When will the Pavilion Master come back?”

Fifth Elder said, “It should be in the next few days.”

“Okay, I’ll have to trouble you.” Qin Yu nodded.

Then, Fifth Elder instructed someone to arrange a residence for Qin Yu.

As a high-ranking pharmacist, Qin Yu’s residence was naturally extraordinary.

Although it wasn’t comparable to the Elder’s residence, the residence was quite comfortable and quiet.

Taozi’s residence happened to be at the side. In comparison, her residence appeared somewhat down and out.

After returning to the residence, Yao Qing said with a face full of amazement. “Mr. Qin, the Divine Alchemist Pavilion is indeed extraordinary. I’ve never seen such dense spiritual energy before.”

Qin Yu also nodded and said, “The Divine Alchemist Pavilion’s spiritual energy is indeed far superior to other places’.”

It was unknown how many herbs the Divine Alchemist Pavilion had in stock. The spiritual energy emitted from their bodies was refreshing.

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He sat cross-legged on the arhat bed and began to absorb the spiritual energy from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

This morning, Qin Yu ran around the Divine Alchemist Pavilion as usual.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s heart suddenly felt a sharp pain.

This sharp pain flashed past, but it was still extremely painful.

“What... What’s going on?” Qin Yu held his chest and squatted down.

He tried to feel his body, but he found nothing abnormal.

This feeling made Qin Yu very uneasy.

He stood there for a long time, and his heart had an indescribable throb.

“Mr. Qin, Third Elder invites you over.” At this moment, an apothecary walked forward and said.

“Third Elder?” Qin Yu frowned.

He didn’t know the Third Elder and had never seen him before. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I see.” Qin Yu didn’t think much about it. He nodded and rushed towards the Elder’s residence.

After stepping into the Third Elder’s residence, Qin Yu discovered that Taozi was also there.

And sitting in front of Taozi was a long-browed old man.

“Greetings, Third Elder.” Qin Yu walked forward and greeted the long-browed old man.

The Third Elder slowly opened his eyes and said, “Someone made an appointment to see a doctor today, but I don’t have the time.”

“I heard that you’re the new pharmacist and possess blue spirit fire. I’ll leave this matter to you,” said the Third Elder.

Qin Yu didn’t think too much about it and immediately nodded in agreement.

The two of them walked out of the Elder’s residence and towards the consultation room.

The consultation room of the Divine Alchemist Pavilion was extremely huge. On the surface, it was open to the public, but in reality, the poor had no chance to step into it.

Qin Yu and Taozi walked into it and sat down. Then, they waited for the patient to come to their door.

“Rumor has it that the Third Elder is wicked and is extremely jealousy-prone. I don’t know if it’s true or not,” said Taozi expressionlessly.

Qin Yu glanced at her and smiled. “Who cares? It has nothing to do with us.”

Taozi glanced at Qin Yu and snorted. “I’m just afraid that he will set us up.”
