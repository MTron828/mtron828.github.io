Chapter 1225: Chapter 1,225, the overbearing deer emperor 

Hearing the pretentious man’s words, the surrounding people didn’t make a sound.

Looking at his confident appearance, Qin Yu was also somewhat uncertain.

He couldn’t see through this pretentious man’s cultivation level at all, so he naturally couldn’t make a conclusion.

Very soon, the first contestant had already walked up to the stage.

His palm slightly shook, and a mist that flickered with divine light condensed in his palm.

A moment later, an ordinary sword landed in his palm.

This sword flickered with seven-colored glazed light, as if it was made of glass from the horizon. It was incomparably beautiful and filled with danger.

He knew that the purple jade origin snake’s entire body was filled with poisonous gas, and it would be injured at any moment, so he did not intend to touch it.

On the stage, deer emperor waved his hand lightly, and the purple jade origin snake seemed to recover its vitality.

Its eyes flickered with an ice-cold black radiance, making people shudder in fear.

“Ha!”

The next second, this contestant roared, and his treasured sword flashed with a long rainbow as it ruthlessly slashed towards the purple jade origin snake!

The Purple Jade origin snake didn’t move at all, allowing his treasured sword to land on its body.

“Chi la...”

The treasured sword slashed across its body, leaving long sparks-like scars!

The treasured sword actually failed to injure it in the slightest. When everyone saw this, they were all astonished!

The pretentious man snorted coldly and said, “Every scale on the purple jade origin snake’s body is incomparably hard. Although that treasured sword is sharp, it will still be somewhat difficult to pierce through these scales.”

“Hiss!”

Right at this moment, the purple jade origin snake spat out a mouthful of purple gas that carried an intense toxicity!

The purple gas instantly enveloped the first contestant, and shrill screams came from the purple gas!

“Ah! ! !”

The purple gas was extremely dense, and no one could clearly see what was happening inside.

Qin Yu was somewhat curious. He activated his desolate God’s eye and pierced through the purple gas, heading straight for the inner scene.

He saw that the contestant in the purple gas was festering, and pieces of flesh fell from his body, dripping with blood. It was a tragic sight.

His divine sense wanted to escape from his body, but the moment it left his body, it was drowned by the poisonous gas and disappeared without a trace.

In just ten minutes, the first contestant was defeated.

The audience sighed. Some people were cheering. The atmosphere was very good.

It seemed that no one cared about the disappearance of a life. Everyone was fulfilling their perverted desires.

“As expected.”The pretentious man snorted coldly.

He put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Kids, watch carefully. How did the Purple Jade origin snake die in my hands? !”

After saying that, his body shot out explosively. It was own how many times he spun in the air before he finally landed steadily in front of the Purple Jade origin snake.

It had to be said that his actions were extremely gorgeous. Although he was pretentious, it brought the atmosphere to a climax.

The pretentious man looked at the Purple Jade origin snake in front of him and said coldly, “It’s just a beast. A beast is just a beast. It can only be slaughtered by others!”

The purple jade origin snake looked at the pretentious man coldly, as if it didn’t know what he was saying.

Everyone was looking at the pretentious man, wanting to see what he had up his sleeves.

Even Qin Yu was curious. Could This pretentious man be some hidden top-notch expert?

At this moment, the pretentious man moved.

He flipped his palm and actually took out a divine flute.

This flute seemed to be an amazing magical artifact, and it flickered in his palm.

Then, the pretentious man placed the flute in front of his mouth and started to blow.

A ghostly sound came out from the flute.

This sound seemed to be able to stir one’s divine sense and tug at one’s heartstrings. It was extremely strange.

At this moment, the purple jade essence snake was also moved. Its originally cold eyes suddenly became somewhat dazed.

“I see.”Qin Yu quickly understood.

This flute was most likely used to summon or control demonic beasts. The pretentious man wanted to use this method to subdue the purple jade essence snake.

It had to be said that this was indeed a good method.

Under this leisurely sound, the Purple Jade origin snake seemed to have lost its offensive power.

A trace of viciousness flashed in the pretentious man’s eyes. Suddenly, a radiance that was like a disc flickered in his hand as he slashed towards the purple jade origin snake’s neck!

The edge of this radiance flickered with a cold light. It was incomparably sharp and seemed as if it was about to cut through the void!

“Die!”The pretentious man roared furiously and shouted repeatedly!

But right at this moment, the purple jade origin snake, who had been at a loss all this time, suddenly recovered its divine sense.

Its enormous snake tail lashed out at an extremely fast speed.

Only a “PA”sound could be heard. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Before everyone could react to what had happened, the posturing man was directly drawn out of the blood mist.

And the radiance that shot out from his hand was easily dodged.

When everyone saw this, they were instantly even more shocked!

They had been paying attention to the purple jade origin snake’s powerful body and its poison, but they didn’t know that the Purple Jade origin snake had extremely fast speed and fierce strength!

Hiss...

For a moment, everyone gasped.

Some of the contestants on the stage even wanted to leave, but they were stopped by the person-in-charge.

“I... I don’t want to go up...”the third-ranked contestant said shakily.

“I originally wanted to rely on my speed to kill the purple jade origin snake, but I didn’t expect the purple jade origin snake to be so fast...”

“My strategy has failed. I want to withdraw!”

After saying this, the third-ranked contestant turned around and was about to run.

At this moment, a purple light shot over from the highest stage!

The light instantly pierced through the contestant’s head, killing him along with his primordial spirit!

When he raised his head, he saw that the person who had attacked was the island Lord, Lu Huang!

This could not help but cause Qin Yu to feel a chill in his heart.

“This island Lord is indeed a ruthless person.”Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice.

He had killed a martial saint with just a raise of his hand. One could see just how powerful this Lu Huang was.

“Since you have participated, no one is allowed to withdraw from the competition,”Lu Huang said indifferently.

His voice was like thunder, coming from all directions, enough to witness his rich spiritual power.
