Chapter 850: Chapter 850, danger lurked everywhere

A trace of ridicule flashed across Tian Xuehong’s face as he looked at the almost crazed white beard.

“Go to hell!”White Beard shouted loudly and charged towards Tian Xuehong!

The power of a half-step martial saint going crazy was unimaginable!

However, Tian Xuehong did not panic at all at this moment.

He only moved his finger, and the ten or so withered bones charged towards white beard!

“Kacha!”

The skeletons raised their hands to meet white beard. At the moment of collision, White Beard was sent flying!

His bones were shattered and half of his arm was broken!

Such a terrifying force caused white beard’s expression to change drastically!

“Could it be... what he said is true!”A trace of fear flashed through White Beard’s heart.

Following that, he got up from the ground and ran!

“If you want to run now, I’m afraid it’s too late,”said Tian Xuehong indifferently.

He raised his hand, and the withered bones immediately rushed towards white beard!

White beard desperately ran towards the entrance, while the withered bones behind him pursued relentlessly!

White Beard’s heart was incomparably terrified, and his forehead was covered in sweat. He rushed all the way to the entrance in an attempt to escape!

Long Mei, who was guarding the entrance, also saw white beard, who was extremely panicked!

“Run, run!”White Beard roared crazily!

But before he could step into the exit, a shriveled claw grabbed white beard!

Then, that terrifying force tore white beard’s body apart. In a short moment, he was torn into pieces! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Seeing this scene, Long Mei was shocked!

He subconsciously took two steps back and exclaimed, “What... What’s going on!”

However, no matter what he said, there was no response.

The surroundings were silent. There was only a trace of the smell of blood.

Long Brows’s expression was extremely ugly. He looked at the exit in horror and subconsciously took two steps back.

“Could it be that Qin Yu...”long brows muttered softly.

He did not dare to think too much and turned around to leave!

Within the slaughtering immortal sect.

Tian Xuehong looked at the white beard that had been torn to shreds on the ground. His eyes were filled with contempt.

“A mere half-step martial saint dares to flaunt his might?”Tian Xuehong said with a hint of ridicule.

Currently, Tian Xuehong controlled the white bone army. If he left this slaughtering immortal sect, no one in the world would be able to stop him!

However, Tian Xuehong did not act rashly.

This was because deep down in his heart, he was also afraid of the existence of Dao Protectors.

“I hope that a nascent soul will be born soon,”Tian Xuehong muttered in a low voice.

...

In the secret realm of Qing city.

Qin Yu was still in a state of seclusion.

He spent two stalks of ten-thousand-year-old herbs to support the pill.

These two stalks of ten-thousand-year-old herbs actually did not allow Qin Yu to step into the perfection realm.

To Qin Yu, this was undoubtedly bad news.

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly and said in a low voice, “Damn it, two ten-thousand-year-old herbs actually can’t raise a small realm...”

If it was someone else, one ten-thousand-year-old herb was enough to step into the Great Circle.

Qin Yu sighed and muttered, “My body’s appetite is really big.”

Although he had some complaints in his heart, Qin Yu couldn’t do anything about it.

He could only silently take out dozens of golden pills and start stuffing them into his mouth.

One golden pill after another was stuffed into his mouth. Qin Yu Ate the golden pills like he was eating candy.

He closed his eyes slightly and continued to increase his internal Qi.

At this moment, an old man appeared at the airport in Qing city.

The old man had a head full of white hair and looked extremely old, but his spirit and spirit were extremely strong.

“Uncle Guan, is there a possibility that Zheng Ke has already betrayed us and gave us false information to trick us into getting caught?”The young man beside him asked in puzzlement.

The old man called Uncle Guan glanced at him and said: “You think there is an ambush in the mystic realm?”

“Mm, I am worried that the top talents of the Yan country have been waiting for us in the mystic realm for a long time.”The young man said in a low voice.

Uncle Guan snorted softly and said: “Such matters are usually handed over to the JINGDU martial arts association to handle. Now that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is still looking for Qin Yu, how would they have the mood to care about us?”

“Moreover, there is no point in doing so. Even if we are caught, we will still not be able to get rid of the Hong Yi sect.”

The young man did not say anything more and only nodded.

No one had expected that Zheng Ke would send the news back to the Hong Yi sect in advance!

And the Uncle Guan who had come this time was also a half-step martial saint, a top-notch person below the martial saint level!

The two of them did not say anything more and immediately rushed towards the secret realm.

At this time, Qin Yu had already been in closed-door cultivation for a full five days.

The martial saint power in his body was also rapidly dissipating, almost becoming dispirited.

On the other side, Long Mei hurried back to the Jingdu martial arts association and told Gu Xinghe what had happened.

“What did you say? !”After hearing Long Mei’s words, Gu Xinghe hurriedly stood up.

“Someone tore apart the white beard with his bare hands?”

Long Mei hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, I saw it with my own eyes! It was a pair of hands with only bones that easily tore apart the white beard’s body...”

Gu Xinghe’s face was gloomy, and he didn’t say anything for a long time.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Could it be that something strange happened in the immortal slaying sect?”

“It’s very possible!”After Gu Xinghe’s reminder, Long Mei also reacted!

In the records of the ancient books, many top sects would mutate after they were exterminated.

Because they were all top-notch people when they were alive, even if they died, it was very likely that they would mutate!

“If that’s really the case... it’s really troublesome,”Gu Xinghe said with narrowed eyes.

Long Mei said in a deep voice, “If that’s really the case, then I’m afraid that Qin Yu has already died in there.”

“No.”Gu Xinghe shook his head.

“I’m afraid that Qin Yu is not in the slaughtering immortal sect at all. He deliberately deceived us to go to the slaughtering immortal sect in order to borrow someone else’s knife to kill us!”

“I’m afraid that the current Qin Yu is hiding somewhere else!”

As the son of Gu Zizhen, Gu Xinghe’s thoughts were extremely rational!

“Go and find him immediately! Find Qin Yu for me!”Gu Xinghe said hurriedly.

Long Mei hurriedly nodded and said, “I’ll give the order right now to get everyone to find Qin Yu!”
