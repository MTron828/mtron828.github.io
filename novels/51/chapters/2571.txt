Chapter 2572: The Beckoning of Soul

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The mortal world was supposed to be the source of power.

Chen Shuang’s actions had indeed affected all the Saints.

“Chen Shuang has disrupted the balance between the two worlds. I’m afraid that even the Seventh Level Divine will also notice the changes here.” Su Xinghe said solemnly.

“The Saint’s world has begun to change. I’m afraid it’s going to wipe out Chen Shuang’s soul.”

Shen Xiao said with a bitter smile.

As she finished speaking, dark clouds gathered densely, like a rolling black curtain enveloping the entire sky, obscuring the sunlight and hope. The dark clouds flickered with a red light like the eyes of a devil staring at Chen Shuang’s Saint Kingdom, causing people to feel a chill rise from the depths of their hearts.

A bolt of divine punishment lightning suddenly descended and struck upon Chen Shuang’s Saint Kingdom.

Terrifying power spread from his Saint Kingdom and killed countless living beings in the surroundings.

Even the hidden Saints, such as Saint Shimoji and others, retreated frantically, afraid that they would be affected by this divine punishment. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As this divine punishment descended, the entire kingdom seemed to dim a little.

This surge of power passed through the hole that blasted and exploded at the location where the coordinates of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect had disappeared.

In an instant, the terrifying soul power of the Saints split into thousands of divine flames. These flames emitted a dazzling light and existed in subtle and intricate patterns, resembling a series of mysterious heraldries.

As these divine flames shuttled through, they seemed to possess their own wills. They rotated the chosen soul and left a mark on the soul’s body.

At this moment, Immortal Crane’s body suddenly trembled as he stared fixedly at the divine flames that filled the sky.

Strands of divine flame continuously enlarged before his pupils, clearly displaying the divine inscription and pattern before him.

Chen Shuang’s kingdom suddenly appeared in his other eye, and the runes on the periphery slowly enlarged for Immortal Crane.

When the two were magnified to the extreme, they were clearly presented in front of him.

The divine flames and the runes of Chen Shuang’s Saint Kingdom were exactly the same.

“Great! Great! There’s such a lunatic among the human race’s Saints. He had sacrificed his Saint’s life to imbue these wandering souls with the imprint of the Saint Kingdom and to lure these people’s souls into the Saint Kingdom! Are you so confident that you won’t benefit others?”

Immortal Crane laughed maniacally, and his long hair danced in the air like a viper.

All the people around him revealed puzzled expressions. This had already involved the Saint’s level, and they could not understand what Immortal Crane was saying at all.

“Hahaha, I’m here to give you a good fortune. If you can occupy Cheng

Shuang’s kingdom and become a Saint, you must remember me, the Immortal Crane.”

Immortal Crane suddenly stretched out one hand.

When he stretched out, in the next moment, a massive palm that covered heaven and earth appeared in the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect almost simultaneously.

Many Saint’s energy also sensed this change.

These thousands of divine flames represented thousands of credentials for entering Chen Shuang’s Kingdom of Saint. They were unparalleled, surpassing any supreme treasure.

“What a lunatic! Are all humans this crazy?”

Ksitigarbha muttered. No one had expected Chen Shuang’s choice.

He had used his own life to bring the souls of the thousands of humans who had died in the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect into his Saint Kingdom.

With a shake of his head, he raised his hand and made the move.

These Saints tacitly did not resist and focused on all the divine flames.

Every time they obtained a divine flame imprint, they could send a person to Chen Shuang’s kingdom.

Even if the Saint could not come personally, if their representatives could enter, it could also obtain sufficient benefits for them.

The accumulation of power in the Kingdom of Saint took hundreds of years.

Even if they could obtain some energy from Chen Shuang’s kingdom, it could also improve the quality of their Saint Kingdom.

“Boom!”

“Do you still want to resist?”

A demon race Saint grabbed dozens of souls in her palm and revealed a sinister smile.

This was the demon race Saint, the Emerald Serpent Witch. Her humanoid demonic form combined a human head with a serpent’s body, and she wore a veil over her human face.

In an instant, she completely wiped out the soul, and the divine flame was extinguished with the destruction of the soul power.

“Hmm?”

It revealed a puzzled expression. In the next moment, a destructive fluctuation suddenly exploded in its hand.

This was the explosion of the Saint’s soul imprint. The energy explosion caused by the self-destruction of the soul formed a violent storm. The energy storm spread out with the utmost powerful being at the center, engulfing everything in its surroundings.

The demon race Saint’s human world clone instantly vanished.

Even if it was just a self-destruction of a trace of Chen Shuang’s soul power, it was enough to destroy the body he had condensed in the human world.

At that moment, in the Saint’s world, the demon race’s Saint Supreme roared angrily. That self-destruction left her no chance at all to snatch the divine flame mark.

“You Ji, that idiot! These divine flame imprints had already taken root and sprouted when they entered the soul. You actually wanted to seize this divine flame by erasing the soul power!’

The other demon race’s Saint Supreme, who was almost involved, cursed out loud, but its hands did not stop grabbing at the divine flames swimming in the air.

These divine flames seemed to have their own thoughts and frantically avoided the clutches of these Saint.

As it contained the power of the Saint Realm, even these Saints had to use all their strength to grab them.

These divine flames chose their souls in the air. In just a few seconds, thousands of divine flames in the air had already chosen their hosts.

Only a few divine flame marks were left in the air, and the others had long fallen into the hands of the various Saint.

In a specific place, Immortal Crane grabbed dozens of divine flames.

Suddenly, a divine light appeared at his throat. It was a thread that was ten thousand times thinner than a hair.

“You’re courting death! You still want to ambush me?”

Immortal Crane’s demonic eyes revealed a strange smile and a violent internal qi erupted from his body.

He blocked the thread with a finger, hooked the thread, and pulled it forward. His two arms immediately fell to the ground.

A bloody mist appeared behind him.

“The Saint of the human race, Shadowless Divine Hand Jue Chen, who is proficient in assassination and concealment. You’re still so rude after so many years.”

Immortal Crane said calmly.

Behind him, a masked figure slowly retreated.

With the human race’s final probe, the battle for the divine flame had come to an end.

Chen Shuang’s divine flame mark could no longer be seen in the air. It had only been a short while.

As these marks took root in the souls of these humans, they seemed to have awakened, and their faces began to reveal different expressions..
