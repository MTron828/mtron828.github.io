2312 One Sword, One World

“No! Don’t act rashly and break the balance!”

The two’s expressions changed drastically.

“Don’t worry. I know what to do.”

Gu Baiyi’s clear and crisp voice sounded.

She took a few more steps forward, and her face immediately revealed a shocked expression. The gaze she looked at Qin Yu suddenly filled with pity.

“What’s wrong? What happened in that area?”

Yan Minglong could not help but ask.

“In that area, there’s a sacred beast, Nightmare.” Gu Baiyi shook his head.

“F*ck, no wonder the three of us couldn’t see the true appearance of that place. There was actually such a thing. This kid might as well die in the hands of the corpse just now.”

Yan Minglong’s expression changed when he heard this.

“Nightmare enjoys playing with people’s dreams. The more their souls collapse, the more delicious they’re. Therefore, almost everyone who encounters Nightmare will be tortured until the soul collapses before being swallowed by it. I’d rather meet a divine beast than this thing.”

Jiang Qingyuan looked fearful.

“It’s a pity that this genius is so talented and will definitely become the top combat strength of our human race if he develops further. I’m wondering if we can save his life if the three of us work together. It’s a pity for such a cultivator to die here.”

“Basically, it’s impossible. Nightmare’s soul is incomparably enormous. Who knows how many souls it has devoured? It can trap our souls instantly the moment we make a move. Back then, our Yan family’s three Tribulation Transcending cultivators encountered a Nightmare beast, but they could merely survive.”

Yan Minglong shook his head.

Nightmare enjoyed toying with people’s souls and eating their souls when they were in intense pain or letting them die at the height of happiness. It was like experiencing the various flavors of life, such as sweet, bitter, sour, and spicy.

In the Holy Region, Nightmare descended upon a sect that had passed down for ten thousand years. In an instant, everyone died in the dream.

Before they died, everyone was still smiling happily.

Qin Yu collapsed on the ground, the black soil strewn with bones.

Suddenly, countless tentacles stretched out and tied Qin Yu’s hands in the air like an octopus.

“Yan Ruoxue” slowly walked up to him and wiped his body.

A piece of Qin Yu’s flesh was cut off, one by one.

After a short while, not a single piece of intact skin was on Qin Yu’s body. Fresh blood dripped from his body onto the ground.

At this moment, Qin Yu seemed not to feel the pain in his body as the pain in his heart suppressed the pain in his body.

His blood began to decrease, and his divine sense gradually dissipated.

Xi Menn walked over silently without any hesitation in his footsteps.

With every step he took, the sword intent on his body rose like bamboo shoots, and his soul completely merged with the sword’s body.

“Ding! Ding! Ding!”

In the ninth level, countless rotten swords seemed to have been summoned and started to tremble slightly.

“Who the hell is this? This person’s cultivation path was rather strange. He actually gave up on comprehending the way and focused on the sword?”

Jiang Qingyuan said with a frown.

The ordinary people sought to merge their souls with the rules of the Path of Heaven after reaching fourth grade, temper themselves with certain rules, and break through to fifth grade.

However, Xi Menn had fused all his soul into his sword, losing the chance to enter fifth grade.

“This is a cultivation method of its own. Using the power of fourth grade to trigger the ninth level’s sword intent. How terrifying is this sword intent?”

Yan Minglong’s sword, beside him, started to tremble. This made him tremendously shocked.

Xi Menn came to Qin Yu’s side, looking at Qin Yu’s body that convulsed constantly.

The world before him was dark, but he closed his eyes and slashed at Qin Yu without hesitation.

“One sword, one world!”

Xi Menn’s sword slashed down, and a magnificent sword energy instantly slashed down from the sky. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In this instant, the entire ninth level of purgatory within a thousand meters turned into daytime.

Within a foot of the sword energy, a world filled with sword intent surrounded it. The sword energy was a world.

That was an attack from a world!

A shrill cry suddenly sounded in the void.

In that space, ripples swirled, and a pair of enormous bloody pupils suddenly appeared in the sky.

The bloody pupils were filled with anger as they stared at Xi Menn.

“The Illusionary Night Bloody Pupil has appeared. This beast has gone mad.”

Gu Baiyi fixed her gaze on the battlefield. The three could not help but be attracted by this battle.

Xi Menn knelt on one knee. He did not even have the strength to stand up.

The sword strike had already drained his essence, qi, and spirit. He did not hold anything back.

In the void, the pupils moved, and a sword of divine sense visible to the naked eye quietly condensed.

“Hah, where are you beast looking at?”

Qin Yu’s face was covered in blood as he gritted his teeth.

Xi Menn’s sword attack had enraged Nightmare, but at the same time, it had brought him back to his senses.

He reversed his hands, allowing the bones to twist and shatter.

His hands were like iron claws as he grabbed the tentacles that bound him. Following that, a voice as cold as hell resounded.

“Soul Torment Mind Technique!”

A terrifying suction force sounded in his sea of consciousness instantly.

The power of divine sense that was like an ocean crazily entered his sea of consciousness. The intense pain of the compression of the soul made Qin Yu’s body tremble uncontrollably.

“He’s absorbing Nightmare’s divine sense. What an idiot! A cultivator of fourth grade like you can absorb my a*s! Nightmare can even toy with the Tribulation Stage cultivator’s soul. How can you absorb its strength?”

Gu Baiyi clenched her fists tightly. She was hoping the two fourth-stage True Saints could escape safely.

The two had shocked her tremendously.

“Not to mention the power of the soul, just the pain of compressing one’s divine sense isn’t something a human can endure. Moreover, there’s no dizziness in the world of dreams. He’ll be tortured by the intense pain until his soul shatters.” Yan Minglong’s voice was somewhat deep. He had faced Nightmare before and experienced the feeling of death better than living.

“Actually, what you’ve said is right. Although I know you’re fake, I can’t refute you!”

Qin Yu laughed maniacally. His body, like a bloody man, was convulsing on the ground.

“Soul Torment Mind Technique! Ultimate!”

In the next moment, Qin Yu circulated the Soul Torment Mind Technique to the limit. The terrifying suction force made the Illusionary Night Bloody Pupil somewhat blurry.

Countless tremendously pure soul power surged into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness. In an instant, the soul power he absorbed was already close to half of his original soul.

Two lakes of water were pulled into a fixed space by a massive force. Immediately, waves surged, and the lake water burst out.

The tremendous pain made Qin Yu roll his eyes. It was no longer a pain that a human could withstand.

The Illusionary Night Bloody Pupil in the void revealed a mocking expression and snapped his fingers in the air.
