Chapter 808: Chapter 808, stepping into the secret realm! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Xia hang pulled Qin Yu to the side and said coldly, “Qin Yu, although I don’t know his background, I can’t believe him!”

“If the Jingdu martial arts association finds out about our relationship, you know better than me what the consequences will be!”

Qin Yu patted Xia Hang’s shoulder and said with a faint smile, “If I say it’s fine, it will definitely be fine. Don’t worry.”

Although Xia Hang was unwilling, he had no choice but to take action now.

“Fortunately, I have already sent them out,”Xia hang thought to himself.

Then, Xia hang looked at Zheng Ke and said coldly, “After you enter, follow my instructions.”

Zheng ke said expressionlessly, “I know.”

After glancing at these words, Xia Hang took Qin Yu and Zheng Ke and walked into the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

At night, the Jingdu martial arts association was extremely quiet.

But normally, there would be people guarding it, but tonight, there was no one.

Obviously, Xia hang had made some preparations.

After passing through the lobby, Xia hang stopped.

“Qin Yu, I Can’t take you in anymore,”Xia Hang said.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay.”

After saying this, Xia hang raised his palm and slapped the top of his head.

With this slap, Xia hang immediately fainted.

“You are quite cautious.”Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but say in a low voice.

Then, Qin Yu continued to move forward with Zheng Ke.

The journey could be said to be unimpeded. Very soon, the two of them arrived at the entrance of the secret realm.

Qin Yu pointed with his finger and said, “It’s here.”

Zheng Ke nodded slightly and walked forward. He raised his palm and slowly searched, as if he was looking for the location of this secret realm.

Soon, his palm stopped at a certain spot in the air.

Then, a ray of light flashed from his palm.

Qin Yu said from the side, “I remember that there is a main mystic realm here, which is equivalent to a door. To open it, you need a spell similar to a key, right? How did you open it?”

Zheng Ke glanced at qin yu and said, “Don’t you know that there is a lock-picking master?”

Qin Yu touched his chin and muttered, “That makes sense.”

Then, Zheng Ke ignored Qin Yu, and the light on his palm became brighter.

Qin Yu’s eyes were fixed on Zheng Ke, trying to figure out something from his technique.

At this moment, Zheng Ke stretched out his palm, and a token that was flashing with a green light appeared in his hand.

Zheng Ke held the jade token and slapped it forward!

In an instant, rays of light flashed in front of the two of them!

The bright light instantly lit up the dark night! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Buzz!”

As a ray of light lit up, a circular entrance appeared in front of the two of them!

“It’s opened,”Zheng Ke said expressionlessly.

Qin Yu glanced at Zheng Ke and said, “You were able to open this mystic realm because of that token in your hand, right?”

Zheng Ke frowned slightly and said, “Does it have anything to do with you?”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “I’m just asking casually.”

“Don’t waste time. Hurry up and go in to save people,”Zheng Ke said coldly.

Qin Yu naturally wouldn’t miss this opportunity. He raised his feet and Strode into the Mystic Realm!

“I’ll wait for you outside,”Zheng Ke said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t have the time to pay attention to Zheng Ke. He did his best and his entire body instantly entered the mystic realm.

Very quickly, a different scene appeared in front of Qin Yu!

Waves of dense qi/spiritual energy assaulted his face!

The surrounding environment made Qin Yu dumbstruck.

Although there were no tall buildings here, there were green mountains and clear waters!

Different from the steel forest in the secular world, this place was more like real nature!

Not far away, there were exquisite buildings and jade buildings that were full of grandeur.

And the lofty mountains filled Qin Yu’s eyes.

Compared to the secret realm of the Hong Yi School, this second secret realm was many times stronger.

This place was like a world, while the secret realm of the Hong Yi School was like a secret base.

“The Jingdu martial arts association indeed controls resources,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

Qin Yu tried to release his spiritual sense to search for Yan Ruoxue’s figure.

But this place was too big. To find a person was like finding a needle in a haystack!

Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed.

“I actually forgot about this.”Qin Yu frowned.

As he moved forward, he was thinking of countermeasures.

“Forget it, I’m already here. Even if I want to explore the second secret realm, it’s good too.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thus, Qin Yu Strode through the world of the second secret realm.

He released his internal Qi to search for Yan Ruoxue’s aura.

After traveling for dozens of miles, Qin Yu finally saw a place full of people.

He saw a young girl dancing by the riverside not far away.

“Eh? It’s actually Marquis Wu?”

Qin Yu tried to sense the young girl’s aura and found that this ordinary young girl was actually in the realm of Marquis Wu!

“It seems like there are many experts hiding in this secret realm.”Qin Yu frowned.

After thinking for a moment, he immediately strode forward and covered the young girl’s nose and mouth from behind.

A huge force immediately spread out.

The young girl tried to struggle, but she couldn’t break free at all.

“Be obedient. I Won’t hurt you. Otherwise, I’ll take your life.”Qin Yu’s cold voice sounded in her ear.

The girl blinked her eyes desperately. Her eyes were full of fear.

Qin Yu slowly let go of her. After making sure that she wouldn’t scream, he let go.

“Don’t worry. I’m just asking you a few questions,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The girl’s big eyes contained tears. It seemed that she was scared.

This couldn’t help but Surprise Qin Yu.

In the outside world, a martial marquis was a famous figure. How could he be so weak?

“Could it be that in the second secret realm, a martial Marquis is Nothing?”Qin Yu thought to himself.

At this moment, the girl’s large eyes were already filled with tears. She looked delicate and pitiful.

However, Qin Yu was not a person who pitied fairies. He coldly asked, “Let me ask you, where are the people from the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? Also, where is Yan Ruoxue locked up?”

The young girl’s willow-like eyebrows slightly furrowed as she said, “Are you talking about that sister who is tied up?”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s pupils suddenly constricted.

“Yes! Tell me where she is immediately!”Qin Yu grabbed the young girl’s arm.

The young girl said with some fear, “She is locked up on the heavenly mystery cliff...”

“Heavenly Mystery Cliff? Take Me there.”Qin Yu anxiously stood up and said.

However, the young girl said in a low voice, “Where are the heavy soldiers guarding? Don’t let anyone get close...”

“I don’t care whether there are heavy soldiers or not. Bring me there immediately!”Qin Yu said angrily.

How could the young girl dare to go against Qin Yu’s intentions? She could only nod her head in fear and said, “Alright... I will bring you there...”

Following that, the young girl led the way in front while Qin Yu followed behind, walking towards the heavenly mystery cliff.
