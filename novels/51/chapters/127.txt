Chapter 128: Chen Xin’s Phone Call Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The scar-faced man fell to the ground and was unable to open his eyes again.

The bloody hole in his chest looked extremely horrifying.

Qin Yu stood in front of the scar-faced man and didn’t even feel a trace of pity.

Qin Yu didn’t know when it started, but he no longer felt fear.

He bent down and rubbed the scar-faced man’s body.

Sure enough, there really was a hundred-year-old herb king hidden on him.

“It seems that he didn’t lie to me,” Qin Yu whispered.

Then, Qin Yu looked at the scarred man’s follower and grinned. “Do you want to avenge him?”

The follower was stunned, and then said in surprise, “You... plan to let me go?”

“Mr. Qin, you must not let him go!” Lu Shuming hurriedly shouted.

“If he leaves, he will definitely come for revenge in the future!”

Qin Yu sized up this follower, waved his hand, and said, “I won’t kill you. As for revenge... I’ll wait for you guys.”

This organization had abundant herbs, so Qin Yu didn’t want to miss out on them.

This follower gritted his teeth, then quickly left by breaking the window and escaping!

“Cough cough.” At this moment, Wu Hongchang also got up from the ground.

He still acted like a big shot and walked in front of Qin Yu in an imposing manner.

“Qin Yu, how can you let him go? If he leaves, what will happen if he comes to find trouble with us in the future?” Wu Hongchang berated loudly.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and couldn’t help but sneer. “If it weren’t for me, you would have already died.”

“So what? You’re wrong to let him go!” Wu Hongchang rebuked loudly.

“How about this? I’ll keep this stalk of herb as an apology.” Then, Wu Hongchang looked at the herb in Qin Yu’s hand and said.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

He had seen thick-skinned people, but he had never seen such thick-skinned people.

“You want it?” Qin Yu shook the stalk of herbs and asked.

Wu Hongchang coughed awkwardly and said, “Seeing that you sincerely admitting your mistake, I will temporarily forgive you.”

After saying that, Wu Hongchang reached out his hand to grab Qin Yu’s stalk of herb.

But very soon, Wu Hongchang’s expression changed!

His hand hadn’t even touched the herb when Qin Yu grabbed his wrist.

“You’re actually going to take it? You’re shameless and unappreciative even at your old age” Qin Yu said coldly.

Panic flashed across Wu Hongchang’s expression. He hurriedly said, “Qin Yu, I’m an elder. What do you want to do?!”

“Elder? You think you’re worthy of that title?” After saying that, Qin Yu waved his hand and slapped Wu Hongchang’s face!

Wu Hongchang’s entire body was sent flying, and he crashed into the wall!

The wall was instantly covered with dense cracks, and Wu Hongchang couldn’t stop spatting blood!

“You shameless thing.” Qin Yu looked at Wu Hongchang coldly and said.

The oom was silent. No one dared to blame Qin Yu.

“Mr. Lu, this kid actually dared to attack me...” Wu Hongchang looked at Lu Shuming with difficulty as he complained.

Lu Shuming sneered and said, “Wu Hongchang, you can scram. From today onwards, you are no longer a member of the Lu family.”

Wu Hongchang’s expression changed. He could barely believe that these words came from Lu Shuming’s mouth!

One had to know that before this, Lu Shuming was extremely respectful to Wu Hongchang!

“Mr. Lu, Mr. Wu has worked hard for the Lu family for so many years. Isn’t it inappropriate for you to chase him away like this?”

“Yes, Mr. Lu. If he leaves, we won’t be willing to stay either.”

Hearing everyone’s words, Lu Shuming couldn’t help but laugh out loud. “Alright, then all of you can scram. From today onwards, you have nothing to do with the Lu family anymore!”

This time, everyone was stunned.

“Mr. Lu, I... I was just joking.” Some people gave in.

However, Lu Shuming was already extremely disappointed in them and wouldn’t give them another chance.

“Mr. Qin, let’s go.” Then, Lu Shuming looked at Qin Yu respectfully.

Qin Yu nodded and the two of them walked out of the room together.

After getting into the car, Lu Shuming sighed. “Mr. Qin, I was wrong to underestimate you before. From today onward, the Lu family will treat you as a distinguished guest.”

“Just give me the money.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

“Don’t worry, I’ll send the contract to you tomorrow,” Lu Shuming said quickly.

The car quickly sent Qin Yu back to the hotel. After experiencing this, Qin Yu was more confident in his own strength.

“The Foundation Establishment Stage really lives up to its reputation,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

In terms of martial arts, a Foundation Establishment Stage practitioner could at most be considered at the level of an Inner Strength Master Hands. However, when faced with a so-called Inner Strength Past Master, Qin Yu was able to defeat him with ease.

Spiritual power indeed wasn’t something that Inner Strength could compare to.

The next day, Qin Yu wasn’t in a hurry to return to Jiangcheng because he still had to wait for Lu Shuming to deliver the contract.

Therefore, Qin Yu looked at Yao Qing and said, “Gobuy me a car. It’s more convenient to have a car.”

Yao Qing was stunned and quickly asked, “Okay, what kind of car do you want to buy?”

“I don’t know much about cars. It’s up to you,” said Qin Yu.

Yao Qing continued to ask, “Then do you have any requests?”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “It should have high-speed performance and be low key.”

As for the rest, Qin Yu didn’t consider them. After all, Qin Yu was alone now.

“Okay, I understand.” Yao Qing nodded.

He took Qin Yu’s bank card and left the hotel.

About an hour later, the roar of an engine came from downstairs.

When Qin Yu went downstairs, he found a black Audi parked downstairs.

“It’s an Audi RS7, which is fast and low-profile,” Yao Qing said with a smile.

Qin Yu looked at it carefully. The car indeed looked low-profile.

“How much did you spend?” Qin Yu asked casually.

Yao Qing smiled and said, “A total of 2.1 million.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Yu didn’t expect this because from the looks of it, it didn’t seem expensive.

After that, Qin Yu drove around for a test drive and felt that it wasn’t bad.

At night, Qin Yu and Yao Qing found a place to have dinner. During the meal, Qin Yu casually glanced at the news.

A news headline appeared in front of his eyes.

“Overseas fugitive Hong Quan was killed in South City yesterday.”

After clicking on the link, he discovered that Hong Quan was the scarred man.

The news was full of praises for Qin Yu, but it didn’t reveal Qin Yu’s identity. Instead, they called him a mysterious hero.

“How fast.” Qin Yu shook his head.

After eating, the two of them were ready to return to the hotel.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the phone and saw that the caller was an unfamiliar number.

“Hello, who is this?” Qin Yu picked up the phone.

“I’m Chen Xin, Sun Ying’s classmate. Do you still remember me?” A girl’s voice came from the other end.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. “What’s the matter?”
