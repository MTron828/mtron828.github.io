Chapter 719: The Divine Dragon Mark Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Seeing this figure, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned cold.

It was none other than the Heaven Swallowing Python.

He stood in front of Qin Yu and said condescendingly, “Are you still planning to run? Who will come to save you this time?”

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and sneered. “You b*stard, that slap actually didn’t kill you last time!”

The Heaven Swallowing Python wasn’t angry at all. It said coldly, “Without those two corpses, how are you going to deal with me?”

As it spoke, waves of internal qi burst out from the body of the Heaven Swallowing Python.

Qin Yu knew that this big battle was inevitable. Therefore, he didn’t dare to neglect it and immediately adjusted his internal qi to the maximum.

At the same time, the Divine Dragon Power flashed out from between Qin Yu’s eyebrows.

A red mark flashed between his brows.

“Come.” Just as Qin Yu was about to make a move, a trace of panic flashed across the Heaven Swallowing Python’s face!

He subconsciously took two steps back, and his black pupils were filled with fear.

Seeing the Heaven Swallowing Python’s appearance, Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown.

What was going on? Why did the Heaven Swallowing Python, which was showing off a moment ago, become like this?

Qin Yu stared at the eyes of the Heaven Swallowing Python and soon sensed something.

The eyes of the Heaven Swallowing Python had been staring at the Divine Dragon Mark between Qin Yu’s eyebrows!

In other words, this Divine Dragon Mark scared the Heaven Swallowing Python away!

“Oh, you are a demon beast, so you are naturally afraid of the Divine Dragon, right?” Qin Yu seemed to have guessed something.

As he spoke, Qin Yu walked towards the Heaven Swallowing Python step by step.

The anguish on the face of the Heaven Swallowing Python became more and more intense.

As Qin Yu approached, his face became somewhat pale, and he even sat down on the ground! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Hahaha!” Qin Yu couldn’t help but burst into laughter when he saw the situation.

“Is that all you have? It seems that the fear of the divine dragon is engraved in your bones and bloodline.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes and said.

The Heaven Swallowing Python struggled to stand up from the ground. He gritted his teeth and said, “Qin Yu, you won’t be arrogant for too long. So what if it’s the Divine Dragon Power?”

“Oh, is that so?” Qin Yu sneered repeatedly.

“Then you can come and try!” Qin Yu shouted loudly.

The Heaven Swallowing Python’s body trembled. It seemed that it wanted to make a move, but its body didn’t listen to its command.

“Just you wait!” The Heaven Swallowing Python said while gnashing its teeth.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Get lost!”

The Heaven Swallowing Python clenched its teeth and turned around to run.

This made Qin Yu heave a sigh of relief.

“Damn, luckily, I have the Divine Dragon Power...” Qin Yu patted his chest.

He wiped the sweat on his forehead and said in a low voice, “Relying on the Divine Dragon Power isn’t a long-term solution. The Heaven Swallowing Python will be able to overcome this psychological pressure sooner or later.”

The so-called bloodline suppression was simply the fear that was engraved in the genes. All the fear was psychological.

Once the Heaven Swallowing Python overcame the psychological pressure, then Qin Yu would still be unable to escape.

“I have to increase my strength as soon as possible,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

...

Qin Yu, who had originally planned to leave the martial arts academy, suddenly changed his mind.

That night, he stood alone in the square and released his spiritual sense, in an attempt to find the connection with the Mystic Realm again.

The martial arts academy wasn’t as desolate as Qing City, so finding this connection was much more difficult than before.

Sweat continuously broke out on his forehead. His entire mind was immersed in it.

This feeling was extremely unique. It was like a large spiritual sense hand groping aimlessly, relying on the spiritual sense to grasp that nonchalant connection.

“Found it!”

After an unknown amount of time, Qin Yu finally grasped a thread-like connection!

He suddenly opened his eyes and followed this thread of connection while taking large strides forward.

As the feeling grew stronger, Qin Yu had already walked hundreds of meters and finally stopped in a courtyard.

The courtyard door was tightly shut.

The surroundings were even more deserted and no one could be seen.

Qin Yu looked at the door in front of him and said in a low voice, “According to my previous experience in Qing City, there should be a Mystic Realm hidden here.”

Then, Qin Yu reached out his hand and touched the door.

Boom!

At the moment of contact, an extremely powerful force erupted and directly sent Qin Yu flying!

That terrifying power was like a landslide. Even Qin Yu’s physical body was shaken until he spat out blood.

“What a powerful force!” Qin Yu climbed up from the ground.

He stared at the door in front of him and said in a low voice, “Could Ruoxue be locked in this Mystic Realm...”

This was the only Mystic Realm Qin Yu had found in the martial arts academy. However, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association controlled countless Mystic Realms, so it definitely wasn’t an easy task to find the Mystic Realm that imprisoned Yan Ruoxue.

Qin Yu took a deep breath. He wanted to forcefully break open this door, but if he did so, it would definitely alarm the people of the Martial Arts Association.

“It’s unrealistic to forcefully open this door.” Qin Yu was in a dilemma.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to retreat temporarily and discuss it with the man with the mustache the next day.

Just as Qin Yu turned around, he realized that Granny Qin was already standing behind him.

Her eyes stared coldly at Qin Yu.

The cold and terrifying internal qi on her body caused the temperature to drop by a few degrees.

Their eyes met, and the atmosphere suddenly became quite stiff.

“Who told you to come here?” Granny Qin said coldly.

Qin Yu frowned. He didn’t want to alert the enemy, so he lied, “I can’t sleep. What’s wrong with coming out for a walk?”

“Coming out for a walk?” Granny Qin sneered.

“Do you take me for a fool?”

“Believe it or not.” Qin Yu snorted and turned to leave.

However, at this time, Granny Qin stretched out her shriveled claw-like palm and blocked Qin Yu’s path.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “What are you doing?”

Granny Qin said with a nonchalant smile, “Qin Yu, you don’t think that with the intervention of the authorities, I won’t dare to kill you, right?”

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks and frowned slightly.

Just as Granny Qin had said, the authorities had already sent people to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association in the past few days to intervene.

This caused the Jingdu Martial Arts Association dare not to do anything.

“This kind of official intervention has already appeared three times. This is the fourth time,” Granny Qin said nonchalantly.

“They will stay here for at most a week. After a week, everything will be peaceful.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “So?”

“So?” Granny Qin grinned, revealing her yellow teeth.

“So, you only have one week left to live. Cherish it.”

Qin Yu snorted. He didn’t say anything and turned to leave.

At this moment, Granny Qin suddenly reached out her palm and grabbed Qin Yu’s head!
