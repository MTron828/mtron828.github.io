2112 Hitting a Roadblock

Of course, Qin Yu understood that in the great era, many new Saints would appear in the various aristocratic families. Although it was indeed bad news for Qin Yu, he was already prepared for it in his heart, so he did not panic at all.

“The Yao family’s Holy Son fails to do it and let the elders do it? How embarrassing!” Qin Yu mocked and said.

However, this elder of the Yao family did not fall for it. Instead, he said with a dark face, “As the saying goes, fight for the right cause. Qin Yu, you have done many evil things and offended too many people, so you will surely die!”

“Then let’s see who will ultimately win,” Qin Yu sneered and said.

“Little b*stard, let’s see how long you can be smug!” The more the Yao family elder spoke, the more agitated he became. His entire face began to tremble.

Li Shen, who was by the side, frowned slightly. A hint of displeasure flashed across his somewhat aged face.

“Clamor is not allowed in the Alchemy Tower,” Li Shen said coldly.

At this moment, the Yao family elder was in a fit of anger. He did not know Li Shen and immediately shouted, “Who do you think you are? Do you have the right to shout at me? Who do you think you are?”

Li Shen’s turbid eyes narrowed slightly. He said coldly, “Get out of Alchemist Association immediately.”

“I think you’re courting death!” The Yao family elder was already full of anger but could not take action against Qin Yu. Thus he immediately redirected his anger toward Li Shen.

With a wave of his hand, he grasped the light and then ruthlessly smashed toward Li Shen!

The light burst out with surging battle intent and arrived in front of Li Shen almost instantly!

Just as the fist was about to hit Li Shen, suddenly, a powerful force emitted from Li Shen’s body. It was powerful and sharp, instantly bouncing the Yao family elder’s fist back and sending him flying.

The Yao family elder looked at Li Shen in shock. He had never expected Li Shen to have such powerful strength. His face was full of fear. Then he looked at Qin Yu, and his face revealed an expression intertwined with anger and fear.

Li Shen looked at the Yao family elder who was sent flying and said indifferently, “The Alchemist Association isn’t a place for childish fighting. If you don’t understand the rules, please leave.”

Everyone looked at Li Shen in shock. They did not expect this ordinary-looking old man to have such powerful strength. Even the Yao family’s elder was not his match!

Qin Yu was also tremendously shocked. He knew Li Shen’s strength was terrifying, but he did not expect it to be so terrifying!

As expected, the strength of a top-notch alchemist was definitely not weak!

The Yao family elder got up from the ground. He narrowed his eyes and said coldly, “Who are you?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“You don’t know? He’s the Vice President of the Alchemist Association, Li Shen! Idiot! You came to Alchemist Association to ask for medicine and attacked the Vice President? Hahaha, it’s so funny!” Jue Wu, by the side, laughed crazily.

“You… You’re President Li? I’m… I’m really sorry. I was ignorant and failed to recognize somebody important. I hope President Li can forgive me…” Elder Yao braced himself and said.

But Li Shen said coldly, “Get out of Alchemist Association immediately!”

Elder Yao was in a state of great panic and unease. He had come here this time to seek medicine for the Yao family’s new Saint, who was at the critical moment of his breakthrough now. If he could not obtain the medicinal herbs from the Alchemist Association, most probably he would fail!

If the Yao family knew he had offended President Li, they would definitely be furious!

“President Li, I have come on behalf of the Yao family. I have also come for the important matters of the Yao family. President Li, please prioritize the overall situation…”

Li Shen sneered and said, “Don’t use the Yao family to pressure me. The Alchemist Association isn’t afraid of anyone.”

After saying this, Li Shen turned around and left, completely ignoring the pleading of the Yao family elder.

“Elder Yao, it seems it’s still uncertain whether your Yao family’s new Saint can break through,” Qin Yu said with an evil smile.

Elder Yao was so angry that he was trembling. Since he could not do anything to Li Shen, he held a grudge against Qin Yu.

“Little b*stard, you’ll surely die!” Elder Yao clenched his teeth tightly and was so angry that he almost fainted.

Qin Yu ignored him. He followed Li Shen and walked toward Alchemist Association’s main entrance.

At the gate, someone heard of Li Shen’s identity and hurried over.

“President Li, I’m the head of the Sunn family. I’ve traveled tens of thousands of li to come here. My youngest son is seriously ill. As long as President Li is willing to help, my Sunn family is willing to pay one billion spirit coins and three ten-thousand-year-old Divine Medicine!”

“President Li, I come from the Purple Firmament Sect. Currently, several elders in the Purple Firmament Sect are unable to cultivate. As long as President Li is willing to help, my Purple Firmament Sect is willing to offer an ancient Divine Stone!”

“President Li, I…”

But Li Shen did not stop in his track and did not even pay attention to them.

Obviously, Li Shen had become accustomed to this kind of scene.

His body was surrounded by a faint light, making everyone unable to get close. When these people saw Li Shen ignore them, they began to plead with Qin Yu and the others.

“Mister, please plead with President Li. I will definitely reward you handsomely after this!”

“Mister, you’re probably from the Alchemist Association. Please help me!”

“Mr. Qin, I…”

Qin Yu sighed slightly. Although he felt pity for them deep down, he could not save so many people.

Soon, they arrived at the main entrance of the Alchemist Association. The door was several thousand feet tall and incredibly imposing. Several ancient totems of alchemy were carved on the door, making it look tremendously mysterious and solemn.

The doors of the Alchemist Association slowly closed, and the clamor behind them gradually dissipated.

The three stepped into this mysterious and solemn place, and a unique internal qi rushed toward them. It was the fragrance of herbs, spiritual herbs, and pills mixed together, making people feel a quiet and mysterious atmosphere as soon as they entered.

The interior architectures of the Alchemist Association were extremely simple and unadorned as if they had endured the baptism of countless years.

In the huge hall, various alchemy equipment was scattered yet in an orderly manner. There was no lack of rare and ancient alchemy equipment that emitted a mysterious light.

Around the hall, stacks of bookshelves were full of various alchemy books, many of which were precious rare alchemy manuals.

Between the bookshelves, there were many unknown and rare herbs. They were carefully preserved in transparent enclosures, emitting an emerald-green radiance.

In the deepest part of the hall, there was a gigantic alchemy furnace. The furnace was engraved with ancient runes, and each rune seemed to contain endless power. The hot air emanating from the furnace opening gave one a sense of powerful and fiery force.

Although no human sound was in the hall, a strong life force was flowing within. It was as if this place itself was a tremendous life form. Every corner and every wooden beam emitted an ancient and mysterious internal qi.

At the side of the hall was a small room. That was the resting room for alchemists. Inside the room, there were comfortable beds and some daily necessities. It was apparent that the Alchemist Association valued their alchemists greatly.
