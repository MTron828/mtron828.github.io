Chapter 394: Fang Yue’s Conditions Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The Guan Jiarong mentioned by Jiang Gu and the person Qin Yu saw seemed like different people.

As expected, villains usually looked kind-hearted.

“This old man actually dares to lie to me.” Qin Yu narrowed his eyes, and coldness flashed across his face.

Jiang Gu waved his hand and said, “Forget it. After all, he is the president of the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association. Who would be willing to offend him?”

Qin Yu glanced at Jiang Gu and said, “It is because of everyone’s tolerance and indulgence toward him that he is so unrestrained.”

“This time, I will make him pay the price!”

After saying that, Qin Yu looked at Jiang Gu and said, “Spread the word that if the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association doesn’t compensate my spiritual energy within half a month, they will bear the consequences.”

Jiang Gu frowned and said, “Mr. Qin, do you really want to do that? After all, he is the president of the Martial Arts Association...”

“So what?” Qin Yu scolded coldly.

“If I have to endure it because he is the president of the Martial Arts Association, then what’s the difference between me and those who flatter the wealthy and oppress the underprivileged?”

Qin Yu was fed up with this kind of situation.

Jiang Gu could only nod and say, “Alright, Mr. Qin, I understand.”

After sending Jiang Gu away, Qin Yu began to plan his next journey.

The purpose of Qin Yu’s return to Chuzhou this time was the battlefield he saw in the provincial capital last time.

The density of the dark energy there was beyond imagination. To Qin Yu, it was a good place for cultivation.

Right now, Qin Yu couldn’t advance any further by relying on spiritual energy, so Qin Yu set his sights on dark energy.

“It would be great if I could have a few Inner Strength Grandmasters,” Qin Yu thought to himself while stroking his chin.

The effect of Qin Yu swallowing the two peak Inner Strength Grandmasters of the Yan family was indeed beyond imagination.

It could even be said that Qin Yu only needed ten Inner Strength Grandmasters to have a chance to step into the Enlightenment Stage! In other words, he would be an Inner Strength Grandmaster!

As long as he stepped into the Enlightenment Stage, Qin Yu wouldn’t be afraid of any Inner Strength Grandmaster in the world!

Regardless of whether he was from an aristocratic family or a disciple of a top-notch martial artist, they wouldn’t be worth mentioning.

This was the confidence of someone with a chaotic body!

Even so, how could it be so easy to find an Inner Strength Grandmaster?

After thinking for a moment, Qin Yu prepared to leave for the provincial capital the next day.

At night, Qin Yu laid on his bed while scrolling through his phone, just like the other youngsters.

Of course, what Qin Yu was scrolling through wasn’t a short video, but a martial arts forum.

At eight o’clock in the evening, Qin Yu was just about to put down his phone and go to sleep.

At this moment, a piece of news suddenly broke out on the martial arts forum.

The battlefield from hundreds of years ago had been excavated! The various aristocratic families were preparing to join forces to search for treasures!

And this so-called battlefield was precisely the village that Qin Yu had discovered in the provincial capital!

Upon seeing this news, Qin Yu suddenly sat up from his bed.

“I’ve actually been discovered?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but have an ugly expression on his face.

The various aristocratic families wanting to join forces to go definitely wasn’t good news for Qin Yu!

Especially since it involved the Yan family! With the influence of the Yan family, it was very likely that they would join forces and attack Qin Yu!

“Sorry for the trouble.” Qin Yu’s expression was dark, and he felt a little uneasy inside.

However, if he gave up just like that, Qin Yu really couldn’t bear to leave.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu still decided to take the risk and go.

If he could even forcefully break through the stairway to heaven, what was there to be afraid of?

Furthermore, Qin Yu had the control of the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique. If anything really happened, he would be able to escape.

That night, Qin Yu didn’t sleep very well.

The next morning, Qin Yu had just woken up when there was a knock on the door.

As the door opened, Qin Yu saw a familiar figure: Fang Yue.

“Miss Fang?” Qin Yu looked at Fang Yue in surprise.

Fang Yue smiled lightly. “Greetings, Mr. Qin.”

Qin Yu hurriedly welcomed Fang Yue into the room and ordered, “Taozi, go and get Miss Fang a glass of water.”

Taozi stared at Fang Yue with a hint of envy in her eyes.

“What are you looking at? Go make a pot of tea.” Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

After sending Taozi away, Fang Yue smiled nonchalantly and said, “Mr. Qin’s name has taken the world by storm recently.”

“What do you mean by taking the world by storm? Don’t make fun of me.” Qin Yu waved his hand.

Fang Yue covered her mouth and laughed softly. “Mr. Qin, you’re too modest. You can even forcefully pass the stairway to heaven. You are the first person in history.”

This was the truth. After all, even Jiang He had failed.

“Miss Fang, why are you looking for me?” Qin Yu asked.

Fang Yue said jokingly, “Can’t I look for you if I have nothing to do?”

“Let’s get down to business,” Qin Yu waved his hand and said.

Fang Yue said seriously, “Mr. Qin, don’t you know that Chuzhou has excavated a battlefield?”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then he nodded and said, “To tell you the truth, I’m planning to set off.”

“Do you know that the Yan family has also sent people?” Fang Yue said with slight surprise.

Qin Yu said with a wry smile, “So what if I know? This battlefield is extremely important to me. No matter what, I have to go there.”

Hearing that, Fang Yue said indifferently, “Mr. Qin, I do have a way to protect your safety.”

“Oh really?” Qin Yu was slightly surprised.

Fang Yue stretched out her hand, and a hat appeared in her hand.

This hat looked quite extraordinary. Under the sunlight, it flickered with a dim green light.

“Where did the green hat come from?” Qin Yu underestimated it.

Fang Yue didn’t explain, but put the hat on her head.

The moment the hat was put on, Fang Yue’s face was covered by a thick fog.

Under this thick fog, Qin Yu couldn’t even see Fang Yue’s face!

“What... What is this thing?” Qin Yu immediately turned pale with fright!

Fang Yue said, “This is a divine artifact that I obtained by chance from the auction. It might just be useful to you.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t care less whether it was green or not. He took the hat and said with some excitement, “This thing is too useful to me!”

Fang Yue said indifferently, “Mr. Qin, I can give you this hat, but I have two conditions.”

“Miss Fang, please go ahead,” Qin Yu said bluntly.

Fang Yue said with a nonchalant smile, “First, if you really get any treasures on the battlefield, I want half.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Sure, I can give it to you,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

After all, Qin Yu’s goal was to break through.

“The second condition...” At this point, Fang Yue’s expression suddenly darkened.

She said coldly, “I want you to help me kill two people.”
