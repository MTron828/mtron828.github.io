1841 Borrowing the Power of Demon-slaying Peak

Following that, Chang Mang began to cry loudly. His face was full of grief, and he cried so much that he couldn’t speak.

Qin Yu frowned. He patted Chang Mang’s shoulder and said, “Who is it?”

“Do you still remember Zhuang Teng?” Chang Mang sobbed and said.

“Zhuang Teng?” Qin Yu was stunned. He remembered this young master from an aristocratic family in Jingdu. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Although this person was a famous young master in Jingdu, he was an honest and refined person who never made an enemy of anyone.

!!

Back then, Zhuang Teng and Chu Heng were a famous team of two in Jingdu. They had helped Qin Yu a lot.

“You mean him?” Qin Yu was speechless.

“Yes, it’s Zhuang Teng.” Chang Mang cried even more sorrowfully.

This rugged man was crying like a child.

“I didn’t protect him well. I couldn’t save him. He offended the aristocratic family of the Crimson Moon Continent, but I’m no match for them at all…” Chang Mang said with a trembling voice.

At this point, Chang Mang clenched his fists and said with a face full of grief and resentment, “I was almost there, just a bit more. If I were given a little bit more chance, I could definitely save Zhuang Teng…”

Qin Yu had mixed feelings. It was always difficult to let go of an old friend’s demise.

Besides Zhuang Teng, who could guarantee no one else had died in Holy Region?

For a moment, Qin Yu was full of emotion and felt a little sad.

“It’s alright. Don’t think so much. This kind of thing… You’re not to be blamed. We’ll find everyone back in the future.” Qin Yu patted Chang Mang’s shoulder and consoled him softly.

Perhaps it was because Chang Mang was drunk or felt too guilty. He chattered endlessly agonizingly beside Qin Yu.

After some time, Chang Mang finally fell asleep.

Looking at Chang Mang, who was sleeping soundly, Qin Yu had mixed feelings.

Holy Region had always been a very dangerous place. In the past few years, no one knew if their old friends were still around or what they had experienced.

Sitting beside Chang Mang, Qin Yu accompanied him quietly.

He knew very well that he should always act rationally at all times. Only with enough strength could he keep and protect the people around him.

While Chang Mang was sleeping soundly, Qin Yu was planning how to rescue Jue Wu.

Qin Yu had extremely complicated feelings toward Jue Wu. He would never allow anything to happen to Jue Wu.

This time, Qin Yu’s target was not just Li Yingying, but the entire Tong family.

Either he didn’t make a move, or he would uproot the Tong family as well!

They had to pay the price in blood for the mistakes they made!

Qin Yu didn’t sleep for the whole night.

He sat there with a grave expression, and countless thoughts flashed through his mind.

The following morning, Chang Mang finally woke up.

He rubbed his head and looked at Qin Yu. He then stood up and said with a smile, “Qin Yu, I drank too much last night. I don’t remember anything. I…”

“Say no more.” Qin Yu interrupted Chang Mang’s words.

Qin Yu then looked at Chang Mang and said in a deep voice, “I’m going to save a person.”

“Save a person? Who’s the person?” Chang Mang was stunned.

“Someone important,” Qin Yu said coldly. “Someone very important to me.”

“Then cut the crap. Let’s go now.” Without saying anything else, Chang Mang stood up and prepared to leave.

“No,” Qin Yu shook his head and said. “We have to plan this carefully. Once we make a move, we must ensure 100% success.”

“Do whatever you say!” Chang Mang hurriedly nodded and said.

“Firstly, you follow me to the major cave abodes of Demon-slaying Peak and tell them I want to borrow their points. I guarantee I’ll pay them back,” Qin Yu said.

Upon hearing this, Chang Mang waved his hand and said, “This is just a small matter. Isn’t it easy? I’ll just go and gather them, and it’s done.”

“Oh?” Qin Yu was stunned. He then frowned and said, “That’s not good, right?”

“There’s nothing wrong about it. I’ll go call them one by one now. You just wait here!” Chang Mang patted his chest and said.

After saying this, Chang Mang turned around and was about to leave.

At this moment, Qin Yu pulled Chang Mang back.

He took out the loudspeaker and handed it to Chang Mang, saying, “Use this. You don’t have to call them one by one.”

Qin Yu then told Chang Mang how to use the loudspeaker.

Chang Mang took the loudspeaker and shouted according to Qin Yu’s method.

Chang Mang’s method of calling for help was very simple and crude, which made Qin Yu blush.

“You… Does it work?” Qin Yu said with embarrassment.

“Why not?” Chang Mang chuckled. “The people of Demon-slaying Peak respect strength. They now respect me.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and felt it made sense. With Chang Mang’s talent, he could probably be ranked in the top three in the entire Demon-slaying Peak.

After half an hour or so, people arrived at Chang Mang’s cave abode one after another.

They seemed to have very good relationship with Chang Mang. Each of them was joking with him.

On the contrary, Qin Yu, who had arrived earlier, became an outsider. Although they would greet Qin Yu, he was still a stranger to them.

Of course, Qin Yu didn’t care. He just sat by the side and waited quietly for the others to arrive. No expression could be seen on his face.

Seeing more and more people coming, Qin Yu was slightly relieved.

About an hour later, most of the people in Demon-slaying Peak had arrived.

Of course, the peak master and Jiu Xiao did not come. With their status, they would not be so easily summoned.

“Qin Yu, long time no see.” At this moment, Xiaobai walked over from the side.

“Long time no see,” Qin Yu said with a smile.

“Have you stepped into the Reversion Void Stage?” Xiaobai glanced at Qin Yu and couldn’t help but ask in surprise.

“I was lucky,” Qin Yu said.

“Such speed is truly something I envy,” Xiaobai said with emotion.

“Xiaobai, let’s not be so polite,” Qin Yu sighed and said.

Xiaobai laughed and then said seriously, “About Jue Wu… You should have heard about it by now. ”

At the mention of Jue Wu, Qin Yu’s face suddenly became a little cold.

“Mmm. I’ve called everyone over this time to discuss Jue Wu’s matter,” he said with a gloomy face.

Xiaobai seemed to have expected this. He patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “If you need any help, just let me know.”

“Many thanks.” Qin Yu bowed slightly to express his gratitude.

“Chang Mang, what’s the matter?” someone asked.

Chang Mang pulled Qin Yu to his side and said with a smile, “It’s Qin Yu who’s looking for you guys.”

Everyone turned their gazes to Qin Yu.

“Qin Yu,” someone took the lead to speak. “You called us here for Jue Wu, right?”
