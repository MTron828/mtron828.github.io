2105 Defeated!

Jue Wu looked incomparably anxious. She even wanted to charge into the battlefield. However, the aftershock of this battle was too terrifying. The pressure emitted alone made it impossible for others to take even half a step forward! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“No one would dare to jump to conclusions for a battle of this scale until the very last moment,” Teng Zixu shook his head and said.

Saintess Gu walked over with a smile and comforted her, “You should know Qin Yu’s strength better than us. Moreover, he had Wu Ji’s divine robe and the Mysterious Heavenly Mirror. They should be able to protect him. Furthermore, he had already comprehended Wu Ji’s Great Destruction Technique, which was a very overbearing attack. He should be able to resist Yao Xi’s golden lotus.”

Teng Zixu and the others were silent. They all knew that Saintess Gu was just comforting Jue Wu because they all knew what the three golden lotuses meant.

On the battlefield, Qin Yu’s punch had boundless power as it collided with the two golden lotuses.

The surroundings turned into a sea of energy. One of the golden lotuses wrapped around Yao Xi, while the other two constantly surged with terrifying power!

Qin Yu’s entire body was enveloped by this power. If he failed to destroy these two golden lotuses as soon as possible, he would be completely devoured sooner or later!

“Ah!”

Qin Yu raised her head and roared angrily. The word “destruction” became even clearer, and his strength increased too!

The Great Destruction Technique was incomparably terrifying, but this was Wu Ji’s close-bodied technique after all. It could not fully unleash its power in Qin Yu’s hands at all!

The origins of Yao Xi’s two golden lotuses were too mysterious. It was almost impossible to defeat them in a short time!

“With my ability, I’m already quite exhausted to unleash this punch…” Qin Yu muttered in pain.

No one knew how terrifying it was for Wu Ji to throw out hundreds of punches casually!

Standing in the center of the sea of energy, Qin Yu was surrounded by two scorching hot golden lotuses.

His body had already started to turn blurry as if he would be devoured by the endless power at any moment.

His face turned pale as paper, and his hands were trembling non-stop because of the extreme consumption of his energy.

Qin Yu knew that this might be his last attack. He needed to make this punch strong enough to resist the power of the golden lotus.

Qin Yu took a deep breath and slowly raised his fist. His body began to flash with an intense light. That was the light of the Great Destruction Technique!

His eyes were full of determination, but at the same time, they were full of anticipation. He hoped that this punch could destroy everything. He hoped that this punch could lead him away from the brink of life and death. He closed his eyes tightly and felt the power surging in his body with all his might.

Soon, Qin Yu’s body began to tremble. That was because the power of the Great Destruction Technique was gathering in his body. A gleam of determination flickered in his eyes, and the radiance of faith rejuvenated him!

Qin Yu understood deep down that no matter what, he could not be defeated here!

“I may not be able to throw hundreds of punches, but can’t I at least throw a second punch?”

The surrounding air seemed to have been torn apart by his fist. The sea of energy began to fluctuate violently, and the golden lotus trembled in front of his fist.

At that moment, the entire world seemed to have fallen silent. All sounds were swallowed by his fist, and all light was covered by his fist.

After that, his fist slammed onto the golden lotus. It was a shocking power that could change the world.

Qin Yu’s fist left a deep mark on the golden lotus. Then the golden lotus began to tremble. Under this punch, the ground collapsed once again! Everything was gone!

“Ah!” Qin Yu’s roar spread throughout all directions and regions. The second punch of the Great Destruction Technique erupted with the power to destroy the world!

“Crack!”

With a crisp sound, cracks began to appear on the two golden lotuses!

Before the crowd could exclaim in surprise, another cracking sound rang out!

The golden lotuses began to shatter. Then they broke inch by inch and soared into the sky, turning into a rain of light scattered all over the sky!

It was a tremendous spectacular scene, a scene that would be unforgettable. This scene could even be described as exquisite.

Countless people raised their heads to look at the falling light spots and were stunned.

“How beautiful…”

“It’s like a rain of light that cleanses the entire world…”

Everyone’s exclamations echoed in the air. Even those who had been watching from the edge of the battlefield were deeply shocked by this scene.

Nevertheless, under this beautiful rain of light, some people came back to their senses.

They hurriedly looked at the center of the battlefield and held their breaths, waiting for the outcome of this battle.

On the battlefield, Qin Yu panted slightly. His body had stretched to its limit, and his mental strength had also been exhausted. He almost could not support his body anymore, and his face was as pale as paper.

If Yao Xi did not fall, Qin Yu would fall subsequently!

Finally, the rain of light disappeared. Qin Yu stared at the other end of the battlefield, and his heart was in his mouth.

Through the rain of light, a figure could be seen standing there.

Qin Yu’s heart thumped, and his expression changed drastically!

Could it be that this Yao Xi had other trump cards?

“You…” Qin Yu opened his mouth and was about to say something when he heard a loud bang.

Following that, Yao Xi fell straight to the ground.

His breathing became extremely weak as he fell to the ground and panted with difficulty.

The Emperor Shadow Technique on his body had long disappeared. Blood stained his body red, and his body nearly shattered.

Seeing this scene, Qin Yu finally heaved a sigh of relief.

He rallied his spirits, looked at Yao Xi coldly, and said, “Yao Xi, you lost, but I don’t want to kill you. I’ll spare your life for now.”

Yao Xi, lying on the ground, did not say a word. His eyes were empty as he gazed at the sky. No one knew what he was thinking.

Qin Yu felt a sweet taste in his throat and had a strong urge to spurt out blood. However, he took a deep breath and sealed his acupoints, forcefully suppressing it.

“Yao Xi, I hope you take care of yourself,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and was about to leave.

“Where are you going!”

At this moment, those few elders of the Yao family suddenly rushed over and blocked Qin Yu’s way.

Their bodies emitted terrifying killing intent, and their eyes were extremely gloomy.

Qin Yu coldly glanced at them and said, “What? The Yao family has lost this battle, but now you want to ruin your integrity?”

The elders were speechless, but their hearts were full of unwillingness!

Their Holy Son had been defeated just like that! No one could accept this!
