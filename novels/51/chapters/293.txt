Chi Feng’s expression was ashen, and there was a hint of fear in it.

The people around him quickly understood.

Chi Feng had actually admitted to it by accident!

“To think that Chi Feng is a b*stard who is trying to kill his teacher!”

“Master Gu isn’t just his master, but he’s also like his father! This kind of person simply doesn’t deserve to live!”

“Ungrateful thing. Master Gu, hurry up and get rid of him!”

When he heard the crowd’s comments, Chi Feng’s expression became more and more unsightly.

In his rage, he immediately roared at everyone, “All of you shut up! Whoever dares to talk nonsense again, I’ll kill him first!”

“What, are you angry?” Qin Yu sneered.

Chi Feng, his fists clenched tightly, glared at Qin Yu.

“You b*stard, you actually destroyed my cultivation path. I will definitely tear you into pieces today!” Chi Feng said through gritted teeth.

Qin Yu sneered. “I’m afraid that you don’t have that ability!”

Chi Feng didn’t say anything more and rushed over with clenched fists!

“You want to have a physical fight with me?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

His whole body immediately shook and a golden light flashed!

Then, Qin Yu clenched his fists and went up to meet him!

“Clang!”

A deafening sound spread to every corner!

The huge collision caused gusts of wind!

The two of them didn’t move at all, and neither of them took a step back!

Chi Feng’s expression couldn’t help but change!

One had to know that there was a huge gap between the realms of the two of them! Qin Yu was actually evenly matched with him?

Qin Yu looked at Chi Feng coldly and said, “Fighting here might hurt the innocent. I believe that no one wants this to happen.”

Chi Feng was extremely angry. He suddenly realized that this Qin Yu had unknowingly taken the moral high ground!

This made Chi Feng the villain! His hope of seizing this chance to establish his position was also destroyed!

“So what if I kill them?!” Chi Feng said coldly.

Qin Yu sneered and said, “Chi Feng, do you really think that you can kill people as you please? Although the officials are more lenient towards fights between martial artists, if you hurt the innocent, you will be screwed.”

Chi Feng immediately came back to his senses.

If he really provoked the officials, then he would be screwed.

“Qin Yu, I will wait for you in the Long Canyon ten kilometers away.” Chi Feng said coldly, then turned around and left.

After he left, Qin Yu’s expression gradually became a bit ugly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“With the augmentation of the Saintly Body Technique, I am barely on par with him.” Qin Yu thought inside.

If that was the case, he would definitely be at a disadvantage.

“Qin Yu, are you alright?” Gu Taichu asked in a deep voice.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’m fine. Let’s go.”

After saying that, Qin Yu took the lead and left in large strides to head straight for the Long Canyon.

The Long Canyon was just like its name. It was a canyon that stretched for miles.

At this moment, Chi Feng was standing on top of the canyon while waiting for Qin Yu’s arrival.

His mood was extremely bad. The future he had envisioned had been destroyed by Qin Yu.

“I must kill Qin Yu!” Thinking of this, Chi Feng clenched his fists again.

Half an hour later, Qin Yu and the other two arrived at the top of the Long Canyon.

Chi Feng’s eyes suddenly opened, and the internal qi on his body burst out in an instant!

“Huh?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Chi Feng was that anxious? He even skipped the opening act?

“Qin Yu, I will skin you alive!” Chi Feng’s feet shook, and he instantly appeared in front of Qin Yu!

The extremely fast movement technique shocked Qin Yu!

“Qin Yu, go to h*ll!” Chi Feng didn’t waste any time. He circulated his internal qi and clenched his fist!

Chi Feng’s frenzied attitude was enough to show how furious he was!

Qin Yu hurriedly jumped up to avoid the attack.

“Boom!”

As this punch landed, the ground in front of him collapsed, and the huge rock was shattered into pieces!

Qin Yu’s expression was solemn, and he didn’t dare to be negligent.

When Qin Yu faced Chi Feng, who was several levels higher than him, the slightest carelessness could result in his death.

“Level three of the Saintly Body Technique!” Qin Yu’s body trembled as he was once again enveloped by golden light!

The opening was a level three Saintly Body Technique, which was enough to show how cautious Qin Yu was.

“Go to h*ll!” Chi Feng roared repeatedly. Qi force gathered on his hand and he swung it towards Qin Yu like a cannonball!

Fortunately, Qin Yu’s movements were agile and he dodged frequently.

“You like to dodge, right? I want to see how long you can dodge!” Chi Feng roared crazily!

“Formless Devil Hand!”

Along with Chi Feng’s shout, a hurricane suddenly blew around Qin Yu!

A terrifying internal qi instantly spread out!

“Crash!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt as if his body was grabbed and he was unable to move!

“Supreme Clarity Divine Slash!”

There was another explosive roar! Rays of light that were like sharp blades rushed towards Qin Yu at an extremely fast speed!

Wherever it passed, the mountain was sliced flat! Such a terrifying power caused everyone’s expressions to change greatly!

“Qin Yu!” Gu Taichu was instantly flustered. He wanted to help, but it was already too late!

“Bang!”

This slash landed solidly on Qin Yu’s body!

That piece of land instantly turned into dust! It rolled and shot out in all directions!

Chi Feng looked at Qin Yu coldly and his eyes were filled with a trace of viciousness!

“Qin Yu!” Gu Taichu was extremely flustered. He immediately used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch and rushed over!

As the dust fell, cracks appeared on the golden light on Qin Yu’s body.

His internal organs were also greatly impacted, and he spat out a trace of bright red blood.

“As expected of an eighth level Inner Strength Grandmaster...” Under this attack, Qin Yu’s internal qi diminished somewhat.

“Qin Yu, you... are you okay?” Gu Taichu asked anxiously.

Qin Yu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said in a low voice, “Master Gu, retreat to the side.”

Gu Taichu ignored Qin Yu and shouted at Chi Feng, “Chi Feng! Your opponent is me. Come at me!”

Chi Feng sneered. “Don’t be anxious. After I kill this little b*stard, you will be next!”

Gu Taichu’s expression was cold and his internal qi rose sharply.

“Master Gu, I can handle it.” Qin Yu stopped Gu Taichu.

He got up from the ground and used the third level of the Saintly Body Technique again.

However, this time, the light on his body dimmed a little.

Qin Yu looked in Chi Feng’s direction, and his expression became more and more serious.

He knew very well that apart from his physical body, Chi Feng could crush him in every aspect.

“It seems that I can only rely on my physical strength now,” Qin Yu said in a low voice.

“If you kneel down and beg me for mercy now, I might be able to spare your life,” Chi Feng said coldly.

Qin Yu didn’t say anything. He just closed his eyes.

In the next second, he suddenly burst out and took the initiative to rush towards Chi Feng!

“You dare to take the initiative to attack me? You’re really too reckless!” Chi Feng couldn’t help but sneer.
