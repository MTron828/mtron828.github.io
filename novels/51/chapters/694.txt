The man said in a deep voice, “The higher-ups are getting more and more dissatisfied with our Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Try not to use our manpower.”

The old woman frowned slightly and snorted lightly, “What’s the reason this time?”

The man sighed and said, “The higher-ups don’t want to see monopoly in an organization, understand?”

The old woman seemed to have understood something.

Mr. Zhou’s words the last time were also very clear. He wanted Jingdu Martial Arts Association to release the resources.

“I understand,” the old woman took a deep breath.

“As long as we are willing, we can support an organization at any time.

“Moreover... all the sects in the world can see our shadows.”

The man nodded and said, “It’s good that you understand.”

The old woman didn’t say anything else but looked at the head of the Heaven Swallowing Python.

A few minutes later.

The old woman appeared in the prison of Jingdu Martial Arts Association. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The one following her was Xia Hang.

“Pick a few Martial Marquises and bring them to me,” the old woman glanced at the prisoners and said coldly.

Xia Hang asked tentatively, “What do you need them for?”

The old woman’s face turned cold and scolded, “You don’t have to know so much. Just follow my order.”

Xia Hang quickly nodded and said, “I understand.”

He picked eight Martial Marquises from this prison as requested by the old woman.

These eight people thought that they were going to be amnestied. They did not know that they were going to become the food for the Heaven Swallowing Python.

Using the body of Martial Marquis as the food was indeed shocking.

...

At this time, Qin Yu was in the basement.

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association has given up on you,” Qin Yu looked at Qu Xie and said coldly.

Qu Xie frowned and shouted, “Impossible! I am the President of Jingdu Martial Arts Association, the owner of the highest authority, I...”

“Are you?” Qin Yu interrupted Qu Xie.

“We both know that you, Qu Xie, are just a pawn. The real controller does not surface, right?”

Qu Xie’s face turned ugly, and the expression on his face changed.

“I have worked for Jingdu Martial Arts Association for decades, and now I have an extremely powerful authority. They will never give up on me!” Qu Xie said coldly.

Qin Yu mocked, “Don’t fool yourself, Qu Xie. You can give up a pawn at any time, let alone them.”

“Impossible, impossible!” Qu Xie’s face was ferocious and full of unwillingness!

His angry roar echoed in the basement.

Under this huge force, the basement began to collapse!

Qin Yu ignored Qu Xie.

He turned around and walked out of the basement with a worried expression on his face.

“It seems... It’s time to consider a way out,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

After killing Qu Xie, Jingdu Martial Arts Association would no longer hold back. They would send people at any time, or even attack Green Moon Villa!

The Green Moon Villa now had hundreds of disciples. It was impossible for Qin Yu to escape by himself.

“If I set up a mountain protection formation in the Green Moon Villa, I wonder if it would be useful,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

With Qin Yu’s technique, it was not difficult for him to set up a mountain-protecting formation.

But Jingdu Martial Arts Association had even more experts! They might be able to break the formation at any time!

This worried Qin Yu.

At night.

Qin Yu could not fall asleep for a long time.

Therefore, he got up and walked out of Green Moon Villa, looking for a place to go.

He came to a quiet bar and ordered a glass of wine.

Listening to the slow and gentle music, Qin Yu’s mind relaxed a lot.

” I’m probably too tired this time,” Qin Yu sighed.

Qin Yu’s spirit was in a high state of tension almost every day.

This sudden relaxation made Qin Yu feel indescribably wonderful.

“Drinking alone?”

A woman’s voice suddenly came from Qin Yu’s side.

Turning around, he saw an extremely voluptuous woman whose hair was in big waves sitting behind him.

“What? You can’t recognize me?” the woman took a sip of wine and said indifferently.

This woman seemed to be familiar, but Qin Yu couldn’t recall.

“We met once at a bar in Jingdu,” the woman reminded him.

Qin Yu suddenly remembered.

At that time, Qin Yu was still hiding in the black robe. This woman had come to strike a conversation with him and gave him a business card.

“If I remember correctly, you should be... Su Qian,” Qin Yu said as he sized up the woman in front of him.

The woman said with a faint smile, “It seems that Mr. Qin still remembers me.”

A hint of a smile could not help but appear on Qin Yu’s face.

He sized up the woman in front of him and said with a sneer, “This is the second time you’ve approached me. Tell me, what do you want?”

Su Qian took a sip of wine and said with a smile, “If I said that I wanted to rope you in, would you believe me?”

“Rope me in?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but want to laugh.

Su Qian nodded seriously and said, “That’s right. Don’t you want to have a strong backer?”

“A strong backer? How strong? Is it stronger than the Jingdu Martial Arts Association? Or is it more powerful than the Yan family?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

Su Qian wasn’t angry. She said with a faint smile, “Indeed, we can’t compete with them, but that’s only within our country.”

“Oh, so it’s another foreign organization, the Hong Yi Sect? Or that so-called Han Palace?” Qin Yu sneered.

Su Qian was silent for a moment, then nodded and said, “That’s right, I am indeed from the Hong Yi Sect.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu instantly sneered non-stop.

“Hong Yi Sect really doesn’t give up. It’s been two years and yet you’re still pestering me,” Qin Yu said with a sneer.

“You have appeared from the moment I stepped into the cultivation path until my current Martial Marquis. It’s amazing.”

Su Qian said with a faint smile, “This also proves our foresight.”

Qin Yu said coldly, “If you don’t want to die, then get lost quickly. I have no interest in a notorious organization like yours.”

“Notorious?” Su Qian revealed a trace of ridicule on her face.

“What is righteous and what is evil? If you really think about it, you, Qin Yu, are also notorious, aren’t you?”

“Jingdu Martial Arts Association is indeed prestigious and well-known. Don’t tell me you think they are some kind of noble sect or good people?”

Hearing Su Qian’s words, a trace of surprise flashed across Qin Yu’s face.

He swayed the wine glass in his hand and said, “Not bad. You’ve successfully moved me. Continue.”

Su Qian said, “Our Hong Yi Sect is indeed notorious, but we also have extremely strong strength. It’s beneficial to you without any harm.”

“If you’re willing, we can even work on a collaboration basis.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “How do you prove your strength?”

Su Qian said with a faint smile, “Mr. Qin can make a request and see if we can do it.”

A smile instantly appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

He swayed the wine glass in his hand and said indifferently, “Alright. If you can find where Yan Ruoxue is, I’ll believe you. How about it?”
