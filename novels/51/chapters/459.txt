Chapter 460: Qin Yu’s Return Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

With Qin Yu’s current state of mind, it wasn’t difficult for him to step into the half-step Martial Marquis realm. He just needed a large amount of spiritual energy to support him.

Ordinary herbs probably wouldn’t be effective anymore.

“If I had ten thousand-year-old herbs or a spiritual spring, I might be able to step into the half-step Martial Marquis Realm,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

He calculated the time and found that there was only one and a half months left until September 9th.

If he could find enough spiritual energy in this one and a half months, then stepping into the half-step Martial Marquis realm wouldn’t be a problem at all.

As for Han Wei, he wouldn’t be worth mentioning.

Therefore, Qin Yu planned to carry on the next journey to find spiritual energy.

After he carried Fang Yue out of the Water Rhyme Tower, countless messages came from Qin Yu’s phone.

He opened it and saw the text messages and phone calls from Yao Qing and the others.

“Mr. Qin, He Teng came to Chuzhou and threatened to take your life.”

“Mr. Qin, if you don’t come back, he will start killing the people around you...”

Other than from Yao Qing, there were also countless messages from unknown numbers.

“Trash! Coward!”

“You managed to escape on your own. The people around you all died at the hands of He Teng. How can someone like you call yourself the King of Chuzhou?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I really misjudged you. I didn’t expect you to be such a scum!”

When he saw the flood of messages on his phone, Qin Yu’s expression immediately turned ugly.

He hurriedly took out his phone and called Yao Qing.

As soon as the call was connected, Yao Qing said impatiently, “Mr. Qin, where are you?”

Qin Yu didn’t answer this question, but asked anxiously, “What’s the situation now?”

Yao Qing lamented, “The people from the four big families are all dead. He Teng even spread the word that as long as they obey him, they will be spared.”

“Now, many people are standing by He Teng’s side, but... He Teng seems to value Jiang Gu and Gu Taichu very much.”

Qin Yu’s expression immediately changed.

He hurriedly asked, “How are the two of them now?”

Yao Qing said, “Gu Taichu and Jiang Gu both rejected He Teng’s offer, so... He Teng wants to kill them.”

“Mr. Qin, you’d better come back quickly. Now, people in Chuzhou say that you’re timid and cowardly...”

Qin Yu took a deep breath and said in a sullen voice, “I understand. I’ll go back to Chuzhou now.”

After saying this, Qin Yu brought Fang Yue and hurried to the airport.

After buying the earliest flight ticket, he set off on the journey back to Chuzhou.

...

In Chuzhou, many martial artists who had heard the news from other places were waiting for this big battle.

“I wanted to see how Qin Yu would get beaten. I didn’t expect that he didn’t dare to fight at all.”

“Yeah, it’s been a few days but he still hasn’t appeared.”

“This is really wasting my time. Let’s go!”

“There is news that He Teng went to the Jiang Family!” At this time, a piece of news suddenly spread.

“It seems that He Teng is going to make a move on Jiang Gu.”

“Let’s go and take a look.”

A group of people rushed to the Jiang family.

Not only these martial artists from all over the world, but even some ordinary people in Chuzhou were also paying attention to this decisive battle.

Although they didn’t understand what was going on, they all wanted to watch the drama.

“I heard that Jiang Gu of the Jiang Group is also involved.”

“Yeah, Mr. Jiang is a famous person in Chuzhou. I heard that he is quite close to Qin Yu.”

“It has nothing to do with us. Let’s go to sleep.”

...

In the Jiang family’s home, it was already late at night, but Jiang Gu hadn’t fallen asleep yet.

The originally lively Jiang family had now become extremely deserted.

Many of Jiang Gu’s followers, afraid of being implicated, had fled the Jiang family because they were afraid of death.

“Master, it’s getting late. Go and rest.” Uncle Zhong took a coat and draped it over Jiang Gu’s shoulder.

Jiang Gu let out a long sigh. He glanced at Uncle Zhong and said, “Mr. Zhong, you should go too. I don’t want to implicate you.”

Uncle Zhong shook his head and said, “Master, I’ve been following you for almost 30 years. As long as you don’t leave, I won’t go anywhere.”

Jiang Gu opened his mouth, and a trace of bitterness flashed through his heart.

“Mr. Zhong, take the bank card and leave quickly.” Jiang Gu took out a bank card from his pocket and handed it to Uncle Zhong.

However, Uncle Zhong pushed the bank card back and smiled. “Master, I won’t leave.”

Jiang Gu wanted to say something, but at this moment, he suddenly felt a strong internal qi coming from outside.

This internal qi was extremely terrifying. It was something Jiang Gu had never felt before!

“It’s too late to leave now.” Jiang Gu sighed.

He looked at Uncle Zhong and said in a low voice, “Mr. Zhong, I’ve let you down.”

Before Jiang Gu could finish his words, a figure suddenly appeared behind Jiang Gu.

Jiang Gu turned around and saw He Teng sitting on the sofa while sipping tea.

Jiang Gu’s expression changed. He looked at He Teng and said coldly, “Mr. He, you visited so late at night. What’s the matter?”

He Teng took a sip of tea and said indifferently, “Don’t play dumb. You humiliated me today. Don’t you know the consequences?”

It was impossible to say that Jiang Gu wasn’t afraid when facing a half-step Martial Marquis.

Jiang Gu suppressed the fear in his heart and tried his best to remain calm as he said, “With your strength, why would you lack me as a follower?”

He Teng narrowed his eyes and sneered. “You’re right. In my eyes, you are indeed a nobody!”

“But I have always appreciated talents. If you change your mind now, it’s still not too late,” He Teng said indifferently.

Jiang Gu cupped his hands and said, “I, Jiang Gu, am really unqualified for it. Mr. He, it’s better to find someone else.”

He Teng’s expression immediately turned cold.

“You didn’t appreciate my offer to you. Since you want to die, then I’ll satisfy you!” He Teng, his body full of murderous internal qi, slowly stood up!

“Mr. He, this matter has nothing to do with Mr. Zhong. He’s just an ordinary person. Let him go.” Jiang Gu frowned and said with a slightly pleading tone.

He Teng raised his eyebrows and sneered. “You want me to let him go? Fine.”

As soon as he said that, He Teng raised his finger and an internal qi shot through Uncle Zhong’s chest like a bullet!

Puff!

A mouthful of blood spurted out of Uncle Zhong’s mouth! His internal qi was dissipating rapidly!

“You!” Jiang Gu’s expression changed drastically!

“He Teng, you’re going too far!”

The internal qi on Jiang Gu’s body burst out, and rays of dark golden light surrounded Jiang Gu’s body!

“I’m going to kill you!” Jiang Gu shouted, and then rushed toward He Teng!

He Teng sneered and raised his fist to meet it.

“Clang!”

With just one punch, Jiang Gu was sent flying! His fist was almost crushed!

“This person’s body... is a holy body. Kill him and take his body!” At this moment, the voice in He Teng’s mind rang out.

“Okay, I got it.” He Teng replied and then walked towards Jiang Gu.

Jiang Gu gritted his teeth and tried to resist. However, just as he was about to stand up, He Teng raised his hand and slapped Jiang Gu’s chest!

With this slap, Jiang Gu completely lost the ability to resist!

“Since you’re so loyal, I’ll send you to h*ll,” He Teng said coldly.

Light gathered on his hand, and a terrifying internal qi reverberated in the room

Then, this internal qi shot towards Jiang Gu!

“Bang!”

Just as this power ball was about to land on Jiang Gu’s body, a large hand forcefully grabbed this power ball!

“He Teng, I didn’t expect you to come here to dig your own grave.”

A familiar voice entered Jiang Gu’s ears.

“Mr. ... Mr. Qin!” Jiang Gu shouted excitedly!
