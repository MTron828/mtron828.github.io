Chapter 812: Chapter 812, the Yan family wanted someone Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Hearing this, Granny Qin immediately panicked.

She hurriedly got up and said anxiously, “Esteemed higher-ups, please give me another chance on account of the many years I have devoted to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association!”

A higher-up coldly said, “It is on account of your contribution to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association that I let you personally settle this.”

Granny Qin gritted her teeth and said, “Give me a few days, okay?”

“I’ll give you three days at most. I hope you can come up with a decent result in three days,”said one of the higher-ups coldly.

“Granny Qin, I hope you don’t make the wrong decision.”

After saying this, the higher-ups slowly disappeared, leaving Granny Qin standing there in a daze.

Tears welled up in the corners of Granny Qin’s eyes. She had never thought that this would be the end result.

“Qin Yu, it’s all your fault... Qin Yu! ! !”Granny Qin’s angry voice spread throughout the entire room.

After returning home, Blacky was waiting bitterly at home.

Seeing Granny Qin return, Blacky hurriedly got up.

“Granny Qin, Are You Alright?”Blacky walked over and asked. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Granny Qin forced a smile, her face showing a trace of kindness.

“I’m Fine,”Granny Qin said with a smile.

“Blacky, no matter what, I will protect your life.”Granny Qin made up her mind in her heart.

...

At this moment, Qin Yu had already carried Yan Ruoxue and sprinted all the way to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

As soon as he entered the door, Qin Yu shouted with all his might, “Lord Pavilion Master! Lord Pavilion Master!”

This voice contained spirit energy and immediately shook the entire divine medicine pavilion, causing it to buzz.

The many alchemists who had already fallen asleep were also woken up at this moment.

Just as everyone was panicking, the pavilion master had already floated over from upstairs.

She looked at Qin Yu, who was covered in blood, and Yan Ruoxue, who was lying in Qin Yu’s arms. A trace of surprise immediately flashed across her face.

“You... really saved her?”The pavilion master seemed to be in disbelief.

“This is really... snatching food from the Tiger’s mouth.”Jiang he slowly walked over from the side.

Qin Yu was not in the mood to listen to their flattery. He said anxiously, “Pavilion Master, Ruoxue is seriously injured now. You... you save her!”

The pavilion master did not waste any time. She took Yan Ruoxue from Qin Yu’s hands and turned around to walk upstairs.

“Just wait here.”The pavilion master glanced at Qin Yu and said.

Although Qin Yu was anxious, there was nothing he could do. He could only stand to the side and wait.

...

The next day.

In a skyscraper somewhere in Jingdu.

This was where the Yan family’s company was located.

In the guest room, Granny Qin and Yan Sihai looked at each other.

“Granny Qin, you said that Yan Ruoxue was taken away by Qin Yu?”Yan Sihai’s expression was a little ugly.

Granny qin nodded and said, “It’s about what happened last night.”

Yan Sihai immediately flew into a rage, slapping the table and standing up!

“My Yan family handed over to your Jingdu Martial Arts Association, and you’re giving me such an outcome? !”Yan Sihai said angrily.

Facing Yan Sihai’s anger, even Granny Qin didn’t dare to make a sound for a moment.

Granny Qin was silent for a moment, then said, “Mr. Yan, Yan Ruoxue is a member of Your Yan family. You have the right to take her back.”

Yan Sihai could not help but sneer, “You have lost her, and you want me to ask for her back?”

Granny Qin gritted her teeth and almost begged, “Mr. Yan, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association has let you down. Just take it as I’m begging you!”

“As long as you ask for her back, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association will definitely remember this favor!”

Yan Sihai sneered again and again.

Just as he was about to refuse, Yan Jinyao walked in again.

“Granny Qin, we can promise you,”said Yan Jinyao.

Yan Sihai frowned slightly, as if he didn’t understand.

Granny Qin said excitedly, “Thank you, Young Master Yan!”

“But there’s a problem. Qin Yu has taken him away now. He must have escaped, right? Where should we go to find him?”Yan Jinyao asked in puzzlement.

Granny Qin quickly said, “Qin Yu must have gone to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion Now! Yan Ruoxue’s injuries are very serious, so he can only seek help from the Divine Alchemist Pavilion!”

Yan Jinyao was silent for a moment and said, “Okay, we understand.”

After sending Granny Qin away, Yan Sihai said in a deep voice, “Jinyao, it’s already been twice.”

Yan jinyao sighed and said, “Dad, the reason for these two times is because of Yan Ruoxue. No matter what, we can’t let Yan Ruoxue cultivate!”

“I am not doing it for the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, I am doing it for myself!”

“Once Yan Ruoxue steps onto the path of cultivation, her powers will be far above mine!”

Yan sihai frowned and said: “Yan Ruoxue alone really makes you so worried?”

“Father, you have not obtained her bloodline. You do not know what kind of power this bloodline holds.”Yan Jinyao shook his head and said.

“I have always been known as the number one person among the fire country’s younger generation, and I have always been rather proud of myself.”

“But ever since I obtained Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline, I have suddenly realised that the me in the past... . . was nothing more than an ant! Not even worth mentioning!”

Hearing Yan Jin Yao’s words, Yan Si Hai’s face turned grave.

“But... . . Will that Qin Yu obediently let her go?”Yan Si Hai asked in puzzlement.

“Of course not,”Yan Jinyao said with a cold smile.

“So, we still have to ask Yan Yongxiu to come forward. He is Yan Ruoxue’s father, so he naturally has the right to take her back! If Qin Yu doesn’t let her go, then he will be convicted of kidnapping!”

Yan Sihai did not say anything more. The two of them immediately left the company together and found Yan Yongxiu.

“Ruoxue was taken away by Qin Yu? !”Yan Yongxiu was a little surprised, and his heart was even more shocked.

Yan Yongxiu, who grew up in Jingdu, naturally knew what the Jingdu martial arts association meant.

“Your daughter was taken away by Qin Yu. You have to come with us to get her back,”Yan Sihai said coldly.

“How can a Wild Brat take a member of our Yan family away! This concerns the face of our Yan family!”

Yan Yongxiu did not know the malicious thoughts of Yan Sihai and his son at all.

In addition, he was also filled with longing for Yan Ruoxue.

Therefore, he did not think too much and agreed.

The group of people immediately rushed towards the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

At this moment, the pavilion master still did not come down from upstairs.

Qin Yu stood as he descended. He could smell the fragrance of medicinal herbs as well as the pill clouds that gathered in the sky from time to time.

The entire night, he still didn’t get any results. This made Qin Yu extremely anxious.

“Elder Qin, there’s someone outside claiming to be from the Yan family. He wants to see you!”At this moment, someone suddenly ran over and said.

“Someone from the Yan Family?”Qin Yu’s brows immediately furrowed tightly.

“Handlebar mustache, you stay here and watch. I’ll go take a look.”Qin Yu said to the handlebar mustache.

After saying this, Qin Yu quickly walked toward the direction of the door.
