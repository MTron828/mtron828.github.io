Chapter 2743: The Wish Oath

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

According to the Tomb of Heavenly Sins record, there had never been a person with a fourth form of mark. The third form was the most.

This was equivalent to a new world. That was why he had been so nervous.

Even the cold and frosty Alester was attracted by Qin Yu at this moment.

“He’s just a lucky level 9 person. Why don’t we just kill him and take his blood? Why is it so troublesome?”

Luo Yu sneered.

“Did you not eat enough of my dust? Why is your mouth still so smelly?” Qin Yu did not show any weakness to the person who attacked him.

“If you have any doubts about my suggestion, you can leave. If not, don’t fight among yourselves. Although there is some information about the Tomb of Heavenly Sins, there may be new changes every time a new Heavenly Sin appears. If we can’t work together, we will die.”

Cang Yunzi said coldly, somewhat dissatisfied with Luo Yu’s sudden words. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Qin Yu, you can ask if you have any questions. The Tomb of Heavenly Sins will leave this place in three days. That will be our opportunity to take action.”

“Why is Heavenly Sin so important? What can we get from it?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“It’s a product left behind by all those who resisted the heavens during the great god and devil war. Sinners will be hunted down by them forever. The Tomb of Heavenly Sins will hunt down someone with a mark above the second level for the rest of their lives if they don’t enter it to be judged. It can be said that this operation is also to save ourselves.”

Cang Yunzi said with a bitter smile.

“Before this, there were extremely rare geniuses in the Saint Kingdom. One of them awakened the peak power of the peak Dao Realm level 15. His name was Han Tian. He also had the fourth form of mark like you. The other was a peak Holy Consciousness cultivator. He also died during the test of the third mark. There were also some rumors. I don’t know if they are reliable, but living beings who didn’t enter the Tomb of Heavenly Sins couldn’t escape from Heavenly Sin’s pursuit according to my information.”

After confirming Qin Yu’s mark, Cang Yunzi began to tell Qin Yu the details of Heavenly Sin.

“According to our guesses, the first three levels of Heavenly Sin’s power have to abide by certain rules. If one can’t pass it, the marked sinner would be killed. However, from the fourth level onwards, the sealing power will be lifted and it will go all out to hunt down the person who carries the mark. This is why no one ever has the fourth level of the mark. With Heavenly Sin’s power, even the Holy Lord might not be able to obtain any benefits. Therefore, your value is very high.”

Cang Yunzi shook his head.

Qin Yu nodded slightly, but a storm was brewing in his heart.

This old man’s speculation was not much different from Sir Dagger’s!

If Sir Dagger had not appeared at the end, he would not have been able to pass the attack of the fourth Heavenly Sin.

“What we know now is that Heavenly Sin itself seems to be formed by a powerful magical artifact, which is why it could gather the huge resentment of those who resisted the heavens and formed this unsolved place. Different amounts of resentment form different levels.”

Cang Yunzi’s palm moved slightly and holy energy swirled in his hand.

He directly formed a dynamic image and displayed his description to Qin Yu.

“These grudges form a huge whirlpool, which is also different secret realms. Different levels of strength will meet different grudges levels. There will be many impossible fortuitous encounters. For example, the awakening of a powerful peak power. The Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom’s Rosacea, Fisherman, and Farmer all awakened their peak power within. Moreover, their breakthrough to the Holy Consciousness realm seems to be related to the fortuitous encounters.”

“There are also people who directly received the inheritance and broke through to the peak of the Holy Consciousness Realm. That Butcher is currently roaming around the Saint Kingdom. He should be trying to break through to the final step.”

What the he*l!

As soon as he said this, not only Qin Yu, but even the few people beside him revealed surprised expressions.

Almost all of these people knew the name of Butcher.

He was fighting against the Saints as a non-Saint. He could even suppress a portion of the Saints.

Everyone was speculating about his power source, but they did not expect him to have been to Heavenly Sin before.

“All in all, there are all kinds of unimaginable things in the Heavenly Sin. Some are even beyond our understanding. Of course, most of them are dead. Perhaps we will only have a few left when we return.”

Cang Yunzi shook his head.

“If there is no problem, gather at the agreed place three days later. At that time, follow me into the Heavenly Sin. Before this, every one except Lord Alester must swear a soul oath. Once you enter the Tomb of Heavenly Sins, you must abide by the oath and be one with each other. You must help each other as long as your lives are not affected. If you violate this oath, you will be exterminated.”

Cang Yunzi took out an ancient book. As soon as the book appeared, Qin Yu felt his soul was being drawn into the old book.

“Please place your hands on the Book of Wishes and recite this oath in your hearts. This tomb is no small matter. Only by working together can we have a chance of survival.’

After Cang Yunzi finished speaking, everyone placed their hands on it and recited the oath.

Qin Yu felt that he was related to the Book of Wishes. If they broke the oath, the Book of Wishes could directly trace it back to them and then launch a fatal attack.

However, Qin Yu felt something was wrong with Gu Ying beside him when he was swearing.

It seemed that his connection with the Book of Wishes was different from others. Qin Yu frowned slightly, but he did not say anything because he did not understand this book.

After making the oath, everyone left Cang Yunzi’s house.

“Qin Yu, please stay for now. I have something to tell you.” Just as Qin Yu was about to leave, Cang Yunzi suddenly stopped him.

“Taoist priest, what’s the matter?”

Qin Yu was a little puzzled.

“Qin Yu, there’s something that I can’t talk about just now. I have to explain it to vou.”

Cang Yunzi sighed softly.

“There seems to be something wrong with your Mark of Atonement.”

“What do you mean?”

The old Taoist priest’s words made Qin Yu’s hair stand on end.

“If my judgment is correct, you should be the sinner that Heavenly Sin has determined to kill. Therefore, you will be targeted by an even stronger force if you go inside. I need to explain it to you first. Don’t think that I’m the one who set it up.”

“Is there any reason for this?”

Qin Yu frowned slightly.

“You should already understand the Heavenly Sin. Who are the greatest sinners to it? The descendants of the Immortal Emperor, the bloodline of the Dao Protectors, and all those who directly affected the battle were all people they determined to kill..”
