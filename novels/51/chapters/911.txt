Chapter 912: Chapter 912, two martial saints! 

Qin Yu and Li Yu’s faces turned extremely ugly when they saw the resplendent light that shone from the exit!

“No!”Qin Yu thought to himself that things were not looking good.

He quickly looked at Li Yu and said, “Quick, go and inform senior Jiang he to quickly hide!”

“What About You?”Li Yu asked.

Qin Yu said coldly, “I will think of a way to deal with them.”

Li Yu wanted to say something, but was stopped by Qin Yu’s shout.

Li Yu had no choice but to follow Qin Yu’s request and prepare to inform Jiang he.

But at this moment, the bright lights at the exit began to dissipate.

In a few seconds, the lights disappeared without a trace.

“HM?”The two of them looked at the exit simultaneously.

“What’s going on?”

Qin Yu and Li Yu vigilantly looked at the exit, their faces filled with nervousness.

After a full few minutes, the light didn’t light up again.

“Strange, he actually canceled the inspection,”Li Yu said in a deep voice.

“Canceled? What’s going on?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Li Yu guessed, “Could it be that the mighty figure from last time did something?”

Qin Yu’s face was instantly filled with astonishment when he heard that.

If that was really the case, then just what kind of strength did this almighty have?

In the outside world.

Du Xuanyu shook his head and said with some displeasure, “There’s no secret realm at all. I’ve checked it out.”

Gu Xinghe said with a cold face, “You’re not lying to me, right?”

“Why would I lie to You, Young Master Gu? Don’t forget that I work for the higher-ups. I also want to kill that Qin Yu,”du Xuanyu said with a cold face.

Although he said so, Gu Xinghe still didn’t believe him.

He glanced at du xuanyu and said indifferently, “Master Du, you’d better not lie to me. I hate being lied to.”

Du Xuanyu snorted and didn’t say anything.

“Young master Gu, master du shouldn’t lie,”Zhai Xing said.

Gu Xinghe snorted and said, “Then why did their internal Qi disappear here?”

Zhai xing guessed, “Perhaps they used some secret technique to conceal their internal Qi.”

Gu Xinghe did not express his opinion on this.

He waved his hand and said, “Let’s go.”

The group left.

After rushing back to Jingdu, Gu Xinghe did not stop there.

He planned to find another mystic realm master to investigate.

And Gu Xinghe’s first choice was Li Yu’s master.

...

Qin Yu waited in the mystic realm for half a day.

After confirming that there was no one outside, Qin Yu carefully walked out of the mystic realm.

At this moment, Qin Yu was even more curious about the Yan family’s mystic realm.

If it was really as Li Yu said, and only the Almighty Realm could repair the mystic realm, then the strength of the Yan family was definitely beyond imagination.

“This Yan family’s mystic realm... What kind of existence is it?”Qin Yu took a deep breath. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After thinking about it, Qin Yu planned to find Old Mister Yan and find out.

Therefore, Qin Yu took out his phone and found old Mister Yan’s phone number.

After the call was connected, Qin Yu asked for Old Mister Yan’s location.

After a conversation, he found out that old Mister Yan was currently in sea city. Therefore, after he hung up the phone, Qin Yu rushed to sea city.

Because Qin Yu could not take any transportation, he could only go to sea city on foot.

This was an extremely long journey. Even for Qin Yu, it would take him several days.

“Alright, I’ll treat it as an experience to train my state of mind.”Qin Yu thought to himself.

...

At the same time, the conflict between the martial artists and the disciples in the secret realm was getting more and more serious.

Under the blessing of the seven martial saints, the disciples of the current age had almost no dignity.

And the reason for the large-scale conflict between the two sides was because of the division of resources.

Ever since someone stepped into the martial saint realm, many new cultivation resources had appeared in the world.

On this day, in a border city in the south, a shocking big mine had exploded!

It was said that this was a big spiritual stone mine. And this spiritual stone could not only be used to forge all kinds of top-tier spiritual artifacts, it could even be used to refine medicine or even directly swallow it!

Every spirit stone contained extremely tyrannical Qi/spiritual energy!

The appearance of a large, ownerless mine naturally attracted the attention of various factions.

These factions included the martial arts clans of the present age, as well as the various aristocratic families from the secret realm!

Martial Arts Forum.

On the day the large mine was revealed, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association issued an announcement:

This large spirit stone mine could be said to be unprecedented, and our Jingdu Martial Arts Association would also take on the role of the distributor to decide where this large spirit stone mine would go.

However, the moment this announcement was issued, it was completely flamed.

“F * ck you, the Jingdu Martial Arts Association and the secret realm are wearing the same pants!”

“For so many years, the resources have been firmly controlled by you in your own hands. Do you think we will still believe it?”

“Power has been earned by ourselves. All revolutions need to be sacrificed. We will never let the JINGDU martial arts association slaughter US AGAIN!”

Seeing all kinds of curses, the Jingdu martial arts association was furious, but there was nothing they could do.

More and more warriors gathered toward the spirit stone mine.

In the dark, there were at least hundreds of warriors lurking there.

The Warriors in the secret realm and the Warriors in the present age seemed to be ready to fight at any time.

...

It took Qin Yu two whole days to arrive at sea city.

According to the address given by old Mister Yan, old Mister Yan was currently living in a single-family villa in the suburbs.

Compared to the Yan family’s manor, this villa looked extremely shabby.

However, it was in this shabby place that old Mister Yan began his second rise.

Qin Yu quickly rushed to the vicinity of this villa.

He lowered his hat and released his spiritual sense at the same time, covering a radius of several hundred meters.

After making sure that no one was around, Qin Yu carefully walked into the villa.

In the courtyard of the villa.

Old Mister Yan was watering the flowers.

Seeing that Qin Yu had rushed over, old Mister Yan put down the shower in his hand.

“Qin Yu, the people outside seem to be looking for you and Ruoxue.”Old Mister Yan’s tone was somewhat anxious.

“Is Ruoxue really by your side? Is she okay? Is there anything wrong with her body? where is she now? Is she safe?”

Old Mister Yan’s series of questions made Qin Yu not know how to answer.

“I came to find you this time for this matter.”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

“Ruoxue was taken away by someone.”

Old Mister Yan’s expression suddenly changed!

He grabbed Qin Yu’s arm and said anxiously, “Didn’t I say that I want you to take care of her! How did you promise me!”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Old Mister Yan, please listen to my explanation. She...”

Before he could finish his words, Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed!

He only felt a chill on his back and the hairs on his back stood up unconsciously!

This was the instinctive reaction of his body when danger approached!

“Who is it?”Qin Yu hurriedly turned around and looked around.

“Qin Yu, I’ve finally waited for you...”a voice sounded.

Then, he saw Wan Gu Qiong slowly walking out with two martial saints.

Qin Yu did not dare to think too much. He immediately planned to use the line word spell to escape.

However, Wan Gu Qiong did not give him a chance at all. The two martial saints quickly sealed off the space.

“I knew... you would definitely come here!”Wan Gu Qiong said with a sinister expression.
