Chapter 902: Chapter 902, Qin Yu’s fury

Qin Yu listened to the pavilion master’s narration and nodded slightly.

“Xu Huaigu once said that stepping into the martial saint realm is not something that can be done in a day. Instead, it requires a long period of accumulation. Therefore, it is very difficult for young people to step into the martial saint realm within a short period of time,”the pavilion master continued.

“Perhaps, the previous prediction about you was that you would be the first among the younger generation.”

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I hope so. Before I become a martial saint, I’m afraid I’ll have to live with my tail between my legs.”

Regarding this, the pavilion master did not express her opinion.

She continued, “During the period when you left, the martial arts world had also undergone great changes. The people who walked out of the mystic realm and the martial artists in this world had a strong animosity.”

“It’s not an exaggeration to say that they seemed to have formed two factions. Under the push of Xu Huaigu, many people deeply detested the people in the mystic realm.”

“Of course, Xu Huaigu will do his best to protect the people of the current era.”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and sighed, “This is inevitable. Just like two people of different classes, the possibility of becoming friends is very small.”

The pavilion master said in a deep voice, “If it’s really not possible, you can go to Xu Huaigu. He will most likely help you.”

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “There’s no need. I don’t want to implicate others anymore.”

At this point, Qin Yu suddenly thought of the Green Moon Villa.

He said in a deep voice, “Pavilion Master, who did the Green Moon Villa Thing?”

The Pavilion Master was silent for a moment, then shook his head and said, “You don’t need to ask me this. Go to the martial arts forum and take a look. Naturally, everything will be known.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately took out his phone and opened the martial arts forum.

The martial arts forum was extremely lively.

Many people were cursing the JINGDU martial arts association.

Because of the appearance of the secret realm, both sides had a strong enmity.

And the Jingdu Martial Arts Association chose to stand on the side of the secret realm, causing many ordinary warriors of the current era to begin to hate the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

This was good news for Qin Yu.

After flipping through a few posts, Qin Yu roughly understood the current situation of the era.

“The Jingdu martial arts association actually re-recruited people and established a council.”Qin Yu couldn’t help but frown. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

And the president of the council was actually he teng!

“How ironic.”Seeing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer repeatedly.

Continuing to watch, Qin Yu quickly saw a video.

And the content of the video was precisely the battle between Wan Gu Qiong and the disciples of the Green Moon Villa!

All kinds of cruel methods couldn’t help but be shocking!

Even Qin Yu was covered in sweat when he saw it!

He stared at the content on the screen and couldn’t help but grit his teeth and say, “Wan Gu Qiong... I must kill you! !”

Qin Yu never thought that Wan Gu Qiong would be so cruel!

At this moment, the pavilion master’s phone suddenly rang.

She glanced at the phone and frowned slightly.

“Qin Yu, stay here. No matter what you hear, don’t speak,”the pavilion master stood up and said.

Qin Yu frowned and asked, “What happened?”

“Someone is coming,”the pavilion master said and walked out of the secret room quickly.

Qin Yu sat in the secret room and did not dare to say a word. He closed his eyes slightly and waited quietly.

Inside the pavilion master’s building.

Wan Gu Qiong brought a martial saint and swaggered upstairs.

Ever since he saw the pavilion master’s face last time, Wan Gu Qiong had not given up.

Even if he had been warned by ye Qing, he did not care at all.

“What are you doing here?”Looking at Wan Gu Qiong’s wretched face, the pavilion master could not help but frown slightly.

Wan Gu Qiong said with a smile, “I’ve missed you. I’m here to see you.”

The pavilion master’s expression instantly became extremely cold. She said in a deep voice, “You’re not welcome here.”

“Hahaha! So what if you’re not welcome?”Wan Gu Qiong’s face was thick-skinned.

The pavilion master’s expression became even colder. However, there was a martial saint standing beside Wan Gu Qiong. The Pavilion Master could not do anything to him.

“Pavilion master, without a martial saint in this era, it’s difficult to take even a single step forward.”Wan Gu Qiong said with a smile.

“Even in this chaotic world, your medicine God Pavilion must seek protection, right? Without a martial saint, the medicine God Pavilion will disappear sooner or later!”

The pavilion master forcefully suppressed the anger in his heart and said, “What exactly are you trying to say?”

Wan Gu Qiong said with a smile, “Although you’re not young anymore, you still have the appearance of a flower. Not only do you have the appearance of a young girl, you also have the mentality of a mature woman. This is simply the best!”

“If you are willing to accompany me for one night, I will protect you for just one night. How about it?”Wan Gu Qiong said with a lecherous smile.

Hearing Wan Gu Qiong’s filthy words, the pavilion master could not help but feel furious!

She said coldly, “You better get lost right now!”

“Your angry look is more attractive...”Wan Gu Qiong reached out her hand and touched the pavilion master’s face in a teasing manner.

The pavilion master slapped Wan Gu Qiong’s hand away and said angrily, “Get lost!”

Wan Gu Qiong snorted coldly and said, “Don’t think that I can’t do anything to you just because ye Qing is protecting you! Let me tell you, it’s not difficult to avoid ye Qing at all!”

“You’re very disgusting in my eyes,”said the pavilion master coldly.

Wan Gu Qiong sneered and said, “So what? With your relationship with Qin Yu, you’ll be targeted by everyone sooner or later. At that time, I’ll see what ye Qing will do!”

“I also told you that sooner or later, I will put you on the bed!”

After saying this, Wan guqiong turned around and left.

Qin Yu heard these words clearly in the secret room.

He clenched his teeth tightly, and his eyes were wide open. He clenched his fists tightly, and anger kept surging up.

“Wan Guqiong...”Qin Yu muttered the name through the gaps of his teeth. The anger on his body almost made him lose his cool.
