Chapter 199: Becoming Famous After a Single Battle! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In an instant, eight rays of light flashed across the graveyard!

The radiance was so bright that it almost pierced through the clouds!

“What is this?” Everyone was shocked by this scene!

Even Yan Jiang’s face was filled with astonishment as he stared fixedly at these rays of light.

“Could it be that... Qin Yu is also a Formation Master?” Yan Jiang swallowed hard.

He suddenly realized that he had underestimated Qin Yu previously. He was really too ignorant!

He had martial arts skills, medical skills, and formation skills. These skills were enough to establish a top-tier family!

“Old b*stard, you deserve to die.” Qin Yu’s gaze was extremely cold. At this moment, even his aura instantly changed!

Waves of dark energy surged over from all directions. With Qin Yu as the center, they gathered into a small vortex.

The atmosphere instantly became tense, and some people even shivered!

A look of shock flashed across Jiang Gu’s face, but he wasn’t afraid.

Because... Jiang Gu had full confidence in the Divine Dragon Fist!

“Putting on airs? Qin Yu, you will definitely die today!” Jiang Gu roared again and again, and the two huge dragon heads ruthlessly smashed towards Qin Yu!

“Watch me crush you!” Qin Yu roared, and all the dark energy instantly gathered on his fist!

“Boom!”

This was an unprecedented huge collision, and everyone was affected.

The strong ones retreated a few steps, while the weak ones kneeled on the spot!

“Rumble!”

The small hill in the distance was shattered, and the sand and stones were turned into dust. The vast and mighty aura almost filled this small area of the internal qi!

“Old b*stard, go to hell!” Qin Yu’s face was ferocious, and he roared repeatedly. The muscles on his body bulged like veins, and his fists crushed down with a crushing force!

Finally, the two dragon heads couldn’t take it anymore, and cracks began to appear!

“Crack!”

Then, under everyone’s watchful eyes, the dragon heads directly collapsed before turning into light spots and dissipating in the air!

“How is this possible?!” Jiang Gu’s pupils dilated, and he immediately felt that something was wrong!

However, it was already too late. After Qin Yu absorbed the dark energy, he seemed to have fallen into a state of madness!

He took a step forward, and his fist that was surrounded by golden light smashed into Jiang Gu’s chest fiercely!

Jiang Gu’s chest instantly sank a few times, and his body fell heavily onto the ground!

“Go to hell!” Qin Yu didn’t stop at all. He took advantage of the situation and continued to attack. Again and again, he kept punching at Jiang Gu’s body fiercely!

Under this huge force, Jiang Gu’s body was almost shattered!

He spat out a huge mouthful of blood!

“How is this possible?!” Everyone gasped!

A dignified Inner Strength Grandmaster was actually pressed into the ground and beaten up?

Jiang Gu, who had roamed Chuzhou for so many years, was actually lying on the ground like a dead dog?

This... this simply blew everyone’s minds!

“Little b*stard, how dare you?!” Jiang Gu roared furiously, but he was punched again!

“Bang!”

Another punch landed on Jiang Gu’s face.

Under this punch, Jiang Gu’s facial bones were directly shattered! His face was black and blue!

After a series of attacks, Jiang Gu had completely fallen to the ground.

He wanted to get up many times, but he was on the verge of collapsing and fell heavily to the ground.

Qin Yu panted heavily and stared at Jiang Gu.

“Little b*stard, you...” Jiang Gu spat out these words with difficulty.

But before he could finish his words, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Then, he fell to the ground and completely fainted.

It was over.

This fight, which was the focus of everyone’s attention, ended just like that.

Jiang Gu had cultivated for three years and thought that he could once again dominate Chuzhou.

However, he had just come out of seclusion when he was severely injured by a junior.

“Jiang Gu has lost,” someone whispered.

They knew that from today onwards, Qin Yu would definitely be the focus of everyone’s attention. There would even be countless people trying to join his sect.

If he wanted to, he might be able to replace the Jiang family.

“Qin Yu... actually won...” Hong Wu was a little excited.

Although his cultivation base had been crippled, he couldn’t help but be happy when he saw Qin Yu win.

“This kid is definitely a top-notch genius. Given some time, it’s not impossible for him to go to Jingdu to compete with the disciples of the aristocratic families.” fanaticism flashed in Yan Jiang’s eyes.

Such a genius couldn’t be wasted!

“From today onwards, I will definitely watch him grow to the peak.” Yan Jiang made up his mind.

Previously, he had protected Qin Yu purely because of the Yan family’s orders.

But now, Yan Jiang was willing to see Qin Yu stand at the peak!

“Jiang Gu, take care of yourself,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu moved his body and walked toward the crowd with difficulty.

“Mr. Qin, please get in the car.” Hong Wu walked forward quickly and helped Qin Yu into the car.

While he was sitting in the car, a smile finally appeared on Qin Yu’s face.

He used his last bit of strength to send a message to Yan Ruoxue.

“Ruoxue, I won.”

After sending this text message, Qin Yu fainted.

Because of his physical exhaustion, he urgently needed to rest.

...

The news of Jiang Gu’s defeat quickly spread throughout Chuzhou.

Although Jiang Gu didn’t die, he was severely injured because of it.

This result was beyond everyone’s imagination.

Even people in Jiangcheng found out about this matter.

“Mr. Qin really won!” Lei Hu jumped up in excitement!

The merchants who betrayed Qin Yu, however, felt a trace of worry.

They even held a private meeting to decide whether or not to leave Jiangcheng.

After much consideration, they still couldn’t let go of Jiangcheng’s business opportunities.

“Qin Yu is a soft-hearted person. As long as we apologize, I think he won’t hold us accountable.” Everyone came to an agreement.

Because of this, the Jiang family suffered a heavy blow. In contras, Qin Yu became a big shot in Chuzhou.

Countless people came to him because of the incident. Many big families even wanted to spend a high price to obtain Qin Yu’s protection.

In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.

Jiang Gu’s body was tightly wrapped as he laid on the bed and couldn’t move at all.

“Master...” Mr. Zhong looked extremely sorrowful.

He knelt on the ground and said resentfully, “Master, we can’t let Qin Yu off!”

How could Jiang Gu not want to take revenge?

But now that he couldn’t even move, what could he do?

“Master, since we can’t defeat him through martial arts, then we’ll use the Jiang family’s connections to get rid of Qin Yu!” Viciousness flashed in Mr. Zhong’s eyes!

Jiang Gu seemed to understand Mr. Zhong’s meaning. He blinked his eyes to express his agreement.

Mr. Zhong immediately got up and walked out of the ward.

He took out his cell phone and made a call.

“Send someone to capture Qin Yu immediately!” Mr. Zhong said coldly.

No matter how good his martial arts skills were, in modern society, one couldn’t go against the authorities!

And no one could resist modern firearms!
