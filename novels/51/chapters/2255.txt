2256 The Fury of Fire

“No wonder. The Soul-hunting Bell itself is a tribulation magical artifact, and coupled with Master Suo Lin’s refinement, it can create such a terrifying effect!”

“I already felt something wrong just now. That giant shield instantly absorbed all the spiritual power of fire in the surroundings. What a terrifying magical artifact!”

The surrounding cultivators were completely stunned. These few people almost had the highest combat strength of the Azure Firmament Sect, but they lost their combat strength under Qin Yu’s single attack.

“However, his cultivation is limited. No matter how powerful his magical artifact is, he still needs his spiritual power to use it. This kind of attack shouldn’t last long.”

The person who spoke was Nangong Qi, and Shui Yuan exchanged a glance with him.

After that, the people of the Mysterious Dark Sect retreated one after another.

Some surrounding cultivators had strange expressions when they heard Nangong Qi’s words.

They were all carefully watching how the situation would develop.

“Well, well, well! I want to see how arrogant you are!”

Ming Yue shouted word by word.

The green soul sea suddenly spread out, and the soul punishment like a poisonous snake suddenly attacked Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

However, in just an instant, a terrifying beast roar emitted from Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness barrier, coupled with a soul-hunting sound.

Almost all of the attacks disappeared without a trace.

“Slap!”

The surging spiritual energy suddenly struck Qin Yu’s chest, sending him flying. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Seeing her soul domain was useless, Minh Yue directly used the power of the cultivation realm to suppress him.

“I’ll make you understand the difference between the third and the eighth grade.”

Her figure was agile, and as she dodged, she casually kicked and waved her hand.

The spiritual energy condensed around her rapidly and then shot out.

The terrifying strength of an eighth-grade True Saint revealed. With a violent rumble, the space around Qin Yu collapsed.

Dozens of cultivators were accidentally caught in it and instantly turned into meat pies.

“This old lady has gone crazy. Quickly retreat!”

The surrounding cultivators retreated frantically.

“Just this?”

Under the protection of Suo Lin’s shield, these attacks only caused some slight trembling.

The power of the fire element gathered around Qin Yu. Behind Qin Yu, nine enormous streams of lava shot up into the sky.

Under Qin Yu’s control, the lava twisted and spun in the air.

As he pointed with the finger of his left hand, nine fiery dragon-like streams of lava fell on Ming Yue’s head like a waterfall.

“Ah!”

Ming Yue pushed up with both hands and released the spiritual energy in her hands to the limit.

With a flash of light, the nine fire dragons finally shattered.

Countless burning lava turned into rocks and fell to the ground. The Fire Qilin Continent was a scene of the end of the world.

“Just this?”

Qin Yu stared at Ming Yue coldly.

“I’d like to see how many more times you can use this attack.”

Ming Yue’s hair was messy, face covered with dirt, and her hands trembled slightly. She had used all her strength to defeat those nine giant dragons.

“You will see it soon.”

Qin Yu clenched his fist tightly, and a giant fist shadow slowly shaped up in the void. The air was full of white fog.

The remaining water in the surroundings evaporated by the high temperature of the fist shadow, forming an absolute fire space.

The high-temperature lava on the fist shadow flowed slowly. With a boom, the giant fist smashed out like a sword light.

Half of Ming Yue’s shoulder melted in an instant. She looked at her shoulder, startling and heart-wrenching.

She was also a cultivator who had survived the blood sea. The moment the fist shadow had just appeared, she subconsciously avoided it. Otherwise, her head might have melted right now.

“Now, it’s my turn!”

Ming Yue gritted her teeth, and her voice filled with hatred.

A rope stretched out from the void and tied Qin Yu’s left hand as soon as he attacked.

The ropes suddenly lit up with a scorching white light.

An inexplicable shackling force extended from the void, causing his entire body to suddenly freeze.

“Immortal Binding Rope!”

“This guy is in trouble. His spiritual power has been locked. I’m afraid he can’t use his divine artifact.”

…

“Go to hell!”

Ming Yue stepped into the air and flew up, her body suddenly arriving before Qin Yu.

Her palm had already landed on Qin Yu’s body, and her aura had instantly risen to the peak. All of the spiritual power in her body exploded without reservation, and the terrifying spiritual energy fluctuation caused the entire space to tremble.

In an instant, her fists and kicks bombarded Qin Yu’s body. With each strike, the crust of the Fire Unicorn Continent emitted a dull sound.

It was as if thunder had struck the entire continent, and the spiritual power of an eighth-grade True Saint had reached its limit.

“Huff, huff, huff!”

Ming Yue’s face was pale as she panted heavily.

“What a terrifying strength! This old lady is so strong. She’s already at the peak of the True Saint Realm, isn’t she?”

“Master, it seems that Qin Yu will die without a doubt. Let’s forget about this divine artifact. He’s too strong!”

Nangong Qi looked at Shui Yuan and said reluctantly.

“I swore to the Path of Heaven that I would not attack here. The old lady was also risking her life. It would take a long time for her to recover. Moreover, her helpers in the surroundings were all gone.”

Shui Yuan’s expression was dark and stern, and a glint flashed in his eyes.

“Moreover, other rogue cultivators will definitely make a move later!”

Nangong Qi sneered.

The entire space was engulfed in rolling dust and smoke, and it was not until the dust settled that…

Many cultivators saw a person stepping into the void with nine fire dragons floating behind him.

“Qin Yu?”

Ming Yue’s face revealed a look of disbelief.

Fresh blood flowed out from the corner of Qin Yu’s mouth. He only suffered a slight injury in the desperate attack of an eighth grade.

His body had become incredibly tough after being refined by the bone cultivation water and the most intense lava.

Even if he could not use his spiritual power, Suo Lin could feel his danger and form a protective shield around him, which also blocked a lot of the power.

“You can die now!”

The nine fire dragons carried Qin Yu to Ming Yue, and the lava dragon bombarded her.

Ming Yue did not even have the intention to resist. Her face was ashen as if she did not understand what had happened.

Her body instantly turned into ashes, and Qin Yu grabbed her divine sense figurine and threw it into the Sumeru Space.

At this moment, he did not show mercy to the severely injured cultivators of the Azure Firmament Sect. He killed them all with a punch!

He looked coldly at the surrounding cultivators. He did not feel the pleasure of his strength rising.

It was something that his father had exchanged with his life!

At this moment, Fire Unicorn Continent was deadly silent.

A third grade against the eighth grade and the eighth grade defeated just like that?

To reach the True Saint Realm, one had to accumulate experience over a long time before they could step into it.

At that time, the spiritual essence of the entire Black Platform Continent had only allowed Qin Yu to advance by one grade.

But at this moment, Qin Yu had broken the way.

“Is the Suo Lin Divine Artifact that powerful? It actually helped a third-grade cultivator defeat an eighth-grade cultivator!”

“As expected of a divine weapon forged by Master Suo Lin with his life!”

“Brat, if you have the guts to put down the divine artifact and have a duel between men with me, I’d like to ask you if you dare.”

At that moment, some shameless people began to clamor.
