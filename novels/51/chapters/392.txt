This caught Qin Yu’s attention.

He immediately opened the thread and a ranking list appeared before his eyes.

What surprised Qin Yu was that the person ranked first wasn’t him, but a person called Zhong Cheng.

This person’s battle record was quite impressive. It was said that he had defeated several Inner Strength Grandmasters while in the Inner Strength Past Master realm.

And now, he had already successfully stepped into the Inner Strength Grandmaster realm. He was said to be the number one genius in the Central Plains.

Although he didn’t have sensational deeds like Qin Yu, who forcefully broke through the stairway to heaven, his foundation was extremely solid. His personality was also quite easygoing, in contrast to the arrogant Qin Yu.

Most importantly, he had a famous master. It was said that this person was once the number one person in the Central Plains. His name was He Teng.

Qin Yu continued reading, but he wasn’t ranked second or third either.

Qin Yu was ranked fifth.

And behind Qin Yu was Fang Yue.

Other than Fang Yue, Qin Yu saw another familiar person.

This person was Jing Lu.

“I’m actually ranked fifth?” Qin Yu rubbed his chin.

Logically speaking, he shouldn’t be. With the battle record of a peak Inner Strength Past Master killing three peak Inner Strength Grandmasters, he outshone many people, right?

As he continued reading, he could see the analysis of this ranking, especially analysis of his ranking.

“The reason why Qin Yu is ranked fifth is because he has too many enemies. The probability of him progressing is low. If this factor is disregarded, he should be able to enter the top three.”

Seeing this reason, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh.

Naturally, Qin Yu didn’t agree with this ranking.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly felt waves of internal qi pass by outside.

Although the internal qi wasn’t strong, it was at the level of an Inner Strength Grandmaster.

Before Qin Yu could react, there was a knock on the door.

“Is Mr. Qin at home?” An old man’s voice sounded.

Qin Yu stood up and opened the door. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Two men stood outside the door. One was old and the other was young. The older one was probably in his fifties, while the younger one was only in his early twenties.

“You are?” Qin Yu sized up the two and asked.

The old man took out his business card and said politely, “You are the King of Chuzhou, Qin Yu, right? This is my business card.”

After taking the business card, Qin Yu found out that this person was the president of the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association, Guan Jiarong.

“The president of the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association?” Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but smile coldly.

This jerk came quite quickly.

“Please come in.” Qin Yu moved aside and let the two people walk in.

After sitting down, Guan Jiarong politely explained, “Mr. Qin, I’m really sorry to have borrowed your place without your permission.”

Qin Yu sneered. “President Guan, you don’t have to say these insincere words.”

Guan Jiarong sighed and said, “Actually, I don’t want to either, but you know that as the president of the Jiang Bei region, I have to contribute to the development of our Association.”

“So, I’ve traveled almost half of the Jiang Bei region over the years just to find a suitable place for cultivation for the members of our Association to use.”

“So you found my home? And you broke in without my consent?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Guan Jiarong apologized again, “I’m really sorry. I hope you can understand my good intentions. Everything I did was for the development of the Association.”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything, but he couldn’t stop laughing coldly inside.

“Mr. Qin, you are now the pride of the Jiang Bei region. It’s not an exaggeration to say that you are the King of Jiang Bei!”

Seeing that Qin Yu didn’t say anything, Guan Jiarong flattered him.

If this was an ordinary person, he would definitely be wooed by his flattery.

But unfortunately, Qin Yu didn’t fall for it at all.

“President Guan, I’ve set up a spiritual energy gathering formation here, and I’ve accumulated nearly a year’s worth of spiritual energy,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Now that the spiritual energy has been depleted, how should we settle this debt?” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Guan Jiarong was silent for a moment and said, “How about this? The position of vice president of Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association is still vacant. I wonder if Mr. Qin is interested?”

“Vice president?” This surprised Qin Yu.

Guan Jiarong said, “Yes. To tell you the truth, I’ve wanted to invite you for a long time, but I haven’t had the chance.”

As the saying went, one should never be hostile towards someone friendly.. Guan Jiarong’s attitude really made it hard for people to hold a grudge.

However, Qin Yu didn’t want to join this kind of organization at all.

Therefore, Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Forget about that. How about this, you give me a stalk of hundred-year-old herbs, and let’s forget about this matter.”

Qin Yu didn’t lack hundred-year-old herbs.

The reason why he said this was to give Guan Jiarong a small lesson.

However, Guan Jiarong couldn’t help but frown while looking rather troubled.

“The spiritual energy in my spiritual energy gathering formation isn’t something a hundred-year-old herb can compare to. President Guan, don’t you know?” Qin Yu’s tone carried some displeasure.

“Do you really think you’re some big shot?” At this moment, the young man beside Guan Jiarong suddenly said impatiently.

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately looked at him coldly.

The young man continued, “To tell you the truth, there are at least a hundred vice presidents in the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association. It’s just an empty position. Do you really take yourself that seriously?”

“You’re lucky that the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association can invite you. Do you understand?”

Qin Yu looked at Guan Jiarong and said coldly, “President Guan, do you think so too?”

Guan Jiarong frowned and said, “Mr. Qin, I have no such intention.”

“President Guan, I’m not going to argue with you on account of your hard work for the development of the Association. Don’t tell me you can’t bear to part with just a hundred-year-old herb?” Qin Yu said with a cold expression.

Guan Jiarong stood up and said with a smile, “Alright then. I’ll send it to you in the future. Goodbye.”

After saying this, Guan Jiarong turned around and left.

After he left, his expression instantly turned cold.

“You want herbs? Dream on!” Guan Jiarong spat on the ground.

Not long after Guan Jiarong left, Jiang Gu drove to this place.

After he entered the door, he said excitedly, “Mr. Qin, you’re back.”

Qin Yu nodded. He glanced at Jiang Gu and said, “Do you know about the Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association’s requisition of this place?”

Jiang Gu was stunned and said with a wry smile, “I knew, but... I couldn’t stop it. The Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association has always been overbearing. I was angry, but I didn’t dare to say anything.”

“Always been overbearing?” Qin Yu frowned.

“Yes, especially President Guan Jiarong. He used his identity to occupy land everywhere. I don’t know how many people have been oppressed by him,” said Jiang Gu.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel shocked when he heard this.

“He doesn’t look like such a person. How could a president who wants to develop the Martial Arts Association do such a thing?” Qin Yu asked in puzzlement.

Hearing this, Jiang Gu couldn’t help but sneer. “Develop the Martial Arts Association? Mr. Qin, you think too highly of Guan Jiarong.”

“He is just using the name of the Martial Arts Association to seek benefits for his son. The Jiang Bei Martial Arts Association has already become their family’s private business. All the good things have been monopolized by him.”

“Just like this place. After he occupied it, he let his son cultivate. Unfortunately, his son is a useless fool.”
