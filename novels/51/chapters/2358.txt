2359 Tribulation Transcending Stage

“It doesn’t matter, be it if he’s dead. If we can obtain the Xuanyuan Sword, it’s worth it even if it takes the lives of ten Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators,” Yan Yunfan sneered and said.

And in the center of the Ice and Snow of Ten Thousand Miles, Qin Yu was not the only one who suffered tremendous pressure.

The entire Sumeru ring’s dimensional space was also instantly squeezed by more than half.

Everyone resisted the terrifying pressure with all their might, but the Sumeru Space somehow collapsed.

In just a few seconds, only one spot was left for standing.

The power of this tribulation was on a completely different level. It was simply impossible to resist.

Xi Menn looked at the little girl lying beside the coffin and stood up gently.

He slightly sighed and stepped forward.

As he stepped forward, countless sword phantoms swirled around in the vicinity.

When Xi Menn appeared again, he was already by Qin Yu’s side.

An extreme sword intent soared into the sky, and he took another step forward.

The power of the ice actually began to tremble, revealing traces of cracks.

He slowly moved forward and actually forced aside the tremendously cold power of rules.

Then he suddenly flew up, and his body rushed into the rules of Ice and Snow of Ten Thousand Miles like a sword.

At this moment, he seemed to have transformed his body into a sword, and countless sword phantoms emanated from his body.

One became two, two became three, and three gave rise to external objects turning into thousands of sword shadows! His attacks were swift and fierce, with a momentum that could destroy everything!

The ice as hard as ten-thousand-year-old black iron also slowly retreated as if it could not withstand it in the slightest bit.

One sword could kill ten thousand armies!

One sword could break mountains and rivers!

Countless souls and vital energies on Xi Menn’s body ignited, continuously seeping into the sword he had transformed into.

From the Saint Realm, the Peak of Saint Realm, the half-step Tribulation Transcending Stage, and to the Tribulation Transcending Stage.

The entire world suddenly fell silent. The sword slashed down and seemed to have absorbed all sound.

After dozens of seconds, the violent sword energy exploded and swept everyone with terrifying power.

The power of rules of the Ice and Snow of Ten Thousand Miles directly slashed into thin air.

Yan Yunfan and the others were almost instantly blasted back by the violent sword energy, vomiting blood.

Even Teng Zixu retreated quickly and barely avoided this attack.

No one had expected Xi Menn, only a grade four, to enter the tribulation forcefully and unleash this slash.

Xi Menn stood in the void and sighed slightly.

The light of the Heavenly Path in the sky fell again. His body split into countless fragments and dissipated in the air.

“Take good care of my sister.”

In a small village with green mountains and clear waters, a young man was playing with a wooden sword. Beside him, a little girl was flying a kite and running around. In the distance, a woman was cooking porridge and waiting for her husband, who was hunting, to come home for dinner. Those were his best memories.

“Xi Menn.”

Qin Yu’s eyes were full of confusion. He did not expect that in the end, it was Xi Menn who saved them.

He held back his sobbing emotions. Under the Soul Torment Mind Technique, his eyes turned pitch-black.

In the sky, he seemed to have sensed that familiar yet the weakest sword intent.

He could not care about anything else at this moment. He directly grabbed the scattered soul and then entered the Sumeru ring.

The Sumeru qi spread out and then passed through the crack slashed open by Xi Menn.

It then disappeared into the endless void.

In the sky, a furious thunderclap suddenly sounded. The Path of Heaven seemed to have sensed Qin Yu’s interference.

A massive lightning pillar, spanning tens of thousands of feet, suddenly struck in the direction of Qin Yu. Amidst the bolts of lightning, the entire plane directly collapsed and crumbled.

Even a slight graze by that lightning pillar would cause immense turbulence.

Countless living beings instantly turned into dust.

“Retreat quickly!”

However, the terrifying lightning pillar suddenly disappeared when it approached Qin Yu’s body.

A man stood in the void, his pale blue eyes piercing through countless planes, staring at the figure behind the golden gate.

After a long time, he gradually retreated into the darkness.

The person behind the golden gate let out an angry roar and left slowly.

…

On Qin Yu’s side, he actually sensed a terrifying energy attacking him just now.

But in the next moment, it suddenly disappeared.

However, he could not be bothered so much at this moment. He controlled the Sumeru ring and passed through hundreds of planes.

After that, the Sumeru ring slowly appeared on a desolate and overgrown continent.

Then he fell into a coma. In this battle, he had used his power to the utmost. At this moment, his nerves had just relaxed, but he could no longer resist the fatigue in his body.

Xiaoru and Little Fatty stared at Qin Yu nervously and frantically transmitted their bodies’ medicinal qi into Qin Yu’s.

Qin Yu’s body, at this moment, was even more miserable than the first time.

The battle this time had left him with only small sections of his spine and skull.

Yun Zhilan’s Ice and Snow of Ten Thousand Miles directly crushed all his remaining bones and blood vessels into fragments destructively.

“Let him rest well first. Now, he needs to relieve the fatigue of his soul first.”

Elder Guai stopped Xiaoru and Little Fatty.

Several of them sat on the ground in silence. It was rare that Jue Wu did not joke for the first time.

In this battle, they all realized they were as insignificant as dust and even unable to help Qin Yu share some of the pressure.

The rest lasted for three days before Qin Yu slowly woke up.

He circulated his chaotic qi and forced himself to grow a weak body.

After that, he came to the coffin with difficulty. A little girl curled up with a pale face.

Her body was trembling, and she was holding a bunny doll in her hands.

“Brother…”

Qin Yu’s eyes were slightly red. After this little girl woke up, how did he tell her that Xi Menn had died…

In the Solitary Cloud City now, the people of the Holy Region were also dead silent.

Yan Yunfan, Yao Xi, Ni Wuxiao, and the others were severely injured. The last attack from Xi Menn had not only broken Yun Zhilan’s attacks.

The sword-intent turbulence that erupted had also injured all of them.

“He’s really a terrifying person. He burned his blood essence and spirit to enter the tribulation as a grade four. Given some time, he would probably become another earth-shattering big shot. I didn’t expect such a swordsman to appear in a low-level plane like purgatory.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Teng Zixu sighed. This was the first time he had felt a life-and-death crisis from that sword light.

“Hehe, Yan Yunfan, didn’t you say I’m trash? This time, the Holy Region gave you all the authority to mobilize, and even Yun Zhilan gave it to you, but you still achieved nothing.”

Yao Xi sneered as he stared at Yan Yunfan.

“Shut up.” Yan Yunfan stared at him coldly.
