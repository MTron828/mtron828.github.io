Boss Zheng quickly came up and said in surprise, “Are we going to the Ghost Market Tonight? I’ve heard of the ghost market long ago. It’s said to be one of the two major features of Gu City!”

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Ghost Market? What’s That?”

Before sister Lin could explain.., boss Zheng said excitedly, “There are many strange and strange gadgets in the ghost market. Some are treasures left behind by families, and some are spiritual artifacts stolen by the servants of big families! “The treasures there are no worse than those in the auction! “There are even top-notch treasures!”

Qin Yu looked at sister Lin in surprise, as if she was asking for the truth.

Sister Lin nodded and said, “Boss Zheng is right. The ghost market is indeed magical, but...”

Sister Lin looked at boss Zheng.

“What’s Wrong?”Boss Zheng asked with a puzzled look.

Sister Lin sighed and said, “It’s just that you can’t go with us. We have very important things to do.”

Boss Zheng opened his mouth. Just as he was about to speak, sister Lin scolded him in a delicate voice, “Can you listen to it once? I really can’t take you this time. If you want to go to the ghost market, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or in the future, I can accompany you.”

Seeing that sister Lin was a little angry, boss Zheng couldn’t say anything more. He could only nod and agree.

“Alright, let’s go,”sister Lin said to Qin Yu. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qin Yu nodded and followed sister Lin out of the inn.

Boss Zheng sat alone in the room. He had an indescribable feeling in his heart.

For him, tonight seemed to be the last chance for the two of them to get along. It was also the beginning of the end of their relationship.

After hesitating for a while, boss Zheng finally followed her out secretly.

...

Qin Yu and sister Lin walked towards the ghost market. On the way, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sigh and say, “Sister Lin, speaking of which, boss Zheng is quite pitiful. I can see that he is a very simple person.”

“En, boss Zheng is a good person. It’s just that I don’t like him.”Sister Lin shook her head and said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu smiled bitterly.

He had often heard this sentence when he was on Earth. He didn’t expect it to be the same when he came to the holy region.

“Sister Lin, does that friend of yours really have the water of life?”Qin Yu changed the subject.

Sister Lin smiled. “If it wasn’t accurate news, I wouldn’t have gone to an Fenglou to inform you.”

“Phew.”Qin Yu let out a long breath. “As long as I can find the water of life, I won’t have to worry so much.”

Having been in the saint-level for a long time, Qin Yu wasn’t even able to cultivate. Every day, he would struggle to find the energy of life.

In his current state, it was impossible for him to go to the central plains, much less meet Yan Ruoxue.

After traveling for a long time, the two finally arrived at the ghost market.

The ghost market was a huge market, somewhat similar to the night markets of the mortal world. However, compared to the night markets, it was much larger and more prosperous.

There were small stalls and fixed venues in the ghost market.

The fixed venues were mostly local famous characters

As for the owners of the small stalls, most of them were not from South Province, and some of them were not even from Li Province.

There was no other reason. These people were all treasures stolen from big families, and they did not dare to sell them locally, for fear of being seen by their owners.

They had crossed an extremely long distance just to sell the treasures in their hands.

This was also the reason why treasures often appeared in the ghost market.

Qin Yu and sister Lin walked on the ghost market. When they saw the dazzling array of treasures, they could not help but be surprised.

He tried to open the wilderness divine eyes and swept his gaze towards the ghost market.

As expected, in the huge ghost market, there were countless treasures!

Like ten-thousand-year-old medicinal herbs and top-tier treasures, there were countless of them here!

For a moment, Qin Yu couldn’t help but be stunned, and her footsteps couldn’t help but stop.

Sister Lin seemed to have noticed Qin Yu’s surprise, and she said, “The waters of the ghost city are very deep. With your current status, it’s best that you don’t get involved.”

“En? What do you mean?”Qin Yu was slightly surprised.

Sister Lin didn’t explain. She just said, “If you believe me, then listen to me. Don’t forget our purpose of coming here.”

Seeing this, Qin Yu didn’t ask any further. She just nodded and said, “Okay, I understand.”

The two of them walked around the ghost market and finally stopped at the entrance of a shop.

This shop was called Shan Ma Lou. The name was very ordinary, and the shop was not considered big.

Through the window, one could see that the inside of the shop was dark, and there was only a very dim candlelight.

Sister Lin stopped in her footsteps and warned, “Qin Yu, don’t talk nonsense later. Listen to me, Understand?”

“Okay, sister Lin, don’t worry.”Qin Yu took a deep breath and said.

Sister Lin did not say anything more. She immediately pushed open the door of Shan Ma Lou and stepped into it with Qin Yu.

Neither of them noticed boss Zheng who was hiding in the dark.

At this moment, boss Zheng’s face was filled with panic and cold sweat was dripping down.

“Qin... Qin Yu? He’s Qin Yu? !”Boss Zheng stood there with an extremely panicked expression.

He was a relative of the great elder, so he naturally knew of the hatred between Qin Yu and the Heavenly Cloud Sect!

But at this moment, boss Zheng had never thought that the young man was Qin Yu!
