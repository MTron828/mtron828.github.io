As soon as these words were said, the atmosphere in the cultivation mountain immediately became a little strange.

“Saint Xiao, I know that you have some talent and some ability,”the man said faintly.

“However, this is only limited to the south region. In the entire holy region, you are far from it.”

“If we want to kill you, you won’t be able to escape death!”

Hearing these words, Xiao Sheng’s expression immediately became even colder.

He suddenly extended his hand, and his jade-like fingers grabbed his neck, lifting him into the air!

“Kill me? Do you have the ability?”Xiao Sheng’s voice was ice-cold and terrifying. At this moment, the entire cultivation mountain was filled with fog.

The other party struggled in Xiao Sheng’s hand, but he was unable to break free.

Just as he was about to suffocate, Xiao Sheng slowly released his hand.

“Don’t order me,”Xiao Sheng said coldly.

The other party coughed dryly for a moment, then stood up and said with a smile, “Interesting. You really have a character.”

“But let me tell you, if something really happens to Qin Yu, the consequences will only be that you, Xiao Sheng, can’t bear it!”The other party glanced at these words, then disappeared into the void again, disappearing without a trace.

Xiao Sheng did not have much of a reaction. He stood there and looked into the distance. No one knew what he was thinking.

Eastern wastelands.

This was a place full of legends. It was once the place where dragons came out. However, no one knew why, but later on, this place became an uninhabited place, causing people’s expressions to change when they talked about it.

Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing were lying on this desert. Not far away was the dragon burial cave.

“Do you think the desolation of the East Wilderness has something to do with the Dragon Burial Cave?”Qin Yu suddenly had an idea and looked at Zhuo Jing.

Zhuo Jing said with a wry smile, “Who can say for sure?”

Qin Yu lay on the sand, tossing and turning. He could not fall asleep no matter how hard he tried.

As long as he closed his eyes, the image of the dragon burial cave would appear in his mind.

“I really want to go in and take a look.”Qin Yu suddenly sat up.

Zhuo Jing seemed to have expected it. He said, “You can go in if you want, but I have to remind you that the danger level inside is beyond imagination. Once you go in, it’s hard to say whether you can come out or not.”

Qin Yu sat cross-legged on the ground and said excitedly, “I have an idea. See if it works.”

Zhuo Jing grunted, waiting for Qin Yu to continue.

Qin Yu said, “Think about it. When my divine sense entered, it was only erased after it had reached a certain position.”

“What if I maintain a certain safe border? Does that mean it’s safe?”

Zhuo Jing opened his mouth, feeling a little speechless for a moment.

“You really dare to think. Who knows how many variables there will be in the Dragon Burial Cave?”Zhuo Jing didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Qin Yu was already immersed in this thought and couldn’t extricate himself. He couldn’t listen to Zhuo Jing’s words at all.

“It’s settled then!”Qin Yu clapped his hands and said excitedly.

Having said that, he looked at Zhuo Jing and said, “You can go back first tomorrow. It’s too dangerous in here. Don’t come with me.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Zhuo Jing thought for a moment and said, “Since I’ve promised you, I’ll definitely go with you. Tomorrow morning, I’ll go into the dragon burial cave with you.”

Qin Yu said in surprise, “Aren’t you afraid of dying in there?”

“If you’re not afraid, what am I afraid of?”Zhuo Jing said.

“If something really happened in there, then I can only say that I was unlucky and made a wrong decision.”

Qin Yu immediately patted Zhuo Jing’s shoulder and said, “Thank you!”

The two of them did not say anything more. They immediately lay down and fell asleep.

What they did not know was that after they fell asleep, countless pairs of eyes appeared in the East continent and were looking at the two of them coldly.

...

The northern lands.

During this period of time, the elementalists had once again fallen into a deep sleep. The entire northern lands was extremely peaceful.

Sima bei was in charge of all matters related to the northern region.

In this cold and windy place, a figure was stealthily looking for something.

He came to a snow cave and quietly walked in.

In this snow cave, there were many treasures of the northern region. At a glance, they were like stars, flickering and shining. They were extremely dazzling and mysterious.

He Teng looked at the light in front of him and immediately walked up quickly.

He raised his palm as if he was looking for something.

“You also want to obtain the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect...”

That hoarse voice sounded in his mind.

He Teng snorted coldly and replied, “Who wouldn’t want to obtain the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect?”

Ever since he witnessed the battle between the elementalists and Qin Yu, he had become extremely interested in the inheritance of the immortal slaying sect.

Now that the elementalists were in a deep sleep, it was a good opportunity for him.

He Teng kept searching for something, as if he was trying to find the secret of this place.

“The inheritance of the immortal slaying sect... how could it be placed in such a place?”At this moment, that sentence rang in his mind again.

He Teng was stunned for a moment before he said sarcastically, “It seems that a good-for-nothing like you is still useful. What you said makes sense. Do you have any way to find the inheritance of this place?”

“No,”the hoarse voice replied.

He Teng snorted coldly and said, “Good-for-nothing.”

After saying this, he teng turned around and left.

At this moment, Sima Bei suddenly appeared in front of He Teng.

He looked coldly at he teng and said, “What are you doing here? Who let you in?”

He Teng’s eyes rolled and he immediately said with a smile, “As a divine king of the northern lands, I should have the qualifications to enter this place, right?”

Sima bei narrowed his eyes. He did not answer this question, but said, “He teng, you better not have any wicked thoughts. Otherwise, the consequences will be very tragic.”

“Lord Sima Bei, don’t worry. I am loyal to the Lord.”He Teng cupped his hands and said.

Sima bei snorted coldly and turned to leave.

At this moment, a figure appeared in the northern lands.

He walked in a hurry and quickly arrived in front of Sima Bei.

She held a scroll in her hand and respectfully handed it to Sima Bei.

“Lord Sima Bei, this is a recent harvest.”She knelt on the ground and said.

Sima bei took the scroll and then glanced at it, “Has this scroll been fully absorbed?”

“That’s right.”She hurriedly said.

Sima bei hummed, then took out another scroll and handed it to her.

“Continue. Remember, you must be careful,”Sima Bei said.

“Yes.”She took the scroll and turned to leave.

He Teng looked at her back and couldn’t help but sneer. “This person seems a little familiar.”

Sima bei glanced at he teng and didn’t say anything.

The next day.

Qin Yu and Zhuo Jing came to the vicinity of the dragon burial cave again.

“I’ll ask you one last time, do you really want to go in?”He Teng asked.

Qin Yu acknowledged and said, “Follow behind me later. If anything happens, don’t think about anything and run quickly.”
