Chapter 1212: Chapter 1,212, the body strengthening agent 

His spiritual power seemed to be endless as he walked on the surface of the sea and headed towards the west.

This seemed to be one of Jiang Yi’s cultivation methods. His current strength had already reached an unimaginable level.

But even so, Jiang Yi was still in no hurry to find Qin Yu.

He was quite familiar with Qin Yu’s life experiences.

Jiang Yi knew very well that Qin Yu couldn’t be measured by common sense. Fighting across realms was nothing to him.

Therefore, Jiang Yi had to be fully prepared. He had to make sure that as long as he made a move, he would definitely be able to kill Qin Yu.

“Before long, I will be able to step into the half-step almighty realm. At that time, you will definitely die!”Jiang Yi’s eyes flickered with a scarlet light, and there was a trace of madness on his face.

This speed of cultivation was indeed shocking.

Even among the top geniuses in JINGDU, no one had reached this realm!

It was not an exaggeration to say that in the current era, no one had stepped into the half-step almighty realm.

...

On the other side, Qin Yu was sitting on the sofa in his bedroom, playing with the three array flags in his hands.

The flags were dark yellow in color, and strange characters were carved on them.

Qin Yu searched the library of the martial arts association in Jingdu, but he still didn’t find any of these characters.

It seems that this array flag didn’t come from Earth, Qin Yu thought to himself.

Otherwise, it would be impossible for there to be no records, or even no clues.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu sent a picture of this array flag to the martial arts forum, preparing to collect it. He also indicated that anyone who provided the array flag or clues could ask him for a condition.

After that, Qin Yu stored the formation flag into the spatial artifact.

The next period of time was to wait for the formation flag or the arrival of the people from the holy region.

This period of time seemed like a period of leisure for Qin Yu, but in reality, he was still busy.

The nine transformation golden pill and Yan Ruoxue’s blood had yet to be completely refined.

Even the Twilight Qi in the Holy Mausoleum was still unknown to Qin Yu.

If he completed the remaining few transformations of the nine transformation golden pill and completely absorbed Yan Ruoxue’s blood, Qin Yu’s physical body would probably reach an unprecedented terrifying level.

Qin Yu planned to head to the first mystic realm to absorb the remaining blood and complete the nine transformation golden pill.

At this moment, ye Qing suddenly came to visit.

He was waiting for Qin Yu in the main hall as if he had something to do.

Qin Yu went straight to the main hall and said with a smile, “Commander Ye, why are you looking for me?”

Ye Qing stood up and greeted Qin Yu. Then, he went straight to the point, “I did find you here because I have something important to do.”

“Commander Ye, please speak,”said Qin Yu.

Ye Qing took out a document from his leather bag.

Then, he picked out a photo.

In the photo, there was a small bottle of green medicinal liquid.

“What is this?”Qin Yu asked in surprise.

Ye Qing said, “We just got the information. This is a special medicinal liquid recently developed by a Western Laboratory. It’s called medicinal liquid, but it’s better called strengthening agent.”

“Strengthening Agent?”This surprised Qin Yu.

Ye Qing grunted and said, “According to this laboratory, this strengthening agent can strengthen a person’s body. As for how many times, it is still uncertain.”

Qin Yu could not help but be shocked when he heard this.

As the saying goes, the rich rely on technology, while the poor rely on mutation.

In modern civilization, the power of science was incomparably strong. However, Qin Yu had never thought that it could be developed into a strengthening agent.

“This item has been used on many war criminals, but they have all failed. It is said that the bodies of war criminals are too weak, so they can’t bear it.”Ye Qing lit a cigarette and said.

“So they openly summoned martial artists to be volunteers.”

Qin Yu raised his eyebrows and said, “Commander Ye, don’t tell me you want me to be a volunteer?”

Ye Qing shook his head and said, “I want to pick someone from Your Heaven Gate.”

This sentence made Qin Yu a little unhappy.

Pick someone from the Heaven Gate? Treat a living being as a lab rat? Qin Yu couldn’t accept it at all.

“If we’re talking about physical strength, no one in the Heaven Gate can be compared to me. It’s better to let me go,”Qin Yu said with a gloomy face.

Ye Qing said with a bitter smile, “Actually, I think so too. I’m just afraid that you won’t accept it, so...”

“I really don’t want to accept it,”Qin Yu said with a gloomy face.

Ye Qing said in a low voice, “In fact, many people have already signed up voluntarily, including martial artists from our country.”

“I don’t necessarily want you to go. It’s just that this thing might be able to improve your physical body, which is also a good thing for you.”

“With your personality, you will definitely be willing to take this risk.”

Qin Yu was silent for a moment. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Ye Qing’s words were not without reason.

Currently, Qin Yu no longer had any spirit energy in his body. All of his methods relied on his physical body.

If he could improve his physical body, Qin Yu was indeed willing to take this risk.

Therefore, Qin Yu took this document and casually glanced at it.

The laboratory was located on an isolated island in the west. It was said that the name of the laboratory was Mad Man Laboratory. The products that were developed were all quite crazy.

“Mad Man Laboratory...”Qin Yu was silent for a moment, then he nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll agree. When do we set off?”

Ye Qing said, “Three days later, in addition to you, there are people in the military district who are willing to sign up. At that time, all of you will set off together.”

“Okay.”Qin Yu nodded.

...

On the vast western sea, there was a lone Green Island.

On the island, the sound of crashing waves could be heard from time to time. In the sky, there were huge unknown seabirds flying past. If one was lucky, one could even see extremely huge underwater creatures jumping up and then sinking into the water.

Such a scene was extremely rare. It was said that the people on the island had searched more than half of the earth to find such a perfect place and set up a laboratory here.

They employed soldiers and a large amount of military equipment all year round.

These equipment were not used to protect the island, but to capture undersea creatures and use their blood for research.

On the island, a group of people dressed as scientists shuttled back and forth in the laboratory.

At this moment, a person rushed over from the surface of the sea, leaving a long mark on the surface of the sea, as well as white waves.

His upper body was naked, revealing his strong bronze-colored muscles.

His lower body was wearing a pair of clothes that made him cry. He looked extremely valiant.

This person was none other than Jiang Yi.

“Improve my physical body? Interesting.”Jiang Yi couldn’t help but sneer.

“Qin Yu’s strongest strength is his physical strength. If my physical body is not weaker than his, what can he use to defeat me?”

After saying that, Jiang Yi strode toward the laboratory.
