Chapter 2464 Meeting an Old Friend Again

Qin Yu said with a frown.

“No, 300,000 people is too big a target, and the Sumeru ring also can’t take in that many people. If we directly move them there, and once the monster race army discovers us, less than 20% of the ordinary people can survive. It’s better to stay here and set up more bewitching formations at the entrance. That’s safer.”

Lei Xin looked carefully and felt that it was still too dangerous.

If they encountered an ordinary army, it would not be a problem for them to protect these ordinary people.

However, if they encountered an elite army like the two-winged or four-winged monster race army like previously…

Once they fought, these ordinary people nearly could not survive.

“Alright, Wang Feng and I will set up a formation nearby first, and after that, let us think if there’s a better way.”

Qin Yu felt a headache. There were nearly 1,000 True Saint cultivators and even three Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators here. They could be considered pretty good combat strength.

However, if the monster race army discovered them, the cultivators might still be able to escape, but these ordinary people would probably die.

In the subsequent half a month, under Wang Feng’s leadership, the concealment of this place had enhanced significantly.

Unless someone probed carefully with the divine sense above the Tribulation Third Level, it would be very difficult to discover any traces of this place.

After picking up 300 or so of Ji Yue’s family members, Qin Yu and the others were ready to leave.

There were still many members of the Jee family in purgatory, and they had to be brought back.

“Qin Yu, Flower Granny, Ruoxue, have you found anything amiss recently?”

Lei Xin hesitated for a moment before saying.

desolate divine eye.

“Dean, did you discover anything?”

Qin Yu’s expression turned solemn.

He suddenly flew ten thousand meters into the sky and unleashed his god-like desolate divine eye.

“Maybe I’m being paranoid. Anyway, I’ve been feeling a trace of abnormality that makes my soul very uncomfortable, and the monster race internal qi seemed to be lurking here.”

“Xin Lei, you entered the path with thunder, and your soul has the mark of the sea of Thunder Path of Heaven. You’re the most sensitive to the internal qi of the monster race, and you can sense it if there’s something strange.”

Flower Granny frowned, feeling a headache, too.

It was indeed very hard to hide among the alien races. There were only two possibilities for a monster race to remain hidden here, and even they could not discover.

One was that the strength was far exceeding theirs and even beyond the Tribulation Sixth Level. The other possibility was that the concealment methods were tremendously profound.

Eliminating the first possibility, the biggest possibility was the second.

“Dean, I’ll use the Heart of Thunder to assist you, and you try to comprehend it again.”

The Heart of Thunder in Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness suddenly lit up. Lei Xin’s divine sense entered the Heart of Thunder.

After that, with power dozens of times more, his soul power again traveled across the entire continent to investigate the abnormal situation earlier.

This time, it lasted for nearly a day.

Lei Xin looked cold. With the help of the Heart of Thunder, the abnormal feeling grew stronger.

But no matter what, he could not find the hidden monster race. He could not even detect a trace of demonic qi.

Qin Yu suddenly sent his divine sense into the Heart of Thunder.

Under the linkage of the Heart of Thunder, Qin Yu’s divine sense temporarily established a bridge with Lei Xin. He could feel the comprehension that Lei Xin’s divine sense had probed.

Numerous information surged into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness, and his terrifying divine sense began its deduction.

The Five Elements and Eight Trigrams in the Traceless Immortal Scripture integrated this messy information and then deduced it at an astonishing speed.

Numerous possibilities were eliminated one by one.

The areas where the demonic qi could hide were reduced at a speed visible to the naked eye.

However, this was not enough. Five massive consciousnesses entered it.

The Five Emperor Coins let out a deafening buzz.

In an instant, the deducing power increased by nearly 30 times.

Finally, after nearly three days and three nights of deduction, Qin Yu and Lei Xin locked onto a specific area.

In an instant, they showed up there.

“Who are you? This is the place the three lords cultivate. Anyone who trespass will be killed!”

The expressions of the nearby cultivators changed drastically. They had thought that a spy was causing trouble.

They unleashed multicolored treasures and instantly locked onto Qin Yu and the others.

Three vast and mighty internal qi exploded in the mansion.

When the internal qi subsided, three figures slowly appeared at the door. Qin Yu had seen one of them before!

“Master Chen Zisha!”

He had once seen this monk in the Crescent Moon Continent. At that time, this monk had brought him along to escape from the hands of the monster race general.

A few years had passed, and his internal qi had become even more unfathomable.

“It’s you, young friend. I wonder why you have killing intent?”

Chen Zhisha pressed his palms together and asked calmly.

There were also two Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators, a man and a woman, who also had calm expressions.

“Yun Huangshan.”

“Gao Lan.”

Black saber.

Qin Yu’s hand moved slightly, and the black blade qi exploded on Gao Lan’s body.

Gao Lan’s expression was cold. He put his palms together to block the slash.

“What do you mean? I don’t know where a few of you came from, but you attacked me straight away.”

Gao Lan shouted angrily.

The surrounding people’s expressions changed, and they also attacked directly.

“You’re courting death! A monster race spy!”

Yun Huangshan leaped high into the air and tightly held the saber in his hands.

The Splitting Mountains and Rivers slashed down at Qin Yu. However, when the saber landed, it struck a space ten thousand meters away.

Yan Ruoxue pointed with two fingers and locked him on the spot. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“What? Do you still want to continue pretending?”

Qin Yu laughed coldly and said.

The sound of thunder boomed as Lei Xin arrived in front of Gao Lan at lightning speed. The two fingers in his hand aimed and blasted Gao Lan’s head.

In the scorching light of lightning, the light emitted made people unable to open their eyes.

Gao Lan’s expression turned indifferent, and his entire body transformed tremendously.

The muscles on his body moved and expanded like pythons, and two blood-red horns slowly grew out of his head.

Lei Xin’s finger could only penetrate an inch of his skin and not any deeper.

“Boom!”

With a wave of his hand, a massive force slammed into Lei Xin’s chest.

Lei Xin was instantly sent flying by the massive force. Qin Yu’s power of divine sense activated the Spiritualization Technique and turned it into a gentle giant palm that caught him.
