Chapter 2847: Visiting the Place Again

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

However, even such cultivators had died in the Burial Heaven Cave. One could imagine how dangerous it was.

“Taoist Priest, is there any more information about this Burial Heaven Cave?”

“Those who can enter and exit this place are all top-notch cultivators. It’s challenging to gather information about this place. Moreover, I exchanged an item for a piece of information. That person is also one of the God Slayers. It’s the youngest daughter of the Alester family. She seems to have been seriously injured and is very likely to have died.”

What the hell!

Qin Yu’s expression was ugly.

The girl with long, icy blue hair had also died.

“Reiya, you can’t die just like that.”

Qin Yu clenched his fists slightly.

“Sigh! In the past few years, the strongest bloodlines of the human race have all died due to various factors. These people can be said to be the future of the human race. Could it be that this is the will of the heavens?”

Cang Yunzi sighed.

“Taoist Priest, what do you mean?”

Qin Yu asked calmly.

“Recently we had Jiang Shengling, Situ Qianxun, and Ye Kai. Whereas in the past we had the human Saint. One-third of the Nine Saints have been lost. This situation can only be said to be the fall of the human race’s Great Dao. Moreover, this world is also beginning to change.”

Although Cang Yunzi’s strength was above Dao Consciousness level 9, he could only be considered in the middle.

However, he had been living for a long time and had even reached the Five Declines of Celestial Beings, so his horizons were still wide.

Qin Yu seemed very interested in this information, so Cang Yunzi continued to elaborate on his views.

“The sixth level of tribulation transcendence is the position of the Saint Supreme and corresponds to the 18 Saint Kingdoms. The energy of the Saint Kingdoms is supplied by the power of the lower realm. This is not simple energy but contains many kinds of mental abilities. This includes the human race’s power of faith, the demon race’s power of destruction, and the demon race’s power of change in talents. These are all the corresponding powers of different races.”

“Originally, the human race and the other alien races had formed a balance, but now, the balance seems to have been broken. The space of the human race in the lower realm has been compressed to the extreme, so this change seems to have affected this Saint Kingdom.”

Cang Yunzi could not give a more detailed explanation. This was already the limit of his analysis.

“Let’s use the natives of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom as an example. Other than the three Holy Consciousness who have never changed, many geniuses appeared before this. However, all of this was suddenly cut off at a certain period. It has been a long time since someone who could change the situation appeared.”

Cang Yunzi stared at Qin Yu and asked a question.

“Do you have such a feeling?”

Qin Yu was shocked. When he heard Cang Yunzi’s words, he thought about it and realized that was the case.

The human race was indeed in such a situation. Even during the human race’s extinction stage, there was still an outstanding genius like Wu Ji.

On the contrary, the elites of the human race were constantly falling in this era.

Even Jiang Shengling’s righteous qi, which represented the peak power of the human race, had to ask the heavens because he had suffered a serious blow.

“Even the Holy Lord can’t stop such an unseen power, let alone us. Who can stop the wheel of the Path of Heaven?”

Cang Yunzi sighed.

“But there are some things that we have to do in order not to regret.”

Although Jiang Shengling knew he would die, he had still made his final move. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In addition, LEng Yuanxun had been following Jiang Shengling all the while.

There were also those humans who fought to the death to protect Jiang Shengling. They were all using their strength to fight for that invisible hope.

“Thank you, Taoist Priest.”

Qin Yu cupped his fists at Cang Yunzi.

“By the way, Taoist Priest, I have another question about cultivation. What’s the difference between a Holy Consciousness and a Dao Consciousness? If a Dao Consciousness cultivator fights with a Holy Consciousness, what’s the chance of winning?”

Qin Yu had never understood the relationship between the two, so he wanted to take this opportunity to ask for advice.

“If one awakens the peak power, it will determine one’s future position. For example, Chen Zhisha’s level 14 peak power is Endless Life, which determines how terrifying this monk is. Another example was Reiya’s invincible sword intent and Liu Bai’s big river sword intent. I think if these two were to fight the three great Holy Consciousness of the Dao Mystical Saint Kingdom head-on, the three Holy Consciousness would probably not be their match.”

“However, these two people are still in the Dao Consciousness Realm but their peak power is stronger than the three Holy Consciousness experts. However, the Holy Consciousness Realm requires time to accumulate and solidify the peak power until a certain quantitative change causes a qualitative change. Only then can one reach that realm. This process cannot be reversed. Even the most talented person can’t reverse this process.”

Cang Yunzi carefully explained to Qin Yu.

“It’s like a Vajra Saber clashing with a wooden saber. If there’s one Vajra Saber and a thousand wooden sabers, the result might change. This is the difference between a Holy Consciousness and a Dao Consciousness. However, the power of quantitative change is the most difficult to deal with. Otherwise, Saint Chen Shuang wouldn’t have had a headache at that time. It can be said that as long as the three Holy Consciousness don’t want to die, no one can kill them.”

Qin Yu nodded as he listened to Cang Yunzi’s detailed explanation.

Qin Yu also became clearer about the distinction between the two realms.

The accumulation of time was not a good thing for him.

What he lacked the most now was time. He was even younger than Reiya.

He didn’t know how long it would take for him to reach the Holy Consciousness Realm with the accumulation of time.

“If you want to go to the Burial Heaven Cave, I can refer you to someone. There is a group of outsiders from the Saint World in Lingxu City. They seem to be heading to that area as well. However, whether it’s dangerous or not will depend on your judgment.”

Cang Yunzi stroked his beard.

“Thank you, Taoist Priest. Then I’ll have to trouble Taoist Priest to refer me!”

Qin Yu was overjoyed.

Although he used the powers of creation to get here, the price was that all the peak power was exhausted.

He was afraid that he would not be able to use this power again in a short period, so he would not foolishly try again.

“Alright, I’ll get Wang Da to inform them immediately. If there’s no problem, I’ll immediately introduce you to them. This will probably take a few days. If you don’t mind, you can rest in the grass hut for a few days.”

Cang Yunzi said with a smile.

He was so friendly to Qin Yu because he owed him a favor before this.

If not for Qin Yu, he would not have been able to survive in the Heavenly Sin.
