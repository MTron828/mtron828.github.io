Lei Hu’s face instantly turned extremely pale!

He stared at the people around him while his eyes were filled with anger!

“What are you guys looking at? Isn’t that the case? You’re the one managing the factory.”

“Yes, there’s also Mr. Yang!”

Jiang Gu looked at Lei Hu coldly and said indifferently, “I just came to Jiangcheng, and I really need to find someone to establish my authority. You’re a good choice.”

Lei Hu swallowed hard. He braced himself and said, “Mr. Jiang, I believe that Mr. Qin will definitely come back. He...”

“Bang!”

Before Lei Hu could finish his words, he was sent flying by Jiang Gu’s slap!

“How can a stray dog be worthy of addressing me?” Jiang Gu said coldly.

Although he didn’t use much strength, Lei Hu was an ordinary person after all. His body was severely injured, and he kept spitting out blood from his mouth!

“Hmm?”

At this moment, Jiang Gu’s eyes suddenly landed on Lance.

He swept his gaze over Lance and coldly said, “You want to kill me?”

Lance’s body tensed up.

Updates by

His murderous gaze was actually seen by Jiang Gu!

“I am impressed with all of you.” Jiang Gu sneered.

“You’re just a lap dog, yet you actually dare to have killing intent towards me?” Jiang Gu flicked his finger, and a burst of internal qi instantly shot out!

“Bang!” A crisp sound rang out!

Lance’s knees were immediately shattered, and with a “plop” , he knelt on the ground!

When he saw Lance kneeling on the ground, Jiang Gu’s eyes flashed with contempt.

“I’ll use the two of you to establish my authority.” Jiang Gu stood up.

Since he wanted to establish his authority, he naturally wanted to make people feel fear.

Jiang Gu’s hands emitted internal qi.

This internal qi slowly flowed, and in the end, it took the shape of a dragon’s head!

This technique was the Divine Dragon Fist that Jiang Haoran had used before!

“Mr. Jiang is indeed a living legend! He actually has such outstanding abilities!”

“Mr. Jiang is a prodigy!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Everyone started to flatter him, and their faces were filled with shock!

When had they ever seen such a technique? In their eyes, this was simply a legendary technique!

Jiang Gu’s eyes were filled with indifference, as if what was in front of him wasn’t a human life, but a piece of grass.

“Don’t worry, I will hang your corpses on the wall tomorrow,” Jiang Gu said indifferently.

Just as he was about to activate the spell, his phone suddenly rang.

Mr. Zhong picked up the phone and took a look, then hurriedly handed it to Jiang Gu.

“Master, it’s Qin Yu’s cell phone number!” Mr. Zhong exclaimed.

“Oh really?” Jiang Gu raised his eyebrows.

He took the cell phone and sneered. “Qin Yu actually dares to call me?”

“He probably wants to beg for mercy,” Mr. Zhong said from the side.

Jiang Gu sneered. “Beg for mercy? If I don’t tear him into pieces, I’m not Jiang Gu!”

Then, Jiang Gu picked up the phone.

“Qin Yu, you...”

“Old fart, I’m warning you. This matter has nothing to do with anyone but me. You’d better not try to take it out on anyone else!” Before Jiang Gu could finish his words, he heard a series of angry curses!

Jiang Gu’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

“Qin Yu, do you know what you’re saying?!” Jiang Gu scolded.

Qin Yu said coldly, “There are at most 20 hours before I arrive at the provincial capital. Wait for me to chop off your head!”

The veins on Jiang Gu’s forehead bulged, and a murderous aura instantly spread out!

He had reigned in Chuzhou for many years, but no one had ever dared to speak to him like this!

“I’m at your house now,” Jiang Gu said coldly.

“You must pay the price if you dare to scold me,” Jiang Gu said with a cold smile.

Qin Yu didn’t panic at all. Instead, he said with a sneer, “Jiang Gu, to tell you the truth, I’ve left a mark on your son’s body. As long as I want to, he will be dead.”

“If you don’t want your son to die, you’d better wait for me to come back.”

Jiang Gu’s expression changed slightly, and then he laughed out loud. “You want to scare me? Do you think I’m scared?”

“You can try if you don’t believe me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you. I’m an apothecary. A mere mark is nothing at all.” Qin Yu said with a cold smile.

Jiang Gu’s expression immediately became somewhat ugly.

He coldly berated, “Alright, Qin Yu, I’ll wait for you! I’ll personally tear you into pieces!”

“In three days, I’ll go to the provincial capital to look for you. Wait for me,” Qin Yu said coldly.

After saying this, Qin Yu hung up the phone.

On the other end, Jiang Gu’s face was ashen. He looked at Mr. Zhong.

Mr. Zhong said in a sullen voice, “Qin Yu is indeed an apothecary, and he has mastered the Blue Spirit Fire.”

“Blue Spirit Fire?” This shocked Jiang Gu somewhat.

He had never seen blue-colored spiritual fire!

“Consider yourselves lucky.” Jiang Gu glanced at Lei Hu and Lance.

Then, he waved his hand and said, “Let’s go home!”

Jiang Gu and Mr. Zhong didn’t dare to stay any longer and quickly left Jiangcheng.

On the other side, Qin Yu was rushing back in a hurry.

The so-called “mark” was all nonsense from Qin Yu. If it weren’t for Jiang Haoran’s unrelenting attitude, Qin Yu wouldn’t have planned to hurt him at all, so why would he leave the mark in advance?

However, in order to protect everyone, Qin Yu had no choice.

In the living room, Lei Hu swept his gaze across everyone, gritted his teeth, and said, “You guys will get retribution! When Mr. Qin returns, he definitely won’t let you off!”

“Hehe, how long do you think Qin Yu can live?” However, these people weren’t afraid at all.

“Lei Hu, now that everyone knows that Qin Yu has offended Jiang Gu, and you are Qin Yu’s man, how many more days do you think you can act all high and mighty?”

Lei Hu’s expression was cold. He didn’t say anything. Instead, he stood up and left the Longhai Mountain neighborhood with difficulty while carrying Lance on his back.

Time flew by, and twenty hours passed in the blink of an eye.

Mr. Wu had been waiting for Qin Yu at the airport early on. As soon as he saw Qin Yu alight from the plane, he ran over quickly.

“Qin Yu, you are too reckless.” Mr. Wu shook his head.

Qin Yu glanced at Mr. Wu and said, “If I don’t come back, the one who will be injured will be someone else.”

Mr. Wu sighed. “Qin Yu, I have something I don’t know if I should say.”

“Which successful person didn’t climb up by stepping on others? Which one is truly clean?”

“For some people, being sacrificed is their destiny.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s face instantly turned extremely ugly!

He looked at Mr. Wu coldly and said, “Mr. Wu, in your eyes, anyone can be used as a tool, but in my eyes, it’s different. Everyone’s life should be respected.”

“In your high position, you should be more considerate of the lower class, and not feel arrogant and superior.”

“I hope that we have the right to question the strong, and not deprive the weak of their remaining dignity and life.”

“Mr. Wu, I don’t wish to hear such words again.”

Qin Yu’s few words left Mr. Wu speechless.

He seemed to find this sentence somewhat familiar, as if he had heard it before.

“Miss Yan?” Mr. Wu suddenly remembered.

At that time, Yan Ruoxue had said something similar.
