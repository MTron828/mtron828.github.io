Chapter 2037: The Tribulation Path Inscription Protection

Yan Guyun was naturally referring to the nine great aristocratic families.

Si Liuhe, standing at the side, certainly would not decline. He smiled faintly and said, “As long as I can get the chaotic body, I can give up on everything else.”

Yan Guyun smiled but didn’t say anything. It wouldn’t be so simple for the Si family to take away the chaotic body easily.

“It doesn’t seem necessary to send these cannon fodders. They can’t withstand the internal qi in the Chaos Grave at all. They also can’t find anything,” Yan Guyun said.

“What should we do then?” Si Liuhe raised his eyebrows and said.

“Certainly, we need more powerful people to enter.”

“Who is that person?”

“You.”

Yan Guyun’s eyes fell on Si Liuhe.

Si Liuhe narrowed his eyes and said, “Brother Guyun, are you joking?”

“Do you think I’m joking?” Yan Guyun snorted and said, “Since your Si family wants the chaotic body, you naturally have enough confidence. I don’t think you need to waste everyone’s time.”

Hearing what he said, Si Liuhe burst into laughter.

He narrowed his eyes and said, “Only you can say such a thing, but… You’re right. Our Si family has already grasped everything in the Chaos Grave.

“The moment the news of the Chaos Grave spread, the Si family had already made full preparations. After all, it’s not the first Tribulation Stage Big Graves.” Hearing Si Liuhe’s words, the crowd couldn’t help cursing secretly.

Since he already knew how to enter the Chaos Grave, why did he let so many innocent people die in vain?

“This bunch of b*stards! They don’t even treat ordinary rogue cultivators as humans,” Qin Yu cursed coldly in his heart.

However, the surviving cultivators all heaved a sigh of relief.

After all, they wouldn’t have to die in that case.

“Don’t waste time. Hurry up and enter the tomb.” Yan Guyun said.

Si Liuhe’s body shook, and streams of internal qi gushed out from his body.

A moment later, a layer of armor appeared on his body.

The armor was covered with densely packed path inscriptions that flickered with a strange light.

The terrifying internal qi emitted by these path inscriptions made people feel a trace of palpitation.

“What is this?” Yan Guyun frowned slightly and asked.

“An armor forged from the path inscriptions of a Tribulation Stage great cultivator,” Ji Liuhe said.

“With this item, you can enter the Chaos Grave?” Yan Guyun asked.

Si Liuhe sneered and said, “Brother Guyun, you don’t have to pretend to be ignorant. Ordinary cultivators don’t have the slightest chance to enter the Chaos Grave. We will be the ones who benefit in the end.

After saying that, Si Liuhe looked at Saintess Gu and the others. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

As expected, Saintess Gu and the others looked calm as if they were fully prepared for this.

Ordinary cultivators could not be compared to the aristocratic family in terms of mastering the information about the Chaos Grave.

Moreover, even if they knew everything, it was useless because just a path inscription of the Tribulation Stage cultivator was enough to stop nearly all the cultivators.

“You still need the blood of the chaotic body, right?” Yan Guyun said sinisterly.

“You’re right,” Si Liuhe clasped his hands behind his back and said with a faint smile. “In other words, our Si family truly masters the initiative. After all, only our Holy Son is a chaotic body.”

Qin Yu, who was not far away, heard it clearly.

The blood of a chaotic body? It was a great opportunity for Qin Yu.

However… Where could he find the path inscription of a Tribulation Stage great cultivator?

“D*mn it! My preparations for this Chaos Grave are still not sufficient…” Qin Yu murmured.

At this moment, his eyes suddenly turned, and a smile appeared on his face.

The worry earlier on instantly disappeared and was replaced with a confident expression.

Qin Yu indeed couldn’t obtain the path inscription of a Tribulation Stage great cultivator, but someone present definitely could.

Moreover, that person must have already detected Qin Yu’s figure, and he would definitely come to Qin Yu for help!

Si Liuhe and Yan Guyun’s words echoed in every cultivator’s ears. Despair immediately rose in their hearts.

In other words, they had no chance of obtaining the treasures in the Chaos Grave! Instead, numerous lives had been wasted!

The people of the nine great aristocratic families were like gods, treating human life as if it were not worth a straw!

“Besides your nine great aristocratic families, it doesn’t mean that no one can enter,” at this moment, someone spoke out.

“Besides your nine great aristocratic families, it doesn’t mean that no one can enter,” at this moment, someone spoke out.

Everyone turned around and saw an elderly man slowly walking out.

This person was hunched and extremely old, but his internal qi made everyone feel tremendous strong pressure!

Even Yan Guyun and Si Liuhe were shocked when they saw him.

“Elder Shi…You’re still alive,” Si Liuhe spoke first.

The elderly man called Elder Shi slowly appeared in front of everyone.

He was really too old, so old that he was like a piece of rotten wood and bone that would not attract people’s attention.

“Elder Shi… I heard he had reached the True Saint cultivation realm back then!”

“I didn’t expect him to be alive still. If I’m not wrong, he should be at least a few thousand years old now!”

...

“True Saint! Someone truly in the Saint cultivation realm has appeared!”

Even Yan Guyun and Si Liuhe did not dare to ignore the slightest of Elder Shi’s internal qi.

The two of them bowed slightly to Elder Shi to express their respect.

“Although the nine great aristocratic families are strong, it doesn’t mean you stand on the peak,” Elder Shi said calmly.

“For example, Dean Lei and Flower Granny of the Thunder Courtyard, Li

Yuchen of Wind and Cloud, Cao Tian of the Heavenly Valley, and so on.”

Yan Guyun, who had a proud and aloof personality, did not take Elder Shi’s words seriously at all.

“Hmph!” He snorted coldly and said, “I’m afraid most of the people you mentioned have already been buried. Take you for example. If you didn’t come out today, I would think you had been dead for many years.”

Elder Shi glanced at Yan Guyun but wasn’t angry. He also took out the path inscription of the Tribulation Stage great cultivator and covered his body.

Qin Yu remained silent. Of course, he knew there must be some otherworldly experts in the Holy Region, but he had never heard of this Elder Shi.

Except for Dean Lei and Flower Granny, the people he had mentioned were probably already dead.

...

As for how strong Dean Lei and Flower Granny were, that remained unknown. No one knew whether they could go against the nine great aristocratic familie

“The nine great aristocratic families are not overlords,” Qin Yu thought to himself.

Other than these people, powerful existences were probably hiding in the Alchemist Association.

Just as everyone was in shock, a figure quietly came to Qin Yu’s side.

He placed his palm on Qjn Yu’s shoulder and said, “Friend, do you want to cooperate with me?”

Even though this voice was extremely unfamiliar, Qin Yu instantly guessed his identity..
