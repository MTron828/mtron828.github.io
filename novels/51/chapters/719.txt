Chapter 720: The Vicious Granny Qin Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu’s expression changed. Granny Qin’s sudden attack left Qin Yu with no time to dodge!

Left with no choice, Qin Yu could only quickly activate the Saintly Body Technique to forcefully resist!

Granny Qin’s skinny palm slapped Qin Yu’s forehead.

However, what surprised Qin Yu was that this palm didn’t have much strength, and he didn’t even feel anything.

Granny Qin retracted her hand and said with a nonchalant smile, “Don’t worry, I won’t kill you for the time being.”

Qin Yu touched his forehead and said coldly, “What did you do to me?”

Granny Qin grinned and said, “Don’t worry, I only left a mark on your forehead to prevent you from escaping... Hehe...”

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly.

This old b*stard actually left a mark on him?

If that was the case, wouldn’t this old b*stard know where he went?

“Old b*stard...” Qin Yu couldn’t help but clench his fists.

Hearing Qin Yu’s curses, Granny Qin narrowed her eyes and said, “It’s true that I can’t kill you for the time being, but it doesn’t mean that I can’t do anything to you.”

As she spoke, Granny Qin’s internal qi became more and more dense.

Qin Yu wasn’t inferior to her. He also erupted with a strong internal qi and was ready to make a move.

Granny Qin’s expression was cold. Her internal qi had been brewing for a long time, but in the end, it slowly dissipated.

She snorted coldly and said, “There’s no rush. I’ll let you live for a few more days.”

After saying this, Granny Qin turned around and was about to leave.

After taking about two steps, Granny Qin stopped again.

She turned around and said with a nonchalant smile, “I heard that you did all this for your little girlfriend, Yan Ruoxue?”

When Yan Ruoxue was mentioned, Qin Yu’s body suddenly froze on the spot.

He took a deep breath and said, “You’d better not mention her name...”

Granny Qin laughed loudly and said, “Don’t worry, Yan Ruoxue won’t die, but she will be endlessly tortured.”

“You’re courting death!” Qin Yu immediately clenched his teeth, and his killing intent burst out.

“Hahaha!” Granny Qin laughed out loud again.

“It seems that Yan Ruoxue is really your weakness. I may have found a more suitable way to torture you,” Granny Qin said darkly.

Qin Yu immediately felt that something was wrong. He hurriedly moved forward and grabbed Granny Qin.

“What are you trying to do? ” Qin Yu asked coldly.

Granny Qin remained silent. Her body shook violently, and the terrifying internal qi forced Qin Yu back!

The internal qi of someone at the peak of the Martial Marquis realm was extremely terrifying!

“I don’t need to report to you what I’m trying to do,” Granny Qin said with a cold smile.

“But I can tell you in advance that your little girlfriend is in great pain right now.”

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely ugly. He was on the verge of breaking down.

And Granny Qin seemed to enjoy seeing Qin Yu’s pain.

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold, and his body was trembling slightly.

“The Heaven Swallowing Python... seems to be very afraid of the power of the Divine Dragon.” At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly said.

Granny Qin’s expression turned cold.

She narrowed her eyes and said, “So?”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “It’s nothing. That beast you raised has to be careful. I really like its tough skin.”

“If I use its skin to make a piece of clothing, it will definitely be indestructible.”

Granny Qin’s expression instantly turned extremely ugly!

She said coldly, “Just you? Blackie can kill you with just a raise of his hand!”

Qin Yu grinned and said, “It seems that you care about that beast very much... then you’d better be careful. If I get a chance, I’ll definitely kill him!”

“Are you deliberately provoking me?” Granny Qin said with narrowed eyes.

“I have to say, you guessed it right. Blackie is indeed my weakness.”

“But unfortunately, his strength is far above yours. It’s not an exaggeration to say that Blackie is currently the strongest person in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association! Even I’m not his match!”

“So, your words can’t hurt me.” Granny Qin’s face actually revealed a trace of pride.

Qin Yu nodded and said, “Okay, then we’ll see.”

After saying this, Qin Yu turned around and left.

Granny Qin looked at Qin Yu’s back, her eyes couldn’t help but reveal a trace of coldness.

And Qin Yu’s expression was also unpleasant.

Granny Qin’s words undoubtedly made Qin Yu even more anxious.

He had to think of all ways to find the Mystic Realm that imprisoned Yan Ruoxue as soon as possible.

However, Xia Hang also didn’t know the Mystic Realm that Yan Ruoxue was imprisoned in. He didn’t even have the right to participate in the Mystic Realm.

For a moment, Qin Yu didn’t know what to do.

The next morning, Granny Qin gathered everyone in the square.

She swept her gaze over everyone and said indifferently, “Apart from leading everyone into the Mystic Realm, the outstanding ones will also receive a certain amount of Bloodline Inheritance.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Hearing the words ‘Bloodline Inheritance’, Qin Yu immediately raised his head to look at Granny Qin!

At this moment, Granny Qin’s eyes happened to be looking at Qin Yu.

With a trace of a cruel smile on her face, she continued, “This kind of bloodline can raise the upper limit of a person. Once one obtains this bloodline, their strength will increase explosively.”

Yan Jinyao said with a nonchalant smile, “I have obtained the Bloodline Inheritance and have comprehended 80% of the bloodline.”

Granny Qin nodded approvingly and said, “Young Master Yan is indeed the person with the strongest adaptability to the bloodline.”

Everyone immediately began to discuss animatedly.

They had also heard of this bloodline.

“It is said that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association used this bloodline to create many powerhouses!”

“Those who can obtain this bloodline will indeed have their strength increase explosively! It is said that they can even change a person’s talent!”

“What exactly is this bloodline? It’s said that if it’s even tainted, it can be reborn!”

“I remember that the powerhouse who obtained this bloodline... seemed to have been killed by Qin Yu. Young Master Yan seemed to be the only survivor...”

“Looks like Qin Yu is also a person who bullies the weak and fears the strong.”

Everyone’s gazes turned towards Qin Yu in unison.

At this moment, Qin Yu’s expression was gloomy and his eyes were widened.

He clenched his fists and suppressed the anger in his heart.

Then, Granny Qin continued to laugh. “The next person to receive the Bloodline Inheritance will be Blackie. We will send him to the Mystic Realm to undergo the bloodline baptism.”

Qin Yu hurriedly raised his head and looked at Granny Qin.

She said that she would send Blackie to the Mystic Realm? In other words, Granny Qin knew where the Mystic Realm where Yan Ruoxue was imprisoned was? And she could enter and leave as she pleased?

At this moment, Granny Qin waved her hand and a scene appeared in front of everyone.

This scene seemed to be formed by inner strength and it was like a big screen playing a movie.

And the content of this scene was the scene of absorbing blood!

In the scene, even though Yan Ruoxue’s face was covered, Qin Yu could still recognize Yan Ruoxue at a glance!

Her body was trembling, and blood flowed out of the tube continuously.

Compared to the amount of blood extracted previously, it was several times more!
