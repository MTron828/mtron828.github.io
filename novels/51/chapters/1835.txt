1836 The Tribulation of the Reversion Void Stage

After hearing Chang Mang’s words, the people around him joked, “Chang Mang, don’t brag about your brother.”

“That’s right. We didn’t see anything special about him.”

Chang Mang’s eyes widened as he scolded, “You guys know nothing! His talent is definitely beyond mine! He’s not just beyond. In the entire Thunder Courtyard, no, the entire Holy Region, no one is comparable to him!”

Seeing how agitated Chang Mang was, everyone no longer harbored this topic. They only smiled without saying anything.

Time flew.

!!

In the blink of an eye, another month had passed.

Jue Wu had been hanged at the city gate for a month.

As she was already severely injured, she looked even more miserable after being exposed to the wind and sun for many days. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

To take revenge on Jue Wu, Li Yingying would send people to feed Jue Wu medicine every day.

This medicine could keep one’s mind clear. Its purpose was to make Jue Wu feel the pain and humiliation.

At the city wall, Li Yingying was dressed in white armor, holding a silver spear in her right hand and dragging a colorful ball in her left hand. For a moment, she looked very impressive.

At this moment, someone suddenly walked over.

“City Lord, a man called Zhuo Jing wants to see you,” the person beside her said.

Upon hearing this, Li Yingying’s eyes immediately lit up, and a playful look appeared on her face.

“Zhuo Jing? He actually came!” Li Yingying murmured.

“Tell him I’ll be waiting for him in the tea room,” she said with a cold smile.

“Yes.”

After saying that, Li Yingying turned around and headed to the tea room.

In the tea room, Li Yingying was brewing a pot of tea. Beside her, two burly men were playing the zither for her.

In a short while, Zhuo Jing came in from outside.

When she saw Zhuo Jing, Li Yingying’s eyes narrowed slightly. She smiled and said, “Brother Zhuo, long time no see.”

Zhuo Jing didn’t say much. He walked up to Li Yingying and sat opposite her. He said coldly, “Li Yingying, why are you doing this?”

“Eh? What do you mean by that?” Li Yingying said, pretending to be surprised.

Zhuo Jing’s face darkened as he said, “Has Lord Jue Wu ever offended you? Why did you do such a thing?”

After hearing this, Li Yingying snorted and said, “What? We haven’t seen each other for a long time, and the first time we meet is for that Jue Wu?”

“Li Yingying, don’t be too cruel!” Zhuo Jing scolded.

“Cruel?” Li Yingying sneered.

“Zhuo Jing, look carefully. The entire Nanzhou, and even the entire Lizhou, are now in my hands! I am the lord of Lizhou! I’ll do whatever I want!” Li Yingying said a little crazily.

“Not to mention a petite Jue Wu. Even if I want to kill all the people in the city, no one can stop me!”

Zhuo Jing took a deep breath, suppressed his anger, and said, “Li Yingying, on account of our past friendship, release Jue Wu. At least… don’t humiliate her like this.”

Li Yingying sneered and said, “Past friendship?” When you chased me away for Qin Yu, did you ever think about our past friendship?

“I’m telling you, I’m not only hanging her, but I’m also going to hang Qin Yu on the city wall!”

The more Li Yingying spoke, the crazier she became. And her eyes revealed an extremely vicious look.

“You’re hopeless,” Zhuo Jing said coldly. “I should have listened to Qin Yu and killed you back then.”

“It’s a pity that you no longer have the chance,” Li Yingying said with a vague smile.

Knowing he couldn’t convince her, Zhuo Jing immediately stood up to leave.

But at this moment, two people walked out of the room and blocked Zhuo Jing’s way.

Zhuo Jing frowned. He turned to look at Li Yingying and said, “What? You want to hang me up also, do you?”

“Do you think you can just come and go as you please?” Li Yingying said in a strange tone.

“Then what do you want?” Zhuo Jing’s expression turned even uglier.

“Leave your Silver Spring here, and I’ll let you go,” Li Yingying slightly narrowed her eyes and said.

Zhuo Jing took a deep breath and said, “Do you really have to be so ruthless?”

“I’m doing this in consideration of our past relationship. Otherwise, I’d have killed you for talking to me like this,” Li Yingying said coldly.

Zhuo Jing’s expression grew uglier. He clenched his fists, and a killing intent emanated from him.

But after a moment, Zhuo Jing suddenly relaxed.

“Alright. I’ll give it to you. But you’ll have to come and get it yourself,” he nodded and said.

Li Yingying didn’t think much about it and immediately walked over excitedly.

But just as she moved forward, Zhuo Jing suddenly took out the Silver Spring. The Silver Spring in his hand trembled and aimed directly at Li Yingying’s face!

Li Yingying’s expression changed drastically, and she hurriedly dodged to the back!

Despite her swift reaction, it was almost impossible for her to dodge the attack completely at such a close distance!

The Silver Spring brushed past Li Yingying’s face, leaving an extremely glaring scar!

The scar emitted a black internal qi. In a short while, it began to form a mark on Li Yingying’s face.

It also meant that Li Yingying’s face would never recover, and this scar would accompany her forever!

Li Yingying touched the scar on her face that quickly formed, and her face instantly became ferocious.

“Kill him! Kill him!” She shouted with all her might.

A large group of people suddenly appeared outside the room. They were all Reversion Void Stage cultivators from the Tong family in Zhongzhou. Their strength was terrifying!

Under such a situation, Zhuo Jing could not escape even if he had wings!

He held the Silver Spring in his hand and killed with all his might.

Despite Zhuo Jing’s extraordinary strength, he quickly fell into a disadvantage when faced with so many people.

After an entire day and night, Zhuo Jing used all his strength to escape from Tianyun Sect.

Even though he managed to escape from this place, he was severely injured and his whereabouts were unknown.

Li Yingying looked at the ghastly scar in the mirror, and her face became more distorted.

“I’ll definitely kill all of you! I’ll kill all of you!” Li Yingying’s expression was sinister, and her nails dug into her flesh.

…

In the blink of an eye, nine months had passed.

In these nine months, Qin Yu sat cross-legged in the immortal grace without the slightest movement.

He circulated the Meridian Circulation Technique and devoured the Huangji Buddha Flame at an exceptionally fast speed.

The brilliant flame had eventually become dimmer.

By the tenth month, there was only a glimmer of light left.

This ray of light seemed to have blended in with the surrounding environment. One would not notice it without looking at it carefully.

This also meant that Qin Yu’s devouring was about to end!

The spiritual power in his body was vast and he was only one step away from the Reversion Void stage!

One day in the eleventh month, the immortal tomb that was always in the day all year round suddenly began to be covered by dark clouds.

The dark clouds gathered in the sky, covering the sky and turning the day into nighttime.

Qin Yu, who was sitting on the ground, suddenly opened his eyes.

He looked up at the sky and coldly said, “Reversion Void Stage, here I come.”
