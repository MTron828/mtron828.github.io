Chapter 2562 The Way of the Human World

“As a member of the Human Race Watch, how can you underestimate my Gu family?”

At this moment, in the dark valley, a chaotic place for the monster race, countless powerful monster race living beings gathered.

A figure like God of War covered in blood was fighting in a bloody battle with a group of monster races.

These monster races were the Giant Titan and the dwarves, who had the most potent physical bodies among the monster races. However, Chang Mang did not fall into any disadvantage in the battle against them.

Amid the sound of fists hitting flesh, Chang Mang’s holy body shone increasingly brighter like a gem.

“Boom!”

Chang Mang’s body suddenly disappeared from its original spot. In an instant, thousands of Chang Mang’s appeared in the dark valley.

A bright domain appeared among the bodies. It was the light of the Divine Might Chasing Star of his holy body.

After that, as he laughed wildly, he broke nearly a thousand monster race’s necks.

Chang Mang, who received Immortal Emperor Yao’s guidance, had come to the depths of the monster race to cultivate.

“Qin Yu, I’m here! Hahaha, I feel a little too strong now!”

With a swoosh, Chang Mang’s legs kicked into the air. His body spanned thousands of miles away depending on the violent strength of his body.

At this moment, a graceful figure in the boundless void suddenly opened her eyes.

As she stood up, the void storm beneath her feet seemed to have transformed into a docile giant beast, gently supporting her delicate feet and speeding into the distance.

…

“What? I disagreed! We were born from the same bloodline, so why don’t we go and support them?”

In the Divine Will Sect, Shen Qian’s eyes were full of disbelief.

“This time, the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect is bound to lose. Zi Yang’s Way of Cosmic Luck is at its peak now. Given the sect master can’t help, whether Sect Master Chen Shuang can hold off Zi Yang is a significant issue. According to the information from the disciples, even Demon King Xiang Yu has been dispatched. Along with him are 2,000 nine-winged monster race army, 3,000 eight-winged monster race army, and the respective demon kings in the monster territories.”

A young man sneered coldly and said.

“The Path of Heaven of the monster race has long reached a consensus to wipe out everything for Zi Yang, but the human race is in a dead silence. Are we letting the disciples of Divine Will Sect fill this pit?”

Shen Rou’s body trembled. She could not believe what the sect had decided.

Gu Qingfeng shouted coldly.

“Then we’ll go by ourselves. You can’t stop us, right?”

Shen Rou said through gritted teeth.

“Anyone can go voluntarily except the two of you. The inheritance you have now is of great importance. It involves the power of the Saint and can even help the sect master. At the very least, you can only leave after the sect has studied it.”

Gu Qingfeng waved his hand and sent two talismans into their bodies.

Shen Qian and Shen Rou looked at each other and saw the helplessness on each other’s faces.

The factions in the Holy Region also dared not make a move when faced with the faint movements of the monster and ghost races.

Although the Saints who had attacked earlier were injured, they had the advantage in numbers. Therefore, the human race Saint dared not make a move at this moment.

As the dark clouds approached, more and more people gathered at the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect.

There were also people cultivating nearby other than the rouge cultivators from purgatory.

A group of people from the Divine Will Sect and Heavenly Divination Sect also came to their aid.

But all in all, the number of people was miserable. Sixty to seventy percent of those who cultivated nearby had escaped.

Very few people dared to move forward in the face of life and death.

“Go away! All get lost!”

Xuan Xin looked at these people and laughed self-deprecatingly.

He walked out of the barrier and shouted at these somewhat inexperienced people.

“Senior Brother Xuan Xin, we’re here to help!”

“I’ve told you! Get lost!”

A stifling fluctuation appeared on the Green Duckweed Sword in Xuan Xin’s hand. The 30-odd young disciples’ faces turned ashen. Their faces were full of doubt as though they did not understand why their senior brother was so angry.

“No, I won’t leave. We were surrounded back then by flame spirits in the periphery of the Misty Forest. You and Senior Brother Xuan Tian risked your lives to save us. Senior Brother Xuan Tian almost died at the hands of Flame Demon.”

“Senior Brother, do you remember us? On the Heavenly Origin Continent, you gave your only healing medicine to my son. Today, we are here to repay you!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Senior Brother Xuan Xin, I owe the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect a great favor. Our entire family received the protection of the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect during the chaos. Only through a series of coincidences that we embark on the path of cultivation. Although our strength is weak, we must do our part.”

“My name is Long Lieyang. I once received grace from Elder Xuan Gu. Today, I’m here to repay that kindness!”

“I am the Thunder Swordsman!”

“I’m Falling Without a Trace!”

…

The surrounding people chattered, and the noise of the people drowned out Xuan Xin’s threat completely, no one paying attention to it.

Xuan Xin returned to Qin Yu’s side with a bitter smile, no longer as imposing as earlier.

“According to the rumors on our continent, Daoism cultivates the Path of Heaven, inaction, and compliance with nature. Why do I feel that unlike the high and mighty Daoism, your Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect is filled with vitality?

Qin Yu asked curiously. Back then, the Three Purities Sect split up mainly due to this kind of friendship among the fellow disciples.

Therefore, during the internal strife between the three great Daoist sects, the Heavenly Master Sect, Righteous Sect, and Supreme Pure Sect had personal grudges against each other. In the end, it involved the entire Three Purities Sect due to the constant involvement of their fellow disciples.

It led to the deaths of a large number of genius disciples, and even the three ancestors were affected.

Daoism subsequently always upheld the way of simplicity, detachment from desires, indifference to emotions, and the philosophy of accomplishing without action.

“If I truly reach the state of complete detachment from desires and wants, I can’t employ this Dao to alleviate the suffering of the people in this world. What use is there in cultivating this path?”

Qin Yu was full of respect and gave him a thumbs up. He did not expect this quiet guy to say such great words.

“This is what Martial Uncle Zi Yang said. He and the sect master founded the Mysterious Heavenly Sword Sect in an era of friendship. Even Senior Brother Xuan Tian did his best to help others with the Dao he understood. They believe the ultimate Dao is inseparable from humanity, and what we cultivate is the Way of the Human World.”

Xuan Xin said softly.
