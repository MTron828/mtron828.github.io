1869 True Saint?

Faced with Qin Yu’s power, Tong Lianyang did not back down.

His old vulture-like eyes looked at Qin Yu coldly and then he shouted, “Little brat, you dare to come to my Tong residence! I’ll tell you today that the Tong family’s heritage is not something you can imagine!”

After saying that, Tong Lianyang shouted. He extended his palm and a black ancient bell appeared in his hand!

The moment the ancient bell appeared, a wave of Holy Power instantly spread out!

!!

Everyone was suppressed by this aura, and it was extremely difficult for them to even move!

This was Holy Power, and what he was holding in his hand was a completely resurrected Saint Weapon!

Previously, Jue Wu had also been captured by this Saint Weapon. Now, Tong Lianyang had taken out the Saint Weapon again!

“Brat, who’s sending who to hell?” Tong Lianyang shouted angrily.

Under this Holy Power, Qin Yu also felt extremely uncomfortable. His body trembled slightly, as if he was about to be suppressed.

On the other hand, Tong Lianyang seemed to be trying his best to end the battle. He immediately activated the ancient bell, and waves of terrifying Holy Power swept toward Qin Yu!

This Holy Power was like a ripple of water. It looked extremely slow, but it swept over in an instant!

“Boom!”

A terrifying sound exploded at this moment. The entire space collapsed, and the earth was completely shattered!

Everything within a hundred-star radius had turned into ruins. Everyone fled in a hurry, and those who couldn’t escape in time were instantly turned into blood mist!

This was the power of a completely resurrected Saint Weapon. It was extremely powerful, and it was definitely not something a Reversion Void Stage cultivator could resist!

Looking at the rising smoke, Tong Lianyang couldn’t stop sneering.

The same Saint Weapon would naturally display different power in the hands of different people.

Compared to Tong Guangqing, the power that Tong Lianyang displayed was much more terrifying!

“You reckless thing.” Tong Lianyang said coldly.

However, at that moment, Qin Yu burst out of the smoke!

He stood in mid-air, a magic ruler in his hand!

This magic ruler was also a Saint Weapon, a Saint Weapon from the Thunder Courtyard!

“You have a Saint Weapon, and so do I!” Qin Yu said coldly.

Seeing the Saint Weapon in Qin Yu’s hand, Tong Lianyang’s expression turned unnatural.

“You even brought a Saint Weapon,” he said, squinting his eyes. “It seems that you’ve made sufficient preparations.”

Qin Yu sneered. “Since I’m here, I’ll exterminate the Tong family once and for all. I won’t give you the chance to escape!”

Knowing that today’s battle would not end peacefully, Tong Lianyang didn’t waste any more time and activated the ancient bell in his hand again!

“Swish!”

A roar rang out, and the terrifying Holy Power spread out again!

Qin Yu didn’t dare to be slow. He held the magic ruler and waved it suddenly, and the same Holy Power instantly met it.

“Boom!”

The two terrifying forces collided, and for a moment, the entire space turned white, and nothing could be seen clearly!

Jiu Xiao and the others had already escaped a hundred miles away. They stared at the battlefield, and no one dared to act rashly. They knew that a battle between Saint Weapons was not something they could participate in.

The two forces collided and intertwined, and for a moment, they seemed to be in a deadlock!

Although they were both Saint Weapons, there was still a difference!

The Saint Weapon in Qin Yu’s hand came from Thunder Courtyard, so it was naturally more powerful than the Tong family’s Saint Weapon!

“Ah!”

With Qin Yu’s roar, the magic ruler in his hand was activated to the extreme!

The Holy Power burst out instantly!

“Boom!”

The magic ruler emitted a brilliant light. This seemed to be the true Holy Power as it crushed down!

Tong Lianyang couldn’t hold on any longer. He held onto the copper bell with great difficulty as his body trembled continuously!

“Boom!”

With another loud bang, the power of the magic ruler swept over directly!

Tong Lianyang’s expression changed drastically. He could only place the copper bell in front of him!

The copper bell became extremely huge in an instant and protected Tong Lianyang behind it. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Clang! Clang!”

The magic ruler’s terrifying power continuously struck the copper bell.

One hit, two hits…

After the eighth strike, the copper bell couldn’t take it anymore and cracks appeared.

“Crack!”

A crisp sound spread out, and the Tong family’s Saint Weapon shattered!

Tong Lianyang, who was hit by the backlash of this force, was instantly forced back dozens of steps. Fresh blood spurted out from his mouth, and he instantly became dispirited! His internal qi also became extremely chaotic!

“Dad!”

...

Tong Guangqing gritted his teeth when he saw this!

A trace of sorrow flashed across Tong Lianyang’s face. He sat up with difficulty and immediately looked in the direction of Qin Yu.

“You’ve even brought a Saint Weapon. It seems like you won’t stop until you get rid of my Tong family.” Tong Lianyang said coldly.

“That’s right,” Qin Yu sneered. “The Tong family will disappear from today on.”

“Do you really think you can get rid of the Tong family? How could my Tong family’s inheritance be broken in your hands?” Tong Lianyang said with his eyes narrowed.

Qin Yu had a bad feeling in his heart.

Could it be that the Tong family had a hidden power that was even more terrifying than a Saint Weapon?

“Qin Yu!” At this moment, Tong Guangqing, who was not far away, suddenly roared.

“I’ll return Jue Wu to you, and you’ll let today’s matter rest!” Tong Guangqing shouted with all his might.

Qin Yu looked at Tong Guangqing coldly and said, “The Saint Weapon is gone, so what right do you have to negotiate with me? Don’t even think about using Jue Wu to threaten me. Without a Saint Weapon, none of you can kill her.”

Tong Guangqing’s mouth was agape and he was filled with regret.

...

Meanwhile, Tong Lianyang was sitting cross-legged on the ground. He sighed and said, “I’ve lived for a few thousand years. I’ve lived enough.”

“What, you want to self-destruct? If that’s the case, the entire Tong family will be buried with you.” Qin Yu said coldly.

Tong Lianyang laughed and said, “Self-destruct? Hahahaha! Qin Yu, you’ve underestimated the Tong family!”

“The Tong family has a long history and has given birth to countless top geniuses. Do you really think that the Tong family can’t do anything to you? You little bastard, you don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth!”

As Tong Lianyang bellowed, a few drops of blood essence suddenly flew out from between his brows!

The blood essence merged into the void of the Tong family, as if it had activated some kind of formation!

“With my blood, I will resurrect the old ancestor!” Tong Lianyang roared repeatedly!

Upon hearing this, Qin Yu suddenly felt a little uneasy!

Resurrect the old ancestor? The Tong family’s ancestor?

Could it be that Tong Lianyang wanted to revive a True Saint?

If that was the case, Qin Yu, who was holding a Saint Weapon, would not be able to resist at all!

“Swish!”

Terrifying Dao techniques were continuously condensing and appearing in the sky above the Tong residence.

“Boom!”

At this time, a loud sound spread, and the ground of the Tong residence began to collapse. Countless auras surged out from the dark and gathered again!

Not long after, an old man slowly walked out of the thick fog, and his body carried an extremely terrifying aura!
