Chapter 1381: Chapter 1,381, entering the Heavenly Cloud sect

Inside the warehouse, everyone was hurriedly moving the goods.

Most of these ingredients were wrapped in ice crystal divine stones to ensure their freshness.

Even more high-end ingredients would use spiritual artifacts, which was enough to witness the heavenly cloud sect’s degree of extravagance.

Perhaps it was because of this reason that Ding Yi was hostile toward them.

However, Qin Yu could not figure out why boss Zheng dared to use him when Ding Yi’s hostility was so strong that he did not even try to hide it? Wasn’t he afraid that she would drug the ingredients?

“Hurry up and move it.”Ding Yi glanced at Qin Yu.

Qin Yu grunted in acknowledgment. He did not dare to display his amazing divine power and could only move it slowly.

The strength of most of the people who worked here was extremely ordinary. They could not even see a nascent soul stage cultivator.

They carried the goods to the demonic beasts and were driven to the heavenly cloud sect by people.

The people responsible for transporting the goods were Ding Yi and Qin Yu.

After about half an hour, the two of them were ready to set off.

On the way to the Heavenly Cloud sect, Qin Yu asked with some doubt, “Why don’t we use a space artifact to transport the goods? Isn’t that more convenient?”

Ding Yi snorted coldly and said, “A spatial artifact can’t guarantee the original taste of the ingredients. These animals know how to enjoy themselves better than you and me.”

Qin Yu curled his lips and didn’t say anything more.

The two of them arrived at the Heavenly Cloud Sect’s mountain gate. The guard in charge seemed to know Ding Yi, so he didn’t stop them.

This was Qin Yu’s second time entering the Heavenly Cloud sect.

His eyes scanned the surroundings.

The prosperity of the Heavenly Cloud sect was beyond Qin Yu’s imagination.

The number of disciples alone was probably over ten thousand! This was an extremely huge number!

The training grounds that could be seen everywhere and the heavenly palaces that were erected in the clouds indicated the strength of the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“The storehouse is over there.”Ding Yi glanced at Qin Yu.

“Don’t be too curious when you come to the Heavenly Cloud sect. Otherwise, you will be beaten up.”

Qin Yu grunted and followed behind Ding Yi towards the storehouse.

After placing the goods, Ding Yi pulled Qin Yu and turned around to leave.

“Are we leaving already?”Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Ding Yi snorted coldly and said, “Why? Do you still want to stay and eat? Do you think they think highly of us?”

Qin Yu remained silent. He had secretly memorized everything he had seen and heard along the way.

“I heard that there is a genius called Di Zun in the Heavenly Cloud sect. Have you heard of him?”Qin Yu probed. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ding Yi sneered. “Of course I know. Who in the vicinity doesn’t know of Di Zun?”

Qin Yu rolled her eyes and said, “A genius like him must have his own mansion, right?”

“His own mansion? You’re wrong. He stays in the great elder’s cultivation room all day long. Only Ling Yun has received such treatment,”Ding Yi said.

At the mention of Ling Yun, Ding Yi couldn’t help but curse, “That Ling Yun is the F * cking beast. In his eyes, none of us seem to be worthy of living! Several of our companions died at his hands!”

At this point, Ding Yi paused and continued, “Fortunately, that beast has already been killed by Qin Yu.”

Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to listen to him. Instead, she asked anxiously, “Brother Ding, do you know where the Great Elder’s cultivation room is?”

“How would I know? It’s not like I have the chance to enter.”Ding Yi waved his hand.

Qin Yu frowned immediately.

If they wanted to bring the others out, they had to find Di Zun’s position.

“Why are you asking about his cultivation room?”Ding Yi asked.

Qin Yu replied perfunctorily, “I’m just asking. I admire a big shot like the Great Elder.”

“What’s there to admire about him?”Ding Yi’s tone was filled with disdain.

Qin Yu smiled. “That’s the great elder of the Tianyun sect. He’s above everyone else. If he’s not worthy of admiration, who else is worthy of it?”

Ding Yi snorted and said, “In my opinion, the one who is worthy of being worshipped is Qin Yu. He wasn’t afraid of power and killed Ling Yun in front of the Grand Elder. This is the person who is truly worthy of being worshipped.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

He really didn’t know how Ding Yi would react when he found out that he was Qin Yu.

After leaving the Tianyun sect, the two of them returned to an Fenglou once again.

In the next few days, they didn’t go to the Tianyun sect to deliver any more goods. After asking around, they found out that they only delivered goods once a week on average. The rest of the time was basically free.

For Qin Yu, this was both a good thing and a bad thing.

The good thing was that he could take the opportunity to take a look around the Tianyun sect.

One had to know that the Tianyun sect was the number one sect in the southern province. The place where they truly held power was definitely the most prosperous area.

Even gu city could not be compared to them.

Most of the treasures were still in the Heavenly Cloud sect.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Qin Yu could go look for the aura of life.

The only thing that gave Qin Yu a headache was that he was worried that the heavenly cloud sect would suddenly attack them.

For a few days in a row.

Almost every day, people from the Heavenly Cloud sect would come to an Fenglou to eat and drink. Qin Yu also learned a lot of information from them.

For example, the latest progress in capturing Qin Yu, Di Zun’s cultivation situation, and even the location of the great elder’s cultivation room.

In addition to the people from the Heavenly Cloud sect, there were also the local high officials and nobles.

The entire an Fenglou could be said to be a bustling place.

On this day, Qin Yu planned to go out for a stroll and try to find the life force.

At this moment, a familiar figure appeared in an Fenglou.

Seeing this figure, Qin Yu’s heart suddenly trembled, he forcefully suppressed the excitement in his heart, quickly followed.
