2358 My Name Is Yun Zhilan

He had already made all the plans before coming. This time, he would not let Qin Yu have any chance to turn the tables.

“D*mn it, aren’t you very arrogant? Watch how I mess you up!” Yao Xi was clamoring frantically by the side.

Teng Zixu’s figure was like a ghost, constantly moving around and launching a timely attack.

Under this kind of attack density, even Teng Zixu felt a little strained.

Suddenly, he seemed to have comprehended something and raised his head, staring at the sky. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

In the distant place, an almost imperceptible five-colored iridescent glow appeared.

“The Golden Path of Heaven will descend soon.”

Teng Zixu said with a frown.

“Do you know the specific time?”

The people of the Holy Region were shocked. This was great news.

When the Golden Path of Heaven descended, it meant all the restrictions on cultivation would be lifted. At that time, it would be the time to fight for the Path of Heaven. When all the cultivators and monsters were in chaos, it was also a sign of great turmoil in the world.

“I can’t predict the specific time. It might be a few days or a few minutes later.”

Teng Zixu shook his head.

“D*mn it! I can sense a large number of spatial rifts forming in this space. Many monsters are attacking the barrier of the Heaven-sealing Orb.”

The expression of an elder of the Yun family changed drastically as he took out the Heaven-sealing Orb.

In the fist-sized orb, many monsters could be clearly seen frantically tearing at the spatial barrier. They seemed to have sensed the internal qi of many human cultivators here and thus were especially crazy.

“There are a total of eleven Peak True Sage monsters! The change in the power of the Path of Heaven seems to have weakened the planar suppression. The monsters of the monster race that have descended this time are even stronger.”

Yan Yunfan’s expression was solemn. These monsters possessed extremely formidable individual strength. Sometimes, they could only be suppressed by two human cultivators of the same realm.

“And according to the rules in the past, regardless of monster race or ghost race, they will have a leader. We haven’t seen the leader of these monsters yet,” Teng Zix said with a frown.

The others all gasped. If a monster leader that surpassed the True Saint was lurking around…

Even with their current setup, there was no guarantee that they could all retreat safely.

“Let’s end this quickly. We must get the Xuanyuan Sword.”

Yan Yunfan’s face revealed a ruthless expression.

“Yun Zhilan, it’s your turn to make a move. Before we came here, we had already sworn an oath to the Path of Heaven. If you die, your three sons will definitely enjoy the same resources as the inner disciples of the Yan family. Moreover, the nine families will join hands to protect them.”

“Don’t worry. Since I, Yun Zhilan, have promised you, I will definitely make a move.”

The man slowly stepped forward, his face expressionless.

He was a middle-aged man with a slightly hunched back. From his appearance, no one could tell that there was anything special about him.

The moment Qin Yu saw this person, he felt an extreme danger.

A hundred meters away from Qin Yu, a white light spread underneath his feet.

In the distant sky, countless massive white clouds appeared in an instant.

Even the Heaven-sealing Orb could not block the white clouds that appeared. They seemed to have appeared out of thin air.

Snowflakes suddenly fell.

The entire space became tremendously cold. Even Mei Li could not resist the chill that pierced the soul and began to tremble.

The snowstorm enveloped the entire Azure Ridge Continent, freezing everything beneath their feet.

In just an instant, everyone was frozen in ice.

“My name is Yun Zhilan, and I have three sons with my beloved wife. I was originally an ordinary person in the Holy Region, but my beloved wife died of difficult childbirth when she gave birth to triplets. In the late years of my life, I accidentally stepped onto the path of cultivation. I originally wanted to cultivate to the extreme and bring my beloved wife back. However, I realized it was just a dream when I reached the Tribulation Trescending Stage. Hahaha, Yun Er, I’m coming to look for you today.”

That person laughed crazily at the sky. Tears fell from the corners of his eyes and freely splashed on the ground.

The long years of cultivation were just for that thought, only to find it in vain when looking back.

Ice and Snow of Ten Thousand Miles!

He stepped forward, and the power of rules suddenly changed.

“D*mn!”

Qin Yu’s expression changed drastically. In an instant, he put everyone into the Sumeru ring.

Beside Qin Yu, ice as white as snow suddenly took shape.

It was a change in the power of heaven and earth. He was changing the rules of the entire world with his own power.

“Tribulation Transcending Stage Cultivator!”

Qin Yu’s face revealed an extremely shocked expression.

Despite the surging annihilation black fire, it could not break the ice that enveloped his body. In an instant, the ice had already frozen ten thousand miles.

The entire Azure Ridge Continent had turned into a continent of ice.

“Retreat!”

Teng Zixu’s expression instantly changed drastically as he retreated forcefully.

In the void, a golden Heaven Gate slowly opened.

A person walked out of the door.

The moment he appeared, everyone’s divine sense felt an immense pain. They simply could not look straight at this person’s true appearance.

Almost everyone lost their strength in an instant. Even Teng Zixu knelt on the ground and dared not move.

A green light shot out from his hand and entered Yun Zhilan’s body.

In an instant, his body turned into powder and disappeared. It was as if this person had never appeared in the world.

The Holy Region’s aristocratic family was actually willing to sacrifice the life of a Tribulation Transcending cultivator in exchange for this attack.

That person slowly walked into the door of light. Being suppressed by the ice, Qin Yu suddenly felt a piercing pain in his divine sense.

When the divine sense swept over him, a vast amount of soul power in his sea of consciousness evaporated.

At this moment, this tribulation strike was unleashed. Right now, Qin Yu felt as if he was enduring the power of the entire world. He simply could not withstand it.

His glazed holy bone emitted sounds of being overwhelmed under that terrifying pressure.

A minor crack slowly appeared on the holy bone, and then it continued to spread.

The bone-piercing chill seemed to have entered his sea of consciousness, slowing down his consciousness. He could not even think, and at this moment, he just wanted to have a good sleep.

“Crack!”

In just a moment, all the bones in his body shattered.

Even the glazed holy bone could not withstand the immense pressure.

At this moment, only his skull and spine were still struggling to resist the power of heaven and earth. However, his skull was beginning to have some difficulty enduring it, and waves of intense pain were directly transmitted into Qin Yu’s sea of consciousness.

The tailbone of his spine also began to crack.

In the distance, the people of the Holy Region were watching Qin Yu underneath the ice.

“What a terrifying heavenly might! This power was completely different from the power of a True Saint.”

Yan Yunfan could not help but gasped. He believed that he might die in an instant in the face of such power of heavenly might.

It was the power of two completely different cultivation realms.

“What a waste of the battle strength of Tribulation Transcending.”

Ni Wuxiao frowned and said.
