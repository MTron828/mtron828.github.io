2234 Teaming Up Again

“I obtained an ancient book in a secret technique space ten thousand years ago. Initially, the netherworld cultivation method was on cultivating the soul. However, in the past hundred thousand years, the cultivators in the netherworld have rarely heard of it. Do you know why?”

The man with the mustache looked solemn as he continued.

“It means that the cultivation technique of the netherworld has a strict restriction. You have to solve the problem quickly, or one day, you will be replaced by another divine sense. At that time, you might completely disappear.”

Qin Yu’s expression was a little ugly. He had previously known that this netherworld technique had some flaws, but he did not expect it to be so severe.

Moreover, another divine sense appeared and forcefully seized control of his body this time. This situation had never happened before.

“This is a problem related to the soul. If there’s a powerful soul cultivator, you can ask him if there’s a way to suppress it. Also, you must not use this technique again.”

Elder Guai said with a solemn expression.

“Yeah, Big Brother, don’t scare me anymore. I almost peed just now.”

“At this stage, I can only take it one step at a time.”

Qin Yu also had a headache. His father had left behind the Soul Torment Mind Technique but did not tell him not to cultivate it. In other words, there should be a loophole in this cultivation method, and it would not be to the extent that his soul would be occupied.

In the central square of purgatory, it was still crowded with people, and various noisy shouts and yells echoed incessantly.

There were all kinds of exchanges of magical artifacts or sales of pills, demon cores, and so on.

Although everyone was worried, it was too risky for rogue cultivators to act alone, so many people still formed teams before their actions.

At this moment, at one of the stalls, it was written in graceful handwriting, “Purgatory Seventh Level Operation.”

Qin Yu frowned but still went forward to take a look.

Hmm?

However, when Qin Yu got close, he felt a restriction before him and could not continue to move forward.

“It looks like a formation. Is this stall owner testing people?”

A cultivator asked curiously.

“It’s just a formation. Let me break it!”

A muscular cultivator punched toward the formation.

With a bang, his body was bounced back by the massive rebound force.

“D*mn it, if only I could use my spiritual power, I’ll instantly kick to shatter your lousy formation!”

The cultivator cursed repeatedly.

“Kid, sometimes muscles can’t solve everything. You have to use your brain. It’s obviously a test of your soul power. See how I shatter it directly!”

A young man sneered, waving a feather fan.

He walked up to the formation and felt the formation’s operation, then sneered.

“A mere bewitching formation. I’ll break through the main entrance and shatter the formation!”

He lightly tapped in the air, and a finger entered the main entrance.

“Whoosh!”

The formation suddenly lit up, and the formation entrance suddenly changed. It was a life-and-death change. The cultivator’s finger instantly shattered.

“Looks like your brain isn’t that good either.”

The muscular man laughed out loud.

“Is this stall owner toying with people? He’s somewhat disrespectful,” a cultivator frowned and questioned.

“He must be a formation master.”

The surrounding people were discussing animatedly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qin Yu walked forward and placed a hand on the restriction at the edge of the formation.

“Brat, how can you break a formation like this? Be careful not to crush your arms.”

“Another reckless brat.”

Qin Yu walked straight into the formation, and the formation began to spin violently.

“F*ck, is this kid crazy?”

“Does he think that he can use spiritual power? He’s courting death.”

…

A massive tearing force tugged at Qin Yu’s body, but it did not even leave a scar when this force landed on Qin Yu’s body.

“He just walked in like this?”

“Has the formation lost its effectiveness?”

“Now I understand. My attack just now must have caused this formation to be on the verge of shattering. This kid has taken advantage of it for nothing,” the burly man raised his hand and shouted.

The surrounding cultivators ignored him.

…

Behind the formation, a cute girl in white with two ponytails crossed her legs and clasped her toes with one hand, significantly contrary to her image.

“Eh? How did you come in? You have no manners at all.”

When the young girl saw someone enter, she quickly got up and blushed.

“I walked in and didn’t see anything.”

Qin Yu said seriously.

“Are you going to the seventh level of purgatory to hunt for demonic beasts? Are you alone?”

Qin Yu asked. This little girl’s soul was relatively more powerful. She should be a soul cultivator like Wu Mei from Ta Shan’s team.

If he had a powerful soul cultivator in his team, he would have less pressure to go to the seventh level.

“Yes, I’m alone. The fact that you could walk in means that your physical cultivation is still acceptable, but I still have to test you.”

The little girl said fiercely.

“What’s your name?”

Qin Yu held back his laughter and suddenly found this girl interesting.

“Piao Ruoyun.”

“Water Mirror Space.”

A ripple suddenly appeared before Qin Yu, and dozens of figures floating like clouds suddenly appeared around him.

She held a reverse grip dagger in her hand, and the chilling light on the dagger flickered with a bone-chilling aura.

In the next moment, a dagger silently approached Qin Yu’s throat.

“Your technique is not bad.”

Qin Yu chuckled.

“Hey, you’re a strange person. Why didn’t you dodge?”

Piao Ruoyun asked curiously.

“In Solitary Cloud City, you can’t break my defense.” Qin Yu shook his head.

“Let’s try then!”

Piao Ruoyun’s voice suddenly turned cold.

Although she did not use any spiritual energy, her speed was tremendously fast.

In an instant, the dagger had already attacked Qin Yu dozens of times.

“Such a powerful body cultivator! Alright, I approve of it,” Piao Ruoyun exclaimed.

“Go to the seventh level. I want to kill one of the demon kings, the six-tails demon fox. I want all the cores of the demon fox and will give you the rest.”

“What if we can’t kill the Six-Tailed Demon Fox?”

Qin Yu asked with a frown.

“Don’t worry. I’m not a person who will go back on my word. Only the inner core of the demon fox is effective in our cultivation. The rest are minimal.”

Piao Ruoyun patted her chest and said.

“What if you plot against me later? I’m just slightly stronger physically. If you stab me with a knife, I’ll find it hard to defend myself.”

Qin Yu held back his laughter and asked. This little girl seemed to be a little reckless. She did not even ask him what he wanted.

He wondered how the little girl would react if he told her about the bone cultivation water.

“That won’t happen. We’ll set up a soul restriction using the Path of Heaven. Moreover, with big sister on the seventh level, the risk will definitely be minimal if you are careful. Big sister is tremendously strong.”

The little girl said candidly.

“Alright, then we’ll do as you say. Let’s make an oath!”

Qin Yu nodded. This Piao Ruoyun made him feel much more comfortable than the previous people.
