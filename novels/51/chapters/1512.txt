Chapter 1513: Chapter 1,513, Man with the mustache? 1

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said in a low voice, “It seems that there are still some people who don’t want to give up. However, to be able to move freely in such a place, he does have some ability.”

Looking at his nimble movements, Qin Yu didn’t believe that he was in a mausoleum at all.

“If I can follow him to pick up some Babe, it wouldn’t be too bad,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

Thinking of this, Qin Yu immediately walked towards him.

All the way to his back, Qin Yu looked at him quietly.

He was very serious and did not notice that Qin Yu was behind him.

Qin Yu followed his gaze and saw that there was nothing in front of him, only a piece of desolate land.

And his fingers seemed to be wearing some magical artifact, moving extremely fast.

“What are you looking for here?”Qin Yu finally couldn’t hold it in any longer.

Hearing this voice, the other party was so frightened that he staggered and fell heavily to the ground.

“F * ck, you’re scaring me to death... F * ck!”

Before he could finish his words, he turned around and was about to run away.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but be greatly shocked, because this person was none other than man with the mustache!

......

“Why are you running away!”Qin Yu grabbed his shoulder and forcefully pulled him back.

“F * ck you! Why are you hiding from me?”Qin Yu said with his eyes wide open.

Man with the mustache coughed and immediately put on a serious posture. He said indifferently, “My friend, did you get the wrong person?”

“F * ck you!”Qin Yu kicked man with the mustache’s butt.

“Man with the mustache, stop pretending. I haven’t seen you since you ran away last time. Why? Are You Afraid of Me?”Qin Yu said with his eyes wide open.

Man with the mustache coughed dryly and then said with an embarrassed smile, “Look at what you said. Isn’t There Something Going On? Why would I hide from you?”

“Tell me quickly. Why are you hiding from me?”Qin Yu grabbed man with the mustache’s shoulder and said fiercely.

“Aiya, why are you so fierce? There really was something going on back then,”man with the mustache said with an aggrieved look.

Qin Yu knew that if this kid didn’t want to say anything, no matter what methods Qin Yu used, he wouldn’t be able to get him to open his mouth. Therefore, he was too lazy to continue asking.

He released man with the mustache and immediately asked, “What Babe did you find here?”

Man with the mustache immediately shook his head. “I didn’t find anything! I was just taking a walk here!”

“F * CK Your Grandpa. I’m not going to fight with you.”Qin Yu rolled his eyes.

Then, he glanced at the tomb and said in a deep voice, “There’s no danger inside, right? You know, I don’t care about the treasure at all. What I want is the dark energy inside.”

Man with the mustache immediately said with his chest held high, “Absolutely safe! This place has been excavated a hundred times. The danger has long been passed by the predecessors. You can rest assured...”

“Boom!”

Before he could finish his words, an extremely powerful internal Qi suddenly erupted from within the mausoleum!

The two people who were caught off guard were instantly sent flying into the air by this internal Qi. Several of their ribs were broken!

Man with the mustache had countless magical treasures on him. The moment that internal Qi rushed out, a set of armor wrapped around him. Therefore, he was unharmed.

“Bang!”

The two of them fell heavily to the ground, creating a huge crater.

Qin Yu rubbed his chest, feeling waves of pain.

Man with the mustache, on the other hand, put away his armor and fell to the ground, pretending to say “Aiyo Aiyo”nonstop.

“Okay, stop pretending. I saw it all,”Qin Yu said with a frown.

“You are still as unreliable as before. You didn’t even finish your fart before you got slapped in the face.”

Man with the mustache coughed dryly and said, “There was an accident, but this should be a good thing.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“A good thing?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

Man with the mustache said seriously, “That’s right. Such a strong internal Qi at least shows that my judgment is correct.”

“There’s definitely a babe hidden inside!”

Qin Yu frowned slightly and said, “Didn’t you say that this place has already been walked over a hundred times?”

Man with the mustache sneered and said, “If your standard isn’t good enough, it’s useless even if you walk over a hundred times.”

Just as Qin Yu was about to belittle him, he remembered what Brother Dao had said before.

Man with the mustache indeed had some ability. Even the nine great families of the Central Plains hadn’t escaped his vicious hands.

More importantly, this bastard had actually managed to escape from the hands of the nine great families!

One couldn’t help but admire his ability.

“Kid, you sure are lucky,”man with the mustache said as he stroked his beard.

“Since you’ve met him, I’ll give you a share no matter what. Let’s go.”

Qin Yu nodded. He followed man with the mustache and entered the mausoleum once again.

The internal Qi in the mausoleum came from the hole that man with the mustache had dug. At this moment, one could still see a wisp of fog.

Man with the mustache stared at the hole. He reached out with his hand and took out a shovel. Then, he continued to dig.

Qin Yu knew that he couldn’t help much, so he waited at the side to prevent any accidents from happening.

The hole grew bigger and bigger. In just half an hour, man with the mustache had almost dug through the mausoleum.

Qin Yu stood at the hole and looked down at man with the mustache.

“Damn, there’s really something inside.”

At this moment, man with the mustache’s voice came from the deep hole.

The next second, man with the mustache threw an iron chest up from below.

Qin Yu hurriedly caught the iron chest. The moment he touched it, he felt a bone-chilling coldness.

“Kid, don’t Open It!”Man with the mustache shouted from below.

As he said that, he leaped out from the hole.

But at this moment, a few large cold hands suddenly appeared from below and grabbed man with the mustache’s calf!

“Not good!”Man with the mustache’s expression changed slightly. He made a prompt decision and quickly bit his finger, and drops of blood flowed out.

Man with the mustache muttered, and those drops of blood actually transformed into a blood-red dagger!

The dagger shot down and easily cut off those big hands!

Man with the mustache also took this opportunity and hurriedly jumped up.

Qin Yu, who was watching from the side, was terrified. He frowned and asked, “What happened just now?”

Man with the mustache did not reply. He just looked at the hole coldly.

“There’s something wrong with this hole.”Man with the mustache took a deep breath.

“What is it?”Qin Yu asked quickly.

Man with the mustache did not explain. He took the metal box over and said, “Let’s see what’s in the box first.”

Man with the mustache took out his tools and carefully opened the box.

Man with the mustache’s expression was extremely grave, and cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

Obviously, even he did not know the origin of the box, let alone what was hidden in it.

The moment the box was opened, the expected horror did not happen. Instead, it was calm.

A few items were scattered inside the box:

A yellowed book, a strand of long black hair, and three fingers. Other than that, there were also a few scattered materials that could not be named. These materials looked like the fragments of weapons after a great battle.
