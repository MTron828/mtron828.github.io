2123 Paying Respect to Dean Lei!

The endless starlight collided with the elemental energy pillar. The stars rotated, and the elemental energy surged. It was as if two worlds were colliding, triggering an unparalleled battle.

The moment techniques collided, Xuan Jizi’s face revealed a nervous expression. He gritted his teeth, raised his head, and roared, pushing his internal qi to the limit!

The impact of the Starry River Jade Pendant and the elemental pearl was too great. The surrounding onlookers were pushed away by the powerful force, and some even fainted due to the impact.

The entire world seemed to have fallen into endless tremors at this moment. Everything stopped at this moment.

However, just as everyone thought Xuan Jizi would be defeated by the elemental energy pillar, a powerful force suddenly erupted from the Starry Jade Pendant. Numerous stars flew out from it like an endless army and were directed toward the elemental energy pillar.

The impact of the stars was incredibly powerful, and the entire space seemed to be trembling. Xuan Jizi gritted his teeth, his eyes shining with determination. However, in the face of such a powerful impact, his expression could not help but turn pale.

The stars collided with the elemental energy pillar, forming an enormous halo. The stars in the halo were radiant, beautiful, and shocking.

However, the elemental energy pillar did not waver and continued to charge straight at Xuan Jizi!

Just as the elemental energy pillar was about to reach him, a flash of comprehension appeared in Xuan Jizi’s eyes. He suddenly opened his mouth and spat a mouthful of blood essence onto the Starry Jade Pendant.

The Starry Jade Pendant suddenly erupted with even more intense light. The starlight was radiant, but it failed to block the impact of the elemental energy pillar.

The elemental energy pillar was incomparably ferocious like a thunderbolt. It directly charged into the light of the Starry Jade Pendant.

“How is that possible?” Xuan Jizi’s expression changed drastically, and he was terrified!

However, it was too late to do anything now. There was nowhere to escape even though he wanted to!

The collision between the elemental energy pillar and the Starry Jade Pendant resulted in a shocking boom, and the entire world seemed to tremble.

However, at this moment, the light from the Starry Jade Pendant suddenly extinguished, and the elemental energy pillar rushed toward Xuan Jizi without any obstruction!

Under everyone’s terrified gazes, the elemental energy pillar rushed toward Xuan Jizi like a gigantic dragon.

At this unavoidable moment, Xuan Jizi’s face revealed a terrified expression.

However, the elemental energy pillar landed on Xuan Jizi’s body like a divine punishment. The tremendous impact sent him flying. His body was like a kite with a broken string as he weakly flew into the distance.

At that moment, the entire world seemed to fall silent. Everyone stared blankly at Xuan Jizi, who had flown out. Their faces were full of shock and disbelief.

After that, Si Liuhe slowly descended. His body was still flowing with elemental energy current like a dragon, but he was now as calm as water.

Looking in the direction where Xuan Jizi had flown, his eyes were full of calmness and indifference.

The onlookers fell silent for a moment. They looked at Xuan Jizi in the sky like if they had seen an unbelievable scene. Si Liuhe’s power had undoubtedly planted a deep fear in their hearts.

His words attracted even more attention, and the people around him began to discuss.

“I can’t believe it… Xuan Jizi was so powerful, but he could not fight back against Si Liuhe!” an elderly man widened his eyes and said in shock.

“Si Liuhe is indeed powerful. He defeated Xuan Jizi so easily,” another onlooker said in shock.

“I’ve never seen such powerful elemental energy… Even though Xuan Jizi was a True Saint, he couldn’t resist,” a young cultivator said in shock.

Si Liuhe was incomparably calm. He waved his hand, and the seal of the void in the surroundings was removed.

At this moment, Xuan Jizi was lying on the ground, spitting out blood. Many parts of his body shattered, and his internal qi had become tremendously weak!

“Not worth mentioning,” Si Liuhe said faintly.

“Spare… Spare me…” Xuan Jizi said painfully.

He trembled and raised his hand, no longer bearing the demeanor of a True Saint.

In this Golden Age, everything was possible. No one was willing to die during this time!

“Please, let me go. I’m willing to become a subordinate of your Si family and obey all their orders…” Xuan Jizi said in a trembling voice.

Si Liuhe snorted and said indifferently, “You’re not worthy.”

Those three short words were like a death-hastening talisman that made Xuan Jizi utterly despair!

In the next second, Si Liuhe waved his hand and slapped Xuan Jizi’s head. Xuan Jizi’s head exploded, and even his primordial spirit could not escape! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A True Saint of a generation had fallen just like that!

All the people around sighed, but what shocked them, even more, was Si Liuhe’s strength!

“All over the world… I’m afraid no one can compete with Si Liuhe…” someone murmured, his tone filled with emotion.

…

At Thunder Courtyard, Qin Yu’s wisp of divine sense was constantly following Wu Ji’s cultivation path.

It was unknown if it was due to Qin Yu’s talent or if he had the same physique as Wu Ji. In short, Qin Yu’s comprehension of Wu Ji’s dao technique was way beyond imagination.

“At this rate, I might be able to comprehend the Traceless Immortal Scripture in a hundred years.” Qin Yu took a deep breath, his eyes filled with anticipation.

Once he comprehended Wu Ji’s dao technique, it would not only improve his cultivation but also impact his entire cultivation path profoundly!

What was even more terrifying was that Qin Yu actually did not fully devote himself to this dao technique. His true body was still comprehending his own cultivation dao technique!

At this moment, the expression of Qin Yu, who was playing chess with Dean Lei, slightly changed!

He could clearly feel an incredibly strong internal qi approaching!

Although this internal qi had been restrained with every effort, the terrifying divine might it emitted still made people tremble in fear!

“He’s finally here,” Dean Lei said indifferently.

He stood up and looked into the distance. There was no emotion in his eyes.

“Is it Si Liuhe?” Qin Yu took a deep breath, his eyes having a hint of solemnity.

Dean Lei did not answer. He just waved his hand and said, “You leave first.”

“He’s here for me, so I can’t leave,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“What’s the point of you staying?” Dean Lei shook his head.

Then, with a wave of his hand, a gentle force sent Qin Yu away from this place.

Dean Lei stretched out his hand again, and a tea table was placed in front of him.

Dark clouds surged in the sky. It seemed to be foreshadowing something.

In the next second, a loud bang spread throughout the main peak of Thunderous Yard!

“Si Liuhe is paying respect to the dean of Thunder Courtyard!”

The voice was earth-shattering and deafening. The entire Thunder Courtyard seemed to be trembling slightly!
