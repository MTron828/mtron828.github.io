“You!”

When she heard Yan Ruoxue’s words, Cheng Lei immediately took off her sunglasses and pointed at Yan Ruoxue furiously.

Yan Ruoxue sneered. “You don’t want the finger anymore?”

It was clearly an offhand remark, but for some reason, Cheng Lei couldn’t help but put her hand down.

“I don’t care. In any case, get out of my way right now. This place has already been requisitioned by me!” Cheng Lei crossed her arms and snickered.

“Requisitioned?” Yan Ruoxue raised her eyebrows.

“What kind of power do you have to requisition a public place? Show me the requisitioned documents.” Yan Ruoxue asked coldly.

Cheng Lei’s expression became even uglier. How could she have requisitioned documents?!

“Are you leaving or not?” Cheng Lei became even angrier.

Yan Ruoxue smiled and said, “If you have the requisitioned documents, I’ll leave. If you don’t have them, I’m not leaving.”

“You b * tch, you’re so shameless!” Cheng Lei scolded furiously.

When she heard this, Yan Ruoxue’s expression instantly turned cold. She raised her hand and slapped Cheng Lei’s face.

“You... you actually dared to hit me?” Cheng Lei instantly flushed with anger! The bodyguards beside her also quickly took a step forward.

Qin Yu hurriedly shielded Yan Ruoxue behind him, and the internal qi on his body suddenly released.

Cheng Lei gritted her teeth and said, “You dared to hit me? I’ll let you know the consequences today!”

With that, Cheng Lei walked to the side and began to make a call.

After making three to four calls, Cheng Lei put down her phone.

“Just you wait! Just you wait!” Cheng Lei roared with fury.

Yan Ruoxue nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll wait for you here.”

Time passed minute by minute. Ten minutes later, one luxury car after another came from a short distance!

Mercedes-benz, BMW, Maybach, Bentley, Lamborghini... As far as the eye could see, there were at least twenty of them!

Seeing this scene, the people around couldn’t help but feel a little afraid.

“You’re dead meat. I’ll see what you can do!” Cheng Lei said arrogantly.

The car soon stopped in front of Cheng Lei, and one middle-aged man after another got out of the car.

“This woman scolded me and hit me! You have to stand up for me!” Cheng Lei said coquettishly.

“Who dares to hit my babe?”

“Exactly. That person is digging their own grave?!”

“Hurry up and apologize!”

Obviously, these people were all businessmen from South City.

And Cheng Lei’s relationship with them was naturally ambiguous.

As she watched this scene, Yan Ruoxue’s expression was calm.

She smiled and said, “You want to call people? Okay, then I’ll make a call too.”

“Go make a call quickly. I want to see who you can call!”

“In South City, I’ve never been afraid of anyone!”

Everyone clamored.

Yan Ruoxue ignored them. She took out her cell phone and made a call.

“I’ll give you ten minutes to come to the amusement park immediately,” Yan Ruoxue said coldly.

After saying this, Yan Ruoxue directly hung up the phone.

“Hehe, you’re just bluffing!”

“I’ll wait for you to find someone. Hurry up and find him!” Cheng Lei snorted.

Qin Yu wasn’t worried. Others didn’t know the power of the Yan family, but Qin Yu knew about it very clearly.

A mere F-list celebrity was far from qualified to go against the Yan family.

A few minutes later, Audi A6s drove over from a short distance.

There were actually more than twenty of them!

“F * ck, how many A6s have been called over?”

“Nobody drives such shabby cars anymore!”

“I thought you were so high and mighty, but turns out that’s all you’ve got?”

Yan Ruoxue didn’t say anything. She just smiled.

Soon, the car arrived in front of Yan Ruoxue.

Then, they saw a few men wearing Chinese tunic suits running down in a hurry.

When they saw the faces of these people clearly, everyone’s expressions became extremely ugly!

“Mayor of South City... South City...”

“Director of South City’s cultural and entertainment department...”

“South City Patrol Bureau’s police chief...”

These people were almost all top-level big shots in South City!

Yan Ruoxue’s phone call had almost mobilized all the top-level officials in South City!

“Mayor... Mayor, why are you here...” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I’m sorry, I... I still have something to do, so I’ll leave first.”

“Cheng Lei, take care...”

The group of people quickly got into the car and dashed out!

Cheng Lei’s expression was extremely ugly and she gritted her teeth so hard that they were about to break!

Mr. Bai’s expression was also grave. It seemed that this woman’s background wasn’t simple.

“Miss Cheng, Young Master Liu is here.” At this moment, a bodyguard beside her whispered in her ear.

Cheng Lei, who was dejected just a moment ago, was overjoyed when she heard this!

“Haha, Young Master Liu is here. That’s great! Let’s see what you guys can do!” Cheng Lei jumped up excitedly.

Mr. Bai also heaved a sigh of relief inside. Since Young Master Liu was here, then everything would be fine.

“Where is Young Master Liu? Quickly bring me there!” Cheng Lei said anxiously.

The bodyguard didn’t say anything else and brought Cheng Lei to Young Master Liu.

Cheng Lei ran all the way to Young Master Liu and said with an aggrieved expression. “Young Master Liu, I was just about to take a photo, but she didn’t cooperate and even hit me...”

Liu Shihui frowned and said, “What happened?”

Cheng Lei quickly gave an exaggerated account of the incident, “I said that I was a signed artist under the Liu family’s company, but she said that the Liu family was nothing! She even said that you have to kneel down when you see her! She’s too arrogant!”

When he heard Cheng Lei’s words, Liu Shihui’s expression instantly turned cold.

Liu Shihui was just about to find a place to vent his anger since he didn’t get the Chinese knotweed. He didn’t expect that it would come to him so soon.

“Who is so bold? I want to see for myself!” Liu Shihui said coldly.

Cheng Lei was delighted and quickly said, “She’s right there! You must teach that despicable couple a good lesson!”

Liu Shihui didn’t say anything and strode forward.

Cheng Lei hurriedly led the way. She couldn’t wait to see Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue’s frightened expressions!

“Chief Li, Wang Shi, why are you guys here?” Liu Shihui looked at the people in front of him and couldn’t help but feel a little surprised.

“Mr. Liu, is this woman signed by your company?” Wang Shi asked.

Liu Shihui nodded and said, “Yes, what’s wrong?”

“Nothing.” Wang Shi waved his hand, but there was some pity in his eyes.

“Inexplicable,” Liu Shihui couldn’t help but mutter.

After saying that, he continued to walk forward with Cheng Lei.

Soon, they arrived under the Ferris wheel.

“Young Master Liu, it’s them!” Cheng Lei pointed at Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue, who were standing under the Ferris wheel.

At this moment, Qin Yu and Yan Ruoxue had long forgotten about this fool. The two of them were looking up at the ferris wheel with blissful expressions.

Looking at the backs of the two of them, Liu Shihui snorted and said, “Reckless fools.”

After saying that, Liu Shihui walked quickly to the front of the two of them.

“It’s the two of you who beat up my artist? And you dared to show her attitude?” Liu Shihui said coldly.

When he heard Liu Shihui’s voice, Qin Yu turned his head first.

When Liu Shihui saw Qin Yu, his expression suddenly changed!

“You... It’s you? Qin Yu?” Liu Shihui suddenly had a bad feeling inside!

So... the woman Cheng Lei mentioned was Yan Ruoxue?

Liu Shihui called out tentatively. “Miss... Miss Yan.”

Yan Ruoxue slowly turned around.

“Young Master Liu, what a coincidence. We meet again,” Yan Ruoxue said with a nonchalant smile.
