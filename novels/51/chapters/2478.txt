“None of you can leave today. Hahaha, this is my first battle as a Godly King. I must properly display my strength to the Lord of the monster race.”

His palm slapped backward slightly, and the exaggerated reaction force sent his body flying like an arrow leaving the bow.

A sharp whistling sounded in the air. After his body arrived before Qin Yu for a moment, the afterimage behind him slowly disappeared.

“Go to hell! Trash from the human race. Only when you die will he stop grumbling.”

A palm landed directly on Qin Yu’s forehead without any hesitation.

Worldly matters were long and remote, and time passed quietly. Time flew like arrows, and the Path of Heaven bent like a bow.

Flower Granny’s black hair turned gray, and a strand of vast qi floated on her left and right hands.

A sand as fine as the fine sand of the beach blew toward He Teng along with a sigh.

Time seemed to be flowing between the hazy scenes.

One could see the awakening of all things in spring, the brilliant sunshine in summer, the blue sky in autumn, and the dancing snowflakes in winter.

In the space covered by the sand, the flow of time seemed to be thousands of times faster.

“Hmm?”

He Teng’s expression changed. The body behind him, which contained endless power, seemed to have lost its strength suddenly.

The skin of half of his body suddenly turned as yellow as a fallen leaf in autumn. In an instant, he seemed to have become an elderly man on the verge of death. His pupils also became turbid, and he could not see anything clearly.

In an instant, his body erupted with endless demonic qi.

Terrifying demonic qi clashed with the sand of time, and his body kept changing.

One moment, it returned to its original terrifying appearance, and the next moment, it decayed like an elderly man, and again, the next moment, it became like a newly born monster race living being.

In this instant of the clash, He Teng’s body was like a space filled with explosives, and the power that erupted caused the entire continent to shake.

Flower Granny’s face was visibly aging.

That was the power of the backslash of time. Previously, she had already used the power of time against Yan Tianshi. This time, the power of time was pushed to the extreme, and the backlash was much stronger than before.

Looking at Flower Granny’s aged face, Qin Yu’s heart ached to the extreme.

This was all the soul power the sword had absorbed after it was in his hand.

At this moment, the ghostly sword in his hand shone with the soul light like the sun.

The terrifying power of the soul ignited a green divine fire on the sword body. Qin Yu placed Evil Eye on his chest and released all the power of the soul.

He formed a seal with one hand, and the Soul Guiding Power he had comprehended in the ghost realm circulated in his hand.

After that, with a wave of the ghostly sword, all the souls let out terrifying shrieks.

The second move of the ghostly sword, Soul Ferry!

At this moment, the instant Evil Eye unleashed the sword energy, the entire continent seemed to have become a few dozen degrees colder. The gloomy internal qi of the soul even affected the whole world, and that sword energy exploded on He Teng’s body.

However, this sword energy did not cause any damage to He Teng, and a soul kingdom suddenly formed where the sword energy exploded.

It was a vast sea of souls releasing an irresistible attraction force. Countless wandering souls floated toward the sea. Even the most formidable soul could not resist this summoning.

He Teng’s soul separated from his body, and his soul walked toward the soul kingdom step by step.

His body seemed to have sensed the danger and exploded with destructive power again. It acted on its own and grabbed the soul kingdom, trying to snatch back the soul.

Qin Yu’s bones let out a terrifying sound. The instant his body grabbed the sword energy, it had already erupted with its ultimate strength.

Countless bones in his body were instantly torn into pieces, and it was unknown how many of them shattered.

“Come in!”

Qin Yu gritted his teeth and tried with all his might to control Evil Eye and maintain the soul kingdom.

“Boom!”

A bright power of thunder and lightning suddenly shone from He Teng’s forehead. At this moment, Lei Xin’s divine thunder pierced through He Teng’s head.

He Teng’s enormous body suddenly stopped and then smashed onto the ground.

However, after he landed on the ground, his physical strength was still squirming as if he was trying with all his might to heal the injuries on his body.

“Go!”

Qin Yu grabbed He Teng’s arm and suppressed him into the space of his Sumeru ring.

Taking advantage of the interval when He Teng fell, Qin Yu pulled Lei Xin, Flower Granny, Wan Ming, and the others over and shouted at the stunned Ling Yurou.

A few of them unleashed their fastest speed and retreated from the seal.

The Asura Godly King!

And also the Moon Demon Godly King in the dark.

“Charge! He Teng isn’t dead yet. If we wait for him to recover, we won’t be able to leave.”

Qin Yu held the ghostly sword as his body shot out toward Asura Godly King like a streak of light.

Nearly in an instant, his body was about to clash directly with Asura Godly King.

“You’re courting death!”

A sinister smile appeared on Asura Godly King’s face.

An enormous blood-colored palm had already slapped him almost at the same time.

Moon Demon Godly King appeared beside him, and the sound of a bowstring being pulled was heard.

The next moment, a black arrow was less than a fist away from Qin Yu’s face.

The timing was perfect! God-slaying Dusk!

Qin Yu gathered all the chaotic qi in his body into his arm, raised his sword high, and stabbed into the ground.

With Evil Eye as the center, a destructive Breath of Yellow Springs swept out like a tsunami. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The power of destruction coupled with the power of the Breath of Yellow Springs instantly flushed out.

Asura Godly King and Moon Demon Godly King were caught off guard and struck by this terrifying power.

Their bodies were sent flying instantly. Moon Demon Godly King, having a weaker body, was in an even more tragic state. A large piece of his body was directly sliced off, and he lay on the ground, fate unknown.

Qin Yu dared not rashly chase after him anymore. He now could not determine the condition of He Teng’s injuries.

Moreover, he initially could not sense the location of the sea of destruction. However, he could do so after the power of the soul in Evil Eye completely lit up.

He used the power of the soul kingdom from the sword move of Soul Ferry to finally sense the location of the sea of destruction again. Only then did he use the third move of Evil Eye, the God-slaying Dusk.

Even King Qin Guang would be at a disadvantage with this move, let alone these two Godly Kings.

Taking the opportunity of the two Godly Kings were severely injured, everyone hurriedly retreated from the seal.
