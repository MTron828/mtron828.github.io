1884 The Day of Path of Heaven

Almost everyone in the surroundings cheered, except for Qin Yu, who kept sighing.

“Qin Yu, I didn’t expect you to get first place,” the peak master walked over and patted Qin Yu’s shoulder.

“If it wasn’t for Si Shiyu, how could I have gotten first place?” Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said.

“You can’t say that. Si Shiyu has always been like this, but he’s still number one,” Jiu Xiao said indifferently.

!!

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. He didn’t say anything else, but he didn’t feel comfortable.

Si Shiyu was much more benevolent and righteous than Qin Yu had imagined. Perhaps it was just as he had said that he couldn’t get over himself.

The competition was over. Qin Yu won first place and was granted a wish.

Qin Yu opted for the points from Demon-slaying Peak because he owed too many points.

After distributing the points to everyone, the competition was finally over.

“Qin Yu, congratulations,” Zhao Wan Er walked forward and said with a smile.

“I was just lucky,” Qin Yu could only force a smile and said.

“Tsk! You’re still so humble,” Zhao Wan Er rolled her eyes and said.

“I’ll definitely surpass you in the next competition.”

“Mmm.” Qin Yu responded and said, ” Then you should focus on your cultivation.”

Zhao Wan Er seemed to understand that Qin Yu was not in a good mood, so she did not stay any longer. She only said that they would gather at the Demon-slaying Peak in the future and left.

The people of Demon-slaying Peak also decided to go back.

Qin Yu thought for a while and decided not to go with them. He planned to stay at the first main peak.

There was no reason other than Qin Yu wanting to chat with Si Shiyu.

After leaving the Mystic Realm, Qin Yu finally found Si Shiyu’s cave abode after asking around.

In the cave abode, Si Shiyu sat cross-legged to recover his body.

Qin Yu’s arrival did not surprise Si Shiyu.

He glanced at Qin Yu and said coldly, “If you’re here to thank me, then you don’t have to say anything.”

Qin Yu shook his head. He sat across from Si Shiyu and said, “You said I’m not as good as Si Shiyue. What do you mean by that?”

Si Shiyu sneered and said, “Being inferior is inferior. Why are there so many reasons?”

“I still don’t understand,” Qin Yu frowned and said.

“Then you don’t have to understand,” Si Shiyu was extremely cold.

Qin Yu thought for a moment and said, “I know you’re a proud person and will never admit defeat. I have the same mentality as you. Both Si Shiyue and I have chaotic bodies. I naturally don’t want to admit that I’m not as good as him.

“But it’s a pity that I don’t know much about Si Shiyue. Thus I’m not convinced by what you said.”

After hearing Qin Yu’s words, Si Shiyu narrowed his eyes slightly.

“You’re indeed strong enough,” he said, sizing up Qin Yu. “But you’re too dependent on your special physique.

“Although I’ve lost to you in our fight, I’m not sure the next time.

“But if I were to fight against Si Shiyue, I would never believe I could defeat him.”

Qin Yu was stunned for a moment, but he quickly understood what Si Shiyu meant.

Just as Si Shiyu had said, Qin Yu had relied too much on the strength and dominance of his physical body. If there was a technique that could limit Qin Yu’s physical strength, he would probably have to wait for death.

“Thank you very much,” Qin Yu stood up and said.

Si Shiyu didn’t say anything else. He closed his eyes slightly.

At this moment, Si Shiyu naturally didn’t know Qin Yu’s purpose, nor did he know he would fight with Si Shiyue sooner or later.

After leaving Si Shiyu’s cave abode, Qin Yu returned to the first main peak, planning to see Dean Lei.

Dean Lei seemed to have expected this and had sent someone to wait there.

Qin Yu followed the two men all the way to Dean Lei’s residence.

“Dean Lei, Qin Yu is here,” the two men bowed and said respectfully.

“Come in.” Soon Dean Lei’s voice was heard from inside.

Qin Yu didn’t waste time and strode in.

In the room, Dean Lei was flipping through a book.

“Greetings, Dean Lei,” Qin Yu said as he bowed.

Dean Lei put down the book in his hand. He stroked his beard, smiled faintly, and said, “You don’t look happy.”

“I didn’t win with honor. Of course, I’m not happy,” Qin Yu said with a bitter smile.

“Hahaha!” Dean Lei couldn’t help but burst out laughing. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That’s what Si Shiyu thinks too. If he relies on his cultivation realm to defeat you, he would also feel his victory is without honor,” Dean Lei shook his head and said.

“Yeah, that’s why I can understand him,” Qin Yu said with emotion.

At this point, Qin Yu changed the topic, “Dean, I’m here to say goodbye to you.”

“Goodbye?” Dean Lei was a little surprised.

“From what I know, you’ve been here for less than two years, right?”

“Mmm,” Qin Yu responded. “It’s indeed less than two years.”

...

“Then why are you in such a hurry to leave? Is Thunder Courtyard not worth your stay?” Dean Lei was puzzled.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “Of course not. Thunder Courtyard is indeed a good place for cultivation, but I think I should go out to look around.”

Dean Lei was silent. He looked at Qin Yu and said, “You’re planning to go to Zhongzhou?”

“That’s right.” Qin Yu nodded.

“I suggest you go after a while,” Dean Lei said in a deep voice.

“Why?” Qin Yu was puzzled and asked.

“Firstly, the rule of Thunder Courtyard states that you can only leave after three years. If you leave now, you will no longer be a member of Thunder Courtyard.

“Secondly, you should visit Thunder Academy more often. There must be something you need there.”

Being reminded by Dean Lei, Qin Yu suddenly remembered what Si Shiyu had said.

He remained silent for a moment before he nodded and said, “Alright. I’ll listen to you. I’ll leave after three years.”

Dean Lei nodded slightly and said with some emotion, “You guys are truly strange. It seems like you all want freedom. You behave the same, and so does Xiao Sheng.”

...

Qin Yu smiled bitterly, not knowing what to say.

“By the way, Dean Lei. I have a question to ask you,” Qin Yu suddenly said.

“Go ahead,” Dean Lei nodded and said.

“Do you know about the day of the Path of Heaven?” Qin Yu asked.

“Of course, I do,” Dean Lei said with a smile, stroking his beard. “Everyone in the Holy Region knows about the day of the Path of Heaven.”

“What festival is the day of the Path of Heaven?” Qin Yu frowned and asked.

Dean Lei stood up slowly and walked to the window. With his hands behind his back, he said indifferently, “The day of the Path of Heaven only comes during the Golden Age. On that day, the spiritual energy and dao techniques are the purest. There will also be a vision in the sky. Rumor has it that those who have the opportunity will be baptized by the Path of Heaven on that day.”

“Baptized by the Path of Heaven?” Qin Yu was stunned.

Dean Lei nodded slightly and said, “Those who get to be baptized by the Path of Heaven will definitely step into the Tribulation Stage in the future.”
