Chapter 2860: Exposing All of His Trump Cards

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Qin Yu took a moment to ponder, sensing that something was off.

In front of him, Ding Ning still had plenty of energy, yet he suddenly began to absorb the power of the two supreme treasures.

He must have noticed something.

As Qin Yu held the two supreme treasures in his hands, he finally caught on.

In his world of Nine Heavens Manifestations Gaze, the internal qi of the God Source and the Absolute Beginning Life Stone was being drained away.

Then, it slowly dissipated into the Burial Heaven Cave. The two Dharma Treasures in his hands also shrank.

He was unable to halt it!

Qin Yu’s expression darkened.

He gazed at the layers of ghost fog in the sky, his face revealing a chilly demeanor.

The supreme treasures produced by the generals here should have some kind of connection with this world.

The generals’ superhuman physical strength was likely due to the relationship between these two supreme treasures.

However, at this moment, this power was dissipating unnoticed, returning to the Burial Heaven Cave. It was highly probable that these generals would continue to appear, and everyone would likely end up in a dead end.

Ping!

As the ghost fog collided, a dull thunderbolt suddenly struck the area.

The heavy force even caused the ground to tremble.

Six phantoms descended from the sky and locked onto Qin Yu expressionlessly.

Almost simultaneously, several black lights had already attacked Qin Yu’s body.

Those black lights were the power of the body’s fluctuation. Only then did the surrounding space crack.

Boom!

A flame erupted from Qin Yu’s fingertip.

Instantly, the Primal Chaos Flame was released once again. Under Qin Yu’s control, the Primal Chaos Flame transformed into a green fire dragon wave.

As it spun, it turned the area into a complete sea of fire.

Releasing the Primal Chaos Flame required the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth to corrode it. Only then could it stabilize its form and reinforce the seal of the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth on it.

Restarting twice in a row was already a very risky maneuver.

If the Cold Dew of Heaven and Earth couldn’t suppress it, the Primal Chaos Flame would directly consume Qin Yu.

However, Qin Yu had no other option at this moment.

As the flames subsided, the three strands of God Source and the Absolute Beginning Life Stone floated in the air.

And there was something peculiar. He had dispatched six generals at once.

However, besides these six Dharma Treasures, it seemed that there were nearly eight more auras of supreme treasure in the surroundings, emanating internal qi.

But at this moment, Qin Yu didn’t have the time to contemplate this issue.

Boom!

Two streams of blood trickled from Qin Yu’s eyes, and his internal qi trembled violently.

The reins that controlled the Primal Chaos Flame were linked to Qin Yu’s divine soul.

Just like a child guiding a wagon, this power, surpassing all limits, left traces of fracture on his divine soul.

If not for his divine soul having already ascended to the level of Holy Consciousness, the second reignition of the Primal Chaos Flame might have gravely wounded him.

“Go to hell!”

A golden streak flashed across Qin Yu’s form, causing a shockwave to ripple through the air.

It was a wing akin to metal.

A magnificent Golden Eagle Demonic Beast slowly hovered in the air.

Its right wing flapped gently, and droplets of blood fell from it.

Meanwhile, in its left hand, a trace of God Source was held.

Did it manage to evade his strike?

A hint of disbelief flickered across Golden Eagle’s visage.

Qin Yu’s Night Qi enshrouded his upper torso.

After the golden wing brushed by, a slanted black flame began to burn within, causing Qin Yu’s expression to slightly contort.

The Night Qi coalesced and erupted from his form.

Beneath this golden force, a fierce vibration erupted entirely after its departure.

That too was the peak power of level 12. Yet, even now, it seemed the power of the night struggled to neutralize this unleashed force.

“Friend! It’s been too long!” A voice reverberated behind Qin Yu.

Thus, all sentient beings bear no self-appearance, human appearance, sentient beings’ appearance, or appearance of longevity; there exists no appearance, nor any illegal appearance.

A Buddhist seal struck Qin Yu within the space dominated by the Night Qi.

Hundred Forms of Life, the mightiest three-phase power emerged.

The power of the remaining nearly ten phases manifested in the realm of dreams.

Yi Xing, Hundred Forms of Life.

Sanskrit Form!

The night scene was suddenly engulfed by dense clouds.

Amid the thunderous sea, countless murmurs echoed from various corners of the world.

It was the fury-laden language of Buddhism, the roar of utmost wrath. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Whispers of jealousy, trifles of annoyance.

These sound waves solidified into streams of energy, coalescing into an indiscernible Sanskrit statue.

The arm of the Sanskrit statue had slightly contracted, resembling the draw of a heavy bow. Even the air could sense the terrifying force amassed by the Sanskrit form.

With a crisp tearing of silk, Qin Yu’s night domain was ripped apart by the Hundred Forms of Life.

Excellent!

Even Yi Xing couldn’t help but show a hint of satisfaction.

This individual was the monk who had journeyed with them to the Eight Desolates Beast Domain. He was also the monk adorned with twelve scars.

In the Buddhist Sect, he was among the elder generation.

Upon seeing the multitude of God Sources and Absolute Beginning Life Stones, he immediately chose to act.

“You bald scoundrel, how many cycles can your Hundred Forms of Power endure?”

The dreamy aura on Qin Yu’s body vanished as the Sanskrit statue of Hundred Forms of Life delivered a direct punch.

A surge of energy pierced through his entire body, creating a massive crater behind him.

However, Qin Yu wore a snake-like grin, and a pinpoint of white light rapidly expanded in Yi Xing’s eyes.

One Thought Reincarnation.

In an instant, Yi Xing’s pupils were filled with numerous figures.

There were ordinary folk, practitioners, even beasts, demons, and living beings.

The lives of these people transmuted into countless images, gently unfurling and descending within his sea of consciousness.

These were the entire life experiences of the living beings Qin Yu had encountered.

On the Soul Suppressing Passage, he savored their lives bit by bit.

Every detail and scene was authentic.

Even if Yi Xing employed all means, he couldn’t break free from this cycle of rebirth.

Because this was all genuine. How could one easily break free from a genuine world?

One Thought Reincarnation!

Qin Yu’s palms suddenly clenched together.

All of his divine thoughts instantly converged, and the radiant light of reincarnation burst forth like the sun.

The dozens of Dao Consciousness top-notch martial artists suddenly looked bewildered.

At that moment, their divine souls uncontrollably entered this realm of reincarnation, unable to break free.

Almost everyone felt a shiver down their spine instantly. Once drawn into this terrifying vortex, even the mightiest among them seemed incapable of resisting it at all.

What a dreadful power! And it wasn’t even his peak power.

Liu Bai pointed, piercing through the general before him.

At that moment, it seemed an invisible power surrounded him. Those around him couldn’t decipher Liu Bai’s figure.
