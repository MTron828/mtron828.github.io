“Ye Qing?” Han Wei’s expression turned ugly.

If Qin Yu really became Ye Qing’s disciple, he would have to think of another way to crush him.

“Yes, but I heard that Qin Yu rejected him,” the butler continued.

Han Wei raised his eyebrows and couldn’t help but sneer. “He actually rejected him? I didn’t expect the day when Ye Qing would be rejected too, hahaha!”

The butler wasn’t as optimistic as Han Wei. He bowed and said, “Young Master, since Ye Qing has noticed Qin Yu, he must think highly of him.”

“It has only been half a year and he has already made a name for himself. If he is given another half a year, who knows how far he will go...”

Han Wei sneered. “You really think highly of him. He is only an Inner Strength Past Master now. Do you think he can cross several levels in half a year?”

The butler said in a deep voice, “That’s true, but if Ye Qing wants to protect him...”

“Protect him?” Han Wei sneered.

“Qin Yu was the one who made a fuss in the media by saying that there would be a showdown in half a year. Why? Does Ye Qing want to publicly announce that he will protect him?”

The butler suddenly came to a realization and couldn’t help but laugh. “I didn’t expect that Qin Yu shot himself in the foot...”

Han Wei narrowed his eyes and said, “The most troublesome person now isn’t Ye Qing, but Old Mister Yan.”

“As long as he doesn’t die, I won’t be at ease!”

With Old Mister Yan around, Han Wei didn’t dare to provoke the Yan family.

“Just wait. When you die, I will defile your most beloved granddaughter in front of your grave!” A trace of coldness flashed in Han Wei’s eyes.

...

Qin Yu embarked on the return journey to the Chuzhou region.

Ever since he had the conversation with the Yan family, the pressure on Qin Yu had increased by several folds.

That kind of urgency kept him busy, without the slightest bit of rest.

Originally, Qin Yu had planned to head straight for the Divine Alchemist Pavilion. However, there was less than half a month left before the New Year, so it wasn’t a good time to go to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu decided to wait until the New Year before heading to the Divine Alchemist Pavilion.

After arriving at Chuzhou region, Qin Yu said goodbye to Commander Long and left the Chuzhou region.

As soon as he got home, Mr. Wu called to inquire about the situation.

After learning that the Chuzhou region had won the first place, Mr. Wu was overjoyed.

“Qin Yu, you’re really surprising!” Mr. Wu said excitedly over the phone.

At this moment, Xiao Yu’s voice came from the phone.

She shouted over the phone, “Qin Yu, when are you coming to my house to play?!”

Mr. Wu scolded, “Go away!”

Qin Yu didn’t know how to react when he heard that. He could only say over the phone, “When I have time.”

Mr. Wu changed the topic and said, “Qin Yu, where are you going to spend the New Year this year?”

When this topic was brought up, Qin Yu suddenly felt a little sad.

Qin Yu always felt homesick during the festive season. In the past, Qin Yu would spend the New Year with the Su family. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

But now, he had already divorced Su Yan and was alone.

Qin Yu sighed and said, “I’ll go back to Jiangcheng. After all, that’s where I was born.”

Mr. Wu said, “Why don’t you come to my house?”

“Yes, yes, yes. Come to my house to celebrate the New Year together!” Xiao Yu said excitedly.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “I’ll go back to Jiangcheng. After all, I have lived there for more than twenty years.”

Mr. Wu didn’t insist.

After hanging up the phone, Qin Yu packed up and planned to go back to Jiangcheng.

“Yao Qing, are you going back to your hometown?” Qin Yu asked.

Yao Qing shook his head and said, “I haven’t been back for several years.”

“Then take your sister and come back to Jiangcheng with me,” Qin Yu said.

Yao Qing nodded and agreed.

Then, the three of them took their things and rushed to Jiangcheng.

There were about ten days left before the New Year, and Jiangcheng had a festive vibe.

Many people who worked out of town gradually returned to their hometown.

Jiangcheng became lively.

Qin Yu drove back to the Dragon Paradise Villa.

As soon as they entered the estate’s gate, Yao Qing pointed outside and said, “Mr. Qin, isn’t that your ex-wife?”

He looked up and saw Su Yan.

At this moment, she was surrounded by four to five young men.

When he tilted his ear to listen, he could hear these young men pointing at Su Yan and cursing.

“When will you return the money you owe us? If you don’t, I’ll throw you into a brothel!”

“I. . . I don’t have money now. I’ll return it in a few days, okay?” Su Yan begged bitterly.

The young man raised his foot and kicked Su Yan’s stomach. He reached out and grabbed Su Yan’s hair while saying, “In a few days? How many days has it been?”

No expression could be seen on Qin Yu’s face.

At this moment, Su Yan saw Qin Yu.

She struggled with all her might and ran to Qin Yu in a panic.

“Qin Yu, save me. Hurry up and save me. I beg you...” Su Yan hugged Qin Yu’s leg and said in a panic.

The few young men hurriedly caught up. They pointed at Qin Yu’s nose and said, “Kid, what’s your relationship with her?”

“He’s my husband!” Su Yan said anxiously.

Hearing the word “husband”, Qin Yu felt a little nauseous.

“You’re her husband? That’s good. She owes us 300,000 yuan. Pay it back for her!” The few young men scolded.

Qin Yu glanced at them and said, “We divorced a long time ago. I have nothing to do with her.”

“Just because you said you two got divorced, that means you two got divorced?” These young men blocked Qin Yu’s way.

Yao Qing said with a cold expression, “Don’t be shameless. Get out of here!”

These young men refused to let them go. Qin Yu couldn’t stand it anymore. He waved his hand and threw them to the ground.

These people got up from the ground, then pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Just you wait!”

After saying this, they turned around and ran.

Su Yan grabbed Qin Yu’s calf and said, “You still love me, don’t you? Otherwise, why would you help me teach them a lesson?”

Qin Yu said with a cold expression, “Su Yan, don’t you feel disgusted when you say these words? Hurry up and get lost. I feel nauseous when I see you now.”

“I don’t believe that you would be so cruel to me! You were very good to me in the past!” Su Yan begged bitterly.

“The past is in the past, and now is the present,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Then, Qin Yu ordered, “Yao Qing, tell her to get lost.”

“Yes, Mr. Qin.” Yao Qing immediately stepped forward, reached out and grabbed Su Yan’s arm, then threw her out.

Su Yan fell to the ground, and warm blood immediately came out of her nose.

However, Qin Yu didn’t even look at her and left in big strides.

...

In the next few days, Qin Yu barely went out.

He stayed at home cultivating and refining medicine all day.

In the blink of an eye, the New Year arrived.

Not many people knew about Qin Yu’s return.

The huge villa appeared extremely vacant and desolate.

Just as Qin Yu was planning to spend the New Year just like that, Yao Qing suddenly ran back excitedly.

He said with a grin, “Mr. Qin, I’ve already booked the place for the New Year’s Eve dinner. It’s getting late. We should set off now!”

“New Year’s Eve dinner?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but be slightly surprised.

Yao Qing said, “It’s the New Year, so we have to celebrate. Don’t rich people like to book hotels to celebrate the New Year? Let’s go. Let’s go and have some fun together.”

Qin Yu thought for a moment, then nodded and agreed, “Okay.”

They drove to a hotel.

At this time, the entrance of the hotel was already full of cars with foreign license plates.

Yao Qing brought Qin Yu to the front desk and said, “My name is Yao Qing. I have reserved table number three.”

“Please wait a moment.” The waiter lowered his head and checked the computer.

Then, she raised her head and said apologetically, “Sir, I’m sorry. Your table is already occupied.”

Yao Qing was stunned. He hurriedly said, “I reserved table number three. I paid the money!”

The waiter said awkwardly, “But... that table is occupied.”

“What’s going on?” At this time, a man in a suit walked over.

Seeing this man, the waiter quickly said, “Manager, this gentleman said that he reserved table three, but table three is already occupied...”

The manager waved his hand and said, “I’ll handle it.”

After saying that, he walked to Yao Qing and said with a nonchalant smile, “Sir, I’m sorry. Your table is indeed occupied. In order to compensate you, our hotel is willing to refund you twice the deposit. What do you think?”

“Refund my *ss! Who needs your money?” Yao Qing said with an angry look.

“I booked it ten days ago. Now, you’re telling me there’s someone else there?”
