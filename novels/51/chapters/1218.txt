Chapter 1219: Chapter 1,219, the competition of the physical body! 

The physical strength of a sea chicken at the peak of the martial saint realm had probably surpassed that of an ordinary Almighty.

More importantly, this was a sea chicken with vigorous qi and blood. It would be the best way to test out this physical body.

Qin Yu raised his head to look at this sea chicken. Then, he hooked his finger and said with a smile, “Come, let me see what you can do.”

The sea chicken seemed to understand Qin Ywords. Its eyes emitted an extremely intense chill. The feathers on its body also stood up like knives.

After an angry roar, the sea chicken’s enormous wings pounced towards Qin Ybody!

Under this intense hurricane, everyone’s movements were affected.

Qin Ybody was like a knife, cutting through the hurricane and easily dodging to the side.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The sea chicken bowed slightly, and the feathers on its back immediately shot towards Qin Yu.

Qin Yu narrowed his eyes. This time, he actually gave up on dodging and planned to take it head-on!

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

All the feathers shot onto Qin Ybody, emitting bs of explosive sounds that were extremely ear-piercing!

However, what was shocking was that Qin Ybody was still pure and flawless. The feathers could not hurt him at all, not even leaving a single white mark!

Everyone was shocked when they saw this!

Even the sea chicken was stunned. It could not believe that someone’s body could reach such a level!

Qin Yu nodded in satisfaction.

Indeed, the strengthening of his body during this period of time was stronger than Qin Yu had imagined!

“Don’t you have any other attacking methods? I still want to try.”Qin Yu opened his mouth, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

The sea chicken was instantly enraged. Two rays of light suddenly shot out from its eyes.

The light poured down like a flood. It was incomparably thick, drowning Qin Yentire body!

But when the light dissipated, Qin Yu was still unharmed.

The strength of this body was even beyond Qin Yimagination!

He lowered his head to look at this strange body of his. He couldn’t help but Mutter in a low voice, “If I recover my spiritual power, God knows what kind of strength I’ll be able to unleash...”

Without spiritual power, he was already like this. If his spiritual power was restored to its peak, even mighty figures might not be his match!

At this moment, a faint light flickered on the back of the sea chicken.

This light was like an invisible hand that was actually changing the feathers and spikes on the back of the sea chicken.

These feathers slowly reassembled on its body, and in the end, they actually turned into two large blood-red hands!

Using the feathers and spikes as bones, they transformed into two large human-shaped hands!

“Oh? There’s actually such a method?”This made Qin Yu unable to help but be greatly shocked.

“Boom!”

Very quickly, the two large hands behind the sea chicken clenched their fists and directly smashed towards Qin Yu!

Qin Yeyes revealed a strong fighting spirit. He grinned and sneered, then clenched his fists and went up to meet it!

In front of sea chicken’s huge hand, Qin Yfist was extremely small, like a grain of sand that was not worth mentioning!

However, it was this extremely small fist that erupted with a power that shook the world!

At the moment of collision, between the two fists, there was actually an extremely dazzling light! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This light was like sparks from the collision between the two of them, but it was like a sun and moon on the sea. It was incomparably bright, making people unable to open their eyes for a moment!

The storm that was swept up almost destroyed the entire island!

This time, neither side seemed to feel anything from the collision.

Qin Yu looked at his fist. It was as good as new.

The Fist of the sea chicken was formed from feathers after all. It did not feel any pain, only a few feathers were scattered.

A trace of fear and anger flashed through the eyes of the sea chicken.

It did not expect that a tiny human would have such terrifying strength!

Qin Yu could not help but laugh out loud, “Not bad, not bad. I have not experienced this kind of hand-to-hand combat for a long time!”

Demonic Beasts were demonic beasts after all, not to mention that it had not yet formed a complete divine sense.

This also resulted in it not having any complicated attacking methods, only having a single method of fighting head-on!

And this was exactly what Qin Yu needed. How could he not be excited!

“Boom!”

Very soon, sea chicken’s second punch had already arrived. Qin Yill chose to fight head-on.

After three consecutive punches, one-third of the feathers and bone spon sea chicken’s fist had already been worn away. This made sea chicken even more furious.

Qin Yeered and said, “You hit me three times. It’s time for you to taste my fist.”

As he spoke, the divine power in Qin Yentire body was boiling.

The originally slender arm was now revealing its blue veins, becoming incomparably thick.

His right fist was tightly clenched, and his momentum was like a dragon!

Qin Yomped his foot, and his body exploded, causing the ground beneath his feet to instantly shatter into pieces!

His body relied on the strength of his body to explode towards the sea chicken.

His fist contained the power to destroy everything in its path. It brought up a strong wind on the surface of the sea, as if it was going to split the surface of the sea into two!

At this moment, everything was making way for Qin Yu. Even the air was sliced open!

Accompanied by Qin Yfurious roar, that divine fist ruthlessly smashed towards the huge body of the sea chicken!
