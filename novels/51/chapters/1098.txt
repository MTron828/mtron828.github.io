Chapter 1099: Chapter 1,099, I want the Demon Beast’s inner core 

Turning around, he saw Qin Yu standing beside Yao Meng.

His eyes were staring straight at the Ten-odd Demon Beasts. His eyes were emitting a greedy light.

“Qin Yu? You’re finally out.”Yao Meng couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

Qin Yu scratched his head and said, “I’m sorry. I didn’t expect the situation to be so anxious.”

Yao Meng rolled her eyes at Qin Yu and said, “I’ll leave the task of protecting the ship to you.”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “Don’t worry.”

After saying that, Qin Yu protected the ship with one hand. Then, his body rose up from the ground. Golden Rays shot in all directions and scattered on the surface of the sea like the rising sun.

“Black Dragon Shark? This is an Earth Rank Demon Beast,”Qin Yu said in a low voice.

At this moment, Chang Mang was swinging his fist at the Black Dragon Shark’s head. The black dragon shark’s huge head was covered in blood.

Qin Yu’s body shook slightly, and his body rose into the air once again.

He put his palms together, and golden palms instantly spread out from his body.

This was the heaven rank technique of the martial arts association of Jingdu, the Thousand Hands of Buddha!

Countless golden palms came from all directions, and wherever they touched, blood and flesh flew everywhere!

The Demon Beast that was already injured was instantly smashed into meat paste by the thousand hands of the Gods and Buddhas!

With the addition of Qin Yu, the situation was instantly reversed.

He clenched his Golden Fist and arrived with a loud bang.

The power that could crush dry weeds and crush rotten wood was unleashed to an unparalleled level. With a “Bang”, it directly shattered the head of a Demon Beast!

Kong Yun’s arm shook, and his long spear pierced through the head of the Demon Beast Like a dragon.

Chu Hedao pressed his palms together, and an intense qi energy burst out, shattering the Demonic Beast’s body.

Zhuang Teng held the divine sword in his hand and rose up from the ground, chopping the demonic beast into two.

The huge demonic beasts fell one after another. Qin Yu, who was at his peak, could be said to be invincible, almost unimpeded.

In a short span of ten minutes, these demonic beasts had already collapsed on the surface of the sea, their internal Qi dispirited.

Everyone’s body was stained with blood, but their internal Qi and blood did not seem to be dispirited. They were full of fighting spirit!

The old man’s expression could not help but change drastically. Seeing that things were not looking good, he turned around and planned to leave.

But at this time, the space in front of him was directly sealed. No matter how hard he tried, he could not break free!

Qin Yu stepped on the surface of the sea and walked over.

His palm shone and the space restriction was lifted.

The old man still wanted to resist, but half of his body was shattered by Qin Yu’s palm.

The old man was extremely terrified. He had been running amok here for many years, but he didn’t expect to be overturned this time!

“Don’t move.”Qin Yu looked at the old man coldly and picked him up like a chicken.

“I have eyes but don’t know the real person. Please spare my life!”The old man said with a trembling voice.

Qin Yu didn’t pay attention to his begging words. Instead, he glanced at the sea and said, “Did you summon all these demonic beasts?”

The old man was stunned, then he nodded in horror.

Qin Yu nodded. He carried the old man all the way to the boat.

“Keep an eye on him,”Qin Yu said.

Chang Mang clenched his fist and said, “Don’t worry!”

After he had finished speaking, Qin Yu stepped forward and arrived in front of these demonic beasts.

He used the bronze sword to cut open the bodies of these demonic beasts and took out the inner core.

It had to be said that the inner core of this martial saint demonic beast was indeed extraordinary. Not only was it bigger than an ordinary inner core, but the spiritual qi emitted from it was also extremely pure.

“TSK TSK, what an unexpected gain.”Qin Yu was faintly excited.

He took out the inner core of these demonic beasts and returned to the boat.

“These inner core are holy items for cultivation. Let’s split them.”Qin Yu distributed the inner core to everyone.

After one round, almost everyone would get two.

Then, Qin Yu walked to the front of the old man.

“I’ll ask you a few questions. You’d better answer truthfully.”Qin Yu squatted in front of him and said.

The old man nodded repeatedly and said, “Don’t worry, I will definitely tell you everything I know!”

Qin Yu pointed at the bodies of those demonic beasts and said, “These demonic beasts have already stepped into the martial saint realm. Why haven’t they transformed into human form? They haven’t even formed a complete divine sense?”

The old man quickly said, “I don’t know either. These beasts were all born at the bottom of the sea. Perhaps... Their IQ is low?”

Qin Yu didn’t care much about this. He continued to ask, “What method did you use to summon these Demon Beasts?”

“This... This is the secret technique of our family,”the old man stammered.

“Secret technique?”Qin Yu raised his eyebrows.

He Teng seemed to know this kind of technique too.

“Teach me this secret technique,”Qin Yu said indifferently.

The old man said with slight embarrassment, “This technique can not be taught because of the restriction of the bloodline. Only those who have the bloodline of our family can learn this technique.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu immediately frowned. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“What the F * ck are you talking about! Are you trying to deceive us?”Chang Mang walked forward and slapped his face.

The old man covered his face and said with an aggrieved expression, “This is true. I swear that I absolutely did not lie to you!”

Qin Yu could not help but frown slightly.

It seemed that he could not kill him for the time being.

“Old Man, I need you to help me with something,”said Qin Yu.

The old man hurriedly nodded and said, “Don’t say just one favor. I can do ten favors!”

Qin Yu nodded slightly and said, “I need you to help me gather demonic beasts. The more the better. The stronger the better.”
