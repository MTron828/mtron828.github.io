Chapter 2735: The Game of Heavenly Sins

Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

The old man stared at Qin Yu, but he didn’t even look at the Saint Crystals on the table.

“Tomb of Heavenly Sins. These four words are worth this much money.” Qin Yu said lightly.

These four words were said by the old Daoist, good friend of Saint Chen Shuang. The fact that he could tell this name meant that the old man’s understanding of this tomb far exceeded that of others.

“Hahaha, that’s true. If you die, it’s useless no matter how much money you have.”

The old man said with a hidden meaning.

“Heavenly Sins, as the name implies, is to offend the heavens. This tomb does not belong to this Saint Kingdom. It will only appear in the land of sinners. When all the sinners die, then only the Tomb of Heavenly Sin will completely disappear.”

The old man said with a smile.

“What is a sinner? Is anyone with this mark a sinner?”

Qin Yu revealed the Mark of Atonement in the middle of his chest.

“No. How do you and I know who the true sinner is? The heavenly secret must not be revealed. I’m sure that the final sin of the Tomb of Heavenly Sins this time is not on you. However, you are already in the trap.”

The old man said with a smile.

Qin Yu frowned slightly. The old man only told half the story. It was difficult to tell if he was telling the truth or not.

However, he knew the Tomb of Heavenly Sins. Therefore, it was hard for Qin Yu to make a judgment.

Qin Yu suddenly looked at the old man’s chest.

He was surprised to find out that he also had the Mark of Atonement on his body. The mark was even faintly glowing with a glass-like red light now, looking extremely terrifying.

“Why is your mark different from mine?”

Qin Yu frowned and asked.

“You’ll know the reason tonight. When you’re completely the same as us, come and find me here. You’ll understand all the information at that time.”

After the old man finished speaking, he returned to his previous state. No matter how Qin Yu asked, he did not answer Qin Yu’s question.

Could it be that the tomb is going to start killing people today, and it’s his turn?

If the waiter didn’t lie, the number of people killed by the tomb would increase exponentially.

The number of people it killed tonight was terrifying.

Qin Yu felt extremely uneasy. Two thousand people were killed and no one could detect the appearance of the killer. This unknown power was the most terrifying.

On the other side of the magical artifact trading market at this moment, many people were surrounding the stalls selling detensive magical artitacts.

Those defensive magical artifacts of better quality were ten times more expensive than before.

Of course, the people who were trying to buy these Saint Crystals were all people with the mark on their bodies. The old man was right, so what if they had a lot of Saint Crystals after losing their lives? “Little brother, are you satisfied with this transaction?”

Wang Da suddenly appeared and asked with a smile.

‘ Yes.” Qin Yu nodded slightly. “Can you look for people here? I want to find some information about a group of people.”

“This isn’t a good place to find people. Lingxu City is also known as the City of Graves. People are dying around here at all times. It’s almost impossible to find someone from such a densely populated place unless one’s luck is extremely good.”

When Wang Da heard that it was a mission to find someone, he was instantly deflated.

“It’s fine. Just do your best. We can only try our best and leave everything else to the fate. This is the deposit.”

Qin Yu threw a crystal ball that recorded the information of Ruoxue and the others to Wang Da and then handed over ten pieces of third-grade Saint Crystal.

“Alright. The Upper Eight Paths won’t bother to look for people, but the people at the bottom of the Lower Eight Paths can still be mobilized. There are still quite many low-level aborigines here. I happen to have a way. But let me say this first. Even if we can’t find the people, we won’t refund.”

Wang Da’s eyes lit up when he saw the money. His voice became much louder.

“If you have any information, inform me immediately.”

Qin Yu left behind a messenger talisman. Although he did not have much hope of finding someone in the vast sea of people, he had to give it a try.

Moreover, this thing also depended on the person. Since this person dared to charge a fee of third-grade Saint Crystal, he must be somewhat trustworthy.

After returning to the place he stayed, Qin Yu went straight to the new room that the waiter had arranged for him.

He sat cross-legged on the futon. Then he took off his shirt and revealed his muscular body.

He carefully recalled the conversation he had with the old man today.

There seemed to be more and more mysteries.

The Tomb of Heavenly Sins wanted to kill those who had offended the heavens. Was he one of them?

Could it be because of his father? But wasn’t his father a Guardian? He should be on Heaven’s side.

If he wasn’t the person the Tomb of Heavenly Sins wanted to kill this time, then who was the person this time?

Who was it that could trigger such a terrifying force?

Riddles linked together echoed in Qin Yu’s mind one after another, making his heart feel like it was in a mess.

Suddenly, everything fell silent.

In an instant, the air flowed and the void fluctuated.

Even the gravitational pull on the ground stopped in an instant.

There was only a boundless deathly stillness. Qin Yu could hear the loud sound of air currents between breaths.

At the entrance, the cheap wooden door was pushed open.

A figure in white appeared at the door. The strangest thing was that he was carrying a huge tombstone on his back.

Qin Yu’s heart began to beat violently. He saw his name on the tombstone.

Even his birth characters were carved on it.

The blood-red cinnabar was carefully painted at the protruding words, which looked verv evil. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Thump! Thump! Thump!

Qin Yu’s heart was beating very fast.

It was not because he had seen this strange scene, but because he had seen it before.

He saw three scenes of him dying when Chen Shuang’s good friend, the old Daoist, used Ethereal Enlightenment. This was one of them.

The person in front of him was not on the same level as him at all.

The white figure untied the belt on his body and placed the heavy tombstone on the ground.

He sat in front of Qin Yu, but strangely, Qin Yu could not see his face at all.

“I will play a game with you. If you lose, you will die.”

That person’s voice was very strange as if it was the voice of a dead person.

As soon as he finished speaking, a familiar street appeared in front of him.

The street split into two, then into four, and then continued to split.

Yan Ruoxue, Zhan Pu, Chang Mang, Jue Wu, Lei Xin, Flower Granny, and Xiao Yu. They all appeared in front of him.

“Find me among these people. The game begins.”

The voice came out of the man’s mouth without any fluctuation.

Qin Yu’s body trembled slightly. He remembered that he had found Yan Ruoxue at that time.

Ruoxue’s behavior was different from what he knew, so he was certain that the person was not her.

However, that was how Yan Ruoxue behaved when she was imprisoned on Earth. At that time, she was on the verge of despair and even wanted to commit suicide..
