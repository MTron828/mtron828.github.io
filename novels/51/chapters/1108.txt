Chapter 1109: Chapter 1,109, deceiving the Cloud Dragon 

This crazy idea took root and sprouted in Qin Yu’s heart.

Only in this way would it be the safest and most beneficial.

“If he doesn’t have the intention to harm me, then it’s My Fault.”Qin Yu sighed slightly in his heart.

He wasn’t in a hurry to act. Instead, he slowly refined the pill.

When night fell, Qin Yu stopped refining the pill. He found a place and planned to rest for a while. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Why did you stop?”Yun long asked quickly.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Even a capitalist has to give the workers time to rest. What, do you want me to refine pills twenty-four hours a day?”

Yun long snorted lightly and said, “As a martial saint, how can you be so tired so easily?”

Qin Yu said with some displeasure, “Don’t you know that refining pills is an arduous task?”

Yun long opened his mouth and was about to speak.

At this moment, the voice of that mighty figure came from the valley.

“He’s right. Refining a pill for a day will indeed consume a large amount of divine sense power, even for top alchemists,”said that mighty figure.

Although Yun Long was somewhat displeased, he could only give up since even his master had spoken.

“Bring Me the heaven essence pill you refined today,”said the almighty expert.

Qin Yu’s eyes couldn’t help but narrow slightly.

They had just begun, and he was already asking for the Heaven Essence Pill. Could it be that he was afraid that he would escape?

Although he had this thought in his heart, Qin Yu still handed the Heaven Essence Pill to Yun long.

“Kid, I will only give you two hours to rest,”yun long said coldly after taking the pill.

Qin Yu did not say anything. He lay on the ground and closed his eyes slightly.

Yun long, on the other hand, took the pill and turned around to walk into the depths of the valley.

After he walked for a moment, an undetectable strand of divine sense flew out from Qin Yu’s glabella.

This strand of divine sense passed through the flower fields and followed Yun long all the way to the vicinity of the valley.

“Master.”Yun long half-knelt at the entrance of the valley.

In a short while, an illusory figure floated out from the valley.

“This strand of divine sense doesn’t have any power. It’s different from that high-ranking official from back then.”Qin Yu stared at this strand of divine sense and thought to himself.

Yun long spread out his hands and took out the heavenly essence pill in his hands.

That mighty figure glanced at it and said with slight surprise, “It really is a heavenly essence pill. This child is quite talented.”

Yun Long’s expression slightly changed and he hurriedly said, “Master, don’t tell me you have a Compassionate Heart?”

“Compassionate Heart?”That mighty figure sneered.

“I’ve crossed a thousand years. To me, my feelings have long been thrown out of the clouds.”

Yun long let out a sigh of relief and said, “Then I can be at ease. This kid has rebelled. I absolutely can not let him live.”

That mighty figure said indifferently, “That won’t be necessary. After the seal is lifted, if he is willing to continue refining pills for me, I can consider sparing his life. After all, an alchemist is still valuable.”

“Master is right.”Yun long hurriedly bowed and said.

Hearing this, Qin Yu’s divine sense quietly returned to his main body.

“This old thing really doesn’t have good intentions.”Qin Yu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

He sat up from the ground and said in a low voice, “In that case, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

Qin Yu didn’t hurry to move. He lay on the ground and slowly recovered his internal Qi.

Soon, Yun Long returned to Qin Yu’s side.

He sized up Qin Yu and after making sure that there was nothing unusual about Qin Yu, he sat on the side.

About two hours later, Yun long kicked Qin Yu’s body.

“Two hours have passed. You should get up and work,”Yun Long said coldly.

Although Qin Yu was extremely angry, he didn’t show it on his face.

He looked at Yun Long and said with a smile, “Yun long, I was thinking when I was resting. According to the current progress, I can’t refine too many heavenly essence pills in half a month. I Can’t use up all of these strange flowers.”

Yun long frowned slightly and said coldly, “What do you mean?”

Qin Yu said, “With my alchemy skills, I can actually refine several pills at the same time.”

“If I refine ten or even a hundred strange flowers at the same time, the time will be greatly shortened.”

Yun long swept his gaze toward the flower field.

There were only a hundred odd flowers in this huge flower field.

If he could refine them in one go, it would naturally be the best.

Yun long sized up Qin Yu from head to toe and said, “Why are you so kind?”

“Kind?”Qin Yu scoffed.

“Yun long, what do you mean by that? I have a cooperative relationship with your master. The More Heavenly Essence Pills I refine, the more I will naturally obtain.”

“Your master also said that I only have half a month’s time. Of course, I hope to get a few more heavenly essence pills.”

Speaking up to this point, Qin Yu asked in return, “But you, what do you mean by that? Saying that I’m kind-hearted? You guys aren’t planning to burn the bridge after crossing the river, right?”

The sudden question made Yun Long, who was already not very smart, change his expression slightly.

He quickly said, “You... Don’t talk nonsense. I was just asking casually.”

Qin Yu snorted lightly, “I don’t believe you, but I believe your master. After all, he is a senior at the Almighty Realm. I think he would not lie to a little martial saint like me.”

“Of course, of course,”Yun long quickly said.

Qin Yu waved his hand and said, “Then don’t waste time. Hurry up and pick the strange flowers. Time is money.”

Yun long walked towards the flower field while thinking to himself, “You scared me. I almost got exposed. Fortunately, this kid’s brain is not very good.”

Qin Yu was also sneering in his heart.

“This Yun Long’s brain is really not very good. He was led astray by me with just a few words,”Qin Yu said with a sneer.
