Anger filled Yan Sihai’s chest.

Yan Sihai had only recently learned about the information that the youth had mentioned.

But he had never thought that this news would spread to the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“Hua Xing, don’t be rude,” Qu Xie said in a low voice.

The youth called Hua Xing took two steps back and didn’t say anything more.

Qu Xie stood up and said, “President Yan, it’s not a problem for you to find a bodyguard. What are your requirements?”

Yan Sihai snorted and said, “The stronger the better.”

Qu Xie smiled and said, “Come with me.”

The two turned around and walked straight into the prison of the Martial Arts Association.

Soon, they passed by the place where Yan Ruoxue was imprisoned.

Seeing the pale-faced Yan Ruoxue, Yan Sihai’s expression changed.

Yan Ruoxue, who was imprisoned in the prison, suddenly narrowed her eyes.

She seemed to want to say something, but she seemed to have lost her strength and couldn’t say a word.

“What’s going on?” Yan Sihai said coldly.

Qu Xie didn’t try to hide it from Yan Sihai. He said with a smile, “Why would President Yan care about this?”

Yan Sihai snorted and said, “After all, Yan Ruoxue is my niece.”

“Hahahaha!” Qu Xie couldn’t help but laugh.

“President Yan, if Yan Ruoxue goes out, aren’t you afraid that your position in the Yan family will be jeopardized?” Qu Xie said jokingly.

Yan Sihai frowned, and a trace of hesitation flashed across his face.

Of course, he was worried, especially when he learned that Old Mister Yan had secretly groomed a group of Martial Marquises.

For the sake of control over the Yan family, he could even kill his own father, let alone his niece.

“Let’s go.” In the end, Yan Sihai ignored Yan Ruoxue.

Xie Qu sneered. The two of them went straight to a prison of the Martial Arts Association.

In this prison, a thin man was imprisoned.

The man was sitting cross-legged on the ground and his body was exuding internal qi.

“How is he?” Qu Xie pointed at the man and asked.

Yan Sihai sized him up and asked, “What’s his strength?”

“Peak Martial Marquis,” Qu Xie said slowly.

Even Yan Sihai couldn’t help but be surprised.

“Okay, he will do!” Yan Sihai put out his cigar and sneered.

...

There were only three days left until Monday.

In these few days, Qin Yu wasn’t in the mood to cultivate.

Ordinary cultivation had already begun to lose its effect on him, unless there were ten-thousand-year-old herbs, golden cores, demonic beast inner cores, spirit veins, and so on.

Therefore, these few days, he had been sending people to inquire about the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

“You’re very knowledgeable. Do you know about a material called Black Gold Stone?” Qin Yu asked.

When he heard the mention of the Black Gold Stone, the man with the mustache immediately ran over.

“What? Do you have a Black Gold Stone? Where is it? Bring me there!” the man with the mustache said excitedly.

Qin Yu shook his head and said, “No, I’ve heard of the Black Gold Stone, but I don’t know about it.”

A hint of disappointment flashed across the man’s face. He sat next to Qin Yu and muttered, “I got happy for nothing.”

“What kind of material is Black Gold Stone?” Qin Yu asked.

The man with the mustache slowly said, “The Black Gold Stone is said to be the hardest material in the world. It’s said that this material can even resist a Martial Saint’s attack.”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but gasp.

It could resist the Martial Saint’s attack? Wasn’t this too exaggerated?

“The prison of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association seems to be using the Black Gold Stone.” Qin Yu said with a frown.

Thinking of this, he looked at the man with the mustache and said, “If it can even resist a Martial Saint’s attack, then doesn’t that mean that no one can break the defense of the Black Gold Stone?”

“That’s not true.” The man with the mustache shook his head.

“If there’s the strongest shield, there is definitely have the sharpest spear.”

“There is a material called the Golden Feather Stone. This Golden Feather Stone is the nemesis of the Black Gold Stone, but I have never seen it before.”

Qin Yu’s brows instantly furrowed even more tightly.

Regardless of whether it was the Martial Saint or the Golden Feather Stone, it was still far away for Qin Yu.

Could it be that Yan Ruoxue had to suffer in prison until he found the Golden Feather Stone or stepped into the Martial Saint Realm?

“Is there no other way?” Qin Yu asked in a deep voice.

The man with the mustache spread his hands and said, “As far as I know, there is none.”

Qin Yu was silent.

“Don’t be too anxious about some things. You can’t achieve anything by being anxious.” The man with the mustache patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said nothing more.

Time flew. There was only one day left until Monday.

Jingdu Martial Arts Association.

A man in a black and gold robe stood in front of Qu Xie.

This man was Yan Guiyi.

“President Qu, are you sure that Qin Yu will participate in this experiential learning?” Yan Guiyi asked coldly.

“He knows that the Jingdu Martial Arts Association won’t let him go, so why would he come to court death?”

Qu Xie smiled. “You don’t understand people who climb up from the bottom.”

“For us, the risk must be controlled within a certain range before we consider the benefits.”

“But for people like them, as long as the temptation is big enough, he will try no matter how high the risk is.”

Yan Guiyi played with the two black beads in his hand and snorted. “As long as he dares to come, I won’t let him go.”

Thinking back to the time when he was played by Qin Yu, Yan Guiyi was furious.

Qu Xie said indifferently, “Many people want him dead. As long as he dares to participate, he will die without a doubt!”

At this moment, Xia Hang walked in with two people.

“President Qu, Mr. Han is here,” Xia Hang said.

The people who came were Han Meng and Han Wei.

During this period of time, Han Wei’s body had basically recovered, but his strength had stagnated for a long time. He couldn’t even squeeze into the top ten of the ranking list.

“Mr. Han, why are you here?” Qu Xie asked indifferently.

Qu Xie’s attitude toward Han Meng was completely different from his attitude toward Yan Sihai.

When facing Han Meng, Qu Xie seemed condescending.

Han Meng bowed and said, “President Qu, my son, Han Wei, also wants to participate in this experiential learning.”

Qu Xie rubbed his chin and said, “Mr. Han, this doesn’t seem to be in accordance with the rules.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Han Meng gritted his teeth and said, “President Qu, take it that the Han family owes you a favor.”

Qu Xie stood up and said with a smile, “It’s not difficult to put him in, but... Qin Yu will also participate in this experiential learning.”

At the mention of Qin Yu’s name, Han Wei’s eyes widened and his fists couldn’t help but clench!

Han Meng noticed Han Wei’s reaction. He took a deep breath and said, “President Qu, this is exactly why I came to look for you.”

“Ever since my son lost, Qin Yu seems to have become his inner demon, causing a great hindrance to his future cultivation.”

“So... I hope President Qu can use this opportunity to kill Qin Yu! Kill Qin Yu in front of my son!”
