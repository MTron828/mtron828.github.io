Chapter 1699: Chapter 1699, the so-called balance of yin and Yang 1 Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

When he heard this, Yong Ji looked at Sima Bei coldly.

He raised his eyebrows and said, “Why don’t you go find Xiao Sheng?”

Sima bei was stunned, and then he snorted coldly, “Why should I look for him? I don’t care about the so-called reputation.”

“Really?”Yong ji sneered, “You may not care about the reputation, but don’t you care about the psychological trauma?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After saying this, Yong Ji turned around and left.

Sima Bei’s face was as dark as water, and he seemed to be very angry.

However, facing the current Yong Ji, there was nothing he could do.

…

After a few days, Qin Yu finally arrived at Xiao Sheng’s destination.

Like other places where dark energy was prevalent, this place was also cold and desolate.

With a glance, it seemed to be a big pit.

Nothing could be seen inside the pit, only countless sand and stones.

Qin Yu walked into the pit. He bent down and picked up a handful of yellow sand and rubbed it in his palm.

Obviously, this was not some yellow sand, but sand and stones formed after the body and bones were crushed.

“It seems that this place was once a battlefield,”Qin Yu sighed.

Without a battlefield, such dark energy would not have formed.

Qin Yu did not think too much about it. He sat down cross-legged and began to absorb the surrounding dark energy.

It had to be said that after the great change in the world, Qin Yu’s cultivation speed had also increased greatly.

The dark energy surged into Qin Yu’s body crazily. In just a few days, it had reached a balance with Qin Yu’s spiritual Qi.

Such a speed was really shocking.

In just a few days, the dark energy in Qin Yu’s body had reached saturation, and it seemed like he could step into the late stage of the Almighty realm at any time.

Qin Yu opened his eyes slightly. He tried to sense the dark energy around him, but what surprised him was that the dark energy here had almost disappeared!

“How could this be?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but widen his eyes!

According to his own calculation, the dark energy here was enough for him to cultivate for a long time. It was impossible for it to disappear in a short period of time!

Qin Yu frowned. He tried to continue to absorb the dark energy, but to his surprise, the dark energy here was indeed gone!

This immediately gave Qin Yu a slight headache. He stood there with a frown and didn’t say a word.

A moment later, he seemed to have guessed something.

“Could it be… after the great change in the world, the speed of absorbing the dark energy also increased?”Qin Yu took a deep breath.

At the same time, he also considered another terrifying fact.

After the great change in the world, the dark energy would become less and less because the spiritual Qi would become more and more.

The so-called golden age was when the yin and yang were not balanced.

When the world declined, the dark energy would flourish, and the golden age would flourish with the spiritual energy.

This was definitely not good news for Qin Yu.

It was already difficult to find the dark energy, and now it was even more difficult.

Other People’s cultivation became simpler, but Qin Yu’s cultivation became even more difficult.

This made Qin Yu not dare to waste any more time. He hurriedly left this place and rushed to the Tianyun sect.

Other than Xiao Sheng from the Tianyun sect, Qin Yu could not think of anyone else who could help him resolve his doubts.

After rushing all the way to the Tianyun sect, Qin Yu discovered that the number of people on the road to the Tianyun sect’s courtyard had decreased by a lot.

Everyone seemed to be in closed-door cultivation, wanting to ride the wind and rise through the golden great world.

This immediately made Qin Yu even more anxious. He quickly rushed to the Cultivation Mountain and shouted loudly for Xiao Sheng.

A moment later, a passage appeared on the Cultivation Mountain.

Qin Yu rushed up the cultivation mountain and found Xiao Sheng who was comprehending dao under the tree.

“I’m really sorry to disturb you again,”Qin Yu said with a slightly guilty expression.

Xiao Sheng turned around and said indifferently, “The dark energy there is not enough to support your cultivation?”

This time, Qin Yu was not surprised because he knew that Xiao Sheng must have expected it.

Therefore, Qin Yu didn’t hide anything and immediately told Xiao Sheng what he was thinking.

After Xiao Sheng heard this, he smiled and said, “You are right. In the future, the dark energy in the world will become less and less. Of course, the dark energy will not completely disappear. In some places, even in the golden era, the dark energy will not disappear.”

Qin Yu immediately asked, “Where?”

Xiao Sheng’s jade-like fingers pointed towards the north.

“That place is ready-made.”Xiao Sheng smiled.

Qin Yu frowned and said hurriedly, “Are we going to the north? I did have this idea, but I don’t have senior Xiao Hai’s ability. I can not forcefully cross the river of death.”

“No one asked you to forcefully cross the river of death,”Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu frowned and said, “Is there another way?”

“No,”Xiao Sheng said.

Qin Yu:”…”

At this moment, Xiao Sheng changed the topic and said, “Wait until the river of death disappears, then you can go to the northern lands.”

“Then it’ll be too late!”Qin Yu frowned and said.

“What’s too late and what’s too late?”Xiao Sheng asked in puzzlement.

“Do you think that the war between the southern region and the northern lands is inextricably linked to you?”

Qin Yu opened his mouth, but was momentarily speechless.

“My views have always been different from Xiao Hai’s. He always believed that everyone should get enough resources, and everyone should unite and help each other. In every battle, the key factor that determines victory or defeat is everyone’s unity,”Xiao Sheng said faintly.

“I understand and respect his thoughts. This is the result of the environment that he and I grew up in.”

“But he didn’t realize that generations have changed. The environment that everyone lives in has also changed. At this level, what do you think is the key factor that determines victory and defeat?”Xiao Sheng suddenly asked Qin Yu.

Qin Yu tried to answer, “The highest combat strength?”

“That’s right,”Xiao Sheng said plainly.

“The battle between the northern and southern regions will ultimately be between me and elementalists.”

“So, go back to what you were supposed to do.”

Even though that was the case, Qin Yu still felt a little worried.

Of course, he knew that what Xiao Sheng said was right, but that didn’t mean that Xiao Hai was wrong.

This world was supposed to have many kinds of thinking. Only by coexisting could it be complete.

Therefore, in such a big battle, Qin Yu would never bet on anyone.

What was in his hands was real.

“What about the northern lands?”Qin Yu asked.

Xiao Sheng smiled and said, “The graves of the great cultivators at the tribulation stage are either somewhere in the ancient battlefield or the emperor’s grave.”

“The big graves of such cultivators are hardly affected by the heaven and earth. but which one of these three do you think you can find easily?”

Qin Yu didn’t say anything and couldn’t help but sigh slightly.

Xiao Sheng patted Qin Yu’s shoulder and said, “You should go to the north. Besides cultivating, you might be able to do something else, or even get more.”

Qin Yu smiled bitterly and said, “Sigh, maybe that’s the only way. But before that, I don’t think I’ll just wait.”
