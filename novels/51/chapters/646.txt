Xia Hang looked left and right, and his face was full of fear.

Qin Yu said coldly from the side, “I’m different from you guys. At least I have humanity.”

Xia Hang looked at Qin Yu with a slightly complicated gaze.

“Daughter, go back to your room first,” Xia Hang said softly.

After sending the little girl back to her room, Xia Hang walked to Qin Yu.

Just as he opened his mouth, Qin Yu suddenly kicked Xia Hang’s lower abdomen!

This kick sent Xia Hang flying!

His knees kneeled on the ground!

“Xia Hang, how dare you.” Qin Yu said coldly.

Xia Hang climbed up from the ground, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and said coldly, “Do whatever you want.”

“Is that so?!” Qin Yu was furious. He strode forward and raised his hand to slap Xia Hang’s face!

Xia Hang knew that he was no match for Qin Yu, so he simply gave up resisting and let Qin Yu beat him.

Qin Yu looked at Xia Hang coldly and said, “You can actually disregard the life and death of your daughter. Are you still human?”

Xia Hang gritted his teeth and said, “I would rather believe in the martial arts association than you!”

“Really?” Hearing this, Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly changed his mind.

He sized up Xia Hang in front of him and said, “It’s easy for me to kill you now.”

Xia Hang kept silent. It was impossible for him not to be afraid. Facing death, anyone would be terrified.

“But I don’t want to kill you,” Qin Yu said.

“Xia Hang, let me make a bet with you.”

Xia Hang raised his head to look at Qin Yu and said, “What are you betting on?”

“I’m betting on whether the Jingdu Martial Arts Association is trustworthy or not.” Qin Yu sat on the sofa.

He took a cigarette from Xia Hang and stuffed it into his mouth. Then, he said nonchalantly, “You can go and tell the Jingdu Martial Arts Association everything that happened. See if they will help you or not.”

When Xia Hang heard this, he couldn’t help but snort. “Qin Yu, in your eyes, is Jingdu Martial Arts Association so weak?”

“If I tell them the truth, they will definitely think of a way to save my daughter!”

“Okay.” The corner of Qin Yu’s mouth curled up into a sneer.

“If they really help you, I won’t come to find you again from now on,” Qin Yu said.

“But if they don’t help you, then you have to work for me, okay?”

Xia Hang sneered. “Qin Yu, you’re going to lose for sure!”

“Okay, it’s a deal.” Qin Yu was too lazy to talk nonsense with Xia Hang. He immediately got up and left.

The next day.

Qu Xie was sitting in the office with a livid face.

It had been several days since the black-robed man appeared, but they still couldn’t capture him.

Not only would this have a huge negative impact on the reputation of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, but it would also make the people above them doubt their ability to handle matters!

“The higher-ups have already given the order to capture this black-robed man no matter what.” Qu Xie took a deep breath.

But the last time was their best opportunity. Now that they had missed it, how could the black-robed man fall for it?

“President Qu, I have an idea,” the assistant suddenly said.

Qu Xie glanced at him and nodded. “Speak.”

The assistant sneered. “Now, we have basically confirmed the relationship between the black-robed man and Qin Yu, and what he did seems to be related to Yan Ruoxue’s bloodline.”

Qu Xie nodded. “And then?”

The assistant said indifferently, “We can spread the word that Yan Ruoxue will be publicly executed! I don’t believe that the black-robed man won’t show up!”

“As long as he dares to show up, we will immediately kill him!”

This idea sounded really good!

Even Qu Xie’s eyes couldn’t help but light up!

“It’s a good idea, but Yan Ruoxue is the eldest daughter of the Yan family after all. Publicly executing her? Isn’t that a slap to the Yan family’s face?” Qu Xie frowned.

“Even if Yan Sihai has no feelings for Yan Ruoxue, in order to protect the dignity of the Yan family, Yan Sihai will definitely punish us.”

The assistant curled his lips and said, “President Qu, why are you so afraid of Yan Sihai?”

“You don’t understand.” Qu Xie shook his head.

The assistant spread his hands and said, “Then there’s nothing I can do. In any case, if we can’t catch him, the higher-ups will definitely hold us accountable.”

“At that time, they might even shut down the Jingdu Martial Arts Association.”

Qu Xie’s expression was extremely gloomy, and he couldn’t make up his mind for a moment.

“Forget it. I’ll go and discuss it with Yan Sihai. Maybe we can come up with a foolproof plan,” said Qu Xie with narrowed eyes.

At this moment, someone suddenly rushed in from outside.

The moment he saw Qu Xie, he fell to his knees with a thud.

This person was none other than Xia Hang!

“Xia Hang, what are you doing?” Qu Xie asked with a frown.

Xia Hang said anxiously, “President Qu, that black-robed man poisoned my daughter. You have to help me!”

“Poisoned your daughter?” Qu Xie couldn’t help but squint.

“Why would he do that to your daughter?”

Xia Hang gritted his teeth and immediately told Qu Xie what had happened.

“You know, I only have one daughter...” Xia Hang said in pain.

“For my daughter, I have to listen to his orders. My daughter is only four years old. I... I can’t watch her die.”

“President Qu, with the Jingdu Martial Arts Association’s ability, they can definitely get rid of the poison in my daughter’s body. Please help me...”

Looking at Xia Hang, who was begging bitterly, Qu Xie looked extremely gloomy.

His attention wasn’t on Xia Hang’s daughter at all. Instead, he said with a cold expression, “So... you were the one who tipped off the black-robed man?”

Xia Hang’s expression changed. He hurriedly said, “President Qu, I... I had no choice. If I didn’t listen to his orders, my daughter, he...”

“Bastard!” However, Qu Xie slapped Xia Hang!

This slap caused Xia Hang to bleed profusely and it broke his sternum!

“You actually dared to inform that black-robed man? No wonder we couldn’t catch him,” Qu Xie said coldly.

Xia Hang struggled to get up from the ground. He gritted his teeth and said, “President Qu, I can’t lose my daughter... I was forced...”

“No matter how you punish me, I will accept it. I only hope that you can save my daughter! Otherwise, my daughter will definitely die...”

Qu Xie sneered. “Xia Hang, you have been in the Jingdu Martial Arts Association for many years, right?”

Xia Hang nodded and said, “Twenty-one years.”

Qu Xie narrowed his eyes and said, “Then you should understand a principle. Once a person has a weakness, they will lose their value. And your daughter is your weakness!”

“If you want to succeed, you have to get rid of your own weakness!”

Xia Hang’s expression changed, and he asked in a trembling voice, “What... What do you mean?”

Qu Xie put his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “This is a good opportunity. As long as your daughter is gone, your weakness will disappear, and your future achievements will be even higher.”

“Since your daughter has been poisoned, then use this opportunity to get rid of your own weakness.”
