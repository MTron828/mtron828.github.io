2286 Inhumane

After saying that, the two headed straight to the teleportation formation. There was a teleportation formation to the Heavenly Cloud Continent here. Thus it only took a while to get there.

When they arrived at the Heavenly Cloud Continent, the weather was warm, the sun shone brightly, and the lush forest stretched out in all directions.

Spiritual energy filled the air. It could be considered a hideaway holy land in this galaxy.

However, at this moment, the smell of blood was permeating the air.

After entering the Yun family, Qin Yu’s heart was full of killing intent seeing the scene before his eyes.

The majority of the Yun family’s cultivators in green robes were severely injured at this moment. Hundreds of corpses were lying on the ground.

Several vicious cultivators were assaulting a few young girls, and they let out cries of pain and agony.

A few people even set up a fire to roast “meat” and ate the “meat” while drinking.

“This newborn’s flesh is even more tender. Try it if you don’t believe me!”

“This True Saint’s flesh is really tasty. After taking a bite, I feel my spiritual energy fulfilled.”

“Hahaha, this place is so enjoyable!”

“I’ll try other girls later when I’m full. The girls from the Yun family are not bad. I heard that the younger daughter of the Yun family is even more tender!”

The entire Yun family was like hell. It displayed vividly the evil of human nature.

…

“In a chaotic world, regardless of the demon or human race, it’s impossible for humanity to exist.”

As if sensing Qin Yu’s raging fury, Elder Guai sighed softly and fell silent.

Qin Yu came to the seven or eight cultivators who were roasting meat. Suo Lin’s boxing gloves emitted a scarlet light, and lava slowly dripped down from the gloves.

“Brother, you should try it too. By the way, who are you? Why haven’t I seen you before?”

A person who was eating a human leg shouted.

Before he could finish speaking, his head had been crushed into a bloody mist by Qin Yu.

“You’re courting death!”

The other people’s expressions changed drastically. They released their spiritual energy one after another and pounced toward Qin Yu.

“Whoosh!”

Qin Yu threw a punch, and the scorching flames on Suo Lin’s boxing gloves fell on them. Immediately, the seven cultivators let out enormous cries of agony.

Regardless of the methods used, they could not extinguish this terrifying flame.

Under Qin Yu’s control, the flames burned their bodies tremendously slowly, causing them to feel tremendous pain until their divine sense were burned to ashes at the last moment.

“Mr. Qin, the family head and young miss should be at the back of the mountain. There’s a formation there that can slightly defend against that monk.”

Seeing Qin Yu’s overwhelming strength, the young girl covered her mouth with both hands in shock and anxiously led the way.

Along the way, Qin Yu killed everyone he saw with the cruelest methods, showing no mercy.

They arrived at the back mountain of the Yun family. At this moment, dozens of people gathered in front of the formation.

The protective formation had already been shattered. The group of people from the Yun family trembled and hid together.

“Hua Tian, take all the three Green Spirit Trees you want. I’ve also agreed to all your conditions. Please stop now.”

A gray-haired elderly man pleaded.

“Haha, what do you mean by stop? I, Hua Tian, have cultivated for so many years. Without this kid from the Mysterious Dark Sect leading the way, I wouldn’t have known the existence of such a holy land here. If you want me to stop, I can. Let your daughter be my slave for 200 years. Maybe I’ll give you all a quick death if I’m in a good mood.”

The monk laughed heartily as if finding this jesting greatly enjoyable.

Yun Qingyun grabbed a dagger tightly and suddenly slid it toward her neck.

However, her body suddenly froze. The monk grabbed at the air, and the massive hand formed by the air prevented her from moving.

“Don’t rush, young lady. Wait for me to shower you with affection first.”

Hua Tian laughed loudly and said.

“You’re laughing very happily!”

Qin Yu appeared in front of Yun Qingyun and the others.

The sudden appearance of Qin Yu stunned both parties. The monk rubbed his bald head and asked.

“Where did this idiot come from? Did he really think the fourth-grade True Saint was that great?”

“Qin Yu, how did you end up here?”

Nangong Qi’s initially mocking expression suddenly froze.

“Lord Hua Tian, this guy is quite strong. He even defeated Shui Yuan.”

Nangong Qi quickly reminded Hua Tian. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“It’s normal for that good-for-nothing Shui Yuan to lose. The four of you attack him and dismember his limbs. It’s just nice for dinner tonight.”

Hua Tian patted his round belly, not taking Nangong Qi’s reminder to heart at all.

Several people beside him immediately made a move, releasing powerful spiritual energy that shocked the people of the Yun family who were hiding behind.

“Qin Yu, be careful!”

Yun Qingyun clenched her fists tightly.

These four people had the strength of the fourth grade. They felt very safe to fight four against one.

Qin Yu stomped his foot, and the spatial energy was instantly compressed to the extreme.

The nearly substantial spatial energy firmly trapped the group, making them unable to move in front of Qin Yu.

“You guys seem to like torturing people?”

Qin Yu crushed a person’s fist, and he instantly let out a heaven-shaking wail.

Qin Yu placed his hands in front of his mouth, and the palm formed by the air immediately pressed down on his throat, stopping his screams.

From his feet, Qin Yu crushed every inch of his bones bit by bit. Finally, he crushed his head.

The second person, the third person…

There was not a trace of mercy in Qin Yu’s eyes.

Qin Yu could understand if they were fighting for resources. However, these people even ate children. This was a distorted mentality and even a pervert.

“Niu Er, you attack.”

Hua Tian said coldly.

“Big Brother, I might not be his match. Why don’t we attack together?”

The cultivator called Niu Er’s expression changed drastically, even though Qin Yu was only a fourth-grade True Saint.

However, he used the most terrifying torture method to kill four fourth-grade cultivators when he was surrounded. Even Hua Tian would find it difficult to do so.

“I will directly cripple you if you continue to talk nonsense.”

Hua Tian glanced at him.

Seeing Hua Tian’s eyes full of killing intent, Niu Er had no choice.

“Great. There’s actually a fifth grade.”

Niu Er released the spiritual energy on his body to the extreme, and the aura of fifth grade soared into the sky.

He pointed his hands toward the sky, and an obscure power of domain power spread out from his body. Then, he slammed the ground.

The Ultimate Cessation!

Niu Er roared. The power of domain suddenly penetrated Qin Yu’s body.

His body sank slightly, and the circulation of the chaotic qi became a little obscure.

“In my domain, you can’t use any techniques. Go to hell now!”

Niu Er’s body was like a tiger as he pounced toward Qin Yu. His palm carried vigorous spiritual energy as he slapped Qin Yu’s head.

“Clang!”

A crisp sound rang out.

“This is your full power attack?”

Qin Yu stared at him expressionlessly.

Niu Er’s body trembled. What was going on? Did this fellow use his physical strength to take on a full-powered attack from a fifth-grade True Saint?

Qin Yu’s palm formed into a claw, and he felt like being gripped by a tremendous force, making him completely immobilized.
