Chapter 518: Fighting Xia Hang! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

That huge hand ruthlessly pressed down on Yan Yuqi!

“Boom!”

In an instant, a huge handprint appeared on the ground!

Smoke and dust rose up, blocking everyone’s line of sight.

This strike not only made Yan Yuqi’s body drip with blood, but it also destroyed his confidence!

“How... how is this possible?”

Yan Yuqi lay on the ground in pain.

His body was damaged in many places, and his bones were shattered! He couldn’t even stand up.

“How is this possible...” Yan Yuqi didn’t believe it!

Qin Yu glanced at him and said coldly, “On account of your young age, I’ll spare your life.”

After saying this, Qin Yu looked at Xia Hang, who was not far away.

At this moment, Xia Hang’s body was surrounded by streams of spiritual energy.

This spiritual energy was flowing into his body through his pores.

Obviously, this was a sign of a breakthrough!

“You want to step into Martial Marquis realm?” Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer.

Fortunately, he came in time. Otherwise, Xia Hang would have succeeded!

Qin Yu immediately strode toward Xia Hang.

At this time, the ten plus members of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association quickly stood out.

They had strong murderous internal qi on their bodies. It was obvious that they wanted to stop Qin Yu.

Qin Yu stopped in his tracks.

He glanced at everyone coldly and said, “You guys think you can stop me?”

As he spoke, the pressure on Qin Yu’s body was suddenly released!

An intense pressure instantly spread out!

“How... how could this be?!” When they felt the pressure on Qin Yu’s body, everyone’s expression changed drastically!

Qin Yu’s strength seemed to have increased by a lot!

“Pu!”

An Inner Strength Grandmaster couldn’t withstand this pressure and vomited blood on the spot!

Everyone looked at each other and couldn’t help but step back.

Qin Yu snorted coldly. He ignored everyone and walked towards Xia Hang with big steps.

At this moment, Xia Hang seemed to be at the crucial moment of breaking through.

His entire body emitted waves of bright light, as if he was about to step into the realm of Martial Marquis at any time!

“You want to step into the realm of Martial Marquis? In your next life,” Qin Yu said coldly.

Golden light circled around Qin Yu’s hand!

A terrifying power instantly surged over!

“Boom!”

Qin Yu didn’t waste any time. He immediately clenched his fist and ruthlessly smashed it toward Xia Hang with a violent force!

“Bang!”

With this punch, Xia Hang was sent flying. His body slid for dozens of meters before he stabilized his body!

Blood seeped out of the corner of Xia Hang’s mouth, many of his bones were broken, and his internal qi became extremely chaotic!

He opened his eyes, and his expression was extremely unsightly!

“Who destroyed my realm?!”

Xia Hang raised his head and roared angrily!

“Me!”

Qin Yu said coldly.

When he heard Qin Yu’s voice, Xia Hang’s expression became even more unsightly!

He glared at Qin Yu and said through gritted teeth, “You’re actually not crippled!”

Qin Yu sneered. “Yeah, it seems that your Dragon Vein power isn’t that good either.”

Xia Hang’s whole body was trembling with rage.

He stared at Qin Yu and said with despair, “I was just a step away from becoming a Martial Marquis. Because of you, all my efforts have been wasted!”

“Qin Yu, you b*stard, I’m going to tear you into pieces!” Xia Hang’s angry roar almost spread throughout the entire Dragon Vein!

Qin Yu sneered. “Serves you right. You’ll stay in the half-step Martial Marquis realm for the rest of your life.”

Xia Hang’s eyes were red, and a strong murderous internal qi filled his chest!

His hands trembled as he said coldly, “I want to cut you into ten thousand pieces! I want to cut you into ten thousand pieces!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the power of the Dragon Vein instantly rose!

A powerful force suddenly appeared at the position of Qin Yu’s chest!

“Dong!”

At such a close distance, there was no way to dodge.

Qin Yu was instantly sent flying dozens of steps by this force, and a tiny bloody hole appeared on his chest.

“As expected of the power of the Dragon Vein.” Qin Yu wiped the fresh blood from his chest and couldn’t help but squint his eyes slightly.

“Go to h*ll!”

Xia Hang’s palm slid quickly, and countless forces attacked Qin Yu’s body!

These forces exploded around Qin Yu like a bomb!

In an instant, Qin Yu’s body was enveloped by a wave of thick smoke!

Xia Hang didn’t stop there. He seemed to have gone mad and his hands kept sliding in the air!

This was the power of the terrain raining down on Qin Yu!

The ground where Qin Yu was was turned into ashes!

After an unknown amount of time, Xia Hang finally stopped as he panted.

He stared in Qin Yu’s direction and gritted his teeth. “You actually interrupted my breakthrough... You b*stard!”

The smoke and dust gradually settled down.

Qin Yu’s entire body was almost covered in blood! However, not only did his internal qi not show any signs of weakness, but it was also unprecedentedly strong!

“Other than the power of the Dragon Vein, what else can you rely on?” Qin Yu didn’t seem to feel any pain. His clear eyes looked in Xia Hang’s direction coldly.

Xia Hang’s expression was somewhat ugly.

Qin Yu looked extremely miserable, but in reality, his foundation had not been damaged at all.

In other words, the power of the Dragon Vein was only be able to scratch Qin Yu’s skin!

“What else can you rely on?” Qin Yu opened his mouth, and amidst the blood, his white tooth showed.

Xia Hang roared angrily, “Qin Yu, you’re going too far!”

With an explosive roar, eight streams of energy shot out from Qin Yu’s surroundings before instantly engulfing Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s physical body was once again pushed back!

But this time, he only took three steps back!

In contrast to the scene of him being sent flying at the beginning, these three steps filled Xia Hang with fear!

Xia Hang gritted his teeth and once again unleashed the power of the Dragon Vein!

This time, the power was even more powerful and it attacked Qin Yu’s body crazily!

However, this time, Qin Yu only took one step back!

“How is this possible?” Xia Hang’s expression was extremely unsightly!

He didn’t dare to think too much about it and hurriedly activated the power of the Dragon Vein again!

However, this time, Qin Yu didn’t take a single step back!

“Ah!!! Impossible?” Xia Hang went crazy. He tried his best to activate this power!

This time, Qin Yu withstood the power of the Dragon Vein and walked towards Xia Hang step by step!

The sounds of collision continued to be heard. Countless rays of energy left white spots on Qin Yu’s body.

However, they were unable to stop Qin Yu from walking forward!

Gradually, the power of the Dragon Vein seemed to have no effect on Qin Yu anymore!

He completely ignored the power of the Dragon Vein!

“How... how could this be?!” Large beads of sweat appeared on Xia Hang’s forehead, and he was extremely terrified!

He, the dignified vice president of the Jingdu Martial Arts Association, was actually starting to be afraid at this moment! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Tell me, without the power of the Dragon Vein, what else do you have?” Qin Yu said coldly.
