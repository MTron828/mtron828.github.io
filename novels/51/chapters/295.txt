Chapter 296: Heavenly Tribulation! Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

Chi Feng had obviously lost his patience. The support of his enormous inner strength had placed him in an undefeatable position.

A whirlwind formed around his body and the huge wave of air carried the power to destroy everything.

A dragon head began to condense on his fist.

Qin Yu’s forehead was covered in a layer of sweat. His expression was somewhat ugly.

With Qin Yu’s current state, it was impossible for him to withstand this punch!

“Chi Feng, stop!” Gu Taichu roared.

Chi Feng glanced at Gu Taichu coldly and said, “Old b*stard, after I kill Qin Yu, you will be next!”

Since he was already known as someone who tried to murder his mentor, Chi Feng might as well go all out!

“Chi Feng, I won’t let you have your way!” Gu Taichu took a step forward, and the qi energy on his body exploded rapidly!

“You’re too big for your britches!” Chi Feng snorted and immediately threw a punch!

Gu Taichu didn’t dare to be negligent, and hurriedly waved his Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist to meet it!

Boom!

The power of the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist was beyond imagination, but the two sides were only evenly matched!

“Old b*stard, if you dare to block my path, I will never forgive you!” Chi Feng roared again and again!

He clenched his fists and performed the same move, the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

The two sides clashed fiercely, and deafening sounds exploded continuously!

Gu Taichu seemed to be struggling! However, he used all his strength in an attempt to stop Chi Feng!

Chi Feng was furious at the stalemate!

“You’re quite capable, old b*stard,” Chi Feng said with a cold expression.

Even though he was three realms higher, Chi Feng still couldn’t kill Gu Taichu in a short amount of time!

Gu Taichu panted and said coldly, “If you stop now, it’s still not too late...”

“Hahahaha! Gu Taichu, stop dreaming. All of you will die today!” Chi Feng laughed crazily.

Gu Taichu’s face was ashen, and his stamina was rapidly decreasing.

Just as Gu Taichu was hesitating, Chi Feng suddenly used the Shrinking Ground Into An Inch technique, bypassing Gu Taichu and closing in on Qin Yu!

“You can’t escape!” Chi Feng revealed a crazed expression as he gripped the Absolute Beginning Sacred Fist!

The blinding light made it impossible to open one’s eyes!

Qin Yu’s pupils dilated, but it was too late to dodge!

“Chi Feng, stop!” Gu Taichu roared with all his might! However, Chi Feng completely ignored him!

“Boom!”

The force of this punch was like a waterfall that poured down on Qin Yu’s body!

“Qin Yu!!” Gu Taichu’s pupils dilated and he was extremely furious!

Yao Qing’s eyes were filled with anger as he clenched his fists tightly!

As the light fell, Qin Yu collapsed to the ground with his body covered in blood.

His body was almost shattered, and dense cracks could be seen everywhere.

His sparkling white bones were exposed and looked extremely horrifying.

Gu Taichu rushed to Qin Yu with all his strength. He held Qin Yu and said in pain, “Qin Yu, you... You can’t die...”

However, Qin Yu had no reaction. He laid on the ground and didn’t move.

His weak breathing seemed like it might disappear at any time.

“Chi Feng, you b*stard!” Gu Taichu’s eyes were full of killing intent!

However, Chi Feng didn’t care at all. He sneered. “Old b*stard, after I kill Qin Yu, you will be next.”

After saying that, Chi Feng condensed his hands and slowly raised them.

A huge palm suddenly appeared in the sky above Qin Yu!

Along with Chi Feng’s explosive shout, this palm ruthlessly smashed towards Qin Yu!

Crack!

The ground beneath Qin Yu shattered!

A huge palm print appeared in front of everyone!

Gu Taichu didn’t dodge. Instead, he blocked in front of Qin Yu.

But even so, Qin Yu’s physical body still suffered a huge impact, and he looked completely unrecognizable.

“Hahahaha!” Chi Feng couldn’t help but reveal a proud smile.

He tried to sense Qin Yu’s internal qi, but he found that Qin Yu was still not dead!

“Huh?” Chi Feng frowned slightly.

It shouldn’t be. With this strike, Qin Yu should have died.

“He really is quite unkillable,” Chi Feng said with a cold smile.

He raised his palm, and then streams of internal qi shot out like cannonballs while continuously smashing toward various parts of Qin Yu’s body!

“Bang! Bang! Bang!” The sounds of explosions rang out incessantly, and Qin Yu’s body continued to shatter!

However, what annoyed Chi Feng was that Qin Yu still didn’t die!

“What on earth is going on?” Chi Feng didn’t dare to stop what he was doing, and bombarded Qin Yu with a barrage of attacks!

Right at this moment, Qin Yu’s body suddenly flickered with a weak light.

This light stuck close to Qin Yu’s body before wrapping him up.

“Hmm? What’s going on?” Chi Feng couldn’t help but frown.

Even Gu Taichu was somewhat puzzled. After this ray of light appeared, Qin Yu’s body actually started to recover!

Rumble!

Just as everyone was puzzled, dark clouds suddenly covered the sky!

Within the dark clouds, extremely terrifying lightning was brewing!

“Is it going to rain?” Chi Feng raised his head and looked at the sky, then he couldn’t help but frown.

At this moment, waves of terrifying internal qi suddenly spread out from Qin Yu’s body!

“This... This is the Heavenly Tribulation?” Gu Taichu was the first to realize it!

He raised his head to look at the lightning that was like a snake swimming in the dark clouds and he couldn’t help but turn pale with fright!

Qin Yu actually broke through at this time? Moreover, he welcomed his first Heavenly Tribulation?

“Heavenly Tribulation?” Chi Feng’s expression couldn’t help but change.

He was just at the Inner Strength Master Hands level, yet he already welcomed the Heavenly Tribulation. Was he some sort of freaky genius?

“I have to kill him quickly!” Chi Feng’s eyes shone as he swiftly rushed towards Qin Yu!

“Kacha!”

However, just as Chi Feng was about to attack Qin Yu, a muffled thunder descended!

The power from the sky immediately filled Chi Feng’s face with fear! He hurriedly dodged to the side!

“If this Heavenly Tribulation falls on my body, even if I don’t die, I will be heavily injured.” Chi Feng’s expression was solemn.

“Crack!”

Another bolt of lightning struck down and struck Qin Yu’s body!

Qin Yu fell to the ground without moving at all and allowing this Heavenly Tribulation to strike his body!

“Hmph, even if I don’t take action, this Heavenly Tribulation is enough to kill him.” Seeing the power of this Heavenly Tribulation, Chi Feng couldn’t help but sneer.

Gu Taichu felt somewhat uneasy.

He had never seen a Heavenly Tribulation of this scale!

Moreover, Qin Yu had already lost consciousness, so how could he resist this Heavenly Tribulation?

He tried to sense Qin Yu’s internal qi and found that although Qin Yu’s qi energy was weak, he wasn’t dead.

Rumble...

The next Heavenly Tribulation seemed to be brewing in the dark clouds in the sky.

The entire sky was illuminated, and even the dark clouds turned blue!

“No one can withstand such a powerful Heavenly Tribulation,” Chi Feng sneered.

Crack! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Finally, the Heavenly Tribulation that had been brewing for a long time fell at this moment!

In an instant, Qin Yu’s surroundings seemed to have turned into a sea of lightning!

Clanging sounds were incessant, and the terrifying deterrence made people dare not to approach.
