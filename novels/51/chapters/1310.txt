Chapter 1311: Chapter 1,311, the news of the aura of life 

As soon as these words were said, the expression of the nocturnal clothes changed drastically.

He could not afford to offend Wen Wanji. That fellow was a well-known ruthless person in the southern region. Even the Heavenly Cloud sect was not willing to offend him.

“Alright, let’s go.”The nocturnal clothes waved his hand and led his men away.

After they had gone far away, Wen da stood up and asked, “When did my grandfather come? There are still a few days before the day we agreed to return home.”

The big-bellied general smiled and said, “Young Master Wen, I was just trying to scare him. Otherwise, he would definitely pester us endlessly.”

Wen Da patted the big-bellied general’s shoulder with slight admiration and said, “Not bad. I think highly of you. You have the potential to become a city lord in the future!”

“Aiyo, I don’t dare to accept that.”The big-bellied general said with a terrified expression.

“Alright, if there’s nothing else, you can leave. Don’t delay us brothers from drinking and having fun.”Wen Er waved his hand and said.

“Alright, Young Master Wen, then I Won’t disturb you.”

The big-bellied general brought his men and quickly left the Ju Xian house.

Qin Yu couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

It was so close. He was almost exposed.

I must quickly hide this Huangji Buddha Flame. Qin Yu thought to himself.

Qin Yu had no way to swallow this Huangji Buddha Flame, so he could only hide it for now and wait for his spiritual power to recover before swallowing it.

In the next few days, almost everyone in the South Province was talking about this matter.

They searched more than half of the South Province, but they still couldn’t find the Huangji Buddha Flame. A few days later, the matter gradually calmed down.

Early in the morning.

The three of them were sleeping soundly in the same room, but at this time, there was a knock on the door from outside.

“Go, open the door.”In a daze, Wen da kicked Wen Er.

“Why aren’t You F * cking going?”Wen Er turned around and kicked him back.

Wen Da was immediately filled with anger. As he got up, he scolded, “F * cking thing, I’ll teach you a lesson sooner or later!”

As he muttered, he walked towards the door.

When the door opened, Wen da immediately changed his expression and put on a loving posture.

There was no other reason, but the person standing at the door was the auctioneer.

The auctioneer wrinkled her nose slightly and said, “What a strong smell of alcohol.”

When Big Wen heard this, he immediately used the topic to say, “Sigh, because you rejected me, I was heartbroken and could only drink all day long. You Don’t even know how much pain I’ve been through these past few days...”

When she heard Big Wen’s words, the auctioneer couldn’t help but cover her mouth and laugh softly.

“I knew you wouldn’t be able to let go of me! Right?”A glimmer of hope ignited in Big Wen’s heart.

The female auctioneer rolled her eyes and said, “I’m here to look for Qin Yu.”

When Big Wen heard this, his old face immediately darkened and he returned to his room in a bad mood.

He kicked Qin Yu’s butt and said angrily, “It’s for you. Damn it, disturbing my sleep!”

Qin Yu sat up from the bed in a daze. The hangover from last night made him look rather worn out.

When he saw the female auctioneer at the door, Qin Yu quickly got up and tidied his hair. Then, he quickly went up to greet her.

“Sorry, the room is a bit messy,”Qin Yu said with slight embarrassment.

The female auctioneer smiled. As she walked into the room, she looked at the structure of the room. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qin Yu quickly made her a cup of tea and said politely, “Fellow Daoist, why are you here all of a sudden?”

The auctioneer placed her small black bag on the table and said with a faint smile, “Didn’t you ask me to come?”

“Ah?”Qin Yu was stunned.

“F * ck, Qin Yu, you are not human!”Wen Da, who was pretending to be asleep, immediately sat up and grabbed Qin Yu’s body.

The female auctioneer beside him laughed so hard that she couldn’t close her mouth. She said coquettishly, “Alright, stop fooling around. I’m here for the aura of life.”

As soon as she said this, Qin Yu immediately looked at the auctioneer with a serious expression.

“Fellow Daoist, don’t tell me that you have the aura of life in your hands?”Qin Yu said while holding back his excitement.

Wen Da, who was beside him, also put his ear close to him.

Seeing this, the auctioneer smiled and said, “Why don’t we go somewhere else to talk?”

“Ah, okay.”Qin Yu agreed without thinking.

The two of them stood up and walked out of the door. When Wen da saw them, he grimaced.

“Damn it, am I not as handsome as Qin Yu?”Wen Da grabbed Wen er, who was sleeping, and said angrily.

Wen Er carefully sized him up and said, “En... I don’t know if he’s handsome or not, but your temperament is really too wretched.”

“F * CK Your Grandpa!”

...

At a certain window seat in the Juxian building.

Qin Yu and the female auctioneer were sitting opposite each other.

“Fellow Daoist, where’s that vital energy?”Qin Yu impatiently asked.

However, the female auctioneer raised her eyebrows and rolled her eyes. “How can you ask someone to do something like this? If I’m not wrong, you don’t even know my name, right?”

Qin Yu suddenly appeared a little embarrassed. Only then did he realize that he had lost his composure.

He coughed and said, “May I know your name, fellow Daoist?”

The auctioneer seemed to like Qin Yu’s posture. She covered her mouth and laughed softly. Then, she said, “The people in the auction all call me sister Lin.”

“So it’s sister Lin. I’ve heard a lot about you,”Qin Yu said politely.

After exchanging pleasantries, Qin Yu couldn’t wait to ask, “Sister Lin, where is that vital energy?”
