Chapter 217: Dignity Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio

In the face of the female streamer’s domineering attitude, the worker looked flustered.

“But... I really didn’t do it...” the worker explained anxiously.

But the female streamer didn’t care at all.

She didn’t care about the truth of the matter. As long as she controlled the public’s opinion, even what was fake could become real!

For the so-called live broadcast effect, so what if a migrant worker was sacrificed?

“I’m telling you, lick my shoes quickly, or else I’ll have you arrested right now!” The female influencer said arrogantly.

The worker’s expression was extremely ugly. He stood there without knowing what to do.

“Are you going to lick or not?” The female live streamer seemed to be a little impatient.

She shouted at the live broadcast room, “He won’t agree. Sigh, actually, I want to forgive him, but I have to teach him a little lesson. Otherwise, there’s no telling what he will do in the future.”

The netizens in the live broadcast room who didn’t know the truth immediately buzzed. “Hurry up and have him arrested! We can’t let this kind of person get away with it!”

The female influencer sneered.

She sized up the worker and said, “I’m giving you one last chance. Do you want to lick or not?”

The worker’s expression was pale. He also had his dignity, but when he thought of the children at home who were still waiting for their tuition to be paid, the worker felt deflated.

The dignity of a middle-aged man was crushed under the burden of providing for his family.

He bent down and was about to kneel down when a hand grabbed his arm.

He looked up and saw Qin Yu looking coldly at the female streamer in front of him.

“What are you doing?” The female streamer said while glaring at him.

Qin Yu said coldly, “Kneel down.”

The female streamer sized up Qin Yu and sneered. “Who are you? You two are in cahoots, right? You want to take advantage of me too, right?”

Qin Yu couldn’t help but sneer. “Are you suffering from paranoia? You look like a pig. Who would take a fancy to you?”

Anger flashed across the female streamer’s expression. She pointed at Qin Yu and said, “Just you wait!”

Then, she shouted into her phone, “Look, another hooligan has come. I suspect that these two are in cahoots, I...”

Before she could finish her sentence, Qin Yu smashed her phone.

“You dared to smash my phone?” The female streamer’s eyes widened.

“Kneel down! Apologize to this worker,” Qin Yu said coldly.

“Kneel down to him? Is he worthy? A peasant worker, i...”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered to listen to her nonsense. He stretched out his hand and pressed it on her shoulder.

Under this huge force, the female streamer fell to her knees with a plop and was unable to move!

“What’s going on?!”

At this moment, a man rushed over from not far away.

Seeing this man, Qin Yu couldn’t help but feel stunned.

Because this man was none other than a good friend of his when he was young!

“Li Feng?!” Qin Yu’s eyes flashed with surprise.

Li Feng sized up Qin Yu and frowned slightly.

“You don’t remember me? I’m Qin Yu!” Qin Yu said anxiously.

Li Feng said with a dark expression, “Qin Yu, I’m at work now. Please call me Director Li.”

Qin Yu’s expression suddenly changed slightly.

“What’s going on?” Li Feng asked with a cold expression.

“Director Li, I’m the influencer that you invited! It’s bad enough that this migrant worker wanted to molest me, but this b*stard even made me kneel!” The female live streamer complained first.

“I’m telling you, you have to give me an explanation!” The female live streamer snorted.

“It’s not like that. She’s bullying people.” Qin Yu frowned and told Li Feng what happened.

However, Li Feng said with a cold expression, “Qin Yu, do you know who this is? She’s an A-list influencer! She’s here to promote our scenic spot! Who allowed you to hit her? Quickly apologize!”

When he heard Li Feng’s words, Qin Yu’s expression turned completely cold.

“Li Feng, did you not hear what I said? It’s her...”

“Don’t talk to me about these useless things!” Li Feng interrupted Qin Yu’s words.

“Qin Yu, of course a person of your class wouldn’t understand the benefits involved.”

“I don’t care who’s right or wrong. I only care about who provides higher value benefits! Understand?!”

“Now, apologize to her right now!”

Qin Yu sneered again and again.

He looked at this old friend of his when he was young and felt that he was a stranger.

“Li Feng, you really let me down.” Qin Yu shook his head. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Li Feng didn’t want to continue arguing with Qin Yu.

He turned to look at the migrant worker and said with a dark expression, “You’re fired!”

The worker’s expression suddenly became a little ugly. He hurriedly explained, “I didn’t touch her at all. She framed me...”

“Cut the crap!” Li Feng said impatiently.

Disappointment flashed across the worker’s expression.

He sighed and said in a low voice, “I got it.”

“Don’t worry. You won’t be fired.” At this time, Qin Yu patted his shoulder.

“Hehe, Qin Yu, this isn’t up to you.” Li Feng sneered.

Qin Yu looked at Li Feng. He suppressed his anger and said, “For the sake of our previous friendship, I can give you a chance. Take back your words and I’ll pretend that nothing happened.”

Li Feng couldn’t help but laugh when he heard that, “Qin Yu, why are you so childish? Our previous friendship? Who remembers?”

“I’m now one of the people in charge of this construction site! Other than Director Kong, I have the biggest say!”

“You’re giving me a chance? Are you daydreaming?”

Yao Qing, who was at the side, clenched his fists and immediately took a step forward.

However, Qin Yu reached out to stop him.

“Okay, remember what you said.” Qin Yu nodded to Li Feng.

The female influencer even shouted, “Idiot, if you don’t have the ability, why are you standing up for him? What the h*ll!”

Qin Yu couldn’t be bothered with her, but he felt a little sad.

He had also climbed up from the bottom, so he could understand how difficult life was at the bottom.

After leaving with Yao Qing, Qin Yu went straight to Director Kong’s office.

After entering the office, Qin Yu told Kong Ping his thoughts.

“Miss Kong, please surround the vicinity of this villa. I want to use it,” Qin Yu said while pointing at the plan.

Kong Ping quickly nodded and said, “No problem! You are my boss and my idol. It’s up to you!”

Qin Yu smiled and said, “How long will it take?”

Kong Ping thought for a moment and said, “Three days.”

“It’s too long.” Qin Yu frowned.

“Speed up the progress,” Qin Yu said.

“Okay, I’ll give you an answer in two days!” Kong Ping said quickly.

She immediately took out her cell phone and made a call.

“Li Feng, come to my office. I have something for you to do,” Kong Ping said.

Li Feng didn’t dare to waste any time and hurriedly ran to Kong Ping’s office.

As soon as he entered the office, Li Feng saw Qin Yu.

He said with a cold expression, “Qin Yu, what are you doing here? Hurry up and get out. If you have anything to say, wait for me to get off work!”
