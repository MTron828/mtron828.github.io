2459 Path of Advancement

Qin Yu frowned deeply. It was indeed as Flower Granny had said.

He had too many cultivation methods at the moment. Regardless of the Way of Space or the Way of Annihilation, he had some understanding. Particularly the spatial power that he could use the power of the blurry primordial rune.

However, compared to Yan Ruoxue, the gap was evident.

Although he could use the power of origin, the usage was vastly different from Yan Ruoxue’s method.

He could never unleash Yan Ruoxue’s move just now, no matter what.

Only when one understood the basic rules to the extreme could one immediately understand the composition of this power and then manifest similar techniques.

The other power was the power of thunder. He now possessed the Heart of Thunder but had only comprehended the first or second level of the power. He could not even pry into the power of the seabed.

If he had enough time to cultivate the Way of Thunder, Qin Yu was confident that he could pry into the power of the origin with the support of the Heart of Thunder.

However, there was a problem. His spatial power of the origin could directly release the most potent attack by combining the power of the Tribulation Third Level with the power of the origin.

He cultivated the Way of Thunder and Lightning, and his most potent attack should not be too far off, even if he had a glimpse of the power of the origin.

Even if the power of the thunder and lightning attack was more powerful, it would not have a qualitative change.

This was what Flower Granny had reminded him of. If he had to spend a lot of time cultivating another way, he might as well test out a rule to its limits. That way, he could unleash the most potent attack power.

“Everyone’s physique is different. I can’t say which path suits you, but I can see you’re unsure about it now. That’s why I must remind you to find a suitable path for yourself as soon as possible. Otherwise, you’ll be left behind by Ruoxue and us sooner or later.”

Flower Granny’s expression was solemn. Many cultivators encountered similar problems.

The more he was greedy for comprehension of the rules and wasted too much time, the result was achieving nothing. Flower Granny was worried that this would happen to Qin Yu.

“Time is more precious than spirit essence now. After Ruoxue, other people will similarly face the Nine Dragon Thunder Tribulation. After the Golden Path of Heaven, all kinds of evil creatures will appear. As far as I know, Yan Tianshi, Si Liuhe, and others have achieved great breakthroughs. They might not be weaker than you now.”

Lei Xin also reminded him by the side.

“Also, don’t forget the hundred-year agreement between you and Si Shiyue. No one has ever cultivated in seclusion and accumulated strength for so long. When he comes out, he will definitely become the most brilliant star of the human race. Now, almost all the Supreme Elders of the Si family have returned for the sake of Si Shiyue to prevent any untoward incidents. You, also a chaotic body, can’t avoid this battle.”

Flower Granny reminded him again. The Lei family also had spies in the Si family, so they had a rough understanding of Si Shiyue’s situation.

“Understood. I need to take advantage of this time in purgatory to settle down.”

Qin Yu nodded solemnly.

After the Tribulation Transcending Stage, everyone would take a different path, and there would be deviations in their cultivations. Therefore, it was crucial to decide on the overall direction first.

For example, Yan Ruoxue had long comprehended the Yan family’s immortal scripture and walked the path of comprehending the Way of Spatial Rules to the extreme.

It also happened to be compatible with her bloodline and cultivation technique, which was why she advanced so quickly.

At this moment, after nearly half a day’s journey, they arrived at purgatory.

In purgatory, Lonely Cloud City.

Everyone felt the world spin, and they immediately arrived at a continent where demonic smoke was billowing.

In the vast Lonely Cloud City, countless humans were guarding there.

Among them, there was no lack of people with formidable strength. There were even quite many cultivators in the previous years of the Path of Heaven.

It was not that they were unwilling to leave. It was because in a place as scarce as purgatory, even if the planar suppression had reduced, it would still cost a lot of spiritual essences to teleport back. Most people could not afford it.

Of course, some human race cultivators were also stationed here to defend against the monster race.

After the great war broke out, people from the Holy Region also volunteered to come to purgatory to hunt the monster race. Therefore, the appearance of Qin Yu and the others did not cause much commotion.

The surrounding people only glanced at them when they appeared and ignored them.

A group of people seemed to have noticed their movements and walked over.

“These people should be from the aristocratic families. Look at their clothes. They all have names.”

Ji Yue said softly by the side.

“Everyone is now in a state of war. Everything focuses on the overall situation. I hope everyone can cooperate with our command and work together to kill the monster race. I am the captain of the city’s commando team, and my name is Yan Tianmen.”

When this person walked in and saw several Tribulation Transcending Stage cultivators in the group, his attitude immediately became much better.

“Don’t worry. We came from the Holy Region to kill the monster race.”

Qin Yu nodded. Although this person was from the Yan family, Qin Yu was still very impressed that he still stayed here at this time.

“Can you roughly give us an introduction of the current situation here? We’re new here and don’t know much about it.” Lei Xin’s divine sense swept out, and he immediately felt something was wrong.

The smell of blood in the air was too dense. It was unknown how many battles had been fought.

“Now that we’ve lost the planar suppression, and theoretically speaking, there’s no specific limit to the strength of the monster race in purgatory. From the current intelligence, the eight Godly Kings of the monster race have all entered purgatory. These Godly Kings’ cultivation at least has the strength of the Third Level Soul Sinking. Moreover, their bodies are tremendously tough. Previously, three human cultivators at the advanced stage of the third level attempted to ambush the Blood Godly King, who was at the same third level, but he still managed to escape in the end.”

Yan Tianmen said with a bitter smile.

“Three against one in an ambush but still failed to kill him?” Lei Xin frowned deeply.

“Moreover, they are all at the advanced stage of the Tribulation Transcending Stage. According to our analysis, the strength of the monster race is one level higher than ours. As their demon god bodies and various methods are too strange, the only place the human race has preserved is Solitary Cloud City. There are also other places, but all are to resist the monster race. Once the monster race army goes there, there will probably be no escape.”

Lei Xin nodded. He glanced around and saw quite some experts here.

Moreover, all gathered in Solitary Cloud City, which was relatively safe for the time being.

“Qin Yu, can we go to the Fire Unicorn Continent first? There’s a large group of family members there, nearly 300 of them,” Ji Yue said anxiously.

“Alright, I’ll listen to you.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Qin Yu’s main purpose for this round was also for the Ji Yue family members, so the faster, the better.

A cold and ominous gaze immediately focused on Qin Yu when they left the city.

Xing Xiu!

Not long after Qin Yu entered purgatory, Xing Xiu, whom Qin Yu destroyed a trace of his soul of origin, met Qin Yu again.
