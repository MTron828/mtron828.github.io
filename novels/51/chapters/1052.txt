Chapter 1053: Chapter One Thousand and fifty-three, Slaughter! 

The so-called divine weapon was actually so unbearable!

That Martial Marquis froze on the spot, sweat pouring down like a waterfall!

Qin Yu raised his finger, and a flash of light instantly arrived, wiping out his divine sense!

Not far away, Chi Hou was slowly recovering his physical body.

He glared angrily at Qin Yu, and the two consecutive times he suffered defeat made him both shocked and afraid!

This Qin Yu was not an ordinary martial saint at all! No Wonder Zhai Xing was so fearful!

“Recover your physical body? Do you think I can’t Kill You?”Qin Yu sneered as he looked at Chi Hou who had once again gathered together.

Chi Hou shouted, “Brat, you’ve cultivated so arrogantly. I’ll let you see my forbidden technique!”

In an instant, a brilliant light rose in all directions and killing intent drowned the Earth. The forbidden technique instantly appeared!

Thousands of Great Dao gathered on a white spear! This white spear seemed to be able to pierce through the heavens and earth. It was abnormally terrifying!

This was a forbidden technique bestowed upon him by the second mystic realm. It was incomparably terrifying. It was said that when cultivated to the extreme, it could even cut off one’s life force!

“Go to hell!”Chi Hou roared angrily, and the white spear shot towards Qin Yu explosively!

A waterfall-like internal Qi descended from the White Spear, wiping the ground until it was covered in scars!

Facing this forbidden technique, Qin Yu’s eyes exploded with a cold glint

With a furious roar, the Vajra’s holy body technique was fully displayed. Following that, he stretched out his two arms and grabbed the white spear!

“Chi la!”

The white spear was as hot as the sun. The Moment Qin Yu touched it, traces of internal Qi that were scorched instantly spread out!

But even so, Qin Yu still held onto the white spear tightly!

His arms were emitting smoke because of the temperature! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, Qin Yu’s arms exerted strength and actually broke the white spear!

“How is this possible!”

Chi Hou’s expression changed greatly!

His forbidden technique was actually broken just like that!

“Whoosh!”

Qin Yu pointed with his finger, and a light spread out, heading straight for Chi Hou’s glabella!

“Swoosh!”

Before Chi Hou could react, the brilliant light had already pierced through his glabella and brain matter splattered everywhere!

However, something that shocked Qin Yu happened. Chi Hou’s body had actually condensed once again!

His primordial spirit was actually uninjured!

“Eh?”

Even Qin Yu was somewhat surprised.

Could it be that his primordial spirit was not at the glabella at all?

Chi Hou, who had condensed his body once again, stood not far away and panted heavily.

He was starting to feel afraid.

This young man in front of him was too terrifying. He was definitely not someone he could deal with!

“Let’s see how many times you can reunite!”

Qin Yu punched out and shattered Chi Hou’s physical body once again!

His body had turned into pieces of minced meat, but even so, his body was still slowly recovering.

“His primordial spirit is probably not in his body,”at this moment, the immortal crane suddenly reminded.

Qin Yu seemed to have understood something. He stepped forward and picked up a ring from the pieces of flesh.

This ring was Chi Hou’s spatial divine artifact!

His primordial spirit was very likely hidden in this spatial divine artifact!

Sure enough, Chi Hou’s expression instantly became somewhat panicked after the ring was taken away.

He looked nervously at Qin Yu and said, “Return the ring to me.”

Qin Yu sneered and said, “How will you recover your body if your primordial spirit is shattered?”

“No!”Chi Hou panicked! The purpose of his trip was to make a contribution. He didn’t want to die here!

“Qin Yu, return the ring to me. Everything can be discussed!”

“Discussed? What am I discussing with you?”Qin Yu sneered.

Chi Hou gritted his teeth and said, “I can betray you! Zhai Xing doesn’t know what’s good for him, but I’m different. I can attack the second secret realm with you. You and I will work together!”

Qin Yu played with the ring and sneered, “Work together with you? Do you think you’re Worthy?”

Chi Hou saw this and couldn’t help but shout angrily, “Qin Yu! Return the ring to me, or I won’t spare you!”

“Is that so?”

Qin Yu clenched his hand, and the spatial artifact was crushed into pieces!

Chi Hou’s divine sense also flew out!

“Not everyone has the right to betray us. You should just die.”Qin Yu’s fingers flashed with light as he shot towards the primordial spirit!

“Qin Yu! The second mystic realm will definitely not let you off! Little Bastard, I’ll wait for You Underground!”Chi Hou’s hoarse roar spread throughout the entire Heaven Gate!

As the light shot in, Chi Hou’s divine sense was pierced through and dissipated into thin air!

His body fell to the ground and he never stood up again.

Martial Marquis, who had walked out of the second secret realm, instantly panicked. Even Chi Hou had died, so there was no meaning for them to continue fighting.

Some people wanted to submit, but the demonic beasts, who hated humans by nature, had already killed until their eyes were red, so how could they give up!

The disciples of the secret realm, whose morale had been reduced, instantly lost the will to fight.

This great battle instantly turned into a one-sided massacre!

The entire heaven gate was dyed red with blood, and the stench of blood filled the entire heaven gate. It was extremely pungent.

The battle continued for a long time, and the mystic realm martial artists fell one after another!

The first attack of the second mystic realm had failed!

This was naturally an extremely encouraging thing for the Heaven Gate!

Qin Yu did not want to stop it, and quietly watched the massacre.

After a long time, the battle came to an end.

Almost all the 1,000 martial Marquis sent by the Second Secret Realm had died in battle!

Qin Yu’s expression was extremely cold. A martial marquis who had rolled to his feet was looking at him in horror.

Qin Yu picked him up with one hand. A trace of internal Qi was injected into his body, temporarily restoring his aura.

Then, Qin Yu pointed with his finger, and a ray of light entered his mind.

The Martial Marquis looked at Qin Yu in horror, not even able to beg for mercy.

“Go back and tell Gu Zizhen to wait for me in the second secret realm. Three days later, I will bring people to crush the second secret realm,”Qin Yu said coldly.

The Martial Marquis, who had saved his life, nodded desperately.

Qin Yu patted his shoulder and said, “Let’s go.”

Without turning his head, he ran away.
