Hearing Yongji’s words, the deputy sect master frowned and said, “Are you planning to negotiate?”

“That’s right, I am.”Yongji said with a smile.

The deputy sect master hurriedly said, “Our sect master can’t go. When the time comes, I will go on behalf of the sect master.”

Yongji laughed loudly and said, “If the sect master can’t go, then it means that the heavenly cloud sect treats all living things in the world as nothing. At that time, our northern land can only comply with one of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.”

These words were very sneaky, and in an instant, the pressure was transferred to the Heavenly Cloud sect.

“I agree!”

At this time, Kong you stood out and said.

Yong Ji nodded slightly, and then said, “Okay, then we’ll meet in Yong Ji City in three days.”

After saying this, Yong Ji walked out quickly.

After he left, Di Zun finally let out a sigh of relief, and his forehead was covered with layers of secret sweat.

It was obvious that he was under a lot of pressure to pretend to be the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect.

“Damn, Yao Qing’s mental strength is awesome.”Di Zun couldn’t help but think to himself.

“Hehe, it seems that Yongji also wants to talk about this matter.”Kong you said recklessly.

Di Zun took a look and didn’t say a word.

The deputy sect master pulled Di Zun to the side and said, “Who was that sect master just now?”

“Who else could it be? The eighteen gods,”Di Zun said with a bitter smile.

The deputy sect master could not help but have a horrified expression. He said in horror, “Don’t you know that the eighteen gods have no feelings at all? Aren’t you afraid of being exposed?”

Di zun sneered and said, “Yongji is very afraid of our sect master. Even if he suspects, he doesn’t dare to take that risk! That’s why he said that he would invite the sect master for a peace talk in three days. The purpose of doing so is to safely find out the truth.”

“Then what should we do in three days?”The deputy sect master asked with a frown.

Di Zun laughed bitterly and said, “We can only let the eighteen gods continue to pretend. As for whether we can fool them or not, we can only leave it to fate.”

...

After Yongji left the Tianyun sect, the black-robed man who was waiting outside the door quickly walked up.

“How is it? is the sect master of the Tianyun sect here?”The black-robed man asked impatiently.

Yong ji sneered, “Ninety-nine percent is not here.”

“In that case, Lord Sima Bei didn’t lie to you.”The black-robed man said.

“Since that’s the case, there’s no need for us to be polite with them anymore!”

Yong Ji glared at him and berated, “Are you deaf? I said it, it’s only ninety-nine percent. Isn’t there still a one percent chance?”

The black-robed man opened his mouth and was immediately speechless.

Yong Ji narrowed his eyes and sneered, “If the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud sect doesn’t show up in three days, it means that he’s definitely not here. At that time, we can also be unrestrained.”

After saying that, he looked at the black-robed man and said coldly, “Bring people to Yong Ji City. Three days later, I want to prepare a big show.”

“Yes!”

...

In a desert, there was a sudden mausoleum.

Dark Energy was everywhere in this place, and no one was around.

However, in this kind of environment, there was a young man sitting cross-legged, absorbing the dark energy from the mausoleum.

His forehead would sweat from time to time, and it seemed to be extremely difficult.

“Swoosh!”

At this moment, Qin Yu suddenly opened his eyes.

His gaze imagined the mausoleum, as if he was afraid of something.

“Strange, what exactly is in this mausoleum?”Qin Yu frowned.

For some reason, his heart could not calm down, as if there was a pair of eyes staring at him in the dark.

This feeling was extremely strange, and it was exactly the same as the gaze of the green creature back then.

Qin Yu stood up from the ground. He looked into the dark and said in a low voice, “The last time, man with the mustache said that there was definitely something hidden inside. Now, it seems that this kid’s judgment is correct.”

Under such a state of mind, Qin Yu had no way to calm down and cultivate.

What gave Qin Yu a headache was that after cultivating in seclusion for so long, he didn’t feel any signs of breaking through to the middle stage of the Almighty Realm.

“It seems that cultivation isn’t that simple,”Qin Yu thought to himself.

He closed his eyes slightly and tried to absorb the dark energy of the mausoleum again. However, the moment he closed his eyes, that feeling came back again.

“Who is this sneaky person? If you have the ability, come out!”Qin Yu shouted at the tomb!

Terrifying spiritual power shot out from the entrance of the cave, and huge rocks rolled down one after another!

However, other than Qin Yu’s echo, there was no other sound in the cave.

“If you still don’t come out, I will go in!”Qin Yu shouted.

With that, Qin Yu pretended to step into the cave.

At this moment, the ground suddenly shook. Then, a huge hand surged out and slammed fiercely at Qin Yu!

Qin Yu’s face changed greatly. He hurriedly activated the line word formula and shot backward!

The huge hand slammed fiercely on the ground, giving off a loud bang. A terrifying internal Qi surged over, stirring up waves of smoke and dust!

Qin Yu’s expression changed slightly. Just as he was about to stand up, the huge hand in front of him disappeared without a trace.

“What’s going on?”Qin Yu rubbed his eyes. He was surprised to find that there was no palm print on the ground!

“Could it be an illusion?”Qin Yu frowned.

Something was wrong. The feeling just now was extremely clear. If not for the support of the line word formula, the huge hand would definitely have slammed him into the ground!

Qin Yu mustered up his courage and walked towards the cave entrance once again.

He was extremely nervous and was extremely careful along the way.

However, when he reached the cave entrance, he stopped in his tracks.

“Forget it.”Qin Yu shook his head.

The last time in the sacred mausoleum, Qin Yu’s cultivation had disappeared. who could guarantee that there was no aura of death in the mausoleum this time.

If he lost his cultivation at such a critical moment, then he would be in big trouble.

After thinking about it, Qin Yu finally decided to leave this place temporarily to avoid attracting trouble.

Thus, Qin Yu summoned the Divine Eagle and rushed towards the great Yue mountain.

This place wasn’t considered close to the great Yue Mountain, and it would take at least two days to get close to the Divine Eagle.

Along the way, Qin Yu found that the battle situation seemed to have calmed down quite a bit, and the number of cultivators in the northern lands had also decreased by a lot.

“HM? Could it be that someone has made a move?”Qin Yu couldn’t help but be a bit surprised.

With suspicion, Qin Yu headed straight for the great Yue mountain. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Two days later, Qin Yu arrived at the great Yue mountain.

Far Away, Qin Yu heard the voice of Wen Da Wen Er.

As usual, the two of them drank wine as if nothing had happened.

“HM? Wen Da Wen er has actually returned?”Qin Yu was a bit surprised.

Listening carefully, Qin Yu heard a familiar voice again.

“Damn it, I’m not afraid of him. If he dares to come, I’ll shove his head into his butt!”

“Grandpa is awesome! Let’s not talk about other things. If you drink another two Jin, I reckon you can shove the head of the sect leader of the Heavenly Cloud sect into his butt too!”
